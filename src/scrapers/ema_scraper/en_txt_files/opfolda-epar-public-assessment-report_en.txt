1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Amicus Therapeutics Europe Limited submitted on 5 November 2021 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Opfolda, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 July 2020. 
At  initial  submission,  Opfolda  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  EU/3/18/2129  on  11 
January  2019.  Opfolda  was  designated  as  an  orphan  medicinal  product  in  the  following  condition: 
Treatment  of  glycogen  storage  disease  type  II  (Pompe's  disease).  In  March  2023,  Opfolda  was 
withdrawn from the Union Register of orphan medicinal products upon request of the applicant. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
Opfolda is indicated in co-administration with cipaglucosidase alfa for use in the long-term treatment of 
adults aged 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase [GAA] 
deficiency). 
The final indication is as follows: 
Opfolda (miglustat) is an enzyme stabiliser of cipaglucosidase alfa long-term enzyme replacement 
therapy in adults with late-onset Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Zavesca miglustat 100 mg hard capsules are used as the reference miglustat medicinal product in the 
present application. This medicinal product has been authorised for marketing since 2002 (EU/1/02/238). 
It is currently authorised for type 1 Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease as follows: 
Type 1 Gaucher disease 
Miglustat  is  indicated  for  the  oral  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  type  1  Gaucher 
disease. Miglustat may be used only in the treatment of patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy 
is unsuitable.  
The recommended starting dose for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is 100 
mg three times a day (i.e. 300 mg/day). Temporary dose reduction to 100 mg once or twice a day may 
be necessary in some patients because of diarrhoea. 
Niemann-Pick type C disease  
Miglustat is also indicated for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult patients 
and paediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
The recommended dose for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and above with Niemann-Pick type 
C disease is 200 mg three times a day (i.e. 600 mg/day). Dosing in patients under the age of 12 years 
should be adjusted based on body surface area. Temporary dose reduction may be necessary in some 
patients because of diarrhoea. 
In the present application, miglustat, also referred to as N butyl-deoxynojirimycin [AT2221], is 
developed for co-administration with cipaglucosidase alfa (also referred to as ATB200, recombinant 
human acid α-glucosidase [rhGAA]) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease. A capsule 
formulation with a lower strength (65 instead of 100 mg) and a lower total daily dose (195/260 mg 
versus up to 300-600 mg) compared to reference medicinal product has been developed for such 
intended use.

2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: Opfolda is indicated in co-administration with 
cipaglucosidase alfa for use in the long-term treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with a 
confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Pompe disease (also known as acid maltase deficiency or glycogen storage disease [GSD] type II) is a 
rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-
glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme that degrades glycogen.  
The estimated global incidence of Pompe disease is 1:40,000, with variations in incidence reported 
between different ethnic groups (Martiniuk, 1998, Am J Med Genet; Ausems, 1999, Eur J Hum Genet; 
Poorthuis, 1999, Hum Genet; Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited 
Disease). All presentations of Pompe disease are caused by the same underlying deficiency of 
lysosomal GAA. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of Pompe 
disease, and the disease manifests as a broad clinical spectrum with a continuum of clinical signs and 
symptoms (Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today; Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of 
Inherited Disease; van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics; Kishnani, 2004, J Pediatr).  
Pompe disease has been classified into different phenotypes based on age at onset of symptoms, the 
extent of organ involvement, and the rate of progression to death. These phenotypes range from a 
rapidly progressive infantile-onset form of the disease (IOPD, incidence 1:100,000) to a more slowly 
progressing late-onset form (LOPD) with symptom onset any time after infancy through adulthood; 
there is considerable variability and overlap between these two extremes.  
The majority of patients with Pompe disease are classified with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Pompe disease is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Defects in both 
alleles of the gene for GAA, located on chromosome 17q25, result in reduced or absent enzyme 
activity. The deficiency in lysosomal GAA in Pompe disease results in the accumulation of glycogen to a 
variable extent in all muscles of patients with the disorder, leading to impaired contractile function. It 
is hypothesised that rupture of enlarged lysosomes leads to spill-over of lysosomal enzymes into the 
muscle cell cytoplasm, leading to the eventual destruction of the muscle cell with fibrosis and fatty 
replacement as a consequence and progressive dysfunction of portions of muscle or even entire 
muscles. Imaging techniques such as total body MRI have shown that even Pompe disease patients 
who do not appear to have clinical evidence of skeletal muscle involvement may have evidence of fatty 
replacement of parts of their muscles on MRI. T2 imaging can reveal large amounts of fatty infiltration 
with or without (+/-) fibrosis on MRI of their lower limbs, yet patients appear to be walking quite 
normally due to adaptive compensatory mechanisms. 
All presentations of Pompe disease are caused by the same underlying deficiency of lysosomal GAA. 
Currently, over 500 mutations of GAA, including missense, nonsense, splicing defect, and frameshift 
mutations, have been found. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of 
Pompe disease, and the disease manifests as a broad clinical spectrum with a continuum of clinical 
signs and symptoms, depending on the amount of residual enzyme activity (Chen, 2000, Mol Med

Today; Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease; van den Hout, 
2003, Pediatrics; Kishnani, 2004, J Pediatr). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
After infancy the majority of patients with Pompe disease present with late-onset Pompe disease 
(LOPD), which takes a more variable course than infantile-onset Pompe disease (Byrne et al., 2011; 
van der Ploeg et al., 2008). Longer disease duration of between 10-15 years, as well as FVC ≤80% 
predicted, are risk factors for more rapidly progressive disease (van der Beek, 2012, Orphanet J Rare 
Dis), and more than half of LOPD patients will eventually require ventilation after 10-15 years of 
symptomatic disease progression. Initial symptoms of LOPD typically include muscle weakness with a 
limb-girdle distribution, which often manifests as difficulties in climbing stairs, walking, running, and 
rising from a chair or lying position. Shortness of breath and respiratory dysfunction due to the 
involvement of respiratory muscles, fatigue, exercise intolerance, and muscle pain are also common 
and may present at any time in the illness (Müller-Felber et al., 2007; Schüller et al., 2012; van der 
Beek et al., 2009, 2012; Wokke et al., 2008). Over time, progressive loss of muscle strength reduces 
mobility and interferes with the ability to independently complete activities of daily living, including 
toileting and dressing, resulting in decreased quality of life (Hagemans et al., 2004, 2005; Müller-
Felber et al., 2007). Many LOPD patients ultimately end up confined to a wheelchair and require 
ventilation, and LOPD is also associated with increased mortality relative to the general population 
(Güngör et al., 2011). Although Pompe disease manifestations vary between individuals, studies in 
LOPD patients (Ausems et al., 1999) have confirmed that respiratory failure precedes death in nearly 
all subjects. The most common cause of death in patients with Pompe disease, regardless of the age of 
disease onset and/or the severity of skeletal muscle weakness, is respiratory failure (Hirschhorn et al., 
2001; Güngor et al., 2011; Winkel et al., 2005). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, the only treatment option for Pompe disease patients and standard-of-care is long-term 
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Alglucosidase alfa, is globally approved for the treatment of all 
subsets of Pompe disease under the tradenames of Myozyme and Lumizyme. Avalglucosidase alfa 
(Nexviadyme) is also authorised with the same indication in the EU. Enzyme replacement therapy 
substitutes a deficient enzyme by intravenous infusion of the recombinant human enzyme at regular 
intervals. The enzyme is taken up into the cells via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor and transported 
to the lysosome.  
Approval of alglucosidase alfa was based on early clinical trials demonstrating its ability to reduce 
cardiac hypertrophy and prolong invasive ventilator-free survival in infants with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease (IOPD studies ALGLU01602 and ALGLU01702) and to stabilise respiratory function and improve 
walking distance in children and adults with LOPD (study ALGLU02704). 
Studies in LOPD patients suggest that some patients on alglucosidase alfa continue to exhibit some 
decline in respiratory function, albeit at a slower pace than prior to treatment. Responses to treatment 
in LOPD patients vary between individuals, and there might be room for improvement.

2.2.  About the product 
Miglustat (AT2221, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin) is a small-molecule enzyme stabiliser that binds to and 
prevents inactivation of the cipaglucosidase alfa enzyme in the blood, indicated as long-term enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of adults with late-onset Pompe disease (acid 
α-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency). Cipaglucosidase alfa is used in co-administration with miglustat. The 
clinical effectiveness and safety of the monotherapy of cipaglucosidase alfa have not been studied. 
The selective binding between cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat is transient. Dissociation of the 
cipaglucosidase alfa-miglustat bindings occurs in the acidic environment of the lysosome. Based on the 
knowledge of the metabolic pathway leading to the accumulation of glycogen, miglustat cannot be 
considered a substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Miglustat alone has no specific effects on the burden 
of diseases in the group of glycogen storage diseases (for example McArdle, Gieke and Pompe 
disease).  
As the major claimed role of miglustat is the stabilisation of cipaglucosidase alfa in the bloodstream 
and the improvement of the cellular uptake, miglustat is considered an inactive drug constituent of the 
2-component therapy.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment, as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. 
The extent to which the medicinal product is expected to fulfil the unmet medical need is unclear, and 
the strength of evidence does not support a justification of major interest from the point of view of public 
health. Having additional therapeutic options for LOPD patients is valuable, but this is not considered 
sufficient to argue an unmet medical need and accelerated access.  
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical (IUPAC) name of the active substance miglustat is (2R,3R,4R,5S)-1-butyl-2-
(hydroxymethyl) piperidine-3,4,5-triol. It has a relative molecular mass of 219.28 g/mol and the 
structure shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The active substance (AS) was characterised by 1H- and 13C-NMR, IR, Mass Spectrometry, elemental 
analysis, DSC and XRPD Analysis. The obtained spectra are in agreement with the structure of the 
reference standard.  
Miglustat  is  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder,  highly  soluble  in  water,  soluble  in  methanol,  very 
slightly soluble in acetone.  
It has 4 stereocentres which potentially can give rise to 16 different stereoisomers. Three of the chiral 
centres are introduced with the starting material already. The synthetic route applied by the 
manufacturer allows to obtain a single stereoisomer RRRS confirmed by specific optical rotation. The 
structure was confirmed by X-Ray powder diffraction data.  
The AS exists as a single polymorph and no other polymorphs have been observed.  
2.4.2.1.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
In the initial application there was a second ASMF proposed. However, there were major objections 
(MO) raised in relation to the selection of starting materials and the applied control strategy. During 
the procedure, this ASMF was withdrawn by the applicant therefore those MOs were not relevant 
anymore. 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 steps using 2 starting materials. Both are acceptable and 
justified as per ICH Q11, and are controlled by agreed specifications. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail and critical process parameters and 
IPCs have been stated. Critical steps of the manufacturing process have been identified and verified 
during validation. Intermediates are clearly defined and controlled by suitable specifications. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 17/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. In 
general, satisfactory information has been provided regarding the fate of potential genotoxic 
impurities, purging and levels in the final AS (below LoD). 
The manufacturing process has been optimised during development in view of the scale up of the 
process, required for the industrial manufacturing. The introduced changes have been clearly described 
and adequately justified. 
The AS is packaged in double LDPE bag with a desiccant of silica gel, placed inside Al bags and stored 
inside HDPE drums with HDPE lid. The container closure system complies with EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
2.4.2.2.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), 
assay (HPLC-CAD), related substances (HPLC-CAD), trifluoroacetic acid content (HPLC-CAD), residual 
solvents (GC), water content (KF), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), palladium 
content (ICP-MS) and specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.).  
Acceptable justification of specifications has been provided by the finished product (FP) manufacturer, 
in line with ICH Q6A recommendations. Limits for residual solvents, specified, unspecified impurities, 
and residual palladium complies with requirements of ICH Q3C, ICH Q3A or ICH Q3D (R1). Omission of 
certain parameters from the specification has been adequately justified and supported by relevant 
data.. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results for AS batches tested by the FP manufacturer were presented. In addition, 
results from batches tested by the ASMF holder were presented. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.3.  Stability 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification, water content, loss on drying, 
related substances, and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specification limits. 
Photostability  study  has  been  performed  on  one  batch  according  to  the  ICH  Q1B  guideline.  No 
degradation occurred after 48 hours of exposure. 
Furthermore, a stress study has been performed under basic and acidic conditions; oxidative 
conditions; high temperature; exposure of the solution and the powder to sunlight and UV light. The 
study revealed the most significant degrading conditions to be basic and oxidising conditions 
(formation of N-oxide derivate) and demonstrated the related substances method is stability indicating. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 18/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months without 
special storage conditions is acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The FP is an immediate release, hard capsule for oral administration containing 65 mg miglustat. The 
capsules are size 2 with an opaque white body and grey opaque cap containing white to off-white powder. 
“AT2221” is printed with black ink on the capsule body.  
The Opfolda 65 mg hard capsules application was submitted as hybrid marketing authorisation 
application in accordance with Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC with Reference Product Zavesca 
100 mg capsules (centrally authorised product registration) for combined use of miglustat with 
cipaglucosidase alfa for the treatment of Pompe disease. The aim of the pharmaceutical development 
was to develop an immediate release oral dosage form, which contains 65 mg of miglustat as the 
active substance presented in the form of hard capsules.  Different excipients are used in Opfolda in 
comparison with the reference product Zavesca. As Opfolda is developed in different strengths and for 
different indications and dosage regimens compared with reference product Zavesca direct comparison 
of main pharmaceutical characteristics with reference product Zavesca was not considered necessary.  
The development has been performed according to the ICH Q8 using quality by design (QbD) 
approach. The dry blend formulation containing 65 mg of miglustat and widely used excipients 
(microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinised starch, sucralose, magnesium stearate, and colloidal silicon 
dioxide) filled in the size 2, hard gelation capsule shells has been developed. The choice of excipients is 
justified, and their functions are explained. All excipients are compendial with a history of safe use in 
human medicine. There are no novel excipients. The list of excipients is presented in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report.  
The compatibility of the AS and the selected excipients was shown by a relevant study in binary 
mixtures and was further confirmed by FP forced degradation study, long-term and accelerated 
stability studies. 
Except for the capsule shell colour and printing, the same quantitative composition as the intended 
commercial formulation was used throughout Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. The changes 
introduced during development have no impact on dissolution performance and bioavailability; 
therefore, the batches used throughout the clinical development are considered representative for the 
commercial product to be marketed. The FP quality target product profile (QTPP) and critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) of the FP have been evaluated, and an acceptable control strategy has been defined.  
The CQAs that may be affected by the manufacturing process are appearance, identification, assay, 
related substances, content uniformity, dissolution, water content and microbial limits. Microbiological 
studies suggest no potential for microbial growth in the FP formulation. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles to develop the manufacturing process; however, no design 
spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product. The selected 
manufacturing process comprises screening/deagglomeration, blending, encapsulation and packaging. 
Through a risk-based approach, critical and non-critical process parameters have been defined. Their 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 19/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impact on the FP CQAs has been discussed. These CQAs are routinely controlled in accordance with 
specification. Measures to mitigate the risks have been discussed and an updated risk assessment was 
presented. Parameters that were assessed as non critical will still be monitored and assessed 
throughout the commercial lifecycle of the product. During manufacturing, critical process parameters 
are maintained within established ranges determined by the applicable proven acceptable ranges or 
parameter setpoints. 
During development the physicochemical characteristics of the AS, such as high aqueous solubility, 
hygroscopic properties, stability, particle size, polymorphism and biopharmaceutical class has been 
taken into consideration. The AS is classified as BCS Class I/III, hence the dissolution rate is not 
considered as a high risk factor. 
Dissolution data showed that the FP dissolves rapidly (>80% in 15 minutes) in the physiological range. 
Lack of discriminative power for dissolution method has been justified based on the requirements of 
ICH Q6A Decision Tree #7 as it was demonstrated that dissolution does not affect bioavailability and 
changes in formulation and manufacturing variables do not affect dissolution in media over the range 
pH 1 – 6.8. 
The container closure system is high density polyethylene (HDPE) 40 cc bottles, closed with induction 
sealed, polypropylene child resistant closure. The choice of packaging materials is properly justified.  
Moisture vapor permeation and light transmission tests on the bottles were evaluated. The container 
closure systems meet requirements of the EC Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and 
articles intended to come into contact with food. The risk of interaction between packaging components 
and a solid oral dosage form is considered low. The suitability of the container closure system for 
commercial use and compatibility of the container closure system with the finished product is 
demonstrated with satisfactory stability data provided. Compliance of the child resistant closure with 
ISO standard 8317:2015 is confirmed. Two pack sizes are proposed with 4 and 24 capsules. 
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing sites involved in the finished product manufacturing process have been stated and 
their GMP status has been confirmed.  
The FP manufacturing process can be considered a standard process comprising a dry mixing process 
followed by encapsulation.  
Manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail. The process parameters that have been 
identified  during  development  studies  as  critical,  non-critical  are  controlled  during  the  manufacturing 
process in ranges or set points.  
The proposed blend hold time prior to encapsulation has been supported by an appropriate study. For 
bulk capsules the proposed hold time prior to packaging has been supported by relevant stability data 
and is thus acceptable . The CHMP requested and the applicant committed to provide additional 
stability data on another batch post approval (REC). The container closure system of bulk capsules has 
been described and compliance to EC Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 is confirmed for bulk packaging. 
Although the manufacturing process is standard for this type of dosage form, process validation study 
has been conducted on three commercial scale batches. The results comply with the acceptance 
criteria; it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 20/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The commercial batch size has been stated. Opfolda has orphan status; therefore the proposed 
commercial batch size is considered justified in accordance with EMA/CHMP/QWP/245074/2015 
Guideline on manufacture of the finished dosage form.   
2.4.3.2.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance (visual), identification (TLC, HPLC), assay (HPLC-CAD), content uniformity 
(Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC-CAD), related substances (HPLC-CAD), water content (Ph. Eur.), limit of 
nitrosamines (LC-MS/MS) and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed specification follows the ICH guidelines Q6A, Q3B and Ph. Eur. and reflects common 
quality specifications for this type of product (capsules). An acceptable justification of each 
specification parameter was provided. 
The impurity limits were set as per the ICH Q3B taking into account the maximum daily dose following 
the SmPC is 260 mg and are, therefore, acceptable. 
The dissolution acceptance criterion was set based on the historical performance of the product across 
the development program, including dissolution profiles at release and on stability. The dissolution rate 
is not considered as a high-risk factor. Some variability in dissolution results observed during stability 
studies has been satisfactorily discussed. The selected dissolution method is considered adequate. 
Furthermore, from in-vivo clinical performance data for the corresponding batches it was concluded 
that both batches were acceptable from Cmax and AUC perspective. Considering the overall information, 
the dissolution limit is considered to be in-line with the principles described in the guidance document 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017 and, therefore, is accepted. 
An elemental impurities (EIs) risk assessment was performed on the FP. The risk assessment was 
performed in line with the ICH Q3D(R1) guideline in batches of FP by a validated method. Based on the 
obtained results the applicant concludes that the tested elements are below 25% of the Option 1 limits.  
The submitted discussion on elemental impurities is considered sufficient and it is agreed that routine 
testing of FP for elemental impurities is not required.   
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed. However the provided documentation was incomplete and a MO was raised by the CHMP on 
nitrosamine testing. 
In response to the MO, the company presented a validated method for the control of these impurities. 
The calculated limits for each nitrosamine impurity and the limit for total impurities are acceptable 
considering the acceptable intakes (AI) and maximum daily dose. Considering the above stated and on 
risk-based approach the absence of the control of nitrosamines in the shelf-life specification is 
accepted.  
In addition, in the updated risk evaluation submitted in response to the MO, a risk for potential 
formation of nitrosamine impurities was identified. The theoretical chemical pathway for N-nitrosation 
process of active substance and its impurities were provided; two possible nitrosamines were 
identified.  
The applicant has conducted a structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis for chemistry, 
mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity risk assessments concerning the potential presence of above-
mentioned nitrosamine impurities. The SAR approach was described, including the surrogate selection 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 21/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
process, and calculations of the acceptable intake (AI) and AI limit. The proposed AI limit is based on 
EMA/409815/2020 Rev. 14, Question 10 and on the maximum daily dose of 260 mg. The provided 
information is acknowledged, however, the acceptable intake based on SAR approach would normally 
have to be reviewed and adopted by the NCWP. 
Nevertheless, the applicant has developed and validated a new highly sensitive test method that is 
able to detect and quantify these two nitrosamines. The proposed approach is considered acceptable. 
The method specificity has been shown. Furthermore, an acceptable detection (LoD) and quantitation 
limits (QL) have been demonstrated. The achieved QL is far below the 10% AI limit by SAR approach, 
but importantly, it is also 10% of the AI limit that is derived from the default class specific TTC/AI of 
18 ng/day (based on MDD of 260 mg).  
In addition the confirmatory testing of three finished product batches by the validated method has 
been performed as requested.  
Since it is demonstrated that the presence of the potential nitrosamines is consistently below 10% of 
the acceptable limit based on AI of 18 ng/ml in the finished product, it can be concluded that intake of 
N-nitrosamine impurities does not exceed the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of 18 ng / day in 
the finished product. Based on provided assessment it can be concluded that there is no risk of active 
substance-related nitrosamines formation, and a test for these nitrosamines can be omitted from the 
specification. 
Overall, the MO has been resolved; the updated risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine 
impurities is considered acceptable and is in-line with the Questions and answers for marketing 
authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020 Rev 
14). 
The analytical methods for all test parameters in the specification have been described in detail. 
Validations of in-house methods have been performed in accordance with ICH Q2 (R1) guideline. 
Stability indicating properties of the HPLC method used to determine assay and impurities was 
demonstrated by forced degradation studies. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analyses are provided for three commercial scale batches. All results are within the limits of the 
proposed specification. Batch analysis results confirm the consistency and uniformity of the product.  
2.4.3.3.  Stability of the product 
Stability studies are performed on 3 commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed 
commercial site using the commercial formulation and manufacturing process, and packaged in the 
same container closure system as proposed for marketing.  
Samples were stored for 12 months under long term storage at 30°C /75% RH, and for 6 months 
accelerated storage conditions 4 °C /75% RH. It is noted that for long-term testing, the applicant uses 
more stringent humidity conditions such as 30°C /75% RH compared to long-term storage conditions 
30°C /65% RH required by the ICH Q1A; such an approach is considered acceptable. The frequency of 
testing was in-line with the ICH Q1A requirements.  
In addition, stability data was provided for another 3 batches manufactured at the same site according 
to the same process but packed in different colour capsules. The difference in composition between the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 22/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different capsule shells are negligible, and the impact on the stability due to the change of capsule 
colour is minimal. Thus, it is agreed that these batches are considered representative of the 
commercial product and may be used for FP stability evaluation. These batches, were stored for up to 
36 months at 30°C /65% RH (2 batches) and for 6 months at 40°C /75% RH, in-line with the ICH Q1A 
requirements. 
All results meet specification criteria at all tested conditions. A slight increase in water content was 
observed during storage. There is no trend that dissolution profile changes over time in any of the 
stability studies, but variability from time point to time point is observed in some batches as discussed 
previously. No other trends were observed in any of the parameters for any of the batches. The 
specifications and test methods (assay/related substances by HPLC/CAD) have changed during stability 
studies but details were described, and a comparison of methods was provided.  
A photostability study in-line with ICH Q1B has been performed using on one batch. Based on the 
study results, it is demonstrated that Opfolda capsules are not sensitive to light and therefore no 
special precautions for storage are needed.  
An in-use stability study was performed on one batch. The study design simulates the posology 
described in SmPC. The drug product demonstrates good stability in long-term and accelerated 
conditions; there are no signs that the FP might be susceptible to deterioration. According to the EMA 
Quality Q&A, in such cases, in-use stability studies do not need to be undertaken. Also, the performed 
in-use study of one batch does not show significant changes . According to the EMA Quality Q&A, since 
no relevant deterioration is observed, no in-use shelf life should be set in the SmPC. 
Based  on  provided  stability  data,  the  proposed  36  months  shelf-life  without  any  special  storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
2.4.3.4.  Adventitious agents 
The gelatin used in the hard gelatin capsule shells is of animal origin. Valid certificates of Suitability 
granted by the EDQM for demonstrating TSE compliance for gelatin used in the production of the hard 
capsules have been provided. Gelatin complies with the current “Note for Guidance on minimizing the 
risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal 
products (EMEA/410/01 rev. 3).” 
There are no other excipients of human or animal origin. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The MOs raised during the procedure in relation to the selection of starting materials and the control 
strategy applied by one of the ASMF holders were resolved, as the ASMF was withdrawn by the applicant. 
The MO raised during the procedure regarding the risk of nitrosamines impurities formation and their 
control strategy has been resolved by provision of additional information and suitable updating of the 
risk assessment required by the relevant guidance documents.  
The FP manufacturer applied quality by design (QbD) concepts to develop the medicinal product however, 
no design-space is claimed. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023

The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no

2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
 - the applicant commits to perform a finished product bulk hold time study on one additional batch 
and submitted the results by 4Q 2023. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical dossier relies on the results of preclinical data from a reference medicinal product 
and/or  applicant’s own non-clinical data to support the intended use of miglustat in co-administration 
with cipaglucosidase alfa for the treatment of Pompe disease. Since the applicant has obtained a right-
of-reference from the MAH for Zavesca to permit access to the product’s data, cross references to 
relevant non-clinical data of the reference medicinal product are made below. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies evaluating binding kinetics were conducted by the applicant. Cipaglucosidase alfa binds 
with sub-nanomolar (Kd=0.9nM) affinity to its target, CI-MPR, at physiological pH. Under acidic 
conditions encountered in the endosome, cipaglucosidase alfa dissociates from CI-MPR. A Kd could 
therefore not be determined. The binding of miglustat to cipaglucosidase alfa was tested at neutral pH 
in PBS, plasma or whole human blood and in acidic pH buffer with varying miglustat concentrations by 
rapid equilibrium dialysis. Miglustat bound cipaglucosidase alfa in diluted plasma with an estimated Kd 
of 10.51 ± 2.25 μM and in diluted whole blood at approximately 15.05 ± 7.05 μM. Similar results were 
obtained in PBS. Miglustat binding increased stability of cipaglucosidase alfa and reduce irreversible

enzyme inactivation in blood as demonstrated in a thermostability study. This complex is then likely 
taken up by cells where miglustat dissociates from cipaglucosidase alfa. 
In denaturation experiments, cipaglucosidase alfa was more stable in acidic pH than at physiological 
pH, which could be dose-dependently stabilised by co-incubation with miglustat providing evidence of 
the added benefit of miglustat co-administration. In whole blood, cipaglucosidase alfa retained its 
activity for longer by coincubation with increasing concentrations of miglustat up to 170µM.  
To evaluate the performance of cipaglucosidase alfa in an in vivo setting, cipaglucosidase alfa was 
administered to GAA knockout mice after incubating the formulation at room temperature for 4 hours 
alone or with miglustat. Cipaglucosidase alfa exposure was moderately increased (67µmol/ml/hr.hr vs. 
74µmol/ml/hr.hr, respectively). The co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat showed a 
trend toward increased glycogen reduction but was not statistically significant compared to 
cipaglucosidase alfa alone, although compared to vehicle there was a statistically significant trend of 
further glycogen reduction over administration of cipaglucosidase alfa alone.  
Co-administration of miglustat improved efficacy of 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa but not 10 mg/kg. 
Compared to alglucosidase alfa alone, combined administration resulted in 2.8- and 2.3-fold greater 
glycogen reduction in the quadriceps and triceps, respectively. Increasing the dose of miglustat did not 
improve GAA activity, which was considered suggestive of inhibition of cipaglucosidase alfa efficacy 
through unknown mechanisms. Anti-drug antibody titers were comparable in all test-article groups, 
which does not suggest a lower immunogenic profile for either cipaglucosidase alfa or the combination 
compared to alglucosidase alfa. Investigations of dose refinement showed that in GAA knockout mice, 
lower doses of cipaglucosidase alfa resulted in significantly greater glycogen reduction compared to 
alglucosidase alfa, indicating improved potency and efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa.  
In a pivotal proof of concept study, the effect of GAA activity after 4 or 6 repeated biweekly (every 
other week) administrations of alglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) or cipaglucosidase alfa (10 or 20 mg/kg) 
with or without coadministration of miglustat (20 or 30 mg/kg) was evaluated in GAA knockout mice. 
Cipaglucosidase alfa dose-dependently reduced glycogen levels in muscle, which was significantly 
greater (up to 1.8x in skeletal muscle) compared to alglucosidase alfa and did so at comparatively 
lower exposures. However, GAA activity was overall not significantly improved compared to 
alglucosidase alfa at any dose or combination. Furthermore, these differences more or less plateaued 
after 4-weeks, after which the efficacy of alglucosidase alfa approached but did not meet that of 
cipaglucosidase alfa. This was particularly noted in heart tissue. Extended administration did not 
further improve glycogen turnover. Thus, while proof of concept has been demonstrated that 
coadministration of miglustat and cipaglucosidase alfa may result in better clearance of glycogen, its 
superiority over alglucosidase alfa has only been demonstrated on a biochemical level.  
Further histopathological and functional evaluations have been performed with cipaglucosidase alfa. 
Histological evaluation showed that administration with cipaglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) also reduced 
upregulation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), which is associated with lysosome 
proliferation and impaired muscle physiology. This reduction was independent of the target tissue 
being slow- or fast-twitch fibres, whereas alglucosidase alfa did not modulate LAMP1 in fast-twitch 
fibres. Decreases in LAMP1 were further attenuated after co-administration of miglustat. Muscles 
responsive to cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat administration included quadriceps and diaphragm, 
two key skeletal muscles that are composed predominantly of type II fibres. Finally, the co-
administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat also significantly reduced autophagy markers LC3A 
II and p62, suggesting autophagy can be reversed in Pompe disease. A study evaluating lysosome 
proliferation and autophagy in the quadriceps of GAA KO mice showed a reduction of LAMP and LC3

after co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. Clearance of autophagic build-up and 
restoration of muscle architecture was noted in the white gastrocnemius, further suggesting a reversal 
of muscle damage in Pompe disease. 
Long-term administration (12 biweekly administrations) using alglucosidase alfa alone, cipaglucosidase 
alfa or its co-administration with miglustat in GAA knockout mice animals showed increased GAA 
activity and glycogen turnover, decreased lysosomal proliferation and autophagy and improved muscle 
repair mechanisms for the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. Cipaglucosidase alfa 
alone or its co-administration with miglustat was statistically significantly better in lowering glycogen in 
tissue compared to alglucosidase alfa alone. Co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat 
increased GAA activity, but this did not necessarily lead to improved biochemical parameters compared 
to administration of cipaglucosidase alfa alone. Furthermore, the improved biochemical profile in these 
animals did not lead to statistically significant changes compared to alglucosidase alone in a wire hang 
study. However, performance in the cipaglucosidase alfa and cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment 
groups tended to maintain latency vs vehicle-treated animals. Similarly, there was no difference in 
improvement in grip strength with cipaglucosidase alfa compared to alglucosidase alfa test group 
animals whereas for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment group, statistically significant 
improvement over alglucosidase alfa was noted. While cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment has 
demonstrably improved GAA activity and histopathological modulation of the Pompe phenotype, its 
functional effect over administration of alglucosidase alfa appears to be modest. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Miglustat was tested for its inhibitory activity against selected key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism: 
Isolated α-glucosidase from porcine liver, ß-glucosidase from almond and hexokinase from yeast. Ki’s 
for miglustat were 0.22 μM for α-glucosidase and 1125 μM for ß-glucosidase. Miglustat did not inhibit 
hexokinase.  
Fetal fibroblast and/or peritoneal macrophages were incubated for different periods of time with or 
without a dose dependent concentration of miglustat (up to 6 mg/ml). After the pre-incubation period, 
the cells were stimulated with bradykinin, ionophore and arachidonic acid to determine the effect of the 
compound on receptor-mediated vs receptor-independent release of PGE2. PGE2 was measured by 
available radio-immunoassays. Miglustat did not inhibit PGE2 synthesis. Hence, it was concluded that 
miglustat should not demonstrate any anti-inflammatory activity. 
Miglustat does not inhibit key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nor is it likely that 
miglustat will have anti-inflammatory activity.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
An in vitro GLP study was completed to determine the potential proarrhythmic effect of miglustat. The 
in vitro effects of AT2221 on ionic currents in voltage-clamped human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-
293) that stably express the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) were determined. Two 
concentrations of AT2221 (100 μM and 1000 μM) were tested at near-physiological temperature. 
AT2221 inhibited hERG current by (Mean ± SEM; n = 3) -3.1 ± 1.1% at 100 μM and -3.4 ± 2.2% at 
1000 μM versus 1.1 ± 1.2% in control. hERG inhibition at 100 μM and 1000 μM were not statistically 
significant when compared to vehicle control values. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of AT2221 on 
hERG potassium current was not calculated but was estimated to be greater than 1000 μM.

The positive control article terfenadine inhibited hERG potassium current by (Mean ± SD; n = 2) 88.9 
± 2.4% at 60 nM.  
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No new studies have been conducted and this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A short overview of all pharmacokinetics studies performed with miglustat was submitted. These 
studies involved single-dose administration of miglustat in wild-type and Gaa KO mice, as well as 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
Validation reports for the analytical methods used, demonstrating the suitability of the methods, 
storage and handling for the purpose of analysis of miglustat were submitted. Specific and sensitive 
bioanalytical assays were developed and validated for the quantitative determination of miglustat in 
rat, rabbit and monkey plasma. These methods utilised a solid-phase extraction procedure, followed by 
liquid chromatography (together with internal standard) using reversed-phase chromatography and 
subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis in the positive ESI-MRM mode. 
Absorption 
The absorption of miglustat was studied in wild-type and Gaa KO mice, as well as in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Wild-type mice were dosed orally with 0, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg miglustat, which resulted in fast 
absorption, with tmax values ≤0.4 hours. Cmax and AUC values showed dose-proportional increases. 
Finally, the mean plasma t½ of miglustat was quite short following oral administration for all doses 
tested (≤0.5 hours). 
The plasma PK profile of miglustat was also evaluated following co-administration with cipaglucosidase 
alfa in Gaa KO mice. These mice were dosed with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa intravenously and  
0, 10 and 30 mg/kg miglustat orally. The plasma t1/2 values obtained from this study were similar to 
the half-life obtained in the wild type mice dosed with miglustat only, with t1/2 values of ≤0.6 hours for 
miglustat upon co-administration with cipaglucosidase alfa.  
In cynomolgus monkeys dosed orally with 25, 250 and 1000 mg/kg miglustat, Cmax and AUC values 
increased in a less-than dose-proportional manner, although emesis for the 250 and 1000 mg/kg 
groups could bias this observation. Absorption was fast, with tmax for all three groups observed from  
1.0 to 1.5 hours. The plasma half-life observed for the various dosing groups ranged from 3.9-5.4 
hours, indicating a longer half-life of miglustat in monkeys compared to mice. 
Distribution 
Distribution was studied in C57BL/6 wild-type mice dosed orally with 10 and 30 mg/kg miglustat, and 
tissue PK was assessed using quadriceps muscle. The maximum concentrations were observed after 
0.45 and 0.90 hours, indicating fast distribution to muscle tissue. The exposure to miglustat increased 
linearly with an increase in dose for both Cmax and AUC values. The tissue t1/2 was calculated at 1.4 
hours for 10 mg/kg dose and at 1.2 hours for 30 mg/kg dose, indicating increased half-life in muscle 
when compared to plasma, instead of the 24 hours reported in the non-clinical overview.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No new studies have been conducted and this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In a three-month repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey, the co-administration of 
cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat was investigated up to 100/175 mg/kg, respectively. No adverse 
effects were noted by combination exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. At the highest doses 
of cipaglucosidase alfa/ miglustat tested, the exposure margin for two selected peptide fragments was 
11 (male) and 8 (female) and the exposure margin for miglustat was 9 (male) and 11 (female) fold, 
both compared to exposure in human at MRHD. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No new studies have been conducted and this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No new studies have been conducted and this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
All reproductive toxicology exposure margins were calculated by correcting the exposure obtained in 
the animal studies (with dosing every other day and AUC values reported of 0-48 hours) for the dosing 
regimen in the human situation (dosing every other week and AUC values reported of 0-336 hours). 
Consequently, 7-fold lower exposure margins will be obtained in case of comparing exposure during 
the first 24 hours after dosing, during which the majority of the exposure takes place, based on the 
very short half-life of cipaglucosidase alfa in rats, rabbits and humans.  
In a FEED study in rats, cipaglucosidase alfa did not have an adverse effect on female or male fertility 
up to an exposure margin of 183- and 263-fold exposure at MRHD, respectively. 
In treated female rats, preimplantation loss was significantly increased following treatment with either 
60 mg/kg miglustat alone (21.6%) or 60 mg/kg miglustat in combination with 400 mg/kg 
cipaglucosidase alfa (21.4%) compared to the control group (9.6%).

Cipaglucosidase alfa was found to be negative for embryo-foetal developmental toxicity in rat and 
rabbit up to an exposure margin of 129 and 55-fold exposure at MRHD, respectively. In addition, 
miglustat and cipaglucosidase alfa + miglustat were tested in both the rat and rabbit. The addition of 
miglustat did not change the outcome in rat EFD (miglustat exposure margin of 29-fold). However, in 
the rabbit EFD toxicity study, a significant increase in cardiovascular malformations was observed in 
the cipaglucosidase alfa + miglustat treatment groups, including increases in the atretic pulmonary 
trunk (4 of litters/6 foetuses), ventricular septum defect (5 litters/7 foetuses), dilated aortic arch (5 
litters / 13 foetuses), malpositioned atrium (litter 1 / foetuses 2), dextrocardia (litter 2 / foetuses 2) 
three-chambered heart (litter 2/ foetuses 3) and large ventricles (l litter 2/ foetal 3). The exposure 
level at which these miglustat-induced effects were observed was 22-fold exposure at MRHD. In the 
pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study, no adverse findings on F0 and F1 were observed with 
QOD cipaglucosidase alfa treatment alone, up to 129-fold exposure at MRHD.  
The co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat increased maternal mortality, as was 
observed in the rat reproductive toxicity studies, together with a small non-significant increase in total 
litter loss (n=3, DHP control n=1). Other postnatal pup survival values were also not significantly 
altered and were within the historical control range. In addition, based on the elevation in maternal 
mortality, decreased maternal activity, and slightly increased incidence of pups with no milk in the 
stomach at necropsy, the slight increase in total litter loss in the combination group can be considered 
due to maternal neglect of the pups. In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment group, a decrease 
in pup weight was observed on PND 14 and PND 21, which correlated with the signs of maternal 
neglect and no milk present in the stomach of pups.  
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic studies for miglustat were performed in monkeys in a repeated-dose study. 
Cynomolgus monkeys were dosed orally every other week up to 13 weeks with up to 175 mg/kg 
miglustat in the presence or absence of 100 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa (intravenously administered). 
There was no consistent effect of animal gender on miglustat TK parameters. The tmax ranged from 
approximately 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Miglustat exposure increased with doses between 25 and 175 
mg/kg. The mean t1/2 (males and females combined) was consistent on Days 1 and 85 and ranged 
from 6.7 to 8.2 hours. Little to no accumulation was observed with repeated once every other week 
oral administration. There was no observable effect of cipaglucosidase alfa co-administration on overall 
miglustat exposure (i.e., AUC0-t) or other TK parameters. The exposure multiples for miglustat 
monotherapy were ~10 for male and female, indicating sufficient exposure for toxicity testing. Co-
administration resulted in similar or slightly higher exposure multiples. 
Toxicokinetics were also performed as part of reproduction-toxicology studies. In a FEED study using 
rats that were dosed every other day with 60 mg/kg miglustat in the presence or absence of 400 
mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa, there was no evidence for accumulation in both the males (dosed up to 
day 28) and females (dosed up to GD7), based on AUC values. Also, there were no differences 
between the exposure of both sexes after day 1 dosing. The exposure multiples for miglustat 
monotherapy were ~9 and ~11 for male and female, respectively, indicating sufficient exposure for 
toxicity testing. Co-medication resulted in significantly higher exposure multiples. 
Two EFD were performed, using rat and rabbit. In the rat EFD study, female rats were dosed with 60 
mg/kg miglustat in the presence or absence of 400 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa. No accumulation of 
miglustat was observed after multiple doses in both groups. Co-administration with cipaglucosidase

alfa resulted in ~2-2.5-fold higher AUC0-24 values when compared to miglustat monotherapy on GD 6 
and 18. The exposure multiple for the monotherapy and co-administration groups were ~14 and ~29, 
respectively, indicating sufficient exposure for toxicity testing. In the rabbit EFD study, female rabbits 
were dosed with 25 mg/kg miglustat in the presence or absence of 175 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa. No 
accumulation of miglustat was observed after multiple doses in pregnant rabbits. The mean Cmax and 
AUC0-24 values for miglustat were slightly higher in the co-administration group as compared to the 
miglustat monotherapy group, with differences of less than 2-fold. The exposure multiple for the 
monotherapy and co-administration groups were ~13 and ~22, respectively, indicating sufficient 
exposure for toxicity testing. 
Furthermore, the single-dose pharmacokinetic behaviour of miglustat was studied in mice and 
monkeys as an interspecies comparison. Based on the data, the half-life of miglustat ranged from 0.2-
0.6 hours in mice to 3.9-5.4 hours in the monkey. Absorption was fast, ranging from 0.3-0.4 hours in 
mice to 1-1.5 hours in the monkey. No accumulation was also observed upon multiple-dosing for any 
of the species used for PK (mice and monkey) and toxicology (rat and rabbit) studies.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Together with binding kinetics data evaluating the affinity of cipaglucosidase alfa to the CI-MPR 
receptor and the affinity of miglustat to cipaglucosidase alfa, the submitted pharmacology data 
sufficiently demonstrate the mode of action and proof of concept of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat 
co- administration.

Miglustat does not inhibit key enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nor is it likely that 
miglustat will have anti-inflammatory activity.  
Miglustat did not show any potential to inhibit the hERG channel at the tested concentrations.  
Despite the absence of a rationale for the choice of miglustat as co-administration with cipaglucosidase 
alfa, its binding appears to increase stability of cipaglucosidase alfa and reduce irreversible enzyme 
inactivation in blood as demonstrated in a thermostability study. The complex cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat is thought to be likely taken up by the cells where miglustat dissociates from 
cipaglucosidase alfa. The high concentration of glycogen accumulated in lysosomes of Pompe patients 
is expected to outcompete miglustat binding for cipaglucosidase alfa, leaving cipaglucosidase alfa fully 
available for glycogen hydrolysis.  
The studies suggested that administration of cipaglucosidase alfa results in a dose-dependent increase 
in GAA activity in disease-relevant tissues (including quadriceps, triceps, gastrocnemius, and heart), 
leading to increased glycogen turnover, which was generally further improved with miglustat. Further 
long-term studies also showed improved histopathological muscle repair in animals when 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat are co-administered. 
Despite this, long-term administration of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat did not necessarily improve 
biochemical parameters compared to administration of cipaglucosidase alfa alone. In addition, whilst 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment has demonstrated improved GAA activity and 
histopathological modulation of the Pompe phenotype, its functional effect over administration of 
alglucosidase alfa appeared to be modest. With inconsistent effect on glycogen turnover in all 
investigated muscle types and the lack of improved physiological outcome measures, an efficacy claim 
of superiority over alglucosidase alfa cannot be justified from a non-clinical perspective. 
In general, the effect of co-administration of miglustat with cipaglucosidase alfa resulted in only 
modest increases in cipaglucosidase alfa exposure in mice and rats, whereas the effect was more 
pronounced in the monkey. Co-administration of 10 mg/kg miglustat with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase 
alfa demonstrated a trend of increased GAA activity in skeletal muscle (quadriceps and triceps), but 
not in the heart.  
In monkeys, miglustat increased cipaglucosidase alfa plasma exposure approximately by ~2-fold 
compared to cipaglucosidase alfa alone. During the procedure, the applicant sufficiently justified that 
this finding would unlikely impact on the safety profile in clinical setting. 
Both rat and monkey showed distribution-phase half-life values ranging from ~2-4 hours. The 
elimination-phase half-life values were higher for both species, ranging from 6-8 hours for the rat, and 
3-7 hours for the monkey, although the higher values observed are probably caused by the presence 
of measurable concentrations after 168 hours in a few animals. As expected, little to no accumulation 
was observed for both species. Presence of miglustat showed different effects in rat and monkey. 
Whereas there was no or only a small increase in half-life of cipaglucosidase alfa in rats, monkeys did 
show an increase in half-life in the presence of miglustat by ~50-100%, as observed for distribution-
phase half-life. However, a small or no effect on cipaglucosidase alfa half-life in Gaa KO mice was 
reported in the presence of miglustat, leading to similar or slightly higher exposures for miglustat co-
administration groups. Altogether, the comparative data across species did not reveal any particular 
concerns for the CHMP. 
A FEED study in rats revealed no effects on male fertility. However, an increased incidence of 
preimplantation loss was observed in female rats treated with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat. As this 
CHMP assessment report

only occurred in the miglustat (co)-treated groups, this adverse effect is considered related to 
miglustat treatment. In the cipaglucosidase alfa + miglustat treatment group, miglustat exposure was 
33 (M), and 30 (F) fold exposure at MRHD. Based on these results indicating a potential risk for 
decreased fertility and/or pregnancy loss in women taking miglustat prior to and during pregnancy, the 
following information is included in section 4.6 of the SmPC “Animal studies with miglustat alone as 
well as with cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat have shown reproductive toxicity, see section 5.3. 
Pombiliti in combination with miglustat therapy is not recommended during pregnancy and in women 
of childbearing potential not using contraception.”  
Cipaglucosidase alfa was found to be negative for EFD toxicity in rat and rabbit up to an exposure 
margin of 129- and 55-fold exposure at MRHD, respectively. However, in the rabbit EFD toxicity study, 
a significant increase in cardiovascular malformations was observed in the cipaglucosidase alfa + 
miglustat treatment groups. Such findings were not observed in the cipaglucosidase alfa groups nor in 
the groups treated with 60 mg/kg miglustat alone. Based on the reported occurrence of cardiovascular 
malformations and variations in rabbits following exposure during organogenesis to the co-
administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat, the following statement is included in section 5.3 
of the SmPC: “The combination of cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat resulted in increased 
cardiovascular malformations (aortic pulmonary trunk, ventricular septum defect, and dilated aortic 
arch) in rabbits”. 
In the pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity study, no adverse findings on F0 and F1 were 
observed with QOD cipaglucosidase alfa treatment alone, up to 129-fold exposure at MRHD.  
In rats, the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat (EM 29-fold) increased maternal 
mortality, and a small non-significant increase in total litter loss was observed. Together with these 
findings, decreased maternal activity, and slightly increased incidence of pups with no milk in the 
stomach at necropsy were reported indicating that the slight increase in total litter loss in the 
combination group could be considered due to maternal neglect of the pups. In particular, in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment group, a decrease in pup weight was observed on PND 14 and 
PND 21 and correlated with the signs of maternal neglect and no milk present in the stomach of pups. 
Miglustat PECsurfacewater is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and miglustat is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5.  
Therefore, miglustat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic data of cipaglucosidase alfa (and miglustat) in adult Pompe disease patients were 
obtained from the 3 clinical studies (ATB200-02, ATB200-03 and AT2221-01). A PopPK analysis was 
conducted using available alglucosidase alfa, cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat plasma concentration 
data pooled from studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-03 to characterise the pharmacokinetics and to 
evaluate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on pharmacokinetics.  
For the quantification of GAA activity in plasma samples and the establishment of the specific activity, 
a validated enzymatic activity method was applied using fluorescent molecule 4-methylumbelliferone 
(4MU) reaction product.  
For the analysis of total anti-cipaglucosidase alfa antibodies in plasma, immunogenicity was monitored 
using validated ADA assays and followed a tiered bioanalysis approach of screening, confirmation, and 
titration. Immunogenicity was assessed using a validated electrochemiluminescent assay to screen 
samples for ADAs.  
Anti-drug antibody-positive samples identified with the ADA assay were further evaluated for the 
presence of NAbs, which decreases drug activity and signal. The methods were validated and showed 
acceptable performance.  
Additional blood samples were collected for the evaluation of cipaglucosidase alfa immunoglobulin E 
(IgE). IgE antibodies against cipaglucosidase alfa were quantified using a validated fluoroenzyme 
immunoassay.  
Glucose tetrasaccharide (Hex4) in the urinary was analysed by a validated UPLC method with MS 
detection.  
For the analysis of miglustat in plasma and urine, validated LC-MS/MS methods were applied.  
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No BCS based biowaiver has been applied for, nor a bioequivalence study was submitted. Instead, 
pharmacokinetic data after a single dose is compared between Opfolda (65 mg capsule) and Zavesca 
(100 mg capsule) to bridge to the general pharmacokinetics properties obtained for miglustat from 
Zavesca. Dose normalised data indicate that the pharmacokinetics are comparable after administration 
of Opfolda and Zavesca. However this was based on absolute values only, and therefore 
ranges/confidence intervals were requested to further support the bridging to the reference medicinal 
product. Comparing different studies and using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the dose-
normalised Cmax and AUC, data showed that both formulations can be considered bioequivalent. Next 
to this bridging, specific pharmacokinetic data is obtained for Opfolda co-administered with 
cipaglucosidase alfa in patients with Pompe disease. 
A popPK analysis was made in order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of miglustat when 
administered with cipaglucosidase alfa. For plasma miglustat, a 2-compartment popPK model provided 
the best and most parsimonious fit to the data. The base (and final) model was parameterised in terms 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 36/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of CL/F, apparent intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F), 
and apparent peripheral volume of distribution (V3/F). The oral absorption phase in the base model 
was characterised with a sequential zero- and first-order absorption model, where there was a zero-
order input into the depot (dosing compartment) followed by first-order absorption into the central 
compartment. The model was parameterised in terms of absorption rate constant (ka) and duration of 
zero-order absorption (D1). The base (and final) model included a shared estimated weight effect on 
CL/F and Q/F and a shared estimated weight effect on V2/F and V3/F.  
The final miglustat PK model expanded the base model to include covariate effects. As with the base 
model, the final model included a shared estimated weight effect on CL/F and Q/F, and a shared 
estimated weight effect on V2/F and V3/F. Additionally, the effects of age, race (ie, Asian versus non-
Asian), sex (male versus female), and ERT history (naïve versus experienced) were estimated on CL/F. 
The final model resulted in acceptable fixed effect parameters estimates and random effect parameter 
estimates with acceptable Shrinkage. GOF plots were also acceptable without any major trends and the 
pcVPCs demonstrated that model-predicted miglustat concentrations were in reasonable agreement 
with observed concentrations. The median and 5th/95th percentiles of the observed data were in close 
agreement with the distributions summarised from 500 simulated replicates for all treatment groups. 
Overall, the method seems generally acceptable. Only data from study ABT200-03 and study ATB200-
02 was used. 
Body weight, age and race appeared to affect miglustat PK. The popPK analysis predicted a higher 
Vss/F and Cl/F (500 l and 5.7 l/h) compared to non-compartmental analysis (100 l and 11 l/h, 
respectively). Furthermore, only data were included from patients and not from healthy subjects. This 
should be clarified and justified, considering an update of the model. In a further justification it was 
shown that the model predicted the non-compartmental data from study ATB200-02 sufficiently, but 
that due to inclusion of data from study ATB200-03 it resulted in the shift in Vd and CL/F, which may 
be due to the numerical more data included from study ATB200-03 compared to study ATB200-2. This 
seems plausible. Furthermore, data from patients were retrieved already from dense sampling data, 
and it was considered that adding the healthy subject data would not have a relevant contribution, 
which can be agreed. 
Co-administration of miglustat reduced cipaglucosidase alfa linear clearance by approximately 26% for 
the 130 mg dose and by 37% for > 130 mg doses (mainly 260 mg). Co-administration of miglustat 
increased cipaglucosidase alfa AUC by approximately 22% for the 130 mg dose and by 35% for > 130 
mg dose. 
Immunogenicity markers did not have an obvious impact on miglustat PK disposition. 
Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability after oral administration of miglustat has not been determined. Maximum 
plasma concentrations are reached about 3 hours after dosing. 
The 100 mg capsule with a standard high fat meal decreased Cmax by 36% and AUC by 14%. Food 
delayed tmax by 2 hours.  
At the clinical dose, 260 mg, plasma miglustat attained a Cmax of approximately 3000 ng/ml and an 
AUC0-∞ of approximately 25,000 ng h/ml. 
Distribution 
Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 37/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The volume of distribution after oral administration is about 78 to 103 l (terminal phase volume of 
distribution was approximately 90 l), which is greater than total body water (42 l).  
Miglustat crosses the blood-brain barrier. 
Elimination 
Based on the reference medicinal product, miglustat is mainly eliminated by renal excretion, with the 
urinary recovery of unchanged drug accounting for 70-80% of the dose. Following administration of a 
single dose of 100 mg 14C-miglustat to healthy volunteers, 83% of the radioactivity was recovered in 
urine and 12% in faeces. Several metabolites were identified in urine and faeces. The most abundant 
metabolite in urine was miglustat glucuronide accounting for 5% of the dose. 
Miglustat clearance in patients with Pompe disease was about 10.5 l/h, independent of the dose or co-
administered with cipaglucosidase alfa. The popPK estimated clearance was lower and estimated to be 
5.7 l/h. This was additional clarified by the applicant, due to the numerical more data included from 
study ATB200-03 compared to study ATB200-2 (see before). 
The miglustat elimination half-life was about 6 hours. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Plasma miglustat Cmax and AUC increased dose-proportional over the 130 – 260 mg dose range, co-
administered with cipaglucosidase alfa. 
No unexpected accumulation is observed after once every 2 weeks dosing. After repeated doses of 20 
mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa + 260 mg miglustat, Cmax and AUC were comparable across different PK 
visits, indicating no time dependency. 
Special populations 
No studies have been carried out in subjects with renal or hepatic impaired function.  
Population PK analysis of gender, race/ethnicity (Asian vs White), and age (range of 27 – 66 years) as 
a covariate across clinical studies indicate that there is no significant effect on plasma miglustat 
exposure. Body weight appeared to be a covariate for miglustat exposure. An increase of body weight 
increases AUC and Cmax. AUC was 24% lower in a subject weighing 104 kg, while AUC was about 24% 
higher in a subject weighing 51 kg, compared to a reference non-Asian, ERT-naive, 70 kg, 50-year-old 
male. However, a lower dose is recommended for a subject weighing 40 – 50 kg. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Literature data indicate that miglustat may inhibit intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase, maltase 
and isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract leading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Based on the reference medicinal product, a low potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions 
with  CYP450  isoenzymes  has  been  identified.  However,  a  full  panel  of  transporter-mediated  in  vitro 
studies has not been completed at the present time.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Miglustat was developed for oral administration in conjunction with cipaglucosidase alfa to ensure its 
stability at neutral pH and delivery of active enzymes to muscle and lysosomes. Miglustat concerns a 
pharmacokinetic enzyme stabiliser of cipaglucosidase alfa.  
Miglustat binds selectively with cipaglucosidase alfa in the blood during infusion; thereby stabilising the 
conformation of cipaglucosidase alfa and minimising the loss of enzyme activity while in circulation. 
This selective binding between cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat is transient with disassociation 
occurring in the lysosome. Miglustat alone has no effect on glycogen reduction. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-03, creatine kinase (CK) and urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Hex4) 
levels tended to decrease upon treatment with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo in ERT-naïve patients with Pompe disease. Observed decreases in CK levels tended to be 
more consistent for cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat as compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo. 
In the ERT-naïve LOPD study patients, both CK and Hex4 levels tended to decrease upon 
cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat (CK -171.3 U/l, Hex4 -2.5 mmol/mol creatinine) and 
also upon alglucosidase alfa in combination with placebo (CK -23.1 U/l, Hex4 -1.6 mmol/mol 
creatinine).  
In the ERT-experienced LOPD study patients, both CK levels and Hex4 levels tended to decrease upon 
treatment with cipaglucosidase alfa combined with miglustat (change from baseline at week 52: CK -
118.0 U/l, Hex4 -1.7 mmol/mol creatinine), whereas both CK levels and Hex4 levels tended to increase 
upon treatment with alglucosidase alfa and placebo (change from baseline at week 52: CK +79.6 U/l, 
Hex4 +1.9 mmol/mol creatinine). 
Overall, observed decreases in CK and Hex4 levels tended to be larger for cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat as compared to those of alglucosidase alfa/placebo in ERT-naïve and also in ERT-
experienced study patients with Pompe disease.  
Based on the reference medicinal product, miglustat levels are likely to affect the production of 
glycosylceramide and glycosylceramide-derived glycosphingolipids as a secondary pharmacological 
effect. Although glycosphingolipid levels may decrease in the first hours post-dose at the 
recommended miglustat posology, a lasting physiologic effect is not expected in Pompe disease 
patients. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of miglustat has been sufficiently characterised. No unexpected 
accumulation is observed after once every 2 weeks of dosing. 
Apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of miglustat was observed in healthy volunteers and 
patients with Pompe disease, respectively. Non-compartmental analysis indicated a higher volume of 
distribution and elimination half-life in patients, 160 l vs. 100 l and 9.6 h vs. 6 h, respectively. This 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 39/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be explained by the difference in blood sampling scheme. Blood samples were collected for a 
longer period of time post-dose for healthy subjects compared to patients, leading to a different 
elimination half-life in healthy volunteers, which also resulted in a higher Vd. 
Administration of miglustat 1 h before the start of infusion of 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa dose 
resulted in increased exposure of total GAA protein compared to the administration of cipaglucosidase 
alfa alone. In ERT-experienced ambulatory patients, at the 260 mg miglustat dose level, early 
exposure (AUCtmax-24h) increased 43.6%, AUC0-inf increased 29.1%, and clearance decreased by 
26.8%. In ERT-naïve ambulatory patients, early exposure (AUCtmax-24h) increased 47.5%, and 
AUC0-inf increased 31.7%. In addition, plasma levels were significantly increased at 12h and 24h after 
the start of infusion. 
The recommended adult dose of cipaglucosidase alfa is 20 mg/kg, given every 2 weeks. Miglustat 
should be administered about 1 h before the start of the 4h infusion of cipaglucosidase alfa. This is 
considered acceptable based on the above data. 
Moreover, the SmPC indicates that patients should fast 2 hours before and 2 hours after taking 
Opfolda. Miglustat should be administered under fasting conditions 1h before the start of infusion of 
cipaglucosidase alfa, as the miglustat tmax is about 2-3 hours and as such high plasma miglustat 
concentrations were obtained during and after infusion. 
Furthermore, the posology is based on body weight. For patients weighing ≥ 50 kg, the recommended 
dose is 4 capsules of 65 mg (260 mg total). For patients weighing ≥ 40 kg to < 50 kg, the 
recommended dose is 3 capsules of 65 mg (195 mg total). 
During the procedure, additional popPK data showing comparable adult exposure were submitted to 
support the proposed dose of 195 mg in subjects weighing 40 - 50 kg and such posology was 
considered acceptable for this specific population. In subjects >100 kg, the exposure was 24% lower. 
At CHMP request, further simulation were performed to investigate the need for an increased dose. 
Additional data showed that % occupancy would not significantly increase in case a higher miglustat 
dose would be administered to subjects weighing >90 kg, compared to subjects weighing <90 kg. 
Thus the CHMP recommended a normal dose of 260 mg for subjects weighing > 100 kg. 
No studies have been carried out in subjects with renal or hepatic impaired function.  
Modelling and simulation suggested that 260 miglustat QOW did not accumulate in subject with renal 
clearance ≥ 25 ml/min. Thus no dosing adjustment has been recommended by the CHMP for renal 
impaired patients, despite noting the reference medicinal product tid dosing is not recommended for 
subjects with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.  
In addition no dosing adjustment is necessary for the hepatic impaired patients since miglustat is not 
expected to be impacted by hepatic impairment and is not bound to plasma proteins, eliminated for 70 
– 80% as an intact drug in the urine, and only 12% of a labelled dose was recovered in faeces. 
Based on the reference medicinal product, a low potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions 
with  CYP450  isoenzymes  has  been  identified.  However,  a  full  panel  of  transporter-mediated  in  vitro 
studies has not been completed at the present time.  
In the clinical studies, 2 formulations were used in phase I/II and phase III studies respectively. The 
formulation for phase I/II studies contains only miglustat powder and the phase III studies used the 
“to be marketed” formulation. Both formulations were shown bioequivalent under fasting conditions. In 
addition, bioequivalence was also shown for the “to be marketed” formulation when administered as 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023

whole vs. reconstituted in 180 ml of water. Based on these data, the SmPC reflects that miglustat 65 
mg capsule can be swallowed whole and taken on an empty stomach. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Miglustat bound to cipaglucosidase alfa stabilises cipaglucosidase alfa in the circulation. This increases 
the cipaglucosidase alfa exposure, possibly resulting in a more pronounced clinical effect.  
Although glycosphingolipid levels may decrease in the first hours post-dose at the recommended 
miglustat posology, a lasting physiologic effect is not expected in Pompe disease patients. Based on 
the assumptions that the lysosomal bioavailability is increased by both the added M6P residues and the 
coadministration of miglustat, it is plausible that the combined pharmacological effects of 
cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat will increase the clinical effects upon long-term treatment in 
patients with Pompe disease. 
Miglustat is used as an enzyme stabiliser of cipaglucosidase alfa but exerts no pharmacodynamic 
effects itself. Observed pharmacodynamic effects are due to cipaglucosidase alfa of which the systemic 
availability is enhanced by miglustat.  
The dosing rationale for cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat was based upon in vitro stability data and non-
clinical data. In vitro studies demonstrated that the interaction of miglustat with cipaglucosidase alfa in 
the neutral pH environment of whole blood increases its protein stability and prevents denaturation, 
resulting in the preservation of cipaglucosidase alfa activity. Non-clinical data suggested a higher 
cipaglucosidase alfa exposure and uptake at the 20 mg/kg dose with concomitant administration of 
miglustat. The data indicated an improved cipaglucosidase alfa uptake and glycogen reduction. An 
optimum was observed at the 10 mg/kg miglustat dose, which would correspond with about 270 mg in 
adults. The dose of 260 mg miglustat would result in an optimal time of stabilisation of cipaglucosidase 
alfa in plasma and uptake and glycogen reduction. 
Considering the long-term exposure in study ATB200-02 (e.g. after the third dose) the increase in 
cipaglucosidase alfa exposure due to the addition of miglustat appeared small (about 29%) and thus 
there is a lack of clear pharmacokinetic rationale for the addition of miglustat. Although the PK data 
indicated an improved cipaglucosidase alfa uptake and glycogen reduction, differences may be 
considered not pronounced. The additive effects of miglustat to cipaglucosidase alfa have not been 
evaluated in conducted clinical studies. 
Two biomarkers were evaluated in studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-03. These were creatine kinase 
(CK), an indicator of muscle damage in Pompe disease, and urine Hex4, a disease substrate. The used 
pharmacodynamic endpoints Hex4 and CK are considered acceptable. These parameters were also 
used in the studies for alglucosidase alfa, as well as in other publications. Available results from these 
biomarkers are supportive of the pharmacodynamic effects of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with 
miglustat in both ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve patients with Pompe disease.  
A positive dose-response relationship was demonstrated for the combined use of cipaglucosidase alfa 
and miglustat with respect to pharmacodynamics (Hex4 and CK).  
Miglustat-related QTc prolongation or changes in other ECG parameters were evaluated and did not 
suggest that miglustat and/or cipaglucosidase alfa induce clinically relevant QTc prolongations. 
Regarding miglustat dosed at 260 mg every 2 weeks with cipaglucosidase alfa, plots of conditional 
weighted residual and normalised prediction distribution errors did not show obvious trends in effects 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 41/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of immunogenicity markers on miglustat pharmacokinetics. The estimated covariate effects were 
generally close to the null value, with 95% CIs containing the null value. Overall, these 
immunogenicity markers did not impact miglustat PK in a clinically meaningful manner.  
Subgroups 
Miglustat-dosing is body weight-dependent in adult patients with late-onset Pompe disease. For 
patients weighing ≥ 40 kg to < 50 kg, the recommended miglustat dosing is 195 mg once every 2 
weeks. For patients weighing ≥ 50 kg, the recommended miglustat dosing is 260 mg once every 2 
weeks. The impact of body weight on biomarker (CK, Hex4) and functional endpoints at a particular 
miglustat dosage for late-onset Pompe disease in adults was initially unclear. Later, it was shown that 
there is little correlation between body weight and biomarker and functional endpoints in LOPD 
patients. Hence, similar pharmacodynamic and clinical effects are expected for patients with varying 
body weight. This supports the appropriateness of proposed single miglustat dosing regimen for all 
patients weighing 50 kg or more.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Miglustat was developed for oral administration in conjunction with cipaglucosidase alfa to ensure its 
stability at neutral pH and delivery of active enzyme to muscle and lysosomes. Miglustat alone has no 
specific effects on glycogen reduction in Pompe disease. The individual contribution of the mannose 
enriched cipaglucosidase alfa, and miglustat to the observed combined pharmacodynamic effects has 
not been evaluated.  
The available study data on pharmacodynamics support the pharmacodynamic effects of 
cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat in ERT-naïve and ERT-experienced late-onset Pompe 
disease patients. 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of miglustat in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa in human 
studies has been adequately documented and meet the requirements to support this application. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dose-response studies were submitted with cipaglucosidase alfa alone or miglustat alone. The dose-
response study ATB002-02 evaluated the dose response of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with 
miglustat.  
Study ATB002-02 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, open-label, fixed-sequence first-in-human study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity 
of intravenous cipaglucosidase alfa alone and when co-administered with oral miglustat in ambulatory 
(cohorts 1, 3, and 4) and non-ambulatory (cohort 2) adult LOPD patients. Study data until the data 
cut-off of 15 June 2020 are presented.

The study is conducted in 4 cohorts and 4 stages (see Figure 6). 
Figure 2. Study design of study ATB002-02 
Note: ATB200 = cipaglucosidase alfa; AT2221 = miglustat; Stage 1 evaluates 3 single dose administrations in LOPD 
patients (cohort 1); stage 2 analyses 2 separate dosages of miglustat combined with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa 
with 3 subsequent administrations for each dosage combination (cohort 1); stage 3 and 4 analyses the effects of 20 
mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with 260 mg miglustat during 12 months of treatment in various groups 
of LOPD patients (cohorts 2, 3, and 4). 
In all study stages, cipaglucosidase alfa was administered every 2 weeks as an approximate 4-hour 
intravenous infusion (±15 minutes) at a constant infusion rate. In study stages 2, 3, and 4, miglustat 
65 mg oral capsules were administered 1 hour before the intravenous infusion of cipaglucosidase alfa. 
Study patients fasted for at least 2 hours before and 2 hours after administration of miglustat. 
The limited dose-finding part (stage 1 and 2 in cohort 1) consisted of 11 patients treated with a single 
escalating dose of 5, 10, 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa in stage 1 and in stage 2 thrice a regimen of 
two doses of miglustat (130 or 260 mg) combined with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa. As each dose of 
cipaglucosidase alfa monotherapy has only been administered once, no conclusion can be drawn as to 
the most appropriate dosage and regimen; furthermore, no data on the efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa 
alone are available. 
Patient-reported outcomes were only evaluated in study stages 3 and 4 of study ATB200-02. However, 
due to the non-randomised, open-label nature of study ATB200-02, and the limited number of study 
patients (n= 29), no definitive conclusions can be made with respect to the patient-reported outcomes 
for this treatment combination, nor with respect to a potential dose-response relationship for these 
endpoints and thus these data are not presented in this report.

ERT experienced population 
For cohorts 1, 2 and 4, 65% of patients were male, with a mean (SD) age ranging from 40.8 (17.0) to 
49.4 (9.5) years. The mean (SD) number of years since the diagnosis of Pompe disease was 8.1 (5.5) 
for Cohort 1, 9.3 (6.2) for Cohort 2, and 10.2 (2.4) for Cohort 4. The mean (SD) duration of ERT 
treatment ranged from 4.7 (1.4) to 10.1 (4.8) years.  
At baseline, the mean (SD) 6-minute walking distance was 393.5 meters (119.7) for all ERT-
experienced ambulatory patients (cohorts 1 and 4). Mean (SD) changes from baseline to month 12 
were +33.5 meters (49.6) for ERT-experienced ambulatory patients. The sitting forced vital capacity 
tended to decrease (-1.3%; 95%CI -4, 2), but the supine forced vital capacity tended to increase 
(+2.7%; 95%CI -2, 7). 
ERT-naïve population 
For cohort 3, 83% of patients were female, with a mean (SD) age of 49.3 (15.1) years. The mean (SD) 
number of years since the diagnosis of Pompe disease was 5.2 (4.7).  
At baseline, the mean (SD) 6-minute walking distance was 396.0 (75.2) meters for all ERT-naïve 
ambulatory patients (cohort 3). Mean (95%CI) changes from baseline to month 12 were +57.0 (26, 9) 
meter for ERT-naive ambulatory patients. Following 12 months of treatment, the sitting (mean 
improvement 4.5%, 95%CI -4, 13) and supine (mean improvement 1.8%; 95%CI -6, 10) forced vital 
capacity tended to improve compared to baseline upon co-administration of 20 mg/kg intravenously 
infused cipaglucosidase alfa and 260 mg miglustat in ERT-naïve patients.

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Male and female subjects were ≥ 18 years old and weighed ≥ 40 kg at screening; diagnosis of LOPD 
based on documentation of one of the following: deficiency of GAA enzyme, GAA genotyping; a sitting 
FVC ≥ 30% of the predicted value for healthy adults (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
III) at screening; subject performed two 6MWTs at screening that were valid, as determined by the 
clinical evaluator, and that met all of the following criteria: both screening values of 6MWD were ≥ 75 
m, both screening values of 6MWD were ≤ 90% of the predicted value for healthy adults and the lower 
value of 6MWD was within 20% of the higher value of 6MWD. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation support for > 6 hours per day while awake; 
hypersensitivity to any of the excipients in cipaglucosidase alfa, alglucosidase alfa, or miglustat. 
•  Treatments 
The study drugs used in this study were co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat 
(intervention) or co-administration of alglucosidase alfa with placebo (control). The doses of 
cipaglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa were 20 mg per kilogram of body weight. Cipaglucosidase 
alfa or alglucosidase alfa was administered every 2 weeks as a 4-hour iv infusion. The dose of 
miglustat was 195 mg (3 × 65 mg oral capsules) for subjects weighing ≥ 40 kg to < 50 kg and 260 mg 
(4 × 65 mg oral capsules) for subjects weighing ≥ 50 kg. 
•  Objectives 
Primary objective 
To assess the efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat co-administration on ambulatory function, as 
measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), compared with alglucosidase alfa/placebo. 
Secondary objectives 
To assess the effects of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat co-administration compared with alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo on: pulmonary function, as measured by sitting FVC (% predicted); muscle strength; 
health-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs); motor function; overall clinical impression as 
assessed by both physician and subject; safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity; biomarkers of 
muscle injury and disease substrate; population PK of cipaglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa in 
ERT-experienced subjects using plasma total GAA protein level by signature peptide assay and plasma 
miglustat concentration; PK of cipaglucosidase alfa, alglucosidase alfa, and miglustat in ERT-naïve 
subjects using non-compartmental analysis; exposure-response relationship for cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase alfa/placebo co-administration. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The change in 6MWD (the distance walked in the 6MWT, in meters) from baseline to week 52. The test 
was performed at screenings 1 and 2 and at weeks 12, 26, 38, and 52. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 45/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Key secondary endpoints 
Changes in: % predicted sitting FVC from baseline to week 52; manual muscle test (MMT) lower 
extremity score from baseline to week 52; 6MWD from baseline to week 26; Patient-reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Physical Function total score from baseline to 
week 52; GSGC and PROMIS-Fatigue total scores from baseline to week 52. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Changes in: % predicted 6MWD from baseline to week 52; variables related to motor function from 
baseline to week 52; variables related to muscle strength from baseline to week 52; variables from 
PRO measures from baseline to week 52; measures of pulmonary function from baseline to week 52. 
Proportion of subjects with improvement in both 6MWD and % predicted FVC  
Actual values of the subject’s functional status (improving, stable, or declining) at week 52, as 
measured by the Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) and by the Physician’s Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC). 
•  Sample size 
To achieve 90% power with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, a total of 99 evaluable subjects (2:1 ratio) 
are needed to show superiority based on the t-test with an assumed standard deviation of 7.43%. 
Approximately 30 ERT-naïve LOPD subjects were planned to be enrolled. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomised with a 2:1 ratio to cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat (intervention) or co-
administration of alglucosidase alfa with placebo (control). A centralised block randomisation procedure 
was used, stratified by baseline 6MWD (75 to < 150 meters, 150 to < 400 meters, ≥ 400 meters) and 
ERT status (ERT-experienced versus ERT-naïve). The study was planned to be double-blind. A 
matching placebo for miglustat was to be used with alglucosidase alfa, and black or dark covering over 
cipaglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa reconstituted solution were used during infusion.  
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The safety population includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug. 
The ITT-OBS population includes all subjects from the ITT population, where in the efficacy analyses all 
available, observed data without imputation for missing post-baseline data will be used.  
The ITT-LOCF population includes all subjects from the ITT population, where in the efficacy analyses 
missing data will be replaced with the last available value from post-baseline results.  
The per-protocol population (PP) includes all subjects from the ITT population who have both baseline 
and at least one post-baseline assessment and who do not have pre-specified protocol deviations. The 
per-protocol population 1 (PP1) will be used for the supportive analyses of the 6WMD, while per-
protocol population 2 (PP2) will be used for supportive analyses of the % predicted FVC. The PP 
population will be analysed according to the actual treatment received.

Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to week 52 in 6MWD. The 6MWT is to be performed 
twice at the Week 52/ET visit, and the average of the 2 test values will be used.  
The difference in change from baseline to week 52 in 6MWD between intervention and control was 
analysed using a MMRM model based on the ITT-OBS population. The model included the fixed factors 
treatment, time (visit number), treatment-by-time interaction, ERT status, and gender, and the 
covariates baseline 6MWD, baseline age, baseline weight, and baseline height. In this analysis model, 
the applicant remapped the results of delayed visits to planned visits (see missing values), which could 
lead to bias in the estimated treatment difference. As requested by the CHMP, the applicant performed 
a new analysis using the MMRM model based on the ITT-OBS population excluding the outlying subject 
without imputation at week 52 and based on the actual time point of the assessments during the 
procedure, since this analysis was considered the most adequate and reliable method to evaluate 
efficacy. The new MMRM model included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) status, and gender, as well as the fixed, continuous covariates of time of 
assessment (days), baseline 6MWD, baseline age, baseline weight, and baseline height, and the 
treatment-by-time interaction. A random intercept of subject was also included in the model.  
Secondary efficacy analyses 
For the key and secondary endpoints, the new analysis using the MMRM model based on the ITT-OBS 
population without the outlying subject and based on the actual time points of assessment was also 
performed as requested by the CHMP during the procedure. 
Multiplicity 
To control the overall alpha level, hierarchical testing was planned with an ordering of the secondary 
endpoints to be tested sequentially after the primary efficacy endpoint was tested statistically 
significant. 
Missing values  
Due to COVID-19, not all planned visits could be performed within the time windows, resulting in 
delayed visits outside the planned visit windows. The applicant remapped the results of the delayed 
visits to the planned study visits, and these were used in the original primary and other analyses. 
Delayed visits and make-up assessments that go beyond the stated visit windows were remapped to 
the planned study visit. Suppose a subject had a COVID-19 related situation leading to a delay in the 
week 26 assessment such that the delayed visit / make-up assessment for week 26 occurs on Day 261 
(which is 36 days outside of the planned visit window for week 26, and it’s inside the week 38 visit 
window), followed by the week 38 assessment on day 300 (which is right within the week 38 visit 
window). Here, the delayed assessment occurring on day 261 was remapped to the week 26 visit 
(which was the intended visit). If week 52 is delayed the delayed visit assessments will still be used for 
analyses. The make-up assessments at week 52 was used as the week 52 results in the original 
analyses. The requested analyses were not based on remapping visits but used the actual time points 
of the assessments without imputations. 
For efficacy analyses that did not use the MMRM model, the applicant used the last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) method in case of missing values. These analyses are considered supportive. The LOCF 
method replaces missing values with values measured at least 12 weeks earlier. As LOPD is expected 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 47/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to deteriorate over time in case of no treatment and the 6MWD is not expected to be a monotone 
increasing function during the study, the LOCF method is considered a non-conservative approach for 
dealing with missing values and could lead to overly optimistic results for both treatment groups and 
therefore can lead to bias in estimating a treatment effect for a deteriorated illness in time. Therefore, 
the LOCF method is not considered appropriate, and the analyses using the LOCF method can only be 
considered as supportive analyses.

•  Recruitment 
Date first subject enrolled: 03 December 2018 
Date last subject completed: 15 December 2020 
•  Conduct of the study 
In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group versus alglucosidase alfa/placebo group, 67 (79%) and 28 
(74%) subjects, respectively, had a major protocol deviation mostly in the categories of study 
procedures (49% vs. 47%), investigational product (41% vs. 37%), and informed consent (22% vs. 
32%). In total 9 subjects (8 vs. 1) and 16 subjects (11 vs. 5) had a major deviation that was 
considered to have an impact on the analysis of 6MWD and FVC, respectively, and were excluded from 
the PP analyses. The reasons were discontinuation (5 vs. 1), using a walking device (4 vs. 0), missing 
week 52 FVC (8 vs. 3) and non-interpretable FVC at week 52 (0 vs. 1). As most major protocol 
deviations did not lead to exclusion from the PP population, neither of the protocol deviations 
(including 2 unblinding events) impacted the integrity of the primary or the key secondary 
assessments in the study. 
In total, 66 (54%) subjects had protocol deviations due to the COVID-19 pandemic (47 (55.3%) 
subjects in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 19 (50%) subjects in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group). Examination of the clinical data, for one subject revealed after database lock that 
the subject had previously been using an anabolic steroid (ostarine) and had deliberately 
underperformed his screening assessments in order to gain entry into the study. This subject was 
treatment naïve and randomised to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo arm.

Most subjects (95 (77.2%)) were ERT experienced, with a mean (SD) ERT treatment duration of 7.4 
(3.5) years. Subjects received prior ERT for an average of 7.5 years in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and 7.1 years in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. 
Baseline 6MWD mean (SD) was 357.9 (111.8) meters and 350.1 (119.8) meters, respectively, for 
subjects in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. 
Baseline values for sitting % predicted FVC were 70.7 (19.6) in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
group and 70.0 (21.3) in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. 
ERT-experienced subjects 
Demographics and baseline characteristics for subjects with previous ERT experience were similar to 
those described for the overall ITT population, with lower mean 6MWD results at baseline 346.9 meters 
for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 334.6 meters for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo 
group). Mean baseline results for % predicted FVC are comparable between the treatment groups 
(67.7). 
ERT-naïve subjects 
For the 28 ERT-naïve subjects in this study, mean baseline results for 6MWD (397.8 meters) and % 
predicted FVC (80.0%) were higher in ERT-naïve subjects compared with ERT-experienced subjects. 
At baseline, mean 6MWD results were approximately 15 meters lower in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group (393.6 m) compared with the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (408.3 m). There 
were more females in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group (57.6%) versus the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group (47.4%)

•  Outcomes and estimation 
For all analyses, one outlying subject was excluded. Examination of the clinical data revealed that one 
subject, an ERT-naïve subject in the control arm, had previously been using an anabolic steroid and 
had deliberately underperformed its screening assessments to gain entry into the study. The study 
screening Visits showed a 6MWD average of 320 meters and a percent predicted FVC of 83.5%, 
decreases of 265 meters and 10% from his preceding walk and pulmonary function testing 4 months 
earlier. At week 52 the subject walked 675 meters, an increase of 355 meters.  
Primary endpoint: Change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52 – study ATB200-03 
In study ATB200-03, the primary endpoint was analysed with the originally MMRM model based on the 
ITT-OBS population with remapped visits, excluding the outlying subject. Baseline 6MWD mean (SD) 
was slightly higher for subjects in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat than for subjects in the 
alglucosidase alfa group 357.9 (111.8) meters and 350.1 (119.8) meters, respectively. The mean 
(95%CI) change in 6MWD (meters) from baseline to week 52 showed an estimated mean 
improvement of 21.3 (12.1, 30.5) meters for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to 7.1 
(-6.9, 21.1) meters for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (Figure 8). The estimated mean treatment 
difference (95%CI) excluding the outlying subject is 14.2 (-2.6, 31.0) meters with two-sided p-value of 
0.097, which has to be put in the context of the difference observed at baseline.

This means that the study failed to show the superiority of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat based on the 
6MWT. From a formal statistical point of view, no further confirmatory conclusions are possible.

mean and SE were obtained from the MMRM.  
Using the MMRM model as requested by the CHMP, based on the actual time point of assessments 
(ITT-OBS Population) and excluding the outlying subject, the estimated mean change in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group was 20.0 (95% CI 13.1, 26.9) and in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group 8.3 (95% CI -2.2, 18.8). The estimated mean treatment difference (using this 
method) is 11.7 (95% CI -1.0, 24.4) with a two-sided p-value of 0.07, indicating that statistical 
superiority was not demonstrated.  
Key secondary endpoints 
The first key secondary endpoint was the change in sitting % predicted FVC from baseline to week 52, 
analysed using the originally MMRM analysis with remapped visits; subjects treated with 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat showed a -1.0% estimated decline compared with a -4.0% estimated 
decline in subjects treated with alglucosidase after 52 weeks. The estimated mean difference (95% CI) 
between the treatments after 52 weeks was 3.0% (0.6%, 5.5%). Figure 9 displays a line plot of the 
summary statistics by visit.

•  Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on changes in 6MWD from baseline to week 52 (primary endpoint) 
and sitting predicted %FVC from baseline to week 52 (key secondary endpoint). Further analyses were 
requested by the CHMP in- and excluding the outlying subject. The primary efficacy analysis was also 
performed by ERT status (see Table 9 and Table 10).  
Sensitivity analyses for primary endpoint: change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52 
Including outlying subject:  
In the MMRM analysis (including the outlying subject) based on the ITT-OBS population using actual 
time point of assessments, at week 52, the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group had an LS mean 
improvement in 6MWD of 20.2 m from baseline compared to an LS mean improvement of 17.7 m for 
the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) was 2.6 m (-12.1, 
17.2).  
Excluding outlying subject: 
During the procedure and as requested by the CHMP, sensitivity analyses with the actual time point of 
assessments were performed with a modified MMRM model for the ITT-OBS population: including 
country as a random effect; using the ‘Control group imputation’ and using the pattern mixture 
multiple imputations, the estimated mean treatment difference for the change in 6MWD from baseline 
to week 52  varied from +10.8 to +12.3 meters with the lower margin of the 95% CI varying from -1.4 
to -0.7 meters. The results of the sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint showed comparable 
efficacy results with the primary analysis. The modified MMRM model based on actual time points

(excluding the outlying subject) was also used in the analysis based on the PP1 population. The 
estimated mean treatment difference (95% CI) for the change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52 was 
11.4 (-1.1, 24.0).  
Sensitivity analyses for the key secondary endpoint: change in sitting predicted %FVC from baseline to 
week 52,  
Excluding outlying subject: 
Based on the requested MMRM model with actual time points on the ITT-OBS population, sensitivity 
analyses were performed, including country as a random effect, the ‘Control group imputation’ and the 
pattern mixture multiple imputations the estimated mean treatment difference varied from +1.8 to 
+2.3 % with the lower margin of the 95% CI varying from 0.0 to +0.2%. These sensitivity analyses on 
the key secondary endpoint also showed comparable efficacy results with the primary analysis. The 
modified MMRM model (excluding the outlying subject) based on actual time points was also used in 
the analysis based on the PP1 population. The estimated mean treatment difference (95% CI) was 2.0 
(-0.1, 4.1).  
ERT-experienced population (n=95) 
The mean (SD) 6MWD at baseline was 346.9 meters (110.2) for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
group and 334.6 meters (114.0) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. At week 52, using observed 
values, the mean 6MWD was 359.8 meters for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group, with an 
estimated improvement of 15.9 meters (95%CI 8.3, 23.4) from baseline compared to the estimated 
mean of 335.7 meters with an estimated improvement of 1.0 meters (95%CI -10.2, 12.1) for the 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The MMRM model based on the ITT-OBS population with the actual 
time point of assessments resulted in an estimated mean treatment difference (95%CI) of 14.9 meters 
(1.2, 28.6) meters. 
The mean (SD) % predicted FVC at baseline was 67.9% (19.1) for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
group and 67.5% (21.0) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. At week 52, using observed values 
and the MMRM model with the actual time point of assessments, the estimated mean (SD) % predicted 
FVC was 67.4% (20.0) for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group, with an improvement of -0.2% 
(95% CI -1.5, 1.1) from baseline compared to the estimated mean % predicted FVC of 60.6% (19.6) 
and a mean change of -3.8% (95% CI -5.7, -1.9) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The MMRM 
model based on the ITT-OBS population with the actual time point of assessments resulted in an 
estimated mean treatment difference (95% CI) of 3.6% (1.3, 5.9).

ERT-naïve Population (n=27) 
The mean (SD) 6MWD at baseline was 394 meters (112) for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
and 421 meters (136) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. At week 52 using observed values 
excluding the outlying subject, the mean 6MWD was 427 meters for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
group, with an estimated improvement of 28.5 meters (95%CI 12.4, 44.7) from baseline compared to 
the mean 6MWD of 459 meters and an estimated improvement of 52.7 meters (95%CI 23.2, 82.3) for 
the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The MMRM analysis based on the ITT-OBS population with the 
actual time point of assessments without the outlying subject, showed an estimated mean treatment 
difference (95% CI) of -24.2 (-60.0, 11.7). 
The mean (SD) sitting % predicted FVC at baseline was 80.2% (18.7) for the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and 79.1% (22.6) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. At Week 52 using 
observed values excluding the outlying subject, the mean (SD) sitting % predicted FVC was 76.8% 
(19.5) for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group, with an estimated mean change (95% CI) of -
5.2% (-7.5, -2.9) from baseline compared to the mean (SD) % predicted FVC of 72.7% (23.4) and 
estimated mean change (95%CI) of -2.4 (-6.7, 1.8) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. MMRM 
analysis based on the ITT-OBS population with actual time points excluding the outlying subject 
resulted in an estimated mean difference (95% CI) of -2.8% (-7.8, 2.3).

Notes 
The study failed to demonstrate superiority, therefore all p-values beyond the 
primary analysis are not presented. 
Subgroup analyses indicate that for the ERT-experienced population comparable 
or even better results are reported for cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat as 
compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment. For the small group of 
treatment naïve LOPD patients, however, results of cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment appeared to be 
worse. 
*The number of subjects used in an analysis depends on the number of subjects with non-missing values for the analysis. 
2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies have been specifically conducted in special populations (elderly, patients with renal/hepatic 
impairment). Studies in the paediatric population are not available yet. Based on the available efficacy and 
PK analyses, the claimed indication (adult LOPD), this is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data from Studies ATB200-02, ATB200-03, and ATB200-07 (Pool 2) were pooled for analysis of the long-term 
efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat. A total of 142 (97.9%) subjects were treated with cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat, and 38 (95.0%) subjects were treated with alglucosidase alfa/placebo in Pool 2 (including the 
outlying subject). One (0.7%) subject in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 37 (97.4%) subjects in 
the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group completed the assigned treatment period, and 8 (4.4%) discontinued 
due to various reasons, with adverse event (4 subjects) and withdrawal of consent by subject (2 subjects) as 
the most common. 
Age at diagnosis was similar across treatment groups, with the median age being 40 years (range: 1 to 66 
years). Most ERT-experienced subjects in both the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo groups had ≥ 5 years previous treatment with alglucosidase alfa (73 (67.6%) subjects and 19 
(63.3%) subjects, respectively).

Long term results from pool 2 demonstrate continued improvements on motor (6MWD) and respiratory 
(sitting % predicted FVC) functions. 
The mean (SD) improvement in 6MWD for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group was 18.2 (42.6) meters 
at ≤ 15 months (n = 142), 27.5 (51.9) meters at > 15 to ≤ 24 months (n = 59), and 25.2 (72.9) meters at > 
24 months (n = 17). The improvements in 6MWD were maintained beyond 24 months, with the outlying 
subject included or excluded.  
The mean (SD) change from baseline in FVC for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group was -0.4 (6.3) at ≤ 
15 months (n = 134), -0.7 (8.3) at > 15 to ≤ 24 months (n = 53), and 1.7 (6.4) at > 24 months (n = 16). 
These improvements in FVC were maintained beyond 24 months, with the outlying subject included or 
excluded.  
No long-term data for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group are available, as all subjects switched to 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in study ATB200-07. 
2.6.5.6.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study ATB200-007 is an ongoing Phase 3 open-label extension study to assess the long-term safety and 
efficacy of intravenous cipaglucosidase alfa co-administered with oral miglustat in adult subjects with late-
onset Pompe disease.  
The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
(ATB200/AT2221) co-administration.  
As of 3 August 2021 (data lock point), data from this study included nearly all enrolled patients with at least 
an additional 6 months of exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa after the end of the ATB200-03 study, and 33 
patients (approximately 30% of patients) with an additional 12 months of exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa. 
Efficacy analyses in the presented interim clinical study report focused on week 26 results (total of 
approximately 18 months of treatment for patients in the ATB200-03 cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
continuing on cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in the ATB200-07 study). The safety analysis includes all 
available data through the data lock point. 
A total of 118 study patients (90 ERT-experienced and 28 ERT-naïve patients) received cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat and were analysed as 2 treatment subgroups: ATB200-03 cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
(N = 81) and ATB200-03 alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (N = 37).  
Demographic characteristics, including baseline 6MWD and sitting % predicted FVC as well as MMT and GSGC 
score, were generally similar between both groups. A majority (66.7%) of patients in both treatment groups 
had >5 years of prior treatment with ERT (68.9% of subjects in the ATB200-03 cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
group and 62.1% of patients in the ATB200-03 alglucosidase alfa/placebo group). Treatment compliance was 
high with an overall mean of 99.4% (99.1% of subjects in the ATB200-03 cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
group and 100% of subjects in the ATB200-03 alglucosidase alfa/placebo group). 
In the overall FAS Population (ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve subjects), the main efficacy endpoints of 
6MWD and sitting % predicted FVC showed relative stability over time through week 26 in both 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and alglucosidase alfa/placebo group.

The other main efficacy endpoints of MMT lower extremity, PROMIS-Physical Function, PROMIS-Fatigue, and 
GSGC scores also showed that patients from both the ATB200-03 cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 
the ATB200-03 alglucosidase alfa/placebo group remained stable over time through week 26 with minimal 
between-group differences. 
In the ERT-experienced subgroup, patients remained relatively stable over time through week 26 on 6MWD 
and sitting % predicted FVC. Overall, ERT-experienced patients had a mean (SD) change of -0.2 meters 
(30.19) from baseline in 6MWD, and a mean (SD) change of 1.1 (6.33) from baseline in sitting % predicted 
FVC. Results for MMT lower extremity scores in both groups showed relative stability through week 26 with a 
minimal visit-to-visit variability. In addition, results for the PROMIS-Physical Function scale and PROMIS-
Fatigue scores were similar between patients in the 2 groups. Similarly, GSGC showed stability over time 
through week 26 (overall mean [SD] change of -0.1 [2.52]). 
In the ERT-naïve subgroup, patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group remained relatively stable 
over time through week 26 on 6MWD and sitting % predicted FVC while patients in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group demonstrated an increase in both values. Overall, ERT-naïve patients had a mean (SD) 
change of 5.3 meters (26.99) from baseline in 6MWD and a mean (SD) change of -0.4 (4.54) from baseline 
in sitting % predicted FVC. Patients in the ATB200-03 alglucosidase alfa/placebo group experienced slight 
improvements in 6MWD and sitting % predicted FVC at week 12 following initiation with cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat that continued through week 26, with a mean (SD) change from baseline of 21.7 meters 
(32.65) in 6MWD and 0.6 (1.52) in sitting % predicted FVC at week 26.  
Results for MMT lower extremity scores in both ERT experienced and naïve subgroups showed relative 
stability through week 26 with minimal visit-to-visit variability. Results for the PROMIS-Physical Function 
scale and PROMIS-Fatigue scores were similar between patients in the 2 groups. Mean (SD) change from 
baseline for ERT-naïve patients was -0.0 (7.15) for the PROMIS-Physical Function score and -0.3 (6.80) for 
the PROMIS-Fatigue score at week 26. Results for GSGC scores were similar, with the GSGC scores showing 
stability over time through week 26 (overall mean [SD] change of 0.1 [2.45]). 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
 Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal evidence comes from one double-blind, randomised, multicentre, superiority study of 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in adult subjects with LOPD who had received ERT with alglucosidase alfa (i.e. 
ERT-experienced) or who had never received ERT (i.e. ERT-naïve) compared with alglucosidase alfa/placebo.  
The inclusion criteria limit the population to LOPD in adults.  
The comparator (alglucosidase alfa) is acceptable as this was the only authorised treatment for adult LOPD 
patients at the time the clinical study was conducted. 
The 6MWT and the FVC are currently considered the best possible endpoints for the assessment of the 
relevance of the treatment. The 6MWT and the FVC are commonly used as primary or key secondary 
endpoints in other studies in which adult LOPD patients are evaluated. The use of MMT, PROMIS and GSGC 
endpoint further strengthens the conclusions based on the 2 key endpoints. The remaining endpoints are 
considered explorative. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023

Dose selection for the pivotal Phase 3 study ATB200-03 was based on pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics/biomarker, efficacy, and safety data from the ongoing study ATB200-02 investigating the 
co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat only. The regimen used in the alglucosidase alfa 
group is in line with the dosing advice in the SmPC. However, the present application does not allow for 
assessment of the clinical efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa alone, since the pharmacodynamic and clinical 
effects of cipaglucosidase alfa alone have not been studied. 
In total, 66 (54%) subjects had protocol deviations due to the COVID-19 pandemic (47 (55.3%) subjects in 
the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 19 (50%) subjects in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group). 
These protocol deviations could have led to possible bias in estimating the treatment effect: remapping 
delayed visits due to COVID-19. 
According to the applicant, the normality assumption for the MMRM analysis (pre-defined in the SAP) is 
significantly violated (Shapiro-Wilk test <0.0001) and the applicant considered that the results of the non-
parametric ANCOVA were more appropriate for interpretation. However, the CHMP did not agree for the 
following reasons: 
- An analysis with an MMRM model including pre-planned visits and based on the ITT-OBS population was 
pre-defined in the SAP as the primary efficacy analysis.  
- Visual inspection of the residuals from both the original and the requested MMRM analyses did not suggest 
violation of the normality assumption.  
- Due to COVID-19, not all planned visits were performed within the time windows (at least 6 weeks below or 
above the planned time point) and resulted in delayed visits outside the planned visit windows. The applicant 
remapped the assessment results of the delayed visits to the earlier planned study visits; however, as a 
consequence, this remapping may have led to an overestimation of the effect. In general, an MMRM analysis 
using the actual time points of the assessments is expected to result in a more reliable estimate of the 
treatment difference compared to an MMRM analysis based on pre-planned fixed visit numbers, especially 
when the assessments were not performed at the pre-planned visits. There are 17 subjects (13 vs. 4) with a 
delayed visit of at least 28 days (4 weeks) after the target day, 8 of these 17 subjects (8 vs. 0) had a delay 
of at least 42 days (6 weeks) after the target day and at least there are two delays (2 vs. 0) with a delay of 
at least 28 days before the target day. Therefore, using an analysis model based on actual time points is 
expected to lead to a more precise and reliable estimation of the treatment difference and is considered a 
more reliable analysis model. 
- The non-parametric ANCOVA analysis as proposed by the applicant, used the LOCF method for handling 
missing data (not the conservative method for 6MWD) and was performed based on remapping of visit time 
points (not the actual time points were used), which both could introduce bias in the estimated efficacy 
treatment difference.  
Therefore, the requested analyses based on the MMRM model (ITT-OBS) using the actual time points of the 
assessments without imputation of missing values, excluding the outlying subject, is considered the most 
adequate and reliable method for the evaluation of efficacy. 
Although the study design is acceptable from a clinical point of view, it should be noted that the study failed 
to demonstrate superiority for the primary endpoint. This means no further hierarchical testing should be 
done. As the conduct of the study is without major flaws and carried out in accordance with the protocol, the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 67/108 
 
 
 
 
 
results observed in the comparator arm should show its usual level of efficacy, and results of the primary PP 
and ITT analysis are in concordance, the results might be used for further clinical assessment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall population 
A total of 123 subjects were randomised and dosed (95 ERT-experienced and 28 ERT-naïve). Most subjects 
(77.2%, N=95) were ERT experienced, with a mean (SD) ERT treatment duration of 7.4 (3.5) years.  
Baseline demographics were representative of an adult population of LOPD patients and were generally 
similar between the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment arms. Baseline 
6MWD and FVC, as well as MMT and GSGC scores, were generally similar between the treatment groups and 
within the ranges expected for adult patients with LOPD.  
One subject, an ERT-naïve patient randomised to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment and who 
underperformed at baseline and showed outlying residuals in the analysis, was considered to be very 
influential on the estimation of the treatment difference. The observed results during the treatment period 
are clinically implausible provided the patient met the in- and exclusion criteria. The CHMP considered 
reasonable to exclude this subject from all efficacy analyses.  
After randomisation, 85 patients were included in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat arm and 38 in the 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo arm. Two subjects in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group were excluded from the 
ITT and safety populations because they did not receive study treatment.  
Using the originally presented MMRM analysis for the primary endpoint (6MWD) based on remapped visits 
and excluding the outlying subject as proposed by the applicant, the estimated mean treatment difference 
(95%CI) excluding the outlying subject was +14.2 m (-2.6, 31.0) with a two-sided p-value of 0.097.   
The CHMP requested efficacy analysis on the primary endpoint (change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52) 
using MMRM method (excluding the outlying subject) based on the ITT-OBS population, and the actual time 
point of assessments resulted in an estimated mean change of 20.0 m (95% CI 13.1, 26.9) for the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and an estimated mean change of 8.3m (95% CI -2.2, 18.8) for the 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The estimated mean treatment difference is 11.7 meters with 95% CI (-
1.0, 24.4) and a 2-sided non-significant p-value of 0.07. It should be noted that the effect observed after 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment should be considered clinically relevant (MCID is about 21 m) in this 
mainly ERT experienced (78%) population. Sensitivity analyses showed comparable results. In addition, since 
the exclusion of the outlying subjects was not predefined in the SAP, comparison of the efficacy analyses with 
and without the outlying subject was conducted. The results of these efficacy analyses showed in both cases 
no clinically relevant estimated treatment difference (11.7 meters, 95%CI (-1.0, 24.4) against 2.6 meters 
with 95%CI (-12.1, 17.2)). The results with and without the outlying subject were not considered clinically 
relevant different in this worst-case scenario. Overall, the results of these analyses showed the clinical 
relevance and thus efficacy of the co-administration in the adult LOPD population.  
According to the planned hierarchical testing strategy, all other (key secondary and secondary) endpoints will 
be considered explorative.  
Using the MMRM model, the actual time point of assessments (ITT-OBS Population) and excluding the 
outlying subject, patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat showed an estimated change of -1.4 
(95% CI -2.5, -0.3) in sitting FVC compared with an estimated change of -3.7 (95% CI -5.4, -2.0) in patients 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 68/108 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with alglucosidase alfa after 52 weeks. The estimated treatment difference was 2.3 (95% CI 0.2, 
4.4). Sensitivity analyses showed comparable results. The change in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat arm 
may indicate a stabilisation of disease as it cannot be considered a clinically relevant decline, whereas the 
difference in the alglucosidase alfa arm indicated some clinically relevant deterioration after 52 weeks of 
treatment.  
For the remaining key secondary endpoints (MMT, PROMIS-Physical Function, PROMIS-fatigue and GSGC) 
results reported are more or less in line with the results of the 6MWT and the sitting %FVC and further 
support the conclusion that the effects obtained with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat appeared to be 
reasonably robust and consistent, of clinical relevance. 
The contribution of miglustat itself to the clinical effects of the co- administration of miglustat and 
cipaglucosidase alfa in human LOPD patients is unknown since cipaglucosidase alfa on its own has not been 
evaluated in human LOPD patients. Despite a lack of clear pharmacokinetic rationale for the addition of 
miglustat, the clinical relevance of the co-administration cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat has been established 
based on the efficacy data. An approximate 7% to 30% increases in AUC upon the addition of miglustat in 
rodent models were associated with a 50% increase in grip strength-wire hang in conducted non-clinical 
studies which further support the additive value of miglustat to the clinical effects of cipaglucosidase alfa in 
human adult LOPD patients. 
ERT experienced population 
The primary endpoint (change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52) resulted in an estimated treatment 
difference of 14.9 m (95% CI 1.2, 28.6). A MCID for treatment experienced LOPD patients cannot be 
retrieved from literature. However, in this treatment-experienced population, some deterioration is to be 
expected after more than 7 years of treatment. Therefore, an observed improvement in this population 
should be considered clinically beneficial. 
The key secondary endpoint (change in sitting % predicted FVC from baseline to week 52) resulted in an 
estimated mean difference of -0.2 (95% CI -1.5, 1.1) in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and of -3.8 
(95% CI -5.7, -1.9) in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The clinical difference reported for the 
cipaglucosidase/miglustat indicates a stabilisation of the disease.  
The results from the remaining key secondary endpoints (MMT, PROMIS-Physical Function, PROMIS-fatigue 
and GSGC) were more or less in line with the results of the primary and key secondary endpoints and support 
the efficacy of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in this population. 
ERT naïve population 
For the primary endpoint (change in 6MWD from baseline to week 52), there was an estimated mean 
improvement of 28.5 m (95% CI 12.4, 44.7) in the 20 ERT-naïve subjects who received cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat. In the alglucosidase alfa/placebo control group (n = 7; excluding the outlying subject), the 
mean improvement was 52.7 m (95% CI 23.2, 82.3).  
The improvement in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group is in line with the expected treatment benefit 
when compared to the published literature on ERT treatment in these treatment naïve patients (A. van der 
Ploeg, 2010). 
The key secondary endpoint (change in sitting % predicted FVC from baseline to week 52) resulted in an 
estimated mean difference of -5.2 (95% CI -7.5, -2.9) in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and of –

2.4 (95% CI -6.7, 1.8) in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The estimated mean treatment difference 
(95% CI) was -2.8 (-7.8, 2.3).  
While the 6MWD indicated a clinically relevant effect and the sitting % FVC suggested a deterioration, the 
underlying data did not clearly imply a treatment benefit in ERT-naïve population. Nevertheless, extrapolation 
of the data from the ERT-experienced (generally more severe and difficult to treat patients) to ERT-naïve 
population in LOPD is considered justified, primarily since there is no biologically plausible argumentation that 
the expected benefit would be less in ERT-naïve LOPD population. Further, the number of patients in this sub-
group is very limited and a random drift of the results cannot be excluded. In line with this, treatment with 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat led to greater improvement (i.e., reductions) in Hex4 and CK, biomarkers of 
glycogen reduction and muscle damage, respectively, versus alglucosidase alfa in both ERT-experienced and 
ERT-naïve LOPD populations.  
The results from the remaining key secondary endpoints (MMT, PROMIS-Physical Function, PROMIS-fatigue 
and GSGC) were more or less in line with the results of the primary and key secondary endpoints and did not 
add to the above discussion on the efficacy in ERT naive population. 
Regarding long term data, nearly all enrolled subjects with at least an additional 6 months of exposure to 
cipaglucosidase alfa after the end of the ATB200-03 study, and 33 subjects (approximately 30% of subjects) 
with no less than an additional 12 months of exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa have been included in the 
ongoing study ATB200-07. As of 3 August 2021, results for all main efficacy endpoints did not indicate 
clinically relevant differences in both the ATB200-03 cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group continuing on 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and the ATB200-03 alglucosidase alfa/placebo group switching to 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat, with patients in both groups showing relative stability over time through week 
26 in 6MWD, sitting % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), manual muscle test (MMT) lower extremity, 
Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Physical Function, PROMIS-Fatigue, 
and Gait, Stairs, Gowers’ maneuver, and Chair (GSGC) scores. 
Further data will be available once the ongoing studies (ATB200-02, ATB200-07) are completed and the 
CHMP considered acceptable to submit them as post-authorisation commitment. 
Proposed indication 
The initially claimed indication was “Opfolda is indicated in co-administration with cipaglucosidase alfa for use 
in the long-term treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease 
(acid α-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency).” As per CHMP recommendation during the procedure, the applicant 
revised the wording to reflect the proposed treatment in adult LOPD population as follows:  
Opfolda (miglustat) is an enzyme stabiliser of cipaglucosidase alfa long-term enzyme replacement therapy in 
adults with late-onset Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat was 
demonstrated in adult patients with late-onset Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency) in the proposed 
dosing regimen.

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
No clinical studies were submitted evaluating the safety of cipaglucosidase alfa alone or miglustat alone. The 
safety data are derived from the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. In case an adverse 
event is probably due to one of the components these AE will be presented separately.  
The clinical development program in Pompe disease included 4 clinical studies: study AT2221-01, a 
bioavailability study of miglustat in healthy volunteers, and studies ATB200-02, ATB200-03, and ATB200-07, 
which are studies of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in adult patients (≥ 18 years) with late-onset Pompe 
disease (LOPD). Studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-07 are ongoing.  
Study AT2221-01 was completed in 2018; study ATB200-03 was completed and had a database lock of 
20 January 2021. Study ATB200-02 is ongoing; it had an interim data cut-off of 19 June 2020 and an 
addendum data cut-off of 13 November 2020. Study ATB200-07 is ongoing and had a data cut-off date of 
02 February 2021. As of these safety data cut-off dates, 151 patients have been exposed to co-administered 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat at the proposed dose. The total mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration of 
exposure was 17.2 (12.82) months, and the maximum duration of exposure was 52.2 months. 
To enable an overall evaluation of safety, the safety data were pooled based on the safety population, 
defined as all patients who took at least one dose of study drug. Safety analyses focus on patients treated 
with the intended regimen of 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa intravenous infusion co-administered with 
195/260 mg miglustat oral capsules once every other week. 
Pooled safety data 
Safety data from the Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies were pooled, where appropriate, to enable an overall 
evaluation of safety. 
• 
Safety pool 1 (controlled study ATB200-03): all treated patients in study ATB200-03 (N = 123) 
including the outlying subject from efficacy analyses 
• 
Safety pool 2 (All studies ATB200-02/03/07): all cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated adult 
patients with LOPD (3 studies; N = 151) at the intended regimen. 
In the clinical studies, cipaglucosidase alfa was co-administered with miglustat. In case adverse events were 
reported, it was subsequentially analysed whether respective adverse events were due to combined 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment,cipaglucosidase alfa only, or miglustat only. Below, the general 
exposure and safety data of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat treatment are 
presented first. Adverse drug reactions that were considered related to cipaglucosidase alfa or miglustat only 
are addressed in separate sections. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In safety pool 1, the overall mean [SD] exposure duration was 11.8 [1.5] months. The mean exposure of 
patients who were treated with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat (11.8 months) and those who were treated 
with alglucosidase alfa/placebo (12.0 months) was comparable (Table 12).

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
In general, the occurrence of adverse events tended to be higher in safety pool 2 at a longer treatment 
exposure time (mean 17.3 vs. 11.8 months). Since observed patterns in the occurrence of adverse events in 
both safety pools 1 and 2 were overall comparable, only the occurrence of adverse events in safety pool 1 is 
presented below.

In safety pool 1, the system organ classes of treatment-emergent adverse events were generally similar 
between the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase alfa/placebo groups. The most frequently 
reported system organ classes (> 30% of patients in either treatment group) were infections and 
infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, injury, poisoning, and procedural 
complications, general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous system disorders, 
gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. 
Infections and infestations were reported in 49 (57.6%) patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
and 21 (55.3%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. For the most frequently reported preferred 
terms (> 10% in either treatment group), nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infection occurred more 
frequently in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (19 
[22.4%] and 3 [7.9%] patients, respectively, and 12 [14.1%] and 2 [5.3%)] patients, respectively), while 
upper respiratory tract infection occurred less frequently in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (3 [3.5%] and 6 [15.8%] patients, respectively).  
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were reported in 45 (52.9%) patients in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and 18 (47.4%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. For the most 
frequently reported preferred terms (> 10% in either treatment group), myalgia and arthralgia occurred at 
similar frequencies in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase alfa/placebo groups (14 [16.5%] 
and 5 [13.2%], respectively, and 13 [15.3%] and 5 [13.2%] patients, respectively). Pain in extremity and 
musculoskeletal pain occurred more frequently in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (11 [12.9%] and 2 [5.3%] patients, respectively; and 10 [11.8%] and 2 
[5.3%] patients, respectively).  
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications were reported in 36 (42.4%) patients in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and 18 (47.4%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. Fall was the most 
frequently reported preferred term (> 10% in either treatment group) and occurred less frequently in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (25 [29.4%] and 15 
[39.5%] patients, respectively).

General disorders and administration site conditions were reported in 31 (36.5%) patients in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 14 (36.8%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. 
Fatigue was the most frequently reported preferred term (> 10% in either treatment group) and occurred at 
comparable frequencies in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group 
(8 [9.4%] and 5 [13.2%] patients, respectively). 
Nervous system disorders were reported in 33 (38.8%) patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
and 15 (39.5%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. Headache was the most frequently reported 
preferred term (> 10% in either treatment group) and occurred at similar frequencies in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (20 [23.5%] and 9 [23.7%] patients, 
respectively). 
Gastrointestinal disorders were reported in 28 (32.9%) patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
and 17 (44.7%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. For the most frequently reported preferred 
terms (> 10% in either treatment group), diarrhoea occurred at similar frequencies in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase alfa/placebo groups (11 [12.9%]) and 4 [10.5%], respectively), and nausea 
occurred less frequently in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group (10 [11.8%] and 8 [21.1%] patients, respectively). 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were reported in 29 (34.1%) patients in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and 10 (26.3%) patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. Oropharyngeal pain 
was the most frequently reported preferred term (> 10% in either treatment group) and occurred more 
frequently in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (10 
[11.8%] and 2 [5.3%] patients, respectively). 
Severe Adverse Events 
Eight (9.4%) patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 2 (5.3%) patients in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group had a severe treatment-emergent adverse event (Table 16). 
In patients who received cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat, 13 severe treatment-emergent adverse events were 
reported, each in a single patient. In patients who received alglucosidase alfa/placebo, 3 severe treatment-
emergent adverse events were reported, each in a single patient. 
One case of (accidental) overdose was reported in a patient receiving a 260 mg dose of miglustat/placebo 
and a dose of both cipaglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa due to human error on the part of the 
healthcare professional. There were no complications resulting from the extra doses.

Adverse events of special interest 
The following adverse events of special interest were selected based on known safety profile of other already 
authorised ERTs in Pompe disease and miglustat already authorised in different indications than Pompe 
disease. Since observed patterns in the occurrence of adverse events in both safety pools 1 and 2 were 
overall comparable, further details on the occurrence of adverse events is mainly presented for safety pool 1. 
Gastrointestinal disorders (relevant to both cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat) 
In safety pool 1 (controlled study ATB200-03), 28 (32.9%) cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients 
experienced gastrointestinal disorders treatment-emergent adverse events compared to 17 (44.7%) in 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients.  
Gastrointestinal disorder treatment-emergent adverse events occurring with a higher frequency in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (more than 2% 
difference) included abdominal pain lower (2.4% versus 0.0%, respectively), diarrhoea (12.9% versus 
10.5%, respectively), mouth ulceration (2.4% versus 0.0%, respectively), and vomiting (5.9% versus 2.6%, 
respectively). The proportion of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients who experienced 
gastrointestinal disorders treatment-emergent adverse events tended to be lower for ERT-experienced 
patients compared to ERT-naïve patients (20/65 [30.8%] and 8/20 [40.0%], respectively).  
Cardiac events (relevant to both cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat) 
In study ATB200-02, there were no significant changes in the corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF) or other ECG parameters on ECGs collected immediately following the end of cipaglucosidase alfa 
infusion up to a dosage of 20 mg/kg through up to 24 months of treatment. No patients had QTcF > 450 
msec or QTcF increase from baseline > 60 msec, and 2 patients had QTcF increases from baseline between 
30 to 40 msec. 
In study ATB200-03, no patients have had substantial increases in heart rate, PR, or QRS duration. No 
patients had QTcF change from baseline > 60 msec. Eleven patients had QTcF change from baseline > 30 to 
60 msec (the largest QTcF change from baseline was 40 msec). One patient randomised to alglucosidase alfa 
developed new atrial fibrillation at week 52. No patients developed new right bundle branch block, new left 
bundle branch block, new myocardial infarction, or new ST segment depression. One patient randomised to 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat developed new T wave inversion in leads I and aVL at week 52. 
All incidents of QTc prolongation or changes in other ECG parameters were determined to be cardiac-disease

changes in other ECG parameters.

In safety pool 1, Seventeen (20.0%) cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients experienced anaphylaxis 
treatment-emergent adverse event(s) compared to 11 (28.9%) alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients. 
Among the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients, the most frequent anaphylaxis treatment-
emergent adverse events by preferred term (i.e. occurring in ≥ 2.0% of patients) were dyspnoea (6/85 
[7.1%]), cough (4/85 [4.7%]), flushing (2/85 [2.4%]), pruritus (2/85 [2.4%]), and rash (2/85 [2.4%]). 
Among the alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients, the most frequent anaphylaxis treatment-emergent 
adverse events by preferred term (i.e. occurring in ≥ 2.0% of patients) were pruritus (3/38 [7.9%]), rash 
(3/38 [7.9%]), asthma (1/38 [2.6%]), dyspnoea (1/38 [2.6%]), pharyngeal swelling (1/38 [2.6%]), rash 
erythematous (1/38 [2.6%]), sneezing (1/38 [2.6%]), and throat tightness (1/38 [2.6%]). The proportion of 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients who experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent adverse 
events was similar among ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve patients (13/65 [20.0%] and 4/20 [20.0%], 
respectively).  
Most of the anaphylactic reaction treatment-emergent adverse events in safety pool 1 were non-serious and 
did not lead to discontinuation of study drug.  
One cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patient experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction treatment-
emergent adverse event that led to discontinuation of study drug. This patient experienced a serious 
anaphylactic reaction (verbatim preferred term anaphylactoid reaction) characterised by generalised pruritus, 
urticaria, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, bradycardia, and hypotension that resolved after stopping infusion 
and appropriate management. The patient was ERT experienced, and no premedication was given with the 
prior ERT; the patient did not experience infusion-associated hypersensitivity reactions with previous ERT 
treatment.  
One other cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patient was discontinued due to a non-serious anaphylactic 
reaction treatment-emergent adverse event. This patient was discontinued from the study (investigator 
decision) following several reported non-serious infusion-associated reactions, including urticaria and 
CHMP assessment report

pruritus. The patient was ERT experienced, and no pre-medications had been given with the prior ERT. The 
patient had experienced past infusion-associated reactions with prior ERT.  
No other anaphylactic reaction treatment-emergent adverse events in study ATB200-03 were serious, and no 
other anaphylactic reaction treatment-emergent adverse events led to discontinuation of study drug. 
In addition to safety pool 1, three other cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients from safety pool 2 
experienced serious anaphylactic reaction treatment-emergent adverse events, all of which resolved. Two of 
the patients were discontinued from the studies. The third patient (study ATB200-02) experienced chills, 
cough, dyspnoea, flushing, urticaria, and wheezing that were successfully managed and the patient was able 
to continue in the study.  
Among the ERT-naïve cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients in safety pool 2 (N = 34), most of the 
patients experienced anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity treatment-emergent adverse events within the first 
8 months of treatment. Six of 34 (17.6%) patients experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent adverse 
events within > 0 to 4 months, and 5/30 (16.7%) patients experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent 
adverse events within > 4 to 8 months. Two of 28 (7.1%) patients experienced anaphylaxis treatment-
emergent adverse events within > 8 to 12 months after starting treatment, 3/26 (11.5%) patients 
experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent adverse events within > 12 to 16 months, 2/13 (15.4%) 
patients experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent adverse events within > 16 to 20 months, 
2/7 (28.6%) patients experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent adverse events within > 20 to 
24 months, and 1/6 (16.7%) patient experienced anaphylaxis treatment-emergent adverse events within 
> 24 months after starting treatment.

Among the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients, the most frequent infusion-associated reactions 
by preferred term (i.e. occurring in ≥ 2.0% of patients in either treatment group) were dizziness (4/85 
[4.7%]), abdominal distension (3/85 [3.5%]), and headache (3/85 [3.5%]), and the following preferred

terms occurring in 2 patients (2.4%) each: chills, diarrhoeal, dysgeusia, dyspnoea, flushing, pruritus, 
pyrexia, and rash. Among the alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients, the most frequent infusion-
associated reactions by preferred term (i.e. occurring in ≥ 2.0% of patients) were dizziness (2/38 [5.3%]), 
fatigue (2/38 [5.3%]), headache (2/38 [5.3%]), and nausea (2/38 [5.3%]), and the following preferred 
terms occurring in 1 patient (2.6%) each: abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, asthenia, dyspepsia, 
feeling hot, infusion site erythema, migraine, migraine with aura, myalgia, pain, pruritus, rash papular, 
pyrexia, restlessness, and throat tightness. The proportion of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients 
who experienced infusion-associated reactions was similar for ERT-experienced patients versus ERT-naïve 
patients (16/65 [24.6%] versus 5/20 [25.0%], respectively). 
Most of the reported infusion-associated reactions (7/8) in study ATB200-03 were non-serious. One 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patient (1/85 [1.2%]) experienced a serious infusion-associated 
reaction, compared to no alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients (0/38 [0.0%]). This serious infusion-
associated reaction (anaphylactoid reaction) was characterised by generalised pruritus, urticaria, difficulty in 
breathing, dizziness, bradycardia, and hypotension and resolved after stopping the infusion and appropriate 
management. This patient was discontinued from the study as a result of this infusion-associated reaction.  
In addition to safety pool 1, five cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients from safety pool 2 
experienced serious infusion-associated reaction(s): one patient with pharyngeal oedema and urticaria (study 
ATB200-02), one patient with pyrexia (study ATB200-02), one patient with chills, cough, dyspnoea, flushing, 
urticaria, and wheezing (study ATB200-02), one patient with presyncope (study ATB200-02), one patient 
with hypotension and urticaria (study ATB200-07). Most infusion-associated reactions were medically 
managed such that the patients were able to continue on cipaglucosidase alfa. Only 4 cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat-treated patients experienced infusion-associated reactions during or after cipaglucosidase alfa 
infusions that led to study drug discontinuation. These are the same 4 patients who were discontinued due to 
anaphylactic reaction treatment-emergent adverse events described above. 
Immune-mediated reactions (relevant to cipaglucosidase alfa) 
Potential immune-mediated reactions were identified from the clinical trial database, based on company-
selected terms suggestive of a type III immune-mediated reaction, for safety pool 1 and 2. The following 
preferred terms were applied: arthritis, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, 
glomerulonephritis, haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, purpura, skin lesion, 
skin necrosis, type III immune complex mediated reaction, and vasculitis. 
In safety pool 1, few potential immune-mediated reactions were identified. Among cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat-treated patients, 1 (1.2%) patient experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of 
arthritis (within >4 to 8 months after starting cipaglucosidase alfa). Among 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients, 1 (2.6%) patient experienced proteinuria, and 2 (5.3%) patients 
experienced skin lesion.  
Hypersensitivity reactions (relevant to cipaglucosidase alfa) 
Table 19 summarises the anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity treatment-emergent adverse events and ERT 
experience, based on the anaphylactic reaction standardised MedDRA query (SMQ)(narrow and broad terms)

In safety pool 1, 15 (17.6%) cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients experienced hypersensitivity 
treatment-emergent adverse events compared to 14 (36.8%) of alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients. 
Among the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients, the most frequent hypersensitivity treatment-
emergent adverse events by preferred term (i.e. occurring in ≥ 2.0% of patients) were conjunctivitis (2/85 
[2.4%]), flushing (2/85 [2.4%]), mouth ulceration (2/85 [2.4%]), pruritus (2/85 [2.4%]), and rash (2/85 
[2.4%]).  
Among the alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients, the most frequent hypersensitivity treatment-
emergent adverse events by preferred term (i.e. occurring in ≥ 2.0% of patients) were pruritus (3/38 
[7.9%]), rash (3/38 [7.9%]), application site eczema (1/38 [2.6%]), application site rash (1/38 [2.6%]), 
asthma (1/38 [2.6%]), dermatitis (1/38, [2.6%]), dermatitis allergic (1/38, [2.6%]), dermatitis contact 
(1/38 [2.6%]), eosinophil count increased (1/38 [2.6%]), infusion site rash (1/38 [2.6%]), pharyngeal 
swelling (1/38 [2.6%]), rash erythematous (1/38 [2.6%]), sneezing (1/38 [2.6%]), and throat tightness 
(1/38 [2.6%]).  
Among the ERT-naïve cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients in safety pool 2, most of the patients 
experienced anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity treatment-emergent adverse events within the first 8 months 
of treatment. Four of 34 (11.8%) patients experienced hypersensitivity treatment-emergent adverse events 
within > 0 to 4 months, and 4/30 (13.3%) patients experienced hypersensitivity treatment-emergent 
adverse events within > 4 to 8 months. Two of 28 (7.1%) patients experienced hypersensitivity treatment-
emergent adverse events within > 8 to 12 months, 2/26 (7.7%) patients experienced hypersensitivity 
treatment-emergent adverse events within > 12 to 16 months, 2/13 (15.4%) patients experienced

patients experienced hypersensitivity treatment-emergent adverse events within > 24 months after starting 
treatment. 
Tremor (may be relevant to miglustat) 
In safety pool 1, 2 (2.4%) cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients experienced tremor treatment-
emergent adverse event(s) compared to 0 (0.0%) alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated patients. The tremor 
treatment-emergent adverse events occurred within the first 4 months of treatment. 
Peripheral neuropathy (may be relevant to miglustat) 
Peripheral neuropathy treatment-emergent adverse events were not identified in the clinical trial database. 
Treatment-related adverse events 
The reported adverse drug reactions were attributed to cipaglucosidase alfa, miglustat, or both 
cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. The primary assessment with respect to adverse drug reactions was made 
by the study investigator. Potential adverse drug reactions that were identified by the investigator were 
subsequentially reviewed by the applicant. Some treatment-emergent adverse events that were assessed as 
treatment-related by the investigator were refuted as adverse drug reactions upon in-depth review by the 
applicant (based upon lack of biological plausibility, confounding medical history, or improbable drug event-
causal relationship). 
In safety pool 1, the incidence of drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events tended to be lower in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat as compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (26 [30.6%] and 14 
[36.8%] patients, respectively). See Table 20.  
In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group, the most frequently reported drug-related treatment-emergent 
adverse events (i.e. considered related to cipaglucosidase alfa or miglustat) were in the system organ class 
of nervous system disorders (14 [16.5%] patients), and the most frequently reported drug-related 
treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (6 [7.1%] patients).  
In the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group, the most frequently reported drug-related treatment-emergent 
adverse events (i.e. considered related to alglucosidase alfa or placebo) were in the system organ class of 
gastrointestinal disorders (8 [21.1%] patients), and the most frequently reported drug-related treatment-
emergent adverse event was nausea (5 [13.2%] patients).

Abbreviations: CSR = clinical study report; MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N = total number of 
patients; n = number of patients in category indicated; PT = preferred term; SOC = system organ class; 
TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event 
Note: A TEAE was defined as any event that started or changed in intensity on or after the first dose of study drug. 
Note: “Related” included definite, probable, and possibly related; “not related” included unlikely and unrelated. 
Note: If a patient experienced more than 1 TEAE with different relationship categories within the same SOC/PT, only the 
worst case (related TEAE) was reported. 
Note: The pooled designation (in the total column) was considered “related” if the 2 categories of the individual 
relationships were discordant (i.e. “related” to one and “not related” to the other); the pooled designation (in the total 
column) was concordant with the individual categories if the 2 categories of the individual relationships are concordant 
(i.e. “related” to both, or “not related” to both). 
Note: If relationship was missing, it was classified as “related.” 
Note: SOCs and PTs were coded with MedDRA Version 23.0. 
Note: Percentages were based on the number of patients in each treatment group for the Safety Population. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In safety pool 1, 9 (7.3%) patients had at least 1 treatment-emergent serious adverse event: 8 (9.4%) 
patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 1 (2.6%) patient in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo 
group (Table 21). 
In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group, the system organ class of gastrointestinal disorders had the 
largest number of patients with treatment-emergent serious adverse events (abdominal pain, enteritis, and 
vomiting in 1 patient each). In the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group, no treatment-emergent serious 
adverse event was experienced by more than one patient. The single treatment-emergent serious adverse 
event in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group was a cerebrovascular accident. 
The treatment-emergent serious adverse event of anaphylactoid reaction was the only treatment-emergent 
serious adverse event in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group considered to be treatment-related. This 
treatment-emergent serious adverse event also led to study treatment discontinuation. 
No study drug-related treatment-emergent serious adverse event was reported in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology  
In safety pool 1, the proportion of patients meeting predefined limits of change criteria was low and similar 
between the treatment groups. No meaningful trends were observed for haemoglobin, platelets, leukocytes 
and eosinophils/leukocytes parameters in the clinical studies. 
Clinical chemistry evaluations 
In safety pool 1, transient changes were noted with a low proportion of patients for all predefined criteria 
except for changes in absolute creatine kinase (CK) values in the category 2× upper limit of normal (ULN) 
range or ≥ 2× baseline visit (54.1% of patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and 78.9% of 
patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group). Of note, CK levels above the ULN are expected in the LOPD 
population, as increased elevated CK can be indicative of muscle injury. 
No patient met Hy’s Law criteria (ALT or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] > 3 × ULN + total bilirubin > 2 × 
ULN + alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 × ULN) as no patient met ALT or AST > 3 × ULN + total bilirubin > 2 × ULN. 
Urinalysis 
No meaningful trends in mean changes were observed for urinalysis variables over time in the clinical studies. 
Vital signs 
No meaningful changes in vital signs were observed over time in the safety pool 1. Transient changes were 
noted with a low proportion of patients for all predefined criteria except for changes in body weight in the 
category of > 5% increase from baseline (24 [28.2%] patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
and 7 [18.4%] patients in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group). 
Electrocardiograms 
In safety pool 1, few patients in either treatment group experienced a change in QT interval corrected using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) > 30 msec, and no patient experienced a change > 60 msec. No patient in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group had an absolute QTcF > 480 msec; 1 patient in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group had an absolute QTcF > 500 msec. 
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
No data have been submitted regarding in vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety. It is noted that 
the diagnosis of Pompe disease in the pivotal study ATB200-03 was either based on deficiency of the GAA 
enzyme, or GAA genotyping. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
No formal studies were conducted in special populations. 
The disposition of cipaglucosidase alfa is not expected to be impacted by hepatic or renal impairment.  
Severe treatment-emergent adverse events tend to occur more frequently upon cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat than alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment in female (10.2% versus 0%, respectively) but not 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023

in male patients with Pompe disease (8.3% and 10%, respectively) in pool 1. Based on review of these 
severe treatment-emergent adverse event cases reported in female subjects and the severe treatment-
emergent adverse events reported in male subjects treated with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat, there are no 
safety concerns suggestive of a gender effect. The difference in female subjects was considered a chance 
finding due to the low number of patients and events (5 cases in females and 3 cases in males). 
One ERT-naïve patient with Pompe disease became pregnant during study treatment with 
cipaglucosidase/miglustat. Study treatment was discontinued, and an elective abortion was conducted. The 
patient completed study participation 
In safety pool 1, there were no meaningful differences between ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve patients with 
respect to the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, discontinuations due to treatment-emergent 
adverse events, drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse 
events, infusion-associated treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs. 
Nevertheless, a lower proportion of ERT-experienced patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
were reported to meet predefined criteria for changes in body weight in the category of > 5% increase from 
baseline compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (23.1% versus 45.0%, respectively). The 
percentage of patients with treatment-emergent serious adverse events also appeared to be higher in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group for both ERT-
experienced and ERT-naïve patients (ERT-experienced: 9.2% versus 3.3%, respectively; ERT-naïve: 10.0% 
versus 0%, respectively).  
In safety pool 1, there were no meaningful differences across regions with respect to the incidence of 
treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, discontinuation due to 
treatment-emergent adverse events, most laboratory values, most vital signs, and ECGs. The following 
differences were observed for drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse 
events associated with infusion, CK values, and body weight:  
The incidence of drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events tended to be lower for the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo in North/South America (26.9% versus 
46.7%, respectively) but was similar between the treatment groups in Europe (30.2% and 25.0%, 
respectively) and Asia Pacific (37.5% and 36.4%, respectively). 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events associated with infusion tended to be lower in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group in North/South 
America (26.9% versus 40.0%, respectively), but it was similar between the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat 
and alglucosidase alfa/placebo groups for Europe (18.6% and 16.7%, respectively) and Asia Pacific (37.5% 
and 18.2%, respectively). 
A difference between treatment groups in proportion of patients with body weight > 5% increase from 
baseline tended to be observed in North America, where 30.8% of patients in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group had a body weight > 5% increase from baseline compared to 6.7% in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group.  
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
The effect of immunogenicity on safety was assessed using data from studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-03. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 89/108 
 
 
 
 
 
Across studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-03, the anti-drug antibody prevalence (defined as the proportion of all 
individuals having drug-reactive total antibodies, including pre-existing antibodies at any point in time) was 
92.1% (140/152) in all patients (100% of the 152 patients were evaluable); the anti-drug antibody 
prevalence was 93.9% (107/114) for patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa and 86.8% (33/38) for 
patients treated with alglucosidase alfa across both studies.  
Across both studies, the anti-drug antibody incidence (defined as the proportion of the study population 
found to have seroconverted or boosted their pre-existing anti-drug antibody during the study period, sum of 
both treatment-induced and treatment-boosted anti-drug antibody-positive patients as a proportion of the 
evaluable patient population) was 65.8% (75/114) for patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa and 34.2% 
(13/38) for patients treated with alglucosidase alfa. 
No obvious differences in overall, and stratified (by study, ERT history, GAA genotype, gender, or age) anti-
rhGAA antibody incidence, titre, and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) were observed. 
Overall, there was no clear trend in infusion-associated reaction occurrence with the incidence of anti-rhGAA 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) or total anti-rhGAA antibodies. 
In study ATB200-07, all 11 patients (7 patients randomly assigned to cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and 
4 patients randomly assigned to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment in Study ATB200-03 that were ERT-
naïve when they entered Study ATB200-03) continued to show positive specific anti-drug antibodies and 
titres up to 6 (n = 3), 12 (n = 6), or 26 weeks (n = 2) in this ongoing long-term extension study. All 
11 patients were positive specific for antibodies cross-reactive to alglucosidase alfa at some (n = 1) or all 
time points (n = 3) in the study. The majority of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated patients were positive 
for at least 1 of 3 types of NAbs after treatment. No infusion-associated reactions were observed at any of 
the study visits for any of these 11 patients in study ATB200-07. These results are consistent with the overall 
antibody results for ERT-experienced patients in studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-03. 
As already mentioned, potential immune-mediated reactions were identified from the clinical trial database, 
based on selected terms suggestive of a type III immune-mediated reaction. 
Approximately half of patients with cipaglucosidase alfa anti-rhGAA anti-drug antibodies were found to be 
positive for cross-reactive alglucosidase alfa ADA (CRADA), and vice versa. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted using co-administered cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat, 
which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five patients discontinued from the studies due to adverse events: 2 in study ATB200-02, 2 in study ATB200-
03 (pool 1), and 1 in study ATB200-07 only. In addition, one patient discontinued from study ATB200-03 due 
to an adverse event and subsequently enrolled in study ATB200-07. 
In safety pool 1, 3 patients in the cipaglucosidase alfa/ miglustat group and 1 patient in the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo group discontinued due to an adverse event as follows: COVID-19–related pneumonia (not drug 
related), infusion-associated reaction/anaphylactic event (probably drug related) and infusion associated 
CHMP assessment report

reaction/chills (drug related). In the alglucosidase alfa group, the adverse event leading to discontinuation 
was a stroke unrelated to study drug. 
The patient who discontinued due to adverse events in study ATB200-07, switched from alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo in study ATB200-03 to cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in study ATB200-07 and had 2 treatment-
emergent serious adverse events (angioedema (reported verbatim as “giant urticaire”; clinical safety 
database reconciliation outstanding: recoding to “urticaria” ongoing) and hypotension), which led to study 
drug interruption on day 1 of the study ATB200-07.  
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
No post marketing experience for the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat treatment is 
known.  
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Since cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat were administered in combination in conducted clinical studies, it is 
not possible to determine the contribution of each active component to the overall safety profile.  
One hundred and fifty-one (151) patients were treated with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa in combination 
with 260 mg miglustat once every two weeks. In the controlled study ATB200-03 (pool 1), 62 patients were 
exposed to cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat for more than one year. In pooled studies ATB200-02/03/07 (pool 
2), the exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat was at least one year in 108 patients, and at least 2 years 
in 22 patients at the data lock-point (DLP).  
The number of patients treated with the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat at the 
recommended dosing regimen (n=151) is limited for a safety database and is expected since Pompe disease 
is rare (incidence about 1/40,000).1 Further data will be available once the ongoing studies (ATB200-02, 
ATB200-07) are completed, and these are part of the additional pharmacovigilance activities to characterise 
the long-term use beyond 2 years. In addition, the applicant agreed to put in place a prospective 
observational registry of patients with Pompe disease to collect long term data in real world evidence setting 
(see 2.7). 
The safety profile of miglustat in the authorised indications type 1 Gaucher disease and Niemann-Pick type C 
disease is well-known. The Cmax after administration of a single dose of 260 mg miglustat (3,000 ng/ml) is 
numerically lower compared to administration of a single dose of miglustat approved in type 1 Gaucher 
disease and Niemann-Pick type C disease. In addition, the approved miglustat dosing (100 mg or 200 three 
times daily based on the authorised indications) is higher than the miglustat dosing that is proposed for 
Pompe disease (260 mg once every 2 weeks) in the present application. The total miglustat exposure per 2 
weeks for proposed Pompe disease indication (260 mg) is 3.1-6.2% of that for currently authorised miglustat 
indications. Due to the lower Cmax and AUC of miglustat for the intended use in co-administration with 
cipaglucosidase alfa in Pompe disease as compared to the miglustat currently approved in other indications, 
the safety profile of miglustat at recommended dosing for the intended use in co-administration with

cipaglucosidase alfa in Pompe disease is expected to be more favourable than the miglustat dosing for the 
other (approved) indications. 
In conducted clinical studies, the Cmax of a cipaglucosidase alfa dosage of 20 mg/kg was 325 µg/ml. Upon 
administration of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat the Cmax ranged from 323-345 µg/ml. 
Considering the addition of miglustat to cipaglucosidase alfa had no or limited impact on the Cmax of 
cipaglucosidase alfa, the safety profile of miglustat in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa is not expected to 
be much different compared to that of cipaglucosidase alfa alone. 
In general, the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) tended to be higher at a longer 
treatment exposure time (mean 17.3 vs. 11.8 months). For example, the occurrence of severe treatment-
emergent adverse events (9.4 vs. 13.2%), treatment-related adverse events (30.6 vs. 41.1%), anaphylactic 
reactions (20.0 vs. 29.1%), infusion-associated reactions (24.7 vs. 28.5%), and hypersensitivity reactions 
(17.6 vs. 21.9%) upon cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment tended to be lower in safety pool 1 as 
compared to safety pool 2 respectively.  
However, the pattern of observed treatment-emergent adverse events from the analysed safety populations 
(pools 1 and 2) was comparable and the data from the pivotal study ATB200-03 (pool 1) is consequently 
used to characterise the safety profile of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat.  
The most common TEAEs in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group were fall (29.4%), headache (23.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (22.4%), and myalgia (16.5%).  
The occurrence of severe TEAEs tended to be about twice as high in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group 
(9.4%) compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (5.3%). Each severe treatment-emergent adverse 
event was observed in a single patient. One severe treatment-emergent adverse event in the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group (anaphylactoid reaction) was considered to be treatment-related, compared to none in 
the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. Nevertheless, since almost all severe treatment-emergent adverse 
events were considered unrelated to study drug, the observed trend for an increased occurrence of severe 
treatment-emergent adverse events upon treatment with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat as compared to 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo has limited impact on the overall safety profile of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat.  
Furthermore,  the  incidence  of  treatment-related  adverse  events  tended  to  be  lower  in  the  cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat as compared to the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group (30.6 and 36.8% patients, respectively). 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  upon  cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat included headache (7.1%), diarrhoea (5.9%), and dizziness (4.7%).  
The  occurrence  of  anaphylactic  reactions  (20.0  vs.  28.9%),  infusion-associated  reactions  (24.7  vs.  26.3%), 
and  hypersensitivity  reactions  (17.6  vs.  36.8%)  tended  to  occur  less  frequently  upon  cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment.  
The occurrence of anaphylactic reactions (both 20%), and infusion-associated reactions (24.6 vs. 25.0%) 
were observed at similar frequencies in respectively ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve patients. However, 
hypersensitivity reactions tended to occur less frequently among ERT-experienced compared to ERT-naïve 
patients (15.4 vs. 25.0% respectively). This difference may be explained by the fact that hypersensitivity 
reactions in Pompe disease develop with time (Toh et al. 2020). In addition, this finding may also be related 
to Pompe disease patients who have experienced hypersensitivity to ERT may be less likely to participate in a 
clinical study on a new ERT-based therapy for Pompe disease.

One case of (accidental) overdose was reported in a patient receiving a 260 mg dose of miglustat/placebo 
and a dose of both cipaglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa due to human error on the part of the 
healthcare professional. There were no complications resulting from the extra doses. 
The occurrence of gastro-intestinal treatment-emergent adverse events which may be due to both 
cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat tended to be lower upon cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment (32.9%) 
compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment (44.7%). Tremor, a known adverse drug reaction of 
miglustat tended to be observed more frequently upon cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat (2.4%) compared to 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment (0%). Tremor has been included in the list of adverse drug reactions.  
No death was reported in all the safety population sets. 
In general, predefined significant changes in haematology and clinical chemistry evaluations, and urinalysis 
tended to occur at lower or comparable rates for cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat as compared to alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo treatment.  
No patients have had substantial increases in heart rate, PR, or QRS duration. All incidents of QTc 
prolongation or changes in other ECG parameters were considered cardiac disease related. With respect to 
other vital signs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure between cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo groups were comparable. However, abnormal changes in weight appeared to be 
reported more frequently among patients who were treated with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat as compared 
to those who were treated with alglucosidase alfa/placebo, especially in female patients. Upon further 
analysis, no clinically relevant confounders were identified that could explain the opposing weight change 
trend observed in alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated female patients. Given the similar trend in the mean and 
median increase in baseline weight observed across both male and female cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-
treated patients and in alglucosidase alfa/placebo-treated male patients, the difference in weight change 
between cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat and alglucosidase alfa/placebo groups (especially in females) is likely 
a chance finding and attributable to the small sample sizes in the gender subgroups. 
In general, there were no remarkable differences with respect to gender, age, ERT status or regions with 
respect to the incidence of TEAEs, laboratory or ECG test results. However, severe TEAEs were reported more 
frequently upon cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat than alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment in female (10.2% 
versus 0%, respectively) but not in male patients with (8.3% and 10%, respectively). Based on review of 
these severe TEAEs reported in female subjects and in male subjects treated with cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat, there are no safety concerns suggestive of a gender effect. The difference in female subjects 
is considered a chance finding due to the low number of patients and events (5 cases in females and 3 cases 
in males). 
Safety was not evaluated with regard to race due to the low numbers of patients in the non-Caucasian 
categories, each accounting for <5% of the safety population in safety pool 2. 
No signal emerged from the review of TEAE in elderly patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat. 
However, no definitive conclusions can be drawn on the safety of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in patients 
aged ≥ 65 years due to the relatively low number of patients in this demographic group (n = 11) and the 
lack of patients aged ≥ 75 years.  
The proportions of patients who had any treatment-related TEAEs were reported upon treatment with 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment appeared to be lower for ERT-experienced compared to ERT-naïve 
patients in safety pool 1 (29.2 vs. 35.0%), and also in safety pool 2 (40.2 vs. 44.1%). Analysis of safety 
CHMP assessment report

profiles in both pools (i.e., treatment naïve and experienced) did not show a significant difference in the 
nature, seriousness, and distribution of treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events experienced 
by subjects. The observed differences between the incidence rate of treatment-related TEAEs in ERT-naïve 
versus ERT-experienced patients were mostly attributed to non-serious treatment-related treatment-
emergent adverse events, which are listed adverse drug reactions for other ERT products and are proposed 
adverse drug reactions for the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat use in combination.  
There  were  no  reports  of  paresthesia  and  peripheral  neuropathy  related  to  miglustat.  Reports  related  to 
miglustat only were: abdominal discomfort, constipation, feeling jittery, and platelet count decreased and these 
are included as ADRs in the SmPC in addition to those reported in the clinical studies and attributable to the 
co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. 
One pregnancy in an ERT-naïve patient with Pompe disease was reported during study treatment with 
cipaglucosidase/miglustat. Study treatment was discontinued, and an elective abortion was conducted. The 
patient completed study participation. Based on animal studies, cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with 
miglustat therapy is not recommended during pregnancy. More information on special populations of interest 
such as pregnant or lactating women treated with cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat co-administration are 
planned to be collected as part of additional pharmacovigilance activities. In particular, the applicant agreed 
to put in place a prospective observational registry of patients with Pompe disease to collect long term data 
in real world evidence setting (see 2.7). 
The anti-drug antibody prevalence tended to be higher for patients who were treated with cipaglucosidase 
alfa (93.9%) compared to those who were treated with alglucosidase alfa (86.8%) in studies ATB200-02 and 
ATB200-03. A similar trend was observed with respect to the anti-drug antibody incidence during the first 
year of treatment (65.8 vs. 34.2%). However, there was no clear trend in infusion-associated reaction 
occurrence with the incidence of anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin E (IgE) or total anti-rhGAA antibodies. Hence, 
there is thus so far no evidence that respective antibodies affect the overall safety profile of cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat treatment to a clinically relevant extent.  
Approximately half of patients with cipaglucosidase alfa anti-rhGAA anti-drug antibodies were found to be 
positive for cross-reactive alglucosidase alfa ADA (CRADA), and vice versa. These results indicate that most 
CRADA positive patients treated with the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat did not have 
hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or infusion-associated reactions (20 to 32% of CRADA-positive subjects 
experienced such events). Proportions of CRADA-positive patients were similar between patients with and 
without hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or infusion-associated reactions, indicating no clear association 
between these immune reactions and CRADA. Immunomodulation/desensitisation protocols are often used in 
IOPD patients. Such protocols were not used in ATB200-03 study setting, considering the adult LOPD 
population included. Therefore, there was no influence of any immunomodulation/ desensitisation protocols 
on the occurrence of anaphylactic reactions, infusion-associated reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions in 
each treatment group that could be shown in the ATB200-03 study setting. 
Due to the nature of the product, it is not expected that drug abuse, withdrawal and rebound are likely to 
occur. No information on these aspects is available for the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and 
miglustat and this is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on new indication and patient population for miglustat to be used only in combination with 
cipaglucosidase alfa, the PRAC is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Opfolda is needed, 
as it cannot follow the already existing entry for miglustat. The requirements for submission of periodic safety 
update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The 
applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the European Birth Date (EBD) for 
cipaglucosidase alfa. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD for cipaglucosidase alfa to determine 
the forthcoming data lock points.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Opfolda (miglustat) is an enzyme stabiliser of cipaglucosidase alfa long-term enzyme replacement therapy in 
adults with late-onset Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency). 
Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid 
alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Defects in both alleles of the gene for GAA, located on chromosome 17q25, result 
in reduced or absent enzyme activity, leading to progressive intralysosomal accumulation of undegraded 
glycogen. The resulting damage to affected cells produces a range of symptoms that characterise Pompe 
disease, including metabolic myopathy leading to neuromuscular dysfunction.  
Currently, over 500 mutations of GAA, have been found. Clinical presentation of Pompe disease is 
heterogeneous in timing, severity, and ranges of symptoms observed and is dependent on the residual 
enzyme activity. The disease is classified into different phenotypes based on age at the onset of symptoms, 
the extent of organ involvement, and the rate of progression to death. The phenotypes range from a rapidly 
progressive infantile-onset form (IOPD) characterised by virtually complete absence (less than 1%) of acid 
alpha-glucosidase (GAA)-activity to a more slowly progressive late-onset form (LOPD). This application 
considers adult patients with LOPD only. No information on IOPD patients who are currently treated with 
alglucosidase alfa was submitted.  
The majority of patients with Pompe disease present after infancy with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), 
which takes a more variable course. In untreated patients, undegraded glycogen accumulates in the 
diaphragm and respiratory muscles, and respiratory function declines over time, leading to dependence on 
external ventilation and, ultimately, to respiratory failure, the most common cause of death regardless of the 
age of disease onset. Glycogen also accumulates in skeletal muscles, and motor function declines over time, 
leading to problems with activities of daily living, reduced mobility, and eventually dependence on a 
wheelchair. Quality of life is usually severely affected by the burden of the disease. 
The aim of new treatments is to serve as an alternative for the already registered alglucosidase alfa, or to 
further slowdown deterioration observed in adult LOPD patients treated with alglucosidase alfa.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The development and approval of ERT have profoundly changed the natural course of the disease, 
considerably extending productivity and quality of life for patients with LOPD. However, it is recognised that 
the progressive decline in muscle function in patients with Pompe disease is not completely abrogated with 
alglucosidase alfa ERT. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/221337/2023 
Page 99/108 
 
 
 
 
 
Studies in LOPD patients suggest that some patients on alglucosidase alfa continue to exhibit some decline in 
respiratory function, albeit at a slower pace than prior to treatment. After the start of ERT the patients 
described a transitory effect, more stabilisation of symptoms than a recovery. Those who could increase the 
dose reported a more tangible effect after the dose increase. Some had no effect and could not try a higher 
dose. Thus, responses to treatment in LOPD patients vary, and there might be room for improvement, but 
overall, there is not a huge unmet medical need in this population.  
Cipaglucosidase alfa (ATB200, rhGAA) is developed as a next-generation ERT for Pompe disease. 
Cipaglucosidase alfa contains higher amounts of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), which is the natural motif for 
identifying and transporting soluble lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes, as compared to alglucosidase alfa. 
Importantly, cipaglucosidase alfa contains bis-phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharide structures, 
which are known to have the highest affinity of all known carbohydrates for the cation-independent mannose 
6 phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). This specialised glycosylation leads to better binding to the CI-MPR (Tong 
and Kornfeld, 1989) on cell surfaces, which mediates the internalisation and delivery of exogenous rhGAA to 
lysosomes, particularly at low enzyme concentrations in muscles post-dosing. Like all lysosomal enzymes, 
cipaglucosidase alfa is unstable at neutral pH and denatured and inactivated in the bloodstream following 
intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Miglustat (AT2221, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin) is a small-molecule enzyme stabiliser that binds to and 
prevents the inactivation of the cipaglucosidase alfa enzyme in the blood. Based on the knowledge of the 
metabolic pathway leading to the accumulation of glycogen miglustat cannot be considered a substrate 
reduction therapy (SRT), miglustat alone has no specific effects on the burden of diseases in the group of 
glycogen storage diseases (for example McArdle, von Gierke and Pompe disease).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal evidence comes from one double-blind, randomised, multicentre, superiority study (ATB200-03) 
including 123 adult subjects with LOPD in which the clinical effects of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat (N= 85) 
were compared with those of alglucosidase alfa/placebo (n=38). Most patients had received prior enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) (cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat: 65 of 85 patients, alglucosidase alfa/placebo: 30 
of 38 patients). Patients were treated with cipaglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg combined with miglustat 
195/260mg every other week or alglucosidase alfa 20mg/kg every other week. Besides the well-known 
endpoints for Pompe disease (6-minute walking test (6MWT) and forced vital capacity (FVC)), motor function, 
respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life were measured. The treatment duration in study 
ATB200-03 was 52 weeks. 
No children were included in the study. No patients with IOPD were studied. 
Results from study ATB200-02, an ongoing Phase 1/2, open-label, fixed-sequence first-in-human study, are 
considered supportive. This also applies to the ongoing open-label extension study ATB200-07 in which

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Using the originally presented MMRM analysis for the primary endpoint (6MWD) based on remapped visits 
and excluding the outlying subject as presented by the applicant, the estimated mean treatment difference 
(95%CI) excluding the outlying subject is +14.2 m (-2.6, 31.0) with a two-sided p-value of 0.097, favouring 
the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat arm.  
After 52 weeks of treatment with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat in the ITT-OBS population using the most 
adequate and reliable MMRM method based on the actual time point of assessments and excluding the 
outlying subject, the least square (LS) mean change from baseline for the 6MWD (primary endpoint) in the 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group was 20.0 m (95% CI 13.1, 26.9) (primary endpoint) versus 8.3 m (95% 
CI -2.2, 18.8) in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The estimated mean treatment difference is 11.7 m 
(95% CI -1.0, 24.4) with a two-sided p-value of 0.07. The LS mean change from baseline for the sitting 
predicted %FVC showed a change of -1.4% (95% CI -2.5, -0.3) (key secondary endpoint) versus -3.7% 
(95% CI -5.4, -2.0) in the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The estimated mean difference (95% CI) 
between the treatments after 52 weeks was 3.0% (0.6%, 5.5%). 
For the remaining key secondary endpoints (MMT, PROMIS-Physical Function, PROMIS-fatigue and GSGC), 
results reported are more or less in line with the results of the 6MWT and the sitting %FVC and further 
support the conclusion that the effects obtained with cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat appeared to be 
reasonably robust and consistent.  
In the ERT-experienced study population (n=95), using the same model, the LS mean improvement observed 
in the 6MWD during the first year of treatment was +15.8m (95% CI 8.3, 23.4) for the cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat group and +0.9m (95% CI -10.2, 12.1) for the alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The LS mean 
treatment difference was 14.9 m (95% CI 1.2, 28.6) in favour of the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat-treated 
patients. Analysing the sitting predicted %FVC the LS mean difference at week 52 as compared to baseline 
was -0.2 (95% CI -1.5, 1.1) in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group and -3.8 (95% CI -5.7, -1.9) in the 
alglucosidase alfa/placebo group. The estimated LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) was 3.6% (95% CI 
1.3, 5.9). 
In the ERT naïve population (n= 27) using the same model, the LS mean improvement was +28.5 m (95% 
CI 12.4, 44.7) in the 20 ERT-naïve subjects who received cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat. In the alglucosidase 
alfa/placebo control group (n = 7) the LS mean improvement was 52.7 m (95% CI 23.2, 82.3). The LS mean 
treatment difference (95% CI) for the change to week 52 in 6MWD was -24.2 (-60.0, 11.7). The LS means 
for the change to week 52 in sitting % predicted FVC was -5.2 (95% CI -7.5, -2.9) for cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat, and -2.4 (95% CI -6.7, 1.8). The LS mean treatment difference was -2.8 (95% CI -7.8, 2.3). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Apart from 11 patients in study ATB200-02 who received a single dose of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase 
alfa, no information on cipaglucosidase alfa monotherapy is available. Study ATB002-02 is of limited value for 
the evaluation of the dose response of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat. Due to the non-
randomised, open-label nature of study ATB002-02, and the limited number of patients (n= 29 divided over 4 
cohorts), no definitive conclusions can be made with respect to a potential dose-response relationship for the 
endpoints measured.

The contribution of miglustat itself to the clinical effects of the co- administration of miglustat and 
cipaglucosidase alfa in human LOPD patients is unknown since cipaglucosidase alfa on its own has not been 
evaluated in human LOPD patients. Despite a lack of clear pharmacokinetic rationale for adding miglustat, the 
clinical relevance of the co-administration cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat has been established based on 
the most adequate and reliable efficacy data (see above). An approximate 7% to 30% increases in AUC upon 
the addition of miglustat in rodent models were associated with a 50% increase in grip strength-wire hang in 
conducted non-clinical studies. These findings support, in theory, an additive value of miglustat to the clinical 
effects of cipaglucosidase alfa in human adult LOPD patients. However, the extent of this contribution is 
unknown. 
The pivotal study has not met its primary objective. According to the planned hierarchical testing strategy, all 
other (key secondary and secondary) endpoints will be considered explorative.  
Data on long-term efficacy are limited. Studies ATB200-02, ATB200-07) are still ongoing. Nearly all enrolled 
subjects with at least an additional 6 months of exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa after the end of the ATB200-
03 study, and 33 subjects (approximately 30% of subjects) with no less than an additional 12 months of 
exposure to cipaglucosidase alfa have been included in the ongoing study ATB200-07 as of 3 August 2021. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Considering the addition of miglustat to cipaglucosidase alfa had no or limited impact on the Cmax of 
cipaglucosidase alfa, the safety profile of miglustat in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa is not expected to 
be much different compared to that of cipaglucosidase alfa alone. 
In general, the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) tended to be higher at a longer 
treatment exposure time (mean 17.3 vs. 11.8 months). For example, the occurrence of severe treatment-
emergent adverse events (9.4 vs. 13.2%), treatment-related adverse events (30.6 vs. 41.1%), anaphylactic 
reactions (20.0 vs. 29.1%), infusion-associated reactions (24.7 vs. 28.5%), and hypersensitivity reactions 
(17.6 vs. 21.9%) upon cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment tended to be lower in safety pool 1 (n=123) 
as compared to safety pool 2 (n=151) respectively.  
However, the pattern of observed treatment-emergent adverse events from the analysed safety populations 
(pools 1 and 2) was comparable, and the data from the pivotal study ATB200-03 (pool 1) is consequently 
used to characterise the safety profile of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat. 
The most common TEAEs in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group were fall (29.4%), headache (23.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (22.4%), and myalgia (16.5%).  
The occurrence of anaphylactic reactions (20.0 vs. 28.9%), infusion-associated reactions (24.7 vs. 26.3%), 
and hypersensitivity reactions (17.6 vs. 36.8%) tended to occur less frequently upon cipaglucosidase 
alfa/miglustat compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment.  
The anti-drug antibody prevalence tended to be higher for patients who were treated with cipaglucosidase 
alfa (93.9%) compared to those who were treated with alglucosidase alfa (86.8%) in studies ATB200-02 and 
ATB200-03. A similar trend was observed with respect to the anti-drug antibody incidence during the first 
year of treatment (65.8 vs. 34.2%). However, there was no clear trend in infusion-associated reaction 
occurrence with the incidence of anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin E (IgE) or total anti-rhGAA antibodies.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Since cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat were administered in combination in conducted clinical studies, it is 
not possible to determine the contribution of each active component to the overall safety profile.  
The included number of Pompe disease patients is limited (n=151). This is expected since Pompe disease is 
rare. The majority of patients with Pompe disease were ERT-experienced, and hence the safety data in ERT-
naïve  population  do  not  allow  a  full  characterisation  of  the  safety  profile,  however,  it  is  not  expected  to  be 
much different than the ERT experienced patients.  
The available safety data at different dosages of cipaglucosidase alfa alone and with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase 
alfa with different dosages of miglustat in the conducted dose-response study in 11 patients with Pompe disease 
is too limited to draw appropriate conclusions regarding clinical safety.  
In clinical studies, the Cmax of a cipaglucosidase alfa dosage of 20 mg/kg was 325 µg/ml. Upon 
administration of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat, the Cmax ranged from 323-345 µg/ml. 
Considering the addition of miglustat to cipaglucosidase alfa had no or limited impact on the Cmax of 
cipaglucosidase alfa, the safety profile of miglustat in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa is not expected to 
be much different compared to that of cipaglucosidase alfa alone. This has, however, not been evaluated in 
conducted clinical studies. 
Limited study data on the clinical effects of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat are available for a treatment period 
beyond 24 months. Additional data from the ongoing clinical studies ATB200-02 and ATB200-07 will provide 
some more insight into the long-term clinical safety of cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Although the pivotal study failed to show the superiority of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and 
miglustat over alglucosidase alfa/placebo in adult LOPD patients as per the prespecified analysis, the change 
from baseline for the 6MWD in the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat group showed a clinically relevant effect, 
while the sitting %FVC indicated a stabilisation based on the most adequate and reliable MMRM analysis to 
further analyse the efficacy data. The clinical benefit of the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and 
miglustat has thus been demonstrated in a patient population mainly consisting of subjects who are likely to 
slowly progress as already treated by ERT. The used MMRM analysis was based on the actual time point of 
assessments (ITT-OBS Population) and excluding the outlying (as requested by the CHMP), the estimated LS 
mean treatment differences for the 6MWD and the sitting % predicted FVC tended to be more favourable for 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat than alglucosidase alfa/placebo, respectively. 
In contrast with the ERT experienced population (mainly represented in the clinical development 
programme), the clinical efficacy was less clear in the treatment naïve patients with an observed clinically 
relevant improvement in 6MWD and a change in sitting % predicted FVC suggestive of a deterioration under 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat co-administration. Treatment effects in naïve patients were more variable due 
to the smaller study population. There is no biologically plausible reason that the benefits from the generally 
more severe and difficult to treat ERT-experienced LOPD population would not be translatable to ERT-naïve 
LOPD patients. Therefore, the extrapolation of benefit from ERT-experienced to ERT-naïve LOPD patients is 
considered acceptable.  
The inclusion criteria as well as the current indication limits the indicated population to adult LOPD patients.  
Considering no or a limited increase in the Cmax and a lower AUC of miglustat in cipaglucosidase alfa-treated 
patients was observed, the safety profile of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat co-administration is not 
expected to be much different compared to that of cipaglucosidase alfa alone. In support of this, the safety 
profile of the cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat co-administration appeared to be overall comparable to that of 
alglucosidase alfa. The occurrence of treatment-related adverse events tended to be lower upon 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat treatment as compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment. 
No unexpected safety concerns were observed in the intended use of miglustat and cipaglucosidase alfa co-
administration. Infusion-associated reactions upon parenteral administration of LOPD treatment occur soon 
after administration and may be severe and life-threatening. Because of this, these safety concerns are an 
important identified risk of cipaglucosidase alfa treatment. The occurrence of infusion-associated reactions, 
anaphylactic reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions however tended to be less frequent upon 
cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat compared to alglucosidase alfa/placebo treatment. This is considered an 
advantage of cipaglucosidase alfa infusions in combination with miglustat relative to alglucosidase alfa 
infusions, albeit long term data beyond 24 months are not yet available. Since these risks are considered 
manageable, the CHMP agreed to collect further data as part of the additional pharmacovigilance activities 
through the ongoing studies and a prospective and observational registry to be put in place by the applicant.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Notwithstanding the lack of a superior result in the active comparison (co-administration of cipaglucosidase 
alfa and miglustat versus alglucosidase alfa and placebo), the CHMP considered that the observed 
improvements in treatment effects with cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat are clinically 
relevant. Together with the scientific evidence and supportive empirical clinical data with alglucosidase alfa 
these data demonstrate a positive benefit-risk balance in patients with LOPD Pompe disease (either ERT-
experienced or naïve) and thus the co-administration of cipaglucosidase alfa and miglustat constitutes an 
alternative option to other existing and approved ERTs in this population. 
The clinical safety profile of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat is overall comparable to that of 
alglucosidase alfa. 
Based on the totality of evidence, the benefit/risk balance of cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with miglustat 
is positive in the claimed indication.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Being engaged in the EMA pilot “CHMP early contact with patient organisations”, the following feedback was 
received.  
•  All patients expressed the need to be able to adjust the dose of their enzyme replacement therapy 
until the optimum levels are reached (personalised dosing). 
•  Most patients expect that a new treatment should stabilise the disease more than existing ones. 
Some recovery would be welcomed, but experience with alglucosidase alfa might limit this 
expectation. 
•  With miglustat, diarrhoea is reported the day the product is taken, which can exacerbate this 
symptom for people with Pompe disease suffering from gastrointestinal disorders. However, these 
episodes can be reasonably controlled (no carbohydrate products ingested the day before, and some 
medications can also help). 
•  As most patients are taking alglucosidase alfa already, the administration of miglustat in combination 
with cipaglucosidase alfa poses no problem. The switch might require returning to the hospital for a 
short period for those receiving infusions at home, which could be a concern during Covid-19 
pandemic. 
•  Only if allergic reactions occurred in the past, then hospital infusions are preferred. However, it is 
also possible to train nurses for home infusions and to have a prescription for antihistamines at 
home.

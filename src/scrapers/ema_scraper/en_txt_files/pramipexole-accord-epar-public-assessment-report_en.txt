Parkinson's  disease  (PD)  is  a  neurodegenerative  disorder  characterised  by  bradykinesia,  rigidity, 
postural  imbalance  and  tremor.  The  incidence  of  PD increases  with  age  and  on  average,  2  to  3  %  of 
the  population  in  the  western  world  will  develop  PD.  The  cause  of  the  disease  is  still  unknown.  PD 
develops  due  to  loss  of  neuronal  functions  within  the  basal  ganglia  and  the  substantia  nigra  of  the

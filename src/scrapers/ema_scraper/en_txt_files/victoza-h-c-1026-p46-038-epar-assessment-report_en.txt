Study design 
Trial NN2211-3659 was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled 
trial with a 26-week double-blind period followed by a 26-week open-label extension in subjects with 
T2D aged 10−17 years. 
The trial consisted of a 2-week screening period followed by an 11−12-week run-in period (3−4 weeks 
of metformin titration and 8 weeks of metformin maintenance). After the run-in period, subjects who 
fulfilled the randomisation criteria were randomised 1:1 to either liraglutide or placebo (in combination 
with metformin with or without basal insulin treatment, on a background of diet and exercise) for 26 
weeks. Subjects already treated with a stable metformin dose of ≥ 2000 mg/day for ≥ 56 days at 
screening could skip the run-in period and advance directly to randomisation. Subjects treated with 
basal insulin were to be on a stable dose of basal insulin for ≥ 56 days (in addition to being on a stable 
dose of metformin) in order to advance directly to randomisation. 
At the end of the 26-week double-blind treatment period, the treatment allocation was unblinded. 
Subjects treated with liraglutide in the double-blind period continued their treatment regimen 
unchanged during the 26-week open-label period. Subjects treated with placebo during the double-
blind period discontinued the placebo treatment at week 26, and continued treatment with the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metformin (with or without basal insulin) during the open-label 
period. The maximum duration of the trial, including screening and one week of follow-up (after 52 
weeks of treatment) was ≤ 67 weeks. Rescue treatment was allowed for subjects in both treatment 
groups experiencing confirmed hyperglycaemia. Subjects on rescue treatment were to remain in the 
trial unless hyperglycaemia persisted, and they met the specified withdrawal criteria. 
Subjects treated with liraglutide (active treatment) for more than 3 months were asked to return for 
follow-up visits one and two years (visit 27 at week 104, and visit 28 at week 156) after the subject 
completed the open-label part of the trial (after trial drug cessation at week 52). 
1) Screening prior to metformin titration

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

2) Run-in: metformin titration to 2000 mg daily, if possible, or a MTD ≥1000 mg and ≤2000 mg after 
verification of eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects already treated with 
a stable dose ≥ 2000 mg of metformin or more for at least 56 days at the time of screening could skip 
the run-in period and advance directly to randomisation. Subjects who were treated with basal insulin 
should in addition to the stable dose of metformin have had a stable dose of basal insulin for at least 
56 days to advance directly to visit 7. 
3) Randomised treatment: Escalation of liraglutide in weekly 0.6 mg increments over 2-3 weeks to 1.8 
mg, if possible, or a MTD. Subjects on basal insulin had their insulin dose decreased by 20% at 
randomisation. 
4) All subjects were unblinded at visit 17. Subjects treated with liraglutide continued with unchanged 
doses of metformin ± basal insulin and their treatment with liraglutide. Subjects treated with placebo 
discontinued placebo and continued on metformin ± basal insulin. 
5) All subjects were to complete visit 26. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months 
were to also complete visits 27 and 28. 
Abbreviations: MTD = maximum tolerated dose; N = number of subjects 
Rationale 
A randomised, double-blind design was chosen in order to limit the bias in the trial conduct and 
interpretation of the results for the primary endpoint and efficacy/safety endpoints assessed at week 
26. The 26-week open-label extension was implemented in order to assess the longer-term safety of 
liraglutide treatment in the paediatric population. 
The 1- and 2-year follow-up for subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months was 
implemented in order to assess any potential long-term effects on growth, pubertal development and 
general safety. 
Study population/Sample size 
Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months in trial NN2211-3659 were to be included for 
follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open-label period (after trial drug cessation at 
week 52). 
Treatments 
Liraglutide (Victoza) 6.0 mg/mL, 3mL pre-filled pen injector and the maximum tolerated dose of 
metformin or placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Endpoints to address the objectives of the 1- and 2-year safety follow-up period are: 
•  AEs and SAEs 
•  Growth (i.e., height velocity) in cm/year (if subject is still growing) 
•  Height velocity SDS (if subject is still growing) 
Change in: 
• 
• 
• 
height SDS 
pubertal assessment/progression (Tanner staging)

Statistical Methods 
This 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period included subjects from the Safety Analysis Set (SAS) from 
the main part of the trial NN2211-3659, who were treated with liraglutide (active treatment) for more 
than 3 months. 
Efficacy assessments were not evaluated during the 1-and 2-year safety follow up period. Body weight 
and height measurements were collected in relation to safety. 
All safety endpoints were summarised using descriptive statistics. 
The safety areas of interest were defined by MAH’s Global Safety. At the follow-up visits (visits 27 and 
28), sites were to record reported AEs and SAEs (based on the subject’s memory) and any associated 
concomitant medication. In addition, subjects were to be asked at each contact with the trial site staff 
(site visits and telephone contacts) whether they had any AEs (including any changes in concomitant 
illness or new illnesses). 
Results 
Recruitment/Number analysed 
Subjects treated with liraglutide (active treatment) for more than 3 months were asked to return for 
follow-up visits at 1- and 2-year (visit 27 at week 104, and visit 28 at week 156) after the subject 
completed the open-label period of the trial (after trial drug cessation at week 52). Of the 66 subjects 
who were randomised and exposed to liraglutide group during the main part of the trial (0-52 weeks), 
61 subjects completed more than 3 months of active liraglutide treatment and were eligible for the 1- 
and 2-year safety follow-up period. Of eligible subjects, 50 subjects (82.0%) attended the 1-year 
follow-up visit, and 48 subjects (78.7%) attended the 2-year follow-up visit.

Baseline data 
In total, 61 subjects were eligible for the safety follow-up period; of these, 50 subjects attended the 1-
year follow-up visit, and 48 subjects attended the 2-year follow-up visit. Key demographic and other 
baseline characteristics for the trial population that participated in the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up 
are as follows: The mean age (standard deviation (SD)) at baseline was 14.6 years (1.57), whereas 
the mean bone age was higher (16.6 years, SD: 2.05). There were more female subjects (53.8%) than 
male subjects (46.2%). The mean height (SD) at baseline was 1.64 m (0.12), ranging between 1.34 m 
and 1.92 m. The mean height SDS (SD) at baseline was 0.23 (1.36). 
Efficacy results 
Although not a pre-specified endpoint, weight was collected at the week 104 and 156 visits. At 
baseline, the mean weight (SD) for the 52 subjects who provided safety information at follow-up was 
91.05 kg (27.19 kg), at week 52 was 88.68 kg (28,77 kg), and on treatment without rescue 
medication 86.37 kg (28.86 kg). At the 1-year follow-up (week 104), the mean weight (SD) for 50 
subjects was 88.56 kg (27.10 kg), and at 2-year follow-up (week 156), the mean weight (SD) for 45 
subjects was 85.04 kg (21.75 kg). Although the numbers are small, there appears to be a trend in this 
cohort for weight maintenance at the 1-year follow-up visit. There also appears in this cohort to be 
weight loss from end of main part of the trial at 52 weeks to week 156 (at end of 2-years follow-up 
period). 
Safety results 
Adverse events 
During the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period, 20 subjects (38.5%) out of 52 subjects who provided 
safety follow-up data experienced 47 AEs. The majority of the AEs were reported within the SOCs 
Gastrointestinal disorders and Infections and infestations. The majority of AEs in the follow-up period 
were nonserious (38 AEs in 18 subjects), mild (30 AEs in 15 subjects) or moderate (15 AEs in 10 
subjects) in severity. The majority were judged as unlikely to be related to trial product by the 
investigator (37 AEs in 16 subjects) and had an outcome of resolved (36 AEs in 17 subjects). 
Within the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders, the majority of the subjects (11.5%) reporting AEs covered 
by HLGT Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (7 AEs in 6 subjects), including PTs of ‘vomiting’, 
‘nausea’, ‘dyspepsia’, ‘faecaloma’ and ‘abdominal pain’. 
Within the SOC Infections and infestations, the majority of the subjects (13.5%) reporting AEs covered 
by the HLGT Infections- pathogen unspecified (12 AEs in 7 subjects). 
The SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders (5 AEs in 5 subjects) and the SOC Psychiatric disorders (3 
AEs in 3 subjects) accounted for 9.6% and 5.8% of subjects, respectively. 
CHMP comment: 
Reported adverse events do not differ from the ADRs mentioned in the product information.  
No fatal events were reported during the safety follow-up period. Eight (8) subjects (15.4%), 
experienced 9 SAEs during the 1- and 2- year safety follow-up period. There was no clustering of SAEs 
in a specific system-organ class (SOC), and the majority of the SAEs had an outcome of resolved (6 
SAEs) or resolving (1 SAE). All SAEs were deemed unlikely related to trial product. Only one severe 
SAE of persistent hyperglycaemia was reported, which had the outcome of ‘resolved’.

The most frequently reported moderate AEs in the 1 and 2 year safety follow-up period were events 
within the SOC infections and infestations (6 AEs in 4 subjects) and GI disorders (3 AEs in 3 subjects). 
The most frequently reported mild AEs in the 1 and 2 year safety follow-up period were events within 
the SOC infections and infestations (9 AEs in 6 subjects) and GI disorders (8 AEs in 6 subjects). 
As reported in the main part of the trial NN2211-3659 (week 0-52), during the blinded treatment 
period (week 0-26), the rates of all mild and moderate AEs (including serious and nonserious events) 
were higher in the liraglutide treatment group (1708 and 8090 events per 1000 PYE, respectively) than 
in the placebo group (892 and 6311 events per 1000 PYE, respectively). The observed imbalance was 
mainly driven by the higher rates of mild and moderate GI AEs in the liraglutide group. The most 
frequently reported mild or moderate AEs in the liraglutide group were events within the SOC 
gastrointestinal disorders. The findings for all mild and moderate AEs (including serious and nonserious 
events) in the entire treatment period (week 0-56) were very similar to those in the blinded treatment 
period, since the majority of these AEs in both groups occurred during the blinded treatment period. 
During the 1- and 2-year safety follow-up period, 1 subject reported 1 MESI of ‘autoimmune 
thyroiditis’ which was mild in severity and had an outcome of not resolved. The AE was reported to 
have occurred on study day 490. The event was nonserious, mild in severity, judged to be unlikely 
related to the trial product (liraglutide) by the investigator and had an outcome of ‘not resolved’. Upon 
the cessation of liraglutide treatment, the event onset latency period (event onset date – last date of 
liraglutide treatment) was approximately 4 months.  
CHMP comment: 
Causality is assessed as unlikely related to liraglutide and metformin by the investigator. Based on the 
information provided, it can be considered that this case occurred by incidence and is unlikely related 
to the study drugs.

Two (2) AEs in 2 subjects (‘hyperglycaemia’ and ‘persistent hyperglycaemia’) were reported as SAEs. 
The SAE ‘Persistent hyperglycaemia’ was reported as severe, whereas the ‘hyperglycaemia’ was 
reported as moderate in severity. The remaining 2 AEs were reported as nonserious (hyperglycaemia 
and acute hyperglycaemia). Both of these AEs were mild in severity. All 4 AEs were judged to be 
unlikely related to the trial product (liraglutide) by the investigator. Three (3) AEs had an outcome of 
‘recovered’, whereas the nonserious AE of ‘acute hyperglycaemia’ had an outcome of ‘recovering’. 
CHMP comment: 
The two cases of hyperglycaemia concerned patients who had besides type 2 diabetes also obesity 
(BMI 47.2 and 31.8). Both took other anti-diabetic drugs like insulin or sitagliptin and still had high 
blood glucose levels and a high HbA1c. These patients had high glucose levels over a longer period of 
time. The investigators considered causality for liraglutide and metformin as unlikely. 
In the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period, the pre-defined MedDRA search for AEs related to 
depression and suicide/self-injury identified 2 AEs in 2 subjects: ‘depression’ and ‘depressive 
symptoms’. The event of ‘depressive symptom’ was reported as serious, whereas the event of 
depression was reported as nonserious. Both of the events were mild in severity and were judged to be 
unlikely related to the trial product (liraglutide) by the investigator. The PT of ‘depression’ for one 
subject was also identified as ‘nonserious AE deemed to be significant in the judgement of the trial 
study group’. 
CHMP comment: 
The investigator considered causality with liraglutide and metformin as unlikely for the patient reported 
with the event ‘depressive symptoms’.  
Overall, the results of safety follow-up period for AE severity were in line with the main part of the trial 
(0-52 weeks). 
Height/growth 
Height SDS, growth (i.e., height velocity) and height velocity SDS were calculated.

Mean (SD) Height SDS at baseline and at week 52 was 0.23 (1.36) and 0.018 (1.37), respectively. A 
slight decrease in height SDS (mean (SD)) was noted, at week 104 (−0.14 (1.37)) and 156 (−0.22 
(1.44)). Height velocity (mean (SD)) at week 104 for 50 subjects was 1.15 (1.78) and at week 156 for 
45 subjects was 1.10 (1.50). A slight decrease in height velocity at these two-time points (week 104 
and week 156) was also noted compared to week 52, as could be expected in subjects approaching or 
having reached final height. Height velocity SDS (mean (SD)) at week 104 for 41 subjects was −0.52 
(1.47) and at week 156 for 27 subjects was 0.14 (1.16). Mean (SD) height velocity SDS was reported 
to be slightly increased at week 104 and week 156 compared to week 52. However, no notable 
difference was observed in change in mean (SD) height velocity SDS from week 52 to week 104 
(0.469 (1.36)) and from week 104 to week 156 (0.48 (0.64)). 
The safety follow-up results for height SDS, growth (i.e., height velocity) and height velocity SDS are 
in line with the main part of the trial. 
Pubertal assessment/progression 
Tanner staging 
At weeks 104 and 156, none of the subjects was Tanner stages I or II or III with respect to breast 
development. Five (31.3%) subjects at week 104 and 3 (21.4%) subjects at week 156 were Tanner 
stage IV with respect to breast development. At weeks 104 and 156, the majority of female subjects 
(68.8% and 78.6%, respectively) were Tanner stage V with respect to breast development. Smaller or 
comparable proportions of female subjects progressed to higher Tanner stages with respect to breast 
development at weeks 104 and 156 compared to baseline and week 52.  
At weeks 104 and 156, the majority of male subjects were Tanner stages IV (35.7% and 23.1%, 
respectively) or V (57.1% and 69.2%, respectively) with respect to penis development. Smaller 
proportions of male subjects progressed to higher Tanner stages with respect to penis development at 
weeks 104 and 156 compared to baseline and week 52. 
At weeks 104 and 156, very few female subjects were Tanner Stage IV (12.5% and 15.4%, 
respectively) and the majority of female subjects were Tanner stages V (81.3% and 84.6%, 
respectively) with respect to pubic hair development. At weeks 104 and 156, the majority of male 
subjects were Tanner stages IV (28.6% and 21.4%, respectively) or V (64.3% and 71.4%, 
respectively) with respect to pubic hair development. Smaller or comparable proportions of subjects 
progressed to higher Tanner stages with respect to pubic hair development at weeks 104 and 156 
compared to baseline and week 52. 
Overall, there was no evidence of abnormal pubertal progression at follow-up (weeks 104 and 156) 
with respect to any of the three assessed areas (breast, penis and pubic hair development). 
Testicular volume 
At week 104, mean (SD) testicular volume of 15 subjects was 18.93 (5.38) mL and at week 156 mean 
(SD) testicular volume of 14 subjects was 20.36 mL (5.12). Testicular volume at follow-up period 
(week 104 and 156) was reported to be slightly increased compared to the observations at baseline 
and week 52. The mean (SD) change in testicular volume at week 104 with respect to week 52 was 
2.54 mL (2.33) and at week 156 with respect to week 52 was 4.15 mL (3.83). The mean change in 
testicular volume at week 104 and week 156 was 1.50 mL (2.41). Overall, there was no evidence of 
abnormal pubertal progression with respect to testicular volume. 
Bone Age 
Bone age was determined for 16 subjects (9 males and 7 females) at week 104 and for 10 subjects (6 
males and 4 females) at week 156. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/93156/2021  
Page 10/13 
 
 
 
At week 104, a mean bone age for 9 males was 17.22 years (1.99) and for 7 females was 16.29 years 
(2.14). At week 156, a mean bone age for a total of 6 males was 17.00 years (2.01) and for a total of 
4 females was 15.50 years (1.00). A mean bone age (SD) for a total of 16 subjects at week 104 was 
16.81 years (2.04) and for a total of 10 subjects at week 156 was 16.40 years (1.84). 
At week 104, a mean chronological age (SD) for a total of 23 males was 16.74 years (1.49) and for a 
total of 27 females was 16.51 years (1.72). At week 156, a mean chronological age (SD) for a total of 
22 males was 17.69 years (1.53) and for a total of 26 females 17.47 years (1.75). 
The mean (min−max) bone age was similar at baseline (week 0), week 52, week 104, and week 156 
and no notable differences were observed in mean bone age at these time points. 
CHMP comment: 
Growth, pubertal progression and bone development did not show differences compared to the general 
population in these age groups.  
Overall, the results of the 1- and 2-year safety follow-up period are in line with the main part of the 
trial. During the 1- and 2-year follow-up period: 
• 
• 
The majority of the subjects (17.3%) reporting AEs were within the SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders (11 AEs in 9 subjects) followed by the SOC Infections and infestations (15.4% of 
subjects, 15 AEs in 8 subjects). 
The majority of AEs were nonserious, mild or moderate in severity, judged as unlikely to be 
related to the trial product by the investigator and had an outcome of resolved (with a minority 
recovered /resolving, or not recovered/not resolved). 
•  No fatal events occurred during the follow-up period. 
•  Nine (9) SAEs were reported in 8 subjects. There was no clustering of SAEs within a SOC and 
all SAEs had outcome of resolved, except for 2 SAEs (of which, the SAE of malocclusion was 
reported as ‘resolving’ and the outcome for the SAE of depressive symptom was reported as 
‘unknown’). All SAEs were deemed unlikely related to trial product. 
•  With respect to height: at weeks 104 and 156, there was a small decrease in height SDS. 
There was also a slight decrease in height velocity, which could be due to subjects nearing or 
attaining final height. 
•  Bone age obtained at weeks 104 and 156 indicated that some subjects were near or at the 
final height. 
•  No abnormalities in pubertal progression were observed. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period was intended to assess any potential long-term effect of 
liraglutide on growth, pubertal development and general safety. This report evaluated 1-and 2-year 
safety data after trial drug cessation at week 52 and included data from subjects who were treated 
with liraglutide for more than 3 months during the main part of the trial (0-52 weeks). The 1-and 2-
year safety follow-up was conducted at 35 sites in 18 countries.

In total, 61 subjects were eligible for the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period. Fifty (50) subjects 
(82.0%) attended the 1-year follow-up visit (week 104, visit 27) and 48 subjects (78.7%) attended 
the 2-year follow-up visit (week 156, visit 28). Safety endpoints were evaluated at both visits.  
During 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period, a total of 47 AEs were reported in 20 subjects (38.5%). 
The majority of the AEs reported were within the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders and the SOC 
Infections and infestations. The majority of AEs in the follow-up period were nonserious, mild or 
moderate in severity, judged to be unlikely related to the trial product by the investigator and had an 
outcome of ‘resolved’. 
No fatal events were reported during the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period. Eight (8) subjects 
treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months in the main part of the trial experienced 9 SAEs in the 
follow-up period. Of these 9 SAEs, one was severe, and the remaining 8 were of mild or moderate in 
severity. All SAEs were deemed unlikely related to trial product. There was no clustering of SAEs in a 
specific SOC. All SAEs had an outcome of resolved, except for 2 SAEs (of which, the SAE of 
malocclusion was ‘resolving’ and the outcome for the SAE of depressive symptom was reported as 
‘unknown’). During the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period, one MESI of autoimmune thyroiditis 
which was mild in severity and had an outcome of resolved was reported in one subject. 
The results for height parameters are consistent with a cohort that had a mean bone age at week 156 
of 17.00 years for boys and 15.50 years for girls, indicating that some subjects were approaching or 
had achieved their final height by the end of the 2-year follow-up period. A slight decrease in height 
SDS (mean (SD)) was noted, at week 104 (-0.14 (1.37)) and 156 (-0.22 (1.44)). A slight decrease in 
height velocity at these two-time points was also noted, as could be expected in subjects approaching 
or having reached the final height. 
With respect to pubertal development of subjects in the safety follow-up period: at the end of the 1-
and 2-year safety follow-up period, the majority of female subjects were Tanner stage V with respect 
to breast development and pubic hair development and the majority of male subjects were Tanner 
stage V with respect to penis development and pubic hair development. There was no evidence of 
abnormal pubertal progression. In the 1-and 2-year follow-up period, there were no clinically relevant 
changes in pubertal progression (i.e., Tanner staging) and in growth/height. The results of these 
parameters during 1 and 2 follow-up period were in line with the main part of the trial (baseline to 
week 52). 
No notable differences were observed in mean bone age at week 104 and week 156 compared to 
baseline and week 52. Overall, the mean bone age at 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period was in line 
with the main part of the trial. 
Although not a pre-specified endpoint, weight was collected at the week 104 and 156 visits. There 
appears to be a trend for weight maintenance at the 1-year follow-up visit with a small difference in 
mean weight compared to week 52. There also appears in this cohort to be some weight loss from the 
end of main part of the trial at 52 weeks to week 156 (at the end of 2-years follow-up period). 
Overall conclusions 
• 
• 
Following exposure of paediatric subjects with T2D with liraglutide for more than 3 months 
during the main part of the trial, the results from the 1-and 2-year safety follow-up period did 
not reveal any new apparent safety concerns with respect to: AEs and SAEs, growth (height 
velocity), pubertal development (by Tanner staging) or bone age. 
Eight (8) subjects treated with liraglutide in the main phase, experienced 9 non-treatment 
emergent SAEs in the follow-up period with no clustering in any SOC.

3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
The MAH has submitted the results of the long-term extension of a double-blind study of liraglutide 
with or without metformin in children aged 10-17 years. Efficacy was determined in the main study. 
Long-term safety did not reveal new safety issues. Most of the reported adverse events are included in 
the product information, and several single cases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis are considered 
unlikely related to liraglutide or metformin.  
Growth parameters and pubertal assessment did not show differences compared to the general 
population of these age groups.  
Based on the results of among others the main study, the indication of liraglutide was previously 
extended to children of 10 years and older (procedure EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0049).  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

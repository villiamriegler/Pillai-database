This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  dexmedetomidine  Accord  100 
micrograms/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion.  The  RMP  details  important  risks  of 
dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, how these risks 
can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about dexmedetomidine Accord 100 
micrograms/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information). 
Dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion’s summary of 
product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare 
professionals and patients on how dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for 
solution for infusion should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Dexmedetomidine  Accord  100  micrograms/ml  concentrate  for 
solution for infusion should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment 
report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is indicated  
• 
for sedation of adult ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients requiring a sedation level not 
deeper  than  arousal  in  response  to  verbal  stimulation  (corresponding  to  Richmond 
Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) 0 to -3). 
•

Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Dexmedetomidine  Accord  100  micrograms/ml 
concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Dexmedetomidine  Accord  100 
micrograms/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language 
summary, 
available 
on 
the  EMA  website,

II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of  dexmedetomidine  Accord  100  micrograms/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for 
infusion together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more 
about dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion risks, are 
outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the  patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Dexmedetomidine Accord 100 micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, 
these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  mentioned  under 
relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  dexmedetomidine  Accord  100 
micrograms/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing 
information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  dexmedetomidine  Accord  100  micrograms/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for 
infusion are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise 
the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as 
identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with 
the  use  of  dexmedetomidine  Accord  100  micrograms/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based 
on available data, but this association has not been  established yet and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

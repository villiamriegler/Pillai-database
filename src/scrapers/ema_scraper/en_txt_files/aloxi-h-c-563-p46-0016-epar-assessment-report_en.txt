Assessor Summary 
The report on this study performed in Russia and the Ukraine, in 7 patients aged over 28 days and 
up to 23 months, 96 patients between 2 years and 11 years, and 47 patients between the ages of 
12  and  16  years,  suggests  no  safety  issue  and  also  suggests  efficacy  up  to  72  hours  post 
operatively. 
Currently  the  SmPC  in  section  4.2  states  under  Children  and  adolescents:  Aloxi  is  not 
recommended for use in children below age 18 due to insufficient data.  
The Guidance on the SmPC advises that when there is no indication in the paediatric population, 
available  information  should  be  summarised  using  the  standard  statements  “The  safety  and 
efficacy in children have not been established. Currently available data are described in section 
5.1, but no recommendation on posology can be made” and  the assessors  proposes that  section 
4.2 should be modified in this way with a summary of the study provided in section 5.1 
The  MAH  is  requested  to  propose  a  summary  of  the  study  indicating  the  age  of  the  patients 
treated, the doses used, and the main findings regarding efficacy and safety. 
MAH OVERVIEW OF NEW STUDY COMPLETED SINCE SUBMISSION OF THE 
ORIGINAL MAA 
Studies in special groups:  Paediatric populations 
The Phase 3 study PALO-07-29 conducted in paediatric patients to investigate the prevention of 
post  operative  nausea  and  vomiting  (PONV)  extends  the  available  clinical  information  for 
Palonosetron, and its findings are summarised below. 
PALO-07-29:  “A  Multicentre,  Double-blind,  Randomised,  Parallel  Group,  Stratified  Study  to 
Assess  the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  Single  IV  Doses  of  Palonosetron  to  Prevent  Postoperative 
Nausea and Vomiting in Paediatric Patients” 
Postoperative  nausea  and  vomiting  (PONV)  is  a  frequent  and  important  cause  of  morbidity  in 
children;  occurring  twice  as  frequently  in  children  as  in  adults,  increasing  in  incidence  until 
puberty, and thereafter decreasing to adult incidence rates. (1) 
Overall,  an  estimated  40%  to  50%  of  children  experience  PONV  after  receiving  general 
anaesthesia. (2) The incidence of PONV after tonsillectomy or strabismus surgery may be as high 
as  70%  and  80%,  respectively,  in  paediatric  patients  who  have  not  received  antiemetic 
prophylaxis. (3)(4) 
Despite  the  introduction  of  new  anti-emetic  medications,  PONV  is  still  a  frequent  problem 
affecting the paediatric population. Anti-emetics of choice for PONV include but are not limited 
to,  dexamethasone,  dimenhydrinate,  ondansetron,  dolasetron  and  granisetron.  The  5-HT3 
Receptor  Antagonists  are  the  anti-emetic  drugs  of  choice  for  PONV  in  children  because,  as  a 
class, they have proven efficacy in the prevention and treatment of PONV, with minimal adverse 
effects.  
A  clinical  study  was  undertaken  by  Helsinn  Healthcare  to  assess  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
over  a  72 
intravenous  palonosetron  (Aloxi
hour postoperative period in children undergoing elective surgery. 
solution  for  injection)  in  the  prevention  of  PONV 
®

The study design was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel and stratified study. 
Paediatric patients were given a single intravenous (IV) administration of palonosetron at 
one  of  two  doses;  either  1  mcg/kg  or  3  mcg/kg,  immediately  before  induction  of  general 
intravenous anaesthesia. 
Use of an  IV  line  facilitates  rapid  onset  of  loss of consciousness,  relaxation and analgesia, and 
since  IV  access  is  already  available  for  the  induction  and  maintenance  of  anaesthesia,  the 
preferred  route  of  administration  of  the  palonosetron  study  drug  was  intravenously  prior  to 
surgery, thus avoiding additional needle sticks for the patient. 
The  study,  conducted  at  4  sites  in  Russia  and  8  sites  in  the  Ukraine,  involved  150  evaluable 
paediatric  patients,  aged  >28  days  up  to  16  years  undergoing  surgical  elective  procedures 
requiring general intravenous anaesthesia.  
The safety parameters evaluated included the recording of adverse events, physical examination, 
vital  sign  measurements,  12-lead  ECG,  and  clinical  laboratory  (haematology,  blood  chemistry 
and urinalysis) assessments.   
Efficacy was evaluated based on emetic episodes, severity of nausea (only for patients aged 6 up 
to 16 years inclusive) and intake of rescue medication. 
The  efficacy  parameter  of  major  interest  in  the  study  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with  no 
emetic episodes during the overall time period 0-72 hours post-operatively.  Additional efficacy 
parameters assessed included the proportion of patients with no emetic episodes, the severity of 
nausea  (in  patients  aged  6-17  years),  the  time  to  first  emetic  episode,  the  time  to  first 
administration and need for rescue medication, the time to treatment failure (based on time to the 
first emetic episode or time to the first administration of rescue medication, whichever occurred 
earlier),  the  proportion  of  patients  without  rescue  medication  use,  and  the  Complete  Response 
(CR,  defined  as  no  emesis  and/or  retching  and  no  rescue  medication).  The  above-mentioned 
parameters were evaluated during the 0-6 hour, 6-24 hour, 24-48 hour, 48-72 hour, 0-24 hour, 0-
48 hour, 0-72 hour and 24-72 hour time intervals. 
Safety  analysis  was  performed  for  the  safety  cohort,  defined  as  all  patients  who  received 
palonosetron and had at least one safety assessment after treatment and all the statistical analyses 
were descriptive. 
The number of patients who experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), 
including  related,  severe,  severe  related,  serious,  and  serious  related  TEAE  randomisation 
techniques, deaths,  the number  of  patients  withdrawn  due  to  TEAE  and  the  number  of  patients 
withdrawn due to related TEAE were recorded by treatment dose and overall. 
Clinical  laboratory  assessments  were  analysed  in  the  central  laboratory  with  reference  ranges 
differentiated  by  gender  and/or  age  group.  Clinical  laboratory  data  results  were  recorded  by 
treatment group and test name. 
For  all  ECGs,  heart  rate  (HR)  and  PR,  QRS,  QT  and  QTc  intervals  were  analysed.  For  each 
parameter, the number of patients with at least one abnormality after baseline was recorded. 
The total number of subjects initially planned for inclusion in study PALO-07-29 and actually 
randomised to the study, including numbers by age, gender and race, is provided in Table 1 
below.

A total of 150 Caucasian paediatric patients [92 (61.3%) males; 58 (38.7%) females] ranging in 
age from 0.7 to 16.7 years, received palonosetron and were analysed as a safety set.  
Randomisation was stratified by age group (>28 days up to 23 months; 2 years up to 11 years; 12 
years up to 16 years inclusive) and by country. Within each stratum, patients were randomised to 
receive one of the two treatment doses. 
Summary of safety results: 
A  total  of  92  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  were  experienced  by  61  (40.7%) 
patients, of which 38 events occurred in 29 (39.2%) patients in the palonosetron 1 mcg/kg group 
and 54 events in 32 (42.1%) patients in the palonosetron 3 mcg/kg group. 
TEAEs  were  most  commonly  reported  in  the  “injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications, 
and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” System Organ Class (SOC) in both treatment 
groups.    The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  in  both  treatment  groups  were  procedural  pain 
(palonosetron  1  mcg/kg:    27.0%  of  patients;  palonosetron  3  mcg/kg:  25.0%  of  patients), 
pharyngolaryngeal  pain  (palonosetron  1  mcg/kg:  6.8%;  palonosetron  3 mcg/kg:  2.6%),  and 
rhinalgia (palonosetron 3 mcg/kg: 5.3%). 
In the gastrointestinal disorders SOC, vomiting and nausea occurred in the palonosetron 3 mcg/kg 
group only (6.6% and 5.3%, respectively), in 5 and 4 patients respectively. 
Adverse events were analyzed by subgroups based on country, gender, and age group. 
Within  subgroups,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  TEAEs  was  comparable  between  treatment 
groups,  except  for  patients  >28  days  to  23  months  old.  In  this  age  group,  the  low  number  of 
patients precluded meaningful interpretation of data. 
In the youngest patients (>28 days – 23 months), the only TEAEs reported were procedural pain, 
pyrexia, and nasopharyngitis. Procedural pain was reported for all 4 patients with TEAEs in this 
subgroup. 
None of the TEAEs was judged to be related to the study drug, and all TEAEs were classified as 
being of mild or moderate intensity. The percentage of patients reporting at least one TEAE of 
moderate intensity was somewhat lower for the low dose group (18.9%) than for the high dose 
group (27.6%); however, the percentage of patients with mild TEAEs was comparable between 
the treatment groups (palonosetron 1 mcg/kg: 23.0%; palonosetron 3 mcg/kg: 25.0%).

No risk for cardiac safety issues was determined in the study population and no safety concerns 
were  raised  for  the  administration  of  palonosetron  in  both  treatment  groups  on  examination  of 
vital  signs  or  laboratory  data,  or  on  physical  examination.  No  deaths  occurred,  no  SAEs  were 
reported, and no patients were withdrawn from the study due to the occurrence of TEAEs. 
Summary of efficacy results: 
A  similar  pattern  of  response  was  observed  between  the  two  treatment  groups  for  the  efficacy 
endpoint  of  major  interest  (i.e.  the  proportion of  patients  without  emesis  during  the  0-72  hours 
interval post-operatively) as well as for the additional efficacy parameters recorded.  
Efficacy results are summarised in Table 2.

The proportion of patients without emetic episodes during 0-72 hours post-operatively was 88.0% 
in  the  low  dose  group  and  84.0%  in  the  high  dose  group.  Within  subgroups,  the  proportion  of 
patients without emetic episodes was comparable between treatments during the 0-72 hours. 
In the low dose group, the proportion of patients without nausea was 69.2% during the 0-72 hours 
interval and ranged from 71.2% (0-6 hours) to 98.1% (48-72 hours) at further time intervals. The 
proportion  of  patients  without  nausea  in  the high  dose  group  was  66.7%  during  the  0-72  hours 
time period and ranged from 68.5% (0-6 hours) to 100% (48-72 hours) during further intervals. 
Only 2 (2.7%) patients in the low dose group and 1 (1.3%) patient in the high dose group were 
administered rescue medication. 
MAH CONCLUSIONS on BENEFIT AND RISK  
The  evaluation  of  study  PALO-07-29  revealed  no  significant  change  to  the  established 
risks/benefit profile of palonosetron. The good tolerability of palonosetron at both doses, and its 
proven  efficacy  for  protection  against  vomiting  and  nausea  up  to  72  hours  postoperatively, 
support the use of intravenous palonosetron as an optimal therapeutic alternative to other drugs to 
prevent PONV in paediatric patients undergoing surgical procedures.  
In  light  of  the  above  conclusions  no  changes  to  the  safety  information  for  palonosetron  are 
proposed. The data from study PALO-07-29 on the clinical use of palonosetron for the prevention 
of post operative nausea and vomiting in children aged >28 days up to 16 years are likely to be of 
interest to prescribers even though cannot be considered as conclusive. However since these data 
do  not  influence  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  Aloxi  250  micrograms  solution  for  injection 
approved in EU for the prevention of CINV, no regulatory changes to the marketing authorisation 
are proposed. 
Assessor comment 
The report on this study performed in Russia and the Ukraine, in 7 patients aged over 28 days and 
up to 23 months, 96 between 2 years and 11 years, and 47 patients between the ages of 12 and 16 
years, suggests no safety issue and also suggests efficacy up to 72 hours post operatively.

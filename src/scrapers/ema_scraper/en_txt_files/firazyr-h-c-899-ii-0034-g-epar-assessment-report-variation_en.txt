2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Based on the completion of the first part of Study HGT-FIR-086 “A Multicenter, Open-Label, 
Non-Randomized Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Tolerability, and Safety of a Single 
Subcutaneous Administration of Icatibant in Children and Adolescents with Hereditary Angioedema”, the 
intent of this Type II variation is to update the currently approved indication for Firazyr to also include 
paediatric patients aged 2 years and above. In addition, the following changes were proposed to be 
implemented in the SmPC as well, as they are all related to the data being submitted with this application:  
  Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties: As part of the population PK analysis performed in 
relation to the proposed label for paediatric patients, it is proposed to update the wording to 
reflect the effect of age (elderly), gender and race on PK of icatibant. All studies utilized for this 
analysis are either part of this application (HGT-FIR-086) or have previously been assessed by 
the EMA with prior submissions.  
  Section 5.3 Preclinical safety data: Addition of conclusions from the non-clinical study 
JE0419-0172 “Icatibant: 14 Day Subcutaneous Administration Range-Finding Toxicity Study in 
the Juvenile Rat”. This study was submitted as a Follow-up Measure (FUM RM2 023.1) in April, 
2012 in EU (eCTD 0056. Module 4.2.3.2). The results of this study did not warrant modification to 
the SmPC. However, in order to fulfil the intentions of the paediatric regulation (EC) 1901/2006, 
all results from studies conducted as part of the agreed PIP (EMEA-000408-PIP01-08-M05; EMA 
decision P/0243/2015) are being included in the Firazyr SmPC. The corresponding changes have 
also been made to the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) where relevant. 
This variation is supported by a clinical data from an interim report of an ongoing paediatric study 
(HTG-FIR-086) evaluated the effect of a single standard subcutaneous administration of icatibant in 
children and adolescents aged 2 to <18 years with a documented diagnosis of hereditary angioedema 
(HAE) type I or II. The study is ongoing and will examine the effect of 3 total exposures of icatibant in 10 
adolescents who are currently being followed. The data now submitted includes the data for the initial 
administration of icatibant from 11 pre-pubertal subjects during an HAE attack and 21 
pubertal/post-pubertal subjects (including 11 treated during an HAE attack and 10 treated without an 
attack). 
In accordance with Article 37 of the Paediatric Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006), it is 
considered that Firazyr is eligible for the extension of the ten-year period referred to in Article 8(1) of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 to twelve years, as the results from studies conducted as part of the agreed 
PIP (EMEA-000408- PIP01-08-M05; EMA decision P/0243/2015 ) will be reflected in the Firazyr SmPC a 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) can be caused by either a quantitative (type I) or qualitative (type II) 
deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). The deficiency in C1-INH results in accelerated release of bradykinin 
by its cleavage from high-molecular-weight kininogen by activated kallikrein. Bradykinin is the principal 
mediator of the increased vascular permeability characteristic of HAE. 
The clinical presentation and management of HAE in paediatric patients is different from adults and also 
more complex. The age at onset, frequency and duration of symptoms, as well as severity of attacks all 
exhibit substantial interindividual variation. Although acute episodes of HAE may occur at any age, the 
median age at first symptomatic HAE attack is estimated to range between 4 and 11 years. Subcutaneous 
oedema of the extremities, face, neck, torso, and genitals is the most common, and usually the earliest, 
manifestation of HAE seen in children. In the GI tract, submucosal oedema may be associated with colicky 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. In a large paediatric cohort, increased frequency and 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 6/49 
 
 
  
severity of HAE symptoms were reported at between 3 and 6 years of age and at around puberty and were 
attributed to physiological changes which occur during these periods of development. 
Though infrequent compared to cutaneous and abdominal manifestations, attacks of acute HAE involving 
the larynx may result in submucosal oedema of the upper airways and risk of death by asphyxiation if 
undiagnosed and/or untreated. In comparison to adults, asphyxia may ensue more rapidly in children 
because of smaller airway diameter. 
Prompt control of attacks, short-term prophylaxis, “intermittent” prophylaxis, long-term prophylaxis, and 
emergency therapy are recommended for the management of paediatric HAE. 
Treatment options for children with HAE according to current guidelines include antifibrinolytics, 
attenuated androgens, and plasma-derived C1-INH replacement therapy. 
Current guidelines favour antifibrinolytics for long-term prophylaxis because of their safety profile relative 
to attenuated androgens. The preferred antifibrolytic agent, where approved for use, is tranexamic acid, 
though Ɛ-aminocaproic acid is sometimes also used for this purpose. C1-INH replacement therapy has 
been used successfully for management of acute attacks of HAE in children; however, its use in children 
is associated with the same drawbacks (i.e. requirement for intravenous administration) as in adults. 
Icatibant is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin that acts as an antagonist of the 
bradykinin B2 receptor. Inhibition of bradykinin action through use of a B2 receptor antagonist is a 
therapeutic strategy for treatment of clinical symptoms of HAE and represents the rationale for use of 
icatibant in treatment of acute attacks of angioedema in HAE patients. 
In adults, SC icatibant 30 mg is approved for the treatment of cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal 
attacks of acute HAE. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical data presented in this variation application have been reported to and assessed by CHMP 
previously in FUM RM2 023.1 (April, 2012) and in procedure EMEA/H/C/000899/II/0017/G approved on 
25 October 2012. Thus the following data are included in this report for completeness. 
2.2.2.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
A dose range finding study was conducted in juvenile rats (JE049-0172) to identify the dose for a 
future juvenile rat toxicology study. In this study, rats were dosed daily subcutaneous starting on 
Postnatal Day 22 at doses of 0, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. 
Results 
There were no icatibant-related mortalities; group mean body weight gain was slightly decreased in 
females in the 12.5 and 25 mg/kg/day groups, males were unaffected. Females showed a slight reduction 
in food consumption at 25 mg/kg/day, males were unaffected. In males only there was a very slight but 
dose-related increase in spleen weight when adjusted for body weight. In males and females there were 
slight decreases in mean thymus weight as well. The absolute changes in body weight, food consumption, 
and organ weights were so slight that they were not considered as dose-limiting toxicities.

Discussion 
Based on these findings, 25 mg/kg/day was considered a maximally tolerated dose and a 7 week repeat 
dose toxicity study, including a fertility assessment in the juvenile rat was conducted (JE049-0173). This 
study was submitted as a Follow-up Measure (FUM RM2 023.1) in April, 2012 in the EU. 
A 7 week GLP toxicity study was performed in juvenile rats (Crl:WI(Han), 22 day of age, 12 
rats/sex/group + 20 rats/sex/group for recovery and analysis of fertility, which were dosed 0, 3, 9 or 25 
mg/kg/day subcutaneously. Doses were selected based on findings in previous studies; a 13-week 
toxicity study and a 14 day dose range-finding study. According to the MAH toxicokinetic data showed 
exposure in juvenile and adult animals to be approximately equivalent. Full recovery was expected after 
exposure to the low dose based on findings from a previous 6 month toxicity study. (Post-natal Day 22 in 
rats was considered to be equivalent to a 2 year old human.) An assessment of effects on fertility was 
assessed during the recovery period of 4 to 6 weeks (necroscpoies of females were performed on Day 13 
of gestation and males week 13 [5 animals/group] or 14 [15 animals/group]). 
The following were assessed: clinical observations, dose site observations, body weight, food intake, long 
bone measurements, sexual maturation data, mating data, seminology, organ weights and gross 
pathology and microscopic pathology. 
Results 
No mortalities were seen. (One female receiving 9 mg/kg/day was killed on Day 42 due to not having a 
patent vaginal opening. This developmental anomaly was confirmed at microscopic examination as being 
associated with excessive epithelial folding and was not considered to be an effect of treatment.) Clinical 
observations such as thinning fur, hair loss and sores/lesions were made at the injection site and were 
seen at 9 and 25 mg/kg/day, with more frequent findings seen at 25 mg/kg/day. These signs diminished 
during the treatment-free period of the study. A slight dose-related decrease in body weight gain was 
seen in toxicity group males which was statistically significant only as a dose response from PND 22-46 
(P<0.05) and at 25 mg/kg/day only PND 46-71 (P<0.01). Recovery/fertility group males were also 
slightly affected while female rats were less affected (recovery/fertility group females even showed a 
slight dose-related increase in body weight gain compared to controls). However, no statistically 
significant changes in mean body weight were detected. Mean food intake was generally slightly lower 
than controls in animals receiving 25 mg/kg/day. Mean long bone measurements showed no adverse 
effect of treatment (no dose response, both increases and decreases seen relative to control and no 
difference larger than 10% of control). 
Sexual maturation data: Balano-preputial separation showed a dose-related increase in the mean day of 
separation at all dose levels (mean postnatal day: 51.4/52.4/54.8/54.1) which was statistically 
significant in recovery/fertility males at 9 and 25 mg/kg/day (both P<0.01) (mean postnatal day: 
50.5/50.6/54.7/55.4). Vaginal opening was unaffected by treatment at any dose level tested (mean 
postnatal day: 34.8/35.5/34.9/35.4).  
Mating data: Recovery/fertility males and untreated females: Median pre-coital time (days) 2/1/2/3 
Pregnancy rate (%) 95/100/90/65 Mating index % 100/95/100/71 Fertility index (%) 95/100/90/65 
Fecundity index (%):95/100/90/65. Recovery/fertility females and untreated males: Median pre-coital 
time (days) 2.5/3/3/3 Pregnancy rate (%) 100/100/95/100 Mating index (%) 100/100/100/74.1 Fertility 
index (%) 100/100/95/100 Fecundity index (%):100/100/95/100. 
Caesarean implantation data: Recovery/fertility group females paired with untreated males, mean 
numbers of corpora lutea, the incidence of pre- and post-implantation loss and mean number of embryos 
per female all showed no adverse effect of treatment. Recovery/fertility group males paired with 
untreated females, mean numbers of corpora lutea and the incidence of post-implantation loss were 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 8/49 
 
 
  
similar to controls, however the mean number of implantations per female was significantly lower than 
controls at 25 mg/kg/day, and this was reflected in fewer embryos per female at 25 mg/kg/day (both 
P<0.01). As these females were untreated, this was a male-mediated effect in males receiving 25 
mg/kg/day.  
Seminology: In toxicity group males, 25 mg/kg/day mean percentage motility was significantly reduced 
compared with controls (P<0.001), as were average path velocity, curvilinear velocity and straight line 
velocity (all P<0.01). Mean percent abnormal sperm was increased compared to controls at 9 and 25 
mg/kg/day, significant only as a dose-response (both P<0.05). In recovery/fertility group males mean 
sperm count was lower than controls in all the treated-groups although not in a dose-proportional 
manner, and was statistically significant only at 25 mg/kg/day. All other parameters were similar to 
control at all dose levels, indicating at least partial functional recovery from the findings seen in the 
terminal kill males. 
Organ weights: Mean prostate weight in the terminal kill males was lower than controls in all the treated 
groups, although not in a dose-proportional manner and was statistically significant only at 9 and 25 
mg/kg/day (both P<0.05). Testes/epididymides showed a dose-proportional decrease which was 
statistically significant at 25 mg/kg/day only. Mean heart weight adjusted for body weight was reduced in 
all treated groups in a non dose-proportional manner and was statistically significant only at 3 
mg/kg/day. Mean heart weight adjusted for body weight in terminal kill females was significantly lower in 
animals receiving 25 mg/kg/day only (P<0.05). Mean uterus weight showed an approximately 
dose-proportional decrease compared to controls although this difference did not attain statistical 
significance. 
Gross pathology: small testis and small epididymis were recorded macroscopically in occasional animals 
dosed at 25 mg/kg/day. Also, fur loss, red, dark, sore and thick were recorded in injection sites of variable 
numbers of animals dosed at 25 mg/kg/day.  
Microscopic pathology: there were effects in the testis, epididymis and injection sites associated with 
effects of icatibant. 
In the testis, there was tubular cell vacuolation and germ cell degeneration in animals in all dose groups. 
Also, there were atypical residual bodies, multinucleated cells and tubular atrophy in the majority of 
animals dosed at 25 mg/kg/day. 
In the epididymis, there was cellular debris in animals in all dose groups and oligospermia in some 
animals dosed at 25 mg/kg/day.

findings in the testis

1=minimal, 2=slight, 3=moderate, 4=moderate severe, 5= severe 
In the injection sites, there was an overall increase in inflammatory lesions including 
dermatitis/folliculitis, cellulitis, myositis/myopathy, epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and dermal 
fibrosis in animals in all dose groups, compared with control animals, suggestive of minor local irritation 
associated with the injection of icatibant. There was evidence of complete reversal of the injection site 
findings seen at the terminal kill in the fertility phase animals. 
There was evidence of partial reversal of the changes seen in the testis and epididymis at the terminal kill. 
In the testis, there were reduced levels of tubular cell vacuolation, germ cell degeneration and 
multinucleated cells, together with an absence of atypical residual bodies after recovery. The minor 
increase in the level of tubular atrophy in fertility animals compared with terminal kill animals was 
considered to be a result of progression of the degenerative changes seen during the treatment period, 
rather than evidence of delayed toxicity. 
In the epididymis, the levels of cellular debris were reduced compared to those recorded at the terminal 
kill. Oligospermia was only recorded sporadically at the treatment-free kill.

Discussion 
Icatibant, at a dose level of 25 mg/kg/day (s.c.), induced an increase in the mean day of pre-putial 
separation, partially reversible effects on seminology parameters and impaired fertility in male juvenile 
rats. Increased intra-uterine pre-implantation loss, lower testes, epididymides, prostate and uterine 
weights were also seen.  
At a dose level of 9 mg/kg/day there was an increase in the mean day of pre-putial separation, increased 
numbers of abnormal sperm, decreased sperm count and lowered testes/epididymides and prostate 
weights in male rats. At a dose level of 3.0 mg/kg/day there was reduced body weight gain in toxicity 
males only, as well as lower testes/epididymides weights. At all doses there were microscopic findings in 
the testes and epididymides which were partially reversible and at the dose sites, which were fully 
reversible. 
The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for females was 9 mg/kg/day. The reduced uterine weight 
seen in females at dose levels of 9 mg/kg/day are expected based on similar findings seen in a previous 
13-week toxicity study in rat, where dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day or higher resulted in icatibant-related 
changes in the uterus of females. 
Due to the microscopic findings in testes and epididymides seen at all dose levels, which were partially 
reversible, a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for males could not be established for this study. The 
effects seen in males are largely expected due to the known effects of icatibant and similar effects were 
also seen in a previous 26 week rat toxicity study at dose levels of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day.  However, the 
effects seen in the present study at 3 and 9 mg/kg/day did not result in a functional deficit in terms of the 
mating performance and fertility of the male rat and an effect on fertility was only seen at 25 mg/kg/day. 
Decreases in circulating reproductive hormone levels and effects on reproductive organs seen in animals 
are consistent with the involvement of bradykinin in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
axis, as well as the presence of B2 receptors in the testis. 
This study was submitted as a revision to the SmPC, procedure EMEA/H/C/000899/II/0017/G, which was 
approved on 25 October 2012.

2.2.3.  Environmental Risk Assessment 
A justification for not submitting an updated ERA was provided by the MAH.  
The CHMP agrees that based on the nature of icatibant, extending the use to paediatrics will not lead to 
an increase in environmental exposure. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The studies presented have been assessed before, and appropriate changes have been introduced in 
SmPC section 5.3 within previous procedures. However, in order to fulfil the intentions of the paediatric 
Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, all results from studies conducted as part of the agreed PIP 
(EMEA-000408-PIP01-08-M05; EMA decision P/0243/2015) are being included in the Firazyr SmPC. 
Thus, the MAH proposes to introduce a sentence from the DRF-study stating that the dose-range finding 
study identified 25 mg/kg/day as a maximally tolerated dose. This change is considered acceptable. 
Given the limited clinical data available, in order to add reassurance in terms of patient safety, the MAH 
was asked to discuss how the exposures (Cmax and AUC) observed during the juvenile toxicity study, 
compare to the proposed and/or observed clinical exposures for paediatric patients of at least 2 years of 
age.  
In addition, on the basis of the non-clinical and clinical data generated thus far, the MAH was asked to 
clarify how the metabolism of icatibant in the proposed paediatric population compares to that observed 
in adults (see clinical section). These questions have been addressed by the Applicant, and in the 
response the Applicant has shown that icatibant exhibited higher body-weight adjusted clearance, CL/F 
(L/h/kg), in paediatrics (ages 2-17) when compared to adults; otherwise, no differences in metabolism 
are expected. 
Regarding the exposure, it can be concluded that administration of Firazyr to the paediatric population is 
supported when given once per HAE attack.  However, it is noted that clinical experience with respect to 
the exact frequency of dosing for the paediatric population could possibly be further revised  to give an 
accurate indication of the frequency of dosing per month in this subset of the population (as specified for 
adults).  (See the clinical part of this report for further detail)..     
Finally, the MAH was asked to note that in accordance with the guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use, for type II variations which involve a new indication, 
the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made to establish whether there is an increase in 
the environmental exposure. The Applicant therefore submitted further documentation and appropriate 
justification for not submitting an environmental risk assessment to support the extension of use.  The 
CHMP agrees that based on the nature of icatibant, extending the use to paediatrics will not lead to an 
increase in environmental exposure. In summary, the updated data submitted in this application do not 
lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of icatibant. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data results are adequate to support a use in a paediatric indication.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development program to support the use of icatibant as a treatment for HAE type I or II in 
children and adolescents consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 trial (HGT-FIR-086). NB. The study was 
intended to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of SC icatibant when administered to children and 
adolescents with HAE and to identify an optimal paediatric dosing regimen.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.1.1.  PK and PK/PD modelling 
Study Title: Clinical study HGT-FIR-086:  An open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm study to assess the 
pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of a single sc administration of icatibant in children and 
adolescents with hereditary angioedema 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The study enrolled children and adolescents from 2 to less than 18 years of age, divided into 2 groups: 
pre-pubertal (Tanner stage I) and pubertal/post-pubertal (Tanner stages II to V). All subjects received 
treatment with icatibant as a single, weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 30 mg 
administered in the abdominal region as an SC injection. 
Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of icatibant, M1, and M2 in 
pubertal/post-pubertal subjects were collected on Day 1 at pre-treatment, and at 15 (±5) minutes, 30 
(±5) minutes, 45 (±5) minutes, 1 hour (±10 minutes), 2 hours (±10 minutes), 4 (±0.5) hours, and 6 
(±0.5) hours after treatment. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of icatibant in 
pre-pubertal subjects were collected on Day 1 at pre-treatment and at 15 (±5) minutes, 30 (±5) minutes, 
2 hours (±10) minutes, 4 (±0.5) hours, and 6 (±0.5) hours after treatment. 
Non-compartmental analysis was used to calculate exposure metrics (eg. Cmax, AUC) and summary 
statistics were used to display these results. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The PK information obtained in the trial was also included in a Population PK analysis together with data 
from 6 adult studies. 
The objectives of the analysis were as follows: 
 
To characterize icatibant PK in this population 
o  By performing a population PK analysis to fit concentration-time profiles of icatibant in 
children and adolescents with HAE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 13/49 
 
 
  
o  By characterizing the source of variability in icatibant PK parameters in children and 
adolescents with HAE. 
o  By deriving individual post hoc PK parameters of icatibant (e.g., area under the 
concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC0-6), maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax), terminal half-life (t1/2), as well as the apparent clearance (CL/F), 
and apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F). 
 
 
To compare icatibant exposure in children and adolescents to those in adults. 
To assess the relationship between the time of onset of symptom relief (TOSR) and various 
exposure metrics of icatibant (Cmax, AUC0-2, AUC0-4 and AUC0-6, T1/2 and Tmax) in children 
and adolescents. 
A previously developed PopPK model was used as a starting point for the modelling. The relationships 
between covariates and PK parameters were explored graphically. Covariate analysis was performed 
using a “full model” approach to identify sources of variability in PK parameters of icatibant. The 
performance of the “full population PK model of icatibant” was evaluated with a bootstrap re-sampling 
strategy. Based on the estimates of the population PK model, concentration-time profiles of icatibant 
were simulated (~1000 replicates). Non-significant covariates were to be removed from the model. The 
quality-of-fit of the population PK models was evaluated using standard graphical representations of 
goodness-of-fit and the performance of the final population PK model of icatibant was evaluated with 
several methods including diagnostic plots and visual predictive check (see below). 
Study HGT-FIR-086 
Population PK modeling 
PopPK modeling of icatibant was performed based on PK data collected from four Phase I studies in 
healthy subjects (HGT-FIR-061, HGT-FIR-065, JE049-1102, JE049-1103), a Phase IIa study in adult

subjects with HAE (JE049-2101), and a Phase III study (HGT-FIR-086) in children and adolescents with 
HAE. A table describing the studies in short is provided below. 
Table 1 Description of Studies Included in the Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling of 
Icatibant 
The population PK dataset included concentration-time data of icatibant in 31 children and adolescents 
with HAE and 141 adults (healthy subjects and patients with HAE) below 65 years of age. 
A total number of 2172 concentrations were included in the PK analysis. Of the 523 BLQ samples, 166 
were observed prior to icatibant dosing and 228 BLQ samples were observed 18-h after administration. 
Results - Descriptive PK from Study HGT-FIR-086. 
The pharmacokinetic analysis included all subjects in the safety population who received study drug and 
provided evaluable plasma drug concentrations. 
A total of 32 subjects had pharmacokinetic blood samples taken. Among those subjects, 2 subjects were 
excluded from pharmacokinetic analysis for icatibant, M1, and M2.

Among the 30 subjects who provided evaluable plasma concentrations, 13 were female and 17 were 
male. The mean age was 7.9 ± 2.72 years for the pre-pubertal subjects, 14.3 ± 1.62 for the 
pubertal/post-pubertal subjects.  The distribution of age and body weight is shown in the figure below. 
Figure 1 Distribution of age and body weight Study HGT FIR 086 
Single-dose treatment with icatibant was given based on body weight (0.4 mg/kg) SC up to a maximal 
dose of 30 mg. The mean ± SD total SC dose of icatibant received were 14.0 ± 5.97 and 23.8 ± 5.15 mg 
for pre-pubertal subjects and pubertal/post-pubertal subjects, respectively. The minimum total dose 
received was 4.9 mg by a 3-year-old male subject weighing 12.3 kg, and the maximum total dose was 30 
mg of icatibant in 4 subjects whose body weight ≥75 kg. 
The individual plasma concentration-time profiles for icatibant are shown in the figure below.

Icatibant was rapidly absorbed in pediatric HAE subjects with a tmax of approximately 0.5 hours. 
Following administration of a single 0.4 mg/kg dose of icatibant, Cmax values of 659, 805, and 761 ng/mL 
were observed for the pre-pubertal with an HAE attack, pubertal/post-pubertal with an HAE attack, and 
pubertal/post-pubertal without an HAE attack, respectively. 
The mean AUC0-t was 1289, 1573, and 1398 h•ng/mL, for the pre-pubertal with an HAE attack, 
pubertal/post-pubertal with an HAE attack, and pubertal/post-pubertal without an HAE attack, 
respectively. The mean plasma clearance was 10.8, 13.1, and 19.3 L/hr, and the mean body weight 
normalized plasma clearance was 0.334, 0.256 and 0.285 L/hr/kg for the pre-pubertal with an HAE 
attack, pubertal/post-pubertal with an HAE attack, and pubertal/post-pubertal without an HAE attack, 
respectively. 
Based on these data, the paediatric subjects in this study appear to have exhibited lower systemic 
exposure to icatibant compared to adult HAE subjects receiving the marketed dose of 30 mg SC during an 
attack (previous Study JE049-2101). In JE049-2101, the Cmax was 815 ng/mL and the AUC was 1568 
h.ng/mL. However, the average dose of icatibant received in the current study was lower than in the 30 
mg dose prescribed for adults. 
The estimated exposure to the 2 metabolites is lower than to icatibant, as evaluated by AUC0-4, AUC0-t, 
and Cmax. Compared to icatibant, M1 and M2 were slowly formed (tmax ~2.0 hours post SC dose for 
pre-pubertal subjects with an attack, pubertal/post-pubertal subjects with an attack, and 
pubertal/post-pubertal subjects without an attack). The molar metabolite-to-parent exposure (AUC0-t) 
ratios were 1.09, 0.808, and 0.699 for M1 and 0.744, 0.618, and 0.562 for M2 for pre-pubertal subjects 
with an attack, pubertal/post-pubertal subjects with an attack, and pubertal/post-pubertal subjects 
without an attack, respectively. 
The relation between icatibant model derived plasma clearance and body weight is shown in the figure 
below.

Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling  
A 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag-time resulted in an adequate quality-of-fit. 
The population PK model included the effect of body weight on CL/F and apparent central volume 
distribution (Vc/F; traditional allometric function). The population PK models were evaluated/qualified

based on standard model diagnostics and by looking at pertinent graphical representations of 
goodness-of-fit. Typical population PK parameters of icatibant derived with the base model and 
representations of goodness-of-fit of the structural model were presented in the report titled “Population 
PK Modeling and Exposure-response Analysis of Icatibant in Children and Adolescents with Hereditary 
Angioedema”.  
Table 2 Typical Population PK Parameters of Icatibant Following SC Administration – Final 
Population PK Model 
CL/F = apparent total clearance; CLp/F = apparent inter-compartmental clearance; HAE = hereditary 
angioedema;

Vc/F = apparent volume of distribution in plasma; Vp/F = apparent peripheral volume of distribution. 
The CHMP noted that to compare with the PopPK model, a non-compartmental analysis of the observed 
PK data from study HGT-FIR-086 was performed. Individual values of clearance were calculated as the 
ratio of nominal dose (0.4 mg/kg capped at 30 mg which corresponds to a body weight of 75 kg) and 
AUC(0-Inf). A linear model (method lm in R) was fitted to individual values of clearance vs body weight 
centred to 70 kg. Both variables were log-transformed before calculation of regression coefficients. The 
slope of the regression line was estimated to 0.78 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.56 to 1.0. No 
definitive conclusion is made, however it should be noted that the point estimate differ compared to the 
Population PK model where the exponent of the clearance vs bodyweight relation was estimated to 0.516. 
In general, exposure to icatibant in paediatric subjects with HAE, as evaluated by Cmax and AUC, is lower 
than in adults (predominantly healthy, non-HAE subjects) due to the weight-adjusted doses received 
compared to a single nominal dose in adults regardless of weight. The CL/F of icatibant is related to body 
weight with lower clearance values noted for lower body weights in this paediatric population. Thus, at the 
same total dose administered, paediatric subjects with lower body weights would demonstrate higher 
exposure to icatibant compared to subjects with higher body weights.

Proposed paediatric dosing regimen 
Children and adolescents enrolled in Study HGT-FIR-086 received a single 0.4 mg/kg icatibant SC 
administration up to 30 mg (4.9 - 30 mg). Healthy volunteers received a single 30 mg icatibant SC dose 
with the exception of subjects from Study JE049-1102 who received a single 0.4 mg/kg icatibant SC dose 
(26 – 37 mg). Adult patients with HAE were treated with icatibant after an HAE attack either at 30 mg or 
45 mg. Of note, the recommended dose for adults is 30 mg. 
Based on the PK findings the MAH initially suggested a fixed dosing regimen in children. This was different 
from the regimen (0.4 mg/kg caped at 30 mg) that was studied. The proposed dose levels and weight 
bands are shown in the table below. 
Table 3 below presents the predicted exposure for the proposed paediatric 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg 
doses based on dosing band and comparatively,

Table 4 presents post-hoc PK parameters and PK parameters estimated by NCA from the adult 30 mg, 45 
mg, and 90 mg groups. 
The Applicant’s response included a discussion about dosing regimen and a proposal to use the studied 
regimen (0.4 mg/kg) instead of the initially proposed three weight band regimen. This was seen to result 
in a lower exposure in children compared to adults which was also concluded from the assessment of 
pharmacokinetics in the first round. Instead, for example an extension to 5 weight bands was suggested 
as an alternative to better mimic the adult exposure in children. The Applicant discussed this proposal in 
the response to the request for supplementary information in the second round.

The proposed dosing weight bands are based on the actual exposure observed in study HGT--FIR-086, 
the simulated exposure (using nonparametric simulation based on actual observed concentrations and 
nominal doses), and higher exposures seen in studies following higher dose SC administrations in adult 
HAE subjects (30 mg, N=120; 45 mg, N=4; and 90 mg, N=72).  
According to the population PK model the lightest subject (age=3.7 years; weight=12.3 kg) who received 
4.9 mg icatibant in study HGT-FIR-086 had a Cmax and AUC0-6 of 604 ng/mL and 744 ng.h/mL, 
respectively. Assuming a 10 mg SC dose was given to this subject, model predicted Cmax and AUC0-6 
would be 1232 ng/mL and 1518 ng.h/mL, respectively. 
Exposure-response analysis of time to onset of relief of symptoms 
One of the secondary endpoint of Protocol HGT-FIR-086 was the time to onset of relief of symptoms 
(TOSR). TOSR was measured in a total of 21 patients administered SC icatibant dose within 12 hours 
following an HAE attack. The mean TOSR was very short (1.38 h) and all subjects displayed resolution of 
symptoms within 4 h after icatibant administration. While patients with exposure values in the lower 
tertiles displayed the slowest onset of symptom relief, the rapid onset of response did not allow a 
discrimination of exposure-response between the 2nd and 3rd tertiles of exposure (see below). 
Figure 4 Probability of No Symptom Relief as a Function of AUC0-6 Tertiles in Study 
HGT-FIR-086 (PD Population) 
The CHMP noted that the analysis indicates that symptom relief is rapid in children. Possibly, there is an 
indication of slower onset in subjects with lower exposure. However, the data is very limited to draw 
definite conclusions. 
The applicant submitted documentation to amend information in section 5.2 of the SmPC to reflect the 
effect of age (elderly), gender and race on pharmacokinetics of icatibant. The data have been reviewed 
and the amendment is acceptable.

2.3.2.  Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of icatibant in children was investigated in a study including 31 subjects. Only two 
subjects were below 6 years of age. There were no subjects below 3 years of age. Approximately 80% of 
the subjects were > 10 years and had a body weight > 30 kg. The information about PK in the age range 
from 2 to 6 years of age is very limited and there is uncertainty in the expected exposure in this group of 
children. However, the available PK data show that icatibant clearance and distribution is related to body 
size. This supports body weight based dosing including in the younger children population. Of note, the 
studied 0.4 mg/kg dose results in slightly lower exposure compared to the adult dose of 30 mg which is 
also confirmed by modelling.  
It should be noted that the efficacy and safety in children treated with the 0.4 mg/kg dose was adequate. 
Nevertheless, the dosing regimen in children should provide an exposure that matches the adult exposure 
unless it can be clearly justified that the exposure-response in children is different. The MAH initially 
proposed a simplified dosing regimen with three weight bands. This regimen was considered too coarse as 
it would lead to unnecessary over exposure in some children. In the response to the first list of questions 
from the CHMP, the MAH proposed that dosing should be identical to the one applied in the pivotal 
paediatric study. The clinical feasibility of such a very detailed dosing regimen in an acute stressful clinical 
setting could potentially be questioned. Further, as noted above the studied dose led to slight under 
exposure. As an alternative option, a dose regimen with five weight bands could reduce the risk of over 
exposure (see figure below). The corresponding dosing table is slightly simplified compared to the figure 
for ease of use.

The dashed black line (“mg.kg”) denotes the studied dosing regimen (0.4 mg/kg). The solid black curve denotes the 
dosing regimen supported by PK analysis including modelling (“allo” referring to allometric scaling). The blue staircase 
shape (“alt.2”) with 5 steps is the dosing regimen suggested by the CHMP. The red staircase shape (“alt.1”) with 3 
steps is the dosing regimen initially proposed by the MAH. NB the staircase shapes coincide at certain body weights.

In the response to the request from the CHMP for supplementary information (second round), the MAH 
discussed the potential advantages, drawbacks and feasibility of the suggested regimen based on 5 
weight bands. This discussion was considered satisfactory and the proposed dosing regimen was agreed. 
The corresponding information has been introduced in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical Efficacy  
Title of study :  HTG-FIR-086  multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate 
the Pharmacokinetics, tolerability,safety, and efficacy on reproductive hormones, of a single 
subcutaneous (SC) administration of icatibant in approximately 30 pediatric subjects with Hereditary 
Angioedema (HAE) during an initial acute attack 
Methods – analysis of data submitted- sample size 
The paediatric study (HTG-FIR-086) evaluated the effect of a single standard subcutaneous (SC) 
administration of icatibant in children and adolescents aged 2 to <18 years with a documented diagnosis 
of HAE type I or II. The study is ongoing and will examine the effect of 3 total exposures of icatibant in 10 
adolescents who are currently being followed for this purpose. The data from the initial administration 
phase of the study is submitted for support of this variation. This includes complete data for the initial 
administration of icatibant from 11 pre-pubertal subjects during an HAE attack and 21 pubertal/post 
pubertal subjects (including 11 treated during an HAE attack and 10 treated without an attack). The study 
is an open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and 
safety, including effects on reproductive hormones of icatibant in pediatric subjects. 
Study participants 
Patients included had to have a documented diagnosis of HAE type I or II. Diagnosis may have been made 
on the basis of historical data: family history, characteristic attack manifestations, recurrent attacks, 
historical C1-INH deficiency, and exclusion of other forms of angioedema. Inclusion was permitted 
initially based on medical history only if a clear diagnosis had been made based on all of the preceding 
criteria. However, the diagnosis must have been confirmed prior to treatment by documented 
immunogenic and/or functional C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH protein level below the lower limit of normal 
and/or functional level <50% of normal) as performed by the sponsor’s central laboratory. 
Treatments 
Subjects received treatment with a single standard SC administration of icatibant on Day 1 and were 
monitored closely in the hospital/study center for at least 6-8 hours after treatment. Subjects underwent 
PK and safety assessments; efficacy assessments were performed if treatment occurred during an acute 
HAE attack. All subjects had serum reproductive hormone measurements. 
A subject was discharged after completion of assessments at 6 hours post-treatment, if deemed 
medically stable in the investigator’s clinical judgment, and, if applicable, the subject’s HAE symptoms 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 25/49 
 
  
  
had resolved (the subject’s investigator-rated symptom score was 0, denoting the absence of 
symptoms). If HAE symptoms had not completely resolved at 6 hours (ie, the investigator-rated 
symptom score was >0), the subject remained in the hospital/study center for at least 8 hours after 
icatibant administration for further evaluation. 
Telephone follow-up occurred at both 24 and 48 hours after treatment. 
Subjects returned to the hospital/study center for scheduled assessments on Day 8 and for a follow-up 
visit on Day 90. The investigator scheduled a telephone contact approximately 6 months after Day 1. 
Outcomes / endpoints  
Investigator Symptom Score 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to onset of symptom relief measured using the 
investigator-reported symptom score 
The investigator used a symptom score to assess the severity of symptoms of acute cutaneous, 
abdominal, and laryngeal attacks of HAE using the following 5-point scale: 
0=none; absence of symptoms 
1=mild (no to mild interference with daily activities) 
2=moderate (moderate interference with daily activities) 
3=severe (severe interference with daily activities) 
4=very severe (very severe interference with daily activities) 
Symptom scores were recorded on Day 1 at pretreatment and at predetermined time points after 
treatment. 
For attacks classified as cutaneous and/or abdominal, investigator-rated symptom scores were collected 
for 8 symptoms: abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, 
and skin swelling. 
For attacks classified as laryngeal, investigator-assessed symptom scores were collected for 13 
symptoms: abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, skin 
swelling, dysphagia, voice change, breathing difficulties, stridor, and asphyxia. 
The investigator assessed symptom scores at pretreatment; at 1, 2, 4, 6 hours post-treatment; and at 8 
hours post-treatment for subjects who did not have complete resolution of HAE symptoms at 6 hours. 
Subject Self-assessment of Pain 
Subjects who were at least 4 years of age self-assessed HAE-related pain using the Faces Pain 
Scale-Revised (FPS-R).  
Point to the face that shows how much you hurt

EMA/702004/2017

Investigator Assessment of Pain 
Subjects who were below 4 years of age underwent investigator assessment of HAE-related pain 
(cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal) using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) 
compartmental pain scale. The FLACC scale is a behaviour pain assessment scale for use in non-verbal 
patients. 
Other Analyses 
Time to first use of rescue medication: The number and percentage of subjects who received rescue 
medications before the onset of symptom relief were summarized.  
Investigator recorded time to initial symptom relief: The investigator was asked to record the date and 
time when overall subject improvement was first noted. The time to initial symptom relief was defined as 
the duration of time in hours from study drug administration until the time when overall subject 
improvement was first noted.  
The CHMP noted that the open label non-randomised design is acceptable taking the objectives and the 
characteristics of the disease into account. The methodology for efficacy evaluation can be considered 
appropriate and expected to provide a basis for comparison with the efficacy and safety documentation in 
adults that supported the approval of Firazyr. 
Based on the experience in adults relief of symptoms can be accepted as an indicator for reduction of 
oedema and if efficacy is demonstrated in cutaneous and abdominal HAE attacks similar effects can be 
expected in HAE attacks with laryngeal localisation. 
Statistical Methods 
The study sample size was not based on a formal sample size calculation. The study was planned to enroll 
a sufficient number of children and adolescents to ensure study completion of 30 evaluable subjects. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 27/49 
 
  
  
 
study population was planned to consist of at least 10 pre-pubertal and 20 pubertal/post-pubertal 
subjects from 2 to less than 18 years of age. This sample size was believed to provide basic information 
concerning the PK, tolerability and safety, and efficacy of icatibant in children and adolescents with HAE. 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
 
 
The Efficacy Population consists of those subjects who were treated with icatibant for their first 
and any additional attacks during the study. 
The Safety Population consists of those subjects who were treated with icatibant at least once 
during the study (irrespective of the presence of an HAE attack). 
All efficacy analyses were performed on the Efficacy Population. Safety and tolerability analyses were 
based on the Safety Population.  
No hypothesis testing was planned in the study and adjustment for multiple testing was considered not 
necessary. Study data were presented for descriptive purpose, using summary statistics and subject 
listings. Time-to-event efficacy variables were presented using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 25th, 50th 
(median), and 75th percentiles with associated 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the median, as 
well as percentage of censored observations.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to onset of symptom relief (TOSR) measured using the 
investigator-reported symptom score. Eight symptoms were assessed for abdominal and cutaneous 
attacks, and 13 symptoms were assessed for laryngeal attacks. Time to onset of symptom relief was 
defined as the duration of time in hours from study drug administration to the earliest time 
post-treatment at which there was at least a 20% improvement in the composite (or average) 
post-treatment symptom score with no worsening of any single component score. An alternative efficacy 
endpoint was the time to minimum symptoms measured using the investigator-reported symptom score. 
It was defined as the earliest time post-treatment when all symptoms were either mild or absent.  
Subjects who were at least 4 years of age performed self-assessment of pain using FPS-R. Time to onset 
of symptom relief was defined as the duration of time in hours from the time of study drug administration 
to the earliest time at which the post-treatment score improved by at least 1 level. 
For subjects who were younger than 4 years of age, the investigator assessed HAE-related pain 
(cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal) using FLACC. Time to onset of symptom relief was calculated from 
the time of study drug administration to the earliest time at which at least a 20% improvement was seen 
in the total post-treatment pain score.  
Interim analysis, that was performed and reported in the submitted CSR, covers only subjects’ single 
(initial) treated attack in the study. An independent DSMB was established to provide ongoing, 
independent review and assessment of the safety data, and to safeguard the interests and safety of the 
participating subjects in the study, according to the DSMB Charter and a separate DSMB SAP. Because no 
formal hypothesis testing was planned, multiplicity concerns regarding repeated analyses were not an 
issue. 
Handling of missing data in efficacy assessments were described in the SAP. Individual missing 
pretreatment scores were planned to be assigned a value of zero (or “absent” in case of 
investigator-rated symptom scores). This imputation method assumes that an investigator did not rate 
symptoms that were not present at pretreatment. Individual missing post-treatment scores were to be 
assigned the last non-missing value using last observation carried forward (LOCF). If the baseline 
observation was the last non-missing value it was to be carried forward as well. This imputation method 
assumes that if an investigator did not rate a symptom at a particular assessment, then there was no 
change from the previous assessment.

Safety data were presented by summary statistics of physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory evaluations, and immunogenicity, recording of concomitant medications, and monitoring of 
adverse events (AEs). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were summarized by system organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) by pubertal status stratification level. The number and percentage of 
subjects experiencing a TEAE, as well as total number of TEAEs, were summarized. Treatment-emergent 
AEs by SOC and PT also were summarized by severity and by relationship to treatment. 
Local tolerability included symptoms at the injection site and was assessed separately from general 
reports of adverse events. Local tolerability was summarized according to the type and severity of the 
injection site reaction. The change from baseline in the secretion of reproductive hormones was 
summarized descriptively. 
There were neither subgroup nor sensitivity analyses planned in the study. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
Changes from Protocol: It was defined in the protocol that the AEs would be categorized using MedDRA, 
Version 8.1. It was updated in the SAP that the MedDRA, Version 16.0 would be used. 
Changes from Statistical Analysis Plan: The DSMB noted that for several subjects, clinical pubertal status 
determination is not consistent with the reproductive hormone levels at baseline. Following DSMB’s 
recommendations, reproductive hormone tables and listings using the pubertal status based on hormonal 
data at baseline were added.

Demographics and Pre-treatment Characteristics 
Thirteen patients were enrolled in Europe, 10 in US and 7 in Israel, Australia and Colombia contributed 
with one patient each. 
In the efficacy population (patients treated during an HAE attack) 2 patients were below the age of 6, 6 
were 6-11 years old and 14 >11 years. 
The most common concomitant medications (>10% of subjects overall) were tranexamic acid (27.3%) 
and complement C1 esterase inhibitor (13.6%). 
The CHMP noted that the youngest patient at treatment was 3 years old and that only 2 patients were 
below the age of 6. It is understood that symptoms occur more rarely in infants but nevertheless the 
experience in young children is limited. However, given the rarity of the disease the data, although 
limited,  are considered acceptable to extrapolate to a population from 2 years onwards.  
The majority of patients were recruited outside Europe. However, the clinical characteristics and effects of 
treatment is not expected to differ with respect to ethnic origin in patients with confirmed C1-INH 
deficiency. 
Efficacy results 
Sixteen  subjects were experiencing a cutaneous attack: 8  pre-pubertal subjects and 8  
pubertal/post-pubertal subjects; 5 were experiencing an abdominal attack: 3  pre-pubertal subjects and 
2  pubertal/post-pubertal subjects, and 1 subject (pubertal/post-pubertal) experienced a cutaneous and 
abdominal attack. Overall, the mean time (SD) from attack onset to study drug administration was 6.1) 
hours (range 1.8 to 17.0).  
The CHMP noted that no patient treated for an attack of laryngeal oedema was included. However, the 
experience from adults indicates that doses being effective for an attack with cutaneous or abdominal 
symptoms are also effective in oedema with a laryngeal localisation. Extrapolation to the paediatric 
population could also be envisaged.  
Investigator Symptom score: Time to onset of symptom relief 
Time to symptom relief was defined as the duration of time in hours from study drug administration to the 
earliest time post-treatment at which there was at least a 20% improvement in the composite (or 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017

average) post-treatment symptom score with no worsening of any single component score. All 22 (100%) 
subjects experienced symptom relief. At 1 hour post-treatment, 50% of subjects had experienced 
symptom relief, and at 2 hours post-treatment 90% of subjects had experienced symptom relief.  
Time to Onset of Symptom Relief 
Investigator Symptom score: Time to minimum symptoms 
Time to minimum symptoms was defined as the duration of time in hours from study drug administration 
to the earliest time post-treatment when all symptoms were either mild or absent. One subject with all 
mild or absent symptoms at pretreatment was excluded from this analysis. All 21 (100.0%) subjects 
included in the analysis achieved minimum symptoms. Overall, the median time to minimal symptom was 
1.1 hours (95% CI: 1.0, 2.0). At 1 hour post-treatment, approximately 50% of subjects had minimal 
symptoms, and at 2 hours post-treatment approximately 80% of subjects had minimal symptoms. The 
time to minimal symptoms for both pubertal status groups was similar to the analysis of the overall 
population. 
Subject Self-assessment of Pain: Time to onset of symptom relief for FPS-R scores 
The median time to onset of pain relief was 1.0 hours (95% CI: 0.8, 1.0). At 1 hour post-treatment, 
approximately 80% of subjects had experienced pain relief, and at 2 hours post-treatment approximately 
95% of subjects had experienced pain relief. Time to pain relief as assessed by FPS-R for both pubertal 
status groups was similar to the analysis of the overall population. 
 Subject Self-assessment of Pain: Time to minimum symptoms for FPS-R scores 
Time to minimum symptoms for FPS-R was defined as the duration of time in hours from the time of study 
drug administration to the earliest time at which the post-treatment score improved to 0 (or no pain). 
Three subjects with pretreatment values of 0 were excluded from the analysis. A total of 16 (subjects 
included in the analysis achieved minimum symptoms. One subject who did not achieve minimum 
symptoms for FPS-R by 19 hours post-treatment was censored. Overall, median time to minimal 
symptom as assessed by the FPS-R was 3.4 hours (95% CI: 1.8, 5.3). At 2 hours post-treatment, 
approximately 40% of subjects had minimal symptoms, and at 6.5 hours post-treatment approximately 
80% of subjects had minimal symptoms. Time to minimal symptoms for both pubertal status groups was 
similar to the analysis of the overall population. At 2 hours post-treatment, approximately 40% of 
subjects had minimal symptoms, and at 6.5 hours post-treatment approximately 80% of subjects had 
minimal symptoms. 
Investigator assessment of pain, FLACC scores 
There were 2 subjects under age 4 years in this study who were eligible for FLACC assessments. One 
subject, who had a pretreatment FLACC score of 0, was excluded from the time-to-event analyses.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 31/49 
 
  
  
 
time to onset of pain relief as well as time to minimum symptoms was 1.0 hours for the subject with 
FLACC data. 
Time to First Use of Rescue Medication 
No subjects in the efficacy population received rescue medications before the onset of symptom relief for 
the icatibant treated HAE attack 
Investigator recorded time to initial symptom relief 
Median time to initial symptom relief was 1.0 hours (95% CI: 0.8, 1.1). At 1 hour post-treatment, 
approximately 70% of subjects had experienced initial symptom relief, and at 2 hours post-treatment 
approximately 95% of subjects had experienced initial symptom relief. Time to initial symptom relief for 
both pubertal status groups was similar to the analysis of the overall population. 
Comparison of results across studies 
The composite investigator-assessed symptom score in paediatric subjects with HAE attacks 
(HGT-FIR-086), and adult subjects with non-laryngeal HAE attacks (HGT-FIR-054) were plotted by study 
time point in the figure below. In HGT-FIR-054 only subjects with moderate to very severe non-laryngeal 
attacks were included in the analysis, while in study HGT-FIR-086 attacks at any severity were included, 
including mild, and no laryngeal attack was treated during the study. Thus, at pretreatment, for the 
pediatric study population, the mean (SD) composite investigator-assessed symptom score was 0.57  
which was milder when compared to the ITT population for the icatibant group of 0.81  and 0.83 for the 
placebo group. By 1 hour post-treatment, the mean (SD) change from pretreatment on composite 
investigator-assessed symptom score was -0.30 (0.34) for the paediatric population, and -0.29 (0.36) for 
the icatibant treated adult population, emphasizing similar response pattern in these two groups, 
regardless of attack severity. There was a similar change from pretreatment for composite 
investigator-assessed symptom score in both the paediatric population and the icatibant treated adult 
population at all other time points post-treatment. Mean Composite Investigator-Assessed Symptom

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The CHMP noted that the study was non-randomized, open-label, thus, prone to several sources of bias. 
There were no formal hypothesis testing and all statistical analyses were performed for descriptive 
purpose. 
Efficacy analysis was to be performed on efficacy population, which was defined as those subjects who 
were treated with icatibant for their first and any additional attacks. However, the analysis of several 
efficacy endpoints excluded subjects who were treated but had mild or no symptoms at pretreatment, 
although there were no pre-specified attack severity criteria required for the treatment as initially 
planned. In the SAP Rev. 3, presumably revised after a data review, it was stated that subjects with all 
investigator symptom scores as mild or absent at pretreatment, and subjects with FPS-R or FLACC value 
of zero at pretreatment, would be excluded from the efficacy analyses. Missing pretreatment values, 
according to this SAP, were to be imputed by ‘absent’ (investigator-rated symptom scores) or zero value, 
which also led to exclusion from the analysis. The outcome for the excluded subjects was not presented 
in the CSR. This is not in accordance with the ITT approach. Available efficacy data for the subjects who 
were excluded from the analysis has been presented with the requests for further information.  
Study HGT-FIR-086 was generally designed and conducted along the lines agreed by PDCO as part of the 
initial PIP and its subsequent modifications. Twenty two children 3.4 to 17.4 years old with a HAE 
diagnosis received Firazyr for an acute HAE attack. Most episodes were cutaneous and moderate in 
severity but there were also some more severe cases. There were no laryngeal attacks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 34/49 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Firazyr was administered within 1.8 to 17 hours after the attack (mean around 6 hours) and resulted in 
relatively fast symptom relief in the majority of patients.  In approximately 50% of the subjects onset of 
symptom relief, as evaluated by the investigator, occurred in an hour after Firazyr administration, with 
almost all patients showing symptom relief within the first 2 hours. All endpoints, either based on 
investigator’s evaluation or self-assessment, were consistent in showing a positive and relatively rapid 
effect of Firazyr treatment on HAE symptoms in the majority of patients. The results were also similar for 
pre-pubertal and pubertal/post-pubertal subjects.  
HGT-FIR-086 is an open label study and considering the lack of control, the small number of patients and 
the absence of disease specific tools to evaluate symptoms, robust conclusions on the efficacy of Firazyr 
in this setting have limitations. However, as previously acknowledged by PDCO, because of the rarity of 
the condition a large randomised controlled study in children would not be feasible. In fact the initially 
larger number of patients planned to be included in the efficacy part of the trial had to be revised because 
of difficulties with recruitment. Nevertheless, despite the unpredictable nature of the condition and the 
general difficulties in conducting such a study in children, a sufficient amount of data was collected 
indicating that Firazyr therapy can have a beneficial effect on symptoms following an acute HAE attack, 
with a general pattern similar to than seen in the adult studies. Overall the clinical package despite its 
limitations above mentioned is acceptable. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
In study HGT-FIR-086 children received a weight adjusted dose of 0.4mg/kg, ranging from 4.9 mg to 30 
mg (maximum dose). However, the MAH initially proposed a different regime with three doses based on 
weight bands: 10 mg (1.0 Ml) for children >10 kg to ≤25 kg; 20 mg (2.0 mL) for >25 kg to ≤50 kg; 30 
mg (3.0 mL) for >50 kg. Such a dosing would result in overdosing (compared to the 0.4mg/Kg dose used 
in HGT-FIR-086) in the majority of children. At the most extreme, patients close to the lower bound of 
each of the suggested weight bands will receive almost double the dose compared to those tested in the 
pivotal trial. As discussed in the section Clinical Pharmacology, a dosing regimen based on 5 weight bands 
was eventually considered appropriate for providing exposures close to the adult target exposure.  
In the same context, the MAH also suggests, in the updated SmPC and PIL, that Firazyr may be 
administered by a caregiver “after training in subcutaneous injection technique by a healthcare 
professional”. In general, there are advantages if a caregiver is able to administer the drug, if necessary.  
The MAH notes that although icatibant was administered by healthcare professionals in HGT-FIR-086, 
caregiver administration is permitted in the ongoing part of the study assessing. They also support that 
immediate access to treatment may result in faster relief of pain and swelling, and experience from 
self-administration in adults suggests that this can be a safe and efficacious practice. The arguments are 
acknowledged and the findings of the ongoing part of the study will help confirming the usefulness but 
also potential problems with administration by a caregiver. The Applicant has on the CHMP request 
further justified the possibility to allow administration of a caregiver .This proposal can therefore be 
accepted and it is considered that appropriate information has been included in the product information.  
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, despite the limitations the HGT-FIR-086 results suggest that, as in adults, Firazyr can be an 
efficacious treatment option for acute HAE attacks in children from the age of 2 years.

2.5.  Clinical safety  
Patient exposure 
Overall, 32 (100.0%) subjects received an initial dose of the study drug in HGT-FIR-086. At the time of 
the analyses included in this SCS, 1 pubertal/post-pubertal subject had also been treated with icatibant 
for a second HAE attack. 
Adverse events  
There were a total of 32 TEAEs in 9 (28%) subjects. The pre-pubertal group experienced fewer TEAEs 
than the pubertal/post-pubertal group: 9 TEAEs in 2 (18%) pre-pubertal subjects. 
Table 6: Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
The most frequent TEAEs were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders with 9 events in 3 (9.4%) subjects. 
Headache, experienced by 2 subjects, was the only TEAE experienced by more than 1 subject. 
Table 7: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 36/49 
 
  
  
 
 
Based on the closest relationship to study drug of a particular TEAE, 8 (25.0%) subjects experienced 
TEAEs that were assessed by the investigator to be not related and 1 (3.1%) experienced 2 TEAEs that 
were assessed by the investigator as possibly related (a mild attack of dry mouth and a mild attack of 
fatigue, both of which resolved). 
Based on the most severe occurrence of a particular TEAE, 7 (21.9%) subjects experienced a mild TEAE 
and 2 (6.3%) subjects experienced a moderate TEAE. No subjects experienced a severe TEAE. At the time 
of the analysis included in this SCS, 1 pubertal/post-pubertal subject had been treated with icatibant for 
a second HAE attack. No AEs were reported by this subject following the subsequent icatibant treatment. 
Injection site reactions were experienced by 29 (90.6%) subjects. The most frequently noted injection 
site reactions were erythema (27 subjects) and swelling (22 subjects). The majority of injection site 
reactions were mild or moderate in intensity. Two  subjects experienced injection site reactions that were 
assessed as severe, both resolved at 6 hours postdose. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically significant changes in laboratory values were observed during the treatment period for either 
treatment group. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were noted. 
Anti-icatibant antibodies were measured in samples drawn at prospectively defined time points. No 
subjects were antibody-positive at baseline, Day 8 post-treatment, or Day 90 post-treatment. 
The CHMP noted that the systemic adverse event was of mild or moderate severity and the pattern 
appears benign. The majority of events were judged as not related to study drug.  
Adverse events judged as related to study drug were injection site reactions most of which had resolved 
at 6 hours. The safety characteristics appear consistent with what has been observed in adults. 
Other significant events  
Reproductive hormones  
In addition to its roles in vasodilation, vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction, bradykinin 
has been implicated to play a role in control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormonal system. In 
nonclinical studies performed in rat and dog, high repeated doses of icatibant have been associated with 
effects on sexual organs and sexual maturation.  
A Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (HGT-FIR-062) evaluated the effect of 
repeated administration of SC icatibant 30 mg on reproductive parameters (serum reproductive hormone 
levels in males and premenopausal females, and seminal fluid analysis in males) in healthy adults prior to 
investigational use in the paediatric population. Subjects were randomized to receive icatibant or placebo 
as a single SC injection at 6-hour intervals 3 times daily on Days 1, 4, and 7 of the treatment week (a total 
of 9 doses/week) with an 8-week follow-up phase. A total of 39 healthy adult subjects (23 males and 16 
females) with normal reproductive hormone levels were enrolled and randomized to treatment with either 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 37/49 
 
  
  
 
icatibant or placebo. Twenty subjects were treated with icatibant and 19 received placebo. Repeated 
doses of icatibant had no clinically concerning effect on basal or stimulated levels of circulating 
reproductive hormones or on other fertility parameters in healthy male and female adult subjects in this 
study. Specifically, no clinically significant changes from baseline in basal and GnRH-stimulated 
concentrations of reproductive hormones (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], 
dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate [DHEA-S], sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG], FSH, LH, and inhibin-B 
in males and oestradiol, progesterone, prolactin, DHEA, DHEA-S, SHBG, FSH, and LH in females) were 
observed in subjects exposed to icatibant. Additionally, there were no significant effects of icatibant on 
the concentration of luteal phase progesterone, an indicator of ovulation status and luteal function, or on 
menstrual cycle length in females, and there were no significant effects of icatibant on semen parameters 
in males.  
In the paediatric study (HTG-FIR-086) other than progesterone levels in pre-pubertal subjects, the 
majority of subjects were categorized as normal at all time points. Three (60.0%) pre-pubertal subjects 
had low progesterone levels at pre-treatment, 6 hours post-treatment, and Day 8 post-treatment. At Day 
90, 2 (40.0%) pre-pubertal subjects continued to have low levels of progesterone. 
Table 8: Reproductive Hormone Assessments (Females) 
No clinically significant changes in reproductive hormones in males were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 38/49 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 9: Reproductive Hormone Assessments (Males): 
The CHMP noted a rather pronounced inter- and intra-individual variability of the levels of reproductive 
hormones without a distinct pattern in relation to study drug administration was observed. Nevertheless, 
there seems to be a slight trend for a reduction of oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone levels at 
different time points. Taking the expected infrequent need for administration of icatibant in the majority 
of patients, where usually a single dose is sufficient for treatment of an attack, no long-term 
consequences of the modest transient fluctuations are to be expected. For patients with frequent attacks 
in need of treatment the situation may be different. The MAH has appropriately addressed these concerns 
and further clarifications in the RMP is provided.  
Post marketing experience 
Postmarketing safety data are consistent with the safety profile observed in clinical trials of icatibant. 
Injection site reactions were the most commonly reported events. 
Cumulatively, 23 cases of icatibant use in children and adolescents (aged <18 years) were received from 
postmarketing surveillance. The majority of events reported concerned injection site reactions. 
In addition to routine pharmacovigilance and data collection from post-marketing sources, the company 
has implemented a FIRAZYR patient registry. This voluntary registry (known as the Icatibant Outcome 
Survey [IOS]) is a long-term, international, multicenter, prospective, observational study open to all 
patients receiving FIRAZYR (icatibant injection) treatment. 
As of April 2016, the IOS database included 5 patients who received icatibant for an HAE type I or II attack 
when <18 years of age. Details follow for each patient who received icatibant when younger than 18 years 
of age.  
One patient was treated 4 times for 3 severe laryngeal attacks. The first attack occurring around 17years 
of age required treatment with 2 doses of icatibant, with 8 hours between doses; resolution of symptoms 
occurred 2 hours following the second dose. The 2 other angioedema attacks occurred in a short 
timeframe and time to resolution was ~3 days for each of these attacks. All doses of icatibant were 
administered at a hospital emergency department by a healthcare provider. No AEs were reported.  
Another patient was treated for 2 abdominal attacks: 1 severe around the age of 17 with resolution of 
symptoms at ~22 hours and 1 very severe after two months  with resolution of symptoms at ~6.5 hours. 
Icatibant was self-administered once in the hospital for the first attack and self-administered once at 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 39/49 
 
  
  
home for the second attack. No AEs were reported. This patient received concomitant/rescue medication 
(antifibrinolytics) for each attack.  
Another patient was treated for a moderate skin attack around the age of 16 with resolution of symptoms 
at ~4 hours. Icatibant was administered once in the hospital by a healthcare provider. No AEs were 
reported. This patient received concomitant/rescue medication (C1 inhibitor [C1-INH] concentrate).  
One patient was treated for 10 severe abdominal attacks around the age of 16 and 17. Each attack was 
treated with 1 dose of icatibant; resolution of symptoms for each attack occurred in <24 hours. Icatibant 
was administered in an outpatient setting by a healthcare provider for the first 2 attacks and administered 
at home by a caregiver for the remaining 8 attacks. No AEs were reported.  
One patient  was treated for 4 abdominal attacks: 2 with moderate intensity around the age of 16, and 2 
with severe intensity after about one year. Each attack was treated with 1 dose of icatibant; resolution of 
symptoms for each attack occurred in <24 hours, with the exception of the moderate attack around 16 
years of age for which resolution status is unknown. Icatibant was administered at home by a caregiver 
for the first attack and at home by a healthcare provider for the remaining 3 attacks. No AEs were 
reported.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Study HGT-FIR-086 provided safety data from 32 children who received a single dose of Firazyr (22 
during an acute HAE attack).  
Consistently with the adult studies, a high number of injection site reactions were reported that affected 
the majority of patients. No other important safety issues were identified. Firazyr’s immunogenic 
potential appears low and there was no clear indication of significant laboratory or ECG abnormalities. 
Also the results of reproductive hormones measurements do not suggest a clinically significant effect.  
In general, in Study HGT-FIR-086 there were no unexpected findings and no serious events, indicating a 
general safety profile similar to that in adults. Still the high frequency of injections site reaction is of 
concern. Although the reactions were for the most part mild-moderate and resolved within hours this is an 
important issue than needs to be further considered in the light of the currently proposed posology in 
children. 
Several possible mechanisms were previously suggested to explain the injection site reactions with 
Firazyr seen in the adult studies but the rather large injection volume of 3 ml was also implicated. In 
Study HGT-FIR-086 children received doses from 4.9 mg to 30 mg (0.49ml – 3ml) based on a 0.4mg/Kg 
posology. As noted in the previous sections of this report with the currently recommended posology and 
use of fixed doses based on weight bands, the majority of children will receive higher doses than those 
administered in the pivotal trial. It is clear that the possibility of more serious injection site reactions due 
to the larger volume cannot be excluded and this is particularly relevant to younger children. It should be 
noted here that the “Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use” 
(EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2) states that normally subcutaneous injection volumes should not 
exceed 1 ml (with even lower volumes advised for infants).    
In conclusion, in Study HGT-FIR-086 the administration of Firazyr in children raised no major safety 
concerns and the overall safety profile appears similar to adults.  
Some patients experienced frequent HAE attacks (e.g. weekly). It cannot be excluded that very frequent 
administration of icatibant in such patients would be associated with long-term safety problems such as 
more permanent effects on reproductive hormones or immunogenic complications, affecting efficacy or 
safety.

Clinicians prescribing icatibant off-label for use in subjects <18 years of age have been encouraged to 
enroll those patients into the ongoing IOS Patient Registry study. As of 29 February 2016, the IOS 
database included 21 children aged <18 years of age (range 3.5-17.9 years). According to the study 
protocol, effects on sexual maturation in pubertal adolescents will be measured using Tanner staging and, 
if available, sexual hormone level measurements will be recorded before, during, and after puberty. 
 The MAH has clarified that the ongoing IOS register study will continue to monitor effects on sexual 
maturation in pubertal adolescents, although, the enrolment in the study is voluntarily. Moreover, the 
ongoing study HGT-FIR-086 evaluates the effect on reproductive hormone levels in pubertal/ 
post-pubertal children after repeated exposures. Both study IOS and HGT-FIR-086 are included in the 
Pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP for icatibant. The ‘effect on reproductive hormone levels in pubertal/ 
post-pubertal children’ has been included as an important potential risk in the RMP, addressed by the 
studies IOS and HGT-FIR-086. 
Monitoring of medication error (e.g. appropriate schedule, correct technique) include administrations by 
health care professional, by caregiver and self-administration. Administration mode 
(caregiver/self-administration/HCP administration) should be specified when presenting data on 
medication errors in future PSURs. The Applicant has stated in the response to the CHMP request that the 
effectiveness and safety of caregiver administration will continue to be monitored in study HGT-FIR-086 
and study IOS alongside routinely PhV activities. The studies HGT-FIR-086 and IOS registry have been 
included as additional PhV activities for the safety concern ‘Medication error’. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall the safety data are acceptable and updated information was included in the RMP. Additionally the 
SmPC has been updated appropriately to reflect safety in the paediatric population.   
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6. of the 
SmPC have been updated. Particularly, a new dosage has been added for the paediatric population to the 
product information. The possibility of caregiver/self-administration has also been introduced. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity  
 -to reflect the results of a juvenile toxicity study in SmPC section 5.3,  
-to update section 5.2 of the SmPC to reflect the effect of age (elderly), gender and race on 
pharmacokinetics of icatibant.  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. All relevant pharmacokinetics studies have previously been 
assessed, as part of prior submissions. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Minor changes have been introduced in the annex II.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The clinical presentation and management of hereditary angioedema in paediatric patients is different 
from adults and also more complex. The age at onset, frequency and duration of symptoms, as well as 
severity of attacks all exhibit substantial interindividual variation. Although acute episodes of HAE may 
occur at any age, the median age at first symptomatic HAE attack is estimated to range between 4 and 11 
years. Subcutaneous oedema of the extremities, face, neck, torso, and genitals is the most common, and 
usually the earliest, manifestation of HAE seen in children. In the GI tract, submucosal oedema may be 
associated with colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. In a large paediatric cohort, 
increased frequency and severity of HAE symptoms were reported at between 3 and 6 years of age and 
at around puberty and were attributed to physiological changes which occur during these periods of 
development. 
Though infrequent compared to cutaneous and abdominal manifestations, attacks of acute HAE involving 
the larynx may result in submucosal oedema of the upper airways and risk of death by asphyxiation if 
undiagnosed and/or untreated. In comparison to adults, asphyxia may ensue more rapidly in children 
because of smaller airway diameter. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options for children with HAE according to current guidelines include antifibrinolytics, 
attenuated androgens, and plasma-derived C1-INH replacement therapy. 
This variation is supported by a clinical data from an interim report of an ongoing paediatric study 
(HTG-FIR-086) evaluated the effect of a single standard subcutaneous administration of icatibant in 
children and adolescents aged 2 to <18 years with a documented diagnosis of hereditary angioedema 
(HAE) type I or II. The study is ongoing and will examine the effect of 3 total exposures of icatibant in 10 
adolescents who are currently being followed. The data now submitted includes the data for the initial 
administration of icatibant from 11 pre-pubertal subjects during an HAE attack and 21 
pubertal/post-pubertal subjects (including 11 treated during an HAE attack and 10 treated without an 
attack).  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The open-label, non-randomized, single-armed study design is acceptable taking the rarity of the 
condition into account. A design including an active comparator (plasma-derived or recombinant C1 
esterase inhibitor (C1 INH)) would theoretically be an alternative. However, such a design would be 
challenging from a pragmatic perspective and would probably not provide additional useful information. 
It can be foreseen that it would be difficult to establish a meaningful non-inferiority margin. It can 
furthermore be assumed that the pathogenic mechanisms behind the typical symptoms in patients with 
low C1 INH is similar in children and adults which to some extent allows extrapolation of the experience 
in adults to children.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 45/49 
 
  
  
The support from the characterisation of pharmacokinetics is important for establishing appropriate dose 
recommendations in children of different age. In this rare disorder only very limited efficacy and safety 
data from clinical studies in children can be expected, but considering the pharmacodynamic action of the 
drug and the well-known pathogenic mechanism behind the symptoms in this condition, efficacy and 
safety data from adults can be judged as relevant also for the children. Thus with reasonably well justified 
dosing recommendations for children based on available PK data and modelling together with a bridge 
from the clinical experience in adults, the limitations of paediatric clinical data can be accepted. The data 
presented in this application are acceptable to extrapolate to patients from the age of 2 years. 
It should be noted that the efficacy and safety in children treated with the 0.4 mg/kg dose was adequate. 
Nevertheless, the clinical feasibility of such a very detailed dosing regimen in an acute stressful clinical 
setting could potentially be questioned. Further, the studied dose led to slight under exposure. As an 
alternative option, a dose regimen with five weight bands was considered appropriate and justified in the 
clinical setting. The study is ongoing and will provide further safety data on the recruited patients and in 
accordance with the compliance on the paediatric investigation plan. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The observed time to relief of symptoms associated with attacks of angioedema supports the conclusion 
that administration of icatibant provides a similar symptomatic benefit during an HAE attack in children as 
in adults. At 1 hour post-treatment, 50% of subjects had experienced symptom relief, and at 2 hours 
post-treatment 90% of subjects had experienced symptom relief. An untreated HAE attack is reported in 
the literature to have a duration of 3-5 days.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is very limited experience of repeated treatment in children. One single injection seems to provide 
satisfactory relief of symptoms during an attack in most patients. The frequency of HAE attacks vary 
considerably between individuals and there is no or very limited experience from repeated treatment in 
children. This is reflected in the PI. The experience in the smaller children is very limited, due to rareness 
of the condition but also due to the fact that the first clinical symptoms often occur at somewhat higher 
age. Thus, dosing recommendations must in part rest on pharmacokinetic modelling in addition to the 
clinical study results.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The adverse events in the paediatric studies were dominated by local reactions at injection site such as 
swelling and erythema. No serious systemic reactions were reported. Icatibant antibodies were followed 
prospectively and no antibody formation was reported. The fluctuations in reproductive hormones after a 
single injection are not judged to be of concern. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The experience from treatment in children is still limited and very few patients have had repeated 
injections. Preclinical data seems to indicate that long-term administration of icatibant may affect 
reproductive hormone levels. The Applicant has appropriately discussed these concerns and treated 
patients will be followed up in the post marketing setting as detailed in the RMP. 
The immunogenic potential of icatibant appears to be low, which is supported from the experience in 
Assessment report  
EMA/702004/2017 
Page 46/49 
 
  
  
adults where the experience from repeated treatment is rapidly growing.  
Very few small children under the age of 6 were included in the paediatric study and the inclusion of the 
very young children is heavily dependent on accurate estimations of exposure and extrapolation from the 
efficacy and safety characteristics observed in older children and adults.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
An HAE attack can be life threating when localised to larynx. In such situations it is utterly important that 
the situation is brought under control. Symptomatic relief provided by blockage of the bradykinin receptor 
can reliably be judged to represent regression of swelling. Furthermore, efficacy documented in 
cutaneous or abdominal attacks can be extrapolated to attacks of laryngeal oedema considering the 
pathogenic similarity and the experience in adults. Icatibant represents a different mechanism of action 
as compared to plasma derived (Berinert, Cinryze) or recombinant C1 INH (Rhuconest) and can be of 
considerable value in e.g. hypersensivity against C1 INH products. That the drug is administered 
subcutaneously is also an important advantage facilitating rapid treatment in e.g. the home setting.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite its limitation of the clinical efficacy data (design, limited number of children), the CHMP 
considered that the data are sufficient to support the use in children from the age of 2 years onwards.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The benefit-risk balance of Firazyr is positive in children above 2years of age.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Vaxelis (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib) is indicated for primary and booster vaccination in infants and toddlers
from the age of 6 weeks, against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive
diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).
The use of Vaxelis should be in accordance with official recommendations.

4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
Primary vaccination:
The primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses, with an interval of at least 1 month
between doses, and may be given from 6 weeks of age, in accordance with the official
recommendations. 
Where a dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at birth, Vaxelis can be used for supplementary doses of
hepatitis B vaccine from the age of 6 weeks. If a second dose of hepatitis B vaccine is required before
this age, monovalent hepatitis B vaccine should be used. Vaxelis can be used for a mixed
hexavalent/pentavalent/hexavalent combined vaccine immunisation schedule.
Booster vaccination:
After a 2-dose or a 3-dose primary series vaccination with Vaxelis, a booster dose should be given at
least 6 months after the last priming dose. Vaxelis may be used as a booster dose in children who
received another hexavalent vaccine for their primary series. When a booster dose with a hexavalent
DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) containing vaccine is not available, a dose of Hib
vaccine must be administered, as a minimum.
Other paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Vaxelis in infants less than 6 weeks of age have not been established. No
data are available. 
No data are available in older children (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
Method of administration 
Vaxelis should only be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. The recommended injection sites
are the anterolateral area of the thigh (preferred site for infants under one year of age) or the deltoid
muscle of the upper arm. 
For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
History of an anaphylactic reaction after a previous administration of Vaxelis or a vaccine containing
the same components or constituents.
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or to trace
residuals (glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B, and bovine serum
albumin).
Encephalopathy of unknown aetiology, occurring within 7 days following prior vaccination with a
pertussis containing vaccine. In these circumstances, pertussis vaccination should be discontinued, and
the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and Hib
vaccines.
Uncontrolled neurologic disorder or uncontrolled epilepsy: pertussis vaccination should not be
administered until treatment for the condition has been established, the condition has stabilised, and
the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Protection
Vaxelis will not prevent disease caused by pathogens other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae,
Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, hepatitis B virus, poliovirus or Haemophilus influenzae type
b. However, it can be expected that hepatitis D will be prevented by immunisation as hepatitis D
(caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.
Vaxelis will not protect against hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis
C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens.
Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis B, it is possible for unrecognised hepatitis B
infection to be present at the time of vaccination. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in
such cases. 
Vaxelis does not protect against disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae other than type b or by
other microorganisms that cause invasive disease such as meningitis or sepsis, including N.
meningitidis.
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees.
Prior to immunisation
Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the individual's medical history (in particular, previous
vaccinations and possible adverse reactions). 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be readily
available for immediate use in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the
vaccine (see section 4.3).
As with other vaccines, administration of Vaxelis should be postponed in children suffering from
moderate to severe acute disease, with or without fever. The presence of a minor illness and /or low-
grade fever does not constitute a contraindication.
If any of the following events have occurred after administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine, the
decision to administer further doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully considered: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Temperature of ≥40.5°C within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause
Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode [HHE]) within 48 hours of
vaccination
Persistent crying lasting ≥3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination
Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.
There may be some circumstances, such as high incidence of pertussis, when the potential benefits
outweigh possible risks.
If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior vaccine containing tetanus
toxoid, the decision to give any vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, including Vaxelis, should be based
on careful consideration of the potential benefits and possible risks. 
A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
4
(SIDS) do not constitute a contraindication for the use of Vaxelis. Individuals with a history of febrile
convulsions should be closely followed up as febrile convulsions may occur within 2 to 3 days post
vaccination.
Do not administer by intravascular, intradermal or subcutaneous injection.
Special populations
Premature infants
Limited data from 111 pre-term newborn infants in clinical trials indicate that Vaxelis can be given to
premature infants. The immune responses to Vaxelis in these infants were generally similar to those of
the overall study population. However, a lower immune response may be observed, and the level of
clinical protection is unknown.
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be
considered when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born
≤28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity.
As the benefit of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or
delayed.
Genetic Polymorphism
Immune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism.
Immunocompromised children
The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or
immunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or
disease. Nevertheless, vaccination of individuals with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection
is recommended even if the antibody response may be limited.
Blood disorders
As with all injectable vaccines, the vaccine must be administered with caution to individuals with
thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular
administration.
Interference with laboratory testing
Since the Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen is excreted in the urine, a false positive urine test can be
observed using sensitive tests, for at least 30 days following vaccination. Other tests should be
performed in order to confirm Hib infection during this period. 
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Vaxelis may be administered simultaneously with pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccines,
rotavirus vaccines, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella containing vaccines,
meningococcal B and C conjugate vaccines.
Data from a clinical study indicate that, when Vaxelis is co-administered with pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV13), the rate of fever is higher following the booster dose in the second year of
life compared to the primary series. Almost all fevers were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient
(duration of ≤2 days) (see section 4.8).
Co-administration of Vaxelis with other injectable vaccines must be carried out at separate injection
5
sites and, preferably, separate limbs.
Vaxelis should not be mixed with any other vaccine or other parenterally administered medicinal
products.
Immunosuppressive therapy may interfere with the development of expected immune response (see
section 4.4).
Due to an increased risk of fever, tenderness at the injection site, change in eating habits and
irritability when a different hexavalent vaccine with a similar reactogenicity profile to Vaxelis was co-
administered with Meningococcal B vaccine, separate vaccinations can be considered.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
This vaccine is not intended for administration to women of child-bearing potential.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vaxelis is indicated for infants and toddlers; therefore, no studies have been conducted to assess its
effect on the ability to drive or use machines. It is expected that the vaccine will have negligible or no
effects in this regard.
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported adverse reactions after Vaxelis administration were irritability, crying,
somnolence, injection site reactions (pain, erythema, swelling), pyrexia (≥38°C), decreased appetite,
and vomiting.
The safety of Vaxelis in children over 15 months of age has not been studied in clinical trials.
In a clinical study where Vaxelis was administered concomitantly with Prevenar 13 (PCV13) as a
booster dose of both vaccines, fever ≥38.0°C was reported in 52.5% of children, compared to 33.1% to
40.7% of children during the primary series. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 3.7% of children (post-
booster) and 0.2% to 0.8% of children (post-primary) receiving Vaxelis with PCV13 (see sections 4.4
and 4.5). Almost all fevers after primary and booster doses were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and
transient (duration of ≤2 days).

bDid not receive hepatitis B vaccine at birth
Regarding PT and FIM, similar response rates and higher GMCs were observed both post-primary and
post-booster in comparison to control vaccine. Lower FHA, PRN, IPV1 (Inactivated poliovirus
vaccine) and IPV3 immune responses were observed after a 2-dose primary schedule (2, 4 months),
although the clinical relevance of these data remains uncertain. Pertussis response rates were similar to
the control vaccine for all pertussis antigens after the booster dose.
The immunogenicity of Vaxelis administered to children over 15 months of age has not been studied
in clinical trials.
In an open-label study, Vaxelis was given as a booster dose to 167 healthy children approximately 11-
13 months of age who previously received a 2-dose primary series of either Vaxelis (N=85) or another
hexavalent vaccine with 2 pertussis components (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib; N=82) as part of routine
vaccination. A booster dose of Vaxelis was well tolerated and induced an increase of the humoral
immune responses to all antigens. At 30 days post-boost, at least 89% of the children had a
seroresponse defined as protective against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and invasive
Haemophilus influenzae type b disease.
Persistence of the immune response
Hepatitis B immune memory 
The persistence of immune responses was evaluated in children up to 8 years after primary vaccination
with Vaxelis. The proportions of these children with anti-HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL after having received
Vaxelis either at 2, 4, and 11-12 months or at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age, respectively, were: 
•  65.8% (119 of 181) and 70.2% (134 of 191), respectively, at 4 or 5 years of age;
•  40.9% (38 of 93) and 49.1% (55 of 112), respectively, at 8 or 9 years of age.
A hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose was given to children 8 or 9 years of age. Approximately
1 month after this challenge dose, the proportions with anti-HBsAg ≥ 10 mIU/mL were 100% (93 of
93) and 99.1% (108 of 109), respectively. These data demonstrate an anamnestic response after a
challenge dose, indicating the persistence of hepatitis B immune memory in persons who previously
received Vaxelis.
9
Persistence of antibodies to pertussis antigens
The persistence of pertussis antibodies was measured in children 4 or 5 years of age who had received
Vaxelis at 2, 4, and 11-12 months of age. The percentages of these children with anti-pertussis
antibodies ≥ the lower limit of quantification were: anti-PT 58.4%, anti-FHA 80.9%, anti-PRN 66.1%,
and anti-FIM 94.4%.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What is Vaxelis and what it is used for
Vaxelis is a vaccine, which helps to protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis
B, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaxelis is given to
children from the age of six weeks.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria
and viruses that cause the following diseases:
• 
Diphtheria: a bacterial infection that usually first affects the throat, causing pain and swelling
which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the
heart, kidneys and nerves.
Tetanus (often called lock jaw): caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. The
bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to breathe
and the possibility of suffocation.
Pertussis (often called whooping cough): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It
causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a
“whooping” sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can
also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung
infections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death.
Hepatitis B: caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). In
some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious
liver problems, including liver cancer.
Poliomyelitis (often just called polio): caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to
paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control
breathing and swallowing can be fatal.
Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib infections): serious bacterial
infections causing meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead
to brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation
and swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can
affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints.
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Important information about the protection provided
• 
Vaxelis will only help to prevent these diseases caused by the bacteria and viruses targeted by
32
the vaccine. Vaxelis does not protect your child against diseases caused by other bacteria and
viruses that may cause similar symptoms.
The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the
infectious diseases against which it protects.
As with any vaccine, Vaxelis may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine.
• 
•
2.  What you need to know before Vaxelis is given to your child 
To make sure that Vaxelis is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if any
of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse to explain.
Do not use Vaxelis if your child:
• 
− 
− 
has had shortness of breath or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration of
a previous dose of Vaxelis.
is allergic (hypersensitive)
− 
to Vaxelis vaccine or any diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib
containing vaccines,
to any ingredients listed in section 6,
to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B (antibiotics) and
bovine serum albumin, as these substances are used during the manufacturing process.
has suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior
dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis).
has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system
(uncontrolled neurologic disorder) or uncontrolled epilepsy.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child:
• 
has a moderate to severe acute disease, with or without fever (e.g. sore throat, cough, cold or
flu). Vaccination with Vaxelis may need to be delayed until your child is better.
has had any of the following events after receiving a vaccine against pertussis (whooping
cough), as the decision to give further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be
carefully considered:
− 
− 
had a fever of 40.5°C or above within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause.
became floppy, unresponsive or unconscious after the previous vaccination, within 48
hours of vaccination.
cried continuously and could not be comforted for more than 3 hours within 48 hours of
vaccination.
had a fit (convulsions) with or without fever, within 3 days of vaccination.
− 
− 
previously had Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary loss of feeling and movement) after being
given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of tetanus toxin). Your doctor
will decide whether to give Vaxelis to your child.
is receiving a treatment (such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or has a disease that
suppresses or weakens the body’s ability to fight infections. It is recommended to postpone
vaccination until the end of such treatment or disease. However, children with long standing
problems with their immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Vaxelis
but the protection may not be as good as in children with a healthy immune system.
suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. Your
doctor or nurse will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination, once the condition is
stabilised.
suffers from fits during a fever, or there is family history of fits occurring during a fever.
has any problems with bleeding for a long time after minor cuts, or bruises easily. Your doctor
will advise you whether your child should receive Vaxelis. 
was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation). In these infants, longer gaps
than normal between breaths may occur for 2 to 3 days after vaccination.

Other medicines or vaccines and Vaxelis
Tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking or has recently taken or might take any other
medicines or vaccines.
Vaxelis can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles-
mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, or meningococcal B or C vaccines.
Your doctor or nurse will give these injections at different sites and will use different syringes and
needles for each injection.
Driving and using machines
It is expected that Vaxelis will have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use
machines.
Vaxelis contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
3.  How Vaxelis is given
Vaxelis will be given to your child by a doctor or nurse trained in the use of vaccines and who are
equipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection (see section 4 Possible
side effects).
Your doctor or nurse will inject Vaxelis into your child’s thigh (in infants from the age of 6 weeks) or
arm (in children older than one year).
The recommended dose is as follows:
First course of vaccination (primary vaccination)
Your child will receive two or three injections given at least one month apart. Your doctor or nurse will
tell you when your child should come back for their next injection as per the local vaccination
program.
Additional injection (booster)
After the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local
recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you
when this dose should be given.
If your child misses a dose of Vaxelis
If your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse
who will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the
course of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What is Vaxelis and what it is used for
Vaxelis is a vaccine, which helps to protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis
B, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. Vaxelis is given to
children from the age of six weeks.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria
and viruses that cause the following diseases:
• 
Diphtheria: a bacterial infection that usually first affects the throat, causing pain and swelling
which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the
heart, kidneys and nerves.
Tetanus (often called lock jaw): caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. The
bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to breathe
and the possibility of suffocation.
Pertussis (often called whooping cough): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It
causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a
“whooping” sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can
also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung
infections (pneumonia), fits, brain damage and even death.
Hepatitis B: caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). In
some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious
liver problems, including liver cancer.
Poliomyelitis (often just called polio): caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to
paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control
breathing and swallowing can be fatal.
Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib infections): serious bacterial
infections causing meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead
to brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflammation
and swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can
affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints.

• 
• 
• 
Important information about the protection provided
•
Vaxelis will only help to prevent these diseases caused by the bacteria and viruses targeted by
40
the vaccine. Vaxelis does not protect your child against diseases caused by other bacteria and
viruses that may cause similar symptoms.
The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the
infectious diseases against which it protects.
As with any vaccine, Vaxelis may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine.
•
•
2.  What you need to know before Vaxelis is given to your child 
To make sure that Vaxelis is suitable for your child, it is important to talk to your doctor or nurse if any
of the points below apply to your child. If there is anything you do not understand, ask your doctor,
pharmacist or nurse to explain.
Do not use Vaxelis if your child:
• 
− 
− 
has had shortness of breath or swelling of the face (anaphylactic reaction) after administration of
a previous dose of Vaxelis.
is allergic (hypersensitive)
− 
to Vaxelis vaccine or any diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B or Hib
containing vaccines,
to any ingredients listed in section 6,
to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B (antibiotics) and
bovine serum albumin, as these substances are used during the manufacturing process.
has suffered from a severe reaction affecting the brain (encephalopathy) within 7 days of a prior
dose of a pertussis vaccine (acellular or whole cell pertussis).
has an uncontrolled condition or severe illness affecting the brain and nervous system
(uncontrolled neurologic disorder) or uncontrolled epilepsy.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination if your child:
• 
has a moderate to severe acute disease, with or without fever (e.g. sore throat, cough, cold or
flu). Vaccination with Vaxelis may need to be delayed until your child is better.
has had any of the following events after receiving a vaccine against pertussis (whooping
cough), as the decision to give further doses of pertussis containing vaccine will need to be
carefully considered:
− 
− 
had a fever of 40.5°C or above within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause.
became floppy, unresponsive or unconscious after the previous vaccination, within 48
hours of vaccination.
cried continuously and could not be comforted for more than 3 hours within 48 hours of
vaccination.
had a fit (convulsions) with or without fever, within 3 days of vaccination.
− 
− 
previously had Guillain-Barré syndrome (temporary loss of feeling and movement) after being
given a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid (an inactivated form of tetanus toxin). Your doctor
will decide whether to give Vaxelis to your child.
is receiving a treatment (such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or has a disease that
suppresses or weakens the body’s ability to fight infections. It is recommended to postpone
vaccination until the end of such treatment or disease. However, children with long standing
problems with their immune system such as HIV infection (AIDS) may still be given Vaxelis
but the protection may not be as good as in children with a healthy immune system.
suffers from any undiagnosed illness of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled. Your
doctor or nurse will assess the potential benefit offered by vaccination, once the condition is
stabilised.
suffers from fits during a fever, or there is family history of fits occurring during a fever.
has any problems with bleeding for a long time after minor cuts, or bruises easily. Your doctor
will advise you whether your child should receive Vaxelis. 
was born very prematurely (at or before 28 weeks of gestation). In these infants, longer gaps
than normal between breaths may occur for 2 to 3 days after vaccination.

Other medicines or vaccines and Vaxelis
Tell your doctor or nurse if your child is taking or has recently taken or might take any other
medicines or vaccines.
Vaxelis can be given at the same time as other vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccines, measles-
mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, or meningococcal B or C vaccines.
Your doctor or nurse will give these injections at different sites and will use different syringes and
needles for each injection.
Driving and using machines
It is expected that Vaxelis will have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use
machines.
Vaxelis contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
3.  How Vaxelis is given
Vaxelis will be given to your child by a doctor or nurse trained in the use of vaccines and who are
equipped to deal with any uncommon severe allergic reaction to the injection (see section 4 Possible
side effects).
Your doctor or nurse will inject Vaxelis into your child’s thigh (in infants from the age of 6 weeks) or
arm (in children older than one year).
The recommended dose is as follows:
First course of vaccination (primary vaccination)
Your child will receive two or three injections given at least one month apart. Your doctor or nurse will
tell you when your child should come back for their next injection as per the local vaccination
program.
Additional injection (booster)
After the first course of injections, your child will receive a booster dose, in accordance with local
recommendations, at least 6 months after the last dose of the first course. Your doctor will tell you
when this dose should be given.
If your child misses a dose of Vaxelis
If your child misses a scheduled injection, it is important that you discuss with your doctor or nurse
who will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important to follow the instructions from the doctor or nurse so that your child completes the
course of injections. If not, your child may not be fully protected against the diseases.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

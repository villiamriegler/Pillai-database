2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
MS is an inflammatory condition that damages the myelin of the Central Nervous System and causes 
neurologic  impairment  and,  frequently,  severe  disability.  It  is  a  common  neurological  disease  with 
prevalence  rate  ranging  from  more  than  100  per  100,000  in  Northern  and  Central  Europe  to  50  per 
100,000 in Southern Europe. The aetiology of MS remains unknown. It is generally assumed that MS is 
mediated  by  some  kind  of  autoimmune  process  triggered  by  an  infection  and  superimposed  upon  a 
genetic predisposition. 
Most  patients  present  with  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS),  characterised  by 
unpredictable acute episodes of neurological dysfunction or relapse, followed by variable recovery and 
periods  of  clinical  stability.  Within  ten  years  more  than  50%  of  patients  who  presented  with  a 
relapsing-remitting  (RR)  form  eventually  develop  sustained  deterioration  with  or  without  relapses 
superimposed, i.e. secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Around 15% of patients develop a 
sustained deterioration of their neurological function from the beginning, i.e. have primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis (PPMS). About 5% of the patients have a steady progression of clinical neurological 
damage with superimposed relapses, i.e. progressive relapsing multiple scleroses (PRMS).  
In general, relapses are considered the clinical expression of acute inflammatory focal lesions whereas 
progression is considered to reflect the occurrence of demyelization, axonal loss and gliosis.  
Current  therapeutic  approaches  in  multiple  sclerosis  include:  symptomatic  treatment  (i.e.  mainly 
treatment  of  complications),  treatment  modifying  the  outcome  of  acute  relapses  (corticosteroids), 
treatments  aimed  to  modify  the  course  of  the  disease  (immunomodulators  e.g.  beta-interferons, 
glatiramer,  nataluzimab  and  immunosuppressants,  e.g.    mitoxantrone,  azathioprine).  Potential  future 
therapies focus on pursuing neuroprotection or restoration of neurological function (e.g. promotors of 
remyelinisation). 
The  indication  claimed  for  fampridine  was  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  for  the 
improvement of walking ability.  
Fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is a selective potassium channel blocker. It is a lipid-soluble drug which 
readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Fampridine is formulated as a prolonged-release tablet and the 
recommended dose was one 10mg tablet twice daily, taken 12 hours apart. A prolonged-release tablet 
has been developed to reduce peak plasma concentrations associated adverse events.  
By  blocking  potassium  reflux  the  hyperpolarisation  phase  of  an  action  potential  is  reduced. 
Consequently  the  relative  refractory  period  of  the  action  potential  is  shortened,  allowing  the  action 
potential to propagate along the cell membrane.  This, according to the applicant, especially applies for 
unmyelinated  axons  where  the  action  potential  dampens  quickly  below  a  depolarisation  threshold  too 
low for activating the adjacent membrane.   
The  K+  channels  are  located  primarily  in  the  paranodal  and  internodal  membrane  of  the  axon  where 
they  are  not  significantly  activated  by  the  passage  of  an  action  potential  because  the  myelin  sheath 
acts  as  an  electrical  shield.  In  demyelinated  axons  the  internodal  membrane  and  its  ion  channels 
become  exposed  to  larger  electrical  transients  during  the  action  potential.  Under  these  conditions, 
leakage  of  ion  current  through  the  K+  channel  can  contribute  to  action  potential  conduction  block. 
Fampridine  at  low  concentration  may  prolong  nerve  action  potentials  by  blocking  these  exposed 
channels and inhibiting repolarisation, subsequently improving axon potential propagation.  
Considering the mechanism of action of fampridine, there is a plausible biological rationale to evaluate 
the usefulness of fampridine in symptomatic treatment in multiple sclerosis.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  concerns  a  10  mg  prolonged  release  film  coated  tablet  containing  fampridine  as 
active substance. It is packaged in HDPE bottles containing a desiccant and polyester coil. 
The active substance fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is a potassium channel blocker. The maximum daily 
dosage is 20 mg.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance  
Information  on  the  active  substance  4-aminopyridine  is  presented  in  form  of  an  Active  Substance 
Master File (ASMF) dated December 2009 and submitted by the manufacturer.  
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  pyridine-4-amine.  The  molecular  formula  of  active 
substance is C5H6N2, its relative molecular mass 94.12 and its structural formula is shown below. 
Fampridine is a white to off-white non hygroscopic powder, practically soluble in water. No evidence of 
polymorphism has been found. Fampridine has no stereochemical centers. Its pKa is 9.17 (protonated 
free base) and its logP is 0.76 and the pH of its solution (50 mg/mL in water) is 11. 
Manufacture 
Sufficient  information  on  each  step  of  the  synthesis  of  the  active  substance,  including  reagents  and 
solvents  has  been  provided.  The  specifications  of  the  intermediates  are  acceptable.  No  critical  steps 
have been determined. 
Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR,  Ph.Eur., 
HPLC),  water  content  (Ph.Eur.),  residue  on  ignition  (Ph.Eur.),  heavy  metals  (Ph.Eur.),  particle  size 
(laser diffraction), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC) and residual solvents (GC). 
Sufficient  batch  analysis  data  have  been  presented  for  three  pilot  scale  batches,  the  three  validation 
batches  and  18  earlier  commercial  scale  batches.  All  results  complied  with  the  specification.  Earlier 
batches  comply  with  the  specifications  that  were  active  at  the  time  of  release.  The  data  generated 
demonstrate consistency in manufacturing. The purity of the drug substance has been improved over 
the years. 
Stability 
The  primary  stability  study  has  been  performed  on  the  three  commercial  scale  validation  batches 
stored  at  long  term  (25°C/60%  RH)  for  60  months  and  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75%  RH)  for  6 
months.  
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 7/89
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, batch results of four commercial batches used in the annual stability study tested at long 
term (25°C/60% RH) up to 48 months for all four batches and accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) 
for 6 months for one of the commercial batches have been presented. 
Both  the  validation  batches  and  the  annual  stability  batches  met  the  specification  at  all  storage 
conditions and testing intervals and no trends were observed over time.   
Forced  degradation  studies  were  performed  under  photo,  thermal,  acidic,  basic  and  oxidative 
conditions. No degradation was observed after exposure to photo, thermal, acidic or basic conditions. 
Degradation was observed after exposure to oxidative conditions. The results also indicate that the in 
house HPLC method for related substance determination is stability indicating. 
The light sensitivity has been tested within the forced degradation studies. Under conditions which are 
in  line  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Active  Substances  and  Medicinal 
Products  no  degradation  has  been  observed.  It  can  be  concluded  that  fampridine  is  not  sensitive  to 
light.  
The  stability  data  support  the  proposed  re-test  period  for  fampridine  when  packaged  in  the  original 
container. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines * ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  drug  product  corresponds  to  a  prolonged  release  (PR)  tablet  dosage  form.  A  controlled  release 
dosage  form  was  favoured  in  order  to  minimise  potential  plasma  peak  related  adverse  events.  Drug 
release is controlled by a hydrophilic matrix-forming polymer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), 
which is incorporated into the tablets. When in contact with the contents of the gastrointestinal tract, 
the polymer absorbs liquid and swells forming a viscous gel. The controlled release of 4-aminopyridine 
occurs by diffusion out through the viscous mass and/or by erosion of the polymer as it is exposed to 
the gastrointestinal fluids.  
Various immediate and prolonged release capsule formulations have been tested during development. 
The  PR  matrix  tablet  formulations  offered  a  more  favourable  stability  profile  while  demonstrating 
comparable pharmacokinetic properties relative to the PR capsule formulation used in the clinical trials.  
The  final  formulation  of  the  film-coated  tablet  was  studied  in  all  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  clinical  trials. 
Various  tablet  dosage  strengths  of  the  final  formulation  were  evaluated  during  clinical  development. 
However, only the 10 mg strength is proposed for commercialisation. The qualitative and quantitative 
composition  of  the  10  mg  strength  used  in  pivotal  clinical  trials  is  the  same  as  those  proposed  for 
commercial production.. 
The selected tablet formulation went through further steps of optimization. 
The  drug  substance  is  highly  soluble  and  permeable.  Particle  size  distribution  is  not  relevant  for 
dissolution and is not considered critical regarding in vivo properties. 
Studies  on  polymorphism  were  performed.  The  results  of  the  polymorphism  studies  show,  that  only 
one crystal form exists.. 
Compatibility  studies  between  4-aminopyridine  and  the  excipients  were  performed  and  presented.  All 
excipients, with the exception of the Opadry, are compendial. The components of Opadry Y-1-7000 are 
compendial excipients that meet the respective Ph.Eur. monograph requirements.

Development  of  the  in  vitro  release  method  was  adequately  described.  Tablets  produced  at  either 
manufacturing  site  have  similar  dissolution  profiles  in  the  pH  range  1.2  to  7.2.  Moreover, 
bioequivalence was confirmed in a clinical study. 
The potential for dose dumping due to an interruption of the modified release mechanism with alcohol 
has been investigated. There was no evidence of dose dumping at any time point, under the conditions 
studied. It is therefore concluded that the drug product is compatible with alcohol. 
The development of the manufacturing process has been described. The critical formulation attributes 
were  defined  and  the  critical  processing  parameters  at  the  different  stages  of  manufacture  were 
studied. 
Process scale up was performed and included the evaluation of a number of manufacturing parameters 
and the optimal settings/ ranges have been established and process robustness was demonstrated. 
Additionally, the transfer of the drug product manufacturing process to a second commercial 
manufacturer has been evaluated. The data show that the manufacturing process was robust for the 
manufacture of fampridine prolonged release tablets. All tests met the acceptance criteria and quality 
attributes of the tablet strengths tested. 
Adventitious agents 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of fampridine tablets. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of fampridine 10 mg prolonged release film coated tablets, consists mainly 
of  three  steps  at  both  proposed  manufacturing  sites:  blending,  tabletting,  coating  and  packaging. 
Holding  times  have  been  established.  The  process  steps  used  are  well  established  standard 
pharmaceutical  methods.  No  critical  steps  were  identified  during  development  that  need  to  be 
considered for routine manufacture. 
There are minor differences in the process approach for each of these steps between the two sites, but 
these have been demonstrated to have no impact on product performance. 
Process validation has been performed on three production scale batches at both proposed 
manufacturing sites. A summary of the validation results are provided. The results demonstrate 
consistency within and between the batches. From the results obtained it can be concluded that 
Fampridine prolonged release tablets, 10 mg manufactured at both manufacturing sites consistently 
meet all routine analytical test specifications and validation acceptance criteria. 
Product Specification  
The  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  of  the  drug  product  include  tests  and  limits  for  appearance 
(visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV  -  at  release  only),  assay  (HPLC,  UV),  related  impurities  (HPLC), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph  Eur  -  at  release  only),  dissolution  (Ph  Eur),  and  moisture  (KF)  and 
microbial test (Ph.Eur). 
Batch  analysis  data  were  provided  for  four  production  scale  validation  batches  manufactured  at  one 
manufacturer  and  three  production  scale  validation  batches  manufactured  at  the  other.  The  batch 
analyses data are acceptable. All results are within the proposed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  on  the  drug  product  were  carried  out  on  four  batches  up  to  36  months  at  25°C  ± 
2°C/60%RH ± 5%RH, 30°C ± 2°C/65%RH ± 5%RH, and 40°C ± 2°C / 75%RH ± 5%RH according to 
ICH  guideline.  All  batches  for  which  stability  data  are  submitted  were  manufactured  according  to  the 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011

intended  commercial  process  and  comparable  equipment.  The  results  presented  show  that  all 
parameters  are  well  within  the  proposed  shelf-life  specification  for  all  conditions  investigated.  The 
observed  slightly  increase  of  two  impurities  has  been  adequately  considered  in  the  drug  product 
specification. No other significant tendencies are observed. 
A  photostability  test  was  performed  according  to  ICH.  Results  indicated  that  special  precautions  for 
light  protection  of  the  marketed  drug  product  are  not  required  for  drug  product  in  the  proposed 
commercial package. 
An in-use stability study was conducted on two batches. The conditions were mimicking patient use. All 
results  were  within  specification  and  no  significant  trends  observed  except  for  moisture  content.  The 
provided data show that the proposed in-use period can be granted. 
Shipping stability performance of bulk tablets was investigated with three lots. The results demonstrate 
the continued stability performance following product having been shipped in bulk. 
Based on the available stability data the proposed shelf-life and the storage condition can be accepted. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines † ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion  and  conclusion  on  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and 
biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Fampyra  10  mg  prolonged-release  film  coated  tablets  is  considered  to  be  acceptable. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance has been presented in a 
satisfactory  manner.  The  quality  of  the  active  substance  is  considered  sufficiently  described  and 
adequately  supported  by  data.  Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to 
development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  product  has  been  presented.  The  results  of  tests 
carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance  in  the  clinic.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is 
chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Compliance with GLP  
Of  the  four  safety  pharmacology  studies  performed  with  fampridine,  three  studies  investigating 
cardiovascular  safety  were  compliant  with  GLP.  The  pharmacokinetic  studies,  which  were  conducted 
over  a  course  of  several  decades,  were  not  generally  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP  standards; 
however,  they  were  considered  adequate  by  design  and  their  findings  were  supported  by  literature 
publications.  During  fampridine  development,  studies  analysing  toxicities  after  single-  and  repeated- 
dose  administration,  reproduction  toxicity,  genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  were  conducted.  These 
studies  formally  adhered  to  GLP  standards;  however,  the  pivotal  repeated-dose  toxicity  study, 
reproduction  toxicity  study  and  carcinogenicity  study  lacked  concomitant  toxicokinetic  evaluations  of 
fampridine  or  its  metabolites.  This  deficiency  was  later  compensated  for  by  conducting  toxicokinetic 
bridging studies compliant with GLP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Aminopyridines are well known for their reversible inhibition of potassium channels and fampridine has 
been  extensively  used  as  an  experimental  tool  to  block  specific  potassium  channels  in  vitro  or  to 
induce  seizures  in  laboratory  animals.  Therefore,  the  applicant  mainly  referred  to  pertinent  literature 
regarding the primary pharmacodynamic properties of fampridine.  
The existing information was complemented with an in vitro study on cloned Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 
channels expressed in HEK 293 cells at concentrations of 50, 500, 5 000 and 50 000 µM, testing the 
activity of fampridine and also its two primary metabolites (3-OH-4-AP and 3-OH-4-AP-sulphate). The 
study  results  suggested  that  the  potassium  channel  subtypes  Kv1.1,  Kv1.2  and  Kv1.4  might  mediate 
the  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  fampridine,  because  their  distribution  coincides  with  changes  in 
fampridine sensitivity of demyelinated fibres. The two primary metabolites showed about 30-fold lower 
inhibitory effect on the specific potassium channel subtypes and thus, they did not appear to contribute 
to the pharmacological activity of fampridine. 
Improvements  of  neurological  functions  or  effective  dose  ranges  were  not  evaluated  in  an  animal 
model  in  in  vivo  studies.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  widely  used  animal  models  of  experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis mimic only particular aspects of MS and are hence of limited predictive 
value  to  determine  the  clinical  efficacy  of  a  compound.  Thus,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  challenges  of 
generating  relevant  non-clinical  in  vivo  data  and  concluded  that  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of 
fampridine would need to be sufficiently substantiated by clinical evidence. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant did not perform any secondary pharmacodynamic studies. Based on a detailed review of 
Bowman  and  Savage  1981,  the  applicant  described  that  the  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  of 
fampridine  are  thought  to  depend  on  an  increased  synaptic  transmission  and  neuromuscular  tension, 
without summarizing the potential secondary pharmacodynamic actions of fampridine. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
Adverse  reactions  that  were  elicited  by  fampridine  in  toxicological  investigations  as  well  as  in  MS 
patients mainly involved excitatory effects on the CNS like paraesthesia, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, 
confusion  and  seizures.  The  existing  knowledge  of  the  CNS  effects  of  fampridine  was  complemented 
with  an  in  vivo  study  analysing  EEG  changes  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats.  The  safety  pharmacological 
effects  of  fampridine  were  investigated  at  i.v.  doses  of  0.5,  1,  2  and  4  mg/kg  compared  to  saline. 
Blood samples were harvested at different time-points and EEG activity was recorded at baseline and 
post-injection  every  13  minutes  for  3  hours.  Administration  of  fampridine  significantly  changed  EEG 
activity with a threshold concentration of 109-135 ng/mL, which was in accordance with an increased 
risk of seizures reported in humans at fampridine plasma concentrations above 100 ng/mL.  
The  effects  of  fampridine  on  the  cardiovascular  system,  in  particular  the  arrhythmic  risk,  were 
evaluated  in  in  vitro  studies  in  HERG-expressing  HEK293  cells  and  dog  Purkinje  fibres  and  in  in  vivo 
study in Beagle dogs. Both in vitro studies were indicative of a potential of fampridine to extend the QT 
interval, although only at concentrations exceeding levels clinically relevant (at least 2000x higher). No 
effects  on  the  ECG  were  apparent  in  dogs  in  vivo  when  fampridine  was  analysed  at  concentrations 
more  than  50x  higher  than  the  max  determined  in  healthy  subjects.  Hence,  based  on  the 
cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology  studies,  occurrence  of  QT  prolongation  following  treatment  with 
fampridine was considered not very likely. This lack of sizable arrhythmic risk at therapeutic levels was

in  agreement  with  absence  of  arrhythmic  effects  of  fampridine  in  toxicity  studies  in  dogs.    However, 
the results of a QT clinical study in humans were inconclusive as the confusing results questioned the 
reliability of this study (described in greater detail in the Clinical part of the assessment report).

The  results  of  the  safety  pharmacological  studies  demonstrated  that  fampridine  had  an  acceptable 
pharmacological safety profile in animals. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not perform any drug-drug interaction studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Fampridine  concentrations  were  determined  in  tissue,  plasma  and  microsomes  by  a  validated  High 
Performance  Liquid  Chromatography  (HPLC)  method,  while  14C-labelled  fampridine  was  measured  in 
samples  of  blood,  tissues  or  urine  by liquid  scintillation  counting  (LSC).  Corresponding  metabolites of 
radioactively 
labelled 
fampridine 
(3-OH-4-AP,  4-AP-N-oxide,  1-methyl-4-pyridone,  4-amino-
2-pyridone)  were  also  identified  by  LSC  or  HPLC  in  urine  following  separation  by  thin  layer 
chromatography.  Analyses  of  dose  formulations  and  toxicokinetic  parameters  were  performed  using 
validated  HPLC  with  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  to  detect  4-AP,  3-OH-4-AP  and  3-OH-
4-AP-sulphate. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of a single dose of fampridine at doses of no more than 2 mg/kg, the PK 
parameters of fampridine were similar across  the non-clinical species tested (rat and dog), and were 
generally  also  similar  to  those  observed  in  humans.  Fampridine  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  peak 
systemic exposure occurring within 1.5 hours.  
Oral  bioavailability  of  fampridine  was  only  measured  in  rats  and  appeared  to  be  moderate  in  both 
females (55%) and males (67%). Approximately 36% of the parent drug was removed by hepatic first-
pass  metabolism.  Fampridine  was  neither  a  substrate  for  P-gp  in vitro,  nor  did  it  inhibit  the  P-gp 
transport  of  other  compounds.  In  humans,  the  bioavailability  was  higher,  95%,  which  was  consistent 
with the fact that fampridine is not a P-gp substrate.  
Fampridine  peak  (C max)  and  total  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  CD-1 
mice,  Sprague-Dawley  rats,  New  Zealand  White  rabbits  and  Beagle  dogs.  However,  in  all  species 
tested  the  increase  was  less  than  dose  proportional.  Similar  results  were  observed  after  single-  and 
repeated doses. 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011

Sex  differences  were  not  observed  in  rats  and  dogs.  However,  in  mice  both  peak  concentrations  and 
exposure were higher in males than in females.  
No  accumulation  of  fampridine,  as  demonstrated  by  the  lack  of  increase  in  peak  and  total  systemic 
exposure  values  (<2-fold),  was  observed  following  repeated  dose  administration  of  fampridine  at 
multiple  doses  for  multiple  days  in  CD-1  mice,  Sprague-Dawley  rats,  New  Zealand  White  rabbits, 
Beagle  dogs  and  humans.  Thus,  accumulation  in  plasma  after  repeated  administration  was  not 
anticipated. 
The  effect  of  food  was  only  examined  in  dogs. Although  the  observed  effect  was  small,  the  Cmax  and 
AUC values were lower in fed versus fasted dogs. 
Toxicokinetic  data  showed  that  systemic  exposure  to  fampridine  increased  less  than  dose 
proportionally in mice (2-80 mg/kg/day) and rats (1-18 mg/kg/day), while it was dose proportional in 
pregnant  rabbits  (1-5  mg/kg/day)  and  in  dogs  (0.75-3.0  mg/kg/day).  This  interspecies  difference 
could  be  explained  by  the  dose  range,  which  was  higher  in  mice  and  rats  compared  to  rabbits  and 
dogs.  
Distribution 
The  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  was  high  in  rats  (3.4  L/kg  in  male,  3.3  L/kg  in  female), 
which suggested extensive tissue distribution. One hour post-dose, highest concentrations were found 
in  bladder,  kidneys  and  liver.  Fampridine  related  material  crossed  the  blood-brain  barrier,  since 
radioactivity was observed in the cerebellum and cerebrum until 8 hours post-dose. 
Binding of fampridine to plasma proteins was low with a high free fraction of >75% in rats and dogs 
and >90% in humans. Protein binding was dependent on the concentration, especially in rat and dog 
plasma (17% increase of the free drug at 500 ng/mL compared to 5 ng/mL).  
The distribution of fampridine across the placenta and into milk is not known as such studies were not 
identified in the literature nor were any conducted by the applicant.  
Metabolism 
The  specific  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  fampridine  were  not  identified  in  laboratory 
animals, but based on human microsome studies; it was suggested that CYP2E1 could be responsible 
for hydroxylation in man. 
In  rat,  approximately  36%  of  the  parent  drug  was  removed  by  hepatic  first-pass  metabolism. 
Fampridine  was  metabolized  primarily  by  hydroxylation,  followed  by  sulfate  conjugation.  Two 
circulating  metabolites  were  detected  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human  plasma:  3-hydroxy-4-AP 
and 3-hydroxy-4-AP sulfate. Although these metabolites were identified in all species, more extensive 
metabolism  was  determined  in  rats  and  dogs  than  in  humans.  In  mouse  and  rat  plasma,  it  was 
demonstrated that 4-AP-N-oxide was also a circulating metabolite. In human plasma, two unidentified 
metabolites were present; however, these metabolites accounted for <2% of the radioactivity.  
Fampridine  mediated  CYP-dependent  drug-drug  interactions  taking  place  through  inhibition  or 
induction of CYP activity in humans appeared to be unlikely. Of three drugs commonly used by patients 
with  multiple  sclerosis  (amitriptyline,  baclofen  and  caffeine),  only  baclofen  showed  a  significant 
interaction with fampridine in rats. This attenuated elimination of fampridine seen in baclofen-treated 
rats seemed to be irrelevant for human therapy, since it could not be substantiated by clinical data. 
Excretion 
In rats and dogs, as compared with humans, the clearance rate was higher and the elimination half-life 
(t1/2)  was  shorter;  otherwise,  the  basic  PK  parameters  of  fampridine  were  similar  between  species. 
Elimination of fampridine was in a similar range between rats and dogs with a plasma half-life of 1-2 h, 
but was slightly prolonged in humans. The predominant route of elimination of radioactivity in rat and

dog  following  oral  administration  was  via  urine  with  a  negligible  contribution  eliminated  in  faeces 
(<2%). 
Between  75  to  92%  of  the  dose  was  detected  in  urine  within  the  first  12 hours  in  rats  and  dogs, 
approximately 40% of which accounted for unchanged parent compound. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In a single dose toxicity study in rats, approximate median lethal oral doses (LD50) ranged between 14 
(males)  and  22  (females)  mg/kg,  but  raised  to  40  mg/kg  (both  sexes)  when  the  once  daily  drug 
administration  was  instead  separated  into  4  sub-doses  given  every  6  hours.  In  rabbits,  the  median 
lethal dose was 23 mg/kg (both sexes). In dogs, no toxicities were evident at total daily doses of up to 
5 mg/kg four times a day. In general, death occurred short after administration (on the day of dosing). 
It  was  noted  that  findings  of  the  single  dose  toxicity  studies  coincided  with  the  short  half-life  of 
fampridine  and  suggested  that  toxicity  is  related  to  peak  plasma  levels  rather  than  overall  exposure. 
Most  notable  treatment  related  acute  clinical  observations  were  CNS  effects  and  included  excessive 
salivation,  tremor,  seizures,  convulsions,  ataxia,  dyspnoea,  dilated  pupils,  prostration,  abnormal 
vocalisation,  increased  respiration,  excess  salivation,  gait  abnormalities  and  hyper-  and  hypo-
excitability. These findings were in line with those described in overdose reports in humans, including 
confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, amnesia and rare cases of hallucinations.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
A  full  package  of  GLP-compliant  toxicological  studies  has  been  submitted.  Studies  have  been 
performed  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs,  and  fampridine  was  dosed  via  the  oral  route  (gavage, 
dietary, capsules).  
In mice, the signs of toxicity included effects on body weight and food consumption. The main species 
in repeated dose studies were rats (studies of duration up to 26 weeks) and dogs (studies of duration 
up  to  one  year).  In  both  species,  the  findings  revealed  CNS  associated  events  that  included  tremor, 
trembling,  convulsions,  ataxia,  decreased  activity,  prostration,  ptyalism,  dilated  pupils,  increased 
respiratory rate and laboured breathing. A clear cause of death could not be identified for most animals 
that died during the studies; however, CNS toxicity and multiple organ failure were regarded as most 
likely  reasons.  In  both  species,  decrease  in  body  weight  was  seen;  in  rat  also  a  decrease  in  food 
consumption and effects  on the locomotor system  were observed, such as impaired righting reflex or 
uncoordinated  aerial  righting,  splay  of  (hind)  limbs  and  hind  limb  grip  strength.  In  addition,  some 
effects  on  the  behaviour  were  noted  in  rats,  such  as  increased  activity,  arousal,  and  aggressive 
behaviour especially in the long studies. In dogs, a behavioural change (anxiety) was noted in the one-
year oral toxicity study. This effect may correlate to clinical finding of anxiety which was reported as a 
common adverse reaction. The observed effects, especially on food consumption and body weight were 
more  pronounced  in  males  than  females.  In  rats  urogenital  tract  was  identified  as  a  target  for 
fampridine toxicity. Urinary tract obstruction caused death of two males at the dose of 9 mg/kg/day in 
a  13-week  oral  toxicity  study.  Bladder  distension  and  slight  bilateral  dilation  of  the  renal  pelvis  was 
observed  in  a  male  at  the  dose  15  mg/kg/day  in  a  28-day  oral  gavage  study.  Some  small  effects  in 
clinical  pathology  endpoints  (haematology,  serum  chemistry)  were  recorded  in  both  species  in  some 
studies.  However,  being  of  mild  nature  and  not  seen  in  all  studies,  they  were  considered  of  limited 
toxicological  and  clinical  relevance.  No  effects  were  noted  in  ophthalmology  and  urinalysis  in  either 
species. ECG was recorded in most of the dog studies, no changes were observed.

The  no  observed  effect  level  (NOAEL)  from  repeated  dietary  dosing  in  mice  (13  weeks)  was  12 
mg/kg/day. In the pivotal 26-week study in rats (dietary administration) the NOEL for fampridine was 
<2  mg/kg/day.  At  the  NOAEL  of  0.75 mg/kg  in  the  pivotal  1 year  chronic  toxicity  study  in  dogs, 
corresponding C max and AUC 0-24 h exposure ratios compared to maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD) were around 3.4 and 1.1 each (see the Table 2 below).

Despite  availability  of  further  exposure  levels  from  toxicokinetic  bridging  studies  in  mice  and  rats, 
safety factors on basis of Cmax were not submitted for these species. Nevertheless, as C max values from 
these bridging studies at the respective NOAEL were related to the maximum plasma concentration in 
MS patients, exposure ratios of ~2.4 (74.1/31.3) for male and ~1.6 (51.3/31.3) for female mice and 
of  ~1.5  (47.1/31.3)  for  male  rats  could  be  deduced.  These  levels  were  comparable  to  exposures 
calculated on the basis of AUC. Overall, it was concluded that safety factors derived from non-clinical 
toxicity  investigations  were  rather  low  or  even  not  existent,  which  was  taken  into  consideration  in 
terms of clinical safety. 
Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  fampridine  was  tested  in  standard  in  vitro  (AMES  test,  mouse  lymphoma 
assay) and cytogenetic in vivo tests in mouse and rat. All tests were performed in compliance with GLP 
and fampridine was not shown to have a relevant genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
Fampridine  was  tested  in  two  long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  over  two  years  in  mice  and  rats  as 
summarized in the table 3 below:

Comparing  control  and  treatment  groups,  no  significant  differences  in  clinical  parameters  were 
observed  in  either  of  the  studies.  Differences  in  neoplastic  changes  between  treatment  and  control 
groups were  only observed in female rats in a slight increase in benign uterine polyps. In addition, a 
dose-dependent  increase  in  ulceration  of  the  foot  was  observed  in  rat.  These  observations  were 
considered  not  to  be  of  clinical  relevance.  There  was  no  other  evidence  for  a  treatment-related 
increase in neoplastic changes in mice or in rats. 
No medium- and short-term studies were performed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies  investigating  the  effects  of  fampridine  on  male  and  female  fertility  in  rats,  embryo-foetal 
development in rats and rabbits and pre- and post-natal development in rats were performed.

Other toxicity studies 
Intrathecal administration 
A  seven-day  intrathecal  infusion  study  in  Beagle  dogs  was  performed  to  further  investigate  the 
potential  CNS  activity  of  fampridine  when  delivered  directly  to  the  spinal  fluid.  Signs  of  toxicity  were 
similar to those reported in oral toxicity studies, but at considerably lower cumulative doses. 
Studies on impurities 
The  stability  studies  revealed  that  fampridine  may  react  with  either  Methocel  or  Avicel  in  the  tablet 
formulation  leading  to  the  formation  of  an  identified  impurity  called  methylene  bridge.  In  order  to 
qualify this impurity up to a content of 2%, the applicant performed two genotoxicity tests (Ames test 
and a chromosomal aberration assay) and a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in rat with fampridine 
spiked with 2% methylene bridge. There was no indication that the methylene bridge had a genotoxic 
potential. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  submitted  an  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  according  to  the  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/4447/00.  The  Fpen  calculation  in  the  ERA  was  technically  correct.  The  Fpen  refinement 
was  supported  with  published  epidemiological  data,  and  was  considered  acceptable.  The  Phase  I 
PEC SURFACEWATER for a country exhibiting the highest prevalence of multiple sclerosis in the EU amounted 
to  6.2  ng/  L,  i.e  was  below  the  threshold  of  0.01µg/L.  Fampridine  is  neither  PBT  (persistent, 
bioaccumulative  and  toxic)  (log  Kow  does  not  exceed  4.5),  nor  vPvB  (very  persistent,  very 
bioaccumulative).  Therefore,  a  phase  II  assessment  did  not  need  to  be  performed.  The  risk  of 
fampridine to the environment was assumed to be negligible.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Results  of  the  safety  pharmacological  studies  demonstrated  that  fampridine  had  an  acceptable 
pharmacological  safety  profile  in  animals.  However,  it  was  noted  that  no  studies  evaluating 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions were performed by the applicant and the CHMP pointed out that, 
given the mechanism of action of fampridine, the risk of these interactions with anti-epileptic and anti-
arrhythmic agents cannot be excluded. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of fampridine was evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo (in rats and dogs). 
The  toxicokinetic  parameters  have  been  determined  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits  and  dogs.  The  primary 
routes  of  administration  in  rat  and  dog  were  intravenous  and  oral.  Overall,  the  ADME  (absorption, 
distribution,  metabolism,  excretion)  properties  of  fampridine  were  similar  across  species  examined 
including humans. 
The  toxicological  study  programme  of  fampridine  comprised  oral  single-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats, 
rabbits and dogs, repeat-dose toxicity studies up to three months in mice, six months in rats and 12 
months in dogs, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats and 
mice  and  a  battery  of  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits.  These 
studies were performed in compliance with GLP standards, with the exception of the lack of thorough 
toxicokinetic  evaluation  of  fampridine  and  its  metabolites  within  pivotal  toxicology,  reproductive 
toxicology  and  carcinogenicity  studies.  The  toxicokinetic  parameters  were  therefore  obtained  in 
bridging studies that mimicked the design of the toxicity studies.  
In the repeated dose studies in rat and dog, the safety findings consistently revealed CNS associated 
events  including  tremor,  trembling,  convulsions,  ataxia,  decreased  activity,  prostration,  ptyalism, 
dilated  pupils,  increased  respiratory  rate  and  laboured  breathing.  Gait  abnormalities  and  hyper-

excitability  were  also  observed.  These  signs  were attributed  to  the  pharmacology  of fampridine;  they 
were  rapid  in  onset  and  seemed  to  alleviate  during continued  dosing  and  also  to  reverse  in  surviving 
animals after discontinuation of treatment. Of note, the urogenital tract was identified as a target for 
fampridine toxicity in toxicity studies in rats leading to cause of death in certain instances. The clinical 
relevance of the findings of urinary tract obstruction or bladder distention remained unclear. However, 
taking  into  account  the  almost  exclusive  renal  elimination  of  fampridine,  the  general  susceptibility  of 
MS patients towards bladder disorders and the potential pharmacological activities of 4-AP on urinary 
tract  smooth  muscles  and/or  bladder  innervation,  the  CHMP  noted  that  this  issue  is  not  addressed 
sufficiently. 
In  a  battery  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies  fampridine  did  not  show  any  potential  to  be  mutagenic, 
clastogenic or carcinogenic.  
In the reproductive toxicity studies no adverse reproductive effects were noted in the segment I (rat) 
study (IRDC 684-001). Despite this observation, according to published in vitro data, fampridine might 
inhibit steroid hormone production, which could contribute to dysmenorrhoea and infertility. The CHMP 
noted that steroid hormone profiles were not evaluated pre-clinically or clinically. 
In  the  embryo-foetal  development  studies  (rat  and  rabbit)  malformations  were  not  seen.  Effects  on 
embryo-foetal  development  (reduced  body  weight)  were  seen  at  or  above  maternally  toxic  doses.  In 
the  rabbit  study  a  possible  small  treatment-related  increase  in  resorption,  pre/post  implantation  loss 
was seen, which could indicate that success of pregnancy outcome is reduced. The toxic effects seen in 
F0  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies.  In  the  peri-post  natal  study 
(rat),  effects  on  F0  and  F1  were  similar  to  those  seen  in  the  embryo-foetal  development  studies. 
Reduced body weight gain was seen in F1 of the high dose group during and beyond lactation, and in 
F1 females during their pregnancy.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP did not raise any objections precluding granting of the marketing authorisation based on the 
provided  non-clinical  data;  however,  the  issues  of  potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions,  urinary 
tract findings and impact of fampridine on steroid hormone production were not addressed sufficiently 
in the dossier. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Fampridine 
is  a  selective  potassium  channel  blocker.  By  blocking  potassium  reflux 
the 
hyperpolarisation phase of an action potential is reduced. Consequently, the relative refractory period 
of  the  action  potential  is  shortened,  allowing  the  action  potential  to  propagate  along  the  cell 
membrane. This, according to the applicant, especially applies to unmyelinated axons where the action 
potential  dampens  quickly  below  a  depolarisation  threshold  too  low  for  activating  the  adjacent 
membrane.   
The  indication  applied  for  was  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  for  the 
improvement of walking ability.  
The  applicant  developed  a  prolonged-release  tablet  formulation  (10mg  tablets)  to  reduce  the  peak 
plasma  concentration  associated  adverse  events.  The  recommended  dosing  regimen  was  one  10mg 
tablet twice daily, taken 12 hours apart.

The  applicant  stated  that  all  trials  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  principles  of  Good 
Clinical Practice, according to the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline. No triggers for the need of an 
inspection were found in the dossier. 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
A tabular overview of the major PK studies is presented in table 5. The PK studies comprised two ADME 
(absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion)  studies,  single-dose  (including  IR  capsule)  and 
multiple-dose  studies,  one  BE  (bioequivalence)  study  (between  two  manufacturers  of  Fampridine  10 
mg  PR  tablet),  two  food-interaction  studies,  study  on  renal  impairment,  and  two  interaction  studies 
with  PR  capsule  and  IR  capsule.  The  influence  of  intrinsic  factors  such  as  gender,  race,  age,  renal 
function,  body  mass  index  and  food  was  evaluated  in  the  Population  PK  analysis  of  the  three  main 
clinical studies.

The major clinical studies are presented in table 6, i.e. study MS-F202 a dose comparison study (10, 
15,  20  mg  BID)  and  the  two  pivotal  studies  MS-F203  and  MS-F204  (10  mg  BID).  In  all  studies  the 
concentration  of  fampridine  was  measured  at  each  visit  in  order  to  evaluate  a  plasma  level-response 
relationship.  Primary  efficacy  was  based  on  the  Timed  25  Foot  Walk  test  (T25FW)  wherein  a  patient 
was asked to walk as quickly as he/she can safely, from one end to the other end of a clearly marked, 
unobstructed,  25-foot  course.  The  time  (seconds)  was  recorded.  After  a  maximum  rest  of  5  minutes 
the  test  was  repeated  again.  The  walking  speed  for  a  particular  study  visit  was  the  average  of  the 
walking speeds of the two trials performed. If one of the 2 trials could not be fulfilled then the walking 
speed for that visit was to be the walking speed from the completed trial.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  marketing  authorisation  was  applied  for  the  10  mg  prolonged-release  tablet.  The  prolonged 
release  tablet  formulation  was  developed  in  order  to  reduce  peak  plasma  concentrations  associated 
with seizures. The proposed dosing was 10 mg twice a day, 12 hours apart. Only one strength of the 
prolonged-release tablet, i.e. 10 mg was developed.  
Absorption   
 
Bioavailability 
When  administered  orally,  fampridine  was  completely  absorbed  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract. 
Absolute  bioavailability  of  fampridine  prolonged-release  tablets  was  not  investigated,  but  relative 
bioavailability (as compared to an aqueous oral solution) was 95%.  
When a single fampridine prolonged release tablet, 10 mg dose was administered to healthy volunteers 
while in a fasted state, peak concentrations ranging from 17 ng/mL to 22 ng/mL occurred 3 to 4 hours 
post-administration  (Tmax).  In  comparison,  Cmax  achieved  with  the  same  10  mg  dose  of  a  fampridine 
oral solution was 43 ng/mL, which occurred approximately 1.3 hours after dose administration. Thus,

from  a  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view,  the  choice  of  retardation  principle  was  considered  justified,  as 
C max is significantly lowered and plasma profile is elongated. 
An  overview  of  the  PK  parameter  values  following  a  single  10  mg  dose  administered  in  the  fasting 
state is given in the table 7 below.

The  clinical  phase  II  and  phase  III  PR  tablet  was  identical  with  the  proposed  commercial  tablet,  with 
the  exception  of  a  stamp  ‘’A10’’  on  one  side;  this  was  for  identification  reasons,  and  should  have  no 
consequences on the bioavailability.  
Due  to  minor  differences  in  the  manufacturing  process  at  the  two  proposed  manufacturing  sites  the 
applicant performed a comparative bioavailability study to demonstrate bioequivalence (Study BE10F-
SR022004). This was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover, bioequivalence study 
of  two  10  mg  Fampridine-SR  Tablets  Manufactured  by  two  different  manufacturers.  A  total  of  18 
healthy subjects were enrolled in the study and 16 subjects completed the study. Blood was collected 
for  up  to  36  hours.  Analysis  of  variance  was  performed  on  the  Ln-transformed  parameters  AUC0-t, 
AUC 0-∞ and C max. The 90% CI for the ratio of the test and reference product were within conventional 
limits  and  the  100%  value  was  always  included.  Thus,  it  was  agreed  that  the  applicant  established 
bioequivalence  under  fasting  conditions  of  10  mg  PR  tablet  manufactured  by  two  potential 
manufacturers of the finished drug product. 
 
Influence of food 
Two food-interaction studies were submitted by the applicant: one with a 25 mg (FeFa25F-SR112003) 
and  one  with  a  10  mg  (FeFa10F-SR-2008)  PR  tablet.  The  tablets  were  administered  under  high-fat 
conditions. In the study with the 25 mg PR tablet, food did not alter AUC, increased Cmax by 15% and 
delayed absorption by 2 hours (Tmax fasted: 3 hours vs. Tmax fed: 5 hours). In the study with the 10 
mg PR tablet (see the figure 1 below), there was no food effect on AUC, but Cmax increased by 23%. 
Peak plasma concentration was reached at 3 hours under fasting conditions and at 5 hours under fed 
conditions. In this context, the CHMP noted that the product should be taken without food.

investigated  in  human,  dog  and  rat  plasma  (HWI  6379-103).  After  a  4-hour  dialysis, when  the  mean 
percent  of  free  drug  did  not  increase  anymore,  the  unbound  fraction  was  between  93-97%  at  all 
concentrations and was independent of pH. The animal data were in line with the human data. Based 
on  the  low  level  of  protein  binding,  there  is  no  expectation  of  interactions  with  highly  protein  bound 
drugs. 
With administration of a single 20 mg intravenous dose, mean Vd was 2.6 L/kg. 
Fampridine  is  a  lipid-soluble  drug  which  crosses  the  blood-brain  barrier.  There  is  no  animal/human 
data on placental transfer or excretion into mother’s milk.  
Elimination  
 
Excretion 
The major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion. It appeared that fampridine undergoes 
active  tubular  secretion  because  the  renal  clearance  (clearance:  370  mL/min)  is  substantially  greater 
than  glomerular  filtration  rate.  Following  intravenous  injection,  renal  clearance  was  estimated  to 
represent  90%  of  total  clearance  (Uges  et  al.,  1982).  A  total  of  90%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  as 
parent  drug  in  the  urine  within  24  hours.  In  Study  0496-002,  following  administration  of  a 
radiolabelled  (14C)  oral  solution,  approximately  94%  of  the  administered  dose  was  excreted  in  the 
urine  within  the  first  24  hours  post-dose,  mostly  as  parent  drug  (parent  drug  accounted  for 
approximately  90%  of  the  excreted  radiolabel  and  the  metabolites  accounted  for  about  10%).  Faecal 
excretion  accounted  for  less  than  1%  of  the  administered  dose.  Administration  of  fampridine 
prolonged-release tablets resulted in a slower time course of absorption and excretion but the available 
ASSESSMENT REPORT

data  indicated  that  the  excretion  in  urine  is  similar,  with  approximately  90%  parent  drug  and 
approximately 10% the hydroxylated and sulphated metabolites. 
The elimination half-life of fampridine following administration of fampridine prolonged release tablets 
was 5.2 to 6.5 hours (observed across studies after both single and repeated doses). The plasma half-
life  of  the  sulfate  conjugate  was  similar,  7.6  hours;  this  parameter  could  not  be  calculated  for  the  3-
hydroxy-4-aminopyridine  metabolite  as  concentrations  for  most  subjects  were  close  to  or  below  the 
limit of quantification. 
 
Metabolism 
Fampridine  was  metabolized  primarily  by  hydroxylation  followed  by  sulfate  conjugation  with 
3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine  and  its  sulfate  conjugate as  the  primary  metabolites,  although  the  extent 
of  metabolism  was  not  extensive  (approximately 10%  of  the  administered  dose).  An in  vitro  reaction 
phenotyping  study  (Study  XT064039)  using  liver  microsomes  indicated  that  the  primary  CYP  enzyme 
responsible for the limited amount of fampridine metabolism was CYP2E1.  
In  the  main  inhibition  study  (XT075077)  investigating  direct  and  time-dependent  inhibition  of  CYPs 
using fampridine at concentrations between 0.03 to 30µM (2.82 – 2820 ng/mL), there was evidence of 
direct  inhibition  of  CYP2E1  by  fampridine  at  30µM  (approximately  12%  inhibition)  which  is 
approximately 100 times the average plasma fampridine concentration measured for the 10 mg tablet. 
Treatment  of  cultured  human  hepatocytes  with  fampridine  showed  little  or  no  effect  on  induction  of 
CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2E1  and  CYP3A4/5  enzyme  activities  in  study  XT073070 
investigating induction of CYP enzymes in human hepatocytes. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
Fampridine  AUC  and  C max  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner  (across  the  dose  range  studied) 
with  terminal  half-life  independent  of  dose  level  (linear  kinetics).  Plasma  exposure  and  peak  plasma 
concentrations  of  fampridine  increased  in  a  dose  proportional  manner  after  a  single  dose  (study 
AN751-101) and at steady state (study TQTc-F-SR001) in MS patients.  
Elimination  half-life  was  independent  of  the  dose  and  did  not  change  with  multiple  dosing,  indicating 
time-independent  pharmacokinetics  of  fampridine.  No  accumulation  of  fampridine  was  observed  after 
repeated dosing. The steady state was achieved within two days.  
Special populations  
The  influence  of  intrinsic  factors  such  as  renal  function,  age,  gender,  weight  was  evaluated  in  the 
Population PK analysis.  
Renal impairment 
Fampridine exposure was significantly increased in subjects with renal impairment: the mean Cmax and 
AUC 0-inf  increased  by  67%  and  75%  in  mildly  impaired  subjects,  60%  and  105%  in  moderately 
impaired  subjects,  and  by  100%  and  299%  in  severely  impaired  subjects,  respectively,  when 
compared to normal subjects. There was a substantial increase in T1/2 in severely impaired patients of 
14.3 hrs as compared to normal subjects (6.4 hrs). Fampridine was almost completely renally cleared; 
thus,  it  was  noted  that  a  small  decline  in  renal  capacity  would  result  in  significant  accumulation  of 
fampridine.  
Hepatic impairment 
The applicant did not conduct studies in patients with hepatic impairment. In vivo hepatic metabolism 
was about 10%. Dose adjustment was not considered necessary for subjects with hepatic impairment.

Elderly 
The applicant has neither conducted studies in the elderly nor considered  dose adjustment necessary 
for  this  patient  group.  Since  renal  function  declines  with  age,  concerns  related  to  renal  impairment 
were also considered applicable to this patient sub-population.  
Paediatrics 
Fampridine was granted a full product-specific waiver.  
Gender 
Clearance  of  fampridine  was  approximately  14.5%  lower  in  females.  This  observation  was  not 
considered clinically relevant.  
Weight 
Body mass index did not affect fampridine pharmacokinetics according to the Population PK analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
 
In vitro 
As mentioned above (in section “Metabolism”), the applicant performed studies to evaluate the extent 
to which fampridine is metabolized by CYP enzymes, inhibits their activity, or induces their expression. 
Based on the study results it was concluded that CYP2E1 is the major enzyme responsible for 3-OH-4-
AP formation. No direct or time-dependent inhibition of CYP activity was observed at concentrations up 
to  30  M  (2  820  ng/mL)  of  fampridine  and  no  induction  of  CYP  activity  in  human  hepatocytes  was 
observed following incubation with fampridine at test concentrations up to 25 M (2 350 ng/mL) for 3 
consecutive days.  
The  applicant  performed  in  vitro  studies  indicating  that  OCT-2  (Organic  cation  transporter)  is  the 
transporter mainly involved in the active secretion of fampridine. Given the high contribution of active 
secretion  to  the  main  renal  elimination  pathway  (approximately  60%)  and  the  narrow  therapeutic 
index of fampridine, clinically significant interaction on the level of OCT2 is expected.  
 
In vivo 
Two  drug  interaction  studies  with  two  commonly  used  drugs  in  patients  with  MS  (baclofen  and 
interferon-beta) were performed.  
Baclofen 
Study  0194-002  was  a  balanced,  randomized,  single-dose,  three  treatment  period  cross-over  drug-
drug  interaction  study  of  fampridine  CR,  15  mg  capsule  and  Baclofen,  10 mg  tablet  under  fasted 
conditions.  Twelve  healthy  male  volunteers  enrolled  into  the  study  with  all  subjects  completing  the 
study  and  providing  PK  data.  The  AUC  and  Cmax  for  both  treatments  were  similar  whether  they  were 
administered  separately  or  simultaneously.  Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  PK  parameters  for 
fampridine were not affected by coadministration with baclofen.   
Interferon 
Study 1194-001US was a single center, open-label, single and multiple doses PK and safety drug-drug 
interaction study of fampridine IR, 7.5 mg and subcutaneous injections of 8 million units of Betaseron. 
ASSESSMENT REPORT

A  total  of  twelve  MS  patients  (4  males/8  females)  enrolled  into  the  study  with  9  patients  (3  males/ 
6 females) completing the study and providing PK data.  
For both treatment options, after single dose administration and at steady state doses, AUC, Cmax and 
Tmax  levels  for  fampridine  were  comparable  following  administration  of  fampridine  alone  or  following 
coadministration  of  fampridine  and  Betaseron.  Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  there  is  no  PK  drug-
drug interaction of Betaseron administration on fampridine.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is a selective potassium channel blocker. It is a lipid-soluble drug which 
readily  crosses  the  blood-brain  barrier.  The  indication  claimed  was  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
Multiple  Sclerosis  for  the  improvement  of  walking  ability.  Fampridine  is  formulated  as  a  prolonged  -
release  tablet  and  the  recommended  dose  is  one  10  mg  tablet  twice  daily,  taken  12  hours  apart.  A 
prolonged release tablet has been developed to reduce peak plasma concentrations associated adverse 
events. 
By  blocking  potassium  reflux  the  hyperpolarisation  phase  of  an  action  potential  is  reduced. 
Consequently  the  relative  refractory  period  of  the  action  potential  is  shortened,  allowing  the  action 
potential to propagate along the cell membrane.  This, according to the applicant, especially applies for 
unmyelinated  axons  where  the  action  potential  dampens  quickly  below  a  depolarisation  threshold  too 
low for activating the adjacent membrane.   
The  K+  channels  are  located  primarily  in  the  paranodal  and  internodal  membrane  of  the  axon  where 
they  are  not  significantly  activated  by  the  passage  of  an  action  potential  because  the  myelin  sheath 
acts  as  an  electrical  shield.  In  demyelinated  axons  the  internodal  membrane  and  its  ion  channels 
become  exposed  to  larger  electrical  transients  during  the  action  potential.  Under  these  conditions, 
leakage  of  ion  current  through  the  K+  channel  can  contribute  to  action  potential  conduction  block. 
Fampridine  at  low  concentration  may  prolong  nerve  action  potentials  by  blocking  these  exposed 
channels and inhibiting repolarisation, subsequently improving axon potential propagation.  
Considering the mechanism of action of fampridine, there is a plausible biological rationale to evaluate 
the  usefulness  of  fampridine in  symptomatic  treatment  in  multiple  sclerosis.  Whether  fampridine  acts 
on  specific  K+  channels  and  how  these  K+  channels  are  distributed  over  organs  and  central  nervous 
system remained unclear.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The primary pharmacology of fampridine was not addressed sufficiently in the dossier. In response to 
the CHMP request, the applicant provided an overview of the type, physiology and tissue distribution of 
the various K+ channels in humans and some other species. Main conclusions were that demyelinated 
fibres show higher susceptibility to K+ channel blockers, as compared to normal nerve fibres, probably 
due to morphological changes in the positional and exposure of these channels.  
The  voltage-gated  K+  channels  (target  of  fampridine)  showed  expression  in  excitable  cells  including 
neurons,  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle,  smooth  muscle  and  lymphocytes.  Hence,  effects  of  fampridine 
could  be  expected  in  these  tissues  and  this  has  been  addressed  accordingly  in  the  safety  questions 
posed  to  the  applicant.  Since  the  expression  of  4-AP-sensitive  Kv  channel  types  varied  widely  across 
different  tissue  and  cell  types  and  between  species,  the  preclinical  findings  were  of  limited  value. 
Therefore  the  long-term  safety  data  from  exposure  in  humans  was  considered  indispensable  by  the 
CHMP.  
The  PK/PD  relationship  has  been  evaluated  by  the  means  of  modelling  and  simulation.  Based  on  the 
clinical data, the model overestimated exposure-response relationship. Based on the clinical data, with 
doses  above  10  mg,  there  appeared  to  be  no  dose-response  relationship  for  doses  10  mg  bid  and 
above.  Based  on  the  model,  there  was  a  clear  relationship  between  AUC  and  CNS-related  adverse 
events, which was also confirmed by the clinical data. Based on these data, it was expected that there 
is an even sharper relationship between C max and AEs. 
Pharmacodynamic  interactions  have  not  been  discussed  by  the  applicant.  Given  the  mechanism  of 
action  i.e.  K+  channel  blocker,  fampridine  should  be  considered  a  narrow  therapeutic  index  drug, 
unless proven otherwise, as K+ channels are ubiquitously present in the organism in general and in the 
CNS  in  particular.  Potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  are  expected  with  antiepileptic  agents  and 
anti-arrhythmic agents influencing sodium-potassium current.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is a selective potassium channel blocker. In the CHMP view, the dossier 
contains a limited overview of the primary pharmacology of fampridine in support of this mechanism. 
It  has  not  been  well-evaluated  whether  fampridine  acts  on  specific  K+  channels  and  how  these  K+ 
channels  are  distributed  in  the  different  organs  and  central  nervous  systems.  It  also  remains  unclear 
whether the K+ channels are subject to homologous down/up-regulations like pharmaco-receptors, i.e. 
whether hypersensitivity or tolerance develops. In addition, electrophysiological data in support of the 
mechanism  of  action  are  not  well-presented.  In  their  response  to  questions  raised  by  the  CHMP,  the 
applicant  presented  a  limited  overview  of  the  primary  pharmacology  of  fampridine.  Importantly,  the 
expression of 4-AP-sensitive K+ channel types varies widely across different tissue and cell types with a 
considerable variability of expression between species. Therefore, it was noted that the transferability 
of  preclinical  findings  to  humans  is  difficult.  This  emphasises  the  need  of  safety  data  in  certain 
subgroups  of  MS  patients  e.g.  patients  with  compromised  cardio-vascular  function  or  renal  function. 
With  regard  to  the  electrophysiological  studies  in  multiple  sclerosis  patients,  positive  data  are 
unexpectedly  rare.  Most  studies  referred  to  were  performed  in  the  past  (1983  –  2004),  were 
uncontrolled  and  included  a  small  numbers  of  MS  patients.  The  data  from  two  controlled  cross-over 
studies  in  multiple  sclerosis  subjects  provided  evidence  for  improvement  of  motor  evoked  potentials 
(van Diemen et al. 1993, Rossini et al., 2001). These results were however not convincing. Moreover, 
studies with the current formulation and dose (which is lower) were not performed.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  fampridine  is  linear;  fampridine  is  absorbed  in  a  dose  proportional  manner 
and  there  is  no  accumulation  after  repeated  doses.  It  is  unbound  to  plasma  proteins  and  almost 
completely  eliminated  via  urinary  excretion.  Major  fraction  recovered  was  contributed  to  the  parent 
drug. The PK profile in MS patients is not different from that of healthy volunteers. Two minor inactive

metabolites were identified in the urine: 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine and its sulphate. Whether 4-AP N-
oxide,  a  metabolite  found  in  rats,  is  also  relevant  for  humans  was  not  clear.  In  the  response,  the 
applicant clarified that 4-AP N-oxide metabolite is not formed in humans.  
Only  one  strength  (10  mg)  has  been  developed  which  limits  the  possibility  of  dose  adjustments  in 
special  populations  and/or  intolerant  subjects.  Fampridine  exposure  is  significantly  increased  in 
subjects  with  renal  impairment  which  also  applies  to  subjects  with  mild  renal  impairment.  From  the 
clinical data it is clear that subjects with mild renal impairment have more adverse events as compared 
to subjects with normal renal functioning. 
This issue was raised as a major objection and the applicant was asked to evaluate alternative dosing 
regimes by data simulation for this special population, as it could be more desirable to divide the dose 
over  a  day  (e.g.  5  mg  bid)  to  prevent  an  initial  high  exposure  and  Cmax  related  AEs.  The  applicant 
could not address this issue in their response. Because it is expected that once daily dosing would not 
result in a similar exposure as seen after bid dosing in subjects with normal renal function and because 
there  is  a  linear  relationship  between  increase  in  Cmax  and  decreasing  renal  function,  the  CHMP 
expressed  concerns  regarding  use  of  fampridine  in  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment.   Further, 
considering  prevalence  of  mild  renal  impairment  in  the  elderly,  it  was  noted  that  use  of  fampridine 
would  be  precluded  in  a  substantial  proportion  of  this  population.  The  applicant  has  not  conducted 
studies  in  the  elderly  and  only  a limited  number  of  elderly  patients  have  been  included  in  the  clinical 
studies performed. 
The  CHMP  pointed  out  that  PK  interactions  with  renally  cleared  drugs,  transporters  involved  in  the 
renal excretion and diuretics may be expected. Based on the data provided by the applicant, the CHMP 
agreed that the risk of interactions with lithium, digoxine, gabapentin and diuretics could be considered 
small. As indicated in the section “Pharmacokinetic studies – in vitro”, interactions at the level of OCT-
2 is expected, as OCT-2 is the transporter involved in the active secretion of fampridine.  With respect 
to the role of OCT2 polymorphism, the CHMP agreed that it is not expected to play an important role in 
fampridine clearance. 
Further,  the  CHMP  raised  a  question  concerning  the  rate  of  glucuronidation,  as  accumulation  was 
observed  in  renal  impairment;  the  glucuronidation  pathway  may  be  subject  to  interaction,  UGT 
polymorphism  and  the  glucuronidates  may  be  pharmacologically  active.  Based  on  results  in  humans 
and  from  animal  species, the  CHMP  agreed  that  glucuronidation did  not  occur  and interactions  at  the 
UGT level can be excluded. 
Potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  of  fampridine  were  not  sufficiently  addressed  in  the  dossier. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  potential  pharmacodynamic  interactions  can  be  expected  with  antiepileptic 
agents and anti-arrhythmic agents that affect sodium-potassium current.  
With respect to cardiac safety, the data originating in the QTc study were scrutinised by the CHMP. It 
was noted that, in general, the ECG effects in the moxifloxacine arm were marginal, which questioned 
the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  entire  study.  Considering  the  marginal  or  no  change  from  baseline 
values in the moxifloxacine arm (0.0 ms in QTcI, 0.9 ms in QTcF and 4.7 ms in QTcB), it was striking 
that  in  most  measurements  for  the  fampridine  treatment  groups,  the  corresponding  values  were 
negative (-4.5  ms in QTcI, -4.3 ms in QTcF and  -2.2 ms in QTcB for fampridine 10 mg). Considering 
this, the study did not reduce concerns with respect to unfavourable cardiac safety of fampridine.   
The PK/PD relationship has been evaluated by the means of modelling and simulation. The exposure-
response  relationship  observed  was  not  confirmed  in  the  clinical  studies.  Based  on  the  model,  there 
seemed to be a clear relationship between AUC and CNS-related adverse events, which was confirmed 
by  the  clinical  data.  Based  on  these  data,  it  was  expected  that  there  is  an  even  more  pronounced 
relationship  between  C max  and  AEs.  Accordingly,  issues  concerning  AUC  variability,  which  are  usually 
minor, were considered  particularly relevant in this context: food intake, intra-individual variability of 
fampridine  and  information  about  reaching  the  steady-state.  As  described  in  section  “Absorption  – 
influence  of  food”,  due  to  the  significant  increase  of  Cmax  with  food  intake  (by  15-23%),  the  CHMP 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 29/89
 
 
 
noted  that  the  product  should  be  taken  without  food.  With  respect  to  intra-individual  variability,  the 
CHMP agreed that the estimated intra-individual %CV (approximately 20% for both Cmax and AUC) was 
established  to  be  low  and  thus,  fampridine  was  not  considered  a  highly  variable  drug.  The  applicant 
confirmed that a steady-state is reached within 2 days.  
The CHMP noted that animal and human data concerning excretion into mother’s milk are lacking.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Fampridine is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug, unless proven otherwise. The development 
of one dose strength allows limited flexibility with dosing which poses problems in patients with renal 
impairment  including  the  elderly.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  interaction  potential  of  fampridine  needs 
further evaluation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study MS-F202  
This  was  a  Phase  II,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group,  20-week  treatment  study  (one 
week  post  screening,  two  weeks  of  single-blind  placebo,  two  weeks  of  double-blind  dose  escalation, 
twelve weeks of double-blind stable dose treatment, one week of double-blind down-titration and two 
weeks of follow-up period) to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral fampridine-SR in patients 
with  multiple  sclerosis.  Patients  were  randomized  to  one  of  four  treatment  groups:  placebo  or 
Fampridine-SR 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg b.i.d. The study scheme is presented in the figure 2 below: 
Fig. 2 Study MS-F202 Overview of the treatment groups  
Subjects included had confirmed multiple sclerosis, were able to perform the test  procedures and  did 
not  receive  background  medication  other  than  interferons  or  Copaxone.  Patients  had  to  be  able  to 
complete the Timed 25 feet walking test (T25FW) at the Screening Visit in an average of 8–60 seconds 
(3.1-0.47 ft/sec).  
Primary  endpoint  was  the  improvement  in  average  walking  speed  in  the  stable  treatment  period 
relative  to  the  baseline  period  based  on  the  T25FW.  Secondary  endpoints  included,  among  others, 
other  T25FW  derived  variables,  the  MSFC-9-Hole  Peg  Test,  the  MSFC-PASAT  3,  the  MSFC  total,  the 
Ashworth Score, MSWS-12, CCGI, SGI, SSQ, CSQ, OSQ and the MSQLI.

A Baseline is the average of Study Visits 1 and 2, or the value of last pre-treatment visit. Endpoint is the 
last observation available during study treatment. 
B Overall p-values (not presented here) are based on a test of treatment effect using an ANOVA model 
with main effects for treatment and centre; pair wise p-values based on Dunnett's test. 
C Speed,  Asworth Score, MSWS-12 score: Average of 3 (2) visits in the stable treatment period. Average 
change from baseline of log-transformed walking speeds of two trials of Timed 25-Foot Walk.  
D Responders are defined as subjects with a >=20% increase in walking speed from baseline to the 
average of values obtained during the stable dose period. Subjects who dropped out prior to the stable 
dose period are considered as non-responders. Overall and pair wise p-values are from the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by centre. 
E  LEMMT: Endpoint is the last observation available 
In  summary,  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  other  T25FW  derived  variable  (%  responders)  no 
significant differences compared to placebo were observed. With the exception of the LEMMT, in none 
of  the  secondary  efficacy  variables  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  Fampridine-SR 
groups and placebo could be shown. Furthermore, a dose-response relationship was not demonstrated. 
Due  to  the  lack  of  a  clear  dose  depending  effect,  absence  of  investigating the  minimal effective  dose 
was considered as a flaw by the CHMP, particularly in the context of the safety profile of fampridine.  
A  correlation  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  possible  relationships  between  the  primary  efficacy 
assessment  (walking speed) and changes in two other outcome measures that relate directly to lower 
extremity  function:  LEMMT  (muscle  strength)  and  Ashworth  score  (spasticity).  Further  multiple 
regression techniques were used to determine the degree to which improvements in walking ability in 
response to treatment depend on changes in muscle strength and/or spasticity. This was implemented 
by performing a multiple regression analysis of average walking speed on overall LEMMT and Ashworth 
scores.  None  of  the  linear  relationships  was  statistically  significant.  Multiple  regression  techniques  to 
determine  the  degree  to  which  improvements  in  walking  ability  depend  on  either  change  in  muscle 
strength and/or spasticity were assessed by estimating the slope for each treatment group. There were 
no noteworthy findings.  
Post Hoc Analysis 
It was observed that a proportion of patients (around 30%) seemed to respond with consistently faster 
walking speeds while on study drug than when off treatment.  
Consequently,  an  alternative  responder  analysis  was  performed  post  hoc.  A  treatment  responder  (in 
terms  of  consistency  of  response)  was  defined  as  a  patient  with  a  faster  walking  speed  for  at  least 
three visits during the double-blind treatment period as compared to the maximum value measured in 
the set of five non-treatment visits. The percentage responder rate according to the new definition was 
8.5%  for  placebo,  35.3%  for  fampridine  10  mg  b.i.d.,  36.0%  for  fampridine  15  mg  b.i.d.  and  38.6% 
for fampridine 20 mg b.i.d. Given that there was little difference in responsiveness between the three 
doses examined, further analyses were performed comparing the pooled Fampridine-SR treated groups 
against the placebo-treated group. The percentage of patients who met the responder criterion in the 
combined Fampridine-SR group was 36.7% compared to 8.5% in the placebo-treated group, and this 
difference was statistically significant (p<0.001).

2.5.2.  Main studies 
The  main  studies  for  the  clinical  development  programme  for  multiple  sclerosis  comprised  two  phase 
III studies: 
  Study MS-F203: 
A  phase  3,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  21-week  (one  week  post  screening,  two  weeks  of 
placebo,  14  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment,  and  four  weeks  of  no  treatment  as  follow-up), 
parallel  group  study  to  evaluate  safety  and  efficacy  of  oral  Fampridine-  SR  (10  mg  b.i.d.)  in 
subjects with Multiple Sclerosis. 
  Study MS-F204: 
A multi-center, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 14-week study (one week 
post  screening,  two  weeks  of  single-blind  placebo  run-in,  nine  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment, 
and  two  weeks  of  no-treatment  follow-up)  to  evaluate  safety  and  efficacy  of  oral  Fampridine-SR 
(10 mg b.i.d.) in subjects with Multiple Sclerosis and to explore the duration of effect over the 12-
hour dosing interval. 
The  dose  selected  was  based  on  previous  experience  with  this  patient  population;  study  MS-F202,  in 
particular: doses greater than 10 mg b.i.d. did not appear to provide any additional benefit in efficacy, 
but were associated with increased incidence of adverse events and discontinuation of treatment. 
Both studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 differed in their design with respect to the duration of the double-
blind phase (14 weeks against 9 weeks) and the randomisation scheme (3:1 against 1:1), respectively. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Patients included had clinically confirmed multiple sclerosis as defined by McDonald criteria and had to 
be able to perform all required study procedures, especially to complete two trials of the Timed 25 feet 
walking  test  (F25FW)  at  the  Screening  Visit  in  an  average  of  8–  45  seconds  (3.1-  1.8  ft/sec).  Main 
exclusion criteria were any history of seizures or evidence of epileptiform activity on an EEG, start of 
new  immunomodulatory  treatment  regime  for  MS,  current  exacerbation,  receiving  corticosteroids, 
cyclophosphamide  or  mitoxantrone  for  MS,  presence  of  significant  cardiovascular  abnormalities  and 
ECG. Duration of disease and type of multiple sclerosis were not covered in the in-/exclusion criteria. 
Discontinuation of study treatment was required, if a patient should experience a seizure. Occurrence 
of  an  exacerbation,  irrespective  whether  corticosteroids  were  administered,  was  no  reason  for 
excluding a patient from the study per se. 
Treatments 
Design of both studies is depicted in the figures 3 and 4 below.

In  studies  MS-F203/204  patients  received  placebo  or  Fampridine-SR  10  mg  b.i.d.  in  a  12  hrs  dose 
interval.  Patients were instructed to take one tablet every 12 hours, at approximately the same time 
each day. 
Concomitant Therapy 
Patients entering the study were to be stable on any concomitant medication for at least three weeks 
prior to the screening visit.  
Patients were excluded if they started a treatment regimen of Betaseron, Avonex, Copaxone, Rebif, or 
Tysabri within 90 days prior screening visit or had any change in dose regime of these drugs within 30 
days  prior  to  the  screening  visit.  Patients  were  also  to  be  excluded  if  they  received  corticosteroids 
within  30  days  prior  to  the  screening  visit,  or  cyclophosphamide  or  mitoxantrone  for  MS  treatment 
within  six  months  prior  to  the  screening  visit.  These  restrictions  were  imposed  with  the  goal  of 
minimizing concomitant drug-related changes in MS symptoms, particularly motor function, during the 
trials.  
Objectives 
The objectives of the pivotal trials MS-F203 and MS-F204 were to assess the efficacy (assessment by 
walking speed improvements) and safety of Fampridine-SR in patients with multiple sclerosis.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of ‘consistent’ responders defined as patients with higher 
walking  speed  for  at  least  three  out  of  four  visits  during  the  double-blind  period  as  compared  to  the 
maximum  value  among  the  non-treatment  visits.  Walking  speed  was  based  on  the  T25FW  Test, 
wherein a patient was asked to walk as quickly as possible, safely, from one end to the other end of a 
clearly  marked,  unobstructed,  25-foot  course.  After  a  maximum  rest  of  5  minutes  the  test  was 
repeated again. The walking speed for a particular study visit was the average of the walking speeds of 
the two trials performed. If one of the 2 trials could not be fulfilled then the walking speed for that visit 
was to be the walking speed from the completed trial.  
Main  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  concerned  the  12-Item  MS  Walking  Scale,  the  Lower  Extremity 
Manual Muscle Testing score and the Ashworth Spasticity Examination score. The 12-Item MS Walking 
Scale is a multi-item rating scale of walking assessed by the patient. The total score ranges from 12 to 
60  points  and  is  transformed  to  a  0  (none)  -100  (maximum  disability)  scale.  The  Lower  Extremity

Manual Muscle Testing (LEMMT) is a muscle strengths score and the Ashworth Spasticity Examination 
assesses  muscle  tone.  Subject’s  global  impression  (SGI)  and  Clinical  global  impression  (CGI)  were 
assessed  to  provide  secondary  measures  for  validation  of  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  the  walking 
response criterion. 
Sample size 
Study MS-F203 
A sample size of 180 patients treated with Fampridine-SR, along with 60 placebo-treated patients, was 
calculated  to  provide  approximately  90%  power,  at  an  overall significance  level  no  greater  than  0.05 
and no less than 0.000125, for the three criteria defined in the statistical analysis plan for the primary 
measure (see the table 10 below).  
Table 10 Assumptions for the Power Calculation 
Study MS-F204 
A  sample  size  of  92  patients  treated  with  Fampridine-SR  10  mg  b.i.d.  and  92  patients  treated  with 
placebo would provide approximately 90% power, at an overall significance level of 0.05, to detect the 
difference between a Fampridine-SR 10 mg b.i.d. response rate of 30% and a placebo response rate of 
10%. To ensure that at least 184 patients complete the study, approximately 100 patients were to be 
randomized  to  each  group.  The  above  calculation  was  based  on  assumptions  about  the  response 
criterion from studies MS-F202 and MS-F203 and the low drop-out rate observed in these two studies. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to either the 10 mg Fampridine-SR or placebo treatment group in a 3:1 ratio 
in  study  MS-F203  and  1:1  ratio in  study  MS-F204,  according  to  a  computer-generated  randomization 
scheme. In study MS-F203 the randomization scheme was blocked and stratified by treatment site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The first two weeks of the studies was a single-blind placebo run-in phase. The remainder of the study 
treatment  period  was  double-blind.  Placebo  tablets  were  identical  in  appearance  and  package  to  the 
Fampridine-SR  tablets  and  contained  the  same  set  of  inactive  ingredients.  Patient,  Clinician  and 
evaluator were not aware of the treatment assigned.

In  studies  MS-F202/203/204,  the  principal  analysis  of  efficacy  was  based  on  the  ITT  population 
consisting  of  all  randomized  patients  to  whom double-blind  study  medication  was  dispensed  and  who 
had  at  least  one  efficacy  (T25FW  and  MSWS-12)  evaluation  during  the  treatment  period.  Treatment 
differences in the proportion of responders between Fampridine-SR treated and placebo treated groups 
were analyzed by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, controlled for centre. 
The responder-analysis was the first step in a three stage, stepwise analysis that defined the primary 
endpoint.  The  second  step  of  the  analysis  was  to  be  ‘validation  of  the  clinical  meaningfulness’  of  the 
responder  criterion  by  comparing  the  changes  in  MSWS-12  scores  in  responders  and  non-responders 
(without treatment attribution) during the double-blind treatment period. The third and final step was 
to  demonstrate  statistically  significant  improvement  in  walking  speed  in  Fampridine-SR  treated 
responders  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (responders  plus  non-responders)  at  the  last  visit  on 
treatment to confirm maintenance of effect. In addition to examination of walking speed, data from the 
individual  responder  analysis  groups  (Fampridine-SR  responder,  Fampridine-SR  non-responder  and 
placebo-treated  groups)  were  also  to  be  analyzed  with  respect  to  changes  in  leg  muscle  strength 
(LEMMT) and spasticity (Ashworth score). For study MS-F202 the data were re-analyzed in accordance 
to the statistical analyses plans of studies 203/204, making between study comparisons possible.  
In  addition  to  examination  of  walking  speed,  data  from  the  individual  responder  analysis  groups 
(Fampridine-SR responder, Fampridine-SR non-responder and placebo-treated groups) was also to be 
analyzed with respect to changes in leg muscle strength (LEMMT) and spasticity (Ashworth score). 
The overall significance level of the above was to be no greater than 0.05 and no less than 0.000125 
(i.e. 0.053) if each test is conducted at the 0.05 level. For the full picture, all nominal p-values were to 
be  presented  for  every  efficacy  variable.  Additional  correction  for  multiple  comparisons  of  the 
secondary efficacy variables was pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
The  average  change  from  baseline  in  the  MSWS-12  score  was  analysed  by  an  analysis  of  variance 
model,  with  effects  for  responder  status  and  centre.  Similar  analyses  (responder  vs.  non-responder) 
were to be performed on the other two secondary subjective variables, average SGI score during the 
double-blind period and the CGI score, recorded at the end of the double-blind period. 
For  the  endpoint  change  from  baseline  and  each  of  the  secondary  objective  variables,  differences 
between  the  three  responder  analysis  groups  (placebo,  Fampridine-SR  non-responders,  and 
Fampridine-SR responders) were to be analysed by t-tests of the least-squares means using the mean 
square  error  via  an  ANOVA  model  with  effects  for  responder  analysis  group  and  adjusted  for  centre. 
For the pooled analyses study was included as an additional factor controlled for.

Recruitment 
In study MS-F203, the date of the first patient visit was 7 June 2005; the date of the last patient visit 
was  28  June  2006.  In  study  MS-F204,  the  date  of  first  patient  visit was  22  May  2007;  date  of  last 
patient visit was 27 Feb 2008. 
Conduct of the study 
Two  protocol  amendments  were  issued  for  the  trial  MS-F203.  In  addition,  several  changes  in  the 
planned analyses occurred after the protocol and amendments, but before breaking the blind: addition 
of  another  efficacy  variable  (consistency  of  improvements  in  the  LEMMT),  ordering  of  secondary 
endpoints for the trial and clarifications of study outcome expectations. The additions were included in 
the  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  of  the  study.  Two  amendments  were  issued  for  the  trial  MS-F204  with 
regard to efficacy to the original study protocol. 
Protocol Deviations 
In  both  studies,  the  majority  of  protocol  deviations  were  considered  minor  (e.g.  assessment  not 
performed,  out-of-window  visits,  minor  drug  compliance  issues  and  plasma  sample  taken  out  of 
protocol-specified time window). None was considered sufficiently significant to affect interpretation of 
study results.

Outcomes and estimation 
Figure  5  presents  responder  analyses  for  studies  MS-F202  (post-hoc),  MS-F203,  MS-F204  and  the 
pooled  analysis  MS-F202/3/4.  For  studies  MS-F203  and  MS-F204  the  primary  outcome  was  met,  i.e. 
difference  in  responder  rates  (primary  endpoint)  was  statistically  significant.  The  retrospective  re-
analysis of study MS-F202 was consistent with these results.  
Pooling studies MS-F202/3/4, the responder rates were 37.3% for the fampridine group and 8.9% for 
the placebo group (difference 28.4%, CI95% 22.1%; 34.2%; p<0.001, CI by assessor).

A A responder was defined as a patient with a faster walking speed for at least three visits during the 
double-blind treatment period (out of a possible total of four) as compared to the maximum speed for 
any of the pre-treatment visits and the first post-treatment visit. A patient who missed a visit was 
counted as a non-responder for that visit. 
B Least squares means, standard errors, p-values, and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from 
an ANOVA model controlled for centre. 
C P-values and 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios (OR) for the individual studies were 
obtained from a logistic regression model, controlled for centre.  
D Average change over DB period. 
Of note, converting walking speed into seconds to bridge a 25 feet distance, the mean at endpoint was 
13.6 vs 13 seconds (placebo vs fampridine) in study MS-F202, 11.6 vs 10.8 seconds in study MS-F203 
and 10.5 vs 10.2 seconds in study MS-F204.  
As  presented  above,  in  the  pivotal  studies  MS-F203  and  MS-F204,  differences  between  the  active 
treatment  and  placebo  in  the  average  change  in  LEMMT  Score,  Ashworth  Score  and  MSWS-12  score 
(secondary  endpoints)  were  either  statistically  significant  or  showed  a  trend  towards  statistical 
significance;  however,  clinical  relevance  of  these  observations  was  questioned  (see  Discussion  of 
Clinical Efficacy). The mean changes in these parameters from baseline were small.

For the SGI and CGI there was no or almost no shift in median, indicating that the improvement might 
not be perceived as substantial.  
Within responder analysis 
The  within  responder  analysis is  described  in  detail  under  the  “Statistical  methods”.    In this  analysis, 
results  were  only  slightly  better  i.e.  the  average  number  of  seconds  to  bridge  25  feet  during  the 
double-blind phase was 11.7 seconds under placebo, 12.0 seconds for fampridine non-responders and 
9.8 seconds for fampridine responders.  
Also  the  fampridine  PR  Timed-Walk  responders  had  statistically  significant  greater  average  increases 
(improvement) in LEMMT scores when compared to the placebo group. The average increase in LEMMT 
score  for  the  fampridine  PR  Timed-Walk  responders  was  0.15  units  compared  to  0.03  units  for  the 
placebo  group.  The  baseline  score  was  4.0  points.  Also  for  the  Ashworth  score  the  improvement  was 
statistically significant but small, i.e. 0.19 points in fampridine responders as compared to -0.09 points 
in the placebo group (baseline score 0.91-0.95 points). For the Subject Global Impression and Clinician 
Global Impression there was no or almost no shift in median in the within responder analysis.  
Maintenance of effect 
Three  ongoing,  long-term,  open-label  extension  studies  (studies  MS-F202EXT,  MS-F203EXT,  MS-
F204EXT)  have  enrolled  660  multiple  sclerosis  patients.    Three-hundred  three  patients  have  been 
treated  for  2  years  or  longer.  An  equivalent  Timed-Walk  response  analysis  was  performed  using  a 
definition  of  an  Extension  Timed-Walk  responder  as  a  patient  with  walking  speeds  at  the  majority  of 
extension study visits in the first year that are faster than the fastest walking speed at any of the off-
treatment visits in the double-blind parent study or the extension study. 
The  average  percent  change  from  baseline  walking  speed  for  the  Extension  Timed-Walk  responders 
and  Extension  Timed-Walk  non-responders  is  shown  for  all  patients  in  MS-F203EXT  (see  figure  6 
below). The functional improvement observed during treatment with fampridine PR in the double-blind 
studies  was  rapidly  lost  after  cessation  of  treatment,  without  evidence  of  rebound.  For  Extension 
Timed-Walk  responders,  average  walking  speed  at  each  extension  study  visit  was  slightly  more  than 
30%  faster  than  the  baseline  walking  speed  from  the  double-blind  study  during  the  first  year  of  the 
extension study, and slightly decreased to approximately 23% at following two visits.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No  studies  were  performed  in  special  populations.  Of  note,  the  studies  conducted  included  only  a 
limited  number  of  the  elderly,  i.e.  4.9%  of  the  multiple  sclerosis  patients  were  older  than  65  years. 
Moreover,  the  studies  did  not  include  patients  with  compromised  cardio-vascular  function  or  seizure 
prone subjects, as these factors were exclusion criteria. 
Supportive studies 
Study MS-F20-F201  
This  was  a  randomised  placebo  controlled  parallel  group  dose-ranging  study.  Patients  with  multiple 
sclerosis received placebo (n=11) or fampridine-SR (n=25) in increasing doses from 10 mg to 40 mg. 
The primary objective was to determine the tolerance of escalating doses of fampridine (10, 20, 30, 40 
mg BID). Total treatment duration was 8 weeks. The outcomes concerned fatigue scores, LEMMT, and 
MSFC.  With  respect  to  efficacy,  statistical  significance  as  compared  to  placebo  was  observed  for  the 
LEMMT score, but not for the T25FW. The reciprocal of walking time i.e. walking speed was identified 
as  a  suitable  transformation  to  improve  the  normality  of  the  data.  The  resulting  post-hoc  analysis 
showed  statistically  significant  differences  as  compared  to  placebo  for  walking  speed.  Statistical 
significance was not achieved for the other outcome variables.  
Three  long-term,  open-label  extension  studies  with  fampridine  PR  (MS-F202EXT,  MS-F203EXT,  and 
MS-F204EXT)  are  currently  ongoing.  The  efficacy  data  originating  in  these  trials  are  reflected  in  the 
“Maintenance of Effect section” and in the Discussion on clinical efficacy. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Introduction  
Fampridine  is  a  selective  potassium  channel  blocker.  Considering  this  mechanism  of  action  of 
fampridine,  there  is  a  plausible  biological  rationale  to  evaluate  the  usefulness  of  fampridine  in 
symptomatic  treatment  in  multiple  sclerosis.  This  view,  i.e.  that  fampridine  could  potentially  be  a 
useful drug for treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was shared by the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) 
for Neurology. 
The  indication  claimed  for  fampridine  was  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  for  the 
improvement  of  walking  ability.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  indication  was  restricted  to  what  has  been 
observed rather than being conceptual, e.g. symptomatic treatment of neurological dysfunction due to 
demyelinisation in multiple sclerosis. Although improvement of walking ability may have merits on its 
own,  an  improvement  of  other  symptoms  caused  by  demyelinisation  would  have  given  more  body  to 
the evidence of efficacy.  
Three studies were indicated as being relevant by the applicant, i.e. a dose comparison study MS-F202 
and two pivotal studies MS-F203 and MS-F204.   
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Timed-25 Foot Walk test / responder definition 
The  primary endpoint  in  the  pivotal  studies  was  the proportion  of  responders  based  on  the  Timed  25 
feet walking test (T25FW), i.e. the time in seconds it takes to walk 25 feet.  
The  walking  speed  for  a  particular  visit  was  derived  by  calculating  the  average  of  two  walking  tests 
separated  by  at  least  5  minutes.  If  one  test  was  missed  then  the  walking  speed  from  the  completed 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011

test was taken. If both trials were missed, the walking speed for the visit was to be considered slower 
than the maximum speed recorded during the non-double-blind period. In principle, the failure of two 
walking tests in the same visit should be considered a failure. The applicant submitted additional data 
indicating  that  missing  a  second  walk  was  rare.  Hence,  it  is  unlikely  that  this  affects  the  outcome 
substantially. 
A  responder  was  defined  as  a  patient  with  a  higher  walking  speed  for  at  least  three  visits  during  the 
double-blind treatment period (out of a possible total of four) as compared to the maximum speed for 
any  of  the  pre-treatment  visits  and  the  first  post-treatment  visit.  This  responder  definition  was 
questioned  by  the  CHMP.    In  principle,  a  responder  analysis  was  considered  useful,  as  in  general  it 
incorporates  a  clinically  significant  improvement  on  an  individual  patient  level.  In  this  case  however, 
the CHMP was of the view that the definition focused more on consistency of the effect, i.e. persistence 
of any improvement above the maximum off-treatment speed, not taking into account the magnitude 
of the improvement. 
Further, the T25FW test measures essentially the speed of walking. It was argued by the applicant that 
walking  speed  alone  is  a  meaningful  treatment  goal,  since  a  limited  walking  speed  impacts  everyday 
activities and social participation. The CHMP acknowledged that a certain walking speed in daily life is 
needed e.g. for crossing a street safely. However, it was also noted that if 2.6 ft/sec is needed to cross 
a  street  safely,  as  argued  by  the  applicant,  under fampridine  treatment  on  the  average,  this  velocity 
would not be reached.  
In the CHMP view, it remained unclear whether the T25FW test reflects walking sufficiently as walking 
also  requires  muscle  strength,  sensory  feedback  and  coordination.  In  this  respect,  the  T25FW  was 
considered a pharmacodynamic endpoint rather than a clinically relevant outcome. That the T25FW is 
frequently  used  may  indicate  its  convenience  of  use,  but  this  was  not  considered  by  the  CHMP  the 
same as being clinically relevant for walking ability.  
These issues were put forward to the SAG, as they are related to the interpretation of clinical relevance 
of the observed effect discussed below.   
The  SAG  considered  the  T25FW  to  be  acceptable  as  a  pharmacodynamic  endpoint.  The  submitted 
studies,  according  to  the  SAG,  have  demonstrated  that  fampridine  had  a  small,  but  statistically 
significant effect on the speed of walking over a short distance. However, the majority of the SAG was 
concerned  that  a  significant  effect  across  the  broader  aspects  of  walking  has  not  been  shown,  which 
makes  the  test  unacceptable  as  a  clinically  relevant  outcome  measure.  The  SAG  also  expressed 
concerns  regarding  the  reliability  of  correlating  the  effect  on  walking  speed  with  other  walking 
parameters as a predictor of an overall treatment effect. Further, it was acknowledged that to be able 
to walk at a certain speed, motor and sensory function needs to be involved. However, walking speed 
does not provide information with regard to the quality of walking. There are several different aspects 
of  walking  that  can  be  affected  by  MS,  including  coordination,  balance  and  stamina.  Outcome 
measures  that  would  address  these  aspects  specifically  have  not  been  presented.  It  was  noted  that 
endurance  is  considered  by  patients  more  important  than  the  speed  to  bridge  a  short  distance,  as  it 
determines the range of action.   
The  view  of  the  SAG  is  supported  by  an  independent  multidisciplinary  consensus  conference  by  the 
Consortium of  Multiple  Sclerosis  Centres  (Hutchinson  et  al  2007).  The  aim  of  this  consensus  meeting 
was to determine the most appropriate outcome measures for gait and fatigue in people with MS.  In 
this consensus paper it is stated that gait is not a unitary entity but encompasses many independent 
and  interdependent  variables  and  a  single  measure  of  gait  would  not  suffice.  Thus,  in  this  paper  it is 
agreed that the T25FW is  useful, but as part of a test battery,  not as single item. In addition, it was 
recognised that gait disorder in MS is highly heterogeneous as it can occur for many different reasons. 
Hence,  the  extrapolation  of  results  based  on  the  T25FW  in  other  conditions  with  less  heterogeneous 
walking patterns was not justified, although the applicant argued that for Friedreich’s ataxia this might 
be different.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Clinical relevance of presented data 
In the pivotal studies, a statistically significant difference in responder rates was observed in favour of 
active treatment i.e. fampridine 10 mg b.i.d. The same held for study MS-F202 where this analysis was 
performed post hoc.  
Converting  walking  speed  into  seconds  to  bridge  a  25  feet  distance,  the  mean  at  endpoint  was  13.6 
seconds versus 13.0 seconds (placebo versus fampridine) in study MS-F202, 11.6 versus 10.8 seconds 
in study MS-F203 and 10.5 versus 10.2 seconds in study MS-F204. In the “within responder analysis”, 
results  were  only  slightly  better,    i.e.  the  average  number  of  seconds  to  bridge  25  feet  during  the 
double-blind phase was 11.7 seconds under placebo, 12.0 seconds for fampridine non-responders and 
9.8  seconds  for  fampridine  responders.  As  stated  above,  it  was  considered  of  greater  importance 
whether  this  speed  can  be  maintained  for  a  while,  increasing  the  range  of  action.    The  CHMP 
highlighted that this was not assessed by the applicant. 
For the main studies, a statistically significant difference in responder rates was observed in favour of 
active  treatment.  Pooling  the  results  of  studies  MS-F202/3/4,  the  responder  rates  were  8.9%  for  the 
placebo group versus 37.2% for the fampridine group (Difference 28.4%, CI95% 22.1%; 34.2%).  For 
the secondary endpoints, the mean changes from baseline in MSWS-12, LEMMT and Ashworth scores 
within the study groups were small, let alone the difference in change from baseline between the study 
groups,  although  statistical  significance  or  a  trend  to  statistical  significance  was  observed.  For  the 
Subject Global Impression and Clinician Global Impression there was no or  almost no shift in median 
indicating  that  the  improvement  might  not  be  perceived  as  substantial.  The  majority  of  subjects 
perceived no satisfaction or improvement, let alone a substantial improvement.  
Hence, the responder definition increases the sensitivity to show statistical significance, but the clinical 
significance  of  the  observed  effect  was  not  addressed  sufficiently.  The  CHMP  considered  the 
justification  of  the  responder  definition  by  the  applicant  unsatisfactory.  The  choice  of  consistency 
above incorporating the degree of improvement remained disputable. In agreement with this, the SAG 
considered  the  applicant’s  responder  definition  arbitrary,  in  that  it  was  not  defined  as  a  clinically 
relevant outcome of defined magnitude. It was pointed out by the SAG that tests such as the T25FW 
could  be  useful  for  monitoring  patients  in  everyday  clinical  practice,  but  it  has  not  been  shown  that 
improvement  in  responders,  defined  according  to  the  responder  definition  in  the  clinical  trials,  is  of 
general benefit for this group of MS patients.  
Analysis within responders 
The CHMP questioned the appropriateness of the “within responder analysis”, because a circular line of 
reasoning in establishing improvement in improvers was noted; responders are first defined based on a 
walking test (in terms of any improvement) then it is evaluated whether responders do better on the 
same  walking  test  (in  terms  of  walking  speed)  and  other  aspects  of  walking  function  (MSWS-12, 
LEMMT,  Ashworth  score).  This  approach  was  considered  to  be  self-fulfilling  and  was  not  considered  a 
validation of the responder definition. Hence, the overall analysis has been given more weight by the 
CHMP  than  the  within  responder  analysis.  In  their  response,  the  applicant  failed  to  demonstrate  that 
there  is  no  circular  argument.    Even  if  accepting  this  analysis,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  clinical 
relevance of the effect sizes in responders remained questionable.  
Clinical meaningfulness of 20% improvement in walking speed 
The  applicant  argued  that  a  20%  improvement  in  walking  speed  is  clinically  meaningful.  Overall,  the 
difference  in  proportion  of  >20%  responders  was  13%  versus  31%  for  placebo  and  fampridine, 
respectively.  
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 47/89
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  >20%  improvement  in  walking  speed  remained  questionable.  The 
analysis  presented  by  the  applicant  was  based  on  aggregated  data  instead  of  analysing  the  data  on 
individual  level,  i.e.  plotting  changes  in  walking  speed  to  changes  in  MSWS-12,  SGI  and  CGI  per 
patient. In the oral hearing these data were graphically presented as scatter plots. The plots showed a 
large variability and large overlap. There was no visual separation between placebo and fampridine. 
The CHMP noted that, even if the above aspect is disregarded, a 20% improvement translates into an 
average improvement of 2.08 seconds to bridge a 25 feet distance, i.e. from 12.5 seconds at baseline 
to  10.4  sec  under  treatment.  Such  small  improvement  may  be  of  relevance  if  one  is  able  to  walk 
longer  distances;  however,  data  supporting  assumption  that  the  speed  can  be  maintained  were  not 
available. The T25FW provides no information concerning quality of walking, maintenance of this speed 
over longer distances or endurance of walking.  
Based on the published literature the CHMP acknowledged that there is a relationship between walking 
speed  and  walking  distance.  However,  in  these  published  studies  the  range  of  walking  speed  or 
seconds to walk 25 feet evaluated was much larger than the range that was observed in studies MS-
F202/3/4. In fact, the observed walking speed in studies MS-F202/3/4 was in the outer lowest range 
where  this  relationship  collapses,  i.e.  the  range  of  walking  speed  that  does  not  affect  the  range  of 
action. 
Moreover,  the  difference  in  proportion  of  >20%  responders,  i.e.  13%  (placebo)  versus  31% 
(fampridine),  shifted  neither  the  overall  mean  scores  in  MSWS-12  nor  the  median  scores  of  SGI  and 
CGI. 
Regarding the MSWS-12, the relevance of the 6 point change in the MSWS-12 (as specified in a paper 
by Hobart 2010) was questioned by the CHMP. The paper referred to by the applicant was an abstract 
of  a  poster  presented  and  appeared  to  be  based  on  the  current  fampridine  studies  and  not  on 
independent  data.  In  addition,  it  was  stated  in  the  paper  that  a  change  of  >  6.9  points  is  clinically 
relevant, while the applicant presented 4.23-6.02 points.  
Regarding the SGI, the percentage of patients being satisfied by treatment was equal for subjects on 
placebo  and  fampridine,  i.e.  35%  in  study  MS-F203  and  26%  in  study  MS-F204.  If  the  difference  in 
proportion of >20% responder, i.e. 13% (placebo) versus 31% (fampridine) was considered clinically 
significant, it would be expected that these figures would have been different.  
Regarding the CGI, in study MS-F204 but not in study MS-F203 the proportion of patients with a shift 
in CGI category separated from placebo. However, this was inconsistent with the SGI that the clinician 
perceives an improvement that is not perceived at all as an improvement by the patient. 
As stated above the scatter plots presenting the percentage change in walking speed versus change in 
MS-F20-score,  CGI  and  SGI  categories  showed  a  large  variability  and  large  overlap  and  no  visual 
separation between placebo and fampridine study arm.  
In  summary,  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  on  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  20%  improvement  in  walking 
speed.  The  effect  on  walking  speed  was  not  perceived  as  a  relevant  and  consistent  improvement  by 
patient and physician.   
The CHMP concluded that the applicant was not able to link the improvement in walking speed, or 20% 
improvement  in  walking  speed  to  relevant  improvements  in  walking  function  (MSWS-12),  spasticity 
(Ashworth)  and  leg  weakness  (LEMMT)  and  SGI/CGI.  The  question  to  which  extent  walking  speed, 
especially  the  walking  speed  observed  in  the  studies,  represents  walking  ability,  walking  quality  and 
endurance, was not addressed sufficiently by the applicant. 
Maintenance of effect  
The  CHMP  noted  that  maintenance  of  effect  was  unclear,  although  at  treatment  cessation,  a  drop  in 
walking speed was observed. However, this was over a relatively short treatment period of a maximum 
of 14 weeks. The result presented was a within responder analysis, that is, the average percent change 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 48/89
 
 
 
 
 
in  walking  speed  over  time,  presented  for  responders  and  non-responders,  whereas  the  responder 
definition was based on the walking speed.  Thus, the analysis was not accepted by the CHMP. 
With regard to maintenance of effect there were two additional issues of concern. Firstly, the product 
had  minor  effect  on  walking  speed  in  about  one  third  of  the  exposed  subjects.  Following  review,  it 
remained  questioned  whether  this  minor  effect  is  clinically  relevant  as  discussed  above.    Secondly,  it 
remained  unclear  whether  the  decline  in  walking  speed  over  time  is  due  to  progression  of  disease  or 
lack of maintenance of effect. This would require periodical T25FW tests while off treatment. The long 
term efficacy assessments were insufficient in this respect.  
Supportive evidence for efficacy  
Supportive evidence for efficacy was scarce, i.e. a dose-response relationship, a plasma-concentration 
relationship, efficacy on sign/symptoms of other demyelinated areas were not observed.   
Progression  in  multiple  sclerosis  is  believed  to  be  due  to  an  increased  axonal  loss  and  damage. 
Apparently,  the  response  to  fampridine  was  not  influenced  by  MS  type,  duration  of  disease  and 
Expanded Disability Status Scale score. This was considered unexpected. An explanation for this could 
be that patients were selected based on walking function, i.e. they had sufficient amount of functional 
axons. Alternative explanations may be that the responder analysis (any improvement) masked larger 
improvements  observed  in  e.g.  RRMS  as  compared  to  SPMS  or  that  the  effect  was  too  small  for 
showing  such  differences.  Further  evaluation  by  the  applicant  reinforced  that  the  effect  of  fampridine 
was  similar  despite  differences  in  duration  of  disease,  EDSS  stage  or  MS-type.  However,  this  was 
regarded  not  as  a  strength  but  as  a  weakness  of  arguments,  i.e.  the  presence  of  such  effects  would 
have strengthened the concept of mechanism of action of fampridine. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary, there is a biological rationale for evaluating the usefulness of fampridine in symptomatic 
treatment in multiple sclerosis. In the pivotal studies, an effect was shown on walking speed indicating 
pharmacological activity. The key question, i.e. the clinical relevance of the effect observed for walking 
speed has not been demonstrated.  The applicant was not able to relate the effect on walking speed,    
or  20%  improvement  in  walking  speed  to  relevant  improvements  in  walking  function  (MSWS-12), 
spasticity  (Ashworth)  and  leg  weakness  (LEMMT)  and  SGI/CGI. The  question  to  which  extent  walking 
speed,  especially  the  walking  speed  as  observed  in  the  studies,  represents  walking  ability,  walking 
quality, endurance and range of action has not been addressed. Long term efficacy remained an issue 
of concern at the end of the review. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  1952  subjects  were  exposed  to  any  dose/formulation  of  fampridine  during  the  clinical 
development program of fampridine (46 pooled and 11 non-pooled studies).   
The overall safety of fampridine was evaluated in 57 clinical studies (total of 2282  subjects) with the 
use  of  different  doses,  strengths,  duration  and  formulations.  The  studies  were  performed  in  healthy 
volunteers, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), and Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
(GBS).  46  studies  were  included  in  an  integrated  pooled  data  analysis  (2144  subjects),  while  the 
remaining 11 studies were presented as non-pooled data (138 subjects). The non-pooled studies were 
open  label  cross-over  studies  in  non-patients  performed  in  the  early  stages  of  development  of  the

product and allowed no statistical analysis due to incomplete data. This was considered an indication of 
GCP deficiencies in the early development of the product.  
A  summary  of  subjects  exposed  to  fampridine  (prolonged-release  or  other  formulations)  and  placebo 
treatment  in  the  46  pooled  studies  is  presented  in  the  table  15  below.    A  total  of  652  subjects  were 
randomized to receive placebo and 1509 subjects received fampridine of any dose or formulation.

The  mean  dose  administered  to  the  SCI  patients  was  higher  (25  mg  b.i.d.)  as  compared  to  the  dose 
administered  to  MS  patients  (14  mg  b.i.d.).  The  safety  profile  of  fampridine  in  the  SCI  patient 
population  was  not  different  from  the  one  observed  in  MS  except  for  higher  incidence  related  to  the 
higher  dosing  of  fampridine.  Therefore,  the  current  safety  assessment  focused  on  the  indication 
applied for i.e. multiple sclerosis.  
With regard to gender distribution, the demographic characteristics of the MS patient population were 
representative  of  the  general  MS  population.    The  mean  age  was  higher  than  that  of  the  general  MS 
population,  since  the  proposed  indication  patients  had  to  have  walking  disability.  Of  note,  the  safety 
database  of  MS  subjects  included  only  5%  patients  older  than  65  years.  A  prior  history  of  seizure  or 
presence of epileptiform activity on a screening EEG was an exclusion criterion for most of the clinical 
studies  in  the  fampridine  development  program.  Patients  with  presence  of  significant  cardiovascular 
abnormalities  were  also  excluded  from  the  studies.  The  ethnic  distribution  of  the  studied  population 
(93% Caucasians) was considered acceptable for the purpose of an EU registration.  
In  the  summary  of  clinical  safety  the  applicant  focused  on  data  from  the  three  placebo-controlled 
studies MS-F202, MS-F203 and MS-F204. In addition, supporting safety data were presented from the 
fampridine-PR  10  mg  b.i.d  open-label  extension  studies  (MS-F202  EXT,  MS-F203  EXT  and  MS-F204 
EXT),  other  MS  studies,  12  SCI  studies,  and  14  non-patient  studies.  Exposure  data  with  cut-off  date 
August 2009 are presented in the table below.

Adverse events  
Safety data for the dose-finding study MS-F202 and the pooled  safety data for the 10 mg  b.i.d. over 
studies MS-F202, MS-F203 and MS-F204 were presented separately by the applicant.  
The overall incidence of treatment related AEs (TEAEs) and specific adverse events observed in study 
MS-F202 are presented in the table 17. There was an increased incidence of nervous system disorders, 
mainly  tremor  and  paresthesia.  A  high  incidence  of  asthenia  was  observed  already  in  the  10  mg 
fampridine group. 
This  data  set  indicated  that  some  AEs  might  be  dose-related,  such  as  infections  and  infestations,  in 
particular  the  urinary  tract  infections;  nervous  system  disorders,  particularly  headache,  paresthesia 
and  balance  disorders;  psychiatric  disorders  particularly  insomnia;  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders.

Severe TEAEs 
Overall, the incidence of severe TEAEs increased with increasing fampridine-PR doses (17.3%, 24.0% 
and  29.58%  respectively  in  10,  15,  and  20  mg)  versus  14.9%  in  the  placebo  group.  Outstanding 
severe AEs in the 10 mg group were diarrhoea (3.8%), asthenia (5.8%), fatigue (5.8%), UIT (1.9%) 
and falls/contusions (1.9%). Nervous system disorders showed a clear trend towards an increase with 
dose,  with  confusion,  balance  disorder,  confused  state,  convulsion,  coordination  abnormal,  headache, 
hypoesthesia, paresthesia, migraine, MS, transient ischemic attack particularly observed in the 20 mg 
dose group. This general trend that incidence of TEAEs increased with dose raised concerns particularly 
with respect to intentional or incidental overdose. 
In  the  pooled  data  (studies  MS-F202/203/204)  for  exposure  to  10  mg  there  were  more  events  of 
anxiety  (0.3%),  asthenia  (1.8%),  balance  disorder  (0.5%),  dizziness  (0.3%),  headache  (0.8%)  and 
UTI (1.0%) in the fampridine arm as compared to placebo. In this dataset, the incidence of paresthesia 
was similar in both groups – 0.4% in placebo vs 0.3% in fampridine 10 mg b.i.d. 
Treatment related AES  
Overall,  in  study  MS-F202  the  incidence  of  related  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  10  mg  b.i.d  treatment 
group  (42.3%)  as  compared  to  placebo  (36.2%)  and  increased  with  increasing  fampridine-PR  doses 
(48.0% and 54.4% at 15 mg b.i.d and 20 mg b.i.d, respectively).  
In  the  pooled  data  (studies  202/203/204)  for  10  mg  b.i.d.,  the  related  TEAEs  in  the  placebo  group 
were 21.4% vs 27.8% in the fampridine group. Adverse events which occurred more than twice more 
frequently in the fampridine group vs placebo were nausea (3.3% vs 1.3%), asthenia (2.8% vs 1.3%), 
balance disorder (2.3% vs 0.4%), headache (2.8% vs 0.8%), and paresthesia (2.8% vs 0.8%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The  overall  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  in  study  MS-F202  showed  a  dose-response  relationship  with 
reported  incidences  of  4.3%  (placebo),  0.0%  (10  mg  b.i.d),  8.0%  (15  mg  b.i.d)  and  12.3%  (20  mg 
b.i.d).  The  majority  of  reported  serious  TEAEs  were  in  the  Nervous  System  Disorders  SOC  and  all 
showed dose-dependency (0%, 4.0%, 10.5% in the 10, 15 and 20 mg groups respectively versus 0% 
in placebo).   
In  studies  MS-F202/203/204,  the  overall  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  was  higher  in  the  fampridine-PR 
treatment  group  (5.5%)  than  in  the  placebo  treatment  group  (2.1%).  More  serious  TEAEs  in  the 
fampridine-PR treatment group compared to placebo were registered in the Infections and Infestations  
SOC (2.3% vs 0.8%), e.g. bacterial pyelonephritis, influenza, pneumonia, sepsis, UTI, viral and wound

infection;    Nervous  System  Disorders  SOC  and  Injury,  Poisoning  and  Procedural  Complications  SOC, 
while no clear or significant differences were observed in the remaining SOCs.  
Cardiac  disorders  were  slightly  higher  in  the  fampridine-PR  group  (3.0%)  compared  to  the  placebo 
group  (1.3%).  There  was  one  case  with  chest  pain  (0.3%)  and  one  with  coronary  artery  disease 
(0.3%)  in  the  fampridine  group;  in  the  placebo,  one  myocardial  infarction  (0.4%)  was  reported.  
Bundle  branch  block,  tachycardia,  and  palpitations  were  all  reported  slightly  more  often  with 
fampridine PR compared to placebo (data from 10 mg b.i.d. studies MS-F202/203/204). 
There  were  no  suicide  ideations  or  events  in  the  short  term  studies  and  there  were  four  in  the 
extension  studies:  two  completed  suicides,  one  attempt  and  one  ideation.  In  view  of  the  generally 
increased risk of suicidal ideations and completed suicides in the MS patient population, no conclusion 
could  be  drawn  whether  the  treatment  with  fampridine  10  mg  b.i.d.  is  associated  with  increased 
incidence of suicidal ideations and events.  
Deaths 
During the clinical programme a total of eight deaths were reported, all occurring during the open-label 
extension  studies  (MS-F202  EXT,  MS-F203  EXT,  and  MS-F204  EXT).  These  included  seven  patients 
receiving  fampridine-PR  at  10  mg  b.i.d  and  one  patient  receiving  a  dose  of  15  mg  b.i.d  (before  dose 
titration  to  10  mg  b.i.d).  One  death  occurred  five  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication 
(patient taking part in the study MS-F203). 
The 8 cases reported during the extension studies occurred in 4 male patients and 4 female patients. 
Causes of death included two suicides and one accidental oxycodone toxicity,  two cases of intracranial 
haemorrhage,  one  in  a  patient  with  brain  aneurysm,    one  case  of  ruptured  aorta,      one  case  of 
coronary heart disease and  one case with unknown cause of death. 
All  8  cases  were  considered  unrelated  to  the  fampridine  treatment  by  the  investigator.  However,  at 
least in two cases (unknown cause of death and coronary heart disease) the contribution of fampridine 
to cardiac events could not be excluded. In addition, contribution of fampridine to the depressive mood 
followed by suicide could not be excluded in the two reported cases.  
Safety  data  from  the  long  term  extension  MS  studies  MS-F202EXT,  MS-F203EXT,  MS-
F204EXT 
In the open-label MS studies (MS-F202 EXT, MS-F203 EXT, and MS-F204 EXT), 660 patients began or 
continued  treatment  with  fampridine-PR;    464  of  660  patients  remained  on  treatment  at  the  time  of 
data  cut-off  (i.e.  30  November  2008).  From  March  2005,  all  patients  were  being  treated  with  the  10 
mg  b.i.d.  fampridine-PR,  while  prior  to  that  date,  some  of  the  patients  received  15  mg  b.i.d  (175 
patients) or 20 mg b.i.d (10 patients).   
TEAEs  had  the  highest  incidence  in  the  first  six  months  of  treatment  (83.0%)  and  then  levelled  off 
between 6 and 54 months of treatment (range: 40.3% to 67.3%). The incidence of serious TEAEs was 
in  the  range  of  1.6%  to  9.6%.    The  incidence  of  severe  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  was 
also highest during the first six months and lower in the subsequent treatment periods. 
Events  of  nausea,  asthenia,  back  pain,  headache,  dizziness  and  insomnia  occurred  at  their  highest 
incidence during the first six months. In comparison to incidences in the first six months of treatment 
(range: 5.3% to 10.9%), these TEAEs were reported at very low levels after 6 months (range: 0.9 to 
5.7%), with no further reports after 54 months of treatment.  
The  higher  incidence  of  TEAEs  in  the  first  6  months  and  its  decline  later  could  be  due  to  several 
reasons: discontinuation of patients with AEs in the first months, patients not reporting AEs repeatedly 
as they get used to the AE, and AEs disappearing.  
ASSESSMENT REPORT

The  TEAEs  of  urinary  tract  infection  remained  relatively  consistent  irrespective  of  the  duration  of 
treatment,  with  exceptions  for  period  30-36  months  and  54-60  months,  with  incidences  of  5.2%  and 
1.8%, respectively.  
Thirty-four cases of serious TEAEs were reported, which included massive pulmonary saddle embolus, 
active tuberculosis, splenic rupture, septic shock, acute renal failure, overdose (accidental) and suicide.  
Cardiovascular  disorders  were  seen  in  2%  of  the  patients  in  the  first  6  months,  then  this  percentage 
was  lower  with  another  peak  of  2.1%  for  >24-30  months  and  2.9%  for  >42-48  months.  Since  the 
number  of  subjects  is  decreasing  with  time,  these  percentages  were  not  interpreted  as  absolute 
measures of incidence, but as a signal that cardiac events are persistently observed adverse events in 
patients on long term treatment with fampridine. 
There  were  no  major  differences  in  the  clinically  significant  ECG  findings  between  placebo  and 
fampridine treated patients, although it was noted that not all patients had an ECG assessment. Pulse 
rate  was  measured  in  few  patients;  therefore,  no  conclusions  could  be  drawn  for  this  parameter. 
Fluctuations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in about one third of the patients, 
with similar proportions in the placebo and fampridine group.  
Peripheral oedema was observed also in patients treated for longer time (i.e. 4.3% in >36-48 months). 
No temporal relation between oedema and heart failure, renal impairment or electrolyte imbalance was 
found.  
In  study  MS-F202  EXT,  two  patients  receiving  >  10  mg  fampridine  b.i.d.  and  one  patient  on  10  mg 
b.i.d.  had  a  seizure.  In  Study  MS-F203  EXT  four  patients  experienced  a  seizure  and  there  were  no 
cases in MS-F204 EXT. Of the five patients (one male and four females) with any type of seizure while 
treated with fampridine-PR 10 mg b.i.d, four experienced generalized seizures and one patient a partial 
complex seizure.  The seizures could be attributed to the use of tolterodine or to the concomitant use 
of  tolterodine  with  fampridine  in  one  patient,  since  tolterodine  is  known  to  block  K+  channels  and 
increase the duration of the action potential.  
Furthermore, gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation, diarrhoea and nausea, as well as fatigue 
and asthenia were relatively prominent in the first six months.  
Infections and infestations were observed with high incidence (mainly upper respiratory tract infections 
and  particularly  urinary  tract  infections).  In  the  long  term  open  label  studies  it  was  difficult  to 
distinguish the proportion of AEs related to the treatment and the AEs related to the disease itself. In 
any case the high incidence of infections was considered to represent an additional risk factor for the 
MS patient population and was reflected in the final benefit/risk balance.  
Injuries and particularly falls were relatively frequent, suggesting that these events may be related to 
the  AEs  in  the  nervous  system  such  as  dizziness,  balance  disorder  and  abnormal  sensory  feedback, 
which  were  frequent  as  well.  Other  AEs  related  to  the  nervous  system  were  paraesthesia,  tremor, 
hypoesthesia and headache. There was a decrease in the incidence of these AEs with time. Given the 
mechanism of action of fampridine, this was considered due to the fact that patients got used to these 
AEs and did not report them any more rather than due to a real decrease in these AEs with time. 
Insomnia appeared to be frequent in the first six months of treatment, but was less reported later.  
Laboratory findings 
The percentage of MS patients with clinically significant haematology values was ≤13.6%. Changes in 
haematology  parameters  were  consistently  observed  both  in  short  term  and  long  term  in  fampridine 
patients:  low  haematocrit  (6.6%),  low  haemoglobin  (4.0%),  low  lymphocytes  (5.2%)  and  low  white 
blood cells (3.4%). No data on erythrocyte counts were available.  
The  comparison  of  low  white  cell  blood  counts  and  lymphocytopenia  between  fampridine  (any  dose) 
and  placebo  only  from  the  controlled  studies  indicated  a  greater  %  of  cases  in  the  fampridine  group 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 57/89
 
 
 
(4.5% vs 2.2% lymphopenia for fampridine vs placebo). On the basis of the presented data it was not 
possible to exclude the effect of fampridine on haematopoiesis.  
A  slightly  higher  incidence  of  elevated  levels  of  bilirubin  was  observed  in  the  fampridine  treated 
patients.  The  laboratory  results  for  these  subjects  did  not  show  concurrently  elevated  levels  of 
transaminases. Thus, the data did not indicate liver toxicity in subjects exposed to fampridine 10 mg 
b.i.d. in the MS studies.

A comparison of the incidence of AEs in fampridine treated patients with and without renal impairment, 
indicated an increased frequency of AEs in the group with abnormal renal function: ear and labyrinth 
disorders  (1.3%  vs  3.5%);  eye  disorders  (3.5%  vs  8.1%);  infections  and  infestations  (33.1%  vs 
43%); nervous system disorders (29.6% vs 43%); psychiatric disorders (11.8% vs 18.6%) and renal 
and urinary disorders (6.1% vs 9.3%).  
This is an indication that fampridine, being a drug with narrow therapeutic window, cannot be applied 
safely  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  The  proposed  dose  of  10  mg  b.i.d.  does  not  give  room  for 
dose adjustment if necessary.   
Paediatric population 
Fampridine was granted a full product-specific waiver.  
Elderly 
The number of elderly patients included in the short term studies was rather low – 11 in the placebo 
and 18 in the fampridine group. Since fampridine is eliminated from the body via the kidneys, due to 
the physiological reduction in renal function with age, elderly patients might be exposed effectively to a 
much  higher  dose  of  fampridine  and  therefore  be  exposed  to  more  risks.  Moreover,  the 
pharmacodynamics in the elderly might be different due to different sensitivity to CNS adverse events.  
Due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects,  no  firm  conclusions  could  be  drawn  whether  AEs  increase  with 
age.  However  in  the  10  mg  fampridine  subgroup  of  patients  ≥65  years,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was 
rather high (78.3%). 
Concomitant immunomodulating therapy 
No  immunological  events  have  been  discussed  by  the  applicant.  A  comparison  of  patients  receiving 
concomitant immunomodulating therapy with patients without showed that more AEs were observed in 
the group without immunomodulating treatment and those events seemed to be related to fampridine, 
i.e. in the domains of CNS and psychiatry. In the subsequent subgroup analysis, concomitant therapy 
with  immunomodulators  did  not  seem  to  increase  the  risk  of  adverse  events  in  the  categories  Blood 
and lymphatic system disorders and Infections and infestations. 
However, both fampridine groups (with and without concomitant immunomodulatory therapy) showed 
higher  percentage  of  AEs  than  placebo  (with  the  concomitant  treatment).  Therefore,  there  is  an 
indication that fampridine itself might have an effect on the immune system leading to leucopenia and 
infections.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug interactions with other commonly used drugs in MS (interferon beta and baclofen) were studied 
without observing negative impact on the AE profile or frequency of AE reports. During the fampridine

PR  clinical  programme,  concomitant  use  of  routinely  prescribed  MS  drugs  was  allowed.  The  most 
commonly  used  concomitant  medications,  by  therapeutic  class,  in  fampridine-treated  patients  in 
placebo-controlled  studies  MS-F202/203/204  were  nervous  system  (86.2%),  musculoskeletal  system 
(78.3%),  alimentary  tract  and  metabolism  (71.2%),  antineoplastic  and  immunomodulating  agents 
(68.6%), and genitourinary system and sex hormones (58.2%). There were no consistent differences 
in  AEs  reported  by  patients  taking  concomitant  medications  versus  not  taking  concomitant 
medications. 
Given the mechanism of action of fampridine, the risk of fampridine interactions with anti-epileptic and 
anti-arrhythmic agents could not be excluded. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the dose finding study MS-F202 a total of seven patients (one patient in the placebo group and six 
patients  in  the  fampridine-PR  treatment  groups)  withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  AEs.  The  overall 
incidence was highest in patients receiving fampridine-PR 20 mg b.i.d. (8.8% vs 2.1% in the placebo).  
The  majority  of  TEAEs  leading  to  withdrawal  were  in  the  Nervous  System  Disorders  SOC  (balance 
disorder  1.8%,  complex  partial  seizures  and  convulsions  –  1.8%  each),  abnormal  coordination  3.5%, 
headache 3.5%, paresthesia 1.8%). 
In  the  pooled  data  for  10  mg  b.i.d.  from  studies  MS-F202/203/204  there  were  2.8%  of  patients 
withdrawing  due  to  AEs,  versus  2.1%  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  most  prominent  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal  were  infections  (pneumonia  0.3%,  sepsis  0.3%),  CNS  disorders  (balance  disorder  0.5%, 
dizziness 0.5%, headache 0.5%) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety 0.3%, confusional state 0.3%).  
Post-marketing experience 
During  the  oral  explanation  post-marketing  safety  data  (USA)  with  respect  to  seizure  risk  were 
submitted. The data were considered insufficient for an assessment of seizure risk. No other additional 
post-marketing safety data were submitted. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure 
The overall evaluation of the safety of exposure to fampridine is based on the data presented from the 
application  of  the  product  in  57  clinical  studies,  where  different  doses,  strengths,  duration  and 
formulations  have  been  used.  These  studies  have  been  performed  in  healthy  volunteers,  in  patients 
with multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).  
The main source of safety information are three placebo-controlled studies MS-F202, MS-F203 and MS-
F204 performed in MS patients and with the use of the PR formulation. This was completed with some 
preliminary data from the ongoing extension studies and from studies in SCI patients.  
The  majority  of  studies  have  been  included  in  an  integrated  pooled  data  analysis,  so  the  missing 
statistical analysis of the remaining 11 studies was not considered as critical for obtaining the overall 
picture about the safety profile of the drug.  
Mechanism of action 
Given  the  mechanism  of  action,  i.e.  blocking  K+  channels,  fampridine  should  be  considered  a  narrow 
therapeutic  index  drug,  unless  proven  otherwise.  Positive  arguments  for  a  narrow  therapeutic  index 
were  AEs  and  CNS-AEs  related  to  higher  C max  and  AUC  of  fampridine  as  observed  in  the  PK  studies, 
which was a reason for developing the prolonged-release formulation. In addition, the main elimination 
route  of  fampridine  was  renal  excretion  and  active  secretion.  An  increased  frequency  of  AEs  was 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 59/89
 
 
 
 
observed  in  the  patients  with  abnormal  renal  function  as  compared  to  normal  renal  function.  The 
applicant  did  not  challenge  that  fampridine  should  not  be  considered  as  a  narrow  therapeutic  index 
drug.  
Special populations 
Related to the mechanism of action of fampridine effects on the cardiovascular system were predicted. 
The  incidence  observed  in  the  short  term  studies  did  not  confirm  these  expectations.  However,  since 
patients  with  cardiovascular  disorders  were  excluded  from  the  studies,  the  safety  data  in  the  dossier 
were not considered to reflect the real risk for the total patient population. In response to the request 
for additional information, the applicant stated that no increase in cardiovascular events was observed 
in the unselected patient population after the marketing in the USA. 
Furthermore, the applicant stated that there was no temporal effect of exposure to fampridine, since in 
the exposure period between day 1 and 98 in the controlled studies, there were only 4 cardiac events 
not  related  to  the  drug.  The  definition  of  serious  cardiovascular  events  as  proposed  by  the  applicant 
included  only  cardiomyopathy,  coronary  heart  disease  and  ventricular  hypertrophy,  which  logically 
would  not  be  considered  as  related  to  treatment  by  the  investigator.  The  applicant  has  not  provided 
arguments why arrhythmias and conduct disorders were not considered to  be serious cardiac events, 
while it is well known that such AEs could lead to a fatal outcome.  
Further, additional data from the QTc study provided by the applicant did not make it clear whether the 
study performed was sensitive to evaluate QTc changes as the response in the moxifloxacine arm was 
unexpectedly low. 
Despite  the  exclusion  of  subjects  with  cardiac  symptoms  from  the  short  term  placebo  controlled 
studies,  it  appeared  that  about  40%  of  the  subjects  included  had  cardiac  symptoms  reported  at 
baseline.  These  data  were  not  considered  sufficient  for  confirming  or  rejecting  the  concerns  about 
cardiac  safety.  The  range  of  seriousness  of  this  co-morbid  condition  remained  unclear.  In  principle, 
patients  with  major  cardiovascular  diseases  have  been  excluded  from  the  trials  and  for  these,  an 
altered sensitivity of K+ channels cannot be excluded. 
The  proposal  of  the  applicant  to  monitor  cardiac  safety  in  an  observational  study  was  not  considered 
sufficient.    From  the  description  provided,  it  was  not  clear  whether  this  study  would  be  suitable  to 
study  cardiovascular  adverse  events,  especially  those  related  to  potential  QT  prolongation,  QT 
shortening and conduction disorders.  
The  proposal  of  the  applicant  to  register  cardiac  events  in  the  post  marketing  phase  was  not 
considered  sufficient,  either.  In  the  dossier,  patients  with  cardiovascular  disease  were  excluded  from 
the  studies,  therefore  the  true  magnitude  of  the  cardiovascular  risk  could  not  be  estimated  from  the 
short term safety data and the long term data were insufficient.  
Another concern was related to the elderly patients with MS. Very few elderly patients were included in 
the studies, so the data available were insufficient to judge the safety in this population. Two aspects 
were  considered  in  this  context.  Firstly,  the  physiologically  decreased  renal  function  in  the  elderly 
means that these patients might be exposed to higher Cmax and AUC, leading to increased risk of AEs. 
Secondly, in general the elderly are more sensitive to CNS adverse events. It is not known whether the 
pharmacodynamics of fampridine is different in the elderly due to different quantitative and qualitative 
distribution  or  response  of  the  K+  channels  in  the  CNS  and  elsewhere.  The  lack  of  alternative  dose 
regimens was considered a deficiency of the dossier.    
Specific adverse events 
Based  on  the  mechanism  of  action,  an  increased  risk  of  seizures  is  expected.  In  general,  the  seizure 
risk  increased  with  dose  and  was  not  much  higher  than  placebo  in  the  10  mg  b.i.d.  dosing  of 
fampridine. However, the patients included in the studies were not completely representative of the MS 
patient  population,  since  subjects  with  history  of  seizures  or  increased  epileptiform  activity  on  a 
screening EEG were excluded. Due to the disease itself, MS patients have an increased risk of seizures 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 60/89
 
 
 
and therefore, the safety of fampridine in seizure susceptible subjects might be different.  In addition, 
because of the relatively narrow therapeutic window of fampridine and almost complete renal clearance 
of the product, the risk of seizures might also be increased in patients taking the recommended dose 
of 10 mg b.i.d., but who present with mild renal impairment due to the disease or in the elderly, where 
renal function is physiologically decreased. 
Further,  an  increased  frequency  of  UTI,  respiratory  tract  infections  and  constipation  was  observed  in 
the fampridine arm.  This raised several questions, in particular with respect to the effect of fampridine 
on the motility of the urogenital, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and its effect on haematopoiesis 
and immunological response. 
The applicant did not provide sufficient evidence as to whether fampridine could have an influence on 
the  motility  of  the  urogenital,  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  tract.  There  seemed  to  be  dose- 
dependent increase in constipation, dyspnoea and UTI. The applicant claimed that the UTI cases were 
not  real  infections,  because  they  were  not  confirmed  by  cultures.  Since  very  few  cases  of  UTI  were 
tested  with  urine  cultures,  this  statement  was  not  supported  with  evidence.  Moreover,  if  the  UTI 
symptoms were due to the direct and indirect neurological effect of fampridine on bladder motility, as 
stated  by  the  applicant,  this  would  suggest  that  fampridine  does  have  an  effect  on  motility.  In 
conclusion, the question about the effect of fampridine on motility was not addressed sufficiently.  
A compromised immune response may form an alternative explanation for the differences in infection 
rates. The applicant commented on publications, where some authors suggested that fampridine may 
modulate the immune response and inhibit T-cell proliferation by blocking 4-AP-sensitive Kv channels 
expressed in lymphocytes. In animal studies, fampridine treatment did not induce experimental allergic 
encephalitis  in  rats  and  therefore  it  was  concluded  by  the  applicant  that  the  clinical  effects  of 
fampridine  on  MS  patients  at  therapeutic  doses  are  not  mediated  through  effects  on  the  immune 
system and that fampridine is unlikely to increase the risk of infection through effects on T-cells. The 
applicant’s responses were considered incomplete and an effect of fampridine on haematopoiesis could 
not  be  excluded.  Hence,  it  seemed  that  fampridine  as  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with 
immunomodulators  was  related  to  increase  in  infections  of  various  types.  Moreover,  whether  the  UTI 
symptoms are based on an infection or not, these are considered severe inconvenient events. 
There  was  an  indication  of  overstimulation  of  the  sensory  nerves,  expressed  in  increase  in  events  of 
dizziness, balance disorder, paraesthesia, pain, suggesting an abnormal sensory feedback which might 
also  be  the  reason  for  the  increased  incidence  of  falls  and  injuries.  For  better  interpretation  of  these 
safety  results,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  a  separate  analysis  of  AEs  related  to  the  sensory 
nerves. This additional analysis did not show relation between coordination disorders and falls/injuries. 
However,  the  approach  of  the  applicant  to  combine  all  AEs  suggesting  stimulation  of  the  sensory 
nerves  and  compare  the  combined  percentages  between  fampridine  10  mg  b.i.d.  and  placebo  arms 
was not appropriate and therefore the applicant’s conclusions were not considered convincing. In any 
case,  the  exposure  to  10  mg  BID  fampridine  was  related  to  increased  incidence  of  nervous  system 
AEs;  in  particular  pain,  paraesthesia  and  dysaesthesia,  abnormal  coordination  with  balance 
disturbance,  and  sensory  abnormalities  were  observed  more  frequently.  The  applicant  argued  that 
most  of  these  events  were  transient  i.e.  lasting  less  than  8  weeks.    The  events  were  apparently 
partially  transient,  but  it  is  not  clear  whether  patients  may  get  used  to  them.  In  a  substantial 
proportion of patients these events persisted. Moreover, considering the efficacy, the CHMP questioned 
whether  the  increased  percentage  of  events,  even  if  transient  e.g.  persisting  for  0-4  weeks  or  4-8 
weeks,  is  acceptable.  These  aspects  were  taken  into  consideration  in  the  overall  benefit/  risk 
assessment.  
There were  more reports of multiple sclerosis relapse in the fampridine treated patients as compared 
to  placebo.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  some  of  these  exacerbations  might  have  been 
misclassified, meaning that symptoms of over-stimulation of the sensory nerves (pain, paraesthesias, 
etc.) could have been defined as exacerbation of MS, while in fact these were adverse events related 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 61/89
 
 
 
to the treatment with fampridine.  In addition, the incidence of MS in the long term open label study 
was  compared  to  the  background  rates,  but  such  historical  comparisons  have  several  deficiencies. 
Overall,  the  applicant  did  not  provide  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude  on  whether  fampridine  does  or 
does not worsen MS related symptoms. In light of uncertainties on treatment duration, the recurrence 
of MS symptoms remained an important issue in the benefit/risk assessment.  
A higher incidence of anxiety, depressive mood and insomnia was observed in the fampridine treated 
patients.  While  for  the  depressive  events  and  the  suicide  events  it  is  rather  difficult  to  judge  if  these 
were  related  to  the  fampridine  treatment  or  to  the  MS  itself,  the  signals  of  increased  anxiety  and 
insomnia were easier to distinguish. This might present a serious problem in the long run, as the drug 
was intended for a chronic administration. 
Long-term safety 
The data regarding long term safety were considered insufficient by the CHMP. Although the statement 
that no serious adverse events were reported appeared reassuring, lack of details was pointed out by 
the  CHMP.  The  withdrawal  rate  of  35  %  (lost  to  follow-up,  non-compliance,  consent  withdrawal  etc.) 
was considered substantial and was indicative of underlying motives that suggest the benefit/risk is not 
persisting.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of fampridine poses some serious concerns related mainly to the fact that the drug 
appears  to  have  a  narrow  therapeutic  window  and  CNS  AEs  increase  with  relatively  small  increase  in 
exposure.  In  the  dossier  the  applicant  proposed  only  one  dose  regimen,  which  might  prove 
unfavourable  for  a  major  part  of  the  MS  patient  population,  such  as  renally  impaired  patients,  the 
elderly,  or  in  cases  of  increased  dose  intake.  Moreover,  the  safe  use  in  patients  at  risk  of  seizures 
including  epileptic  patients  and  with  cardiac  co-morbidity  remains  unknown,  as  these  patients  were 
excluded  from  the  studies.  The  magnitude  of  the  cardiovascular  risk  could  not  be  estimated.  In 
addition,  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  with  UTI  and  other  infections  remains  unknown,  since  most 
patients  with  infections  (UTI  and  other)  were  treated  symptomatically,  but  no  bacteriological  tests 
were performed to confirm or reject the diagnosis.    
Major  safety  concerns  are  related  to  the  increased  risk  of  seizures,  infections  (particularly  UTIs), 
anxiety and insomnia, and of symptoms of abnormal sensory feedback interfering with walking ability. 
Long-term  safety  data  did  not  allow  an  assessment  of  long  term  safety.  In  the  elderly  population, 
generally sensitive to CNS adverse events, the safety remains unclear.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements  as  described  in  Volume  9A  of  the  Rules  Governing  Medicinal  Products  in  the  European 
Union  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a  qualified  person 
responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the 
application was of the opinion that it was not appropriate to consider risk minimisation activities at this 
time. 
User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
In  the  clinical  studies  MS-F202/203/204,  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  responders  was 
observed.  The  results  of  the  three  studies  were  similar,  overall  the  responder  rate  was  8.9%  for  the 
placebo group versus 37.2% for the fampridine group (difference 28.4%, CI95% 22.1%; 34.2%).  The 
responder  definition  was  based  on  the  walking  speed  assessed  in  the  Timed  25  feet  walking  test 
(T25FW), i.e. the time in seconds it takes to walk 25 feet. A responder was defined as a patient with a 
faster walking speed for at least three visits during the double-blind treatment period as compared to 
the  maximum  speed  for  any  of  the  off-treatment  visits.  Overall  efficacy  in  terms  of  responders 
appeared homogenous across subgroups identified. Also the difference in proportion of subjects with a 
20% improvement in walking speed i.e. 13% versus 31% for placebo and fampridine was statistically 
significant.  
In  the  main  studies  MS-F203/204,  the  differences  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  walking 
questionnaire, muscle strength and spasticity were either statistically significant or showed a trend in 
favour of fampridine.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  fampridine  is  linear;  fampridine  is  absorbed  in  a  dose  proportional  manner 
and  there  is  no  accumulation  after  repeated  doses.  Moreover,  it  is  unbound  to  plasma  proteins  and 
almost  completely  eliminated  via  urinary  excretion.  The  major  fraction  recovered  was  contributed  to 
the parent drug.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The main uncertainties concern the value of the Timed 25 Foot Walk test and value of the responder 
definition  derived  from  it,  as  no  experience  exists  in  the  evaluation  of  treatments  for  symptomatic 
treatment in multiple sclerosis so far. Further, the clinical meaningfulness of the observed statistically 
significant differences has not been established. 
The  Timed  25  feet  walking  test  (T25FW)  in  essence  measures  the  speed  of  walking.  The  T25FW  is 
considered  more  a  pharmacodynamic  endpoint  rather  than  a  clinically  relevant  outcome.  The 
submitted  studies  have  demonstrated  the  proof  of  concept,  i.e.  that  fampridine  has  a  small,  but 
statistically  significant  effect  on  the  speed  of  walking  over  a  short  distance.  The  significance  across 
broader  aspects  of  walking  has  not  been  shown,  which  makes  the  test  unacceptable  as  a  clinically 
relevant outcome measure. The use of walking speed as a surrogate of walking ability is uncertain.  
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 63/89
 
 
 
The  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  observed  is  highly  uncertain.    Any  improvement  in  the  speed  of 
walking over a short distance is hard to interpret in terms of clinical relevance.  As stated above more 
important  is  whether  speed  can  be  maintained  for  a  while,  increasing  the  range  of  action.  For  the 
secondary  endpoints,  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  MSWS-12,  LEMMT  and  Ashworth  scores 
within  the  study  groups  were  small,  let  alone  the  differences  in  change  from  baseline  between  the 
study  groups,  although  statistical  significance  or  a  trend  to  statistical  significance  was  observed.  For 
the Subject Global Impression and Clinician Global Impression there is no or almost no shift in median 
indicating  that  the  improvement  might  not  be  perceived  as  substantial.  The  majority  of  subjects 
perceived  no  satisfaction  or  improvement  let  alone  a  substantial  improvement.  This  confirms  the 
picture that emerges from the scatter plots presented by the applicant at the oral hearing. The change 
in walking speed versus the MSWS-12 score, CGI and SGI categories showed a large overlap. Visually 
there was no separation between the placebo and fampridine study arm. 
In agreement with this, the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) concluded that a significant effect across 
the broader aspects of walking has not been shown, which makes the test unacceptable as a clinically 
relevant  outcome  measure.  Walking  speed  does  not  provide  information with  regard  to  the  quality  of 
walking.  There  are  several  different  aspects  of  walking  that  can  be  affected  by  MS,  including 
coordination, balance and stamina. Outcome measures that address these aspects specifically have not 
been  presented.  It  was  noted  that  patients  consider  endurance  as  more  important  than  the  speed  to 
bridge a short distance, as this determines the range of action. 
Based on the literature submitted the range of walking speeds observed in the fampridine studies does 
not affect the range of action.   
The  applicant  has  argued  that  a  20%  improvement  in  walking  speed,  as  measured  by  the  T25FW, 
results in clinically relevant changes in the clinical outcome. This was questioned by the CHMP, as the 
difference in proportion of a 20% responder, i.e. 13% (placebo) versus 31% (fampridine) did neither 
shift  the  overall  mean  scores  in  MSWS-12  nor  the  median  scores  of  SGI  and  CGI.  Regarding  the 
MSWS-12, the validation of the 6 point change in the MSWS-12 as defined was questioned as the data 
were limited (based on a poster) and not based on independent studies. Importantly, the percentage 
of patients being satisfied by treatment was equal for subjects on placebo and fampridine i.e. 35% in 
study MS-F203 and 26% in study MS-F204. If the difference in proportion of 20% responder, i.e. 13% 
(placebo)  versus  31%  (fampridine)  was  considered  clinically  significant,  it  would  be  expected  that 
these figures would be different.  Regarding the CGI, in study MS-F204 but not in study MS-F203, the 
proportion  of  patients  with  a  shift  in  CGI  category  separated  from  placebo.  However,  this  was 
inconsistent with the SGI that the clinician perceives an improvement that is not perceived at all as an 
improvement by the patient (SGI). 
The  applicant  suggested  identifying  responders  and  continuing  treatment  only  in  responders  and 
proposed a treatment algorithm in the SmPC. However, no conclusion could be drawn with respect to 
the clinical relevance of the 20% improvement in walking speed as stated above. Although responder 
definitions  are  inherently  arbitrary,  it  has  not  been  shown  that  improvement  in  responders,    either 
defined according to the responder definition in the clinical trials or defined as 20% improvement, is of 
general  benefit  for  this  group  of  MS  patients.  Hence,  the  suggestion  by  the  applicant  to  resolve  the 
issue in the SmPC was not considered acceptable. 
Supportive  evidence  for  efficacy  was  scarce,  e.g.  PD  studies  (electrophysiological  studies),  a  dose-
response  relationship,  a  plasma-concentration  relationship,  efficacy  on  sign/symptoms  of  other 
demyelinated  areas,  was  not  observed.    Further,  the  effect  of  fampridine  was  similar  despite  large 
differences in duration of disease, EDSS stage or MS-type.  
Maintenance  of  effect  remains  unclear.  The  observed  decline  in  effect  may  be  attributed  to  disease 
progression or lack of effect or both. This has not been evaluated appropriately by the applicant.

Hence,  it  remains  uncertain  to  which  extent  improvement  in  walking  speed,  and  particularly  the 
walking  speed  as  observed  in  the  studies,  is  indeed  a  benefit  for  the  patient  with  respect  to  walking 
ability, walking quality, endurance and increase in range of action. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Fampridine is a selective potassium channel blocker, which acts on subtypes of K channels expressed 
in  excitable  cells  such  as  neurons,  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle,  smooth  muscle  and  lymphocytes. 
Hence,  effects  of  fampridine  in  these  tissues  could  be  expected  and  this  has  been  addressed 
correspondingly in the safety questions posed to the applicant. Given this mechanism of action and the 
PK  data  so  far,  fampridine  should  be  considered  as  a  narrow  therapeutic  index  drug,  unless  proven 
otherwise.  
In  the  PK-PD  models  AEs  and  CNS-AEs  were  related  to  higher  Cmax  and  AUC  of  fampridine.  This  was 
confirmed in the clinical studies, i.e. an increased frequency of AEs was observed in the patients with 
abnormal  renal  function  as  compared  to  normal  renal  function.  Hence,  the  safe  use  in  patients  with 
mild renal impairment was questioned by the CHMP. This highlights drawback of having just one dose 
strength of 10 mg, which limits dosing flexibility and poses problems in patients with renal impairment 
including the elderly. The MAH could not justify a safe dose in the elderly.  
Identified  risks  concern  possible  coordination  abnormalities,  anxiety,  depressive  mood,  insomnia  and 
an increased risk for infections.  
A  prominent  signal  is  the  higher  incidence  of  dizziness,  pain  of  various  types,  paraesthesia,  balance, 
coordination  disorders  and  falls,  which  all  indicate  a  possible  over-stimulation  of  the  afferent  nerve 
tracts, i.e. an abnormal sensory feedback affecting motor coordination. Related to this is the excess of 
MS  symptoms  and  MS  relapses  in  the  fampridine  group  which  might  include  misclassifications  of 
symptoms  of  over-stimulation  of  the  sensory  fibres.  Although  most  of  these  events  were  apparently 
transient,  as  patients  may  get  used  to  them,  in  a  substantial  proportion  of  patients  these  events 
persisted. Moreover, considering the efficacy, it was questioned whether the excess in events, even if 
transient, i.e. persisting 0-8 weeks, is acceptable. 
A higher incidence of anxiety, depressive mood and insomnia was observed in the fampridine treated 
patients. While for the depressive events (and also the suicide events) it is rather difficult to judge if 
these were related to the fampridine treatment or to the MS itself, the signals of increased anxiety and 
insomnia were easier to distinguish. For a drug which would be applied chronically, this might present 
a serious problem in the long run. 
Further  an  increased  frequency  of  UTI,  respiratory  tract  infections  and  constipation  was  observed  in 
the  fampridine  arm.  This  raises  the  question  whether  fampridine  does  affect  the  motility  of  the 
urogenital,  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  tract.  Since  there  are  some  changes  in  the  blood  counts 
indicative  for  suppression  of  haematopoiesis,  a  compromised  immune  response  may  form  an 
alternative explanation for the differences in infection rates. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Pharmacodynamic interaction of fampridine with anti-epileptic and anti-arrhythmic agents is expected, 
based on the mechanism of action of fampridine.  This was not investigated sufficiently and therefore 
remained a point of concern.  
Cardiovascularly compromised patients were excluded from the trials. Given the mechanism of action, 
the  safety  in  cardiovascularly  compromised  patients  remains  to  be  established.  As  a  matter  of  fact, 
even  in  the  absence  of  these  patients  in  the  MS  population  studied,  these  events  have  already  been 
observed  with  higher  incidence  in  the  fampridine  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  Hence,  the  true 
ASSESSMENT REPORT

magnitude of the cardiovascular risk could not be estimated from the short term safety data, and long 
term data so far are insufficient. The benefit/risk in this population is therefore uncertain.   
Another  uncertainty  is  related  to  the  benefit/risk  in  the  elderly  multiple  sclerosis  patients,  since  very 
few elderly patients were included in the studies. Adverse events may be a specific issue in the elderly, 
as the product is eliminated renally, but also because this population might be more sensitive to CNS 
effects. 
Long term safety data are insufficient for a conclusive assessment of long term safety.  35% drop-out 
rates suggest that the benefit/risk balance changes over time.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A  statistically  significant  effect  in  terms  of  a  consistent  improvement  in  walking  speed  in  the  short-
term studies is considered established. However, the value of the T25FW and the responder definition 
derived from it is questioned. The clinical relevance of the statistically significant differences is highly 
uncertain.  The  applicant  was  not  able  to  relate  the  observed  changes  in  walking  speed  to  clinical 
meaningfulness.  In  particular,  neither  patients  nor  physicians  perceived  the  change  in  walking  speed 
as  an  improvement,  whereas  overstimulation  may  impair  walking  quality  and  the  range  of  action. 
Supportive evidence of efficacy is limited and whether the decline in effect under long term treatment 
is  due  to  disease  progression  or  lack  of  effect  or  both  remained  unclear.  Hence,  maintenance  of 
efficacy is unclear. 
Identified  risks  include  coordination  abnormalities,  but  also  anxiety,  pain,  insomnia  and  an  increased 
risk  of  infections.  There  are  uncertainties  concerning  the  long  term  safety,  safe  use  in  the  elderly, 
cardiovascularly  compromised  patients,  patients  at  risk  of  seizures  including  epileptic  patients  and 
patients with mild renal impairment. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit / risk of fampridine is considered unfavourable.  
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Concerning the quality and non-clinical data, no major objections remained at the end of the review. 
However, regarding the clinical data too many uncertainties concerning both benefit and risk, preclude 
a recommendation for a positive opinion.  
Basically,  these  refer  to  the  need  to  substantiate  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  observed  on 
walking  speed.  With  respect  to  safety,  the  observed  abnormal  coordination  may  counterbalance  a 
positive  effect  on  the  walking  speed.  Long  term  efficacy  and  safety  remains  unclear.  In  addition, 
relevant issues related to the mechanism of action of fampridine need further attention for a positive 
recommendation, i.e. the safety in cardiovascularly compromised patients, patients at risk of seizures 
including epileptic patients, the elderly and patients with mild renal impairment.  
The proposal of the applicant to resolve these problems in the SmPC was not considered acceptable by 
the  CHMP.  The  lack  of  relationship  between  the  walking  test  and  clinical  benefit  precludes  a 
recommendation of accepting this symptomatic treatment. The efficacy on a clinical outcome remains 
questionable,  long-term  efficacy  declines  and  long-term  safety  data  are  insufficient,  precluding 
accepting a risk of overstimulation affecting walking ability.  
One  member  of  the  CHMP  expressed  a  divergent  position  to  the  outcome  of  the  benefit-risk 
assessment  and  considered  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  fampridine  for  improvement  of  walking  ability 
favourable.  In particular, this member was of the view that results of fampridine in the pivotal trials 
were consistent with a clear symptomatic effect that might be of importance in a subgroup of multiple

sclerosis  patients,  for  whom  there  are  no  alternatives  besides  physiotherapy.  With  respect  to  the 
safety  profile  of  the  product,  namely  the  risk  of  seizures,  the  member  considered  that  these  are 
manageable as their frequency is low and specialised prescribers will supervise use of the product.  
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by  majority 
decision  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  fampridine  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  multiple 
sclerosis  for  the  improvement  of  walking  ability  was  unfavourable  and  therefore  did  not  recommend 
the granting of the marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP considered that: 
 
The  statistically  significant  but  small  improvements  in  walking  speed  could  not  be  related  to 
meaningful improvements in walking ability e.g. walking quality, endurance and increased range of 
action.  Furthermore,  the  improvement  in  walking  speed  was  not  accompanied  by  a  clear  and 
consistent overall benefit, as assessed by doctors and patients. 
 
The  small  uncertain  benefit  does  not  outweigh  the  increased  incidence  of  adverse  events  e.g. 
anxiety, 
insomnia,  seizures, 
infections  and  events 
indicating  an  abnormal  sensory 
feedback/overstimulation that may negatively affect walking ability. 
 
 
The long-term efficacy as well as long-term safety have been insufficiently established. 
The  benefit/risk  in  relevant  subpopulations,  such  as  the  elderly,  cardiovascularly  compromised 
patients and epileptic patients is unclear. 
Due  to  the  aforementioned  concerns  a  satisfactory  summary  of  product  characteristics,  labelling, 
package leaflet, risk management plan and follow-up measures to address other concerns as outlined 
in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage. 
Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 20 January 2011 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Fampyra was not approvable for the following indication: 
“Treatment of adult patients with Multiple Sclerosis for the improvement of walking ability”  
the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the opinion. 
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented their detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation 
to  the  CHMP.  Following  a  request  from  the  applicant  at  the  time  of  the  re-examination,  the  CHMP 
convened  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG)  Neurology  inviting  the  experts  including  patient 
representatives to provide their views on the CHMP questions in relation to the marketing authorisation 
application, taking into account the applicant´s response to the grounds for refusal. 
Ground 1: The statistically significant but small improvements in walking speed could not be related to 
meaningful  improvements  in  walking  ability  e.g.  walking  quality,  endurance  and  increased  range  of 
action. Furthermore, the improvement in walking speed was not accompanied by a clear and consistent 
overall benefit, as assessed by doctors and patients.

Applicant´s position: 
The applicant considered that the CHMP questioned both the magnitude of the treatment effect and the 
breadth  of  the  data  collected  on  overall  walking  ability  in  the  Fampridine-PR  studies.  These  concerns 
were  raised  in  the  context  of  a  lack  of  confidence  in  certain  aspects  of  the  trial  design  and  analysis 
plan.  
The applicant focused on the following key concerns raised by the CHMP during their review: 
1.  The  nature  of  the  definition  of  a  responder  on  the  Timed  25  Foot  Walk  (T25FW):  There  were 
concerns  regarding  the  limitations  of  the  T25FW  as  a  measure  of  walking  ability  in  MS.  There  was 
concern that the definition of a responder did not appear to define a clinically meaningful magnitude of 
change in walking speed. 
2. The use of a subgroup analysis for the key secondary endpoint of patient-reported walking disability 
(MSWS-12), which was performed based on the T25FW responder categories. The statistical validity of 
this approach was questioned. 
3.  The  weakness  of  changes  in  global  impression  scores  in  those  patients  experiencing  consistent 
changes in walking speed. Given the concerns with points 1 and 2, the CHMP did not further evaluate 
the  significance  of  the  MSWS-12  data  but  concentrated  instead  on  the  “small”  changes  in  the  global 
impression measures in those patients identified as showing consistent improvement in walking speed. 
These changes did not appear  to support clinical meaningfulness. In addition, the T25FW without the 
support of the MSWS-12 appeared to be too narrow an evaluation of walking ability overall. 
The  applicant  emphasised  that  the  clinician  and  subject  global  impression  scores  were  neither 
adequate  nor  intended  to  be  used  to  support  a  specific  effect  on  improvement  of  walking.  On  the 
contrary,  the  scales  were  intended  to  determine  whether  there  might  be  some  negative  effect  of 
treatment  in  another,  unexpected  domain  of  patient  experience  that  might  offset  the  ambulatory 
improvements  measured  with  the  focused  ambulation  measurements:  the  T25FW  and  the  MSWS-12. 
Moreover,  the  applicant  mentioned  that  it  was  not  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  outcomes  on  these 
scales could be compared to indications like pain or psychiatric indications where treatment may make 
patients  return  to  “normal”.  Patients  in  the  Fampridine-PR  development  had  severe  walking  disability 
and many non-walking disabilities that are not expected to “overall improve”. 
To  address  the  CHMP  concerns,  the  applicant  presented  the  clinical  and  scientific  justification  for  the 
endpoints chosen and the analyses used in the subsequent evaluation of the clinical meaningfulness of 
the treatment effects:  
Rationale for Timed 25-Foot Walk Test 
The objective for the development of a Responder definition was to use a clinically relevant method to 
identify  patients  whose  walking  improves  with  treatment.  In  the  applicant´s  view,  independent 
scientific  literature  supports  the  appropriateness  of  using  the  T25FW  as  the  primary  outcome 
measurement  for  walking  in  the  intended  MS  patient  population.  Maximum  walking  speed  over  short 
distances  is  sufficient  to  assess  walking  quality  and  walking  capacity,  especially  in  severely  disabled 
people with MS. The T25FW has proven methodological strengths, is a validated test for walking ability 
in MS, is considered in the field to be among the most sensitive and reproducible of tests for walking, 
and  has  known  responsiveness  and  established  thresholds  for  what  is  a  reliable  change.  There  are 
ethical  and  feasibility  reasons  that  hinder  the  use  of  long-distance  walk  tests  in  severely  disabled 
people with MS, such as those studied in this programme. 
During the initial review, the CHMP was of the opinion that the T25FW as “a single item” would not be 
sufficient  to  assess  walking  and  that  in  particular  endurance  was  very  important  to  patients  with  MS 
and  should  have  been  evaluated.  The  applicant  clarified  that  walking  was  not  assessed  by  a  “single 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 68/89
 
 
 
item”. The patient-reported outcome (MSWS-12) was applied to complement the objective assessment 
of walking speed with elements like endurance, balance, distance, effort to walk, etc.; and Fampridine-
PR was superior to placebo (group comparison) on all domains except running. 
The  CHMP  referenced  a  report  of  a  Multidisciplinary  Consensus  Conference  by  the  Consortium  of 
Multiple  Sclerosis  Centres  claiming  that  the  T25FW  does  not  adequately  reflect  walking  ability.  [The 
authors]  support  the  use  of  T25FW  as  a  measure  of  walking  ability  in  the  clinical  research  setting; 
therefore, the applicant argued that the conclusion reached by the CHMP did not accurately reflect the 
proposals  from  this  consortium  and  the  context  in  which  these  recommendations  were  made  –  the 
clinical management of patients. 
The  applicant  also  commented  on  the  CHMP  reasoning  that  gait  speed  would  not  give information  on 
“muscle strength, sensory feedback and coordination” and suggesting that these parameters might in 
fact be negatively impacted by Fampridine-PR treatment. The applicant argued that this opinion is not 
intuitive because it is hard to imagine how coordination problems and weakness would not realistically 
impact walking speed. Further, the applicant objected that the CHMP opinion was not in line with the 
existing  literature,  which  showed  that  gait  speed  in  people  with  MS  is  related  to  leg  strength  and 
sensory impairment. In both the aforementioned studies the correlation between strength parameters 
and gait velocity was modified by sensory impairment. The applicant stated that gait speed is defined 
by and reflects the complex interplay of strength, sensory impairment and coordination.  
The applicant pointed out that despite the acknowledged methodological strengths of the T25FW, the 
CHMP  questioned  whether  the  “T25FW  test  sufficiently  reflects  walking”  with  regard  to  the  “range  of 
action.”  In  the  detailed  grounds  for  re-examination,  the  applicant  referred  to  new  scientific  literature 
published since the original MAA demonstrating that the T25FW can predict, in large part, the range of 
daily activities (i.e. habitual walking as measured by number of steps) in patients with higher level of 
disability (EDSS 4.5 to 6.5) [Gijbels et al 2010]; longer timed-walking tests (2-Minute Walk Test and 
6-Minute Walk Test [6MWT] both unvalidated at the time of this development) did not predict habitual 
walking  significantly  better  in  patients  with  higher  disability  [Gijbels  et  al  2010],  the  authors 
highlighted  the  value  of  the  T25FW  to  predict  range  of  action  “particularly  if  it  is  not  possible  or 
perhaps somehow unethical to evaluate walking for an extended period, for example, in more severely 
affected  patients.”;  the  study  by  Barry  et  al.  [2009]  underscores  that  the  6MWT  was  indeed  not 
feasible for patients with progressive MS. 
The  applicant  concluded  that  the  T25FW  has  been  validated  across  numerous  studies  as  an  objective 
clinical  assessment  of  walking  disability  and  the  ideal  walking  assessment  in  a  trial  with  severely 
disabled MS patients. 
The Timed Walk Responder Definition 
As  MS  symptoms  and  walking  ability  fluctuate  widely  within  a  given  individual  from  day  to  day  an 
effective  responder  definition  should  only  identify  “real”  change  on  an individual  basis  that  is  beyond 
natural fluctuation that may occur on any clinical assessment of walking.  
In  the  Fampridine-PR  programme,  a  responder  was  defined  as  someone  who  had  consistent 
improvement in walking speed, i.e. walked faster on the majority of on-treatment visits (3 or 4 out of 
4)  than  the  fastest  of  5  off-treatment  visits  (4  before  and  1  after  treatment).  This  clinical  definition 
selected  individuals who demonstrated  walking  speeds  during  treatment  that  were  consistently faster 
than the best that they had achieved without treatment.  
In  theory,  this  approach  could  have  selected  patients  as  responders  who  had  relatively  small  but 
consistent changes from baseline; however, the applicant claimed that their data showed that this was 
not  the  case:  the  effect  was  in  fact  large  and  meaningful  in  patients  that  responded  to  the  drug.  In 
fact,  small  changes  on  this  criterion  would  only  be  possible  in  patients  with  very  little  variability  in 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 69/89
 
 
 
walking speed at baseline, where the best walking speed was little different from the average walking 
speed,  and  this  is  rare  in  MS;  the  applicant  also  considered  worth  noting  that  even  small,  but 
consistent  improvement  over  the  patients’  best  speed  is  in  itself  a  worthy  outcome  for  the  severely 
affected patients with high variability in their day to day walking abilities. 
The  applicant  highlighted  that  this  approach  was  not  new,  for  example  in  clinical  studies  assessing 
disease modifying therapies in MS, there is a definition of consistent change in disability, defined as a 
sustained  change  in  EDSS  score  at  two  time  points.  The  Fampridine-PR  development  programme 
adopted a similar model and assessed sustained increases in speed over time. 
More conventional responder analyses tend to use a response definition based on a selected threshold 
of  average  change  from  baseline.  However,  such  a  definition  was  not  considered  optimal  for  MS 
because it ignores the temporal variability of MS symptoms. The underlying assumption in selection of 
a predefined magnitude of response is that a change is believed, a priori, to be “meaningful”, whether 
or not it is related to treatment. In the presence of significant variability, this is susceptible to a high 
rate of false positive responses created by random fluctuations in MS symptoms. 
Using  the  reasoning  above,  the  applicant  concluded  that  a  clinical  responder  definition  based  on 
consistency  appropriately  identified  real  improvement  of  walking  speed  on  T25FW  from  natural 
baseline  fluctuations  in  patients  with  heterogeneous,  severe  walking  disability.  In  addition  to  the 
clinical assessment of walking with the T25FW, the MSWS-12 was used as a patient-reported outcome 
to complement the clinical assessment with the patient perspective of different aspects of overall daily 
walking ability (distance walked, effort to walk, balance, concentration, etc.). 
MSWS-12 and Validity of the Statistical Analysis 
The  MSWS-12  is  a  patient-reported  outcome  scale  that  was  developed  from  qualitative  research  in 
people  with  MS  to  define  the  most  relevant  aspects  of  walking  from  the  patient’s  perspective.  The 
MSWS-12  assesses  12  different  domains  of  walking  function  and  quality  (11  of  the  12  are  not 
“speed”). They include:  
• Function: walking, running, climbing stairs, standing, and balancing  
•  Quality:  distance,  effort,  need  for  support  outdoor/indoor,  speed,  smoothness,  required  mental 
concentration.  
MSWS-12 is a validated tool developed specifically to assess walking ability in MS patients. There are 
established methods that can be used to determine meaningful changes in the MSWS- 12.  Standard 
error of measurement (SEM): mean estimate using data from 7 studies (two of which used fampridine) 
is 5.0 points (range: 4.2 to 6.0 points). The minimal important difference (MID) was 4.9 points (range 
3.5  to  6.2  points).  International  standards  on  guidelines  for  clinically  important  change  on  patient-
reported outcome measures are met by defining meaningful changes through both SEM and MID and 
(IMMPACT consensus criteria).  
The  applicant  concluded  that  the  MSWS-12  complements  the  T25FW  for  the  assessment  of  overall 
walking ability, as it measures different aspects of  global walking ability from a different perspective. 
In their initial review, the CHMP considered that a circular line of reasoning had been presented by the 
applicant,  given  that  non-randomized  groups  of  responders  and  non  responders  were  formally 
compared  for  their  changes  in  MSWS-12  score  and  also  with  respect  to  the  magnitude  of  change  in 
walking speed in these groups. 
In light of the CHMP comments, the applicant further reviewed the use of the responder analysis in this 
context. The applicant concluded that while the responder analysis alone is useful, it is not sufficient to 
establish  that  the  observed  treatment  difference  in  walking  speed  translates  into  a  clinical  benefit  of 
Fampridine-PR, the clinical benefit can be established by examining the totality of the data. 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011

Moreover, the applicant also concluded that the within-responder analysis provides useful information 
that  allows  characterization  of  the  magnitude  of  effect  in  patients  who  responded  to  Fampridine-PR 
treatment.  In  their  grounds  for  re-examination  the  applicant  acknowledged  that  the  original 
presentation  of  these  data  may  have  incorrectly  given  the  impression  that  the  within-responder 
analysis  was  to  be  interpreted  as  an  inferential  statistical  result  to  further  establish  efficacy.  An 
analysis  of  this  kind  would  not  have  been  valid  for  a  comparison  of  non-randomized  groups.  This 
analysis was intended only as a correlation of the key objective and subjective measurements in order 
to  further  characterize  the  extent  to  which  Timed  Walk  Responders  experienced  clinically  meaningful 
improvements  in  their  walking  ability,  as  reflected  in  their  MSWS-12  scores.  The  applicant  specified 
that  this  step  was  necessary  to  examine  the  clinical  relevance of  the  primary  endpoint  but  did  not in 
itself serve to demonstrate efficacy; efficacy was established by the treatment group comparison of the 
primary endpoint itself, supported by the totality of evidence from similar comparisons of all the other 
available endpoint measures.  
Primary Analysis of Timed-Walk Response 
The  pre-specified  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  Timed  Walk  Response,  defined  as  consistent 
improvement  in  walking  speed.  In  each  of  the  two  pivotal  studies  there  were  substantially  more 
Fampridine-PR-treated  patients  who  experienced  consistent  improvements  in  walking  speed  when 
compared to placebo-treated patients. The applicant reiterated that the results were highly statistically 
and clinically significant, in the individual studies as well as in the pooled data from the two studies.

In study MS-F203 a three stage stepwise analysis was pre-defined to establish a positive outcome on 
the primary endpoint and to establish its clinical meaningfulness with respect to overall walking ability. 
Step 1 was to show a significantly greater proportion of Timed Walk Responders in the Fampridine-PR 
group  as  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  Step  2  was  to  register  a  significant  improvement  in  the 
MSWS-12 score for the Timed Walk Responders when compared to Timed Walk Non-Responders. Step 
3  was  to  confirm  maintenance  of  effect  by  testing  whether  those  patients  who  responded  to 
Fampridine-PR treatment on the T25FW would still register a significant improvement in walking speed 
relative to placebo-treated patients at the last observed double-blind visit. The second step in the pre-
specified primary analysis showed that those patients who were responders (in both treatment groups 
combined) according to the primary endpoint improved in terms of the key clinical endpoint (average 
change from baseline in the MSWS-12 score over the double-blind period) than the corresponding non-
responders.  
The applicant agreed with the CHMP that this correlation of itself was not sufficient to establish that the 
observed treatment difference in the primary endpoint translates into a clinical benefit of Fampridine-
PR. In order to demonstrate that this is indeed the case it was considered of outstanding importance to 
show two things: Firstly, that amongst the responders in the Fampridine-PR group, the average change 
from  baseline  in  the  MSWS-12  score  is  similar  to  the  corresponding  average  change  from  baseline 
amongst  the  responders  in  the  placebo  group.  Secondly,  that  amongst  the  non-responders  in  the 
Fampridine-PR  group,  the  average  change  from  baseline  in  the  MSWS-12  score  is  similar  to  the 
corresponding  average  change  from  baseline  amongst  the  non-responders  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
applicant stated that both pivotal studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 showed that these assumptions hold 
true, as shown in the table below.  The applicant chose to present these data in the detailed grounds

for  re-examination  in  order  to  clarify  that  the  treatment  effects  seen  in  responders  were  clinically 
meaningful.  In  the  applicant´s  view,  this  additional  analysis  supports  that  the  highly  significant 
differences  seen  in  the  primary  endpoint  translate  into  clear  differences  on  a  scale  which  has  direct 
clinical meaning.

Treatment Comparisons for the Secondary Endpoints 
The  applicant  pointed  out  that  in  assessing  the  statistical  significance  for  secondary  endpoints,  one 
must remember that the power and sample size calculations for the pivotal studies were based on the 
primary  endpoint  and  not  specifically  the  secondary  endpoints.  Achieving  statistical  significance  for 
these endpoints therefore should not be expected in the individual studies. According to the applicant, 
the  pooled  analysis  provides  the  most  complete  information  with  regard  to  these  endpoints,  and 
supports  the  robustness  of  the  conclusions  through  the  consistency  of  effect  across  the  individual 
studies. The table below presents results of treatment comparison for the secondary endpoints both for 
the individual studies and for the pooled (meta) analyses.

Patients Perceived Walking Speed Improvement as Meaningful 
The  applicant  claimed  that  the  Timed  Walk  Responders  showed  a  marked  reduction  from  baseline  in 
MSWS-12 score. In comparison, Timed Walk Non-Responders showed an average score that was quite 
stable between baseline and treatment periods in the individual studies and in the pooled analysis: 
• The change from baseline score was -6.50 for Timed Walk Responder versus +0.41 for Timed Walk 
Non-Responders, respectively (pre-defined analysis) 
To  contextualize  what  an  improvement  of  6.5  points  means,  the  applicant  attributed  the  claimed 
meaningfulness of this change to the fact that 
•  it  exceeds  the  threshold  for  minimally  important  change  as  described  above  and  also  exceeds  the 
clinically-meaningful change estimated from seven studies, of which two include Fampridine-PR, 
• there is a 6.7 point difference in baseline MSWS-12 score between patients with EDSS 5.5 and 6.5 at 
baseline  in  the  pivotal  studies.  A  difference  of  6.5  MSWS-12  points  illustrates  the  difference  between 
being able to walk with two canes (EDSS 6.5) or without walking aid (EDSS 5.5). 
Meaningfulness of Improvements of 20% on T25FW 
The  applicant  also  used  post-hoc  sensitivity  analyses  that  explored  alternatively-defined  response 
criteria  based  on  magnitude  of  walking  speed  improvement,  concluding  that  the  outcomes  provided 
strong  support  for  conclusions  of  the  original  analysis.  In  the  analysis  below  (figure  9),  the  applicant 
looked at the proportion of Fampridine-PR-treated patients who achieved threshold changes in walking 
speed from no change to ≥60% improvement. At any chosen threshold up to 40%, Fampridine-PR was 
nominally  significantly  better  than  placebo  which  would  have  demonstrated  statistical  significance  if 
these thresholds had been used to prospectively define response. 
Figure 9

EMA/555661/2011  
Page 73/89
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further,  the  applicant  pointed  out  that  an  average  improvement  of  ≥20%  on  the  T25FW  (without 
regard to Timed Walk Responder status) was associated with meaningful improvements on the MSWS-
12  (average  improvement  8.4  points),  mentioning  this  was  in  agreement  with  the  literature  that  has 
consistently  demonstrated  that  the  change  on  the  T25FW  of  approximately  20%  is  clinically 
meaningful. 
Applicant’s Overall Conclusion to Grounds for Refusal 1 
The  applicant  mentioned  that  in  their  initial  review,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  small 
improvements in walking speed could not be related to meaningful improvements in walking ability and 
that the improvement was not accompanied by a clear overall benefit. The applicant concluded that the 
magnitude  of  improvement  in  patients  responding  to  treatment  with  Fampridine-PR  was  sizeable  and 
clinically meaningful, giving emphasis on the fact that the result was obtained in patients with severe 
walking ability for whom walking over short distances is critically important. 
In their response the applicant claims to have shown that: 
•  The  clinical  responder  definition  and  the  walking  assessment  were  appropriate  especially  given  the 
severity of walking disability in patients in this development 
•  The  objective,  physician-measured  improvement  in  the  time  to  walk  25  feet  was  supported  by  the 
patient’s own subjective assessment of 12 parameters of overall walking ability 
•  The  correlative  analyses  of  objective  and  subjective  measures  within  responders  is  valid  and  not 
circular 
•  The  clinical  responder  definition  alone,  although  useful,  was  not  sufficient  to  prove  clinical 
meaningfulness of the data 
• The totality of evidence demonstrates clinical significant improvements with Fampridine-PR 
The  applicant  also  reiterated  that  the  pre-defined  responder  analysis  was  further  supported  by  an 
alternative post-hoc analysis demonstrating an increase of walking speed of ≥20% in 33% of patients 
treated with Fampridine-PR compared with 14% of patients in the placebo-group and that the benefit 
demonstrated  on  11  of  the  12  domains  of  the  MSWS-12  confirmed  the  clinical  meaningfulness  of  a 
20% improvement for the patient population within this programme. 
CHMP position 
The CHMP re-discussed the acceptability of the primary endpoint of the pivotal trials, considering that 
timed  walk  tests,  and  the  T25FW  in  particular,  are  tools  to  evaluate  walking  in  multiple  sclerosis  in 
clinical  practice.  In  their  initial  review,  the  choice  of  the  T25FWT  was  regarded  by  the  CHMP  as  a 
pharmacodynamic  endpoint  only,  which  was  supported  by  the  SAG  Neurology  (1st  SAG  in  September 
2010). During the re-examination the CHMP considered that the result on MS Walking Scale-12, which 
is a validated patient reported outcome measure specifically developed to assess walking ability in MS 
patients,  contributed  to  supporting  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  studies,  i.e.  the  T25FW  test. 
The relevance of the primary endpoint itself was further re-discussed in terms of clinically meaningful 
improvement  in  walking  speed.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  SAG  Neurology  concluded  in  its  second 
meeting  (May  2011)  by  majority  that  a  20  %  difference  compared  to  placebo  is  probably  clinically 
relevant. Of note, in the second SAG Neurology meeting during the re-examination procedure, clinical 
relevance was considered and discussed in the context of a “% improvement” rather than with respect 
to  the  outcome  measure  as  such,  and  improvement  of  a  certain  magnitude  (cut-off),  i.e.  20%,  was 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 74/89
 
 
 
 
 
considered  meaningful  (see  section  SAG  Neurology).  Also  in  literature1-4,  scientific  evidence  was 
available supporting the difference of 20% in walking speed as clinically relevant.  
Furthermore,  following  the  applicant´s  presentation  of  the  new  correlation  analyses  (tables  22-24 
below)  in  the  re-examination  oral  explanation,  the  CHMP  considered  that  improvement  in  walking 
speed and subjective perceptions of change (MSWS-12) were related in the pivotal trials. Correlation of 
the  two  scales  was  about  0.4.  Overall,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  T25FW  with  the  support  of 
MSWS-12 was an acceptable evaluation of walking ability. The CHMP also took into consideration that 
there  was  only  a  minor  proportion  of  patients  (about  5  %  in  the  fampridine  group)  experiencing 
improvement  only  subjectively  (on  the  MSWS-12)  and  having  no  increase  in  walking  speed  at  the 
same time (Table 23). This finding was considered re-assuring by the CHMP.

Taking  results  on  the  primary  (T25FW)  and  the  MSWS-12  secondary  endpoint  together,  it  was 
considered  possible  to  define  a  patient  population  benefiting  from  the  treatment  in  both  scales,  i.e. 
select the responders and conclude on a positive-benefit risk balance. 
In  view  of  the  oral  explanation,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  the  modification  in  the  section  4.2  (Posology) 
proposed  by  the  applicant,  which  was  elaborating  on  criteria  for  selecting  responders  and  on 
discontinuation criteria in case patients stop exhibiting response. This approach was in line with the re-
examination SAG  Neurology,  which  suggested  that  improvement  on  a  walking  test  with  clinical  utility 
and  simple  to  use  in  clinical  practice  should  be  evaluated  in  an  interval  of  two  weeks  after  starting 
treatment to guide further treatment: 
Section 4.2 
“Starting and Evaluating Fampyra Treatment 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 76/89
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initial prescription should be limited to 2 weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should generally be 
identified within 2-weeks after starting Fampyra. 
  A  timed  walking  test,  e.g.  the  Timed  25  Foot  Walk  (T25FW),  is  recommended  to  evaluate 
improvement after two weeks. If no improvement is observed, Fampyra should be discontinued  
 
Fampyra should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. 
Re-Evaluating Fampyra Treatment 
If decline in walking ability is observed physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in order 
to  reassess  the  benefits  of  Fampyra  (see  above).  The  re-evaluation  should  include  withdrawal  of 
Fampyra  and  performing  the  walking  test.  Fampyra  should  be  discontinued  if  patients  no  longer 
receive walking benefit.” 
Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  understanding  of  benefit  provided  by  fampridine  is  not 
completely explained by the data currently available; in particular, other important aspects of walking 
such as balance, endurance and walking distance that constitute additional evidence of improvement in 
the overall walking ability were regarded relevant. The CHMP considered that further data obtained in a 
controlled  setting  of  a  clinical  trial  are  needed  and  that  the  validity  of  the  currently  proposed  criteria 
for  identification  of  responders  should  be  further  evaluated.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the 
marketing authorisation should be granted subject to a following condition:  
“To conduct a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a 
broader  primary  endpoint  clinically  meaningful  in  terms  of  walking  ability  and  to  further  evaluate  the 
early  identification  of  responders  in  order  to  guide  further  treatment.  The  study  report  is  to  be 
submitted by 30 June 2016.” 
Given  the  CHMP  view  that  T25FW  with  the  support  of  MSWS-12  was  an  acceptable  evaluation  of 
walking ability, the results concerning the CGI and SGI scores were no longer considered of relevance 
for efficacy.   
The CHMP concluded that the ground for refusal No.1 was resolved with the condition specified above. 
Ground  2:  The  small  uncertain  benefit  does  not  outweigh  the  increased  incidence  of  adverse  events 
e.g.  anxiety, 
insomnia,  seizures, 
infections  and  events 
indicating  an  abnormal  sensory 
feedback/overstimulation that may negatively affect walking ability. 
Applicant´s position: 
The applicant argued that the benefits to responders were significant and neither uncertain nor small 
and  commented  that  the  side  effects  of  Fampridine-PR  identified  from  the  placebo-controlled  clinical 
trials,  including  seizures,  are  recognised  symptoms  or  complications  of  MS  itself,  and  there  is  no 
evidence that they adversely affect the improved walking ability. 
Of  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  observed  in  the  placebo-controlled  studies  (Phase  2  Study  MSFS202, 
Phase 3 Studies MS-F203 and MS-F204), which included anxiety and insomnia, 94% were assessed as 
either  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  rarely  caused  withdrawal  of  treatment.  Those  events 
subsequently  recognized  as  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  usually  resolved  with  continued  therapy 
and  led  to  withdrawal  in  only  1.75%  of  the  safety  population.  In  the  active  treatment  group, 
withdrawals  caused  by  ADRs  were  balance  disorder  0.5%,  dizziness  0.5%,  headache  0.5%,  and 
anxiety  0.3%  (notably  there  was  no  withdrawal  due  to  insomnia).  In  the  placebo  group,  a  complex 
partial  seizure  led  to  withdrawal  in  one  patient  (0.4%).  Spontaneous  data  emerging  from  the  US 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011

marketplace  are  reassuring  and  strongly  support  the  current  understanding  of  the  safety  profile.  The 
anticipated increase in urinary tract effects has not been confirmed. 
Non-Seizure CNS events 
The  ADRs  occurring  with  Fampridine-PR  treatment  were  identified  from  an  integrated  safety  analysis 
and  are  presented  in  the  table  below.  The  incidence  of  events  in  the  placebo  group  indicates  how 
commonly these complications are seen in MS patients.

The  applicant  emphasised  that  the  AEs  recognised  as  treatment  group  side  effects  represent  only  a 
relative  increase  in  some  common  symptoms  of  MS  and  that  they  occurred  in  a  small  percentage  of 
patients.  As  shown  in  the  table  above,  the  excess  of  anxiety  in  the  treatment  group  compared  to 
placebo is only 1.1%, although that of insomnia is 5%. 
The  analysis  of  data  from  the  trials  using  the  recommended  10  mg  BD  dosage  of  Fampridine-PR 
showed that the rates of AEs of falling and/or injuries sustained as a result of falling were actually less 
in  the  Fampridine-PR  treated  patients  (12.5%)  compared  with  placebo-treated  patients  (15.1%).  In 
addition,  the  reported  falls  (and  any  injuries  likely  to  have  been  sustained  in  falling)  were  not 
associated with concurrent or preceding events indicative of CNS excitation. 
Seizures 
Pre-clinical  animal  pharmacology  has  shown  a  dose  and  plasma  concentration  dependent  risk  of 
seizure. 
Seizure in Pre-Marketing Development of Fampridine-PR 
History of seizure or presence of epileptiform activity on a screening EEG was an exclusion criterion for 
the  clinical  studies  in  the  Fampridine-PR  development  programme.  Dose  finding  studies  with 
Fampridine-PR  showed  evidence  of  a  dose-dependent  risk  of  seizure.  However,  the  Phase  3  double-
blind  placebo-controlled  studies  did  not  show  any  elevated  risk  of  seizure  with  Fampridine-PR 
treatment  at  the  therapeutic  dose  of  10  mg  BD  when  compared  to  placebo  (incidence  of 
seizure/convulsion was 0.19% for Fampridine-PR and 0.4% for placebo). The incidence rate of reports 
of  seizure/convulsion  in  the  long-term  open-label  trials  was  4.1/1000  patient  years  (95%  confidence 
intervals 0.13, 0.96) which most likely represents the background incidence in MS patients. The report 
of seizure in the placebo group in the trials demonstrates that patients with advanced MS are at risk of 
seizures. The rate of seizure in the placebo group was 0.4% over a period of 3 months, suggesting an 
incidence  of  around  16/1000  patient  years,  but  of  course  with  very  wide  95%  confidence  intervals 
(0.00, 46.6). These results from clinical trials are reassuring, but patients were carefully selected and 
specific exclusion criteria ensured a low-risk population.

Fampridine-PR  has  been  available  on  the  US  market  since  March  2010,  and  up  until  21st  January 
2011, an estimated 39,600 patients had been supplied with the drug. In the USA, cases of seizure and 
convulsion  are  specifically  solicited  as  part  of  the  marketing  authorisation  risk-management 
commitments,  making  under-reporting  unlikely.  As  of  28th  February  2011,  64  reports  of  seizure  had 
been reported or confirmed by a healthcare professional. The mean age of the patients was 52 years 
(range  26  to  73,  median  52).  Sixteen  patients  (25%)  were  male  and  46  (72%)  female,  for  two  the 
gender  was  not  known.  Duration  of  treatment  prior  to  the  event  varied  between  one  dose  and  236 
days  (mean  54  days,  median  21  days)  and  in  four  cases  it  was  unknown.  Seventeen  patients  (27%) 
suffered a seizure within three days of starting treatment with fampridine. The descriptions of the 64 
reports  of  seizure  were  given  as  26  convulsions,  16  seizures,  13  Grand  Mal  episodes,  4  status 
epilepticus,  3  tonic/clonic  episodes,  one  confusional  state/convulsion,  and  one  nocturnal  seizure.  The 
seizures  were  generally  of  short  duration,  although  four  reports  described  a  period  of  status 
epilepticus.  
Of the 64 case reports, 44 had a potential risk factor for seizure, 17 did not, and the remaining 3 cases 
had insufficient available detail for assessment. Two of the seizure events were associated with dosing 
errors.  The  first  case  report  described  a  66-year-old  female  patient  who  took  her  evening  tablet  of 
fampridine  after  several  weeks  of  uneventful  treatment.  Her  husband,  not  realising  she  had  already 
taken  the  evening  dose,  gave  her  a  further  tablet  some  30  minutes  later.  Five  hours  later,  she 
experienced a generalised tonic/clonic seizure. The second case report describes a 47-year-old female 
patient  who  experienced  a  seizure  following  only  the  second  tablet  of  fampridine  taken  6  hours  after 
the first.  
In  three  cases  aetiologies  for  seizure  other  than  fampridine  are  more  likely.  One  case  described  off 
label  use  in  a  child  with  a  high  seizure-risk  medical  condition  (adrenoleucodystrophy).  In  a  second 
case,  a  seizure  was  reported  in  a  patient  with  progressive  multifocal  leucoencephalopathy  (PML)  who 
experienced  a  further  seizure  after  fampridine  had  been  stopped.  The  third  patient  was  a  previously 
diagnosed epileptic and was taking prophylactic topiramate treatment.  
Analysis  of  the  59  remaining  cases  identified  a  history  of  previous  seizure  in  10  patients.  Thirty-five 
case reports described the use of at least one concomitant medication with a labelled seizure risk. Of 
these  35  case  reports,  patients  in  21  cases  were  taking  one  medication  with  labelled  seizure  risk,  11 
were  taking  two  and  3  patients  were  taking  a  combination  of  three  other  medications  with  labelled 
seizure risk. One patient had suffered a head injury and subdural haematoma five months previously. 
Seventeen cases had neither a history of previous seizure or risk factor, nor were taking concomitant 
medications  with  a  seizure  risk  labelled,  and  three  had  insufficient  information  reported  to  make  an 
assessment. 
CHMP position 
The CHMP considered that a higher rate of CNS adverse events with active treatment as compared to 
placebo  was  observed.  This  observation  was  not  completely  unexpected  and  was  regarded  as  related 
to  the  mechanism  of  action  –  through  alteration  (acceleration)  of  nerve  impulse  transmission.  The 
CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  type  and  frequency  of  these  adverse  events,  i.e.  anxiety,  insomnia, 
dizziness,  tremor,  etc.  should  not  be  assessed  isolated  from  efficacy;  with  resolving  the  efficacy-
related  ground  for  refusal  number  one,  these  adverse  events  were  no  longer  considered  a  safety 
concern  precluding  granting  the  marketing  authorisation  but  rather  an  issue  of  tolerability. 
Furthermore, the CHMP noted that in clinical trials, despite being more frequent in the treated group, 
these adverse events were of mild and transitory nature and rarely led to discontinuation. 
The potential of fampridine to cause seizures was considered of a main safety concern by the CHMP. In  
studies MS-F201 and MS-F202 where doses greater than 10 mg twice daily were used 2 out of 25 and 
2 out of 159 fampridine treated patients experienced seizures respectively – an overall rate of 2.2%. 
ASSESSMENT REPORT

In  the  double  blind  phases  of  studies  MS-203  and  MS-204  where  the  proposed  dose  of  10  mg  twice 
daily was used one placebo treated patient experienced an absence episode, but no fampridine treated 
patients  experienced  seizures.    In  study  MS  F-203EXT  an  un-blinded  extension  study,  5  out  of  269 
(1.9%) fampridine treated patients experienced seizures. In study MS F-204EXT 0 out of 214 patients 
experienced seizures giving an overall rate in the two extension studies of 1.04%. 
In  the  post  authorisation  experience  in  the  US  there  have  been  64  reports  of  seizures  in  39,600 
treated  patients.  Three  of  these  were  in  patients  with  serious  neurological  problems  predisposing  to 
seizures that should probably not have been treated; if these are excluded, the seizure rate is 0.15%.  
In  their  meeting,  the  re-examination  SAG  Neurology  discussed  the  seizure  risk  and  recognized  that 
seizures  occur  rarely  in  patients  treated  with  fampridine,  further  data  presented  by  the  applicant 
suggesting that occurrence of seizures is not a major concern for the overall benefit-risk balance of the 
product. In conclusion, the SAG Neurology recommended that pre-existing seizure disorder should be a 
contraindication to treatment with fampridine, which was agreed by the CHMP. 
At  the  time  of  the  oral  explanation,  the  applicant  presented  data  on  seizures  as  observed  in  the 
controlled  clinical  trials  (MS-F202/3/4),  open-label  extension  studies  and  post-marketing  seizure 
reports.  The  applicant  estimated  that  the  added  risk  of  fampridine  to  seizures  is  less  than  1/1000 
patients. The CHMP considered that this was further supported by literature‡ and the applicant´s data 
from  clinical  studies  with  other  multiple  sclerosis  products  (disease-modifying  drugs)  providing 
evidence on the background incidence of seizures in MS patients. The CHMP regarded this re-assuring 
in  terms  of  fampridine´s  low  level  of  the  added  risk.  The  applicant  also  recognized  the  dose-related 
association  of  fampridine  with  seizures  and  highlighted  that  the  prolonged  release  formulation  was 
developed to minimise this risk. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the data presented during the re-examination oral explanation were 
re-assuring, but did not allow for quantifying the true incidence of seizures associated with fampridine. 
However, the added risk level was considered low and dose-dependent (some of the events observed 
were related to medication errors associated with overdose). The CHMP considered that the therapeutic 
dose is border-line and that any increase (e.g. overdose) might put patients at higher risk of seizures. 
In this context, the CHMP considered that an observational study further quantifying the risk of seizure 
will be conducted, as described in the Risk Management Plan. 
The CHMP concluded that the ground for refusal No. 2 was resolved with the measures implemented in 
the RMP. 
Ground 3: The long-term efficacy as well as long-term safety have been insufficiently established. 
Applicant´s position: 
Clinical efficacy with Fampridine-PR was demonstrated by the ITT analysis of improvement in walking 
speed compared with placebo over the double-blind duration of the pivotal studies of up to 12 weeks. 
The analyses demonstrated that the effect of Fampridine-PR 10 mg BD was maintained throughout the 
treatment period in both studies.  
Current  CHMP  guidelines  for  long-term  symptomatic  treatment  and  maintenance  of  effect  within  the 
nervous system class of compounds vary widely depending on disease area, treatment objectives, and 
intended  treatment  duration.  For  other  symptomatic  treatments,  such  as  for  neuropathic  pain,  three 
months  double-blind  treatment,  followed  by  open  label  extension  (for  issues  with  tolerance)  is 
considered  adequate  (Guideline  on  clinical  medicinal  products  intended  for  the  Treatment  of 
Neuropathic Pain: CPMP/EWP/252/03 Rev. 1). The length of the double blind treatment periods in the

Fampridine-PR  studies  served  the  additional  purpose  of  reducing  concerns  that  expected  disease-
related  decline  in  walking  speed  would  interfere  with  interpretation  of  the  results.  Approximately  5% 
decrease  in  walking  speed  over  6  months  can  be  expected  in  patients  with  progressive  MS  and  high 
disability.  This medicine [fampridine] has rapid symptomatic effects and can be adequately and safely 
assessed by a neurologist to confirm continued benefit. To optimize the benefit risk equation the SmPC 
recommends  re-assessing  the  benefits  through  an  interruption  in  treatment  if  a  decline  in  walking 
ability is noted in patients who initially respond to treatment and receive long-term therapy.  
Long-term  open-label  study  data  allow  the  assessment  of  long-term  safety  of  Fampridine-PR 
treatment. A full analysis of data in August 2009 showed that the AE profile remained consistent over 
time, with no evidence of emergence of AEs not seen in the short-term trials. An analysis investigating 
effects  of  long-term  Fampridine-PR  treatment  on  progression  of  MS  has  shown  that  the  decline  in 
disability expected with a progressive disease such as MS in patients treated with Fampridine-PR is not 
different  to  that  seen  in  an  historical  control  group  of  patients  treated  with  the  disease  modifying 
therapy Avonex.  
Patients in the open-label extension study in USA were followed until drug was available on the market 
and  in  Canada,  long-term  treatment  is  still  continuing.  As  of  December  2010,  547  patients  had  been 
treated for one year, 480 for two years, 288 for three years, 235 for four years, 83 for five years, and 
48  for  six  years.  SAE  data  and  data  on  AEs  causing  discontinuation  from  this  further  extension  have 
been analysed and no suggestion of any new risk has been identified. 
At the time of the oral explanation, the applicant further clarified the concept of re-evaluating efficacy 
if  walking  deteriorates  during  the  treatment  with  the  options  of  a  temporary  interruption  and  re-
exposure to fampridine or permanent discontinuation in patients losing walking benefit. 
CHMP position 
The CHMP considered that there was no evidence of fampridine efficacy loss or increasing toxicity over 
time and that there were sufficient data from open-label extensions of the Phase III studies to satisfy 
the  standard  regulatory  criteria  for  long-term  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  data.  According  to  the 
response more than 1,400 patients were treated in clinical trials for at least one year. Moreover, based 
on  the  clinical  pharmacology  it  would  seem  unlikely  that  there  would  be  increasing  toxicity  or 
decreasing  pharmacodynamic  activity  over  time.  On  the  other  hand,  loss  of  clinical  benefit  over  time 
can  unfortunately  be  anticipated  due  to  disease  progression,  but  unrelated  to  the  changes  in  the 
pharmacological  properties  of  fampridine.  The  CHMP  also  considered  the  long-term  safety  data 
collected post-authorisation in the US and was of the opinion that these did not suggest any change in 
the  safety  profile  defined  in  the  double-blinded  trials  and  thus,  was  supportive  of  the  clinical  study 
data. The CHMP considered that in the absence of a CHMP guidance, clinical monitoring of effects for 
three  months  could  be  accepted  for  a  symptomatic  treatment  and  should  not  preclude  granting  of  a 
marketing authorisation, particularly in the context of the supportive post-marketing data from the US.  
The  concept  of  re-evaluating  efficacy  using  the  walking  test,  as  implemented  by  the  applicant  in  the 
revised product information was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Section 4.2 
“Re-Evaluating Fampyra Treatment 
If decline in walking ability is observed physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in order 
to  reassess  the  benefits  of  Fampyra  (see  above).  The  re-evaluation  should  include  withdrawal  of 
Fampyra  and  performing  the  walking  test.  Fampyra  should  be  discontinued  if  patients  no  longer 
receive walking benefit.” 
The CHMP concluded that the ground for refusal No. 3 was resolved.

Ground  4:  The  benefit/risk  in  relevant  subpopulations,  such  as  the  elderly,  cardiovascularly 
compromised patients and epileptic patients is unclear. 
Applicant´s position: 
Elderly 
The number of elderly MS patients included in the adequate and well-controlled studies was small. In 
the  placebo-controlled  trials  MS-F202,  MS-F203,  and  MS-F204,  there  were  23  patients  in  the  10  mg 
group (5.8%) aged over 65 years and 18 (7.6%) in the placebo group. Analysis of AEs by age in the 
10 mg BD Fampridine-PR placebo-controlled trials is reassuring in that there was no suggestion of any 
increase in overall reporting rates of AEs in the elderly age group. 
There is however, no evidence either from the limited exposure in the studies, or from the exposure in 
the  US  marketplace,  that  the  risk  for  the  elderly  from  taking  Fampridine-  PR  is  increased.  No  safety 
signals have emerged of problems relating to either renal function or greater age.

There is a theoretical risk based on the K+ blockade of fampridine to modify the cardiac conduction at 
high concentration, which could lead to sinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities   
The cardiac data have been reviewed by an independent expert who has concluded that: 
•  There  is  little  to  suggest  that  fampridine  will  result  in  QT  interval  prolongation  or  in  consequent 
arrhythmias. 
•  Clinical  cardiovascular  events  are  relatively  rare  compared  with  neurological  AEs.  No  particular 
pattern  of  cardiovascular  AE  is  seen.  There  is  little  to  suggest  that  arrhythmia  and  conduction 
disturbances are specific problems. 
•  Clinical  overdose  has  sometimes  been  associated  with  cardiovascular  incidents,  but  these  have  not 
been at all consistent or particularly disturbing. 
Clinical Development 
A thorough QT/QTc study did not detect any signal of pharmacological effects on cardiac repolarization 
at  doses  of  Fampridine-PR  of  up  to  30  mg  twice  a  day,  which  suggests  that  at  therapeutic  doses  in 
man, fampridine has a low potential for inducing cardiac arrhythmias based on QT-prolongation.  
Comparison  with  placebo  in  the  controlled  studies  using  Fampridine-PR  at  10  mg  BD  showed  a  slight 
excess  of  cardiovascular  events  in  the  active  treatment  group;  10  events  in  400  patients  (2.5%) 
compared  to  placebo  three  events  in  283  patients  (1.3%).  Exposure  to  fampridine  in  patients  with 
cardiovascular  disorders  was  limited,  as  subjects  with  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  disease 
(abnormal  ECG,  angina,  uncontrolled  hypertension,  clinically  significant  cardiac  arrhythmias  or  any

other  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  abnormality)  were  excluded  from  the  studies.  However, 
cardiac symptoms were reported in approximately 40% of subjects at baseline in both the placebo and 
active treatment groups. 
A full analysis of data concerning seizures has been presented as part of the applicant´s response to 
ground for refusal No. 2. 
CHMP position 
The  CHMP  considered  that  multiple  sclerosis  is  predominantly  a  disease  of  young  and  middle  aged 
adults. The applicant presented an analysis of adverse events by age (Table 26) showing there was no 
evidence of increasing frequency of events by age. The CHMP considered this finding unexpected as in 
the  clinical  trial  setting,  adverse  events  tend  to  be  more  common  in  the  elderly;  in  addition,  older 
patients  would  be  expected  to  have  more  advanced  disease  and  therefore  more  events  whether 
treatment  related  or  not. The  CHMP  considered  that  the  data  base  was  too  small  to  provide  a  robust 
analysis. Nevertheless, with precautions concerning a diminished renal function specified in the Product 
Information  (see  below)  and  measures  described  in  the  RMP  (study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  a  dose 
lower than 10 mg twice daily), the issue was considered to be resolved.  
SmPC Section 4.2: 
“Elderly  
Renal function should be checked before starting treatment with Fampyra.  Monitoring renal function to 
detect any renal impairment is recommended (see section 4.4).” 
SmPC Section 4.4 
“Determining  renal  function  before  treatment  and  its  regular  monitoring  during  treatment  is 
recommended in all patients (particularly the elderly in whom renal function might be reduced).” 
During  the  re-examination  procedure,  the  CHMP  considered  that  with  respect  to  patients  with 
cardiovascular disease a study evaluating potential effects on the ECG (i.e. conduction effects) did not 
identify any safety concerns and also in clinical trials there was only a small excess of cardiovascular 
events with active treatment. The CHMP agreed that the wording proposed by the applicant in section 
4.4 of the SmPC was appropriate: 
“Fampyra  should  be  administered  with  caution  to  patients  with  cardiovascular  symptoms  of  rhythm 
and  sinoatrial  or  atrioventricular  conduction  cardiac  disorders  (these  effects  are  seen  in  overdose).  
There is limited safety information in these patients.” 
Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  also  considered  that  given  the  known  mechanism  of  action,  patients  with 
cardiovascular  diseases  were  (as  a  precautionary  measure)  excluded  from  trials.  As  a  result,  there  is 
currently limited exposure in patients with known cardio-vascular diseases. The CHMP considered that 
the applicant´s approach to closely monitor these events in a post-authorisation safety study and in a 
clinical  trial  including  safety  assessment  in  patients  with  cardiovascular  compromise,  as  described  in 
the Risk Management Plan, was acceptable.  
The issue regarding risk of seizures was discussed under Ground for refusal No. 2, i.e. prior history or 
current  presentation  of  seizure  was  agreed  by  the  CHMP  to  be  included  as  a  contraindication.  This 
approach was also supported by the SAG. In this context, the CHMP considered that an observational 
study  further  quantifying  the  risk  of  seizure  will  be  conducted,  as  described  in  the  Risk  Management 
Plan. 
The CHMP considered the ground for refusal No. 4 was resolved with the measures implemented in the 
RMP.

Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) Neurology 
General comments to the CHMP:  
1) The applicant should formulate an indication best reflecting the target population for treatment with 
fampridine, taking into consideration the level of disability; and formulate responder selection criteria. 
2) Evaluation of efficacy in the clinical studies is difficult because there is no CHMP guideline available 
which the applicant can use for an assessment of symptomatic treatment. 
SAG input on the CHMP questions: 
1. Walking speed is an outcome that has been correlated with disability in MS. Could you comment on 
the significance of walking speed as a marker of global MS induced disability? What would constitute a 
clinically relevant difference, compared to placebo, for this marker? 
SAG  response:  It  is  self-evident  that  in  a  population  with  multiple  sclerosis,  the  global  disability  will 
correlate  with  a  reduction  in walking  speed.  The  SAG  has  not  seen  evidence  for  any  clear  correlation 
between  the  T25FW  and  quality  of  life  or  ADL  related  measures,  and  therefore  cannot  make  any 
reliable  conclusion.  Of  the  neurological  clinicians  in  the  group,  the  majority  accepted  that  a  20  % 
difference  compared  to  placebo  is  probably  clinically  relevant.  One  member  of  the  group  did  not 
consider 20 % as clinically relevant, since there was no robust evidence for an associated improvement 
in disability or quality of life-related measures. 
2.  In  MS  gait  and  walking  are  important  determinants  of  disability.  The  most  used  scale,  EDSS,  is 
heavily  weighted  by  these  items.  In  the  fampridine  development  patients  were  mostly  at  the  severe 
end  of  the  spectrum  of  EDSS,  i.e,  their  score  was  >6.  In  your  opinion,  what  are  the  treatment 
expectations  for  improvement  for  this  severely  disabled  patient  population  e.g.  in  terms  of 
preservation of mobility? 
SAG  response:  The  applicant  presented  data  on  small  subgroups  showing  that  the  EDSS  did  not 
influence  the  outcome  of  the  responder  analysis.  Nevertheless,  the  drug  should  not  be  prescribed 
without  the  patients  having  a  significant  level  of  walking  impairment,  which  the  applicant  should 
define. 
In severely disabled patients, impairment is at least in part due to axonal loss. If this prevails there is 
probably little room for any clinical improvement due to any pharmacological effect on K+ channels of 
the residual fibers (see also answer to question 4). 
3.  The  fampridine  trials  included,  as  a  secondary  endpoint,  a  patient  oriented  outcome  the  Multiple 
Sclerosis walking scale-12. We would like to have your comments about the validity of this outcome as 
measurement in MS. 
SAG  response:    The  group  regarded  MSWS-12  as  the  best  available  tool  for  patients  to  record 
subjective aspects of a range of their walking abilities. The correlation between the responder analysis 
for T25FW and a definition of response on MSWS-12 should be shown by the applicant. 
4. Would you consider it practical to evaluate the response to treatment at an individual level based on 
monitoring  of  response  by  means  of  the  timed  walking  test.  In  the  event  of  lack  of  response  when 
should treatment be stopped; is a delayed response likely?  
SAG  response:    The  group  recognized  that  any  such  test  must  have  clinical  utility,  and  should  be 
simple  to  use  in  clinical  practice.  In  general,  the  T25FW  before  and  within  2  weeks  after  starting 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011  
Page 84/89
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment was considered acceptable. The group has not seen any data on the timing of withdrawal of 
treatment to assess continued efficacy. 
The SAG considered that the development of clinical and/or biological profiles to improve identification 
of  responders  (e.g.  correlating  electrophysiological  variables  to  treatment  response)  would  be 
desirable. 
5.  Fampridine  was  associated  with  the  occurrence  of  neurological  adverse  effects,  in  particular 
seizures.    Could  you  comment  on  the  impact  of  this  risk  and  on  the  contraindication  for  fampridine 
patients with known seizures? 
SAG  response:  Although  the  SAG  recognized  that  seizures  occur  rarely  in  patients  treated  with 
fampridine, the further analyses presented by the applicant suggest that occurrence of seizures is not 
a major concern for the overall risk/benefit balance of the product. Pre-existing seizure disorder should 
be a contraindication to treatment with fampridine. 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination 
The  CHMP  assessed  the  detailed  grounds  for  re-examination  and  argumentation  presented  by  the 
applicant  in  writing  and  in  the  oral  explanation  and  considered  the  views  of  the  re-examination 
Scientific Advisory Group Neurology.  
The latest modified indication applied for by the applicant was 
“Fampyra  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with 
walking disability (EDSS 4-7).” 
With  the  re-examination,  the  CHMP  considered  whether  the  application  for  Fampyra  would  meet  the 
requirements  for  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation,  taking  into  account  the  public  health  interest 
and the fact that Fampyra is a medicinal product which aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating 
disease. 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 2001/83/Ec, 
is positive. 
At the end of the re-examination procedure the CHMP concluded on a favourable benefit-risk balance 
of  Fampyra.  The  CHMP  considered  that  approximately  one  third  of  patients  may  benefit  from  the 
treatment. The CHMP recognised that the product demonstrated benefits in terms of improving walking 
speed together with improvement on MSWS-12 (multiple-sclerosis walking scale score), i.e. a patient 
reported  outcome  measure.  Using  these  two  efficacy  outcome  measures,  for  which  a  certain  level  of 
relationship  was  observed,  the  CHMP  considered  that  it  was  possible  to  define  a  patient  population 
benefiting  from  treatment  with  fampridine  on  both  scales.  As  described  above  (CHMP  position  on 
ground  for  refusal  No.  1),  new  elements  were  brought  in  by  the  re-examination  SAG  Neurology;  in 
particular, the 20% improvement based on walking speed was suggested to be of potential relevance, 
if  correlated  to  patient-reported  outcome  measures.  Furthermore,  practical  approach  to  evaluating 
response to treatment on an individual level, based on monitoring of response by means of a walking 
test  as  suggested  by  the  SAG  Neurology,  was  accepted  by  the  CHMP  during  the  re-examination 
procedure. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP was of the opinion that the understanding of benefit provided by fampridine is 
not  completely  explained  by  the  data  currently  available;  in  particular,  other  important  aspects  of 
walking  such  as  balance,  endurance  and  walking  distance  that  constitute  additional  evidence  of 
improvement in the overall walking ability were regarded relevant. The CHMP considered that further 
data obtained in a controlled setting of a clinical trial are needed and that the validity of the currently 
ASSESSMENT REPORT  
EMA/555661/2011

proposed  criteria  for  identification  of  responders  should  be  further  evaluated.  Therefore,  the  CHMP 
requested that the marketing authorisation should be granted subject to a following condition:  
“To conduct a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a 
broader  primary  endpoint  clinically  meaningful  in  terms  of  walking  ability  and  to  further  evaluate  the 
early  identification  of  responders  in  order  to  guide  further  treatment.  The  study  report  is  to  be 
submitted by 30 June 2016.” 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  safety  profile  of  fampridine  is  dominated  by  adverse  events  related  to 
the  expression  of  CNS  overstimulation,  which  is  concordant  with  fampridine´s  mechanism  of  action 
and that these adverse events are dose-dependent. The CHMP noted that although the adverse events 
were  more  frequent  in  the  treated  group  in  the  clinical  trials,  they  rarely  led  to  discontinuation  and 
were  rated  as  mild  and  transitory.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  main  safety  issue  among  events 
related to overstimulation were seizures, because of the level of seriousness as a health event.  
The  data  presented  by  the  applicant  did  not  allow  for  quantifying  the  true  incidence  of  seizures 
associated with fampridine, but the added risk level was considered low and dose-dependent (some of 
the events observed were related to medication errors associated with overdose). In their meeting, the 
re-examination SAG Neurology discussed the seizure risk and recognized that seizures occur rarely in 
patients treated with fampridine, further data presented by the applicant suggesting that occurrence of 
seizures is not a major concern for the overall benefit-risk balance of the product. The SAG Neurology 
recommended  that  pre-existing  seizure  disorder  should  be  a  contraindication  to  treatment  with 
fampridine.  The  CHMP  took  the  SAG  Neurology  recommendation  into  account  and  furthermore,  also 
considered  that  literature§  and  the  applicant´s  data  from  clinical  studies  with  other  multiple  sclerosis 
products (disease-modifying drugs) providing evidence on the background incidence of seizures in MS 
patients were re-assuring in terms of fampridine´s low level of the added risk. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  current  therapeutic  dose  is  border-line  and  that  any  increase  (e.g. 
overdose) might put patients at higher risk of seizures. In this context, the CHMP considered that an 
observational  study  further  quantifying  the  risk  of  seizure  will  be  conducted,  as  described  in  the  Risk 
Management Plan. 
Unmet medical needs will be fulfilled 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefits  of  Fampyra  were  observed  in  the  field  of  symptomatic 
treatment of multiple sclerosis, where there is no other drug approved. In this context, Fampyra was 
considered  to  address  an  unmet  medical  need  by  providing  symptomatic  treatment  for  walking 
impairment in patients with MS. 
The  CHMP  further  considered  that  given  the  lack  of  symptomatic  treatment  in  MS,  extemporaneous 
formulations  of  4-aminopyridine  are  in  use,  which  might  be  of  lower  quality  standards  and  also  pose 
safety problems linked to limited control over their dosing. The formulation of Fampyra, i.e. prolonged-
release  tablets,  was  considered  to  tackle  these  problems.  Thus,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  placing 
Fampyra on the market would help address the unmet medical need. 
The  benefit  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  on  the  market  of  the  medicinal  product 
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  overall,  approximately  one  third  of  patients  treated  might  get  a  relevant 
benefit from the treatment and, in the context of the unmet medical need described above, concluded 
on  a  benefit  of  the  immediate  availability  of  Fampyra  on  the  market.  The  CHMP  also  considered  that 
patients benefiting form the treatment can be identified on the basis of their response at an early stage

and  that  treatment  can  be  discontinued  in  patients  not  benefiting,  hence  preventing  unnecessary 
exposure. The CHMP was of the opinion that data currently not available and required additionally, i.e 
from a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, long-term efficacy and safety study to investigate a broader 
primary  endpoint  clinically  meaningful  in  terms  of  walking  ability  and  to  further  evaluate  the  early 
identification of responders in order to guide further treatment do not preclude concluding on a positive 
benefit-risk balance for the target population.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a quality issue that will be resolved as Follow-up Measure 
within an agreed timeframe. This issue relates to confirming the in-use period to product close to the 
end of the shelf-life. However, this issue was not expected to have a negative impact on the benefit-
risk balance of the product. 
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  confirmed  that  the  criteria  needed  for  granting  a  Conditional  Marketing 
Authorisation have been met. 
Risk Management Plan 
SUMMARY of the EU risk management plan 
Safety concern 
Proposed 
Pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Proposed risk minimization activities 
Significant Known Risk 
Seizure 
Routine 
pharmacovigilance 
Routine risk minimization by referencing safety 
concerns in SmPC and PIL:- 
Observational Study 
Preclinical seizure 
threshold study 
Contraindication of fampridine in patients with prior 
history or current presentation of seizure (SmPC 
4.3); 
Special warning on cautious use of fampridine in 
the presence of any factors which may lower 
seizure threshold and on discontinuation of 
fampridine in patients who experience a seizure 
while on treatment (SmPC 4.4); 
Seizure is reported as uncommon adverse reaction 
in randomised controlled clinical studies, in open 
label long term studies and in the post marketing 
setting (SmPC 4.8); 
Seizure is listed as one of the acute symptoms of 
overdose with fampridine (SmPC 4.9). 
Indication to limit continued use of fampridine to 
those patients showing response early in treatment 
(SmPC 4.2). 
Calendar blister packaging 
Prescribing limited to specialist neurologist

Observational Study 
Routine risk minimization by referencing safety 
concerns in SmPC and PI. 
SmPC 4.4: Special warning and precautions for 
use: “Fampyra should not be administered to 
patients with renal impairment” 
SmPC 5.2: Pharmacokinetic properties - Special 
populations: 
“Fampyra must not be administered to patients 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment” 
“Fampyra is primarily excreted unchanged by the 
kidneys, and with creatinine clearance known to 
decrease with age, monitoring of renal function in 
elderly patients should be considered” 
Pregnancy Registry 
Routine risk minimization by referencing safety 
concerns in SmPC and PI. 
SmPC 4.6: Fertility, pregnancy and lactation: 
 “There are no data from the use of fampridine in 
pregnant women. 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is 
preferable to avoid the use of Fampyra in 
pregnancy”.

The MAA submitted a revised risk management plan. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  was  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product  information, 
calendar blister packaging and restricting prescription to specialist neurologists. 
Recommendation following re-examination 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  re-examined  its  initial 
opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the benefit-risk balance of Fampyra 
in the following indication:  
“Fampyra  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult  patients  with  multiple  sclerosis  with 
walking disability (EDSS 4-7).”

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

H/C/000334/II/0127’ 
currently listed conditions) of purpura fulminans and 
coumarin induced skin necrosis in patients with 
severe congenital protein C deficiency, based on a 
re-analysis of long-term prophylaxis data from the 
pivotal Study 400101; a phase 2/3 clinical study 
undertaken to evaluate PK, safety and efficacy of 
CEPROTIN in 
patients with severe congenital PC deficiency for the 
treatment of acute thrombotic episodes, for short-
term thromboembolic prophylaxis and for long-term 
prophylactic treatment. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated and the 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement 
minor editorial changes in sections 4.4 and 4.8 the 
SmPC and Package Leaflet.  
Version 2.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. In 
addition, MAH took the opportunity to correct the 
address of the manufacturer of the biological active 
substance in Annex II following variation

The events occurred occasionally after some therapy 
episodes and resolved the day after infusion. This event 
was evaluated with a probable causal relationship between 
the use of the medicinal product and injection site reaction 
(temporal association and positive rechallenge). The ADR 
has been added to the post-marketing experience in SmPC 
section 4.8 with the frequency of 'not known'. Section 4 of 
the package leaflet has been updated accordingly.

4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC to include information on dosing in 
paediatric patients as follows: 
"Based on the limited clinical experience in children from 
reports and studies covering 83 patients, dosing guidelines 
for adult subjects are considered valid for neonatal and 
paediatric patient population (see section 5.1). 
In rare and exceptional cases, subcutaneous infusion of 
250-350 IU/kg was able to produce therapeutic protein C 
plasma levels in patients with no intravenous access." 
Further details on the reports and studies in paediatric 
patients are also included in section 5.1 of the SPC. 
In addition, a slight linguistic adjustment to section 4.8 of 
the SPC was made in order to clarify the assignment of 
three reported ADRs to one single patient. 
The contact details for Spain in the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet has also been 
updated.

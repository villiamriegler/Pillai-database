are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic 
dose was associated with low fertility when 
administered prior and during mating in male and 
female rats and foetal toxicity in rats. 
Paclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into 
the milk of lactating rats. Following intravenous 
administration of radiolabelled paclitaxel to rats on 
days 9 to 10 postpartum, concentrations of 
radioactivity in milk were higher than in plasma and 
declined in parallel with the plasma concentrations.

potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. 
Consequently sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1

4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated with a

recommendations on dose adjustments for patients 
with hepatic and renal impairment based on the 
conclusions of new population pharmacokinetics 
analysis and PPK/PD modelling using data obtained 
from 8 clinical trials of Abraxane in patients with 
advanced solid tumours. The existing warning on 
hepatic impairment in section 4.4 of the SmPC is also 
amended accordingly.

regardless of indication. Treat with same doses as patients 
with normal hepatic function. For metastatic breast cancer 
patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN), a 20% 
reduction in dose is recommended. The reduced dose may 
be escalated to the dose for patients with normal hepatic

least two cycles (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). For patients

moderate to severe hepatic impairment, there are 
insufficient data to permit dosage recommendations. For 
patients with total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN, 
there are insufficient data to permit dosage 
recommendations regardless of indication. 
Adjustment of the starting Abraxane dose is not required 
for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min). There 
are insufficient data available to recommend dose 
modifications of Abraxane in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end stage renal disease (estimated 
creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data 
from 125 patients with advanced solid tumours indicates 
that patients ≥65 years of age may be more susceptible to 
development of neutropenia within the first treatment 
cycle. Population pharmacokinetic analyses for Abraxane 
indicate that gender, race (Asian vs. White), and type of 
solid tumours do not have a clinically important effect on 
systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel.  Patients 
weighing 50 kg had paclitaxel AUC approximately 25% 
lower than those weighing 75 kg. The clinical relevance of 
this finding is uncertain. 
Following Abraxane administration to patients with solid 
tumours, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and 
plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the total 
volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large 
volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular 
distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel.

should not be administered, if particulate matter is 
observed in the vial. The use of medical devices containing 
silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to 
reconstitute and administer Abraxane may result in the 
formation of such proteinaceous strands. Abraxane should 
be administered using an infusion set incorporating a 15 
µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use of 
such filter removes strands and does not change the 
physical or chemical properties of the reconstituted 
product. Use of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may

clinical trial reports (or from other reports) on the 
reversibility of alopecia caused by Abraxane. Section 4.8 of

alopecia events occurred less than one month after 
initiation of Abraxane and that pronounced hair loss

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
results showed significant differences in pharmacokinetic 
parameters in Chinese patients compared to Caucasians. 
However, these differences were attributed to differences in 
body weight and not to ethnic factors. An analysis of 
patient exposure (AUCinf) against body weight indicated a 
trend toward reduced AUC at 260 mg/m2 Abraxane, with 
decreased body weight. Patients weighing 50 kg had 
paclitaxel AUC approximately 25% lower than those 
weighing 75 kg. The clinical relevance of this finding is 
uncertain.

'left ventricular dysfunction' and 'congestive heart failure'

the SmPC was reworded to strengthen the relationship 
between administration of Abraxane and cardiotoxicity. The 
term 'pancytopenia' was added to the ADRs table of SmPC

SPC Section 5.2: 
In a repeat dose study with 12 patients receiving Abraxane 
administered intravenously at the approved dose, 
intrapatient variability in systemic paclitaxel exposure 
(AUCinf) was 19% (range = 3.21%-27.70%). There was no 
evidence for accumulation of paclitaxel with multiple 
treatment courses. 
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane was 
evaluated by ultrafiltration. The fraction of free paclitaxel 
was significantly higher with Abraxane (6.2%) than with 
solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This resulted in 
significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with 
Abraxane compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, even 
though the total exposure is comparable.  This is possibly 
due to paclitaxel not being trapped in Cremophor EL 
micelles as with solvent-based paclitaxel. 
SPC section 4.5: 
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see 
section 5.2). Therefore, caution should be exercised when 
administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines 
known to inhibit (e.g. ketoconazole and other imidazole 
antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, 
cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) 
or induce (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
efavirenz, nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.

This type II variation concerned an update of sections 4.2, 
4.2, 4.4, and 5.2 of the SPC in line with the results of 
Study CA037 performed to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic 
impairment. The MAH also proposed to move the 
existing statement on the use of contraception from 
section 4.4 to 4.6 of the SPC and to make a minor 
change to section 5.1 for increased clarity. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
4.4, and 5.2 of the SPC in line with the results of Study 
CA037 performed to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of Abraxane administered as a 
30 minute infusion was evaluated in 15 out of 30 patients 
with three levels of hepatic impairment based on serum 
bilirubin and liver enzyme levels.  
Since the toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with 
hepatic impairment, administration of Abraxane in patients 
with hepatic impairment should be performed with caution. 
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk 
Page 33/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression, and such 
patients should be closely monitored for development of 
profound myelosuppression.  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 5 x 
ULN or ASL/ALT > 10 x ULN) have not been studied and 
should not be treated with Abraxane. The appropriate dose 
regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is 
unknown.  A dose reduction in patients with bilirubin >2 
ULN must be considered since paclitaxel clearance is 
decreased in patients with high bilirubin levels. 
In addition, the CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal to 
move the existing statement on the use of contraception 
from section 4.4 of the SPC to section 4.6: 
"Sexually active men and women should use effective 
methods of contraception during treatment and up to six 
months after treatment for men, and one month after 
treatment for women." 
Finally, the CHMP agreed with the MAH's proposal to add 
the following information to section 5.1 of the SPC for 
increased clarity: 
"Abraxane contains human serum albumin paclitaxel 
nanoparticles, where the paclitaxel is present in a non-
crystalline, amorphous state."

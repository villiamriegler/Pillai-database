The risk of heart failure was found to be higher in the 
(ZOL446H2422) listed as a category 3 study in the 
zolendronic acid group compared with subjects treated with

RMP. This is a non-interventional post-authorisation 
safety study using health registries to compare 
safety of Aclasta against oral bisphosphonates and 
untreated population controls. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
oral bisphosphonates, (HR 1.21 95% CI 1.09;1.34) and 
compared with matched, untreated background population 
subjects (HR 1.39 95% CI 1.25;1.55). The association 
remained with a similar magnitude when adjusted for age, 
previous fractures, comorbidities and previous medication 
(HR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.49). Considering the modest 
risk estimates and likely remaining unmeasured 
confounding in this observational study, the totality of the 
data is not sufficient to conclude that the risk of heart 
failure is possibly related to Aclasta use or to support an 
increase in other cardiovascular outcomes associated with 
Aclasta. 
The incidence of fracture non-union/delayed union in the 
observational study was over three times higher compared 
to untreated subjects and did not substantially change after 
adjustments of previous fractures. Currently, fracture non-
union/delayed union is an important potential risk in the 
Aclasta risk management plan. Higher baseline risk of 
fractures inflates the apparent risk of fracture complications 
such as fracture nonunion or delayed union. Consequently, 
the increased risk of fracture non-union or delayed union in 
the actual study cannot be related to Aclasta with such 
reasonable possibility that would require change in the 
product information. 
The risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was higher in 
zoledronic acid treated patients compared to oral 
bisphosphonates initiators. This is in line with the current 
information in the Aclasta SmPC regarding considerations 
when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ. In 
addition, the current additional risk minimisation measures 
for Aclasta include a patient reminder card on ONJ. 
Cardiovascular mortality was not reported with an 
Page 6/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased frequency in zoledronic acid users either in the 
pooled randomised clinical trials or in the observational 
study ZOL446H2422. In contrast, all-cause mortality was 
slightly increased in zoledronic acid treated subjects 
compared to oral bisphosphonates inhibitors HR 1.15 
(1.07-1.24) and also compared to untreated subjects HR 
1.1 (1.02-1.18) in the selected model in ZOL446H2422. 
The estimates suggesting an increased risk for all-cause 
mortality are weak and consequently sensitive to remaining 
confounding from patient frailty. The data suggest some 
remaining imbalance between the compared groups in 
fracture history. The mortality analyses in detail from the 
two large pivotal studies 2301 and 2310 do not provide 
sufficient support for a causal link to increased all-cause 
mortality. 
Based on the review of the study results, the benefit/risk 
balance of zolendronic acid (Aclasta) remains unchanged 
for the approved indications and no changes are warranted 
in the product information.

A final study report was submitted for a 3-year 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind 
extension study carried out in order to further assess the 
efficacy and long term safety of zoledronic acid in 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis after taking up 
to 9 annual doses of Aclasta (Group Z9) as well as to 
characterize the durability of effect in patients who have 
received up to 6 annual doses of zoledronic acid followed 
by up to 3 annual doses of placebo (Group Z6P3).  
Comparisons were made between the continuous use of 
zoledronic acid for 9 years (Z9 treatment group) and the 
use of zoledronic acid for 6 years followed by 3 years of 
placebo (Z6P3 treatment group).  
Treatment differences in total hip BMD and femoral neck 
BMD were numerically in favor of the Z9 treatment group 
compared to the Z6P3 group but differences were small 
and not likely to be clinically important. No significant 
differences were observed between Z9 and Z6P3 treatment 
groups in the risk of clinical, vertebral, non-vertebral and 
morphometric vertebral fractures. 
Post-dose symptom adverse events (AEs), Cardiac 
arrhythmia AEs and renal laboratory abnormality were 
more frequent in the Z9 treatment group compared to the 
Z6P3 group. These adverse events are labelled. No new 
safety findings have been identified. The benefit/risk 
balance remains unchanged. 
The small number of patients in the study may have limited 
the ability to detect differences in efficacy parameters

osteoporosis has not been established. The need for 
continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically 
based on the benefits and potential risks of Aclasta on an 
individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years 
of use.” The current wording is sufficient to inform the 
prescribers about the uncertainties of long-term use of 
Aclasta.

precautions as requested by the CHMP further to 
II, Labelling 
Aclasta Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR 9), the MAH 
assessment of PSUR 9: alignment of SmPC with the 
and PL 
was requested to further align the SmPC information with 
Company Core Data Sheet to include observation of 
acute renal failure after a single administration, and 
to advise calculation of creatinine clearance based 
upon actual body weight using the Cockroft -Gault 
formula prior to each dose. Accordingly update of 
physician educational material, also reflecting 
increased risk in subjects of advanced age.  
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD Template version 9, including editorial 
changes to improve readability. The Package Leaflet 
and Labelling are updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet 
(Croatia, Luxemburg and Malta). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
the US Product Information (USPI) and with the company 
Core Data Sheet (CDS) with the following information: 1) 
to report the observation of acute renal failure after a 
single administration; 2) to advise the calculation of CrCl 
based upon actual body weight using the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula before each Aclasta dose.  The MAH was also asked 
to reflect in the physician educational material the 
increased risk for subjects of advanced age and the advice 
to calculate CrCl using the Cockcroft-Gault formula prior to 
each dose. These changes to the Product information and 
educational key messages were agreed by the CHMP during 
the current variation. The CHMP also agreed to the 
proposed changes to align with the latest QRD Template 
(version 9), editorial changes, and update of the local 
representatives.

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Aclasta continues 
to be favourable.  
Because of several safety concerns, such as adverse effects 
on renal function and the potential risks of osteonecrosis of 
the jaw and atypical stress fractures with long term

treatment, the benefit-risk balance of Aclasta should be re-
evaluated on a regular basis in PSURs or when new 
relevant information becomes available. 
The MAH should submit 1- yearly PSURs 
Therefore, based on the safety profile of Aclasta, which 
requires submission of 1-yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

controlled multicentre study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of zoledronic acid in the treatment of osteoporosis 
in postmenopausal women 65-89 years of age (n=7,736) 
were submitted in support of this variation. The results 
showed that patients treated with zoledronic acid exhibited 
a threefold greater incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) 
reported as a serious adverse event compared to patients 
receiving placebo. A statistically significant increase in the 
risk of all atrial fibrillation events (serious and non-serious) 
was not demonstrated, and an ECG study in a subgroup of 
patients did not reveal any differences between the 
zoledronic acid and placebo groups. The events did not 
occur early after infusion, when drug concentrations in 
serum were the highest. 
It was however considered unlikely that this finding was 
due to chance considering the size of the study. Post-
marketing reports cannot be considered a sensitive 
measure for this adverse event, as AF is very common in 
the elderly population and until now would not have been 
suspected to be related to bisphosphonates. Section 4.8 of

Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.4  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported predominantly 
in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens 
including bisphosphonates. Many of these patients were 
also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids. The 
majority of reported cases have been associated with 
dental procedures such as tooth extraction. Many had signs 
of local infection including osteomyelitis. 
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry 
should be considered prior to treatment with 
bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors 
(e.g. cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral 
hygiene).  
While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive 
dental procedures if possible. For patients who develop 
osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, 
dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients 
requiring dental  procedure, there are no data available to 
suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate 
treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. The 
clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide 
the management plan of each patient based on individual 
benefit/risk assessment.

Uncommonly, cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of the jaw) 
have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients 
treated with bisphosphonates. Many of these patients had 
signs of local infection including osteomyelitis, and the 
majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following 
tooth extractions or other dental surgeries. Osteonecrosis 
of the jaw has multiple well documented risk factors 
including a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g. 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids) and co-
morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection, 
pre-existing dental disease). Although causality has not 
been determined, it is prudent to avoid dental surgery as 
recovery may be prolonged (see section 4.4).

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for ceftaroline fosamil, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Temporal relationships with ceftaroline are noted in the majority of the 17 reported cases of 
eosinophilia, together with positive dechallenge specifically after ceftaroline withdrawal in 3 cases. 
Eosinophilia is a listed event for other cephalosporin antibacterials and the EU SmPC for ceftaroline 
already lists several blood dyscrasias including leucopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ceftaroline fosamil the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ceftaroline fosamil is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

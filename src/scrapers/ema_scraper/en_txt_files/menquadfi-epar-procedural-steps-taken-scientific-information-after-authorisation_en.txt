1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC in order to add long term antibody persistence 
at least 3 years after primary vaccination, 
immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of 
MenQuadfi in adolescents, adults, and older adults, 
as well as co-administration data with meningococcal 
serogroup B vaccine in adolescents and adults, in 
order to fulfil ANX/002 and ANX/003 based on final 
results from studies MET59 and MEQ00066, 
respectively, listed as Annex-II obligations. MET59 is 
a phase 3b, open-label, partially randomized, 
parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-center study 
evaluating the immunogenicity and safety of a 
booster dose of an investigational quadrivalent 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine in adolescents and 
adults, while MEQ00066 is a phase 3, two-stage, 
randomized, open-label, multi-center trial evaluating 
the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of 
MenACYW conjugate vaccine at least 3 years 
following initial vaccination with either Menomune 
vaccine or MenACYW conjugate vaccine in older 
adults. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 1.2 has also 
been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to 
the PI.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

- Section 4.2. 
Posology 
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination 
with MenQuadfi are available up to 7 years after 
vaccination (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
- Section 4.4. 
Protection 
Waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against 
serogroup A when using human complement in the assay 
(hSBA) has been reported for MenQuadfi […]. However, if 
an individual is expected to be at particular risk of exposure 
to serogroup A and received a dose of MenQuadfi more 
than approximately one year previously, consideration may 
be given to administering a booster dose. 
- Section 4.5: 
Use with other vaccines 
There was no impact on the immune response to 
MenQuadfi when a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine was 
co-administered. 
- Section 4.8. 
Summary of the safety profile 
In one additional clinical study, adolescents and adults 13-
26 years of age primed with MenQuadfi 3-6 years 
previously received MenQuadfi co-administered with 
meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) vaccine, Trumenba 
(N=93) or Bexsero (N=92).  
Rates and intensity of systemic reactions within 7 days 
following vaccination tended to be higher when MenQuadfi 
was given concomitantly with MenB vaccine than when 
MenQuadfi was given alone. The most common solicited 
systemic reaction was myalgia, of mild intensity, which was

data 
experienced more frequently in adolescents and adults who 
received MenQuadfi and MenB vaccine concomitantly 
(Trumenba, 65.2%; Bexsero, 63%) compared to those who 
received MenQuadfi alone (32.8%). 
- Section 5.1. 
Immunogenicity 
Antibody persistence after primary vaccination and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose was assessed in three 
studies in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents and 
adults (13-26 years of age), and older adults (≥59 years of 
age).    
Clinical data on the persistence of antibody response ≥3 
years after primary vaccination with MenQuadfi in children 
(4-5 years of age), adolescents and adults (13-26 years of 
age), and older adults (≥ 59 years of age) are available. 
Clinical data on booster vaccination with MenQuadfi in 
those subjects are also available.

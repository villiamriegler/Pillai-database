1.  Background information on the procedure 
Referral of the matter to the CHMP 
On the 20 July 2015, the Netherlands informed the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the 
European Commission (EC), on the draft statement of GMP non-compliance issued at the beginning of 
July 2015 for the manufacturer (Integra LifeSciences Corporation) of the absorbable collagen sponge 
(ACS), an excipient of the centrally authorised product, InductOs.  
The final statement of non-compliance was issued and entered in the Community database by the 
Netherlands (IGZ) in accordance with Article 111 (7) of Directive 2001/83/EC on 23 July 2015.  
On 23 July 2015, the EC initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and 
requested the Agency to assess the above concerns and their impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
InductOs and whether the relevant marketing authorisation should be maintained, varied, suspended 
or revoked. 
The EC also asked the CHMP on 23 July 2015 to consider if there was a need to take provisional 
measures to be applied immediately, notably a withdrawal from the market and/or suspension of the 
marketing authorisation. 
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Introduction 
InductOs is a kit for implant authorised centrally since 2002 for single-level lumbar interbody spine 
fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had 
at least 6 months of non-operative treatment for this condition. InductOs is also indicated for the 
treatment of acute tibia fractures in adults, as an adjunct to standard care using open fracture 
reduction and intramedullary unreamed nail fixation. 
The kit consists of a powder containing the active substance, dibotermin alfa, a solvent and a matrix 
(absorbable collagen sponge, ACS). This has to be applied to the sponge which is thereafter implanted 
into patients. ACS has been classified as an excipient of InductOs. As such it is consequently inspected 
against EU-GMP guidelines. 
The manufacturer of the ACS, Integra LifeSciences Corporation (ILS), located in a third country (i.e. 
USA), was inspected last in April 2015 by the Netherlands and Spain and found to be not compliant 
with the legal requirements and/or the principles and guidelines of GMP as provided for by Union law.  
The main concern identified was potential for particulate contamination. 
During the previous inspection (January 2014) a number of major deficiencies were already identified. 
It was decided that a re-inspection would be done after one year to assess the progress in eliminating 
the major deficiencies. At that time, following a corrective action plan, a restricted GMP certificate valid 
until January 2015 was issued. As mentioned above, the April 2015 inspection found that the 
corrective action plan failed and the contamination of ACS with particulate matter was not under 
control and the quality system not aiming for continuous improvement. 
Consequently, the Netherlands issued a draft statement of GMP non–compliance for this manufacturer 
which is the only existent one.

The final statement of non-compliance was issued and entered in the Community database by the 
Netherlands (IGZ) in accordance with Article 111 (7) of Directive 2001/83/EC on 23 July 2015. This 
action determined that no new batches of InductOs could be produced nor released in the EU. A 
shortage of supply was expected from November 2015. 
An Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was initiated by the EC on 23 July 2015 for the above 
concerns and their impact on the benefit-risk balance of InductOs to be determined and to decide if the 
relevant marketing authorisation should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
On 23 July, the CHMP considered the need to take provisional measures to be applied immediately, 
notably a withdrawal from the market and/or suspension of the marketing authorisation, as requested 
by the EC.  
The CHMP noted that, following the inspection in April 2015, no batches of InductOs had been released 
in the EU as recommended by the inspectors. The latest batch was released in January 2015 into the 
EU market, thus prior to the above inspection. 
From a public health perspective, there was no indication of risks to patients linked to the inspection 
findings. Therefore, and taking into account the assessment of the latest PSUR for InductOs dated April 
2015 showing no signals in this regard, the CHMP was of the view that there was no need to adopt 
provisional measures for InductOs.  
Healthcare professionals using InductOs were advised to follow the instructions in the product 
information as usual and a Direct Health Care Professional Communication (DHPC) was adopted and 
agreed to be distributed on 12 August by the MAH.  
On 23 July 2015, the CHMP also adopted a list of questions to be addressed by the MAH. The summary 
of the MAH responses is hereafter presented. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
A qualitative analysis was done on the sponge (ACS) resulting in a list of potentially contaminating 
elements. The identified contamination of the sponge are hairs, fibres, salts and metal particles. This 
was supplemented by a quantitative analysis of the metal content of the sponge. A toxicological 
analysis of the results concluded that these particles do not represent a risk for the safety of patients. 
The MAH submitted the results of the report regarding particulates and root cause analysis (Particulate 
and Root Cause Analysis for ACS Particulate Reduction R-NJ-2015-0120), the updated Failure Mode 
and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and the updated Corrective Actions and Preventive Actions (CAPA).  
Based on the root cause analysis and FMEA, a set of actions have been defined to reduce risk and 
establish control with regard to particulate contamination for the manufacturing process of ACS in the 
current manufacturing facility. 
The CAPA focusses on the equipment as a source of particulate matter (metal). Several pieces of the 
equipment (grinder, dispersion tank and cutting equipment) will be replaced before April 2016. 
It is therefore expected that by April 2016, the majority of CAPAs identified by Integra to address the 
findings of the April 2015 GMP inspection will be implemented.

The CHMP noted that the conclusions of the inspection report are covered in the CAPA and their 
acceptability is to be assessed in a future GMP inspection.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
The CHMP noted that adverse event reports from clinical trials and spontaneous reporting data 
analysed and submitted by the MAH are either not related to the contaminations or are expected 
reactions that can occur at the site of surgery and causality with InductOs cannot be ascertain. 
Quality complaints reports (10) describing potential contamination of the ACS with particulate matter 
(6 mentioning human hair, 3 cases of a coloured spot and 1 case of a glue-like substance) were also 
noted.  
No safety concerns have been identified associated with the potential contamination of ACS with 
particulate matter.  
3.  Conclusion and Grounds for the recommendation 
The CHMP, having considered all the data provided by the MAH, considers that there is no apparent 
identified safety concern nor seems to be a risk to patients associated with the contamination of the 
ACS with particulate matter. However the CHMP also noted that although the findings may not pose a 
risk to the patients, the sponge should not include any other unwanted components/contaminants and 
the MAH must undertake efforts to remove these and comply with the legal obligations. 
It was noted that alternative treatments are available, including the use of autogenous bone grafts, 
which are usually harvested from the iliac crest. No other ‘morphogenetic proteins’ (such as InductOs) 
are available in the EU but substances known as ‘graft extenders’ reduce the required amount of bone 
graft (but not completely replace the grafts). Several such products are available, both derived from 
human donor tissue and from ceramics.  
For the treatment of tibia fractures, fixation with a reamed nail instead of InductOs plus unreamed nail 
fixation is an alternative option. Standard of care in the EU consists of surgical intervention using 
reamed or unreamed intramedullary nailing with locking screws. 
Given the findings, the CHMP considered that the quality of InductOs cannot be assured at present due 
to the lack of GMP compliance of the ACS issued on 23 July 2015. Therefore, at present the positive 
benefit-risk cannot be confirmed. 
On the basis of the above and taking into account that InductOs has no alternative ACS manufacturing 
site authorised:  
- The CHMP considers that at present the particulars and documents provided for in Article 8(3) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, are incorrect; 
- The CHMP considers that the absence of GMP compliance of the manufacturing site of the absorbable 
collagen sponge, part of the medicinal product precludes at present the confirmation of the benefit-risk 
of InductOs; 
As a consequence, the CHMP recommends the suspension of the marketing authorisation for InductOs 
in accordance with Article 116, second paragraph of the said Directive. 
The CHMP also considers that no product is recommended to be recalled from the market, as the 
current product on the market was released under a valid GMP certificate in January 2015. No further 
Assessment report

product was released after the GMP non-compliance certificate was issued and the latest information 
on stock indicates that InductOs will be available until end of December 2015.  
4.  Condition for lifting the suspension of the marketing 
authorisation 
For the suspension to be lifted, the Marketing Authorisation Holder shall provide the following: 
•  A valid GMP compliance statement for the manufacturer of the ACS, fulfilling the requirements 
set out in Article 46 of Directive 2001/83/EC.

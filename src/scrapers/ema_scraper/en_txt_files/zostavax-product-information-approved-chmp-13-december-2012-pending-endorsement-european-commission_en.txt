For precautions before handling or administering the medicinal product see section 6.6. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
 
 
 
 
 
History of hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients or trace residuals (e.g., 
neomycin) (see sections 4.4 and 6.1). 
Primary and acquired immunodeficiency states due to conditions such as: acute and chronic 
leukaemias; lymphoma; other conditions affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system; 
immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS; cellular immune deficiencies. 
Immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose corticosteroids); however, ZOSTAVAX is not 
contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose 
systemic corticosteroids or in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, 
e.g., for adrenal insufficiency (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Active untreated tuberculosis. 
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see 
section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction following the administration of the vaccine, as there is a possibility of 
hypersensitivity reactions, not only to the active substances, but also to the excipients and trace residuals 
(e.g. neomycin) present in the vaccine (see sections 4.3, 4.8 and 6.1). 
Neomycin allergy generally manifests as a contact dermatitis. However, a history of contact dermatitis due 
to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving live virus vaccines. 
ZOSTAVAX is not indicated for treatment of zoster or PHN. 
Deferral of vaccination should be considered in the presence of fever. 
As for any vaccine, vaccination with ZOSTAVAX may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. 
See section 5.1. 
The safety and efficacy of ZOSTAVAX have not been established in adults who are known to be infected 
with HIV with or without evidence of immunosuppression (see section 4.3). 
Transmission  
In clinical trials with ZOSTAVAX, transmission of the vaccine virus has not been reported. However, 
post-marketing experience with varicella vaccines suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur 
rarely between vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and susceptible contacts (for example, VZV-
susceptible infant grandchildren). Transmission of vaccine virus from varicella vaccine recipients who do 
not develop a varicella-like rash has also been reported. This is a theoretical risk for vaccination with 
ZOSTAVAX. The risk of transmitting the attenuated vaccine virus from a vaccinee to a susceptible 
contact should be weighed against the risk of developing natural zoster and potentially transmitting wild-
type VZV to a susceptible contact.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
ZOSTAVAX can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine as separate injections 
and at different body sites (see section 5.1). 
ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be given concomitantly 
because concomitant use in a clinical trial resulted in reduced immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX (see 
section 5.1). 
No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. 
Concurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and anti-viral medications known to be effective against VZV 
has not been evaluated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies in pregnant women. It is also not known whether ZOSTAVAX can cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. However naturally-occurring 
varicella-zoster virus infection is known to sometimes cause foetal harm. As ZOSTAVAX is not indicated 
in individuals less than 50 years of age, ZOSTAVAX is not intended to be administered to pregnant 
women. In any case, pregnancy should be avoided for one month following vaccination (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether VZV is secreted in human milk. Therefore, because some viruses are secreted in 
human milk, caution should be exercised if ZOSTAVAX is administered to a breast-feeding woman. 
Fertility 
ZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated in fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. However, 
ZOSTAVAX is expected to have no or negligible influence on ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials, ZOSTAVAX has been evaluated for general safety in more than 32000 adults. 
Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older  
In the largest of these trials, the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), 38546 subjects received a single dose of 
either the frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX (n=19270) or placebo (n=19276) and were monitored for 
safety throughout the study. During the study, vaccine-related serious adverse reactions were reported for 
2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (asthma exacerbation and polymyalgia rheumatica) and 3 
subjects who received placebo (Goodpasture’s syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, and polymyalgia 
rheumatica). 
In the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy, a subgroup of individuals from the SPS (n=3345 received 
ZOSTAVAX and n=3271 received placebo) were provided vaccination report cards to record adverse 
events occurring from Days 0 to 42 post vaccination in addition to undergoing routine safety monitoring 
throughout the study.

The vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater 
incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy are 
listed in Table 1. Most of these adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. Table 1 also includes 
additional adverse events which have been reported spontaneously through post-marketing surveillance. 
The overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions was significantly greater for 
subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo (48% for ZOSTAVAX and 
17% for placebo). 
The remainder of subjects in the SPS received routine safety monitoring, but were not provided report 
cards. The types of events reported in these patients were generally similar to the subgroup of patients in 
the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy. 
Within the 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the SPS, the number of reported zosteriform rashes 
among all subjects was small (17 for ZOSTAVAX, 36 for placebo; p=0.009). Of these 53 zosteriform 
rashes, 41 had specimens that were available and adequate for PCR testing. Wild-type VZV was detected 
in 25 (5 for ZOSTAVAX, 20 for placebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not 
detected from any of these specimens. 
Within the same 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the SPS, the number (n=59) of reported 
varicella-like rashes was also small. Of these varicella-like rashes, 10 had specimens that were available 
and adequate for PCR testing. VZV was not detected in any of these specimens. 
ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age 
In the ZEST study, subjects received a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX (n=11,184) or placebo 
(n=11,212) and were monitored for safety throughout the study. During the study, a vaccine-related 
serious adverse experience was reported for 1 subject vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (anaphylactic 
reaction). 
All subjects received a vaccination report card (VRC) to record adverse events occurring from Days 1 to 
42 postvaccination in addition to undergoing routine safety monitoring throughout the study. 
The vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse experiences reported in the ZEST study are 
presented in Table 1. Table 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been reported 
spontaneously through post-marketing surveillance. 
The overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse experiences was significantly greater for 
subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo (63.9% for ZOSTAVAX and 
14.4% for placebo). Most of these adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. 
Within the 42-day post vaccination reporting period in the ZEST, noninjection-site zosteriform rashes 
were reported by 34 subjects (19 for ZOSTAVAX and 15 for placebo). Of 24 specimens that were 
adequate for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, wild-type VZV was detected in 10 (3 for 
ZOSTAVAX, 7 for placebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from 
any of these specimens.  
Within the same 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the ZEST, varicella-like rashes were reported 
by 124 subjects (69 for ZOSTAVAX and 55 for placebo). Of 23 specimens that were available and 
adequate for PCR testing, VZV was detected in one of these specimens from the group of subjects who 
received ZOSTAVAX; however, the virus strain (wild type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be determined. 
Other Studies  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In other clinical trials in support of the initial licensure of the frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX, the 
reported rates of noninjection-site zosteriform and varicella-like rashes within 42 days postvaccination 
were also low in both zoster vaccine recipients and placebo recipients. Of the 17 reported noninjection-site 
zosteriform and varicella-like rashes, 10 specimens were available and adequate for PCR testing. The 
Oka/Merck strain was identified by PCR analysis from the lesion specimens of only two subjects who 
reported varicella-like rashes (onset on Day 8 and 17). 
In other clinical trials evaluating ZOSTAVAX in subjects 50 years of age or older, including a study of 
concomitantly administered inactivated influenza vaccine, the safety profile was generally similar to that 
seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. However, in these trials, a higher rate of 
injection-site adverse experiences of mild-to-moderate intensity was reported among subjects 50-59 years 
of age compared with subjects ≥60 years of age (see section 5.1). 
Data from a clinical trial (n=368) demonstrated that the current refrigerated formulation is generally well 
tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of the frozen formulation. 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, in which ZOSTAVAX was administered 
to 100 subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination, the safety 
profile was generally similar to that seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS.  
Based on limited data from 2 clinical trials that enrolled VZV-seronegative or low seropositive subjects 
(27 subjects 30 years of age or older received live attenuated zoster vaccine), injection site and systemic 
adverse experiences were generally similar to those reported by other subjects who received ZOSTAVAX 
in clinical trials, with 2 of the 27 subjects reporting fever. No subjects reported varicella-like or herpes 
zoster-like rashes.  No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported. 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 206 
subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy 
at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, and 6 weeks 
or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ZOSTAVAX.  In this 
clinical trial, the safety profile was generally comparable to that seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring 
Substudy of the SPS (see section 4.3 Contraindications regarding corticosteroids). 
b. Tabulated summary of adverse events 
Table 1 presents vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly 
greater incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group in the Adverse Event Monitoring 
Substudy. 
They are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: 
[Very Common (≥1/10);  
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10);  
Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);  
Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000);  
Very rare (<1/10,000)] 
Table 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been reported spontaneously through post-
marketing surveillance. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, 
it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine 
exposure. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is qualified as "not known".

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BK02 
Mechanism of action 
Anyone who has been infected with VZV, including those without a clinical history of varicella, is at risk 
for developing zoster. This risk appears to be causally related to a decline in VZV-specific immunity. 
ZOSTAVAX was shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the mechanism by 
which it protects against zoster and its complications (See Immunogenicity). 
Evaluation of Clinical Efficacy Afforded by ZOSTAVAX 
Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older: 
ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster and PHN compared with placebo. In 
addition, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced zoster-associated pain as measured by the HZ pain Burden of 
Illness (BOI) score (see results and definition in Table 2).

***The HZ pain BOI score is a composite score that incorporates the incidence, severity, and duration of 
acute and chronic zoster-associated pain over a 6-month follow-up period. 
In the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of ZOSTAVAX, 
38546 subjects 60 years of age or older were randomized to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX 
(n=19270) or placebo (n=19276). 
ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (315 [5.4/1000 
person-years] vs. 642 cases [11.1/1000 person-years], respectively; p<0.001). The protective efficacy of 
ZOSTAVAX against zoster was 51% (95% CI: [44 to 58%]). ZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of 
zoster by 64% (95% CI: [56 to 71%]) in individuals 60-69 years of age and by 38% (95% CI: [25 to 48%]) 
in individuals ≥70 years of age. 
In the SPS, the reduction in zoster was seen in almost all dermatomes. Ophthalmic zoster occurred in 35 
subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 69 subjects who received placebo. Impaired vision occurred in 
2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 9 who received placebo. 
ZOSTAVAX decreased the incidence of PHN compared with placebo [(27 cases [0.5/1000 person-years] 
vs. 80 cases [1.4/1000 person-years], respectively; p<0.001). In this trial, the definition of PHN was 
clinically significant zoster-associated pain persisting or appearing at least 90 days after the onset of rash. 
The protective efficacy of ZOSTAVAX against PHN was 67% (95% CI: [48 to 79%]). Referring only to 
subjects who developed zoster, there was a decrease in the risk of subsequently developing PHN. In the 
vaccine group, the risk of developing PHN after zoster was 9 % (27/315), while in the placebo group it 
was 13 % (80/642). This effect was more prominent in the group of older subjects (≥70 years of age), 
where the risk of developing PHN after zoster was reduced to 10% in the vaccine group vs. 19% for the 
placebo group. 
ZOSTAVAX reduced the HZ pain BOI score by approximately 61% (95% CI: [51 to 69%]), compared 
with placebo. The effect was more pronounced in the younger age group (60 to 69 years) where the 
efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on HZ pain BOI was 66% compared to 55% in patients ≥70 years of age; 
however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.266). 
Prevention of HZ cases with severe pain in the entire study population 
ZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of zoster with severe and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration score 
>600) by 73% (95% CI: [46 to 87%]) compared with placebo (11 vs. 40 cases, respectively).  
Reduction of zoster pain severity-by-duration in vaccinated individuals who developed zoster 
With regard to the acute pain (pain between 0-30 days) there was no statistically significant difference 
between the vaccine group and the placebo group. The HZ pain severity-by-duration score was 89 
(95%CI: [82 to 97%]) for the vaccine group vs. 92 (95% CI: [87 to 97%]) for the placebo group. The 
overall use of analgesic medication was similar in both study groups. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among vaccinated individuals who developed PHN, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced PHN-associated 
(chronic) pain compared with placebo. In the period from 90 days after rash onset to the end of follow-up, 
there was a 57% reduction in the severity-by-duration score (average scores of 347 for ZOSTAVAX and 
805 for placebo; p=0.016). 
Among vaccinated individuals who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced overall acute 
and chronic zoster-associated pain compared with placebo. Over the 6-month (acute and chronic) follow-
up period, there was a 22% reduction (p =0.008) in the severity-by-duration score and a 52% (95% CI: [7 
to 74%]) reduction (from 6.2% to 3.5%) in the risk of having HZ with severe and long-lasting pain 
(severity-by-duration score of >600). 
The Short-term Persistence Substudy (STPS): 
The STPS was initiated to accrue additional information on the persistence of vaccine efficacy and to 
preserve a subset of subjects from the SPS for the long-term persistence substudy (LTPS). The STPS 
included 7,320 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and 6,950 subjects previously vaccinated 
with placebo in the SPS. The mean age at enrollment in the STPS was 73.3 years. During the course of the 
STPS, placebo recipients were offered ZOSTAVAX, at which time they were considered to have 
completed the STPS. 
The STPS analyses for vaccine efficacy are based on data collected primarily 4 to 7 years postvaccination 
in the SPS. The median follow-up in the STPS was ~1.2 years (range is one day to 2.2 years). In the 
STPS, there were 84 evaluable HZ cases [8.4/1000 person-years] in the ZOSTAVAX group and 95 
evaluable cases [14.0/1000 person-years] in the placebo group. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the 
STPS follow-up period was 40% (95% CI: [18 to 56%]) for HZ incidence, 60% (95% CI: [-10 to 87%]) 
for PHN incidence and 50% (95% CI: [14 to 71%]) for HZ BOI. 
The Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS): 
Following completion of the STPS, the LTPS evaluated the duration of protection against HZ, PHN and 
HZ BOI in a total of 6,867 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX in the SPS. The mean age at 
enrollment into the LTPS was 74.5 years. A concurrent placebo control was not available in the LTPS; 
data from prior placebo recipients were used to estimate vaccine efficacy. 
The LTPS analyses for vaccine efficacy are based on data collected primarily from Year 7 through Year 
10 following vaccination in the SPS. The median follow-up during the LTPS was ~3.9 years (range is one 
week to 4.75 years). There were 263 evaluable HZ cases reported among 261 patients [10.3/1000 person-
years] during the LTPS. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the LTPS follow-up period was 21% (95% 
CI: [11 to 30%]) for HZ incidence, 35% (95% CI: [9 to 56%]) for PHN incidence and 37% (95% CI: [27 
to 46%]) for HZ BOI.  
ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age: 
The ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial 
in which 22,439 subjects 50 to 59 years of age were randomized to receive a single dose of either 
ZOSTAVAX (n=11,211) or placebo (n=11,228) and were followed for the development of zoster for a 
median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). All suspected zoster cases were adjudicated by a clinical 
evaluation committee. Final determination of zoster cases was made by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
[86%], or in the absence of virus detection, as determined by a clinical evaluation committee [14%].   
ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (30 cases 
[2.0/1000 person-years] vs. 99 cases [6.6/1000 person-years], respectively; p<0.001). The protective 
efficacy of ZOSTAVAX against zoster was 70% (95% CI: [54 to 81%]). 
Immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), immune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a subset 
of the enrolled subjects (N=1395). ZOSTAVAX elicited higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 
weeks postvaccination compared with placebo. Increases in both VZV antibody level, measured by 
glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) (1.7-fold difference, geometric mean titer 
[GMT] of 479 vs. 288 gpELISA units/ml, p <0.001), and T-cell activity, measured by VZV interferon-
gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN- ELISPOT) assay (2.2-fold difference, geometric mean count 
[GMC] of 70 vs. 32 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [SFC/106 PBMCs], 
p<0.001) were demonstrated. When evaluated at 4 weeks postvaccination, the immunogenicity of the 
current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenicity of the earlier frozen 
formulation of ZOSTAVAX. 
Within the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST), immune responses to vaccination were 
evaluated in a random 10% subcohort (n=1,136 for ZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects 
enrolled in the ZEST. ZOSTAVAX elicited higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks 
postvaccination compared with placebo. Increases in VZV antibody level, measured by glycoprotein 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) were demonstrated (2.3-fold difference (95% CI [2.2, 
2.4]), geometric mean titer [GMT] of 664 vs. 288 gpELISA units/mL, p <0.001).  
Immunogenicity following concomitant administration 
In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 762 adults 50 years of age and older were randomized to 
receive a single dose of ZOSTAVAX administered either concomitantly (N=382) or nonconcomitantly 
(N=380) with inactivated split influenza vaccine. The antibody responses to both vaccines at 4 weeks 
postvaccination were similar, whether administered concomitantly or nonconcomitantly. 
In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomized to receive 
a single dose of ZOSTAVAX either concomitantly (N=237), or nonconcomitantly with 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (N=236). At four weeks postvaccination, the VZV antibody levels 
following concomitant use were not similar to the VZV antibody levels following nonconcomitant 
administration (GMTs of 338 vs. 484 gpELISA units/mL, respectively; GMT ratio = 0.70 (95% CI: [0.61, 
0.80])). VZV antibody levels 4 weeks postvaccination were increased 1.9-fold (95% CI: [1.7, 2.1]; 
meeting the pre-specified acceptance criterion) in the concomitant group vs. 3.1-fold (95% CI: [2.8, 3.5]) 
in the nonconcomitant group. The GMTs for 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine antigens 
were similar between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the safety profile between 
concomitant and nonconcomitant administration of ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine, except for headache and pneumococcal vaccine injection site erythema and 
swelling, which were more common in the concomitant group. 
Immunogenicity in subjects with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 100 
subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination to assess 
immunogenicity and safety (see section 4.8) of ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX induced a significantly higher 
VZV-specific immune response measured by gpELISA at 4 weeks postvaccination, compared with 
placebo (2.1-fold difference (95% CI: [1.5 to 2.9]), p<0.001, GMT of 812 vs. 393 gpELISA units/ml). 
VZV antibody responses were generally similar in subjects 50 to 59 compared to subjects ≥60 years of 
age. 
Immunogenicity in subjects on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids  
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 206 
subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy 
at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, and 6 weeks 
or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ZOSTAVAX. 
Compared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX induced a higher VZV-specific gpELISA antibody GMT at 6 
weeks postvaccination (GMT of 531.1 vs. 224.3 gpELISA units/ml, respectively). The Geometric mean 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fold-rise of immune response following vaccination as measured by gpELISA was 2.3-fold (95% CI: [2.0 
to 2.7]) compared to 1.1-fold (95% CI: [1.0 to 1.2]) in the placebo group.  
Revaccination 
The need for, or timing of, revaccination with ZOSTAVAX has not yet been determined.  
In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, study, 98 adults 60 years of age or older received a second dose of 
ZOSTAVAX 42 days following the initial dose; the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The frequency 
of vaccine-related adverse experiences after the second dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that 
seen with the first dose. 
Immunocompromised subjects 
The vaccine has not been studied in subjects with impaired immunity. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Traditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered 
relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the SPC.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
ZOSTAVAX is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (“zoster” or shingles) and herpes zoster-related 
post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). 
ZOSTAVAX is indicated for immunization of individuals 50 years of age or older. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration

Zostavax is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox) and should not be 
used in children and adolescents. 
Method of administration 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The vaccine is to be injected SUBCUTANEOUSLY, preferably in the deltoid region. 
Do not inject intravascularly. 
For precautions before handling or administering the medicinal product see section 6.6. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
 
 
 
 
 
History of hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients or trace residuals (e.g., 
neomycin) (see sections 4.4 and 6.1). 
Primary and acquired immunodeficiency states due to conditions such as: acute and chronic 
leukaemias; lymphoma; other conditions affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system; 
immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS; cellular immune deficiencies. 
Immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose corticosteroids); however, ZOSTAVAX is not 
contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low-dose 
systemic corticosteroids or in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, 
e.g., for adrenal insufficiency (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Active untreated tuberculosis. 
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see 
section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction following the administration of the vaccine, as there is a possibility of 
hypersensitivity reactions, not only to the active substances, but also to the excipients and trace residuals 
(e.g. neomycin) present in the vaccine (see sections 4.3, 4.8 and 6.1). 
Neomycin allergy generally manifests as a contact dermatitis. However, a history of contact dermatitis due 
to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving live virus vaccines. 
ZOSTAVAX is not indicated for treatment of zoster or PHN. 
Deferral of vaccination should be considered in the presence of fever. 
As for any vaccine, vaccination with ZOSTAVAX may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients. 
See section 5.1. 
The safety and efficacy of ZOSTAVAX have not been established in adults who are known to be infected 
with HIV with or without evidence of immunosuppression (see section 4.3). 
Transmission  
In clinical trials with ZOSTAVAX, transmission of the vaccine virus has not been reported. However, 
post-marketing experience with varicella vaccines suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur 
rarely between vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and susceptible contacts (for example, VZV-
susceptible infant grandchildren). Transmission of vaccine virus from varicella vaccine recipients who do 
not develop a varicella-like rash has also been reported. This is a theoretical risk for vaccination with 
ZOSTAVAX. The risk of transmitting the attenuated vaccine virus from a vaccinee to a susceptible 
contact should be weighed against the risk of developing natural zoster and potentially transmitting wild-
type VZV to a susceptible contact.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
ZOSTAVAX can be administered concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine as separate injections 
and at different body sites (see section 5.1). 
ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should not be given concomitantly 
because concomitant use in a clinical trial resulted in reduced immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX (see 
section 5.1). 
No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines. 
Concurrent administration of ZOSTAVAX and anti-viral medications known to be effective against VZV 
has not been evaluated. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies in pregnant women. It is also not known whether ZOSTAVAX can cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. However naturally-occurring 
varicella-zoster virus infection is known to sometimes cause foetal harm. As ZOSTAVAX is not indicated 
in individuals less than 50 years of age, ZOSTAVAX is not intended to be administered to pregnant 
women. In any case, pregnancy should be avoided for one month following vaccination (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether VZV is secreted in human milk. Therefore, because some viruses are secreted in 
human milk, caution should be exercised if ZOSTAVAX is administered to a breast-feeding woman. 
Fertility 
ZOSTAVAX has not been evaluated in fertility studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. However, 
ZOSTAVAX is expected to have no or negligible influence on ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical trials, ZOSTAVAX has been evaluated for general safety in more than 32000 adults. 
Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older 
In the largest of these trials, the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), 38546 subjects received a single dose of 
either the frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX (n=19270) or placebo (n=19276) and were monitored for 
safety throughout the study. During the study, vaccine-related serious adverse reactions were reported for 
2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (asthma exacerbation and polymyalgia rheumatica) and 3 
subjects who received placebo (Goodpasture’s syndrome, anaphylactic reaction, and polymyalgia 
rheumatica). 
In the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy, a subgroup of individuals from the SPS (n=3345 received 
ZOSTAVAX and n=3271 received placebo) were provided vaccination report cards to record adverse 
events occurring from Days 0 to 42 postvaccination in addition to undergoing routine safety monitoring 
throughout the study. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater 
incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy are 
listed in Table 1. Most of these adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. Table 1 also includes 
additional adverse events which have been reported spontaneously through post-marketing surveillance. 
The overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse reactions was significantly greater for 
subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo (48% for ZOSTAVAX and 
17% for placebo). 
The remainder of subjects in the SPS received routine safety monitoring, but were not provided report 
cards. The types of events reported in these patients were generally similar to the subgroup of patients in 
the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy. 
Within the 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the SPS, the number of reported zosteriform rashes 
among all subjects was small (17 for ZOSTAVAX, 36 for placebo; p=0.009). Of these 53 zosteriform 
rashes, 41 had specimens that were available and adequate for PCR testing. Wild-type VZV was detected 
in 25 (5 for ZOSTAVAX, 20 for placebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not 
detected from any of these specimens. 
Within the same 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the SPS, the number (n=59) of reported 
varicella-like rashes was also small. Of these varicella-like rashes, 10 had specimens that were available 
and adequate for PCR testing. VZV was not detected in any of these specimens. 
ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age 
In the ZEST study, subjects received a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX (n=11,184) or placebo 
(n=11,212) and were monitored for safety throughout the study. During the study, a vaccine-related 
serious adverse experience was reported for 1 subject vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX (anaphylactic 
reaction). 
All subjects received a vaccination report card (VRC) to record adverse events occurring from Days 1 to 
42 postvaccination in addition to undergoing routine safety monitoring throughout the study. 
The vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse experiences reported in the ZEST study are 
presented in Table 1. Table 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been reported 
spontaneously through post-marketing surveillance. 
The overall incidence of vaccine-related injection-site adverse experiences was significantly greater for 
subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX versus subjects who received placebo (63.9% for ZOSTAVAX and 
14.4% for placebo). Most of these adverse reactions were reported as mild in intensity. 
Within the 42-day post vaccination reporting period in the ZEST, noninjection-site zosteriform rashes 
were reported by 34 subjects (19 for ZOSTAVAX and 15 for placebo). Of 24 specimens that were 
adequate for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, wild-type VZV was detected in 10 (3 for 
ZOSTAVAX, 7 for placebo) of these specimens. The Oka/Merck strain of VZV was not detected from 
any of these specimens.  
Within the same 42-day postvaccination reporting period in the ZEST, varicella-like rashes were reported 
by 124 subjects (69 for ZOSTAVAX and 55 for placebo). Of 23 specimens that were available and 
adequate for PCR testing, VZV was detected in one of these specimens from the group of subjects who 
received ZOSTAVAX; however, the virus strain (wild type or Oka/Merck strain) could not be determined. 
Other Studies 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In other clinical trials in support of the initial licensure of the frozen formulation of ZOSTAVAX, the 
reported rates of noninjection-site zosteriform and varicella-like rashes within 42 days postvaccination 
were also low in both zoster vaccine recipients and placebo recipients. Of the 17 reported noninjection-site 
zosteriform and varicella-like rashes, 10 specimens were available and adequate for PCR testing. The 
Oka/Merck strain was identified by PCR analysis from the lesion specimens of only two subjects who 
reported varicella-like rashes (onset on Day 8 and 17). 
In other clinical trials evaluating ZOSTAVAX in subjects 50 years of age or older, including a study of 
concomitantly administered inactivated influenza vaccine, the safety profile was generally similar to that 
seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS. However, in these trials, a higher rate of 
injection-site adverse experiences of mild-to-moderate intensity was reported among subjects 50-59 years 
of age compared with subjects ≥60 years of age (see section 5.1). 
Data from a clinical trial (n=368) demonstrated that the current refrigerated formulation is generally well 
tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of the frozen formulation. 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, in which ZOSTAVAX was administered 
to 100 subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination, the safety 
profile was generally similar to that seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring Substudy of the SPS.  
Based on limited data from 2 clinical trials that enrolled VZV-seronegative or low seropositive subjects 
(27 subjects 30 years of age or older received live attenuated zoster vaccine), injection site and systemic 
adverse experiences were generally similar to those reported by other subjects who received ZOSTAVAX 
in clinical trials, with 2 of the 27 subjects reporting fever. No subjects reported varicella-like or herpes 
zoster-like rashes.  No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported. 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 206 
subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy 
at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, and 6 weeks 
or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ZOSTAVAX.  In this 
clinical trial, the safety profile was generally comparable to that seen in the Adverse Event Monitoring 
Substudy of the SPS (see section 4.3 Contraindications regarding corticosteroids). 
b. Tabulated summary of adverse events 
Table 1 presents vaccine-related injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly 
greater incidence in the vaccine group versus the placebo group in the Adverse Event Monitoring 
Substudy. 
They are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: 
[Very Common (≥1/10);  
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10);  
Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);  
Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000);  
Very rare (<1/10,000)] 
Table 1 also includes additional adverse events which have been reported spontaneously through post-
marketing surveillance. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, 
it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine 
exposure. Consequently, the frequency of these adverse events is qualified as "not known".

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BK02  
Mechanism of action 
Anyone who has been infected with VZV, including those without a clinical history of varicella, is at risk 
for developing zoster. This risk appears to be causally related to a decline in VZV-specific immunity. 
ZOSTAVAX was shown to boost VZV-specific immunity, which is thought to be the mechanism by 
which it protects against zoster and its complications (See Immunogenicity). 
Evaluation of Clinical Efficacy Afforded by ZOSTAVAX 
Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) in Subjects 60 Years of Age and Older: 
ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced the risk of developing zoster and PHN compared with placebo. In 
addition, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced zoster-associated pain as measured by the HZ pain Burden of 
Illness (BOI) score (see results and definition in Table 2).

In the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of ZOSTAVAX, 
38546 subjects 60 years of age or older were randomized to receive a single dose of either ZOSTAVAX 
(n=19270) or placebo (n=19276). 
ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (315 [5.4/1000 
person-years] vs. 642 cases [11.1/1000 person-years], respectively; p<0.001). The protective efficacy of 
ZOSTAVAX against zoster was 51% (95% CI: [44 to 58%]). ZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of 
zoster by 64% (95% CI: [56 to 71%]) in individuals 60-69 years of age and by 38% (95% CI: [25 to 48%]) 
in individuals ≥70 years of age. 
In the SPS, the reduction in zoster was seen in almost all dermatomes. Ophthalmic zoster occurred in 35 
subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 69 subjects who received placebo. Impaired vision occurred in 
2 subjects vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX vs. 9 who received placebo. 
ZOSTAVAX decreased the incidence of PHN compared with placebo [(27 cases [0.5/1000 person-years] 
vs. 80 cases [1.4/1000 person-years], respectively; p<0.001). In this trial, the definition of PHN was 
clinically significant zoster-associated pain persisting or appearing at least 90 days after the onset of rash. 
The protective efficacy of ZOSTAVAX against PHN was 67% (95% CI: [48 to 79%]). Referring only to 
subjects who developed zoster, there was a decrease in the risk of subsequently developing PHN. In the 
vaccine group, the risk of developing PHN after zoster was 9 % (27/315), while in the placebo group it 
was 13 % (80/642). This effect was more prominent in the group of older subjects (≥70 years of age), 
where the risk of developing PHN after zoster was reduced to 10% in the vaccine group vs. 19% for the 
placebo group. 
ZOSTAVAX reduced the HZ pain BOI score by approximately 61% (95% CI: [51 to 69%]), compared 
with placebo. The effect was more pronounced in the younger age group (60 to 69 years) where the 
efficacy of ZOSTAVAX on HZ pain BOI was 66% compared to 55% in patients ≥70 years of age; 
however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.266). 
Prevention of HZ cases with severe pain in the entire study population 
ZOSTAVAX reduced the incidence of zoster with severe and long-lasting pain (severity-by-duration score 
>600) by 73% (95% CI: [46 to 87%]) compared with placebo (11 vs. 40 cases, respectively).  
Reduction of zoster pain severity-by-duration in vaccinated individuals who developed zoster 
With regard to the acute pain (pain between 0-30 days) there was no statistically significant difference 
between the vaccine group and the placebo group. The HZ pain severity-by-duration score was 89 
(95%CI: [82 to 97%]) for the vaccine group vs. 92 (95% CI: [87 to 97%]) for the placebo group. The 
overall use of analgesic medication was similar in both study groups. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Among vaccinated individuals who developed PHN, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced PHN-associated 
(chronic) pain compared with placebo. In the period from 90 days after rash onset to the end of follow-up, 
there was a 57% reduction in the severity-by-duration score (average scores of 347 for ZOSTAVAX and 
805 for placebo; p=0.016). 
Among vaccinated individuals who developed zoster, ZOSTAVAX significantly reduced overall acute 
and chronic zoster-associated pain compared with placebo. Over the 6-month (acute and chronic) follow-
up period, there was a 22% reduction (p =0.008) in the severity-by-duration score and a 52% (95% CI: [7 
to 74%]) reduction (from 6.2% to 3.5%) in the risk of having HZ with severe and long-lasting pain 
(severity-by-duration score of >600). 
The Short-term Persistence Substudy (STPS): 
The STPS was initiated to accrue additional information on the persistence of vaccine efficacy and to 
preserve a subset of subjects from the SPS for the long-term persistence substudy (LTPS). The STPS 
included 7,320 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX and 6,950 subjects previously vaccinated 
with placebo in the SPS. The mean age at enrollment in the STPS was 73.3 years. During the course of the 
STPS, placebo recipients were offered ZOSTAVAX, at which time they were considered to have 
completed the STPS. 
The STPS analyses for vaccine efficacy are based on data collected primarily 4 to 7 years postvaccination 
in the SPS. The median follow-up in the STPS was ~1.2 years (range is one day to 2.2 years). In the 
STPS, there were 84 evaluable HZ cases [8.4/1000 person-years] in the ZOSTAVAX group and 95 
evaluable cases [14.0/1000 person-years] in the placebo group. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the 
STPS follow-up period was 40% (95% CI: [18 to 56%]) for HZ incidence, 60% (95% CI: [-10 to 87%]) 
for PHN incidence and 50% (95% CI: [14 to 71%]) for HZ BOI. 
The Long-term Persistence Substudy (LTPS): 
Following completion of the STPS, the LTPS evaluated the duration of protection against HZ, PHN and 
HZ BOI in a total of 6,867 subjects previously vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX in the SPS. The mean age at 
enrollment into the LTPS was 74.5 years. A concurrent placebo control was not available in the LTPS; 
data from prior placebo recipients were used to estimate vaccine efficacy. 
The LTPS analyses for vaccine efficacy are based on data collected primarily from Year 7 through Year 
10 following vaccination in the SPS. The median follow-up during the LTPS was ~3.9 years (range is one 
week to 4.75 years). There were 263 evaluable HZ cases reported among 261 patients [10.3/1000 person-
years] during the LTPS. The estimated vaccine efficacy during the LTPS follow-up period was 21% (95% 
CI: [11 to 30%]) for HZ incidence, 35% (95% CI: [9 to 56%]) for PHN incidence and 37% (95% CI: [27 
to 46%]) for HZ BOI.  
ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) in Subjects 50 to 59 Years of Age: 
The ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST) was a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial 
in which 22,439 subjects 50 to 59 years of age were randomized to receive a single dose of either 
ZOSTAVAX (n=11,211) or placebo (n=11,228) and were followed for the development of zoster for a 
median of 1.3 years (range 0 to 2 years). All suspected zoster cases were adjudicated by a clinical 
evaluation committee. Final determination of zoster cases was made by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
[86%], or in the absence of virus detection, as determined by a clinical evaluation committee [14%]. 
ZOSTAVAX significantly decreased the incidence of zoster compared with placebo (30 cases 
[2.0/1000 person-years] vs. 99 cases [6.6/1000 person-years], respectively; p<0.001). The protective 
efficacy of ZOSTAVAX against zoster was 70% (95% CI: [54 to 81%]). 
Immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Within the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), immune responses to vaccination were evaluated in a subset 
of the enrolled subjects (N=1395). ZOSTAVAX elicited higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 
weeks postvaccination compared with placebo. Increases in both VZV antibody level, measured by 
glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) (1.7-fold difference, geometric mean titer 
[GMT] of 479 vs. 288 gpELISA units/ml, p <0.001), and T-cell activity, measured by VZV interferon-
gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN- ELISPOT) assay (2.2-fold difference, geometric mean count 
[GMC] of 70 vs. 32 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [SFC/106 PBMCs], 
p<0.001) were demonstrated. When evaluated at 4 weeks postvaccination, the immunogenicity of the 
current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the immunogenicity of the earlier frozen 
formulation of ZOSTAVAX. 
Within the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST), immune responses to vaccination were 
evaluated in a random 10% subcohort (n=1,136 for ZOSTAVAX and n=1,133 for placebo) of the subjects 
enrolled in the ZEST. ZOSTAVAX elicited higher VZV-specific immune responses at 6 weeks 
postvaccination compared with placebo. Increases in VZV antibody level, measured by glycoprotein 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) were demonstrated (2.3-fold difference (95% CI [2.2, 
2.4]), geometric mean titer [GMT] of 664 vs. 288 gpELISA units/mL, p <0.001).  
Immunogenicity following concomitant administration 
In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 762 adults 50 years of age and older were randomized to 
receive a single dose of ZOSTAVAX administered either concomitantly (N=382) or nonconcomitantly 
(N=380) with inactivated split influenza vaccine. The antibody responses to both vaccines at 4 weeks 
postvaccination were similar, whether administered concomitantly or nonconcomitantly. 
In a double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 473 adults, 60 years of age or older, were randomized to receive 
a single dose of ZOSTAVAX either concomitantly (N=237), or nonconcomitantly with 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (N=236). At four weeks postvaccination, the VZV antibody levels 
following concomitant use were not similar to the VZV antibody levels following nonconcomitant 
administration (GMTs of 338 vs. 484 gpELISA units/mL, respectively; GMT ratio = 0.70 (95% CI: [0.61, 
0.80])). VZV antibody levels 4 weeks postvaccination were increased 1.9-fold (95% CI: [1.7, 2.1]; 
meeting the pre-specified acceptance criterion) in the concomitant group vs. 3.1-fold (95% CI: [2.8, 3.5]) 
in the nonconcomitant group. The GMTs for 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine antigens 
were similar between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the safety profile between 
concomitant and nonconcomitant administration of ZOSTAVAX and 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine, except for headache and pneumococcal vaccine injection site erythema and 
swelling, which were more common in the concomitant group. 
Immunogenicity in subjects with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination 
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 100 
subjects 50 years of age or older with a history of herpes zoster (HZ) prior to vaccination to assess 
immunogenicity and safety (see section 4.8) of ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX induced a significantly higher 
VZV-specific immune response measured by gpELISA at 4 weeks postvaccination, compared with 
placebo (2.1-fold difference (95% CI: [1.5 to 2.9]), p<0.001), GMT of 812 vs. 393 gpELISA units/ml. 
VZV antibody responses were generally similar in subjects 50 to 59 compared to subjects ≥60 years of 
age. 
Immunogenicity in subjects on chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroids  
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, ZOSTAVAX was administered to 206 
subjects 60 years of age or older who were receiving chronic/maintenance systemic corticosteroid therapy 
at a daily dose equivalent of 5 to 20 mg of prednisone for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment, and 6 weeks 
or more following vaccination to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ZOSTAVAX. 
Compared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX induced a higher VZV-specific gpELISA antibody GMT at 6 
weeks postvaccination (GMT of 531.1 vs. 224.3 gpELISA units/ml, respectively). The Geometric mean 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fold-rise of immune response following vaccination as measured by gpELISA was 2.3-fold (95% CI: [2.0 
to 2.7]) compared to 1.1-fold (95% CI: [1.0 to 1.2]) in the placebo group.  
Revaccination 
The need for, or timing of, revaccination with ZOSTAVAX has not yet been determined.  
In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, study, 98 adults 60 years of age or older received a second dose of 
ZOSTAVAX 42 days following the initial dose; the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The frequency 
of vaccine-related adverse experiences after the second dose of ZOSTAVAX was generally similar to that 
seen with the first dose. 
Immunocompromised subjects 
The vaccine has not been studied in subjects with impaired immunity. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Avoid contact with disinfectants. 
To reconstitute the vaccine, use the solvent provided. When reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi-hazy to 
translucent, off-white to pale yellow liquid. 
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each patient to prevent transmission of 
infectious agents from one individual to another. 
Reconstitution instructions 
If two needles are provided, separate needles should be used for the reconstitution and administration of 
the vaccine. 
To reconstitute the vaccine, inject all the solvent in the pre-filled syringe into the vial of lyophilized 
vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly.  
Withdraw the entire contents into a syringe for injection.  
One or 2 separate needles may be available in the secondary packaging of the presentation containing the 
pre-filled syringe without the attached needle.  
The needle should be pushed into the extremity of the syringe and rotated a quarter of a turn (90) to 
secure the connection. 
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution, to minimize 
loss of potency. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 30 minutes. 
Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if you notice any particulate matter or if the appearance of the solvent 
or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What ZOSTAVAX is and what it is used for 
ZOSTAVAX is a vaccine used to prevent shingles (zoster) and zoster-related post-herpetic neuralgia 
(PHN), the long-lasting nerve pain that follows shingles. 
ZOSTAVAX is used to vaccinate individuals 50 years of age or older. 
ZOSTAVAX cannot be used to treat existing shingles or the pain associated with existing shingles. 
Disease information on shingles: 
What is shingles? 
Shingles is a painful, blistering rash. It usually occurs in one part of the body and can last for several 
weeks. It may lead to severe and long-lasting pain and scarring. Less commonly, bacterial skin infections, 
weakness, muscle paralysis, loss of hearing or vision can occur. Shingles is caused by the same virus that 
causes chickenpox. After you have had chickenpox, the virus that caused it stays in your body in nerve 
cells. Sometimes, after many years, the virus becomes active again and causes shingles.  
What is PHN?  
After the shingles blisters heal, pain can last for months or years and may be severe. This long-lasting 
nerve pain is called post-herpetic neuralgia or PHN.  
2.  What you need to know before you receive ZOSTAVAX

Reconstitution instructions 
The solvent is a clear and colourless liquid. Before mixing with the solvent, the powder is a white to off-
white compact crystalline plug. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a semi-hazy to translucent, 
off-white to pale yellow liquid.  
Withdraw the entire volume of solvent into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe into the vial 
containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely. Withdraw the entire content of the 
reconstituted vaccine vial into a syringe for injection. 
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to minimize loss of 
potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes. 
Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if you notice any particulate matter or if the appearance of the solvent 
or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Reconstitution instructions 
The solvent is a clear and colourless liquid. Before mixing with the solvent, the powder is a white to off-
white compact crystalline plug. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a semi-hazy to translucent, 
off-white to pale yellow liquid.  
Inject the entire content of the pre-filled syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to 
dissolve completely. Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine vial into a syringe for 
injection. One or 2 separate needles may be available in the secondary packaging of the presentation 
containing the pre-filled syringe without the attached needle. The needle should be pushed into the 
extremity of the syringe and rotated a quarter of a turn (90) to secure the connection. 
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to minimize loss of 
potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes. 
Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if you notice any particulate matter or if the appearance of the solvent 
or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

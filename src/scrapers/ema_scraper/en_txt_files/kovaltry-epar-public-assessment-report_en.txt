2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Haemophilia A is a lifelong X-linked disorder, affecting almost exclusively males; about 1 in 5000 live 
male births and approximately 400,000 patients worldwide- while females being carriers of the gene 
mutation. It is caused by an absence or low levels of the coagulation protein FVIII. There are currently 
approximately 30,000 patients in the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
10,000.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 6/72 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemophilia A is usually diagnosed by measuring FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C) level in the plasma of 
a patient. There is a direct correlation between FVIII activity levels and clinical manifestations. 
Haemophilia A can result in spontaneous and life-threatening bleeding events or excessive bleeding in 
response to trauma. Bleeds occur in muscle, organs, soft tissue and most frequently in joints, which 
leads to joint damage and severe disability, with major effects on the physical, psychosocial, quality of 
life (QoL), and financial conditions of the haemophilia patients and their families.  
Standard treatment for these patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of 
clotting factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of 
comprehensive haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction 
of home treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled 
patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life.  
Kovaltry contains the rFVIII protein (code name: BAY 81-8973) octocog alfa, essentially identical to 
the currently marketed product Kogenate FS/KOGENATE Bayer, herein referred to as Kogenate FS; the 
rFVIII protein concentration and the composition of the excipients are the same as Kogenate FS.  
Compared to Kogenate FS, BAY 81-8973 is produced with a new FVIII expressing cell bank, which 
includes the gene for human heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) that improves FVIII productivity, and 
other improvements in the production processes. In addition, all animal- and human-derived additives 
have been eliminated from the cell culture and purification processes and a virus filtration step has 
been introduced for improved non-enveloped viral clearance robustness BAY 81-8973 is supplied 
lyophilized in sterile glass vials and is reconstituted with sterile water for injection. It will be available 
in five vial sizes (250 International Units [IU], 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU). 
Kovaltry is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). Kovaltry can be used for all age groups.  
Posology for On Demand Treatment is proposed as follows: 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International 
Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of 
normal activity. 
The required dose is determined using the following formulae: Required units = body weight (kg) x 
desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed recovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be targeted to the 
clinical effectiveness required in the individual case. In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, 
the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in % of normal) in the corresponding 
period. The following table can be used to guide dosing during bleeding episodes and in surgery:

Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing 
occurs, then continue with therapy 
for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% to 60% (IU/dL). 
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses for 
adolescents (≥ 12 years age) and adult patients are 20 to 40 IU of Kovaltry per kg body weight two to 
three times per week. 
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be 
necessary. 
Previously untreated patients 
The safety and efficacy of Kovaltry in previously untreated patients have not yet been established. 
Limited data are available. 
Paediatric population 
A safety and efficacy study has been performed in children of 0-12 years (see section 5.1); limited 
data are available for children below 1 year. 
The recommended prophylaxis doses are 20-50 IU/kg twice weekly, three times weekly or every other 
day according to individual requirements. For paediatric patients above the age of 12, the dose 
recommendations are the same as for adults.  
The development of BAY 81-8973 is in agreement with the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP); PIP 
Decision number P/0107/2014/EMEA-001064-PIP01-10-M02.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Octocog alfa is a full-length recombinant human coagulation factor VIII (rFVIII) product. Other 
ingredients of the finished product are: sucrose, histidine, glycine sodium chloride, calcium chloride 
and polysorbate 80. The product is supplied lyophilized in sterile glass vials and is reconstituted with 
sterile water for injection (SWFI). The product will be available in five vial sizes (250 International 
Units [IU], 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU and 3000 IU per chromogenic substrate assay). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Octocog alfa is synthesized as a single chain 330-kD precursor with a domain structure of A1-A2-B-A3-
C1-C2 subunits. Proteolytic processing at the B-A3 (between Arg1648 and Glu1649) junction yields A1-
A2-B heavy chain and A3-C1-C2 light chains to form a large heterodimeric structure linked by a 
divalent cation bridge. Multiple N-linked and O-linked glycans are present on the structure, 
predominantly within the B-domain. 
The cell culture process was developed as a continuous perfusion process. The cell culture medium is 
free of human and animal derived raw materials.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing and testing sites of the active substance and the responsibilities of each site were 
listed in the dossier. Valid GMP certificates were presented for all sites. 
The description of the active substance manufacturing process is considered adequate. Main production 
steps include cell culture, purification, steps for virus inactivation and removal, concentration, 
formulation, filtration and filling. Process flow diagrams for the different steps of the manufacturing 
process were provided. The operational ranges have been defined in accordance with process 
development results. The batch size was defined. Process controls are appropriately listed. Certain 
analytical procedures, including the methods used for control of the absence of viral infection in the 
unprocessed harvest, have been acceptably submitted. 
Control of materials 
The establishment of the recombinant cell line has been described in sufficient detail.  The cell line 
expressing the active substance (clone R3/4-7) was derived by introducing the human Heat Shock 
Protein 70 (HSP 70) gene into cells. A two-tiered cell-banking system is used and documentation 
supports compliance with relevant guidelines (e.g. ICH Q5D).  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. No human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing 
process. The cell culture production medium is free of human and animal derived raw materials, but it 
contains Human recombinant insulin, which is specified to comply with Ph. Eur.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as powder and solvent for solution for injection. The powder is white to 
slightly yellow solid. The reconstituted product is a clear, colourless liquid. The finished product is 
supplied in single use glass vials containing 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 International Units (IU) 
human coagulation factor VIII. It is reconstituted with 2.5 mL Water for Injection (WFI) for 250 IU, 
500 IU and 1000 IU and with 5 mL WFI for 2000 IU and 3000 IU. 
The container closure configuration for the finished product is 10 mL colourless glass Type I siliconized 
vial with bromobutyl grey type I stopper for lyophilization.  
There are two packaging types for reconstitution using either an aluminium seal with a vial adapter or 
a reconstitution cap, and each packaging type connects to a WFI prefilled syringe.   
The pharmaceutical development (including the container closure system) has been sufficiently 
described. No changes were made to the finished product formulation in the course of development, 
clinical studies, and commercial conformance lots.  
Comprehensive characterization studies were carried out to further investigate the physicochemical 
and biological properties of active substance. All clinical and conformance finished product lots have 
comparable results to the product reference standard. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing and testing sites of the active substance and the responsibilities of each site were 
listed in the dossier. Valid GMP certificates were presented for all sites. 
The finished product manufacturing process including critical process parameters has been described 
and flow charts were submitted.  
The finished product manufacturing process involves thawing of the frozen active substance, dilution to 
appropriate target potency, sterile filtration, filling into vials, subsequent lyophilisation, unloading, and 
packaging. Critical process parameters and process performance attributes are defined. 
The manufacturing process has been validated and the in-process controls seem to be adequate. 
All conformance batches met the acceptance criteria for the critical quality attributes. 
The validation studies demonstrated that the critical process parameters are well controlled and that 
the finished product can be manufactured with sufficient  consistency and reproducibility . 
The primary packaging system for the powder has in general been acceptably described. The vials are 
sealed with an aluminium seal or alternatively with a reconstitution cap. The same vial (10 ml type I 
Ph. Eur. glass) and stopper (bromobutyl rubber Ph. Eur.) are used for the two alternative primary 
packaging systems. 
Product specification 
The specifications comply in general with the requirements in the Ph. Eur. monograph for Human 
coagulation factor VIII (rDNA).  
Specifications and acceptance criteria have been set in accordance with regulatory requirements and 
rely on suitable data as well as statistical analyses derived from an adequate array of batches.  
Overall, this set of release tests appeared sufficient to assure drug product quality and safety. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 11/72 
 
 
 
 
 
Analytical procedure descriptions have been provided and found adequate.  
The finished product potency assay has been adequately validated and appropriate reference standards 
have been used.  
Summary of the results from validation of the methods according to the ICH guidelines are provided. 
Also verifications of the suitability of the compendial methods used have been provided.  
Stability of the product 
The intended shelf-life for the finished product stored at 2-8°C and protected from light is 30 months. 
Within this period, the finished product may be stored for up to 12 months at a temperature up to 
25°C.  
All of the investigated batches followed a stability program based on ICH guidelines to support the 
shelf life assignment. The proposed storage conditions have been found acceptably justified and 
substantiated by data taking into account results under both real time and accelerated conditions. The 
claim of in use stability of reconstituted product for up to 3 hours and the statement that the product is 
sensitive to extreme light have been shown to be acceptable by data. Based on the available stability 
data, the shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
The active substance and finished product is manufactured using raw materials containing no 
ingredients of animal or human origin. However, materials of animal and human origin have been used 
at early stage of cell line development and during cell bank production. 
TSE safety 
Sufficient information has been provided to ensure safety with regards to TSE.  
Viral safety 
The active substance produced in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The protein is synthesized from the 
same rFVIII expression construct used for Bayer’s currently licensed rFVIII product, (KOGENATE 
Bayer, Helixate NEXGEN, Helixate-FS and Helixate N2V in various regions), in a host cell line derived 
from the cell bank. The production process for the active substance has been modified to remove HPPS 
and animal derived proteins from the upstream cell culture and downstream purification steps. 
Compliance with the Directive 2005/61/EC has been confirmed. 
The master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB) and the cells at the end of production (EOP) 
have been tested in compliance with current regulatory guidelines relevant to viral safety and cell 
substrate characterization. The information provided indicates that relevant tests have been performed 
in accordance with the guideline ICH Q5a.  
A summary of the different virus clearance studies performed has been provided as well as detailed 
reports from the individual studies.  
The studies have been performed in compliance with ICH Q5a and CPMP/BWP/268/95 and are in 
general deemed acceptable. The down scaling of the process steps has been acceptably justified and 
the viruses used in respective studies are deemed relevant for the use of BHK cell line considering that 
no materials of human and animal origin is used during the manufacturing process.

Pharmaceutical development, manufacture and control as well as container closure and stability have 
been sufficiently described and addressed. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.   
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends one further point for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Primary pharmacology studies compared BAY 81-8973 to Kogenate FS both in vitro and in 2 efficacy 
studies where the protection from bleeding and correlating pharmacokinetics (PK) was examined in 
hemophilia A mice. The safety pharmacology program comprised studies on cardiovascular function in 
anesthetized beagle dogs and on respiratory function in conscious unrestrained rats after single 
intravenous administration of BAY 81-8973.  
In male rats and rabbits PK evaluation of BAY 81-8973 was carried out through direct comparisons 
with Kogenate FS.  
The toxicological evaluation of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa comprises single-dose iv studies in rats and 
rabbits, 5-day repeat-dose iv studies (including toxicokinetic analysis) in rats and rabbits, an in vitro 
genotoxicity study, and an investigative antigenicity study in hemophilia A mice. Local tolerability was 
assessed as part of the single and repeat dose toxicity studies.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
 Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies compared BAY 81-8973 to Kogenate FS both in vitro and in vivo in 
hemophilia A mice. In vivo studies were conducted by mimicking the effectiveness of the test article on 
treating bleeds “on-demand”, or by treating the animals prophylactically (24 hours prior to injury).  
In vitro characterization 
Activity and potency of each lot of BAY 81-8973 were determined by the chromogenic assay according 
to European Pharmacopoeia. Additionally, each lot of BAY 81-8973 was also tested using the one-stage 
clotting assay (aPTT assay) (in vitro data are presented as part of the CMC section Module 2.3 and has 
not been included in the nonclinical assessment). 
In vivo characterization 
Two in vivo studies on BAY 81-8973 using a hemophilia A mouse (tail clip) model have been submitted 
(Table 3). In the first study the efficacy of an earlier developmental lot of BAY 81-8973 was compared 
to Kogenate FS, and in the second study PD relationships of a good manufacturing practice (GMP) 
clinical lot of BAY 81-8973 was compared to that of Kogenate FS. BAY 81-8973 and rFVIII-FS provided 
equivalent efficacy against blood loss in hemophilia A mice in acute and prophylactic bleeding 
scenarios. 
The FVIII concentrations measured in the PK arm were similar for both products showing good 
correlation of PK and PD.

Beagle dogs   
Conclusion: No cardiotoxic effects of BAY

dogs. 
Male rats (Sprague Dawley, 
Crl:CD, Charles River)  
Conclusion: A slight transient stimulation 
of respiration rate was seen in rats at an 
intravenous dose of 400 IU/kg of BAY 81-
8973. The effects were reversible and 
relatively small (~40%). 
Central nervous system (CNS) studies were not conducted since rFVIII is unlikely to penetrate the 
blood brain barrier and based on previous negative findings of other formulations containing Kogenate 
FS. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies were submitted..  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK evaluation of BAY 81-8973 was carried out through direct comparisons with Kogenate FS (current 
licensed product) in male rats and male rabbits. The PK similarity of BAY 81-8973 as compared to 
Kogenate FS was assessed using dose normalized AUC and the terminal half-life values obtained which 
were tested based upon non-inferiority of BAY 81-8973. 
The plasma concentration versus time curves in rats and rabbits showed an almost parallel shift 
(higher AUC for BAY 81-8973) and an almost identical half-life for both compounds. PK evaluation of 
the study data revealed a BAY 81-8973/Kogenate FS ratio regarding AUC of 1.39 and 1.63, 
respectively. Due to the direct relationship between plasma AUCnorm and plasma clearance, clearance 
BAY 81-8973 compared to Kogenate FS was 28% lower in the rat study and 39% lower in the rabbit 
study. The corresponding Vss were also lower for BAY 81-8973 by 33% in the rat and 36 % in the 
rabbit. On the other hand, no relevant change in CL and Vss were observed in hemophilia A mice 
treated iv with BAY 81-8973 or Kogenate FS. These differences are not considered to be of relevance 
for the clinical situation since only clinical studies can determine if there is any significant difference in 
PK between BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS in humans.

Despite the differences in the PK-parameters, the non-inferiority criteria of the PK-studies were met 
and BAY 81-8973 was concluded to have non-inferior PK versus Kogenate FS in rats and rabbits. 
The method used to measure recombinant FVIII in plasma was based on a validated activity based 
assay (Chromogenic assay).  
Absorption 
Absorption studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Distribution 
Distribution studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Metabolism 
Metabolism studies were not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Excretion 
No separate elimination or excretion studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Non-clinical drug – drug interactions 
No nonclinical drug interaction studies were performed.   
Other pharmacokinetic studies

HD = high dose, abs = absolute weight, rel = relative weight 
Toxicokinetics 
In rats, exposure in terms of AUC increased dose-dependently, but slightly to moderately less than 
dose-proportional. Cmax increased less than dose-proportionally from the low to the mid dose and dose-
proportionally from the mid to the high dose. A comparison of exposure on Day 1 and Day 5 revealed 
no relevant changes  
In rabbits, Cmax and AUC increased proportionally with dose. A comparison of exposure on Day 1 and 
Day 5 revealed no relevant changes  
Analysis of anti-FVIII binding- and neutralizing antibodies was performed in the rabbit study. 
Antibodies were detectable from Day 12 onwards, peaked at Day 19 and persisted over the 
observation period of 33 days. From Day 19 onwards, all treated animals responded with both binding 
and neutralizing antibody formation. Titres were dose dependent with respect to both binding and 
neutralizing antibodies 
Genotoxicity 
The Applicant compiled a literature review on the cellular and biological activity of HSP70. In addition, 
an in vitro mammalian gene mutation assay was performed, which was negative.  
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa, since FVIII is an 
endogenous human coagulation protein. In addition, ADA development in animals results in loss of 
exposure over time, preventing the conduct of meaningful long-term studies. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No developmental or reproductive toxicity studies and no juvenile animal studies with BAY 81-
8973/octocog alfa were submitted (see discussion).  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data are discussed as part of repeated dose toxicity. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies. In the single dose 
toxicity study in rabbits (PH-35701) there was a slight increase in the incidence of inflammation and 
thrombosis at the injection site in animals administered 4000 IU/kg bw. This effect was not seen in the 
rabbit repeat-dose toxicity study, where the highest dose was 400 IU/kg bw (same lot as in the single 
dose study). Rats did not show any treatment-related changes at the injection site, neither in the 
single dose study nor in the repeat-dose toxicity study. Good local tolerance was observed at doses 
including the highest dose tested, 4000 IU/kg. The formulation of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa is the 
same as Kogenate FS, which has a clinical history of good local tolerance.

Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Anti-FVIII antibody formation was assessed in a separate 5-week iv study (once weekly dosing), which 
directly compared BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa to Kogenate FS (nonclinical lot) in hemophilia A mice (see 
below) at 40 and 200 IU/kg per week. Hemophilia A mice were selected to compare anti-FVIII antibody 
formation of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa to the currently marketed product, Kogenate FS (a nonclinical 
lot). Frequency and titres were comparable between BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS groups at the end 
of the study. 
Impurities 
No impurities have been detected that would require additional toxicity testing. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation 
factor VIII. It is catabolized during human metabolism and no active molecule is excreted by the 
patient. In accordance with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa as a 
protein is exempted from an environmental risk assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
 Primary pharmacology studies compared BAY 81-8973 to Kogenate FS. In the two efficacy studies 
performed the protection of bleeding from a dose given either 5 minutes or 24 hours prior to injury 
was examined in hemophilia A mice. Irrespectively of treatment option BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS 
provided equivalent protection against bleeding. Pharmacokinetic data in hemophilia A mice indicated 
that BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS provide equivalent total FVIII exposure and that rFVIII plasma 
concentrations correlate to the degree of hemostatic protection observed in the hemophilia A mouse 
(tail clip) efficacy model.   
No secondary pharmacology studies were conducted, which is considered acceptable based on the 
close similarity of BAY 81-8973 to other FVIII products on the market. 
The safety pharmacology studies performed comprised studies on cardiovascular function in 
anesthetized beagle dogs and on respiratory function in conscious unrestrained rats after single 
intravenous administration of BAY 81-8973. Central nervous system (CNS) studies were not 
conducted, which is considered to be acceptable based on the long clinical experience with other FVIII 
products and since FVIII is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier.   
No effects of BAY 81-8973 on cardiovascular hemodynamics and ECG (eg, QT/QTc interval) were 
detected at 120 and 400 IU/kg, respectively (that is 1 to 5 fold higher than the level obtained at a 
clinical dose of 50 IU/kg). In vitro investigations on the hERG potassium channel were not assessed. 
This is considered to be acceptable since BAY 81-8973 is a large molecule which is unlikely to interact 
with or inhibit the hERG potassium channel. 
Respiratory function in rats was affected by the highest dose of BAY 81-8973 studied (400 IU/kg). A 
transient increase in respiratory frequency and minute volume in treated relative to concurrent controls 
was seen, but no effect on Tidal volume. No effects on respiratory function were seen at 120 IU/kg. 
Since the effects were reversible (at 1.5 hours after administration respiratory frequency were at 
control levels) and small (~40%), they are not considered to be of clinical significance.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 20/72 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption studies were not conducted since the route of administration is iv; no distribution studies 
were performed since BAY 81-8973 contains a recombinant endogenous FVIII protein and metabolism, 
elimination or excretion studies are not applicable since rFVIII is an endogenous protein that is 
catabolized via normal physiological pathways. No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted, since 
no drug interaction is expected given the close comparability of BAY 81-8973 to the native human 
FVIII. These omissions are considered to be acceptable. 
Differences were detected in some of the PK-parameters, but BAY 81-8973 was still concluded to have 
non-inferior PK versus Kogenate FS in rats and rabbits. The differences seen are not considered to be 
of relevance for the clinical situation since only clinical studies can determine if there is any significant 
difference in PK between BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS in humans. 
The toxicological evaluation of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa comprises single-dose iv studies in rats and 
rabbits, 5-day repeat-dose iv studies (including toxicokinetic analysis) in rats and rabbits, an in vitro 
genotoxicity study, and an investigative antigenicity study in hemophilia A mice. Local tolerability was 
assessed as part of the single and repeat dose toxicity studies. The chosen route of administration (iv) 
is in accordance with the use in humans. The pivotal non-clinical studies used drug product that was 
used in the first clinical trial. 
Rats and rabbits were selected as non-clinical species based on pharmacological activity of human 
factor VIII in their clotting cascades. The Applicant provided scientific publications that support the 
notion that human factor VIII is indeed pharmacologically active in these species. Only male animals 
were used since the target population is > 99% male. This is considered acceptable. 
The hemophilia A mouse model chosen has been used extensively for FVIII research antigenicity 
studies for this purpose as it has a similar bleeding phenotype as the hemophilia A patients, and allows 
for relatively large group sizes to enable statistical powering of the study. 
The iv single dose toxicity of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa was evaluated in rats and rabbits using doses 
of 400 and 4000 IU/kg bw. The doses used represent 10-100 times (rat) and 80-100 times (rabbit) the 
anticipated clinical dose. There was no mortality, no clinical signs or any other adverse findings up to 
the highest dose tested (4000 IU/kg bw). Some changes in hematology, clinical chemistry and organ 
weight parameters were observed. Since none of these changes was associated with any 
histopathological alterations they are not considered toxicologically relevant. In the rabbit study, one 
animal showed urinary tract inflammation and renal tubular basophilia. These findings are considered 
to be spontaneous in nature and unrelated to treatment with BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa. The NOAELs in 
both single dose studies was the highest dose tested, 4000 IU/kg bw. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies of 5 days duration, with a 4 week recovery period, were performed in rats 
and rabbits with BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa. The doses used were 40, 120 and 400 IU/kg bw. Based on 
exposure, the doses in the rat study correspond to 1, 1.6 and 5.4 times (Cmax) and 0.4, 0.8 and 2 
times (AUC) the upper end of therapeutic exposure. In the rabbit, slightly higher exposures were 
achieved (1, 3.6 and 11.5 times based on Cmax, 0.8, 2 and 6.4 times based on AUC). Considering the 
lack of adverse findings up to 4000 IU/kg bw in the single dose studies, it should have been possible to 
use a higher dose than 400 IU/kg bw in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Nevertheless, since the high 
dose is similar to the highest dose used for repeat-dose toxicity studies with the predecessor Kogenate 
FS, the choice of dose levels is considered acceptable. There were no clinical signs or effects on body 
weight and food consumption in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Some changes in hematology, clinical 
chemistry and organ weight parameters were observed. Since none of these changes was associated 
with any histopathological alterations they are not considered toxicologically relevant. In the rabbit 
study, one high dose recovery animal died of hemorrhagic enteritis at the end of the recovery period.

The clinical and histopathological picture is consistent with clostridiosis, E.coli bacillosis or some other 
bacterial enteric infection. A relationship to treatment with BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa is not considered 
likely.  
No repeat-dose toxicity studies > 5 days were performed. The rationale for this is the presumption that 
animals will develop neutralizing antibodies against human factor VIII and long-term treatment is not 
possible without losing activity of the protein. As demonstrated in rabbits, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
developed in rabbits during the recovery period from Day12 onwards, and were neutralizing (see 
below). In view of this, the Applicant’s justification for not having performed repeat-dose toxicity 
studies longer than 5 days is acceptable.  
ADA formation was not measured in rats. However, there was no indication that ADA affected the 
exposure on Day 5 in rats. In rabbits, ADA were detectable from Day 12 onwards, peaked at Day 19 
and persisted over the observation period of 33 days. From Day 19 onwards, all treated animals 
responded with both binding and neutralizing antibody formation. 
The NOAEL in both repeat-dose toxicity studies was the highest dose tested, 400 IU/kg bw, 
corresponding to margins of 2x (rat) and 11.5x (rabbit) the upper end of therapeutic exposure, based 
on Cmax. 
Good local tolerance of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa was observed in the single and repeated dose 
toxicity studies. However, injection site reactions have been observed in the clinic and are listed in the 
adverse reactions table under section 4.8 of the SmPC, with frequency ‘common’. 
To address the concern that HSP70 in the cell line may cause alterations to untargeted (host cell) 
proteins or DNA, the Applicant conducted an in vitro mouse lymphoma tk locus assay. Due to the 
presence of histidine in the formulation, it was not possible to conduct an Ames test, which would have 
been the best alternative. The concentration of protein used in the mouse lymphoma assay was 
considerably below the limit concentration as defined in ICH S2(R1). However, calculations provided by 
the Applicant indicate a 27-fold margin between the in vitro assay concentrations of host cell proteins 
and those used clinically. The result of the mouse lymphoma assay was negative. HSP70 is not 
detectable in the drug product and if HSP70 was present at the detection limit this would result in 
serum levels 10,000 times below the levels of endogenous HSP70. Furthermore, the presence of the 
HSP70 gene in the BAY 81-8973- producing cell line did not measurably change the composition of 
host cell proteins compared to the marketed product, Kogenate FS. Genotoxic testing of recombinant 
FVIII (Kogenate) showed negative results. Taken together, these data do not indicate any genotoxic 
risk related to the presence of HSP70 in the BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa cell line. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa, since FVIII is an 
endogenous human coagulation protein. In addition, ADA development in animals results in loss of 
exposure over time, preventing the conduct of meaningful long-term studies. This is considered 
acceptable. 
No reproductive toxicology studies were conducted as males comprise the vast majority (>99%) of the 
patient population for hemophilia A, and the clinical trials of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa enrolled only 
male subjects. Furthermore, single dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies did not result in 
histopathological effects on endocrine or reproductive organs. The omission of these studies is 
considered acceptable. 
Juvenile animal studies were not performed, since adverse effects were not seen in organ systems 
undergoing postnatal development, safety data in patients 12 years and older receiving BAY 81-
8973/octocog alfa are available, and target organ sensitivity is not expected to differ between adult

and pediatric patients. In addition, BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa is structurally and functionally similar to 
the marketed product Kogenate FS, which has an established safety profile in pediatric patients. This is 
considered acceptable. 
Anti-FVIII antibody formation was assessed in a 5-week iv study (once weekly dosing), which directly 
compared BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa to Kogenate FS (nonclinical lot) in hemophilia A mice. Blood 
samples analysed for binding and neutralizing antibodies were taken pre-dose, Day 22 and Day 36 
(sacrifice day). Both proteins induced binding and neutralizing antibodies against FVIII. Frequency and 
titres were comparable between BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa and Kogenate FS groups at the end of the 
study (BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa was slightly less immunogenic than Kogenate FS).  
No impurities have been detected that would require additional toxicity testing. The mutagenicity of 
the fermentation buffer component morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) was evaluated in the Ames 
test. The result was negative. The extent of the toxicological evaluation of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa is 
considered acceptable. Rats and rabbits were selected as non-clinical species based on pharmacological 
activity of human factor VIII in their clotting cascades. In addition, the rabbit has been used previously 
as non-rodent species for the toxicological evaluation of other factor VIII products. Only male animals 
were used since the target population is > 99% male.  
Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety pharmacology in vitro genotoxicity, 
and short term repeat-dose toxicity studies. Repeat-dose toxicity studies longer than 5 days, 
reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies, have not been performed. Such studies are 
not considered meaningful due to the production of antibodies against the heterologous human protein 
in animals. Also FVIII is an intrinsic protein and not known to cause any reproductive or carcinogenic 
effects. 
No major toxicity was identified in the single dose or 5-day repeat dose iv toxicity studies, local 
tolerance was good and an in vitro genotoxicity assay gave negative result.  
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII 
during pregnancy is not available. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 
factor VIII. Therefore, Kovaltry should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. It is 
unknown whether Kovaltry is excreted in human milk. The excretion in animals has not been studied. 
Therefore, Kovaltry should be used during breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. No animal fertility 
studies have been conducted with Kovaltry and its effect on human fertility has not been established in 
controlled clinical trials. Since Kovaltry is a replacement protein of endogenous factor VIII, no adverse 
effects on fertility are expected. 
BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation 
factor VIII. It is catabolized during human metabolism and no active molecule is excreted by the 
patient. In accordance with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa as a 
protein is exempted from an environmental risk assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a 
significant risk to the environment.. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the extent of the non-clinical toxicology program is considered adequate. The non-clinical 
aspects of BAY 81-8973/octocog alfa are satisfactorily described and all available information has been 
appropriately included in the SmPC.

2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. An EMA initiated 
inspection of the supportive Leopold II study identified important GCP findings at some of the 
inspected investigational centres. These deficiencies have been extensively discussed and are 
considered to be solved with the applicants’ responses in line with the Inspectors’ recommendations 
and are deemed to have no impact on the overall benefit/risk profile.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology of BAY 81-8973 has been assessed in three multinational, multicenter studies 
Clinical pharmacology of BAY 81-8973 has been assessed in three multinational, multicenter studies 
(Leopold 1, Leopold 2 and Leopold kids), which provide primary PK data. Leopold 1 used a cross over 
design to compare the PK of BAY 81-8973 to Kogenate FS. Leopold 2 included a single dose PK 
evaluation in 4 Japanese patients and Leopold Kids included single dose PK evaluation in 19 subjects.  
In addition PK assessment in a subset of subjects from all these studies, recovery information was also 
available from all subjects who participated in the 3 studies.  A population PK model was also 
developed using data from 183 subjects who participated in these 3 trials.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Leopold I (Study 12954) 
This was a randomized Phase I, II, III, multicenter, open-label, crossover clinical trial was composed of 
3 parts (Part A, Part B and Part C and an optional 1-year extension phase) designed to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profile of BAY 81-8973 in previously treated subjects with 
severe haemophilia A under prophylaxis therapy. 
Part A: PK study. Cross-over for Kogenate FS and BAY 81-8973; randomized for sequence of drug  
Methodology 
Part A (Phase I): Pharmacokinetic non-inferiority of BAY 81-8973 as compared to Kogenate FS was 
evaluated in 2 PK sessions with an at least 3-day wash-out period in between. Single injection of 50 
IU/kg of BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS was given in the cross over study in Part A. The potency 
(dose) was determined by the Chromogenic Substrate assay per European Pharmacopoeia (CS/EP). 
The same dose of BAY 81-8973 was administered for repeated PK measurements at the end of the 
CS/EP period of Part B. Blood samples were collected over 48 h. Subjects who completed Part A could 
continue treatment in Part B and undergo a further PK session with BAY 81-8973 at the end of the 
CS/EP period in Part B. 
 Main criteria for inclusion 
•  Severe hemophilia A, Male, aged 12 to 65 years 
No current evidence of inhibitor antibody No history of FVIII inhibitors

Part A: 28 subjects aged between 12 and 61 years (median: 28.5 years) were randomized  and 
underwent PK sessions both with BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS. 6 subjects were Asians, The total 
number of children was 5. 26 subjects had valid PK data, which were used for the calculation of the PK 
parameters for BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS. 19 underwent a further PK session for the analysis of 
repeated PK.  
Statistical methods 
PK characteristics were analyzed using summary statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation and 
coefficient of variation, geometric mean, geometric standard deviation and coefficient of variation, 
minimum, median, maximum value, and the number of measurements). The primary PK 
characteristics AUC and C max were analyzed assuming log-normally distributed data. The logarithms of 
these characteristics were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) including sequence, subject 
(sequence), period, and treatment effects. Based on this analysis, point estimates (least square mean 
[LSmeans]), exploratory 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the ratio ‘BAY 81-8973 / Kogenate FS’ of 
AUC and Cmax were calculated by re-transformation of the logarithmic data using the intra-individual 
standard deviation of the ANOVA.    
PK data 
Plasma concentrations following the administration of BAY 81-8973 at timepoints 3 to 48 h post-dose 
were slightly higher than those for Kogenate FS. 
The following parameters were derived from the plasma concentration-time profiles of Kogenate FS 
and BAY 81-8973: AUC, AUC0-tn, Cmax, Cmax, norm, T 1/2, MRTIV, CL, Vss. The ratio of both drugs (BAY 
81-8973 / Kogenate FS) and the corresponding 90% CIs were calculated for AUC and Cmax to evaluate 
the non-inferiority of BAY 81-8973 to Kogenate FS. In addition, the ratios and their 95% CIs were 
calculated for all parameters to evaluate on an exploratory basis whether the PK characteristics of BAY 
81-8973 are even more favourable as compared to those of Kogenate FS. Table 11-2 below 
(chromogenic assay) summarizes the results of these analyses for the whole PK analysis population in 
Part A. One stage assay results are also provided.

The ANOVA on all PK parameters, applying the more strict 95% CIs, showed that AUC, AUC0-tn, t½, 
and MRTIV were between 10% and 19% (mean estimates) higher and CL was 16% lower after BAY 
81-8973 injection than after Kogenate FS injection (all 95% CIs lay completely above or below 1; 
value of probability [p-values] <0.02). No relevant differences were detectable for Cmax, Cmax;norm and 
Vss (all 95% CIs lay between 0.86 and 1.08; p-values >0.3).

Overall, the same trend as in the total group was seen in both subgroups for the course of FVIII levels 
with regard to the comparison of BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS. 
Adults (≥18 years) vs. children (12-17 years) 
Overall, the same trend as in the total group was seen in both subgroups for the course of FVIII levels 
with regard to the comparison of BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS. Independent of the drug used, FVIII 
levels in children appeared to decrease slightly faster in children than in adults. The results for AUC, 
AUC0-tn, t½, MRTIV, were numerically higher in both subgroups, and CL was slightly lower after BAY 
81-8973 injection than after Kogenate FS injection, independent of the assay used for FVIII 
determinations.

Repeated PK evaluation (Part B) 
19 of the 22 subjects who had participated in Part A and continued treatment in Part B had valid PK 
measurements from both periods. No Asian subjects participated in Part B. Based on the data of the 19 
subjects with valid PK data during Part A and Part B, the FVIII concentration-by-time curves as 
displayed below were similar for BAY 81-8973 in Part A and Part B, ie, there were no relevant changes 
in the courses of FVIII concentrations after the first BAY 81-8973 injection and after at least 6 months 
of prophylaxis treatment. 
FVIII trough levels 
In all subjects participating in Part B FVIII trough levels were measured at each clinic visit prior to the 
BAY 81-8973 injection for the measurement of recovery. In the subset of subjects with trough levels at 
a mean of 72.9 h (range 61-84h) since previous BAY 81-8973 injection (n = 33 during the CS/EP 
period and n = 31 during the CS/ADJ period), mean FVIII trough levels were 4.2 ± 5.9 IU/dL and 4.6 
± 4.6 IU/kg, respectively (one-stage assay with plasma standard). 
Leopold II (Study 14319)

Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A total of 1535 chromogenic assay observations from 183 subjects were included in the final dataset. A 
total of 1178 one-stage plasma assay observations from 132 subjects (including 150 BLQ observations 
from 74 subjects) were also available. 
Of the 183 males included in the assessment, the following races were represented: 132 White, 31 
Asian, 10 Black, 9 Hispanics and 1 of other Race. Table PK1 below describes the demographic 
characteristics of the dataset used for the evaluation.

The PK of Kovaltry was best described by a two compartment model. Due to an obvious strong effect, 
lean body weight was directly considered in the model development as a covariate on volume of 
distribution and clearance. 
The resulting shrinkage on clearance was 15% and 35% on volume of distribution.  Epsilon shrinkage 
was 8.7%. 
After performing standard covariate analysis techniques (forward inclusion/backward elimination) LBW 
on clearance and LBW on volume of distribution were retained in the model as significant covariates.  
No further covariate was identified to have a significant effect on the PK of Kovaltry. Inclusion of LBW 
explains a large part of the variability of clearance and volume of distribution in the population. 
The estimated overall volume of distribution (~ 3.6 L) is close to human plasma volume, the influence 
of LBW was estimated to be consistent with the expected allometric scaling for LBW, both supporting 
the biological plausibility of the model. 
The parameter estimates of the final population model are provided in Table PK2.

The final model was re-evaluated including the one-stage concentration data. The PK model 
parameters were very similar; a factor explaining the differences in between both measurements was 
estimated as 0.933 supporting the finding from non-compartmental PK analysis that FVIII activity 
determined based on the one-stage assay is lower.

The analysis of all recorded incremental recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a 
median rise of > 2% (> 2 IU/dL) per IU/kg body weight for Kovaltry. This result is similar to the 
reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma. There was no relevant change over the 
6-12 months treatment period.

Race 
Ethnic differences in the PK of BAY 81-8973 are unlikely because elimination of BAY 81-8973, a protein 
preparation, is not mediated by the clearance with drug-metabolizing enzymes having genetic 
polymorphism. PK data are available in 4 Japanese and 6 Chinese patients. In general, the AUCnorm and 
Cmax,norm are within the range of the values seen for Caucasians 
Age 
Clinical studies included patient between the age of 0 to 65 years. The majority of PK data are 
available in adults ≥18 to 65 years old (n = 21). Limited data are available in other age categories 0 to 
<6 years (n = 8), 6 to <12 years (n = 11), 12 to <18 years (n = 5). 
The AUCnorm and Cmax norm values for adolescents (12 to <18 yrs) were within the range of values seen 
for adults (≥18 to 65 years). The Cmax norm values for children 0 to <6 years and 6 to <12 years of age 
tended to be lower than those seen in adults. There was some overlap in the range, but in general the 
values were lower by about 60%. The AUCnorm values also showed a similar pattern, but there was a 
higher degree of overlap in the range of values between children and adults. The t1/2 seemed to be 
similar in all age groups.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
 The PK of FVIII was in general comparable between the two products BAY-81-8973 
(Kovaltry/Kovaltry) and BAY 14-2222 (Kogenate), although about 20% higher total exposure following 
administration of the BAY-81-8973 was seen.  
According to the EMA guideline on investigation of recombinant FVIII products, at least three different 
lots should be used in the development program to cover for potential inter-batch variability. It is 
important to understand/know if variability in exposure/effect can be expected depending on which 
strength of the product used. In the current PK evaluation, following treatment with BAY 81-8973, 
different batches were used and comparable systemic exposure of FVIII was seen independently of vial 
sizes/concentrations. However, according to the guideline the lowest and the highest concentration 
should be used if not otherwise justified. In the Leopold I study, the strengths 250, 500 and 1000 IU of 
BAY 81-8973 were used. The lack of PK data following the use of 3000 IU is considered acceptable 
given the individualized dosing and the effect and safety data available; furthermore bioequivalence 
have been shown following injection of 2000 IU and 3000 IU of BAY 14-2222.  
The PK of Kovaltry was evaluated in all 3 clinical studies. In Part A 26 patients contributed PK data to 
the analyses. As per the inclusion criteria, all had at least a history of 150 exposure days to 
recombinant of plasma-derived FVIII treatment. This is in line with EMA guideline requirements for 
evaluating PK of recombinant FVIII products in previously treated patients (PTPs) ≥ 12 years of age.        
The primary PK objective in the pivotal study was to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic non-inferiority 
of Kovaltry to Kogenate, a currently licensed recombinant FVIII product, using bioequivalence criteria. 
This was achieved when evaluated with both the one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic 
substrate assay, although the two products could not be shown to be bioequivalent. The cumulative 
exposure for Kovaltry was shown to be significantly higher than exposure for Kogenate.   
In the main clinical studies PK and efficacy comparisons were made between Kovaltry dosed based on 
the chromogenic assay and Kovaltry doses based on the chromogenic assay but adjusted by a factor to 
mimic the dosing based on the one stage clotting assay. For the determination of the factor to be used 
for the one-stage adjusted potency, the amount of active FVIII in a number of lots of Kogenate FS and 
Assessment report

Kovaltry was measured using the chromogenic substrate assay and using the one-stage clotting assay 
for comparison. The results revealed an average ratio in the amount of active FVIII detected by each of 
the assays of 1.23 (ratio of chromogenic: one stage assay). The reciprocal value, i.e., 0.813, 
determines the relationship of determinations with the one-stage assay in relationship to the 
chromogenic assay thus the amount determined with the one-stage assay was ~19% lower than the 
one determined with the chromogenic assay. (See discussion on clinical efficacy 
The PK profile of BAY 81-8973 after single-dose administration (50 IU/kg) was at least non-inferior to 
that of Kogenate FS. FVIII plasma concentrations, determined both with the one-stage assay and the 
chromogenic assay, indicated a more favorable PK profile of BAY 81-8973 than of Kogenate FS in 
terms of a higher AUC, prolonged t1/2 and MRTIV and a lower CL (all exploratory p-values <0.02, 
ANOVA), and comparable for Cmax and Vss values (all exploratory p-values >0.3). 
All estimated PK parameter of Kovaltry were physiologically reasonable. Lean Body Weight (LBW) 
explains a large part of the variability for both CL and Vc as expected for a compound mainly 
distributed in plasma. Dosing based on a body weight basis decreases the variability in the resultant 
exposure, although allometric dosing based on LBW might reduce this variability slightly more. The 
estimated influence of LBW was close to factors known from allometric scaling, e.g, the published 
allometric factor permits scaling to pediatrics or between different species. This is consistent with the 
observed lower concentrations in children as compared to adults.  
Lean body weight was statistically superior to total body weight as a predictor of CL and volume of 
distribution. This suggests that plasma volume estimations based on total body weight may 
overestimate the volume in overweight/obese patients and underestimate it in underweight patients. 
The applicant was asked to discuss how this could affect the accuracy of the weight based dosing 
recommendations usually applied for coagulation factor substitution. It has, however, for long been 
accepted to calculate initial doses of coagulation factors from BW as an approximate marker for plasma 
volume as reflected also in the CHMP core SmPCs. Nowadays there is a general discussion if not lean 
body weight would give a somewhat more precise estimate and the data provided by the Applicant 
seems to support such an assumption. However, an approach to provide dose recommendations based 
on lean BW would require a general consensus and in principle be implemented for all coagulation 
factor concentrates. For the time being the proposed BW based dose recommendations for 
Kovaltry/Kovaltry can be accepted. The statements in the SmPC that doses should be individualised 
are considered sufficient. 
No further clinically relevant and statistically significant covariates were detected. 
The FVIII activity determined based on the one-stage assay is lower as compared to that based on 
chromogenic assay. 
The non-linear, allometric relationship between CL and LBW results in a relatively lower exposure in 
paediatric patients when dosed per kg. The incremental recovery calculated as dose normalized Cmax 
was lower in children compared to adults following a dose of 50 IU/kg. 
Subgroup analysis of the PK data showed the cumulative and maximal exposures to be significantly 
lower in children than in adults, in Asians compared to non-Asians and in those administered a lower 
dose of Kovaltry compared to those administered higher doses. This was also seen for the FVIII trough 
level evaluations. The data in Asians it appears was confounded by the high proportion of children in 
that subgroup. The lower exposure in children is evident from the data and is a recognised 
phenomenon. Pop PK analyses support this observation, showing that the relative clearance is higher 
in patients with lower lean body weight. Therefore, the resulting concentration even when given the 
same IU/kg dose is lower than expected by the correction of the dose by weight. This relationship in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 37/72 
 
 
 
 
 
the clinical studies led to a higher proportion of patients failing to maintain FVIII trough levels above 
2IU/dL. Combined with the data in the clinical studies showing higher bleed rates and FVIII 
consumption for bleeds and lower in vivo recoveries in children, the PK data highlight the risk that 
children particularly, those less than 12 years may be at risk of being underdosed. The applicant has 
been asked to comment. 
The AUC is ~25-30% lower in children aged 12-17 years as compared to adults ≥18 years. 
PK evaluation was also undertaken after repeated dosing, which showed that the outcome largely 
remained unchanged.  Repeated PK measurements after 6 to 12 months of prophylaxis treatment with 
BAY81-8973 did not indicate any relevant changes in PK characteristics after long-term treatment. 
No other significant predictors of PK parameters were identified in the PPK analysis. 
Clinical studies did not include subjects aged 65 years or more. However, clinical experience with other 
FVIII products has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients (See RMP). As 
with any patient receiving rFVIII, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.  
BAY 81-8973 contains a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor, 
FVIII that is catabolized. There are no known metabolizing pathways and no known Cytochrome P450 
(CYP) involvement. No PK interaction is expected with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 
enzymes. Therefore no interaction studies have been conducted with CYP-metabolized drugs 
potentially administered concomitantly. 
In the clinical studies (Leopold I, Leopold II and Leopold Kids) several medications were used 
concomitantly. The most commonly used (in >10% of the total subjects in the safety data set) 
concomitant medications were paracetamol, clavulanate potassium, ibuprofen. The overall safety data 
from the study reflects the safety and tolerability information in the patient population that may have 
used one or more concomitant drugs. 
Recombinant proteins have very low potential to interact with the extracellular or intracellular (pore) 
domains on hERG channel and, therefore, are highly unlikely to inhibit hERG channel activity. 
Furthermore, FVIII is a large and very specific molecule that cannot cross plasma membranes and 
therefore would be unable to access and block hERG channel, in contrast with typical small molecule 
drugs. Consequently, it is not appropriate to conduct a study to evaluate the QTc effects (Vargas HM 
2008). Moreover, no QT effects were observed in the safety pharmacology study of BAY 81-8973 in 
dogs. 
Kovaltry is a recombinant human factor VIII product. The pharmacodynamic effects of repeated dosing 
and episodic dosing are assessed in the target patient population of severe haemophilia a patients, 
principally through the evaluation of clotting parameters, prevention of bleeds and response of bleeds 
to treatment - hence measures of efficacy (See clinical efficacy). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of Kovaltry is well documented and all relevant information has been 
included in SmPC.

Sample size 
The sample size for this study is consistent with regulatory requirements (EMEA CHMP / 
BPWP/144533/2009: Recombinant and Human FVIII derived-products, which requires a total of at 
least 50 subjects. An addendum objective of Part B of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of 
CS/EP to CS/ADJ in bleeding during prophylactic treatment with BAY 81-8973, after combining the 
results of this study with the results from Leopold II. It has been assumed subjects will have an 
average of 5 bleeds per year on each potency (CS/EP and CS/ADJ). Subtracting these bleeding rates 
within each subject, we expect a mean difference of 0 bleeds per year and a standard deviation of 6 
bleeds per year. Using an one-sided 95% confidence interval, 80% power, an attrition rate of 15%, a 
sample size of 120 subjects will be required using a non-inferiority margin of 1.5 bleeds per year. 
Randomisation 
Subjects participating in Part A or Part B were assigned to treatment order according to a 
randomization system generated by the Sponsor’s Randomization Management. In part C subjects 
were not randomized.

This is an open label study 
Statistical methods 
The statistical evaluation was to be performed by using the software package SAS release 9.1 or 
higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, United States). All data were to be listed and 
summary tables provided. The number of data available and missing data, mean, standard deviation, 
and other summary statistics were to be calculated for continuous data. Frequency tables were to be 
generated for categorical data. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical tests were to be 2-sided and 
performed at the 0.05 significance level. Non-inferiority confidence intervals were to be one-sided.

Results 
Participant flow 
Five subjects of Part B underwent major surgeries during the extension period. In Part C (Major 
Surgery Arm) 5 subjects were enrolled.  for seven major surgeries.  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 26 study investigational centers in 12 countries between December 2009 
and June 2012. 
Sixty-two male subjects aged between 12 and 65 years received treatment with BAY 81-8973 in Part 
B. Ten patients were between 12 and 17 years of age. 
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations leading to the exclusion from the PP population defined for Part B were 
identified in 3. All were non-compliant with dosing. A further randomized subject in Part B terminated 
the study before he had received study medication and was excluded from all analyses.

Conduct of the study 
There were 6 global amendments to the original study protocol most of which were clarifications or of 
editorial nature. More important amendments concerned the definitions of major and minor surgery, 
revision in time points for PK measurements and a change in secondary objective of the study from 
“demonstrate the non-inferiority of BAY 81-8973 based on potency determinations (CS/EP vs CS/ADJ)” 
to “compare BAY 81-8973 based on potency determinations (CS/EP vs CS/ADJ) as measured by 
bleeding rate.

Twenty-three of the 28 subjects (82.1%) participating in Part A and 55 of the 62 subjects (88.7%) 
participating in Part B had at least one medical history finding. The most frequent findings referred to 
hemophilic arthropathy, which was present in approximately 70% of the subjects and associated 
conditions (eg, hepatitis C in approximately 65% of the subjects and hepatitis B in approximately 30% 
of the subjects). 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Concomitant medications that were ongoing or newly started during the study were reported in 93.5% 
of the subjects in Part B (including those who had previously participated in Part A). These were most 
frequently antihemorrhagics (71.0%, mainly administered during the screening phase), analgesics 
(45.2%), antibacterials for systemic use (40.3%), and antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products 
(35.5%). 
Numbers analysed 
The ITT population consists of 62 patients, the PP population consists of N=59. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable was the annualized number of spontaneous and trauma bleeds, untreated 
bleeds and bleeds with missing reason (together described as “total bleeds”). 
Table E1 Number of total and annualized bleeds (ITT population) 
In both sequence groups, the median differences between the annualized total bleeding rates in the 2 
potency periods before and after the cross-over were 0.0 bleeds/year. The results of the subgroup 
analysis showed that the median annualized bleeding rate (total bleeds) was higher in children than in 
adults (median: 2.83 bleeds/year vs. 1.02 bleeds/year), but in contrast to the adults, most of the 
bleeds in children (69.7%) were trauma bleeds. 
Considering only the data of subjects with prophylaxis as most recent treatment (n = 50) who had an 
annualized (total) bleeding rate of 3.67 ± 5.23 bleeds/year (median: 1.03) on treatment with BAY 81-
8973, the annualized bleeding rate during the study was markedly lower than in the year before the 
study (mean ± SD: 6.9 ± 8.6 bleeds/ year; median: 4.0 bleeds/year.  
Other efficacy variables referring to bleeds 
The bleeding characteristics are given in the table below.

Table E2. Distribution of bleeding types 
Approximately 80% of the 241 bleeds were joint bleeds and approximately 7-8% each were 
skin/mucosal bleeds or muscle bleeds. There were no relevant differences between the two potency 
assignment periods in bleeding characteristics, neither with regard to bleeding type nor with regard to 
their severity. The highest number of joint bleeds in total (n=191 in total) occurred in the knee (n=64 
or 33.5%), followed by ankle (n=57 or 29.8%) and elbow (n=54 or 28.3%).  
Treatment of bleeds in Part B 
A total of 484 BAY 81-8973 injections were administered for the treatment of the 241 bleeds. The 
median number of injections per bleed was 1.0 in both periods reflecting that most bleeds, 
approximately 70%, were managed successfully with one injection, and another 15 % with two 
injections. The mean actual total annual doses for bleeds were 343±427 vs. 758±1056 IU/kg/year for 
the 31 and 32 patients experiencing bleedings in the CS/EP and SC/ADJ periods, respectively. 
Response to treatment 
Subjects were asked to assess the response to treatment of bleeds. This was actually done for 235 of 
the 241 bleeds in total. The response was assessed as “good” or “excellent” in 80.9% of the cases.

Table E3. Response to treatment of bleeds in Part B (ITT population) 
In vivo recovery 
Based on the pre- and post-injection FVIII levels determined with the chromogenic assay, and 
excluding invalid data, mean in vivo recovery values with CS/EP potency assignment were 
approximately 2.4 kg/dL, which were – as expected – approximately 20% lower than with CS/ADJ 
potency assignment (2.9 - 3.0 kg/dL). There were no relevant differences between the in vivo recovery 
values at start and at mid/end of the respective periods.  
Changes in QoL in Part B 
Analysis of the changes from Baseline to 28 Month 12 using the Haemo-QoL-A questionnaires did not 
show any relevant changes in QoL. The mean Haemo- QoL-A total score (adults) at Baseline was 74.6 
± 16.7 points and remained nearly unchanged (median change: 2.0 points) up to the end of the 12-
month treatment period.  
Extension period of Leopold 1, part B 
All subjects who completed the 1-year treatment period in Part B were offered an option to participate 
in the 1-year extension period. During the extension period, subjects were to continue with the 
prophylaxis treatment with CS/EP potency assignment and the schedule followed during the CS/EP 
treatment period for 1 additional year.  
The primary efficacy variable for the extension period was the annualized number of “all bleeds”. This 
and all other efficacy variables were analyzed by period (Part B and extension period) and for both 
periods combined using summary statistics. The analysis was based on the data of the ITT population.  
Fifty-five of the 61 subjects, who had completed Part B participated in the extension study (8 of these 
were adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years), and 43 of these subjects completed it. The median 
number of exposure days in Part B and the extension period was 157 ED and 154 ED, respectively.  
There were no relevant differences in efficacy of prophylaxis or treatment of bleedings between part B 
period and the extension period. The majority of the observed bleeds were joint bleeds (78.8%). No 
relevant influence of the weekly frequency of injections (2x/week or 3x/week) or weekly dose (<80 
IU/kg or ≥80 IU/kg) became apparent.

The purpose of this Phase-II/III, randomized, multicenter, open-label, intra-individual, crossover study 
was to demonstrate superiority of prophylaxis over on-demand therapy in subjects diagnosed with

severe hemophilia A and treated with BAY 81-8973. Eighty subjects were to be randomized to one of 6 
treatment arms (see Figure E3). All subjects in the 6 arms were to undergo either prophylaxis or on-
demand treatment for a period of 6-months. After a 2-3-day washout period (for the prophylaxis 
subjects), subjects were to be crossed-over (within their respective treatment groups) to the alternate 
treatment arm (potency assignment of BAY 81-8973 as determined by either CS/EP or CS/ADJ) for a 
6-month treatment period.  
Figure E6. Schematic overview of the design of study Leopold 2 
During the study, all subjects were to receive treatment only with BAY 81-8973. The dosage range for 
prophylaxis treatment was to be 20, 25, or 30 IU/kg administered 2 times per week (low dose) or 30, 
35, or 40 IU/kg administered 3 times per week (high dose) as assigned at randomization. The specific 
dose per injection for each subject was to be selected by the investigator. Once a subject had been 
assigned a certain prophylaxis dose, the assignment was to be maintained for the duration of the 
study. The dosing for on-demand treatment and for breakthrough bleeds in the prophylaxis group was 
to be dependent upon the bleeding location and severity and was to be consistent with acceptable 
standards of care.  
In vivo recovery was to be assessed at the beginning and end of each 6-month potency assignment 
period in subjects randomized to prophylaxis treatment. Subjects requiring any surgeries (major or 
minor) during the study were to be treated with BAY 81-8973  
The inclusion criteria were essentially similar to the criteria applied in the Leopold 1 study except for 
previous treatment which had to be on-demand only.

Results 
The ITT population (N = 80) was used for the primary efficacy analysis. The efficacy analysis of the PP 
population (N = 79) is to be considered supportive.  
Study drug administration was documented by the subjects on the EPD and regularly monitored by the 
study staff at site. The majority of subjects (79/80 or 98.8%) were compliant with their treatment 
schedule according to the randomization and the dose as assigned by the responsible investigator at 
site. One subject was considered as non-compliant and excluded from the PP population. 
The primary objective in this study was to demonstrate the superiority of prophylaxis over on-demand 
therapy as measured by the number of bleeds during the 12 months of treatment with BAY 81-8973. 
Potency assignment (CS/EP or CS/ADJ) or dose (high-dose or low-dose prophylaxis) were not to be 
considered in this primary comparison.  
Secondary objectives were to show the superiority of the prophylaxis treatment over on-demand 
treatment for both types of potency assignments (CS/EP and CS/ADJ). The third and last secondary 
objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the CS/EP potency assignment to the CS/ADJ 
potency assignment as measured by the number of bleeds controlled by ≤ 2 injections of BAY 81-8973 
in subjects treated on demand. 
Exploratory objectives were to compare the bleeding frequencies during prophylaxis treatment with 
CS/EP vs. CS/ADJ potency assignment and with low-dose vs. high-dose.  
A total of 1497 bleeds were reported in the ITT population during this study (1204 in the 21 subjects in 
the on-demand group and 293 in the 59 subjects in the prophylaxis group. The median annualized 
bleeding rates derived from these data were 60 bleeds/year and 2 bleeds/year, respectively, reflecting 
a highly significant difference (p<0.0001). Thus the primary objective of this study to demonstrate the 
superiority of prophylaxis over on-demand treatment with BAY 81-8973 was met.  
The secondary objectives to show the superiority of the prophylaxis treatment over on-demand 
treatment for both types of potency assignments (CS/EP and CS/ADJ) were also met (p<0.0001 for 
both comparisons). 
Both low and high dose prophylaxis were associated with a similar highly significant reduction in 
bleeding rates as compared with on demand treatment (exploratory objective). 
As only 1 subject was excluded from the PP population, there were no relevant differences between the 
results for the two analysis populations. 
With CS/EP dose assignment, 96.8% (median) of the bleeds/subject were controlled by ≤ 2 injections, 
as were 100.0% (median) with CS/ADJ dosing. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment 
difference ranged between -5.45 and 4.63% and the lower limit of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval 
was -4.90%, well above the predefined delta of -10% for non-inferiority (last secondary objective).  
Other efficacy variables referring to bleeds 
The mean annualized number of spontaneous bleeds was 45.3 ± 22.1 bleeds/year in the on-demand 
group and 3.5 ± 6.1 bleeds/year in the prophylaxis group, whereby it was higher in the low-dose than 
in the high-dose group (4.5 ± 7.1 vs. 2.6 ± 4.9 bleeds/year). Conversely, the mean annualized 
number of trauma bleeds was slightly lower in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group (0.9 ± 
1.5 vs. 1.5 ± 2.8 bleeds/year, but these rates were about 10-fold lower than in the on-demand group 
(12.3 ± 16.4 bleeds/year). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 51/72 
 
 
 
 
 
As most of the bleeds were joint bleeds, the annualized number of joint bleeds was again about 90% 
lower during prophylaxis than during on-demand treatment (4.3 ± 6.5 bleeds/year vs. 43.8 ± 24.7 
bleeds/year). 
In vivo recovery 
Based on the pre- and post-injection FVIII levels determined with the chromogenic assay, and 
excluding invalid data, mean in vivo recovery values based on nominal dose of 50 IU/kg with CS/EP 
potency assignment were approximately 2.1 kg/dL, which were – as expected – approximately 20% 
lower than with CS/ADJ potency assignment (2.4 – 2.5 kg/dL). The mean in-vivo recovery measured 
with the one-stage assay was 2.1 kg/dL. 
There were no relevant differences between the in vivo recovery values at start and at end of the 
respective periods.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
•  Pooled analyses, Leopold 1 and Leopold 2 
The objectives with regard to efficacy of the pooled analyses were to  
• 
• 
• 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of prophylactic treatment with BAY 81-8973 dose 
determined by CS/EP versus dose determined by CS/ADJ as measured by bleeding rate.   
To demonstrate the efficacy of BAY 81-8973 for the treatment of bleeds and prophylaxis. 
To compare in vivo recovery during each 6-month treatment period based on potency 
determinations (CS/EP versus CS/ADJ) during prophylactic treatment with BAY 81-8973.   
The analysis of the primary objective of this addendum was based on the data of the 118 subjects 
valid for the PP population. The primary analysis was also done with the data of the 121 subjects of the 
ITT population.  
The variable for the evaluation of the primary addendum objective, to demonstrate the non-inferiority 
of prophylactic treatment with BAY 81-8973 dose determined by CS/EP versus dose determined by 
CS/ADJ, was the annualized number of total bleeds. For this purpose, the differences in annualized 
bleeding rates within each subject (CS/ADJ minus CS/EP) were considered for all subjects having 
annualized bleeding rates for both potency periods, irrespective of the study. This was done by 
estimating the 1-sided 95% CI for the median difference with Hodges-Lehmann estimators.  
The absolute median annual bleeding rates in the PP population were 1.98 bleeds/year in both periods 
(interquartile ranges: 0.00 – 5.92 bleeds/year for CS/EP and 0.00 – 7.34 bleeds/year for CS/ADJ). The 
Hodges-Lehmann estimate for the median difference between both periods of dose assignment 
(CS/ADJ minus CS/EP) was -0.012 bleeds/ year, with a lower limit of the 1-sided 95% CI of -1.038 
bleeds/year. Thus, as the lower limit was clearly above the predefined non-inferiority margin of -1.5 
bleeds/year, the non-inferiority of CS/EP dosing versus CS/ADJ dosing was statistically proven. 
Repetition of this analysis with the data of the ITT population resulted in a Hodges-Lehmann estimate 
for the median difference of 0.011 bleeds/year and a lower limit of the 1-sided 95% CI of -0.972 
bleeds/year, which confirmed the results of the primary analysis.

No relevant differences between the bleeding rates during the CS/EP and CS/ADJ periods were 
detectable using the data from Part B of Leopold I (extension period excluded) and all data from 
Leopold II prophylaxis subjects.  
There were no relevant differences in bleeding type (spontaneous vs. trauma) or bleeding localisations 
or bleeding severity between the Leopold 1 and 2 studies and furthermore not between the two periods 
of dose assignment. 
Treatment satisfaction was numerically somewhat better in Leopold I than in Leopold II. 
Table E11. Treatment satisfaction Leopold 1 and 2 and pooled 
In vivo recovery pooled analyses added no new information in relation to the consistent results in the 
two individual studies. 
Hemostatic control during major and minor surgeries 
Thirteen major surgeries were performed in 11 patients. Twelve major surgeries for which BAY 81-
8973 was used for hemostatic control were performed during Leopold I [5 during the extension of Part 
B and 7 during Part C (major surgery arm)], and 1 during Leopold II. With one exception 
(compartment syndrome splitting), all surgeries were elective. 
Seven of the 13 major surgeries in total were orthopedic surgeries.   
The blood loss during and after surgery was within expected ranges; the hemostatic control was 
assessed by the investigators/surgeons as good (76.9%) or excellent (23.1%) in all cases. 
Thirty-two subjects underwent a total of 46 minor surgeries (26 surgeries in 18 subjects during 
Leopold I and 20 surgeries in 14 subjects in Leopold II. Twenty-eight of the minor surgeries (60.9%) 
were dental surgeries.  
The hemostasis was assessed as excellent (53.5%) or good (46.5%) in all cases. No subjects required 
any blood transfusions.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Study in Children, “Leopold Kids” 
The study in children is an on-going multi-center Phase III uncontrolled open-label trial to evaluate 
safety and efficacy of BAY 81-8973 in children with severe hemophilia A under prophylaxis therapy. 
The submitted CSR presents the results of the analysis of the children study (Study 13400) Part A 
(main study) in paediatric, previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia A. The 6-month 
data for PTPs are analysed as a final analysis of this part of the study. Study Part B in paediatric, 
previously untreated patients (PUPs), and the extension periods of both Part A and Part B are ongoing.

Results 
A total of 51 PTPs (25 in the age group 0 to <6 years and 26 in the age group 6 to 12 years), mainly of 
white race and with a median age of 4.0 (younger age group) and 9.0 (older age group) participated in 
the main study of Part A and completed the 6 month treatment period with BAY 81-8973.  
One subject in the age group 6 to 12 years was excluded from the PP population as he had a treatment 
interruption of >14 days, which was rated as a major protocol deviation. In none of the other subjects 
was a relevant deviation from the treatment schedule identified.  
Primary efficacy variable was the annualized number of total bleeds (sum of spontaneous bleeds, 
trauma bleeds, untreated bleeds and injections with reason=other) during prophylaxis treatment that 
occurred within 48 h of the previous prophylaxis injection.

As shown in Table E13, not only the percentage of subjects affected, but also the absolute numbers of 
bleeds within 48 h after the previous prophylaxis injection and the mean/median annualized numbers 
of bleeds were slightly lower in the age group 6 to 12 years than in the age group 0 to <6 years. 
Table E13. Bleeds within 48 hours of the previous prophylactic injection  
Approximately 60% (or 32/53) of bleeds that occurred within 48 h after a previous prophylaxis 
injection were trauma bleeds. The percentage of bleeds which were joint bleeds was approximately 
twice as high in the older than in the younger age group (6 vs. 11 joint bleeds). Overall, 54.9% of 
patients did not experience any bleed within 48 h after any prophylaxis injection during the 6 months 
observation period and >75% of subjects did not experience any spontaneous or joint bleed within the 
48h period.  
The results in the PP population were almost identical to those in the ITT population. Whilst the 
primary efficacy variable limited the interval of interest to the first 48 h following a prophylaxis 
injection, one of the secondary efficacy variables (“annualized number of total bleeds during 
prophylaxis treatment”) and several additional efficacy variables covered the bleeding frequencies 
during prophylaxis treatment in Part A, independent of the time of injections.  
The mean number of total bleeds per year was 3.75 ± 4.98 (median 1.90 bleeds/year with an 
interquartile range from 0.00 to 6.02. 
2.30 ± 3.98 trauma bleeds/year (median 0.00, interquartile range 0.00 to 3.87).  
For spontaneous bleeds the mean annualized number of bleeds was 0.63 ± 1.49 in the younger age 
group and 0.92 ± 2.61 in the older age group. 
The mean annualized number of joint bleeds was 1.24 ± 2.74. 
There were 3 severe bleeds, all other bleeds were either mild (51.5%) or moderate (45.4%) in 
intensity.  
When compared to the older age group, the percentage of trauma bleeds in subjects in the younger 
age group was markedly higher (82% vs. 62%), their percentage of skin/mucosa bleeds was higher 
(54% vs. 38%), and a markedly higher percentage of their bleeds was mild in intensity (64% vs. 38 
%).  
There were no relevant differences between the age groups with respect to the treatment of bleeds 
(number of injections needed, time from previous prophylaxis dose etc.) 
The response to treatment was assessed as “good” or “excellent” in 90.1% of the cases (97.8% in the 
younger age group and 81.0% in the older age group).

There were no relevant differences between the in vivo recovery values in the two age groups, and the 
in vivo recovery values were similar at all time-points with a mean (Q1; Q3) of 1.6 (1.5; 1.8) in the 
young age group and 1.8 (1.5; 1.9) in the older age group. 
In subgroup analyses the subjects treated with higher BAY 81-8973 average doses (either per injection 
or per week) somewhat less frequently experienced any bleeds than subjects treated with lower doses 
as could be expected. 
Leopold Kids Part B (treatment of PUPs) is ongoing. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The rFVIII protein BAY 81-8973 is similar to the currently marketed product Kogenate FS/KOGENATE 
Bayer in terms of rFVIII protein concentration, has the same composition of excipients and an identical 
FVIII amino acid sequence, molecular formula and proteolytic processing as Kogenate FS, with the only 
difference that it is produced with a new cell bank improving FVIII productivity.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the provided clinical study programme for BAY 81-8973 is considered to fulfil the 
requirements detailed in the CHMP guideline for recombinant factor VIII products satisfactorily.  
All patients included in the clinical study programme had severe haemophilia A.  
The applicant has in accordance with the European Pharmacopeia requirements based the potency 
labelling for Kovaltry/Kovaltry on a chromogenic assay for FVIII while the approved predecessor 
Kogenate FS potency labelling is based on a clotting assay (see Clinical Pharmacology discussion). 
Most European laboratories use the one stage clotting assay for estimations of plasma fVIII levels. In 
the SmPC it is referenced that the FVIII concentration of Kovaltry can be measured in plasma with a 
one-stage coagulation assay as well as with a chromogenic assay using the routine methods of the 
laboratory. 
Initial measurement of lots from the predecessor Kogenate FS and BAY 81-8973 using the 
chromogenic substrate assay and the one-stage clotting assay for comparison revealed an average 
ratio in the amount of active FVIII detected by each of the assays of 1.23 (ratio of chromogenic: one 
stage assay), which equals a ~19% lower amount determined by one-stage assay than by 
chromogenic assay. Later and more extensive characterisation of the relationship between the assays 
revealed a much more narrow difference as detailed in the quality report. Using the average ratio, the 
nominal CS/ADJ potency was calculated and printed on the labels of the drug vials (eg, 203 IU for the 
250 IU vial, 406 IU for the 500 IU vial, 813 IU for the 1000 IU vial and 1626 IU for the 2000 IU vial). 
Since patients were dosed according to the nominal dose patients received approximately 20% to 25% 
more dose when treated according to the CS/ADJ labelling than with the CS/EP labelling. In Leopold I 
(Parts A, C, and extension) and Leopold Kids, potency (dose) assignments were based on CS/EP only, 
whereas in Leopold I (Part B) and Leopold II, patients received treatment based on both CS/EP and 
CS/ADJ using an intra-individual, cross-over design.  
The size of the provided clinical study programme for BAY 81-8973 is considered to fulfil the 
requirements detailed in the CHMP guideline for recombinant factor VIII products satisfactorily. All 
patients included in the studies summarised below had severe haemophilia A. 
The pivotal study, Leopold I was divided into three parts, in part A the pharmacokinetics of BAY 81-
8973 was characterised and compared with the predecessor Kogenate FS in 26 patients above the age 
of 11. The mean t1/2 for BAY 81-8973 was estimated to 14 hours in adults and 12 in children, i.e. well

within the range for what is expected for an unmodified fVIII. Part A is further described and discussed 
in the pharmacokinetic assessment report.  
Leopold II, was primarily designed to meet the FDA requirements for a labelling including long-term 
prophylactic therapy and is regarded to be a supportive study by the CHMP. It was a randomized, 
multicenter, open-label, intra-individual, crossover study aiming to demonstrate superiority of 
prophylaxis over on-demand therapy in subjects diagnosed with severe haemophilia A and treated with 
BAY 81-8973. Eighty subjects were randomized to one of 6 treatment arms. There were three main 
arms with different dosing, on demand, 2x/week low dose prophylaxis or 3x/week high dose 
prophylaxis. Within each of these dosing arms patients could be treated either according to the CS/EP 
or CS/ADJ potency labelling in intra-individual sequential cross-over design thus making up in total the 
6 arms. It provides, however, additional safety data, data from surgery and additional information on 
dosing according to the different potency labelling. 
The study in children is an on-going multi-center Phase III uncontrolled open-label trial to evaluate 
safety and efficacy of BAY 81-8973 in children with severe hemophilia A under prophylaxis therapy. 
The 6-month data for PTPs (part A) are analysed as a final analysis of this part of the study. Study Part 
B in paediatric, previously untreated patients (PUPs), and the extension periods of both Part A and Part 
B are ongoing. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Sixty-two patients above the age of 11 were recruited to part B where they were treated with BAY 81-
8973 for twelve months with 6 months per potency (CS/EP versus CS/ADJ) in an open labelled intra-
individual cross-over design in a randomised sequence. The dosage range for prophylaxis treatment 
was 20-50 IU/kg administered 2-3 times per week at the investigator’s discretion. All breakthrough 
bleeds were to be treated with BAY 81-8973. In vivo recovery was to be assessed twice during each 
period, at the start and at 3 months or at the end of each 6-month potency assignment period.  
The median annualized number of “total bleeds” (spontaneous and trauma bleeds, untreated bleeds 
and bleeds with missing reason) (primary efficacy variable) was 1.0 (Q1;Q3, 0.0;5,1). As expected a 
large inter-individual variability was observed. The bleeding rates are in line with what can be expected 
during successful prophylaxis in severe haemophilia A.  
The median number of injections per bleed was 1.0 in both periods reflecting that most bleeds, appr. 
70%, were managed successfully with one injection, and another 15 % with two injections.  
The response was assessed as “good” or “excellent” in 80.9% of the cases. These results are in line 
with what is usually seen for effective fVIII products. 
The open label design of the trial made the investigators and patients aware of the differences in 
potency labelling and the different amounts of active substance given during the two 6 months periods. 
However, compliance during the study periods to the initially decided prophylactic dose was 
demonstrated to be good. 
As usually seen in severe haemophilia the majority of bleedings were joint bleeds (80% of totally 241 
bleeds) and approximately 7-8% each were skin/mucosal bleeds or muscle bleeds. . Mean in vivo 
recovery values i.e. increase in plasma levels of FVIII achieved with a certain weight based dose of 
BAY 81-8973 - with CS/EP potency assignment were within the expected range for fVIII products 
(approximately 2 kg/dL). 
All subjects who completed the 1-year treatment period in Part B were offered to participate in the 1-
year extension period and 55 patients accepted to continue and 43 finalised the extension phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 57/72 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no relevant differences in efficacy in prophylaxis or treatment of bleedings between part B 
period and the extension period. 
A total of 1497 bleeds were reported in the ITT population during Leopold II study (1204 in the 21 
subjects in the on-demand group and 293 in the 59 subjects in the prophylaxis group). The median 
annualized bleeding rates derived from these data were 59.96 bleeds/year and 1.98 bleeds/year, 
respectively, reflecting a highly significant difference (p<0.0001). Thus the primary objective of this 
study to demonstrate the superiority of prophylaxis over on-demand treatment with BAY 81-8973 was 
met. 
The bleeding rate in the combined high-dose group is somewhat lower than in the low-dose group as 
could be expected. The mean total dose (prophylaxis and treatment) per year was 78% higher during 
high dose group than during the low dose group. The differences in bleeding rates between the two 
labelling periods were minor (where the difference in actual dosing was appr. 20%). These figures 
demonstrate the lack of precision in the estimation of a dose response relationship in clinical studies 
within this area. This is not surprising taking the expected large inter-individual variability into account 
and the rather low number of patients available for clinical studies. The correlation between plasma 
fVIII levels and bleeding tendency is not absolute as numerous other factors influence the bleeding 
rates.  
The fVIII recovery results were very similar to the results obtained in Leopold I and there were no 
relevant differences between the in vivo recovery values at start and at end of the respective periods.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
A total of 51 PTPs in Leopold Kids (25 in the age group 0 to <6 years and 26 in the age group 6 to 12 
years), mainly of white race and with a median age of 4.0 (younger age group) and 9.0 (older age 
group) actually participated in the main study of Part A and completed the 6 month treatment period. 
The mean annualized number of total bleeds that occurred within 48 h of the previous prophylaxis 
injection (primary efficacy end-point) was 2.0±2.9 (95% CI) and the median number was 0. The mean 
number of total bleeds per year was 3.8 ± 5.0 (median 1.90 bleeds/year with an interquartile range 
from 0.0 to 6.0). Generally, within the clinical development programme higher annualised bleed rates 
were seen in children than in adults. 
The response to treatment was assessed as “good” or “excellent” in 90.1% of the bleedings. The 
bleeding rates are in line with what can be expected with successful prophylaxis. The mean recovery 
was 1.6 in PTPs younger than 6 years and 1.8 between 6 and 12 years of age without differences 
between base-line and final values. It is well known that recovery is lower in children than adults. 
 Leopold Kids Part B (treatment of PUPs) is ongoing.  
Thirteen major surgeries were performed in 11 patients. Twelve major surgeries for which BAY 81-
8973 was used for hemostatic control were performed during Leopold I and 1 during Leopold II. The 
hemostasis was assessed as excellent (53.5%) or good (46.5%) in all cases.  
The post authorisation efficacy study was agreed with reference to the following situation in the 
Commission delegated act: (c) uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal product in 
certain sub-populations that could not be resolved prior to marketing authorisation and require further 
clinical evidence; as  additional information in previously untreated patients is crucial in the context of 
treatment in haemophilia A.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The haemostatic effect of BAY 81-8973 in severe haemophilia has been demonstrated and the recovery 
of fVIII was satisfactory, in line with what can be expected for a fVIII product. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The applicant will submit the results from the Post authorisation efficacy study Leopold Kids Part B with 
the objective to investigate the safety and efficacy of Kovaltry in previously untreated patients and 
Leopold Kids extension aiming to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with 
Kovaltry. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
 The clinical safety of BAY 81-8973 was assessed in 204 patients with severe haemophilia A in three 
studies with 51 patients under the age of 12 years. There have been no reports of virus transmission, 
hypersensitivity, or inhibitor development related to BAY 81-8973. 
Patient exposure 
Clinical safety data are collected from Leopold I, Leopold II and Leopold Kids described under clinical 
efficacy. 
In Leopold I + II Safety Pool: For 142 patients who received treatment and were included in the pool, 
a total of 25,890 EDs were achieved.  The median number of days a patient remained in the study was 
371.5 days (92.4-749.4 days) during which a median number of 159 EDs was reached per patient (8-
355 EDs).   
The majority of patients (125 patients, 88%) had accumulated at least 100 EDs by the end of the 
studies. An additional 11 patients had between 50 and 100 EDs. A total of 26,317 injections of 
BAY 81-8973 were administered during the studies for either on-demand or prophylaxis treatment, 
with a mean number of injections per patient of 185.33 ± 92.21 (range 8-424). On a by-patient basis, 
the mean dose was 4283.69 ± 1647.95 IU/kg/year (range: 597.4-8121.3).   
In Leopold Kids Part A: 51 children in the study accumulated a total of 3,618 EDs. The median number 
of days in the study was 182 days (113-216 days) during which the patients accumulated a median of 
73 EDs (37-103 EDs) of BAY 81-8973. Only 1 patient had less than 50 EDs. A total of 3,669 injections 
of BAY 81-8973 were administered during the 6-month study period. On a by-patient basis, the mean 
dose was 5081.1 ± 1873.5 IU/kg/year (range: 2217 to 9474).   
 Leopold Kids Part B (treatment of PUPs) is ongoing. 
Adverse events 
Safety parameters for the safety assessment of BAY 81-8973 included exposure, TEAEs, Safety 
laboratory tests, Immunogenicity and Vital signs. 
The study population in the assessment of safety includes those who received at least one dose of 
study medication during Leopold I Part B and extension or Leopold II. AEs were assessed in terms of 
their seriousness, severity, and relationship to the study drug. Bleeding events were not to be 
considered as AEs in the studies, except if the bleed required hospitalisation or met the criteria for 
being serious. Inhibitor formation to FVIII was to be considered as an important medical event and, 
thus, was to be reported as an SAE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1

In Leopold I + II Safety Pool TEAEs, occurred in 98 (69%) of 142 patients. The incidence of TEAEs was 
higher in the Leopold I Safety Pool (87.1%) compared to the Leopold II Safety Pool (55.0%), because 
patients in the Leopold I Safety Pool including the 1-year extension were treated approximately twice 
as long as in the Leopold II study (median number of days in the study: 728.59 days versus 365.50 
days, respectively). 
In the majority of all patients with TEAEs, the maximum intensity of any TEAE was mild or moderate. 
Drug-related TEAEs were infrequent and occurred in <10% of the patients in total. There were 14 
patients with treatment-emergent SAEs during the Leopold I and II studies. One SAE, a myocardial 
infarction in the Leopold I study, was rated as drug-related. This was also the only AE which led to 
discontinuation from the study. All SAEs had improved or resolved by the end of the study, and no 
patient died. 
In Leopold Kids Part A children, TEAEs occurred in 35 patients (68.6%). In the majority of patients, the 
maximum intensity of an AE was mild or moderate. Only 1 patient had a drug-related AE (mild 
pruritus). There were 5 patients with SAEs which all resolved, and no patient died. One of the patients 
was withdrawn from the treatment due a central venous catheter infection. 
Overall, no death occurred, no case of anaphylactic reaction, viral transmission or inhibitor 
development was reported.

Leopold I + II Safety Pool: A total of 14 patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent SAE. 
Except for chest pain (2 patients) and suicidal ideation (twice in the same patient), all SAEs were 
single occurrences. All patients had recovered or were improving from their SAEs. 
One SAE in the Leopold I Extension study was rated as drug-related. A 62-year-old patient (SID 
390010018) with several risk factors for cardiovascular events (such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, 
overweight and [previous] heavy smoking), experienced an acute myocardial infarction approximately 
one month after entering the extension period and 13 months after starting treatment with BAY 81-
8973 for prophylaxis. The SAE occurred 4 hours after the BAY 81-8973 injection (2000 IU), and a 
causal relationship to the treatment with BAY 81-8973 could not be excluded. Therefore, the 
investigator decided to permanently discontinue the study treatment in this patient. After 2 weeks and 
a surgical intervention with stent implantation, the patient recovered. 
Leopold Kids Part A: None of the SAEs was rated as drug-related. There were 7 treatment-emergent 
SAEs in 5 patients. All of them were regarded as unrelated to BAY 81-8973, and all patients recovered. 
The only significant TEAE was a case of moderate device-related infection (reported term: central 
venous catheter infection) in a 4-year old boy (SID 220020002) six months after start of treatment 
with BAY 81-8973. The study medication was discontinued because of this AE and concomitant 
treatment was given. The AE resolved within 3 days and it was not rated as drug-related.  
No other significant AEs occurred during the studies. 
No case of anaphylactic reaction was reported. 
Adverse Events during Major Surgical Procedures 
Leopold I: 12 major surgeries for which BAY 81-8973 was used for haemostatic control were 
performed in 10 patients during the Leopold I study. Five of these patients participated only in Part C 
of the Leopold I study, i.e., they received BAY 81-8973 only during the surgery including up to 3 weeks 
follow-up treatment for haemostatic control. At least one TEAE was recorded for these patients 
undergoing 7 major surgical procedures in the surgery arm. Except for diarrhoea and pyrexia (2 
patients each) all other events were single occurrences (anaemia, anuria, ascites, contact dermatitis, 
device related infection, dyspepsia, nausea, pleural effusion, pulmonary artery dilatation, thymus 
disorder) and were mainly related to the underlying diseases of the surgical procedure. None of the 
TEAEs was rated as drug-related or led to discontinuation of treatment with BAY 81-8973. Post-surgery 
ascites in a patient with hepatic cirrhosis was the only treatment-emergent SAE in Part C. 
Leopold II 
The TEAEs of the one patient with major surgery in Leopold II are included in the safety pool. 
Adverse Events during the Pharmacokinetic Study Part 
28 patients received a single dose of BAY 81-8973 and Kogenate FS in Part A (PK part) of the Leopold I 
study. 7 of these patients (25%) experienced at least one TEAE during either treatment period with 
BAY 81-8973 or Kogenate FS. None of the TEAEs was serious or led to discontinuation from the study. 
All TEAEs were of mild intensity. Two non-treatment-emergent SAEs in a 37-year-old patient were 
reported in the interval between the 1st and 2nd PK session in Part A (haematuria and pneumonia). No 
relevant differences with regard to TEAEs were detectable between the 2 periods. Three non-serious 
TEAEs which occurred in 2 patients were rated as drug-related (one patient experienced mild 
paraesthesia during the Kogenate FS period, and mild monocytosis during the BAY 81-8973 period; 
another patient was diagnosed with mild monocytosis during the Kogenate FS period).

Laboratory findings 
Safety laboratory evaluations included clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation parameters, and 
urinalysis. Despite several treatment-emergent abnormalities in safety laboratory parameters, none 
was rated as drug-related. Abnormal laboratory values were related to the underlying concomitant 
diseases. Mean and median changes in the different laboratory values did not indicate any specific 
trends during treatment. Shifts from low/normal values at Baseline to values above the upper limit of 
normal were most frequently seen for (non-fasting) glucose (51.2%), SGPT/ALT (27.9%), SGOT/AST 
(14.6%) and GGT (11.5%). None of these shifts was rated as clinically relevant. 
The majority of blood glucose estimates above the reference range used in the clinical studies were not 
clinically significant. Further, whilst the number of these estimates during the treatment period was 
higher than during the pre-baseline and baseline stages, they were spread out during the entire dosing 
period and temporally, showed little relation to start of treatment or length of time on treatment. 
Lastly, the time period of blood glucose monitoring was much longer for the treatment period than for 
the pre-treatment period. It was confirmed that the high incidence of post-baseline liver function test 
abnormalities were due to the high rates of concomitant hepatitis infections in study subjects. 
Vital signs 
Further safety evaluations in the clinical studies included measurements of systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature, body weight, height, and BMI. No relevant 
changes were detectable for any of these parameters in the course of the studies. In addition, the 
mean values of vital signs were essentially the same at pre- and post-injection for all visits. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancies 
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, the use of BAY 81-8973 in women was not 
investigated in any clinical trial. Pregnancy occurring in a patient’s partner during their participation in 
these studies was not systematically reported. The few pregnancies which were reported in a patient’s 
partner did not indicate any new safety concerns. (See RMP) 
No patient was above 61 years of age. 
Immunological events 
Factor VIII inhibitor development (anti-FVIII antibodies)   
No FVIII inhibitors were detected in previously treated patients. The study Leopold Kids Part B in 
previously untreated children is ongoing.  
Anti-HSP70 and Anti-BHK/HCP Antibodies 
Antibody formation to HSP70 and BHK/HCP was determined because these proteins are expressed by 
the cell line. No specific pattern for changes regarding anti-HSP70 or anti-BHK/HCP antibodies was 
observed, and none of the patients showed any clinical symptoms associated with increased anti-
HSP70 or anti-BHK/HCP antibody levels. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There are no known metabolising pathways and no known CYP involvement. No PK interaction is 
expected with other drugs that are metabolised by CYP enzymes. Therefore no interaction studies have 
been conducted with CYP-metabolised drugs potentially administered concomitantly.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/40124/2016 rev. 1 
Page 62/72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the clinical studies several medications were used concomitantly. The overall safety data from the 
studies reflect the safety and tolerability information in the patient population who may have used one 
or more concomitant drugs. Caution should be taken with drugs that increase the bleeding tendency 
such as aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are not recommended for haemophilia 
patients. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
According to the Appendix of the Summary of clinical safety, there was one patient discontinuing in the 
Leopold I Extension study, and one patient in the Leopold Kids study (device-related infection). 
Post marketing experience

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 142 patients were included in the Leopold I + II Safety Pool and 51 children in Leopold Kids 
Part A. There is a difference in baseline characteristics between younger patients and adults and 
between non-Asian and Asian groups, possibly reflecting an improvement in care for these patients 
over time, and a difference in standard of care in different geographical/economic zones. For adults 
and children combined, most TEAEs were reported for the MedDRA primary SOC Infections and 
infestations. No fatal cases or anaphylactic reactions were reported in the studies, however 
seven patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions. One patient suffering a myocardial infarction 
gives awareness to the fact that haemophilic patients, when treated, will reach a normal life-span, and 
will be subject to cardiovascular risk factors.  
The immunogenicity of Kovaltry was evaluated in previously treated patients. During clinical trials with 
Kovaltry in approximately 200 paediatric and adult patients diagnosed with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII < 1%) with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates ≥ 50 ED, no case of inhibitor 
occurred. 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually immunoglobulins G (IgG) 
directed against the FVIII pro-coagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of 
plasma. This neutralising antibody development can result in significantly increased morbidity and 
mortality because of interference with efficacy of the replacement product. The risk of inhibitor 
development is highest during the first 20 EDs in patients who have not received any FVIII treatment 
and decreases to a low risk after 150 EDs. 
Therefore, patients were carefully monitored for the development of inhibitory antibodies to FVIII (the 
primary safety variable) by clinical observations and based upon the results of the Nijmegen-modified 
Bethesda assay, measured as BU. In the Leopold I, Leopold II and Leopold Kids Part A studies, no 
patient had a positive FVIII inhibitor level, i.e., developed inhibitory antibody levels of ≥0.6 BU. All 
subjects were pre-treated patients and therefore, at a low risk for inhibitor formation. It should be 
noted that the Leopold Kids Part A study included patients with less than 150 previous EDs (> 50 EDs 
for inclusion) which is a range of higher risk than >150 previous ED.  No previously treated patient had 
a positive FVIII inhibitor level, i.e., developed inhibitory antibody levels of ≥0.6 BU.  Leopold Kids 
study Part B (treatment in PUPs) is ongoing. 
Most patients in the Leopold I and II Safety Pool had detectable anti-HSP70 levels, however increases 
of anti-HSP70 levels during the study were modest and may have been related to inflammatory 
reactions in patients with concomitant infectious diseases. None of the patient developed BHK/HCP 
Assessment report

antibodies throughout the clinical trial programm. No specific pattern for changes regarding anti-HSP70 
antibodies was observed, and none of the patients showed any clinical symptoms associated with 
increased anti-HSP70 antibody levels.The AE profile in the development programme is in line with the 
profile of other licenced recombinant FVIII products Since BAY 81-8973 is not metabolised by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP), it is not expected that hepatic impairment will affect the PK of BAY 81-8973. 
Therefore, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment and it is included as missing 
information in the RMP, however such data may come from registries (see RMP).  
No new safety concerns, with respect to already authorised FVIII products, were identified. 
Even though no inhibitors were detected, as this is recognised as an important aspect across the class, 
it was decided that statements on the inhibitor development are reflected in the SmPC in Sections 4.4, 
as warnings. The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is addressed as relevant warnings and contra-
indications in the SmPC.  In addition, a warning has been included to make patients and physicians 
aware, that Haemophilic patients with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases may be at the same risk 
to develop cardiovascular events as non-haemophilic patients when clotting has been normalised by 
treatment with FVIII. Elevation of FVIII levels following administration, in particular in those with 
existing cardiovascular risk factors, might cause a patient to have the same risk for vessel closure or 
myocardial infarction as for the non-haemophilic population. Consequently, the patients should be 
evaluated for cardiac risk factors. 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.  
In completed clinical studies with 71 paediatric previously treated patients, the frequency, type and 
severity of adverse reactions in children were found to be similar to those in adults. 
Additional safety data will be provided in the post authorisation phase through the agreed post 
authorisation study 13400: Leopold Kids Part B with the objective to investigate safety and efficacy of 
Kovaltry in previously untreated patients. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on Clinical Safety 
The overall safety and AE profile in the development programme is in line with the profile of other 
licenced recombinant FVIII products. Further studies and registry data (see pharmacovigilance plan 
and RMP) will monitor safety issues of special interest as requested by CHMP. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The applicant will submit the results from the Post authorisation efficacy study Leopold Kids Part B with 
the objective to investigate the safety and efficacy of Kovaltry in previously untreated patients and 
Leopold Kids extension aiming to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with 
Kovaltry.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Overall the pharmacokinetics of FVIII was in general comparable between Kovaltry and Kogenate 
independently of bioanalytical assay used. 
In the Leopold I study reduction in bleed rates to 1-2 per year during the study from approximately 6 
per year in the pre-study period in adults and adolescents previously treated prophylactically with 
FVIII, was seen. Large differences in bleed rates between patients dosed prophylactically and those 
treated on demand (Leopold II) were also shown, as expected. This benefit was seen in the evaluated 
subgroups including, those receiving lower Kovaltry doses, those with less frequent dosing, children 
and Asian subjects. Also, the different bleed types (spontaneous, traumatic, joint, mucosal) all 
remained effectively reduced in frequency compared to pre-study levels and in episodic treatment 
settings. In both Leopold I and II studies effectiveness in treating bleeds was also shown, with a clear 
majority of subjects rating the performance of Kovaltry in treating bleeds as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’. In 
the surgical setting Kovaltry was also shown to be effective with regard to achieving and maintaining 
haemostatic control, as most surgeons rated haemostatic control as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ during 
particular surgeries.  
The median annualized number of “total bleeds” (spontaneous and trauma bleeds, untreated bleeds 
and bleeds with missing reason) (primary efficacy variable) was 1.0 (Q1; Q3, 0.0;5,1) with a large 
inter-individual variability. The bleeding rates are in line with what can be expected during successful 
prophylaxis in severe haemophilia. The response was assessed as “good” or “excellent” in 80.9% of 
the cases. In 7 of the 235 bleed 24 (3.0%), the response was assessed as “poor”, although 2 of these 
bleeds were successfully treated with 2 injections, 4 with 3 injections, and 1 with 4 injections. These 
results are in line with what is usually seen for effective fVIII products. The bleeding characteristics 
appear typical for severe Haemophilia with 80% being joint bleeds. Recovery values are within the 
expected range for fVIII products (approximately 2 kg/dL). 
A total of 1497 bleeds were reported in the ITT population during the supportive study Leopold II 
(1204 in the 21 subjects in the on-demand group and 293 in the 59 subjects in the prophylaxis group). 
The median annualized bleeding rates derived from these data were 60 bleeds/year and 2 bleeds/year, 
respectively, reflecting a highly significant difference (p<0.0001). with similar fVIII recovery results as 
in Leopold I of 2.0 kg/dL).  
In a total of 51 PTPs (25 in the age group 0 to <6 years and 26 in the age group 6 to 12 years), the 
mean annualized number of total bleeds that occurred within 48 h of the previous prophylaxis injection 
(primary efficacy end-point) was 2.0±2.9 (95% CI) and the median number was 0. The response to 
treatment was assessed as “good” or “excellent” in 90.1% of the bleedings. The bleeding rates are in 
line with what can be expected with successful prophylaxis. The mean recovery was 1.63 in PTPs

younger than 6 years and 1.76 between 6 and 12 years of age without differences between base-line 
and final values.  
Thirteen major surgeries were performed in 11 patients. Twelve major surgeries for which BAY 81-
8973 was used for haemostatic control were performed during Leopold I and 1 during Leopold II. The 
haemostasis was assessed as excellent (53.5%) or good (46.5%) in all cases. No subjects required any 
blood transfusions. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The experience from treatment of previously untreated patients is still very limited. This has been 
adequately addressed in the PI in line with the core SPC. Study Part B of the study in children 
evaluation safety and efficacy in previously untreated patients (PUPs) and the extension periods of 
both Part A and Part B are ongoing.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The AE profile in the development programme is in line with the profile of other licenced recombinant 
FVIII products. No new safety concerns, with respect to already authorised FVIII products, were 
identified. The safety profile for the paediatric population did not raise any additional safety concerns 
compared to adolescents and adults included in the studies. However, as a central venous access 
device is normally required for treating children, complications related to this device (e.g. infections) 
must be considered. 
No previously treated patient in the pivotal trials had a positive FVIII inhibitor level, i.e., developed 
inhibitory antibody levels of ≥0.6 BU. Leopold kids study part B (treatment in PUPs) is ongoing.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the ongoing Part B study including PUPs, there were very few patients who completed the study and 
entered in the extension phase, therefore no conclusion can as yet be drawn on this population.  
In the trials overall, there were no patients above the age of 61, so there is no data on the 
effect/safety in the elderly. Also, the age-related risk of cardiovascular events is an uncertain factor. As 
for ethnical groups the number of patients is too low to make any certain conclusions on any 
differences in the safety pattern.   
No specific study of hepatic impairment was made; however, more than 50% of than patients in the 
Leopold I + II Safety Pool had a history of hepatitis C. However, there was no clear evidence of a 
higher risk for these patients. Data from registries will provide information to address these 
uncertainties (See RMP). 
The applicant will submit the results from the study Leopold Kids Part B and Extension with the 
objective to investigate the safety and efficacy of Kovaltry in previously untreated patients and Leopold 
Kids extension aiming to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with Kovaltry.  
Information from the EUHASS and Pednet registries will provide insight in cases with AEs of special 
interest such as development of FVIII inhibitors Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Cardiovascular 
risk/ thrombogenic events; risk in patients with severe hepatic impairment; Risk in previously 
untreated patients;  Risk in elderly patients > 65 years of age); development of FVIII inhibitors / Risk 
in previously untreated patients. Findings from both registries will be regularly reported in the ongoing 
PSURs (See RMP).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
BAY 81-8973 has been demonstrated to be effective in prophylactic treatment of severe haemophilia A, 
in treatment of bleedings and for perioperative management of major surgery. Such effects are since 
long known to be of major importance for the quality of life, risk for disability and survival in severe 
haemophilia. The proposed potency labelling is in line with the Eur. Pharmacopeia requirements and 
brings Kovaltry/Kovaltry in line with other rFVIII products on the European market; which is 
considered to be a valuable advantage as compared to the predecessor Kogenate FS. The Applicant 
has demonstrated that BAY 81-8973 adjusts FVIII plasma levels in a predictable way and the PK 
characteristics are essentially in line with what would be expected for a non-modified fVIII product.  
The haemostatic effect of BAY 81-8973 in severe haemophilia is in line with what can be expected for a 
fVIII product. The recovery of fVIII (the increase in plasma levels of FVIII achieved with a certain 
weight based dose of BAY 81-8973) was considered satisfactory for the adult and adolescent 
population. Prophylactic treatment was demonstrated to be successful as well as treatment for 
bleedings. 
The safety of the product has been sufficiently well characterised for a recommendation for approval. A 
post-marketing programme consisting of studies satisfying the CHMP guideline requirements is planned 
(collection of further efficacy, safety, immunogenicity data in in PTPs and PUPs.)  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, efficacy in prophylaxis and treatment of bleedings in patients with severe haemophilia A has 
been established by the provided clinical data as per the requirements of relevant Guidelines. Safety-
profile of Kovaltry is in line with what is expected. The benefits of recombinant factor VIII outweigh the 
risks. 
The benefit-risk balance in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency) is positive. Kovaltry can be used for all age groups. 
The post authorisation efficacy study was agreed with reference to the following situation in the 
Commission delegated act: (c) uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal product in 
certain sub-populations that could not be resolved prior to marketing authorisation and require further 
clinical evidence; as additional information in previously untreated patients is crucial in the context of 
treatment in haemophilia A. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of Kovaltry in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A covering treatment of 
bleeding episodes, prophylaxis of bleeds and prophylaxis in surgical procedures is adequately 
supported by submitted clinical data according to the currently valid Clinical Guideline. Furthermore, 
the documented safety profile is within the expected range for factor VIII products. Studies detailed in 
the pharmacovigilance plan are expected to update the knowledge on issues of special interest in this 
class (development of inhibitors, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic or allergic reactions, safety in 
previously untreated patients and safety in elderly patients). Additional data in previously untreated 
patients will be provided through the ongoing post authorisation studies.

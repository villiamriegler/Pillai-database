1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Submission of Article 46 for Apexxnar, a 20-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine 
(20vPnC; Compound Number: PF-06482077; EU/1/21/1612/001-006; EMEA/H/C/005451). The MAH 
(Pfizer Europe MA EEIG) submits results of study B7471016: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Third-Party Unblind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal 
Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Japanese Infants, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 
1901/2006, as amended. A total of 668 participants were enrolled at 38 centers in Japan. 
The purpose of the B7471016 study was to provide key safety and comparative immunogenicity data 
between the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) and the 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) in Japanese infants to help support licensure for paediatric use in Japan. 
Participants aged 2 to 6 months were randomised to receive 4 doses of 20vPnC (by subcutaneous or 
intramuscular injection), or 13vPnC (by subcutaneous injection as a control). The targeted age of the 
population for this study, infants ≥2 to ≤6 months of age, has been selected as the routinely 
recommended vaccination schedule for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and other vaccines in infants 
starts at approximately 2 months of age.

As the B7471016 study is not part of the clinical development program to support the paediatric 
indication for 20vPnC in Europe, no line-listing is included with the present EU submission under Article 
46. The opinion of the MAH is that no update to the EU Product Information for Apexxnar is required 
based on the results of B7471016, as the study is specific to Japanese infants and the MAH does not 
plan to apply for inclusion of the subcutaneous route of administration. 
Background 
Study B7471016 entitled “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Third-Party Unblind Trial to Evaluate 
the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Japanese 
Infants” is being submitted as a stand-alone PAM (P46 study) for 20vPnC. 20vPnC was approved in the 
EU on 14 February 2022 for active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years of age and older. 
Streptococcus pneumoniae are gram-positive encapsulated cocci that are a leading cause of 
bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and AOM and continue to be a major global public health 
concern. Children <5 years and adults ≥65 years of age are at particularly increased risk for serious 
pneumococcal disease. It has been estimated that in 2015, several years following introduction of 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines into the national infant immunization programs of more than 100 
countries, the global disease burden had declined. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae still accounted 
for 2.6 million cases of severe pneumococcal disease, 332,000 deaths in children <5 years of age, and 
11% of deaths in children between the ages of 1 and 5 years. 
In Japan, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (13vPnC) have been administered to infants by subcutaneous (SC) injection on a 4-dose 
vaccination schedule (3 doses for infant series and 1 dose for toddler dose).  
The composition of 20vPnC is based on the licensed 13vPnC formulation. 20vPnC uses the same 
platform and contains the same excipients as 13vPnC but contains an additional 7 polysaccharide 
conjugates targeting serotypes responsible for a substantial burden of remaining pneumococcal 
disease. 20vPnC is a sterile liquid suspension for intramuscular administration of capsular 
polysaccharide antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 
11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F each individually conjugated to the nontoxic 
variant of diphtheria toxin CRM197, as carrier protein. 
The purpose of this study was to provide key safety and comparative immunogenicity data in Japanese 
infants. The targeted age of the population for this study, infants ≥2 to ≤6 months of age, has been 
selected as the routinely recommended vaccination schedule for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and 
other vaccines in infants starts at approximately 2 months of age. The participants were administered 
either 20vPnC (SC or IM injection) or 13vPnC SC by the same injection route for all 4 doses.  
Intramuscular (IM) injection was included for clinical development of 20vPnC for infants in Japan as an 
alternative to SC injection because both injection routes are under development in other pediatric 
vaccines in Japan and licensure of an IM route could provide flexibility of administration by healthcare 
practitioners. 
2.  Methods 
Study Design: 
Study B7471016, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, third party unblind study was 
conducted at 38 investigator sites in Japan. The purpose of this study was to describe safety and 
conduct the pivotal immunogenicity comparison of 20vPnC administered by SC injection to the licensed 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 6/41 
 
 
 
 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 13vPnC, administered by the currently indicated SC injection in 
infants to support licensure in Japan for the pediatric population. Data was generated from 20vPnC 
administered by IM injection, with the 20vPnC administered by SC as a control. A study design 
overview is provided in Figure 1. Study objectives, estimands, and endpoints are provided in Table 1. 
This study planned to enroll 666 infants between 2 through 6 months of age at the time of consent by 
their parent(s)/legal guardian(s). This study population has been selected as this is the historical 
population studied for licensure of 13vPnC in infants. Participants were randomized equally to one of 
the following vaccine groups: (1) 20vPnC SC group, (2) 13vPnC SC group (control vaccine), or (3) 
20vPnC IM group. Participants received the same vaccine (20vPnC or 13vPnC) by the same injection 
method (SC or IM injection) for all 4 doses at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5 (Figure 1). This is consistent with 
the current vaccination schedule recommended by the Japan Pediatric Society for infants in Japan. 
Doses 1 to 3 were preferred to be administered at 2, 3, and 4 months of age consistent with the 
vaccination schedule recommended by the Japan Pediatric Society. In addition, Dose 3 was to be 
completed by 12 months of age and Dose 4 was to be administered ≥60 days after Dose 3. Blood was 
collected 1 month after Dose 3 (Visit 4), immediately prior to Dose 4 (Visit 5), and 1 month after Dose 
4 (Visit 6) to assess immunogenicity. All vaccine groups were blinded to all members of the site 
involved in the study except unblinded site staff who administered 20vPnC or 13vPnC.  
Local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site), systemic events (fever, decreased 
appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability), and use of antipyretic/pain medication were 
prompted for and collected by the participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) in an e-diary, via device or 
application, from Day 1 through Day 7 after each vaccination (where Day 1 is the day of vaccination). 
Adverse events (AEs) were collected from the time the participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
provided informed consent through 1 month after Dose 3 (Visit 4) and from Dose 4 (Visit 5) through 1 
month after Dose 4 (Visit 6). SAEs and NDCMCs were collected from informed consent through 1 
month after Dose 4 (Visit 6).

Study Population: 
Participants included healthy Japanese male or female infants ≥2 months to ≤6 months (defined as the 
first day the participant is 2 months of age to the last day the participant is 6 months of age) at the 
time of consent.  
Participants were excluded from the study if they had a history of severe adverse reaction associated 
with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the 
investigational product, the specified concomitant vaccines, or any diphtheria toxoid-containing 
vaccine. Additional exclusion criteria included any contraindication to vaccination with pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine or the specified concomitant vaccines, significant neurological disorder or history of 
seizure, major known congenital malformation or serious chronic disorders, history of microbiologically 
proven invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, known or suspected immunodeficiency 
or other conditions associated with immunosuppression, congenital, functional, or surgical asplenia, 
and other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that might 
increase the risk associated with study participation. Participants were excluded from the study if they 
had a history of previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine, prior 
receipt of Haemophilus influenzae type b, Hepatitis B (Hep B), rotavirus, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular

or receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins (including Hep B immunoglobulin and 
monoclonal antibodies) since birth or planned receipt through the last planned blood sample collection 
in the study (through Visit 6).  
Statistics 
The primary safety objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary statistics for local reactions, 
systemic events and AEs (including SAEs) and NDCMCs. AEs were categorized according to the 
MedDRA. The primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives for the 20vPnC SC were evaluated by 
hypothesis test for noninferiority of 20vPnC SC to 13vPnC SC based on serotype-specific IgG results 1 
month after Dose 3. The primary immunogenicity objective for 20vPnC IM was descriptive comparison 
of IgG concentrations 1 month after Dose 3 between 20vPnC IM and 20vPnC SC. Other secondary and 
exploratory immunogenicity objectives were evaluated by descriptive summary statistics.

4.  Scientific Discussion – Immunogenicity 
Design and conduct of clinical study 
The MAH (Pfizer Europe MA EEIG) submitted results of study B7471016: A Phase 3, Randomized, 
Double-Blind, Third-Party Unblind Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of a 20-valent 
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Japanese Infants. The scope of this study was to provide 
safety and comparative immunogenicity data between 20vPnC and 13vPnC in Japanese infants to help 
support licensure for paediatric use in Japan. 
For this study, infants between 2 through 6 months of age at the time of consent by their 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were included. This study population is generally acceptable for the 
purpose of the study. The selection of 13vPnC as an active comparator is considered appropriate, as 
13vPnC is currently an approved treatment option for this age group. The same formulation and dose 
was administered to infants as currently licensed for adults. Demographic and baseline characteristics 
of sex, race, ethnicity, and age were balanced across the vaccine groups. Across the vaccine groups, 
all participants were Asian (Japanese), and 49.4% were males. 
According to the MAH, this study was conducted in compliance with GCP guidelines and, where 
applicable, local country regulations. No substantial changes to the study protocol were made.

No critical issues were identified concerning the overall study design or study conduct. 
For 20vPnC, Pfizer’s multiplex Luminex-based immunoassay (dLIA) was used for measuring 
serotype-specific IgG concentrations in serum. Efficacy data and additional analyses 
20vPnC SC vs. 13vPnC SC 
Primary immunogenicity objectives 
The primary immunogenicity objectives were to demonstrate that: 
• 
the percentage of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations 
for the 13 serotypes in the 20vPnC SC group are noninferior [i.e. the lower bound of the 2-
sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC SC group – 13vPnC SC group) in percentages >–
10%] to the percentage of the corresponding serotypes in the 13vPnC SC group at 1 month 
after Dose 3.  
AND 
• 
the percentage of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations 
for the 7 additional serotypes in the 20vPnC SC group are noninferior [i.e. the lower bound of 
the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference (20vPnC SC group – 13vPnC SC group) in percentages 
>–10%] to the lowest percentage among the 13 serotypes in the 13vPnC SC group at 1 month 
after Dose 3. 
Although only percentage of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations was 
considered a primary objective in this study, for the EU requirements both the percentage of 
participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations AND serotype-specific IgG GMC are 
considered important i.e. the aim should be to show noninferiority for both of these parameters. 
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs were assessed as secondary endpoints, however with hypothesis testing 
and predefined noninferiority margins. This is described later in the report under ‘Secondary 
objectives’.  
The primary analysis was performed one month after the primary series (post-Dose 3). The chosen 
timepoint is in accordance with that for which the current pre-defined IgG concentration of 0.35 μg/mL 
according to the WHO ELISA has been established and reflects the immune response elicited within the 
first year of life when children are at the highest risk of IPD and is therefore appropriate. 
It is noteworthy that, although the non-inferiority margin of -0.1 for the difference in response rate 
was previously used in clinical studies of approved pneumococcal vaccines, it has not been justified 
from a clinical perspective, and therefore meeting or not meeting these NI criteria is of unknown 
clinical relevance.  
The NI comparison of immune responses elicited by the 7 additional serotypes to the lowest immune 
response induced in the 13vPnC SC group is of limited value. Furthermore, as no correlate of 
protection is established for the 7 additional serotypes, using the cut-off of 0.35 µg/ml is also of limited 
value. 
The NI criteria were met for 11/13 shared serotypes. Of the 13 shared serotypes, serotypes 6A 
and 6B missed the NI criterion. The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percentage 
difference were -13% and -14% for serotypes 6A and 6B, respectively, thereby exceeding the 
predefined NI margin of -10%. Of note, serotypes 5 and 23F narrowly succeeded in meeting the NI 
margin, as their lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI were -9.6 and -9.5, respectively. An overall 
numerically lower immune response was observed for almost all shared serotypes, despite the majority

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 31/41 
 
 
 
 
of them meeting the pre-defined NI criterion. Exceptions were serotypes 19A and 19F, for which the 
difference in percentages was zero.  
The non-inferiority criteria were met for 5/7 additional serotypes. Of the 7 additional serotypes, 
serotypes 10A and 12F missed the statistical NI criterion (lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CI 
were -40.7% and -25.7%, respectively). 
Secondary immunogenicity objectives 
The secondary objectives were to demonstrate that: 
• 
the serotype-specific IgG GMCs for the 13 serotypes in the 20vPnC SC group are noninferior 
[i.e. the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the IgG GMR of the 20vPnC SC group to the 
13vPnC SC group >0.5 (2-fold NI margin)] to the GMCs for the corresponding serotypes in the 
13vPnC SC group at 1 month after Dose 3.  
AND 
• 
the serotype-specific IgG GMCs for the 7 additional serotypes in the 20vPnC SC group are 
noninferior [i.e. the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the IgG GMR of the 20vPnC SC 
group to the 13vPnC SC group >0.5 (2-fold NI margin)] to the lowest IgG GMC among the 13 
serotypes induced by the 13vPnC SC group at 1 month after Dose 3. 
It is noteworthy that, although the non-inferiority margin of 0.5 for the GMC ratio was previously used 
in clinical studies of approved pneumococcal vaccines, it has not been justified from a clinical 
perspective, and therefore meeting or not meeting these NI criteria is of unknown clinical relevance.  
Of the 13 shared serotypes, the noninferiority criteria were met for 10/13 shared serotypes. 
Serotypes 5, 6A, and 6B missed the statistical NI criterion, as the lower bounds of the 2-sided 
95% CIs of IgG GMR were 0.49, 0.50 and 0.40, respectively. Also for the serotypes that met the NI 
margin, numerically lower IgG GMC values were observed compared to 13vPnC. For almost all shared 
serotypes the entire 95% CI was below 1, with the exception of serotype 14, for which the upper 
bound of the 95% CI barely crossed 1.  
Of the 7 additional serotypes, the non-inferiority criteria were met for 6/7 serotypes. Serotype 
10A missed the statistical NI criterion, as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was 0.48.  
Secondary immunogenicity objectives 
•  OPA GMTs at 1 month After Dose 3 
Regarding the functionally important opsonophagocytic activity (OPA), a clear increase was seen in the 
20vPnC SC group. Nonetheless, OPA GMTs for the 13 matched serotypes 1 month after Dose 3 were 
generally lower in the 20vPnC SC group compared to the 13vPnC SC group, including for the serotypes 
that missed NI in the primary and secondary comparison between 20vPnC SC and 13vPnC SC (38% 
worse response for serotypes 5 and 6B, 19% worse response for serotype 6A). Interestingly, OPA 
GMTs for additional 7 serotypes were of a higher order of magnitude (102 or 104) compared to the OPA 
GMTs for 13 shared serotypes (101 or 103). It is unclear whether this could be ascribed to different 
OPA assays, however this issue is not further pursued within the assessment of this study. 
Pre-dose 4 assessments

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

•  Geometric mean fold-rise (GMFRs) in serotype-specific IgG concentrations from 1 month after 
Dose 3 to before Dose 4 
Pneumococcal IgG GMCs decreased from 1 month after Dose 3 to before Dose 4 for all 13 matched 
serotypes, similarly in both vaccine groups. The IgG GMFRs for those serotypes ranged from 0.1 
(serotypes 3, 19A) to 0.8 (serotype 6B) in the 20vPnC SC group, and from 0.1 (serotypes 3, 19A and 
19F) to 0.7 (serotype 14) in the 13vPnC SC group.  
For the 7 additional serotypes, the pneumococcal IgG GMCs decreased for some and increased for 
other serotypes from 1 month after Dose 3 to before Dose 4.  The pneumococcal IgG GMFRs 1 month 
after Dose 3 to before Dose 4 ranged from 0.1 (serotype 11A) to 2.2 (serotype 10A) in the 20vPnC 
SC group. According to the MAH, the low observed mean GMFR for 11A may be due to the relatively 
high GMCs observed after Dose 3. As would be expected, there were no or minimal changes in 
antibody levels in the 13vPnC SC group. 
Post toddler dose (post Dose 4) assessments 
• 
The percentages of participants with predefined serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG 
concentrations at 1 month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC SC were higher compared to the percentage 
of participants who reached the pre-defined cut-offs at 1 month after Dose 3, for all serotypes 
except for serotype 3, where a slight decreased was observed (from 96.4% to 91.7%). For all 
other serotypes, the percentage of participants who reached the pre-defined cut-offs 
was >98%, including for serotypes that failed primary NI comparisons post-Dose 3 (serotypes 
6A, 6B, 10A and 12F). 
• 
Pneumococcal IgG GMCs for most of serotypes were higher in both vaccine groups 1 month 
after Dose 4 compared to 1 month after Dose 3. Only for serotype 3, IgG GMC decreased from 
post-Dose 3 to post-Dose 4, this finding was observed in both vaccine groups. Despite the 
overall increase, IgG GMCs were still lower in 20vPnC group compared to 13vPnC group. For 
the 3 serotypes (5, 6A and 6B) that missed primary NI comparison after Dose 3, IgG increased 
after Dose 4, notably for serotypes 6A and 6B.  
• 
The percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in pneumococcal IgG concentrations before 
Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 varied between serotypes. In the 20vPnC group, the 
seroconversion rate ranged from 52.5% (serotype 14) to 97.7% (serotype 6B) among the 
shared serotypes. Similar results were observed also in the 13vPnC group; the seroconversion 
rates varied between 48.2% (serotype 14) and 99.5% (serotype 6B). Seroconversion rate was 
greater than 90% in both groups for the majority of shared serotypes. For the additional 7 
serotypes, the seroconversion rates in the 20vPnC group ranged between 67.7% (serotypes 
10A and 15B) and 85.7% (serotype 8). This suggests that the seroconversion was generally 
lower for the additional serotypes compared to the matched serotypes. No substantial increase 
in the IgG GMCs for the 7 additional serotypes was seen in the PCV13 group, as expected. 
•  OPA GMTs after Dose 4 showed a boost 1 month after Dose 4 in both groups but for 13 
matched serotypes but the 20vPnC SC group was again generally lower compared to the 
13vPnC SC group. Thus, it can be assumed that while 20vPnC elicits functionally important 
antibody responses to the covered serotypes, responses to the 13 matched serotypes might be 
generally higher following vaccination with 13vPnC. 
20vPnC IM vs 20vPnC

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

A primary immunogenicity objective regarding the comparison between subcutaneous and 
intramuscular route of administration was to describe the immune responses to 20 serotypes induced 
by 20vPnC given by IM injection at 1 month after Dose 3. 
It should be noted that no comparison has been presented between 20vPnC IM and 13vPnC SC; only 
comparison 20vPnC IM vs 20vPnC SC is available. In addition, no success criteria were pre-defined. 
The percentages of participants with predefined serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG concentrations 1 
month after Dose 3 of 20vPnC IM for all 20 serotypes were generally slightly lower to those in the 
20vPnC SC group. The range of point estimates of the difference was -5.7% (serotype 1) to 4.8% 
(serotype 6A). This minimal trend was also seen in the additional comparison regarding the 
Pneumococcal IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 3. However, Pneumococcal IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 
4 of 20vPnC IM for all 20 serotypes were generally slightly higher to those in the 20vPnC SC group. 
Likewise, the percentages of participants with predefined serotype-specific pneumococcal IgG 
concentrations 1 month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC IM for all 20 serotypes were generally similar to those 
in the 20vPnC SC group. The observed percentages for all serotypes were ≥99.5% with the exception 
of serotypes 1, 3, 12F, and 14 (≥98.6%, ≥91.5%, ≥98.2%, and ≥99.1%, respectively). In addition, 
no substantial differences regarding immunogenicity were observed regarding the ≥4-fold rise in 
pneumococcal IgG concentrations or OPA titers after Dose 4 between the IM and SC routes. Thus, both 
routes of administration offer a comparable immunogenicity profile according to measured immune 
parameters.  
Conclusion on immunogenicity  
Both the percentage of participants with predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations AND 
serotype-specific IgG GMC are considered important for the EU requirements, i.e. the aim should be to 
show noninferiority for both of these parameters. Of the 13 shared serotypes, 10 serotypes showed 
noninferiority for both parameters, 1 serotype (serotype 5) failed one parameter and 2 serotypes (6A 
and 6B) failed both parameters. Even for those serotypes for which NI criterion was met, numerically 
lower immune response was observed, with respect to both the percentage of participants with 
predefined serotype-specific IgG concentrations and serotype-specific IgG GMC. Of the 7 additional 
serotypes, 5 serotypes showed noninferiority for both parameters, 1 serotype (serotype 12F) failed one 
parameter and 1 serotype (serotype 10A) failed both parameters.  
According to the study protocol, the primary and specific secondary pneumococcal immunogenicity 
objectives for noninferiority were to be met if the noninferiority of the immune response (percentage of 
participants with predefined IgG concentration and IgG GMCs respectively) induced by 20vPnC SC 
group compared to 13vPnC SC group at 1 month after Dose 3 is established for all 20 serotypes. 
Noninferiority was not met for all of the 20 serotypes and the study failed to meet the primary as well 
as the secondary objectives of noninferiority. Additional analyses such as OPA GMTs post Dose 3 offer 
limited reassurance, since OPA GMTs for the 13 matched serotypes 1 month after Dose 3 were 
generally lower in the 20vPnC SC group compared to the 13vPnC SC group, including for the serotypes 
that failed primary and/or secondary NI comparisons. Moreover, Antibody Response Curves for OPA 
GMTs as well as for IgG GMCs show consistently lower immune response with 20vPnC SC compared to 
13vPnC SC at all measurement timepoints (1 month after Dose 3, prior to Dose 4 and 1 month after 
Dose 4) for all shared serotypes.  
Analyses after Dose 4 indicated a substantial recall of primed immune responses for the covered 
serotypes of 13vPnC and 20vPnC, however even after the booster dose, immunogenicity data is still in 
higher after vaccination with 13vPnC.

With regard to the 7 additional serotypes, the NI comparison of immune responses elicited by to the 
lowest immune response induced in the 13vPnC SC group is of limited value. Furthermore, as no 
correlate of protection is established for the 7 additional serotypes, using the cut-off of 0.35 µg/ml is 
also of limited value. These additional serotypes seem to elicit much higher OPA titres compared to the 
shared serotypes, however, uncertainties pertaining to the different assays for different serotypes 
preclude firm conclusions. The percentages of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in pneumococcal IgG 
concentrations before Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 suggest that seroconversion was generally lower 
for the additional serotypes compared to the matched serotypes. No data on seroconversion after Dose 
3 could be found. 
In conclusion, immune response elicited by the 20vPnC SC is lower compared to that of 13vPnC SC for 
the shared 13 serotypes. A potential benefit of a broader coverage due to the additional 7 serotypes 
has not been unequivocally shown.  
No apparent differences were detected by route of administration (IM/SC) for 20vPnC after 4 doses 
although the primary comparison after dose 3 showed numerically higher responses after SC 
vaccination. The clinical relevance of the results remain unclear since the measured antibody titers are 
no established correlates of protection.  
Overall, no questions are raised regarding immunogenicity results. The data of study B7471016 do not 
trigger a variation application for the EU PI since only IM administration of 20vPnC is relevant in the EU 
and the comparison with the reference product was done after SC vaccination. The MAH does not plan 
to apply for inclusion of subcutaneous route of administration in the EU PI. A dedicated development 
programme exists for the extension of indication to children in the EU.  
5.  Safety Results  
A total of 667 participants were included in the safety population of which 659 (98.7%) completed the 
Dose 3 follow-up visit, and 649 (97.2%) completed all visits per protocol. The number of adverse 
events reported up to 1 month after Dose 4 is shown in Table 17.

The percentages of participants with any related AEs from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 and from 
Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 were generally low and similar across the 20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, and 
20vPnC IM groups (Table 18 and Table 19, respectively).

The percentages of participants with local reactions within 7 days after vaccination after Doses 1 
through 4 were generally similar across the 20vPnC SC group (82.7%, 80.3%, 82.4%, and 90.4%) and 
13vPnC SC group (81.7%, 90.1%, 87.8%, and 88.2%), respectively. Injection site redness was the 
most commonly reported local reaction. Most local reactions reported were mild or moderate. The 
median day of onset for local reactions was between Day 1 and Day 2. The median duration of local 
reactions was between 1 and 5 days.  
The percentages of participants with any systemic event within 7 days after vaccination after Doses 1 
through 4 were generally similar across the 20vPnC SC group (56.9%, 57.8%, 47.7%, and 59.2%), 
the 13vPnC SC group (64.3%, 65.3%, 56.1%, and 59.5%), and the 20vPnC IM group (58.1%, 60.0%, 
54.0%, and 60.8%), respectively. Irritability and drowsiness were the most commonly reported 
events. The majority of systemic events were mild or moderate. The median day of onset for systemic 
events was between Day 1 and Day 3. The median duration of systemic events was between 1 and 2 
day. 
Severe AEs were reported infrequently from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 (for ≤2.3% of 
participants) and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 (for <1% of participants) for all vaccine groups, 
with similar percentages (Table 20 and Table 21, respectively).

The percentages of participants with NDCMCs after Dose 1 were low (≤10.7%) and were similar across 
the 20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, and 20vPnC IM groups. NDCMCs were reported for ≤2.7% of participants 
from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 of 20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, or 20vPnC IM and reported for ≤0.9% 
of participants from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, or 20vPnC IM. The 
majority of NDCMCs were new diagnoses of allergic conditions. 
The percentages of participants with SAEs after Dose 1 were low and similar across the 20vPnC SC 
(6.2%), 13vPnC SC (≤4.0%), and 20vPnC IM (≤7.4%) groups (Table 22). SAEs were reported for ≤
2.3% of participants from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 and ≤0.9% of participants from Dose 4 to 1 
month after Dose 4 of 20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, or 20vPnC IM.

Two febrile convulsions occurred within 2 days after Dose 4 of study vaccine (1 participant each in the 
20vPnC SC and 20vPnC IM groups). The event in the 20vPnC IM group was considered by the 
investigator to be related to the vaccines received at Visit 5 (visit for Dose 4), not specifically due to

20vPnC alone, but also to the effects of the concomitant vaccines. The event in the 20vPnC SC group 
was not considered by the investigator to be related to vaccine, but rather due to concurrent illness.  
6.  Scientific discussion - Safety 
All subjects who received a study treatment were included in the safety population. At least 1 AE was 
reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 in 47.6% of participants in the 20vPnC SC group, 55.4% 
of participants in the 13vPnC SC group, and 58.5% of participants in the 20vPnC IM group. The 
percentages of participants with any related AEs from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 were also similar 
across the 20vPnC SC, 13vPnC SC, and 20vPnC IM groups. Hence, 20vPnC showed comparable safety 
in the study population with the licensed 13vPnC. 
The majority of AEs across all groups was mild. The most frequent AEs were redness and swelling at 
the injection site which were lower in the 20vPnC IM compared to the 20vPnC SC group. Irritability and 
drowsiness were the most frequently reported systemic events. There were no pronounced differences 
in the rates of systemic events between the groups. However, the percentages of participants with any 
systemic event within 7 days after vaccination after Doses 1 through 4 were slightly lower in the 
20vPnC SC compared to the 20vPnC IM group.  
Severe AEs after Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 3 were reported for ≤0.9% of participants in the 
20vPnC SC and 13vPnC SC groups and ≤2.3% of participants in the 20vPnC IM group. No SAEs were 
considered related to study intervention. SAEs were mostly considered related to infections. However, 
one participant in the 20vPnC IM group was diagnosed with Kawasaki’s disease 234 days after Dose 3, 
a vascular disorder with unknown cause and pathomechanism.  
Furthermore, two febrile convulsions occurred within 2 days after Dose 4 of study vaccine. The event in 
the 20vPnC IM group was considered by the investigator to be related to the received vaccines. The 
febrile convulsion in the 20vPnC SC group was not considered to be related to the vaccination due to a 
current illness, although causality is difficult to determine in such a setting. 
Taken together, no significant safety issues were identified and the mostly mild AEs were similarly 
distributed across groups.  
7.  Overall conclusion 
The purpose of the B7471016 study was to provide key safety and comparative immunogenicity data 
between 20vPnC and 13vPnC in Japanese infants to help support licensure for paediatric use in Japan.  
The CHMP (Co-)Rapporteurs agreed that study B7471016 could be submitted only via Article 46 (P46) 
in October 2022, given that the study is specific to Japan and the MAH does not plan to apply for 
inclusion of subcutaneous route of administration in the EU SmPC. 
Currently there is no data regarding infants in the EU SmPC of Apexxnar but a variation to the current 
marketing authorisation with the aim of extending the indication to children from 6 weeks to less than 
18 years of has already been submitted and is currently under assessment 
(EMEA/H/C/005451/II/0012).  
The data of study B7471016 does not warrant an inclusion in the EU SmPC since only IM 
administration of 20vPnC is relevant in the EU and the comparison with the reference product was 
conducted after SC vaccination. The benefit/risk for the currently approved indication in the EU i.e. 
intramuscular administration in adult subjects remains unaltered.

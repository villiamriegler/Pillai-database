CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tabrecta as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring alterations leading to mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene 
exon 14 (METex14) skipping, who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with 
immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Tabrecta should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
Patients have to be selected for treatment with Tabrecta based on the presence of genetic alterations 
leading to a METex14 skipping mutation in tumour tissue or plasma specimens using a validated test. 
If a genetic alteration is not detected in a plasma specimen, tumour tissue should be tested (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Tabrecta is 400 mg orally twice daily with or without food. 
Treatment should be continued based on individual safety and tolerability and as long as the patient is 
deriving clinical benefit from therapy. 
If a dose of Tabrecta is missed or vomiting occurs, the patient should not make up for the dose, but 
take the next dose at the scheduled time. 
Dose modifications 
The recommended dose reduction schedule for the management of adverse reactions based on 
individual safety and tolerability is listed in Table 1.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment as Tabrecta has not been studied 
in these patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Tabrecta in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
Tabrecta should be taken orally twice daily with or without food. Patients with swallowing difficulties 
are recommended to take Tabrecta with food. The tablets should be swallowed whole to ensure that 
the full dose is administered. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Assessment of METex14 skipping alterations status 
When detecting the presence of alterations leading to METex14 skipping using tissue-based or 
plasma-based specimens, it is important that a well-validated and robust test is chosen to avoid false 
negative or false positive results. For the characteristics of tests used in clinical studies see section 5.1.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis 
ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, has occurred in patients treated with Tabrecta (see section 4.8). 
Prompt investigation should be performed in any patient with new or worsening of pulmonary 
symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. dyspnoea, cough, fever). Tabrecta should be 
immediately withheld in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinued if no 
other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic effects 
Transaminase elevations have occurred in patients treated with Tabrecta (see section 4.8). Liver 
function tests (including ALT, AST and total bilirubin) should be performed prior to the start of 
treatment, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically 
indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase or bilirubin elevations. 
Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, temporarily withhold, dose reduce, or permanently 
discontinue Tabrecta (see section 4.2). 
Elevations of pancreatic enzymes 
Elevations in amylase and lipase levels have occurred in patients treated with Tabrecta (see 
section 4.8). Amylase and lipase should be monitored at baseline and regularly during treatment with 
Tabrecta. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, temporarily withhold, dose reduce, or 
permanently discontinue Tabrecta (see section 4.2). 
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Tabrecta can cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman due to its foetotoxicity and teratogenicity (see section 4.6). 
Pregnant women and women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential risk to a 
foetus if Tabrecta is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Tabrecta. 
Sexually active women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment 
with Tabrecta and for at least 7 days after the last dose. The pregnancy status of women of 
childbearing potential should be verified prior to starting treatment with Tabrecta. 
Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become 
pregnant should use condoms during treatment with Tabrecta and for at least 7 days after the last dose. 
Risk of photosensitivity 
Based on findings from animal studies, there is a potential risk of photosensitivity reactions with 
Tabrecta (see section 5.3). In Study GEOMETRY mono-1, it was recommended that patients limit 
direct ultraviolet exposure during treatment with Tabrecta and adopt the following protective 
measures: use of sunscreen on exposed parts of the body, wearing of protective clothing and 
sunglasses. These measures should be continued for at least 7 days after the last dose. 
Interaction with other medicinal products 
There is a potential for drug-drug interactions with Tabrecta as victim or perpetrator (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Capmatinib undergoes metabolism through CYP3A4 enzyme and aldehyde oxidase. The risk of a 
drug-drug interaction via aldehyde oxidase has not been evaluated as there are no confirmed clinically 
relevant inhibitors. 
Effect of other medicinal products on Tabrecta 
Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 200 mg capmatinib dose with the strong CYP3A 
inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily for 10 days) increased capmatinib AUCinf by 42% with no 
change in capmatinib Cmax compared to administration of capmatinib alone. Patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions during co-administration of Tabrecta with strong CYP3A inhibitors, 
including but not limited to, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, and 
voriconazole. 
Strong CYP3A inducers 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 400 mg capmatinib dose with the strong CYP3A 
inducer rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 9 days) decreased capmatinib AUCinf by 67% and decreased 
Cmax by 56% compared to administration of capmatinib alone. Decreases in capmatinib exposure may 
decrease Tabrecta anti-tumour activity. Co-administration of Tabrecta with strong CYP3A inducers, 
including but not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin and St. John’s wort 
(Hypericum perforatum), should be avoided. An alternative medicinal product with no or minimal 
potential to induce CYP3A should be considered. 
Moderate CYP3A inducers 
Simulations using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models predicted that 
co-administration of a 400 mg capmatinib dose with the moderate CYP3A inducer efavirenz (600 mg 
daily for 20 days) would result in a 44% decrease in capmatinib AUC0-12h and 34% decrease in Cmax at 
steady-state compared to administration of capmatinib alone. Decreases in capmatinib exposure may 
decrease Tabrecta anti-tumour activity. Caution should be exercised during co-administration of 
Tabrecta with moderate CYP3A inducers. 
Agents that raise gastric pH 
Capmatinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility and becomes poorly soluble as pH increases in 
vitro. In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 600 mg capmatinib dose with the proton pump 
inhibitor rabeprazole (20 mg once daily for 4 days) decreased capmatinib AUCinf by 25% and 
decreased Cmax by 38% compared to administration of capmatinib alone. Clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions between capmatinib and gastric-acid-reducing agents are unlikely to occur as 
co-administration of rabeprazole had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure of capmatinib. 
Effect of Tabrecta on other medicinal products 
Substrates of CYP enyzmes 
Moderate inhibition of CYP1A2 was observed when capmatinib was co-administered with the 
sensitive CYP1A2 substrate caffeine. Co-administration of capmatinib (400 mg twice daily) with 
caffeine increased caffeine AUCinf by 134%. If capmatinib is co-administered with narrow therapeutic 
index CYP1A2 substrates, such as theophylline and tizanidine, dose reduction of the co-administered 
medicinal product may be required. 
Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions between capmatinib and CYP3A substrates are unlikely to 
occur as co-administration of capmatinib had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure of 
midazolam (a CYP3A substrate). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrates 
In cancer patients, co-administration of digoxin (P-gp substrate) with multiple doses of capmatinib 
(400 mg twice daily) increased digoxin AUCinf by 47% and increased Cmax by 74% compared to 
administration of digoxin alone. In cancer patients, co-administration of rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) 
with multiple doses of capmatinib (400 mg twice daily) increased rosuvastatin AUCinf by 108% and 
increased Cmax by 204% compared to administration of rosuvastatin alone. Co-administration of 
Tabrecta with a P-gp or BCRP substrate may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions 
of these substrates. Caution should be exercised during co-administration of Tabrecta with P-gp 
(digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, colchicine, sitagliptin, saxagliptin and posaconazole) or BCRP 
(methotrexate, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, mitoxantrone and sulphasalazine) substrates. If capmatinib is 
co-administered with narrow therapeutic index P-gp or BCRP substrates, dose reduction of the 
co-administered medicinal product may be required. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Sexually-active women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception (methods that 
result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during treatment with Tabrecta and for at least 7 days after the 
last dose. 
Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become 
pregnant should use condoms during treatment with Tabrecta and for at least 7 days after the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of capmatinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of 
action, capmatinib is suspected to cause congenital malformations when administered during 
pregnancy. Tabrecta should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with capmatinib. 
The pregnancy status of women of childbearing potential should be verified prior to starting treatment 
with Tabrecta. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether capmatinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk after administration of 
Tabrecta. There is insufficient information on the excretion of capmatinib or its metabolites in animal 
milk. A risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded. Because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Tabrecta 
and for at least 7 days after the last dose. 
Fertility 
No human fertility data on capmatinib are available. Fertility studies with capmatinib were not 
conducted in animals. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tabrecta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

(3.8%), fatigue (3.1%) and nausea (2.5%). 
Permanent discontinuation was reported in 19 of 160 patients (11.9%). The most frequent adverse 
reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of Tabrecta were ILD/pneumonitis (3.8%), peripheral 
oedema (2.5%), ALT increased (1.3%), AST increased (1.3%), blood bilirubin increased (1.3%), 
blood creatinine increased (1.3%), lipase increased (1.3%), amylase increased (0.6%), fatigue (0.6%) 
and urticaria (0.6%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of Tabrecta was evaluated in patients with locally-advanced or metastatic NSCLC in a 
pivotal, global, prospective, multi-cohort, non-randomised, open-label Phase II study (GEOMETRY 
mono-1) across all cohorts (N=373), regardless of prior treatment or MET dysregulation (mutation 
and/or amplification) status. The frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all-cause adverse event 
frequencies identified in 160 patients with METex14 skipping mutations exposed to capmatinib at the 
recommended dose, whereas frequencies for changes in laboratory parameters are based on worsening 
from baseline shifts by at least 1 grade (grading according to CTCAE version 4.03). The safety profile 
for all GEOMETRY mono-1 patients (N=373) and for patients with METex14 skipping mutations 
(N=160) is comparable. The median duration of exposure to capmatinib across MET-mutated cohorts 
was 34.9 weeks (range: 0.4 to 195.7 weeks). Among patients who received capmatinib, 55.0% were 
exposed for at least 6 months and 36.3% were exposed for at least one year. 
Adverse reactions from clinical studies (Table 3) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within 
each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent 
reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on 
the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, 
adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
ILD/pneumonitis 
Any grade ILD/pneumonitis was reported in 12 of 160 patients (7.5%). Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis was 
reported in 7 patients (4.4%), with one fatal event of treatment-related pneumonitis (0.6%) and one 
fatal event of organising pneumonia (0.6%). ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 6 of 63 patients (9.5%) with 
a history of prior radiotherapy and 6 of 97 patients (6.2%) who did not receive prior radiotherapy. Six 
patients (3.8%) discontinued Tabrecta due to ILD/pneumonitis. ILD/pneumonitis mostly occurred 
within approximately the first 3 months of treatment. The median time-to-onset of grade 3 or higher 
ILD/pneumonitis was 7.0 weeks (range: 0.7 to 88.4 weeks). 
Hepatic effects 
Any grade ALT/AST elevations were reported in 24 of 160 patients (15.0%). Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST 
elevations were observed in 13 of 160 patients (8.1%) treated with Tabrecta. Two patients (1.3%) 
discontinued Tabrecta due to ALT/AST elevations. ALT/AST elevations mostly occurred within 
approximately the first 3 months of treatment. The median time-to-onset of grade 3 or higher 
ALT/AST elevations was 6.4 weeks (range: 2.1 to 17.9 weeks). 
Elevations of pancreatic enzymes 
Any grade amylase/lipase elevations were reported in 27 of 160 patients (16.9%). Grade 3 or 4 
amylase/lipase elevations were reported in 18 of 160 patients (11.3%) treated with Tabrecta. Three 
patients (1.9%) discontinued Tabrecta due to amylase/lipase elevations. The median time to onset of 
grade 3 or higher amylase/lipase elevations was 10.1 weeks (range: 2.3 to 68.0 weeks). 
Peripheral oedema 
Any grade peripheral oedema was reported in 108 of 160 patients (67.5%). This adverse reaction 
includes the PTs of peripheral oedema, which was the most frequent at 65.0% and peripheral swelling 
which occurred in 4.4% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 peripheral oedema was reported in 23 of 160 patients 
(14.4%) treated with Tabrecta. Four patients (2.5%) discontinued Tabrecta due to peripheral oedema. 
The median time to onset of grade 3 or higher peripheral oedema was 24.3 weeks (range: 1.4 to 
86.9 weeks). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Of the 160 patients with METex14 skipping mutations in the GEOMETRY mono-1 study who 
received 400 mg capmatinib twice daily, 85% were 65 years or older, and 4.4% were 85 years or 
older. The occurrence of grade ≥3 events increased with age. Treatment-related serious events were 
more frequent in patients aged ≥65 to <75 years (22%) and those aged ≥85 years (28.6%) when 
compared to those patients aged ≥75 to <85 years (8.5%) and patients younger than 65 years (8.3%), 
although this comparison is limited by the small sample size in patients aged ≥85 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited experience with overdose in clinical studies with Tabrecta. Patients should be closely 
monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and general supportive measures and 
symptomatic treatment should be initiated in cases of suspected overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX17. 
Mechanism of action 
Capmatinib is an inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase. Capmatinib inhibits MET 
phosphorylation (both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation triggered by the ligand hepatocyte 
growth factor [HGF]), MET-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins, as well as 
proliferation and survival of MET-dependent cancer cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Capmatinib did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent following administration 
of Tabrecta at the recommended dose. 
Detection of METex14 skipping status 
In GEOMETRY mono-1, MET exon 14 skipping mutations were determined using a qualitative real-
time PCR test (RT-PCR) designed to detect exon 14-deleted MET mRNA derived from 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue. The test is indicated as an aid in selecting non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumours carry a MET mutation that causes in-frame deletion 
of the entire exon 14 (141 bases) in mRNA for treatment with capmatinib. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of capmatinib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
with a MET exon 14 (METex14) skipping mutation was studied in a prospective, multi-cohort, 
non-randomised, open-label Phase II Study GEOMETRY mono-1. Patients (N=373) were enrolled 
into study cohorts based on their prior treatment and MET dysregulation (mutation and/or 
amplification) status. Patients with a METex14 skipping mutation (N=160) were enrolled into the 
MET-mutated cohorts regardless of MET amplification. The demonstrated efficacy of capmatinib is 
based on Cohorts 4 and 6 which enrolled 100 previously-treated patients. 
In the MET-mutated cohorts, eligible NSCLC patients were required to have Epidermal Growth Factor 
Receptor (EGFR) wild-type (for exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations) and 
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) negative status, and a METex14 skipping mutation with at least 
one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 
version 1.1, along with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1. 
Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases who were neurologically unstable 
or required increasing doses of steroids within the prior 2 weeks to manage CNS symptoms, patients 
with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease, or patients pre-treated with any MET or HGF 
inhibitor were not eligible for the study. 
In the MET-mutated cohorts, a total of 100 adult previously-treated patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with a METex14 skipping mutation were enrolled and treated with Tabrecta. The 
patients had been treated with 1 or 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease, except for 
3 patients (3.0%) who had received 3 prior lines before receiving capmatinib. The median duration of 
exposure to capmatinib was 27.9 weeks. 
Patients continued treatment until documented disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or the 
investigator determined that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The demographic characteristics of the previously-treated patients were 56% female, median age 
70 years (range: 49 to 90 years), 29% aged 75 years of age or older, 73% white, 24% Asian, 1.0% 
black, 59% never smoked, 37% were former smokers, 78% had adenocarcinoma, 26% had ECOG PS 
0, 73% had ECOG PS 1, and 17% had CNS metastases. The majority of patients (62%) had stage IV 
disease. Ninety-one percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy, 32% had prior immunotherapy, and 16% had received 2 prior systemic therapies. 
The primary endpoint of the study was overall response rate (ORR) as determined by a Blinded 
Independent Review Committee (BIRC) according to RECIST 1.1. The key secondary endpoint was 
duration of response (DOR) by BIRC. 
Efficacy results from Study GEOMETRY mono-1 for previously-treated NSCLC patients with a 
METex14 skipping mutation are summarised in Table 4.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tabrecta in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of lung malignant neoplasm (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Capmatinib exhibited dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) across the 
dose range tested (200 to 400 mg twice daily). Steady-state is expected to be achieved after 
approximately 3 days after oral dosing of capmatinib 400 mg twice daily, with a geometric mean 
accumulation ratio of 1.39 (coefficient of variation (CV): 42.9%). Inter-individual variability of Cmax 
and AUCtau was estimated to be 38% and 40%, respectively. 
Absorption 
In humans, absorption is rapid after oral administration of capmatinib. Under fasted conditions, peak 
plasma levels of capmatinib (Cmax) were reached approximately 1 to 2 hours (Tmax) after an oral 
400 mg dose of capmatinib tablets in cancer patients. Under fed conditions, Tmax is approximately 
4-6 hours. The absorption of capmatinib tablets after oral administration is estimated to be greater than 
70%. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Food effect 
Food does not alter capmatinib bioavailability to a clinically meaningful extent. Tabrecta can be 
administered with or without food (see section 4.2). 
When capmatinib was administered with food in healthy subjects, oral administration of a single 
600 mg dose with a high-fat meal increased capmatinib AUCinf by 46% and no change in Cmax 
compared to when capmatinib was administered under fasted conditions. A low-fat meal in healthy 
subjects had no clinically meaningful effect on capmatinib exposure. 
When capmatinib was administered at 400 mg twice daily in cancer patients, exposure (AUC0-12h) was 
similar after administration of capmatinib with food and under fasted conditions. 
Distribution 
Capmatinib is 96% bound to human plasma proteins, independent of concentration. The apparent 
mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) is 164 litres in cancer patients. 
The blood-to-plasma ratio was 1.5 (concentration range of 10 to 1000 ng/ml), but decreased at higher 
concentrations to 0.9 (concentration 10000 ng/ml), indicating a saturation of distribution into red 
blood cells. 
Capmatinib crosses the blood-brain barrier (see section 5.3). 
Biotransformation 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that capmatinib is cleared mainly through metabolism driven by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (40-50%) and aldehyde oxidase (40%). The biotransformation of 
capmatinib occurs essentially by Phase I metabolic reactions including C-hydroxylation, lactam 
formation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, carboxylic acid formation, and combinations thereof. Phase II 
reactions involve glucuronidation of oxygenated metabolites. The most abundant radioactive 
component in plasma is unchanged capmatinib (42.9% of radioactivity AUC0-12h). The major 
circulating metabolite, M16 (CMN288), is pharmacologically inactive and accounts for 21.5% of the 
radioactivity in plasma AUC0-12h. 
Elimination 
The effective elimination half-life (calculated based on geometric mean accumulation ratio) of 
capmatinib is 6.54 hours. The geometric mean steady-state apparent oral clearance (CLss/F) of 
capmatinib was 19.8 litres/hour. 
Capmatinib is eliminated mainly through metabolism, and subsequent faecal excretion. Following a 
single oral administration of [14C]-capmatinib capsule to healthy subjects, 78% of the total 
radioactivity was recovered in the faeces and 22% in the urine. Excretion of unchanged capmatinib in 
urine is negligible. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness were observed between patients aged 65 and 
75 years or older and younger patients. 
Effect of age, gender, race and body weight 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender, 
race, or body weight on the systemic exposure of capmatinib. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 207 patients with normal renal function 
(creatinine clearance [CLcr] ≥90 ml/min), 200 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to 
89 ml/min), and 94 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 ml/min), mild or moderate 
renal impairment had no clinically significant effect on the exposure of capmatinib. Tabrecta has not 
been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 29 ml/min) (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
A study was conducted in non-cancer subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment based on 
Child-Pugh classification using a 200 mg single-dose of capmatinib. The geometric mean systemic 
exposure (AUCinf) of capmatinib was decreased by approximately 23% and 9% in subjects with mild 
(N=6) and moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment, respectively, and increased by approximately 24% in 
subjects with severe (N=6) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal (N=9) hepatic 
function. Mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment had no clinically significant effect on the 
exposure of capmatinib. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
Capmatinib exposure-response relationships and the time course of the pharmacodynamic response are 
unknown. 
In vitro evaluation of medicinal product interaction potential 
Interactions between enzymes and Tabrecta 
In vitro studies showed that capmatinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. 
Capmatinib also showed weak induction of CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 in cultured human hepatocytes. 
Simulations using PBPK models predicted that capmatinib given at a dose of 400 mg twice daily is 
unlikely to cause clinically relevant interaction via CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19. 
Interactions between transporters and Tabrecta 
Based on in vitro data, capmatinib is a P-gp substrate, but not a BCRP or multidrug 
resistance-associated (MRP2) substrate. Capmatinib is not a substrate of transporters involved in 
active hepatic uptake in primary human hepatocytes. 
Based on in vitro data, capmatinib and its major metabolite CMN288 showed reversible inhibition of 
renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2K. Capmatinib may inhibit MATE1 and MATE2K at clinically 
relevant concentrations. 
Based on in vitro data, capmatinib showed reversible inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1. However, capmatinib is not expected to cause clinically relevant 
inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 uptake transporters based on the concentration 
achieved at the therapeutic dose. Capmatinib is not an inhibitor of renal transporters OAT1 or OAT3. 
Capmatinib is not a MRP2 inhibitor in vitro.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated-dose toxicity 
Signs indicative of CNS toxicity (such as tremors and/or convulsions), and histopathological findings 
of white matter vacuolation in the thalamus/caudate/putamen regions of the midbrain were observed in 
rats at doses ≥2.9 exposure multiples of the human clinical exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg 
twice daily dose. No signs of CNS toxicity or brain abnormalities were observed in cynomolgus 
monkey studies. The relevance of the CNS findings in rats to humans is unknown. 
Capmatinib crossed the blood-brain barrier in rats with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of 
approximately 9%. 
A reversible, minimal-to-mild subcapsular neutrophilic infiltration associated with single cell necrosis 
was seen in the liver of male monkeys treated for 13 weeks at dose levels of ≥4.7 exposure multiples 
of the human clinical exposure based on AUC at the 400 mg twice daily dose. 
Genotoxicity 
Capmatinib is not genotoxic based on a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, capmatinib was teratogenic and foetotoxic at 
dose levels not eliciting maternal toxicity. In rats, decreased foetal weight and increased incidence of 
litters and foetuses with limb malformations were observed at the maternal exposure of ≥0.89 
exposure multiples of the anticipated clinical exposure (based on the AUC). In rabbits, limb, lung and 
tongue malformations were seen at the maternal exposure of ≥0.025 exposure multiples of the 
anticipated clinical exposure. 
Photosensitivity 
In vitro and in vivo photosensitisation assays with capmatinib suggested that capmatinib has the 
potential for photosensitisation.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tabrecta is and what it is used for 
What Tabrecta is 
Tabrecta contains the active substance capmatinib, which belongs to a class of medicines called 
protein kinase inhibitors. 
What Tabrecta is used for 
Tabrecta is a medicine used to treat adults with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). It is used if the lung cancer is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) 
and is caused by a change (mutation) in a gene that makes an enzyme called MET. 
Your tumour or blood will be tested for certain mutations in this gene. Your cancer is likely to respond 
to treatment with Tabrecta if the test result is positive. 
How Tabrecta works 
Tabrecta helps to slow down or stop the growth and spread of your lung cancer if it is caused by a 
mutation in a gene that makes MET. 
If you have any questions about how Tabrecta works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

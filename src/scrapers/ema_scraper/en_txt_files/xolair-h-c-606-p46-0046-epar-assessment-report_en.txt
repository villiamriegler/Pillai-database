1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
On 14 Aug 2015 the MAH submitted the study IGE025ATW01 a prospective, open label, 
observational, non-interventional, multicenter, 52-week study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
Xolair in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma. The study included one pediatric 
subject why the data is submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, 
on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
Xolair is approved as add-on therapy to children 6-12 years of age to improve asthma control in 
patients with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to 
a perennial aeroallergen and frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have 
had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. A similar indication is approved for 
adolescents and adults.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM P46 
046 
2.1.  Purpose of submission 
Study [IGE025ATW01 (EXACT)] (last patient last visit on 17-Jun-2014) was a prospective, open 
label, observational, non-interventional, multicenter, 52-week study to assess the efficacy and 
safety of Xolair in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma. This study targeted a 
specific patient population with asthma of allergic nature and excluded patients whose asthma was 
associated/secondary to other clinical and non-allergic conditions and was conducted in patients ≥ 
12 years of age, from 8 centers in Taiwan.   
The primary objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of Xolair at 12 weeks based on 
improvement of asthma control status composed of asthma control test (ACT), reduction of oral or 
inhaled corticosteroid dose and reduction of asthma related events.

The secondary objectives were  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability based on the incidence of AEs and SAEs 
To observe treatment persistence over the period of 52 weeks. 
To collect reasons for non-persistent treatment (a treatment interruption over 12 weeks or 
discontinuation of treatment was regarded as non-persistence of Xolair) 
To evaluate the effectiveness of Xolair on pulmonary function and exhaled nitric oxide 
response at 12 and 52 weeks in persistent and non-persistent patients  
To evaluate clinical effectiveness of Xolair at 52 weeks based on improvement of asthma 
control status in persistent and non-persistent patients 
Seventy-eight participants were enrolled in the trial and all received Xolair. A treatment 
interruption over 12 weeks, or discontinuation of treatment, was regarded as non-persistence of 
Xolair. The non-persistence group consisted of one third of the patients. The results of the 
persistence group and the non-persistence group were compared in the evaluation of efficacy and 
safety. 
The results of this study are now submitted to the CHMP according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006 since it includes one pediatric patient. 
CHMP comment: 
Several endpoints are listed as primary objectives of this study. The subjects that were non-
persistent were used for comparison of data between groups. The most common reason for non-
persistence was treatment interruption >week 12 (23/26). The study design makes the results 
difficult to interpret as the non-persistence group includes patients withdrawing from treatment for 
different reasons, some of which possibly linked to lack of efficacy. 
2.2.  Efficacy 
The overall mean ACT score was 16.0 ± 5.02 points at baseline in the ITT population. There were 
increases in the mean change in ACT score from baseline to weeks 12 and 52 (p<0.001) 
During the 52 weeks of observation, the incidence of asthma related events was 23.0%. The 
definition of asthma related events was unscheduled visits in healthcare due to asthma 
exacerbation. The most frequent event was emergency room visits. The incidence of at least one 
asthma related event was 21.6% for the persistence group and 26.1% for the non-persistence 
group.  
At week 52, a mean increase of 8.0 ± 54.19 L/min in Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) was observed in 
the ITT population. 
CHMP comment: 
One of the endpoints stated as primary was reached as a significant increase in the ACT score from 
baseline throughout the study was recorded.  Instead of the reduction of corticosteroid dose the 
MAH present data from lung function tests but there was no significant effect on these parameters. 
Data on the effect on oral or inhaled corticosteroids could not be found in the study report.  
The presentation of study data appears incomplete and is thus difficult to interpret.

2.3.  Safety 
There were 251 AEs that occurred in 57 patients (73.1%). Sixteen AEs occurred in ten patients 
(12.8%) which were judged to be related to the study treatment. The most commonly reported 
SAE was asthma exacerbation. Other SAEs reported included pneumonia, septic shock, infectious 
diarrhea, congestive heart failure, acute hepatitis, unstable angina, rib fracture and death.  
One patient died in the none-persistence group. The death was not considered related to study 
medication. 
2.4.  Pediatric summary 
One pediatric patient was enrolled in this trial: patient 07-002 was a 13 year old male, who 
completed the study. The patient had an asthma exacerbation, which was reported as an SAE for 
which he was hospitalized and the patient also had 3 other asthma exacerbations reported as 
moderate, which were not reported as SAEs. None of the exacerbations were suspected to be 
related to the study drug. 
2.5.  Overall conclusion 
Effect on one of the primary objectives, the ACT score, was shown in this study (IGE025ATW01) in 
the ITT population. Given the minimal amount of pediatric data, no new efficacy conclusions can be 
drawn in the pediatric group. There are no new safety concerns and no changes to the benefit/risk 
profile of Xolair. 
CHMP comment: The MAH has presented paediatric data as requested in legislation. Only one 
paediatric patient was included in this study why no conclusion can be drawn on efficacy.  Safety 
was adequately documented and there were no unexpected findings. The study report as such 
gives raise to several questions and no firm conclusions could be drawn on efficacy. Nevertheless, 
considering that this PAM is submitted in accordance with Article 46, issues related to the adult 
population included in the study are not pursued. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion 
3.1.  Overall conclusion 
The presented data does not change the benefit risk for omalizumab in the paediatric approved 
indications. No changes are warranted in the SmPC. 
3.2.  Recommendation 
No further action required. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required 
  PAM not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required:

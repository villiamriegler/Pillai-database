1.2.  Introduction  
Epidyolex (sponsor product code GWP42003-P) was approved, via the EU centralised procedure by the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), with European Commission (EC) decision 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

issued on 19th September 2019 for the following indication: Epidyolex is indicated for use as 
adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome 
(DS), in conjunction with clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older. 
The objective of this study was to determine whether GWP42003-P affects the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile of stiripentol (STP) or valproate (VPA). And secondary: 
To assess the safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P in the presence of STP or VPA. 
To assess whether GWP42003-P affects the PK profile of: 2 propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA), 
Clobazam (CLB), N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB), Levetiracetam (LEV), Topiramate (TPM) in patients 
also being treated with STP or VPA and other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
The Applicant intends to submit a grouped type 2 variation under the classification C.I.5, along with 3 
other drug-drug interaction studies that will have impact on the SmPC, planned for Q2 2020. However, 
as GWEP1447 falls under Article 46, the study report is being provided now for information. The 
grouped Type II variation for the 4 drug-drug interaction studies (including GWEP1447) has been 
agreed with the EMA PM and the related communication is enclosed with the cover letter.  
The GWEP1447 study results further support the approved Epidyolex SmPC (section 4.5) statement on 
the Epidyolex-Stiripentol interaction. The Applicant will also propose the following highlighted updates 
to be included in section 4.5 as a result of GWEP1447:  
Stiripentol  
When cannabidiol was combined with stiripentol in a healthy volunteer trial there was an minor 
increase in stiripentol levels of 28% for maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax) and 55% 
for AUC. In patients, however, the effect was smaller, with an increase in stiripentol levels of 17% in 
Cmax and 30% in AUC. The clinical importance of these results, has not been studied. The patient 
should be closely monitored for adverse drug reactions.” 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has not submitted a full clinical study report (CSR) but merely a synoptic CSR.  
Additional data are presented as summary tables for baseline characteristics, demographics, 
and safety data and as patient narratives for Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
and Other Significant Events. The text as proposed is not endorsed in this procedure, but 
will await the planned type 2 variation. 
A revised text is proposed to replace the text given by the Applicant for section 4.5.

2.  Summary of data submitted  
2.1.  Methodology 
2.1.2  Study design 
Study 1 was a phase 2, multisite, double-blind (DB), randomized, placebo-controlled, PK trial in 34 
patients on stable STP or VPA treatment. Eligible patients entered the trial at Visit 1 (Day -14 to Day -
7) and began a 7- to 14-day baseline period. Patients who satisfied all eligibility criteria were then 
randomized at Visit 2 (Day 1) to receive GWP42003-P or placebo via STP or VPA arms in a 4:1 ratio. 
Patients received their first dose of GWP42003-P/placebo at home on Day 2. Patients titrated 
GWP42003-P or placebo to a maintenance dose or equivalent maintenance dose level (20 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P or equivalent volume of placebo) over 10 days and remained at this dose for 14 days 
(Day 12 to Day 25). A further clinic visit occurred on Day 12 (Visit 3), and patients returned to the 
clinic for an end-of-treatment visit after 25 days of treatment (Visit 4, Day 26) or earlier if they 
withdrew prematurely. Upon completion of the blinded period of the trial (Day 26), patients were 
invited to receive GWP42003-P during the open-label extension (OLE) period. If a patient chose not to 
enter the OLE period, and/or the investigator did not feel it was in their best interests, patients then 
tapered down GWP42003-P or placebo during a 10-day taper period and returned to the clinic for an 
end-of-taper period visit (Visit 5, Day 36) followed by a safety follow-up visit 28 days later (Visit 6, 
Day 64). All patients were taking either STP or VPA, with or without other concomitant AEDs. 
Pharmacokinetic samples were taken on Day 1 (Visit 2), before commencing treatment with 
GWP42003-P or placebo (investigational medicinal product [IMP]), and after completing 25 days of 
treatment (Day 26, Visit 4) with IMP.

CHMP comments 
This trial used a randomized, DB design and a placebo concurrent control, as recommended by the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the 
Treatment of Epileptic Disorders. The treatment periods (including the titration periods), 10 day taper 
period, and 28 day follow-up period were chosen based on revised guidance from the EMA on the 
conduct and design of drug-drug - interaction studies. This is endorsed.  
2.1.3  Number of Patients (Planned and Analyzed): 
A total of 34 patients were planned for randomization (14 patients in the STP and 20 patients in the 
VPA arm); a total of 35 patients were randomized and 34 patients received 20 mg/kg/day GWP42003-
P or placebo.

CHMP comments 
A total of 34 patients (14 patients in the STP and 20 patients in the VPA arm) were planned for 
randomization. No power calculation is presented. The statistical significance of findings may be less 
relevant than the clinical interpretations of the findings. The study is expected to be adequate in 
sample size for a clinical conclusion.  
2.1.4  Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
Patients were to be male or female aged between 16 and 55 years old (inclusive) (18 to 55 years in 
Sweden) and had to be taking STP or VPA and no more than 2 other AEDs during the blinded period of 
the trial (in VPA arm only, patients must not have been receiving STP). All AEDs or interventions 
(including vagus nerve stimulation and/or ketogenic diet) must have been stable for 4 weeks prior to 
baseline and remained stable throughout the blinded phase of the trial. Patients had to have a 
documented magnetic resonance imaging/computerized tomography of the brain that ruled out a 
progressive neurologic condition. Patients must have experienced at least 1 countable uncontrolled 
seizure of any type (i.e., tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, atonic, partial onset or focal; focal seizures with 
retained consciousness and a motor component, focal seizures with impaired consciousness, focal 
seizures evolving to bilateral secondary generalization) within 2 months prior to randomization. 
Patients and/or their legal representatives were willing and able to give informed consent/assent, and 
patients were willing and able (in the investigator’s opinion) to comply with all trial requirements. 
2.1.5  Investigational Medicinal Product, Dose and Mode of Administration, Batch 
Number:  
GWP42003-P was presented as a clear, colorless to yellow solution containing 100 mg/mL cannabidiol 
(CBD) in the excipients sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol (79 mg/mL) with added sweetener 
(sucralose) and strawberry flavouring . GWP42003-P was taken orally as per intended commercial 
therapeutic use and was to be taken twice daily (b.i.d.) (morning and evening) immediately after the 
patients’ usual STP or VPA administration, following the dosing schedule below: • Day 2, patients 
commenced titration with GWP42003-P at home to a maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg/day over a period 
of 10 days (Day 2 to Day 11). • After titration with GWP42003-P, patients continued to take this 
maintenance dose of GWP42003-P/placebo for 14 days (Days 12 to 25), before coming in for the final 
PK visit on Day 26. • On Day 27, patients either entered a tapering period (10% per day over 10 days) 
or, if the patient elected to participate in the OLE, they entered a 10-day period of simultaneous 
tapering (of GWP42003-P/placebo) and titration (of GWP42003-P) in order to maintain blinding. 
Patients used their own supply of STP or VPA. STP or VPA was taken orally as prescribed.

CHMP comments 
The exact timing in relation to food intake was not recorded, but administration is expected to be in 
some relation to a meal as CBD was to be taken in the morning and in the evening. Exposure of CBD 
is overall consistent with exposure previously seen when administered with food.  
2.1.6  Comparator, Dose, and Mode of Administration; Batch Number:  
GW supplied the placebo, which was an oral solution matched to GWP42003-P, containing the 
excipients sesame oil and anhydrous ethanol with added sweetener (sucralose) and strawberry 
flavoring. Placebo was taken orally b.i.d. (morning and evening) immediately after the patients’ usual 
STP or VPA administration, and followed the same dosing schedule described for GWP42003-P.  
2.1.7  Duration of Treatment:  
The screening period was 8 days (Day -14 to Day -7). The DB treatment period was 25 days (10-day 
titration period and 15-day maintenance period). 
2.1.8  Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy: Not applicable.  
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics/Pharmacogenetics:  
The primary endpoints of the trial were the dose-normalized (DN) PK parameters (maximum measured 
plasma concentration [Cmax], time to maximum plasma concentration [tmax], area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve over a dosing interval, where tau is the dosing interval [AUCtau], and area 
under the concentration-time curve from time zero to last observable concentration at time t [AUC0-t]) 
for the following analytes when STP or VPA was taken alone or in combination with GWP42003-P or 
placebo:  
• STP 
• VPA 
• CBD 
The secondary endpoints of the trial were the safety parameters and the DN PK parameters 
Cmax, tmax, AUCtau, and AUC0–t for the following analytes: 
• 4-ene-VPA 
• CLB 
• N-CLB 
• LEV

• TPM 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 patient genotype analyses were performed. 
Safety: 
The safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P compared with placebo when taken in combination 
with STP or VPA were assessed using the following parameters: 
• Adverse events (AEs) 
• 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
• Clinical laboratory parameters (biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis) 
• Physical examination. 
• Vital signs 
• Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
• Seizure frequency 
• Abuse liability 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has clearly presented the primary and secondary endpoint of each part of the studies 
(double blind phase and open-label extension). All the chosen endpoints are considered relevant or 
the corresponding objectives.  
2.1.9  Pharmacokinetic /Pharmacogenetic Methods:  
Bioanalytical: Validated liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical methods were 
used to quantify concentrations of CBD, STP, VPA, 4-ene-VPA, CLB, N-CLB, LEV, and TPM in human 
plasma. Pharmacokinetics: The plasma concentration/time curves of STP, VPA, 4-ene-VPA, CLB, N-
CLB, LEV, and TPM) were assessed at Day 1 (Visit 2) and STP, VPA, 4-ene-VPA, CLB, N-CLB, LEV, TPM, 
and CBD at Day 26 (Visit 4). Patients were given their daily dose of STP or VPA at a scheduled time 
during Visit 2 and Visit 4 and GWP42003-P/placebo immediately afterward (at Visit 4 only) to facilitate 
the accurate timing of blood samples required for PK analysis. Blood samples were taken by either 
direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted into a forearm vein at the following time points: 
predose, 15 and 30 minutes, then 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours postdose. The timing of each PK 
sample was relative to the morning dose of STP or VPA. The predose blood sample was taken within 30 
minutes prior to dosing. The allowable window for postdose blood sample collection was ± 2 minutes 
up to and including 1 hour postdose, ± 5 minutes from 1.5 hours up to and including 6 hours postdose, 
and ± 1 hour at 12 hours postdose.

In the event of an AE that, in the opinion of the investigator, was related to a concomitant AED, 
additional blood samples may have been collected. Analyses of all PK samples for a given analyte were 
conducted at a single bioanalytical laboratory. Sample volume requirements and processing procedures 
were detailed in a separate laboratory manual. Pharmacogenetics: Genetic testing was conducted, if 
specific consent was obtained from the patient, to look at sequencing CYP isoforms, with particular 
focus on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism of AEDs and CBD. No PK/pharmacogenetic 
correlations were planned in this trial. 
CHMP comments 
Overall, the bioanalytical methods applied for the determination of CBD, STP, VPA, CLB, N-CLB. LEV 
and TPM concentrations in human serum are considered acceptable. 
Genetic testing was conducted, if specific consent was obtained from the patient, to look at 
sequencing CYP isoforms, with particular focus on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism 
of AEDs and CBD. No PK/pharmacogenetic correlations were planned in this trial. This is accepted. 
2.1.10  Statistical Methods:  
All statistical testing was performed in accordance with standard practice. There were no 
predetermined covariates and no plans to replace missing data points. There was no formal sample 
size calculation, and analyses were descriptive only. Plasma concentrations of STP, VPA, 4-ene-VPA, 
CBD, and AEDs were displayed graphically (geometric mean concentrations by treatment group and 
visit), summarized (by nominal time point and visit), and listed for the PK population. PK parameters 
(Cmax and AUCtau) were calculated by noncompartmental analysis, listed by patient, and summarized 
by treatment group and visit. For statistical analysis of a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between 
GWP42003-P and STP or VPA, a standard 90% confidence interval (CI) approach for the between time 
point ratios of geometric means of Cmax and AUCtau was carried out on logarithmic scale using a 
linear mixed effect model. The no-effect boundary was set between 0.5 and 2.0, and if the 90% CI for 
the ratio of the geometric means of a PK variable fell within the interval [0.5, 2.0], a lack of 
meaningful effect was declared. Estimates were back transformed to provide summaries on the original 
scale. The model included a fixed effect term for the PK assessment period. An unstructured 
covariance matrix was used. Kenward and Roger’s method was used to calculate the denominator 
degrees of freedom for the fixed effects. Plasma concentrations and PK parameters for VPA, STP, LEV, 
and TPM were summarized descriptively for the PK population. However, any DDI was not formally 
assessed. Safety data were analysed descriptively; summaries and listings were generated for the 
safety population set and presented by treatment.

2.2.  Results 
2.2.1 Summary of Results Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics: 
In total, 35 patients were screened for participation and randomized. Among the 14 patients in the STP 
arm (Table 8.2.1-1), 2 were randomized to placebo and 12 were randomized to GWP42003-P. Among 
the 21 patients in the VPA arm (Table 8.2.2-1), 4 were randomized to placebo and 17 were 
randomized to GWP42003-P; 1 patient randomized to GWP42003-P withdrew before receiving 
treatment. All patients were White. The mean age in the STP arm was 29.86 years, and the mean body 
mass index (BMI) was 26.49 kg/m2. The mean age in the VPA arm was 29.27 years, and the mean 
BMI was 27.02 kg/m2 . All patients had a history of seizures at baseline and the most commonly 
occurring seizure type in both treatment arms was complex partial seizures (50.0% in the STP arm and 
55.0% in the VPA arm). All but 1 patient in the STP arm were taking other AEDs in addition to STP or 
VPA at baseline.

CHMP comments 
Demographic data has been presented adequately. The groups appear to be comparable except in 
regards of sex. Only Caucasians have been included, and all patients had a history of seizures at 
baseline and the most commonly occurring seizure type in both treatment arms was complex partial 
seizures (50.0% in the STP arm and 55.0% in the VPA arm). All but 1 patient in the STP arm were 
taking other AEDs in addition to STP or VPA at baseline. The presented interaction study has only 
been performed in patients between 16 and 55 years of age, but is considered relevant for other age 
groups except very young children < 1 year. 
The minimum age of included patients is 17.4 years. No specific information regarding PK, efficacy or 
safety can be concluded from this study.  
2.2.2 Pharmacokinetic results

STP Plasma Concentrations 
At all time points on Day 26, geometric mean plasma concentrations of STP in the presence of 
GWP42003-P were higher than on Day 1 (without GWP42003-P). By contrast, there was no clear 
difference between the STP plasma concentration vs. time curves between placebo groups on Day 26 
compared with Day 1. The STP plasma concentration vs. time curves in the placebo group on Day 1 
and Day 26 were also similar to that for Day 1 for the GWP42003-P group.

CHMP comments 
STP plasma concentrations increased significantly when co-administered with CBD, confirming a 
pharmacokinetic D-D interaction. Therefore, close monitoring of the patient should be performed when 
the two drugs are administered simultaneously. This information is adequately displayed in the SmPC. 
Clobazam and N-Desmethylclobazam Plasma Concentrations 
Clobazam plasma concentrations 
On Day 26, plasma concentrations of CLB in the presence of GWP42003-P were higher than on Day 1 
(without GWP42003-P) at early time points. After 2 hours, the plasma concentration profiles of CLB on 
Day 1 and Day 26 were generally similar (Figure 8.4.2.3.3.2-1, below).

CHMP comments 
It should be noticed that Epidyolex (CBD) is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures 
associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with 
clobazam (CLB). Results from the present study illustrated how the plasma concentrations of the CLB 
metabolite, N-CLB were significantly higher when CLB was co-administered with CBD. 
Levetiracetam Plasma Concentrations 
On Day 26, plasma concentrations of LEV were higher than on Day 1 at the early time points. After 2 
hours, the plasma concentration profiles were generally similar between Day 1 and Day 26, illustrated 
in Fig. 8.4.2.3.3.3-1, below.

ng∙h/mL/(mg/kg) (CV%: 52.3). These parameters were consistent with previous trials (Table 
8.4.2.5.2.2-1). 
Geometric mean DN PK parameters for CLB and N-CLB are summarized in Table 8.4.2.5.2.3-1. There 
were no Day 26 data for TPM and no data available for LEV.

VPA Plasma Concentrations 
At all time points on Day 26, in the presence of GWP42003-P, plasma concentrations of VPA were 
lower than on Day 1 (without GWP42003-P). By contrast, there was no clear difference between the 
VPA plasma concentration vs. time curves between placebo samples on Day 26 compared with Day 1, 
as illustrated in Figure 8.4.2.4.1-1 below.

CHMP comments 
Plasma concentrations of VPN and 4-ene-VPN were in general lower when VPN was co-administered 
with CBD. CBD may have some induction potential on UGT isoforms, but the clinical relevance in 
expected to be minor.  
CBD Plasma Concentrations 
The steady-state profile of CBD in the presence of VPA and other AEDs at Day 26 is consistent with 
previous trials. 
Clobazam 
At all time points on Day 26, plasma concentrations of CLB in the presence of GWP42003-P were 
higher than on Day 1 (without GWP42003-P), illustrated in fig. 8.4.2.4.4.1-1, below. Furthermore, at 
all time points on Day 26, plasma concentrations of N-CLB in the presence of GWP42003-P were higher 
than on Day 1, illustrated in Figure 8.4.2.4.4.1-2, below.

CHMP comments 
Plasma CLB and the metabolite N-CLB were both significantly increased when administered with CBD 
in the VPN arm. The MAH should elaborate on and discuss the reason why P-CLB was increased in the 
VPN-arm but not in the STP-arm when CLB was co-administered with CBD. The objective of the study 
was not to investigate the interaction between CBD and CLB including the effect on N-CLB exposure 
and the findings reflect very few patients. 
Pharmacokinetic conclusions 
The MAH draws the following conclusion on the results presented: 
• The PK profile of CBD after concomitant administration of STP or VPA was consistent with previous 
trials. 
• Coadministration of GWP42003-P with STP between Days 2 to 26 did not show a marked effect of 
GWP42003-P on the PK of STP. There were small increases in exposure (30% for AUCtau) to STP. 
• Coadministration of GWP42003-P with VPA between Days 2 to 26 did not show a marked effect of 
GWP42003-P on the PK of VPA or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA. There were minor decreases in plasma 
Cmax and AUCtau of VPA (approximately 17% and 21%, respectively) and 4-ene-VPA (approximately 
28% and 33%, respectively).  
• GWP42003-P coadministration with STP or VPA showed no effect on the PK of CLB. 
CHMP comments  
As stated by the Applicant in the responses to the list of question, it should be noted that the study 
was not designed to examine the effects of CBD on PK of CLB and N-CLB. Therefore, the final bullet 
point in the conclusion is not supported.   
2.2.3 Efficacy results 
Efficacy assessments were not measured as outcomes for this trial. However, the numbers and types 
of seizures were collected each day from screening (Visit 1) in the DB period. 
CHMP comments 
Efficacy assessments were not measured as outcomes for this trial, and has not been evaluated by the 
MAH. Therefore, no assessment of efficacy will be included in the present AR.

2.2.4 Safety Results:  
GWP42003-P administered at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day was generally well tolerated when 
coadministered with STP or VPA to adult patients with epilepsy. The most common TEAEs were 
gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting), consistent with the safety profile of 
GWP42003-P at this dose. Most TEAEs were of mild or moderate severity. One patient in the STP arm 
who received GWP42003-P experienced a severe, serious TEAE of rash, which led to discontinuation of 
the IMP (GWP42003-P). This was the only SAE reported in the STP arm. One patient in the VPA arm 
experienced a serious TEAE of moderate hypertransaminasaemia (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 5.5 
× upper limit of normal [ULN]), which led to discontinuation of the IMP (GWP42003-P). Both SAEs 
resolved, and the patients recovered. Both STP and VPA arms showed mean increases from baseline in 
ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in patients treated with GWP42003-P. There were no 
instances of laboratory findings that met Hy’s Law criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury. Two 
patients receiving GWP42003-P in the STP arm had TEAEs of ALT increased and AST increased. The 
ALT values for 1 of these patients met the predefined toxicity criteria (≥ 2.6 × ULN) but did not exceed 
3 × ULN. The ALT and AST increases for the second patient did not meet the predefined toxicity 
criteria. One patient (GWP42003-P) in the VPA arm had TEAEs (ALT increased, 
hypertransaminasaemia). A second patient (GWP42003-P) in the VPA arm had an ALT level of 365 U/L 
(12.2 × ULN) and an AST level of 205 U/L (5.4 × ULN) at Visit 4 (Day 28); these findings were not 
reported as TEAEs. There was little or no effect of GWP42003-P on other laboratory parameters, vital 
signs, physical examination findings, or ECGs in either STP or VPA arm. No patients had treatment-
emergent suicidal ideation or behaviour. There was no evidence of abuse liability. Among the 10 
patients in the STP arm who had data available, 5 (50.0%) patients in the GWP42003-P group showed 
a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline; seizure data were not available for 2 patients in the 
placebo group. Among the 16 patients in the VPA arm overall who had data available, 5 (41.7%) 
patients in the GWP42003-P group showed a decrease in seizure frequency from baseline compared 
with 2 (50%) patients in the placebo group. These results should be interpreted with caution in light of 
the small sample size. 
CHMP comments  
The most common TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting), 
consistent with the safety profile of GWP42003-P at this dose, previously reported. Most TEAEs were 
of mild or moderate severity. One patient in the STP arm who received GWP42003-P experienced a 
severe, serious TEAE of rash, which led to discontinuation of the IMP (GWP42003-P). This was the 
only SAE reported in the STP arm. One patient in the VPA arm experienced a serious TEAE of 
moderate hypertransaminasaemia (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 5.5 × upper limit of normal 
[ULN]), which led to discontinuation of the IMP (GWP42003-P). Both SAEs resolved, and the patients 
recovered.

3.  Scientific discussion  
Two phase II studies (double blind phase and open-label extension) have been submitted in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006 as subjects < 18 years of age have been included. 
However, the minimum age of included subjects is 17.4 years and therefore the significance of the 
study from a paediatric point of view is limited.  
The studies presented by the MAH have been conducted to determine whether GWP42003-P affects the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of stiripentol (STP) or valproate (VPA). And secondary: i) To assess the 
safety and tolerability of GWP42003-P in the presence of STP or VPA. ii) To assess whether 
GWP42003-P affects the PK profile of: 2 propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA), Clobazam (CLB), N-
desmethylclobazam (N-CLB), Levetiracetam (LEV), Topiramate (TPM) in patients also being treated 
with STP or VPA and other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
A randomized, DB design and a placebo concurrent control was used as recommended by the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of 
Epileptic Disorders, which is endorsed. The medicinal product was not administered under prespecified 
fed conditions. 
The MAH has clearly presented the primary and secondary endpoint of each part of the study. All the 
chosen endpoints are considered relevant or the corresponding objectives. A total of 34 patients (14 
patients in the STP and 20 patients in the VPA arm) were planned for randomization. A power 
calculation has not been presented, but the sample size appears adequate for purpose.  
Demographic data has been presented adequately. The groups appear to be comparable except in 
regards of sex. The study has been performed in patients between 16 and 55 years of age. It is 
considered acceptable to extrapolate other age groups except very young children < 1 year. (OC).  
CBD is subject to hepatic metabolism by the CYP450 isoenzyme system (mainly CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4), resulting in numerous hydroxylated metabolites and an acid metabolite. CBD is also a 
relatively potent reversible inhibitor of the major hepatic CYP450 enzymes (CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9 
and 2C19) in vitro23. Existing AEDs are metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, and therefore assessment of 
the pharmacological interaction between CBD, its metabolites and concomitant AEDs is important. The 
presented study assessed the potential for DDIs between CBD at steady state and STP or VPA when 
administered against a background of additional AEDs. STP plasma concentrations increased 
significantly when co-administered with CBD, confirming a pharmacokinetic D-D interaction. It should 
be noticed that Epidyolex (CBD) is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with clobazam (CLB). 
Results from the present study illustrated how the plasma concentrations of CLB (in the VPN arm) and 
the metabolite, N-CLB (in both the STP and VPN arm) were significantly higher when CLB was co-
administered with CBD. Plasma concentrations of VPN and 4-ene-VPN were in general lower when VPN 
was co-administered with CBD. No new clinical findings are considered relevant to be reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Safety data are presented as patient narratives for Serious Treatment-emergent Adverse Events and 
Other Significant Events. The most common TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea,

and vomiting), consistent with the safety profile of GWP42003-P at this dose, previously reported. One 
patient in the VPA arm experienced a serious TEAE of moderate hypertransaminasaemia (alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] 5.5 × upper limit of normal [ULN]).  
4.  First List of questions 
4.1.  Major objections 
No Major objections have been identified.  
4.2.  Other concerns 
1.  A total of 34 patients (14 patients in the STP and 20 patients in the VPA arm) were planned for 
randomization. However, no power calculation is presented. The MAH should therefore clarify 
and justify how the planned number of 34 patients was achieved, and justify that the study is 
powered adequately.  
2.  The MAH should clarify whether the medicinal product was administered under fed- or fasting 
conditions in that food intake is known to significantly affect the exposure of CBD, and thus 
may bias the results of the present interaction study/ies.  
3.  The MAH should justify that the sex of patient does not affect the PK of CBD. Furthermore, is 
should appear from the SmPC that the presented interaction study has only been performed in 
patients between 16 and 55 years of age, and that due to the complex metabolism of CBD it is 
difficult to extrapolate the results to other age groups, and in specific very young children.  
4.  STP plasma concentrations increased significantly when co-administered with CBD, confirming 
a pharmacokinetic D-D interaction. Therefore, close monitoring of the patient should be 
performed when the two drugs are administered simultaneously, herein monitoring of plasma 
concentrations of CBD and STP. This information should be clearly displayed in the SmPC. 
5.  Results from the STP-arm illustrated how the plasma concentrations of the CLB metabolite, N-
CLB were significantly higher when CLB was co-administered with CBD. Therefore, closely 
monitoring of the patients and monitoring CLB and nCLB levels is necessary for clinical care of 
patients. This information should be clearly displayed in the SmPC. 
6.  Plasma concentrations of VPN and 4-ene-VPN were in general lower when VPN was co-
administered with CBD. The MAH should elaborate on the proposed mechanism underlying this 
(e.g. if this is CYP- or UGT- mediated) and on the clinical importance of this result, herein a 
discussion of whether the efficacy of VPN may be diluted. 
7.  Plasma CLB and the metabolite N-CLB were both significantly increased when administered 
with CBD in the VPN arm. The MAH should elaborate on this result and discuss the reason why 
P-CLB was increased in the VPN-arm but not in the STP-arm when CLB was co-administered 
with CBD. Herein, the MAH should discuss the possible clinical importance of the findings.

8.  In general, PKPD modelling including test of co-variates an exposure-safety analysis would add 
valuable information to the study. The MAH should thoroughly consider to add this information 
to the planned variation to support the proposed amendment of the SmPC. 
Responses Request for supplementary information in terms of 
Post-Authorisation Measure Application P46 005 and 006 
Question 1:  
A total of 34 patients (14 patients in the STP and 20 patients in the VPA arm) were planned for 
randomization. However, no power calculation is presented. The MAH should therefore clarify and 
justify how the planned number of 34 patients was achieved and justify that the study is powered 
adequately.  
Response to Question 1 
Due to this study being a Phase II DDI study and having no efficacy components, there was no formal 
sample size calculation and thus no power requirements. 
However, for this study the key PK endpoints (effects of CBD on VPA and STP exposure) were 
adequately addressed by the sample size to accurately assess the impact of CBD on plasma exposure 
of STP and VPA. For example, even very modest effects identified (e.g. decrease in VPA AUCtau by 
16%) are demonstrated to be statistically significant. 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The Applicant has not provided any clarification for the planned number of 34 patients. It is 
acknowledged that the statistical significance of findings may be less relevant than the clinical 
interpretations of the findings. The study is expected to be adequate in sample size for a clinical 
conclusion.  
Conclusion 
Issue not pursued further.  
Question 2:  
The MAH should clarify whether the medicinal product was administered under fed- or fasting 
conditions in that food intake is known to significantly affect the exposure of CBD, and thus may bias 
the results of the present interaction study/ies.  
Response to Question 2 
Patients were instructed to be consistent in the timing of their food intake relative to dosing throughout 
the double-blind period; however, the exact timing of dosing in relation to meals was not recorded. 
The MAH believes that most patients are likely to have taken their CBD doses close to mealtimes (thus 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

predominantly dosed in the fed state) given the twice-daily dosing schedule necessitates 
administration close to breakfast and evening meals, and also the requirement to administer some 
concomitant AEDs with food (morning and evening). STP is instructed to be taken with food (SmPC) 
and the VPA SmPC also suggests taking with food may be useful in managing adverse events. The food 
effect studies (GWEP1544 and GWEP17076) provide evidence that the effect of food is consistent 
across dose and is only modestly affected by the meal composition. Furthermore, timing of meal 
relative to dosing (e.g. 30 min prior to dosing and immediately after dosing) also appear to have a 
similar and substantial impact on exposure (GWEP17076). 
The exposure of CBD observed in this study are consistent with dosing being largely close to mealtimes 
(Figure 1) if we compare to trough levels from Phase 1 studies where dosing with food was fully 
documented (e.g. GWEP17028; Table 1).

As the GWEP1447 study was performed in epilepsy patients, it is not possible to control all extrinsic 
factors and, furthermore, intrinsic factors tend to be quite heterogenous, thus, this study reflects 
realistic clinical outcomes. However, a definitive healthy-volunteer study was conducted to explore the 
effects of CBD on STP and VPA in the absence of any confounding extrinsic factors which resulted in 
very similar outcomes. Such definitive studies tend to be more sensitive as they are highly controlled 
and have more homogenous subjects. The basic conclusions of the healthy-volunteer study 
(GWEP1543) are the same for both STP and VPA (a small elevation in STP levels suggesting a minor 
interaction and little or no effect on VPA levels). It is a key part of the GWEP1543 study that subjects 
received CBD-OS doses shortly following a meal, and so this study can be confirmed as conducted 
under fully fed conditions. The concordance across the healthy-volunteer study with the patient study 
help validate the conclusions on interactions in patients. 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The exact timing in relation to food intake was not recorded, but the Applicant states that 
administration is expected to be in some relation to a meal as it was to be taken in the morning and in

the evening. While this may be in line with reality it cannot be confirmed. However, exposure of CBD is 
overall consistent with exposure previously seen when administered with food.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved  
Question 3:  
The MAH should justify that the sex of patient does not affect the PK of CBD. Furthermore, is should 
appear from the SmPC that the presented interaction study has only been performed in patients 
between 16 and 55 years of age, and that due to the complex metabolism of CBD it is difficult to 
extrapolate the results to other age groups, and in specific very young children.  
Response to Question 3 
There have been extensive investigations into the effect of sex on exposure during population PK 
analyses (GWPP16110, GWPP17003, GWPP17004, GWPP18097, GWPP19217). The outcome has been 
unequivocal and there is no evidence for an effect of sex on exposure to CBD or metabolites. 
Furthermore, there are no obvious reasons why a difference in exposure should be expected based on 
the known routes of clearance. In fact, the complex metabolic profile of CBD with many mechanisms 
being involved appears to provide exposures that are particularly robust across a wide range of 
demographic factors, suggesting various clearance mechanisms can compensate should one route be 
compromised in any individual. Indeed, this may also account for the lack of notable effects on CBD 
exposure by potent enzyme inhibitors (GWEP17075). Thus, there appears to be no significant effect of 
age, body size, metabolic phenotypes, BMI, body composition, renal function etc which suggests that 
in terms of exposure to CBD and DDIs affecting CBD might be expected to be similar across all age 
groups. Evidence from PK analysis in mainly patients (DS, LGS) do not contradict the data obtained in 
dedicated DDI studies. For one example, please see response to Q5 which discusses the complex 3-
way interaction between CLB, STP and CBD in DS patients which is aligned with the very limited data 
from this study (GWEP1447) where all 3 drugs are dosed together. Furthermore, DDIs mediated 
through liver enzymes inhibition can be extrapolated across certain age categories as the maturation of 
liver enzymes from the age of 1 year is generally considered essentially equivalent to that of adults. 
However, extrapolation to < 1year of age (CBD is currently not indicated for this age group in the 
SmPC) is less predictable and usually requires physiologically-based PK modelling and paediatric PK 
studies to be able to assess safe and effective dosing in these populations and understand the DDI 
liabilities with concomitant medications. 
In addition, it is typical practice to perform formal DDI studies in healthy adult volunteers as a 
surrogate for patients for the majority of scenarios. Some exceptions include cytotoxic agents, where 
there may be some risk to volunteers. It is often very challenging to perform DDI studies in patients 
due to the potential confounding effects of concomitant medications, comorbidities etc and in addition 
the variability is generally much greater in patients as they tend to be more heterogenous that 
subjects in a healthy-volunteer study, which can mask any DDIs. Thus, DDIs in healthy volunteers 
tend to be more sensitive. DDI studies for CBD with STP and VPA were already performed in healthy

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

adults (GWEP1543). In general, the data are well aligned between the studies in healthy volunteers 
and patients; that is, no substantial effect of CBD on VPA exposure and a small elevation in STP 
exposure were observed. The absolute values are slightly different but the magnitude of effect in 
general terms (weak, moderate or strong effects) are the same. Thus, taken together, no updates to 
the SmPC in terms of limitation of the DDI study outcome are considered applicable. 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
Sex has not been identified as a significant covariate for CBD PK.  
The metabolism of CBD is complex and several clearance mechanisms have been identified. This is 
further supported by the modest effect on CBD exposure when coadministered with potent inhibitors. 
The DDI study has been conducted in patients 16 to 55 years of age. It is agreed that DDI studies in 
healthy adult volunteers are considered sensitive and also relevant for the paediatric population > 1 
year of age where maturation of liver enzymes is approaching adult values. Therefore, the outcomes of 
study GWEP1447 are relevant for young children and elderly.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Question 4:  
STP plasma concentrations increased significantly when coadministered with CBD, confirming a 
pharmacokinetic D-D interaction. Therefore, close monitoring of the patient should be performed when 
the 2 drugs are administered simultaneously, herein monitoring of plasma concentrations of CBD and 
STP. This information should be clearly displayed in the SmPC. 
Response to Question 4 
The SmPC language with respect to the DDI between CBD and STP is proposed to be updated to 
include the new information from this study (proposed updates highlighted in yellow below). It is 
notable that the DDI observed in GWEP1447, although statistically significant, is actually a small effect 
and somewhat lower than that observed in the healthy-volunteer study (GWEP1543, as reflected in the 
current approved SmPC), thus the key messages within the SmPC remain unaltered. As discussed in 
responses above, healthy-volunteer studies are the best way to test most sensitively for DDIs. 
The overall PK interaction has been acknowledged being weak in nature during the MAA assessment 
based on data from healthy volunteers. The additional data from GWEP1447 in patients demonstrates 
less of an increase in exposure to STP. However, the Applicant agrees that it cannot be ruled out that 
there may be some clinically relevant effect in certain individuals and close monitoring of ADRs should 
be ensured. This is reflected in the current approved SmPC wording. 
Furthermore, monitoring of plasma concentrations is clearly displayed in the SmPC in terms of any 
concomitant AEDs in view of the complex PK of CBD as excerpted below.

When  cannabidiol  was  combined  with  stiripentol  in  a  healthy  volunteer  trial  there  was  an  increase  in 
stiripentol  levels  of  28%  for  maximum  measured  plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  and  55%  for  AUC.  In 
patients,  however,  the  effect  was  smaller,  with  an  increase  in  stiripentol  levels  of  17%  in  Cmax  and 
30%  in  AUC.  The  clinical  importance  of  these  results,  has  not  been  studied.The  patient  should  be 
closely monitored for adverse drug reactions. 
Excerpt of the SmPC interaction section 4.5 
Concomitant AED treatments 
The pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol are complex and may cause interactions with the patient’s 
concomitant AED treatments. Cannabidiol and/or concomitant AED treatment should therefore 
be adjusted during regular medical supervision and the patient should be closely monitored 
for adverse drug reactions. In addition, monitoring of plasma concentrations should be 
considered. 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The Applicant has updated the SmPC to reflect the study results. However, a revised text is proposed 
to replace the wording provided by the applicant:  
“When cannabidiol is given with stiripentol in healthy volunteers, stiripentol exposure increase by 28% 
and 55% for Cmax and AUC, respectively. In patients, however, the effect was smaller, with an 
increase in stiripentol levels of 17% in Cmax and 30% in AUC. Although stiripentol toxicity may rarely 
occur, patients should be monitored for related-adverse events.”. 
Close monitoring, including monitoring of plasma concentrations is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved provided the text is amended as stated above. 
Question 5:  
Results from the STP arm illustrated how the plasma concentrations of the CLB metabolite, N-CLB were 
significantly higher when CLB was coadministered with CBD. Therefore, closely monitoring of the 
patients and monitoring CLB and N-CLB levels is necessary for clinical care of patients. This information 
should be clearly displayed in the SmPC. 
Response to Question 5 
This study was not designed to evaluate the DDI between CBD and CLB. The DDI with CLB/N-CLB has 
been studied in detail elsewhere (GWEP1543, GWEP1428, GWEP17077) and suitable advice is given in 
SmPC when combining treatment of CBD with CLB. The information on N-CLB from GWEP1447 cannot 
be used to determine the magnitude or the significance of any DDI, in fact the information on CBD 
dosing on N-CLB in the STP arm comes from just 3 patients. In addition, the effect of CBD on N-CLB 
obtained from the VPA group is more marked in terms of fold change when compared with the STP arm

(see Figures below), but once again this information comes from only 3 individuals and is thus not 
greatly informative. The figures below (Figures 2 and 3) clearly show the impact of STP on N-CLB 
exposure as its baseline pre-CBD dosing (Day 1) levels are in the order of 10-fold higher in patients 
from the STP arm compared to those in the VPA arm. There is only a modest further elevation of N-
CLB when CBD is added to the STP arm by Day 26 (approx. 1.5-fold), whereas there is a > 4-fold 
increase in exposure to N-CLB when CBD is added to the VPA arm. This discrepancy between the arms 
is due to the well-known inhibitory effects of STP on N-CLB metabolism (via CYP2C19), a mechanism 
believed to be partly responsible for its therapeutic effect.

Notwithstanding, monitoring of plasma concentrations is clearly displayed in the SmPC in terms of any 
concomitant AEDs as excerpted above in terms of the response to Question number 4.  
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
It is acknowledged that even despite a significant increase in N-CLB when CLB is co-administered with 
either STP or VPA and CBD, then the results only reflect few patients and are inadequate for further 
specification of recommendations. It is recommended in the SmPC to monitor plasma concentrations 
when AEDs. Further monitoring of N-CLB would not be expected to provide additional information to 
the prescriber, where the bi-directional pharmacokinetic interactions between CBD and CLB is well 
described to contribute to the anticonvulsive effect.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Question 6:  
Plasma concentrations of VPN and 4-ene-VPN were in general lower when VPN was coadministered 
with CBD. The MAH should elaborate on the proposed mechanism underlying this (e.g. if this is CYP- or 
UGT- mediated) and on the clinical importance of this result, herein a discussion of whether the 
efficacy of VPN may be diluted. 
Response to Question 6 
While it is true that the levels of VPA and 4-ene-VPA appear to be a little lower on coadministration 
with CBD, we do not believe this is a clinically relevant effect (only ~16% for VPA AUC) and may be a 
chance finding. The magnitude of the impact does not reach the level recognized as representing even 
a weak effect in DDI studies (25 to 100 % increase in exposure). The level of the effect, even if it were 
a true measure of the magnitude and replicable, is very likely to be overshadowed by variability from

various other sources. In addition, the DDI between VPA and CBD was examined in a healthy-
volunteer study (GWEP1543) which looked in detail at the potential interaction in both directions. This 
study did not show any change in VPA exposure when given with CBD (Figure 4).

In vitro data indicate that CBD is capable of inhibiting both CYP2B6- and CYP2C9-mediated activity. 
These two CYP450 isoforms are involved in the metabolism of VPA to 4-ene-VPA, therefore, this may, 
in part, explain the decrease in 4-ene-VPA Cmax and AUCtau when VPA is coadministered with CBD. As 
4-ene-VPA is not an active metabolite, the slightly diminished exposure to this metabolite when VPA is 
combined with CBD would not be expected to affect efficacy. In fact, as this metabolite is a putative 
hepatotoxin, reduced levels may have some beneficial effects in patients. The decrease in VPA Cmax 
and AUCtau is much less pronounced and, if a real effect, may be the result of CBD having the 
potential to induce some UGT isoforms (CBD was shown in vitro to induce some enzymes presumed to 
be via activation of PXR) as VPA is readily glucuronidated.  
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The issue has been adequately addressed by the Applicant. CBD may have some induction potential on 
UGT isoforms. There are no indications clinical relevance when CBD is coadministered with VPA.

Question 7:  
Plasma CLB and the metabolite N-CLB were both significantly increased when administered with CBD in 
the VPA arm. The MAH should elaborate on this result and discuss the reason why N-CLB was 
increased in the VPA arm but not in the STP arm when CLB was coadministered with CBD. Herein, the 
MAH should discuss the possible clinical importance of the findings. 
Response to Question 7 
Firstly, it should be noted that this study was not designed to examine the effects of CBD on PK of CLB 
and N-CLB. This DDI has been extensively investigated in multiple studies, is well understood 
(GWEP1428, GWEP1543, GWEP17077) and relevant clinical guidance concerning dose adjustments and 
monitoring of ADRs / plasma concentrations provided in the SmPC. In GWEP1447, there were only 3 
patients post-CBD in either arm who provided data for CLB and N-CLB. Thus, any definitive conclusions 
cannot be made on these data about significance or magnitude of effects. The apparent impact of CBD 
on CLB between the 2 arms cannot sensibly be compared, and the studies detailed above should be 
considered for an understanding of the effect of CBD on CLB levels. 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The objective of the study was not to investigate the interaction between CBD and CLB including the 
effect on N-CLB exposure. The Applicant has not commented on the difference observed in the VPA 
and STP arm, but emphasises that the findings reflect very few patients. This is acknowledged.   
Conclusion 
Issue resolved. 
Question 8:  
In general, PKPD modelling including test of co-variates and exposure-safety analysis would add 
valuable information to the study. The MAH should thoroughly consider to add this information to the 
planned variation to support the proposed amendment of the SmPC. 
Response to Question 8 
Pooled population PK modelling has also explored safety exposure-response relationships for CBD. 
These have been reported elsewhere (see referenced population PK analyses in relation to Q3) and are 
based on the 2 pivotal LGS trials and have informed the SmPC (in section 5.2). Such exposure 
response for VPA and STP have not been developed but are unlikely to be of utility in the case of 
GWEP1447 due to the lack of clinically important changes in exposure on coadministration.  
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
The Applicant has not planned to explore data further with PKPD modelling. This is noted.

5.  Overall conclusion 
The MAH has submitted a synoptic CSR and a clinical for the Study GWEP1447 (Double-blind 
Phase and long-term extended) in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006 as subjects 
< 18 years have been included. A variation (type II-008G) has been submitted in parallel. Minor 
changes to the SmPC as a result of the studies is anticipated. 
 PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled), provided the MAH implement the 
proposed alternative SmPC wording.

Missed doses 
If the patient misses a dose of Biktarvy within 18 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient 
should take Biktarvy as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule.  If a patient misses a 
dose of Biktarvy by more than 18 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply 
resume the usual dosing schedule. 
If the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Biktarvy another tablet should be taken.  If a patient 
vomits more than 1 hour after taking Biktarvy they do not need to take another dose of Biktarvy until 
the next regularly scheduled dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in patients aged ≥ 65 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.  Biktarvy has not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore Biktarvy is not recommended for use in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in patients weighing ≥ 35 kg with estimated creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min. 
No dose adjustment of Biktarvy is required in adult patients with end stage renal disease (estimated 
creatinine clearance < 15 mL/minute) who are receiving chronic haemodialysis.  However, Biktarvy 
should generally be avoided and only be used in these patients if the potential benefits are considered 
to outweigh the potential risks (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  On days of haemodialysis, Biktarvy should 
be administered after completion of haemodialysis treatment. 
Initiation of Biktarvy should be avoided in patients with estimated creatinine clearance ≥15 mL/min 
and < 30 mL/min, or < 15 mL/min who are not receiving chronic haemodialysis, as the safety of 
Biktarvy has not been established in these populations (see section 5.2). 
No data are available to make dose recommendations in patients weighing < 35 kg with renal 
impairment or in paediatric patients less than 18 years with end stage renal disease. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Biktarvy in children less than 2 years of age or weighing less than 14 kg 
have not yet been established.  No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Biktarvy can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
Due to the bitter taste, it is recommended that the film-coated tablets should not be chewed or crushed.  
For patients who are unable to swallow the tablet whole, the tablet may be split in half and both halves 
taken one after the other, ensuring that the full dose is taken immediately. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration with rifampicin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (see section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B or C virus 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for 
severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. 
There are limited safety and efficacy data for Biktarvy in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV).  
Biktarvy contains tenofovir alafenamide, which is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV). 
Discontinuation of Biktarvy therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated 
with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis.  Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue 
Biktarvy should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several 
months after stopping treatment. 
Liver disease 
The safety and efficacy of Biktarvy in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not 
been established. 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and 
should be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in 
such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle.  For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these 
have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders 
(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological 
disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such 
neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be 
considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical 
findings of unknown aetiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current 
national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include 
cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
jirovecii pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when 
necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Opportunistic infections 
Patients should be advised that Biktarvy or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure 
HIV infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of 
HIV infection.  Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians 
experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Post-marketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure and proximal renal 
tubulopathy have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide-containing products.  A potential risk of 
nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to dosing with tenofovir 
alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). 
It is recommended that renal function is assessed in all patients prior to, or when initiating, therapy 
with Biktarvy and that it is also monitored during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate.  In 
patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function, or evidence of proximal renal 
tubulopathy, discontinuation of Biktarvy should be considered. 
Patients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis 
Biktarvy should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease 
(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the 
potential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination 
with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected adults 
with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was 
maintained through 96 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with 
normal renal function.  Efficacy was also maintained in the extension phase of the study in which 10 
patients switched to Biktarvy for 48 weeks.  Although no additional adverse reactions were identified, 
the implications of increased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Biktarvy should not be co-administered simultaneously with magnesium/aluminium-containing 
antacids or iron supplements under fasted conditions.  Biktarvy should be administered at least 2 hours 
before, or with food 2 hours after antacids containing magnesium and/or aluminium.  Biktarvy should 
be administered at least 2 hours before iron supplements, or taken together with food (see section 4.5). 
Some medicinal products are not recommended for co-administration with Biktarvy: atazanavir, 
carbamazepine, ciclosporin (IV or oral use), oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, 
rifapentine, or sucralfate.

Biktarvy should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
Paediatric population 
Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD ≥ 4%) of the spine and total body less head (TBLH) have 
been reported in patients aged between 3 to < 12 years who received tenofovir alafenamide-containing 
products for 48 weeks (see section 4.8).  The long-term effects of changes in BMD on the growing 
bone, including the risk of fracture, are uncertain.  A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to 
decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment. 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Biktarvy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir 
alafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment of 
HBV infection. 
Bictegravir 
Bictegravir is a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1.  Co-administration of bictegravir and medicinal 
products that potently induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1, such as rifampicin or St. John’s wort, may 
significantly decrease plasma concentrations of bictegravir, which may result in a loss of therapeutic 
effect of Biktarvy and development of resistance, therefore co-administration is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  Co-administration of bictegravir with medicinal products that potently inhibit both 
CYP3A and UGT1A1, such as atazanavir, may significantly increase plasma concentrations of 
bictegravir, therefore co-administration is not recommended.  
Bictegravir is both a P-gp and a BCRP substrate.  The clinical relevance of this feature is not 
established.  Therefore, caution is recommended when bictegravir is combined with medicinal 
products known to inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP (e.g. macrolides, ciclosporin, verapamil, dronedarone, 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) (see also table below). 
Bictegravir inhibits organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion 
transporter 1 (MATE1) in vitro.  Co-administration of Biktarvy with the OCT2 and MATE1 substrate 
metformin did not result in a clinically significant increase in metformin exposure.  Biktarvy may be 
co-administered with substrates of OCT2 and MATE1.  
Bictegravir is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP in vivo. 
Emtricitabine 
In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for 
CYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  
Co-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular 
secretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  
Medicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. 
Tenofovir alafenamide 
Tenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP).  Co-administration of Biktarvy with medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption.  Medicinal products that induce 
P-gp activity (e.g. rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of 
tenofovir alafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which 
may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Biktarvy and development of resistance.  Co-administration of 
Biktarvy with other medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and 
plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo.

4  This study was conducted using emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 200/25 mg once daily. 
5  Maximum strength antacid contained 80 mg aluminium hydroxide, 80 mg magnesium hydroxide, and 8 mg 
simethicone per mL. 
6  This study was conducted using elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 150/150/200/10 mg once

Based on drug interaction studies conducted with Biktarvy or the components of Biktarvy, no 
clinically significant drug interactions are expected with: amlodipine, atorvastatin, buprenorphine, 
drospirenone, famciclovir, famotidine, fluticasone, methadone, naloxone, norbuprenorphine, 
omeprazole or rosuvastatin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of bictegravir or 
tenofovir alafenamide in pregnant women.  A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 
1,000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with 
emtricitabine. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of emtricitabine with respect to 
fertility parameters, pregnancy, foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.  Studies of 
bictegravir and tenofovir alafenamide, administered separately, in animals have shown no evidence of 
harmful effects on fertility parameters, pregnancy, or foetal development (see section 5.3). 
Biktarvy should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to 
the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether bictegravir or tenofovir alafenamide is excreted in human milk.  Emtricitabine 
is excreted in human milk.  In animal studies, bictegravir was detected in the plasma of nursing rat 
pups likely due to the presence of bictegravir in milk, without effects on nursing pups.  In animal 
studies it has been shown that tenofovir is excreted in milk.   
There is insufficient information on the effects of all the components of Biktarvy in newborns/infants, 
therefore Biktarvy should not be used during breast-feeding. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of Biktarvy on fertility are available.  Animal studies indicate no effects 
of bictegravir, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide on mating or fertility (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Biktarvy may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Patients should be 
informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with the components of Biktarvy (see 
section 4.8).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
  In clinical studies of treatment-naïve patients receiving Biktarvy, the most frequently reported 
adverse reactions in the double-blind phase (Week 144) were headache (5%), diarrhoea (5%) and 
nausea (4%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The assessment of adverse reactions is based on safety data from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies with 
Biktarvy and from post-marketing experience.  The adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed by system 
organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as follows: common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) 
uncommon (≥ 1/1.000 to < 1/100) and rare (≥ 1/10.000 to < 1/1.000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see 
section 4.4).

Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune 
disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the 
reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of 
treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown 
(see section 4.4). 
Changes in serum creatinine 
Bictegravir has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of 
creatinine, however these changes are not considered to be clinically relevant since they do not reflect 
a change in glomerular filtration rate.  Increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 4 of treatment 
and remained stable through Week 144.  In Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, median 
(Q1, Q3) serum creatinine increased by 0.11 (0.03, 0.19) mg/dL (9.7 [2.7, 16.8] µmol/L), 
0.11 (0.04, 0.19) mg/dL (9.7 [3.5, 16.8] µmol/L), and 0.12 (0.06, 0.21) mg/dL 
(10.6 [5.3, 18.6] μmol/L) from baseline to Week 144 in the Biktarvy, 
abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide groups, 
respectively.  There were no discontinuations due to renal adverse reactions through Week 144 in 
patients administered Biktarvy in clinical studies. 
Changes in bilirubin 
In Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, total bilirubin increases were observed in 17% of 
treatment-naïve patients administered Biktarvy through Week 144.  Increases were primarily Grade 1 
(12%) and Grade 2 (4%) (≥1.0 to 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal [ULN]), and were not associated with 
hepatic adverse reactions or other liver related laboratory abnormalities.  Five patients administered 
Biktarvy (1%) had grade 3 bilirubin increases that were not considered related to study drug.  There 
were no discontinuations due to hepatic adverse reactions through Week 144 in Biktarvy clinical 
studies. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of Biktarvy was evaluated in 50 HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and 
weighing ≥ 35 kg through Week 96 (48-week main phase and 48-week extension), in 50 children aged 
6 to < 12 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg through Week 96 (48-week main phase and 48-week extension), 
and in 22 children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg through Week 24 in an open-label 
clinical study (GS-US-380-1474).  In this study, no new adverse reactions have been observed in 
paediatric subjects aged 2 years and older living with HIV-1 as compared to adult subjects living with 
HIV-1.  Bone mineral density data were not collected in this study.  Reductions in BMD of the spine 
and of the TBLH ≥ 4% have been reported in paediatric patients receiving other tenofovir alafenamide 
containing products for 48 weeks (see section 4.4).  
Other special populations 
Patients co-infected with hepatitis B 
In 16 HIV/HBV co-infected adults administered Biktarvy (8 HIV/HBV treatment-naïve adults in 
Study GS-US-380-1490; 8 HIV/HBV suppressed adults in Study GS-US-380-1878), the safety profile 
of Biktarvy was similar to that in patients with HIV-1 monoinfection (see section 5.1). 
Elderly 
Studies GS-US-380-1844, GS-US-380-1878 and the dedicated Study GS-US-380-4449 in patients 
≥ 65 years old (evaluation of 86 HIV-1 infected, virologically-suppressed subjects ≥ 65 years old) 
included 111 patients aged ≥ 65 years who received Biktarvy.  In these patients, no differences in the 
safety profile of Biktarvy were observed.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with renal impairment 
The safety of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated in a single arm, open-label clinical 
study (GS-US-292-1825), in which 55 virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected patients with end stage 
renal disease (eGFRCG < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis received emtricitabine + tenofovir 
alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet for 96 
weeks. In an extension phase of Study GS-US-292-1825, 10 patients switched to Biktarvy for 48 
weeks. No additional adverse reactions were identified in patients with end stage renal disease on 
chronic haemodialysis in this study (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.  
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8).  Treatment 
of overdose with Biktarvy consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs 
as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with Biktarvy.  As bictegravir is highly bound to plasma 
proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  
Emtricitabine can be removed by haemodialysis, which removes approximately 30% of the 
emtricitabine dose over a 3-hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing.  
Tenofovir is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 
54%.  It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations, ATC code: J05AR20 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Bictegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that binds to the integrase active site and 
blocks the strand transfer step of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential 
for the HIV replication cycle.  Bictegravir has activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2. 
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and analogue of 2’-deoxycytidine.  
Emtricitabine is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate.  Emtricitabine 
triphosphate inhibits HIV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV reverse 
transcriptase (RT), which results in DNA chain-termination.  Emtricitabine has activity against HIV-1, 
HIV-2 and HBV. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) and phosphonamidate 
prodrug of tenofovir (2’-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).  Tenofovir alafenamide is 
permeable into cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation through 
hydrolysis by cathepsin A, tenofovir alafenamide is more efficient than tenofovir disoproxil in loading 
tenofovir into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (including lymphocytes and other HIV 
target cells) and macrophages.  Intracellular tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated to the 
pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate.  Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV RT, which results in DNA chain-
termination.  Tenofovir has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV.   
Antiviral activity in vitro 
The antiviral activity of bictegravir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, and CD4+ T-lymphocytes.  
The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for bictegravir were in the range of < 0.05 to 6.6 nM.  
The protein-adjusted EC95 of bictegravir was 361 nM (0.162 µg/mL) for wild type HIV-1 virus.  
Bictegravir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 group (M, N, O), including 
subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from < 0.05 to 1.71 nM), and activity against 
HIV-2 (EC50 = 1.1 nM). 
The antiviral activity of emtricitabine against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI CCR5 cell line, and PBMCs.  The EC50 values for emtricitabine 
were in the range of 0.0013 to 0.64 µM.  Emtricitabine displayed antiviral activity in cell culture 
against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 0.075 µM) and 
showed activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.007 to 1.5 µM). 
The antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 
subtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, PBMCs, primary monocyte/macrophage cells, 
and CD4+ T-lymphocytes.  The EC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide were in the range of 2.0 to 
14.7 nM.  Tenofovir alafenamide displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV-1 groups 
(M, N, O), including subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC50 values ranged from 0.10 to 12.0 nM) and 
activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 0.91 to 2.63 nM). 
Resistance 
In vitro 
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to bictegravir have been selected in cell culture.  In one 
selection, amino acid substitutions M50I and R263K emerged and phenotypic susceptibility to 
bictegravir was reduced 1.3-, 2.2-, and 2.9-fold for M50I, R263K, and M50I + R263K, respectively.  
In a second selection, amino acid substitutions T66I and S153F emerged and phenotypic susceptibility 
to bictegravir was shifted 0.4-, 1.9-, and 0.5-fold for T66I, S153F, and T66I + S153F, respectively. 
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine have been selected in cell culture and had 
M184V/I mutations in HIV-1 RT. 
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide have been selected in cell culture 
and had the K65R mutation in HIV-1 RT; in addition, a K70E mutation in HIV-1 RT has been 
transiently observed.  HIV-1 isolates with the K65R mutation have low level reduced susceptibility to 
abacavir, emtricitabine, tenofovir, and lamivudine.  In vitro drug resistance selection studies with 
tenofovir alafenamide have shown no development of high-level resistance after extended culture. 
In vivo 
In treatment-naïve patients (Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490), through Week 144 of 
the double-blind phase or 96 weeks of the open-label extension phase, no patient receiving Biktarvy, 
with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL at the time of confirmed virologic failure or early study drug 
discontinuation, had HIV-1 with treatment-emergent genotypic or phenotypic resistance to bictegravir, 
emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide in the final resistance analysis population (n = 11 with data).  
At the time of study entry, one treatment-naïve patient had pre-existing INSTI resistance-associated 
mutations Q148H + G140S and had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 4 through Week 144. In 
addition, 6 patients had the pre-existing INSTI resistance-associated mutation T97A; all had HIV-1 
RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 144 or the last visit. 
In virologically-suppressed patients (Studies GS-US-380-1844 and GS-US-380-1878), no patients 
receiving Biktarvy, with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL at the time of confirmed virologic failure, 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Week 48, or early study drug discontinuation, had HIV-1 with treatment-emergent genotypic or 
phenotypic resistance to bictegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide in the final resistance 
analysis population (n = 2). 
Cross-resistance  
The susceptibility of bictegravir was tested against 64 INSTI-resistant clinical isolates (20 with single 
substitutions and 44 with 2 or more substitutions).  Of these, all single and double mutant isolates 
lacking Q148H/K/R and 10 of 24 isolates with Q148H/K/R with additional INSTI resistance 
associated substitutions had ≤ 2.5-fold reduced susceptibility to bictegravir; > 2.5-fold reduced 
susceptibility to bictegravir was found for 14 of the 24 isolates that contained G140A/C/S and 
Q148H/R/K substitutions in integrase.  Of those, 9 of the 14 isolates had additional mutations at 
L74M, T97A, or E138A/K.  In a separate study, site-directed mutants with G118R and T97A+G118R 
had 3.4- and 2.8-fold reduced susceptibility to bictegravir, respectively.  The relevance of these 
in vitro cross-resistance data remains to be established in clinical practice. 
Bictegravir demonstrated equivalent antiviral activity against 5 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistant, 3 NRTI-resistant, and 4 protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant HIV-1 mutant 
clones compared with the wild-type strain. 
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I substitution were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but 
retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zidovudine.   
The K65R and K70E mutations result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, 
emtricitabine, and tenofovir, but retain sensitivity to zidovudine.  Multinucleoside resistant HIV-1 
with a T69S double insertion mutation or with a Q151M mutation complex including K65R showed 
reduced susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide.   
Clinical data 
The efficacy and safety of Biktarvy in HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve adults are based on 48-week 
and 144-week data from two randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies, GS-US-380-1489 
(n = 629) and GS-US-380-1490 (n = 645).  Furthermore, additional efficacy and safety data are 
available from adults who received open-label Biktarvy for an additional 96 weeks after Week 144 in 
an optional extension phase of these studies (n = 1025). 
The efficacy and safety of Biktarvy in virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected adults are based on 
48-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study, GS-US-380-1844 (n = 563); 
and a randomised, open-label, active-controlled study, GS-US-380-1878 (n = 577). 
HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve patients 
In Study GS-US-380-1489, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) (n = 314) or 
abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (600/50/300 mg) (n = 315) once daily.  In Study GS-US-380-1490, 
patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either B/F/TAF (n = 320) or 
dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (50+200/25 mg) (n = 325) once daily. 
In Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, the mean age was 35 years (range 18-77), 89% 
were male, 58% were White, 33% were Black, and 3% were Asian.  Twenty-four percent (24%) of 
patients identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The prevalence of different subtypes was comparable across all 
three treatment groups, with subtype B predominant in both groups; 11% were non-B subtypes.  The 
mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.4 log10 copies/mL (range 1.3-6.6).  The mean baseline CD4+ 
cell count was 460 cells/mm3 (range 0-1,636) and 11% had CD4+ cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3.  
Eighteen percent of patients had baseline viral loads greater than 100,000 copies/mL.  In both studies, 
patients were stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA (less than or equal to 100,000 copies/mL, greater than 
100,000 copies/mL to less than or equal to 400,000 copies/mL, or greater than 400,000 copies/mL), by 
CD4+ cell count (less than 50 cells/µL, 50-199 cells/µL, or greater than or equal to 200 cells/µL), and 
by region (US or ex-US).

B/F/TAF was non-inferior in achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at both Weeks 48 and 144 when 
compared to abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine and to dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide, respectively.  Treatment outcomes between treatment groups were similar across 
subgroups by age, sex, race, baseline viral load, baseline CD4+ cell count, and region. 
In Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell 
count at Week 144 was 288, 317, and 289 cells/mm3 in the pooled B/F/TAF, 
abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide groups, 
respectively. 
In the optional 96 week open-label extension phase of Studies GS-US-380-1489 
and GS-US-380-1490, high rates of virologic suppression were achieved and maintained. 
HIV-1 infected, virologically -suppressed patients 
In Study GS-US-380-1844, the efficacy and safety of switching from a regimen of 
dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine or abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine to B/F/TAF were evaluated in 
a randomised, double-blind study of virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) HIV-1 
infected adults (n = 563).  Patients must have been stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on 
their baseline regimen for at least 3 months prior to study entry.  Patients were randomised in a 1:1 
ratio to either switch to B/F/TAF at baseline (n = 282), or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen 
(n = 281).  Patients had a mean age of 45 years (range 20-71), 89% were male, 73% were White, and 
22% were Black.  Seventeen percent (17%) of patients identified as Hispanic/Latino.  The prevalence 
of different HIV-1 subtypes was comparable between treatment groups, with subtype B predominant 
in both groups; 5% were non-B subtypes.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 723 cells/mm3 
(range 124-2,444).  
In Study GS-US-380-1878, the efficacy and safety of switching from either abacavir/lamivudine or 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (200/300 mg) plus atazanavir or darunavir (boosted by 
either cobicistat or ritonavir) to B/F/TAF were evaluated in a randomised, open-label study of 
virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected adults (n = 577).  Patients must have been stably suppressed 
on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months and must not have been previously treated with any 
INSTI.  Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either switch to B/F/TAF (n = 290), or stay on their 
baseline antiretroviral regimen (n = 287).  Patients had a mean age of 46 years (range 20-79), 83% 
were male, 66% were White, and 26% were Black.  Nineteen percent (19%) of patients identified as 
Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 663 cells/mm3 (range 62-2,582).  The 
prevalence of different subtypes was comparable across treatment groups, with subtype B predominant 
in both groups; 11% were non-B subtypes.  Patients were stratified by prior treatment regimen.  At 
screening, 15% of patients were receiving abacavir/lamivudine plus atazanavir or darunavir (boosted 
by either cobicistat or ritonavir) and 85% of patients were receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate plus atazanavir or darunavir (boosted by either cobicistat or ritonavir).

B/F/TAF was non-inferior to the control regimen in both studies.  Treatment outcomes between 
treatment groups were similar across subgroups by age, sex, race, and region. 
In GS-US-380-1844, the mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 
-31 cells/mm3 in patients who switched to B/F/TAF and 4 cells/mm3 in patients who stayed on 
abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine.  In GS-US-380-1878, the mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell 
count at Week 48 was 25 cells/mm3 in patients who switched to B/F/TAF and 0 cells/mm3 in patients 
who stayed on their baseline regimen. 
Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV 
The number of patients co-infected with HIV and HBV treated with B/F/TAF is limited.  In 
Study GS-US-380-1490, 8 patients with HIV/HBV co-infection at baseline were randomised to 
receive B/F/TAF. At Week 48, 7 patients were HBV suppressed (HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL) and had 
HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL.  One patient had missing HBV DNA data at Week 48.  At Week 144, 5 
patients were HBV suppressed and had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL.  Three patients had missing 
HBV DNA data at Week 144 (1 lost to follow-up from Week 48, 1 lost to follow-up after Week 72, 
and 1 lost to follow-up after Week 120). 
In Study GS-US-380-1878, at Week 48, 100% (8/8) of the patients co-infected with HIV/HBV at 
baseline in the B/F/TAF arm maintained HBV DNA < 29 IU/mL (missing = excluded analysis) and 
HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL. 
Paediatric population 
In Study GS-US-380-1474, the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF in 
virologically-suppressed children and adolescents with HIV between the ages of 12 to < 18 years 
(≥ 35 kg) (n = 50), between the ages of 6 to < 12 years (≥ 25 kg) (n = 50), and ≥ 2 years of age (≥ 14 
to < 25 kg) (n = 22) were evaluated. 
Cohort 1: Virologically-suppressed adolescents (n = 50; 12 to < 18 years; ≥ 35 kg)  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients in Cohort 1 had a mean age of 14 years (range: 12 to 17) and a mean baseline weight of 
51.7 kg (range: 35 to 123), 64% were female, 27% were Asian, and 65% were Black.  At baseline, 
median CD4+ cell count was 750 cells/mm3 (range: 337 to 1207), and median CD4+% was 33% 
(range: 19% to 45%). 
After switching to B/F/TAF, 98% (49/50) of patients in Cohort 1 remained suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies/mL) at Week 48.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 
-22 cells/mm3.  Two of 50 subjects met the criteria for inclusion in the resistance analysis population 
through Week 48.  No emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected through Week 48. 
Cohort 2: Virologically-suppressed children (n = 50; 6 to < 12 years; ≥ 25 kg)  
Patients in Cohort 2 had a mean age of 10 years (range: 6 to 11) and a mean baseline weight of 31.9 kg 
(range: 25 to 69), 54% were female, 22% were Asian and 72% were Black.  At baseline, median 
CD4+ cell count was 898 cells/mm3 (range 390 to 1991) and median CD4+% was 37% (range: 19% to 
53%). 
After switching to B/F/TAF, 98% (49/50) of patients in Cohort 2 remained suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies/mL) at Week 48.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was 
-40 cells/mm3.  No patient qualified for resistance analysis through Week 48. 
Cohort 3: Virologically-suppressed children (n = 22; ≥ 2 years; ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg)  
Patients in Cohort 3 had a mean age of 5 years (range: 3 to 9) and a mean baseline weight of 18.8 kg 
(range: 14 to 24), 50% were female, 23% were Asian and 73% were Black.  At baseline, median 
CD4+ cell count was 962 cells/mm3 (range 365 to 1986) and median CD4+% was 32% (range: 24% to 
46%). 
After switching to B/F/TAF, 91% (20/22) of patients in Cohort 3 remained suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
< 50 copies/mL) at Week 24.  The mean change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 24 was 
−126 cells/mm3, and the mean change in CD4+% from baseline to Week 24 was 0.2% (range: -7.7% 
to 7.5%).  No patient qualified for resistance analysis through Week 24. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Biktarvy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of human 
HIV-1 infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Bictegravir is absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 
2.0-4.0 hours after administration of B/F/TAF.  Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of 
B/F/TAF with either a moderate fat (~600 kcal, 27% fat) or high fat meal (~800 kcal, 50% fat) 
resulted in an increase in bictegravir AUC (24%).  This modest change is not considered clinically 
meaningful and B/F/TAF can be administered with or without food. 
Following oral administration of B/F/TAF with or without food in HIV-1 infected adults, the multiple 
dose mean (CV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of bictegravir were Cmax = 6.15 µg/mL (22.9%), 
AUCtau = 102 µg•h/mL (26.9%), and Ctrough = 2.61 µg/mL (35.2%). 
Emtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma 
concentrations occurring at 1.5-2.0 hours after administration of B/F/TAF.  The mean absolute 
bioavailability of emtricitabine from 200 mg hard capsules was 93%.  Emtricitabine systemic exposure 
was unaffected when emtricitabine was administered with food and B/F/TAF can be administered with 
or without food. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following oral administration of B/F/TAF with or without food in HIV-1 infected adults, the multiple 
dose mean (CV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of emtricitabine were Cmax = 2.13 µg/mL (34.7%), 
AUCtau = 12.3 µg•h/mL (29.2%), and Ctrough = 0.096 µg/mL (37.4%). 
Tenofovir alafenamide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with peak plasma 
concentrations occurring at 0.5-2.0 hours after administration of B/F/TAF.  Relative to fasting 
conditions, the administration of tenofovir alafenamide with a moderate fat meal (~600 kcal, 27% fat) 
and a high fat meal (~800 kcal, 50% fat) resulted in an increase in AUClast by 48% and 63%, 
respectively.  These modest changes are not considered clinically meaningful and B/F/TAF can be 
administered with or without food.  
Following oral administration of B/F/TAF with or without food in HIV-1 infected adults, the multiple 
dose mean (CV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir alafenamide were Cmax = 0.121 µg/mL 
(15.4%), and AUCtau = 0.142 µg•h/mL (17.3%). 
Distribution 
In vitro binding of bictegravir to human plasma proteins was > 99% (free fraction ~0.25%).  The 
in vitro human blood to plasma bictegravir concentration ratio was 0.64. 
In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of 
concentration over the range of 0.02 to 200 µg/mL.  At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to 
blood emtricitabine concentration ratio was ~1.0 and the mean semen to plasma emtricitabine 
concentration ratio was ~4.0. 
In vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7% and is independent of concentration 
over the range of 0.01-25 µg/mL.  Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins 
in samples collected during clinical studies was approximately 80%.   
Biotransformation 
Metabolism is the major clearance pathway for bictegravir in humans.  In vitro phenotyping studies 
showed that bictegravir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A and UGT1A1.  Following a single dose 
oral administration of [14C]-bictegravir, ~60% of the dose from faeces included unchanged parent, 
desfluoro-hydroxy-BIC-cysteine-conjugate, and other minor oxidative metabolites.  Thirty-five 
percent of the dose was recovered from urine and consisted primarily of the glucuronide of bictegravir 
and other minor oxidative metabolites and their phase II conjugates.  Renal clearance of the unchanged 
parent was minimal. 
Following administration of [14C]-emtricitabine, complete recovery of the emtricitabine dose was 
achieved in urine (~86%) and faeces (~14%).  Thirteen percent of the dose was recovered in the urine 
as three putative metabolites.  The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of the thiol 
moiety to form the 3’-sulfoxide diastereomers (~9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to 
form 2’-O-glucuronide (~4% of dose).  No other metabolites were identifiable. 
Metabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for 
> 80% of an oral dose.  In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to 
tenofovir (major metabolite) by cathepsin A in PBMCs (including lymphocytes and other HIV target 
cells) and macrophages; and by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes.  In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is 
hydrolysed within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active 
metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate.  In human clinical studies, a 25 mg oral dose of tenofovir 
alafenamide resulted in tenofovir diphosphate concentrations > 4-fold higher in PBMCs and > 90% 
lower concentrations of tenofovir in plasma as compared to a 245 mg oral dose of tenofovir disoproxil. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Bictegravir is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism.  Renal excretion of intact bictegravir is a 
minor pathway (~1% of dose).  The plasma bictegravir half-life was 17.3 hours.  
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active tubular 
secretion.  The plasma emtricitabine half-life was approximately 10 hours. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir.  Tenofovir alafenamide and 
tenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively.  Tenofovir is 
eliminated by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.  Renal excretion 
of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with less than 1% of the dose eliminated in urine.   
Linearity 
The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of bictegravir are dose proportional over the dose range of 25 to 
100 mg.  The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are dose proportional over the dose 
range of 25 to 200 mg.  Tenofovir alafenamide exposures are dose proportional over the dose range of 
8 mg to 125 mg. 
Other special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of bictegravir were not observed in subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment.  The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in 
subjects with hepatic impairment; however, emtricitabine is not significantly metabolised by liver 
enzymes, so the impact of liver impairment should be limited.  Clinically relevant changes in the 
pharmacokinetics of tenofovir alafenamide or its metabolite tenofovir were not observed in patients 
with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment: 
Severe Renal Impairment (estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 15 and < 30 mL/minute) 
No clinically relevant differences in bictegravir, tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir pharmacokinetics 
were observed between healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated 
CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min) in Phase 1 Studies.  In a separate Phase 1 study of emtricitabine 
alone, mean systemic emtricitabine exposure was higher in patients with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min) (33.7 µg•h/mL) than in subjects with normal renal function (11.8 µg•h/mL).  The 
safety of Biktarvy has not been established in subjects with estimated creatinine 
clearance ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min. 
End Stage Renal Disease (estimated creatinine clearance < 15 mL/minute) 
Exposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir in 12 patients with end stage renal disease (estimated 
CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis who received emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in 
combination with elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed dose combination tablet in Study GS-US-292-
1825 were significantly higher than in patients with normal renal function.  No clinically relevant 
differences in tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with end stage renal 
disease on chronic haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal function.  In the extension 
phase of Study GS-US-292-1825, lower bictegravir Ctrough was observed in patients with end stage 
renal disease who received Biktarvy compared to patients with normal renal function, but this 
difference was not considered clinically relevant.  No additional adverse reactions were identified in 
patients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis in this study (see section 4.8). 
There are no pharmacokinetic data on bictegravir, emtricitabine or tenofovir alafenamide in patients 
with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) not on chronic haemodialysis.  The safety 
of Biktarvy has not been established in these patients.

Age, gender and race 
Pharmacokinetics of bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir have not been fully evaluated in the 
elderly (≥ 65 years of age).  Population analyses using pooled pharmacokinetic data from adult studies 
did not identify any clinically relevant differences due to age, gender or race on the exposures of 
bictegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. 
Paediatric population  
Mean bictegravir Cmax, and exposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (AUC and/or Cmax), 
achieved in 50 children between the ages of 6 to < 12 years (≥ 25 kg) who received the 
50 mg/200 mg/25 mg dose of B/F/TAF and in 22 children ≥ 2 years of age (≥ 14 to < 25 kg) who 
received the 30 mg/120 mg/15 mg dose of B/F/TAF, in Study GS-US-380-1474 were generally higher 
than exposures in adults.  The exposures of bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide and 
tenofovir in children, adolescents, and adults are presented in Table 5.

Bictegravir was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. 
Bictegravir was not carcinogenic in a 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse study (at doses of up to 
100 mg/kg/day in males and 300 mg/kg/day in females, which resulted in exposures of approximately 
15 and 23 times, in males and females, respectively, the exposure in humans at the recommended 
human dose) nor in a 2-year rat study (at doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day, which resulted in exposures of 
approximately 31 times the exposure in humans).  
Studies of bictegravir in monkeys revealed the liver as the primary target organ of toxicity.  
Hepatobiliary toxicity was described in a 39-week study at a dosage of 1,000 mg/kg/day, which 
resulted in exposures of approximately 16 times the exposure in humans at the recommended human 
dose, and was partially reversible after a 4-week recovery period.  
Studies in animals with bictegravir have shown no evidence of teratogenicity or an effect on 
reproductive function.  In offspring from rat and rabbit dams treated with bictegravir during 
pregnancy, there were no toxicologically significant effects on developmental endpoints. 
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies 
of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to 
reproduction and development.  Emtricitabine has demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in mice 
and rats. 
Non-clinical studies of tenofovir alafenamide in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary 
target organs of toxicity.  Bone toxicity was observed as reduced bone mineral density in rats and dogs 
at tenofovir exposures at least 43 times greater than those expected after administration of B/F/TAF.  
A minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and 
tenofovir exposures of approximately 14 and 43 times greater, respectively, than those expected after 
administration of B/F/TAF. 
Tenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. 
Because there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after the administration of tenofovir 
alafenamide compared to tenofovir disoproxil, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-postnatal study 
were conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil.  No special hazard for humans was revealed in 
conventional studies of carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development.  
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or 
foetal parameters.  However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a 
peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Biktarvy is and what it is used for 
Biktarvy contains three active substances: 
• 
• 
bictegravir, an antiretroviral medicine known as an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) 
emtricitabine, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NRTI) 
tenofovir alafenamide, an antiretroviral medicine of a type known as a nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) 
• 
Biktarvy is a single tablet for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults, adolescents and children 2 years of age and older, who weigh at least 14 kg. 
Biktarvy reduces the amount of HIV in your body.  This will improve your immune system and reduce 
the risk of developing illnesses linked to HIV infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Biktarvy 
Do not take Biktarvy 
• 
• 
If you are allergic to bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: 
- 
- 
rifampicin used to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis 
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal remedy used for depression and 
anxiety, or products that contain it. 
→ If any of these apply to you, do not take Biktarvy and tell your doctor immediately. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Biktarvy: 
• 
• 
If you have liver problems or a history of liver disease, including hepatitis.  Patients with 
liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with antiretrovirals, have a 
higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications.  If you have hepatitis B infection, 
your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. 
If you have hepatitis B infection.  Liver problems may become worse after you stop taking 
Biktarvy.  
→ Do not stop taking Biktarvy if you have hepatitis B.  Talk to your doctor first.  For more details, see 
section 3, Do not stop taking Biktarvy. 
• 
If you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown problems with your kidneys.  Your 
doctor may order blood tests to monitor how your kidneys work when starting and during 
treatment with Biktarvy. 
While you are taking Biktarvy 
Once you start taking Biktarvy, look out for: 
• 
• 
Signs of inflammation or infection 
Joint pain, stiffness or bone problems 
→ If you notice any of these symptoms, tell your doctor immediately.  For more information see 
section 4, Possible side effects. 
There is a possibility that you may experience kidney problems when taking Biktarvy over a long 
period of time (see Warnings and precautions). 
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection.  While taking Biktarvy you may still develop infections 
or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 2 years of age, or weighing less than 14 kg regardless 
of age. The use of Biktarvy in children under 2 years of age, or weighing less than 14 kg has not yet

Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
• 
• 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant and ask about the potential benefits and 
risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child. 
If you have taken Biktarvy during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular blood tests and 
other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children whose mothers took 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection 
against HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Biktarvy.  This is because some of the active substances 
in this medicine pass into human breast milk.  Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living 
with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.  If you are 
breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as 
possible.

‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Biktarvy 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
There are two strengths of Biktarvy tablets. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate tablet for your 
age and weight.  
The recommended dose is: 
Children 2 years of age and older, who weigh at least 14 kg but less than 25 kg: one tablet each 
day with or without food (one 30 mg/120 mg/15 mg tablet). 
Due to the bitter taste, it is recommended not to chew or crush the tablet. 
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, you can split it in half. Take both halves of the 
tablet one after the other to get the full dose. Do not store the split tablet. 
The score line on the tablet is only there to help you break the tablet if your child has difficulty 
swallowing it whole. 
The 90-day multipack contains three 30-day packs together. 
→ Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking: 
• 
antacids to treat stomach ulcers, heartburn, or acid reflux, containing aluminium and/or 
magnesium hydroxide 
mineral supplements or vitamins containing magnesium or iron 
• 
→ See section 2 for more information on taking these medicines with Biktarvy. 
If you are on dialysis, take your daily dose of Biktarvy following completion of dialysis. 
If you take more Biktarvy than you should 
If you take more than the recommended dose of Biktarvy you may be at higher risk of side effects of 
this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice.  Keep or take the tablet 
bottle or carton with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Biktarvy 
It is important not to miss a dose of Biktarvy. 
If you miss a dose: 
• 
If you notice within 18 hours of the time you usually take Biktarvy, you must take the tablet as 
soon as possible.  Then take the next dose as usual. 
If you notice 18 hours or more after the time you usually take Biktarvy, then do not take the 
missed dose.  Wait and take the next dose at your usual time. 
• 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you vomit less than 1 hour after taking Biktarvy, take another tablet.  If you vomit more than 1 hour 
after taking Biktarvy you do not need to take another tablet until your next regularly scheduled tablet. 
Do not stop taking Biktarvy 
Do not stop taking Biktarvy without talking to your doctor.  Stopping Biktarvy can seriously affect 
how future treatment works.  If Biktarvy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you 
restart taking Biktarvy tablets. 
When your supply of Biktarvy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. 
If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Biktarvy 
treatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after 
stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is 
not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. 
→ Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately 
• 
• 
Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak 
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon 
after HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in 
the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms. 
Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as: 
- 
- 
- 
muscle weakness 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body 
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity 
→ If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor 
immediately.

- 
- 
- 
Painful red or purple skin that looks burned and peels off 
Blisters on your skin, mouth, nose, and genitals 
Red, painful, watery eyes 
→ If you have any of these symptoms, stop your medicine immediately and tell your doctor 
straight away. 
→ If any of the side effects get serious, tell your doctor. 
Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment 
The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data). 
• 
Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Biktarvy 
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, 
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: 
- 
- 
- 
joint stiffness 
joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) 
difficulty with movement 
→ If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor. 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes.

how future treatment works.  If Biktarvy is stopped for any reason, speak to your doctor before you 
restart taking Biktarvy tablets. 
When your supply of Biktarvy starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.  This is 
very important because the amount of virus may start to increase if the medicine is stopped for even a 
short time.  The disease may then become harder to treat. 
If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your Biktarvy 
treatment without talking to your doctor first.  You may require blood tests for several months after 
stopping treatment.  In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is 
not recommended as this may lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. 
→ Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Possible side effects: tell a doctor immediately 
• 
• 
Any signs of inflammation or infection.  In some patients with advanced HIV infection 
(AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak 
immune system), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon 
after HIV treatment is started.  It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in 
the body’s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms. 
Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur 
after you start taking medicines for HIV infection.  Autoimmune disorders may occur many 
months after the start of treatment.  Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms 
such as: 
- 
- 
- 
muscle weakness 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body 
palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity 
→ If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, tell your doctor 
immediately.

Other effects that may be seen during HIV treatment 
The frequency of the following side effects is not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data). 
• 
Bone problems.  Some patients taking combination antiretroviral medicines such as Biktarvy 
may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone).  Taking this type of medicine for a long time, taking corticosteroids, 
drinking alcohol, having a very weak immune system, and being overweight, may be some of 
the many risk factors for developing this disease.  Signs of osteonecrosis are: 
- 
- 
- 
joint stiffness 
joint aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) 
difficulty with movement 
→ If you notice any of these symptoms tell your doctor.

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose.  This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves.  Your doctor will test for these changes.

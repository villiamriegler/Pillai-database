Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) irrespective of 
time since initial diagnosis, based on an ad-hoc analysis of Study TAPER (CETB115J2411); an ongoing 
phase II, open-label, prospective, single-arm study in adult ITP patients who are refractory or relapsed 
after first-line steroids. 
As a consequence sections 4.1and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some minor amendments in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC for increased consistency. 
An updated RMP version 54.1 has been submitted. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0167/2016, P/0070/2019, P/0516/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0516/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0070/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0167/2016. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Immune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenia  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterised  by  a  low 
circulating  platelet  count  (thrombocytopenia),  decreased  platelet  production  and  increased  platelet 
destruction. Thrombocytopenia places patients at risks for bruising, mucocutaneous bleeding and more 
seriously intracranial haemorrhage; although bleeding symptoms may not always be present. Diagnosis 
of ITP is one of exclusion, when the history, physical examination, complete blood count and examination 
of peripheral blood smear do not suggest other aetiology for the thrombocytopenia.  
In Europe, adult ITP has an incidence of 1.6 to 3.9 cases per 100,000 per year with increasing incidence 
with older age and equal for the sexes except in the mid-adult years (30-60 years), when the disease is 
more prevalent in women. 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 6/82 
 
 
 
 
Before 2009, ITP was categorised based on the length of time from initial diagnosis into acute ITP, which 
lasted for up to 6 months from initial diagnosis, and chronic ITP, which lasted beyond 6 months from 
initial diagnosis (George et al 1996). In 2009, the International Working Group (IWG) released updated 
guidelines (Rodeghiero et al 2009), in which ITP was divided into newly diagnosed ITP (lasting up to 3 
months from diagnosis), persistent ITP (lasting between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis) and chronic 
ITP  (lasting  more  than  12  months  from  diagnosis).  This  classification  was  recently  reaffirmed  by  the 
American Society of Hematology (ASH) (Neunert et al 2019) and a panel of international experts (Provan 
et al 2019). 
Newly diagnosed ITP” was defined as all cases at first diagnosis. A new category, “persistent ITP,” was 
introduced  which  included  patients  not  reaching  spontaneous  remission  or  not  maintaining  complete 
response  off  therapy  between  3  to  12  months  from  diagnosis.  The  IWG  noted  that  the  possibility  of 
spontaneous remission is significant during this period and deferral of aggressive therapeutic approaches 
(such as splenectomy) should therefore be considered.  The term “chronic ITP” was reserved for patients 
with ITP lasting for more than 12 months. 
Management 
There are several guidelines including different treatment approaches in ITP, with the updated ASH 2019 
guideline [Neunert et al, 2019] and the updated ICR [Provan et al, 2019] being the more relevant ones. 
Inferences regarding the efficacy of treatments are mainly based on platelet counts as the more reliable 
surrogate  outcome  measure.  The  major  goal  for  treatment  of  ITP  is  to  provide  a  platelet  count  that 
prevents major bleeding rather than correcting the platelet count to normal levels. 
In newly diagnosed ITP (first 3 months), treatment is aimed at rapidly obtaining a safe platelet count (> 
30 x 109 /L) to prevent or stop haemorrhages and to ensure an acceptable quality of life, avoiding as 
much as possible treatment-related adverse effects. In both updated guidelines, corticosteroids, unless 
contraindicated, remain the standard initial treatment of newly diagnosed patients, although they should 
be  used  for  a  limited  time  (≤  6  weeks).  Use  of  IV  Ig,  or  IV  anti-D  where  available,  may  be  another 
appropriate first-line treatment in patients with bleeding, at high risk for bleeding, who require a surgical 
procedure, or who are unresponsive or contraindicated to prednisone. 
Most adult patient relapse upon cessation of steroid treatment. Patients still remaining thrombocytopenic 
after  3  months  from  diagnosis  or  initial  treatment  (corticosteroids,  IVIg,  anti-D)  are  classified  in 
persistent (between 3 to 12 months) or chronic (after at least 12 months). 
While the old guidelines did not specifically address patients with persistent ITP (between 3 to 12 months) 
due to lack of robust efficacy/safety data, the updated guidelines propose different treatment approaches 
for  this  refractory  population.  Usual  second-line  treatment  options  are  TPO-RA,  rituximab  and 
splenectomy,  nevertheless,  there  is  no  solid  evidence  that  defines  the  best  strategy.  Each  of  these 
second-line  treatments  may  be  effective  therapy  and  therefore  the  choice  of  treatment  should  be 
individualised based on duration of ITP, frequency of bleeding episodes requiring hospitalisation or rescue 
medication,  comorbidities,  age  of  the  patient,  medication  adherence,  medical  and  social  support 
networks, patient values and preferences, cost and availability. 
Available treatment modalities have different mechanisms of action and can be broadly categorised into 
those that are given only once (or for only 1 course) and are intended to induce a long-term response 
(rituximab,  splenectomy)  and  those  that  need  continued  or  chronic  administration  (low-dose 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, TPO-RAs). 
TPO-RAs (eltrombopag, romiplostim) have provided excellent responses (>60%) in splenectomised and 
non-splenectomised patients. Response to continued TPO-RAs persists for up to 6 to 8 years and often 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 7/82 
 
 
 
allows other ITP therapy to be reduced or discontinued. Cessation of treatment will lead to the return of 
thrombocytopenia in most cases, but some patients (10%-30%) may achieve a durable response after 
TPO-RAs are tapered and withdrawn. 
Rituximab shows a response of 60% of patients. Long-term durable responses occur in 20% to 25% of 
adult  patients.  Prior  to  treatment,  hepatitis  B  status  should  be  determined  and  vaccination  against 
encapsulated gram-positive bacteria should be given. 
Splenectomy provides long-term efficacy in approximately 60% of cases. Nonetheless, splenectomy is 
invasive,  irreversible,  associated  with  postoperative  complications,  and  its  effectiveness  is  currently 
unpredictable,  leading  many  physicians  and  patients  toward  postponement  and  use  of  alternative 
approaches.  Both  guidelines  suggest  that,  if  splenectomy  is  deemed  necessary,  surgery  should  be 
deferred  for  at  least  12  to  24  months  from  diagnosis  (chronic  ITP)  due  to  potential  for  spontaneous 
remission in the first year. 
Fostamatinib represents an option in chronic ITP for adult refractory to the previous treatments. It offers 
an alternative mechanism for reducing platelet destruction; it may provide response rates of 43% but 
stable responses of only 18%. 
Other  medical  therapies  for  patients  failing  previous  therapies,  with  less  robust  evidence,  are 
immunosuppressive agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A or azathioprine. Danazol and 
dapsone are “corticosteroid-sparing” agents that may be particularly useful in some patients (e.g. those 
in  whom  splenectomy  is  contraindicated  or  if  other  agents  are  unavailable.  Vinca  alkaloids  are  not  a 
chronic therapy option because of neurological toxicity. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R)  agonist. Eltrombopag initiates 
signaling cascades that induce proliferation and differentiation of multipotent bone marrow progenitor 
cells, which increases the platelet count. Platelet count increase following administration of eltrombopag 
has been demonstrated in several diseases associated with thrombocytopenia.  
Eltrombopag (Revolade) was initially approved in 2010 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients 
with  chronic  immune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenia  (ITP),  who  had  an  insufficient  response  to 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. Revolade is currently approved for the treatment of: 
•  patients aged 1 year and above with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months 
or  longer  from  diagnosis  and  who  are  refractory  to  other  treatments  (e.g.,  corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins), 
• 
thrombocytopenia  in  adult  patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  infection,  where  the 
degree of thrombocytopenia is the main factor preventing the initiation or limiting the ability to 
maintain optimal interferon-based therapy, 
•  adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either refractory to prior 
immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation. 
 
Previous modifications of the ITP therapeutic indication 
The efficacy and safety of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult ITP patients was 
based  on  the  results  of  three  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies,  [TRA100773A], 
[TRA100773B], and [TRA102537/RAISE], and one open-label study [TRA108057/REPEAT]. In all 
four  studies,  the  study  population  included  adult  patients  (≥18 years)  with  ITP  that  lasted  beyond  6 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 8/82 
 
 
 
months from initial diagnosis. At that time, ITP was  categorised into acute ITP (up to 6 months from 
initial  diagnosis),  and  chronic  ITP  (beyond  6 months  from  initial  diagnosis)  (George  et  al  1996). 
Consequently, eltrombopag was initially approved for the treatment of chronic ITP. 
In 2009, the International Working Group (IWG) released updated guidelines (Rodeghiero et al 2009), 
in which ITP was divided into newly diagnosed ITP (lasting up to 3 months from diagnosis), persistent 
ITP (lasting between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis) and chronic ITP (lasting more than 12 months 
from diagnosis). Taking into account the updated definition of chronic ITP and to remain consistent with 
the  population  studied  in  the  registration  studies,  the  ITP  indication  wording was  updated  in  2019  to 
replace  the  term  “chronic”  with  “lasting  6  months  or  longer  from  diagnosis”  (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/001110/II/0050; approved on 06-Feb-2019). 
 
Proposed therapeutic indication extension 
In the current variation application, the MAH proposes to modify the ITP indication statement to 
remove the term “lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis” to allow adult ITP patients who are 
refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) to be treated with eltrombopag 
after first-line treatment irrespective of time from initial diagnosis. Since only the adult ITP indication is 
sought to be extended with this submission, the paediatric indication will be separated into an 
individual statement. 
The proposed indication wording is as follows; additions are shown in bold text and deletions are 
marked in strikethrough (xxx): 
• 
“Revolade is indicated for the treatment of adult patients aged 1 year and above with 
primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).  
•  Revolade  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  aged  1  year  and  above  with 
primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).” 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
A pre-submission meeting with the CHMP Rapporteur (AEMPS) was held on 22-Sep-2021. The 
proposed extension of the ITP therapeutic indication and the supportive data package, consisting of 
clinical trial and real-world data were discussed. 
AEMPS stated that due to the limited number of patients from prospective clinical trials (CT), other 
forms of complementary evidence would be required to support this change. Real-world data (RWD) 
was considered appropriate as supportive data to CT data. The Agency also recommended to perform 
pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling to show that the approved doses of eltrombopag increase platelet 
counts regardless of time from diagnosis.  
In addition, the indication extension in paediatric patients was also discussed. The Agency highlighted 
that the unmet medical need in the paediatric population is less certain than for the adult population 
due to frequent spontaneous remissions. The Agency stated that the indication extension in 
paediatrics, based solely on guidelines and limited RWD in children, would be very unlikely, in view of 
the limited clinical trial data available in children. Guidelines and limited RWD could be considered as 
supportive to CT data, but cannot replace them. It was also remarked that the use of modelling data 
could be generally applicable also for children; however, the model would need to be populated by 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 9/82 
 
 
 
clinical data generated in children, which are not available to date for children with ITP less than 6 
months from diagnosis. 
In line with the Agency’s feedback, the MAH has provided a pharmacodynamic modelling to 
complement the prospective clinical trial data and real-world data in adult population. Based on the 
lack of currently available clinical data in the paediatric population less than 6 months from ITP 
diagnosis, only the adult indication is sought to be extended with this application. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted information for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of eltrombopag olamine in 
accordance with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Corr 2 guidance to address the following extension of the 
adult ITP indication: “Revolade is indicated for the treatment of adult patients aged 1 year and above 
with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who are 
refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).” 
This information would not modify the current SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has presented an ERA based on the Guidance on “Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) 
Phase I: Estimation of exposure  
•  Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
The  PEC  has  been  calculated,  according 
to 
the 
formula  established 
in 
the  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, as the sum of all PECs for all eltrombopag indications: 
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (75 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.000375 mg/L = 0.375 μg/L for ITP  
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (100 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.0005 mg/L = 0.5 μg/L for cHCVaT 
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (150 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.01) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.00075 mg/L = 0.75 μg/L for SAA 
Where:  
DOSEai  
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
= 75 mg/patient/day for ITP;  
= 100 mg/patient/day for cHCV associated thrombocytopenia  
Page 10/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
= 150 mg/patient/day for 6 months for SAA  
Fpen = 1 % (default) 
WASTEWinhab = 200 L/inhabitant/day  
DILUTION = 10  
Therefore, the overall PECSURFACEWATER = 0.375 μg/L + 0.5 μg/L + 0.75 μg/L = 1.625 μg/L. In this way, 
as the action limit of 0.01 μg/L is exceeded, further risk assessment in Phase II- Tier A of the procedure 
is required. 
•  Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. 
The octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) was estimated to be > 4.1 at pH 5, = 4.52 at pH 7, and = 
0.96 at pH 9, using the shake flask method according to the OECD 107 (Report SD2006/0232800/00). 
As the estimated log KOW value is clearly above the cu-off of 4.5, a PBT assessment is required. 
Phase II-Tier A: Environmental fate and effects analysis  
• 
Physico-chemical properties and fate 
Biodegradation 
The  inherent  ultimate  biodegradability  of  eltrombopag  was  assessed  under  standard  test  conditions, 
based  upon  the  OECD  guideline  302C  Modified  MITI  Test  (II).  The  primary  biodegradation  was 
determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The  results from the carbon 
dioxide  evolution  data  indicated  that  eltrombopag  attained  a  mean  biodegradation  of  14%  calculated 
from oxygen consumption values on Day 28. Results from the compound specific analysis showed that 
there was a loss of parent compound equivalent to 10% primary biodegradation of eltrombopag on Day 
28.  It  can  be  concluded  that  eltrombopag  is  neither  readily  nor  inherently  biodegradable  in  aqueous 
biodegradation tests. 
Adsorption / Desorption 
As  discussed  in  the  Type  II  variation  for  HCV  (eCTD  sequence  0037),  eltrombopag  was  initially 
investigated  for  determination  of  activated  sludge  sorption  isotherm  according  to  OPPTS  835.1110 
(Report SD2006/00091/00). However, no determination of the isotherm was possible in this study due 
to the instability of the test material in aqueous solution at a concentration and pH relevant to the fate 
of the test material in the wastewater treatment plant. At the time it was not possible to overcome these 
technical  challenges  and,  therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  those  physico-chemical  characteristics  of 
eltrombopag that contributed to the failure of this study were the same as those which would likely give 
rise to a Koc value for eltrombopag of greater than 10000 L/kg ostensibly triggering the need for a Phase 
II  Tier  B  analysis in  soil. However,  since  this  submission it  was  found  that it is  possible to  conduct  a 
soil/sludge adsorption study (OECD 106) with eltrombopag. In this study, the adsorption and desorption 
of  eltrombopag  was  determined  in  three  soils  and  two  municipal  sewage  sludges  using  the  batch 
equilibrium method according to the OECD test guideline no. 106. The following soils/sludges were used: 
soil I (Speyer 2.3; sandy loam), soil II (Hagenthal; silt loam), soil III (Mechtildshausen; loam), sludge I 
(Füllinsdorf) and sludge II (Sissach). In order to limit microbial degradation of the test item during the 
experiment, all soils and both sludge were treated by γ-irradiation before use. 
Adsorption kinetics were determined for a soil/sludge-to-solution ratio of 1/100 (1 g soil to 100 mL 0.01

adsorption (adsorbed fraction of applied) almost reached equilibrium after 48 hours of agitation due to 
its  high  adsorption.  The  fraction  of  adsorption  after  48  hours  was  94.1%,  92.7%  and  94.6%  of  the 
applied radioactivity for soils I to III, respectively, and 95.8% and 95.5% for sludge I and II, respectively. 
The  mass  balance,  determined  for  all  soils/sludge  after  48  hours of  adsorption,  showed  overall  mean 
recoveries  of  99.9%,  104.4%  and  105.4%  for  the  soils,  and  113.3%  and  108.8%  for  both  sludges, 
respectively. The higher recoveries in both sludge species are due to the high amount of non-extractable 
radioactivity  in  comparison  to  the  soils,  and  the  small  amount  of  material  combusted.  The  mean  KOC 
adsorption value for the soils were 132,556 mL/g and 8,119 mL/g for the sludge. The adsorption showed 
to be independent of the cation exchange capacity, organic carbon or clay content of the soils. A slight 
dependence of the adsorption from the pH could be observed. Desorption kinetics were followed 2, 5, 
24  and  48  hours  after  the  48  hours  adsorption  period.  Very  little  desorption  was  observed  for  all 
soils/sludge throughout the experiment. The percent of the desorbed radioactivity amounted to 3.5%, 
2.6%, 2.5%, 0.9% and 0.9% of adsorbed for soils I, II, III and sludge I and II, respectively after 48 
hours of desorption. The mean KOC desorption value for the soils was 302,493 mL/g and 30,492 mL/g 
for the sludge. 
Aerobic Transformation in Aquatic Sediment Systems 
The route and rate of degradation of [14C]eltrombopag olamine in two aquatic systems (river and pond) 
under aerobic conditions were investigated at 20 ºC in the dark. [14C]eltrombopag olamine dissipated 
from the water phase mainly due to rapid degradation and dissipation into the sediment layer. In the 
water  phase  eltrombopag  olamine  immediately  degraded  to  transformation  product  M4  with  the  DT50 
reached  immediately  after  application.  The  immediate  transformation/degradation  of  eltrombopag 
olamine  in  the  water  phase  was  proposed  to  be  driven  by  abiotic  processes,  as  the  dilute  biomass 
associated with “competent” degraders would be too reduced to cause such an abrupt biotic change. The 
rapid dissipation of [14C]eltrombopag olamine from the aqueous phase led to a subsequent accumulation 
in the sediment compartment. Between 10 and 20% degradation was observed after 106 days exposure. 
Eltrombopag olamine is very persistent considering the DT50 values of >1000 d at 12ºC in total system 
and the DT50 values of 653 and 3244 d at 12ºC in sediment. 
The criterion for sediment studies is met if more that 10% of the substance at any time point after or at 
14 days is present in sediment. The transformation product M 4 occurs in concentrations of 8.4 and 4.9 
% in sediment at study end (day 106) starting with concentrations of 21.2% and 27.4% at day 0. Thus 
TP M 4 cannot be considered as transient. Eltrombopag was exposed to UV light and measurement of 
light absorption revealed that this substance does exhibit significant absorption above 290 nm suggesting 
that degradation via direct photolysis may be a viable environmental depletion mechanism. 
•  Aquatic effects studies

•  Calculation of Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) using assessment factors 
MAH carried out the risk characterisation in Tier A of the environmental risk assessment based on the 
generated effect data. In order to assess the risk to the aquatic environment, the calculation of PEC/PNEC 
ratios is required. In compliance with the guideline on environmental risk assessment, the predicted no

concentrations (NOEC) values of these studies. A default assessment factor of 10 is applied to calculate 
the PNEC from the long-term toxicity test and the 10 to calculate anti-microbial effect study. 
PNECSURFACEWATER  =  52  μg/L  /10  =  5.2  μg/L  (based  on  lowest  NOEC  from  the  most  sensitive 
aquatic species). 
PNECMICROORGANISM  =  32000  μg/L  /10  =  3200  μg/L  (based  on  NOEC  from  Activate  Sludge 
Respiration Inhibition study). 
PNECGROUNDWATER = 120 μg/L /10 = 12 μg/L (based on NOEC from Daphnia magna reproduction

Calculation of refined PECSURFACEWATER 
The  PECSURFACEWATER  has  been  refined  using  epidemiological  data  for  all  registered  indications,  i.e., 
cHCVaT, SAA, and ITP (total PEC). 
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (75 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.000107) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.0401 μg/L for ITP  
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (100 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.00174) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.087 μg/L for cHCVaT 
PECSURFACEWATER = (DOSEai * Fpen) / (WASTEWinhab * DILUTION)  
= (150 mg/inhabitant/day * 0.00000254) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10)  
= 0.00019 μg/L for SAA 
Where:  
DOSEai  
Fpen  
= 75 mg/patient/day for ITP;  
= 100 mg/patient/day for cHCVaT 
= 150 mg/patient/day for 6 months for SAA  
= 10.7 in 100’000 inhabitants; 0.0107 % for ITP  
= 174 in 100'000 inhabitants; 0.174 % for cHCVaT 
 = 0.254 in 100’000 inhabitants; 0.000254 % for SAA 
WASTEWinhab  = 200 L/inhabitant/day  
DILUTION        = 10  
Therefore, the overall PECSURFACEWATER = 0.0040 μg/L + 0.87 μg/L + 0.00019 μg/L = 0.091 μg/L. 
Calculation of PECMICROORG 
Based on the default dilution factor of 10 used between surface water and sewage treatment plants, the 
PECMICROORG is ten times higher than the PECSURFACEWATER. 
PECMICROORG = 0.091 µg/L

Calculation of PECGROUNDWATER 
According  to  the  guideline,  the  PECGROUNDWATER  can  be  assumed  to  be  typically  0.25  times  the 
PECSURFACEWATER. This leads to a PECGROUNDWATER of 0.023 µg/L, for eltrombopag free acid.

In Tier B the PEC SURFACEWATER may be refined with information from STP modelling using the SimpleTreat 
model  by  incorporating  adsorption  of  substances  to  sewage  sludge  in  STPs,  using  the  data  from  the 
estimation of the adsorption coefficient in sewage sludge from two sewage treatment plants. 
First, the ElocalWATER  value is calculated according to the EMA guideline formula, where  
ElocalWATER = DOSEai * Fexcreta * Fpen * CAPACITYstp  
ITP: 75 mg/inhabitant/day * 1 * 0.000107 * 10000 inhabitants = 80.25 mg/day  
cHCVaT: 100 mg/inhabitant/day * 1 * 0.00174 * 10000 inhabitants = 1740 mg/day  
SAA: 150 mg/inhabitant/day * 1 * 0.00000254 * 10000 = 3.81 mg/day  
Sum ElocalWATER = 80.25 + 1740 + 3.81 = 1824.06 mg/day 
With:  
DOSEai  
= 75 mg/patient/day for ITP  
= 100 mg/patient/day for cHCV associated thrombocytopenia  
= 150 mg/patient/day for 6 months for SAA  
CAPACITYstp = 10000 inhabitants (R.16 Table R.16-14)  
Fexcreta = 100 %  
Fpen 
= 10.7 in 100000 inhabitants; 0.0107 % for ITP  
= 174 in 100000 inhabitants; 0.174 % for cHCVaT 
= 0.254 in 100000 inhabitants; 0.000254 % for SAA 
Applying the outcome of the SimpleTreat calculations the local surface water concentration can be refined 
as:  
PECSURFACEWATER = (Elocalwater* Fstp water) / (WASTEWinhab * CAPACITYstp * FACTOR * DILUTION)  
= (1824.06 mg/day * 0.4848) / (200 L/inhabitant/day * 10000 inhabitants * 1.0196 * 
10) = 0.000043 mg/L = 0.043 μg/L  
With:  
Elocalwater = 1824.06 mg/day  
Fstp water = 48.48 % (from Simpletreat output data)  
WASTEWinhab = 200 L/inhabitant/day (R.16 Table R.16-14)  
CAPACITYstp = 10000 inhabitants (R.16 Table R.16-14)  
FACTOR: 1 + Kpsusp * SUSPwater * 10-6= 1 + 1307 L/kg * 15 mg/L * 10-6 = 1.0196  
Kpsusp = 1307 L/kg (lowest Kd value for soils, as recommended by the draft EMA guidance, 2018, when 
Kd values do not correlate with organic carbon content)  
SUSPwater = 15 mg/L (R.16 Table R16-8)

While the risk ratio calculated for surface waters in Tier A does not indicate a risk for this environmental 
compartment and therefore no refinement is required, it can be noted that applying the refined Tier B 
PECSURFACEWATER for the calculation of the risk ratio results in a PEC/PNECSURFACEWATER of 0.0083.  
Subsequently, the refined Tier B PECsurface water is used to calculate PECSEDIMENT.

Extended effects analysis 
Water sediment effects 
The water-sediment study has shown that the level of eltrombopag in sediment at 14 days greater than 
10%  thereby  exceeding  the  guidance  criterion  for  sediment  studies.  The  toxicity  of  eltrombopag  was 
evaluated  on  the  sediment-dwelling  non-biting  midge  Chironomus  riparius  by  exposure  in  a  static 
sediment-water  test  system  over  a  28-day  period  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  OECD 
Chemicals Testing Guideline No. 218 Sediment-Water Chironomid Toxicity Test Using Spiked Sediment. 
Following a preliminary range-finding test, larvae of Chironomus riparius were exposed in groups of 80 
(four  replicates  of  20  larvae  per  concentration)  to  formulated  sediment  spiked  with  test  item  over  a 
range of concentrations of 100, 180, 320, 560 and 1000 mg/Kg for a period of 28 days. The numbers of 
emerged adult midges were recorded daily. 
Examination of the numbers of male and female adult midges emerged showed no biological significance 
between  the  numbers  of  male  and  females.  Therefore,  it  was  considered  that  the  test  item  had  no 
significant effect on the sex ratio of emerged adults. 
The toxicity of the test item to the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus riparius has been investigated 
and based on nominal concentrations gave 28-Day EC15 and EC50 (reduction in emergence) of 350 and 
690 mg/Kg respectively. The No Observed Effect Concentration was 560 mg/Kg and the Lowest Observed 
Effect Concentration was 1000 mg/Kg. The results based on geometric mean measured concentrations 
gave  28-  Day  EC15  and  EC50  (reduction  in  emergence)  of  66  and  130  mg/Kg  respectively.  The  No 
Observed Effect Concentration was 104 mg/Kg and the Lowest Observed Effect Concentration was 185 
mg/Kg.  The  28-Day  EC15  and  EC50  (development  rate)  values  were  not  determined  as  only  -0.4% 
reduction in development rate was determined for the 560 mg/Kg test group (the highest concentration 
where development rate could be calculated). The No Observed Effect Concentration was determined to 
be 560 mg/Kg (based on nominal concentration and 104 mg/Kg based on estimated geometric mean 
measured concentrations).

The PEC SEDIMENT can be calculated following REACH Guidance on information requirements and chemical 
safety  assessment  Chapter  R16.:  Environmental  Exposure  Estimation  (European  Chemicals  Agency, 
ECHA, February 2016):  
PECLOCAL SED = (KSUSP-WATER  / RHOSUSP) * PECLOCAL WATER * 1000 = (431.6 m3/m3 / 1150 kg/m3) * 0.043 
μg/L * 1000 = 16.14 μg/kg (Equation R.16-34)  
With:  
RHOSUSP = 1150 kg/m3 (Equation R. 16-1) 
KSUSP-WATER = FwaterSUSP + FsolidSUSP * (KpSUSP /1000) * RHOSOLID =  
0.9 mwater
3/msusp
3 + 0.1 msolid
3/msusp3 * (1723 L/kgsolid / 1000) * 2500 kg/m3 = 431.6 m3/m3  
(Equation R.16-7)  
With:  
RHOsolid = 2500 kg/m3 (Equation R. 16.7)  
Kpsusp = 1723 L/kg (highest Kd value for soils, as recommended by the draft EMA guidance, 2018, when 
Kd values do not correlate with organic carbon content). 
In order to account for the fact that the effect concentration of the sediment toxicity study is expressed 
as  a  dry  weight  concentration,  the  PECsediment  calculated  above,  which  relates  to  wet  sediment  is 
multiplied with a conversion factor of 4.6, resulting in a dry weight PECsediment of 74.24 µg/kg. 
The PNECsediment, based on the NOEC for the development of the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus 
riparius (Table 5-1) including an assessment factor of 100, is 1040 µg/L. 
The risk ratio for sediment therefore calculates as: 
PEC/PNECSEDIMENT = 74.24 µg/kg / 1040 µg/kg = 0.071 
This result indicates that eltrombopag does not constitute a risk to sediment compartments.

The measured octanol water partition coefficient (log Dow, pH 7 = 4.52) of eltrombopag is above 3.0 
indicating  that  eltrombopag  could  have  a  tendency  to  absorb  to  lipid  surfaces  and  therefore 
bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic organisms.

A  study  was  performed  to  assess  the  bioconcentration  potential  of  the  test  item  in  rainbow  trout 
(Oncorhynchus mykiss). The method followed was that described in the OECD Guideline for the Testing 
of Chemicals (1996) No 305 “Bioconcentration: Flow- Through Fish Test. 
Rainbow trout were exposed, in groups of 52, to an aqueous solution of the test item at concentrations 
of 0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l for a period of 14 days under dynamic test conditions. Samples of test fish 
were taken from the solvent control, 0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l test groups on days 5, 7, 10, 12 and 14 
and the concentration of test item in the fish tissues determined. After 14 days exposure the remaining 
fish were subjected to a depuration period of 10 days. Samples of test fish were taken from the solvent 
control and 0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l test groups on days 3, 5, 7 and 10 of the depuration phase and the 
concentration of test item determined. The Bioconcentration Factors at steady state (BCFss) for the test 
item based on total radioactivity in the whole fish after 14 days were calculated to be 14 at concentrations 
of 0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l (equivalent to 0.0020 and 0.020 mg/l as free base respectively). The Kinetic 
Bioconcentration  Factors  (BCFk)  were  also  calculated  and  were  shown  to  be  29  at  a  concentration  of 
0.0025 mg/l and 16 at a concentration of 0.025 mg/l after 14 days. 
The uptake and depuration rate constants, k1 and k2, were determined to be 4.4148 and 0.1515 for the 
0.0025 mg/l test concentration and 3.0805 and 0.1957 for the 0.025 mg/l test concentration. As the 
test  item  had  a  log  Kow  of  4.52,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  test  guidelines,  the 
Bioconcentration Factors (BCF) values were also calculated as a function of the lipid content. These BCF 
values  were  higher  than  those  determined  in  the  whole  fish  results  thereby  suggesting  that  the 
accumulation of the test item was into the lipid content of the fish. However, as the values were below 
2000, the test item would not be classified as bioaccumulative according to the PBT assessment criteria. 
The Bioconcentration Factors at steady state (BCFss) for the test item as a function of lipid content after 
14 days was calculated to be 135 at concentrations of 0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l (equivalent to 0.0020 and 
0.020  mg/l  as  free  base  respectively).  For  substances  with  high  lipophilicity  (e.g.  log  Kow  >3)  the 
bioconcentration factor should be normalized to 5% lipid content (based on whole body wet weight). The 
“BCF  steady  state”  recalculated  and  related  to  5%  lipid  content  is  336  and  130  at  concentrations  of 
0.0025  and  0.025  mg/L.  The  Kinetic  Bioconcentration  Factors  (BCFk)  were  also  calculated  and  were 
shown to be 280 at a concentration of 0.0025 mg/l and 136 at a concentration of 0.025 mg/l after 14 
days. 
The BCFss has been recalculated considering three successive analysis of Cf and normalisation to 5% 
lipid content as follows:  
Low  concentration  (0.0025  mg/L):  BCFss  as  function  of  the  lipid  content  (taken  from  study  Report 
2011N113982_01): mean value from day 7 – 12 (325, 330, 352) = 336  
High  concentration  (0.025  mg/L):  BCFss  as  function  of  the  lipid  content  (taken  from  study  Report 
2011N113982_01,): mean value from day 7 – 14 (137, 144, 105, 135) = 130 
Eltrombopag olamine was shown not to significantly accumulate in fish tissue. At the end of the 10-Day 
depuration period 88% and 85% of eltrombopag olamine was eliminated from the fish tissues for the 
0.0025 and 0.025 mg/l test concentrations respectively. Although this was less than the 90% elimination 
detailed  in  the  guideline,  it  was  considered  that  the  results  of  the  test  were  valid  given  the  low  BCF 
values  obtained  during  the  study.  Based  on this  information the  biological  half-life  of  the test  item  is 
considered to be between 3 and 10 days. 
Based on the lipid normalised BCFss values of 336 and 130 for the low dose and high dose exposure, 
respectively, remaining below the criteria for a bioaccumulative substance of a BCF of 2000, eltrombopag 
is not considered a bioaccumulative substance.

The  MAH  concludes  that,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  no  immediate  risk  was  found  for  eltrombopag  and 
excretion  of  parent  substance  by  patients  is  expected  to  be  low,  intake  of  active  pharmaceutical 
ingredients into surface waters should be avoided as far as possible. Therefore, as with all non-readily 
biodegradable human medicines, patients should be advised not to dispose of unused eltrombopag via 
domestic sewage.

2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Phase I. Estimation of exposure 
Eltrombopag  olamine  has  a  partition  coefficient  greater  than  4.5  (log  Dow  =  4.52).  Therefore,  a  PBT 
assessment,  including  a  bioconcentration  study  in  fish  has  been  conducted  in  Phase  II-Tier  B  of  this 
assessment. 
The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for eltrombopag olamine, considering all indications, 
is  1.625  μg/L  which  exceeds  the  trigger  value  of  0.01  μg/L  as  given  by  EMA  guideline, 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev  1.  Therefore,  an  environmental  assessment  Phase  II  –Tier  A  was 
performed.

Phase II Tier A. Environmental fate and effects analysis 
In chronic toxicity studies, eltrombopag olamine shows a significant toxicity to aquatic organisms, i.e. 
Lemna (OECD 201), Daphnia magna (OECD 211) and fish (OECD 210) has been observed, being the fish 
species, Danio rerio (zebra fish), the most sensitive of the aquatic species tested. 
The  biodegradability  of  eltrombopag  olamine  was  assessed  by  the  MAH  following  the  OECD  guideline 
302C  Modified  MITI  Test  (II)  instead  of  the  Ready  Biodegradability  test  (OECD  301)  as  advises  the 
guideline  on 
the  environmental 
risk  assessment  of  medical  products 
for  human  use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  Eltrombopag  is  not  considered  biodegradable  and  the  MAH  proposed  to 
perform a Tier B assessment. 
According  to  OECD  Guidelines  for  the  Testing  of  Chemiclas  No.  308,  eltrombopag  has  been  found  to 
quickly  dissipate  from  the  water  phase  into  the  sediment.  The  half-life  determined  in  the  study  on 
transformation  in  total  water/sediment  systems  exceeds  120  days,  thus  being  very  persistent 
considering the DT50 values of >1000 days at 12ºC in total system and the DT50 values of 653 and 3244 
days at 12ºC in sediment. Therefore, an assessment for sediment has been presented in Phase II-Tier 
B of the current environmental risk assessment (OECD 218). 
Eltrombopag shows a low potential for adsorption to sludge (Koc<10000), indicate the unlikely affinity to 
bind  to  sewage  sludge  in  the  SPT,  thus  a  terrestrial  assessment  in  Phase  II  Tier  B  is  not  considered 
necessary.  
Phase II Tier B. Extended environmental fate and effects analysis 
The  toxicity  of  eltrombopag  to  the  sediment-dwelling  larvae  of  Chironomus  riparius  (OECD  218)  was 
investigated and revealed no toxicity. 
PECSEDIMENT  for  eltrombopag  and  the  ratio  PECSEDIMENT/PNECSEDIMENT  were  recalculated  considering  the 
PECbcf value calculated as the sum all of each indication PECs, based on prevalence of the diseases for 
all indications (ITP, cHCVaT and SAA). The result indicates that eltrombopag does not constitute a risk 
to sediment compartments. 
Since  eltrombopag  has  a  Log  Pow  value  which  is  >3  in  the  environmental  pH  range,  a  fish 
bioaccumulation  study  (OECD  305)  was  conducted.  In  the  bioconcentration  study  in  rainbow  trout 
(Oncorhynchus mykiss), eltrombopag olamine was shown not to significantly accumulate in fish tissue. 
Therefore, eltrombopag cannot be considered bioaccumulative based on the maximum Biocencentration 
Factors at steady state (BCFSS) of 336 and 130 at a concentration of 0.025 and 0.0025 mg/l respectively, 
and  Kinetic  Bioconcentration  Factors  (BCFk)  of  136  and  280  for  the  low  and  high  dose  exposure, 
respectively, as the BCF remains below the criteria for a bio-accumulative substance.  
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of eltrombopag olamine.  
Considering the above data, eltrombopag olamine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Rationale for the proposed therapeutic indication extension 
The  recommended  standard-of-care,  first-line  therapy  for  newly  diagnosed  ITP  patients  who  need 
treatment consists of corticosteroids, unless there is a contraindication or need for more rapid platelet 
increase.  If  a  faster  response  is  required,  especially  in  case  of  severe  bleeding,  intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg) and anti-D immunoglobulin may be used. Approximately 70-80% of ITP patients 
initially  respond  to  corticosteroids,  but  relapses  are  frequent  and  long-term  remission  rates  are  low 
(Cuker  2015).  Moreover,  the  majority  of  patients  treated  with  corticosteroids  suffer  from  significant 
corticosteroid-related adverse events (AEs).  
Updated  guidelines  (Provan  et  al  2019;  Neunert  et  al  2019)  recommend  the  use  of  thrombopoietin 
receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) for persistent ITP. Due to the serious side effects of steroid therapy, these 
guidelines  do  not  recommend  a  prolonged  course  of  corticosteroids.  National  guidelines,  e.g.,  the 
guidelines  by  the  Austrian,  German  and  Swiss  medical  societies  (Matzdorff  et  al  2018),  and  those 
published recently by the Spanish ITP group (Lozano et al 2021), also recommend earlier use of TPO-
RAs in refractory ITP, mainly based on data from observational studies in standard clinical practice. 
Considering the high relapse rate and unfavorable safety profile of corticosteroids, treating physicians 
introduce eltrombopag earlier to shorten the time to achieve optimal platelet counts and to minimise 
the risk of serious side effects associated with prolonged use of steroids or other therapies such as 
immunosuppressants and splenectomy.  
The revised ITP guidelines and growing real-world evidence for the use of TPO-RAs in patients with 
newly diagnosed and persistent ITP, indicate a significant unmet need in patients with newly diagnosed 
and persistent ITP who are refractory to first-line therapies.  
In order to support the extension of the Revolade indication for adult ITP, the MAH performed: 
1.  An update of the established population pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model 
enriched with new clinical trial data (from studies TRA102537, TRA108057 and CETB115J2411) in 
which the covariate effect of “time since diagnosis” was tested on relevant PD parameters; 
2.  A subgroup analysis of the completed ITP registration studies ([TRA100773A], [TRA100773B], 
[TRA102537/RAISE] and [TRA108057/REPEAT] studies); 
3.  An ad-hoc analysis of an ongoing phase II, open-label, prospective, single-arm study in adult ITP 
patients who are refractory or relapsed after first-line steroids (Study  TAPER, CETB115J2411); 
4.  A literature review (including Real-World Evidence) on the use of eltrombopag in newly diagnosed 
and persistent ITP.

application and is essentially unchanged. No additional information is provided in this application.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamics  of  eltrombopag  was  described  for  ITP  in  the  original  marketing  authorisation 
application and is essentially unchanged. No additional information is provided in this application. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK/PD model 
A population pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis was conducted to confirm that 
earlier administration of eltrombopag yields similar efficacy (similar percentage of patients reaching 
the threshold for platelet count of 50 G/L) as when eltrombopag is started at 6 months or later after 
diagnosis.  
The PK model included an absorption compartment (gut), a central (blood) compartment, and a 
peripheral (tissue) compartment, with absorption lag time, dual sequential first-order absorption and 
inter-occasional variability on absorption, and with first order elimination. Weight, gender, race (Asian 
vs. Non-Asian) and the use of corticosteroids were predictors of drug exposure. 
The PD model included a precursor production compartment, two transit/maturation compartments 
and blood was represented by one platelet compartment. Parameters for the PD portion of the model 
included estimated baseline platelet count (BASE), zero-order production rate of platelet precursors 
(KIN), first-order maturation rate of platelet precursors (KOUT) and first-order elimination rate of 
platelets (KP, estimated as KIN/BASE). The model indicates that drug concentration increases the 
platelet production for responders (through a linear proportionality constant (SLOP)), but not for non-
responders (slope equal to 0). In the final model developed by ICON Clinical Research, 81% of the 
population were considered responders and 19% of the population were considered non-responders. 
Additional positive factors in platelet production were female and older patients (>50 years of age).  
For the purpose of this indication extension, this population PK/PD model was enriched with new 
clinical trial data ([TRA102537/RAISE], [TRA108057/REPEAT] and CETB115J2411 studies) and updated 
to test the covariate effect of “time since diagnosis” on relevant parameters and incorporate in the final 
model if statistically significant. 
Simulation-based analysis 
Platelet count data from 283 eltrombopag-treated patients - for whom ‘time from diagnosis’ 
information’ was available - were used in model development, totaling 6157 platelet observations 
across the 5 studies. In the CETB115J2411 study, 32 patients started eltrombopag treatment 6 or 
more months from ITP diagnosis, and 72 patients started earlier; in studies TRA100773A and 
TRA100773B, all 38 patients retained in the modeling dataset started eltrombopag 6 or more months 
from diagnosis; in the RAISE study, 89 patients started eltrombopag 6 or more months from diagnosis, 
and 10 patients started earlier, and in the REPEAT study, 37 patients started eltrombopag 6 or more 
months from diagnosis, and only 5 patients started earlier.  
The final platelet model incorporated the effect of time of eltrombopag administration relative to time 
since diagnosis as a categorical covariate (<6 months since diagnosis vs  ≥6 months since diagnosis) 
on first-order maturation rate of platelet precursors (KOUT), and the effect of gender on platelet 
production (SLOPE). The estimated effect of time of eltrombopag administration relative to time since 
diagnosis on KOUT was estimated as 1.12 (close to 1), indicating that platelet dynamics is expected to 
be similar regardless of the time from ITP diagnosis to start of eltrombopag. Of note, with this final 
model enriched with data from 3 additional clinical studies, 85.9% of the population were considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 24/82 
 
 
 
responders and 14.1% of the population were considered non-responders (SLOPE parameter in the 
model equal 0).   
The updated population PK/PD model was subsequently used to simulate platelet count profiles over 
time for 4 weeks for all the 283 patients by considering a 4-week treatment with 50 mg of 
eltrombopag once daily and 100 replicates for each of the two following scenarios: one scenario where 
all the patients started eltrombopag less than six months after ITP diagnosis and a second scenario 
where all the patients started eltrombopag at least 6 months after ITP diagnosis. 
Figure 1 presents the median platelet count over time for the two scenarios described above. This 
figure indicates that the time difference between treatment start and ITP diagnosis is not expected to 
result in clinically relevant difference in platelet profile over the simulated 4 weeks. 
Table 1 summarises the percentage of patients that reach the threshold of 50 G/L at Weeks 2, 3 and 4 
as mean, median, 5th and 95th percentile across all the replicates, stratified by time since diagnosis 
category (ITP duration ≥6 months, ITP duration <6 months. At each time point (end of Week 2, end of 
Week 3 and end of Week 4), the median percentage of patients who achieved a platelet count of at 
least 50 G/L is similar regardless of the time from ITP diagnosis to start of eltrombopag. These median 
response rates should not be interpreted and compared to observed response rates from the clinical 
trials because of the following reasons: the simulated scenarios did not consider dose escalation of 
eltrombopag, the high intra-individual variability which resulted in a wide 90% percentile interval and 
the high proportion of patients with a severe disease before starting eltrombopag (39% of all 283 
patients had baseline platelet count below 15 G/L) who may have needed simulated dose escalation to 
reach a response. 
There is a constant linear proportionality between drug concentration and platelet production in the 
updated PKPD model. There is also a negligible effect of time of eltrombopag administration relative to 
time since diagnosis on the maturation rate of platelet precursors (estimated as 1.12, close to 1).  
Considering the similar platelet profiles between patients with an ITP duration <6 months and patients 
with an ITP duration ≥6 months obtained from simulations with a fixed dose of eltrombopag at 50 mg 
once daily, the platelet count would remain similar if the eltrombopag dosing was based on the dosing 
algorithm specified in the SmPC.

2.3.1.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD modelling analysis is aimed to evaluate whether the influence of time since diagnosis may 
provide clinically relevant differences in platelet counts in ITP adult patients receiving eltrombopag. For 
that purpose, the MAH has used a previously established population PK/PD model in healthy volunteers 
and ITP patients together with the information from recent clinical trials were the time of diagnosis was 
recorded to evaluate such covariate effect on PD parameters. Population PK/PD parameters were re-
estimated, showing no relevant differences in parameter estimation between the initial and updated 
PK/PD models, which identified the time since diagnosis effect on kout (12% higher in patients <6 
months diagnosed) and gender on platelet production (slope). Then, simulations were conducted over 
4 weeks to assess the platelet counts levels. The simulation over 4 weeks between patients with less 
than 6-month and ≥6-month diagnosis revealed no relevant differences in platelet count levels at 2, 3 
and 4 weeks among both groups. The results were comparable in the central tendency statistics (mean 
and median) and showed comparable variability, which is expected.  
The updated PK/PD model was enriched with new clinical trial data ([TRA102537/RAISE], 
[TRA108057/REPEAT] and CETB115J2411 studies) and used to test the covariate effect of “time since 
diagnosis” on key PD parameters (as requested in the SA). The number of patients and observations 
included in the updated PK/PD model seem adequate for the characterization of the PK/PD relationship 
of eltrombopag in ITP adult patients, although the proportion of patients with time since diagnosis <6-
month is unbalanced across the clinical trials included (mean: 30.7%, range: 0-69.2%). This may be 
problematic due to potential confounding, causing a non-random selection of patients and a likely 
biased conclusion. 
In conclusion, the modelling strategy seems adequate, since a previously developed population PK/PD 
model has been used and enriched with additional clinical data to predict the categorical effect of time 
since diagnosis on PD parameters. Although the covariate effect was statistically identified, no clinically 
relevant changes in platelet count levels were predicted between patients with <6-month and ≥6-
month diagnosis across the 4 weeks after the start of treatment. However, the unbalanced proportion 
of patients with time since diagnosis <6 months could affect the final conclusion obtained. Therefore, 
the current population PK/PD should be considered of low-impact (descriptive) for supporting the 
current extension of indication.  
2.3.2.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD properties of using eltrombopag irrespective of the time since diagnosis have been 
adequately addressed by the MAH. The conclusion that minimal changes are expected in platelet count 
levels seems adequate, which lack of any clinical relevance, although an unbalanced and non-random 
selection of patients was observed. Therefore, the claim of using eltrombopag in patients with an ITP 
duration of less than 6 months and at least of 6 months based on the current population PK/PD model 
should be considered with caution.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
Efficacy data of eltrombopag in adult ITP patients lasting 6 months from diagnosis were described in 
the original marketing authorisation application and remain unchanged.  
In the current variation application, efficacy results from adult ITP broken down by time since 
diagnosis (newly diagnosed ITP, persistent ITP and chronic ITP) are presented by two ad-hoc analysis. 
Subgroup analysis of completed ITP registration studies (ad-hoc analysis of 
EXTENDED study) 
- Parent studies 
The efficacy and safety of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult ITP patients 
was based on the results of three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies, [TRA100773A], 
[TRA100773B], [TRA102537/RAISE] and one open-label study [TRA108057/REPEAT]. 
In all four studies, the study population included adult patients (≥18 years) diagnosed with chronic 
ITP, defined at that time as the persistence of thrombocytopenia for at least 6 months and a baseline 
platelet count of <30 G/L. In these studies, the time from ITP diagnosis was not collected. 
After completion of their participation in any of the above studies (parent studies), the patients were 
offered to continue treatment with eltrombopag in the open-label study [TRA105325/EXTEND], until 
eltrombopag became commercially available. In this study, the date of ITP diagnosis was collected, 
which allowed derivation of time from ITP diagnosis to the first dose of eltrombopag or matching 
placebo in the parent study. 
Despite the inclusion criteria limiting the enrollment of patients with ITP for at least 6 months, some 
patients with a time since ITP diagnosis of less than 6 months have been enrolled and treated with 
eltrombopag or placebo in the parent ITP studies. 
- Ad hoc analysis of EXTEND study (efficacy and safety by time since ITP diagnosis) 
To support the proposed extension of the adult ITP indication, an ad-hoc analysis of efficacy and safety 
data by treatment arm (eltrombopag, placebo) and by time since ITP diagnosis (<3 months, 3 to <6 
months, 6 to 12 months and >12 months) was conducted in patients who continued treatment in the 
EXTEND study. Due to the limited number of patients with a time since ITP diagnosis less than 6 months, 
results from this ad-hoc analysis are presented by pooling the parent ITP studies. 
Study populations and definition of the primary efficacy endpoint considered for this ad-hoc analysis are 
consistent with those presented in the primary clinical study report of each study. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was the platelet response rate defined as: 
−  An increase in the platelet count from <30 G/L at baseline to ≥50 G/L after up to 6 weeks of dosing 
in TRA100773A and TRA100773B studies, 
−  A platelet count between 50 and 400 G/L during the 6-month treatment period in TRA102537 study 
(RAISE), 
−  Achieving a platelet count ≥50 G/L and an increase by at least 2-times the baseline value after up 
to 42 days of treatment in TRA108057 study (REPEAT).

Study participants 
Overall,  302/494  (61.1%)  (ranging  from  43.6%  to  74.1%)  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  parent  studies 
were accrued into [TRA105325/EXTEND] study. 
Among  the  302  patients  enrolled  in  the  EXTEND  study,  3  patients  were  excluded  from  this  subgroup 
analysis for the following reasons: one patient due to unknown parent study and 2 patients with an ITP 
diagnosis date after the exposure to eltrombopag or placebo. Despite the inclusion criteria limiting the 
enrollment  of  patients  with  an  ITP  diagnosis  of  at  least  6  months,  6.3%  (19/299)  of  patients  who 
continued treatment in the EXTEND study started eltrombopag treatment with an ITP diagnosis of less 
than 6 months (Table 7).

Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  patients  who  continued  in  the  [EXTEND]  study  are  presented 
head-to-head by treatment and time since diagnosis (ITP category) in Table 8. These characteristics did 
not differ substantially from those patients enrolled in the parent studies. Indeed, among all patients 
enrolled  in  the  parent  studies  (N=494),  203  patients  (41.1%)  were  receiving  ITP  medication  at 
randomization, 191 patients (38.7%) had a prior splenectomy, and 208 patients (42.1%) had baseline 
platelet counts of ≤15 G/L. Among patients included in this subgroup analysis (N=299), 39.1% were 
receiving  ITP  medication  at  randomization,  37.8%  had  a  prior  splenectomy,  and  38.5%  had  baseline 
platelet counts of ≤15 G/L.

• 
Platelet count response rate 
The  proportion  of  responders  is  presented  head-to-head  by  treatment  and  time  since  diagnosis  (ITP 
category) in Table 9 by combining all patients who continued in the EXTEND study. In patients treated 
with eltrombopag, the proportions of responders after up to 6 weeks of treatment was 80%, 45.5%, 
66.7% and 68.2% in the different ITP categories: newly diagnosed ITP (<3 months), persistent ITP (3 
to <6 months and 6 to 12 months), and chronic ITP (>12 months), respectively. For patients with time 
since  ITP  diagnosis  of  6  months  or  less, 56.3%  (9/16)  randomized  to  eltrombopag  were  responders 
versus 33.3% (1/3) randomized to placebo. Comparisons to placebo should be considered with caution 
due to the limited number of patients randomized to placebo within each ITP category.

Population (N=217): eltrombopag-treated patients from the four ITP registration studies included in the 
respective efficacy population (as defined in the primary clinical study report of each individual study) and 
enrolled in the EXTEND study. 
•  Bleeding rate 
The proportion of patients without bleeding events at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment (Day 43) 
is presented head-to-head by treatment and time since diagnosis (ITP category) in Table 10, by 
combining all patients who continued in the EXTEND study. In patients treated with eltrombopag, the 
proportion of patients without bleeding events is approximately two-fold higher after 6 weeks of 
treatment compared to baseline. The proportion of patients without bleeding events increased post 
baseline to 75%, 90%, 63.6% and 78.6% for patients with an ITP duration of <3 months (newly 
diagnosed ITP), 3 to <6 months, 6 to 12 months (persistent ITP) and >12 months (chronic ITP), 
respectively, compared to a baseline value of 20.0%, 45.5%, 36.7% and 31.5% across the 
subgroups, respectively. For patients with time since ITP diagnosis of 6 months or less, 85.7% 
(12/14) randomized to eltrombopag did not report any post-baseline bleeding events versus 33.3% 
(1/3) randomized to placebo. Comparisons to placebo should be considered with caution due to the 
limited number of patients randomized to placebo within each ITP category.

Ad-hoc analysis of TAPER Study (CETB115J2411 study)  
Phase II, Open-label, Prospective, Single-arm, Study to Assess Ability of Eltrombopag to 
Induce Sustained Remission in Subjects With ITP Who Are Refractory or Relapsed After 
First-line Steroids (Ad-hoc analysis). 
Objectives 
Taper Study (CETB115J2411) [ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT03524612]: will assess the ability of 
eltrombopag to induce sustained treatment-free remission in ITP subjects who relapsed or failed to 
respond to an initial treatment with steroids. This study was designed to include patients who failed 
previous first-line steroid treatments without restrictions to newly diagnosed, persistent or chronic ITP 
definitions, as previously published data indicated that eltrombopag used for the early stage ITP is as 
effective and safe as it is in chronic ITP (González-López et al 2017).  
The primary analysis of this study, intended to assess the ability of eltrombopag to induce a sustained 
remission by Month 12, will be performed once all patients have completed 12 months on study or 
have discontinued early from study. The results of this analysis, once available, will be reported in the 
primary Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
The recruitment was completed on 26-Oct-2020 with 105 patients enrolled of the 101 planned 
patients. As of 01-Dec-2021, 19 patients are ongoing. 
Actual Study Start Date: November 2, 2018 [ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT03524612] 
Estimated Study Completion Date: October 21, 2022 [ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT03524612] 
Interim Ad-hoc analysis: to support the proposed extension of the adult ITP indication, an ad-hoc 
analysis of the CETB115J2411 study was conducted using a data cut-off date of 15-Oct-2020.  
Study participants 
Study CETB115J2411 (N=105): was designed to include patients who failed previous first-line 
steroid treatments without restrictions to newly diagnosed, persistent or chronic ITP definitions. 
Inclusion Criteria [ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03524612]: 
o  Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study 
o  Subjects ≥ 18 years old 
o  Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of primary ITP, who are not responsive or in relapse after 
a first line of steroid therapy ± intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (used as a rescue 
therapy) 
o  Platelet count < 30×109/L and assessed as needing treatment (per physician's discretion)  
Patients who reach complete response and maintain platelets counts above 70 G/L for two months are 
eligible to taper-off study drug. The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the proportion of 
patients with sustained remission off treatment by Month 12 (Figure 2).

Ad-hoc analysis: included only patients with at least 6 months of data or patients who discontinued 
the study prior to Month 6. Newly enrolled ongoing patients who have not completed 6 months on 
study at the time of the data cutoff date were not included in these analyses. 
Patients included in the ad-hoc analyses were categorised by time since diagnosis, as follows: 
•  Group A: Time since ITP diagnosis <3 months (newly diagnosed ITP) 
•  Group B: Time since ITP diagnosis 3 to <6 months (persistent ITP) 
•  Group C: Time since ITP diagnosis 6 to ≤12 months (persistent ITP) 
•  Group D: Time since ITP diagnosis >12 months (chronic ITP) 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all patients who received at least one dose of eltrombopag. 
Safety Set: included all patients who received at least one dose of eltrombopag. 
Treatment 
Drug: eltrombopag 
Eltrombopag is for oral use and comes in 12.5, 25, 50 and 75 mg tablets; prescribed dose is taken 
once daily  [ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03524612]. 
Sample size (ad-hoc analysis) 
For the ad-hoc analysis, 82/105 (78.1%) patients from study CETB115J2411 were eligible for. All 82 
patients had at least one dose of eltrombopag. Approximately one quarter of patients (24.4%) 
discontinued treatment; the main reason for discontinuation was due to physician decision (13.4%). 
The majority (61.0%) of patients are still on treatment and 14.6% of patients have tapered-off 
eltrombopag as per protocol (Table 11).

Outcomes/endpoints (ad-hoc analysis) 
Efficacy endpoints are presented by time since ITP diagnosis ( called “ITP categories”) using the FAS. 
Response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with a platelet count of ≥50 G/L at least once 
by Week 9 Day 1 (~Day 57) without rescue therapy (consistent with the response rate definitions used 
in the pivotal registration studies for the ITP indication). 
Partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) by Week 9 Day 1 were also presented using the 
following definition: proportion of patients with a platelet count ≥30 G/L (PR) or ≥100 G/L (CR) at 
least once by Week 9 Day 1 (~Day 57) without rescue therapy. 
In response derivations, ‘without rescue therapy’ is any platelet count assessment at least 14 days 
(≥14 days) after rescue therapy. It is noted that rescue therapy is allowed within the first 14 days per 
CETB115J2411 protocol. 
The following supportive efficacy endpoints were summarized to assess the effect of eltrombopag on 
the durability of the response, the time to response and the occurrence of bleeding events: 
- R50_2BL: proportion of patients who achieved a platelet count ≥50 G/L and 2× baseline at 
Week 7 Day 1 (~Day 43) without rescue therapy 
- R50_4out6: proportion of patients with a platelet count of ≥50 G/L by Week 9 Day 1 (~Day 
57) on at least 4 out of 6 consecutive scheduled platelet assessments without rescue therapy 
- R50_6out8: proportion of patients with a platelet count of ≥50 G/L within first 6 months of 
dosing on at least 6 out of 8 consecutive scheduled platelet assessments without rescue therapy 
-PR_6M: proportion of patients with a platelet count ≥30 G/L at least once within first 6 months 
without rescue therapy 
-Median platelet count over time 
-Time to first response threshold, ≥30 G/L, ≥50 G/L and ≥100 G/L 
-WHO and ITP bleeding scales results by visit

Statistical methods 
Since this clinical trial aims to have patients come off drug after achieving complete response (platelet 
count ≥100 G/L) and maintaining it for 2 months, efficacy analysis was focused on the first two 
months (~57 days) of the trial, to assess the effect of eltrombopag while on treatment. The safety 
analyses are presented until Month 6.  
Data: Only data up to and including Month 6 (Study day 183 – Week 27 Day 1) was used. Data after 
Month 6 was not used in these analyses. 
The results from this ad-hoc analysis (data cutoff date of 15-Oct-2020) presented will only be used to 
support the proposed extension of the adult ITP indication.  
The limits imposed for the population and data analysed (restricted to up to 6 months from start of 
eltrombopag), as well as for the planned analyses (efficacy endpoints assessed while on treatment) 
allow to have an optimal independency between this ad-hoc analysis assessing the effect of 
eltrombopag while on treatment and the planned primary analysis assessing the ability of eltrombopag 
to maintain a response after treatment discontinuation. 
Safety results from this ad-hoc analysis are presented using the Safety Set which included all patients 
who received at least one dose of eltrombopag. 
Only descriptive analyses were performed: 
- Frequencies and percentages for categorical data; 
-  Continuous  variables  are  summarized  by  number  of  patients,  mean,  standard 
deviation,      minimum,  25th-quantile,  median,  75th-quantile  and  maximum  unless 
otherwise indicated; 
- Kaplan-Meier curves for time to event analyses; 
- Graphs were provided where applicable. 
Results 
Included population 
For the ad-hoc analysis, 82/105 (78.1%) patients from study CETB115J2411 were eligible. All 82 
patients had at least one dose of eltrombopag. Approximately one quarter of patients (24.4%) 
discontinued treatment; the main reason for discontinuation was due to physician decision (13.4%). 
The majority (61.0%) of patients is still on treatment and 14.6% of patients have tapered-off 
eltrombopag as per protocol (Table 11). 
Treatment discontinuations were reported for 34.2% of the patients with newly diagnosed ITP, 11.1% 
in patients with persistent ITP lasting 3 to <6 months from diagnosis, 12.5% in patients with  
persistent ITP lasting 6 to ≤12 months from diagnosis, and 30.0% in patients with chronic. Study 
discontinuations were reported with 31.6%, 11.1%, 12.5% and 20.0%, respectively.

Efficacy results 
• 
Platelet count response rate 
By week 9, platelet response defined as at least once platelet count ≥ 50 G/L was achieved in 84.3% 
to 94.4% of patients in all categories/subgroups by time since ITP diagnosis. Response rates were 
higher when a platelet response was defined as a platelet count > 30 G/L, ranging between 88.2% to 
100% for subgroups by time since ITP diagnosis (Table 14).

The median time to first response ≥50 G/L at any time within the first 6 months from start of 
eltrombopag was comparable across all ITP categories (from 8 to 19 days) (Figure 3). For complete 
response it ranged from 15 to 29 days across all ITP categories.

Platelet count changes over time have been submitted as part of this application. The median (25-75th 
percentile) increase in platelets from Baseline to Week 9 Day 1 was 84.5 G/L (36.5, 165.6). The median 
platelet count increases from Baseline to Week 9 Day 1 ranged from 40 to 107 across ITP categories. 
•  Rescue therapy 
The proportion of patients who required rescue therapy excluding the first 14 days within first 6 
months were slightly higher in patients with newly diagnosed or chronic ITP (23.5% and 20.0%, 
respectively) compared to patients with persistent ITP (0% and 5.6%).

Only 6 (5.7%) patients had platelet transfusions in the first 6 months of treatment, including 5 
patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 1 patient with persistent ITP. Five patients had these 
transfusions within the first 3 months and one patient after 3 months.  
•  Bleeding 
When assessed with the WHO Bleeding Scale, the proportion of patients without bleeding increased 
during eltrombopag treatment in all ITP categories. 
Table 17: Number (%) of patients without bleeding over time by WHO Bleeding Scale 
The severity of bleeding also decreased in all ITP categories, which was reflected by a rapidly 
decreasing proportion of patients with grade 2 bleeding events. For example, in newly diagnosed ITP, 5 
patients (9.8%) had grade 2 bleeding at baseline, and none or only a single patient starting from Week 
4. 
When assessed with the ITP bleeding scale, skin bleeding detected by physical examination was the 
most frequent bleeding at baseline across all the categories of ITP. The proportion of patients with skin 
bleeding decreased during eltrombopag treatment when compared to baseline in all ITP categories. 
The remaining types of bleeding were less frequent at baseline, and included epistaxis, oral, 
gastrointestinal, urinary, and gynecological bleeding. The proportion of patients with these bleedings 
also decreased during eltrombopag treatment across all ITP categories.

4.4.3. Effectiveness data (Real-World Evidence) 
A literature review was conducted using search terms for eltrombopag and newly diagnosed or persistent 
ITP. The identified 27 studies were published from 2014 till 2021. Out of the 27 identified publications, 
7  (3 prospective  and  4  retrospective  studies)  were  classified  as  the  most  relevant  in  terms  of  study 
design, data completeness, and the size of study population. The remaining publications were excluded 
from the analysis because of the type of publication, a small sample size, small numbers of patients with 
newly diagnosed or persistent ITP, small numbers of patients receiving eltrombopag as a single agent, 
or lack of efficacy data by ITP category.  
The MAH claims that, overall, these studies have demonstrated that eltrombopag is effective and safe in 
patients with newly diagnosed and persistent ITP once lack of response to first-line therapies has been 
confirmed,  which  may  happen  already  within  the  first  3  months  from  diagnosis.  Moreover,  the 
effectiveness (Table 19 and Table 20) and safety profile of eltrombopag was shown to be similar to that 
seen in patients with chronic ITP.

Prospective studies 
Tripathi et al 2014  
The goal of this study was to assess response to eltrombopag in 25 adult and adolescent patients (median 
age 27 years, range 15-55 years) with newly diagnosed ITP who were refractory to corticosteroids.  
None of the patients responded to prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. These patients 
were given 50 mg/day of eltrombopag, and prednisolone was gradually tapered and discontinued within 
2 weeks. After 2 weeks of eltrombopag treatment, the mean platelet count increased from 17.5 G/L to 
152  G/L.  After  one  month  of  eltrombopag  treatment,  80%  of  patients  achieved  a  response  (platelet 
count >50 G/L). Response was maintained at Month 3 in 76% of patients.

Figure 4  Platelet count and response rates within 3 months of eltrombopag treatment 
Source: Tripathi et al 2014 
Five patients who did not respond to eltrombopag 50 mg and one patient who lost response subsequently 
were offered other options along with splenectomy. 
Bleeding  episodes  and  severity  decreased  significantly  in  all  those  who  achieved  response  (76  %). 
Bleeding symptoms were assessed by the WHO scale. 
Tran et al 2017 
The aim of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in patients with newly diagnosed 
and persistent ITP within 6 months of diagnosis. Thirty-nine adult ITP patients (median age 52 years) 
who  were  refractory  to  prior  therapy  were  enrolled  and  treated  with  eltrombopag  for  12  weeks.  The 
median  (Q1,  Q3)  time  from  diagnosis  was  2.2 months  (1.1,  5.4 months).  Prior  therapies  included 
corticosteroids (95% of patients), IVIg (58% of patients), and immunosuppression (28% of patients). 
The starting dose of eltrombopag ranged from 50 mg to 75 mg/day, depending on the baseline platelet 
count. The median dose at Week 12 was 50 mg/day. Thirty-six (92.3%) patients completed 12 weeks 
of treatment, while 3 (7.7%) patients discontinued earlier (2 patients required a new ITP therapy and 1 
patient developed thrombocytosis). 
At Week 12, 67% of patients achieved overall response, including 44% with complete response (platelet 
count  >100  G/L),  15%  with  partial  response  (platelet  count  >50  G/L)  and  8%  with  minor  response 
(platelet count ≥30 G/L) with ≥50% reduction in the dose intensity of concomitant ITP therapy compared 
to screening. 
At Week 26, overall response was achieved by 54% of patients, including 28% with complete response, 
21% with partial response and 5% with minor response. 
Lucchini et al 2021 
This prospective, multi-center phase 2 trial evaluated eltrombopag in 51 adult patients with primary ITP 
(22 with newly diagnosed ITP and 29 with persistent ITP) who were refractory to or relapsed after first-
line therapy. The study was divided into period of treatment (PT) from Week 1 to Week 24, period of 
tapering and discontinuation (PTD) from Week 25 up to Week 32, and period of observation (PO) of 24 
weeks starting from eltrombopag discontinuation. 
At Week 24, 34 (66.7%) patients (14 with newly diagnosed ITP and 20 with persistent ITP) achieved a 
response (platelet count ≥30 G/L and at least a two-fold increase from baseline), including 18 (35%) 
patients (6 newly diagnosed and 12 persistent) with complete response (platelet count ≥100 G/L). No 
significant difference in platelet response was seen between newly diagnosed ITP and persistent ITP.

Five bleeding events were reported: one grade 3 retinal hemorrhage at Week 1; two grade 2 epistaxis: 
one  at  Week  14  and  one  at  Week  28;  one  grade  1  menorrhagia  at  Week  38;  one  grade 1  mucosal 
bleeding at Week 10. For the last three events, patients were off treatment. 
Retrospective studies 
González-López et al 2017 
This was a retrospective study of 220 adult patients with ITP, including 30 patients with newly diagnosed 
ITP (up to 3 months from diagnosis), 30 patients with persistent ITP (more than 3 months to up to 12 
months from diagnosis), and 160 patients with chronic ITP (more than 12 months from diagnosis.  
Response  was  defined  as  a  platelet  count  of  ≥30  G/L  and  at  least  two-fold  increase  in  the  baseline 
platelet count. Complete response (CR) was defined as a platelet count of ≥100 G/L. The definition of 
response required simultaneous resolution of bleeding symptoms and absence of rescue or concomitant 
treatments during previous 8 weeks. 
Groups were homogenous with regards to age, baseline platelet count and number of previous therapies. 
For parameters likely to increase over time such as proportion of splenectomized patients, proportion of 
prior rituximab and duration of ITP, a gradual increase was observed from newly diagnosed to chronic 
ITP patients. 
Of the 220 patients enrolled, 180 (90%) achieved a response; among them 167 (75.9%) achieved a CR 
after a 15-month follow-up. The rates of response were the highest in newly diagnosed ITP (93.3% of 
responses with 86.7% of CR) and slightly lower in persistent ITP (83.3% of responses with 80.0% of CR) 
and chronic ITP (79.4% of responses with 73.1% of CR.

The goal of this retrospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of TPO-RAs in newly diagnosed, 
persistent  and  chronic  ITP.  Out  of  28  adult  patients  (median  aged  61  years),  6 patients  had  newly 
diagnosed ITP, 4 had persistent ITP and 18 had chronic ITP. Twenty-one patients received eltrombopag, 
and  7  patients  received  eltrombopag  and  romiplostim  sequentially  (5  patients  switched  from 
eltrombopag to romiplostim and 2 patients switched from romiplostim to eltrombopag). Median duration 
of treatment was 8 months (range: 1-76) for eltrombopag and 4 months (range: 1-21) for romiplostim. 
The overall response rate was 78.5% for eltrombopag (3 responses, 19 complete responses) and 43% 
for romiplostim (1 response, 2 complete responses). All patients with newly diagnosed ITP and persistent 
ITP responded to treatment, compared to 72% of patients with chronic ITP. 
Moulis et al 2021 
This retrospective real-world evidence analysis was designed to assess the use, efficacy and safety of 
eltrombopag  in  adult  ITP  patients  treated  with  eltrombopag  within  6  months of  ITP  diagnosis.  It  was 
based on data from the French CARMEN registry that included 799 ITP patients. One-hundred fifty-six 
(19.5%) patients were treated with eltrombopag, out of whom 95 (60.9%) patients were treated during

the first 6 months of ITP (newly diagnosed and persistent ITP). The mean age was 60.5 years; 52.6% 
were  men;  34.7%  had  ≥1  comorbidity  of  the  Charlson  Comorbidity  Index  (CCI);  58.9%  had  at  ≥1 
cardiovascular risk factor (not including age and sex). 
At ITP diagnosis, the median platelet count was 7 G/L and 80% patients had bleeding. Therapy prior to 
eltrombopag included corticosteroids in 95.8% of patients, IVIg in 69.5% of patients, dapsone in 11.6%, 
hydroxychloroquine  in  6.3%,  rituximab  in  5  (5.3%),  romiplostiin  5  (5.3%),  vinblastine  in  5  (5.3%), 
danazol in 2 (2.1%); no patient was splenectomized. Median time from ITP onset to eltrombopag was 
1.6 months with 74 (77.9%) of patients having newly diagnosed ITP (up to 3 months from ITP diagnosis). 
Eltrombopag  was  used  as  second-line  and  third-line  agent  in  41  (43.2%)  and  32  (33.7%)  patients, 
respectively. Among the 95 patients, 48 had a platelet count <30 G/L at eltrombopag initiation; among 
them,  39  (81.3%)  achieved  overall  response  (platelet  count  ≥30  G/L)  and  35  (72.9%)  complete 
response (platelet count ≥100 G/L). Concomitant treatment was withdrawn in 58% of cases.  
Iino et al 2020 
This  observational  retrospective  analysis  was  conducted  using  data  from  real-world  clinical  practice. 
Seventy-seven adult ITP patients (median age 69, range 17-92 years) were treated with TPO-RAs, out 
of whom 64 patients received eltrombopag (median dose 25 mg, range 12.5-50 mg) and 13 patients 
received romiplostim. Most of the patients had newly diagnosed ITP 50 (65%), 5 (6%) of patient had 
persistent ITP and 22 (29%) of patients had chronic ITP. 
Overall response, which included complete response (platelet count ≥100 G/L) and response (platelet 
count  30  to  100  G/L),  was  achieved  in  79.2%  of  patients  (46  patients  with  complete  response,  15 
patients with response). Out of 32 patients who discontinued TPO-RAs because of complete response, 
27  (84%)  patients  had  newly  diagnosed  ITP.  Most  of  the  patients  (n=30;  (94%)),  who  discontinued 
TPO-RAs after achieving complete response had received eltrombopag with median dose of 25 mg (range 
12.5-50 mg). Two-year treatment-free remission (TFR) rate was 66.4% in patients with newly diagnosed 
ITP who achieved CR. Of note, 18 (94%) of patients who maintained remission at 2 years were treated 
with eltrombopag. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support the efficacy of eltrombopag in patients with ITP ≤ 6 months, no new complete clinical trials 
have been submitted. Instead, two ad-hoc analyses of subgroups from: 1) ITP registration studies; 2) 
Interim analysis of ongoing phase II TAPER study (CETB115J2411), have been provided. Eltrombopag 
efficacy was explored among different patient subgroups by time from ITP diagnosis. 
In addition, real world evidence of the already use of eltrombopag in patients with less than 6 months 
from ITP diagnosis in clinical practice has been provided.  
A subgroup analysis of the completed ITP registration studies ([TRA100773A], [TRA100773B], 
[TRA102537/RAISE]  and  [TRA108057/REPEAT]  studies)  was  performed.  Due  to  the  fact  that  these 
studies did not collect patient data of time from diagnosis, it is acceptable that data are analysed through 
the open label study TRA105325/EXTEND, which included patients from the parent studies that continued 
treatment until eltrombopag became commercially available and where time from diagnosis was collected. 
Nonetheless, as an open study, its robustness decreases.  
The  conduct  of  the  ad-hoc  subgroup  analysis  of  the  TAPER  study  is  considered  adequate  due  to  the 
similarity  of  the  study  populations  (adult  patients  who  failed  first-line  therapy  with  baseline  platelet 
Assessment report

Page 47/82 
 
 
 
counts <30 G/L) and of the primary efficacy endpoint definition (platelet count ≥50 G/L) with the ones 
explored in parent studies. Nineteen of the 299 patients included in the ad-hoc analysis had < 6 months 
from ITP diagnosis. The study protocol, the SAP and in-depth details of the ad-hoc statistical analysis 
have been requested during the evaluation of the application. The submitted analysis seems to be in line 
with the SAP provided. Demographics and baseline characteristics from EXTEND study are similar to the 
ones from parent studies: a greater percentage of subjects were female and the study population was 
predominantly  white  with  a  median  age  around  50  years.  The  majority  of  patients  with  less  than  6 
months  from  diagnosis  was  no  splenectomised,  which  concurs  with  the  recommended  approach  of 
deferring splenectomy to more advanced stages of the disease. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The ad-hoc analysis of the TAPER study included 5 adult patients with newly diagnosed ITP [<3 months 
from diagnosis] and 41 patients with persistent ITP [3 months to < 12 months from diagnosis] who were 
treated with eltrombopag. In total, 16 patients had <6 months from ITP diagnosis and were treated with 
eltrombopag.  
Platelet count responses achieved showed that eltrombopag raises platelet counts irrespective of time 
from diagnosis in a relevant proportion of patients. The proportions of responders after up to 6 weeks 
of treatment was 80% (4/5) (newly diagnosed ITP), 45.5% (5/11) (persistent ITP; 3 to <6 months), 
66.7% (20/30) (persistent ITP; 6 to 12 months) and 68.2% (116/171) (chronic ITP). If a comparison 
is made, 56.3% (9/16) randomized to eltrombopag were responders versus 33.3% (1/3) randomized 
to placebo in the subgroup of patients with less than 6 months form diagnosis 
It is already known that the degree of bleeding in ITP is largely dependent on the degree of 
thrombocytopenia and therefore while platelet counts increase with eltrombopag treatment, bleeding 
rates decrease. The results of this analysis showed that this trend can also be confirmed in the 
subgroup of patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis. At week 6, the proportion of patients 
without bleeding events increased post baseline to 75% (3/4) (newly diagnosed ITP), 90% (9/10) 
(persistent ITP; 3 to <6 months), 63.6% (14/22) (persistent ITP; 6 to 12 months) and 78.6% 
(110/140) (>12 months), compared to a baseline value of 20.0% (1/5), 45.5% (5/11), 36.7% 
(11/30) and 31.5% (53/168) across the subgroups, respective. If a comparison is made, 85.7% 
[12/14] randomized to eltrombopag did not report any post-baseline bleeding events versus 33.3% 
[1/3] randomized to placebo. 
Although favourable effects were observed both for platelet response and bleeding reduction, the very 
small sample size included in this ad-hoc analysis cannot be ignored, especially with regards to newly 
diagnosed  ITP  (only  5  patients  with  <3  months  from  ITP  diagnosis).  This  specially  apply  to  the 
comparison made with the placebo group, where only 3 patients had less than 6 months from diagnosis, 
which implies that these results have to be interpreted with caution. Moreover, it should be kept in mind 
that it is a subgroup analysis not previously pre-specified, also limiting the reliability on the results.  
Data  regarding  reduction  in  ITP  therapy  or  need  for  rescue  treatment  broken  down  by  subgroups  in 
EXTEND study have been provided at the CHMP request. However, due to the small sample size of the 
study regarding subgroups, no conclusion can be drawn in this respect. 
The previous limited sample derived from parent studies increases with the submitted ad-hoc interim 
analysis of the ongoing phase II TAPER study (CETB115J2411). 
While the primary aim of the study is to assess the ability of eltrombopag of inducing a sustained 
remission by Month 12 in patients who relapsed or failed to respond to an initial treatment with 
steroids (N=105); the initial submitted ad-hoc analysis (cut-off date 15-Oct-2022; n=82) presents 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 48/82 
 
 
 
data of platelet counts and bleeding rates up to and including month 6, with the aim of assessing 
eltrombopag efficacy irrespective of time from diagnosis. 
Initial cut- off date (15-Oct-2020) of TAPER Study (n=82) was not recent. As it was stated in the 
documentation that 105 patients were enrolled in the mentioned study, therefore 23 additional 
patients had been enrolled since the cut-off date, which was a significant body of additional data. 
Consequently, the MAH was requested to submit an updated report, which could be useful to reinforce 
the evidence submitted through clinical trials.  
From the initial submitted data (cut-off date 15-Oct-2022), specifically, 56 patients were treated with 
eltrombopag with <6 months from diagnosis (n=38: newly diagnosed ITP; n= 18; 3 to <6 months). 
One  quarter  of  the  patients  discontinued  from  treatment  (24,4%)  being  the  main  reason  physician 
decision  (13,4%).  Although  not  included  in  the  clinical  overview  provided  by  the  MAH,  12.2%  of  this 
physician decisions were due to lack of efficacy, with the greatest percentage of observed in the subgroup 
of  newly  diagnosed  (21.1%  (8/38),  5.6%  (1/18),  0%,  10%  (1/10).  The  same  trend  was  observed 
regarding study discontinuation. The MAH was requested to compare these rates with pivotal trials and 
discuss its clinical relevance also taking into account reported deaths and literature.  
Patients’ demographics and baseline characteristics are similar to the ones explored in parent studies 
with a great proportion of females, white race and a median age round to 50 years. The general great 
percentage of women throughout all categories (except chronic ITP) agrees with the known 
characteristics of the disease where women prevalence is higher in the mid-adult years, ensuring this 
the external validity of the study. Platelet count at baseline were <30×109/L, in line with inclusion 
criteria of parent studies and the median exposure was 6.01 months in all ITP categories. 
In this analysis, platelet count responses (≥50 G/L at least once) increased in a relevant proportion of 
patients (ranged from 80.0% to 94.4% by Week 9 across all ITP categories), supporting the results 
observed in the subgroups analysis from parent studies. Similar rates were observed for platelet 
threshold of ≥30 G/L; (ranged from 80.0% to 100%) and for the threshold of ≥100 G/L (ranged 
from 73.7% to 80.0%). The median time to first response ≥50 G/L was comparable across all ITP 
categories (from 8 to 17 days) and a slightly more time was observed for complete response (ranged 
from 22 to 29 days), which was not unexpected. Results from supportive efficacy endpoints, which 
reflect more sustained or durable responses, also showed favorable results for eltrombopag treatment 
(response rates ≥50 G/L on at least 6 out of 8 consecutive assessments in the first 6 months on study 
showed durable responses with rates ranging from 68.8% to 83.3% across the ITP categories).  
Regarding the use of rescue therapy, overall, about one quarter needed it in the first 6 months, mainly 
during the first 14 days (allowed per protocol) with prednisone being the main one used. The 
proportion of patients who required rescue therapy was slightly higher in patients with newly 
diagnosed or chronic ITP (26.3% and 20.0%, respectively) if compared to patients with persistent ITP 
(0% and 6.3%). These percentages are within expected for TPO-AR in ITP, as a similar percentage was 
also reported with romiplostim (≈45%). 
With respect to bleeding events, results were also in line with those from ad-hoc analysis from parent 
studies; the proportion of patients without bleeding increased during eltrombopag treatment in all ITP 
categories at Week 4: newly diagnosed ITP [patients without bleeding increased from 39.5% (15/38) 
at baseline to 84.8% (28/33)], 3 to <6 months [from 61.1% (11/18) to 94.4% (17/18)], 6 to ≤12 
months [from 50.0% (8/16) to 86.7% (13/15)] and >12 months [from 70.0% (7/10) to 100% (9/9).  
In response to the clarifications requested, the MAH has acknowledged that the initial cut-off used for 
the TAPER ad-hoc analysis (15-Oct-2020), was outdated. In this regard, the MAH has clarified that, 
nowadays, the study is still ongoing with 4 patients and therefore, an updated interim report with a 
more recent updated cut-off has been provided (22-Oct-2021; n=105). Of them, 51 patients fall in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 49/82 
 
 
 
category of newly diagnosed ITP (< 3 months) and 21 belong to the category of persistent ITP (3 to 
<6 months). 
It should be pointed out that the MAH asserts that both time-points used in the analyses were 
prespecified in the study protocol, being the second one (22-Oct-2021), prespecified for the primary 
analysis of the study, which reduces the risk of bias of favouring the results by selecting the time point 
through observation.  
In terms of efficacy, results from such updated analysis do not differ from those observed in the 
previous analysis in terms of rase in platelet counts and decrease in bleeding rates. 
On the other hand, the need of rescue therapy is continued to be seen in approximately one quarter of 
the patients (23.8%) in the first 14 days (allowed per protocol) in the updated analysis. The proportion 
of patients who required rescue therapy excluding the first 14 days within first 6 months were slightly 
higher in patients with newly diagnosed or chronic ITP (23.5% and 20.0%, respectively) compared to 
patients with persistent ITP (0% and 5.6%). Nonetheless, these percentages show similarity with the 
18%  of  the  patients  who  required  rescue  treatment  in  RAISE  study,  which  served  as  basis  for  initial 
authorisation. 
In addition, after being required to, the MAH has provided median platelet count over time with 
interquartile range by time since diagnosis, which show the achievement of counts over 50 G/L after 3 
week of treatment maintained through the 27 weeks period, irrespective of time from diagnosis. 
On the other hand, updated analysis of TAPER study (N=105) continues to show a slight increase (of 
approx.  10  %.)  in  the  rate  of  treatment  discontinuation  and  of  study  discontinuation  due  to  lack  of 
efficacy in the subgroup of patients with newly diagnosed ITP (< 3 months). When compared this rate 
with data from register studies, such increase is continued to be observed, as only a 1.4% (7/494) of 
the patients included in such studies discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy (only 1 patient was 
included in the ad-hoc analysis of EXTEND study and treated with eltrombopag). 
The MAH has discussed this issue and argues that the observed increase in study J2411 (TAPER) might 
be due to an excessively early treatment discontinuation by the investigators, given the primary aim of 
the study (need to ensure an appropriate response to taper and maintain response) and given the 
uncertainty regarding the bleeding profile of these patients at the initial stages of the disease, which 
would lead investigators to be more cautious. These arguments can be agreed.   
Related to this, if the reported deaths for haemorrhage are taken into account (which could be 
considered as lack of efficacy), it is acknowledged that sample size and design of TAPER study 
precludes to reach any conclusion about the association with the risk of haemorrhage and the ITP 
chronological stage of the disease. However, there seems to be a consistency between the reported 
deaths rates in the study and the ones reported in literature. 
Consequently, although events suggesting lack of efficacy from study J2411 (TAPER study) cannot be 
viewed as conclusive, weighting them up with the overall high response rates and the decrease in the 
rates of bleeding observed in the study, they can be viewed as not concerning. 
In conclusion, favorable effects were also observed for eltrombopag in this ad-hoc analysis; however, 
limitations of a non-controlled study (single-arm) should be kept in mind as they hind the assessment 
of causality of the treatment effect and therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, 
additional clarifications were requested regarding the two ad-hoc analysis performed: 
Patients with ITP may respond to one TPO-RA but not to another (Al-Samkari et al. Br J Haematol 
2022). Limited data are available describing outcomes in non-responder patients following prior 
treatment with eltrombopag. The MAH was requested to provide more details on those patients who do 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 50/82 
 
 
 
not have an adequate response to eltrombopag, including switching outcomes to other agents (e.g. 
other available TPO-RAs) that may reduce platelet count fluctuations and/or achieve a platelet 
response. In this regard, it remains uncertain if such patients responded to another treatment or 
benefited from switching between TPO-ARs as the MAH has not provided clinical details from the 
patients who did not have an adequate response to eltrombopag in TAPER study, arguing that that was 
not the aim of the carried out study.  
In the EXTEND study and in TAPER study (CETB115J2411), the number of patients, included in each 
treatment group compared with prior ITP medication lines, was unclear. The MAH was requested to 
clarify whether eltrombopag efficacy and/or safety were different in heavily pre-treated ITP population 
in function of severity of underlying ITP. In this regard, the MAH has clarified that in ongoing TAPER 
study, all enrolled patients had only received steroid courses and therefore, were not heavily pre-
treated. In this respect, it is considered that, given the recommendations provided in current 
guidelines, it is expected that in clinical practice, patients with < 6 months form diagnosis mostly 
match these characteristics of not being heavily pre-treated. On the other hand, in register studies, 
eltrombopag has previously demonstrated its response in patients irrespective of the use of 
concomitant ITP medication at randomization/enrolment or splenectomy status, as it is stated in the 
current SmPC. Given that pivotal trials mostly included patients with chronic ITP, it is understandable 
that patients were more heavily pre-treated in those studies. Although an extensive clarification 
whether numerical differences in response rates and/or certain AEs are known with the long-term 
eltrombopag use in patients who had previously received rituximab or splenectomy has not been 
provided, this issues is not considered essential within the current procedure since patients with less 
than 6 months form diagnosis are expected no to be heavily pre-treated. 
Moreover, regarding TAPER study design, clarifications related to the threshold of a platelet count of 70 
x109/L (at least), or preferably, 100x109/L, and the aim to discontinue treatment with eltrombopag below 
a thrombocyte count of 50 x109/L  have been provided as requested. It seems that the tapering approach 
followed in TAPER study differs from other published approaches. Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that 
there is no currently consensus regarding optimal approaches to tapering and discontinuation of TPO-RA 
therapy. Nevertheless, these issues are not relevant to the current procedure. 
Effectiveness data through literature review from recent real-world evidence (period time from 
2014-till 2021) were also provided. The evidence submitted show that eltrombopag is frequently used-
off label during clinical practice in patients with < 6 months once lack of response to fist-line has been 
confirmed, which is not unexpected according to current guidelines (Neunert et al, 2019; Provan et al, 
2019). 
Results from 7 published studies (3 prospective and 4 retrospective), rated by the company as the 
most relevant found, were provided. Five of them (Tripathi et al 2014; Lucchini et al 2021; González-
López et al 2017; Rivolti et al 2019; Iino et al 2020) specify the number of patients included 
differentiated by ITP categories (in total 133 patients had newly diagnosed ITP and 68 patients 
persistent ITP). In contrast, the remaining two studies (Tran et al 2017; Moulis et al 2021) do not 
distinguish between the number of patients included in each category (in total 134 patients within 6 
months of ITP diagnosis).  
All of the above studies included adult patients (except from Tripathi et al 2014 study which also 
included adolescents > 15 years) who were refractory or relapsed to first line-therapy and with a 
general median platelet count at presentation < 30 x 109/L. Overall, the most common administered 
dose of eltrombopag was 50 mg/day. Therefore, although it is not feasible to carry out a strict 
comparison, it could be assumed that characteristics of these observational studies do not differ 
greatly from the ones of clinical trials. 
First of all, it must be taken into account that robust evidence that can be drawn from routine clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 51/82 
 
 
 
settings is limited, and therefore, interpretation of data must be done with caution. Single arms 
studies, small sample sizes, potential selection bias in retrospective studies or concomitant treatment 
used as rescue therapy influencing response rates, are aspects, among other, that should be kept in 
mind when data are interpreted. 
Nonetheless, results show the achievement of clinically relevant platelet responses in a considerable 
proportion of patients with < 6 months from diagnosis [ranged: 67%-90%] suggesting that 
eltrombopag effect is the same regardless of time since diagnosis. The majority of the publications also 
report a decrease in bleeding rates and some of them also report a decrease in the use of rescue 
medication or concomitant ITP therapy. Since these results are in line with those achieved in the 
clinical trial ad-hoc analyses, they can be considered as supportive.  
In summary, the above presented efficacy data showed that adult patients achieved relevant platelet 
response counts when treated with eltrombopag irrespective of time for ITP diagnosis and this 
translates into a reduction in the rate of bleeding, which is the goal in ITP therapy. No relevant 
differences have been observed in patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis when compared 
with those with >6 months. Nonetheless, these results come from ad-hoc analysis and have not been 
yet confirmed specifically by a controlled trial in patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis. 
Within this procedure, additional data is provided by the EXTEND open-label extension study, which 
recruited patients from the parent studies. However, its limited sample size (19 patients with less than 
6 months from ITP diagnosis of which only 16 were treated with eltrombopag) precludes from reaching 
an accurate conclusion based solely on this study. Interim updated ad-hoc analysis (cut-off date 21-
Oct-2021) from the ongoing phase II TAPER study (CETB115J2411) reinforces such evidence providing 
additional 72 patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis.  
If the two analyses are weighted together, it could be expected a similar efficacy of eltrombopag 
regardless of time since ITP diagnosis.  
Even so, it is considered that evidence submitted through clinical trials (the one which provides the 
greatest robustness) is limited. On the other hand, it is also acknowledged that ITP is a disease with a 
low incidence (1.6 to 3.9 cases per 100,000 per year). In these cases, it is considered that supportive 
data from clinical practice bring added value to complement and confirm the efficacy seen in trials.  
In this regard, effectiveness data provided from real world evidence concurs with efficacy data 
observed form clinical trials as well as confirms the expected off-label used of eltrombopag in daily 
practice. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Two ad-hoc analyses in which eltrombopag efficacy was explored among different patient subgroups by 
time from ITP diagnosis have been provided. Real world evidence of the clinical use of eltrombopag in 
patients with ITP < 6 months from diagnosis has been also provided. 
The  subgroup  analysis  from  the  pivotal  ITP  registration  studies  [TRA100773A],  [TRA100773B], 
[TRA102537/RAISE] and [TRA108057/REPEAT], included 5 adult patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 
41 patients with persistent ITP treated with eltrombopag (specifically 16 patients with < 6 months from 
diagnosis). The updated interim ad-hoc analysis of data from the ongoing TAPER study (CETB115J2411 
study)  included  51  adult  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  ITP  and  39  adult  patients  with  persistent  ITP 
(specifically 72 patients with < 6 months from diagnosis treated with eltrombopag). 
The above presented efficacy data  show favorable effects for eltrombopag, with relevant increases in 
platelet  count  correlated  with  decreases  of  bleeding  events,  irrespective  of  time  from  diagnosis.  No 
relevant differences are observed when compared with the subgroup of patients with < 6 months from 
Assessment report

diagnosis with those with > 6 months. Nonetheless, these results come from ad-hoc analyses with limited 
sample size and have not yet been confirmed specifically by a controlled trial in patients with less than 
6 months from diagnosis. 
Support with data from real world evidence is considered relevant when a high off- label use in clinical 
practice  is  expected,  such  as  in  the  case  of  TPO-AR.  Data  provided  (n=335  patients  with  newly  and 
persistent ITP) show that  eltrombopag seems to be also effective when it is started in earlier stages of 
the disease and confirm that there is an already off-label use of eltrombopag in patients with less than 
6 months from diagnosis when response failure to first line therapy is confirmed, which is not unexpected 
according to what it is stablished in current guidelines (Neunert et al, 2019; Provan et al, 2019). Although 
it must be taken into account that robust evidence that can be drawn from routine clinical settings is 
limited,  and  that,  consequently,  interpretation  of  data  should  be  done  with  caution,  results  show  the 
achievement of clinically relevant platelet responses in a considerable proportion of patients with newly 
and persistent ITP (ranged from 67%-to 90%), in line with what has been observed in ad-hoc analysis 
from clinical trials. 
To conclude, although it is considered that a greater effort could have been done by the MAH to 
generate a more robust evidence, especially in a context of 10 years post-marketing period, the 
evidence provided is sufficient to conclude that eltrombopag effect is similar irrespective of time from 
ITP diagnosis. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of eltrombopag in ITP lasting more than 6 months from diagnosis was described in the 
original marketing authorisation application and remains unchanged. 
According to the SmPC, up to now, the most important known serious adverse reactions in adults were 
thrombotic/thromboembolic events and hepatotoxicity (generally mild but requiring monitoring of 
transaminase levels before and after starting treatment) and potential unfavourable effects of bone 
marrow fibrosis and malignancies that cannot be ruled out with the available data. The most common 
adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included nausea, diarrhoea, increased alanine 
aminotransferase and back pain. 
As  the  basis  of  this  application,  the  company  also  provides  safety  results  from  two  ad-hoc  analyses 
presented  by  time  since  diagnosis:  1)  ITP  registration  studies  (extension  study  EXTEND);  2)  Interim 
analysis of ongoing phase II study CETB115J2411 (cut-off date of 15-Oct-2020). 
Additional safety data can be extracted from submitted real world evidence of the use of eltrombopag in 
clinical practice. 
Safety data from completed clinical studies in adult ITP patients (EXTEND study) 
Three  hundred  and  two  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  eltrombopag  and  were  included  in  the 
safety  population  of  EXTEND  study,  of  which  19  were  patients  with  ITP  less  than  6  months  from 
diagnosis (16 treated with eltrombopag; 5 patients with <3 months since ITP diagnosis and 11 patients 
with 3 to <6 months since ITP diagnosis).  
Adverse events were reported by ≥74% of patients on eltrombopag, with similar frequencies reported 
across the ITP categories. The proportion of patients who reported at least one adverse event was 80% 
(4/5), 81.8% (9/11), 76.7% (23/30) and 74% (128/173) for patients with an ITP duration of <3 months 
(newly diagnosed ITP), 3 to <6 months, 6 to 12 months (persistent ITP), and >12 months (chronic ITP),

respectively.  The company should provide a summarize table of the reported frequencies across the ITP 
categories where the mentioned percentages are reflected/justified. 
The most frequent adverse events for the subset of patients included in these analyses were provided in 
the  application  [Appendix  1  Table  1-16],  [Appendix  1  Table  2-16],  [Appendix  1  Table  3-16]  and 
[Appendix  1  Table  4-16] 
for 
[TRA100773A], 
[TRA100773B], 
[TRA102537/RAISE]  and 
[TRA108057/REPEAT], respectively. The company also provided summarised tables of adverse events 
by time since ITP diagnosis in the EXTEND study, in line with the summary safety tables provided for 
study CETB115J2411. 
Study CETB115J2411 (TAPER) 
On the other hand, 82 patients were included in the safety population of the ad-hoc analysis of study 
CETB115J2411 (cut-off  15  October  2020);  of  which  56 had  less  than  6  months  from  diagnosis;  38 
with <3 months since ITP diagnosis and 18 with 3 to <6 months since ITP diagnosis). 
Safety results from this ad-hoc analysis are presented using the Safety Set which included all patients 
who received at least one dose of eltrombopag. Only descriptive analyses were performed. The safety 
analyses are presented until Month 6.  
Patient exposure 
The median (25-75th percentile) duration of exposure to study treatment was 6.01 months (5.91-6.05) 
with a median exposure of 6.01 months in all ITP categories (Table 21). 
The  median  (25-75th  percentile)  actual  dose  intensity  was  51.3  mg/day  (10.7-67.9)  for  patients  with 
newly diagnosed ITP, 46.6 (25.7-67.6) in persistent ITP (3 to <6 months), 63.9 (32.4-73.0) in persistent 
ITP (6 to ≤12 months), and 56.3 (22.6-69.5) in chronic ITP.

Adverse events 
The majority of patients (84.1%, range 70.0% - 94.4 across ITP categories) had at least one adverse 
event  (AE)  (Table  22).  The  percentage of  patients  with  treatment-related  AEs  ranged  from  18.8%  to 
50.0% across ITP categories. 
Fifteen patients (18.3%, range 0 - 22.2% across ITP categories) had at least one serious adverse event 
(SAE).  The  percentage  of  patients  with  treatment-related  SAEs  was  also  comparable  across  ITP 
categories (3.7%, range 0 -12.5%). 
The overall rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation and dose adjustment/interruption was also 
comparable in all ITP categories.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of two patients died by the cut-off date in Groups A (patients with newly diagnosed ITP) and B 
(patients with 3 to <6 months from ITP diagnosis), respectively. These on-treatment deaths were caused 
by  central  nervous  system  haemorrhage  and  intracranial  haemorrhage.  These  deaths  were  not 
considered related to eltrombopag by the investigator. 
Although not submitted within the documentation of this application, deaths narratives were provided at 
the moment of the pre-submission meeting: 
  Patient  
An elderly patient who first relapsed 3 months after diagnosis after receiving first line steroid therapy. 
At the time of study-entry, the patient’s medical history reported ongoing benign prostatic hyperplasia, 
diabetes  as  well  as  hypercholesterolemia.  The  past  medical  history  included  prior  conditions  of 
myocardial  infarction  and  stent  placement,  for  which  the  patient  received  ecopirin,  PLANOR  and 
clopidogrel but all treatments were discontinued prior to study start. 
The  patient  received  the  first  dose  of  eltrombopag  50  mg  QD  on  13-Feb-2020  (Study  Day  1)  with  a 
platelet count of 1 x 109/L. On 20-Feb-2020 (Study Day 8), the patient had a platelet count of 0 G/L 
and experienced a SAE Grade 4 Upper GI bleed and was treated with IVIG and pantoprazole. The upper 
GI bleed resolved on 23-Feb-2020 (Study Day 11). 
The patient remained on eltrombopag 50 mg for 14 days before being increased, as per protocol, to a 
dose of 75 mg QD on 27-Feb-2020 (Study Day 15) when the platelets were reported as 22 G/L. The 75 
mg QD dose was maintained for 7 days before being reduced, as per protocol, to 50 mg QD on 05-Mar-
2020 (Study Day 22) when the platelets reached 304 G/L. 
After 7 days at a dose of 50 mg QD, the eltrombopag treatment was interrupted, as per protocol, on 12-
Mar-2020  (Study  Day  29)  when  the  platelets  reached  1139  G/L.  After  a  treatment  interruption  of  15 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 59/82 
 
 
 
 
 
days,  eltrombopag  treatment  was  restarted  on  27-Mar-2020  (Study  Day  44)  at  50  mg  QD  when  the 
platelets dropped to 79 G/L. 
The patient had been on 50 mg QD for 4 days when he was hospitalized on 30-Mar-2020 (Study Day 
47) due to low platelet count (8 G/L) for which he received methylprednisolone on 31- Mar-2020 (Study 
Day 48) for three days and IVIG on 02-Apr-2020 (Study Day 50). 
The platelets further dropped three days later to 1 G/L and the eltrombopag dose was increased to 75 
mg QD on 03-Apr-2020 (Study Day 51). On 06-Apr-2020 (Study Day 54) the patient experienced central 
nervous system (CNS) bleeding and died that same day. 
In total, the patient received eltrombopag for 39 days. The fatal event was reported to be due to CNS 
bleeding  and  low  platelet  count.  Both  events  were  assessed  as  not  suspected  to  be  related  to 
eltrombopag by the investigator. 
  Patient: 
An young adult patient initially diagnosed on 01-Jun-2019, who first relapsed on 19-Aug-2019 following 
first-line steroid treatment. The medical history reported a prior condition of menorrhagia. 
At screening the patient had a platelet count of 27 G/L and she received the first dose of eltrombopag 
50 mg QD on 16-Sep-2019 (Study Day 1). The dose of 50 mg QD was maintained for 14 days until the 
platelet count dropped to 8 G/L on 30-Sep-2019 (Study Day 15) and the eltrombopag dose was then 
increased, as per protocol, to 75 mg QD. 
The patient remained on 75 mg QD for 44 days and continued experiencing Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
with platelet counts remaining below 8 G/L throughout. 
The  patient’s  physician  decided  to  discontinue  the  treatment  on  12-Nov-2019 (Study  Day  58)  due  to 
lack of response and a platelet count of 2 G/L at the End of Treatment visit on 13-Nov- 2019. The patient 
also experienced Grade 2 menorrhagia on 13-Nov-2019 (Study Day 59/ End of treatment day). In total, 
the patient received eltrombopag for 58 days. 
During the 30-day safety follow-up period, the patient experienced fatal intracranial hemorrhage 8 days 
after the last dose of eltrombopag. The fatal event was reported to be due to intracranial hemorrhage 
and was assessed as not suspected to be related to eltrombopag by the investigator. 
MAH conclusion 
The MAH concludes that eltrombopag is well tolerated in ITP patients and has a well-established safety 
profile based on the safety data that supported the regulatory approval in adult and paediatric immune 
thrombocytopenia (ITP), HCV-associated thrombocytopenia, severe aplastic anemia (SAA), as well as on 
the  extensive  post-marketing  data  since  the  initial  approval  in  the  EU  in  2010.  The  cumulative  post-
marketing exposure to eltrombopag was calculated as 372,128 patient-years. 
The two ad-hoc analyses presented by time since diagnosis also demonstrated that the safety profile of 
eltrombopag was comparable across all ITP categories. The majority of the AEs were in accordance with 
the  known  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  and  their  incidence  rates  were  comparable  across  the  ITP 
categories. 
Safety data from Real World Evidence 
The MAH has provided Real World Evidence of the eltrombopag safety through literature review. 
Results from 7 published studies (3 prospective and 4 retrospective), rated by the company as the most 
relevant  found,  were  provided  (Tripathi  et  al  2014;  Lucchini  et  al  2021;  González-López  et  al  2017; 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 60/82 
 
 
 
Rivolti et al 2019; Iino et al 2020; Tran et al 2017; Moulis et al 2021). For more details of such studies, 
refer to previous Efficacy section: ‘Effectiveness data from Real World Evidence’. 
Summary of the main safety results from those studies are displayed below: 
Prospective studies 
Tripathi et al 2014 
The goal of this study was to assess response to eltrombopag in 25 adult and adolescent patients (median 
age 27 years, range 15-55 years) with newly diagnosed ITP who were refractory to corticosteroids.  
None of the patients responded to prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. These patients 
were given 50 mg/day of eltrombopag, and prednisolone was gradually tapered and discontinued within 
2 weeks.  
Six (24%) patients had mild headache on eltrombopag treatment but did not necessitate any treatment. 
Three (12%) patients had mild increases in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) levels. 
Tran et al 2017 
The aim of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of eltrombopag in patients with newly diagnosed 
and persistent ITP within 6 months of diagnosis. Thirty-nine adult ITP patients (median age 52 years) 
who  were  refractory  to  prior  therapy  were  enrolled  and  treated  with  eltrombopag  for  12  weeks.  The 
median  (Q1,  Q3)  time  from  diagnosis  was  2.2 months  (1.1,  5.4 months).  Prior  therapies  included 
corticosteroids (95% of patients), IVIg (58% of patients), and immunosuppression (28% of patients). 
The starting dose of eltrombopag ranged from 50 mg to 75 mg/day, depending on the baseline platelet 
count. The median dose at Week 12 was 50 mg/day. Thirty-six (92.3%) patients completed 12 weeks 
of treatment, while 3 (7.7%) patients discontinued earlier (2 patients required a new ITP therapy and 1 
patient developed thrombocytosis). 
Two patients had SAEs of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis at a platelet count 97 G/L; 
pulmonary embolism at a platelet count of 240 G/L). There were no other AEs or deaths. 
In conclusion, the study showed that eltrombopag was generally well tolerated and in patients with newly 
diagnosed and persistent ITP within 6 months from diagnosis. 
Lucchini et al 2021 
This prospective, multi-center phase 2 trial evaluated eltrombopag in 51 adult patients with primary ITP 
(22 with newly diagnosed ITP and 29 with persistent ITP) who were refractory to or relapsed after first-
line therapy. The study was divided into period of treatment (PT) from Week 1 to Week 24, period of 
tapering and discontinuation (PTD) from Week 25 up to Week 32, and period of observation (PO) of 24 
weeks starting from eltrombopag discontinuation. 
Twenty-three  patients  (45%)  reported  a  total  of  51  AEs  and  16  SAEs.  Five  AEs  were  considered 
treatment-related:  deep  vein  thrombosis  (n=1),  nausea  (n=2),  hypertransaminasemia  (n=1)  and 
diarrhea  (n=1).  Eltrombopag  was  interrupted  because  of  toxicity  in  three  patients  (6%): 
hypertransaminasemia, deep vein thrombosis and acute myeloid leukemia.  
There were 3 cases of thrombosis (6%). The first was a posterior tibial DVT developed nearly two months 
after treatment was started, while patient was receiving 75 mg/day of eltrombopag and platelet count 
was 20 G/L. Two patients experienced acute myocardial infarction: one patient was receiving 75 mg/day 
and the other was receiving 25 mg/day of eltrombopag; the event occurred four months after starting 
treatment in both cases and platelet count was 95 and 209 G/L, respectively. Both patients died because

of this thrombotic complication. Among these three thrombotic events, only the DVT was considered by 
the investigators related to eltrombopag. 
Five bleeding events were reported: one grade 3 retinal hemorrhage at Week 1; two grade 2 epistaxis: 
one  at  Week  14  and  one  at  Week  28;  one  grade  1  menorrhagia  at  Week  38;  one  grade  1  mucosal 
bleeding at Week 10. For the last three events, patients were off treatment. 
  Retrospective studies 
González-López et al 2017 
This was a retrospective study of 220 adult patients with ITP, including 30 patients with newly diagnosed 
ITP (up to 3 months from diagnosis), 30 patients with persistent ITP (more than 3 months to up to 12 
months from diagnosis), and 160 patients with chronic ITP (more than 12 months from diagnosis.  
After 15 months of follow-up, 70 (31.8%) patients reported AEs during eltrombopag treatment, most of 
them  were  mild  to  moderate  with  15  patients  reporting  grade  3–4  AEs.  There  were  no  significant 
differences in the proportion of patients with AEs among the ITP categories. 
Three grade 3-4-events occurred in newly diagnosed ITP: one brain haemorrhage in a patient with no 
response to eltrombopag, one sudden death in a patient with a background of cardiac arrhythmia, and 
one  bilateral  pneumonia  in  al  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  patient.  All  these  three  patients 
died. Two persistent ITP cases suffered serious adverse events, one massive stroke with ITP in CR in a 
carotid stenosis who died 3 days later and one haemorrhage in a non-responding patient who survived. 
Ten serious adverse events were recorded in chronic ITP group. Eight of them died because of them; 
three secondary neoplasms, three sever upper respiratory tract infections, one sudden death in a patient 
with  a  background  of  acute  myocardial  infarct  and  on  stroke  in  a  patient  who  suffered  from  atrial 
fibrillation. The remaining two patients recovered from the brain haemorrhages. 
Most common adverse effects were headache and hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities (HBLAs). One 
persistent  ITP  had  a  venous  thrombosis  and  on  chronic  ITP  had  a  grade  II  myelofibrosis  but  after 
cessation of eltrombopag. 
Rivolti et al 2019 
The goal of this retrospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of TPO-RAs in newly diagnosed, 
persistent  and  chronic  ITP.  Out  of  28  adult  patients  (median  aged  61  years),  6 patients  had  newly 
diagnosed ITP, 4 had persistent ITP and 18 had chronic ITP. Twenty-one patients received eltrombopag, 
and  7  patients  received  eltrombopag  and  romiplostim  sequentially  (5  patients  switched  from 
eltrombopag to romiplostim and 2 patients switched from romiplostim to eltrombopag). Median duration 
of treatment was 8 months (range: 1-76) for eltrombopag and 4 months (range: 1-21) for romiplostim. 
Six (21%) patients experienced Grade 3-4 AEs: 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 acute myocardial infarction, 
1 deep vein thrombosis, and 2 headaches. Four patients died of other causes, the details of which were 
not provided in the publication.

This retrospective real-world evidence analysis was designed to assess the use, efficacy and safety of 
eltrombopag  in  adult  ITP  patients  treated  with  eltrombopag  within  6  months of  ITP  diagnosis.  It  was 
based on data from the French CARMEN registry that included 799 ITP patients. One-hundred fifty-six 
(19.5%) patients were treated with eltrombopag, out of whom 95 (60.9%) patients were treated during 
the first 6 months of ITP (newly diagnosed and persistent ITP). The mean age was 60.5 years; 52.6% 
were  men;  34.7%  had  ≥1  comorbidity  of  the  Charlson  Comorbidity  Index  (CCI);  58.9%  had  at  ≥1 
cardiovascular risk factor (not including age and sex).

Overall, 17 ADRs were reported in 16 (16.8%) patients; thrombocytosis (n=5), venous thrombosis (n=6: 
4 pulmonary embolism, 1 deep vein thrombosis, 1 superficial vein thrombosis), rash (n=3), hepatitis, 
gastrointestinal discomfort, and diarrhea (n=1 each). 
Iino et al 2020 
This  observational  retrospective  analysis  was  conducted  using  data  from  real-world  clinical  practice. 
Seventy-seven adult ITP patients (median age 69, range 17-92 years) were treated with TPO-RAs, out 
of whom 64 patients received eltrombopag (median dose 25 mg, range 12.5-50 mg) and 13 patients 
received romiplostim. Most of the patients had newly diagnosed ITP 50 (65%), 5 (6%) of patient had 
persistent ITP and 22 (29%) of patients had chronic ITP. 
AEs were reported in 38 (49%) patients during treatment with TPO-RAs, and in 12 (38%) patients during 
the  treatment-free  period.  Frequent  adverse  events (two  patients  each)  were  insomnia,  nausea,  skin 
rash, oral candidiasis, oral submucosal hemorrhage, liver transaminase elevation, and hyperglycemia; 
however, these adverse events were not serious. Serious adverse events were observed during the TPO-
RA  treatment  period,  and  they  included  single  cases  of  cerebellar  infarction  after  5  months  on 
eltrombopag, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and worsening of abdominal aortic aneurysm after 1.2 years 
on eltrombopag. There were no fatal AEs in the study. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To support the safety of eltrombopag in patients with ITP ≤ 6 months from diagnosis no new completed 
clinical trials have been submitted. The MAH also rely on data derived from from two ad-hoc analyses 
presented by time since diagnosis: 1) ITP registration studies (extension study EXTEND) in which 19/302 
patients  had  <6  months  since  ITP  diagnosis  (16  treated  with  eltrombopag);  2)  Interim  analysis  of 
ongoing phase II TAPER study (CETB115J2411 study) (updated cut-off date of 21-Oct-2021) in which 
72 patients had <6 months since ITP diagnosis and were treated with eltrombopag. Supportive safety 
data from the real-world evidence have been also provided. 
The  safety  population  of  both  analyses  included  patients  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
eltrombopag. 
The EXTEND study was intended to assess eltrombopag long-term safety and tolerability. The overall 
safety results from EXTEND study were previously already submitted. Within this procedure, the MAH 
breaks down the results by subgroups of time from diagnosis (ad-hoc analysis). Although very limited 
sample size, data from 16 included eltrombopag treated patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis 
do  not  seem  to  reveal  any  specific  pattern  or  safety  concern  when  compared  with  patients  with  >6 
months.  The  MAH  has  provided  summarised  tables  of  adverse  events  by  time  since  diagnosis  as 
requested. The type of adverse events more commonly reported in patients with less 6 months from ITP 
diagnosis (fatigue, constipation, headache and nasopharyngitis) are already known and manageable in 
clinical practice. 
In the initial ad-hoc analysis of TAPER study (CETB115J2411 study) (cut-off date: 15-Oct-2020), 
the included patients (N=82, of which 56 patients had < 6 months from diagnosis) had a comparable 
duration  of  exposure  to  eltrombopag  with  a  median  exposure  of  6.01  months  for  all  the  subgroups. 
62.2% (51/82) of the patients had received >=6 months of eltrombopag treatment. 
Analysis of adverse events in the ad-hoc analysis showed similar rates between all the ITP subgroups 
[81.6% (31/38) (<3 months) ,94.4% (17/18) (3 to <6 months); 87.5% (14/16) (6 to ≤12 months) and 
70% (7/10) (>12 months)]. With regards to treatment-related adverse events no increase was seen in 
patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis [21,1% (8/38) (<3 months), 38.9% (7/18) (3 to <6 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 63/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months); 18.8% (3/16) (6 to ≤12 months) and 50.0% (5/10) (>12 months)]. Treatment-related SAEs 
was also comparable across ITP categories [2.6% (1/38)(<3 months), 0 % (3 to <6 months); 12.5% 
(2/16) (6 to ≤12 months) 0% (>12 months)]; as well as treatment-related adverse events leading to 
discontinuation [0% (<3 months); 0% (3 to <6 months); 6.3% (1/16) (6 to ≤12 months); 0% (>12 
months) or treatment-related adverse events leading to dose adjustment/interruption [7.9% (3/38)(<3 
months); 11.1% (2/18) (3 to <6 months); 12,5% (2/16) (6 to ≤12 months); 20% (2/10) (>12 months). 
No relevant differences were neither observed in treatment-related adverse events requiring additional 
therapy  [10.5%  (4/38)  (<3  months);  22.2%  (4/18)  (3  to  <6  months);  12.5%  (2/16)  (6  to  ≤12 
months);10% (1/10) (>12 months)]. 
The reported adverse events concur with the already known ones for eltrombopag. The most common 
adverse events (>10% in all patients) were headache (18.4% vs. 22.2% vs. 12.5% vs. 10.0%), and 
thrombocytopenia (21.1% vs. 16.7% vs. 12.5% vs 0%) in newly diagnosed to chronic ITP, respectively. 
With less frequency, other common reported adverse events were hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities, 
nauseas, diarrhoea, asthenia, epistaxis and petechiae. 
In  the  updated  ad-hoc  analysis  (cut-off  date:  21-Oct-2021),  the  inclusion  of  23  additional  patients 
(N=105, of which 72 had ITP< 6 months), do not significantly modify the previously observed safety 
results.  Incidence  of  TEAE  (29.4%  [15/51],  47.6%  [10/21],  33.3%  [6/18],  46.7%  [7/15])  and 
treatment-related SAEs (3.9% [2/51], 0%, 16.7% [3/18], 0%) continue without differing greatly across 
ITP  categories  in  newly  diagnosed  to  chronic  ITP,  respectively.  The  overall  rate  of  treatment-related 
adverse events leading to discontinuation and of dose adjustment/interruption were also comparable in 
all ITP categories. The most commonly reported adverse events (>10% in all patients) continued to be 
headache  (17.6%  vs.  38.1%  vs.  11.1.%  vs.  20.0%),  and  thrombocytopenia  (21.6%  vs.  23.8%  vs. 
11.1% vs 0%) in newly diagnosed to chronic ITP, respectively. 
Safety data from Real World Evidence: the MAH has carried out a literature review and has provided 
reference to 7 recent observational studies (3 prospective and 4 retrospectives studies) which explored 
the safety of eltrombopag in patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis when used in routine clinical 
settings. Although with limited robustness, the safety profile of eltrombopag observed in patients less 
than  6  months  from  diagnosis  (n≈  335  patients  with  newly  and  persistent  ITP)  seems  similar  when 
compared to patients with a longer time from diagnosis, and the type of reported adverse events are 
overall  in  line  with  the  already  known  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag.  Frequently  reported  non-serious 
AES were headache and hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities. 
More frequently reported SAEs were related to thrombosis complications and hemorrhages events.  
Initially,  two  deaths  in  patients  with  <6  months  from  diagnosis  were  reported  in  TAPER  study  (on-
treatment deaths due to central nervous system haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage), one with 
newly diagnosed ITP and other in the subgroup of 3 to < 6 months from ITP diagnosis.  
Despite the investigator did not consider the two deaths related to eltrombopag, they could be considered 
as lack of efficacy. Since haemorrhages events due to lack of efficacy are also described in the submitted 
literature  and 12,2%  (10/82)  of  the  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  in TAPER 
study [(21,1% (8/38) in ITP < 3 months and 5,6% (1/18) in ITP < 6 months)], the MAH was requested 
to discuss death events and its relation with the lack of efficacy rates observed in TAPER study (1º cut-
off date) and compared them with data from pivotal studies and literature. Moreover, a common adverse 
event reported in TAPER study was thrombocytopenia (21.1% vs. 16.7% vs. 12.5% vs 0%) in newly 
diagnosed to chronic ITP, which could also be attributed to lack of efficacy. The MAH was requested to 
discuss its relation with lack of efficacy rates and an adequate response was provided. 
Regarding thrombocytopenia events, although a higher rate is continued to be observed in early phases 
of  the  disease  in  the  updated  analysis  [(21.6%  (11/51)  vs.  23.8%  (5/21)  vs.  11.1%  (2/18)  vs.  0% 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 64/82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively], it is acknowledged that, of these events, the most relevant ones (Grade 3), were similarly 
distributed across ITP categories. Moreover, the MAH points out that, in addition to a likely reporting 
bias,  the  majority  of  thrombocytopenia  events  occurred  during  the  first  14  days  after  starting 
eltrombopag with similar probability of happening across ITP categories. In this regard, it is admitted 
that this two-week period may be considered as the most likely period for observing isolated low platelet 
counts because of the likelihood that a full treatment effect has not been yet obtained, specially taking 
in to account the overall high response rates achieved by week 9 (84.3% (ITP duration <3 months), 
90.5% (ITP duration 3 to <6 months). 
On the other hand, in the updated analysis two additional deaths were also reported (1 on-treatment 
death in the 6 to <12 months subgroup and 1 post-treatment death in the chronic subgroup), both due 
underlying malignancies. 
In summary, when a comparison is made, deaths for haemorrhage were reported in 1.9% (2 deaths) of 
the  105  eltrombopag-treated  patients  enrolled  in  the  TAPER  study  and  0%  of  the  365  eltrombopag-
treated patients enrolled in the four ITP registration studies. 
Since in the literature, it is stated that the frequency of death from haemorrhage in ITP patients with 
platelet counts <30 G/L is estimated to be between 1.6 and 3.9% per patient-year, influenced by several 
factors and since in both of the reported deaths from TAPER study the patient had loss the response to 
eltrombopag and their platelets counts were not stabilized, there seems to be a consistency between the 
reported  rates  in  the  study  and  literature.  Nonetheless,  beyond  that,  the  sample  size  and  design  of 
TAPER study precludes to reach any conclusion about the association with the risk of haemorrhage and 
the ITP chronological stage of the disease. 
Thus, events suggesting lack of efficacy from TAPER study cannot be viewed as conclusive. However, 
weighting  them  up  with  the  overall  high  response  rates  and  the  decrease  in  the  rates  of  bleeding 
observed in the study, they can be viewed as not concerning.  
Another aspect that should be also pointed out is that, although not specifically in ITP patients in the 
early stages of disease, bone marrow reticulin fibrosis risk have been already assessed with the long-
term use of eltrombopag 
The risk for development or progression of reticulin fibres within the bone marrow with TPO-AR treatment 
is already known thought its relevance has not been not clearly elucidated. Current product information 
of eltrombopag already warns about the need of taking into account this potential risk and states that 
analysis to detect cellular morphologic abnormalities should be perform prior to treatment initiation and 
periodically  after.  It  is  also  stated  that  treatment  discontinuation  and  bone  marrow  biopsy  should  be 
considered in patients who develop new or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia. 
Moreover, although limited, safety results provided in this procedure (from EXTEND and TAPER analyses) 
do not suggest an increase of this risk in patients with <6 months from diagnosis. Thus, having this in 
regard and taking into consideration that the risk of bone marrow reticulin formation will be continuously 
assess  through  periodically  PSURs,  it  is  considered  that  no  additional  measures  are  necessary  in  this 
regard, beyond the already included warning in product information. 
No pharmacovigilance data from this population have been provided. Although pharmacovigilance data 
could have been useful to support the remaining safety data provided, it is acknowledged that 
available pharmacovigilance data so far (including its off-label use), have already been periodically 
assessed and will continue to be assessed in the future through PSURs. 
In summary, the data provided from ad-hoc analyses show that eltrombopag safety profile seems to 
be similar for all the ITP subgroups, irrespective of time form diagnosis.  
Of  note,  although  expected  to  be  comparable,  no  long-term  safety  data  have  been  provided  for  the 
Assessment report

subgroup of patients with < 6 months from diagnosis within this procedure. Neither the updated ad-hoc 
analysis of TAPER study (J2411 study), nor the patients included in EXTEND study, provide long-term 
safety data beyond 6.5 months of treatment. 
However, the long-term safety of eltrombopag is already known from studies conducted in patients >6 
months  from  ITP  diagnosis,  showing  an  acceptable  safety  profile.  Although  it  is  disappointed  that  no 
more  efforts  were  made  by  the  company  to  generate  evidence  in  this  population,  since  eltrombopag 
safety profile is expected to be similar in ITP patients, regardless time from diagnosis, no more data are 
requested in this regard. 
Lastly, as stated in the efficacy section, limited sample size and the uncontrolled character of most of 
the body of data, preclude a robust interpretation of results based solely on clinical trials, being necessary 
to  also  take  into  account  as  supportive,  the  real-world  evidence  provided.  In  this  regard,  submitted 
safety  data  from  real-world  evidence  are  overall  in  line  with  the  already  known  safety  profile  of 
eltrombopag.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The two ad-hoc analyses presented (n=88 patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis and treated 
with eltrombopag) show that the safety profile of eltrombopag seems comparable across all ITP 
categories, i.e., irrespective of time from diagnosis. The majority of the reported AEs were in 
accordance with the known safety profile of eltrombopag and their incidence rates showed no relevant 
differences in patients with < 6 months from diagnosis when compared with those with more than 6 
months.  
Although expected to be comparable, no long-term safety data (beyond 6 months) have been provided 
for the subgroup of patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis within this procedure. Neither the 
updated  ad-hoc  analysis  of  TAPER  study  (J2411  study),  nor  the  patients  included  in  EXTEND  study, 
provides long-term safety data beyond 6.5 months.  
However, the long-term safety of eltrombopag is already known from studies conducted in patients >6 
months  from  ITP  diagnosis,  showing  an  acceptable  safety  profile  Since  eltrombopag  safety  profile  is 
expected to be similar in ITP patients regardless time from diagnosis, no more data are requested in this 
regard. 
The limited sample size and the uncontrolled character of the most of the body of data, preclude a 
robust interpretation of results based solely on clinical trials, being necessary to also take into account 
as supportive, the real-world evidence provided. In this regard, the MAH has provided 7 literature 
reports from real-world studies as supportive evidence (n≈ 335 patients). Although with limited 
robustness, the safety profile of eltrombopag observed in patients less than 6 months from diagnosis 
seems similar when compared to patients with a longer time from diagnosis, and the type of reported 
adverse events are overall in line with the already known safety profile of eltrombopag.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Immune  (idiopathic)  thrombocytopenia  (ITP)  is  an  autoimmune  disorder  characterised  by  a  low 
circulating  platelet  count  (thrombocytopenia),  decreased  platelet  production  and  increased  platelet 
destruction. Thrombocytopenia places patients at risks for bruising, mucocutaneous bleeding and more 
seriously intracranial haemorrhage; although bleeding symptoms may not always be present. Diagnosis 
of ITP is one of exclusion, when the history, physical examination, complete blood count and examination 
of peripheral blood smear do not suggest other aetiology for the thrombocytopenia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 69/82 
 
 
 
 
 
Before 2009, ITP was categorised based on the length of time from initial diagnosis into acute ITP, which 
lasted for up to 6 months from initial diagnosis, and chronic ITP, which lasted beyond 6 months from 
initial diagnosis (George et al 1996). In 2009, the International Working Group (IWG) released updated 
guidelines (Rodeghiero et al 2009), in which ITP was divided into newly diagnosed ITP (lasting up to 3 
months from diagnosis), persistent ITP (lasting between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis) and chronic 
ITP  (lasting  more  than  12  months  from  diagnosis).  This  classification  was  recently  reaffirmed  by  the 
American Society of Hematology (ASH) (Neunert et al 2019) and a panel of international experts (Provan 
et al 2019). 
Newly diagnosed ITP” was defined as all cases at first diagnosis. A new category, “persistent ITP,” was 
introduced  which  included  patients  not  reaching  spontaneous  remission  or  not  maintaining  complete 
response  off  therapy  between  3  to  12  months  from  diagnosis.  The  IWG  noted  that  the  possibility  of 
spontaneous remission is significant during this period and deferral of aggressive therapeutic approaches 
(such as splenectomy) should therefore be considered. The term “chronic ITP” was reserved for patients 
with ITP lasting for more than 12 months. 
As part of this application, the proposed indication wording is as follows; additions are shown in bold 
text and deletions are marked in strikethrough (xxx): 
• 
“Revolade is indicated for the treatment of adult patients aged 1 year and above with 
primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).  
•  Revolade  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  aged  1  year  and  above  with 
primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis and who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins).” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are several guidelines including different treatment approaches in ITP, with the updated ASH 2019 
guideline [Neunert et al, 2019] and the updated ICR [Provan et al, 2019] being the more relevant ones. 
Inferences regarding the efficacy of treatments are mainly based on platelet counts as the more reliable 
surrogate  outcome  measure.  The  major  goal  for  treatment  of  ITP  is  to  provide  a  platelet  count  that 
prevents major bleeding rather than correcting the platelet count to normal levels. 
In newly diagnosed ITP (first 3 months), treatment is aimed at rapidly obtaining a safe platelet count (> 
30 x 109/L) to prevent or stop haemorrhages and to ensure an acceptable quality of life, avoiding as 
much as possible treatment-related adverse effects. In both updated guidelines, corticosteroids, unless 
contraindicated, remain the standard initial treatment of newly diagnosed patients, although they should 
be  used  for  a  limited  time  (≤  6  weeks).  Use  of  IV  Ig,  or  IV  anti-D  where  available,  may  be  another 
appropriate first-line treatment in patients with bleeding, at high risk for bleeding, who require a surgical 
procedure, or who are unresponsive or contraindicated to prednisone. 
Most adult patient relapse upon cessation of steroid treatment. Patients still remaining thrombocytopenic 
after  3  months  from  diagnosis  or  initial  treatment  (corticosteroids,  IVIg,  anti-D)  are  classified  in 
persistent (between 3 to 12 months) or chronic (after at least 12 months). 
While the old guidelines did not specifically address patients with persistent ITP (between 3 to 12 months) 
due to lack of robust efficacy/safety data, the updated guidelines propose different treatment approaches 
for  this  refractory  population.  Usual  second-line  treatment  options  are  TPO-RA,  rituximab  and 
splenectomy,  nevertheless,  there  is  no  solid  evidence  that  defines  the  best  strategy.  Each  of  these 
second-line  treatments  may  be  effective  therapy  and  therefore  the  choice  of  treatment  should  be 
individualised based on duration of ITP, frequency of bleeding episodes requiring hospitalisation or rescue

medication,  comorbidities,  age  of  the  patient,  medication  adherence,  medical  and  social  support 
networks, patient values and preferences, cost and availability. 
Available treatment modalities have different mechanisms of action and can be broadly categorised into 
those that are given only once (or for only 1 course) and are intended to induce a long-term response 
(rituximab,  splenectomy)  and  those  that  need  continued  or  chronic  administration  (low-dose 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, TPO-RAs). 
TPO-RAs (eltrombopag, romiplostim) have provided excellent responses (>60%) in splenectomised and 
non-splenectomised patients. Response to continued TPO-RAs persists for up to 6 to 8 years and often 
allows other ITP therapy to be reduced or discontinued. Cessation of treatment will lead to the return of 
thrombocytopenia in most cases, but some patients (10%-30%) may achieve a durable response after 
TPO-RAs are tapered and withdrawn. 
Rituximab shows a response of 60% of patients. Long-term durable responses occur in 20% to 25% of 
adult  patients.  Prior  to  treatment,  hepatitis  B  status  should  be  determined,  and  vaccination  against 
encapsulated gram-positive bacteria should be given. 
Splenectomy provides long-term efficacy in approximately 60% of cases. Nonetheless, splenectomy is 
invasive,  irreversible,  associated  with  postoperative  complications,  and  its  effectiveness  is  currently 
unpredictable,  leading  many  physicians  and  patients  toward  postponement  and  use  of  alternative 
approaches.  Both  guidelines  suggest  that,  if  splenectomy  is  deemed  necessary,  surgery  should  be 
deferred  for  at  least  12  to  24  months  from  diagnosis  (chronic  ITP)  due  to  potential  for  spontaneous 
remission in the first year. 
Fostamatinib represents an option in chronic ITP for adult refractory to the previous treatments. It offers 
an alternative mechanism for reducing platelet destruction; it may provide response rates of 43% but 
stable responses of only 18%. 
Other medical therapies for patients failing previous therapies are immunosuppressive agents, such as 
mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A or azathioprine. Danazol and dapsone are “corticosteroid-sparing” 
agents  that  may  be  particularly  useful  in  some  patients  (e.g.,  those  in  whom  splenectomy  is 
contraindicated  or  if  other  agents  are  unavailable.  Vinca  alkaloids  are  not  a  chronic  therapy  option 
because of neurological toxicity. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No new clinical studies have been provided. Instead, to support the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag 
in patients with ITP ≤ 6 months, the MAH has provided two ad-hoc analyses of subgroups from: 1) ITP 
registration  studies;  2)  Interim  analysis  of  ongoing phase  II    TAPER  study  (study  J2411)  (1st  cut-off 
date  of  15-Oct-2020  [N=85];    and  2nd  updated  cut-off    22-Oct-2021  [N=105]  after  RSI).  In  them 
eltrombopag  efficacy  and  safety  were  explored  among  different  patient  subgroups  by  time  from  ITP 
diagnosis. 
In addition, an updated PK/PD modelling has been provided aimed to evaluate whether the influence of 
time since diagnosis may provide clinically relevant differences in platelet counts in ITP adult patients 
receiving eltrombopag.  
All this has been complemented with real world evidence of the already use of eltrombopag in patients 
with less than 6 months from ITP diagnosis in clinical practice.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
PK/PD modelling show that no clinically relevant changes in platelet count levels were predicted 
between patients with <6 month and ≥6 month diagnosis across the 4 weeks after the start of 
treatment. With the use of eltrombopag irrespective of time from diagnosis, minimal changes are 
expected in platelet count levels, which lack of any clinical relevance. 
Pivotal studies ([TRA100773A], [TRA100773B], [TRA102537/RAISE] and [TRA108057/REPEAT]), which 
support  the  initial  authorisation  of  eltrombopag,  included  patients  with  <  6  months  from  diagnosis. 
Nineteen of the 299 patients included in the ad-hoc analysis from ITP registration studies had < 6 months 
from ITP diagnosis. Specifically, 5 adult patients with newly diagnosed ITP [<3 months from diagnosis] 
and  41  patients  with  persistent  ITP  [3  months  to  <  12 months  from  diagnosis]  were  treated  with 
eltrombopag. In total, 16 patients had less than 6 months from ITP diagnosis and were treated with 
eltrombopag.  
Platelet count responses achieved show that eltrombopag raises platelet counts irrespective of time 
from diagnosis in a relevant proportion of patients. The proportions of responders after up to 6 weeks 
of treatment was 80% (4/5) (newly diagnosed ITP), 45.5% (5/11) (persistent ITP; 3 to <6 months), 
66.7% (20/30) (persistent ITP; 6 to 12 months) and 68.2% (116/170) (chronic ITP).  These 
achieved platelet counts translated into a reduction in bleeding events. 
In the first submitted interim ad-hoc analysis (n=82/105) of the ongoing phase II TAPER study; cut-off 
date of 15-Oct-2020), 56 patients were treated with eltrombopag and have less than 6 months from 
diagnosis (n=38: newly diagnosed ITP; n= 18: 3 to <6 months). In this analysis, platelet count 
responses (≥50×109/L at least once) increased in a relevant proportion of patients (ranged from 
80.0% to 94.4% by Week 9 across all ITP categories). Similar rates were observed for platelet 
threshold of ≥30 ×109/L (ranged from 80.0% to 100%) and for threshold of ≥100 ×109/L (ranged 
from 68.8% to 80.0%). Results from supportive efficacy endpoints, which reflect more sustained or 
durable responses, also showed favorable results for eltrombopag treatment (ranging from 68.8% to 
83.3% across the ITP categories). 
With respect to bleeding events, results were also in line with those from ad-hoc analysis from parent 
studies; the proportion of patients without bleeding increased during eltrombopag treatment in all ITP 
categories at Week 4: newly diagnosed ITP [patients without bleeding increased from 39.5% (15/38) at 
baseline to 84.8% (28/33)], 3 to <6 months [from 61.1% (11/18) to 94.4% (17/18)], 6 to ≤12 months 
[from 50.0% (8/16) to 86.7% (13/15)] and >12 months [from 70.0% (7/10) to 100% (9/9).  
In the second analysis submitted (n=105; cut-off date: 21-Oct-2021), 51 patients fell in the category of 
newly diagnosed ITP (< 3 months) and 21 belonged to the category of persistent ITP (3 to <6 months). 
Efficacy results did not differ from those observed in the previous analysis. The proportion of patients 
achieving platelet counts levels ≥50 G/L at least once by Week 9 was high and comparable across ITP 
categories  by  time  since  diagnosis  (ranging  from  84.3%  to  94.4%).  High  response  rates  were  also 
observed for the platelet count threshold of ≥30 G/L (ranged from 88.2% to 100%) and for ≥100 
G/L  threshold  (ranging  from  72.2%  to  86.7%)  across  ITP  categories.  Similarly,  more  durable 
response rates (response rates ≥50 G/L on at least 6 out of 8 consecutive assessments in the first 6 
months on study without rescue therapy) were observed, ranging from 70.6% to 81.0% across the 
ITP categories. 
Those increases in platelet counts continue to translate to the relevant benefit, which is reduced bleeding 
rates across the ITP categories. 
Effectiveness data through literature review from recent real-world evidence (period time from 2014 till 
2021)  show  that  eltrombopag  is  frequently  used-off  label  during  clinical  practice  in  patients  with  <  6 
months once lack of response to first-line has been confirmed. Data from ≈335 patients provided show 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 72/82 
 
 
 
the achievement of clinically relevant platelet responses in a considerable proportion of patients with < 
6 months from diagnosis (ranged from 67%-90%] suggesting that the effect is the same regardless of 
time since diagnosis. The majority of the publications also report a decrease in bleeding rates and some 
of them also report a decrease in the use of rescue medication or concomitant ITP therapy. Since these 
results are in line with those achieved in ad-hoc analyses from clinical trials, they can be considered as 
supportive.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Regarding the PK/PD model, the unbalanced proportion of patients with time since diagnosis <6 
months could affect the final conclusion obtained. Therefore, the current population PK/PD model 
should be considered of low-impact (descriptive) for supporting the current extension of indication.  
Favourable effects observed come from ad-hoc analyses and have not yet been confirmed specifically 
by a controlled trial in patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis. 
The number of subjects with ITP ≤ 6 months included in the ad-hoc analysis from pivotal trials, which 
provide the greatest robustness, is limited (n=19 patients; 16 treated with eltrombopag). This number 
is  even  more  limited  when  analysing  more  restricted  subgroups  regarding  time  from  diagnosis  (<  3 
months: 5 patients; ≥ 3 to < 6 months: 11 patients). This limited sample size must be taken into account 
when interpreting the results (especially in the comparison made with the placebo group, where only 3 
patients had < 6 months from diagnosis). 
Due to the fact that parent studies did not collect patient data at time of diagnosis, data were analysed 
through the open label study TRA105325/EXTEND, which included patients from the parent studies that 
continued treatment until eltrombopag became commercially available and where time from diagnosis 
was collected. As an open study, its robustness is limited, particularly when subgroup ad-hoc analyses 
are attempted. 
Regarding updated ad-hoc analysis of the ongoing phase II TAPER study (CETB115J2411; cut-off date 
of 21-Oct-2021), 72 patients treated with eltrombopag had ≤ 6 months from diagnosis. Although 
favourable effects were also observed, limitations of a non-controlled study (single-arm) should be 
kept in mind as they hind the assessment of causality of the treatment effect and therefore, results 
should be interpreted with caution. The MAH has provided, as requested, the study protocol, SAP and 
in-depth details of the ad-hoc statistical analysis, since this documentation had not been previously 
provided within this procedure. 
Data from real-world evidence show the same trend as data from clinical trials and can be considered as 
supportive.  Robust  evidence  that  can  be  drawn  from  routine  clinical  setting  is  limited,  and  therefore, 
interpretation  of  data  must  be  done  with  caution.  Single  arm  studies,  small  sample  sizes,  potential 
selection  bias  in  retrospective  studies  or  concomitant  treatment  used  as  rescue  therapy  influencing 
response rates, are aspects, among other, that should be kept in mind when data are interpreted. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of the product are already included in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the approved 
SmPC. The safety profile of eltrombopag in the population of subjects with ITP < 6 months seems similar 
to that observed in the ITP ≥ 6 months population with no relevant differences between them. 
The majority of the reported AEs in the ad-hoc analyses were in accordance with the known safety profile 
of eltrombopag and their incidence rates showed no relevant differences in patients with < 6 months 
from diagnosis when compared with those ≥ than 6 months: 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 73/82 
 
 
 
In the EXTEND study, data from 16 included eltrombopag treated patients with less than 6 months from 
diagnosis do not seem to reveal any specific pattern or safety concern when compared with patients with 
>6 months. The type of adverse events more commonly reported in patients with less 6 months from 
ITP diagnosis (fatigue, constipation, headache and nasopharyngitis) are manageable in clinical practice. 
In  the  initial  interim  ad-hoc  analysis  of  TAPER  study  (cut-off  date:15-Oct-2020;  n=82,  of  which  56 
patients treated with eltrombopag had ITP< 6 months), adverse events analysis showed similar rates 
between all the ITP subgroups [81.6% (31/38) (<3 months), 94.4% (17/18) (3 to <6 months); 87.5% 
(14/16) (6 to ≤12 months) and 70% (7/10) (>12 months)]. With regards to treatment-related adverse 
events (TEAEs) no increase was seen in patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis [21,1% (8/38) 
(<3  months),  38.9%  (7/18)  (3  to  <6  months);  18.8%  (3/16)  (6  to  ≤12  months)  and  50.0%  (5/10) 
(>12 months)]. Treatment-related SAEs was also comparable across ITP categories [2.6% (1/38) (<3 
months),  0  %  (3  to  <6  months);  12.5%  (2/16)  (6  to  ≤12  months)  0%  (>12  months)];  as  well  as 
treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation [0% (<3 months); 0% (3 to <6 months); 
6.3% (1/16) (6 to ≤12 months); 0% (>12 months)]. 
In  the  updated  ad-hoc  analysis  (cut-off  date:  21-Oct-2021),  the  inclusion  of  23  additional  patients 
(n=105, of which 72 patients treated with eltrombopag had ITP< 6 months), do not significantly modify 
the  previously  observed  safety  results.  Incidence  of  TEAE  (29.4%  [15/51],  47.6%  [10/21],  33.3% 
[6/18],  46.7%  [7/15])  and  treatment-related  SAEs  (3.9%  [2/51],  0%,  16.7%  [3/18],  0%)  continue 
without differing greatly across ITP categories in newly diagnosed to chronic ITP, respectively. The overall 
rate of treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation and of dose adjustment/interruption 
were also comparable in all ITP categories. 
The reported adverse events in TAPER study concur with the already known ones for eltrombopag. The 
most commonly reported adverse events (>10% in all patients) were headache (17.6% vs. 38.1% vs. 
11.1.% vs. 20.0%), and thrombocytopenia (21.6% vs. 23.8% vs. 11.1% vs 0%) in newly diagnosed to 
chronic  ITP,  respectively;  followed  by  hepatobiliary  laboratory  abnormalities,  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
asthenia, epistaxis and petechiae (cut-off date:21-Oct-2021). 
Real world evidence submitted show that safety profile of eltrombopag observed in patients less than 6 
months from diagnosis (n ≈ 335 patients with newly and persistent ITP) seems similar when compared 
to patients with a longer time from diagnosis, and the type of reported adverse events are overall in line 
with  the  already  known  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag.  Frequently  reported  non-serious  AES  were 
headache  and  hepatobiliary  laboratory  abnormalities.  More  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  related  to 
thrombosis complications and hemorrhages events in non-responsive patients. 
The risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications with eltrombopag treatment is already known and 
the SmPC already includes the warning that caution should be used when administering eltrombopag to 
patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although expected to be comparable, no long-term safety data (beyond 6 months) have been provided 
for the subgroup of patients with less than 6 months from diagnosis within this procedure. Neither the 
updated  ad-hoc  analysis  of  TAPER  study  (J2411  study),  nor  the  patients  included  in  EXTEND  study, 
provide long-term safety data beyond 6.5 months in this population. However, the long-term safety of 
eltrombopag is already known from studies conducted  in patients >6 months from ITP diagnosis.  
The limited sample size of the ad-hoc analyses (n=88 eltrombopag treated patients with ITP < 6 months) 
and the uncontrolled character of most of the submitted data, preclude a robust interpretation of results 
based solely on clinical trials, being necessary to also take into account as supportive, the real-world 
Assessment report  
EMA/850880/2022  
Page 74/82 
 
 
 
 
evidence provided. In this regard, although it must be taken into account that robust evidence that can 
be drawn from routine clinical setting is limited, and that, consequently, interpretation of data should be 
done with caution, submitted safety data from real-world evidence are overall in line with the already 
known safety profile of eltrombopag.  
Two haemorrhagic deaths of the 105 eltrombopag-treated patients (1.9%) were reported in the TAPER 
study  in  patients  <6  months  from  diagnosis  (on-treatment  deaths  due  to  central  nervous  system 
haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage), one with newly diagnosed ITP and other in the subgroup 
of 3 to < 6 months from ITP diagnosis.  
Although  the  investigator  did  not  consider  these  two  deaths  related  to  eltrombopag,  they  can  be 
considered as lack of efficacy, also if taken into account the discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy 
observed. 
Since in the literature, it is stated that the frequency of death from haemorrhage in ITP patients with 
platelet counts <30 G/L is estimated to be between 1.6 and 3.9% per patient-year, influenced by several 
factors and since in both of the reported deaths from TAPER study the patient had loss the response to 
eltrombopag and their platelets counts were not stabilized, there seems to be a consistency between the 
reported  rates  in  the  study  and  literature.  Nonetheless,  beyond  that,  the  sample  size  and  design  of 
TAPER study precludes to draw any conclusion about the association with the risk of haemorrhage and 
the ITP chronological stage of the disease. 
Thus, events suggesting lack of efficacy from TAPER study cannot be viewed as conclusive. However, 
weighting  them  up  with  the  overall  high  response  rates  and  the  decrease  in  the  rates  of  bleeding 
observed in the study, they can be viewed as not concerning.

(1)  Ad-hoc analysis of extension study [EXTEND study]: after completion of their participation in parent studies 
[TRA100773A], [TRA100773B], [TRA102537/RAISE], [TRA108057/REPEAT]), the patients were offered to 
continue treatment with eltrombopag in the open-label study [TRA105325/EXTEND], until eltrombopag became 
commercially available. In this study, the date of ITP diagnosis was collected, which allowed derivation of time 
from ITP diagnosis to the first dose of eltrombopag or matching placebo in the parent study. 
(2)  Interim Ad-hoc analysis of TAPER study (CETB115J2411 study) (cut-off:21-Oct-2021): on-going phase II, 
open-label, prospective, single-arm, study to assess ability of eltrombopag to induce sustained remission in 
patients with ITP who are refractory or relapsed after first-line steroids. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
ITP is an uncommon orphan condition that may be life threatening and where limited therapeutic 
alternatives are available. Eltrombopag is regarded as a suitable therapeutic option able to increase 
platelet counts above a level which reduces the risk of bleeding events.  
Overall, the clinical data presented are indicative of an increase in platelet counts in patients with ITP 
<6 months from diagnosis. The observed efficacy seems generally consistent among different 
subgroups (< 3 months, ≥ 3 to <6 months, ≥6 to ≤12 months, and > 12 months). This translate into 
a significant reduction in bleeding, which is the goal of ITP therapy.

Since the clinical data are limited, supporting data from real world evidence through literature review 
has also been provided, which show that eltrombopag is frequently used off-label during clinical 
practice in patients with <6 months from diagnosis and, although interpretation of data should be done 
with caution, results show the achievement of clinically relevant platelet responses in a considerable 
proportion of patients in patients with both newly and persistent IPT, in line with what has been 
observed in clinical trials.  
From a safety point of view, no unexpected findings have been identified. Common adverse events 
include headache and hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities. Serious adverse events include 
thrombotic and haemorrhages events in non-responsive patients. The risk for 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications with eltrombopag treatment is already known and the SmPC 
already includes the warning that caution should be used when administering eltrombopag to patients 
with known risk factors for thromboembolism. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In this application, the MAH proposes to modify the ITP indication statement to remove the term 
“lasting 6 months or longer from diagnosis” to allow adult ITP patients who are refractory to other 
treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) to be treated with eltrombopag after first-line 
treatment irrespective of time from initial diagnosis. Since only the adult ITP indication is sought to be 
extended with this submission, the paediatric indication will be separated into an individual statement. 
To support this indication extension, the company based this application with two ad-hoc analyses of 
subgroups from: 1) ITP registration studies (19 patients; 16 treated with eltrombopag with ITP < 6 
months); 2) Interim analysis of ongoing phase II TAPER study (CETB115J2411) (updated cut-off date 
of 21-Oct-2021) (n=105 patients: including 51 newly diagnosed ITP, 21 with ITP 3 to <6 months, 18 
with ITP 6 to ≤12 months and 15 patients with chronic ITP). Eltrombopag efficacy and safety were 
explored among different patient subgroups by time from ITP diagnosis. In addition, an updated PK/PD 
modelling has been provided aiming at evaluating whether the influence of time since diagnosis may 
provide clinically relevant differences in platelet counts in ITP adult patients receiving eltrombopag.  
Comparable rates of platelet responses were attained irrespective of time from diagnosis; therefore, 
they can be considered clinically relevant for subjects with ITP < 6 months. These similar platelet 
responses across ITP categories translate into a similarly reduction in the frequency and severity of 
bleeding events irrespective of time from diagnosis, which is the goal of ITP therapy. Consistency was 
observed between the two ad-hoc analyses.  
Data from clinical trials have been complemented with real world evidence of the already use of 
eltrombopag in patients with less than 6 months from ITP diagnosis in clinical practice (n ≈335 
patients with newly and persistent ITP). Support with data from real world evidence is considered 
relevant when a high off- label use in clinical practice is expected, such as in the case of TPO-AR. Data 
provided show that eltrombopag seems to be also effective when it is started in earlier stages of the 
disease and confirm that it exists an off-label use of eltrombopag already in patients with less than 6 
months from diagnosis when response failure to first line therapy is confirmed, which is not 
unexpected according to what it is stablished current guidelines (Neunert et al, 2019; Provan et al, 
2019). Although it must be taken into account that robust evidence that can be drawn from routine 
clinical settings is limited, and that, consequently, interpretation of data should be done with caution, 
results show the achievement of clinically relevant platelet responses in a considerable proportion of 
patients with newly and persistent ITP (ranged from 67%-to 90%), in line with what has been 
observed in ad-hoc analysis from clinical trials.

PK/PD modelling shows that no clinically relevant changes in platelet count levels were predicted 
between patients with <6 month and ≥6 months diagnosis across the 4 weeks after the start of 
treatment. With the use of eltrombopag irrespective of time from diagnosis, minimal changes are 
expected in platelet count levels, which lack of any clinical relevance. However, the unbalanced 
proportion of patients with time since diagnosis <6 months could affect the final conclusion obtained. 
Therefore, the current population PK/PD should be considered of low-impact (descriptive) for 
supporting the current extension of indication. 
If taken into account the consistency observed in all the evidence submitted, all pointing in the same 
direction, and in the context of limited treatment options, benefits of the treatment overweigh the risks 
for patients with ITP who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) 
irrespective of time since initial ITP diagnosis.

Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP) who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) irrespective of 
time since initial diagnosis, based on an ad-hoc analysis of Study TAPER (CETB115J2411); an ongoing 
phase II, open-label, prospective, single-arm study in 
adult ITP patients who are refractory or relapsed after first-line steroids. 
As a consequence sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some minor amendments in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC for increased consistency. 
An updated RMP version 54.1 has been submitted. 
5.  EPAR changes

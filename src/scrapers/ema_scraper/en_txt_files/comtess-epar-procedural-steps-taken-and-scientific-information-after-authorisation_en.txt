In response to this request, the product information was 
updated to reflect behavioural symptoms related to impulse 
control disorders including compulsive spending or buying, 
binge eating and compulsive eating. It was clarified that this 
adverse reaction can occur irrespective of the indication and 
at normal doses. Furthermore, regular monitoring of patients 
and a careful review of treatment, if symptoms occur, is 
recommended. The Package Leaflet was updated in 
accordance and advice for the patient’s family and carers was 
provided.

Following a request from the CHMP for 
The MAH submitted a group of variations to update the 
SPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 and the PL of Comtess with 
respect to ischemic heart disease events and 
myocardial infarction. The SPC section 4.4 and the PL 
were updated further to the signal on colitis. In 
addition, the PL has been revised following the results 
of a user test and changes are proposed to the Annex 
I, IIB and IIIB of the Comtess Product Information 
following the QRD template version 7.3.

and PL 
entacapone-containing medicinal products, the product 
information has been updated with respect to ischemic heart 
disease events and myocardial infarction.  
Colitis is currently included in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
However, the MAH has now updated section 4.4 of the SPC 
following assessment of cumulative post-marketing safety 
data.  Based on the new analysis, the colitis signal has not 
become more frequent nor increased in severity, but in order 
to provide additional information on the management of 
prolonged diarrhoea as a potential sign of colitis an update of 
section 4.4 is considered appropriate. The added sentence in 
section 4.4 states that prolonged or persistent diarrhoea 
appearing during use of entacapone may be a sign of colitis, 
and that in the event of prolonged or persistent diarrhoea, 
the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical 
therapy and investigations considered.  
In addition, changes are proposed to the Annex I, IIB and 
IIIB of the Comtess product information following the QRD 
template version 7.3, and the PL has been revised following

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of the available information the CHMP is 
II, Labelling 
of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy of 
and PL 
this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Comtess continues to be favourable.  
There is strong evidence on the positive causal relationship 
between impulse control disorders and antiparkinsonian 
therapy. However, whether these behaviours are simply 
related to dopaminergic medications or whether the primary 
pathological features of PD play a role is not known. The 
development of impulse control disorder has very often been 
linked to dopamine agonist administration, especially 
adjunctive agonist therapy combined with 
levodopa-carbidopa. Cumulatively, a total of three reports 
with pathological gambling and eight reports with libido 
increased or hypersexuality have been reported for 
entacapone. Based on this the CHMP endorsed the MAH 
proposal to include a a statement regarding the terms 
pathological gambling, libido increased and hypersexuality in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC of Comtess.  
A total of four reports including a reported overdose were 
received during the period (16 March 2006 to 16 January 
2008) and one additional report of intentional overdose was 
received after the Data Lock Point (DLP). Of these five 
reports, three were identified as actual confirmed overdoses. 
Page 7/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on these cases the CHMP accepted the MAH suggested 
new wording of the Comtess SPC section 4.9 "Overdose" that 
would read as follows: "The post-marketing data includes 
isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily 
dose of entacapone has been 16,000 mg. The acute 
symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included 
confusion, decreased activity, somnolence, hypotonia, skin 
discolouration and urticaria."

inclusion of a warning related to this safety concern in section 
4.4 of the SPC and the inclusion of the terms "colitis" and 
"skin, hair, beard and nail discolorations" in section 4.8 of the 
SPC and relevant section of the PL. Within this type II 
variation, the MAH has reviewed post-marketing safety data 
and consequently analysed cumulative case reports of 
increased liver function tests associated with weight 
decrease, anorexia or asthenia. Additionally, the MAH 
provided an update of scientific literature regarding weight 
decrease in Parkinson's disease. Based on these data, 
section 4.4 of the SPC has been updated to reflect that "For 
patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and 
weight decrease within a relatively short period of time, a 
general medical evaluation including liver function should be 
considered". "Colitis" and "skin, hair, beard and nail 
discolorations" were included in section 4.8 of the SPC and 
section 4 of the PL. Addition of a new subsection "Take 
special care with Comtess" for section 2 of the PL to include 
all the relevant precautions and warnings was also made.

reported to have been related to NMS even on their own, and 
these cases create no clear signal at the moment. 
The wording on NMS in section 4.4 of the SPC has been 
revised to state that isolated cases of NMS have been 
reported, especially following abrupt reduction or 
discontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant 
dopaminergic medications. It was also added to section 4.8 
of the SPC that isolated cases of NMS have been reported 
following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of entacapone 
and other dopaminergic medications. This change was also 
reflected in the Package Leaflet.Since market introduction 9 
cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported to the MAH. 
Rhabdomyolysis has been mild or moderate and other 
possible causal factors have been detected. Consequently 
information has been added to section 4.8 of the SPC that 
isolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported.

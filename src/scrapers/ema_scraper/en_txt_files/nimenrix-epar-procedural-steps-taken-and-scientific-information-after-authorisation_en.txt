reference to section 4.2 Posology and method of 
Impact of a single dose of Nimenrix. 
In 2018, the Netherlands added Nimenrix to the national 
immunisation programme as a single dose for toddlers at 
14 months of age to replace the meningococcal C conjugate 
vaccine. A catch-up campaign with a single dose of

administration of the SmPC was included, to direct

section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include 
minor editorial changes to the SmPC and to bring the 
Product information in line with the latest QRD 
update. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
Nimenrix for adolescents 14-18 years of age also initiated 
in 2018, and it became routine in 2020 leading to a toddler 
and adolescent national immunisation programme. Within 
two years, the incidence of meningococcal disease caused 
by groups C, W, and Y was significantly reduced by 100% 
(95% CI: 14, 100) in individuals 14-18 years of age, 85% 
(95% CI: 32, 97) in all vaccine eligible ages (direct effect), 
and 50% (95% CI: 28, 65) in non-vaccine eligible ages 
(indirect effect). The impact of Nimenrix was primarily 
driven by a reduction in group W disease.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
The SmPC section 4.5 has been updated as follows:  
[…] 
In individuals aged 9 to 25 years, Nimenrix can be given 
concomitantly with human papillomavirus bivalent [Type 16 
and 18] vaccine, recombinant (HPV2). 
[…] 
One month after co-administration with a combined tetanus 
toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis 
vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap) in subjects aged 9 to 25 years, 
lower GMCs were observed to each pertussis antigen 
(pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] 
and pertactin [PRN]). More than 98% of subjects had anti-
PT, FHA or PRN concentrations above the assay cut-off 
thresholds. The clinical relevance of these observations is 
unknown. There was no impact of co-administration on 
immune responses to Nimenrix or the tetanus or diphtheria 
antigens included in Tdap. 
The PL (section 2) has been updated accordingly.

Nimenrix may be given as a booster dose in individuals who 
reflect new booster and persistence data with a 
follow-up of up to 5 years after vaccination with 
MenACWY-TT. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the 
SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet. An updated 
RMP version 7.1 was agreed during the procedure. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Labelling and 
have previously received primary vaccination with Nimenrix 
PL 
or other conjugated or plain polysaccharide meningococcal 
vaccines. In clinical trials, the use of Nimenrix as a booster 
following primary vaccination with Nimenrix or other 
meningococcal vaccines (quadrivalent meningococcal A, C, 
W, and Y-DT conjugate vaccine or monovalent MenC 
conjugate vaccines) was evaluated.  
Nimenrix booster vaccination after priming in toddlers, 
children, adolescents and adults: For subjects primed with 
Nimenrix aged 1 year and above and boosted with 
Nimenrix 4 or 5 years later, more than 99.0% of all 
subjects achieved post-booster SBA titres 
 1:8 for both 
assays (studies MenACWY-TT-062, 048, 059, 088). One 
month after the booster vaccination, the GMTs elicited were 
significantly higher than those elicited by age matched 
naïve control groups, indicating that Nimenrix induces 
immune memory to groups A, C, W-135, and Y.   
The observed MenC booster response with Nimenrix was 
Page 28/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar to that observed in subjects primed and boosted 
with a monovalent MenC-CRM conjugate vaccine. One year 
after Nimenrix booster, SBA titres 
 1:8 persisted in at 
least 95.5% of subjects (study MenACWY-TT-048, 12 to 23 
months of age at primary vaccination). 
When Nimenrix was used as a booster following primary 
vaccination with a MenACWY-DT conjugate vaccine or a 
monovalent MenC conjugate vaccine (study MenACWY-TT-
059, 10 to 25 years of age at primary vaccination and 
study MenACWY-TT-088, 2 to 10 years of age at primary 
vaccination), the titres increased by 48-340 fold for all 
groups and 100% of the subjects reached SBA titres 
 1:8. 
The local and general adverse reaction profile of a booster 
dose of Nimenrix after primary vaccination with Nimenrix or 
other conjugated or plain polysaccharide meningococcal 
vaccines, was similar to the local and general adverse 
reaction profile observed after primary vaccination with 
Nimenrix, except gastrointestinal symptoms (including 
diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea) which were very 
common.

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC based on the

SmPC 
The information in section 5.1 of the SmPC for 3 of the 
results of a re-analysis that was performed excluding 
immunogenicity data from subjects impacted by GCP 
deviations for studies MenACWY-TT-036, MenACWY-
TT-043 and MenACWY-TT-038, and which included 
antibody persistence Year 3- and Year 4- results 
from study MenACWY-TT-043, and Year 4- results for 
study MenACWY-TT-032. Further, the pooling of 
clinical safety data in section 4.8 of the SmPC has 
original Nimenrix studies has been updated as a 
consequence of the reanalysis of data following issues 
identified with GCP. The MAH has excluded data from 
subjects who had not been properly consented, or where 
serological data was missing. This includes 119 subjects 
from MenACWY-TT-036 (out of a total of 1025 subjects), 
106 subjects from MenACWY-TT-038 (out of a total of 1501 
subjects), and 9 subjects from MenACWY-TT-043 (out of a

obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
total of 689 subjects). The reason for the majority of 
exclusions from MenACWY-TT-036 and MenACWY-TT-038 
was consent issues, rather than missing serological data.  
Furthermore, data from Years 3 and 4 in study MenACWY-
TT-036 show persistent immunogenicity in adolescents. 
Persistence results from study MenACWY-TT-032 (Years 4 
and 5 in toddlers) have also been updated to try to 
minimise the potential of selection bias, since subjects with 
rSBA MenC titres <8 before Year 4 were offered 
revaccination and excluded from later time points. The MAH 
has therefore updated the Year 4 immunogenicity data to 
reflect the cohort for whom Year 5 data are presented. It is 
agreed that this presentation of the immunogenicity data is 
more meaningful, and more accurately describes the 
persistence of response through Years 4 and 5. 
The MAH has also presented updated pooled safety 
information including data from two additional studies. An 
update without data from excluded sites following issues 
identified with GCP has also been presented. These updates 
do not significantly affect the reporting rates of solicited or 
unsolicited symptoms in either age-group. 
The variation does not have any impact on the overall 
benefit risk balance of Nimenrix, which remains positive.

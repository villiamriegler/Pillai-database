Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products. However, during the application review, the CHMP noted that 
approximately 30-40% of women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have cystic pulmonary 
changes consistent with LAM. Since there is an authorised orphan medicinal product designated for 
“Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)”, everolimus (Votubia), a similarity assessment against this 
products is considered warranted, as the proposed therapeutic indication for Rapamune can be 
considered as being related to the condition of an authorised orphan medicinal product.

Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Planned dates 
19 June 2018 
28 June 2018 
Rapamune (sirolimus) has been approved in the EU since March 13, 2001, for the use for prophylaxis 
of organ transplant rejection in adult patients at low to moderate immunological risk receiving a renal 
transplant. Sirolimus is a fermentation product of Streptomyces hygroscopicus, anactinomycete that 
was isolated in the seventies from a soil sample collected from Rapa Nui, commonly known as Easter 
Island (Seghal et al 1975 J of antibiotics). 
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, progressive, frequently fatal cystic lung disease that 
predominantly affects young women of childbearing age. The clinical course of LAM is typically marked 
by the inexorable progressive loss of lung function, with resulting exercise intolerance and disability. 
Although recent studies suggest that there is variability in the rate of progression, LAM typically results 
in death or lung transplantation within 10 to 15 years. In 2014, the LAM Foundation has estimated that 
3-8 per million women are affected with non-heritable LAM or sporadic LAM (S-LAM) (15,000-23,000 
globally), and that approximately 30-40% of women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have cystic 
pulmonary changes consistent with LAM. LAM is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 
genes that encode for hamartin and tuberin proteins in the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which are 
critical for control of cell growth, survival and motility (van Slegtenharst et al 1997, Science, European 
Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium, 1992, Cell). The knowledge that deficiency or 
dysfunction of hamartin or tuberin results in the constitutive activation of mTOR kinase and S6 kinase 
(S6K), and is associated with inappropriate cellular proliferation, suggests that the mTOR inhibitor 
sirolimus may represent a novel, mechanism-guided, approach to therapy. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH calculates a PECSW value for the now applied orphan indication sporadic 
lymphangioleimyomatosis, 0.00001 μg/l. The applicant states that this is substantially below the 
trigger value of 0.01 μg/l and a Phase II environmental fata and effects analysis is not considered 
necessary. 
The estimated log Kow value for sirolimus is 5.2 (OECD TG117 HPLC study 260C-187) and thus above 
the trigger for a PBT assessment. However, since sirolimus is naturally occurring, extensively 
metabolized (> 93%) and hydrolytically unstable, and given the very low prevalence rate of LAM, the 
applicant argues that sirolimus is not expected to present an environmental risk following patient use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/493416/2018  
Page 7/54 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered that for the calculation of Fpen and PECSW, the full use for the product should 
be taken into account, not only the indication now applied for. In response, the MAH provided updated 
calculation and showed that the PECsw is below the trigger value also in this case. The MAH also 
concluded that a PBT assessment is not warranted and this is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Treatments 
This was a phase III treatment, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
safety/efficacy study to assess sirolimus treatment in subjects with LAM disease. One hundred and 
twenty subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral sirolimus, at an initial dose of 2 mg per 
day, or matched placebo. Sirolimus levels were measured at each follow-up visit; the results of these 
measurements were revealed only to an independent medical monitor, who made dosing 
recommendations to maintain sirolimus trough levels between 5 and 15 ng per millilitre, as well as 
corresponding sham dose adjustments in the placebo group. The study design included a screening 
visit and a 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, followed by a 12-month 
observation period during which no patients received a study drug and all patients remained unaware 
of their treatment assignment. 
Objectives 
The experimental plan had two specific aims: 
1. Developed and implemented a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ‘intention to treat’ based multi-
centre protocol for the determination of the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in subjects with LAM. The 
primary end point was FEV1 response at one year, defined as the difference between groups in the 
rate of change in FEV1 (FEV1 slope). The secondary endpoints were response in FVC, diffusing capacity 
for carbon monoxide, lung volume measurements, distance walked in six minutes, volumetric CT 
estimate of lung cyst size and mass of tissue in the chest, and biomarker analyses such as VEGF-D. 
Planned safety endpoints included analysis of severity-graded adverse events, and number and 
severity of chylous effusions, pneumothoraxes, haemorrhagic renal episodes, and all cause mortality. 
2. Determined the relationship between changes in lung function and questionnaire-based assessments 
of dyspnoea, quality of life, fatigue, and degree of health impairment in LAM trial subjects who are 
taking sirolimus or placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
For the primary efficacy measure, the rate of change in each outcome over the first year in the 
sirolimus group was compared with that in placebo group. The primary outcome was FEV1 response, 
which was assessed as the rate of change in FEV1 (FEV1 slope) in millilitres per month, over the 12 
month treatment period. 
The secondary outcomes were: 
• 
• 
 Rate of change in FEV1 per month over the observation period 
 Change of FEV1 from baseline during the treatment period and observation period 
•  Responses in FVC 
•  Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. 
• 
Lung volume measurements (residual volume, functional residual capacity, and total lung 
capacity). 
•  Distance walked in a six-minute walk test. 
•  Volumetric CT estimate of lung cyst size and mass of tissue in the chest (Planned, but not yet 
completed). 
•  Serum VEGF-D levels.

Sample size 
One hundred and twenty patients were randomized to placebo or sirolimus groups, treated for one 
year and followed off of drug or placebo for one additional year. The primary endpoint will be FEV1 
slope at 12 months. For efficacy, the power to test the hypothesis that there was no difference 
between two groups in changes of outcomes over time was calculated at a significance level α of 0.05. 
Assuming compound symmetry for the covariance structure of repeated measures from the same 
subject, the following formula was used (Diggle et al. (2003)):  
Z1-β=[(N*m*sx
in each group; m: the number of repeated measures; d: the difference between two slopes; σ2: the 
2=Σ(xj-mean(x))2/m; n: the number of subjects 
2*d2)/(2*σ2*(1-ρ))]0.5-Z1-α/2, where sx
common variance of outcome; ρ: the correlation between outcomes from the same subject; β: the 
type II error rate.  
The power was calculated assuming unit standard deviation and within-subject correlations from 0.7-
0.9. The statistical powers will be less than 60% when the slope difference between two groups is 0.03 
and within subject correlation smaller than 0.9. See table below. 
Table 2 Power calculation for the linear mixed effects model 
Randomisation 
Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or sirolimus arm via the DMCC on-line 
system. Kits were prepared based on a 1:1 randomization assignment. 
Blinding  
The site principal investigator and all site team members were blinded to treatment assignment for the 
subjects. Rapamune 1mg tablets and placebo to match were supplied to site pharmacies in numbered 
kits. Each kit consisted of 2 boxes, Box A and Box B. To maintain blinding, for each subject in the 
treatment arm who underwent a dose adjustment, a subject in the placebo arm also underwent a dose 
adjustment.

Statistical methods 
Taking into account within subject correlation of each outcome, a linear mixed effects model was 
planned to test whether the slope of each outcome in the sirolimus group was the same as that in the 
placebo group. Repeated measurements were planned to be analysed as a vector outcome. An 
indicator of the sirolimus group, time, and an interaction term between the indicator of sirolimus group 
and time were included as fixed effects. Two types of random effects models were planned: one was to 
include a random intercept only and the other was to include a random intercept and a random slope 
for each subject. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) were to obtain regression coefficients for fixed 
effects and restricted MLE for the variance component. A linear predictor was to be obtained through 
the estimates of random intercept and random slope to identify individuals with steeper change. To 
examine whether the mean FEV1 response was similar between the two treatment groups, a linear 
mixed-effects model was used to include the time since enrolment, the treatment assignment, and the 
interaction between time and treatment. The PROC MIXED procedure with the Kenward-Roger 
correction (SAS Institute) was used to fit the model, without imputation of missing data. Four models 
were examined: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Intent-to-treat approach using all enrolled subjects 
Protocol-driven approach including subjects who were primary outcome completers (i.e., had 
values for 12-month FEV1 
Protocol driven approach with removal of data from subjects who had trough sirolimus levels below 
5 ng/mL for at least 3 months of the study 
Protocol driven approach with removal of data from subjects who were identified as outliers to the 
fitted model when residual analysis was performed. 
The primary statistical analysis was the intent-to-treat approach using all enrolled subjects. This model 
was compared for consistency with the other three models. The treatment and time interaction was 
found to be statistically significant in all four approaches, implying that the level of FEV1 (L) improved 
in the active treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group. Slope estimation showed that 
the FEV1 level decreased significantly over time in the placebo group, but remained stable in the 
sirolimus group. 
A general linear model was used to compare the difference between the two groups in the mean 
change from baseline to 12 months, after adjustment for baseline values. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
was used to assess the difference from baseline to 12 months within each group. For categorical 
outcomes, the data were compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test or the chi-square test, as 
appropriate. For continuous variables, the medians were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported P 
values were two-sided, and were not adjusted for multiple testing. The analyses were performed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle. Since subject-specific change plots clearly suggested that 
slopes differed among subjects, the focus of the primary efficacy analysis was the linear mixed effects 
model for FEV1 with both random intercept and slope. The normality of FEV1 (L) at each visit time was 
examined through a Shapiro-Wilk test, and there was no significant violation of normality assumption 
(p-value > 0.3). 
Missing data 
If data were missing, the analyses were planned to be performed in several ways: First, data were to 
be analysed assuming missing status was completely at random. However, if the ‘missingness’ 
depended on the outcome, the parameter estimation could be biased. As a secondary analysis, 
investigating the missing data mechanism given observed outcomes was planned. If the ‘missingness’ 
Assessment report  
EMA/493416/2018  
Page 12/54 
 
 
 
depended on the set of observed outcomes, a correctly specified covariance structure could 
accommodate the situation. But if the ‘missingness’ was due to a specific outcome value that should 
have been obtained at the time, a sensitivity analysis under various plausible assumptions concerning 
the ‘missingness’ was to proceed. Dropout was also to be considered in a monotone missing data 
pattern. When the dropout was completely at random or unrelated to all future outcome values, an 
imputation was to be incorporated to fill out the missing data. However, when the dropout depended 
on current and future unobserved outcomes, there would be no standard approach to accommodate 
this situation. 
Analysis of the pattern of missing data was not completed fully as described in the planned statistical 
analyses. The percent change from baseline was examined for study participants with post-baseline 
data who withdrew before the 12 month primary efficacy time point. This examination was judged to 
be sufficient for concluding that the missing data were not likely to affect the study efficacy conclusion. 
Interim Analyses 
An interim analysis occurred using the O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundary when 40 subjects had 
completed the 12-month visit. A significance level of 0.002 was chosen to preserve a nominal 
significance level of 0.049 for efficacy at the end of the study. The analyses were planned to be 
performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome, the FEV1 response 
measured in liters over the course the treatment year (termed the FEV1 slope), was planned to be 
analysed as the difference in the FEV1 slope between the placebo group and the sirolimus group. The 
planned calculation was to use the spirometric data obtained at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
during the treatment phase. A linear mixed-effects model including the time since enrolment, the 
treatment assignment, and the interaction between time and treatment was planned for use to 
evaluate the between-group and within group differences in the FEV1 slope.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted in the USA, Japan and Canada and patients were recruited between 
December 2006 and September 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
Although the interim stopping rule met the threshold for early termination due to a finding of efficacy 
in the primary endpoint, the DSMB recommended that the trial be continued until all the subjects had 
completed the 12-month visit. The purpose of this action was to ensure that a full complement of 
efficacy and safety data would be gathered. The data and safety monitoring board also endorsed an 
investigator-initiated proposal to truncate the observation phase of the study, owing to the impending 
termination of the funding period and expiration of the study drug. The treatment assignments and the 
deliberations of the data and safety monitoring board remained concealed until the release of the final 
analysis. 
Baseline data 
Table 4 Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/493416/2018  
Page 15/54 
 
 
 
The subjects had moderately severe lung disease; the mean ± standard deviation (SD) FEV1 was 
47.7±14.4% of the predicted value in the placebo group and 49.3±13.3% of the predicted value in the 
sirolimus group (p=0.77). There was also evidence of airflow obstruction, gas trapping, and impaired 
gas exchange. At baseline, most subjects had a history of a pneumothorax and/or angiomyolipoma and 
required oxygen therapy intermittently.  
Numbers analysed 
The population for the efficacy analyses included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug (43 in the placebo group and 46 in the sirolimus group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint 
In the placebo group, the FEV1 slope ±SE from baseline to 12 months was −12±2 mL per month; the 
slope was significantly less than zero (p<0.0001), a finding that was consistent with declining lung 
function. The FEV1slope ±SE in the sirolimus group was 1±2 mL per month, which was not 
significantly different from zero; this was indicative of the stabilization of lung function during 
treatment. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the FEV1slope (p<0.0001). 
The mean change (±SD) in FEV1, during the treatment period in the placebo group was -134 (±182) 
mL, versus 19 (±124) mL in the sirolimus group. The baseline-adjusted difference in the mean change 
in FEV1 (sirolimus versus placebo) during the treatment periods was 151 mL (p<0.0001 for the 
between-group difference). A total of 12% of the subjects in the placebo group, as compared with 46% 
of the subjects in the sirolimus group, had FEV1 values at or above baseline values at the 12 month 
visit (p=0.0004). FEV1 declined in both groups during the observation year (a decline of 8±3 mL per 
month in the placebo group and of 14±3 mL per month in the sirolimus group). Although these slopes 
were both less than zero (p=0.005 and p<0.0001, respectively), the difference between them did not 
reach significance (p=0.08).

Figure 1 Change in Lung Function During Treatment and Observation Phases 
Secondary Endpoints 
The FVC slope (±standard error [SE]) during the treatment phase was −11±3 mL per month in the 
placebo group, as compared with 8±3 mL per month in the sirolimus group (p<0.0001). The FVC slope 
was significantly less than zero in the placebo group (p=0.001), which was consistent with a decline in 
lung function. The slope was significantly greater than zero in the sirolimus group (p=0.009), which 
was consistent with an improvement in lung function during treatment. The mean change (±SD) in 
FVC, during the treatment period in the placebo group was -129 (±233) mL, versus 97 (±260) mL in 
the sirolimus group. The baseline-adjusted difference in the mean change in FVC (sirolimus versus 
placebo) during the treatment periods was 216 mL (p=0.0005 for the between-group difference). A 
total of 23% of the subjects in the placebo group, and 54% of subjects in the sirolimus group, had FVC 
values that were at or above baseline values at the 12-month visit (p=0.003). The difference between 
groups in the slope for FRC during the treatment phase was also significant (p=0.049). The differences 
between groups in the slopes for TLC, RV, DLco, and 6MWD were not significant (Table 2).  
There were significant differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in the score on the 
EuroQOL VAS for QOL and in the total score on the FPI. The changes in individual measures of SF-36 
and SGRQ did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mean VEGF-D levels were similar in the 
two groups at baseline and were significantly lower at the 12 month points in the sirolimus group than 
in the placebo group.

Period. (MILES Study)

There was no significant difference between treatment groups in the observation-year slopes or the 
mean changes from baseline to 24 months in FVC. The mean (±SD) serum VEGF-D levels at 24 
months remained elevated in the placebo group (2108±2146 pg per millilitre in the 13 subjects for 
whom data were available at 24 months) and depressed in the sirolimus group (930±461 pg per 
millilitre in the 14 subjects for whom data were available at 24 months).VEGF-D, a lymphangiogenic 
growth factor implicated in the pathophysiology of LAM, were elevated at baseline in both groups and 
fell in the group treated with sirolimus.  There were no significant differences in the slopes from 12 to 
24 months or in the mean change from baseline to 24 months in any other variables measured, 
including lung volumes, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, distance covered on a 6-minute walk 
test, and symptoms. 
The lack of a significant between-group difference in the distance covered on a 6-minute walk test 
suggested that improvement in lung function was not accompanied by an increase in exercise capacity, 
though a treatment effect might have been obscured by the relatively high baseline exercise tolerance 
of the subjects or limitations in the performance characteristics of the test.  
Ancillary analyses 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance: Trough sirolimus levels were drawn at each study visit 
beginning on study visit 2. The levels of sirolimus in the placebo group were below the detection limit 
throughout the study. Other than brief out-of-range excursions, the sirolimus trough levels in the 
active-treatment group were maintained between 5 and 15 ng/mL, except in the case of four subjects 
in whom levels were intentionally kept below 5 ng/mL for 3 months or more in order to control side 
effects. 
Summary of main study 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present

A search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify reports on the efficacy and safety of 
sirolimus in subjects with LAM, cumulatively through 6 February 2017. A summary of 11 relevant 
references obtained from this search are presented below and are considered supportive of the safety 
and effectiveness of mTOR inhibition for the treatment of LAM.

•  Takada et al (2016) reported that in a randomised, controlled clinical trial sirolimus stabilised 
lung function in subjects with LAM treated for a 12-month period, however pretreatment 
decline in lung function after the drug was discontinued indicated that continued exposure is 
required to suppress disease progression. The authors therefore conducted a single-arm, open-
label, investigator initiated safety and efficacy study of sirolimus in 63 women with LAM at 9 
sites in Japan to determine the durability and tolerability of long-term sirolimus treatment in 
Asian subjects with LAM. The subjects received sirolimus for 2 years at doses adjusted to 
maintain a trough blood level of 5-15 ng/ml. Results show 52 subjects (82.5%) completed the 
trial with mean drug compliance of more than 80% overall during the study. The number of 
AEs was greatest during the initial 6 months of therapy, but they continued to occur with 
declining frequency throughout the 2-year study period. Of the 1,549 AEs reported, 27 were 
classified as serious, including reversible sirolimus pneumonitis in 3 subjects. New 
hypercholesterolaemia occurred in 30 subjects (48%); microcytosis in 10 subjects; loss of 
body weight in 33 subjects; and an increase in blood pressure that required treatment in 5 
subjects. The FEV1, FVC, and quality-of-life parameters were stable in the overall study cohort 
during the study period, but baseline to 2-year improvements in lung function occurred in the 
subset of subjects with a prior history of chylothorax.  
The authors conclude although long-term sirolimus treatment of Asian subjects with LAM was 
associated with a large number of AEs, including three episodes of pneumonitis, most subjects 
completed the 2-year course of medication with good drug compliance and stable quality of life 
and lung function. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MILES trial was a phase III treatment, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
safety/efficacy study to assess sirolimus treatment in subjects with LAM disease; the majority of 
patients were diagnosed with sporadic LAM, presenting the pulmonary manifestations. One hundred 
and twenty subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral sirolimus, at an initial dose of 2 mg 
per day, or matched placebo. Sirolimus levels were measured at each follow-up visit; the results of 
these measurements were revealed only to an independent medical monitor, who made dosing 
recommendations to maintain sirolimus trough levels between 5 and 15 ng per millilitre, as well as 
corresponding sham dose adjustments in the placebo group. The study design included a screening 
visit and a 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, followed by a 12-month 
observation period during which no patients received a study drug and all patients remained unaware 
of their treatment assignment. The design is considered appropriate but the CHMP requested further 
information on the chosen dosing strategy. More specifically, for sirolimus a single loading dose of 6 
mg is recommended for (i.e. directly after) renal transplantation (and 2 mg as maintenance, or the 
Assessment report  
EMA/493416/2018  
Page 34/54 
 
 
 
dose in steady state, respectively). The applicant justified why a loading dose is not needed or 
recommended for the treatment of LAM, i.e. treatment of LAM with sirolimus does not require 
immediate attainment of the target concentration range. In the case of renal transplantation a loading 
dose is recommended in order to quickly achieve an efficacious concentration in order to reduce the 
risk of rejection, while for the LAM indication there is no such risk. 
It is acknowledged that the study is performed outside the EU, but it is acceptable to extrapolate the 
MILES data to an EU patient population considering that the disease and treatment is expected to be 
similar. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MILES trial showed a statistical significance for the primary endpoint with a preserved pulmonary 
function with treatment with sirolimus for 1 year and determined by the change in FEV1. It was shown 
that the FEV1slope (±SE) from baseline to 12 months was 1±2 mL per month in the sirolimus group, 
which was not significantly different from zero. This was not the case in the placebo group were the 
FEV1slope (±SE) was −12±2 mL per month and the slope was significantly less than zero (p<0.0001), 
a finding that was consistent with declining lung function. The mean change from baseline in FEV1 
after 12 months treatment was 19±124 in the sirolimus group and -134±182 in the placebo group 
(p<0.0001). The baseline-adjusted difference in the mean change in FEV1 (sirolimus versus placebo) 
during the treatment periods was 151 mL (p<0.0001 for the between-group difference). A total of 46% 
of the subjects in the sirolimus group, as compared with 12% of the subjects in the placebo  group, 
had FEV1 values at or above baseline values at the 12 month visit (p=0.0004). 
In addition, effect was shown in several secondary endpoints. A difference in FVC was shown with a 
baseline-adjusted difference in the mean change in FVC (sirolimus versus placebo) during the 
treatment periods of 216 mL (p=0.0005 for the between-group difference). A total of 54% of subjects 
in the sirolimus group and 23% of the subjects in the placebo group, had FVC values that were at or 
above baseline values at the 12-month visit (p=0.003). In addition, an effect on VEGF-D (Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor D) was shown with lower levels in the active treatment group (p = 0.001). 
For the quality of life parameters the results was significant in two of the investigated 4 different 
scores. There were significant differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in the score on the 
EuroQOL VAS for QOL and in the total score on the FPI. The changes in individual measures of SF-36 
and SGRQ did not differ significantly between the two groups. Even though many of the comparisons 
to placebo reached statistical significance, the clinical relevance of the magnitude of the differences is 
difficult to evaluate considering the rarity of the condition. In addition, no effects were observed on the 
diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide or on exercise tolerance and the positive effects on 
airflow vanished after sirolimus was discontinued.  
The CHMP requested the MAH to further discuss the clinical relevance of the effect and the choice of 
study endpoints. Namely, the treatment with Rapamune has been shown to stabilize FEV1 during the 
treatment period of one year, whereas FEV1 declined in the placebo group in patients with LAM and 
FEV1≤ 70%. However, the clinical relevance of the data needs further justification, especially as with 
respect to the FEV1 as the primary endpoint for the patient population with LAM, which is a 
heterogeneous population including patients with normal lung function and different progression rates. 
Furthermore, the CHMP requested details on the clinical relevance of the effect on FEV1 for the target 
population. Discussion on the potential impact on long term outcomes like respiratory insufficiency and 
lung transplantation was requested, as well as that on the lack of effect on CO diffusion and exercise 
tolerance.  
In response to these requests, the MAH argued that the loss of spirometry-derived lung function 
parameters (e.g. FVC and FEV1) are established features of LAM in combination with cystic lung 
Assessment report  
EMA/493416/2018  
Page 35/54 
 
 
 
destruction and refers among other sources to the clinical guidelines in the US and Japan. This is 
accepted by the CHMP. If the explanation for lack of effect on DLCO is that DLCO may fluctuate for 
reasons unrelated to LAM disease, this should have equal impact in both the active treatment group 
and the placebo group. However, it is acknowledged that there were numerical trends with effect on 
DLCO in sirolimus treated patients. Considering the six minute walk test (6MWT) the MAH argued that 
the patients in the MILES study had a preserved walking distance related to the relatively young age of 
the patients. This is agreed by the CHMP.  
The supportive evidence for the long term effect of sirolimus on lung function and the potential impact 
on long term outcomes was supplied by literature references. In Taveira-DaSilva et al (2011), a mean 
decrease of FEV1 of approximately 100 ml /year was seen before sirolimus therapy. When the subject 
was treated with sirolimus there was seen an increase in FEV1 of approximately 50 ml/year. The same 
pattern is shown in Yao et al (2014). In Takada et al, improvements were seen only in subjects with 
prior history of chylothorax, and the authors discussed if this may be useful for candidate selection and 
predictive biomarker and the concluded that long-term sirolimus treatment of Asian patients with LAM 
was associated with a large number of adverse events, including three episodes of pneumonitis, most 
patients completed the 2-year course of medication with good drug compliance and stable quality of 
life and lung function. In Taveira-DaSilva (2017) it was reported stabilization of lung function values 
compared to the predicted values without treatment with a longer study duration compared to the 
MILES trial. 
However, the CHMP also considered that in order to truly reflect the trial population in the new 
indication of Rapamune, the choice of the pulmonary primary endpoint and the fact that most subjects 
had moderate disease and all included patients had FEV1≤70%, it was requested to describe the 
treated patients in the indication as: patients with moderate lung disease or declining lung function. 
This was agreed by the applicant.  
Furthermore, the CHMP also assessed the similarity between sirolimus and the authorised orphan 
product Votubia (everolimus) and reflected on the potential extend of overlap of the target population 
for Rapamune with the target population of Votubia (everolimus) . The full, currently approved 
indication of Votubia is:  
Renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)  
Votubia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who are at risk of complications (based on factors such as tumour 
size or presence of aneurysm, or presence of multiple or bilateral tumours) but who do not require 
immediate surgery.  
The evidence is based on analysis of change in sum of angiomyolipoma volume.  
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)  
Votubia is indicated for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) 
associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who require therapeutic intervention but are not 
amenable to surgery.  
The evidence is based on analysis of change in SEGA volume. Further clinical benefit, such as 
improvement in disease-related symptoms, has not been demonstrated.  
Thus, the CHMP asked the applicant to provide a concrete estimate calculation of the extent of the 
overlap of patients who have Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-LAM and who could meet clinical 
criteria for treatment with Rapamune and with Votubia.  After careful consideration regarding further 
quantifying the extent of the potential overlap of patients who have Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 
(TSC)-LAM and who meet clinical criteria for treatment with Rapamune and with Votubia, the applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/493416/2018  
Page 36/54 
 
 
 
was not able to provide a clear estimate and argued thatpublished data are limited and do not enable a 
concrete quantification of the overlap. Further to this, data captured in the registries are not 
sufficiently granular to understand whether patients with co-existing angiomyolipomas and 
subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) would meet the criteria for treatment with Votubia, and 
therefore do not provide insight for the degree of potential overlap. Therefore to address the CHMP’s 
major objection as related to the potential overlap of patients, the MAH proposed a narrowed indication 
for patients with S-LAM only, as follows: 
Treatment of patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis with moderate lung disease or 
declining lung function. 
This indication also better reflects the studied population, i.e. the MILES study enrolled 89 subjects of 
which 81 subjects had S-LAM.  
Efficacy of sirolimus for the treatment of LAM in the subset of subjects with S-LAM is consistent with 
the findings in the overall LAM population included in the MILES study, as presented in the table below. 
The primary outcome, the FEV1 response measured in millilitres per month over the course of 1 year 
(termed the FEV1 slope), was significantly better in the sirolimus group, p<0.001. These data 
demonstrated stabilisation of lung function in the sirolimus group, compared with declining lung 
function in the placebo group. These findings are also supported by a significant difference observed in 
FVC, quality of life and functional performance measures. Changes in serum VEGF-D (pg/ml) also 
reflected treatment response. 
Table 7 Sporadic LAM: Effects of Sirolimus on Primary and Secondary Outcome Variables in 
the Treatment Period (MILES Study) 
Within the S-LAM subset, all subjects across both treatment groups reported at least 1 adverse event 
(AE) during the 12 month treatment period. Reported AEs were consistent with the known safety

profile of sirolimus, except for the addition of weight decreased (as previously described for the overall 
study population). There were 9 subjects (23%) in the placebo group reporting at least 1 serious 
adverse event (SAE) during the 12 month treatment period, and 8 subjects (19%) in the sirolimus 
group. Overall, the safety of sirolimus in patients with S- LAM was similar to the safety profile observed 
for all sirolimus treated subjects in the study. 
The applicant’s proposal was accepted by the CHMP. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the analysis of the key efficacy results such as FEV1 and FVC of S-LAM subjects in the 
MILES study of the difference in mean change from baseline to the end of the treatment period 
between the sirolimus and the placebo treatment groups of the S-LAM subset show that the efficacy of 
sirolimus for the treatment of LAM in the subset of subjects with S-LAM is consistent with the findings 
in the overall LAM population included in the MILES Study. The patient population and the clinical data 
from the pivotal study support the indication to patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis with 
moderate lung disease or declining lung function and this is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions as described in the SmPC 4.8 (occurring in <10% of 
patients) are thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, pyrexia, hypertension, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia, 
urinary tract infection, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, abdominal pain, 
lymphocoele, peripheral oedema, arthralgia, acne, diarrhoea, pain, constipation, nausea, headache, 
increased blood creatinine, and increased blood lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). 
Since sirolimus is an immunosuppressant the patients under treatment are vulnerable to opportunistic 
infections and reactivation of viral diseases, such as herpes and CMV. Moreover, immunosuppressive 
treatment increases the susceptibility to the development of lymphoma and other malignancies, 
particularly of the skin. Cases of BK virus-associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus-
associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated 
with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. Hepatoxicity has been reported. The risk may increase 
as the trough sirolimus level increases. Rare reports of fatal hepatic necrosis have been reported with 
elevated trough sirolimus levels. Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and 
infrequently bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP) and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, 
with no identified infectious aetiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens 
including sirolimus.  
Patient exposure 
The MILES study included 46 subjects enrolled in the active treatment group. Subjects were given 2 
mg sirolimus per day by mouth initially. The dose was adjusted throughout the study to maintain a 
trough sirolimus level between 5-15 ng/mL. 
Adverse events  
The safety population was comprised of subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (43 in the 
placebo group and 46 in the sirolimus group). Safety-related data were summarised using tables and 
graphical presentations, subject listings, and complete narrative descriptions of subjects who 
experienced serious AEs (SAEs). Results of the safety-related data analysis are expressed as counts or

medians (or means). AEs were entered as CTCAE version 3 codes. AEs were converted to MedDRA 
v16.1. Safety was assessed based on all-cause mortality within the sirolimus or placebo group. The 
following safety assessments were performed; physical exams, vital signs, levels of electrolytes, blood 
urea nitrogen, creatinine, fasting glucose, hepatic enzymes, urine protein and albumin to creatinine 
ratio, bilirubin, fasting serum lipids, and sirolimus level were performed at every visit. Chest 
radiographs were done at baseline and at the end of study visit.  
During the study, all subjects who received study drug reported AEs. A total of 1911 AEs were 
reported: 43 subjects in the placebo group reported 817 AEs, and 46 subjects in the sirolimus group 
reported 1094 AEs (see table below). 
Table 8 reported Any Adverse Events by Category (CTCAEv3) 
The number of subjects with all causality AEs >5% in the sirolimus group during the Treatment Period, 
based on MedDRA v16.1., is presented below. The most common AEs during the treatment period for 
subjects receiving sirolimus were stomatitis, diarrhoea, acne, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, cough, and nausea (MedDRA v16.1 terms).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths: There were two deaths, both in the placebo group. Neither of the deaths was considered to be 
study related. One participant died as a result of a brain haemorrhage. The death was unexpected and 
determined to be probably not related to the study participation as per the review by the medical 
review officer. The participant had been off the study drug (placebo) for a period of nine months prior 
to the fatal event. The second participant died in a house fire. The cause of death was inhalation of 
combustion products. This death was determined to be definitely not related to study participation by 
the medical review officer. 
Other Serious Adverse Events: Among the 47 SAEs recorded during the study (treatment and 
observation phase combined), there were 23 SAE reports from 13 subjects in the placebo group and 24 
SAE reports from 8 subjects in the sirolimus group. There was no significant difference in the 
proportion of SAE reports between the two groups (p=0.39). A total of 15 SAEs were not related, while 
another 8 were possibly related, please see table below for further details.

Table 10 Total Serious Adverse Event Causality, by Reviewera 
Serious adverse cardiac events occurred only in the sirolimus group and included five events: 
pericarditis/pericardial effusion and pericarditis/pericardial effusion with bradytachyarrhythmia (2 
events in 1 subject); tachycardia and fluid overload after embolisation of an angiomyolipoma (2 events 
in 1 subject); and chest pain. Serious adverse pulmonary or upper respiratory events occurred only 
during the treatment period and were reported more frequently among subjects receiving placebo than 
among those receiving sirolimus. There were 13 reports of pulmonary infiltrates from 6 placebo 
subjects and 2 reports from sirolimus subjects. During the observation year, considerably fewer AEs 
(both overall and per subject) occurred in both groups, but SAEs occurred more frequently in the 
placebo group than in the sirolimus group.

Serious Cardiac Adverse Events: Review of the CTCAEv3-coded serious cardiac AEs showed that these 
events occurred only in the sirolimus group. Three cases describing 5 events which included 
pericarditis/ pericardial effusion and pericarditis/pericardial effusion with brady-tachyarrhythmia (2 
events in 1 subject); tachycardia and fluid overload after embolization of an angiomyolipoma (2 events 
in 1 subject); and chest pain. One case described 2 events of pericardial effusion (within 8 days of 
each other) which were attributed to viral pericarditis in a subject with an elevated viral Coxsackie 
titer. The events resolved with treatment. The second cardiac case described the events of tachycardia 
and fluid overload, which occurred in the setting of an elective embolization of the subject’s preexisting 
angiomyolipoma. These events were deemed “definitely not related” to therapy by both investigator 
and the medical monitor. The events also resolved with treatment. The remaining case described chest 
pain which was considered to be non-ischemic in nature, and related to a pre-existing hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. The outcome was not reported. 
Serious Pulmonary Adverse Events: Review of the CTCAEv3-coded serious adverse pulmonary or upper 
respiratory events showed that these events occurred only during the treatment period and were 
reported more frequently among subjects receiving placebo than among those receiving sirolimus. 
There were 13 reports of pulmonary infiltrates from 6 placebo treated subjects and 2 reports from 
sirolimus treated subjects. During the observation year, considerably fewer AEs (both overall and per 
subject) occurred in both groups, and SAEs occurred more frequently in the placebo group than in the 
sirolimus group. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory values including haemoglobin and cholesterol were evaluated for subjects who were 
assessed for the primary outcome (FEV1). There was no significant difference in haemoglobin between 
the placebo group and sirolimus group. There were no significant differences in baseline total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL), or high density lipoprotein (HDL) between the 
placebo and sirolimus groups. During the treatment period, total cholesterol and triglycerides were 
increased in the sirolimus group (p=0.025 and 0.006, respectively), but not in the placebo group. At 
12 months, median total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels were higher in the sirolimus group as 
compared to the placebo group (p=0.028, 0.002 and 0.037, respectively). There were no significant

albumin/creatinine ratio. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the eighty nine subjects enrolled, 12 subjects, including 7 subjects in the placebo group and 5 
subjects in the sirolimus group, were discontinued from the study due to AEs (see table below). AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation included pneumothorax (2 subjects in the placebo group, and 1 
in the sirolimus group), infection/intercurrent illness (3 subjects in the placebo group, and 2 in the 
sirolimus group), dermatological (1 subject in the sirolimus group), gastrointestinal (1 subject in the 
sirolimus group), and death (2 in the placebo group: 1 due to brain haemorrhage, and 1 in a house 
fire).

Post marketing experience 
A cumulative search of the safety database through 14 September 2016 was conducted for sirolimus 
cases that reported either an indication of the use of sirolimus for patients with LAM, a medical history 
of LAM or where LAM was utilised as string text in the case narrative. MILES trial cases were excluded, 
as these cases are discussed in this application. This cumulative search identified 150 cases reporting 
342 events. Of these cases, there were 26 cases from non-MAH interventional trials reporting 37 
events, and 124 cases from nonclinical sources reporting 305 events. Please see Table 13 for a 
breakdown of the number of cases and events reported by year.

The mean age was 45.8 years (n=22) and the most common age group was 31-50 years. The country 
of origin for the majority of cases was Japan. For cases that reported outcomes, the case outcome was 
reported as resolved/resolving in 92.3%. There was 1 case that reported a fatal outcome: it involved a 
female patient (unknown age) with a history of end stage lung disease due to LAM who had been 
turned down for a lung transplant by two lung transplant centres. The patient had recurrent chest 
infections and each infection caused a further acute deterioration in lung function. The patient died 
from an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure and a chest infection. According to the 
patient's physician, there was no clinical or radiological evidence of sirolimus induced pneumonitis. 
Although starting sirolimus did not result in any objective improvement in lung function tests the 
subject reported a “subjective benefit”. No other information was provided.  
Non clinical study sources: There were 124 cases reporting 305 events from post-marketing sources. 
The mean age was 43.0 years (n=68) and the most common age group was 31-50 years. The country 
of origin for the majority of cases was Japan. For cases that reported outcomes, the case outcome was 
reported as resolved/resolving in 25.8% and not resolved in 13.7 %. There were 2 events (1.6 %) that 
resulted in a fatal outcome. The first case described a 45-year-old female patient with a history of LAM 
developed a right pneumothorax with a rapid deterioration of respiratory function requiring lung 
transplantation. After the transplantation, the patient experienced bilateral chylothorax. Rapamycin 
was initiated (2 months post-transplant). Infective pyrexia appeared within 3 months from a 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection. Thereafter, a MRSA pleural effusion was noted. 
Treatment was rendered and pyrexia subsided. However, pyrexia accompanied by neutropenia

recurred within a month. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected again from the “airway secretions”. 
Candida parapsilosis was detected from the pleural effusion and on a blood culture. Despite various 
therapies, the patient succumbed to Candida pleurisy within 7 months of the transplant. 
The second fatal case reported a 61-year-old female patient with a history of LAM, lymphoedema, 
renal surgery, uterine cancer, and uterine leiomyoma developed pneumonia. Rapalimus was 
discontinued and the patient recovered. The patient succumbed to respiratory failure 4 months later. 
The reporting physician assessed the death from respiratory failure as related to the primary disease of 
LAM. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the MILES trial, sirolimus was associated with a greater number of AEs as compared with placebo, 
although the rates of SAEs were similar in the two study groups. According to the MAH, the most 
common AEs during the treatment period for subjects receiving sirolimus were stomatitis, diarrhoea, 
acne, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and nausea, which are 
consistent with the known safety profile of sirolimus. The MAH noted that weight decrease was 
reported with a greater incidence with sirolimus when compared to placebo during the treatment 
period, and therefore proposed to add this as an adverse drug reaction in the sirolimus SmPC section 
4.8. The MAH argue that weight decrease should only be included for the LAM population. The clinical 
trials and publications on this matter in renal transplant patients’ point towards less weight gain for 
sirolimus treated patients but not weight loss per se. This may be explained by the concomitant 
medication in the transplant setting such as corticosteroids but does not preclude that the reason for 
less weight gain in transplant patients is mediated by the same mechanism as weight loss in LAM 
patients. Therefore the influence on weight might be less pronounced. The MAH included a description 
of safety in LAM patients in the SmPC. The adverse drug reactions observed in this study were 
consistent with the known safety profile of the product for the indication prophylaxis of organ rejection 
in renal transplantation with the addition of weight decreased, which was reported in the study at a 
greater incidence with Rapamune when compared to that observed with placebo (very common, 10.9% 
vs. common, 2.3%). These changes were considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Overall, the safety pool of sirolimus in LAM consists of 46 patients, which is rather limited and that and 
the characteristics of proposed indication LAM differs from the authorized indication renal transplant it 
has been discussed whether some kind of registry study would be feasible to collect long term safety 
data in this population. As discussed in sections 2.6 and 3.4, the applicant has provided a feasibility 
report in cooperation with existing registries and a protocol submission is expected by October 2018. 
In case it is deemed that the study is not feasible after protocol review, the need for an alternative 
proposal for collecting long term safety in this population will be re-discussed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general, the safety profile seems to be consistent with the known safety profile of sirolimus. The 
applicant sufficiently described the implications of the known safety profile in the claimed indication 
although that it is recognised that due to the small population of subjects investigated in the MILES 
trial, the assessment with relation to the totality of safety data has its limitations. Therefore the 
applicant will explore how to best monitor long term safety in post-authorisation phase either via 
existing registries or any other alternative ways. The proposed changes in the SmPC are acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare, progressive, frequently fatal cystic lung disease that 
predominantly affects young women of childbearing age. The clinical course of LAM is typically marked 
by the inexorable progressive loss of lung function, with resulting exercise intolerance and disability. 
Although recent studies suggest that there is variability in the rate of progression, LAM typically results 
in death or lung transplantation within 10 to 15 years. In 2014, the LAM Foundation has estimated that 
3-8 per million women are affected with non-heritable LAM or sporadic LAM (S-LAM) (15,000-23,000 
globally), and that approximately 30-40% of women with tuberous sclerosis complex have cystic 
pulmonary changes consistent with LAM.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is no approved medicinal product for the treatment of LAM. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MILES Study (Study 5702) was a phase III treatment, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, safety/efficacy study to assess sirolimus treatment in subjects (n=89) with LAM disease, of 
these 81 had spontaneous, S-LAM disease.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The MILES trial showed a statistical significance for the primary endpoint with a preserved pulmonary 
function with treatment with sirolimus for 1 year and determined by the change in FEV1. It was shown 
that the FEV1slope (±SE) from baseline to 12 months was 1±2 mL per month in the sirolimus group, 
which was not significantly different from zero. This was not the case in the placebo group were the 
FEV1slope (±SE) was −12±2 mL per month and the slope was significantly less than zero (p<0.0001), 
a finding that was consistent with declining lung function. The mean change from baseline in FEV1 
after 12 months treatment was 19±124 in the sirolimus group and -134±182 in the placebo group 
(p<0.0001). The baseline-adjusted difference in the mean change in FEV1 (sirolimus versus placebo) 
during the treatment periods was 151 mL (p<0.0001 for the between-group difference in LAM). A total 
of 46% of the subjects in the sirolimus group, as compared with 12% of the subjects in the placebo 
group, had FEV1 values at or above baseline values at the 12 month visit (p=0.0004). 
Furthermore, a significant effect was seen on some important secondary endpoint such as FVC and 
VAS-QOL score. 
Although the applicant provided additional scientific arguments for the validity of the chosen endpoints 
for the proposed indication, the wording of the indication was proposed by the applicant to be 
narrowed in order to precisely reflect the population in the MILES trial and to avoid a potential overlap 
in the treated population between Rapamune and the orphan medicinal product Votubia (see section 
2.4).  
Rapamune is indicated for the treatment of patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis 
with moderate lung disease or declining lung function (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For the quality of life parameters the results was significant in two of the investigated 4 different 
scores. There were significant differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in the score on the 
EuroQOL VAS for QOL and in the total score on the FPI. The changes in individual measures of SF-36 
and SGRQ did not differ significantly between the two groups.  No effects were observed on the 
diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide or on exercise tolerance and the positive effects on 
airflow vanished after sirolimus was discontinued. However, one explanation for this might be that 
sirolimus in LAM seems to stabilise pulmonary function and thereby decrease the progression of the 
disease. Therefore, patients may not notice any quality of life change in this relatively short duration of 
treatment and no advantage towards the placebo population can be seen. The inclusion criteria did not 
differentiate between S-LAM and LAM secondary to TCS. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most important common AEs with sirolimus are infections including opportunistic infections and 
reactivation of viral diseases. In addition to this, cases of interstitial lung disease (including 
pneumonitis and infrequently bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP) and pulmonary 
fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious aetiology have occurred in patients receiving 
immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In the MILES trial weight decrease was seen in the 
LAM population in the active treatment group. This observation was reflected in the SmPC. 
While the risks with sirolimus treatment are well known in the renal transplant patients, the long-term 
risk in the LAM population is not fully known. Thus, for evaluation of long term safety a registry was 
initially proposed but the applicant was of the opinion that this was not required because the overall 
safety profile of sirolimus is well-known since it has been approved for use in the post-transplant 
setting since 2001. Whilst this acknowledged, the applicant will elaborate on the possibilities of 
collaboration with the available clinical registries that is ongoing in the UK (English registry for 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis) and the US (NHLBI lymphangioleiomyomatosis registry). The MAH has 
contacted these registries and performed a feasibility assessment which is accepted with some 
remarks. In conclusion, the proposed plan to receive long-term data in this indication is considered 
acceptable pending further details to be provided in the draft protocol in the post-authorisation phase. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Since this is a small trial in a rare disease some unfavourable effects in the safety profile in this 
population may not have been detected. Furthermore, long-term safety will be evaluation post-
authorisation as the current data set is limited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The stabilisation of lung function in this severely ill patient population is considered important.  The 
primary endpoint and most of the secondary endpoints showed a beneficial effect although some of the 
secondary endpoints such as CO diffusion and exercise tolerance did not reach significant level.

The scientific base for the clinical relevance of using FEV1 as a primary endpoint was supported by the 
applicant by an in-depth description of published data both on the endpoint and on clinical relevance of 
the results with sirolimus treatment. In addition to this, a discussion on the results of long term 
treatment from different published references with treatment up to 3.5 years was provided. The CHMP 
concluded that the applicant adequately justified the use of FEV1 as the primary endpoint and 
described literature data on long term results and the clinical relevance of the results. However, based 
on the patient population in the trial, the indication was subsequently limited to S-LAM diagnosis only. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance for Rapamune used in the restricted sporadic LAM indication is considered 
positive by the CHMP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rapamune in the treatment of patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis 
with moderate lung disease or declining lung function is positive.

A31/0188 
The European Commission triggered a referral under 
12/11/2020 
12/02/2021 
Annex II 
Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
Karvezide EMEA/H/A-31/1471/C/221/0188 
Page 4/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Commission Decision was issued on 2 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP’s opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of 
the Marketing Authorisations should be varied. 
WS/1886/G 
This was an application for a group of variations

Based on a review of the available data including the MAH 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Group of variations consisting of:  
database and a literature review information was added to 
the SmPC to inform that irbesartan may induce 
hypoglycaemia, particularly in diabetic patients. In patients 
treated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood 
glucose monitoring should be considered; a dose 
Page 5/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be required 
when indicated. Hypoglycaemia has been added as an 
undesirable effect under frequency not known. 
Irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a 
clinical study, it was reported that irbesartan increased the 
Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 
1.8-fold and 1.3 fold, respectively, when administered 1 
hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two 
drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose adjustment of 
antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required. 
The product leaflet is updated accordingly. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
C.I.4 - Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to 
add information on hypoglycaemia based on a review 
of available data including the MAH 
pharmacovigilance data base and a literature review. 
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Update of 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add 
information on a drug -drug interaction with 
irbesartan and repaglinide based on a review of the 
available data including the MAH database and a 
literature review. The package leaflet is updated 
accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement the updated annex to the European 
Commission guideline on Excipients in the labelling 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use' to update the excipient sodium. The MAH also 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the PL.

For further information please refer to the Renin-
evidence from the scientific literature on dual RAS

identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines 
Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit-
risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the 
combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine 
whether any regulatory measures should be taken on 
the marketing authorisations of the products 
involved in this procedure.

SmPC, Annex 
A total of six cases of ‘Acute Myopia’ and ‘Secondary Acute 
of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning on 
II, Labelling 
Angle-Closure Glaucoma’ were identified following a 
the risk of 'acute myopia' and 'secondary acute 
angle-closure glaucoma' associated with the use of 
hydrochlorothiazide. Further, section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has been updated to include the two ADRs 
and PL 
comprehensive literature review by the MAH. Two of them 
were considered related to the combination of irbesartan 
and HCTZ. Five cases reported bilateral ‘acute angle-
closure glaucoma’ and one reported ‘acute myopia’ and 
Page 17/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
'acute myopia' and 'secondary acute angle-closure 
glaucoma' and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH has taken the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes to the 
annexes and to revise the annexes in line with the 
latest QRD template (version 8.1). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
‘perimacular oedema’. It is acknowledged that concomitant 
drugs and medical history are potential confounding factors 
in all cases identified, but nevertheless a role of HTCZ in 
these cases cannot be ruled out. 
Although the number of reported cases of ‘acute angle-
closure glaucoma’ and ‘acute myopia’ is very small, the 
CHMP was of the view that this information should be 
reflected as a warning in the SmPC due to the seriousness 
of these ADRs that can lead to important visual disability, 
and the fact that other sulfa-derivated drugs have also 
been reported to cause the ADRs bilateral ‘acute myopia’ 
and ‘acute angle-closure glaucoma’. 
Therefore, it was agreed to add the following warning to 
the SmPC: 
“‘Acute Myopia and Secondary Acute Angle-Closure 
Glaucoma: sulfonamide drugs or sulfonamide derivative 
drugs can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in 
transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. While 
hydrochlorothiazide is a sulfonamide, only isolated cases of 
acute angle-closure glaucoma have been reported so far 
with hydrochlorothiazide. Symptoms include acute onset of 
decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur 
within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute 
angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. 
The primary treatment is to discontinue drug intake as 
rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments 
may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure 
remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute 
angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of 
sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.” 
The overall benefit-risk balance for the combination

irbesartan + HCTZ remains unchanged.

MAH submitted a review of the Integrated Summary of 
Safety (ISS) as well as cumulative data from placebo-
controlled hypertensive trials CV131-037,-038,-039, and -
040. 
The updated section 4.8 includes now the following 
paragraph: 
Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination: 
Among 898 hypertensive patients who received various 
doses of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide (range: 37.5 
mg/6.25 mg to 300 mg/25mg) in placebo-controlled trials, 
29.5% of the patients experienced adverse reactions.  The 
most commonly reported ADRs were dizziness (5.6%), 
fatigue (4.9%), nausea/vomiting (1.8%), and abnormal 
urination (1.4%). In addition, increases in blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) (2.3%), creatine kinase (1.7%) and 
creatinine (1.1%) were also commonly observed in the 
trials.

particular to provide further guidance in the SPC to 
physicians on the recommended time between the 
statement regarding an interaction with colestyramine and

studies leading to a drug interaction between irbesartan, 
hydrochlorothiazide and cholestyramine. In a study with 
ten healthy adult male subjects evaluating appropriate 
dosing schedules of cholestyramine to minimize its effect 
on absorption, the investigators reported that the best 
dosing schedule for cholestyramine is 4 hours after 
hydrochlorothiazide (Hunninghake and Hibbard, 1986). On 
the other hand, it has been recommended that the 
administration of cholestyramine or colestipol have to be 
separated from the time of other medications (e.g. HCTZ) 
by 1-2 hours to minimize their effects on the absortion 
(Lamrini et al 1997; Hunninghake et al 1982).

have been assessed. There are no concrete data to support 
the contraindication of use of AIIRAs during breast-feeding. 
All AIIRA agents were found in the milk of lactating rats but 
no human data about their transfer into breast milk are 
available. There is only a theoretical presumption of low 
transport according to their high plasma protein binding 
and low oral availability. A harmonised wording 
recommending an alternative treatment with better 
established safety profiles during breast-feeding, especially 
while nursing a newborn or preterm infant, has been 
included in the section 4.6 of the SPC and section 2 of the

avoided. 
There are fewer data regarding the risks associated with 
first trimester exposure to Angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists (AIIRAs) than for ACE inhibitors. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that the risk is lower for AIIRAs, and it 
is considered that any conclusions on ACE inhibitors are 
also valid for AIIRAs. 
Therefore, the existing contraindication for the 2nd and 3rd 
trimester of pregnancy remained, but a harmonised 
wording regarding pregnancy across the class was 
introduced.

controlled, 8-week, parallel-arm study. A total of 697 
patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 150 mg/12.5 mg or to 
irbesartan 150 mg and systematically force-titrated (before 
assessing the response to the lower dose) after one week 
to irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 300 mg/25 mg or 
irbesartan 300 mg, respectively. 
The study recruited 58% males. The mean age of patients 
was 52.5 years, 13% were 65 years of age, and just 2% 
were 75 years of age. Twelve percent (12%) of patients 
were diabetic, 34% were hyperlipidemic and the most 
frequent cardiovascular condition was stable angina 
pectoris in 3.5% of the participants. 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the 
proportion of patients whose SeDBP was controlled (SeDBP 
< 90 mmHg) at Week 5 of treatment. Forty-seven percent 
(47.2%) of patients on the combination achieved trough 
SeDBP < 90 mmHg compared to 33.2% of patients on

irbesartan (p = 0.0005). The mean baseline BP was 
approximately 172/113 mmHg in each treatment group and 
decreases of SeSBP/SeDBP at 5 weeks were 30.8/24.0 
mmHg and 21.1/19.3 mmHg for 
irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, respectively 
(p < 0.0001). 
The types and incidences of adverse events reported for 
patients treated with the combination were similar to the 
adverse event profile for patients on monotherapy. During 
the 8 week treatment period, there were no reported cases 
of syncope in either treatment group. There were 0.6% and 
0% of patients with hypotension and 2.8% and 3.1% of 
patients with dizziness as adverse reactions reported in the 
combination and monotherapy groups, respectively.

this product is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. 
Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been 
investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. The 
bioequivalence study performed by the MAH is considered 
the most sensitive design to detect differences in the 
performance of the formulations. The trial was able to 
adequately characterise the exposure to irbesartan and 
hydrochlorothiazide, and demonstrated that all three 
formulations, 300 mg/25 mg coated and uncoated 
Irbesartan/ hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and 2   150 
mg/12.5 mg Avalide Tablets, are bioequivalent.

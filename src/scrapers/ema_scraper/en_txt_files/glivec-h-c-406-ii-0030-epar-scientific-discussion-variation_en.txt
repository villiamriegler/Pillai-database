SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1. 
Introduction 
The scope of this Type II variation is to extend the currently approved Glivec indications including the 
following  new  orphan  indication:  “Treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable,  recurrent  and/or 
metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)”.The proposed dose is 800 mg/day. 
Dermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans  is  a  rare  monoclonal  cutaneous  soft  tissue  sarcoma.  It  is  a  slowly 
evolutive  lesion  that  leads  to  local  malignancy.  The  estimated  prevalence  of  DFSP  in  the  European 
Union  member  states  is  0.93  per  10,000.  Clinically,  DFSP  initially  presents  as  an  asymptomatic, 
indolent, indurated plaque. The sarcoma increases in size slowly and over a period of years protuberant 
nodules  develop  within the plaque. Once nodules develop, growth can become more rapid, and up to 
25% of patients may complain of ulceration, bleeding, or pain at the lesion site. It is highly invasive, 
can be locally aggressive and has significant risk of recurrence, though it rarely metastasizes. The most 
common  site  of  origin  is  the  skin  of  the  trunk  (50%  to  60%),  followed  by  the  proximal  extremities 
(20% to 30%), and the head and neck (10% to 15%). The lesion tends to grow slowly over several years 
so that treatment is frequently delayed, and all too often, inadequate. 
This infiltrative tumour is characterized by translocations activating PDGF genes, observed in 90% of 
the  cases.  The  translocation  t(17:22)(q22:q13)  which  often  manifests  itself  as  a  supernumerary  ring 
chromosome  r(17:22).  The  translocation  results  in  the  fusion  of  2  genes,  the  collagen  type  1  alpha 
1(COL1A1) and platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (PDGFβ) gene. This aberrant gene produces the 
to  mature  PDGFβ  protein, 
COL1A1/PDGFβ 
indistinguishable  from  wild-type  PDGFβ.  There  is  a  characteristic  amplification  of  sequences  from 
chromosomes  17q  and  22q,  demarcated  by  the  COL1A1  and  PDGFβ  genes,  respectively,  and  is 
associated  with  elevated  expression  of  the  amplified  genes.  The  mechanism  underlying  DFSP 
oncogenesis  appears  to  be  an  excessive  autocrine  stimulation  of  wild-type  PDGFRβ  in  cells  that 
normally produce collagen. 
is  eventually  processed 
fusion  protein 
that 
Both  a  “classic”  form  (most  prevalent)  and  a  “high-grade”  variant  fibrosarcomatous  form  (FSDFSP) 
have been described. Among the patients with classic DFSP, the recurrence rate is approximately 19% 
at  5  years,  compared  with  72%  among  the  patients  with  FS-DFSP.  Thus,  a  more  intensive  treatment 
approach should be considered for the latter. 
Because DFSP tends to spread to multiple microscopic projections away from the visible lesions, wide 
local surgical excision is the main therapy. However, the local recurrence rate is high (20% to 60%). 
The post-surgical recurrence rate is approximately 50% with standard surgery and 13 to 20% after wide 
excision. Mohs micrographic surgery using successive fixed-tissue sections to guide surgical removal is 
relatively  tissue  sparing,  but  is  labor  intensive.  Results  may  also  depend  from  the  surgical  policy 
followed  at  each  institution.  Recent  data  from  a  large  series  from  a  single  institution  indicated  that  a 
more aggressive surgical policy with reconstructive surgery could reduce the recurrence rate to a crude 
cumulative incidence at 5 year of 2% in patients with primary tumour and 5% in patients with recurrent 
tumour. A non-statistical difference in the 5-year crude cumulative incidence of recurrence (2.3% and 
8.0% respectively) and distant metastasis (1.4% and 3.6% respectively) was observed between patients 
with and without disease-free margins. Although more effective at establishing local control of DFSP, 
wide excision frequently leads to significantly reduced quality of life due to dysfunctional impairment 
and cosmetic defects. 
Adjuvant radiotherapy may be of value in patients who have or who are likely to have close or positive 
margins,  but  there  is  limited  experience  with  this  therapy  and  it  is  of  limited  value  in  macroscopic 
disease.  Chemotherapy  is  not  extensively  used  in  DFSP,  recurrences  are  largely  local  and  metastases 
are  rare.  Surgical  resection  with  wide  local  excision  margins  is  therefore  the  accepted  treatment  for 
DFSP. Maximizing local tumour control often entails excision of considerable tissue volumes that can 
include underlying striated muscle and bone. Wide surgical margins may not be possible in head and 
neck  tumours  or  may  contribute  to  substantial  morbidity  or  considerable  functional  and  cosmetic 
deficits.

Metastasis of DFSP is rare, occurring in approximately 1% to 4% of cases, but is a definite risk and it 
can contribute to mortality associated with uncontrolled disease.  
2.  Clinical aspects 
Imatinib  inhibits  the  activity  of  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptors  α  and  β  (PDGFRα  and 
PDGFRβ). The over-expression of PDGFBB protein, makes DFSP a candidate for Imatinib treatment. 
As  mentioned,  DFSP  is  characterized  by  the  translocation  t(17:22)(q22:q13)  which  results  in  the 
fusion of COL1A1 and PDGFβ genes. This translocation was indeed identified in 10 out of the 18 the 
patients described in this submission. 
In  the  submitted  documentation,  the  clinical  data  that  support  the  claimed  indication  and  posologic 
regimen are limited to the experience in 18 patients: 
-  A  phase  II  open  label  [Study  B2225]  in  patients  with  life  threatening  diseases,  including  DFSP, 
- 
known to be associated with one or more imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases (N=12) 
Five publications (N=6) (Maki, et al 2002, Rubin, et al 2002, Labropoulos et al 2005, Mizutani et 
al 2004, Price, et al 2005). 
Clinical pharmacology. 
Detailed Clinical Pharmacology was already studied in previous applications of this product.  
Pharmacokinetic studies in DFSP patients 
B2225 PK study. 
In sparse pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected after the first dose on day 1 and at steady state 
on day 29. The sampling times depended on the convenience of the patient, one being taken between 1 
hour and 3 hours and one between 6 hours and 9 hours after the morning dose, and another one before 
dose  on  the  following  day.  Full  PK  profile  samples  were  taken  from  selected  patients  where  it  was 
deemed necessary, e.g.  
-  when concomitant medication was known or suspected to interact with imatinib 
- 
- 
patients with liver impairment (e.g. metastases) 
patients with metabolic, absorption, excretion disorders 
Basic PK characteristics of Imatinib and its major metabolite CGP74588 were measured and described. 
On  day  1,  the full-profile had the time  schedule:  0 hr (pre-dose),  1 hr,  2 hrs, 3 hrs, 8  hrs,  24 hrs (no 
study drug), 48 hrs (no study drug), and 72 hrs (prior to resuming study drug). 
On day 29 the full-profile had the time schedule: 0 hr (pre-dose), 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs, 8 hrs, and 24 hrs 
(prior to resuming study drug). 
Plasma  concentrations  of  imatinib  and  its  major  metabolite  CGP74588  were  determined  by  a  high 
performance liquid chromatography MS/MS method (LC/MS/MS).  
The sparse PK concentrations after single and multiple doses were tabulated with descriptive statistics 
for each dose level. Where full PK profiles were available, the basic PK parameters of Imatinib and its 
metabolite (tmax, Cmax, AUCτ and AUC) were determined. 
PK data are available at different dose levels from 200 mg to 800 mg per day following the first dose 
on day 1 and at steady state on day 29 either by intensive PK sampling or sparse PK sampling . The 
majority of the PK data are from the 400 mg qd dose. Figure and table below summarise the PK profile 
of imatinib in patients with DFSP. The metabolite CGP74588 showed a greater accumulation, 2-3 fold, 
and  longer  half-life,  36  hours,  than  the  parent  compound.  At  steady  state,  the  imatinib  to  metabolite 
exposure  ratio  is  approximately  5-fold.  These  results  are  comparable  with  those  observed  in  patients

with  GIST,  suggesting  a  similar  PK  between  solid  tumour  patients  and  GIST  patients,  although  the 
results should be interpreted with caution due to the amount of missing data.

Pharmacodynamics  
Mechanism of Action 
As  already  mentioned,  Dermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans  is  characterized  by  the  translocation 
t(17:22)(q22:q13) which results in the fusion of the collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) and the platelet-
derived  growth  factor  B-chain  (PDGFβ)  genes.  This  aberrant  gene  produces  the  COL1A1/PDGFβ 
fusion  protein  that  is  processed  to  mature  PDGFBB  protein,  indistinguishable  from  wild-type 
PDGFBB, with an excessive autocrine stimulation of wild-type PDGFRβ in cells that normally produce 
collagen. Imatinib inhibits the activity of the platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β (PDGFRα 
and  PDGFRβ).  The  over-expression  of  PDGFBB  protein,  makes  DFSP  a  candidate  for  Imatinib 
treatment. 
Preclinical  research  has  shown  that  imatinib  selectively  inhibits  the  Abl  and  PDGF  receptor  tyrosine 
kinases in vitro and blocks cellular proliferation and tumour growth of Bcr-Abl- or v- Abl-expressing 
cells,  leading  to  its  evaluation  for  use  in  Ph+  CML.  When  tested  for  its  effects  on  PDGF-mediated 
cellular  events,  imatinib  was  shown  to  inhibit  PDGFα-  and  PDGFβ-  stimulated  signaling  and 
proliferation. Moreover, showed that imatinib disrupted the PDGFR autocrine loops and inhibited the 
proliferation of human glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. 
Additional  preclinical  evidence  for  the  potential  use  of  imatinib  in  DFSP  has  been  provided  from 
studies using COL1A1-PDGFβ transformed mouse fibroblasts as well as primary cultures derived from 
human  DFSP  tumours.  In  NIH  3T3  fibroblasts  carrying  the  DFSP-associated  COL1A1-PDGFβ 
rearrangement the growth rate was reduced and the transformed phenotype reverted in the presence of 
imatinib. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore,  using  cultures  derived  from  human  DFSP  and  giant  cell  fibroblastoma,  showed  that 
imatinib  inhibits  autocrine  PDGFRβ  signaling  and  reduces  tumour  growth  in  vitro  and  in  mice;  the 
growth inhibitory effect was predominantly mediated by induction of apoptosis. 
The dependency of fibroblasts transformed by transfection of DFSP-derived fusion genes from PDGF 
receptor signaling has been demonstrated in vitro (Greco, et al 1998, Shimizu, et al 1999, Greco, et al 
20001).  The  growth  rate  of  a  morphologically-transformed  cell  line  carrying  the  DFSP-associated 
COL1A1/PDGFβ rearrangement was reduced and the associated transformed phenotype changed to a 
flattened one in presence of imatinib (Greco, et al 2001). This effect could be reversed on removal of 
the  inhibitor.  The  growth  rate  of  tumours  induced  by  this  cell  line  in  nude  mice  was  reduced  by 
imatinib administration (Shimizu, et al 1999). Also, Sjoblom, et al (2001) identified activated PDGFRβ 
in  vitro  in  3  different  primary  cell  cultures  from  DFSP  and  giant  cell  fibroblastoma  tumours.  In 
comparison with normal fibroblasts, these cell lines showed increased sensitivity to imatinib, such that 
phosphorylation  (activation)  of  PDGFRβ  was  inhibited.  Furthermore,  in  vitro  experimentation  with 
tumour  cells  grown  in  the  presence  of  1  µmol/L  of  imatinib  showed  inhibition  of  proliferation.  The 
growth-inhibitory effects of imatinib were then replicated in tumours induced in mice from one of the 
DFSP primary cultures, leading to the conclusion that imatinib inhibited DFSP cell growth in vitro and 
in vivo primarily through induction of apoptosis (Sjoblom, et al 2201). 
Clinical efficacy 
This  application  is  supported  by  phase  II  open  label  [Study  B2225]  in  patients  with  life  threatening 
diseases, including DFSP, known to be associated with one or more imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases 
and five publications. The total number of DFSP patients enclosed in this application is 18 (12 from 
study B2225 and 6 from the publications).

Main study (B2225) 
Title of study: Open Label, Pilot Phase II Study of STI571 (Imatinib) in Patients with Life Threatening 
Diseases Known to be Associated with one or more STI571-Sensitive Tyrosine Kinases. 
Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with life threatening diseases known to 
be associated with one or  more of the known imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases, following failure of 
standard therapeutic options. 
Secondary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of imatinib in these populations. 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of imatinib in selected patients. 
To  assess,  where  feasible,  the  functional  significance  of  relevant  signal-transduction  components  in 
target tissues by: 
- Measurement of indices of cellular proliferation 
-  Evaluation  of  expression  and  activation  status  of  the  relevant  protein  tyrosine  kinases  (PTK)  or 
associated signaling molecules 
- Correlation of changes in the above findings with clinical outcomes. 
Inclusion criteria 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Five to ten patients per condition, or disease were initially accepted for treatment. It was planned that 
lack of clinical efficacy coupled with lack of demonstration of any surrogate pharmacodynamic effect 
(target PTK inhibition in the first 5 patients) excluded future patients with the same conditioner disease 
from the study. Patients included in the study were male or female who were ≥ 15 years of age. Had a 
malignant  and/or  a  life  threatening  disease  documented  by  conventional  criteria  to  be  refractory  to 
standard,  approved  therapy,  or  for  which  no  conventional  beneficial  therapies  existed.  Experimental 
documentation had been confirmed to support the possible functional significance of one or more of the 
relevant imatinib-sensitive PTKs, a performance status 0, 1, or 2 (ECOG), adequate end organ function 
or  in  the  case  of  patients  with  life-threatening  diseases  were  eligible  for  the  study  despite  deviation 
from the above criteria, when approved by Novartis. 
Female  patients  of  child-bearing  potential  must  have  had  a  negative  pregnancy  test  and  agreed  to  a 
method of birth control. Life expectancy of more than 3 months in the absence of any intervention was 
required. Patients must have had a fresh tissue biopsy prior to treatment with imatinib and an additional 
biopsy was required while undergoing treatment in the absence of serious safety concerns.  
Exclusion criteria 
Patients with a condition which was investigated or planned for investigation in other imatinib clinical 
protocols, e.g. SCLC, GIST, prostate cancer or glioma or patients treated with any other investigational 
agents  within 28 days of first  day of study drug  dosing  were not  included in the  study.  Patients  with 
another primary malignancy or patients who had received chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for 
nitrosourea, mitomycin-C or any antibody therapy) prior to study entry were excluded.

Dose selection 
The planned starting dose differed between the two groups of malignancies, with the 45 patients with 
hematological malignancies initially receiving imatinib at 400 mg p.o. daily with a provision for a dose 
increase  up  to  800  mg  p.o.  daily  if  progression  or  absence  of  significant  improvement  in  the  disease 
was observed after at least 4 weeks of therapy. 
The  other  140  patients  with  solid  tumours  initially  received  imatinib  at  800  mg  p.o.  daily  with  a 
provision  for  a  dose  increase  up  to  1000  mg  p.o.  daily  if  progression  or  absence  of  significant 
improvement in the disease was observed after at least 8 weeks in solid tumour of therapy.

Efficacy results 
The efficacy of imatinib was evaluated on the basis of the frequency of the tumour response. 
Overall  best  response  was  tabulated  based  on  modified  SWOG  criteria  taking  into  account  the 
investigator’s assessment of a patient’s tumour response at each assessment.  
Wherever possible, the status of tumour lesions in patients with solid tumours was assessed by means 
of  CT  or  MRI.  For  patients  with  DFSP,  the  skin  lesions  were  evaluated  for  surface  area,  depth, 
thickness and consistency of the lesions. The defined secondary endpoint was the ECOG status.  
Tissue samples were to be collected when possible and analyzed for the possible functional significance 
of one or more of the relevant imatinib-sensitive PTKs. Ideally pre- and post treatment samples were to 
be obtained. Whenever feasible, functional significance of relevant cell-signaling components in target 
tissues  were  to  be  described  at  the  beginning  of  the  study,  including  measure  of  indices  of  cellular 
proliferation, evaluation of expression and activation, (e.g. phosphorylation) status of the relevant PTKs 
or associated effector molecules and any changes in these findings were to be correlated with clinical 
outcomes.  However,  the  tissue  sample  collection  of  pre-  and  during-  treatment  specimens  and  their 
analysis  proved  to  be  very  challenging  due  to  the  following  factors:  (i)  the  rarity  of  the  diseases 
investigated,  hence  only  few  samples  were  obtained  hampering  the  possibility  of  running  correlative 
analysis;  (ii) samples  containing  necrosis  or  connective  tissue  rather  than  malignant  cells;  (3)  lack  of 
paired samples in many cases. 
All statistical procedures are descriptive in nature.

Out of the  12  DFSP patients enrolled,  one experienced  a complete  response (CR) and  8 others  had a 
partial  response  (PR)  as  their  best  response.  Two  patients  subsequently  progressed,  one  with  PR 
(patient  501/154)  and  one  with  subsequent  complete  surgical  resection  (patient  504/044).  Patient 
501/154 experienced a massive disease progression after an initial response to the study drug. A third 
responding  patient  101/182  attained  PR  but  was  prematurely  withdrawn  on  day  184  of  the  study 
because of a CTC grade 3 elevation of AST and ALT. 
Tumour  response  data  are  not  available  for  three  patients.  In  three  patients  with  locally  advanced 
disease,  therapy  was  withdrawn  when  the  tumour  had  regressed  to  such  an  extent  that  a  successful 
surgical  resection  was  possible,  making  the  patients  disease-free,  while  in  a  fourth  patient  (504/044) 
surgery was performed successfully as soon as progression was detected.  
Of  note,  three  more  patients  were  reported  as  being  in  CR  in  Mc  Arthur,  el  al  (2005)  after  longer 
follow-up.

DFSP Patient disposition 
The median duration of therapy was 6.2 months with a minimum duration of 4 days and a maximum 
duration of 595 days. In 4 patients, the therapy was prematurely withdrawn because of remission of the 
disease. 
Ten  patients  with  DFSP  were  enrolled  and  treated  with  400  mg  of  imitibib  twice  daily.  Of  the  10 
patients, 8 had locally advanced disease and 2 had metastasic disease. Four of the patients with locally 
advanced  disease  had  a  complete  response    and  4  had a  partial  response  and  were  disease-  free  after 
surgical resection. One patient with metastasic disease had a partial response to imatinib, with a clear 
demonstration  of  response  after  3  months  of  therapy,  but  experienced  disease  progression  after  7 
months of therapy. The patient who did not respond had widespread metastatic disease and was found 
to have a complex genotype with no obvious t(12:22) translocation.

Secondary endpoints 
The evolution of the ECOG status for patients with DFSP is summarized below 
The  DFSP  population  had  an  ECOG  performance  status  at  baseline  similar  to  that  of  the  overall 
population. The ECOG performance status worsened in three patients, one of them deteriorating from 
ECOG 3 to 4, and improved in one patient from ECOG 2 to 0.  
Efficacy in Published literature 
All publications refer to case reports, with 6 patients in total. The doses were 400mg/day in three of

Meta-analyses of published data 
Bias of publication 
As a previous step to the formal meta-analysis a funnel plot is presented below: 
The  main  conclusion  from  this  plot  is  that  a  publication  bias  cannot  be  discharged  due  to  the 
asymmetry of the plot.  
The results observed in the STI571B2225 trial, although slightly lower, could be considered consistent 
with the results of the pooled published data. 
Clinical safety 
Safety data were obtained from study B2225 up to the cut-off date of 31-Dec-2004. 
Some others safety data have been extracted from the published case reports (Maki, et al 2002, Rubin, 
el al 2002, Mirzutani, el al 2004, Price et al 2005, Labropoulos, et al 2005). 
Additional sources of data consisted of:  
-  A worldwide literature search, to capture any investigator reports on safety aspects not included in 
the study reports (date of search: 14- Oct-2005). 
-  A  review  of  safety  reports  from  ongoing  trials  submitted  to  the  Novartis  Clinical  safety  and 
Epidemiology department (cut-off date: 10 May 2005), and 
-  A review of post- marketing surveillance data from the 99 countries in which Glivec is registered 
for marketing (cut-off date:10 May 2005). 
Study B2225 Safety data. 
Patient exposure 
Patients with hematological malignancies tended to stay on treatment longer, while patients with solid 
tumour dropped out from the study rather quickly, with 72.9% of them leaving the study after 5 months 
or  less  vs.  48.9%  for  patients  with  hematological  malignancies.  The  median  exposure  clearly reflects 
this  phenomenon,  with  a  median  exposure  of  2.6  months  for  patients  with  solid  tumours  (max  42.7 
months),  5.1  months for  patients with  haematological  malignancies (max  26.7  months). Patients  with 
DFSP  were  the  ones  with  longer  exposure  in  the  solid  tumour  group,  with  a  mean  exposure  of  9.2 
months, and a median of 6.2 months. 
Long-term exposure 
Data concerning long-term exposure to imatinib is available from the regular safety updates submitted 
to the authorities, the patient treated for longest in this study was patient 101/012, a 63 year old male 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suffering from adenoid cystic carcinoma in whom therapy was withdrawn after 811 days because of an 
unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. 
Adverse events 
Information about all AEs, whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by investigator questioning, 
or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, was collected and recorded on 
the  AE  CRF  and  followed  as  appropriate.  An  AE  was  defined  as  any  undesirable  sign,  symptom  or 
medical  condition  occurring  after  starting  study  treatment,  even  if  not  considered  to  be  treatment-
related. 
Overall,  the  most  frequently  affected  SOCs  in  all  patients  in  both  malignancy  types  were  the 
gastrointestinal system, the general disorders or disorders of the skin, the musculoskeletal, respiratory 
and  nervous  systems.  Patients  with  hematological  malignancies  had  a  higher  frequency  of  skin 
disorders (68.9% vs.57.1%), blood disorders (48.9% vs. 24.3%) and cardiac disorders (11.1% vs. 6.4%) 
than  patients  with  solid  tumours  and  a  lower  frequency  of  general  disorders  (62.2%  vs.  80.7%),  of 
metabolic and nutrition disorders (24.4% vs. 42.1%) and of eye disorders (13.3% vs. 26.4%). 
Next table presents the most common adverse events in patients with DFSP by system organ class. Of 
note,  all  patients  experienced  at  least  one  adverse  event,  the  most  common  being  gastroinstestinal, 
cutaneous and general disorders. 
Most frequently adverse events in the DFSP population

One patient was withdrawn from treatment because of transaminitis, considered drug- related. No SAE 
affecting  hepatobiliary  system  was  reported.  Treatment  was  also  withdrawn  because  of  a 
gastrointestinal  event,  drug  related  nausea  and/or  vomiting  in  a  patient  with  recurrent  progressive 
DFSP.  No  patient  experienced  SAEs  involving  nervous  system  and  no  patient  was  withdrawn  from 
treatment  because  of  nervous  system  AEs.  The  worst  haematological  events  were  CTC  grade  3  in 
severity, except one case of CTC grade 4 neutropenia. 
The  results  reveal  that  imatinib  was  generally  well  tolerated  and  the  pattern  of  AEs  observed  was 
similar, in terms of the nature, frequency and severity of the events reported, to those observed in the 
treatment of patients suffering from CML or GIST. 
Overall discussion and Benefit-risk assessment. 
DFSP is an uncommon, low-grade sarcoma of fibroblast origin with an estimated incidence rate below 
of 1 case per million persons per year. It rarely metastasises. First line treatment of DSFP is surgical. 
Since  DFSP  has  irregular  shapes  and  frequent  finger-like  extensions,  incomplete  removal  and 
subsequent  recurrence  are  common.  The  surgical  approach  to  DFSP  must  be  meticulously  planned. 
Size and location of tumour will dictate the most appropriate surgical procedure. 
In some cases, tumour is unresectable or other patients suffered from recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP 
who are not eligible for surgery. In these cases, other treatment alternatives should be explored.  
At present, no single agent has a recognised role as chemotherapeutic option for DFSP. 
The MAH provide limited data on the antitumour effect of imatinib in patients with DFSP, due to the 
extreme  rarity  of  this  disease.  Nevertheless,  the  biological  plausability  is  undisputable.  Trial  B2225 
found  8 responses (1CR)  out of 12  patients,  and  finally 3  of the  7  PR were  afterwards published  as 
complete responses. Moreover, 6 additional patients from published case-reports are also provided.  
Additional studies are ongoing, trying to enrol patients at the moment, so there are no results yet.   
In  addition  to  the  dossier  filed,  information  on  five  ongoing  and  two  planned  investigator-initiated 
trials  for sarcomas including DFSP  patients was  provided. The  accrual  of  these  trials  has  been  slow 
due to the rarity of the disease and no conclusions can be drawn from these studies at this time. These 
investigator-initiated  trials  for  sarcomas  including  DFSP  patients  are  exploratory  and  uncontrolled. 
Final  results  from  these  investigator-initiated  trials  will  be  provided  when  completed.  It  should  be 
noted however, that some of these studies have been open for enrollment for years, but have not yet 
approached their accrual goals. Only study CSTI571BFR16 has obtained results at date. The response 
rate  observed  is  50  %  (15  patients  enrolled)  in  contrast  to  the  overall  response  rate  of  83%  in  the 
population  of  patients  with  DFSP  in  Study  B2225.  However,  the  used  dose  is  600mg  instead  of 
800mg, and only during a 2 months period time.  
With  regard  to  the  safety  of  imatinib,  the  results  from  the  clinical  trials  and  those  observed  in  the 
treatment of patients suffering from CML or GIST, reveal that in these group of patients, imatinib was 
generally well tolerated. Taking into account that no toxicity problems were found with a dose of 800 
mg/daily, and due to the rarity of the disease, which makes it difficult to collect dose-response data, 
and considering that a better response is achieved with 800 mg dose, rather than 600 mg or 400 mg, 
the proposed dose acceptable. 
Mohs  Micrographic  surgery  and  surgical  resection  with  local  excision  margins  are  still  the  primary 
option for DFSP patients. Glivec could play an important role for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable DFSP and adult patients with recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for 
surgery. 
It is true that due to the rarity of the disease, submitted data seems limited, so it is important that the 
ongoing clinical trials provide more data to complete the information about the true effect of Glivec.  
The MAH should commit to provide yearly updated information on ongoing CTs of Glivec in DFSP. 
The final results of these studies should be provided when available. Due to the rarity of the disease 
and the independent sponsorship of these trials, the request of a clear-cut deadline for the submission 
of the final results seems unrealistic.

Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these 
commitments (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report):

Description 
To provide yearly updated information on ongoing CTs of Glivec 
in DFSP. The final results of these studies should be provided 
when available.  
Novartis is aware of five ongoing and two planned investigator-
initiated trials for sarcomas including DFSP patients. Novartis is 
providing drug and further support for the conduct of these 
studies. The accrual of these trials has been slow due to the rarity 
of the disease and no conclusions can be drawn from these studies 
at this time. These investigator-initiated trials for sarcomas 
including DFSP patients are exploratory and uncontrolled.  
Novartis does not have primary access to the data on these 
ongoing studies.  Novartis will provide the EMEA with any 
public disclosure of the results of these trials and update the 
EMEA on the accrual progress on these trials.

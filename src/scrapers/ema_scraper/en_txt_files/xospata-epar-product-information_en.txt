4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Xospata is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Xospata should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer therapies.  
Before taking gilteritinib, relapsed or refractory AML patients must have confirmation of FMS-like 
tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation (internal tandem duplication [ITD] or tyrosine kinase domain 
[TKD]) using a validated test. 
Xospata may be re-initiated in patients following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 
(see Table 1). 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose is 120 mg gilteritinib (three 40 mg tablets) once daily. 
Blood chemistries, including creatine phosphokinase, should be assessed prior to initiation of 
treatment, on day 15 and monthly for the duration of treatment.  
An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed before initiation of gilteritinib treatment, on day 8 
and 15 of cycle 1 and prior to the start of the next three subsequent months of treatment (see sections 
4.4 and 4.8).  
Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from Xospata or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. Response may be delayed; therefore, continuation of treatment at the 
prescribed dose for up to 6 months should be considered to allow time for a clinical response. 
In the absence of a response [patient did not achieve a composite complete remission (CRc)] after 4 
weeks of treatment, the dose can be increased to 200 mg (five 40 mg tablets) once daily, if tolerated or 
clinically warranted.

prior to administration of the conditioning 
regimen for HSCT.  
• 
•  Treatment can be resumed 30 days after 
HSCT if engraftment was successful, the 
patient did not have grade ≥2 acute graft 
versus host disease and was in CRcc. 
a.  Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe, Grade 4 is life-threatening. 
b.  The daily dose can be reduced from 120 mg to 80 mg or from 200 mg to 120 mg. 
c.  CRc is defined as the remission rate of all CR (see section 5.1 for definition of CR), CRp 
[achieved CR except for incomplete platelet recovery (<100 x 109/L)] and CRi (achieved all 
criteria for CR except for incomplete haematological recovery with residual neutropenia <1 x 
109/L with or without complete platelet recovery). 
Xospata should be administered at about the same time each day. If a dose is missed or not taken at the 
usual time, the dose should be administered as soon as possible on the same day, and patients should 
return to the normal schedule the following day. If vomiting occurs after dosing, patients should not 
take another dose but should return to the normal schedule the following day. 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
3 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh 
Class B) hepatic impairment. Xospata is not recommended for use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh 
Class C) hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in this population (see 
section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of Xospata in children aged below 18 years has not yet been established.  
No data are available. Due to in vitro binding to 5HT2B (see section 4.5), there is a potential impact on 
cardiac development in patients less than 6 months of age. 
Method of administration  
Xospata is for oral use.  
The tablets can be taken with or without food. They should be swallowed whole with water and should 
not be broken or crushed.  
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Differentiation syndrome  
Gilteritinib has been associated with differentiation syndrome (see section 4.8). Differentiation 
syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be 
life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms and clinical findings of differentiation syndrome 
include fever, dyspnoea, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, hypotension, rapid 
weight gain, peripheral oedema, rash, and renal dysfunction.  
If differentiation syndrome is suspected, corticosteroid therapy should be initiated along with 
hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution. If severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more 
than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids, Xospata should be interrupted until signs and 
symptoms are no longer severe (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  
Corticosteroids can be tapered after resolution of symptoms and should be administered for a 
minimum of 3 days. Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation 
of corticosteroid treatment. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  
There have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving 
Xospata (see section 4.8). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with 
rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, visual and neurological 
disturbances, with or without associated hypertension and altered mental status. If PRES is suspected, 
it should be confirmed by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Discontinuation of Xospata in patients who develop PRES is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Prolonged QT interval 
Gilteritinib has been associated with prolonged cardiac ventricular repolarisation (QT Interval) (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.1). QT prolongation can be observed in the first three months of treatment with 
gilteritinib. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed prior to initiation of treatment, 
on day 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and prior to the start of the next three subsequent months of treatment. 
Caution is warranted in patients with relevant cardiac history. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia 
may increase the QT prolongation risk. Hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia should therefore be 
corrected prior to and during Xospata treatment. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
Xospata should be interrupted in patients who have a QTcF >500 msec (see section 4.2).  
The decision to re-introduce gilteritinib treatment after an event of QT prolongation should be based 
on a careful consideration of benefits and risks. If Xospata is re-introduced at a reduced dose, ECG 
should be performed after 15 days of dosing, and prior to the start of the next three subsequent months 
of treatment. In clinical studies, 12 patients had QTcF >500 msec. Three patients interrupted and re-
initiated treatment without recurrence of QT prolongation. 
Pancreatitis 
There have been reports of pancreatitis. Patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of 
pancreatitis should be evaluated and monitored. Xospata should be interrupted and can be resumed at a 
reduced dose when the signs and symptoms of pancreatitis have resolved (see section 4.2).  
Severe renal impairment 
Gilteritinib exposure may be increased in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal 
disease. Patients should be closely monitored for toxicities during administration of Xospata (see 
section 5.2). 
Interactions 
Co-administration of CYP3A/P-gp inducers may lead to decreased gilteritinib exposure and 
consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of gilteritinib with strong 
CYP3A4/P-gp inducers should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Caution is required when concomitantly prescribing gilteritinib with medicinal products that are strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A, P-gp and/or breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) (such as, but not limited to, 
voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and clarithromycin) because they can increase gilteritinib 
exposure. Alternative medicinal products that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A, P-gp and/or BCRP 
activity should be considered. In situations where satisfactory therapeutic alternatives do not exist, 
patients should be closely monitored for toxicities during administration of gilteritinib (see 
section 4.5). 
Gilteritinib may reduce the effects of medicinal products that target 5HT2B receptor or sigma 
nonspecific receptors. Therefore, concomitant use of gilteritinib with these products should be avoided 
unless use is considered essential for the care of the patient (see section 4.5). 
Embryofoetal toxicity and contraception   
Pregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
Females of reproductive potential should be advised to have a pregnancy test within seven days prior 
to starting treatment with Xospata and to use effective contraception during treatment with Xospata 
and for at least 6 months after stopping treatment. Women using hormonal contraceptives should add a 
barrier method of contraception. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should be 
advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of 
Xospata.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Gilteritinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, which can be induced or inhibited by a 
number of concomitant medicinal products. 
Effects of other medicinal products on Xospata 
CYP3A/P-gp Inducers 
Concomitant use of Xospata with strong CYP3A/P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin and 
St. John’s wort) should be avoided because they can decrease gilteritinib plasma concentrations. In 
healthy subjects, co-administration of rifampicin (600 mg), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, to steady 
state with a single 20 mg dose of gilteritinib decreased gilteritinib mean Cmax by 27% and mean AUCinf 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by 70%, respectively, compared to subjects administered a single dose of gilteritinib alone (see 
section 4.4). 
CYP3A, P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A, P-gp and/or BCRP (e.g., voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, 
clarithromycin, erythromycin, captopril, carvedilol, ritonavir, azithromycin) can increase gilteritinib 
plasma concentrations. A single, 10 mg dose of gilteritinib co-administered with itraconazole (200 mg 
once daily for 28 days), a strong CYP3A, P-gp and BCRPinhibitor, to healthy subjects resulted in an 
approximate 20% increase in mean Cmax and 2.2-fold increase in mean AUCinf relative to subjects 
administered a single dose of gilteritinib alone. Gilteritinib exposure increased approximately 1.5-fold 
in patients with relapsed or refractory AML when co-administered with a strong CYP3A, P-gp and/or 
BCRP inhibitor (see section 4.4). 
Effects of Xospata on other medicinal products 
Gilteritinib as an inhibitor or inducer 
Gilteritinib is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 or an inhibitor of MATE1 in vivo. The 
pharmacokinetics of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) were not significantly (Cmax and AUC 
increased approximately 10%) affected after once-daily administration of gilteritinib (300 mg) for 
15 days in patients with FLT3-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. Additionally, the 
pharmacokinetics of cephalexin (a sensitive MATE1 substrate) were not significantly (Cmax and AUC 
decreased by less than 10%) affected after once daily administration of gilteritinib (200 mg) for 15 
days in patients with FLT3-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. 
Gilteritinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP and OCT1 in vitro. As no clinical data is available, it cannot 
be excluded that gilteritinib could inhibit these transporters at a therapeutic dose. Caution is advised 
during co-administration of gilteritinib with substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran etexilate), 
BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone, methotrexate, rosuvastatin) and OCT1 (e.g., metformin). 
5HT2B receptor or sigma nonspecific receptor 
Based on in vitro data, gilteritinib may reduce the effects of medicinal products that target 5HT2B 
receptor or sigma nonspecific receptor (e.g., escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline). Avoid concomitant 
use of these medicinal products with Xospata unless use is considered essential for the care of the 
patient.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential seven days prior to initiating 
Xospata treatment. Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use effective contraception 
(methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during and up to 6 months after treatment. It is 
unknown whether gilteritinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore 
women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method of contraception. Males of 
reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at 
least 4 months after the last dose of Xospata (see section 4.4).  
Pregnancy  
Gilteritinib can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There are no or limited 
amount of data from the use of gilteritinib in pregnant women. Reproductive studies in rats have 
shown that gilteritinib caused suppressed foetal growth, embryo-foetal deaths and teratogenicity (see 
section 5.3). Xospata is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not using effective contraception.  
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether gilteritinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available animal data 
have shown excretion of gilteritinib and its metabolites in the animal milk of lactating rats and 
distribution to the tissues in infant rats via the milk (see section 5.3).  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
A risk to breast-fed children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during 
treatment with Xospata and for at least two months after the last dose. 
Fertility  
There are no data on the effect of gilterinitib on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Gilteritinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness has been reported 
in patients taking Xospata and should be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or use 
machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Xospata was evaluated in 319 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who have 
received at least one dose of 120 mg gilteritinib.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Differentiation syndrome 
Of 319 patients treated with Xospata in the clinical studies, 11 (3%) experienced differentiation 
syndrome. Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of 
myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal if not treated. Symptoms and clinical findings of 
differentiation syndrome in patients treated with Xospata included fever, dyspnoea, pleural effusion, 
pericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, hypotension, rapid weight gain, peripheral oedema, rash, and 
renal dysfunction. Some cases had concomitant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Differentiation 
syndrome occurred as early as one day and up to 82 days after Xospata initiation and has been 
observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. Of the 11 patients who experienced differentiation 
syndrome, 9 (82%) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of Xospata. For 
recommendations in case of suspected differentiation syndrome see sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
PRES 
Of the 319 patients treated with Xospata in the clinical studies, 0.6% experienced posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder, which can present 
with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, confusion, visual and neurological 
disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. Symptoms have resolved after discontinuation 
of treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
QT prolongation 
Of the 317 patients treated with gilteritinib at 120 mg with a post-baseline QTC value in clinical 
studies, 4 patients (1%) experienced a QTcF >500 msec. Additionally, across all doses, 12 patients 
(2.3%) with relapsed/refractory AML had a maximum post-baseline QTcF interval >500 msec (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).  
8 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
There is no known specific antidote for Xospata. In the event of an overdose, treatment with Xospata 
should be stopped. Patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and 
appropriate symptomatic and supportive treatment initiated, taking into consideration the long half-life 
estimated at 113 hours. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX13   
Mechanism of action 
Gilteritinib fumarate is a FLT3 and AXL inhibitor.  
Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 receptor signalling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3 
including FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y, and FLT3-ITD-D835Y, and it induces apoptosis in leukemic cells 
expressing FLT3-ITD. 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
In patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving gilteritinib 120 mg, substantial (> 90%) 
inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was rapid (within 24 hours after first dose) and sustained, as 
characterised by an ex vivo plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay.  
Prolonged QT interval  
A concentration-related increase in change from baseline of QTcF was observed across gilteritinib 
doses ranging from 20 to 450 mg. The predicted mean change from baseline of QTcF at the mean 
steady-state Cmax (282.0 ng/mL) at the 120 mg daily dose was 4.96 msec with an upper 1-sided 95% CI 
= 6.20 msec.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
Relapsed or refractory AML 
Efficacy and safety were evaluated in the active-controlled, phase 3 study (2215-CL-0301). 
ADMIRAL study (2215-CL-0301) 
The ADMIRAL study is a Phase 3, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical study of adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory AML with a FLT3 mutation as determined by the LeukoStrat® CDx FLT3 
Mutation Assay. In this study, 371 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib or one 
of the following salvage chemotherapies (247 in the gilteritinib arm and 124 in the salvage 
chemotherapy arm): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
cytarabine 20 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection (SC) or intravenous infusion (IV) for 
10 days (days 1 through 10) (LoDAC) 
azacitidine 75 mg/m2 once daily by SC or IV for 7 days (days 1 through 7)  
mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2, etoposide 100 mg/m2 and cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 once daily by IV for 
5 days (days 1 through 5) (MEC) 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 300 mcg/m2 once daily by SC for 5 days (days 1 to 5), 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2 once daily by IV for 5 days (days 2 through 6), cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 
once daily by IV for 5 days (days 2 through 6), idarubicin 10 mg/m2 once daily by IV for 3 days 
(days 2 through 4) (FLAG-Ida). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients included were relapsed or refractory after first line AML therapy and were stratified by 
response to prior AML treatment and preselected chemotherapy i.e. high or low intensity. While the 
study included patients with various AML-related cytogenetic abnormalities, patients with acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) or therapy-related AML were excluded. 
Sixteen patients were randomised but not treated in the study (1 patient in the gilteritinib arm and 
15 patients in the chemotherapy arm). Gilteritinib was given orally at a starting dose of 120 mg daily 
until unacceptable toxicity or lack of clinical benefit. Dose reductions were allowed, to manage 
adverse reactions, and dose increases were allowed, for those patients who did not respond at the 
starting dose of 120 mg. 
Of the patients who were pre-selected to receive salvage chemotherapy, 60.5% were randomised to 
high intensity and 39.5% to low intensity. MEC and FLAG-Ida were given for up to two cycles 
depending on response to first cycle. LoDAC and azacitidine were given in continuous 4-week cycles 
until unacceptable toxicity or lack of clinical benefit. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms. 
The median age at randomisation was 62 years (range 20 to 84 years) in the gilteritinib arm and 
62 years (range 19 to 85 years) in the salvage chemotherapy arm. In the study 42% of patients were 
65 years or older and 12% were 75 years or older. Fifty-four percent of the patients were female. Most 
patients in the study were Caucasian (59.3%); 27.5% Asian, 5.7% Black, 4% other races and 3.5% 
unknown. The majority of patients (83.8%) had an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. Patients 
had the following confirmed mutations: FLT3-ITD alone (88.4%), FLT3-TKD alone (8.4%) or both 
FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD (1.9%). Twelve percent of patients received previous treatment with 
another FLT3 inhibitor. A majority of patients had AML with intermediate risk cytogenetics (73%), 
10% had unfavourable, 1.3% had favourable and 15.6% had unclassified cytogenetics.  
Prior to treatment with gilteritinib, 39.4% of patients had primary refractory AML and the majority of 
these patients were classified as refractory after 1 cycle of chemotherapy induction treatment, 19.7% 
had relapsed AML after an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and 41% had 
relapsed AML with no allogeneic HSCT.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the final analysis was OS in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 
measured from the date of randomisation until death by any cause (number of events analysed was 
261). Patients randomised to the gilteritinib arm had significantly longer survival compared to the 
chemotherapy arm (HR 0.637; 95% CI 0.490 – 0.830; 1 sided p-value: 0.0004). The median OS was 
9.3 months for patients receiving gilteritinib and 5.6 months for those receiving chemotherapy. 
Efficacy was further supported by the rate of complete remission (CR)/complete remission with partial 
haematologic recovery (CRh) (Table 3, Figure 1).

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival in ADMIRAL study
For patients who achieved a CR/CRh, the median time to first response was 3.7 months (range, 0.9 to 
10.6 months) in the gilteritinib arm and 1.2 months (range: 1 to 2.6 months) in the salvage 
chemotherapy arm. The median time to best response of CR/CRh was 3.8 months (range, 0.9 to 16 
months) in the gilteritinib arm and 1.2 months (range: 1 to 2.6 months) in the salvage chemotherapy 
arm. 
CHRYSALIS study (2215-CL-0101) 
The supportive Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study 2215-CL-0101 included 157 patients with FLT3 
mutated AML treated with either 1 or >1 prior lines of treatment in the combined dose group (i.e. 
80 mg, 120 mg or 200 mg); 31.2% received 1 prior line of treatment and 68.8% received >1 prior lines 
of treatment.  
The response rate (CR/CRh) observed in Study 2215-CL-0101 in the patients who received more than 
1 line of prior therapy was 21.4% and 15.7% for the 120 mg dose and the combined dose levels, 
respectively. The median OS was 7.2 months and 7.1 months for the 120 mg dose and the combined 
dose levels, respectively. 
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xospata in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute myeloid 
leukaemia. See 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption  
Following oral administration of gilteritinib, peak plasma concentrations are observed at a median tmax 
approximately between 4 and 6 hours in healthy volunteers and patients with relapsed or 
refractory AML. Gilteritinib undergoes first-order absorption with an estimated absorption rate (ka) of 
0.43 h-1 with a lag time of 0.34 hours based on population PK modelling. Median steady-state 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
maximum concentration (Cmax) is 282.0 ng/mL (CV% = 50.8), and area under the plasma 
concentration curve during 24-hour dosing interval (AUC0-24) is 6180 ng·h/mL (CV% = 46.4) after 
once-daily dosing of 120 mg gilteritinib. Steady-state plasma levels are reached within 15 days of 
once-daily dosing with an approximate 10-fold accumulation. 
Effect of food 
In healthy adults, gilteritinib Cmax and AUC decreased by approximately 26% and less than 10%, 
respectively, when a single 40 mg dose of gilteritinib was co-administered with a high fat meal 
compared to gilteritinib exposure in fasted state. Median tmax was delayed 2 hours when gilteritinib 
was administered with a high-fat meal. 
Distribution  
The population estimate of central and peripheral volume of distribution were 1092 L and 1100 L, 
respectively. These data indicate gilteritinib distributes extensively outside of plasma, which may 
indicate extensive tissue distribution. In vivo plasma protein binding in humans is approximately 90% 
and gilteritinib is primarily bound to albumin.  
Biotransformation  
Based on in vitro data, gilteritinib is primarily metabolised via CYP3A4. The primary metabolites in 
humans include M17 (formed via N-dealkylation and oxidation), M16 and M10 (both formed via 
N-dealkylation) and were observed in animals. None of these three metabolites exceeded 10% of 
overall parent exposure. The pharmacological activity of the metabolites against FLT3 and AXL 
receptors is unknown.  
Transporter drug-drug interactions 
In vitro experiments demonstrated that gilteritinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Gilteritinib may 
potentially inhibit BCRP, P-gp and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). 
Elimination  
After a single dose of [14C] -gilteritinib, gilteritinib is primarily excreted in faeces with 64.5% of the 
total administered dose recovered in faeces. Approximately 16.4% of the total dose was excreted in 
urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Gilteritinib plasma concentrations declined in a 
bi-exponential manner with a population mean estimated half-life of 113 hours. The estimated 
apparent clearance (CL/F) based on the population PK model is 14.85 L/h. 
Linearity/non-linearity  
In general, gilteritinib exhibited linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics after single and multiple 
dose administration at doses ranging from 20 to 450 mg in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.  
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic 
covariates on the predicted exposure of gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. 
Covariate analysis indicated that age (20 years to 90 years), and body weight (36 kg to 157 kg) were 
statistically significant; however predicted change in gilteritinib exposure was less than 2-fold. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on gilteritinib pharmacokinetics was studied in subjects with mild 
(Child-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Results indicate 
unbound gilteritinib exposure in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment is comparable to 
that observed in subjects with normal hepatic function. The effect of mild hepatic impairment [as 
defined by NCI-ODWG] on gilteritinib exposure was also assessed using the population PK model and 
the results demonstrate little difference in predicted steady-state gilteritinib exposure relative to a 
typical patient with relapsed or refractory AML and normal liver function. 
Gilteritinib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib were evaluated in five subjects with severe (CrCL 15 - <30 
mL/min) renal impairment and in four subjects with end stage renal disease (CrCL <15 mL/min). A 
1.4-fold increase in mean Cmax and 1.5-fold increase in mean AUCinf of gilteritinib was observed in 
subjects with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease compared to subjects with normal 
renal function (n=8) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals (safety pharmacology/repeat 
dose toxicity) at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to 
clinical use were as follows: 
Safety pharmacology 
In rats, decreased urination at 30 mg/kg and higher and decreased defecation at 100 mg/kg were 
observed. In dogs, positive faecal occult blood at 10 mg/kg and higher, a decrease in the blood calcium 
concentration at 30 mg/kg, and salivation and an increase followed by a decrease in the blood calcium 
concentration at 100 mg/kg were observed. These changes were observed at plasma exposure levels 
similar to or less than clinical exposure levels. A possible clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, target organs of toxicity were the gastrointestinal 
tract (heamorrhage in dogs), lymphohaematopoietic system (lymphocyte necrosis and bone marrow 
hypocellularity with changes in haematological parameters), eye (inflammation and lens opacity in 
rats, fundus colour change in dogs, retinal vacuolation), lung (interstitial pneumonia in rats and 
inflammation in dogs), kidney (renal tubule changes with a positive urine occult blood reaction) and 
liver (hepatocyte vacuolation), urinary bladder (epithelial vacuolation), epithelial tissue (ulcer and 
inflammation), and phospholipidosis (lung and kidney in rats). These changes were observed at plasma 
exposure levels similar to or less than clinical exposure levels. Reversibility of most of the changes 
was indicated by the end of the 4-week recovery period. A possible clinical relevance of these findings 
is unknown. 
Genotoxicity 
Gilteritinib did not induce gene mutation or chromosomal aberrations in vitro. The in vivo 
micronucleus test showed that gilteritinib has a potential to induce micronuclei in mice. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Gilteritinib showed suppressed foetal growth, and induced embryo-foetal deaths and teratogenicity in 
the embryo-foetal development studies in rats at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels. 
Placental transfer of gilteritinib was shown in the rat resulting in transfer of radioactivity to the foetus 
similar to that observed in maternal plasma.  
Gilteritinib was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with milk concentrations being higher than in 
maternal plasma. Gilteritinib was distributed through the breast milk to different tissues, except for the 
brain, of suckling rats. 
Juvenile animal toxicity study 
In the juvenile toxicity study in rats, the minimum lethal dose level (2.5 mg/kg/day) was much lower 
than that of adult rats (20 mg/kg/day). The gastrointestinal tract was identified as one of the target 
organs similar as in adult rats.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xospata is and what it is used for 
What Xospata is 
Xospata belongs to a class of cancer medicines called protein kinase inihibitors. It contains the active 
substance gilteritinib.  
What Xospata is used for 
Xospata is used to treat adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a cancer of certain white blood 
cells. Xospata is used if AML is linked to an alteration of a gene called FLT3, and is given to patients 
whose disease has come back or has not improved after previous treatment.  
How Xospata works  
In AML, patients develop large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. Gilteritinib blocks the action 
of certain enzymes (kinases) needed for the abnormal cells to multiply and grow, thus preventing the 
growth of the cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Xospata 
Do not take Xospata 
- 
if you are allergic to gilteritinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to you doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away: 
- 
if you have any of the following symptoms: fever, trouble breathing, rash, dizziness or 
lightheadedness, rapid weight gain, swelling of your arms or legs. These may be signs of a 
condition called differentiation syndrome (see section 4 – Possible side effects). Differentiation 
syndrome can happen any time during the first 3 months of Xospata treatment from as early as 1 
day after starting treatment. If it occurs, your doctor will monitor you and may give you a 
25 
 
 
medicine to treat your condition. She or he may also pause Xospata treatment until symptoms 
are reduced. You will also find this information in the Patient Alert Card that is included in the 
packaging. It is important that you keep this Alert Card with you and show it to any healthcare 
professional you see.  
if you have a seizure or quickly worsening symptoms such as headache, decreased alertness, 
confusion, blurred vision or other problems with seeing. These may be signs of a condition 
called PRES (see section 4. – Possible side effects). Your doctor may do a test to check if you 
have developed PRES and will stop Xospata treatment if it is confirmed that you have PRES. 
- 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xospata: 
- 
if you have a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat or a condition called QT 
prolongation (see section 4. – Possible side effects). 
if you have a history of low levels of the salts potassium or magnesium in your blood, as this 
may increase the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm. 
if you have severe pain in the upper abdomen and back, nausea and vomiting. These may be 
signs of an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). 
- 
- 
Additional monitoring during treatment with Xospata 
Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests before and during treatment with Xospata. Your doctor 
will also regularly check your heart function before and during treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Xospata to children and adolescents under 18 years because it is not known whether it is 
safe and effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Xospata 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Xospata may affect the way these medicines work, or these medicines may affect how 
Xospata works. 
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin;  
medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as phenytoin;  
medicines used to treat fungal infections such as voriconazole, posaconazole or itraconazole; 
medicines used to treat bacterial infections such as erythromycin, clarithromycin or 
azithromycin; 
medicines used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) such as captopril or carvedilol; 
medicines used to treat infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as 
ritonavir; 
medicines used to treat depression such as escitalopram, fluoxetine or sertraline; 
medicines used to treat heart problems, such as digoxin; 
medicines used to prevent blood clots, such as dabigatran etexilate; 
St. John’s wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat 
depression. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If you normally take any of these medicines, your doctor might change it and prescribe a different 
medicine for you during your treatment with Xospata. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Xospata may harm your unborn baby and should not be used during pregnancy. Women taking 
Xospata who are able to become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception during 
treatment with Xospata and for at least 6 months after stopping Xospata. If you use a hormonal 
contraceptive, you must also use a barrier method, such as a condom or a diaphragm. Men taking 
Xospata whose partners are able to become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception 
during treatment with Xospata and for at least 4 months after stopping the treatment. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is not known if Xospata passes into your breast milk and could harm your baby. You should not 
breast-feed during treatment with Xospata and for at least 2 months after stopping the treatment. 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
You may feel dizzy after taking Xospata. If this happens, do not drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to take Xospata

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Fycompa 
perampanel 
On 24 May 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Fycompa,  
2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg, film-coated tablet intended for the adjunctive treatment of 
partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 
12 years and older. The applicant for this medicinal product is Eisai Europe Ltd. They may request a 
re-examination of any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of 
their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substance of Fycompa is perampanel, a non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic α-
amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on post-synaptic 
neurons (N03AX22). The precise mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effects in 
humans remains to be fully elucidated. 
The benefits with Fycompa are its ability to reduce the frequency of seizures at doses of 4 mg/day,  
8 mg/day and 12 mg/day as shown in three placebo controlled studies conducted in epilepsy subjects 
aged 12 years and older diagnosed with partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalised 
seizures. The most common side effects are dizziness and somnolence. 
A pharmacovigilance plan for Fycompa will be implemented as part of the marketing authorisation.  
The approved indication is: "Fycompa is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures 
with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older".  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 
67 days from adoption of the opinion.

The CHMP, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, considers there to be a 
favourable benefit-to-risk balance for Fycompa and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation.

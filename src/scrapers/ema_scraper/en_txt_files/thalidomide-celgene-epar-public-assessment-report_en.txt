SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1. 
Introduction 
Multiple  myeloma  (MM)  is  a  hematologic  cancer  in  which  immature  malignant  plasma  cells 
(myeloma cells) accumulate in and eventually destroy the bone marrow. The pathological effect of this 
accumulation  is  an  increasingly  dysfunctional  bone  marrow,  causing  cytopenias  which  lead  to 
bacterial  infections,  anemia,  and  osteolytic  lesions  [1-3].  In  MM,  myeloma  cells  are  monoclonal, 
(M-protein).  Normal 
producing  only  one 
immunoglobulin  production  is  compromised  in  myeloma  patients,  affecting  the  normal  immune 
response,  which  predisposes  patients 
the 
immunoglobulin accumulates in the kidney, causing renal impairment or failure. The disease accounts 
for  10%  of  all  haematologic  malignancies  and  1%  of  all  cancers.  Median  survival  is  about  3  years, 
with infections and renal failure being the most serious, major life-threatening complications [4, 5]. 
immunoglobulin  monoclonal  protein 
infections  [3].  The 
light  chain  of 
to  recurrent 
type  of 
Several national and international guidelines on the management of MM are available in the European 
Union [6-8], [9, 10]. They recommend that newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic disease should 
be treated immediately and that treatment should be primarily based on age and performance status. 
The  combination  of  melphalan  with  prednisone  (MP)  was  first  acknowledged  to  be  superior  to 
melphalan treatment alone in MM by Alexanian et al nearly 40 years ago [11] and currently remains 
standard therapy in Europe for patients aged ≥ 65 years, who are not candidates for high-dose therapy 
prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) [6-8, 12] [9, 10]. Response rates in this 
elderly  population  have  been  consistently  in  the  range  of  50%  to  60%,  with  an  overall 
survival  (OS)  time  of  approximately  36  months.  Newly  diagnosed  patients  who  are  eligible  for 
HDT/ASCT  (aged  < 65  years)  are  first  treated  with  an  induction  regimen  that  can  produce  a  rapid 
reduction  in  tumor  burden  without  jeopardizing  stem  cell  mobilization  and  collection  [7,  8,  10,  13]. 
There  is  no  standard  regimen  for  induction  of  remission  in  Europe.  However,  VAD  (vincristine, 
doxorubicin,  dexamethasone)  or  VAD-like  induction  regimens  have  been  widely  used  and  are 
recommend  in  several  country  guidelines  [6-8]  [9,  10,  13].  VAD  and  VAD-like  regimens  are 
associated  with  complete  response  (CR)  rates  ranging  from  10%  to  25%  [7].  The  responses  and 
remissions  observed  with  these  regimens,  however,  are  generally  of  short  duration.  When  used  as 
primary  therapy,  no  overall  survival  advantage  compared  with  MP  has  been  shown  [9,  10].  Studies 
have  demonstrated  highly  similar  antimyeloma  efficacy  for  VAD  and  dexamethasone  in  newly 
diagnosed  patients  as  primary  therapy  and  induction  therapy  [14,  15].  However,  current  guidance 
documents do not consider dexamethasone alone as a standard for induction [16]. A high-dose, single-
agent  pulsed  regimen  of  this  agent  is  recommended  in  Europe  as  monotherapy  for  induction  of 
remission  in  newly  diagnosed  patients  proceeding  to  transplant  and  in  need  of  a  rapid  response 
because of severe pancytopenia, impaired renal function, or spinal cord compression [7-9]. 
Despite  progress  in  its  current  treatment  and  management,  MM  remains  incurable.  Although 
HDT/ASCT has extended survival in newly diagnosed myeloma [17], all patients eventually relapse 
and  a  plateau  is  never  observed  on  EFS  curves  [17,  18].  Newer  agents  such  as  thalidomide, 
lenalidomide  and  bortezomib  are  being  combined  with  standard  MM  therapies  for  newly  diagnosed 
patients in an attempt to enhance responses and improve outcomes. Lenalidomide and bortezomib are 
authorized for treatment in the relapsed setting [19]. The use of thalidomide in combination with MP 
has recently become a recommended standard therapy based on the data provided in this submission 
[20, 21].  
1.2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Thalidomide  Pharmion  is  presented  as  opaque,  white,  hard  gelatin  capsules  containing  50 mg  of 
thalidomide (active substance). The excipients used in the preparation of Thalidomide Pharmion are 
well known excipients used in hard capsules preparations such as anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline 
cellulose,  crospovidone,  povidone,  stearic  acid,  colloidal  anhydrous  silica  (capsule  content),  gelatin 
4/61 
 
 
 
and  titanium  dioxide  (capsule  shells)  shellac,  black  iron  oxide  and  propylene  glycol  (black  printing 
ink).  
Thalidomide  Pharmion  50 mg  hard  capsules  are  marked  in  black  ink  with  “Thalidomide  50 mg 
Pharmion”. The capsules are packaged in PVC/PE/Aclar/aluminium blisters and the blisters are sealed 
in a paperboard wallet card. 
Active Substance 
The  active  substance  is  chemically  designated  as  2-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidyl)isoindole-1,3-dione 
(IUPAC)  or  1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione,  2-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidinyl)-  (CAS)  and  has  the  following 
structure: 
O
N
O
O
O
N
H
It is a white to off-white powder, which melts in the range 267 – 273 °C. The octanol/water partition 
coefficient  at  room  temperature  is  5.  Thalidomide  is  classified  as  “very  slightly  soluble”  in  water 
(1000 to 10 000 ml per gram).  
Thalidomide  may  exist  in  two  polymorphic  forms  α  and  β  however  the  commercially  utilised 
manufacturing process leads only to the α form.  
Thalidomide contains single asymmetric carbon atom alpha to the phthalimido nitrogen. The molecule 
can, therefore, exist in a two complimentary optically active forms. The drug substance developed is a 
racemic  mixture  that  contains  an  equal  amount  of  the  S(-)  and  R(+)  forms,  and  therefore  has  a  net 
optical rotation of zero. The use of a racemic mixture is justified by the fact that each of the optically 
active forms undergoes rapid racemisation in vivo under normal conditions. 
•  Manufacture 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  four-step  synthesis  process  comprising  two  chemical  reaction  steps 
which  are  followed  by  purification  and  milling.  During  the  synthesis  one  intermediate  product  is 
isolated.  The  proposed  manufacturing  process  has  been  well  described,  critical  steps  and 
accompanying  in-process  controls  have  been  identified.  Appropriate  specifications  for  the  starting 
materials, intermediate and reagents have been established.  
There  have  been  no  significant  changes  to  the  drug  substance  manufacturing  process  during  the 
development  of  drug  substance.  Manufacturing  process  development  investigations  have  been 
performed at small scale to identify the reaction parameters which could impact the yield and purity of 
the  intermediate  and  the  drug  substance.  Obtained  results  have  led  to  the  selected  drug  substance 
manufacturing conditions.  
Key  physicochemical  properties  of  the  drug  substance  that  can  influence  the  drug  product  and  its 
manufacture,  including  solubility,  dissociation  constants,  choice  of  racemate,  polymorphism  and 
particle size have been discussed and justified.   
The chemical structure of the drug substance has been confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, 1H and 13C 
NMR  spectroscopy,  UV  spectroscopy,  melting  point  and  elemental  analysis.  The  elemental  analysis 
data of C, H, N and O of the thalidomide study batch correspond with the theoretical values and with 
the results obtained on the reference substance. The IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and UV spectra of the in-
house substance and the reference substance are also consistent with each other and with the known 
structure of thalidomide.  
The  assessment  of  possible  polymorphism  has  been  performed  using  X-ray  powder  diffraction.  The 
proposed  manufacturing  process  allows  to  control  the  final  polymorphic  form  through  solvent 
selection  and  re-crystallization  conditions  to  consistently  produce  the  α-form.  In  addition  it  has  also 
been shown in a bioequivalence study, in which the α and β polymorphs were administrated to healthy 
subjects, that the two polymorphs are bioequivalent with respect to Cmax, AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-inf).

•  Specification 
The drug substance specification is in line with the USP monograph for thalidomide with additional 
tests for residual solvents and particle size. The proposed specification includes tests for appearance, 
identification (FT-IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (TLC and HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
heavy metals, water content (Karl Fisher), particle size (Laser light scattering) and bioburden. 
The  drug  substance  is  tested  against  the  USP  monograph  for  thalidomide  (as  the  Thalidomide 
Monograph is not included in the Ph. Eur.).  
For the particle size method, instrument performance is verified with glass microspheres on a routine 
basis. 
The  GC  method  has  been  validated  for  selectivity,  linearity,  limit  of  quantitation  (LOQ),  limit  of 
detection (LOD), system precision, range and accuracy. The robustness of the method has also been 
checked and confirmed. 
In general, analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for all batches of the drug substance used in the non-clinical 
and  clinical  studies  as  well  as  for  three  commercial  scale  batches  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
manufacturing site. All batches complied with the requirements from the drug substance specification. 
•  Stability 
Stability studies have been performed on seven commercial scale batches of the drug substance. Data 
was provided for batches stored up to 36 months at 25 °C/60 % RH (long term stability studies) and 
6 months  at  40 °C/75 % RH  (accelerated  conditions).  Additionally,  data  from  photostability  study 
(conditions  according  to  ICH  Q1B,  Option  2)  and  from  the  stressed  degradation  studies  (thermal 
degradation, oxidative, acidic and alkaline degradation).  
The  data  provided  show  that  thalidomide  is  very  stable  in  the  solid  state  and  that  it  is  prone  to 
hydrolysis in aqueous solution, especially in an alkaline pH.  
The stability data provided for the drug substance confirmed the proposed re-test period. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
In  early  clinical  development  a  simpler  clinical  formulation  (consisting  of  a  bulking  agent  and 
lubricant)  than  the  commercial  formulation  was  used.  During  commercial  scale  development, 
conventional components were used to facilitate the scale-up during manufacture.  
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  is  the  same  process  utilized  to  prepare  drug  product 
throughout  clinical  development.  The manufacturing  process  has  consistently utilized  the  same  drug 
substance from the same supplier and the same compendial excipients through development. All drug 
product manufacturing operations have been performed at the same site utilizing equipment with the 
same operating principles at the same process scale throughout development. 
The  proposed  in  vitro  dissolution  method  is  the  one  described  in  USP  monograph  for  Thalidomide 
Capsules. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
Among  excipients  used  in  the  drug  product  only  lactose  (ingredient  of  the  formulation)  and  gelatin 
(component  of  the  capsule  shell)  are  of  animal  origin.  Declarations  from  the  lactose  suppliers  were 
provided, stating that the lactose was sourced from healthy animals under the same conditions as milk 
collected for human consumption.  
For  gelatin  used  for  manufacture  of  capsule  shells  a  PhEur  TSE  Certificates  of  Suitability  were 
provided.  
Stearic acid used in the formulation is of vegetable origin.  
6/61 
 
 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The commercial manufacturing process of the drug product, which utilizes conventional solid dosage 
form  manufacturing  procedures  and  equipment,  can  be  summarized  as  dry  ingredient  blending 
followed  by  roller  compaction  and  encapsulation.  Blending  ensures  homogeneity  of  the  thalidomide 
and  excipients,  while  roller  compaction  is  employed  to  ensure  consistent  flow  characteristics  of  the 
granulated powder blend during encapsulation. 
The  critical  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  identified  and  adequately  studied. 
Appropriate in-process controls of the critical steps have been established.  
The manufacturing process has not changed throughout the development. More than 50 batches of the 
drug product have been manufactured at the proposed scale using the same process. Process validation 
was  carried  out  on  three  batches  of  commercial  scale  and  showed  that  the  capsules  can  be 
manufactured reproducibly according to the finished product specifications. 
•  Product Specification 
The USP monograph for thalidomide capsules was used as a guideline for setting specifications for the 
drug  product.  The  proposed  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance,  identity  (HPLC  and  TLC), 
assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution and bioburden. 
All  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  validated.  The  HPLC  method  for  an  assay  was  validated  with 
regards  to  specificity,  linearity,  accuracy,  precision  and  robustness.  The  method  for  the  related 
substances  was  validated  for  specificity,  linearity,  accuracy,  precision,  limit  of  detection,  limit  of 
quantification and robustness. The test conditions for the dissolution method are taken from the USP 
monograph  for  thalidomide  capsules.  The  method  was  validated  for  specificity,  linearity,  accuracy, 
precision, solution stability and effect of filtration of the sample. 
Batch  analysis  data  on  three  commercial  scale  and  one  of  pilot  scale  batches  of  the  drug  product 
confirmed consistency of the manufacturing process. All results comply with specifications. 
The  packaging  for  Thalidomide  Pharmion  is  presented  as  wallet  design  where  the  blister  strips  are 
sealed  into  a  wallet  card.  The  blister  strips  are  integral  to  the  package  and  are  not  intended  to  be 
separated from the package. The applicant has committed to perform further development work on the 
product package. 
•  Stability of the Product 
Complete  long  term  (25 °C/60 % RH)  and  accelerated  (40 °C/75 % RH)  stability  data  have  been 
provided for ten batches of the drug product, nine of which were of commercial scale. In addition five 
commercial scale batches have been placed on long term stability studies and for these batches up to 
12 - 36  months  results  were  reported. All  results  remain  within  the  specifications  and prove  that  the 
drug product is stable. A photostability study has showed that the drug product is not light sensitive. 
The  applicant  has  committed  to  place  at  least  one  commercial  batch  of  drug  product  in  the stability 
program each year, according to the approved stability protocol. 
In  summary  the  stability  data  provided  support  the  proposed  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as 
defined in SPC. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The drug substance and the drug product have been appropriately described and generally satisfactory 
documentation  has  been  provided.  The  excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  drug  product  and 
manufacturing process selected are standard for capsules preparation. The results indicate that the drug 
substance and the drug product can be reproducibly manufactured. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was minor unresolved quality issue which have no impact on 
the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and  committed  to 
resolve it as a Follow-up Measure after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame.

1.3. 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The  pivotal  non-clinical  studies  were  conducted  according  to  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP) 
standards,  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  Studies  from  the  published  literature  were  not  conducted 
according to GLP. Study data obtained from the Office of Freedom of Information were derived from 
studies which were not conducted according to GLP. 
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
No studies on primary pharmacology have been performed by the applicant. Reference was made to 
published data. The primary pharmacological actions of thalidomide described in the literature include 
anti-angiogenic  and  immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory  activity.  The  mechanisms  involved  in 
these  activities  of  thalidomide  have  not  been  fully  delineated.  However,  it  is  likely  that  common 
mechanisms  may  be  involved  in  both  the  anti-angiogenic  and  immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory 
effects. 
Proposed mechanisms for the anti-angiogenic activity of thalidomide include (1) a down-regulation of 
TNF-α  levels;  (2)  down-regulation  of  Vascular  Endothelial  Growth  Factor  (VEGF)  expression;  (3) 
inhibition of the response to basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) and VEGF potentially through the 
modulation  of  integrin  expression  and  impairment  of  migration;  (4)  inhibition  of  endothelial  cell 
proliferation;  and  (5)  blocking  of  cyclooxigenase-2  (COX-2)  induction.  Thalidomide  has  also  been 
shown to be efficacious in several animal models of immune-mediated and pain induced inflammatory 
disorders  and  TNF-α-induced  conditions,  and  to  induce  apoptosis  in  human  peripheral  blood 
monocytes. More recent studies have implicated the inhibition of Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) activity 
in the extensive series of biological activities associated with thalidomide. 
In multiple myeloma (MM), thalidomide has been shown to induce apoptosis or growth arrest in the 
G1  phase  of  the  cell  cycle  in  several  MM  cell  lines  and  in  patient  derived  MM  cells  resistant  to 
melphalan,  doxorubicin  and  dexamethasone.  Thalidomide  was  also  shown  to  enhance  the  anti-MM 
activity of dexamethasone in MM cell lines. In animal models of MM thalidomide has demonstrated 
some evidence of anti-angiogenic activity, as well as directly inhibiting myeloma growth. 
The  efficacy  of  thalidomide  in  combination  with  a  number  of  chemotherapeutics  has  been 
demonstrated  in  a  variety  of  animal  models  of  human  cancers.  These  include  combinations  with 
dimethylxantheone  and  paclitaxel  in  colorectal  adenocarcinomas;  decarbazine  in  melanoma; 
recombinant  diabody  in  B-cell  lymphoma;  paclitaxel  in  hepatocellular  carcinoma;  carmustine, 
cisplatin, BCNU and temozolomide in glioma; and cyclophosphamide in prostate cancer. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The  main  secondary  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  thalidomide  (investigated  in  mouse,  rats  and  cats 
intravenously and per os, up to 1000 mg/kg) concerns its CNS activity. As thalidomide was initially 
approved as a sedative in Europe, the CNS properties of this product are well known (see also non-
clinical safety pharmacology section). 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular effects 
The effect of thalidomide on hERG tail current recorded from HEK293 cells stably transfected with 
hERG cDNA showed an inhibition of less than 25% at the limit of thalidomide solubility at 75 µg/ml. 
In dog isolated Purkinje fibres there was a reduction in action potential duration at ≥12.5 µg/ml, and at 
125 µg/ml there was a reduction in maximum rate of depolarization. In the company-sponsored 1-year 
oral  dosing  study  in  dogs,  thalidomide-related  electrocardiographic  alterations  were  not  observed  at 
doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day. 
8/61 
 
 
CNS effects 
Thalidomide was initially approved as a sedative in Europe. Thalidomide has been shown to increase 
slow wave sleep with little or no change to percent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and to decrease 
sleep onset latency in rats and cats. In addition, it has been shown to modulate a number of measures 
of  neurological  function  in  rats  and  mice  that  include  a  decrease  in  spontaneous  motor  activity,  an 
increase  in  protection  in  electroshock-induced  seizures,  and  potentiation  of  chlorpromazine-  and 
reserpine-induced  catalepsy  and  morphine  analgesia.  Data  suggest  that  the  activity  of  thalidomide 
may, in part, be related to a thalidomide-induced decrease in utilization/release of serotonin. 
In  the  company-sponsored  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  potential  CNS  depression  was  only  noted 
during  a  thorough  functional  observation  battery  evaluation  where  partially  or  completely  closed 
eyelids were observed in rats after 90 days treatment at an oral dose of 3000 mg/kg/day. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Thalidomide has been shown to enhance the sedative effect of barbiturates, ethanol, chlorpromazine, 
and reserpine.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Single  dose  pharmacokinetic  and  bioavailability  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  and  rats  (oral  and 
intravenous  routes).  The  metabolism  of  thalidomide  was  studied  in  vitro  with  human  microsomal 
preparations and in mouse plasma. Reference to data from the literature was also provided. 
A  high  performance  liquid  chromatographic  assay  was  validated  for  determination  of  thalidomide 
concentrations  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog  plasma.  High  performance  liquid  chromatography-mass 
spectrometry  (HPLC/MS/MS)  analysis  method  was  used  to  determine  the  level  of  thalidomide  in 
rabbit semen and to determine the level of thalidomide in rabbit milk and heparinized plasma samples. 
•  Absorption 
Male mice (6/group/timepoint) received thalidomide as a single intravenous dose (PEG-400 solution) 
of  10  mg/kg  or  a  single  oral  dose  (1%  CMC  suspension)  of  200,  1000,  or  2000  mg/kg.  Male  rats 
(3/group/timepoint) received thalidomide as a single intravenous dose (PEG-400 solution) of 5 mg/kg 
or a single oral dose (1% CMC suspension) of 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg (see table 1).

•  Distribution 
Plasma  protein  binding  data  for  thalidomide  are  not  available  in  animals.  Plasma  protein  binding  in 
humans  is  55%  and  66%  for  the  R(+)  and  S(-)enantiomers,  respectively.  In  the  rhesus  monkey, 
thalidomide was rapidly distributed into tissues. Ten minutes following intravenous administration of 
3H  -thalidomide  at  10 mg/kg,  the  highest  percentage  of  total  radioactivity  was  found  in  the  liver 
(18.9%, of which 46.5% was unchanged thalidomide). Total radioactivity in the plasma, muscle and 
brain ranged from 6.8% to 8.8%, primarily unchanged thalidomide (80.9% to 90.2%). 
9/61 
 
 
 
 
In pregnant mice autoradiography of sagittal sections from whole animals showed the presence of  a 
large  amount  of  thalidomide-derived  radiolabel  confined  to  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Slightly  higher 
concentrations were observed for the liver and kidney; otherwise, the distribution of thalidomide was 
uniform with placental and fetal tissues showing about the same concentration as maternal tissues. 
As part of the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproductive toxicity study in rabbits, including a 
postnatal reproductive evaluation (segment III), a subgroup of animals was administered thalidomide 
in the same manner as the main study animals. During study preweaning weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 blood 
samples from the auricular artery and milk samples were collected from the 5 female rabbits/subgroup 
at approximately 3 hours (approximately at Cmax) following treatment (see table 2).

•  Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism of thalidomide by microsomal preparations  
Thalidomide  (10µg/ml)  was  incubated  with  pooled  human  hepatic  microsomes  and  microsomes 
isolated from human B lymphoblastoid cell lines that had been transfected with specific isozymes of 
P450 (cloned microsomes). Cloned microsomes included CYP 1A2, CYP 2A6, CYP 2B6, CYP 2C9, 
CYP  2C19,  CYP  2D6,  CYP  2E1  and  CYP  3A4.  Microsomes  and  S9  preparations  from  aroclor-  or 
Phenobarbital-induced rat liver were also incubated with thalidomide. The incubations were extracted 
and analysed by HPLC for the potential hydroxylated thalidomide metabolites, N-hydroxythalidomide 
(N-OH-Thal), 3-hydroxythalidomide (3-OH-Thal) and 4-hydroxythalidomide (4-OH-Thal). 
Thalidomide was not oxidized to any of these metabolites by any of the cloned microsomes and was 
poorly  oxidized  by  pooled-human  microsomes  or  rat  hepatic  microsomes  or  S9.  Low  amounts  of 
HPLC  peaks  comigrating  with  4-OH-Thal,  3-OH-Thal  and  an  unknown  metabolite  with  a  lower 
retention  time  than  the  three  potential  hydroxylated  metabolites  were  observed.  Thalidomide  at  a 
concentration of 10µg/ml did not inhibit oxidation of known substrates of each of the P450 isozymes 
tested in either cloned microsomes or pooled human microsomes.  
Analysis of thalidomide and Metabolites in Mouse Plasma  
Three CD-1 mice were dosed orally with 3000 mg/kg thalidomide in 1% carboxymethylcellulose daily 
for three days and plasma samples were obtained 2, 4 and 6 hours postdose on the third day. Extracts 
of mouse plasma from thalidomide treated mice contained at least four components that absorbed at 
230nm, not observed in control plasma extracts. The first two components did not match any standards 
and may represent other metabolites, possibly hydrolysis products of thalidomide. The second pair of 
components closely matched standards for 4-hydroxythhalidomide and thalidomide respectively.  
In  rats,  rabbits,  dogs,  mice,  and  guinea  pigs  urine,  the  most  abundant  products  were  α-(o-
carboxybenzamido)glutarimide,  4-phthalimidoglutaramic  acid,  and  2-phthalimidoglutaramic  acid 
which are hydrolysis products. Additional human studies have shown that thalidomide does not affect 
its own metabolism, nor does it affect the metabolism of oral contraceptive hormones. Thus, clinically 
10/61 
 
 
 
 
 
important interactions between thalidomide and drugs that are metabolised by the CYP enzyme system 
are unlikely. 
•  Excretion 
No  studies  evaluating  the  excretion  of  thalidomide  have  been  performed  by  the  applicant.  Based  on 
data from the literature, following administration of radio labelled thalidomide in different species (rat, 
rabbit,  monkey),  radioactivity  is  mainly  excreted  in  urine.  At  least  90%  of  the  radioactive  urinary 
material  was  excreted  within  24 hours.  However,  with  the  largest  oral  doses,  urinary  excretion  was 
progressively delayed, because of the rate of absorption which is decreased.  
•  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetic drug interactions with thalidomide.

No acute toxicity study has been performed by the applicant. Data taken from the literature show that 
the acute toxicity of thalidomide has been investigated in mice, rats, guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys 
and indicate that acute toxicity of thalidomide is quite low. The R(+) and S(-) forms were more toxic 
than  the  (±) optical  form,  with  oral  LD50s  of  0.4  and  0.7 g/kg,  for  the  R(+)  and  S(-)  forms, 
respectively.  However,  the  relevance  of  this  finding  is  questionable  considering  the  rapid 
interconversion between the two forms that occurs in vivo. In humans, no mortality from overdoses or 
attempted  suicide  has  been  recorded  so  far,  even  at  doses  of  up  to  14,000  mg.  CNS  effects  such  as 
drowsiness  and  somnolence  may  be  expected  events  in  a  proportion  of  patients  receiving  this  drug 
based on the well-known sedative properties of thalidomide.

•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeat dose GLP toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and dogs (see table 4: above).  
Clinical observations in these studies were: 
•  Discoloured urine in mice (pink to red) (≥ 30 mg/kg/day) and dogs (green) (≥ 12 mg/kg/day); 
•  White material (unabsorbed thalidomide) in faeces of dogs (≥ 43 mg/kg/day);  
•  Enlarged  and/or  blue  discoloration  of  mammary  glands  (≥  43  mg/kg/day)  and  prolonged 
oestrus (1000 mg/kg/day) in female dogs; and 
•  Decreased body weight and food consumption in rats (≥ 30 mg/kg/day). 
Clinical pathology parameters in the repeat-dose studies revealed:  
•  Decreased  platelet  counts  in  the  two-week  mouse  (50  and  3000  mg/kg/day)  and  in  the  two-
week (≥ 200 mg/kg/day) and 13-week (≥ 30 mg/kg/day) rat studies; 
•  Decreased protein, and albumin in the two-week rat study (3000 mg/kg/day); and 
•  Decreased glucose values (≥ 12 mg/kg/day) in one-month dog study. 
Pathology findings in the repeat-dose studies were:  
• 
Increased liver weights with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy in the two-week (≥ 200 
mg/kg/day) and 13-week (≥ 300 mg/kg/day) mouse studies; 
•  Decreased thymic weight with no corollary microscopic changes in the 13-week rat study (300 
and 3000 mg/kg/day); and 
•  Discoloured  (yellow/green)  bones  (≥43  mg/kg/day)  with  no  corollary  microscopic  changes, 
mammary gland dilatation (ducts) and glandular epithelium hyperplasia (females only) (≥ 43 
mg/kg/day), and  bile  plugs  in  canaliculi  (males  only)  (1000  mg/kg/day)  in  the  one-year  dog 
study. 
• 
Toxicokinetics 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs did not show any important safety concerns. One of the 
most  important  clinical  safety  concerns,  peripheral  neuropathy,  has  not  been  observed  in  the  non-
clinical  toxicity  studies.  It  appears  that  the  animal  models  (see  table  5)  are  poorly  predictive  for 
thalidomide toxicity in humans.

In  the  Ames/Salmonella-E.  coli  reverse  mutation  assay  Thalidomide  did  not  alter  the  background 
bacterial lawn to Salmonella and E. coli bacterial strains over the range of concentrations tested (50 – 
10,000 µg/plate). At ≥5000 mg/plate, thalidomide precipitated from solution; however, it was not toxic 
to the tester strains even under these conditions. Thus, the precipitation did not adversely impact the 
interpretation or results of this assay. Revertant frequencies for all concentrations of thalidomide in all 
tester  strains  with  metabolic  activation,  and  in  all  Salmonella  strains  without  metabolic  activation, 
under plate incorporation conditions, approximated or were less than those observed in the concurrent 
negative controls. Statistically significant increases in revertant frequencies were observed using the E. 
coli strain without metabolic activation under plate incorporation conditions.  
Thalidomide was re-evaluated under identical conditions in strain WP2 uvrA without S9 using plate 
incorporation  conditions,  and  in  strain  TA1537  with  S9  using  liquid  pre-incubation  conditions  to 
13/61 
 
 
 
verify the observed slight increases in revertant frequency. Under these repeated conditions, increases 
above control levels were not observed. Thus, the slight increases observed in the original assays are 
considered  to  be  statistical  aberrations  due  to  random  fluctuation  of  the  spontaneous  revertant 
frequencies.  
Thalidomide  was  evaluated  in  a  AS52/XPRT  Mammalian  Cell  Forward  Gene  Mutation  Assay  to 
determine its ability to induce mutations at the xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (XPRT) 
locus  in  cultured  AS52  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells.  In  duplicate  cultures  in  an  initial  and  a 
confirmatory assay, with S9 and without S9, there were no statistically significant or dose-dependent 
increases  in  the  average  mutation  frequencies  of  the  cultures  treated  with  thalidomide.  In  an 
independent  confirmatory  assay  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  average  mutant  frequency  was 
observed at a concentration of 5.00 µg/ml without S9. However, this increase was not linear, and it did 
not  represent  a  two-fold  net  increase  relative  to  the  pooled  concurrent  negative  controls.  Thus,  this 
isolated increase did not even meet the criteria for an equivocal response. The slight increase in mutant 
frequency observed at a single concentration without S9 in the confirmatory assay is considered to be 
a statistically aberration due to random fluctuation of the spontaneous mutant frequency. All positive 
and negative controls were within acceptable ranges. 
In  the  in  vivo  micronucleus  test  with  thalidomide  in  mouse  bone  marrow  erythropoietic  cells,  no 
clinical  signs  of  toxicity  were  observed  at  500 mg/kg.  Decreased  activity  and  writhing  were  noted 
immediately  after  dosing  ≥2500 mg/kg  thalidomide  and  persisted  up  to  24  hours  post-dose  in  a  few 
animals  of  the  5000  mg/kg  dose  group.  Bone  marrow  from  the  femurs  of  mice  receiving  0  -  5000 
mg/kg of thalidomide intraperitoneally and sacrificed at 24, 48, or 72 hours after dosing, were scored 
for  the  number  of  micronucleated  polychromatic  erythrocytes  (MPECs).  Positive  control  mice  were 
sacrificed 24 hours after intraperitoneal injection. Analysis of the data indicated that thalidomide did 
not induce any statistically significant or dose-dependent increases in MPCE frequencies at any dose 
or sacrifice time as compared to negative controls. The PCE:NCE ratios were depressed at the 24-hour 
time  point  in  mice  receiving  ≥2500  mg/kg  providing  evidence  of  bone  marrow  exposure  to  the  test 
article.

A  subgroup  of  male  mice  (21 males/group)  in  groups  3,  4,  and  5  (100,  1000,  and  3000  mg/kg/day 
respectively) was administered (±)thalidomide by oral gavage in the same manner as the main study 
animals. On study Day 7, blood samples were collected under carbon dioxide/oxygen anaesthesia via 
puncture of the orbital venous sinus from 3 males/group/time point at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 
and 24 hours following treatment. Additionally, single blood samples were also taken at the terminal 
sacrifice  during  Week  105  from  selected  animals  from  the  main  study  groups.  These  samples  were 
collected approximately 24 hours after the final dose.

Fertility and early embryonic development 
One  oral  fertility  and  general  reproduction  toxicity  study  (Segment  I  –  ICH  Harmonised  Tripartite 
Guidelines  stages  A  through  D  of  the  reproductive  process)  has  been  conducted  in  rabbits.  Female 
rabbits were randomly assigned to four dosage groups (0, 10, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day) of 25 rabbits per 
group and were dosed from 14 days prior to mating up to and including gestation day 7 (DG7). The 
four groups of males (25 per group) were dosed with 0, 30, 150, or 500 mg/kg/day from 14 days prior 
to mating with a second set of 100 untreated females. Dosing of the males continued through mating 
until the day before sacrifice – a minimum of 56 days. 
The no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was less than 10 mg/kg/day and 
the paternal NOAEL was less than 30 mg/kg/day. Body weights were adversely affected by dosages of 
10 mg/kg/day in females and 30 mg/kg/day in males. 
The NOAEL for fertility and reproduction in male rabbits was 500 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested). 
Sperm  motility,  count  and  density  were  not  affected  by  doses  as  high  as  500  mg/kg/day  and  semen 
drug  levels  demonstrated  a  dose  dependent  pattern.  Thalidomide  caused  microscopically  evident 
degeneration of the germinal epithelium of the testicles at a greater incidence in treated rabbits than 
seen  in  control  rabbits.  These  changes  included  multinucleated  giant  cells  in  the  lumen  of  the 
seminiferous  tubule  and  a  variable  loss  of  round  and  elongating  spermatids  from  the  seminiferous 
tubules. These effects were seen in the 30 mg/kg/day group and progressed in incidence and severity 
through the 150 mg/kg/day and 500 mg/kg/day groups. 
15/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mating  and  fertility  parameters  were  unaffected  by  dosages  of  (±)  Thalidomide  as  high  as  100 
mg/kg/day.  Mating  was  confirmed  in  23,  21,  21  and  23  respective  pairings  for  the  four  respective 
dosage  group  females.  There  were  24,  21,  17  and  21  pregnant  does  in  the  four  respective  dosage 
groups  resulting  in  Fertility  Indices  (number  of  pregnancies  per  number  of  rabbits  that  mated)  of 
96.0%, 95.4%, 81.0% and 87.5% in the four respective dosage groups. 
The  NOAEL  with  respect  to  embryonic  development  for  treated  male  rabbits  mated  to  untreated 
females  was  500  mg/kg/day.  Reproductive  and  litter  parameters  were  comparable  amongst  the  four 
groups of untreated females. 
The  NOAEL  with  respect  to  embryonic  development  for  treated  female  rabbits  mated  to  untreated 
males  was  less  than  10  mg/kg/day.  Observations  included  a  decrease  in  litter  averages  for  corpora 
lutea,  implantations,  litter  sizes,  does  with  viable  fetuses  and  live  fetuses.  The  number  of  early 
resorptions,  does  with  any  resorptions,  does  with  all  conceptuses  resorbed  and  the  percent  resorbed 
conceptuses  per  litter  were  increased  or  significantly  increased  in  the  100  mg/kg/day  group.  The 
number of early resorptions, the average number of early resorptions per litter and the percent resorbed 
conceptuses per litter were increased or significantly increased in the 10 and 50 mg/kg/day groups. 
Embryo-fœtal development 
No  study  on  the  toxicity  of  thalidomide  on  the  embryo-fœtal  development  was  conducted  by  the 
applicant. McBride and Lenz were the first to document an association between maternal thalidomide 
use and the increase in the incidence of limb and internal malformation of infants [22]. Thalidomide is 
known to cause a variety of congenital malformations, with in particular stunted development of limbs 
(phocomelia)  or  complete  absence  of  limbs  (amelia)  [22,  23].  Hand  deformities,  finger  aplasia  or 
hypoplasia,  and  hip  dysplasia  or  dislocation  also  occur  [22,  23].  Other  organs  susceptible  to 
malformation  include  the  ears,  lips,  palate,  eyes,  heart,  spine,  respiratory  tract,  gastrointestinal  tract, 
kidneys,  and the  reproductive  tract  [24].  In  humans,  the  available  literature  does  not  suggest  a  clear 
developmental-no-adverse-effect-level (DNOAEL) [25]. A single 50 mg thalidomide dose or several 
days dosing at 25 mg taken during the sensitive period of pregnancy is sufficient to have a teratogenic 
effect on the developing foetus [22, 23]. This sensitive period is 21-35 days after conception, a crucial 
time for the development of the limbs and major organ systems [23].  
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Time-mated female rabbits (N=31) were dosed with 0, 30, 150 or 500 mg/kg from gestation day 18 
through  day  28  of  lactation.  The  postnatal  reproductive  evaluation  was  conducted  with  the  F1 
generation rabbits when they reached approximately 6 months of age. 
F0 generation rabbits: The maternal NOEL was less than 30 mg/kg as all doses resulted in abortions. 
Reduced absolute and relative feed consumptions were seen in the two highest dose groups. There was 
no effect on the length of gestation or parturition. Thalidomide milk concentrations were higher than 
maternal thalidomide plasma concentrations. 
F1  generation  rabbits:  The  NOEL  for  viability  and growth  in  the  offspring  was  30  mg/kg. Doses  of 
150 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg caused a significant increase in pup mortality. Splayed limbs occurred in 
pups in all the maternal dose groups and the incidence of pups with splayed limbs exhibited a dose-
related  increase  in  the  150  and  500  maternal  dose  groups.  The  increase  in  the  incidence  of  splayed 
limbs  in  the  500  mg/kg  maternal  dose  group  may  have  been  to  a  treatment-related  decrease  in  litter 
size  resulting  in  superior  nutritional  status  for  rabbits  in  smaller  litters  where  musculoskeletal 
development provided inadequate support for F1 pups with quick weight gain. 
No deaths related to maternal administration of test article occurred in the F1 generation post-weaning. 
Body weights were reduced in rabbits from litters where F0 generation does were administered ≥150 
mg/kg.  Fertility  and  mating  for  the  F1  rabbits  was  affected  by  doses  of  ≥150  mg/kg  to  the  F0 
generation. 
•  Local tolerance  
No studies have been performed by the applicant. Thalidomide is administered via the oral route. 
16/61 
 
 
 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity: Thalidomide has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properies, which means 
it could have the potential to cause immunotoxicity. No findings attributable to immunotoxicity have 
been  observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  Immunotoxicity  has  not  been  observed  in  the  clinical 
setting. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In  the  Phase  I,  the  default  values  (1%  market  penetration)  resulted  in  a  PECSURFACEWATER  of  1  µg/l 
which would necessitate a phase II fate and effects analysis. Thalidomide is an orphan drug, and the 
incidence of multiple myeoloma is estimated to be 28981 patients per year. Refining the PEC based on 
a  maximal  market  penetration  (all  multiple  myeloma  patients  receive  thalidomide)  results  in 
PECSURFACEWATER = 0.0059 µg/l which is below the 0.01 µg/l threshold concentration. 
The  refined  PECSURFACEWATER  for  thalidomide  is  below  the  0.01  µg/l  threshold  concentration,  and 
thalidomide  also  has  a  Log  Ko/w  below  4.5.  Taking  these  factors  into  consideration  would  indicate 
that screening for environmental fate and effects is not necessary. Thalidomide, however, has a known 
reproductive toxicity effect in man and some animal species. Additional consideration and studies on 
the environmental fate and effects analysis have therefore been undertaken: 
- Thalidomide undergoes rapid degradation by hydrolysis in aqueous solution at neutral and alkaline 
pHs, the rate of hydrolysis increasing as the pH of the solution increases; 
-  The  ultimate  products  in  the  hydrolytic  degradation  pathway  of  thalidomide  are  the  amino  acids 
glutamic acid, glutamine, isoglutamine, and phthalic acid; 
- Absorbed thalidomide is eliminated from animals and humans almost exclusively by hydrolysis with 
subsequent elimination of the breakdown products via the urine; 
- In a rat study using radioactive thalidomide, 50 to 65% of the dose (radioactivity) was excreted in the 
faeces at higher doses; 
- In an excretion study in rhesus monkeys, 1% of radioactivity recovered from urine and faeces was 
unchanged thalidomide; 
- Thalidomide is not biodegradable; 
- Waste water used for the drug product manufacture is treated (at the site of manufacture of Pharmion 
50  mg  thalidomide  capsules)  to  degrade  the  drug  substance  by  increasing  the  pH  to  14  before 
discharge into the sewerage system; and 
- Thalidomide was found to be non-toxic to Photobacterium phosphoreum and fathead minnows at the 
highest concentration that could be tested, 45 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL, respectively. 
It was concluded that thalidomide does not represent a risk to the environment. 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacological actions of thalidomide described in the literature include anti-angiogenic 
and  immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory  activity. The  molecular  mechanism  for  the pharmacology 
of thalidomide is unknown. The proposed mechanisms for the anti-angiogenic activity of thalidomide 
include (1) a down-regulation of TNF-α levels; (2) down-regulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth 
Factor  (VEGF)  expression;  (3)  inhibition  of  the  response  to  basic  Fibroblast  Growth  Factor  (bFGF) 
and VEGF potentially through the modulation of integrin expression and impairment of migration; (4) 
inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation; and (5) blocking of cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) induction. 
Thalidomide has been shown to be efficacious in several animal models of immune-mediated and pain 
induced inflammatory disorders and TNF-α-induced conditions. Thalidomide has been show to induce 
apoptosis in human peripheral blood monocytes and to inhibit NF-κB. Thalidomide has been shown to 
induce apoptosis or growth arrest in several Multiple Myeloma (MM) cell lines. In animal models of 
MM,  thalidomide  demonstrated  some  evidence  of  anti-angiogenic  activity  as  well  as  directly 
inhibiting myeloma growth. It is considered that the non-clinical data give some support for the use of 
thalidomide in multiple myeloma. 
The  main  secondary  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  thalidomide  concerns  it’s  central  nervous  system 
(CNS)  activity,  as  exemplified  by  the  initial  use  of  thalidomide  as  a  sedative  in  Europe.  Safety 
pharmacology  studies  with  thalidomide  are  limited.  Thalidomide  shows  no  relevant  activity  on  the 
17/61 
 
 
 
 
hERG  channel.  The  lack  of  a  full  safety  pharmacology  program  is  acceptable,  given  the  clinical 
experience. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The choice of the racemate instead of a single enantiomer is justified by the interconvertion, especially 
since it leads to racemisation. The equilibrium of epimerisation and the rate to reach this equilibrium 
depend  respectively on  the  pH  and  on the  temperature.  Thalidomide  interconverts  between  the  R(+) 
and  S(-)  enantiomers  in  plasma  and  is  about  55-65%  plasma  protein  bound.  The  interconversion  of 
enantiomers  poses  a  specific  question.  The  classic  rules  which  are  based  on  the  hypothesis  of  the 
irreversible elimination of the product by excretion or metabolism are not applicable. Estimation and 
interpretation  of  the  individual  parameters  of  each  enantiomer  can  only  be  achieved  by  independent 
administration of each enantiomers and measurement of concentrations of both. In the animal studies 
only  thalidomide  racemate  was  administered,  and  the  assay  methods  were  not  enantiospecific. 
Therefore, results can only be descriptive. The calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters, clearance 
and volume of distribution, bioavailability of each enantiomer are not possible.  
The pharmacokinetics of thalidomide following oral doses are nonlinear with a plateau effect seen in 
Cmax  and  AUC(0-24hr),  across  all  species.  The  data  suggest  a  saturation  of  absorption  due  to  the  low 
solubility  of  thalidomide  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  No  clear  differences  were  seen  between  males 
and females across all species. 
Thalidomide  is  distributed  into  animals’  milk  and  semen.  The  latter  finding  has  been  taken  into 
consideration when establishing contraception requirements for adult male patients (see SPC sections 
4.4,  4.6,  and  clinical  pharmacokinetics).  Breast-feeding  should  be  discontinued  during  therapy  with 
thalidomide. 
Metabolism of thalidomide is negligible and the large number of hydrolysis products found in urine 
are those formed by the spontaneous hydrolysis of thalidomide. Interactions between thalidomide and 
other drugs are unlikely. More than 90% of the absorbed drug is excreted in urine and faeces, almost 
entirely in the form of hydrolysis products and/or metabolites. 
Toxicology 
There  is  no  available  single  dose  toxicity  studies,  however,  the  clinical  data  provided  or  from  the 
literature indicate that acute toxicity of thalidomide is quite low.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies showed: 
-  discoloured  urine  in  mice  and  dogs  (likely  due  to  the  excretion  of  degradation  products  of 
thalidomide  such  as  α-aminoglutarimide);  in  the  male  dog,  after  one  year  of  dosing,  reversible  bile 
plugs in canaliculi were observed at exposures greater than 1.9 fold the human exposure;  
-  decreased  platelet  count  in  mice  and  rats  (safety  margin:  2.4  in  the  rat  based  on  AUC  at  the 
NOAEL), likely to be species specific as no decrease in platelet counts were reported in humans;  
-  increased  liver  weight  associated  to  a  centrilobular  hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  As  claimed  by  the 
applicant,  a  link  with  hepatocellular  metabolizing  enzyme  induction  might  explain  this  effect. 
However,  pharmacokinetic  data  did  not  provide  any  demonstration  of  such  induction  (thalidomide 
very  slightly  interacts  with  CYP  and  the  major  degradation  pathway  of  thalidomide  is  spontaneous 
hydrolysis in aqueous medium). The safety margin is less than 0.3 based on the results in the mouse 
and 12 in the rat;  
-  -  no  effects  of  thalidomide  on  thyroid  function  in  dogs.  I  n  rats,  there  was  an  apparent  dose-
dependent decrease in total and free T4 that was more consistent in the female;  
-  enlarged  and/or  blue  discoloration  of  mammary  glands  and  prolonged  oestrus  in  female  dogs  at 
exposures  equal  to  1.8  or  greater  than  3.6-fold  the  human  exposure,  respectively.  The  relevance  to 
humans is unknown;  
- no changes consistent with peripheral neuropathy in rats or dogs; 
- no signs of immunotoxicity. 
18/61 
 
 
Thalidomide  is  considered  not  genotoxic  as  it  was  negative  in  the  Ames/Salmonella-E.  coli  reverse 
mutation  assay,  in  the  AS52/XPRT  mammalian  cell  forward  gene  mutation  assay  and  in  the  in  vivo 
micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow erythropoietic cells.  
No  evidence  of  carcinogenicity  was  observed  at  exposures  approximately  15,  13  and  39  times  the 
estimated  clinical  AUC  at  the  recommended  starting  dose  in  mice,  male  rats  and  female  rats 
respectively. 
Animal  studies  have  demonstrated  differences  in  species  susceptibility  to  the  teratogenic  effects  of 
thalidomide. In humans, thalidomide is a proven teratogen (see SPC section 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3). It was 
considered  acceptable  that  no  additional  non-clinical  study  was  performed.  A  study  in  rabbits 
demonstrated  no  effect  on  fertility  indices  in  males  or  females  although  testicular  degeneration  was 
observed  in  males.  A  peri  and  postnatal  toxicity  study  performed  in  rabbits  with  thalidomide 
administered  at  doses  up  to  500 mg/kg/day  resulted  in  abortions,  increased  stillbirths  and  decreased 
pup  viability  during  lactation.  Pups  from  mothers  treated  with  thalidomide  had  increased  abortions, 
reduced  body  weight  gain,  alterations  in  learning  and  memory,  decreased  fertility,  and  reduced 
pregnancy index.  
Thalidomide Pharmion 50 mg capsules do not represent a risk to the environment primarily due to the 
propensity  of  the  drug  substance  to  hydrolyse  at  pH  values  greater  than  6.0  and  the  calculated  PEC 
SURFACEWATER for thalidomide is below the 0.01 µg/l guideline [26] threshold concentration.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical programme of thalidomide comprised single-dose pharmacokinetic studies generated from 
healthy volunteers (THA I EU 2004 BA 001, Thal-BA-001, PK-001, PK-003, PK-004, PK-006, and 
PK-007)  and  from  patients  with  Hansen’s  disease  (PK-005)  and  HIV-seropositive  patients  (PK-
UK001). Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data were evaluated in 3 drug-drug interaction studies (PK-
003, Thal-PK-011, and Thal-PK-012).  
In the initial submitted application, the applicant claimed the following two therapeutic indications: 
“Thalidomide Pharmion in combination with melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of patients 
with  untreated  multiple  myeloma  ≥  65  years  or  ineligible  for  high  dose  chemotherapy”,  and 
“Thalidomide Pharmion in combination with dexamethasone for induction therapy prior to high dose 
chemotherapy  and  bone  marrow  transplant,  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  untreated  multiple 
myeloma”.  The  clinical  efficacy  data  supporting  the  therapy  of  patients  with  previously  untreated 
multiple  myeloma  ≥  65  years  or  ineligible  for  high-dose  chemotherapy  was  based  on  a  phase  III 
randomised, open label pivotal study conducted by the Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome (IFM) 
The IFM 99-06 study enrolled previously untreated  multiple  myeloma (MM) patients aged 65 to 75 
years.  Patients  were  randomized  to  the  MP,  MPT,  and  MEL100  treatment  groups  in  a  3:2:2  ratio. 
Supportive efficacy data was provided by the publication of the GISMM2001 study conducted by the 
Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell’ Adulto (GIMEMA) cooperative group. The GISMM2001 
study was a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter study comparing Thalidomide Pharmion 
in combination with MP versus MP alone in patients who were older than 65 years of age (or younger 
patients unable to undergo transplantation) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.  
For the use of thalidomide with dexamethasone for induction therapy of untreated multiple myeloma, 
two  multicenter,  open  label,  controlled,  parallel  group  Phase  III  studies  were  submitted,  including  a 
company  sponsored  THAL-MM-003  study  and  the  E1A001  study  conducted  by  the  Eastern 
Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG).  This  indication  was  withdrawn  during  the  procedure  of 
assessment of the application. 
The  company-sponsored  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the 
applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Thalidomide  treatment  must  be  initiated  and  monitored  under  the  supervision  of  physicians  with 
expertise in managing immunomodulatory or chemotherapeutic agents and a full understanding of the 
risks of thalidomide therapy and monitoring requirements. The recommended oral dose is 200 mg per 
day. Thalidomide should be taken as a single dose at bedtime, to reduce the impact of somnolence and 
19/61 
 
 
 
 
 
can  be  taken  with  and  without  food.  When  thalidomide  is  used  in  combination  with  melphalan  and 
prednisone, a maximum number of 12 cycles of 6 weeks should be used. Patients should be monitored 
for  thromboembolic  events,  peripheral  neuropathy,  rash/skin  reactions,  bradycardia,  syncope  and 
somnolence (see SPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). Dose delay, reduction or discontinuation, dependent 
upon the NCI CTC grade, may be necessary. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  plasma  samples  from  clinical  studies  were  analysed  for  thalidomide  parent 
compound using validated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. In Study PK-
005,  a  liquid  chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (LC/MS)  method  was  used  to  analyse  thalidomide 
and its potential metabolites, 3-OH-thalidomide, 4-OH thalidomide, and N-OH-thalidomide, in plasma 
and urine, at concentrations of 50 to 5000 ng/ml. HPLC/LC-MS/MS methods were used to determine 
thalidomide levels in human heparinised plasma in studies PK-007, PK-UK008, Thal-BA-001, THA I 
EU 2004 BA 001 and LA TH 03-01 and human semen in study PK-UK008. 
•  Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The relative bioavailability of two different thalidomide capsules (the commercial capsule versus IFM 
99-06 clinical trial capsule) was assessed after single oral administration in 18 healthy volunteers in a 
randomized, open-label, two-way crossover pivotal bioavailability study (THA I EU 2004 BA 001). 
The mean Cmax and AUC values were comparable between the two formulations, as confirmed by the 
points  estimate  (1.05  for  Cmax  and  1.01  for  AUC  values)  and  the  90%  confidence  intervals  (CIs) 
which were inside the bioequivalence range (0.80 to 1.25) for both Cmax and AUC. Tmax occurred 
earlier after dosing with the commercial capsule compared to the IFM 99-06 clinical trial capsule (2.5 
versus  3.5  hours,  respectively).  The  mean  terminal  half-life  was  comparable  between  formulations 
(7.05 and 6.99 hours for the IFM 99-06 clinical trial and commercial capsule, respectively). Overall, 
the mean relative bioavailability of thalidomide capsules was 1.01 ± 0.07 based on AUC(0-∞). Thus, 
the commercial thalidomide 50 mg capsule formulation was bioequivalent to the IFM 99-06 clinical 
trial thalidomide 50 mg capsule formulation in regard to extent of absorption and overall exposure of 
thalidomide. 
The absolute bioavailability of thalidomide has not been determined in humans. However, thalidomide 
has  been  shown  to  be  slowly  absorbed  from  the  gastro-intestinal  tract  following  oral  administration 
with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1 to 5 hours after dosing. The drug disappears from plasma 
monophasically with a terminal half-life of approximately 7 hours. 
Bioequivalence  
Study PK-001 was a single center, randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study which evaluated the 
bioequivalence  of  3  formulations  of  thalidomide  capsules;  commercial  formulation,  clinical  trial 
formulation,  and  a  widely  used  capsule  formulation  manufactured  by  the  Brazilian  manufacturer, 
Tortuga.  A  total  of  17  healthy  male  subjects,  aged  20  to  43 years,  were  enrolled  and  completed  the 
study. On Day 1 of each period, each subject received one of the following treatments: a single oral 
200 mg (4 x  50 mg) dose  of thalidomide, administered as  commercial formulation capsule;  a single 
oral  200  mg  (4  x  50  mg)  dose  of  thalidomide,  administered  as  clinical  trial  formulation  capsule;  a 
single oral 200 mg (2 x 100 mg) dose of thalidomide, administered as alpha-phthalimidoglutarimide 
Tortuga  capsule.  Pharmacokinetic  results  showed  the  commercial  formulation  and  the  clinical  trial 
formulation  to  be  bioequivalent.  The  Tortuga  formulation  was  not  bioequivalent  with  either 
formulation. 
Study PK-007 was a single center, randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study which assessed the 
bioavailability  of  two  formulations  of  thalidomide  (tablet  and  capsule)  relative  to  an  oral  liquid 
solution formulation. The thalidomide tablet and capsule were bioequivalent to each other with respect 
to Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞).  
Study  Thal-BA-001  was  a  single  center,  randomized,  open-label,  2-way  crossover  study  which 
investigated  the  relative  bioavailability  of  2  different  oral  formulations  of  thalidomide:  commercial 
formulation and Grünenthal tablet. Overall systemic exposure to thalidomide [AUC(0-∞)] was similar 
for  capsules  and  tablets,  with  the  2  formulations  being  shown  to  be  bioequivalent,  mean  Cmax  was 
20/61 
 
 
approximately 27% higher for the capsule compared to the tablet and the mean terminal elimination 
half-life of thalidomide was similar for the capsule and the tablet (6.9 and 7.6 hours, respectively). 
Influence of food 
Study  PK-006  was  a  single  center,  randomized,  open-label,  3-way  crossover  study  conducted  to 
determine the effect of food on the Celgene (Synovir) 50 mg capsule (commercial formulation), and to 
assess  the  relative  bioavailability  of  the  Celgene  50  mg  capsule  (commercial  formulation)  with  the 
Serral, S.A. de C.V. 100 mg tablet when both were administered in a fasting state. 
The effect of food on Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞) was minor (decreasing or increasing by less 
than  9%),  while  the  effect  of  food  on  mean  Tmax  was  significant  (increasing  by  61.8%).The 
Synovir™  thalidomide  capsule  formulation  showed  a  comparable  but  greater  relative  bioavailability 
with respect to AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) (mean ratios of 122% and 110%, respectively), and showed a 
2-fold larger Cmax (mean ratio of 194%) when compared with the Serral, S.A. de C.V. thalidomide 
tablet formulation. Co-administration of food delayed absorption but did not alter the overall extent of 
absorption. Thus, no restrictions on food intake relative to thalidomide dosing are recommended. 
Single dose PK 
Study PK-004 was a single center, randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study to characterize the 
single dose PK of thalidomide and to assess dose proportionality over the clinical dose range of 50 to 
400 mg. On Day 1 of each period, each subject received 1 of the following treatments: a single oral 50 
mg dose of thalidomide administered as Celgene Synovir capsule; a single oral 200 mg (4 x 50 mg) 
dose of thalidomide administered as Celgene Synovir capsule; and a single oral 400 mg (8 x 50 mg) 
dose of thalidomide administered as Celgene Synovir capsule. A total of 15 healthy subjects (14 male, 
1 female), aged 20 to 54 years, were enrolled. A total of 14 subjects received 50 mg thalidomide; 15 
subjects received 200 mg thalidomide; and 14 subjects received 400 mg thalidomide. Thalidomide was 
dose  proportional  in  terms  of  AUC(0-∞)  over  the  dose  range  from  50  to  400  mg.  Cmax  did  not 
increase proportionally over the same range.  
Study  PK-UK001  was  a  single  center,  open-label,  randomized,  2-way  crossover  study  to  assess  PK 
and  dose  proportionality  of  thalidomide  administered  as  a  single  dose  of  100  and  200  mg  to  male 
volunteers who were HIV-seropositive. The overall PK of thalidomide follow a 1-compartment model 
with first-order absorption and elimination. The PK parameters were similar when thalidomide 50 mg 
capsules  were  administered  as  either  two  capsules  (100  mg)  or  four  capsules  (200  mg).  Values  of 
Tmax  and  absorption  kinetic  parameters  were  variable  and  showed  a  trend  towards  slower  oral 
absorption after the 200 mg dose of thalidomide.  
Multiple dose PK 
Study  PK-003  was  a  single  center,  randomized,  open-label,  2-way  crossover  study  to  evaluate  the 
effect of steady-state concentrations of thalidomide on the PK of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, 
and  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  multiple  dose  thalidomide  PK.  Pharmacokinetic  results  showed  similar 
thalidomide PK profiles after the first dose and after 18 days of dosing. Clearance and AUC for both 
ethinyl  estradiol  and  norethindrone  were  not  significantly  altered  following  20  days  of  200  mg/day 
thalidomide to premenopausal healthy females. 
•  Distribution 
The thalidomide R(+) and S(-) enantiomers were respectively 55% and 65% bound to plasma proteins. 
Plasma  protein  binding  of  racemic  thalidomide  has  not  been  determined.  In  study  PK-UK008,  two 
HIV-seropositive male patients receiving thalidomide 100 mg/day for 8 weeks, had detectable levels 
of thalidomide found in semen (10 to 250 ng/g). Similar levels of drug (10 to 350 ng/ml) were found 
in  plasma  samples  taken  at  approximately  the  same  time.  These  findings  suggest  that  contraceptive 
precautions are necessary in partners of males taking thalidomide. 
•  Elimination 
Metabolism 
Thalidomide  is  eliminated  almost  exclusively  by  spontaneous  (non-enzymatic)  hydrolysis.  There  is 
minimal hepatic  metabolism of thalidomide. In vitro studies demonstrated that thalidomide does not 
appear  to  undergo  significant  metabolism  by  human  cytochrome  P450  (CYP).  In  study  PK-005, 
pharmacokinetics  were  assessed  by  measuring  serial  plasma  concentrations  of  thalidomide  and  the 
metabolites  3-OH-thalidomide,  4-OH-thalidomide,  and  N-OH-thalidomide.  Although  parent 
21/61 
 
 
thalidomide  was  quantifiable  at  maximum  concentrations  of  3400  ng/ml,  none  of  the  expected 
metabolites were observed in the plasma (lower limit of quantitation of all compounds was 50 ng/ml).  
Excretion 
The mean elimination half-life of thalidomide at single doses of 50 to 400 mg was between 5 and 7 
hours. In Study PK-005, thalidomide and 4-OH-thalidomide were excreted in the urine (< 1% and < 
0.01% of the dose, respectively).  
Inter-conversion 
Thalidomide proposed for this application is a racemic mixture that contains equal amounts of the S(-) 
and R (+) enantiomers. The mean half-lives of in vitro degradation are 4.3 and 3.8 hours for the R(+)- 
and S(-) enantiomers, respectively. The in vivo rate of inter-conversion half-life is 2.3 hours. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Over a dose  range of 50 to 400 mg, AUC values increased proportionately with dose but Cmax did 
not, suggesting that at higher doses, the drug may be absorbed at a slower rate (studies PK-004 and 
LA/TH 98006 conducted in post-menopausal women receiving single doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg as 
50 mg capsules under fasting conditions) 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In study THA I EU 2004 BA 001, coefficients of variation (CV%) for AUC(0-∞) and Cmax were low 
suggesting a low inter-individual variability. Intra-individual variability has not been investigated. 
Special populations 
• 
No specific PK study has been conducted in target population i.e. patients with multiple myeloma. 
Impaired  renal  function:  The  pharmacokinetics  of  thalidomide  has  not  been  specifically  studied  in 
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Study GKTH-01 was a single center, open-label, 2 
phase,  multiple-dose  study  to  compare  thalidomide  clearance  in  hemodialysis  patients;  during 
hemodialysis  and  on  days  when  patients  were  not  undergoing  hemodialysis.  In  these  patients  while 
off-dialysis, clearance of thalidomide was estimated to be 7.7 l/h. On-dialysis, the clearance was 19.6 
l/h. Analyses showed that as thalidomide is taken at bedtime,  most of the drug would be eliminated 
prior to a dialysis session.  
Impaired hepatic function: The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide 
have not been studied in humans. Thalidomide undergoes spontaneous non-enzymatic hydrolysis, and 
its  metabolism  is  not  expected  to  be  affected  by  an  alteration  in  hepatic  enzymes  or  hepatic 
dysfunction. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes do not play a 
significant role in the metabolism of thalidomide (see non-clinical section). 
Pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, weight, ethnic group, have not been studied. No specific 
PK data are available in paediatric or elderly patients. However, clinical experience in elderly patients 
with  MM  participating  in  clinical  studies  IFM  99-06,  THAL-MM-003,  and  E1A001  has  adequately 
characterized the safety profile of thalidomide ion this population [71.4% (798/1117) of patients were 
aged > 65 years].  
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Oral Contraceptives 
In study PK-003, the effect of single and multiple dose thalidomide 200 mg/day on oral contraceptives 
(0.035  mg  ethinyl  estradiol  and  1  mg  norethindrone)  was  examined.  Clearance  and  AUC  for  both 
ethinyl  estradiol  and  norethindrone  were  not  significantly  altered  following  20  days  of  continuous 
dosing with thalidomide 200 mg/day.  
Digoxin 
In study Thal-PK-011, the effect of thalidomide 200 mg/day for 7 days on the pharmacokinetics of a 
single, oral 0.5 mg dose of digoxin was examined. Thalidomide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics 
of  digoxin.  In  addition,  single-dose  administration  of  0.5  mg  digoxin  had  no  effect  on  thalidomide 
pharmacokinetics. 
Warfarin 
In study Thal-PK-012, the effect of thalidomide 200 mg/day for 9 days on the pharmacokinetics of a 
single, oral 25 mg dose of warfarin was examined. Thalidomide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics 
22/61 
 
 
of warfarin (both S-warfarin and R-warfarin), and had no effect on the international normalized ratio 
(INR).  In  addition,  single-dose  administration  of  25  mg  warfarin  had  no  effect  on  thalidomide 
pharmacokinetics. 
Medicinal products known to cause deep vein thrombosis 
There  is  an  increased  risk  for  thrombo-embolic  events  when  thalidomide  is  taken  with  other  anti-
myeloma medications such as melphalan, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone [27-31]. The incidence of 
DVT in patients treated with thalidomide alone is < 5% compared with an incidence of 10% to 12% 
when thalidomide is given concomitantly with either dexamethasone or melphalan and an incidence of 
approximately  25%  when  given  with  other  cytotoxic  chemotherapeutic  agents,  particularly 
doxorubicin.  Based  on  these  findings,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  use  of  prophylactic 
anticoagulation  in  patients  treated  for  conditions  known  to  be  associated  with  a  significant  risk  for 
thrombosis. 
A  correlation  has  been  reported  between  the  occurrence  of  thrombosis  and  treatment  with 
lenalidomide  (an analogue of thalidomide) and high-dose dexamethasone when given concomitantly 
with  erythropoietin.  Preliminary  findings  from  a  multivariate  analysis  of  data  showed  that  of  the 
patients  treated  with  the  lenalidomide/dexamethasone  combination  who  also  received  erythropoietin 
therapy, 23% experienced thrombosis compared with 5% who did not receive erythropoietin. Because 
of  similarities  between  lenalidomide  and  thalidomide,  to  further  explore  this theory,  the  relationship 
between  events  of  DVT  and  the  use  of  erythropoietin  concomitantly  with  the  combination  of 
thalidomide/dexamethasone  was  evaluated  in  Study  THAL-MM-003.  The  number  and  percent  of 
patients  with  1  or  more  DVT/PE  events  was  found  to  be  higher  in  users  vs.  non-users  for  the 
thalidomide/dexamethasone  group  (24.4%  vs.  17.6%,  respectively);  in  the  placebo/dexamethasone 
group, the incidence was comparable for the users and non-users (5.3% and 5.7%, respectively). The 
number  of  patients  who  used  erythropoietin  concomitantly  in  this  study,  however,  was  low  in  both 
the 
treatment  groups 
placebo/dexamethasone).

Medicinal products known to cause peripheral neuropathy  
Medicinal  products  known  to  be  associated  with  peripheral  neuropathy  (e.g.  vincristine  and 
bortezomib) should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide. The use of thalidomide for 
the  management  of  mucocutaneous  disorders  in  HIV-infected  patients  should  be  limited  as  it  can 
increase the neuropathic effects of zalcitabine, didanosine, and stavudine. 
Sedatives 
Thalidomide  is  known  to  enhance  the  sedative  effects  of  barbiturates,  alcohol,  chlorpromazine,  and 
reserpine. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
No  human  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  conducted  by  the  applicant.  However,  the 
pharmacodynamic  effects  of  thalidomide  are  largely  documented  in  published  literature.  The  main 
pharmacological  actions  of  thalidomide  include  anti-angiogenic  and  immunomodulatory/anti-
inflammatory activity (see also non-clinical pharmacology).  
Immunomodulation:  Several  mechanisms  may  be  involved  including  suppression  of  monocyte 
inflammatory  cytokine  production,  enhancement  of  T  cell  and  natural  killer  (NK)  cell  responses, 
down-regulation  of  selected  cell-surface  adhesion  molecules  involved  in  leucocyte  migration  and 
shifts in the ratio of CD4+ lymphocytes (helper T-cells) to CD8+ lymphocytes (cytotoxic T-cells). 
In  monocytes,  thalidomide  inhibits  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF)-α  and 
interleukin  (IL)-12  white  cells  elevating  production  of  the  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  IL-10. 
Thalidomide is generally co-stimulatory to T cells, enhancing cell proliferation and production of IL-2 
and interferon IFN-γ in both CD4+ lymphocytes (helper T cells) and CD8+ lymphocytes (cytotoxic T 
cells), with a greater effect on the CD8+ subset.  The cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells was 
augmented by thalidomide in vitro, as were the numbers of circulating NK cells and plasma IL-2 and 
IFN-γ  levels  in  multiple  myeloma  patients  on  thalidomide  therapy.    Peripheral  blood  mononuclear 
cells  (PBMC)  from  subjects  dosed  with  thalidomide  showed  an  increase  in  IFN-γ  production  and  a 
decrease in IL-5 production ex vivo, suggesting a tendency of the drug to shift the cytokine balance 
23/61 
 
 
toward  a  Th1-type  response.  However  thalidomide  treatment  of  normal  PBMC  in  vitro  caused 
inhibition of IFN-γ production and enhancement of IL4 and IL5 production suggesting a shift towards 
a  Th2-type  immune  response.  Therefore,  the  Th1/Th2  balance  of  a  system  may  shift  in  response  to 
thalidomide  according  to  the  cellular  environment  and  specific  stimuli.  Similarly,  thalidomide  has 
been shown to increase plasma TNF-α in HIV-seropositive patients. 
Cellular immunity: Mast cells, neutrophils and TNF-α are closely related in the pathogenesis of the 
inflammatory reactions.  In vitro studies have shown thalidomide to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis to 
the site of inflammation. This effect could be explained by the blunted expression of the cell-surface 
adhesion molecules, E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM, on endothelial cells in the presence of 
thalidomide.  Although contradictory data have been published, thalidomide treatment has been 
reported to reduce the number of neutrophils in skin lesions of ENL patients. 
Anti-angiogenesis:  Proposed  mechanisms  for  the  anti-angiogenic  activity  of  thalidomide  include:  a 
down-regulation  of  tumour  necrosis  factor-alpha  (TNF-α)  levels;  down-regulation  of  vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  expression;  inhibition  of  the  response  to  basic  fibroblast  growth 
factor (bFGF) and VEGF potentially through the modulation of integrin expression and impairment of 
migration;  inhibition  of  endothelial  cell  proliferation;  blocking  of  cyclooxigenase-2  (COX-2) 
induction.  
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  precise  mechanism  of  action  of  thalidomide  in  the  treatment  of  multiple  myloma  has  not  been 
defined.  In  one  clinical  study  in  patients  with  multiple  myloma,  thalidomide  decreased  the  micro-
vessel  density  and  hence,  had  some  anti-angiogenic  effects.  However,  it  has  also  been  reported  that 
three  quarters  of  patients  who  respond  to  a  thalidomide  regimen  do  not  show  alterations  in  their 
microvessel density. 
The  main  secondary  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  thalidomide  concerns  its  central  nervous  system 
(CNS) activity. As thalidomide was initially approved in Europe as a sedative, the CNS properties of 
this product are well known. 
The potential of thalidomide to prolong the QT interval has been investigated in company-sponsored 
studies  on  hERG  channels  and  in  dog  isolated  Purkinje  fibre  preparations.  Thalidomide  has  been 
shown to cause bradycardia (see also clinical safety).  
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  thalidomide  is  characterised  by  a  slow  absorption  after  oral  administration 
from  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  The  maximum  plasma  concentrations  are  reached  2-5 hours  after 
administration.  Co-administration  of  food  delays  absorption  but  does  not  alter  the  overall  extent  of 
absorption. There is a rapid in vivo rate of inter-conversion with a half-life of 2.3 hours. The plasma 
protein  binding  of  the  (+)-(R)  and  (-)-(S)  enantiomers  was  found  to  be  55%  and  65%  respectively. 
Thalidomide  is  present  in  the  semen  of  male  patients  at  levels  similar  to  plasma  concentrations. 
Therefore,  because  of  the  known  severe  teratogenic  effects  of  the  product,  during  treatment  with 
thalidomide  and  for  1 week  after  stopping  the  treatment,  male  patients  must  use  condoms  if  their 
partner is pregnant or is of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (see SPC sections 
4.4,  5.2).  The  exact  metabolic  route  and  fate  of  thalidomide  is  not  completely  known  in  humans. 
Available data indicate that the medicinal product is eliminated mainly by non-enzymatic hydrolysis. 
There  is  minimal  cytochrome  P450  catalysed  hepatic  metabolism  of  thalidomide.  There  are  in  vitro 
data  indicating  that  prednisone  may  give  rise  to  enzyme  induction  which  could  reduce  the  systemic 
exposure  of  concomitantly  used  medicinal  products.  The  in  vivo  relevance  of  these  findings  is 
unknown.  Thalidomide  does  not  interact  with  digoxin.  It  is  not  known  whether  the  effect  will  be 
different  in  multiple  myeloma  patients.  The  urinary  excretion  of  thalidomide,  as  unchanged  drug,  is 
negligible, the major route of excretion of thalidomide is non-renal. The mean elimination half-life of 
thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses  between 50 mg and 400 mg was 5.5 to 7.3 hours. 
Total systemic exposure (AUC) is proportional to dose at single-dose conditions. No time dependency 
of the pharmacokinetics has been observed. The applicant has agreed to conduct a study to clarify the 
route  and  fate  of  elimination  of  thalidomide.  Upon  review  of  the  data  generated  during  this  study, 
appropriate sections of the SPC (i.e. 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2) will be updated. In addition, the applicant has 
24/61 
 
 
committed  to  provide  population  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  information  in  the  target 
population (MM patients).  
Thalidomide  Pharmion  has  not  formally  been  studied  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  or  hepatic 
function. The pharmacokinetics of thalidomide in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function is 
unknown. No specific dose recommendations for these patient populations are available. Patients with 
severe  organ  impairment  should  be  carefully  monitored  for  adverse  reactions.  No  specific  dose 
adjustments are recommended for the elderly.  
No human pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. However, the pharmacodynamic effects of 
thalidomide have been extensively documented in the published literature. The main pharmacological 
actions of thalidomide include anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory activity.  
Thalidomide has sedative properties thus may enhance the sedation induced by anxiolytics, hypnotics, 
antipsychotics,  H1  anti-histamines,  opiate  derivatives,  barbiturates  and  alcohol.  Caution  should  be 
used when thalidomide is given in combination with medicinal products that cause drowsiness.  
Thalidomide  does  not  interact  with  hormonal  contraceptives.  However,  combined  hormonal 
contraceptives are not recommended due to the increased risk of venous thrombo-embolic disease (see 
SPC  section  4.4).  Due  to  the  potential  of  thalidomide  to  induce  bradycardia,  caution  should  be 
exercised with medicinal products having the same pharmacodynamic effect such as active substances 
known to induce torsade de pointes, beta blockers or anticholinesterase agents.

•  Dose response studies 
Based on the data from the literature [33] and from experience with thalidomide, a strategy of starting 
at 200 mg/day and increasing to a maximum of 400 mg/day, depending upon tolerability, was used in 
study IFM99-06. In study GISMM2001, thalidomide was administered at a fixed dose of 100 mg/day, 
with  a  dose  reduction  to  50  mg/day  based  on  tolerability.  In  addition  to  using  a  lower  dose, 
thalidomide  was  also  administered  over  fewer  cycles  of  shorter  duration  (6  cycles  of  4  weeks) 
compared with study IFM99-06. In study THAL-MM-003, the thalidomide dose was to be escalated 
from 50 mg/day from days 1 to 14 of cycle 1, to 100 mg/day from days 15 to 28, and administered at 
200 mg/day from cycle 2 onwards. The overall median daily dose was 200 mg (mean 149.6 mg) and

METHODS 
Study Participants  
This was a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase III trial. The main inclusion criteria were patients 
with  MM  [defined  as  per  the  Southwest  Oncology  Group  (SWOG)  criteria]  [34]  never  previously 
treated  for  MM;  aged  between  65  and  75  years,  or  age  less  than  65  years,  but  not  eligible  for  a 
treatment intensification protocol with bone marrow suppression conditioning; MM of stage II or III as

documented infection due to Gram+ cocci or Gram – bacilli in the year. Patients with kidney failure 
with serum creatinine ≥ 50 mg/l (450 µmol/l), impaired cardiac condition, or significant impairment of 
hepatic function were not to be included in the study.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomized to either arm A: conventional treatment melphalan/prednisone (MP), arm B: 
conventional treatment plus thalidomide (MPT), or arm C: intensive treatment.  
In arm A: MP (melphalan: 0.25 mg/kg/day; prednisone: 2 mg/kg/day) were administered orally every 
6  weeks  from  day  1  to  day  4.  In  the  absence  of  disease  progression,  12  courses  were  given.  The 
prednisone  was  administered  in  accordance  with  the  standard  practices  at  each  center.  Patients  who 
developed a complication necessitating permanent withdrawal of treatment were to be withdrawn from 
the study, but follow-up was continued. Further treatment was left to the investigator's discretion. 
In  arm  B:  The  MP  treatment  was  identical  to  that  for  arm.  In  addition,  patients  were  to  receive 
continuous  oral  treatment  of  thalidomide  at  the  maximum  tolerable  dosage,  without  exceeding  400 
mg/day. The starting dose was 200 mg/day (single dose at night). After 2 to 4 weeks the dose could be 
increased  to  400  mg/day  (as  a  single  dose  or  divided  into  2  doses).  However,  the  initial  dose  and 
subsequent thalidomide dosage adjustments were left to the investigator’s discretion. In the absence of 
toxicity,  thalidomide  was  administered  throughout  the  duration  of  MP  chemotherapy,  until  day  4  of 
the 
twelfth  course.  The  emergence  of  symptomatic  peripheral  neuropathy,  confirmed  by 
electromyogram, gave rise to permanent withdrawal of thalidomide.  
In  arm  C:  patients  were  to  receive  2  courses  of  VAD  (each  from  day  1  to  day  4),  separated  by  an 
interval  of  4  weeks.  Dosage  was  adjusted  according  to  age.  Four  weeks  after  the  second  course  of 
VAD,  if  patients  did  not  meet  any  of  the  non-intensification  criteria,  peripheral  blood  stem  cells 
(PBSC)  were  mobilized  by  administration  of  3  g/m2  cyclophosphamide  with  subsequent  mesna 
(sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate), day 0. G-CSF was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 
10 µg/kg/day from day +1 until the last day of cytapheresis, which was initiated when the neutrophil 
count  was  ≥  4  x  109/l.  In  the  absence  of  any  non-intensification  criteria,  the  subjects  were  then  to 
receive 2 intravenous courses of melphalan 100mg/m2 (MEL100). VAD consisted of vincristine: 0.4 
mg and adriblastine (doxorubicin): 9 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion over 24 hours for 4 consecutive 
days (days 1 to 4), dexamethasone: 40 mg/day for 4 consecutive days (days 1 to 4), administered by 
the oral or IV route. 
26/61 
 
 
 
Prednisone  therapy  was  administered  in  accordance  with  the  standard  practices  at  each  center.  If 
adverse  effects  (minor  neuropsychological  disorders,  glucoregulation  disorders  or  moderate 
hypertension)  occurred,  the  investigator  could  reduce  the  dexamethasone  dosage  by  50%  (i.e.,  20 
mg/day on 4 consecutive days). The second course of VAD was postponed for 1 week if the neutrophil 
count  was  <  1500/mm3  and/or  the  platelet  count  was  <  100,000/mm3.  IV    cyclophosphamide  was 
administered on Day 0 at a dosage of 3 g/m2 with fluid supplementation in combination with mesna, 
as per the procedures used in each center. No dosage adjustment for the course of cyclophosphamide 
was scheduled. G-CSF was administered SC at a dosage of 10 µg /kg/day. G-CSF was to be initiated 
on  the  day  after  cyclophosphamide  administration  (Day  +1)  and  continued  until  the  end  of  the 
cytaphereses. Cytaphereses were initiated when the neutrophil count was ≥ 4 x 109/l. The cytaphereses 
were implemented daily until at least ≥ 4 x 106  CD34+ cells/kg had been harvested or a maximum of 4 
cytaphereses had been conducted. The harvested cells were cold-stored as per the procedure in each 
center. The first course of MEL100 was administered 4 to 6 weeks after cyclophosphamide, providing 
that  no  non-intensification  criteria  had  been  met.  Melphalan  was  administered  at  a  dosage  of  100 
mg/m2  by  infusion  over  30  minutes  with  fluid  supplementation.  No  dosage  adjustment  for  the 
MEL100 courses was scheduled. A minimum of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg was re-infused 36 hours after 
melphalan  administration.  G-CSF  was  initiated  on  Day  +5  at  a  dosage  of  150  µg/m2  and  continued 
until the neutrophil count was ≥ 1,000/mm3 on 3 consecutive days. 
The  second  course  of  MEL100  was  administered  2  months  after  the  first  course,  providing  that  no 
non-intensification  criteria  had  been  met.  Patients  were  required  to  have  achieved  satisfactory 
hematological  recovery  following  the  first  course  of  MEL100,  indicated  by  a  leukocyte  count  ≥ 
3,000/mm3 and a platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3. The second course of MEL100 was identical to the 
first.  A  minimum  of  2  x  106  CD34+  cells/kg  was  re-infused.  G-CSF  was  initiated  on  Day  +5  at  a 
dosage  of  150  µg/m2  and  continued  until  the  neutrophil  count  was  ≥  1,000/mm3  on  3  consecutive 
days.  Hematological

Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy (survival) of thalidomide in combination with the 
standard  MP  regimen,  as  compared  with  the  use  of  VAD+high  dose  melphalan  with  ABMT,  in 
patients with previously untreated MM, aged 65 to ≤ 75 years (or < 65 but not eligible for treatment 
intensification protocol with bone marrow suppression conditioning). The secondary objectives were 
to  compare  the  best  response  rate,  the  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  and  the  survival  after 
progression, and safety in patients treated with MPT or with MEL100 or with MP as first-line therapy 
for patients with previously untreated MM aged 65 to 75 years. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  overall  survival  (OS)  and  was  defined  as  the  time  (months)  from 
randomisation to death from any cause. Patients were censored at the last date that they were known to 
be alive whether they were still alive at the time of analysis or were lost to follow-up before death.  
The secondary outcome measures included Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the time from 
randomization  to  first  progression  or  death  from  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  first.  Patients  were 
censored at the last date that the patient was known to be alive without disease progression, or at the 
data cut-off date (08 October 2005), whichever occurred first. 
Estimate  of  the  objective  tumor  response  rates  (CR,  VGPR,  PR,  MR).  The  achievement  of  any 
response  required  an  improvement  in  serum  and  urine  monoclonal  (M)  protein,  supported  by  an 
improvement or no worsening of bone pain and performance status, correction of hypercalcaemia, and 
no increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions. Definitions for the different levels of response are 
described  below.  These  definitions  were  the  standard  criteria  used  by  IFM  at  the  time  of  study 
initiation and had been developed by IFM based on the data available at that time. During the study, 
the level of response at each evaluation (i.e. 3, 6, 12, and 18 months) was to be reported on the CRF. 
These assessments of response were reviewed centrally by the coordinating PI to ensure consistency 
across  the  study.  Confirmation  of  response  was  not  required  as  part  of  the  response  definition. 
Laboratory measurements were performed locally at each evaluation. Skeletal radiography was to be 
performed locally when needed to assess lytic bone lesions.  
27/61 
 
 
Complete response (CR): Resolution of the baseline symptoms; no new bone lesions; normalization of 
the laboratory test results: complete blood cell (CBC) count, serum calcium, urinary protein, protein 
electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis; normal myelogram and bone marrow biopsy. 
Very  good  partial  response  (VGPR):  Criteria  as  for  MR,  except:  more  than  90%  decrease  in  serum 
monoclonal  protein  peak,  more  than  95%  decrease  in  Bence  Jones  (BJ)  protein  excretion  and  bone 
marrow plasmacytosis < 5%. 
Partial  response  (PR):  Criteria  as  for  MR,  except:  more  than  50%  decrease  in  serum  monoclonal 
protein peak and at least 75% decrease in BJ protein excretion. 
Minimal  response  (MR):  No  new  lytic  bone  lesion(s)  or  enlargement  of  existing  lesion(s)  or  other 
symptom(s)’;  decrease  in  bone  pain;  normalization  of  hypercalcaemia;  more  than  20%  but  less  than 
50% decrease in the serum monoclonal protein peak or BJ protein excretion. 
Stable disease (SD): At any time during the course of the disease, patients were considered stable if 
their disease did not meet the criteria for response or progressive disease. 
Patients meeting any of the following criteria at anytime during the disease course were considered to 
have progressed. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as: increase in WHO performance status (by at 
least  1  point  if  baseline  status  was  ≥1);  extension  of  the  myelomatous  bone  lesions;  emergence, 
persistence  or  exacerbation  of  anaemia  of  central  origin  (with  Hb  <  80  g/l)  or  other  signs  of  bone 
marrow  insufficiency  after  having  discounted  an  iatrogenic  aetiology;  emergence  or  exacerbation  of 
kidney failure; emergence or exacerbation of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium > 106 mg/l or 
2.65 mmol/l); increase, confirmed by 2 successive assessments, of the monoclonal protein component. 
Depending on the baseline, a significant increase was to be considered as 30% or 5 g/l (50% increase 
of BJ protein). The relevant laboratory and bone radiological assessments performed at baseline were 
to be repeated to confirm disease progression. 
Survival after progression was measured and defined as the time from first progression to death from 
any cause. This time was equal to 0 if progression and death occurred at the same date. Patients were 
censored at the last date that the patient was known to be alive, or at the data cut-off date (08 October 
2005), whichever occurred first. 
Sample size 
Assuming  a  median  survival  time  of  30  months  in  the  control  arm  (MP),  and  using  the  Bonferroni 
correction  for  a  global  type  I  error  rate  of  5%  in  the  two  primary  comparisons  of  the  study 
(comparison of the MPT or the MEL100 arm to the control arm), sample size was estimated to be 500 
in  order  to  ensure  a  power  of  at  least  80%  in  a  two-sided  test  to  detect  an  increase  in  the  median 
survival time of 18 months (with an accrual time of 3 years and additional follow-up of 2 years). This 
clinically  meaningful  increase  in  median  survival  was  considered  plausible  for  each  of  the  two 
treatments, MPT and MEL100, compared to MP and corresponds to an HR of 0.625 for death when 
comparing MPT or MEL100 to MP (about 101 deaths required in the two compared groups). Power 
calculations  were  not  performed  for  each  interim  analysis,  since  the  corresponding  tests  were 
performed with a type I error of 0.001, following the Peto-Haybittle rule [35]. 
Randomisation 
Central randomisation to arms A, B and C in a ratio of 3:2:2 was done. No stratification was used. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. Due to the nature and administration methods of the different treatments 
in this study, blinding was not feasible. 
Statistical methods 
All  efficacy evaluations  were  conducted  using  the ITT  population,  except  for  supportive analysis  of 
the  primary  endpoint  and  for  best  responses  based  on  the  PP  population.  Statistical  comparison  of 
efficacy  findings  was  made  between  MP  and  MPT,  MP  and  MEL100,  and  MPT  and  MEL100.  The 
primary  analysis  involved  comparisons  between  MP  and  MPT,  and  between  MP  and  MEL100. 
Comparisons between MPT and MEL100 were performed as secondary analyses. 
28/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Time-to-event endpoints (death [OS], progression or death [PFS] and survival after progression) were 
analyzed  using  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  survival  methods  from  randomisation,  or  from  progression  for 
survival  after  progression.  The  number  and  percentage  of  events  and  censored  observations  were 
presented by treatment group and overall. Time-to-events were expressed as median +/- standard error 
(SE).  The  median  time-to-event  data  were  presented  with  95%  confidence  limits.  Additionally, 
univariate  summary  statistics  (mean,  standard  deviation,  minimum  and  maximum)  for  event  times, 
unadjusted  for  censoring,  were  presented  by  treatment  and  overall.  Differences  in  the  survival 
distributions  among  treatment  groups  were  assessed  using  two-sided  unstratified  log  rank  tests  with 
α=0.025 level of significance. The hazard rate ratio and the corresponding 97.5% confidence interval 
were  estimated  using  an  unstratified  Cox  proportional  hazards  model.  Overall  survival  comparisons 
between  treatment  groups  were  performed  adjusting  for  prognostic  factors  through  the  proportional 
hazards model. 
Baseline characteristics were analyzed for their prognostic value on OS from randomization, adjusted 
for treatment group, through a multivariate proportional hazards model, using forward selection with 
likelihood  ratio  test.  In  these  prognostic  analyses,  each  continuous  variable  was  first  divided  into  5 
categories  at  approximately  the  20th,  40th,  60th,  and  80th  percentiles.  After  univariate  analysis,  all 
variables with a p-value less than 0.20 were  subjected to multivariate analyses in several steps, first 
including  all  variables  with  no  missing  values  and  then  successively  including  variables  with  an 
increasing number of missing values. At each step, the stability of the previously derived model was 
checked  and  no  further  analysis  was  performed  in  the  case  of  instability.  The  proportional  hazards 
assumption  was  checked  for  each  prognostic  factor  included  in  the  final  model  by  testing  a  time 
(logarithm)  by  factor  interaction  term  in  the  model.  These  analyses  were  performed  in  the  ITT 
population. 
RESULTS 
Participant flow and recruitment 
A total of 447 patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups and comprised the ITT 
population. Enrolment began on 22 May 2000. The data cut-off for the analyses presented in the report 
was 8 October 2005. An update to OS was conducted for the IFM 99-06 study based on data collected 
through the cut-off date of 08 January 2007. Thus approximately 15 months of additional follow-up 
data has been obtained.  
Before treatment initiation, 4 patients (3 and 1 randomized to MP and MPT, respectively) died and 4 
patients  randomized  to  MEL100  discontinued  the  study.  Of  the  447  patients  who  were  randomized, 
439  (98.2%)  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  and  comprised  the  safety  population.  A 
total of 427 (95.5%) patients, who had no major protocol deviations and took at least one dose of study 
medication, comprised the PP population.  
The numbers of patients in the ITT population who were randomized to the MP, MPT and MEL100 
treatment groups were 196 (43.8%), 125 (28.0%) and 126 (28.2%), respectively. 
Approximately half of the patients who received MP or MPT received at least 9 cycles of MP. Of the 
125  patients  in  the  MPT  group,  78  (62%)  discontinued  thalidomide  prematurely  and  47  (38%)  had 
their  initial  dose  reduced.  A  patient  could  have  had  a  dose  reduction  and  subsequently  discontinue 
treatment. In the MEL100 group, 79 (65%) patients received the 2 planned transplants. 
Two  interim  analyses  were  planned  to  take  place  after  the  inclusion  of  200  (40%)  and  350  (70%) 
patients.  The  minimum  follow-up  available  for  patients  who  were  included  in  these  analyses  was 
6 months at the first interim analysis and 5 months at the second. The first interim analysis took place 
as planned after the inclusion of 200 subjects on 02 January 2003. This first interim analysis found that 
there was no statistical advantage of one treatment over another. At the second interim analysis, which 
was  performed  in  July  2004  and  was  5  months  after  the  enrolment  of  the  340th  patient,  the  DSMB 
recommended that recruitment should continue, but that a third interim analysis should be performed 
in  May  2005.  The  third  interim  analysis  was  performed  using  all  data  available  at  that  time 
(01 May 2005; 436 patients), and for 408 patients with a minimum follow-up of 5 months. Following 
the  results  of  the  third  interim  analysis,  recruitment  into  the  trial  was  stopped  (on  08  August  2005, 
after the inclusion of 447 patients) due to a log rank p-value of 0.0008 in favour of MPT when OS was 
compared with that in the MP treatment group in the ITT population. 
29/61 
 
 
 
The additional follow-up time provided approximately 30% more deaths 268 compared to 206 in the 
analysis presented in the CSR and an increase in median follow-up time of approximately 40% (51.5 
months compared to 36.8 months). 
Patients  who  were  alive  at  the  time  of  analysis  or  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  before  death  was 
documented  were  censored  at  the  last  date  they  were  known  to  be  alive.  All  censored  information 
corresponded to administrative censoring, except for 1 MP-treated patient who was lost to follow-up 
approximately 20 months after randomization. The first censored observation for each treatment group 
occurred approximately 17 months after randomization. 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  twenty-two  protocol  amendments  to  the  study,  the  majority  of  which  related  to 
modifications of the investigator list and/or extension of the study period. 
Baseline data 
Baseline  demographic  parameters  were  evenly  distributed  in  the  three  treatment  arms  of  the  pivotal 
study (see table 12). This was true for baseline disease characteristics as well (data not shown). The 
impact  of  prognostic  factors  on  primary  outcome  data  is  taken  care  of  by  the  multivariate  analyses 
conducted.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
MPT treatment was  superior to both MP and MEL100 for prolonging OS, with the  median survival 
increased by 21.4 and 15.0 months, respectively. The primary comparison (MPT:MP) for the primary 
endpoint of OS showed MPT to be superior to MP (HR 0.56, 97.5% CI 0.37 to 0.84, p=0.0012). The

secondary  comparison  (MPT:MEL100),  was  associated  with  an  OS  advantage  for  MPT  compared 
with MEL100 (HR 0.58, 97.5% CI 0.37 to 0.89, p=0.0048). 
After approximately 15 months of additional follow-up survival data, the median OS advantage was 
18.4 months for MPT relative to MP treatment. The updated OS data had an observed hazard ratio of 
MPT to MP of 0.59 (97.5% CI 0.42 to 0.84) compared to the corresponding hazard ratio in the clinical 
study report of 0.56 (97.5% CI 0.37 to 0.84). 
The numbers (percentage) of patients who died up to the data cut-off date of 08 January 2007 were 62 
(49.6%),  128  (65.3%),  and  78  (61.9%),  in  the  MPT  (n=125),  MP  (n=196)  and  MEL100  groups 
(n=126),  respectively.  Median  OS  times  were  51.6,  33.2,  and  38.3  months  in  the  MPT,  MP  and 
MEL100 groups, respectively. The MPT survival curve separated from the MP and MEL100 curves at 
about 2 months and remained separated for the duration of the study.

A  conservative  sensitivity  analysis  correcting  for  asymmetrical  visit  schedules  demonstrated  results 
that were consistent with the main PFS analysis. Specifically, actual censoring and event times for the 
MPT-treated patients were reassigned to the earlier scheduled assessment times and were analyzed in 
the same way as the main PFS analysis. These results showed a statistically significant prolongation of 
PFS  for  patients  treated  with  MPT  compared  with  MP  and  MEL100  (log  rank  p-values  of  <0.001 
and 0.0012, respectively; median time to PFS was 24 months for MPT; median times to PFS remained 
the same for MP and MEL100).

The  median  survival  after  progression times  in  the  entire  ITT  population  in  the  MPT  (11.9  months) 
and  MP  (10.9  months)  groups  were  identical  to  those  obtained  in  the  subset  of  patients  who 
progressed.  These  results  may  provide  some  evidence  that  the  primary  endpoint  of  OS  was  not 
affected by treatment after progression. However, this study was not powered to assess this question 
so these results should be interpreted with caution and no definitive conclusions drawn. 
The OS data was consistent regardless of subgroup based on selected prognostic factors (see table 17). 
The beneficial effect was even more pronounced in most unfavourable groups of patients, e.g. those 
with performance status 2, ß2-M ≥ 2.5, DS stage III and chromosomal aberration. One unfavourable 
(small) group that was not gaining benefit from the addition of thalidomide to MP was patients with 
elevated creatinine, serum creatinine ≥ 20.

GISMM2001 
METHODS 
The  GISMM2001  study  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  controlled,  multicenter  study  comparing 
thalidomide in combination with MP versus MP alone in patients who were older than 65 years of age 
(or younger patients unable to undergo transplantation) with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.  
Patients  in  the  MPT  arm  received  thalidomide  100 mg/day  orally  with  melphalan  at  4  mg/m2  on 
Days 1 to 7 and prednisone at 40 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 7. Patients in the MP arm received melphalan 
and prednisone at the same dose and schedule used in the MPT arm. This cycle was repeated every 4 
weeks for a standard 6 cycles. After completion of the 6 cycles thalidomide could be administered at 
100 mg/day as maintenance therapy until progression.  
The primary objectives of this study were to compare clinical response rates and event free survival 
(EFS)  between  treatment  groups.  The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  OS,  prognostic  factors, 
and time to first response. EFS was calculated as the time from the diagnosis to progression/ relapse, 
death of any cause, or the date the patient was last known to be in remission. 
Response to treatment was monitored by measurement of myeloma protein in serum and urine every 4 
weeks. Response rate was assessed by the local investigator, according to the Bladé response criteria 
at 6 months (i.e. after the 6 cycles of MP/MPT).

Two interim analyses were performed during the study. The first interim analysis was done for safety 
monitoring. At the second interim analysis (data lock 15 June 2005) the study was stopped (87% of 
planned recruitment) and 255 patients with at least 6 months follow-up were included in the analysis 
(minimal time required to evaluate clinical response).  
RESULTS 
The  baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups. 
The median age of study participants was 72 (range 60-85) years. 
The  second  interim  analysis  showed  the  MPT  group  as  having  a  significant  improvement  in  the 
response  rate  (p<0.0001)  and  EFS  (p=0.0006)  compared  with  the  MP  group.  Treatment  with  MPT 
produced a higher response rate (complete response + partial response) 76.0% compared to a 47.6% 
response rate in the MP treatment group. The 2-year event free survival rates were significantly longer 
in the MPT treatment group (54%) compared with the MP treatment group (27%) (HR 0.51, 95% CI 
0.35-0.75, p=0.0006).

METHODS  
This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double  blind,  placebo  controlled  study  of 
combination  thalidomide  plus  dexamethasone  therapy  versus  dexamethasone  therapy  alone  as 
induction therapy for previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma. The main inclusion criteria 
were  patient  ≥  18  years;  diagnosis  of  active  multiple  myeloma  (Durie-Salmon  Stage  II  and  III;  and 
must  not  have  received  previous  anti-myeloma  systemic  therapy  (previous  local  radiotherapy  was 
permissible).  Radiation  therapy  initiated  prior  to  baseline  (Day  1)  could  have  been  given  in 
conjunction  with  study  drug,  provided  that  all  other  eligibility  criteria  were  satisfied;  Measurable 
levels of myeloma paraprotein in serum (≥ 1.0 g/dL) or urine (≥ 0.2 g excreted in a 24-hour collection 
sample);  ECOG  performance  status  score  of  0,  1,  or  2.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  time  to 
disease  progression  (TTP),  defined  as  the  number  of  days  from  randomization  to  the  first 
documentation  of  disease  progression,  as  determined  by  the  RRC,  based  on  the  Bladé  myeloma 
response criteria. Secondary efficacy endpoints was PFS (defined as the time from randomization to 
documented  progression,  as  determined  by  the  RRC,  or  death  from  any  cause,  whichever  occurred 
first), myeloma response rate (based on the best response assessment during the treatment period, as 
determined by the RRC, and categorized according to the Bladé myeloma response criteria), complete 
response  (CR),  partial  response  (PR),  stable  disease  (SD),  progressive  disease  (PD),  duration  of 
myeloma response, time to first symptomatic skeletal-related event and overall survival.

METHODS  
This  study  was  a  randomized,  multicenter,  open  label,  controlled,  parallel  group  phase  3  trial  in 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma conducted by the ECOG study group. Patients were 
randomized  to  thalidomide/dexamethasone  or  dexamethasone  alone.  Patients  randomized  to  the 
thalidomide/dexamethasone  treatment  group  received  thalidomide  200  mg  orally  once  daily  for  28 
days (1 treatment cycle) plus dexamethasone 40 mg orally once daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 for 
the  28-day  treatment  cycle.  Patients  randomized  to  dexamethasone  alone  treatment  group  received 
dexamethasone 40 mg orally once daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of the 28-day treatment cycle. 
These treatment regimens were repeated every 4 weeks for a total of 4 cycles. Following 4 treatment 
cycles,  eligible  patients  that  had  not  progressed  were  eligible  to  receive  stem  cell  transplantation. 
Patients who had not progressed and were not eligible for stem cell transplant received either standard 
MM  therapy  or  continued  on  thalidomide  and/or  dexamethasone  in  an  extension  phase  at  the 
investigator’s discretion until progression. 
RESULTS 
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were in general well balanced between the 
treatment groups. The median age of study participants was 64 (range 38-83) years.

Based on ECOG criteria, the time to the best myeloma response during the first 4 cycles of treatment 
was  similar  between  treatment  groups  with  a  median  time  of  4.9  weeks  for  patients  in  the 
thalidomide/dexamethasone treatment group compared to 5.1 weeks for patients in the dexamethasone 
only  treatment  group.  The  time  to  first  confirmed  response  was  also  similar  with  a  median  of  4.9 
weeks in both treatment groups. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No  dose  response  studies  with  thalidomide  were  conducted  by  the  applicant.  The  lack  of  phase  II 
study  is  justified  by  narrow  safety  margin  (100mg  -  400mg).    When  considering  patient  year  of 
exposure in the IFM 99-06 study, there were no adverse events that appeared to be dose related within 
the  range  of  doses  (50  to  400  mg).  However,  a  greater  percentage  of  patients  who  received  a 
maximum  dose  of  400  mg/day  required  subsequent  dose  reductions  than  those  who  received  a 
maximum  daily  dose  of  200mg/day  indicating  that  patient  tolerability  was  better  at  the  200  mg/day 
dose. Based on this information, the CHMP has recommended that thalidomide is administered orally 
at 200 mg per day for a duration, as tolerated, of up to 12 cycles of 6 weeks (see SPC section 4.2).  
In  the  pivotal  study  IFM  99-06  the  melphalan-prednisone  regimen  was  considered  as  a  valid 
comparator, and a valid additive design due to the differing toxicity profiles between thalidomide and 
the agents used in the combination. The use of overall survival (OS) as primary efficacy endpoint is in 
line with CHMP guideline [36] and is particularly preferred in an open label design. However, with 
emerging new treatment options in multiple myeloma (MM), it is anticipated that the survival time is 
affected by later lines of treatment and progression free survival (PFS) may become more appropriate 
for the primary analysis. A secondary analysis of OS after disease progression addressed this issue. 
The  increased  median  OS  time  from  32.2  to  53.6  months  when  thalidomide  is  added  to  MP, 
comprising  an  additional  21.4  months  was  considered  a  substantial  clinical  benefit  for  the  targeted 
patient  population.  The  HR  is  0.56  (0.37,  0.89)  with  p=0.0012.  The  efficacy  of  thalidomide  in 
combination with MP when compared to MP alone tended to be higher in worst prognostic population 
(deletion  q13,  high  serum  β2-  microglobulin  level)  and  Durie-Salmon  (DS)  stages  III  patients. 
However,  the  IFM  99-06  study  was  not  designed  for  prognostic  factors  sub-group  analysis.  The  15 
months follow-up data showed that the OS advantage was maintained with updated median survival 
times of 51.6 ± 4.5 and 33.2 ± 3.2 months in the MPT and MP groups, respectively (HR 0.59, 97.5% 
CI 0.42 to 0.84). 
Secondary efficacy measures were all in support of the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis of PFS 
adjusting  for  differential  delay  of  visits  confirmed  the  initial  analysis  results.  The  response  rates  of 
MPT concerning CR and VGPR were as good as those obtained with the high dose regimen combined 
with  ABMT.  OS,  however,  was  better  with  MPT,  reflecting  either  treatment  induced  mortality  with 
high  dose  chemotherapy  or  a  superior  efficacy  of  the  thalidomide  combination in  early  treatment  of 
MM, at least in the population aged between 65 and 75. 
MPT  appeared  superior  to  MEL100  (increase  in  median  survival  time  of  15  months  in  MPT  group 
over  MEL100).  However,  only  a  few  patients  received  the  complete  MEL  100  regimen  making 
impossible the comparison between MEL100 and MPT.  
The  41/16/21  %  of  patients  withdrawn  in  the  MPT/MP/MEL100  arms  did  not  receive  second  line 
treatment.  So  the  OS  outcome  was  obtained  despite  less  treatment  after  withdrawal  from  study 
treatment, irrespective of cause, of the patients in the thalidomide treated group. The type of second-
line treatment differed as expected considerably between treatment arms. Nine patients in the MP arm 
and  3  patients  in  the  MPT  arm  received  VAD  followed  by  transplantation.  The  survival  after 
progression was very similar irrespective of treatment assignment, indicating that the primary endpoint 
OS  was  not  affected  by  treatment  after  progression,  and  supporting  the  first  line  indication  for 
thalidomide.  
The GISMM2001 study is supporting the conclusion drawn from the pivotal IFM 00-07 study that the 
addition  of  thalidomide  to  MP  is  enhancing  the  anti-myeloma  effect  of  the  chemotherapy.  This  is 
shown by the increased ORR, the prolongation of EFS and trend of increased OS. The regimen given 
in this study was more toxic, as the proportion of early deaths was increased in the experimental arm.  
39/61 
 
 
 
The pivotal company-sponsored trial THAL-MM-003 (and the supportive E1A00 study) conducted by 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group investigated thalidomide plus dexamethasone therapy versus 
dexamethasone  therapy  alone  as  induction  therapy  for  previously  untreated  subjects  with  multiple 
myeloma. The following limitations were identified: 
- Dexamethasone alone is not the gold standard for induction especially in young MM patients. The 
right comparator should have been e.g. VAD in a large subset of included patients [6]. 
-  The  study  (THAL-MM-003)  population  (age  ≥  18  years,  MM  Durie-Salmon  stage  II  and  III,  not 
having received previous anti-myeloma systemic, ECOG performance status score of 0, 1, or 2) is not 
representative of the target population (18 to 65 years old, newly diagnosed MM patients eligible  to 
HDT/ASCT). 
- Neither TTP (THAL-MM-003) nor overall best response based (in E1A00) are appropriate primary 
endpoints to serve the objective i.e. achievement of successful transplantation. 
This (induction) indication supported by these data was withdrawn by the applicant after the first list 
of questions. 
Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
A total of 1260 patients/subjects involved in the clinical pharmacology and controlled clinical studies 
received a treatment. A total of 610 patients/subjects received thalidomide (see table 23). 
Data from clinical studies (IFM 99-06, THAL-MM-003, and E1A00) were not pooled but analysed for 
each  study  as  the  criteria  used  to  “grade”  adverse  events  were  different  across  these  3  controlled 
clinical studies. Safety data from studies GIMEMA and GISMM2001 were not presented.  
In study IFM 99-06, the planned 12 cycles of MP were completed by a higher proportion of patients in 
the  MP  group  than  in  the  MPT  group  (36.7%  vs.  25.8%,  respectively).  For  the  entire  study  (18 
months), in the MPT group, the median duration of thalidomide treatment was 10.5 months, and the 
median daily dose was 217.4 mg. 
In THAL-MM-003 study, treatment exposure ranged from 1 day to 28 weeks (6.5 months). Exposure 
was from 6.5 months up to a year for 18.8% and 19.2% of thalidomide and dexamethasone patients, 
respectively  (thalidomide/dexamethasone  combination),  and  30.6%  and  29.7%  placebo  and 
dexamethasone  patients,  respectively  (placebo/dexamethasone  combination).  The  median  average 
daily dose overall was 200 mg for thalidomide or placebo associated in both groups with concomitant 
40 mg dexamethasone.

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In Study IFM 99-06, serious adverse events were reported for 38.7% (48/124) of patients in the MPT 
group and 29.5% (57/193) of patients in the MP group. Those reported by > 2% of patients in either of 
the treatment groups are summarized in Table 27. In the MPT group, pulmonary embolism and deep 
vein thrombosis, pneumonia pyrexia and back pain were the most frequently reported serious adverse 
events.

Throughout the study period, a total of 35 deaths were recorded (18 in the MP group, 7 in the MPT 
group,  and  10  in  the  MEL100  group).  General  and  physical  deterioration  [3  (2.4%)]  was  most 
frequently reported in the MPT group. There were a total of 125 deaths in a study THAL-MM-003 (57 
in  the  thalidomide/dexamethasone  treatment  group  and  68  in  the  placebo/dexamethasone  treatment 
group).  In  the  thalidomide/dexamethasone  group,  42%  (24/57)  of  deaths  were  due  to  disease 
progression versus 59% (40/68) in the placebo/dexamethasone group.  
•  Laboratory findings 
Myelosuppression  was  increased  when  thalidomide  was  added  to  MP  or  dexamethasone,  especially 
the incidence of neutropenia and leucopenia was higher in the MPT treatment group compared with 
the MP treatment group (see table 29, 30 and 31).

•  Safety in special populations 
No safety analysis in special populations was performed in study IFM 99-06. Data from studies Thal-
MM-003 or E1A00 did not show any gender difference regarding adverse effects (data not shown). 
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There  we  no  safety  analysis  of  drug-drug  interactions  studies  (see  also  clinical  pharmacokinetic 
interaction studies). 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rates of discontinuation due to AEs across the 3 controlled studies (IFM-99-006, THAL-MM-003, 
and E1A00) were higher in thalidomide treated patients than in the control arms (see tables 32 and 33). 
In the IFM-99-06 study, more patients experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug in the 
MPT  group  (42.7%;  53/124)  compared  to  the  MP  group  (7.8%;  15/193).  Peripheral  neuropathy 
(8.9%), neutropenia (5.6%) and paresthesia (4.0%) were the most frequently observed AEs resulting in 
discontinuation of study drug in the MPT group.

•  Post marketing experience 
Safety  information  from  PSURs  for  Thalidomide  Pharmion  marketing  authorization  in  Australia  in 
(October 2003) and compassionate use in France was provided. Calculation of patient exposure was 
based upon data obtained through the Pharmion Risk Management Plan (PRMP) that requires patients, 
physicians, and pharmacists to be registered in order to receive the product. The number of patients 
treated  with  Thalidomide  Pharmion  50  mg  was  estimated  to  21  347  patients,  corresponding  to 
approximately 2 175 409 patient-days of exposure. The majority (> 90%) of patients were adults (age 
>  18  years)  and  most  received  thalidomide  for  multiple  myeloma  (75%)  or  other  life-threatening 
diseases. Thalidomide Laphal 50 mg or 100 mg capsule exposure is estimated at 9 213 patients. The 
mean age of patients was ≥ 52.4 years. Very few patients were < 18 years old. More than half of the 
patients had an indication of multiple myeloma. 
Published reports of adverse events in multiple myeloma involved more than 4 500 patients. The most 
common adverse events associated with thalidomide use in patients with multiple myeloma reported in 
the  literature  were  similar  to  those  reported  in  studies  IFM-99-06,  THAL-MM-003,  and  E1A00  and 
included  constipation,  sedation/somnolence,  peripheral  neuropathy,  fatigue/weakness,  rash,  and 
dizziness.  Serious  adverse  events  included  peripheral  neuropathy,  deep  vein  thrombosis  and 
pulmonary embolism, bradycardia, and severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 
toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
Publications of adverse events in other indications involve more than 3 300 patients dating back to the 
early 1980s. The adverse events reported in these studies are consistent with the known toxicity profile 
of  thalidomide.  Additional  adverse  reactions  related  to  post-marketing  experience  with  thalidomide 
and  not  seen  in  the  pivotal  study  include:  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  intestinal  obstruction, 
hypothyroidism and sexual dysfunction. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
Teratogenicity 
Thalidomide is a potent human teratogen, inducing a high frequency (about 30%) of severe and live-
threatening  birth  defects  such  as:  ectromelia  (amelia,  phocomelia,  hemimelia)  of  the  upper  and/or 
lower extremities, microtia with abnormality of the external acoustic meatus (blind or absent), middle 
and  internal  ear  lesions  (less  frequent),  ocular  lesions  (anophthalmia,  microphthalmia),  congenital 
heart  disease,  renal  abnormalities.  Other  less  frequent  abnormalities  have  also  been  described. 
Therefore,  thalidomide  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential 
unless all the conditions of the pregnancy prevention programme are met (see SPC section 4.3).  
Women of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for 4 weeks before 
therapy,  during  therapy,  and  during  4  weeks  after  thalidomide  therapy  (see  SPC  section  4.4).  If 
46/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with thalidomide, treatment  must be stopped immediately and 
the patient should be referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and 
advice. As thalidomide is found in semen, male patients must use condoms during treatment and for 
1 week  after  dose  interruption  and/or  cessation  of  treatment  when  having  sexual  intercourse  with  a 
pregnant  woman  or  with  a  woman  with  childbearing  potential  who  is  not  using  effective 
contraception. If pregnancy occurs in a partner of male patient taking thalidomide, the female partner 
should be referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. It 
is  unknown  whether  thalidomide  is  excreted  in  human  breast  milk.  Animal  studies  have  shown 
excretion  of  thalidomide  in  breast  milk.  Therefore  breast-feeding  should  be  discontinued  during 
therapy with thalidomide (see SPC section 4.6). 
For  women  of  childbearing  potential,  prescriptions  should  be  limited  to  4  weeks  of  treatment  and 
continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription 
and  dispensing  should  occur  on  the  same  day.  Dispensing  of  thalidomide  should  occur  within  a 
maximum  of  7 days  of  the  prescription.  For  all  other  patients,  prescriptions  should  be  limited  to  12 
weeks and continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. Patients should be instructed never to 
give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at 
the end of treatment. 
A  female  patient  or  a  female  partner  of  a  male  patient  is  considered  to  have  childbearing  potential 
unless she meets at least one of the following criteria: Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for 
≥ 1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential); Premature 
ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist; Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy; XY genotype, Turner’s syndrome, uterine agenesis. 
Patients should not donate blood or semen during therapy or for 1 week following discontinuation of 
thalidomide. 
Counselling 
For women of childbearing potential, thalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are 
met: 
•  She understands the teratogenic risk to the unborn child 
•  She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks before 
starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and 4 weeks after the end of 
treatment 
•  Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on 
effective contraception 
•  She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
•  She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to 
rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy 
•  She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as thalidomide is dispensed 
following a negative pregnancy test 
•  She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing every 4 weeks  
•  She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with 
the use of thalidomide. 
As thalidomide is found in semen, male patients taking thalidomide must meet the following 
conditions: 
•  Understand the teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman.  
•  Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
woman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.  
The prescriber must ensure that: 
•  The patient complies with the conditions of the pregnancy prevention programme 
•  The patient confirms that he (she) understand the aforementioned conditions. 
Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use one effective method of contraception for 4 weeks before 
therapy,  during  therapy,  and  during  4  weeks  after  thalidomide  therapy  and  even  in  case  of  dose 
47/61 
 
 
 
 
 
interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed on a monthly 
basis.  If  not  established  on  effective  contraception,  the  patient  must  be  referred  preferably  to  an 
appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can 
be initiated.  
The following can be considered to be examples of effective methods of contraception: Subcutaneous 
hormonal  implant,  levonorgestrel-releasing  intrauterine  system  (IUS),  medroxyprogesterone  acetate 
depot, tubal sterilisation, sexual intercourse with a vasectomised  male partner  only; vasectomy  must 
be  confirmed  by  two  negative  semen  analyses,  ovulation  inhibitory  progesterone-only  pills  (i.e., 
desogestrel). 
Because  of  the  increased  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  in  patients  with  multiple  myeloma, 
combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see SPC section 4.5). If a patient is currently 
using  combined  oral  contraception  the  patient  should  switch  to  one  of  the  effective  method  listed 
above.  The  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  continues  for  4−6 weeks  after  discontinuing  combined 
oral contraception.  
Pregnancy testing 
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/ml must be performed for 
women  of  childbearing  potential.  This  requirement  includes  women  of  childbearing  potential  who 
practice  absolute  and  continuous  abstinence.  A  medically  supervised  pregnancy  test  should  be 
performed during the consultation, when thalidomide is prescribed or in the 3 days prior to the visit to 
the  prescriber  once  the  patient  had  been  using  effective  contraception  for  at  least  4 weeks.  The  test 
should  ensure  the  patient  is  not  pregnant  when  she  starts  treatment  with  thalidomide.  A  medically 
supervised  pregnancy  test  should  be  repeated  every  4 weeks,  including  4 weeks  after  the  end  of 
treatment.  These  pregnancy  tests  should  be  performed  on  the  day  of  the  prescribing  visit  or  in  the 
3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. 
Educational materials 
In  order  to  assist  patients  in  avoiding  foetal  exposure  to  thalidomide  and  to  provide  additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation holder will provide educational material to 
healthcare  professionals.  The  pregnancy  prevention  programme  of  the  risk  management  plan 
reinforces  the  warnings  about  the  teratogenicity  of  thalidomide,  provides  advice  on  contraception 
before  therapy  is  started  and  provides  guidance  on  the  need  for  pregnancy  testing.  Full  patient 
information  about  the  teratogenic  risk  and  the  pregnancy  prevention  measures  as  specified  in  the 
pregnancy  prevention  programme  of  the  risk  management  plan  should  be  given  by  the  physician  to 
women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to male patients. 
The  risk  management  plan  was  considered  adequate  to  address  the  issue  of  teratogenicity  and  other 
safety concerns. 
Other thalidomide treatment related risks 
A total of patients received thalidomide in the clinical trials of this application (124 in study IFM 99-
06  in  combination  with  melphalan  and  prednisone;  234  in  study  THAL-MM-003  and  102  in  study 
E1A00 in combination with dexamethasone). The median exposure to thalidomide ranged between 10 
and 30 weeks. Post-approval safety information on thalidomide has been reported in PSURs and was 
based on an estimated exposure of about 21 000 patients. 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide in combination 
with melphalan and prednisone are: neutropenia, leukopenia, constipation, somnolence, paraesthesia, 
peripheral neuropathy, anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, dysaesthesia, tremor and 
peripheral oedema. The clinically important adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide 
in  combination  with  melphalan  and  prednisone  or  dexamethasone  include:  deep  vein  thrombosis 
(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), peripheral neuropathy, severe skin reactions including Stevens 
Johnson  syndrome  and  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  syncope,  bradycardia,  and  dizziness  (see  SPC 
sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). 
An increased risk of DVT and PE has been reported in patients treated with thalidomide (study IFM 
99-06:  12.9%  in  the  MPT  group  vs.  7.3%  in  the  MP  group;  study  THAL-MM-003:  18.8%  in 
thalidomide/dexamethasone  group  vs.  5.6%  in  placebo/dexamethasone  group).  This  risk  is  also 
48/61 
 
 
 
reported  in  literature.  The  risk  appears  to  be  greatest  during  the  first  5 months  of  therapy.  Previous 
history  of  thromboembolic  events  or  concomitant  administration  of  erythropoietic  agents  or  other 
agents  such  as  hormone  replacement  therapy,  may  also  increase  thrombotic  risk  in  these  patients. 
Therefore,  these  agents  should  be  used  with  caution  in  multiple  myeloma  patients  receiving 
thalidomide with prednisone and melphalan. Particularly, a haemoglobin concentration above 12g/dl 
should lead to discontinuation of erythropoietic agents. If the patient experiences any thromboembolic 
events, treatment must be discontinued and standard anticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient 
has  been  stabilised  on  the  anticoagulation  treatment  and  any  complications  of  the  thromboembolic 
event have been managed, the thalidomide treatment may be restarted at the original dose dependent 
upon a benefit risk assessment. The patient should continue anticoagulation therapy during the course 
of  thalidomide  treatment  (see  SPC  section  4.2).  Thromboprophylaxis  should  be  administered  for  at 
least  the  first  5 months  of  treatment  especially  in  patients  with  additional  thrombotic  risk  factors.  
Prophylactic  antithrombotic  medicinal  products,  such as  low  molecular  weight  heparins  or  warfarin, 
should be recommended. The decision to take antithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made 
after  careful  assessment  of  an  individual  patient’s  underlying  risk  factors  (see  SPC  section  4.2). 
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. 
Patients  should  be  instructed  to  seek  medical  care  if  they  develop  symptoms  such  as  shortness  of 
breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling (see SPC section 4.4). 
Multiple dose administration of 200 mg thalidomide q.d. for 4 days had no effect on the international 
normalized  ratio  (INR)  in  healthy  volunteers.  However,  due  to  the  increased  risk  of  thrombosis  in 
cancer  patients,  and  a  potentially  accelerated  metabolism  of  warfarin  with  corticosteroids,  close 
monitoring of INR values is advised during thalidomide-prednisone combination treatment as well as 
during  the  first  weeks  after  ending  these  treatments  (see  SPC  section  4.5).  Thalidomide  does  not 
interact  with  hormonal  contraceptives.  In  10  healthy  women,  the  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of 
norethindrone  and  ethinyl  estradiol  following  administration  of  a  single  dose  containing  1.0 mg  of 
norethindrone acetate and 0.75 mg of ethinyl estradiol were studied. The results were similar with and 
without  co-administration  of  thalidomide  200 mg/day  to  steady-state  levels.  However,  combined 
hormonal contraceptives are not recommended due to the increased risk of venous thrombo-embolic 
disease (see SPC section 4.5).  
Peripheral  neuropathy  is  a  very  common,  potentially  severe,  adverse  reaction  to  treatment  with 
thalidomide that may result in irreversible damage (see SPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). The percentage of 
patients with neuropathy events was 55.6% in the MPT groups vs. 4.1% in MP in study IFM 99-06, 
and  37.6%  in  the  thalidomide/dexamethasone  group  vs.  20.7%  in  placebo/dexamethasone  group  in 
study THAL-MM-003. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of 
months.  However,  reports  following  relatively  short-term  use  also  exist.  Incidence  of  neuropathy 
events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or interruption increases  with cumulative dose and 
duration of therapy. If the patient experiences peripheral neuropathy, dose and schedule modification 
should be performed as described in table 34. 
Table 34: Recommended dose modifications for Thalidomide Pharmion related neuropathy in first line 
treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Severity of neuropathy 
Grade 1 (paraesthesia, weakness and/or 
loss of reflexes) with no loss of function 
Modification of dose and regimen 
Continue to monitor the patient with clinical  
examination. Consider reducing dose by up to 50% if 
symptoms worsen. 
Reduce dose by up to 50% or interrupt treatment and 
continue to monitor the patient with clinical and 
neurological examination. If no improvement or continued 
worsening of the neuropathy, discontinue treatment. If the 
neuropathy resolves to Grade 1 or better, the treatment 
may be restarted at 50% of the last dose, if the benefit/risk 
is favourable.   
Discontinue treatment  
Grade 2 (interfering with function but 
not with activities of daily living) 
Grade 3 (interfering with activities of 
daily living) 
Grade 4 (neuropathy which is disabling)  Discontinue treatment

Paresthesia  was  reported  in  study  IFM  99-06,  with  an  incidence  of  18.5%  of  patients  in  the  MPT 
group  compared  with  2.1%  in  the  MP  group.  Peripheral  neuropathy  (MPT:  16.9%  vs.  MP:  0), 
dysaesthesia (MPT: 12.1% vs. MP: 0.5%), and neuropathy (MPT: 12.1% vs. MP: 0) were all events 
that were also reported in >10% of patients in the thalidomide treatment group. Careful monitoring of 
patients  for  symptoms  including  paraesthesia,  dysaesthesia,  discomfort,  abnormal  co-ordination  or 
weakness  is  recommended  (see  SPC  section  4.4).  It  is  recommended  that  clinical  and  neurological 
examinations  are  performed  in  patients  prior  to  starting  thalidomide  therapy,  and  that  routine 
monitoring is carried out regularly during treatment. Medicinal products known to be associated with 
neuropathy  (e.g.  vincristine  and  bortezomib)  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  receiving 
thalidomide  (see  SPC  section  4.5).  Thalidomide  may  also  potentially  aggravate  existing  neuropathy 
and should therefore not be used in patients with clinical signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy 
unless the clinical benefits outweigh the risks.  
Cardiac  events  were  higher  in  patients  taking  thalidomide  (study  IFM  99-06  MPT:  12.1%  vs.  MP: 
5.7%;  study  THAL-MM-003:  38.0%  in  thalidomide/dexamethasone  group  vs.  25.9%).  In  these 
patients,  the  most  frequent  cardiac  events  were  hypotension,  bradyarrhythmia,  bradycardia,  sinus 
bradycardia,  myocardial  ischemia,  and  atrial  fibrillation.  In  literature,  sinus  bradycardia,  sometimes 
associated  with  syncopal  episodes  has  been  reported  in  multiple  myeloma  patients.  Due  to  the 
potential for thalidomide to induce bradycardia, caution should be exercised with medicinal products 
having  the  same  pharmacodynamic  effect  such  as  drugs  known  to  induce  torsade  de  pointes,  beta 
blockers or anticholinesterase agents (see SPC section 4.5). 
Treatment  recommendations  for  thalidomide-associated  haematologic  toxicities  are  limited.  When 
thalidomide  is  used  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  granulocyte  colony  stimulating  factor 
(G-CSF)  has  been  used  to  allow  continued  administration  of  the  chemotherapy  on  schedule  and  to 
limit  the  number  of  neutropenic  days.  Adverse  reactions  for  thalidomide  related  haematological 
disorders compared to the comparator arm are provided in section 4.8 of the SPC, as the comparator 
has a significant effect on these disorders. 
In  the  clinical  trials,  skin  eruption  and  rash  were  commonly  reported.  Moribilliform,  seborrhoea, 
maculopapular, or non-specific dermatitis were also described in the literature. Severe adverse events 
such  as  exfoliative  erythroderma,  erythema  multiforme  and  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  (TEN),  were 
reported and generally occurred when thalidomide was given in combination with dexamethasone. If 
at anytime the patient experiences a toxic skin reaction e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, the treatment 
should be discontinued permanently.  
Thalidomide has sedative properties thus may enhance the sedation induced by anxiolytics, hypnotics, 
antipsychotics,  H1  anti-histamines,  opiate  derivatives,  barbiturates  and  alcohol.  Caution  should  be 
used  when  thalidomide  is  given  in  combination  with  medicinal  products  that  cause  drowsiness  (see 
SPC  section  4.5).  The  medicinal  product  should  be  taken  as  a  single  dose  at  bedtime,  to  reduce  the 
impact of somnolence. In addition, patients should be instructed to avoid situations where somnolence 
may be a problem and to seek medical advice before taking other medicinal products known to cause 
somnolence. They should be advised as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of hazardous tasks (see SPC section 4.7). Patients should be monitored 
and dose reduction may be required. 
No  specific  dose  adjustments  are  recommended  for  the  elderly.  Thalidomide  has  not  formally  been 
studied  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  function.  No  specific  dose  recommendations  for 
these  patient  populations  are  available.  Patients  with  severe  organ  impairment  should  be  carefully 
monitored for adverse effects. Thalidomide is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of 
age as safety and efficacy have not been established.  
Patients  with  hypersensitivity  to  thalidomide  or  to  any  of  the  excipients  of  Thalidomide  Pharmion 
should  not  take  this  medicinal  product.  In  addition,  the  capsules  of  Thalidomide  Pharmion  contain 
lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The  pharmacological  mechanisms  of  thalidomide  and  the  spectrum  of  its  activity  is  not  fully 
characterised. Thalidomide shows immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory and potential anti-neoplastic 
activities.  Data  from  in  vitro  studies  and  clinical  trials  suggest  that  the  immunomodulatory,  anti-
inflammatory  and  anti-neoplastic  effects  of  thalidomide  may  be  related  to  suppression  of  excessive 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production, down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion 
molecules  involved  in  leukocyte  migration  and  anti-angiogenic  activity.  Although  a  variety  of 
mechanisms of action have been elucidated, it remains unclear which one or more of these play a role 
in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Thalidomide is a proven teratogen in humans. Animal studies 
have  demonstrated  differences  in  species  susceptibility  to  the  teratogenic  effects  of  thalidomide.  No 
mutagenic or genotoxic effect has been revealed when thalidomide was assayed in a standard battery 
of genotoxicity tests. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed at exposures approximately 15, 13 
and  39  times  the  estimated  clinical  AUC  at  the  recommended  starting  dose  in  mice,  male  rats  and 
female rats respectively. 
Efficacy 
Results from IFM 99-06, a phase III, randomised, open label, parallel group, multicentre study have 
demonstrated  a  survival  advantage  when  thalidomide  is  used  in  combination  with  melphalan  and 
prednisone for 12 cycles of 6 weeks in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. 
In this study the age range of patients was 65-75 years, with 41% (183/447) of patients 70 years old or 
older.  The  median  dose  of  thalidomide  was  217 mg  and  >40%  of  patients  received  9 cycles. 
Melphalan and prednisone were dosed at 0.25 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day respectively on days 1 to 4 
of each 6 weeks cycle.  
Further to the per protocol analysis where a 21.4 month survival advantage (OS) over MP was noted 
with the MPT combination (hazard ratio=0.56, p=0.001), an update was conducted for the IFM 99-06 
study providing an additional 15 months follow-up data. The median OS was 51.6 ± 4.5 and 33.2 ± 
3.2 months  in  the  MPT  and  MP  groups,  respectively  (97.5%  CI  0.42  to  0.84).  This  18.4  month 
difference was statistically significant with a hazard ratio of reduction of risk of death in the MPT arm 
of 0.59 (p-value  <0.001) and was consistent with the assumption made in the statistical analysis plan. 
The  superiority  of  MPT  over  MP  was  confirmed  by  prolonging progression  free  survival  (PFS)  and 
higher  rates  of  response  (including  partial  response,  very  good  partial  response,  and  complete 
response). The primary endpoint OS was not affected by treatment after progression (mainly VAD or 
alkylating agent-based regimens). 
Safety 
In three phase III randomised controlled trials, 124 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to 
the  melphalan/prednisone  and  thalidomide  combination,  and  336  to  the  thalidomide/dexamethasone 
combination.  The  median  exposure  to  thalidomide  ranged  between  10  and  44  weeks.  Post-approval 
safety information on thalidomide was provided from periodic safety update reports and based on an 
estimated exposure of about 21 000 patients. 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide are peripheral 
neuropathy,  somnolence,  paraesthesia,  dizziness,  dysaesthesia,  tremor,  neutropenia,  leukopenia, 
anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral oedema and constipation. 
The clinically important adverse reactions associated with the use of thalidomide deep vein thrombosis 
and  pulmonary  embolism,  peripheral  neuropathy,  severe  skin  reactions  including  Stevens  Johnson 
Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, syncope, bradycardia, and dizziness. 
Thalidomide is a potent human teratogen, inducing a high frequency (about 30%) of severe and live-
threatening  birth  defects.  Thalidomide  must  never  be  used  by  women  who  are  pregnant  or  could 
become  pregnant.  Conditions  for  the  safe  use  of  thalidomide  are  stated  in  the  pregnancy  prevention 
programme  of  the  risk  management  plan  and  must  be  fulfilled  for  all  male  and  female  patients.  In 
addition  to  the  information  included  in  the  product  information,  risk  minimisation  activities  include 
prescribing  and  dispensing  restrictions,  educational  materials,  continuous  education  and  direct 
communication to health care professional prior to launch.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics.  Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in 
the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 
adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
In accordance with Article 78 (1) and 78 (2) in Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the EMEA 
and the CHMP have consulted both victims of thalidomide groups and patients’ organisations, during 
the procedure for the assessment of the MAA. This consultation consisted of the involvement of two 
experts appointed by the relevant victim’s and patient’s organisations acting as individual experts, and 
the involvement of patients and victims acting as representatives of their organisations, based on the 
agreement  of  the  applicant  to  disclose  relevant  confidential  data,  namely  the  package  leaflet,  the 
labelling and the risk management plan. In addition, readability tests were conducted by the applicant 
(including  worst  case  scenario,  i.e.  3  languages,  multiple  language  leaflet)  and  passed  user  testing. 
Following the feedback of the CHMP and the EMEA quality review group, the layout of the leaflet 
was  revised  by  the  applicant  to  ensure  readability  whilst  conforming  to  guidelines  and  paper  size 
constraints.  The  applicant  will  investigate  the  utility  of  the  landscape  format  for  the  three  language 
leaflet  whilst  ensuring  readability  is  not  affected.  The  applicant  confirmed  that  there  will  be  a 
maximum of three languages on any insert as more than three would affect the readability. Multiple 
language  inserts  will  only  be  used  where  a  multi  language  package  is  assigned.  When  a  multiple 
language leaflet is used, the list of local representatives is presented in normal text and mentioned only 
once. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
In  a  phase  III,  randomised,  open  label,  parallel  group,  multicentre  study  (IFM  99-06),  the  clinical 
efficacy of thalidomide, in combination with melphalan and prednisone (MPT), has been demonstrated 
in terms of overall survival in patients with untreated multiple myeloma, ≥ 65 years or ineligible for 
high-dose  chemotherapy,  as  compared  to  melphalan  and  prednisone  (MP)  alone.  The  18-month 
increase in median survival and a hazard ratio of reduction of risk of death of 0.59 (p<0.001) for MPT 
over MP is considered the most important clinical benefit for patients with multiple myleoma since the 
MP treatment was established. 
Most patients taking thalidomide in combination with  melphalan and prednisone can be  expected to 
experience adverse reactions such as neutropenia, leukopenia, constipation, somnolence, paraesthesia, 
peripheral neuropathy, anaemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, dysaesthesia, tremor and 
peripheral  oedema.  Management  and  dosage  recommendations  for  patients  experiencing  important 
adverse  reactions  such  as  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism,  peripheral  neuropathy, 
severe  skin  reactions  including  Stevens  Johnson  syndrome  and  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  syncope, 
bradycardia, and dizziness are provided in the summary of product characteristics. 
Thalidomide  is  a  potent  human  teratogen,  inducing  a  high  frequency  of  severe  and  live-threatening 
birth  defects.  A  risk  management  plan  was  submitted.  Thalidomide  is  contraindicated  during 
pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential unless  all  the  conditions  of  the  risk  management 
plan  are  met.  The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that 
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns. The following additional risk minimisation activities 
were required: 
- Dear Healthcare Professional Letter to be sent at the time of the launch with the following message: 
core text as agreed by the CHMP 
• 
•  national specific requirements agreed with the National Competent Authority regarding: 
o  Distribution of the product 
o  procedures to ensure that all appropriate measures have been performed prior to 
thalidomide being dispensed 
- Educational Healthcare Professional’s materials, containing the following elements: 
57/61 
 
 
 
 
•  Healthcare Professional Booklet, including information on history of thalidomide; Posology; 
Prescription restrictions; Teratogenicity and the need to avoid foetal exposure; Obligations of 
healthcare professionals who intend to prescribe or dispense thalidomide (including the need 
to provide comprehensive advice and counselling to patients; that patients should be capable 
of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  safe  use  of  thalidomide;  the  need  to  provide 
patients  with  the  appropriate  patient  educational  material;  reporting  of  any  pregnancy, 
neuropathy  or  other  AE  (if  applicable  to  a  Member  State)  using  the  forms  provided  in  the 
“Educational Healthcare Professional’s Kit”; Safety advice relevant to all patients (including a 
description  and  management  of  thromboembolic  and  cardiovascular  events,  peripheral 
neuropathy; disposal of unwanted medicine; not to donate blood during treatment and for one 
week  after  treatment  ends);  Algorithm  for  pregnancy  prevention  plan  implementation; 
Pregnancy Prevention Programme information (definition of women of childbearing potential 
(WCBP)  and  actions  the  physician  should  take  if  unsure;  information  on  what  is  effective 
contraception; safety advice for WCPB and for men), pregnancy reporting requirements.  
•  Pregnancy initial and outcome reporting forms, 
•  Neuropathy and adverse reaction reporting forms,  
•  Treatment Initiation Forms for female patient of childbearing potential, female patient of non-
childbearing potential and for male patient 
 Patient cards and/or equivalent tools including: 
•  verification that appropriate counselling has taken place 
•  documentation of childbearing status potential 
• 
check  box  (or  similar)  which  physician  ticks  to  confirm  that  patient  is  using  effective 
contraception (if female with childbearing potential) 
•  verification  of  initial  negative  pregnancy  test  prior  to  start  of  treatment  (if  female  with 
childbearing potential) 
•  pregnancy test dates and results 
-  Educational  patient  booklets  for  female  patient  of  childbearing  potential,  female  patient  of  non-
childbearing  potential  and  for  male  patient,  should  contain  the  information  that  thalidomide  is 
teratogenic,  that  it  may  cause  thromboembolism,  cardiovascular  events  and  neuropathy,  that  it  must 
not be given to any other person, that the patient should not donate blood, that the patient should tell 
their doctor about any adverse events, that any unused capsules should be returned to the pharmacist at 
the  end  of  the  treatment,  and  would  include  a  description  of  the  patient  card  and  its  use  in  the 
individual Member State and national or other applicable specific arrangements for a prescription for 
thalidomide to be dispensed.  
The booklet for female patient of childbearing potential should also include information on the need to 
avoid foetal exposure, confirmation of pregnancy prevention method used, that if she needs to change 
or  stop  using  her  method  of  contraception  she  should  inform:  the  physician  prescribing  her 
contraception  that  she  is  on  thalidomide  and  the  physician  prescribing  thalidomide  that  she  has 
stopped  or  changed  her  method  of  contraception,  the  need  for  pregnancy  test  dates  and  results  i.e. 
before  treatment,  every  4  weeks  during  treatment  and  after  treatment,  the  need  to  stop  Thalidomide 
Pharmion  immediately  upon  suspicion  of  pregnancy,  the  need  to  contact  their  doctor  immediately 
upon suspicion of pregnancy. 
The booklet for  male patients should also include information on the need to avoid foetal  exposure, 
that thalidomide is found in semen and the need to use condoms if sexual partner is pregnant or is a 
women with childbearing potential not on effective contraception, that if his partner becomes pregnant 
he should inform his treating doctor immediately and always use a condom, that he should not donate 
semen. 
- Prescription and dispensing restrictions: 
The Member States shall put into place measures to ensure that the maximum treatment duration for 
one  prescription  shall  be  4  weeks  for  women  with  childbearing  potential,  12  weeks  for  men  and 
women without childbearing potential. Prescriptions can only be dispensed within 7 days of the date of 
the prescription

Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The applicant has claimed that Thalidomide Pharmion, at the time of submission of the application, is 
not  similar  to  any  of  the  authorised  orphan  medicinal  products  (as  defined  in Art.  3  of  Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000) for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication. 
The  Applicant  has  provided  a  report  discussing  the  issue  of  similarity  in  regard  to  the  authorised 
orphan  medicinal  product  Revlimid  (lenalidomide).  In  this  report,  the  Applicant  concluded  on  non-
similarity with particular reference to the therapeutic indication.  
The  CHMP  concluded  that,  having  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the  applicant,  the 
Rapporteurs  assessment  and  the  conclusions  of  the  Quality  Working  Party,  Thalidomide  Pharmion 
was similar, in terms of molecular structure (as defined in Art. 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/  2000)  to  the  orphan  medicinal  product  Revlimid  authorised  for  a  condition  relating  to  the 
proposed  therapeutic  indication.  However,  Thalidomide  Pharmion  and  Revlimid  did  not  share  the 
same therapeutic indication, according to article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000. 
Therefore, CHMP is of the opinion that thalidomide is not similar to any authorised orphan medicinal 
products within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200 (See Appendix 
1). 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consenus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Thalidomide Pharmion in the treatment of  
Thalidomide Pharmion in combination with melphalan and prednisone as first line treatment of 
patients with untreated multiple myeloma, aged ≥ 65 years or ineligible for high dose chemotherapy. 
Thalidomide Pharmion is prescribed and dispensed according to the Thalidomide Pharmion Pregnancy 
Prevention Programme (see section 4.4). 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation. 
And 
 In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers 
Thalidomide Pharmion  not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 
847/2000) to Revlimid for the same therapeutic indication.

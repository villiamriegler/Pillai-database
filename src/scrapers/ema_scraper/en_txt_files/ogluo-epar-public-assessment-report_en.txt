2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication is for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children 
aged 2 years and over with diabetes mellitus. 
One of the main complications of diabetes treatment with insulin is the emergence of hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia in diabetes is defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as “all episodes of 
abnormally low plasma glucose concentration that expose the individual to potential harm” [ADA].  
The ADA Workgroup recommends that patients with drug-treated diabetes (insulin secretagogue or insulin) 
become concerned about developing hypoglycaemia at a plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 
mmol/L) [ADA]. A blood concentration <54 mg/dL is the threshold at which neuroglycopenic symptoms begin 
to occur and requires immediate action to resolve the hypoglycaemic event (Level 2 hypoglycaemia). Level 3 
hypoglycaemia is a severe event characterised by altered mental and/or physical functioning that requires 
assistance from another person for recovery. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 10/114 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Therapy with insulin causes hypoglycaemia during the course of established T1D, and progressively more 
frequently over time in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The U.K. Hypoglycaemia Study Group reported an 
incidence of 110 severe hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient-years in patients with T1D treated with 
insulin for < 5 years, and an incidence of 320 episodes per 100 patient-years in those with T1D treated for > 
15 years [U.K. Hypoglycaemia Study Group]. Type 1 diabetics suffer an average of two symptomatic 
hypoglycaemic events per week, and a severe, temporarily disabling event approximately once a year 
[McLeod]. Insulin-using T2D patients typically have several hypoglycaemic episodes in a given year, one to 
two of these being severe episodes. There are currently approximately 1.4 million T1D patients and 3.8 
million insulin-using T2D patients in the United States (US), as reported by the US Center for Disease Control 
[CDC]. On average, the total insulin-using patient population experiences about 3 million severe 
hypoglycaemic events per year. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Hypoglycaemia presents as diaphoresis, pallor, nausea, palpitations, tremors, and anxiety. If hypoglycaemia 
becomes severe, symptoms may then include confusion, abnormal behaviour, blurred vision, psychomotor 
abnormalities, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma [DCCT/EDIC Study Research Group]. 
2.1.4.  Management 
The ADA recommends that all insulin- and sulfonylurea-using diabetics carry glucagon emergency kits (GEKs) 
and use glucagon as first line therapy in the event of a severe hypoglycaemic event [ADA]. The current 
standard of care for severe hypoglycaemia is an injection of glucagon. Administration of glucagon with 
current products (i.e. Lilly Glucagon for Injection, and Novo GlucaGen) is a 9-step process including assembly 
of the kit, aqueous reconstitution of the powdered glucagon, and manual administration of the dose 
[Glucagon, Novo GlucaGen]. 
About the product 
Ogluo is a sterile, subcutaneous, injectable, non-aqueous formulation of glucagon. The Ogluo pre-filled 
syringe (PFS) container consists of a 1.0 mL long cyclic olefin polymer syringe with ETFE laminated plunger 
(plunger stopper) filled with Ogluo glucagon formulation.  
The 1 mg PFS is targeted to deliver at least 0.2 mL of glucagon injection, containing 1 mg glucagon. The 0.5 
mg PFS is targeted to deliver at least 0.1 mL of formulation, containing 0.5 mg glucagon. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme of Ogluo included 7 clinical trials involving 62 healthy subjects in one 
phase 1 study (Study XSGP-101), and 300 adult and 31 paediatric subjects with T1D in two Phase 2 studies 
(Study XSGP-201 and Study XSGP-202) and four Phase 3 studies (XSGP-301, XSGP-303, and XSGP-304 in 
adults and the open-label study XSGP-302 in paediatric subjects 2-18 years old). 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 11/114 
 
 
 
 
In addition, 7 human factors (HF) studies were sponsored by the applicant which were designed to mimic 
real-life emergency situations, and tested a total of 5 user groups that included first responders, trained and 
untrained users, adults and paediatric caregivers of people with diabetes. 
The global clinical development programme for Ogluo was officially initiated in the United Stated in 2013 with 
dosing of the first subject in Study XSGP-201. EMA Scientific Advice (SA) was received with regards to the 
design of study XSGP-304. The FDA approved Ogluo on 10 Sep 2019 for the treatment of severe 
hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe or a pre-filled pen 
containing 1 or 0.5 mg of glucagon as active substance.

spectrometry (ESI-MS), electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry-collision activated dissociation-mass 
spectrometry (ESI-MS-CAD-MS) and circular dichroism (UV CD). The solid state properties of the active 
substance were measured by dynamic vapour sorption (DVS), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), raman 
spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
The active substance is a very hygroscopic, amorphous white powder, freely soluble in ammonium hydroxide 
and very slightly soluble in water.  
All optically active amino acids are in L-configuration, the glycine residue is achiral.  The contents of the D-
isomers of amino acids have been determined in three commercial batches of glucagon by a GC-MS technique 
upon hydrolysis of the active substance with hydrochloric acid.  
The active substance is an amorphous powder, no crystalline or polymorphic forms have been identified to date. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at one manufacturing site. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The active substance is packaged in wide-neck bottles made of amber glass (hydrolytic type III soda-lime-silica 
glass) which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), appearance of solution (visual), 
identification (HPLC, amino acid analysis, MS), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF), 
acetic acid content (IC), ammonium content (IC), chloride content (potentiometric titration), residual organic 
solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limit test (TAMC, TYMC, Ph. Eur.).  
The applicant has provided a justification for all the tests and acceptance criteria in the specifications based 
on the relevant compendial and regulatory requirements. The specification was developed by following the 
recommendations of the ICH guidelines Q3C, Q6A, M7, the Ph. Eur. general monograph, the glucagon Ph. 
Eur. monograph and the glucagon USP monograph and it is considered appropriate. 
Both individual and total related substances are controlled. The acceptance criteria are appropriate.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and identification testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data from 5 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 5 commercial batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (-20°C and 5°C) and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, purity and related substances (total and 
individual), chloride content, ammonium content and water content. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within their specified limits after 60 months’ storage at -20°C and 5°C, and during 
6 months’ storage at 25°C/60% RH.  Significant degradation of glucagon, a significant increase in related 
substances and a significant decrease in corrected assay value were observed during storage at the 
accelerated storage condition of 40°C/75% RH. 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. It has been shown that the 
active substance is sensitive towards irradiation with a dose of 1.2 Million lux hours (Mlxh) and is highly 
sensitive towards irradiation with a dose of 6 Mlxh. 
Studies under stressed conditions to evaluate the influence of temperature and moisture in the solid state, 
forced decomposition studies, and hygroscopicity studies were also conducted on one batch.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored in a freezer (< -
15°C) in the original container in order to protect from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile, subcutaneous, injectable, non-aqueous liquid formulation of glucagon. The 
finished product contains glucagon at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The product is available in two strengths: 
1 mg and 0.5 mg. 
Other ingredients are trehalose dihydrate, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfuric acid, and water for injections. 
The finished product will be offered in two presentations, a pre-filled pen with an auto-injector (Configuration 
A) and a pre-filled syringe (PFS) (Configuration B). The pre-filled syringe container is common to both 
presentations. The PFS container consists of a 1.0 mL long cyclic olefin polymer syringe with ETFE laminated 
plunger (plunger stopper).  
This is a hybrid medicinal product for which the reference product is GlucaGen / GlucaGen HypoKit 1 mg 
powder and solution for injection authorised the 25th October 1962 by Novo Norkisk A/S.

During the assessment, the CHMP requested analytical comparability data to support a hybrid application, 
which included analytical comparability data from a satisfactory number of finished product batches of Ogluo 
and the reference product, a risk-based evaluation of these data, and discussion regarding the similarities 
and differences between the properties of synthetic glucagon used in Ogluo and the recombinantly 
manufactured active substance used in the reference product as a major objection. In support of this Article 
10(3) application, the applicant provided an analytical comparability review, including data on the level of 
glucagon active substance and on the finished product level, i.e. several batches of both Ogluo and the 
reference product GlucaGen, tested at various stages of shelf-life. On the active substance level, synthetic 
glucagon was compared to recombinantly produced glucagon contained in the Chemical Reference Standard 
(CRS). The finished products Ogluo and the reference product were analysed with respect to content, purity, 
and impurities and the results evaluated. Test and reference product significantly differ regarding the 
impurity profile. This is expected due to the different finished product composition. The glucagon assay 
results for GlucaGen expressed as % label claim were higher than the results for Ogluo. However, a possible 
connection between quality (declining amounts of glucagon in Ogluo during storage) and clinical response (in 
terms of time to recovery) could be excluded based on the quality and clinical data provided. Thus, the 
differences in % label claim between Ogluo and its reference product GlucaGen at the end of shelf-life was 
deemed acceptable. 
Ogluo was developed as a ready-to-use formulation intended for subcutaneous injection. As glucagon is 
prone to degradation in aqueous solutions, the applicant selected a (nearly) water-free formulation with 
DMSO as a solvent.  
The finished product has been developed to have the following advantages over existing glucagon rescue 
therapies: ready-to-use (RTU) glucagon treatment with no mixing or manual reconstitution required, precise, 
reliable, and rapid full-dosing of glucagon, reducing the risk of a partial or failed dose delivery, and room 
temperature stable, requiring no refrigeration, for convenience and portability. Ogluo addresses the current 
unmet medical need for a simple and ready-to-use glucagon preparation. It provides a reliable alternative to 
the existing glucagon powder kits approved for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. 
For the development of finished product, the physical properties of the active substance, such as particle size 
and solid-state form, have no impact on the finished product processability or performance and as such are 
not considered key attributes in accordance with relevant ICH Q6A decision trees. 
Compatibility of the glucagon with the excipients and DMSO in the finished product formulation has been 
confirmed by the stability of the finished product at the proposed commercial storage condition of 25°C.  
The excipients used in the formulation are trehalose dihydrate as stabiliser, DMSO as diluent, and sulfuric 
acid as ionisation control. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Glucagon is known to be prone to aggregate and fibril formation. Aggregate formation in a non-aqueous 
solvent is not per se excluded because glucagon may not adopt its native conformation. Therefore, positive 
and negative glucagon fibril control samples have been produced. These control samples were used to 
demonstrate that the EP 2.2.1 Clarity method and ThT Fluorescence can detect samples containing glucagon 
fibrils. The finished product was stressed under two different conditions designed to exceed worst-case real-
world patient handing. Evaluation by EP2.2.1 Clarity and ThT Fluorescence confirmed that no glucagon 
fibrillation was present. Based on these results it can be concluded that the finished product is not sensitive 
to aggregation and is not prone to glucagon fibril formation.

Two design of experiments (DoE) studies were conducted in order to confirm the robustness of the proposed 
formulation. The first study evaluated the variation of amounts of each component formulation. The target 
formulation is robust, and no significant trends were observed in the study. The second study evaluated the 
impact of the content of a specific ion in the glucagon active substance on the quality attributes of the final 
formulation. The results of this study demonstrate that the glucagon final formulation quality is not affected 
at the ion content levels controlled for in the Ogluo formulation. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product has been developed using Quality by Design principles 
described in ICH Q8 although no design spaces are claimed.  
A quality target product profile (QTPP) was developed and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the final 
product include appearance (solution), glucagon assay, degradation products, water content, deliverable 
volume, particulate matter, sterility, endotoxins, and container closure integrity, which are relevant for both 
configurations. Additional CQAs specific to Configuration A (auto-injector) include injection depth, injection 
time, activation force, cap removal force, and deliverable volume. No additional CQAs for Configuration B 
were determined. CQAs are continually monitored to ensure final product outputs remain within acceptable 
quality limits. Risk assessments were performed throughout the process design stage based on empirical 
evidence and scientific knowledge to evaluate the impact of material attributes and process parameters on 
CQAs. High risk attributes and parameters were identified for further study or evaluation until the risk was 
reduced as low as possible and the proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were identified for each attribute or 
parameter, where applicable. 
The manufacturing process is a stepwise operation consisting of 5 unit operations, compounding, sterilizing 
filtration, aseptic filling, assembly and final packaging.  
Sterile filtration and aseptic processing have been implemented and validated to manufacture the finished 
product. The choice of the sterilisation method is considered sufficiently justified in accordance with the 
relevant sterilisation guideline (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) decision tree.  
The primary container closure system is a pre-filled syringe (PFS) with a staked stainless-steel needle, COP 
syringe barrel, and ETFE laminated plunger stopper (piston). The finished product is offered in two 
presentations, a pre-filled syringe with an auto-injector (Configuration A) and a pre-filled syringe with an 
attached manual plunger rod and backstop (Configuration B). The PFS (primary closure system) is identical 
for both, with the exception of a rigid outer (non-drug product contacting) needle shield on Configuration B. 
The Configuration A and B have overall been adequately developed and tested according to relevant ISO 
norms, using the finished product solution, and their suitability has been demonstrated. 
For both Configurations A and B, aging studies at 40°C/ 75% RH were performed to demonstrate that 
functionality of the devices is maintained over the intended shelf-life of 2 years at room temperature. The 
auto-injector contains a power pack with a complex mechanism. This essential mechanism needs to function 
properly in an emergency situation for which the drug is intended. The components will be stored before use 
in manufacture of the finished product.  
Extractables testing was performed on the primary packaging components followed by a comprehensive 
leachable study which has been completed on the primary container system. In that study, analytical 
evaluation threshold (AET) calculations were provided that demonstrate suitably low and non-toxic levels of 
all leachables from the primary container system over the shelf-life of the product.

Biocompatibility testing was performed in both configurations. The recommended biocompatibility testing 
includes cytotoxicity, sensitisation, and irritation or intracutaneous reactivity. Testing was performed on final, 
finished devices under compliance to the GLP regulation. All tests passed. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps: compounding, sterilizing filtration and aseptic filling. The 
process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Process performance qualification (PPQ) according to the master validation plan has been completed. Three 
PPQ campaigns were performed at scale, delivering 7 batches of finished product. The manufacturing PPQ has 
demonstrated that commercial batches will be consistently produced to meet the final release specifications. 
During the evaluation, the CHMP requested the validation results of pen assembly which was not covered by 
the PPQ campaigns as a major objection. The requested data was provided demonstrating that the pen 
assembly step has been successfully validated. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance  (visual),  colour  (Ph.  Eur.),  clarity  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (HPLC  retention  time,  molecular  weight), 
assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), subvisible particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), 
endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (dye ingress method), extractable volume 
(Ph. Eur.), break-loose force (Instron force tester), and glide force (Instron force tester).  
During the evaluation, the CHMP insisted that in order to accept the proposed specification limits for assay 
and impurities, unequivocal evidence needed to be provided that the variability observed in the clinical study 
batches was not related to a variable or decreasing finished product quality throughout shelf-life. This was 
raised as a major objection. The applicant argued that the finished product is not sensitive to aggregation 
and is not prone to glucagon fibril formation However, the specification was revised. This was considered 
acceptable based on data provided showing that the lower amount of glucagon is not related to clinical effect 
(time to recovery). 
No residual solvent testing is proposed for the release of the finished product. Solvents which would be 
considered impurities are controlled by the active substance and excipient specifications. There are no 
organic solvents used in the manufacturing of the finished product, other than DMSO, which is included as 
the formulation vehicle. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The data obtained after 6 
months of storage at 40°C/75% RH have demonstrated that elemental impurities are not present at levels 
exceeding the permitted daily exposure reported in the ICH Q3D. Therefore, no elemental impurities testing 
is proposed before release of the commercial finished product. 
The CHMP requested the submission of a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities as 
a major objection. This information was provided applying the principles outlined in the notice “Information 
on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders (EMA/409815/2020)”. No risk was identified.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 6 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 6 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 30 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability studies were performed on pre-filled syringes (PFS) in the primary container/closure system. The PFS 
batches for primary registration stability are representative of the intended commercial product and process. 
These PFSs are packaged in pouches consistent with the intended commercial packaging for Configuration A 
and  Configuration  B.  The  pouched  PFSs  are  stored  horizontally  in  the  stability  chambers.  The  auto-injector 
assembly, and the manual plunger and backstop were not included in the stability assessments as they are not 
in contact with the formulation during storage. The stability data from the PFSs support the registration for 
both Configuration A and Configuration B. Device Reliability Testing for both configurations stored in pouches 
was satisfactory. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradants,  water  content,  particulate  matter,  endotoxins  and 
container closure integrity (CCI). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Under long term, intermediate and accelerated conditions, all stability-indicating attributes remained well within 
the proposed commercial specifications throughout the study durations. 
A freeze-thaw study of 4 batches with three rounds of temperature cycling from -20°C to 40°C (48 hours each) 
was conducted. No changes to appearance were observed and the minor changes to assay and degradation 
products were within specification. This study demonstrates that product quality will not be adversely affected 
by potential temperature excursions during shipping or storage. 
In addition, 2 batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The PFS with and without the protective pouches was evaluated. The glucagon 
in PFS exposed to the severe conditions of the ICH study was significantly degraded, indicating that protection 
from light during long term storage is warranted. The assay and total degradants observed for pouched control 
PFS demonstrate that the pouch provides adequate protection from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with the following instructions “do not 
store above 25°C, do not refrigerate or freeze, do not store below 15°C, store in original sealed foil pouch 
until time of use in order to protect from light and moisture” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Ogluo was developed as a ready-to-use formulation intended for subcutaneous injection. As glucagon is 
prone to degradation in aqueous solutions, a (nearly) water-free formulation was selected with DMSO as a 
solvent. Ogluo is offered in two configurations sharing a pre-filled plastic syringe as primary container with a 
staked needle and elastomeric needle shield and a laminated rubber piston. The PFS is integrated in an auto-
injector for Configuration A, and equipped with a plunger rod with backstop and an additional rigid needle 
shield for Configuration B.  
Information on development, manufacture, and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Xeris has developed a biocompatible, non-aqueous peptide/protein reformulation technology (XerisolTM) that 
allows the manufacture of concentrated, low volume, stable peptide formulations which can be pre-mixed and 
pre-loaded into a pre-filled syringe. Xeris has applied this technology to develop a stable, sterile, non-aqueous 
liquid formulation for the subcutaneous (SC) injection of glucagon, for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia 
in patients with Type 1 diabetes or insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes (Ogluo [glucagon injection]). 
To  support  this  submission,  Xeris  has  conducted  6  nonclinical  studies  with  the  Xeris  glucagon  formulation 
(hereafter Xeris glucagon) administered SC; 4 studies in Sprague-Dawley rats, 1 study in New Zealand White 
rabbits, and 1 study in Yorkshire pigs.  
In  several  instances,  these  studies  had  multiple  endpoints  which  included  a  comparison  of  the 
pharmacodynamics  (PD),  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  and/or  toxicity  of  the  Xeris  glucagon  formulation  to  the 
marketed  human  recombinant glucagon  products  Glucagon  for  Injection  and GlucaGen  (Eli Lilly  2018, Novo 
Nordisk 2015). The studies were designed to demonstrate the safety of the Xeris glucagon vehicle and glucagon 
aqueous  formulation  and  to  assess  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and/or  glucose  lowering  effects  of  Xeris

glucagon. The pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat and the rabbit local tolerance study were conducted 
in compliance with the GLP regulations. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics of Xeris glucagon on blood glucose was assessed in vivo in 2 PK/PD studies; 
1  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (Report  CB12-5015-R-TX)  and  1  in  Yorkshire  pigs  (Report  PKPD13-GPO-06).  In 
addition, an assessment of Xeris glucagon PD was included in a 2-week GLP rat toxicity study (Report XSGPE-
TX02).  In  each  of  these  studies,  a  marketed,  recombinant  glucagon  injection  drug  product  was  used  as  a 
comparator  to  Xeris  glucagon.  The  rat  studies  used  the  Eli  Lilly  glucagon  formulation  and  Novo  Nordisk 
GlucaGen drug product was used as a comparator in the pig study.  
In rats, statistical data performed from 0 to 60 min showed that at clinically relevant doses (based on body 
weight;  0.016  mg/kg),  Xeris  glucagon  SC  injection  rose  glucose  levels  that  is  comparable  to  the  marketed 
glucagon (Eli Lilly). Although, a trend toward a decrease in blood glucose concentrations can be seen in female 
rats,  statistics  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  gender-related  differences.  This  was  confirmed  in  a  second  rat 
study. However, there is a statistically significant difference at shorter times, 5- and 10-minutes post-dosing 
respectively, which indicate that for the clinical intended dose (1 mg) the Eli Lilly glucagon acts faster and more 
efficiently than Ogluo (Figures 2 and 3). This was considered a concern for an emergency drug.  
Figure 2: Blood Glucose Time Course, Phase-II Males (Groups 5 to 8) 
Group 5 = 2.5µg xeris glucagon, group 6 = 5µg xeris glucagon, group 7= 50 µg xeris glucagon, group 8 = 5µg Eli Lilly 
Glucagon.

Group 5 = 2.5µg xeris glucagon, group 6 = 5µg xeris glucagon, group 7= 50 µg xeris glucagon, group 8 = 5µg Eli Lilly 
Glucagon. 
In fasted Yorkshire pigs, the glucose response mediated by glucagon Xeris was identical to the one mediated 
by glucagon from Novo Nordisk when both compounds were administered SC at a lower dose level (i.e. 8.5-
fold) than the recommended dose of glucagon (1 mg for an adult). This is peculiar that the reference product 
that was used in this study (Novo Nordisk glucagon) is different than the one (Eli Lilly glucagon) used in other 
studies, which were carried out in rats. The applicant justified that this PKPD13-GPO-06 study was added in 
the dossier because Novo Nordisk glucagon is approved and marketed for use in the EU, while Eli Lilly glucagon 
is  Xeris  reference  product  in  the  US.  Although  it  would have  been  pertinent to  compare the  three glucagon 
products in Yorkshire pigs: Ogluo, Novo Nordisk glucagon, and Eli Lilly glucagon, the issue is not pursued. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
Considering the long clinical experience with glucagon, which is an authorised product, together with the fact 
that the formulation does not contain new excipients (i.e. trehalose and DMSO), the applicant did not perform 
dedicated secondary pharmacodynamics studies with Xeris glucagon; that is agreed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Considering the long clinical experience with glucagon, which is an authorised product, together with the fact 
that the formulation does not contain new excipients (i.e. trehalose and DMSO), the applicant did not perform 
dedicated safety pharmacology studies with Xeris glucagon; that is agreed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No nonclinical pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were conducted with Ogluo. Absence of 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable since glucagon is a well-established substance. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  Xeris  glucagon  was  assessed  in  vivo  in  PK/PD  studies  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  and 
Yorkshire pigs. In each of these studies, a marketed, recombinant glucagon injection drug product was used 
as a comparator.  
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 21/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  vehicle  formulation  was  modified  during  the  development  of  Xeris  glucagon  drug  product.  The 
pharmacokinetics of the 2 formulations was assessed in a single-dose study in rats. 
Additionally, Xeris glucagon plasma concentrations were measured in the 2-week toxicity study in rats. The 
PK/PD  study  in  rats  and  the  2-week  toxicity  study  in  rats  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  the  Good 
Laboratory Practices. 
Methods of analysis 
Initially,  Xeris  used  a  commercial  radioimmunoassay  (RIA)  to  quantify  glucagon  in  rodent  plasma  that  was 
performed  per  the  manufacturer  recommendation.  The  method  for  analyses  was  then  changed  to  a  robust 
liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)-based  assay.  The  LC-MS/MS  assay  was 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  European  Medicines  Agency  Guideline  on  Bioanalytical  Method  validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2). 
To ensure consistency of the bioanalytical results obtained from these assays, Xeris conducted a comparative 
analysis  of  glucagon levels  measured using  LC-MS/MS  and  RIA  and included results  from  an enzyme  linked 
immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA).  This  comparison  between  the  bioanalytical  methods  showed  generally  good 
comparability  with  sample  stabilisation.  The  glucagon  concentrations  were  generally  lower  using  the  RIA 
method.  The  observations  of  lower  nominal  concentrations  with  the  RIA  method  was  primarily  due  to 
background subtraction of endogenous levels of glucagon. No endogenous levels of glucagon were detected 
using the LC-MS/MS method.  
As  requested,  the  applicant  provided  more  in-depth  cross  validation  between  methods  and  its  conclusion 
regarding this aspect, in addition to an explanation on the role of ELISA method in this comparability exercise, 
which are acceptable. However, in fact the ELISA method was not used in nonclinical studies. 
In addition, nonclinical PK studies have little relevance for the comparability exercise between Ogluo and the 
EU reference product GlucaGen HypoKit, clinical studies being paramount for the demonstration of equivalence 
regarding safety and efficacy between the above-mentioned medicinal products. Therefore, no further issue 
has been raised.  
Absorption: 
The absorption of glucagon was assessed in SD Rats, which were administered with a SC single dose of Xeris 
glucagon (2.5, 5 or 50 µg) or Eli Lilly glucagon (5 µg). T1/2 and Tmax did not statistically differ between 2.5 
and  5  µg  Xeris  glucagon  compared  to  5  µg  Eli  Lilly  glucagon.  However,  Cmax  for  5  µg  Xeris  glucagon  was 
statistically greater than Cmax for 5 µg Eli Lilly glucagon, as opposed to Cmax for 2.5 µg Xeris glucagon. AUC0-
∞ were statistically similar for the two lower doses of Xeris glucagon and 5 µg Eli Lilly glucagon. One should 
expect to observe a greater calculated AUC0-∞ for 5 µg Xeris glucagon group than for the 2.5 µg one.  However, 
the applicant made the point that very low dose volumes were administered to the rats: 0.5 μL and 1.0 μL (2.5 
μg and 5 μg, respectively). So, mis-dosing may most likely occur with such low volumes. As a result, large 
variabilities can be expected in measurements of glucagon plasma concentrations. 
In Yorkshire pigs, no statistical differences were noted for Cmax and AUC0-∞ between Xeris glucagon and the 
reference control Novo Nordisk glucagon. The tested dose was 8.5-fold lower than the clinical intended dose of 
1 mg glucagon. 
Being  an  endogeneous  peptide,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  studies  with  Xeris  glucagon  are  not 
warranted. In view of the clinical experience - no drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with Xeris 
glucagon.

During development, the formulation of Xeris glucagon was slightly revised before entering into the Phase 3 
clinical studies. The new formulation is nearly identical to the formulation tested in earlier nonclinical and in 
the Phase 2 studies. 
Because of this change in formulation, a single-dose, exploratory study was conducted in SD rats to compare 
the  postdose  plasma  concentrations  of  Xeris  glucagon  measured  following  SC  dosing  of  1  mg/kg  with 
Formulation A or Formulation B. 
Statistical analysis of the glucagon plasma concentrations showed that the 2 formulations were equivalent 
with the ratio of mean glucagon over 240 minutes of 0.97 (90% CI, 0.81 to 1.17). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted with Xeris glucagon due to its extensive nonclinical and clinical 
experience as an endogenous component of glucose homeostasis and glycaemic control. However, no toxicity 
was noted in the repeat dose toxicity studies following a single dose of up to approximately 2 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of Xeris glucagon and the reversibility of the treatment effects were evaluated in two repeat-dose 
studies in rats: a 2-day toxicity study (Report CB12-5015-R-TX) and a 2-week toxicity study (Report XSGPE-
TX02). These studies included groups of rats administered the marketed Eli Lilly rDNA glucagon for injection 
as a comparator. The studies were designed to evaluate the toxicity, toxicokinetics, and/or pharmacodynamics 
of the Xeris glucagon formulation with the Eli Lilly Glucagon formulation. The 2-day study evaluated a dose of 
5 μg/day (approximately 0.02 mg/kg). The 2-week toxicity studies assessed doses of up to approximately 2 
mg/kg/day (approximately 1.23 to 1.64 mg/kg/day in males and 1.63 to 1.97 mg/kg/day in females).  
In general, the results of the studies showed similar effects among the rats treated with the Xeris Glucagon 
formulation and the Eli Lilly glucagon formulation. No glucagon-related deaths occurred. Statistical analyses 
of the body weight and clinical pathology data revealed no adverse effects at any dose assessed. The minor 
changes seen in these parameters were transient in nature and often occurred among both Xeris and Eli Lilly 
glucagon-treated rats. 
In the 2 day-study, increased incidence of rats with mild inflammation at the injection site was noted in the 
Xeris-treated animals (9/20) compared to the other treatment groups, including the Xeris-vehicle, which each 
had 1/20 animals with generally trace to mild injection site inflammation. Thus, this finding might be considered 
treatment-related. 
In the 2-week study, reversible increases in mean absolute and relative (body and brain) liver weights occurred 
in males and females administered the high dose (Xeris glucagon: approximately 1.23 to 1.64 mg/kg/day in 
males and 1.63 to 1.97 mg/kg/day in females; Eli Lilly glucagon: 1.16 to 1.60 mg/kg in males and 1.64 to 2.00 
mg/kg  in  females).  No  hepatic  changes  were  noted  microscopically  and  the  changes  were  attributed  to  the 
pharmacology of glucagon. In the 2-week repeated-dose toxicity study there were no major adverse effects

but the development of scabs at the injection sites was noted mainly in the Xeris glucagon, and to a lesser 
extent in Xeris vehicle-treated rats that were not fully reversible after a 2 week recovery period. Histologically, 
the  findings  at  the  injection  site  correlated  with  epidermal  necrosis  and  serocellular  crust  formation.  Since 
comparable  histological  findings  were  also observed  in  the  rat  administered  the  Xeris-vehicle,  the  applicant 
suggested  a  potential  vehicle-related  effect  rather  than  a  Xeris  glucagon  related  effect  at  the  injected  site. 
Nevertheless,  injection  site  lesions  in  the  2  mg/kg/day  Xeris  Glucagon  dose  group  animals  at  Day  15  were 
considered  to  be  more  severe  overall.  Compared  to  Xeris-glucagon,  no  adverse  findings  were  noted  at  the 
injection site of rats administered the comparator (Glucagon Emergency Kit from Eli Lilly) or its corresponding 
vehicle. Based on the results of the 2-day and 14-day toxicity studies, the contribution of the vehicle does not 
appear  sufficient  to  explain  the  higher  toxicity  of  Xeris-glucagon  at  injection  site  as  compared  to  Eli  Lilly 
glucagon. In the clinical programme, injection site reactions were mild to moderate in severity, self-limited, 
fully  resolved  and  required  no  additional  medical  intervention.  Importantly,  injection  site  oedema  has  been 
added as a common adverse reaction to the Ogluo SmPC.  
Other than the effects observed at the injection sites, there were no systemic toxicities at any Xeris Glucagon 
dose levels. Comparable effects were observed at equivalent doses of the Lilly Glucagon test article; therefore, 
with the exception of injection site findings, there are no profound differences with regards to the toxicological 
profile between the two test articles when administered to male and female rats over a 14-day period. 
Genotoxicity  
Glucagon  has  been  extensively  used  in  the  clinic  and  the  safety  profile  of  this  peptide  is  well  known. 
Furthermore, the excipients used in the Xeris-glucagon drug product formulation (i.e. trehalose and DMSO) are 
not new. Therefore, genotoxicity studies are not warranted with Xeris glucagon.  
Carcinogenicity  
Glucagon has been extensively used in the clinic and the safety profile of this peptide is well known. Therefore, 
carcinogenicity studies are not warranted with Xeris glucagon.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Glucagon has been extensively used in the clinic and the safety profile of this peptide is well known. Therefore, 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are not warranted with Xeris glucagon. With regards to fertility, 
pregnancy, and lactation, section 4.6 of the SmPC of Xeris glucagon was aligned with the information contained 
in the SmPC of the reference product. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The 2-week toxicity study included an assessment of the toxicokinetics of Xeris glucagon compared with the 
Eli Lilly glucagon. No sex-related differences in plasma glucagon levels were noted at any dose. A comparison 
of Xeris glucagon to Lilly glucagon AUC0-120 ratios ranged from 1.13 to 1.78 on Day 1 and from 1.49 to 3.08 
on Day 14, indicating that plasma levels of glucagon tended to be higher following repeated administration of 
Xeris glucagon compared to Lilly glucagon. The slight increase in the plasma glucagon levels after repeated 
doses of the Xeris glucagon did not appear to increase toxicity in the dose groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 24/114 
 
 
 
 
Based on the 14-day repeat dose study, the NOAEL was found to be approximately 1.23 to 1.64 mg/kg in 
males and 1.63 to 1.97 mg/kg/day in females (safety margins 33.2 to 36.3x based on Cmax for the clinical 
intended dose of 1 mg/day, study XSGP-301). 
Local Tolerance  
In a local tolerance study, no Xeris glucagon-related dermal irritation was seen in rabbits following a single SC 
dose  of  1  mg/rabbit.  Reversible,  mild  inflammation,  mixed  cell  in  the  subcutaneous  tissue  and  minimal 
degeneration/necrosis, myofiber in the subcutaneous tissue were noted approximately 48-hours postdose for 
2  of  3  males  administered  1  mg  Xeris  glucagon.  No  histopathologic  changes  were  seen  at  the  necropsy 
conducted on Day 14. 
Other toxicity studies 
A 14-day rat toxicology study was conducted to qualify potential impurities that may become present during 
the anticipated 2-year shelf-life of the drug product. In that study animals were administered Xeris glucagon 
vehicle  or  Xeris  glucagon  at  dose  levels  up  to  2  mg/kg/day  that  was  deliberately  degraded  to  simulate  the 
impurity  profile  present  at  the  end  of  shelf  life  (forced  degradation  protocol).  This  study  did  not  identify 
unexpected toxicities. The minor changes seen in body weight and clinical pathology data were comparable to 
those seen with Xeris glucagon and the Eli Lilly glucagon in the previous 2-week toxicity study. Increased liver 
weights and ratios were noted and were associated with glycogen-type vacuolation in the liver of males and 
females at ≥1 mg/kg/day. These increases in glycogen content in the liver is an expected result of glucagon 
treatment and its pharmacological mechanism. The NOAEL established in this study was 2 mg/kg/day.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided the adequate justification for not submitting ERA studies. The active substance of Ogluo 
(glucagon  for  injection)  is  glucagon,  an  endogenous  peptide  hormone,  and  is  thus  classified  as  a  peptide; 
therefore, a detailed Environmental Risk Assessment is not required for this medicinal product.  
With regards to disposal, section 6.6 of the Ogluo SmPC appropriately specified that any unused medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements that is consistent with 
the information available in the SmPC of the reference product (GlucaGen HypoKit). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support this submission, Xeris has conducted 6 nonclinical studies with the Xeris glucagon formulation (4 
studies in Sprague-Dawley rats, 1 study in New Zealand White rabbits, and 1 study in Yorkshire pigs. Two of 
the  rat  studies  compared  the  pharmacodynamics  (PD),  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  toxicokinetics  (TK),  and/or 
toxicity of the Xeris glucagon formulation with the Eli Lilly glucagon formulation and a study in Yorkshire pigs 
compared  the  PD  and  PK  of  Xeris  glucagon  with  the  Novo  Nordisk’s  glucagon  formulation,  which  is  the  EU 
reference  product  for  Ogluo  (Eli  Lilly  2018,  Novo  Nordisk  2015).  A  2-week  study  was  conducted  in  rats  to 
qualify impurities present in the drug substance after forced degradation. Further, a local subcutaneous (SC) 
Assessment report

tolerance study was conducted with Xeris glucagon in rabbits. In addition, a single-dose PK study was conducted 
to assess a change in the formulation of the drug product.    
Overall, the in vivo pharmacodynamics data show that at clinically relevant doses, Xeris glucagon injection was 
highly effective in raising glucose levels and produced glucose responses in rats and pigs that were comparable 
to the marketed glucagon products (Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk).  Nevertheless, in the rat study at short times 
(5-10 min post-dosing), the Eli Lilly glucagon was found to act faster and more efficiently than Ogluo. Moreover, 
the applicant used different comparators in the PD studies conducted in the rat (Eli Lilly glucagon) and in the 
pig (Novo Nordisk glucagon) because Novo Nordisk glucagon is approved and marketed for use in the EU, while 
Eli Lilly glucagon is Xeris’ reference product in the US.  Although it would have been pertinent to compare the 
three glucagon products in Yorkshire pigs: Ogluo, Novo Nordisk glucagon, and Eli Lilly glucagon, this issue was 
not pursued. 
To ensure consistency of the bioanalytical results, Xeris conducted a comparative analysis of glucagon levels 
measured using LC-MS/MS and RIA and included results from an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
This  comparison  between  the  bioanalytical  methods  showed  generally  good  comparability  with  sample 
stabilisation.  The  glucagon  concentrations  were  generally  lower  using  the  RIA  method.  The  observations  of 
lower nominal concentrations with the RIA method were primarily due to background subtraction of endogenous 
levels of glucagon. No endogenous levels of glucagon were detected using the LC-MS/MS method. It was not 
clear why the ELISA method was included in this comparative analysis. A rationale regarding the role of the 
ELISA  method  in  the  comparability  exercise  and  a  more  thorough  discussion  regarding  the  comparability 
between  the  bioanalytical  methods  used  have  been  provided.  However,  in  fact  ELISA  method  has  not  been 
used in nonclinical studies. Moreover, the little relevance of nonclinical PK studies in the comparability exercise 
between test article and reference product should be taken into account, paramount trials being represented 
by clinical studies. In conclusion, the query raised was resolved. 
Post-dose plasma glucagon concentrations and absorption parameters (Cmax, AUC) in Sprague-Dawley rats 
and Yorkshire pigs administered Xeris glucagon was overall similar to those seen in animals administered the 
same doses of Eli Lilly glucagon (rats) or Novo Nordisk glucagon (Yorkshire pigs). No statistically significant 
differences were noted for any group. It is unclear why in the rat study, the AUC0-∞ for Xeris glucagon at the 
dose of 2.5 µg and 5 µg were not statistically different. However, in further discussions, the applicant made 
the  point  that  very  low  dose  volumes  were  administered  to  the  rats:  0.5  μL  and  1.0  μL  (2.5  μg  and  5  μg, 
respectively). So, mis-dosing may most likely occur with such low volumes. As a result, one can expect large 
variabilities in measurements of glucagon plasma concentrations. 
Since  the  formulation  of  Xeris  glucagon  was  slightly  revised  during  the  clinical  development  programme,  a 
single-dose,  exploratory  study  was  conducted  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats  to  compare  the  post-dose  plasma 
concentrations measured following SC dosing with Formulation A or Formulation B. This exploratory PK study 
confirmed the bioequivalence of the 2 Xeris glucagon formulations.  
The Xeris glucagon toxicity programme was comprised of a 2-day toxicity study and a 2-week toxicity study to 
evaluate the toxicity of the Xeris drug product in rats. These studies included groups of rats administered the 
marketed Eli Lilly rDNA glucagon for injection as a comparator. No unexpected Xeris glucagon-related systemic 
toxicities occurred in rats administered 5 μg/day (~ 0.02 mg/kg) for 2 days or up to 2 mg/kg/day. In general, 
the results of the studies showed similar effects among the rats treated with the Xeris glucagon formulation 
and  the  Eli  Lilly  glucagon  formulation.  Nevertheless,  injection  site  lesions  were  observed  in  the  animals 
administered Xeris glucagon and, to a lesser extent, Xeris vehicle, while no such a finding was observed with 
the comparator (Glucagon Emergency Kit from Eli Lilly) or its corresponding vehicle. The applicant underlined 
Assessment report

that  in  the  clinical  programme,  injection  site  reactions  were  mild  to  moderate  in  severity,  self-limited,  fully 
resolved and required no additional medical intervention. Importantly, injection site oedema has been added 
as a common adverse reaction to the Ogluo SmPC, which addresses adequately the concern that was raised 
both in the nonclinical and clinical studies. 
In view of the nonclinical and clinical experience with glucagon, no reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies have been conducted with Xeris glucagon. 
In a local tolerance study conducted in the rabbit, mild inflammation, mixed cell in the subcutaneous tissue 
and minimal degeneration/necrosis, myofiber in the subcutaneous tissue were noted approximately 48-hours 
after  the  SC  administration  of  1  mg  Xeris  glucagon.  Those  findings  were  reversible  as  no  histopathologic 
changes were seen at the necropsy conducted on Day 14. 
No unexpected toxicities occurred in a 2-week toxicity study in rats that was conducted to evaluate impurities 
in the Xeris glucagon drug product. No adverse toxicities occurred in vehicle control animals administered the 
Xeris DMSO vehicle formulation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, all nonclinical aspects have been addressed satisfactory. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

Table 1 Ogluo clinical studies 
Gvoke=Ogluo 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of Ogluo were evaluated in healthy volunteer studies XSGP-101 and XSGP-201, and phase 3 
studies  XSGP-301  (adult  T1D  patients)  and  XSGP-302  (paediatric  T1D  patients).  The  focus  of  the  clinical 
development programme was, however, on the demonstration of comparable clinical effect of Ogluo to currently 
marketed versions of glucagon, therefore, PK data are mostly supportive for this application. 
Since  Ogluo  is  a  synthetic  glucagon  formulation  which  contains  the  same  amino  acid  sequence  as  native 
glucagon as well as to recombinant glucagon used in currently marketed glucagon emergency kits, distribution 
and elimination pathways are expected to be the same as for recombinant glucagon. 
Analytical methods 
Throughout the clinical programme, two analytical methods were used to quantify glucagon in plasma samples; 
1) a radioimmunoassay (RIA) and 2) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  
The LC-MS/MS method, used for glucagon determination in studies XSGP-101, -301, and -302, was adequately 
validated,  but  unexpected  issues  (low  IS  response,  interfering  peak)  were  encountered  during  analysis  of 
samples of study XSGP-301 and study XSGP-101, respectively. Although the acidification process during clinical 
sample processing was suspected to be the root cause for this deviating IS response in study XSGP-301, the 
applicant reassured that protease activity was sufficiently blocked in all samples. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021

For study XSGP-101, the presence of an interfering peak in an important portion of study samples could not 
be  clarified.  Obviously,  the  accuracy  of  a  portion  of  the  study  samples  may  have  been  influenced  by  the 
presence of this interfering peak (as reflected by ISR failure), precluding conclusion on PK equivalence (see 
below).  
No bioanalytical issues were reported for paediatric study XSGP-302. 
The commercial RIA kit, applied in study XSGP-201, was not revalidated in line with the EMA guideline and 
cross-reactivity  with  glucagon-like  peptides  present  in  Lilly  glucagon  was  observed.  Since  the  clinical 
programme focussed on the demonstration of comparable clinical effect, these issues were not pursued. 
PK studies 
Study XSGP-201 
The overall objective of study XSGP-201 was to compare the safety, PK, and efficacy (glucodynamics) of Ogluo 
administered as 0.5 mg and 1 mg injections, versus the US comparator Lilly glucagon for injection (GEK) 1 mg. 
The  study  was  designed  as  a  randomised,  double-blind,  3-period,  6-sequence  crossover  study  in  healthy 
volunteers (N=30). Treatment were separated with a period of 3-14 days. 
Treatment groups differed significantly (p<0.001) with regard to mean glucagon AUC0-240, mean glucagon 
Cmax, and mean glucagon tmax and no evidence of bioequivalence between treatments was found with regard 
to these three parameters. Significantly higher exposure was observed after administration of Lilly glucagon 
versus Ogluo and tmax was longer for Ogluo (mean of 37.6 min versus 18.9 min) (Figure 4). 
Figure 4. Mean plasma glucagon (ng/mL) by time and treatment  
Given the findings of XSGP-201, Phase 3 trials of Ogluo focused on establishing non-inferiority to the US and 
EU reference product via a clinical efficacy development programme. Comparative PK analyses were not part 
of the Phase 3 programme. In this context, the lack of BE is not of concern.

Study XSGP-101 
Ogluo is offered in two presentations; a pre-filled syringe inserted into an auto-injector (AI, Configuration A) 
and  a  pre-filled  syringe  fitted  with  a  manual  plunger  rod  and  backstop  (PFS,  Configuration  B).  All  phase  3 
studies were conducted with Configuration A. 
Study XSGP-101 was a Phase 1, single-site, randomised, open-label, two-way crossover study to demonstrate 
PK and PD equivalence of Ogluo 1 mg when injected SC in the abdomen via auto-injector versus a manual pre-
filled syringe, in fasted healthy subjects with low to normal blood glucose (70 to 120 mg/dL). Two single dose 
treatments were administered 3 to 7 days apart. 
Mean plasma glucagon AUC(0-240), Cmax, and tmax were generally similar overall and between treatments, 
although lower plasma glucagon AUC and Cmax levels were shown for subjects who received AI (Configuration 
A) at their second treatment. These lower glucagon levels are neither considered statistical or clinically relevant 
since  they  did not  correlate  to  lower  plasma  glucose  levels  and did  not  impact  the  BE  conclusion.  It  should 
however  be  reminded  that,  as  explained  above  (bioanalytical  methods),  no  definite  conclusion  on  PK 
equivalence  can  be  drawn  due  to  the  potential  inaccurate  measurements  of  an  important  portion  of  study 
samples. Since it is acknowledged that the PD response is most relevant for the desired action of Ogluo and 
PD equivalence was demonstrated between both configurations in this study, this issue was not further pursued. 
Table 2. Analysis of plasma glucagon between treatments (study XSGP-101) 
Study XSGP-301 
Study XSGP-301 was a randomised, double-blinded, 2-way crossover comparative efficacy and safety study 
comparing  Ogluo  1  mg  to  Glucagon  Emergency  Kit (GEK,  Eli  Lily)  1  mg,  in  80  subjects  with  T1D  during  an 
induced state of severe hypoglycaemia. PK parameters were determined after SC administration of Ogluo and 
analysed descriptively for the different injection sites (randomly assigned): upper arm, leg, or abdomen. Mean 
plasma glucagon tmax was similar regardless of injection site. However, mean plasma glucagon Cmax and AUC 
values were highest when Ogluo was administered in the abdomen followed by the arm, followed by the leg. 
These differences are not considered to be clinically relevant since comparable PD data (time to plasma glucose 
> 70 mg/dL) were obtained for the different injection sites.

Since  study  XSGP-301  is  the  only  PK  study  conducted  in  adult  type  1  diabetes  (T1D)  patients,  the  PK

Discrepancies  were  noted  between  AUC,  Cmax,  and  tmax  values  (of  the  same  study)  reported  in  different

and adapted the SmPC accordingly. 
Bioavailability 
Different  injection  sites  (arm,  leg,  or  abdomen)  for  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  of  Ogluo  were  used 
throughout the clinical development programme (see Table 1). 
Pharmacokinetics  for  Ogluo  were  described  by  injection  site  in  Study  XSGP-301.  This  study  was  a  Phase  3,

mg/dL plasma glucose), subjects were treated SC in the upper arm, leg, or abdomen with either 1 mg Lilly 
Glucagon or 1 mg Ogluo. The injection site for each subject was randomly assigned and remained fixed between 
the two treatment visits. Treatments were separated by a wash-out of 7 to 28 days. 
A total of 80 subjects (44 male, 36 female) were randomised; 77 subjects received the Ogluo treatment. As a 
post-hoc analysis, the PK parameters (only determined for Ogluo) were analysed descriptively by injection site. 
Results 
Mean  plasma  glucagon  concentration  (Ogluo  glucagon)  over  time  was  highest  when  administered  in  the 
abdomen, followed by the arm, followed by the leg from approximately 20 to 60 minutes after administration. 
After 60 minutes, plasma glucagon concentration over time showed little separation between curves by injection 
site. 
Assessment of different injection site locations showed that mean plasma glucagon Cmax and AUC values were 
highest  when  Ogluo  was  administered  in  the  abdomen  followed  by  the  arm,  followed  by  the  leg.  However, 
mean plasma glucagon tmax was similar regardless of injection site location.

Since study XSGP-301 was primarily an efficacy and safety study, only PK-related aspects of this study are 
described here. For more details on the study, reference is made to the clinical efficacy section. 
PK parameters for the different injection sites were only analysed descriptively and hence, no statistical analysis 
was  performed.  Neither  did  the  applicant  provide  a  plasma  concentration  time  curve  by  injection  site.  In 
general, tmax was the least impacted by the location of injection, which is important for a rescue medication. 
Larger mean differences (and more variability) was observed between injection sites for the parameters Cmax 
and AUC. The applicant discussed the observed differences are not clinically relevant.

Ogluo is a formulation of synthetic glucagon that is structurally identical to native glucagon as well as to 
recombinant glucagon used in currently marketed glucagon emergency kits. Once absorbed, distribution and 
elimination pathways are expected to be the same as for recombinant glucagon. Limited information on 
Ogluo distribution has been provided, which was considered acceptable. Across studies, a very broad range of 
values were reported for the apparent volume of distribution. Considering these data, the applicant clarified 
the origin of the range of 137-2425 L for apparent volume of distribution reported in the SmPC.  
Elimination 
Glucagon is extensively degraded in the liver, kidney, and plasma. 
In study XSGP-301, the mean apparent clearance was determined to be 340 L/h (range 144 -800 L/h) and 
the mean half-life was 31.9 minutes. 
In study XSGP-201, the mean half-life was 63.7 minutes following administration of 1 mg Ogluo and 51.0 
minutes following administration of 1 mg Lilly glucagon.  
In study XSGP-101, the mean half-life was 41.4 minutes (Configuration A) and 35.9 minutes (Configuration 
B).  
Elimination pathways are expected to be the same for Ogluo as for other glucagon formulations. Compared to 
the patient information for Lilly glucagon (half-life of 8-18 minutes after IV administration), a longer half-life 
was observed for Ogluo and for Lilly glucagon following SC administration. This likely reflects residual 
appearance from the injection site, so called flip-flop kinetics. The value for half-life obtained in study XSGP-
301 is used for labelling purposes, which is supported since this is the only PK study conducted in T1D 
patients. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study XSGP-201, dose linearity and proportionality of Ogluo 0.5 mg and Ogluo 1 mg were investigated by 
fitting a simple linear model with dose as the factor: 
= 
0+
(
1
ose). 
Dose linearity could not be established statistically for any glucagon parameter (AUC0-240 and Cmax) 
𝑌𝑌

𝐷𝐷
because the slope 
1of dose was not significantly different from zero (P-values: AUC0-240: 0.19, Cmax: 
0.30). Due to the inability to statistically support dose linearity, dose proportionality could not be 
𝜃𝜃
demonstrated for any glucagon parameters (AUC0-240, Cmax, and tmax). 
AUC and Cmax were less than dose proportional after administration of a single 1 mg and 0.5 mg dose of 
Ogluo in study XSGP-201. Since Ogluo is proposed as a single dose rescue treatment in case of severe 
hypoglycaemia, the lack of dose-proportionality was not of concern. 
Special populations 
Study XSGP-302 
Study XSGP-302 was a Phase 3 study to evaluate the glucose response of Ogluo in paediatric patients with 
T1D. The PK of Ogluo for each age group (2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years) were analysed 
descriptively as a secondary objective. Subjects were administered insulin to induce a low normal glycaemic

state and then received an age appropriate dose of Ogluo. Subjects aged 2 to < 12 years received a single 0.5 
mg dose of Ogluo. Subjects aged 12 to < 18 years received a 1 mg dose of Ogluo at the first visit, and the 0.5 
mg dose at a second visit occurring 1 to 4 weeks later. The applicant states that the transition to the adult 
dose (i.e. 1 mg) at 12 years (corresponding to average weight of 40-45 kg) is based on a weight-exposure 
model  using  data  from  study  XSGP-201.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  the  details  of  this  modelling 
exercise as well as a discussion on the reliability of the conclusion as no subjects weighing less than 58 kg were 
included in study XSGP-201. The applicant’s responses clarified that the paediatric dose selection was not based 
on modelling and simulation and it was based on the ISPAD 2014 guidelines. Based on PK data available from 
study  XSGP-201  in  adults  a  weight–based  exposure  modelling  analysis  has  been  performed  in  adolescents 
weighing above 40 kg, including the median, the 5th and 95th percentiles for glucagon AUC and concentration. 
No simulations were performed in children below 12 years and weighing below 40 kg.  
From the figures provided for glucagon concentration the 5th percentile after 1 mg dose crosses with the 95th 
percentile after 0.5 mg dose at the point corresponding to the weight cut-off of 45 kg. However, the values for 
glucagon AUC corresponding to this weight cut-off after the 0.5 mg dose are below those obtained after 1 mg 
dose.  
The applicant assumed that at this weight cut-off (45 kg) similar exposures for both Cmax and AUC would be 
expected in paediatric population as to that of 1 mg dose in adults weighing 70 kg, but simulations have not 
been performed in support of that assumption. In addition, no information about the simulations for Ctau is 
included. 
Based  on  PK  data  observed  in  the  conducted  paediatric  study  XSGP-302  lower  exposures  were  noticed  in 
adolescents either after 0.5 mg or 1 mg dose than in children 2-6 years of age. In addition, a lower exposure 
was noticed in children 6-12 years of age comparative with the one observed in children 2-6 years of age after 
administration of a fixed 0.5 mg dose of glucagon.

The predictions from the performed weight-based modelling analysis indicate a decreasing in exposure with 
the increasing of the body weight, given the high volume of distribution of glucagon, in a similar way with the 
lower exposures observed with increasing of age group after subcutaneous administration of glucagon.  
Although it should be kept in mind that subject numbers for each age group were low and the secondary PD 
endpoints were similar between age groups with regard to mean plasma glucose AUC(0-90), Cmax, and Tmax, 
there seems to be a trend for decreasing mean glucagon levels with increasing age group after administration 
of a fixed 0.5 mg dose, thus, the proposed weight cut-off at 45 kg for the transition to adult dose does not 
support an optimal dose based on glucagon PK parameters in children 6-12 years. Therefore, a weight cut-off 
at 25 kg was recommended for the transition to adult dose.  
The applicant revised the paediatric dosage including a weight cut-off at 25 kg, for transition to adult dose, 1 
mg, and the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
PK data obtained in paediatric subjects have been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
Other special populations 
No studies with Ogluo were performed in renal and/or hepatic impaired patients. The applicant relays on the 
labelling information for the reference product Glucagen in these subpopulations. Hence, the proposed SmPC 
does not include any dose adjustments. This is considered acceptable in view of the short-time emergency use 
of Ogluo. 
Study XSGP-301 included 9 T1D patients aged 65 years and above, but PK parameters were not presented 
separately for these elderly patients. In general, no changes in PK parameters are expected due to advanced 
age in line with what is known for other glucagon products. 
The PK of Ogluo were analysed descriptively for different ethnicities/races in studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-101 
and suggest no significant difference in Ogluo PK among subgroups.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The  interaction  properties  of  Ogluo  proposed  for  labelling  are  based  on  published  data  for  the  injectable 
glucagon formulation, which is acceptable.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Glucagon increases blood glucose concentration by activating hepatic glucagon receptors, thereby stimulating 
glycogen breakdown and release of glucose from the liver. Hepatic stores of glycogen are necessary for 
glucagon to produce an anti-hypoglycaemic effect. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 used GEK (the US reference product) as comparator, therefore these 
studies are less relevant for Europe. Study XSGP-302 had no control arm and was mainly intended to justify 
the use in children and to determine the dose in children. Study XSGP-304 is the pivotal study. Overall, 
Ogluo seems to act slower than the reference product, but Cmax and Glucose AUC (0-90) is slightly higher.  
Plasma glucose was assessed for different periods of time across studies (ie, 90, 180, or 240 minutes). In 
addition, study investigators had discretion to restart a subject’s insulin if medically necessary after the 90-
minute timepoint, which required censoring of glucose values from after that point due to the potential 
confounding effect of this glucose lowering medication. 
Therefore, to standardise results for comparison of pharmacodynamics across studies, time to reach two 
specified plasma glucose levels was analysed (from time of study drug injection), as opposed to only using 
Cmax, tmax and AUC: 
1. Time to plasma glucose > 70 mg/dL. 
2. Time to a plasma glucose increase over baseline of ≥ 20 mg/dL. 
Data were pooled for the Study XSGP-301 and Study XSGP-303 Phase 3 studies. Data from Study XSGP-304 
is presented as a comparison to pooled data. Study drug preparation time for Ogluo in Study XSGP-304 was 
0.76 minutes vs 1.76 minutes for HK; this time advantage for Ogluo would shorten time to plasma glucose 
recovery. 
In pooled Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, and in Study XSGP-304, the time to specified plasma glucose 
(>70 mg/dL or increase ≥ 20 mg/dL) was approximately 4 minutes longer following Ogluo treatment in 
patients with T1D. However, in the pooled studies, time to hypoglycaemia symptom relief (clinical correlate) 
was similar and not statistically different between Ogluo and GEK. Overall, the average time to plasma 
glucose recovery was well below the threshold of 30 minutes from study drug injection (13.8 minutes 
following Ogluo administration and 10.0 minutes following GEK). 
In Study XSGP-304, the time to specified plasma glucose response was approximately 4 minutes longer 
following Ogluo treatment in patients with T1D. However, time to hypoglycaemia symptom relief (clinical 
correlate) was similar between Ogluo and HK in the mITT population and statistically significantly faster for 
Ogluo in the PP population. Overall, the average time to plasma glucose recovery was well below the 
threshold of 30 minutes from study drug injection (14.8 minutes after Ogluo administration and 10.4 minutes 
after HK). 
Overall, across all adult Phase 3 studies the average time to plasma glucose recovery was below the 
threshold of 30 minutes from study drug injection, in any treatment arm.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general, for the PK data provided in this application issues were observed with the bioanalytical methods 
questioning the reliability of the data reported (see  below). The discrepancies found between PK parameter 
values for the same study reported in different documents have been clarified by the applicant. 
The LC-MS/MS method, used for glucagon determination in studies XSGP-101, -301, and -302, was adequately 
validated,  but  unexpected  issues  (low  IS  response,  interfering  peak)  were  encountered  during  analysis  of 
samples of study XSGP-301 and study XSGP-101, respectively. The applicant was asked to justify the reliability 
of the results obtained in these studies. The fact that an important portion of samples from both Configuration 
A  and  B  could  not  be  determined  accurately  (as  reflected  in  the  failed  ISR),  precluded  conclusion  on  PK 
equivalence. However, it is acknowledged that only the PD response is relevant for the desired action of Ogluo 
and PD equivalence was demonstrated between both configurations in this study. No bioanalytical issues were 
reported for paediatric study XSGP-302. 
Deficiencies identified for the commercial RIA kit, applied in study XSGP-201, are not further questioned since 
no bioequivalence (BE) between Ogluo and Lilly glucagon could be demonstrated in this study, which changed 
the focus of the clinical programme to the demonstration of comparable clinical effect. 
Besides the significant differences in exposure between Ogluo 1 mg injections and the Lilly glucagon emergency 
kit 1 mg in study XSGP-201, there was also a shift in tmax. The observed delayed tmax for Ogluo (mean of 
37.6 min versus 18.9 min) is also reflected in the PD response.  
Assessment  of  the  use  of  different  injection  sites  in Study  XSGP-301  showed  that  mean  plasma  glucagon 
tmax  was  similar  regardless  of  injection  site.  However,  mean  plasma  glucagon  Cmax  and  AUC  values  were 
highest  when  Ogluo  was  administered  in  the  abdomen  followed  by  the  arm,  followed  by  the  leg.  These 
differences are not clinically significant since the corresponding plasma glucose responses are comparable.  
In  view  of  the  proposed  indication  in  children  of  2  years  and  above,  a  paediatric  study  XSGP-302  was 
performed to compare the PK after Ogluo administration in T1D patients between 3 age groups (2 to <6, 6 to 
<12, and 12 to <18 year). Subjects aged 2 to <12 years received a single 0.5 mg dose of Ogluo, whereas 
subjects aged 12 to < 18 years initially received a 1 mg dose. The transition to the 1 mg dose at 40-45 kg 
(corresponding to +/-12 years old subjects) has been proposed based on a weight-exposure model using data 
from study XSGP-201. The applicant was asked to provide the details of this modelling exercise as well as a 
discussion on the reliability of the conclusion as no subjects weighing less than 58 kg were included in study 
XSGP-201. The applicant’s responses clarified that the paediatric dose selection was not based on modelling 
and simulation and it was based on the ISPAD 2014 guidelines. In addition, based on PK data available from 
study  XSGP-201  in  adults,  a  weight–based  exposure  modelling  analysis  has  been  performed  in  adolescents 
weighing above 40 kg. No simulations were performed in children below 12 years and weighing below 40 kg.  
The predictions from the performed weight-based modelling analysis indicate a decreasing in exposure with 
the increasing of the body weight, given the high volume of distribution of glucagon, in a similar way with the 
lower exposures observed with increasing of age group after subcutaneous administration of glucagon. 
Although it should be kept in mind that subject numbers for each age group were low and the secondary PD 
endpoints were similar between age groups with regard to mean plasma glucose AUC(0-90), Cmax, and tmax, 
there seems to be a trend for decreasing mean glucagon levels with increasing age group after administration 
of a fixed 0.5 mg dose, thus, the proposed weight cut-off at 45 kg for the transition to adult dose does not 
support an optimal dose based on glucagon PK parameters in children 6-12 years. Therefore, a weight cut-off 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021

at  25  kg  was  recommended  for  the  transition  to  adult  dose.  As  recommended,  the  applicant  revised  the 
paediatric  dosage  including  a  weight  cut-off  at  25  kg  for  transition  to  adult  dose.  The  PK  data  obtained  in 
paediatric subjects have been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
No studies have been performed to investigate PK of Ogluo in patients with T2D. However, the applicant intends 
to conduct a post-marketing actual-use study and include both T1DM and T2DM subjects (see efficacy). 
Ogluo is structurally identical to currently marketed recombinant glucagon formulations. The absence of specific 
DDI studies is thus acceptable. Similarly, no renal and/or hepatic impairment studies were conducted, which is 
accepted.  
Study XSGP-301 included 9 T1D patients aged 65 years and above, but PK parameters were not presented 
separately for these elderly patients. In general, no changes in PK parameters are expected due to advanced 
age, in line with what is known for other glucagon products. 
The PK of Ogluo were analysed descriptively for different ethnicities/races in studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-101 
and suggest no significant difference in Ogluo PK among subgroups. 
The PD was evaluated in studies XSGP-301 and 303 where GEK (the US reference product) was used as 
comparator, therefore these studies are less relevant for Europe. Study XSGP-302 had no control arm and 
was mainly intended to justify the use in children and to determine the dose in children. Study XSGP-304 is 
the pivotal study. Overall, Ogluo seems to act slower than the reference product, but Cmax and Glucose AUC 
(0-90) is a little bit higher. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK data are supportive for this application. All other concerns have been addressed by the applicant and are 
considered resolved.  
In general, the PD data indicate that Ogluo acts around 4 minutes slower than the reference product 
GlucaGen HypoKit. However, Ogluo has ease-of-use as the main added value. It is pre-mixed and pre-loaded 
into a pre-filled syringe and auto-injector pen ready-to-use with no reconstitution required. In addition, it has 
enhanced portability and availability due to room-temperature stability. These are all considerable 
advantages when compared to the existing EU product, HK, that needs to be reconstituted in a multi-step 
process and for which the cold chain should be maintained (under clinical efficacy). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Ogluo was evaluated for 2 pooled study population groups: 
1. Adult Phase 3 Studies: Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 examined the use of Ogluo, Configuration A, in 
adult subjects with T1D in comparison to GEK. 
2. Paediatric Phase 3 Study: Study XSGP-302 examined the glucose response of subjects ages 2≤18 years 
with T1D following administration of Ogluo, Configuration A. 
Simple pooling of Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 was carried out with the assumption that the studies 
were weighted equally because they employed similar study designs and methodology; had identical selection 
criteria, a comparable number of clinical sites, and similar patient demographics and number of subjects; and 
used the identical active comparator (GEK). 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 39/114 
 
 
 
 
Of important note, both Phase 3 studies (XSGP-301, -303) were crossover studies; therefore, the number of 
subjects receiving each treatment presented does not represent unique subjects, but rather Ogluo or 
comparator administrations. 
Study XSGP-304 was not pooled with Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 because of dissimilarity of the study 
designs, i.e. different target blood glucose level (54 mg/dL to meet IHSG guidelines, rather than 50 mg/dL), 
the insulin-induction procedure itself (continued for an additional 5 minutes after plasma glucose confirmation 
to align with EMA SA), and the active comparator reference drug used HK (instead of GEK).  
The applicant provided the required clarifications regarding the numbers of drug product batches and auto-
injectors (pens) batches used in all clinical studies.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
There were no real dose-selection studies for Ogluo. The applicant used the doses of the RLDs (Eli Lilly 
glucagon and GlucaGen HypoKit) for adults, i.e. 1 mg. However, for children, different cut-offs for the choice 
between the 0.5 and the 1 mg dose were used than for the RLDs, which required further justification.  
As stated in Abraham 2018, the recommended glucagon dosing is weight based: 1 mg for adults and children 
>25 kg and 0.5 mg for children <25 kg (according to Novo Nordisk manufacturer guidelines) while Eli Lilly 
uses a weight cut-off of 20 kg. In the EU SmPC of GlucaGen HypoKit, the 1 mg dose is already recommended 
as of 25 kg and 6-8 years old while for Ogluo, this is only as of 12 years old or 45 kg.  
The applicant refers to the ISPAD 2014 guidelines for the use of 12 years as a cut-off to choose between 0.5 
mg and 1 mg. The applicant also refers to the results of XSGP-201 study, based on which – through a 
weight-exposure model - the transition to the adult dose of Ogluo is proposed at 40 to 45 kg, corresponding 
to the average weight at 12 years of age (see also PK section). Moreover, as the paediatric study XSGP-302 
only included 13 patients ages 6≤12 years, the data are limited and it cannot be excluded that there is a risk 
of under dosage which could be dangerous as Ogluo is a rescue-treatment, and which could be more 
dangerous than the risk of over dosage which is mainly nausea and vomiting. 
Therefore, further justification was requested for the higher cut-offs (age 12 years and body weight 45 kg) 
for the 1 mg glucagon dose than for GlucaGen HypoKit (6-8 years old and 25 kg). Although the secondary PD 
endpoints were similar between age groups with regard to mean plasma glucose AUC(0-90), Cmax, and 
tmax, the proposed weight cut-off at 45 kg for the transition to adult dose did not support an optimal dose 
based on glucagon PK parameters in children 6-12 years, indicating a decrease in exposure with increasing 
age group after administration of a fixed 0.5 mg dose, therefore a weight cut-off at 25 kg was recommended 
for the transition to adult dose. As recommended, the applicant revised the paediatric dosage including a 
weight cut-off at 25 kg, for transition to adult dose. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Adult studies 
There were 3 studies executed in adults: the European pivotal study (study XSGP-304), and studies XSGP-

Methods 
Study design  
Study XSGP-304 is a phase 3 multicentre, randomised, controlled, single-blind, 2-way crossover study to 
compare the efficacy and safety of Ogluo with GlucaGen HypoKit (Glucagon) for induced hypoglycaemia 
rescue in adults with T1DM.  
Subjects were randomised to one of two treatment sequences below and received one dose within each 
treatment period separated by a washout period of 7 to 28 days.  
Table 6 Randomised Treatment Sequence 
In each period subjects were confined to clinic at Day -1 before dosing, will undergo the following 
procedures and were discharged at Day 1.  
Day -1: Clinic arrival, assessments specified by protocol, evening meal in clinic.  
Day 1:  
• Overnight monitoring and Morning Procedures. Subjects will be monitored by glucose and will be given 
glucose and/or insulin to optimise plasma glucose levels.  
• Baseline Euglycaemic Steady State (early morning). 
Prior to starting the hypoglycaemia induction procedure, the subject must have stable plasma glucose for at 
least 30 minutes at 95±20 mg/dL (75 to 115 mg/dL [4.17 to 6.38 mmol/L]) at a stable IV insulin infusion 
rate varying no more than ±20% during which plasma glucose must be measured at least every 15±2 
minutes (i.e., at least 3 consecutive values in the target range at 0, 15, and 30 minutes).  
• Hypoglycaemia Induction Procedure (following baseline euglycemic steady state). See ‘Treatments’. 
• Randomisation to one of the treatment sequences shown in the above table.  
• Confirmation of Hypoglycaemic Steady State.  
• Decision to Dose. Once the hypoglycaemic steady state is confirmed, the Investigator will confirm that it is 
appropriate to administer study drug to the subject. The clock time of this “Decision to Dose” will be 
captured in the source documents.  
• Preparation and Administration of Study Drug. Following a decision to dose, subjects were administered a 
subcutaneous injection around the umbilicus with either 1 mg GlucaGen HypoKit or 1 mg Ogluo.  
• Post-dose assessments. Blood glucose levels will be monitored for up to 180 minutes post-dosing. 
Subjects will also complete a questionnaire about symptoms of hypoglycaemia during the hypoglycaemia 
Assessment report

induction phase and for up to 180 minutes after treatment with glucagon.  
Plasma glucose monitoring 
Venous plasma glucose was measured via rapid glucose analyser (YSI 2300 or 2900) before and during 
hypoglycaemia induction, and every 5 minutes post study drug dose through 90 minutes, with ±2 minutes 
for all collections, and at 120, 150, and 180 minutes with ±5 minutes for collections. 
The crossover design of this study is considered valuable in order to decrease between-subject variability. 
The single dose approach to assess efficacy and safety of Ogluo versus GlucaGen HypoKit is adequate as 
Ogluo is not intended to be used regularly but only as rescue medication. The study is not placebo-
controlled which is acceptable as the use of a placebo would not be ethical in hypoglycaemic patients. The 
washout-period of minimum 7 days (up to 28 days) between the 2 treatment administrations is largely 
sufficient to prevent a carry-over taking into account the quite short half-life of glucagon. 
However, blood glucose monitoring post-dose was not continuous so the time to achieve glucose recovery 
was measured with intervals of 5 minutes.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally considered appropriate.  
The applicant provided explanations regarding the country specific protocol amendments concerning changes 
in inclusion and exclusion criteria. The applicant’s explanations that these changes had no impact on subject 
safety or study outcome are considered acceptable. The applicant updated the CSR of study XSGP–304 
identifying country specific changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Moreover, while the targeted indication enholds the complete diabetes mellitus group, only T1DM patients 
and no T2DM patients were included. What’s more, there were many types of patients excluded from the 
Clinical study, which is accepted for this setting, but the actual-use study is planned to include the use of 
Ogluo in these excluded patients.  
In addition, insulinoma was an exclusion criterion in the Phase 3 studies. In the EU proposed SmPC, the 
following warning is included: “Glucagon reacts antagonistically towards insulin and caution should be 
observed if Ogluo is used in patients with insulinoma.”. However, the below warning is considered more 
informative: 
“In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon may produce an initial increase in blood glucose. 
However, glucagon administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) 
stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycaemia. A patient developing 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia after a dose of glucagon should be given glucose orally or intravenously.” This 
has been implemented by the applicant. The risk of “Hypoglycaemia in patients with insulinoma or 
glucagonoma” has been reclassified by the applicant as a risk not considered important for inclusion in the 
list of safety concerns.  
There was only 1 European study site i.e. Austria (besides 4 in the US) in the ‘European Phase 3 study’ 
XSGP-304 and it was not clear how many patients were recruited at this EU site. It was clarified by applicant 
that the only Investigational Site was in Austria, where 35 Subjects were screened and 32 enrolled. The 
XSGP-304 study utilised European marketed comparator product (GlucaGen HypoKit; Novo Nordisk) at all 
clinical study sites in Europe and North America. 
Treatments 
Hypoglycaemia was induced through an insulin induction procedure to a target glucose level of <54 mg/dL 
(3.0 mmol/L). This target level is adequate as in line with the ADA 2019 paper which states that a blood 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 43/114 
 
 
 
 
 
concentration <54 mg/dL is the threshold at which neuroglycopenic symptoms begin to occur and requires 
immediate action to resolve the hypoglycaemic event (Level 2 hypoglycaemia). An insulin dosing algorithm 
was used in order to maintain a steady state of hypoglycaemia.  
Additionally, the IV insulin infusion was not stopped until 5 minutes after the subject’s first plasma glucose 
was <54 mg/dL, per European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific advice 2018, to mimic potential real-world 
scenarios in which insulin may cause clinically important hypoglycaemia. The EMA SA recommended this in 
order to be more open to the use of the 30-minute time point for measurement of the primary endpoint; 
however, the provided earlier time points were also assessed and analysed (see statistical comments). 
After a confirmatory plasma glucose of <54 mg/dL and a hypoglycaemic steady state was obtained, the 
subject was administered (time point of administered dose) study drug SC to the abdomen around the 
umbilicus with either Ogluo or HK per the randomised assignment. The time point of the investigator’s 
“decision to dose” was also documented.  
However, study glucagon was not administered in more severe hypoglycaemic episodes (if the PG was below 
42 mg/dL). Consequently, the effect of Ogluo in more severe situations seen in clinical practice, such as loss 
of consciousness or seizures, was not examined. Although this is endorsed for ethical/safety reasons, during 
the EMA SA, it was recommended to perform an actual-use study.  
In this study, Configuration A (auto-injector) was used. During the EMA SA, it was indicated that if it could be 
shown in XSGP-101 that the PK and PD parameters of both configurations were similar within the usual 
bioequivalence margins, extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from Configuration A (auto-injector) to 
Configuration B (pre-filled syringe) is possible. Since chromatographic interference was observed during 
sample analysis, the applicant was asked to justify the reliability of the measured glucagon concentrations. 
The applicant could not exclude that a portion of the study samples are not determined accurately, precluding 
a definite conclusion on PK equivalence. However, it is acknowledged that the PD response is most relevant 
for the desired action of Ogluo and PD equivalence was demonstrated between both configurations in this 
study.  
Objectives 
Primary: 
To demonstrate that Ogluo 1 mg (test) was not inferior to GlucaGen HypoKit 1 mg (reference), in subjects 
with T1D in a state of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. 
Secondary: 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Ogluo 1 mg versus GlucaGen HypoKit 1 mg in the study population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is an alternate combined endpoint: PGR as defined by  
 
 
either a plasma glucose concentration ≥70 mg/dL (≥3.88 mmol/L) within 30 minutes of study drug 
injection (PGR 1) OR  
an increase in plasma glucose concentration ≥20 mg/dL (≥1.11 mmol/L) within 30 minutes of study 
drug injection (PGR 2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 44/114 
 
 
 
 
For the primary endpoint, treatment groups were compared for rates of achieving a positive PGR. 
Secondary:  
1. Rate of achieving a plasma glucose concentration ≥70 mg/dL (≥3.88 mmol/L) within 30 minutes from 
injection of study drug. 
2. Rate of achieving an increase in plasma glucose concentration ≥20 mg/dL (≥1.11 mmol/L) within 30 
minutes from injection of study drug. 
3. Rates of positive symptomatic response, defined as relief of neuroglycopenic symptoms 30 minutes from a 
decision to dose. 
4. Rates of positive treatment response, defined as exhibiting either a positive PGR or a positive symptomatic 
response. 
5. Time to a positive PGR from injection of study drug. 
6. Time to administer study drug from time to a decision to dose. 
7. PD characteristics of mean plasma glucose concentration (0 to 90 minutes post dose), Cmax, tmax, AUC0-
90min, and area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 180 minutes (AUC0-180min). 
8. Time to (a) initial relief and (b) complete resolution of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia from a decision to dose. 
9. Time to resolution of the overall feeling of hypoglycaemia from a decision to dose. 
10. Safety endpoints, including AE/SAE rates, and changes in vital signs, laboratory variables, and PE/ECG 
findings. 
11. Tolerability endpoints measured at 30, 90, and 180 minutes post dosing, including Draize scale scores for 
injection site erythema and oedema as assessed by the investigator, and injection site discomfort and 
duration as assessed by subject questionnaire responses. 
To describe and compare hypoglycaemia symptom relief/resolution of the 2 treatments, a hypoglycaemia 
questionnaire was used that measured severity of 4 neuroglycopenic symptoms (dizziness, blurred vision, 
difficulty in thinking, and faintness), and 4 autonomic symptoms (sweating, tremor, palpitations, and feeling 
of nervousness), as well as a global feeling of hypoglycaemia. 
The secondary endpoints take both time points into account, in line with the EMA SA: from decision to dose 
and from administered dose.  
In addition there were some comments about the use of symptomatic scores a.o. whether they are reliable 
as it might be difficult for patients to assess symptoms as they are in a state of induced hypoglycaemia or 
recovering from it. 
Sample size 
The described method for the sample size calculation does not take into account clinical aspects as required 
in the guideline EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99.  
The sample size calculation is based on assumptions with respect to rates 0.20 and 0.25, which are clearly 
not realistic cfr. Clinical study report XSCP-304 p62-63. The guideline on the choice of the non-inferiority 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 45/114 
 
 
 
 
margin stipulates that contingencies have to be made in case the rates are not realistic, there is no alternate 
plan for testing to be found in the SAP. The unrealistic rates have resulted in an endpoint that could not be 
tested in a valid manner (success rates near to 100%).  
Sample size calculations are based on rate ratios, testing is performed on differences. The sample size 
calculation should correspond with the testing procedure or, if this is not the case, a reasoning has to be 
provided to show that the approach was conservative in the sense that the sample is most likely to be higher 
than if a corresponding calculation was performed. The sample size calculation was deemed not acceptable. 
Therefore, a rationale for the rates 0.20 and 0.25 used to calculate the sample size in study XSCP-304 was 
required. The applicant provided a rationale for the choices of 0.20 and 0.25 in the sample size calculation, 
which was accepted.  
Randomisation  
Randomisation was a permuted random block assignment, stratified by clinical site. The subjects were 
randomly assigned to receive either Treatment Sequence 1 (Ogluo → GlucaGen HypoKit) or Treatment 
Sequence 2 (GlucaGen HypoKit → Ogluo). 
Blinding (masking) 
The subject, but not the investigator and clinical staff, was blinded (single-blind design). There were no 
unblinding requirements needed for the study. The subject’s ability to see the injection equipment and 
procedure also was obstructed by use of a blindfold placed prior to dosing.  
The results of the Subject Study Drug Assignment Questionnaire used to demonstrate the success of the 
blinding as presented in the Listing of study drug assignment Questionnaire Per-Protocol Population showed 
that 78 of subjects (67.8%) were able to guess the actual study treatment per sequence. This finding 
questioned the success of the blinding. The applicant discussed the possible impact of this finding on the 
clinical trial results, i.e. hypoglycaemia symptoms relief/resolution endpoints. It is acknowledged that the 
applicant had put in place several measures to assure the blinding, but taking into account the results of the 
Subject Study Drug Assignment Questionnaire and the fact that the symptoms scores for 
hypoglycaemia/neuroglycopenia are subjective, the possible impact of this finding on the clinical trial results, 
could not be excluded. However, taking into account that the primary and secondary objectives endpoints of 
the study has been achieved, the issue is not further pursued.  
Statistical methods 
The treatment of missing data has to be related to the (presumed) mechanism of missing data generation 
and conservative with respect to the decision in favour of the treatment proposed. It is unclear how the 
assumption of failure would be conservative with respect to the statistical test. 
Therefore, an explanation is required regarding how the missing data approach is linked to the possible 
missing data mechanism. The missing data is most likely to a missing data mechanism related to the 
efficiency of the treatment. The missing data approach that consists of not taking into account the missing 
data might therefore introduce a bias and results need to be confirmed through a robustness analysis. 
However, this issue is not pursued.

The method of transition from the glucose concentration measures every five minutes to the time to PGR. 
Such a transition underlies the time to event analysis and is also relevant for the frequency tables with 5 min 
time interval classes. The method of transition can be influential with respect to the tables and time to event 
analysis. 
Therefore, a specification on how mathematically technical the sequential data from the discrete 
measurements of glucose concentration about every five minutes where transformed into time to PGR event 
data and used to generate frequency tables with 5 min time interval classes is required. However, data 
represented in tables provided were in contradiction with data represented in post-hoc figure provided. The 
data represented in some provided tables as the basis for the B/R analysis are an underestimate when 
compared to data represented in certain figures. Therefore, the applicant was requested to provide 
discretisation’s based on different interpolation strategies on patient level in order to provide robustness for 
the B/R analysis. Changes to the interval 30≤ and ≤35 into 30≤ and <35 to make intervals more equilibrated 
were provided. And the applicant was also requested to clarify how the discretisation, refinements, and 
interpolations have been performed for each of the figure, post hoc table, and the tables created.  
Due to the extremely high percentage of recovery at 30 min, no valid statistical comparison can be made 
based on the used primary endpoint between Ogluo and HypoKit in responder rate. 
Despite the 5 min continuation of insulin administration after hypoglycaemia threshold (54 mg/dL) has been 
reached, and the alteration to take into account the effect of this continuation, the endpoint has proven to be 
insensitive to the detection of potential differences between Ogluo and HypoKit.  
If incidence rates at a fixed moment cannot be estimated with enough precision, the resulting confidence 
intervals are unreliable and thus the comparison with thresholds to establish non-inferiority, independent of 
the procedure to establish the intervals and thresholds. 
In the SA it was suggested based on available data that the original endpoint would be insensitive to detect 
any potential differences between Ogluo and HypoKit. Therefore, a suggestion was made to provide 
assessment and analysis of earlier time points. The CSR nor in the SAP analysis of earlier type points was 
subject to confirmatory testing strategy. 
A difference in failure rate of 5% at 30 min is rather arbitrary and does not reflect the degree of failure which 
is of utmost importance with respect to the condition intended to treat. Therefore the test can only be 
accessory to a positive benefit risk analysis if a clinical relevant amount of patients have a high degree of 
failure. From the data provided in the study report of trial XSGP-304, it is clear that a rather substantial 
amount of an estimated 7.9% of patients only had sufficient response (positive PGR) after more than 20 min. 
Also the reported average time to first positive plasma glucose response after study drug injection showed an 
estimated increase of 4.12 min with a high variability for the Ogluo (SD = 4.9 min). The latter is a relatively 
rough indicator of possible individual problems - outliers in agreement with data presented. It is paramount 
to investigate why a substantial amount of individuals might not benefit from treatment due to the possible 
consequences in the benefit/risk assessment.  
If the average of 14.57 min and standard deviation of 4.905 min are considered to be good estimates of the 
true mean and standard deviation of the time to first plasma glucose response after study drug injection, and 
one assumes a normal distribution for Ogluo, then 5% of patients will have a first positive plasma glucose 
response after 22.638 min, the HypoKit value being 13.579 min. The estimated time to have 95% of patients 
to reach first positive plasma glucose response after drug injection is 9.059 min earlier for HypoKit compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 47/114 
 
 
 
 
to Ogluo. Clarity was needed with respect to the distributions of the time to PGR its distribution. There was 
no clear characterisation of patients with a high time to PGR time for Ogluo.  
Testing the non-inferiority at an earlier stage as suggested in the SA (20 min) would not solve the problem of 
the presence of cases with a substantial time to response or give insight in the high observed variability of 
the response to Ogluo, making it an unreliable treatment when comparing it with HypoKit (estimated 
standard deviation 4.905 min for Ogluo compared to 1.902 min for the HypoKit). At the time point of 20 min 
suggested by SA all treatments with HypoKit were successful, therefore testing would be relevant only as 
from 15 min, but it would not reflect the risk of prolonged delay in treatment effect. 
The log rank test used to compare the time to event endpoints is a test for non-parametric comparison of 
hazard functions developed in the context of survival analysis in the presence of censuring. It is standard 
practice to compare continuous repeated measures data with a paired t-test, if the difference is sufficiently 
normal distributed or if the sample size is sufficiently large to claim robustness with respect to deviations 
from normality. 
The applicant was requested to perform a t-test based on a two-sided 95% CI for non-inferiority margins of 3 
min for time from decision to dose to positive plasma glucose response. These analyses have been provided.  
The cross-over design is adequate to filter out the interindividual variability but cannot filter out starting 
conditions.  
A substantial amount of patients have to wait 20 min or more before positive plasma glucose level is reached: 
21.1%  time  from  dose  and  16.7%  time  from  decision  to  dose.  The  number  of  patients  that  had  to  wait  30 
minutes or more is 3.1%, also when considering time from decision to dose. When extrapolating to the diabetic 
patient population these percentages can result in a substantial amount of patients.  
The individual glucose level curves for study XSGP-304 are provided accompanying the study report of trial 
XSGP-304. From the individual glucose level curves provided one can observe that the glucose concentration 
curve is reasonably linear in the period of interest [0 min; 30min]. Therefore, the angle of a linear 
approximation of the measurement points within this interval represent a rate of cure. It makes sense to 
analyse the slope, the rate with which the patient recovers due to treatment through regression modelling 
based on glucose concentration measurements between administration and 30 min after administration. This 
analysis has the advantage to separate the effect of the dosing from the initial effect of delay in dosing and 
can be combined with expected and possibly failed treatment from literature (systematic literature review 
and meta-analysis).

Figure 7 Subject Disposition in Study XSGP-304 
Recruitment 
Of the 132 patients that were randomised, 123 patients completed the study. Nine (9/132; 6.8%) subjects 
withdrew early from the study (5/66 [7.6%] subjects in the Ogluo arm and 4/66 [6.1%] subjects in the 
GlucaGen HypoKit arm). For the 5 subjects in the Ogluo arm, reasons for early withdrawal were subject 
withdrawal (3 subjects withdrew for personal reasons) and AE (abdominal pain in 1 subject and 
hypoglycaemia in 1 subject). Four subjects in the GlucaGen HypoKit arm discontinued early from the study (3 
subjects withdrew for personal reasons and 1 subject was withdrawn by the investigator [unable to reach 
hypoglycaemia]). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The CSR mentioned that two protocol amendments have been made to the original protocol dated 06 August 
2018, as presented in the following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 49/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 7 Summary of Protocol Amendments 
According to this table, the last version of the protocol is Version 2 dated 17 Dec. 2018. The CSR mentions as 
the last version of the protocol as Version 2.1 dated 17 Dec. 2018 (submitted in the MAA documentation). 
The applicant was required to clarify this taking also into account that several inconsistencies related to 
inclusion and exclusion criteria between the CSR and Version 2.1 of the protocol dated 17 Dec. 2018 have 
been found. The applicant provided explanations regarding the country specific protocol amendments. In the 
further responses provided, the applicant updated the CSR of study XSGP–304 identifying country specific 
changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Baseline data 
The study included 37 males (53.0%) and 29 (47.0%) females. Patients ranged from 19 to 72 years of age, 
with a mean age of 39.5 years. The duration of T1DM ranged from 2 to 56 years. Overall, 123/132 (93.2%) 
were white, and mean BMI was 27.0 kg/m². Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between

treatment groups. However, taking into account the cross-over design of the study, balance between 
treatment arms is not an issue. Only 7 (6.8% of) the included subjects were non-white of which 2 Black or 
African American, 6 Asian, and 1 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. 
No data on baseline characteristics related to the T1DM (like HbA1c, insulin modality/use/dose, history of 
severe hypoglycaemia event – except for some exclusion criteria) are provided in the MA dossier. 
No patients with T2DM were included in the study population while the intended indication is both T1DM and 
T2DM patients with severe hypoglycaemia. During the EMA SA, it was recommended to perform an actual-
use study to explore how T2DM patients may benefit from Ogluo. The detailed plan of a post-marketing trial 
with including T1DM and T2DM patients was indeed performed. 
The number of elderly patients included in the clinical trial was small (only six patients [4.5%]); taking into 
account their increased hypoglycaemia risk, their reduced ability to recognise hypoglycaemia symptoms and 
communicate their needs it would have been relevant for the intended population to include more elderly 
patients. Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 included 15 patients of 65 years old, no patients 75 years old and 
above were included. Therefore, the SmPC mentions that efficacy and safety data for Ogluo are very limited 
in patients aged 65 years and absent in patients aged 75 and above and a sufficient number of elderly 
patients will be included in the planned actual-use study. 
Numbers analysed 
Table 8 Summary of Analysis Populations (All Randomised Subjects) 
Of the ITT Population consisting of 132 patients, 17 patients were excluded from the PP population consisting

population), 6 patients with a major protocol deviation, 9 patients who withdrew early. For one patient, the 
reason for the exclusion from the PP population was not found in the dossier. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: Positive PGR 
The numbers of subjects achieving a plasma glucose >70 mg/dL or rise ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes of 
dosing were similar between treatment groups: 99% for Ogluo subjects and 100% for HK subjects for the 
mITT population, and 100% of subjects in both treatment groups for the PP population.

Non-inferiority analysis 
In accordance with EMA SAWP 2018, for the primary endpoint, treatment groups were compared for failure 
rate differences for plasma glucose response (PGR). Risk difference in rates of failing to achieve the primary 
endpoint were assessed for Ogluo versus HK (used as reference) and the associated 95% CIs presented. For 
non-inferiority testing, calculations were conducted with stratification by site taken into consideration. Non-
inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in failure rates is 
≤5%. Analysis of the primary endpoint (plasma glucose >70 mg/dL or rise ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes of 
dosing) by population and treatment for all randomised subjects met the predefined criteria for non-
inferiority (difference in failure rates is ≤5%; see table below).

A comparison of the mean plasma glucose concentration at 30 minutes post-dose in Study XSGP-304 is 
shown in the table below. Overall Ogluo and HK were similar for this endpoint and both groups had mean and 
median values that were well above 70 mg/dL. The mean plasma glucose in the Ogluo group was 2 standard 
deviations above 70 mg/dL, indicating a robust response.

Rate of achieving a positive PGR1 – rate of achieving a positive PGR2 
The number of subjects with a positive PGR 1 at 30 minutes post dose was similar between treatment 
groups: 99% (n=126) for Ogluo subjects and 100% (n=123) for GlucaGen HypoKit subjects in the mITT 
Population and 100% in both treatment groups in the PP Population. Analysis of positive PGR 1 by population 
and treatment for all randomised subjects met the predefined criteria for non-inferiority (difference in failure 
rates is ≤5%). 
The exact same results were observed for PGR2. 
Rates of Positive Symptomatic Response 
Positive symptomatic response was defined as relief of neuroglycopenic symptoms within 30 minutes from a 
decision to dose. Rates of positive symptomatic response from time of decision to dose were similar between 
treatment groups at all time points for the mITT Population. At 30 minutes post dose, 34/39 subjects 
(87.2%) in the Ogluo group and 29/35 subjects (82.9%) in the GlucaGen HypoKit group had achieved 
positive symptomatic response. Similar results were observed with the ITT Population., Rates of positive 
symptomatic response from time of decision to dose were higher in the Ogluo group compared to the 
GlucaGen group at all time points for the PP Population. At 30 minutes post dose, 33/35 subjects (94.3%) in 
the Ogluo group had achieved positive symptomatic response while 29/35 subjects (82.9%) in the GlucaGen 
HypoKit group had achieved positive symptomatic response. Analysis of positive symptomatic response by 
population and treatment for all randomised subjects did not meet the predefined criteria for non-inferiority 
due to a greater ratio of failing in the GlucaGen HypoKit group.  
Rates of Positive Treatment Response 
Positive treatment response was defined as exhibiting either a positive PGR (within 30 minutes from injection 
of study drug) or a positive symptomatic response (within 30 minutes from a decision to dose). 
The number of subjects having a positive treatment response by 30 minutes post dose was similar between 
treatment groups: 99% for Ogluo subjects and 100% for GlucaGen HypoKit subjects in the mITT Population; 
similar results in the ITT Population and 100% in both treatment groups in the PP Population. 
Analysis of positive treatment response by population and treatment for all randomised subjects met the 
predefined criteria for non-inferiority (difference in failure rates is ≤5%).

However, all were well within the clinically meaningful timeframe of 30 minutes of study drug administration. 
Study Drug Preparation Time 
Time required from a decision to dose to complete preparation and administration of study drug was 
statistically significantly faster in the Ogluo group compared to the HK group (P-value <0.05, Log rank Test) 
in all 3 populations:

Table 18  Summary of Glucagon Preparation Time (Seconds) by Treatment (mITT and PP 
Populations), Phase 3 Study XSGP-304 
These findings have important ramifications during real-world use of the product by laymen caregivers of 
diabetic patients who would likely need even more time to prepare HK than the licensed and trained 
pharmacists in this study. Additionally, the rate of successful preparation and delivery of full dose glucagon 
by caregivers in pre-hospital, emergency situations is low (<13%) with lyophilised powder glucagon kits (Yale 
et al., 2017). 
Time to Symptom Relief  
Time to symptom relief was evaluated with symptom relief of hypoglycaemia being defined as a return to a 
score (average neuroglycopenic symptom score [ANS], average autonomic symptom score [AAS], and 
average total symptom score [ATS]) no more than one unit above baseline symptoms during the euglycemic 
baseline period, where the baseline symptom is the last values of score (ANS, AAS, and ATS) just before IV 
push dose of insulin. 
a) Time to initial relief  
For the mITT Population, mean time to relief of autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
were similar between treatment groups.

Overall, times to symptom relief after a decision to dose were generally similar between treatment groups. 
However, for the Per-Protocol Population, subjects who received Ogluo had statistically significantly faster 
neuroglycopenic symptom relief compared to subjects who received HK (10.51 minutes vs.13.98 minutes, 
respectively; P=0.023).  
b) Time to Complete Resolution  
Time to symptom resolution was defined as a return to a score (ANS, AAS, and ATS) of 1.0, meaning all 
individual symptom scores within the domain had a score of 1 = absent.

In the ITT Population analyses, similar results were observed in all efficacy endpoints. 
In summary, the study demonstrated that Ogluo was non-inferior when compared to GlucaGen HypoKit 
based on analysis of positive PGR: 99% for Ogluo patients and 100% for HK patients in the mITT Population 
and 100% of subjects in both treatment groups in the PP Population achieved positive PGR within 30 minutes 
post-dose.  
However, the time to achieve positive PGR as of administration of study drug was 4-4.5 minutes longer 
(14.5-15 versus 10.5 minutes) for Ogluo versus HK and more HK subjects achieved positive PGR earlier than 
Ogluo:  
- at 10 minutes post-dose, more than 2 times the number of HK subjects (cumulative: 109 patients (88.6%) 
achieved a positive PGR than Ogluo patients (cumulative: 47 patients (37.0%)).  
- at 15 minutes post-dose, all mITT patients (100%) treated with HK had a positive PGR, while still 28 
patients (22.0%) in the mITT and 26 patients (20.9%) in the PP Ogluo group had not yet achieved a positive 
PGR  
- at 20 minutes post-dose, still 10 patients (7.9%) in the mITT and 7 patients (6.1%) in the PP Ogluo group 
had not yet achieved a positive PGR = delay of >5 minutes 
- at 25 minutes post-dose, still 5 (3.9%) patients in the mITT and 5 patients (2.6%) in the PP Ogluo group 
had not yet achieved a positive PGR = delay of >10 minutes 
- at 30 minutes post-dose, still 1 (3.9%) patient in the mITT Ogluo group had not yet achieved a positive 
PGR = delay of >15 minutes (all achieved this in the PP group) 
- only at 35 minutes post-dose, all Ogluo mITT patients had achieved this so the last patient had a delay of 
up to 20 minutes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 57/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This longer time is not considered clinically relevant by the applicant as they were all still within the 
predefined 30 minutes after dosing, and will be shortened in clinical practice thanks to the about 1 minute 
shorter time to prepare study drug between the ready-to-use Ogluo and the to-be-reconstituted HK.  
Although analysis of symptomatic responses by treatment did not meet the predefined criteria for non-
inferiority because of a greater ratio of HK patients not achieving sufficient symptomatic response, analysis of 
positive treatment response (successful plasma glucose recovery or successful symptom recovery) by 
treatment did meet the predefined criteria for non-inferiority in all analysed populations. 
This slower effect (4-4.5 minutes longer in time to achieve recovery) has been properly reflected in the 
SmPC.  
The gain considering no reconstitution is necessary is estimated to be only 1 minute which would mean that 
there still is a delay of 3 to 3.5 minutes. Moreover, the time to recovery of 14.8 minutes (versus 10.4 
minutes for HK) is only a mean value with important variability as the standard deviations were respectively 
5.4 and 1.9 minutes.  
When looking at the responders per time interval for Ogluo (mITT): 18 (14.2%) patients took 15 to 20 
minutes, 5 patients (3.9%) took 20 to 25 minutes, 4 patients (3.1%) took 25 to 30 minutes and 1 patient 
(0.8%) took 30 to 35 minutes to recover. This is in contrast to the HK patients who all took maximum 15 
minutes to recover (and 88.6% took only up to 10 minutes, which was the case for merely 37% of Ogluo 
patients). This means that for more than 20% of Ogluo patients there was a delay of 5 to 20 minutes which 
can put them at risk of serious consequences.  
The SmPC of Glucagen HK mentions that if the patient does not respond within 10 minutes, intravenous 
glucose should be given. If this would be applied to Ogluo patients, this means that 63% of them would need 
to receive IV glucose. 
For the time-point ‘from decision to dose’, only subjective symptomatic results have been submitted and 
there were some comments regarding the use of symptom relief scores; 
- the questionnaires were not validated 
- there are no data on the symptom scores in the dossier (only on the time to relief of symptoms): e.g. 
whether they were high or low in the study, comparable or not in both treatment groups, if there were 
patients without hypoglycaemia symptoms  
- it was questionable whether the results are reliable as it might be difficult for patients to assess symptoms 
as they are in a state of induced hypoglycaemia or recovering from it, and no patients with symptoms of 
severe hypoglycaemia were included. 
The applicant clarified that the not validated score was used as a PRO and that in most of the Phase 3 adult 
TID subjects, the change in symptom scores results were consistent with glucose effects. It is addressed that 
the symptom relief scores still are not validated. However, across trials the symptom scores results were 
consistent with glucose effects, therefore issue was resolved. 
Throughout the phase 3 clinical development programme adult subjects in the Lilly glucagon group or the 
GlucaGen HypoKit group achieved plasma glucose > 70 mg/dL or plasma glucose increase to >20 mg/ dL, 
approx. 4 minutes faster as compared to adult subjects in the Ogluo group, based on ‘Receiving Glucagon’ or 
‘Decision to Dose’, respectively. In the SmPC of the reference product, under Method of administration 
Section 4.2 based on the onset of glucagon action in the GlucaGen HypoKit, there are specific 
recommendations, as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 58/114 
 
 
 
 
“The patient will normally respond within 10 minutes. When the patient has responded to the treatment, give 
oral carbohydrate to restore the liver glycogen and prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia. If the patient does not 
respond within 10 minutes, intravenous glucose should be given”. There were no specific recommendations 
based on the onset of glucagon action in the Ogluo proposed SmPC. 
Because Ogluo has not been re-administered in the clinical trials performed, the recommendation regarding 
the re-administration was not supported by clinical data. However, it is acknowledged that it is a risk 
mitigation measure for the delay in response observed throughout the clinical trials for Ogluo as compared to 
the reference product. Thus, the following recommendation in section 4.2 of the SmPC was added: 
“The patient will normally respond within 15 minutes. When the patient has responded to the treatment, give 
oral carbohydrate to restore the liver glycogen and prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia. If the patient does not 
respond within 15 minutes, an additional dose of Ogluo from a new device may be administered while waiting 
for emergency assistance.” 
However, the applicant should take into account that a second dose of glucagon can stimulate further GLP-1 
receptor and it may cause additional nausea and other adverse drug reactions.  
In the responses provided, the applicant removed this recommendation regarding re-administration of Ogluo. 
However, taking into account the number of subjects who do not responded in 15 minutes in clinical trials 
and the fact that the patient can be in an area where the emergency cannot reach him/her, recommendation 
was the applicant to keep this recommendation.  
Ancillary analyses 
No subgroup analyses were performed based on intrinsic factors. The rationale is supported by EMA Guideline 
on the Investigation of Subgroups in Confirmatory Clinical Trials (EMA, 2019) and based on the following 
categories:  
1. There was no strong reason to expect an inconsistent response to treatment across the different intrinsic 
factors as the treatment response had been extremely consistent across the Phase 3 adult studies and the 
Phase 3 paediatric study (across all age groups). 
2. There was no reason to justify an expectation that an inconsistent treatment response across the different 
intrinsic factors would be observed. 
Therefore, no further investigations were required and none were performed.

XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 
Methods 
Study design 
Study XSGP-301  
This is a Phase 3 non-inferiority, randomised, double-blind, 2-way crossover efficacy and safety trial involving 
80 adult subjects with T1D ages 18 to 75 years to determine the failure rate of Ogluo 1 mg relative to GEK 1 
mg, predominantly White.  
Study XSGP-303  
This is a Phase 3 non-inferiority, randomised, single-blind, 2-way crossover comparative efficacy and safety 
study in 81 adult subjects with T1D ages 18 to 74, predominantly White.  
Both studies involved 2 daytime CRC visits 7 to 28 days apart, with random assignment to treatment 
sequence (i.e., administration of Ogluo 1 mg during one session and GEK 1 mg during the other). 
Study Participants 
Treatments 
In general, the treatment administration procedure (including an insulin induction procedure to induce 
hypoglycaemia) in studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 was similar to the one in study XSGP-304. However, 
there were also some differences including a different comparator (GEK) and the target plasma glucose 
concentration after the insulin induction procedure at which administration of glucagon could occur: 50 mg/dL 
in studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 versus 54 mg/dL in study XSGP-304 to be in line with the IHSG 
guidelines.  
Moreover, as recommended during the EMA SA, in study XSGP-304, the insulin infusion was continued for 5 
minutes after the target plasma glucose concentration of 54 mg/dL was achieved, while in studies XSGP-301 
and XSGP-303, insulin dose was stopped immediately once the target plasma glucose concentration was 
achieved.  
Other differences were the timing of the screening procedures before randomisation (60 days in XSGP-301 
and XSGP-303, and 30 days in XSGP-304), the time of plasma glucose monitoring after study drug 
administration (180 in XSGP-304 and XSGP-303, and 90/240 minutes in XSGP-301), and the fact that time to 
response from the decision was measured in studies XSGP-303 and XSGP-304 but not in study XSGP-301. 
The applicant used the data from study XSGP-301 to implement an insulin dose adjustment algorithm in 
study XSGP-303 in order to avoid achieving nadirs <40 mg/dL that were observed in study XSGP-301.   
Objectives 
XSGP-301 
The primary objective was assessed by the comparison of failure rates of plasma glucose to have a measured 
value >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes of study drug administration.  
Secondary objectives of the study were to compare the PD characteristics of Ogluo vs. GEK, describe and 
compare hypoglycaemia symptom relief of the 2 treatments, describe Ogluo PK in the major ethnicities and 
races in the United States, and compare the safety and tolerability of Ogluo vs. GEK in T1D subjects who 
were in a state of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 61/114 
 
 
 
 
XSGP-303 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the efficacy (return to plasma glucose > 70 
mg/dL) of Ogluo) 1 mg (test) was non-inferior to Lilly Glucagon 1 mg (reference) in T1D subjects who are in 
a state of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Study results were assessed by the comparison of failure rates of 
both the test and reference products to have measured plasma glucose values > 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes 
of administration of treatment.  
The secondary objectives of this study were: to demonstrate the efficacy (return to plasma glucose >70.0 
mg/dL or an increase in plasma glucose ≥ 20 mg/dL at 30 minutes post study drug injection); demonstrate 
the efficacy (return to plasma glucose >70.0 mg/dL or alleviation of all neuroglycopenic symptoms at 30 
minutes post study drug injection); compare the pharmacodynamic characteristics of Ogluo versus Lilly 
Glucagon; describe and compare hypoglycaemia symptom relief of the two products (including a 
hypoglycaemia questionnaire that measured severity of 4 neuroglycopenic symptoms (dizziness, blurred 
vision, difficulty in thinking, and faintness), and 4 autonomic symptoms (sweating, tremor, palpitations, and 
feeling of nervousness), as well as a global feeling of hypoglycaemia); describe and compare the two products 
for preparation time required to inject to the abdomen from a decision to treat; and compare the safety and 
tolerability of Ogluo.  
During evaluation of Study XSGP-301, it was noted that in some instances subjects reported resolution of the 
overall sensation of hypoglycaemia, while still reporting individual symptoms. Consequently, both the “time 
to complete resolution of symptoms” was considered in Study XSGP-303, along with “relief” of symptoms, 
which required aggregate symptoms to return to a level no more than 1 unit higher than the maximum score 
reported during the baseline observation period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 
Primary endpoint: an increase in plasma glucose concentration from below 50.0 mg/dL to greater than 70.0 
mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon. 
XSGP-301 
The combined primary endpoint in study XSGP-304, was not a pre-specified endpoint in study XSGP-301. 
However, it was added in study XSGP-301 ad-hoc before un-blinding as an alternate combined glucose-
response endpoint i.e. an increase in plasma glucose concentration from below 50.0 mg/dL to > 70.0 mg/dL 
or increased > 20 mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon  
The reason for this was that, in about 30% of procedures, nadir glucose of less than 40 mg/dL with an impact 
on the evaluation of the primary endpoint was observed. 
Secondary endpoints:  
 
Pharmacodynamic characteristics, including: plasma glucose AUC, Cmax, Tmax and time to reach >70.0 
mg/dL.  
  Symptoms of hypoglycaemia (if present) as documented using the hypoglycaemia symptom 
questionnaire.  
 
Pharmacokinetic parameters including: descriptive analysis of AUC, Cmax and Tmax of the different 
ethnicities.

XSGP-303 
The combined primary endpoint in study XSGP-304, was included as a secondary endpoint in study XSGP-303 
but was also analysed as an alternate combined endpoint for comparison with study XSGP-304. 
In study XSGP-303 (not in XSGP-301), like in study XSGP-304, some secondary endpoints also used the 
time-point ‘from decision to dose’ (although again for symptomatic endpoints, not for objective endpoints 
related to plasma glucose) and a time-to-event analysis; the total preparation time was also measured. The 
same issues regarding the use of symptom relief scores as formulated for study XSGP-304 are applicable 
here. 
Secondary endpoints:  
  Return of plasma glucose to > 70 mg/dL or clearance of all neuroglycopenic symptoms within 30 minutes 
after receiving glucagon.  
  Return of plasma glucose to > 70 mg/dL or an increase in plasma glucose by ≥20 mg/dL within 30 
minutes after receiving glucagon.  
 
Increase in plasma glucose by ≥ 20.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon.  
  Relief within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon of all neuroglycopenic symptoms present immediately 
after the decision to dose.  
 
 
Pharmacodynamic characteristics, including: plasma glucose AUC, Cmax, and tmax, time to achieve a 
20.0 mg/dL increase, and time to reach >70.0 mg/dL, both from time of glucagon administration and 
from time of the decision to dose.  
Total preparation time required to inject to the abdomen from a decision to treat, as measured between 
the time of “decision to dose” and time of injection.  
  Hypoglycaemia symptom relief using the hypoglycaemia symptom questionnaire, from just after the 
decision to dose to 180 minutes post-injection of glucagon.  
  Safety-related parameters including: Change in Vital signs from just prior to dosing to 180 minutes post-
injection of glucagon, in physical exam findings from Screening to Follow-up, in ECG findings from 
Screening to Follow-up, in standard safety laboratory parameters (e.g., haematology and serum 
chemistry) from Screening to Follow-up; incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs); subjective injection site discomfort as reported by subjects using a 100-mm VAS and other 
questionnaires; Erythema and/or oedema formation at site of injection assessed by an Investigator using 
the modified Draize scale.

Table 22 Subject Disposition Across Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 
Of the 161 randomised subjects in studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, 153 (95.0%) completed the studies. 
There were 2 discontinuations in XSGP-301, and there were 6 discontinuations in XSGP-303. None of the 
discontinuations was due to an adverse event (AE) or intolerance to study drug.  
Of the 6 (7.4%) subjects who terminated early in XSGP-303, 2 (2.5%) withdrew from the study before the 
first treatment (one due to the subject’s decision to withdraw and one due to the investigator’s decision to 
withdraw) and 4 (4.9%) withdrew from the study before the second treatment (all due to the subjects’ 
decision to withdraw).  
Baseline data 
Overall, the majority of subjects in the Phase 3 Pool were male (57.1% Ogluo; 55.4% GEK). Mean age was 
41.1 years (both treatment groups). The majority had a mean duration of diabetes from 11 to 30 years. Like 
in study XSGP-304, the majority of patients was White (89.6% Ogluo; 89.2% GEK). Overall, the demographic 
characteristics between Ogluo and GEK were comparable but taking into account the cross-over design of the 
study, balance between treatment arms was not an issue.

Table 23  Data sets analysed 
In study XSGP-301, 80 subjects were randomised to one of the two sequence groups and were included in 
the ITT population; 79 subjects (98.75%) completed the visits. All 80 subjects (100.0%) received at least 
one dose of study drug and were included in the mITT population. Of the subjects in the mITT population, 77 
subjects (96.25%) received the randomised Ogluo treatment and 78 subjects (97.50%) received the 
randomised Lilly Glucagon treatment; of the subjects randomised to receive Ogluo, 1 subject (1.25%) 
received treatment in the reverse order, 1 subject (1.25%) received Lilly Glucagon at both visits, and 1 
subject (1.25%) withdrew from the study.  
The CSR (section 10.2) mentions that there were 10 major protocol deviations which were excluded from the 
PP analyses, consistent with the SAP approved on 08 August 2017 and according to the Protocol Violation 
Assessment of Protocol XSGP-301 Appendix 16.1.9.1 - Version1.0, approved by the applicant on 10 August 
2017. However, elsewhere, the CSR (section 11.1) mentions only 2 exclusions from the PP population due to 
major protocol deviations. This is due to the fact that, after completion of the SAP and 
adjudication/unblinding by the sponsor and the monitor, a subsequent adjudication was performed and the 
PP population used for the primary efficacy analysis was modified by non-considering as a major protocol

violation any bolus within 20 minutes prior to administration of the study drug. Thus, these subjects have not 
been excluded from the PP population, although Section 7 of Version 1.6 of the protocol mentions that “late 
bolus doses (i.e., within 20 minutes of dosing) should be avoided” and in Protocol Violation Assessment of 
Protocol XSGP-301 both “late bolus doses (i.e., within 20 minutes of dosing)” and “subject’s insulin basal rate 
increased within 20 minutes prior to the study drug administration when the glucose dropping rate of change 
was >1 mg/dl/min” are considered as major protocol violations. As such, only “subject’s insulin basal rate 
increased within 20 minutes prior to the study drug administration” was kept as a major protocol violation 
and only two subjects, one from Ogluo treated and one from GEK treated, have been excluded from the 
primary analysis.  
The impact of the change of the protocol violation classification on the primary efficacy analysis has been 
presented by the applicant. Calculations for the primary endpoint of Dht were done with the PP population 
(i.e., where treatments outcomes were set to missing for visits where Pre-Specified protocol violations 
occurred – that is excluding the 9 subjects) and with the RPP population (i.e., treatments outcomes were set 
to missing for visits where Revised protocol violations occurred – that is including the 9 subjects). 
Based on the test result difference for of Dht failure scores, Ogluo did not satisfy the non-inferiority criterion 
for the pre-specified PP population but did satisfy the non-inferiority criterion for the revised PP population. 
Table 24   
Taking into account the result for the alternate combined glucose-response endpoint which satisfy the non-
inferiority criterion for both pre-specified PP- and revised PP population, the failure to achieve a steady state 
hypoglycaemia for a third of the procedures, and the fact that study XSGP-301 is only supportive for the 
assessment, this issue was not pursued.

Table 25  Analysis Population by Treatment 
In study XSGP-303, of the ITT Population consisting of 81 patients, 8 patients were excluded from the PP 
population consisting then of 73 patients: 2 patients with a major protocol deviation and 6 patients who 
withdrew early. For a last patient, the reason for the exclusion from the PP population was not found in the 
dossier. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 
Of subjects treated with Ogluo, 97.4% of subjects in the mITT Population and 98% of subjects in the PP 
Population achieved a plasma glucose level >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes of dosing, comparable to treatment 
with GEK in which 100% of subjects achieved the primary endpoint (see table below). Thus, simple pooling 
showed that Ogluo and GEK were comparable with respect to success/failure rates on the primary endpoint.

Dosing: Adult Phase 3 Type 1 Diabetic Subjects
Secondary endpoints: 
Plasma Glucose at 30 Minutes Post-dose  
Overall Ogluo and GEK were similar for this endpoint in the adult Phase 3 studies and both groups had mean 
and median values that were well above 70 mg/dL. The mean plasma glucose in the pooled Ogluo group was 
2 standard deviations above 70 mg/dL, indicating a robust response.

Plasma Glucose Increase ≥20mg/dL Within 30 Minutes of Dosing 
Of the subjects treated with Ogluo within these studies, 98.7% (n=152/154) achieved a plasma glucose 
increase ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes, which was comparable to GEK (100%, n=157). 
Mean Time to Plasma Glucose Increase >70 mg/dL or ≥20 mg/dL Increase 
Of the subjects treated with Ogluo within these studies, the mean time to achieve plasma glucose >70 mg/dL 
or increase in plasma glucose >20 mg/dL was 13.8 minutes versus 10.0 minutes for GEK. 
Neuroglycopenic Symptom Relief Within 30 Minutes 
The analyses of the Adult Phase 3 Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Pool demonstrated that Ogluo was 
comparable to GEK based on achieving relief of neuroglycopenic symptoms within 30 minutes after dosing. 
For the mITT analysis, 85.1% (131/154) of the subjects on Ogluo had symptom relief within 30 minutes after 
dosing, while 82.2% (129/157) on GEK experienced relief within 30 minutes. 
Plasma Glucose >70 mg/dL or Neuroglycopenic Symptom Relief Within 30 Minutes 
The analyses of the Adult Phase 3 Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Pool demonstrated that Ogluo was 
comparable to GEK based on an increase in plasma glucose concentration >70 mg/dL or neuroglycopenic 
symptom relief within 30 minutes after dosing. 
Of the subjects treated with Ogluo within these studies, 99.4% (153/154) had a plasma glucose >70 mg/dL 
or neuroglycopenic symptom relief within 30 minutes, which was comparable to GEK (100%). 
XSGP-301 
Primary endpoint: 
Overall, Ogluo did not satisfy the criterion for non-inferiority to GEK based on analysis of failure scores for the 
ITT Population for the primary endpoint (increase in plasma glucose concentration from below 50 mg/dL to 
˃70 mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving study drug). Contributing to the difference in mean failure 
scores were 4 subjects in the Ogluo arm who did not achieve a plasma glucose >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes, 
but, rather, within an average time of 43.2 minutes without receiving glucose or additional intervention 
beyond Ogluo. It was noted that these 4 subjects had a nadir glucose in the range of 26.2 to 40.6 mg/dL, 
well below the protocol-defined plasma glucose target of just under 50 mg/dL. The procedure relied heavily 
on investigator discretion. In some cases, the investigators infused an excessive amount of insulin and even 
increased insulin infusion rates when the plasma glucose rate was on target at 1 mg/(dL*min). This undercut 
the ability to achieve the desired steady state. About a third of the procedures across the treatment groups 
had post-dose glucose concentrations less than 40 mg/dL, illustrating the lack of steady state. Nevertheless, 
only 4 subjects in the study failed to achieve the primary endpoint of plasma glucose above 70 mg/dL in 30 
minutes, a testament to the effectiveness of both products. 
Among the 4 subjects who failed to achieve plasma glucose >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes was 1 of the 2 
subjects with a major protocol violation. When this treatment visit was set to “missing” as per the study 
Statistical Analysis Plan, Ogluo satisfied the criterion for non-inferiority to GEK based on analysis of failure 
scores for the PP Population for the primary endpoint.

Table 28  Test Result of the Difference of Failure Scores (Study XSGP-301) 
Alternate combined endpoint: 
Ogluo satisfied the criterion for non-inferiority to GEK based on analysis of failure scores for both the ITT and 
PP Populations for the alternate combined glucose-response endpoint (an increase in plasma glucose 
concentration >70 mg/dL or increased ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes after study drug administration). Two of 
the subjects who failed to achieve a plasma glucose value >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes did exhibit a rise in 
plasma glucose of ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes of receiving Ogluo. 
Table 29  Summary of the Analysis of Return of Plasma Glucose to >70 mg/dL or an 
Increase in Plasma Glucose by ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes after Dosing, Study XSGP-301 
Secondary endpoints: 
In general, subjects in the GEK treatment group reached a plasma glucose concentration >70 mg/dL earlier 
than subjects in the Ogluo treatment group (GEK: mean of 14.2 minutes [standard deviation: 4.26], Ogluo: 
19.9 minutes [8.51]), from time of study drug administration. 
Median times to achieve this endpoint were 15.0 and 18.5 minutes for GEK and Ogluo, respectively, also from 
time of study drug administration. These differences were not clinically meaningful, given that both the time 
course and extent of relief of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was similar for Ogluo compared with GEK. 
However, these minor differences warranted examination of drug preparation time in further clinical studies, 
to examine plasma glucose recovery times from a decision to dose. 
Mean time to response was longer in both groups, relative to the mean time of just under 12 minutes 
observed for Ogluo in Study XSGP-202. Delays in dosing caused by operational considerations of maintaining 
double-blinding led to the lower nadir plasma glucoses observed in the study, due to the carryover effect of 
IV insulin used to induce hypoglycaemia, likely contributing to this effect. 
Resolution of hypoglycaemia symptoms was similar between the groups. In almost all cases, the resolution of 
these clinical symptoms preceded the return of documented euglycemia. Average hypoglycaemia symptom 
scores were similar between Ogluo and GEK from 0 to 90 minutes post study drug injection. 
Median time to a first response of “No” to the question, “Do you currently feel hypoglycaemic?” and median 
time to resolution of the aggregate hypoglycaemia symptom scores were comparable for Ogluo and GEK. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021

Average time to resolution of the global feeling of hypoglycaemia did not differ significantly between Ogluo 
and GEK. Consequently, it can be concluded that any differences between Ogluo and GEK with respect to PD 
parameters, including mean time to plasma glucose >70 mg/dL, had no effect on resolution of symptoms, an 
important consideration when comparing the clinical efficacy of the products, where restoration of neurologic 
function and oral intake is critical to further medically manage severe hypoglycaemia. 
XSGP-303 
Primary endpoint: 
Ogluo satisfied the criterion for non-inferiority to GEK based on analysis of the primary endpoint (an increase 
in plasma glucose concentration from below 50 mg/dL to ˃70 mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving 
glucagon) for both the ITT and PP Populations. The percentage of subjects meeting the primary endpoint was 
100% for both groups within both analytical populations (see table below). 
All evaluable subjects had successful plasma glucose recovery (> 70 mg/dL) within 30 minutes based on both 
starting point evaluations: Receiving Glucagon and Decision to Dose (see table below).

Ogluo satisfied the criterion for non-inferiority to GEK based on analysis of failure scores for both the ITT and 
PP Populations for the alternate combined glucose-response endpoint (an increase in plasma glucose 
concentration >70 mg/dL or increased ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes after study drug administration). 
Table 31  Summary of the Analysis of Return of Plasma Glucose to >70 mg/dL or an 
Increase in Plasma Glucose by ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes after Dosing, Study XSGP-
303 
Secondary endpoints: 
Ogluo satisfied the criterion for non-inferiority to Ogluo based on analysis of the secondary endpoint of relief 
of neuroglycopenic symptoms by 30 minutes after study drug administration for both the ITT and PP 
Populations. 
Ogluo was therapeutically equivalent to GEK in clinically meaningful effects (i.e. successful restoration of 
normal plasma glucose levels within 30 minutes of drug administration, from a state of insulin-induced severe 
hypoglycaemia) and in terms of the key PD endpoints: plasma glucose Cmax, tmax, and AUC, and plasma 
glucose concentration-by-time curves showed little separation between treatments, when administered SC. 
Time to initial relief of autonomic or neuroglycopenic symptoms was comparable for Ogluo compared to GEK 
from both a decision to dose and from the point of receiving glucagon. Time to a first “No” for the global 
question “Do you currently feel hypoglycaemic?” (i.e. resolution of the global sensation of hypoglycaemia) 
was statistically shorter (by 2.5 minutes), for Ogluo compared to GEK from a decision to dose, but not the 
point of receiving glucagon. Time to resolution of autonomic and neuroglycopenic hypoglycaemia symptoms 
did not differ significantly between Ogluo and GEK from either administration a decision to dose or from 
administration of glucagon. Mean symptom scores over time did not differ significantly between Ogluo and 
GEK. These findings also highlight the fact that any differences between the groups with respect to PD 
variables have no meaningful clinical significance. 
The mean time for plasma glucose recovery after administration of Ogluo was rapid, 12.5 minutes for a 
concentration >70 mg/dL, and 11.4 minutes for a 20 mg/dL increase from baseline. Time to a plasma 
glucose concentration >70 mg/dL was about 2.5 minutes faster from a decision to dose, and about 3.5 
minutes faster following injection of GEK, compared to Ogluo. 
These differences had no impact on relief/resolution of symptoms. Mean time for plasma glucose >70 mg/dL 
following injection of Ogluo was about 6 minutes faster in Study XSGP-303, compared to Study XSGP-301 
and more similar to the results of Study XSGP-202. This finding indicated that the precision of the single 
investigator in Study XSGP-202 was achieved in a multi-centre study, Study XSGP-303, and validated the use 
of the single-blind study design.

Ogluo required significantly less drug preparation time than did GEK (27.3 vs. 97.2 sec), which required 
reconstitution, based on comparison of means in both the mITT and PP Populations.  
Table 32  Mean Drug Preparation Time (Seconds) (ITT Population) XSGP-303  
In study XSGP-301, the criterion for non-inferiority based on the primary endpoint versus GEK was not 
achieved. This was explained by the applicant by the fact that 4 patients in the Ogluo group had a nadir 
below 40 mg/dL. However, the FDA CDER Clinical Review Template (page 47) mentions 5 patients with a 
nadir <40 mg/dL with patients both in the Ogluo and in the GEK group. According to the applicant, these 
patients had an average time to response of 43.2 minutes without receiving glucose or additional intervention 
beyond study drug administration. 
Therefore, the applicant was requested to provide the information for all patients in XSGP-301 with a pre-
dose or post-dose nadir <40 mg/dL and for all patients with a failure to reach the primary endpoint. The 
applicant provided a Post-hoc table Listing of patients with a nadir plasma glucose <40 mg/dL All 
Randomised Subjects as asked.  
These patients approach the setting of severe hypoglycaemia (which is the indication of Ogluo) better than 
the other studies in which patients with a plasma glucose <42 mg/dL could not be treated with glucagon, and 
these appear to have an additional risk as they require a long time to achieve a BG > 70 mg/dL. The 
applicant discussed the risk accompanying the long time to achieve a glucose > 70mg/dL adequately.  
In order to align the primary endpoint across the 3 Phase 3 adult studies (301, 303, and 304), the data from 
studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 were analysed according to the primary endpoint of study XSGP-304: an 
alternate combined endpoint consisting of plasma glucose >70 mg/dL or increase ≥20 mg/dL within 30 
minutes of dosing. For this alternate endpoint, the non-inferiority margin was achieved in studies XSGP-301 
and XSGP-303.  
Although all patients in XSGP-303 achieved plasma glucose recovery (> 70 mg/dL) or increase ≥20 mg/dL 
within 30 minutes, the mean time to achieve this was longer for Ogluo than for GEK, both for time from 
administration and for time from decision to dose: 
- plasma glucose >70 mg/dL:  
about 3.5 minutes longer (12.2 minutes versus 8.6 minutes) for time from administration and about 2.5 
minutes longer (13.3 minutes versus 10.7 minutes) for time from decision to dose  
- increase ≥20 mg/dL:  
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 72/114 
 
 
 
 
  
about 3.5 minutes longer (11.4 minutes versus 8.0 minutes) for time from administration and about 2.5 
minutes longer (12.5 minutes versus 10.1 minutes) for time from decision to dose.  
In XSGP-303 (ITT), more GEK patients achieved plasma glucose >70 mg/dL earlier than Ogluo patients, both 
for time from administration of study drug and for time from decision to dose:  
- at 10 minutes, more than 2 times the number of GEK patients (cumulative: 58 patients (74.4%) achieved 
this than Ogluo patients (cumulative: 25 patients (32.9%)).  
- at 15 minutes post-dose and 20 minutes from decision to dose, all GEK patients (100%) achieved this, 
while still resp. 16 patients (21.1%) and 4 patients (5.3%) in the Ogluo group had not yet achieved this 
- at 25 minutes post-dose and 25 minutes from decision to dose, all Ogluo patients had achieved this. 
Like for study XSGP-304, this was not considered clinically relevant by the applicant as the mean values to 
achieve this for Ogluo were all within 15 minutes, the drug preparation time was 70 seconds shorter (27.3 vs. 
97.2 sec) for Ogluo and the time to achieve relief of symptoms was overall similar for Ogluo as for GEK. 
However, like for study XSGP-304 there were some comments regarding the use of symptom relief scores 
which were resolved (see above). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There are only limited data for Ogluo in paediatric patients (31) with only 7 in the 2-<6, 13 in the 6-<12 and 
11 patients in the 12≤18 years old group, all from study XSGP-302. The number of included patients in each 
age group was mentioned in the SmPC. 
For elderly patients, the pooled analysis based on results from studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, showed that 
14 out of 15 patients of 65 years or older achieved plasma glucose levels > 70 mg/dL within 30 minutes 
post-dose. However, there are only very limited data for Ogluo in elderly patients 65 years and above (21 
patients of which 6 in the pivotal study), and none in elderly 75 years and above. This should be reflected in 
the SmPC by stating that efficacy and safety data for Ogluo are very limited in patients aged 65 years and 
above, and absent in patients aged 75 and above. A sufficient number of elderly patients will be included in 
the planned actual-use study.  
Ogluo was not investigated in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. The SmPC states that it can be used 
in these patients and that no dose adjustment is required, which can be supported as it is a rescue-
treatment, and it is in line with another recently approved glucagon product as well as GlucaGen HypoKit. 
XSGP-302 
Methods 
Study design 
Study XSGP-302 is an open-label, sequential treatment efficacy and safety Phase 3 study to evaluate the 
glucose response of Ogluo (Glucagon Injection) in 31 paediatric patients ages 2 to 18 years with T1DM. There 
was no comparison versus a reference product in this study (while a comparator was included in the 
paediatric study of a recently approved glucagon product).  
Treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 73/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were administered insulin to induce a low-normal glycaemic state and then received an age-
appropriate dose of Ogluo in a CRC. During the treatment phase, subjects ages 2 to <12 years completed a 
single treatment visit and received Ogluo 0.5 mg. Subjects ages 12 to <18 years received Ogluo 1 mg at an 
initial treatment visit and were administered Ogluo 0.5 mg at a second visit occurring 1 to 4 weeks later 
(table below). 
Table 33  Treatment sequence 
For safety reasons in this paediatric population, severe hypoglycaemia was not induced in this study; instead, 
a low-normal glycemic state was induced by administration of insulin: a decrease of plasma glucose to a 
target <80 mg/dL. A glucose increase from these low-normal blood glucose values can be accepted as a 
surrogate for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. 
Per the RLD, Eli Lilly Glucagon, 1 mg is the approved dose for treating severe hypoglycaemia in adults, while 
a dose of 0.5 mg is indicated for patients weighing less than 20 kg. The applicant states that results from 
study XSGP-201 have been used based on which – through a weight-exposure model - the transition to the 
adult dose of Ogluo is proposed at 40 to 45 kg, corresponding to the average weight at 12 years of age. As 
per data presented in response, the weight–based exposure modelling analysis has been performed in 
adolescents weighing above 40 kg. No simulations were performed in children below 12 years and weighing 
below 40 kg.  (see also PK section). The proposed weight cut-off at 45 kg for the transition to adult dose did 
not support an optimal dose based on glucagon PK parameters in children 6-12 years, indicating a decrease 
in exposure with increasing age group after administration of a fixed 0.5 mg dose, although the secondary PD 
endpoints were similar between age groups with regard to mean plasma glucose AUC(0-90), Cmax, and Tmax. 
Therefore a weight cut-off at 25 kg was recommended for the transition to adult dose.  
The duration of study participation for individual subjects was approximately 2 to 6 weeks, and the duration 
of the study was 5 months. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To assess the increase in plasma glucose of subjects from baseline to 30 minutes in subjects in a low normal 
glycaemic state after injection of an age-appropriate dose of Ogluo (glucagon injection), in each of three age 
groups (2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years) of paediatric subjects with T1DM.  
Secondary objectives:  
 
In the 12 to < 18-year-old age group, to additionally assess the plasma glucose change from baseline 
to 30 minutes after administration of Ogluo at a dose of 0.5 mg.

Baseline data 
The median ages of enrolled subjects in each age group were 5.3 years (2 to < 6 years group), 11.4 years (6 
to < 12 years group), and 15.6 years (12 to < 18 years group). All subjects were not Hispanic/Latino and the 
majority of subjects in each age group were White (71.4%, 92.3%, and 100% of subjects in the 2 to < 6 
years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years age groups, respectively). There were more female subjects 
than male subjects in the 2 to < 6 years and 12 to < 18 years age groups (71.4% and 54.5%, respectively), 
and more male subjects than female subjects in the 6 to < 12 years age group (61.5%). 
Numbers analysed 
The applicant states that the mITT and PP population are identical as there was no protocol violation while 
there was one major protocol deviation which concerned a study nurse not being documented as having 
received the hands-on training with Ogluo. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Statistically significant increases from Baseline in mean plasma glucose were observed in each age group (p 
< 0.001 for all groups) at 30 minutes following administration of an age-appropriate dose of Ogluo (change 
from Baseline of 81.4 mg/dL [SD=18.3], 84.2 mg/dL [SD=25.3], and 54.0 mg/dL [SD=27.3] in the 2 to < 6 
years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years [1 mg dose] age groups, respectively) (see table below). 
Table 34  Plasma Glucose Before and 30 Minutes After Administration of Ogluo by Age 
Group 
Mean (SD) plasma glucose levels for subjects in the 3 age groups (2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to 
< 18 years age groups) plotted by time showed little separation between age groups. 
In the 12 to < 18 years age group, plasma glucose-response curves did not vary greatly for subjects who 
received 0.5 mg and 1 mg of Ogluo.  
Secondary endpoints: 
Plasma Glucose Response in Paediatric Subjects  
Paediatric subjects receiving an age-appropriate dose of Ogluo consistently achieved an increase in plasma 
glucose >25 mg/dL within 30 minutes. All remaining subjects reached this secondary endpoint without 
glucose therapy or additional intervention.

Paediatric Study (XSGP-302) 
Plasma Glucose Response in Paediatric Subjects  
Age groups were generally similar to each other in mean plasma glucose AUC(0-90), Cmax, and tmax. There 
were no clinically meaningful differences between age groups.  
The Baseline-adjusted mean (SD) AUC(0-90) values were 8147.71 (2162.379), 8001.59 (2510.799), and 
6377.54 (2700.448) min*mg/dL in the 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years age groups, 
respectively.  
The median times to increase by ≥ 25 mg/dL from Baseline in plasma glucose did not differ substantially in 
the 2 to < 6 years, 6 to < 12 years, and 12 to < 18 years age groups (15.0, 15.0, and 20.0 minutes, 
respectively).  
For subjects in the 12 to < 18 years age group, mean plasma glucose AUC(0-90), Cmax, and tmax were 
similar after dosing with 0.5 mg or 1 mg.  
The Baseline-adjusted mean (SD) AUC(0-90) was similar for the 1 mg G-Pen treatment (6377.54 [2700.448] 
min*mg/dL) compared with 0.5 mg Ogluo treatment (7042.85 [2011.071] min*mg/dL) in subjects 12 to < 
18 years. The median time to increase by ≥ 25 mg/dL from Baseline was the same after 0.5 mg and 1 mg 
treatment (20 minutes each). 
Although the increase from baseline in mean plasma glucose at 30 minutes post-dose was statistically 
significant in all age groups, there are some unexpected observations in the age group 12-<18 years versus 
the other age groups even though the administered dose of 1 mg was the double of the 0.5 mg used in the 
other age groups:  
- the glucose increase from baseline (54.0 mg/dL) was much lower than for the other age groups (2-<6 and 
6-<12), (81.4 and 84.2 mg/dL), and this cannot only be explained by a higher baseline glucose level 
- only 81.8% of patients in this group achieved a glucose increase ≥25 mg/dL within 30 minutes while of 
those having received 0.5 mg (other age groups together with the second administration in age group 12-
<18 yo) 96.8% achieved this

- mean time to plasma glucose increase ≥25 mg/dL from baseline was also higher (23.6 minutes versus 16.4 
and 16.2 minutes) 
- lower glucose AUC(0-90) (6377.54 (2700.448) versus 8147.71 (2162.379) and 8001.59 (2510.799) 
min*mg/dL  
- glucose response did not vary greatly after receiving the 0.5 mg dose compared to the 1 mg dose of Ogluo, 
and overall similar PD was observed. 
The applicant was requested to explain and to discuss whether this is due to outliers or not. According to the 
applicant the differences could be explained as follows: subjects (2 to <6 years and 6 to <12 years) likely 
received more glucagon by weight-based exposure. The difference in success rates is likely due to the 
administration of excess residual insulin from the insulin pumps during the 1 mg treatment visits, related to 
the individual study procedures. No outliers were identified.  
Supportive studies 
Human Factors Studies 
The Human Factors Studies were designed to mimic real-life emergency situations, and tested a total of 5 
user groups that included first responders, trained and untrained users, adults and paediatric (adolescent) 
caregivers of people with diabetes. 
The Human Factors Studies submitted for Ogluo only mimic emergency situations without the pressure on 
uninstructed caregivers caused by real-life stress (as would be the case in actual-use studies).  
However, although an emergency situation can never be perfectly simulated, these human factor studies do 
provide some useful information: 
In summary, multiple comparative studies conducted by Xeris and other pharmaceutical companies have 
demonstrated significant usability issues and a lack of functional efficacy with existing glucagon emergency 
kits. 
Conversely, summative human factors studies with Ogluo have validated both product presentations as safe, 
effective, and usable for the intended users in the context of a severe hypoglycaemia emergency. 
Almost all participants in all Human Factors Studies were able to successfully administer Ogluo, in 1 small 
study also in a much higher number of patients than for the comparator GEK:  
- HF2: 14 of 16 participants (88%) were able to successfully administer a rescue injection using Ogluo 
compared with 5 of 16 participants (31%) with the GEK (chi-square test = 10.49, P < 0.05) 
- HF3: 74 of 75 participants (98.7%) successfully administered the rescue injection using the Ogluo 
- HF7 and HF5: All participants (15/15 and 75/75, 100%) performed a successful rescue and injected 
glucagon into the subcutaneous tissue at the labelled injection site. 
Some of the Human Factors Studies for Ogluo also included untrained adolescent users (as young as 12 years 
old) which were able to successfully use Ogluo to carry out the full rescue injection procedure during an 
emergency use context.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The objective of the clinical development programme was to evaluate glycaemic response of Ogluo compared 
to other glucagon products in adult patients; for paediatric patients the glycaemic response in itself was 
examined without a comparison to other products.  
The clinical development programme of Ogluo included 7 clinical trials involving 62 healthy subjects in 1 
phase 1 study (Study XSGP-101), and 300 adult and 31 paediatric subjects with T1D in 2 Phase 2 studies 
(Study XSGP-201 and Study XSGP-202) and 4 Phase 3 studies (XSGP-301, XSGP-303, and XSGP-304 in 
adults and the open-label study XSGP-302 in paediatric subjects 2-18 years old). The 3 controlled Phase 3 
adult clinical studies used other injectable glucagon products as a comparator: the earlier studies XSGP-301 
and XSGP-303 versus the US product Eli Lily glucagon (=GEK) and the pivotal study XSGP-304, designed and 
conducted based on the recommendations of the EMA SA, versus the European product GlucaGen HypoKit 
(=HK).  
There were also 7 human factors studies designed to mimic real-life emergency situations which tested a 
total of 5 user groups including first responders, trained and untrained users, adults and paediatric 
(adolescent) caregivers of people with diabetes.  
However, no actual-use studies were performed yet to investigate the use of Ogluo in stressful real-life 
circumstances while these could have provided data about the effectiveness of Ogluo in a stressful setting 
which is not the case in the Human Factors studies submitted for Ogluo, which only mimic these kind of 
situations without the pressure on uninstructed caregivers caused by real-life stress.  
There were no real dose-selection studies for Ogluo. For adults and adolescents, and for children 2≤6 years 
old the applicant simply used the doses of the reference products (GEK and HK) i.e. resp. 1 mg and 0.5 mg. 
However, for children 6≤12 years old and 25≤45 kg, the dose selection was not well justified and the 
proposed dose differs from the one for the reference products with higher cut-offs proposed for the 1 mg 
glucagon dose for Ogluo (age 12 years and body weight 45 kg) than for the EU product HK (6-8 years old 
and 25 kg). As recommended, the applicant revised the paediatric dosage including a weight cut-off at 25 kg, 
for transition to adult dose, 1 mg.  
The pivotal study in adult study XSGP-304 was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of Ogluo with 
the EU reference product HK for induced hypoglycaemia rescue in adults with T1DM. It was a Phase 3 
multicentre, randomised, controlled, single- blind, 2-way crossover in 132 patients ages 19 to 72 years with 
T1DM, predominantly White. This study was called the ‘European Phase 3 study’ in the EMA SA documents 
although there was only 1 European study site i.e. Austria while there were 4 in the US. T. 35 European 
subjects were screened and 32 enrolled.  
There was no placebo control group which is acceptable as the use of a placebo would not be ethical in 
hypoglycaemic patients. The crossover design of this study was considered valuable in order to decrease 
between-subject variability. The single dose approach is adequate as Ogluo is not intended to be used 
regularly but only as rescue medication. The washout-period of minimum 7 days (up to 28 days) between the 
2 treatment administrations is largely sufficient to prevent a carry-over taking into account the quite short 
half-life of glucagon. Several issues that have been identified with regard to study conduct with potential 
impact on study results regarding blinding and protocol amendments as well as inconsistencies between 
documents regarding batch numbers, inclusion/exclusion criteria and protocol versions have been clarified by 
the applicant.

In addition, an Errata memorandum to the clinical study report XSGP-304 including correct numbering of the 
country-specific changes has been provided. 
The primary endpoint was an alternate combined endpoint (PGR) as defined by either a plasma glucose 
concentration ≥70 mg/dL (≥3.88 mmol/L = PGR1) OR an increase in plasma glucose concentration ≥20 
mg/dL (≥1.11 mmol/L = PGR2) within 30 minutes of study drug injection. 
Hypoglycaemia was induced through an insulin induction procedure to a target glucose level of <54 mg/dL 
(3.0 mmol/L). However, for ethical/safety reasons, study glucagon was not administered if the PG was < 42 
mg/dL which means that the effect of Ogluo in more severe hypoglycaemia seen in clinical practice leading to 
an altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance was not examined. For this, the CHMP 
recommended to perform an actual-use study. The actual-use study will provide data in T2DM patients which 
were not included and in patient types that were excluded in the clinical studies, and in elderly patients. A 
detailed plan of an actual-use post marketing study will include these particular patient populations, and 
study is included in the RMP. 
The SmPC warning regarding insulinoma has been included in the SmPC in line with another glucagon 
containing product as considered more informative.  
Although some of the secondary endpoints take both time points into account (‘from decision to dose’ and 
‘from administered dose’), in line with the EMA SA, the objective endpoints regarding positive PGR are only 
foreseen for the time-point ‘post-dose’ but not ‘from decision to dose’ and there were some comments about 
the use of symptomatic scores (see further). 
Another study in adults study XSGP-301 was conducted (before study XSGP-304) to determine the failure 
rate of Ogluo 1 mg relative to GEK 1 mg in adults with T1DM. It was a Phase 3 non-inferiority, randomised, 
double-blind, 2-way crossover efficacy and safety trial involving 80 adult subjects with T1D ages 18 to 75 
years, predominantly White.  
Another study in adults study XSGP-303 was conducted (before study XSGP-304) to compare efficacy and 
safety of Ogluo 1 mg with GEK 1 mg in adults with T1DM. It was a Phase 3 non-inferiority, randomised, 
single-blind, 2-way crossover comparative efficacy and safety study in 81 adult subjects with T1D ages 18 to 
74, predominantly White. 
Although the treatment administration procedure (including an insulin induction procedure to induce 
hypoglycaemia) in studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 was quite similar to the one in study XSGP-304, there 
were also some differences including another comparator (GEK vs HK), a different target plasma glucose 
concentration after the insulin induction procedure at which administration of glucagon could occur (50 mg/dL 
vs 54 mg/dL) and the fact that insulin dose was stopped immediately once the target plasma glucose 
concentration was achieved (vs continuation for 5 minutes). 
The applicant used the data from study XSGP-301 to implement an insulin dose adjustment algorithm in 
study XSGP-303 in order to avoid achieving nadirs <40 mg/dL like those observed in study XSGP-301. 
Consequently, like in study XSGP-304, the use of Ogluo was not examined in more severe hypoglycaemia in 
study XSGP-303 (see above). 
The primary endpoint in XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 was an increase in plasma glucose concentration from 
below 50.0 mg/dL to greater than 70.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon. 
The combined primary endpoint in study XSGP-304, was not a pre-specified endpoint in study XSGP-301 but 
it was added ad-hoc before un-blinding as an alternate combined glucose-response endpoint i.e. an increase 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 80/114 
 
 
 
 
 
in plasma glucose concentration from below 50.0 mg/dL to > 70.0 mg/dL or increased > 20 mg/dL within 30 
minutes after receiving glucagon. This was also analysed as an alternate combined endpoint in study XSGP-
303 for comparison with study XSGP-304, and was also a secondary endpoint in study XSGP-303. 
In study XSGP-303 (not in XSGP-301), like in study XSGP-304, some secondary endpoints also used the 
timepoint ‘from decision to dose’ (although again for symptomatic endpoints, not for objective endpoints 
related to plasma glucose) and a time-to-event analysis; the total preparation time was also measured.  
Both studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 also used symptomatic relief scores as secondary endpoints for which 
the same comments as listed for study XSGP-304 were applicable and resolved. 
In study XSGP-301, an issue has been identified with regard to study conduct at the level of major protocol 
violations with potential impact on study results. As such, based on the test result difference for Dht failure 
scores, Ogluo did not satisfy the non-inferiority criterion for the pre-specified PP population, defined in the 
protocol based on the initial definitions of the major protocol violations, but did satisfy the non-inferiority 
criterion for the revised PP population, defined after the unblinding and additional adjudication and 
subsequent modification of the major protocol violations. However, taking into account that the result for the 
alternate combined glucose-response endpoint did satisfy the non-inferiority criterion for both pre-specified 
PP- and revised PP population, the failure to achieve a steady state hypoglycaemia for a third of the 
procedures, and the study XSGP-301 is only supportive for the assessment, this issue was not pursued.  
Overall in the 3 adult Phase 3 studies, there are only very limited data in elderly patients 65 years and 
above (21 of which 6 in the pivotal study), and even none in elderly 75 years and above.  
A last study, study XSGP-302, in the paediatric population was conducted to evaluate the glucose response 
of Ogluo (Glucagon Injection) in paediatric patients with T1DM. It was a Phase 3, open-label, sequential 
treatment efficacy and safety study in 31 paediatric subjects with T1DM ages 2 to 18 years, predominantly 
White.  
For ethical reasons, subjects were administered insulin to induce a low-normal glycaemic state (blood glucose 
< 80 mg/dL), instead of the hypoglycaemic state in the adult studies, and then received an age-appropriate 
dose of Ogluo in a CRC.  
During the treatment phase, subjects ages 2 to <12 years completed a single treatment visit and received 
Ogluo 0.5 mg. Subjects ages 12 to <18 years received Ogluo 1 mg at an initial treatment visit and were 
administered Ogluo 0.5 mg at a second visit occurring 1 to 4 weeks later. 
The study had some limitations as the number of patients per age group was low with only 7 in the 2≤6, 13 
in the 6≤12 and 11 patients in the 12≤18 years old group, there was no comparison versus a reference 
product and no hypoglycaemia was induced in the paediatric population (which however can be accepted as a 
surrogate for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia). 
According to the applicant, results from study XSGP-201 have been used through a weight-exposure model 
to propose a transition to the adult dose of Ogluo at 40 to 45 kg, corresponding to the average weight at 
approximately 12 years of age but these data have not been provided nor discussed (see also PK section), 
the doses used in this study were age-based, not weight based. 
As recommended, the applicant revised the paediatric dosage including a weight cut-off at 25 kg, for 
transition to adult dose.  
Human Factors Studies 
The Human Factors Studies submitted for Ogluo only mimic emergency situations without the pressure on 
uninstructed caregivers caused by real-life stress (as would be the case in actual-use studies).  
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 81/114 
 
 
 
 
Almost all participants in all Human Factors Studies were able to successfully administer Ogluo, in 1 small 
comparative study also in a much higher number of patients than for the comparator GEK (88% vs 31%).  
Some of the Human Factors Studies for Ogluo also included untrained adolescent users (as young as 12 years 
old) which were able to successfully use Ogluo to carry out the full rescue injection procedure during an 
emergency use context. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Adult Pivotal Phase 3 study XSGP-304 
In this study, 99% (mITT) and 100% (PP) of Ogluo subjects achieved the primary endpoint (plasma glucose 
>70 mg/dL or rise ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes of dosing), comparable to treatment with HK subjects in 
which 100% of subjects achieved this. This study demonstrated that Ogluo was non-inferior to HK for 
achieving the primary endpoint. 
However, the mean time to achieve positive PGR as of administration of study drug was 4-4.5 minutes longer 
for Ogluo versus HK. Moreover, more HK subjects achieved positive PGR earlier than Ogluo: at 15 minutes 
post-dose, all HK subjects had achieved a positive PGR while still 28 patients (22.0%) in the mITT and 26 
patients (20.9%) in the PP Ogluo group had not; at 20 minutes post-dose, still 10 patients (7.9%) in the 
mITT and 7 patients (6.1%) in the PP Ogluo group had not; at 25 minutes post-dose, still 5 (3.9%) patients 
in the mITT and 4 patients (2.6%) in the PP Ogluo group had not; at 30 minutes post-dose, still 1 (3.9%) 
patient in the mITT Ogluo group had not (all achieved this in the PP group); it is only at 35 minutes post-
dose, that all Ogluo subjects achieved this.  
The applicant considers this not clinically relevant as they were all still within the predefined 30 minutes after 
dosing, and it will be shortened in clinical practice thanks to the about 1 minute shorter time to prepare study 
drug. In addition, when measuring as of the decision to dose (instead of as of administration of study drug) 
and using symptom relief scores, several results were similar or even better for Ogluo versus HK, and 
analysis of positive treatment response (successful plasma glucose recovery or successful symptom recovery) 
by treatment did meet the predefined criteria for non-inferiority in all analysed populations. 
The 4-4.5 minutes longer time to achieve positive PGR have been properly reflected in the SmPC. The gain 
considering that no reconstitution is necessary is estimated to be only 1 minute which would mean that there 
still is a delay of 3 to 3.5 minutes. Moreover, as the time to recovery of 14.8 minutes (versus 10.4 minutes 
for HK) is only a mean value (with important variability as the standard deviations were respectively 5.4 and 
1.9 minutes), it was useful to look at the time interval of the individual patients through the responders per 
time interval for Ogluo: 18 (14.2%) patients took 15 to 20 minutes, 5 patients (3.9%) took 20 to 25 
minutes, 4 patients  (3.1%) took 25 to 30 minutes and 1 patient (0.8%) took 30 to 35 minutes to recover 
versus maximum 15 minutes to recover for HK patients (and 88.6% took only up to 10 minutes, which was 
the case for merely 37% of Ogluo patients). 
This means that for many patients (>20%) there is a delay of 5 to 20 minutes versus HK which should be 
reflected in the SmPC. In this context the CHMP proposed to make a SmPC amendment in section 4.4: 
Delay in response 
Please take into account that in +/- 15% of patients a delay in glucose response of more than 20 minutes 
was observed in the pivotal trial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 82/114 
 
 
 
 
 
The SmPC of the reference product mentions specific recommendations regarding the onset of action which 
should normally be within 10 minutes and the fact that, if this is not the case, IV glucose should be given. As 
requested, specific recommendation have been proposed for Ogluo SmPC specifying that the onset of action 
should normally be within 15 minutes and the fact that, if it is not the case an additional dose of Ogluo from 
a new device may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance. 
Adult Phase 3 studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 
For the pooled data from studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, 97.4% of Ogluo subjects (mIIT) and 98% (PP) 
achieved the primary endpoint (plasma glucose level >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes of dosing), comparable to 
treatment with GEK in which 100% of subjects achieved this.  
However, when looking at the results of study XSGP-301 separately, the criterion for non-inferiority based on 
the primary endpoint versus GEK was not achieved which was explained by the applicant by the fact that 4 
patients in the Ogluo group had a nadir below 40 mg/dL and an average time of 43.2 minutes. Nevertheless, 
these patients approach the setting of severe hypoglycaemia (which is the indication of Ogluo) better than 
the other studies in which patients with a plasma glucose <42 mg/dL could not be treated with glucagon, and 
they appear to have an additional risk as they require a long time to achieve a plasma glucose > 70 mg/dL. 
The data from studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 were analysed according to the primary endpoint of study 
304 using an alternate combined endpoint (plasma glucose >70 mg/dL or increase ≥20 mg/dL within 30 
minutes of dosing) for which the non-inferiority margin was achieved in both studies.  
However, like in study XSGP-304, also in study XSGP-303, the mean time to achieve plasma glucose 
recovery (> 70 mg/dL) or increase ≥20 mg/dL was longer for Ogluo than for GEK: about 3.5 minutes for time 
from administration (resp. 12.2 minutes versus 8.6 minutes and 11.4 minutes versus 8.0 minutes) and about 
2.5 minutes for time from decision to dose (resp. 11.4 minutes versus 8.0 minutes and 12.5 minutes versus 
10.1 minutes). Moreover, also like in study XSGP-304, more GEK patients (ITT) achieved plasma glucose >70 
mg/dL earlier than Ogluo patients, both for time from drug administration and for time from decision to dose: 
at 15 minutes post-dose and 20 minutes from decision to dose, all GEK patients (100%) achieved this, while 
still resp. 16 patients (21.1%) and 4 patients (5.3%) in the Ogluo group had not; it is only at 25 minutes 
post-dose and from decision to dose, that all Ogluo patients had achieved this. 
Nonetheless, like for study XSGP-304, this is not considered clinically relevant by the applicant as the mean 
values to achieve this for Ogluo were all within 15 minutes, the drug preparation time was 70 seconds 
shorter (27.3 vs. 97.2 sec) for Ogluo and the time to achieve relief of symptoms was overall similar for Ogluo 
as for GEK.  
In study XSGP-301, there was a modification in the PP population used for the primary efficacy analysis after 
completion of the SAP and adjudication/unblinding by the sponsor and the monitor, by non-considering as a 
major protocol violation any bolus within 20 minutes prior to administration of the study drug, which had an 
impact on the primary efficacy analysis in the pre-specified PP population, but no impact on the alternate 
combined endpoint efficacy analysis conducted in the pre-specified PP population.

EMA/6676/2021

In each age group, statistically significant (p < 0.001) increases from Baseline in mean plasma glucose were 
observed at 30 minutes post-dose. All 30 evaluable patients achieved a target glucose increase of at least 25 
mg/dL and the mean time to achieve plasma glucose increase ≥25 mg/dL from baseline was 19 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
However, although the increase from Baseline in mean plasma glucose at 30 minutes post-dose was 
statistically significant in the age group 12≤18 years, there were some uncertainties due to the unexpected 
observations versus the other age groups (even though the administered dose of 1 mg was the double of the 
0.5 mg used in the other age groups) regarding the following parameters: lower glucose increase from 
baseline, lower number of patients achieving a glucose increase ≥25 mg/dL within 30 minutes, higher mean 
time to plasma glucose increase ≥25 mg/dL from baseline, lower glucose AUC(0-90) and a glucose response 
that did not vary greatly after receiving the 0.5 mg dose compared to the 1 mg dose of Ogluo. This was not 
due to outliers and explained by subjects until 12 years who received more glucagon by weight-based 
exposure and the administration of excess residual insulin from the insulin pumps during the 1 mg treatment 
visits, related to the individual study procedures. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of injectable glucagon in the rescue treatment of severe hypoglycaemia is well established. The 
applicant has developed Ogluo as a ready-to-use SC glucagon product with the purpose of eliminating the 
time and stress that accompanies reconstitution and withdrawal of the solution before administration with the 
current injectable glucagon products. 
No actual-use studies have been performed yet to investigate the effectiveness of Ogluo in a setting with the 
pressure on uninstructed caregivers caused by real-life stress and a detailed plan is performed for the post-
marketing setting. 
There are no real dose-response studies for Ogluo, and there were some uncertainties about the appropriate 
dose for children 6-12 years old and 25≤45 kg (0.5 mg or 1 mg), as the dose selection was not well justified 
and the proposed dose differs from the one for the reference product regarding the cut-offs proposed for 
Ogluo (age 12 years and body weight 45 kg) for the 1 mg glucagon dose which are higher than for Glucagen 
HypoKit (6-8 years old and 25 kg). As recommended, the applicant revised the paediatric dosage including a 
weight cut-off at 25 kg, for transition to adult dose, 1 mg.  
Overall, the Phase 3 adult studies demonstrated that Ogluo treated severe hypoglycaemia within 30 minutes 
post-dose in a manner that was non-inferior to the comparators, GEK and HK. 
However, in the pivotal study versus the EU reference product, Ogluo required about 4 to 4.5 minutes longer 
to achieve plasma glucose recovery. This should be reflected in the SmPC though the applicant considered 
this of limited relevance as there is the shorter preparation time for Ogluo and the fact that several results 
were similar or even better for Ogluo versus HK when measuring ‘from decision to dose’ and using symptom 
relief scores, and that analysis of positive treatment response did meet the predefined criteria for non-
inferiority.  
The gain due to the fact that no reconstitution is necessary is estimated to be only 1 minute so there still is a 
mean delay of 3 to 3.5 minutes.  
Therefore the following was agreed to be included in the SmPC: 
Section 4.4 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 84/114 
 
 
 
 
“− Recovery Time 
Please take into account that approximately 15% of patients achieved glucose recovery after 20 minutes or 
more in the pivotal trial.” 
• Section 4.2 
− “The patient will normally respond within 15 minutes. When the patient has responded to the treatment, 
give oral carbohydrate to restore the liver glycogen and prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia. If the patient does 
not respond within 15 minutes, an additional dose of Ogluo from a new device may be administered while 
waiting for emergency assistance. It is recommended that the patients are prescribed two Ogluo devices.”. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety assessments presented are based on available data from all study participants who were treated with 
at least 1 dose of Ogluo or the active comparator, Lilly Glucagon or GlucaGen HypoKit. The applicant 
performed an integrated safety data analysis in the relevant population for two study pools: Adult Subjects 
with T1D Pool from studies XSGP–202, XSGP–301 and XSGP–303 and Phase 3 Pool from studies XSGP–301 
and XSGP–303. According to the applicant, studies XSGP–302 and XSGP–304 were analysed separately due 
to their specific characteristics. 
Patient exposure 
Ogluo is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in patients with diabetes ages 2 years and above. 
However, safety assessment is only available in patients with T1D. 
The 3 well-controlled Phase 3 studies in adult subjects (Studies XSGP-301, XSGP-303, XSGP-304), and 1 open-
label  Phase  3  study  in  paediatric  subjects  (Study  XSGP-302)  are  main  topic  for  the  safety  assessment.  All 
studies except Study XSGP-302 were full crossover studies, while in Study XSGP-302, crossover was limited to

* In general this refers to 6 months and 12 months continuous exposure data, or intermittent exposure. 
A total of 362 adult subjects received at least 1 dose of Ogluo 1 mg, including 300 adult subjects with T1D 
(Studies  XSGP-202,  -301,  -303,  and  -304),  and  62  healthy  adult  subjects  (Studies  XSGP-101  and  -201)  in 
single-dose studies. In addition, a total of 31 paediatric subjects with T1D received at least 1 dose of Ogluo 0.5 
mg, 11 of whom also received at least 1 dose of Ogluo 1 mg (Study XSGP-302) in a crossover fashion. 
Exposure to study drug in the Ogluo development programme is consistent with real-world use of glucagon, 
where the estimated incidence of hypoglycaemic events requiring glucagon rescue treatment is 1.1 events per 
year for patients with type 1 diabetes of <5 years duration. This is in line with daily practical life.  
Regarding exposure in children, the safety database by age group is limited: 7 patients in the 2 to <6 years 
age group and 13 patients in the 6 to <12 years age group exposed to 0.5 mg dose and 11 patients in the 12 
to <18 years age group exposed to 0.5 mg dose and 1.0 mg dose.    
Ogluo  is  intended  as  rescue  medication  in  severe  hypoglycaemic  episodes.  However,  hypoglycaemia  is  a 
common adverse drug reaction in diabetic patients treated with insulin and sulfonylureas, leading to repeated 
administration of glucagon as rescue medication. Due to the clinical studies design, no information on exposure 
after repeated administration is available and would have been useful. The EMA SAWP advised the applicant to 
conduct a post-marketing actual-use study in which patients could receive more than one Ogluo injection, and 
which  could  provide  immunogenicity  information.  The  applicant  provided  a  plan  for  the  post-authorisation 
Actual  Use  Study  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness,  safety,  and  ease  of  use  of  Xeris  glucagon  to  treat  severe 
hypoglycaemic  events  in  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  with  diabetes,  in  a  real  world  setting.  Included 
patient populations and the design are adequately addressed.  
However, as pointed out in the questions regarding statistics above, it seems that a significant amount of 
patients recover after approx. 20 minutes. The applicant stated that they can’t identify in advance the 
patients who will response late. Therefore, it was considered that the post-marketing phase III trial will not 
be informative to further clarify. 
Adverse events 
Phase 3 Adult Subjects (Pooled Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, and Study XSGP-304) 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher across the Ogluo groups versus comparator groups in the pooled 
Phase 3 Studies (46.1% Ogluo vs 33.1% GEK) and in Study XSGP-304 (52.8% Ogluo vs 46.3% HK) The higher 
incidence was partially driven by the incidences of nausea and vomiting, both known adverse class effects of 
glucagon. The insulin induction procedure itself likely was a cause of nausea: subjects fasted from midnight

before the insulin induction procedure to the following morning and continued to fast for 4 to 6 hours during 
and after the procedure. Furthermore, in Study XSGP-304, the insulin induction procedure was revised from 
previous  studies  to  include  a  longer  period  of  insulin  infusion.  Thus,  subjects  in  the  studies  were  in  an 
unbalanced metabolic state by the time the glucagon was administered; the resultant incidence rates of nausea 
and vomiting are therefore not unexpected.  
All  the  Phase  3  Adult  Studies  used  the  same  commercial  formulation  and  batch  of  Ogluo;  thus,  there  was 
consistency of the drug product across all studies. 
Nearly all TEAEs during the Phase 3 studies were determined by the investigator to be of mild or moderate 
intensity. One (0.8%) subject treated with Ogluo, 1 (0.6%) subject treated with GEK, and 1 (0.8%) subject 
treated with HK experienced a TEAE judged to be of severe intensity. 
The majority of events that occurred in both the pooled Phase 3 studies and Study XSGP-304 were deemed 
related to the study drug (T-S1). These events primarily comprised nausea, vomiting, and headache, and each 
of these events is a known adverse effect of glucagon. 
No serious TEAEs occurred following treatment with Ogluo in Phase 3 studies; although there was 1 SAE related 
to  Ogluo  (vasovagal  reaction)  in  Study  XSGP-202.  One  (0.6%)  subject  experienced  a  serious  TEAE 
(hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia) following treatment with GEK in Study XSGP-301. In general, TEAEs related 
to Ogluo were mild to moderate in severity, required no additional medical intervention, and were self-limited 
(Table below). 
Table 38  Overview of TEAEs Across Pooled Phase 3 Adult Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-
303, and Phase 3 Adult Study XSGP-304 (Safety Population) 
Headache was a commonly reported-related TEAE in adult subjects treated with either the Ogluo or the Lilly 
Glucagon or the GlucaGen HypoKit, respectively. As headache is a side effect not mentioned in the SmPC of 
GlucaGen HypoKit. However, it is included by the applicant in the tabulated summary of adverse reactions of 
Ogluo SmPC.

Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects 
In the Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects, the incidence of subjects who reported TEAEs was similar in subjects age 2 
to < 6 years and those age 12 to < 18 years (71.4% and 72.7%, respectively), and higher in the 6 to < 12 
years age group (92.3%). Fewer TEAEs were reported in subjects age 12 to < 18 years when they received 
Ogluo 0.5 mg (54.5%) compared with when these same subjects received Ogluo 1 mg (72.7%). None of the 
TEAEs reported were considered severe, and there were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
Among the 31 Ogluo injections in paediatric subjects, 42 TEAEs occurred, for a rate of 1.35 TEAEs per 
injection; 83.3% (35/42) were mild, 16.7% (7/42) were moderate and 0% (0/42) severe (see table below).

in the Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects Pool (Study XSGP-302) 
Common Adverse Events 
Phase 3 Adult Subjects (Pooled Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, and Study XSGP-304). 
The  most  commonly  occurring  TEAEs  in  adult  studies  were  nausea  (29.9%,  Ogluo  vs  22.9%,  GEK  [pooled 
studies] and 42.5%, Ogluo vs 44.7%, HK [Study XSGP-304]); vomiting (16.2% vs 9.6%, pooled studies and 
12.6% vs 13.8%, Study XSGP-304); and headache (5.2% vs 3.8%, pooled studies and 5.5% vs 7.3%, Study 
XSGP-304)  (See  table  below).  In  all  clinical  studies  of  Ogluo,  events  of  nausea  and  vomiting  that  occurred 
during  or  after  the  insulin  induction  procedure  were  treated  primarily  with  ondansetron.  All  of  these  events 
were transient, and all resolved fully.  
There were 2 incidences of tachycardia (2 [1.6%] and 1 incidence of supraventricular extrasystoles (1 [0.8%]) 
after treatment with Ogluo 1 mg. However, glucagon is not known as arrhythmogenic, and they were likely a 
result of the insulin induction. 
Both events of tachycardia were judged as mild and related to study drug; both events resolved spontaneously. 
The  event  of  supraventricular  extrasystoles  was  judged  as  mild  and  not  related  to  study  drug;  it  resolved 
spontaneously.  The  subject  with  supraventricular  extrasystoles  had  a  medical  history  of  pulmonary  valve 
insufficiency. 
Overall, there were no remarkable differences in the incidence of TEAEs between Ogluo-treated subjects and 
GEK-treated subjects in the Adult T1D Subjects pool. Overall, the majority of events were judged as mild or 
moderate, and all events were self-limiting, and resolved fully by the end of the studies. When treatments were 
compared on a gross level, there were no apparent and significant differences in incidence rates for TEAEs, no 
apparent data inconsistencies, no apparent safety signals.

Table 40  Analysis of TEAEs Occurring in ≥2 Subjects Across Pooled Phase 3 Adult 
Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, and Phase 3 Adult Study XSGP-304 (Safety 
Population) 
Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects 
Nausea was reported at a slightly higher rate in younger paediatric subjects (7/13 [53.8%] in 6 to <12-year-
old group) compared with older paediatric subjects (36.4% at both the 0.5 and 1 mg dose levels for 12 to <18-
year-old  group).  Vomiting  was  reported  in  younger  paediatric  subjects  (3/13  [23.1%]  in  6  to  <12-year-old 
group) and in the older group that received 1 mg Ogluo (2/11 [18.2%] in 12 to <18-year-old group). 
Hypoglycaemia was more reported in the paediatric population compared to the adults. There was a total of 10 
events of hypoglycaemia in the 2 to <12 years age group and 3 events of hypoglycaemia in the 12 to <18 
years age group; hypoglycaemia was judged to be related to the insulin induction procedure of the study, and 
the  episodes  were  recorded  as  adverse  events  by  the  investigator.  However,  2  cases  of  moderate 
hypoglycaemia were late-onset events that occurred after an initial rise in plasma glucose, occurring at 120 or 
150 minutes after administration of Ogluo. All cases of hypoglycaemia resolved without sequelae. 
The  applicant  was  requested  to  explain  the  higher  amount  of  hypoglycaemic  events  in  paediatric  patients 
compared to adults which is unexpected as in children, no hypoglycaemia was induced, compared to adults 
where hypoglycaemia < 54 mg/dL was induced. The applicant referred to the artificial and no real-world trial 
scenarios where paediatric subjects would immediately ingest fast-acting oral carbohydrates after initial plasma 
glucose recovery from glucagon, which was not allowed during the trial, because of the need to monitor the 
sole effects of the study drug upon blood glucose response.   
The  frequency  of  adverse  events  were  not  equally  reported  in  the  different  age  groups  in  the  paediatric 
population.  
The applicant explained that different rates of TEAEs across age-groups could be related to the “higher 
glucagon exposure in younger age groups. However, in the Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects, after administration 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 89/114 
 
 
 
 
 
of Ogluo 0.5 mg dose the overall incidence of related TEAEs was slightly higher for subjects 6 to < 12 years 
(76.9%) than subjects 2 to < 6 years (57.1%) or subjects 12 to < 18 years (36.4%), although the exposure 
appeared to be higher in subjects aged 2 to < 6 years.  
It is agreed that that none of the TEAEs reported were considered severe, and that the number of children 
included in the Phase 3 Paediatric trial is small. 
In section 4.8 of the Ogluo SmPC submitted in response to Day 120 LoQs, the applicant proposed to add the 
following under “Paediatric population”: 
“Paediatric population 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea (45.2%), vomiting (12.9%), and hyperglycaemia 
(6.5%). Hypoglycaemia (38.7%) was observed in clinical trials but was not considered drug-related. Based 
on data from a clinical trial, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed in children are 
similar as in adults.” 
However, the applicant’s proposal for section 4.8 of the Ogluo SmPC reflects the overall rates of TEAEs 
occurring in Phase 3 Paediatric for subjects treated with 0.5 mg dose and does not reflect the different rates 
of TEAEs between the same age group (12 to <18 years) treated with 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively. 
Moreover, relevant for children ages 12 to <18 years are drug-related TEAEs reported after administration of 
1 mg dose of Ogluo as this is the dose proposed for this age group. As requested, in the responses submitted 
to Day 180 LoOIs, the applicant included in section 4.8 Paediatric population of the SmPC the most frequently 
reported drug-related TEAEs by the relevant dose for the respective age groups. 
In general, a high number of patients reported at least 1 of (T)SAE’s, both in children and adults. Patients with 
DT2 are not represented in the trials, but would be included in the future actual-use study. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher across the Ogluo groups versus comparator groups in the pooled 
Phase 3 Studies (46.1% Ogluo vs 33.1% GEK) and in Study XSGP-304 (52.8% Ogluo vs 46.3% HK). The higher 
incidence was partially driven by the incidences of nausea and vomiting that are known as adverse class effects 
of  glucagon.  However,  both  Ogluo  and  the  comparator  are  glucagon  and  both  groups  underwent  the  same 
insulin induction procedure. The applicant could not sufficiently clarify the difference.  
Tolerability 
Modified Draize Scale Scores 
The Modified Draize Scale measured oedema and erythema at the injection site(s) during the Phase 3 studies. 
Both oedema and erythema scores range from 0 (no oedema/erythema) to 4 (severe oedema/erythema). The 
Modified Draize Scale was measured by the investigator at 30, 90, and 180 minutes post-injection. Only those 
subjects with oedema/erythema at the 30-minute time point were evaluated at 180 minutes. Overall Draize 
Scale mean scores were low in all Phase 3 studies across both the Ogluo and comparator treatments (GEK and 
HK),  and  for  the  majority  of  subjects,  oedema/erythema  resolved  by  the  90-minute  time  point,  and  by  the 
180-minute time-point, all oedema/erythema had resolved.

Table 41  Oedema in Adult Phase 3 Type 1 Diabetic Subjects (Pooled Studies XSGP-301 
and XSGP-303) 
Injection site oedema was evaluated in subjects administered study drug to the abdomen around the umbilicus, 
outer  arm,  and  outer  thigh.  Overall,  oedema  was  self-limited,  and  a  majority  of  subjects  had  complete 
resolution by the end of the treatment visit for all injection sites evaluated. Subjects who received study drug 
by abdominal injection tended to have less and milder oedema, with earlier onset and resolution than subjects 
who received study drug by injection to the outer arm or outer thigh. Although injection site oedema was self-
limited with complete resolution, mostly oedema appeared earlier and more intensive in the Ogluo treatment 
groups. The applicant could not clarify this, but injection site oedema has been added as a common adverse 
reaction to the Ogluo SmPC. 
In  the  Phase 3  Adult  Study  XSGP-304,  at  30  minutes  post  dose,  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  HK 
group had no oedema compared to subjects administered Ogluo (see Table below). However, at 90 and 180 
minutes  after  administration  of  study  drug,  oedema  scores  were  similar  between  the  treatment  groups. 
Additionally, at 90 minutes post-administration, most oedema had resolved in both groups.

Table 42  Summary of Local Tolerability - Draize Scale for Oedema (Safety Population) 
(Study XSGP-304) 
In the Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects (XSGP-302) the overall incidences of oedema and erythema were low and 
given the small sample size, no review of oedema and erythema by injection site was performed (see Table 
below). 
Table 43  Incidence of Oedema After Administration of Ogluo by Age Group (Paediatric 
Study XSGP-302) 
Injection Site Discomfort Measured via VAS 
Injection site discomfort was measured by the 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS), on which 0 indicated no 
discomfort and 100 indicated the worst possible discomfort. The VAS was evaluated at 30, 90, and 180 minutes 
post injection. 
Overall, mean VAS scores were low across all Phase 3 studies across both Ogluo and comparator treatments; 
few subjects overall described pain post-injection. The majority of subjects who reported discomfort after the 
injection had no discomfort by the 90-minute post-dose time point. The survey was to evaluate discomfort over 
time, and not many reports of discomfort were elevated to the status of an adverse events. In the Phase 3

Adult Pooled Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, 2 (1.3%) subjects treated with Ogluo and 1 (0.6%) subject 
treated with GEK and in Adult Phase 3 Study XSGP-304, 2 (1.6%) subjects treated with Ogluo had TEAEs of 
injection site pain. Overall, by the end of the studies, VAS scores tended to normalise to baseline levels. 
In particular for the Phase 3 Adult Study XSGP-304 at 30 minutes post dose, a higher percentage of subjects 
in the HK group had no erythema compared to subjects administered Ogluo 1 mg (see Table below). However, 
at 90 and 180 minutes after administration of study drug, erythema scores were similar. Additionally, at 90 
minutes post-administration, most erythema had resolved in both groups. 
Table 44  Summary of Local Tolerability – Draize Scale for Erythema (Safety Population) 
(Study XSGP-304)
In the Phase 3 Paediatric Subjects pool where subjects received SC administration of Ogluo 0.5 or 1 mg by the 
180-minute at post-dose time point, there were no subjects with erythema among those who received Ogluo 
0.5 mg, and only 1 (9.1%) subject with measurable erythema among those who received the 1 mg dose. 
Injection Site Discomfort 
Subjects in adult studies were evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) that characterised injection site 
discomfort on a scale ranging from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (maximum pain). 
VAS scores are summarised for the Adult Subjects with T1D Pool in (see table below). Overall, VAS scores in 
the Adult Subjects with T1D Pool were low (indicating minimal pain) in subjects treated with both Ogluo 1 mg 
and  GEK  1  mg,  and  decreased  from  the  10-minute  post-dose  time  point  to  30-miute  and  End  of  Visit  time 
points.

Table 45  Visual Analog Scale Results for Adult Subjects with T1D Pool (Safety 
Population) (Pooled Studies XSGP-202, XSGP-301, and XSGP-303) 
At  each  time  point,  injection  site  discomfort  in  the  Phase  3  Adult  Study  XSGP-304  was  reported  by  more 
subjects receiving Ogluo than by those receiving HK. However, overall the incidence of injection site discomfort 
was low. The level of injection site discomfort was highest at 30 minutes following Ogluo administration (38.5 
on a 100-mm scale). By 90 and 180 minutes post-dose, mean injection site discomfort for subjects receiving 
Ogluo was 15.8 and 8.4 mm, respectively. 
Injection site discomfort in paediatric subjects (Study XSGP-302) was measured by the 10-point Faces Pain 
Scale – Revised (FPS-R) at 10, 30, and 180-minutes post-injection. The majority of paediatric subjects reported 
injection site discomfort at 10 minutes post-dose, but this statistic diminished over time. 
By 180 minutes post-dose, only 1 subject in each of the 2 to <6 years and 6 to <12 years groups reported 
discomfort, and in the 12 to <18 years group, no subjects reported discomfort. 
In general: No new safety or tolerability concerns are raised. Injection site discomfort and oedema is initially 
higher  in  patients  who  received  Ogluo.  These  tolerability  discomfort  resolves  equally  with  the  non  Ogluo 
patients. Injection site oedema has been added as an undesirable effect in SmPC section 4.8 and in PL section 
4. 
For  both  treatment populations  adults  and  children, nothing is  known  about  the  repetitive  side  effects  after 
different administrations of Ogluo in patients with repetitive hypoglycaemic events. The applicant will examine 
this in the post-marketing setting e.g. and it is included in the actual-use study. An evaluation for usability and 
drug administration errors is incorporated into the study design, in order to help examine the potential risk of 
“Drug administration error leading to loss of drug benefit”.

The proposed Ogluo SmPC mentions that “based on data from clinical trials and post-marketing experience, 
the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed in children are expected to be the same as in 
adults”. However, the results of study XSGP-302 showed that: 
-Some TEAEs considered related to treatment with the Ogluo which have been reported in children are not 
mentioned in the proposed Ogluo SmPC in adults, e.g. hyperglycaemia, urticaria; 
-There are different rates of TEAEs across age-groups, generally, with a higher incidence in younger subjects 
(<12 years old), compared with the 12 to <18-year-old group of subjects. 
As requested, the applicant included in section 4.8 Paediatric population of the SmPC the most frequently 
reported drug-related TEAEs by the relevant dose for the respective age groups. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths among the Phase 3 adult subjects, or among the Phase 3 paediatric subjects. 
The rates of SAE’s seen in all clinical trials are low; only two SAEs have been reported. A narrative description 
did not show a relationship with the study drug.  
In the Phase 3 Adult Subjects, there was 1 (0.6%) subject who experienced an SAE of severe hyperinsulinaemic 
hypoglycaemia following treatment with GEK in Study XSGP-301. This event was judged as not related to study 
drug (it occurred the evening following discharge from the study site); the subject received rescue treatment 
(type of treatment unknown) from a friend, and was also treated by emergency medical technicians, and the 
subject recovered without hospitalisation (CSR XSGP-301). 
There were no paediatric subjects who experienced an SAE during Study XSGP-302. 
Laboratory findings 
The safety assessment of Ogluo based upon an evaluation of changes from baseline in clinical haematology 
laboratory evaluations was performed in the Phase 3 clinical studies. 
In Study XSGP-202, clinical haematology laboratory evaluations were not performed. 
Phase 3 Adult Subjects with T1D: There were no clinically significant mean haematology laboratory evaluations 
noted. 
Phase  3  Adult  Study  XSGP-304:  There  was  no  evidence  of  mean  population  changes  during  the  study  and, 
while a few individual values changed across the normal range boundaries, none were found to be of clinical 
significance.  No  clinically  significant  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  across  the  measured 
haematology laboratory values. 
In Study XSGP-302, clinical haematology laboratory evaluations were performed only for screening, without 
follow-up laboratory evaluations. 
Based on the intended use as an intermittent rescue medication and the decades of clinical experience with 
glucagon  therapy  according  to  the  applicant  comprehensive  laboratory  assessments  were  not  considered 
necessary and therefore, available laboratory data are limited. 
Assessment report

Scheduled laboratory tests were performed in the adult phase 3 studies. In Study XSGP-302, clinical chemistry 
laboratory evaluations were performed only for screening, without follow-up laboratory evaluations. Except for 
mean fasting glucose elevation at baseline, which is expected for the patient population, there were no relevant 
abnormalities in the clinical chemistry or haematology evaluations. 
In general, analysis of laboratory parameters in this patient population is not a major concern. 
Vital signs 
Vital signs, which included heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 
were monitored in the clinical studies conducted with G-Pen. Comparisons were performed at various time in 
the clinical studies (e.g., 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180/240 minutes post drug injection), and evaluation shifts 
from baseline/screening to post-treatment follow-up was performed. 
Overall, there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs in the Adult T1D Subjects pool and in Phase 
3 Adult Subjects with T1D pool. 
In study XSGP-304, the majority of measurements for BP (diastolic and systolic), heart rate, weight, 
respiratory rate, and temperature were within normal limits. However, treatment-emergent high SBP was 
observed after Ogluo (maximum SBP of 172 mmHg 30 minutes post-dose and 176 mmHg 120 minutes post-
dose). However, no trends were observed between treatment arms.  
It is known that after glucagon administration increases in mean heart rate and blood pressure are possible. 
CSR XSGP-302 is presenting vital signs after administration of the Ogluo by age group and by treatment, 
according to the values presented it appears that SPB values (mean values approx. 60 mmHg) are lower than 
DPB (mean values ranging from approx. 100 to 115 mmHg) for all age groups and doses. As requested, the 
applicant provided the corrected values. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
In the studies across 154 Adult Phase 3 T1D Subjects who received at least 1 dose of Ogluo, 15 subjects were 
≥ 65 years of age, and 139 subjects were < 65 years of age. The small number of subjects ≥ 65 years of age 
makes interpretation difficult. However, the incidence of TEAEs was generally similar between age groups and 
there were no apparent dose-related trends. 
No safety data have been generated for patients with hepatic or renal impairment nor with hypertension; only 
limited data are available for patients > 65 years old and no data for patients > 75 years old. 
However, the risk profile of Ogluo in elderly, hepatic or renal impairment is considered to correspond to the 
risk profile of intravenously applied glucagon for which no specific measures are necessary.

Paediatric subjects 
In paediatric subjects who received Ogluo in Study XSGP-302, there were no age-related trends seen in adverse 
events or safety laboratory evaluations. 
Other special populations 
Sex subgroups were evaluated for male and female categories. Overall, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in 
female subjects than in male subjects. This may be attributed to differences in exposure due to lower body 
mass in female subjects. 
Race subgroups included: African American, Asian, White, and Other (American Indian, Alaska native, native 
Hawaiian,  or  other  Pacific  Islander).  Interpretation  of  the  data  was  limited  due  to  the  small  sample  size  of 
subjects with race other than White.

The incidence of other TEAEs was generally similar between body mass (≤ 80 kg, 81 to 109 kg, and ≥ 110 kg) 
subgroups. 
Adult subgroups for diabetes duration included: < 10 years, 11-20 years, 21-30 years, 31-40 years, and > 41 
years. 
Paediatric subgroups for diabetes duration included: ≤ 3 years, and ≥ 4 years. 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs was generally similar across the disease duration subgroups. 
Subjects with a disease duration of 0-10 years had the highest incidence of nausea (35.0%) versus a maximum 
of 32% in the other subgroups. Subjects with a disease duration of 21-30 years had the highest incidence of 
vomiting (23.1%) versus a maximum of 20.0% in the other subgroups. The incidence of other TEAEs was low 
across the subgroups. 
Studies of the effects of extrinsic factors on the safety of Ogluo have not been conducted. 
Glucagon does not cross the human placental barrier. The use of Ogluo during pregnancy, if needed, is not 
precluded  (Glucagon  for  Injection  Product  Monograph,  2012;  GlucaGen  HypoKit  UK  SmPC,  2015;  GlucaGen 
HypoKit Product Monograph, 2016; Glucagon for Injection USPI, 2017). 
Available data from case reports and a small number of observational studies with glucagon use in pregnant 
women over decades of use have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or 
adverse maternal or foetal outcomes. Multiple small studies have demonstrated a lack of transfer of pancreatic 
glucagon across the human placental barrier during early gestation.  
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. 
In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically 
recognised pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. 
The safety and effectiveness of Ogluo in paediatric patients younger than 2 years of age is not known. 
There is no information available on the presence of glucagon in human or animal milk, the effects of the drug 
on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Therefore, even if the infant ingested 
glucagon it would be unlikely to have any effect on the infant (GlucaGen HypoKit UK SmPC, 2015; GlucaGen 
HypoKit USPI, 2015; GlucaGen HypoKit Product Monograph, 2016). 
However, glucagon is a peptide and would be expected to be broken down to its constituent amino acids in the 
infant's digestive tract, and is therefore, unlikely to cause harm to an exposed infant.  
If over-dosage of glucagon occurs, the patient may experience nausea, vomiting, inhibition of gastrointestinal 
tract  motility,  increases in  BP  and  pulse  rate,  and  a  decrease  in  serum  potassium.  Because  glucagon  has  a 
short half-life, treatment of overdose is symptomatic, primarily for nausea, vomiting, and hypokalaemia. If the 
patient  develops  a  dramatic  increase  in  BP,  non-selective  alpha-adrenergic  blockade  has  been  shown  to  be 
effective in lowering BP for the short time that control would be needed. 
There have been no reports of abuse of Ogluo in clinical investigations. There is no evidence of potential for 
abuse or misuse of Ogluo for illegal purposes. No studies to assess the abuse potential of Ogluo have been 
conducted. Ogluo is not likely to be abused and does not produce dependence effects. 
There have been no studies of the effects of Ogluo on the ability to drive or operate machinery or on impairment 
of  mental  ability.  There  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  Ogluo  would  affect  the  ability  to  drive  or  operate 
machinery. The patient’s ability to concentrate or react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. Until 
Assessment report

hypoglycaemia  has  been  adequately  treated,  the  ability  to  drive  vehicles  or  to  operate  machinery  may  be 
impaired. 
These issues are adequately reflected under sections 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 respectively of the SmPC. No separate 
interaction studies for Ogluo are required. 
Immunological events 
The  concern  that  frequent  administration  of  Ogluo  would  yield  more  information  about  the  immunogenic 
potential is not withhold by the applicant, due to the fact that the applicant has not seen any immunogenicity 
risks to date in its chronic glucagon development programs, as discussed during the scientific advice process. 
However,  as  discussed  in  the  EMA  SA,  a  relevant  aspect  regarding  safety  and  tolerability  of  peptides  and 
proteins is immunogenicity.  
See Quality regarding the fact that glucagon is known to be prone to aggregation or formation of fibrils. Due 
to the special formulation used in Ogluo, the notion that immunogenicity of glucagon is usually low may not 
apply for the Xeris product.  
Taking into account that no data regarding the immunogenicity potential have been submitted, the applicant 
was  asked  to  submit  a  risk-assessment  in  line  with  section  10  of  the  EMA  Guideline  on  Immunogenicity 
assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1). If this risk-assessment concludes 
to the need of immunogenicity assays, a thorough discussion justifying the strategy used and the suitability of 
the bioanalytical methods selected, the validation reports of the immunogenicity assays used as well as the 
bioanalytical reports with clinical sample results should be submitted. The applicant’s answer was mainly based 
on clinical arguments and not related to immunogenicity assays. 
No data about actual-use planned study are submitted in the dossier. Therefore, this was asked to be 
provided (see higher) including a discussion about how it will be ensured to include a sufficient number of 
patients who will have administration of multiple doses for analysis of potential immunogenicity. 
Moreover, in line with the above cited EMA guideline, it was asked how an actual-use study will deal with the 
pre-existing antibodies. This question, related to pre-existing antibodies has not been addressed, however 
the clinical argumentation is considered acceptable and no further immunogenicity data were considered 
necessary.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
All adult subjects in the pooled Studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 reported 1 or more drugs used in diabetes, 
including multiple brands and forms of insulin. The next most frequently reported prior medications belonged 
in  the  following  ATC  categories:  Multivitamins,  Thyroid  Therapy,  Agents  Acting  on  the  Renin-Angiotensin 
System, and Lipid-Modifying Agents. 
During  Studies  XSGP-301  and  XSGP-303,  the  most  frequently-reported  concomitant  medication  was 
ondansetron, which was administered to treat adverse events of nausea and vomiting. 
In Study XSGP-304 prior and concomitant medications were collected at the same time. Overall, all subjects 
reported  insulin  treatment  (multiple  brands  of  insulin  were  used).  The  next  most  frequently-reported  ATC 
categories of medications were the same as for the pooled studies, with the addition of ondansetron, which 
was administered for adverse events of nausea and vomiting during and after the insulin induction procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 99/114 
 
 
 
 
The  majority  of  paediatric  subjects  received  ondansetron  during  the  study  for  at  least  1  adverse  event  of 
nausea. 
No interaction between Ogluo and the most frequently reported concomitant medications used in the Phase 3 
studies was observed, although a formal analysis was not conducted. Warfarin was a prohibited medication in 
all studies due to glucagon’s potential to increase its anticoagulant effect. 
The  pharmacological  profile  of  glucagon  is  well  established  after  decades  of  widespread  clinical  use.  Drug 
related changes in serum chemistry and haematology have not been expected for glucagon. Therefore, drug 
interaction  studies  were  not  performed  for  Ogluo;  however,  interaction  with  other  medicinal  products  is 
available  through  class  labelling.  The  current  US  and  EU  labels  for  GlucaGen  (GlucaGen  HypoKit  UK  SmPC 
2015;  GlucaGen  HypoKit  USPI  2015)  list  the  following  drug  interactions  relevant  to  treatment  of  severe 
hypoglycaemia: 
• Beta-blockers: Patients taking beta-blockers may have a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure when 
given Ogluo, which will be temporary because of glucagon’s short half-life. 
• Indomethacin: In patients taking indomethacin, Ogluo may lose its ability to raise blood glucose, or may even 
produce hypoglycaemia 
• Warfarin: Ogluo may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. 
In clinical studies of Ogluo, there have been no reports of adverse events of overdoses. Administration of Ogluo 
at 1 mg in healthy subjects with T1D has been adequately tolerated. In cases of overdose, the patient may 
experience nausea and vomiting; however, due to the short half-life of Ogluo (31.9 minutes; CSR XSGP-101), 
these adverse events should be transient. 
However, glucagon plays a role in antagonizing the effects of insulin and maintaining glucose homeostasis by 
promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and inhibiting glycogen synthesis and in other pathways. 
In the adipocyte for example, glucagon activates the phosphorylation and activation of hormone-sensitive lipase 
and the lipolysis, which further may influence the gluconeogenesis. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 3 Adult Subjects 
No subject discontinued treatment due to TEAE in the pooled Studies 301 and 303. Two (1.6%) subjects treated 
with Ogluo withdrew from Study XSGP-304 due to TEAEs. One (0.8%) subject withdrew due to abdominal pain 
and  1  (0.8%)  subject  withdrew  due  to  hypoglycaemia.  The  subject  who  withdrew  due  to  hypoglycaemia 
received an additional bolus of 0.40 IU insulin with a plasma glucose of 64.4 mg/dL in order to induce the last 
decline of  blood  glucose  to  the  target level  prior to  receiving  the  dose  of  study  drug.  Although  the  protocol 
noted that no additional bolus was allowed when plasma glucose level was <65 mg/dL, the subject showed a 
high degree of insulin resistance (HbA1c 9.1% and high insulin rate needed during hypoglycaemia induction). 
This bolus was at the investigator's discretion to overcome counter-regulation and reach target plasma glucose 
as the subject was experiencing progressive hypoglycaemic symptoms. This subject also received IV glucose 
after dosing with study drug, but before 30 minutes post-glucagon administration due to safety reasons (further 
progression of hypoglycaemic symptoms) (CSR XSGP-304). Of note, this investigator discretion was deemed a 
major protocol deviation, per study protocol and the statistical analysis plan. The progressive hypoglycaemic 
symptoms were determined not to be study drug related.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 300 adult subjects with T1D (Studies XSGP-202, -301, -303, and -304) received at least 1 dose of 
Ogluo 1 mg, in single-dose studies. In addition, a total of 31 paediatric subjects with T1D received at least 1 
dose of Ogluo 0.5 mg, 11 of whom also received at least 1 dose of Ogluo 1 mg (Study XSGP-302) in a crossover 
fashion. Doses analysed in the population were 0.5 mg and 1 mg; these doses are proposed in the MAA. The 
issue regarding the dose in children aged 6 to <12 years was solved. 
The issues regarding patient exposure as well as regarding relatedness of the TEAEs in Adult Phase 3 Subjects 
with T1D Pool have been clarified. 
The safety profile of Ogluo includes well-known effects of glucagon treatment (vomiting, nausea) as well as 
local tolerability effects (injection pain, oedema). Headache, which was a commonly reported-related TEAE in 
adult subjects treated with either the Ogluo or the Lilly Glucagon or the GlucaGen HypoKit, respectively, was  
included in the listing of adverse events in the Ogluo SmPC, although it is not included among adverse events 
in the GlucaGen HypoKit SmPC. Because these adverse effects are transient and are non-serious in nature, 
they are not considered to have a negative impact for the patient.  
Next to the already well known adverse events, in Ogluo treated patients, there was initially after administration 
a  higher  injection  site  discomfort  and  oedema  compared  with the  comparator arm;  this  discomfort  resolves 
equally. Injection site oedema is added as an undesirable effect in SmPC section 4.8 and in PL section 4.  
There were several differences with the observed reporting in children in study XSGP-302 versus adults. 
Firstly regarding hypoglycaemia which was unexpectedly more reported in the paediatric population in study 
XSGP-302 compared to the adults. Some TEAEs considered related to treatment with Ogluo which have been 
reported in children are not mentioned in the proposed Ogluo SmPC in adults, e.g. hyperglycaemia, urticarial 
and there are different rates of TEAEs across age-groups, generally, with a higher incidence in younger 
subjects (<12 years old), compared with the 12 to <18-year-old group of subjects. The most common TEAEs 
across age and dose groups were nausea and vomiting. These issues are satisfactorily discussed. 
The rates of SAEs seen in all clinical trials are low; only two SAEs have been reported. 
Overall, across the clinical development programme, the majority of adverse events were self-limiting and 
resolved fully by the end of the study. 
The safety database for Ogluo was sufficient in scope to adequately characterise the safety profile of Ogluo in 
adults (mostly <65 years) and paediatric patients (all ≥2 years) with diabetes given the intended use of Ogluo 
and the history of safe use with the currently approved injectable glucagon products.  However, elderly patients 
and others than Caucasian patients were rarely included in the safety database.  
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 101/114 
 
 
 
 
Patients with T2D were not investigated in the trials, although they represent the highest diabetes population 
in general daily practice. This patient population will be included in the post marketing trial.  
Analysis of laboratory parameters was minimal but this is not a concern due to the fact that the pharmacological 
profile of glucagon is well established after decades of widespread clinical use. Drug related changes in serum 
chemistry and haematology have not been expected for glucagon.  
It is known that after glucagon administration increases in mean heart rate and blood pressure are possible. 
An issue has been identified regarding the SBP and DBP for all age groups and doses in study XSGP-302. The 
applicant provided the corrected values for SPB and DPB. There were 2 incidences of tachycardia and 1 
incidence of supraventricular extrasystoles after treatment with Ogluo 1 mg. However, glucagon is not known 
as arrhythmogenic, and they were likely due to the insulin induction, and the incidences were manageable 
with positive outcome. 
The safety evaluation for Ogluo could not detect very rare adverse effects, adverse effects with long latency, 
or adverse effects caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure.  It is accepted that these limitations are less 
meaningful for Ogluo because the treatment indication is for acute potentially life-saving episodic use and not 
for chronic administration.  
For  both  treatment populations  adults  and  children, nothing is  known  about  the  repetitive  side  effects  after 
different administrations of Ogluo in patients with repetitive hypoglycaemic events. Therefore, it was advised 
to supply safety data from Ogluo in chronic use. The applicant discussed how this will be examined in the post-
marketing  setting  e.g.  will  this  be  included  in  the  actual-use  study.  An  evaluation  for  usability  and  drug 
administration errors is incorporated into the study design, in order to help examine the potential risk of “Drug 
administration error leading to loss of drug benefit”.  
The adverse effects and the potential risk associated with Ogluo will be managed through routine measures 
including labelling and pharmacovigilance activities, which are planned for the post-marketing period.   
Very elderly patients and patients with renal or hepatic impairment were not included in the clinical trials. These 
special  patient  groups  are  not  excluded  from Ogluo  treatment  according  to  the  current  SmPC,  and  no  dose 
adjustment is recommended. Additional data regarding adverse effects in the different age groups < 65 years 
old and ≥65 years old would be examined in the actual use postmarketing trial.  
Only two adults and no paediatric patients discontinued treatment due to TEAE. 
No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Ogluo. The interactions included in the Ogluo SmPC are 
in line with the SmPC of the reference product; this is agreed. 
Immunogenicity is a relevant aspect regarding safety and tolerability of peptides and proteins. The notion that 
immunogenicity of glucagon is usually low may not apply for Ogluo due to its special formulation. Taking into 
account that no immunogenicity-related data have been submitted, the applicant submitted a risk-assessment 
in  line  with  section  10  of  the  EMA  Guideline  on  Immunogenicity  assessment  of  therapeutic  proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1). Eventually, the risk-assessment was based on clinical arguments and 
not related to immunogenicity assays and seemed acceptable.  
Moreover,  during  the  EMA  SA,  it  was  recommended  to  conduct  an  actual-use  study  in  which  patients  could 
receive more than 1 Ogluo injection, possibly providing valuable immunogenicity information. Data about this 
planned study were asked to be submitted including a discussion on how it will be ensured to include a sufficient 
number of patients with multiple dosing as well as elderly patients as well as how an actual-use study will deal 
with the pre-existing antibodies in line with the above cited EMA guideline and this issue was solved.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Ogluo is consistent with the currently approved injectable glucagon products.  The 
most commonly reported AEs in adults and children were nausea, vomiting and headache.     
Except  for  headache  and  oedema  at  the  injection  site,  and  hypoglycaemia,  hyperglycaemia  and  urticaria 
reported in children, the current product labelling for injectable glucagon provides the reported adverse effects. 
Currently, the product labelling is accordingly adapted.  
Based upon all the available data within the development programme, Ogluo is considered to be safe and 
well tolerated for the rescue treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adult and paediatric patients ≥ 2 years old 
with diabetes.

instructions on the appropriate use of Ogluo. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is: 
“Ogluo is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 
years and over with diabetes mellitus.” 
Hypoglycaemia is the limiting factor in the glycaemic management of diabetes (Cryer, 2008; Cryer, 2014) 
and causes recurrent morbidity in most patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and advanced type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2D).  
The working group of the EASD and ADA describes that severe hypoglycaemia denotes severe cognitive 
impairment requiring external assistance for recovery and also describes a serious, clinically important low 
glucose level of <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) as sufficiently low to greatly increase the risk of severe 
hypoglycaemia.  
Severe hypoglycaemia may present itself with symptoms such as cognitive impairment, behavioural changes 
and psychomotor abnormalities, and loss of consciousness, seizure, and coma. If severe hypoglycaemia is left 
untreated it may result in death. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The majority of severe hypoglycaemic events are treated on an emergency basis, outside of a healthcare 
facility. Injectable glucagon is currently the only treatment option for severe hypoglycaemia for patients and 
Assessment report

their caregivers in this setting, which is available as GEK (Lilly, 2018) and HK (Novo, 2015), with only HK 
being marketed in the EU. However, their administration tends to be complex as it requires a multistep 
process in which the lyophilised glucagon powder must be manually reconstituted with the liquid diluent at 
the time of use, then withdrawn from a vial into a syringe, and then dose calibrated before injection. Further 
downsides are the fact that the glucagon must be used immediately after reconstitution, and that it should be 
stored in the refrigerator. 
Under a stressed environment, the complexity of preparing the drug for administration may lead to drug 
administration failures due to either partial doses or missed doses all together: company-owned studies with 
currently marketed emergency glucagon kits have shown that only 6% to 31% of users were able to 
successfully prepare and administer the full dose of glucagon, while in a published study (Yale et al., 2017) 
this was shown to be only 0% to 13%. This leads the applicant to conclude that there is an unmet clinical 
need for a ready-to-use glucagon formulation that can be administered with reliability and ease when needed 
by caregivers or family members. Recently, a ready-to-use glucagon formulation for intranasal administration 
was authorised in the EU. 
The proposed Ogluo Configuration A (auto-injector) is a 2-step process and Configuration B (pre-filled 
syringe) requires 3 steps to administer the rescue dose, proposed to simplify the complexity of the rescue 
treatment of severe hypoglycaemia. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development programme of Ogluo included 7 clinical trials involving 62 healthy subjects in one 
phase 1 study (Study XSGP-101), and 300 adult and 31 paediatric subjects with T1D in two Phase 2 studies 
(Study XSGP-201 and Study XSGP-202) and four Phase 3 studies (XSGP-301, XSGP-303, and XSGP-304 in 
adults and the open-label study XSGP-302 in paediatric subjects 2-18 years old).

Table 46 Overview of Clinical Efficacy Studies 
In addition, 7 Human Factors (HF) Studies were designed to mimic real-life emergency situations, and tested 
a total of 5 user groups that included first responders, trained and untrained users, adults and paediatric 
(adolescent) caregivers of people with diabetes. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal adult study XSGP-304, 99% (mITT) and 100% (PP) of Ogluo subjects achieved the primary 
endpoint (plasma glucose >70 mg/dL or rise ≥20 mg/dL within 30 minutes of dosing), comparable to 
treatment with HK subjects in which 100% of subjects achieved this. This study demonstrated that Ogluo was 
non-inferior to HK for achieving the primary endpoint. 
For the pooled data from studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303, 97.4% of Ogluo subjects (mITT) and 98% (PP) 
achieved the primary endpoint (plasma glucose level >70 mg/dL within 30 minutes of dosing), comparable to 
treatment with GEK in which 100% of subjects achieved this.  
The data from studies XSGP-301 and XSGP-303 were analysed according to the primary endpoint of study 
XSGP-304 using an alternate combined endpoint (plasma glucose >70 mg/dL or increase ≥20 mg/dL within 
30 minutes of dosing) for which the non-inferiority margin was achieved in both studies.  
In the paediatric study XSGP-302, statistically significant (p < 0.001) increases from Baseline in mean 
plasma glucose were observed at 30 minutes post-dose in each age group. All 30 evaluable patients achieved 
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 107/114 
 
 
 
 
 
a target glucose increase of at least 25 mg/dL and the mean time to achieve plasma glucose increase ≥25 
mg/dL from baseline was 19 minutes.    
Ogluo is pre-mixed and pre-loaded into a pre-filled syringe and auto-injector pen ready-to-use with no 
reconstitution required. In addition, it has enhanced portability and availability due to room-temperature 
stability, while the existing EU product HK needs to be reconstituted in a multi-step process and the cold 
chain should be maintained.  
In the Human Factors Studies, almost all participants succeeded to successfully administer Ogluo: 
percentages varied from 88% in comparison to 31% for the comparator in one study, 98.7% and 100% in 
the other studies. Some of these studies also included untrained adolescent users (as young as 12 years old) 
which were able to successfully use Ogluo to carry out the full rescue injection procedure during an 
emergency use context. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In Study XSGP-201, the PK profile was distinctly different between Ogluo and Lilly glucagon with significantly 
higher glucagon exposure in the comparator group and a shift in tmax, indicating a slower rate of absorption 
for Ogluo, which seems to be reflected in a delay in PD response. It was suggested that this shift could result 
from the different formulations (aqueous solution in Lilly glucagon vs. DMSO preparation used in Ogluo).  
This is also reflected in the fact that Ogluo required about 4 to 4.5 minutes longer versus the EU reference 
product in the pivotal study XSGP-304 to achieve plasma glucose recovery. This difference was considered of 
limited relevance as it will be decreased in clinical practice thanks to the shorter preparation time for Ogluo. 
Additionally the mean times to achieve plasma glucose recovery were all still within the predefined 30 
minutes post-dose, and that, when measuring ‘from decision to dose’ (instead of as of administration of study 
drug) and using the not validated symptom relief scores as a PRO, several results were similar or even better 
for Ogluo versus HK, and analysis of positive treatment response (successful plasma glucose recovery or 
successful symptom recovery) by treatment did meet the predefined criteria for non-inferiority in all analysed 
populations. Across trials the symptom relief scores were consistent with glucose effects. This was addressed 
by additional warnings in the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of Ogluo is consistent with the currently approved injectable glucagon products in 
both adult and paediatric patients with diabetes. There are no key unfavourable effects noticed which have an 
impact on the benefit-risk balance. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A post-authorisation actual use study is planned to evaluate the real-world effectiveness and ease of use to 
treat severe hypoglycaemic episodes in children, adolescents, and adults with insulin dependent diabetes 
(T1D or T2D). In this study an evaluation of drug administration error will be included. However, there are no 
remaining limitations and uncertainties that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance.

Notes: *Overall, at 30 minutes post dose, a higher percentage of subjects in the GlucaGen HypoKit group had no oedema 
or erythema compared to subjects administered Ogluo. However, at 90 and 180 minutes after administration of study 
drug, oedema and erythema scores were similar and at 90 minutes post-administration, most oedema had resolved in both 
groups. 
At each time-point, injection site discomfort was reported by more subjects receiving Ogluo than GlucaGen HypoKit and 
the mean total duration of injection site discomfort was longer for subjects receiving Ogluo than GlucaGen HypoKit. The 
level of injection site discomfort was highest at 30 minutes following Ogluo. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Time to glucose recovery 
The glucose recovery after Ogluo administration is delayed by average 4 to 4.5 minutes compared to the EU 
reference product (study XSGP-304), while prompt recovery is critical in the acute treatment of severe 
hypoglycaemia. The risk from this delay may be partially mitigated by the time gained due to the fact that no 
reconstitution is needed for Ogluo in contrast to HypoKit. However, this gain in preparation time appeared to 
be only 1 minute in the pivotal study which would mean that there still is a delay of 3 to 3.5 minutes.  
Moreover, the delay based on the time to recovery of 14.8 minutes versus 10.4 minutes for HK is only a 
mean value with an important variability. At 15 minutes post-dose, all HK patients had achieved recovery, 
while for Ogluo there was a delay of 5 to 20 minutes for many (>20%) patients (outliers).  
Assessment report  
EMA/6676/2021 
Page 110/114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, it is possible that caregivers of diabetic patients during real-world use of the product would need 
even more time to prepare HK than the trained, licensed pharmacists in this study which would decrease the 
delay for Ogluo versus HK. 
Successful administration 
Another important parameter to take into account is successful administration of glucagon. If a dose is not 
successfully administered in a severe hypoglycaemic event, the recommended action for HK is to call 
emergency medical services and wait for them to arrive which also creates an important delay to recovery. 
The recommended action for Ogluo is to call emergency medical services immediately after administration; 
an additional dose of Ogluo from a new device may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance. 
This appears to be a problem with the existing injectable glucagon as e.g. only 12.5% of the 16 caregivers 
and none of the 15 acquaintances delivered a full dose of glucagon from the GEK in a simulation study (Yale 
et al., 2017) that evaluated a glucagon nasal powder versus a marketed GEK. 
This is in contrast to Ogluo for which its ease-of-use is the main added value. It is pre-mixed and pre-loaded 
into a pre-filled syringe and auto-injector pen ready-to-use with no reconstitution required. In addition, it has 
enhanced portability and availability due to room-temperature stability. These are all considerable 
advantages when compared to the existing EU product HK that needs to be reconstituted in a multi-step 
process and for which the cold chain should be maintained.  
The ease-of-use of Ogluo was demonstrated in the Human Factors Studies by the fact that almost all 
participants had a successful administration of Ogluo, also in a small comparative study versus HK (88% 
successful administration for Ogluo and only 31% for the GEK); it might even be administered by adolescents 
to their siblings or parents with diabetes, which would be unfeasible with HK. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There was a delay in response in a non-negligible amount of patients with Ogluo compared to the comparator 
in the pivotal study. This has been reflected in the SmPC: 
Section 4.4 
− Recovery Time 
Please take into account that approximately 15% of patients achieved glucose recovery after 20 minutes or 
more in the pivotal trial. 
• Section 4.2 
− The patient will normally respond within 15 minutes. When the patient has responded to the treatment, 
give oral carbohydrate to restore the liver glycogen and prevent relapse of hypoglycaemia. If the patient does 
not respond within 15 minutes, an additional dose of Ogluo from a new device may be administered while 
waiting for emergency assistance. It is recommended that the patients are prescribed two Ogluo devices. 
Additional educational materials are also agreed (annex II and RMP) aimed at providing guidance on how to 
minimise the important potential risk of inappropriate use of the device leading to loss of drug benefit. 
Healthcare professionals and patients/caregivers who are expected to prescribe, supply, or use the product 
have access to the administration leaflet and instructional video.

Ogluo has ease-of-use as the main added value. It is pre-mixed and pre-loaded into a pre-filled syringe and 
auto-injector pen ready-to-use with no reconstitution required. In addition, it has enhanced portability and 
availability due to room-temperature stability. These are all considerable advantages when compared to the 
existing EU product HK that needs to be reconstituted in a multi-step process and for which the cold chain 
should be maintained. 
The benefit/risk ratio is considered positive. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ogluo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety, and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Ogluo is favourable in the following indication: 
Ogluo is indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and children aged 2 
years and over with diabetes mellitus.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product on medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Ogluo (glucagon), for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia in adults, adolescents, and 
children aged 2 years and over with diabetes mellitus, in each EU Member State, the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree on the content and format of the educational materials, including communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with National Competent Authority. 
The educational materials are aimed at providing guidance on how to minimise the important potential risk in 
the RMP of inappropriate use of the device leading to loss of drug benefit. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Ogluo is marketed, all healthcare professionals and 
patients/caregivers who are expected to prescribe, supply, or use the product have access to the following: 
•  Administration leaflet; 
• 
Instructional video. 
The administration leaflet should contain the following key elements: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients should receive the administration leaflet from their healthcare professionals upon initial 
Ogluo prescription and after training; 
It is important not to test the single-dose device in advance, not to remove the single-dose device 
from the foil pouch in advance and to ensure that the patient understands that each Ogluo single-
dose device can only be used once; 
The PL should be referenced for more detailed information regarding administration and handling of 
Ogluo; 
Patients can use the leaflet to teach those around them how to correctly handle and administer 
Ogluo; 
If the patient does not respond within 15 minutes, an additional dose of Ogluo from a new device 
may be administered while waiting for emergency assistance; 
The leaflet should contain a URL and QR code to a website where patients can access the instructional 
video.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pradaxa® (dabigatran etexilate) was registered in the European Union (EU) in March 2008. The approved 
therapeutic indications are “Primary prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) in adult patients 
who have undergone elective total hip replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery” (pVTEp) 
and “Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with 
one or more risk factors” (SPAF). Pradaxa® is marketed as capsules of 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg 
strengths.  
In the frame of the Pradaxa PSUR 8 procedure the MAH was asked to provide supplementary information 
addressing requests for re-evaluation of SmPC wording on contraindications and drug-drug interactions. 
The final Assessment Report to the Pradaxa PSUR 8 contained a postauthorisation measure (LEG 12.1) 
that included among others a request to discuss whether a caution or non-recommendation for 
concomitant use of Pradaxa and tacrolimus is warranted or whether the current contraindication should 
be kept. Also the MAH was asked to provide a summary of available data on P-gp inhibitory potential of 
posaconazole and discuss its implications for Pradaxa.  
In the Response Document submitted in May 2013 the MAH has proposed a cautionary statement for 
concomitant use of Pradaxa with tacrolimus and posaconasole.  
In the final Assessment report to the follow-up measure LEG 12.1 the proposal of the MAH for a 
cautionary statement for tacrolimus was not endorsed, instead a non-recommendation regarding the 
concomitant use with Pradaxa was requested. The proposal of the MAH for a cautionary statement for 
posaconazole was endorsed.  
The present variation application, C.I.3 is herewith submitted to implement the outcome of the LEG 012.1 
assessment.  
This variation affects sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC as well as section 2 of the Pacage Leaflet of both 
registered indications.  
1)  Tacrolimus is removed from the list of P-gp inhibitors contraindicated for the concomitant use in 
both sections 4.3 and 4.5  
2)  A non-recommendation for concomitant treatment of Pradaxa and posaconazole is removed from 
the section 4.5  
3)  A label proposal for a non-recommendation on concomitant use of Pradaxa and tacrolimus and 
caution on concomitant use of Pradaxa and posaconazole is included in the section 4.5   
4)  Tacrolimus is removed from the section 2 subsection "Do not take Pradaxa" 
5)  Posaconazole is included in the section 2 subsection "Other medicines and Pradaxa"  
Furthermore, Corrigenda for Italian, Spanish and Icelandic translations of various sections are enclosed as 
attachments to the application form. The respective changes do not result from this variation, but the 
individual translations of the currently registered texts needed corrections.

2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Tacrolimus was listed as an in vitro P-gp inhibitor in the FDA`s 2006 draft guidance for industry “Drug 
Interaction Studies-Study Design, Data Analysis, and Implications for Dosing and Labeling”; but the 
current FDA 2012 draft guidance lists tacrolimus as CYP3A substrate. 
The P-gp inhibitory potency of tacrolimus was deduced from MAH generated in vitro data as presented in 
Table 1 below and the effect on the efflux of dabigatran etexilate was similar to cyclosporine A or 
itraconazole. 
According to our information there is no clinical drug-drug interaction evaluation available which assesses 
directly the P-gp inhibitory potency of tacrolimus with the probe drug digoxin (=P-gp substrate). 
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
From the post marketing experience the MAH received in total 10 case reports on concomitant 
administration of tacrolimus with Pradaxa®. Out of these, 4 cases with reported bleeding events were 
received. The percentage of bleeding events in cases involving concomitant medication with tacrolimus is 
comparable with the overall bleeding reporting.  
2.4.  Risk management plan 
There was no updated RMP submitted within current variation. The pVTEp and SPAF Prescriber guides 
have been consequently revised, namely: tacrolimus is removed from the list of contraindicated P-gp 
inhibitors for the concomitant use with Pradaxa. 
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI):

During the procedure, the CHMP requested the following additional amendments to the Product 
Information: 
The non-recommendation regarding tacrolimus and the cautionary statement regarding posaconazole 
are supported. However, more precise information about the rationale should be included in the SmPC.  
The following wording of the SmPC was finally agreed by the CHMP (additions in bold, deletions 
strikethrough): 
4.3  Contraindications 
“• 
Concomitant treatment with systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, itraconazole, tacrolimus and 
dronedarone (see section 4.5)” 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
“P gp inhibitors 
… 
The following strong P-gp inhibitors are contraindicated: systemic ketoconazole, cyclosporine, 
itraconazole, tacrolimus and dronedarone (see section 4.3). Concomitant treatment with tacrolimus 
is not recommended. Caution should be exercised with mild to moderate P gp inhibitors (e.g. 
amiodarone, posaconazole, quinidine, verapamil and ticagrelor) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).” 
… 
“The following potent P gp inhibitors have not been clinically studied but from in vitro results a similar 
effect as with ketoconazole may be expected: 
Itraconazole, tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which are contra indicated (see section 4.3). 
Tacrolimus has been found in vitro to have a similar level of inhibitory effect on P-gp as that 
seen with itraconazole and cyclosporine. Dabigatran etexilate has not been clinically studied 
together with tacrolimus. However, limited clinical data with another P-gp substrate 
(everolimus) suggest that the inhibition of P-gp with tacrolimus is weaker than that 
observed with strong P-gp inhibitors. Based on these data concomitant treatment with 
tacrolimus is not recommended.   
Posaconazole also inhibits P-gp to some extent but has not been clinically studied. Caution 
should be exercised when Pradaxa is co-administered with posaconazole. 
Neither clinical nor in vitro test results are available for posaconazole which is not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with Pradaxa.” 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor corrections to the Italian, Spanish and 
Icelandic translations of the SmPC and the PL. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The benefit-risk remains positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
In 2012, ovarian cancer was estimated to be the fifth most common cause of cancer death (29,760 
deaths) and the fifth most common newly diagnosed cancer (44,150 new cases) in females in the EU 
(Ferlay et al 2013). Ovarian cancer is generally detected at an advanced stage, with a 5-year survival rate 
of 44% across all stages and 27% for advanced stages (Siegel et al 2013). 
The definitive diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer is by surgery, and cytological or histological 
examination of tissue samples.  
The Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) surgical staging system is used for epithelial ovarian 
cancer and primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma. Because the disease tends to be asymptomatic in early 
stages, or associated with vague, non-specific symptoms, the majority of patients are diagnosed with 
advanced stage disease.  
Epithelial ovarian cancer comprises the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasm (about 90%) (Chan JK et 
al 2006; Jelovac D et al. 2011). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of surface epithelial 
ovarian tumours includes six major histotypes - serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional 
cell and epithelial-stromal.  The serous subtype of ovarian carcinoma accounts for approximately 60-80% 
of ovarian cancer cases and is the most aggressive type of ovarian cancer.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 9/187 
  
  
Grade is an additional prognostic determinant and a number of grading systems currently exist which are 
derived from reviewing the following tumour characteristics: architectural features, mitotic counts and 
nuclear atypia (ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines). Low grade (grade 1, well differentiated) serous 
ovarian carcinoma is considered a distinct type of disease compared with high grade (grade 2 and 3 – 
moderately and poorly differentiated) serous carcinoma based on a number of clinical and molecular 
features, thus forming a 2 tier classification of low and high grade disease widely accepted and used in 
clinical practice (Levanon et al 2008; Vang et al 2009).   
Despite the high sensitivity of ovarian cancer to initial treatment with platinum and taxane combination 
chemotherapy (following cytoreductive surgery), which is the standard of care in the front-line setting, 
the majority of women diagnosed with advanced-stage disease will have a recurrence of their cancer. 
Recurrent disease is classified as platinum resistant or platinum sensitive, depending on whether the 
disease recurred less than or greater than 6 months following previous platinum therapy, and this 
classification is highly prognostic and is important in determining optimal chemotherapeutic treatment 
options. 
Three subgroups of patients with relapsed ovarian cancer have been identified: 
- patients with platinum-refractory disease who progress during platinum treatment, 
- patients with platinum-resistant disease who develop recurrence <6 months from the completion of 
platinum chemotherapy, 
- patients with platinum-sensitive disease: partially platinum-sensitive and platinum-sensitive recurrence 
are currently considered as separate sub-groups and are respectively defined by a relapse-free period of 
6 to 12 months and >12 months following a response to the final dose of prior platinum treatment (NICE, 
technology Appraisal 91 May 2005; ESMO guidelines, Ledermann et al, 2013). 
The current most commonly used regimens in first relapse for patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian 
cancer are platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens (e.g. doublets including 
carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/gemcitabine, and carboplatin/ pegylated liposomal doxorubicin).  
Such regimens are associated with cumulative toxicities (including neurologic, renal and haematologic 
side effects) that generally limit the duration of treatment to 6 cycles for each line of therapy. 
Bevacizumab (Avastin), a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor already indicated in combination 
with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the first-line advanced ovarian cancer, was approved in the EU for the 
treatment of first recurrence of platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer (in combination with 
carboplatin and gemcitabine). Additionally, trabectedin (Yondelis), an antineoplastic agent that binds to 
DNA and triggers a cascade of events affecting several transcription factors, DNA binding proteins, and 
DNA repair pathways, is indicated in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. 
Homologous recombination deficiency 
Homologous recombination (HR) is a type of genetic recombination most widely used by cells to 
accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. 
About 50% of high grade serous ovarian carcinomas are estimated to have disruption of the HR pathway 
and thus might be sensitive to PARP inhibitors (The Cancer Genome atlas (TCGa), 2011).  
DNA repair mechanisms rely on several DNA repair pathways that interact and compensate each other in 
order to ensure DNA integrity. In cancer cells, dysregulation of such mechanisms leads to genomic 
instability and make cells dependent on compensatory mechanisms of DNA repair that maintain cell 
viability.

Endogenous base damage is the most common DNA aberration in cells. The base excision repair (BER) 
pathway recognises the damaged bases and after excising them generates single-strand DNA breaks 
(SSBs). Up to 10,000-20,000 SSBs are predicted to occur every day in a metabolically active cell, with an 
even higher frequency in tumour cells. 
PARP are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of 
PARP-induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto-modifies itself and dissociates 
from the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. 
There are 17 known members of the PARP family of proteins (Hottiger et al. 2010), but mainly PARP-1, -2 
and -3 are associated with the DNA repairvia different mechanisms and interactions. While PARP-1 is the 
main family member involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, PARP-2 still has the ability to bind 
to DNA and compensate for PARP-1 activity in DNA single-strand breaks repair. 
The loss of function in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins due to genetic mutations (hereditary or acquired) is 
the most commonly recognised cause of tumour homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). However, 
other mechanisms may contribute to the loss or reduction of BRCA1/2 function, including epigenetic 
factors such as BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation, mutations in regulators of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (e.g., 
PALB2) or through loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 or BRCA2 loci.  
Moreover, other components of HR and repair pathway could be affected. 
Individuals inheriting germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk of cancer development, 
mostly breast and ovarian cancers. Alsop et al. identified a germline BRCA1/2 mutation frequency of 
16.6% in all women diagnosed with serous ovarian tumours (Alsop et al 2012). Women inheriting a 
mutated copy of BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a 39% and 11% risk, respectively, of developing ovarian cancer 
by the age of 70 (Antoniou et al 2003). The 5-year overall survival is 44% for BRCA1 carriers, 52% for 
BRCA2 carriers and 36% for noncarriers (Bolton et al, 2012). The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutation 
carriers in the general population is around 0.2%; however, it can vary significantly between different 
European countries or some ethnic groups due to founder effect (Janavicius, 2010).  
In vitro data showed an increased sensitivity to platinum-based drugs in BRCA1 mutant cells (Lafarge et 
al 2001, Quinn at al 2003).  Platinum agents induce DNA DSBs that require homologous recombination for 
effective and accurate repair and homologous recombination deficiencies are thought to result in the high 
degree of platinum sensitivity seen in ovarian cancer (Bowtell 2010). In Europe, testing for germline 
BRCA mutations is routinely performed by multiple laboratories, in accordance with local clinical practice. 
Testing is offered routinely to ovarian and breast cancer patients where personal and family histories 
indicate that a patient might be at risk of harbouring a germline BRCA mutation.  
In individuals inheriting a germline BRCA mutation, whilst the inherited mutation is present in all cells of 
the body, only one allele carries the mutation. The half-dosage of BRCA1 or BRCA2 protein could lead to 
initial genomic instability in certain types of tissues, like in ovary or breast. When both copies of the gene 
are altered or mutated cancer development might be promoted. Individuals with germline BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutations have also increased risk of other types of cancer (Moran et al, 2012). 
Somatic BRCA mutations were less studied an were reported in 6-7% of patients without germline 
mutation (Alsop et al 2012; Hennessy et al, 2010). Nevertheless, some reports provide higher 
frequencies (Pennington et al, 2014). 
About the product 
Olaparib is an inhibitor of human poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 11/187 
  
  
When olaparib is bound to the active site of DNA associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and 
traps it on the DNA, thus blocking repair (Helleday 2011; Murai et al. 2012). In replicating cells this leads 
to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) when replication forks meet the PARP DNA adduct. In normal cells, 
homologous recombination repair (HRR), which requires functional BRCA1 and 2 genes, is effective at 
repairing these DNA double strand breaks.  
In the absence of functional BRCA1 or 2, DNA DSBs cannot be repaired via HRR. Instead, alternative and 
error-prone pathways are activated, such as the non homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, leading to 
increased genomic instability. After a number of rounds of replication genomic instability can reach 
insupportable levels and result in cancer cell death, as cancer cells have a high DNA damage load relative 
to normal cells (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Whilst olaparib does not potentiate the activity of platinum agents per se, the DNA damage effect caused 
by each individual agent is expected to be additive. Platinum agents in the clinic are routinely given at the 
maximum tolerated dose, require intermittent cyclical administration to allow for recovery of bone 
marrow toxicity and despite this can still only be administered for a limited number of cycles during each 
treatment course. Olaparib is proposed to be used in the maintenance therapy commencing after patients 
have already received the maximum benefit from platinum therapy. 
The claimed indication for olaparib was as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal) who are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based 
chemotherapy.  
The recommended indication for olaparib is as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or 
partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy (see SmPC section 4.1).  
Platinum sensitive is defined as disease progressing at least 6 months after completion of the penultimate 
platinum chemotherapy (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Treatment with olaparib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Patients must have confirmation of a breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation (either germline 
or tumour) before olaparib treatment is initiated. BRCA mutation status should be determined by an 
experienced laboratory using a validated test method.  
Genetic counselling for patients with BRCA mutations should be performed according to local regulations 
(see SmPC section 4.2).  
The drug product is supplied as 50 mg hard capsules for oral use (see SmPC section 2). 
The recommended dose is 400 mg (eight 50 mg capsules) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily 
dose of 800 mg. 
Patients should start treatment with olaparib no later than 8 weeks after completion of their final dose of 
the platinum containing regimen. It is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the 
underlying disease (see SmPC section 4.2).

The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 50 mg of olaparib as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  lauryl macrogolglycerides (LMG), for the capsule shell: hypromellose, titanium 
dioxide (E171), gellan gum, potassium acetate, for the capsule printing ink : shellac, iron oxide black 
(E172). 
The product is available in HDPE plastic bottle with a child-resistant closure. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of olaparib is 
4-[(3-{[4-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]carbonyl}-4-fluorophenyl)methyl]phthalazin-1(2H)-one 
and has the following structure: 
Olaparib is a white to pale yellow non hygroscopic crystalline powder. The active substance is very slightly 
soluble in water, slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol and sparingly soluble in methanol.  Olaparib is 
classified as having low solubility and low permeability by the Biopharmaceutical Classification System 
(BCS Class 4). Olaparib has a non - chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has been observed. Four 
polymorphic forms of olaparib were identified and one of them is consistently formed during the active 
substance manufacturing process and used in the manufacture of the finished product. This polymorphic 
form is kinetically favoured and is preferentially formed during the manufacturing process. One of the 
other potential polymorphic form that may be produced during the process is more thermodynamically 
stable at temperature below 60˚C. The thermodynamic relationship between polymorphic form produced 
and the more thermodynamically stable polymorphic form has been satisfactorily discussed as well as the 
conditions necessary to produce other unwanted forms which are mostly precluded by Olaparib process. 
The structure of olaparib has been confirmed using batch manufactured according to the synthetic route 
used during early development by elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, 1H, 19F and 13C-NMR, IR and 
single crystal XRD. Confirmation of the identity of the current reference standard of olaparib 
manufactured using the current route of synthesis has been confirmed using NMR spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. Further characterisation of the current reference standard batch 
has also been performed: UV spectrum, GVS plot, DSC and TGA plots.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Olaparib is synthesized in nine main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. A major issue was initially raised around starting material selection and 
therefore it was proposed by the applicant to include the 2 stages preceding one of the originally proposed 
starting materials. Seven of the nine steps involve the making or breaking of covalent bonds, the eighth 
step  comprises  isolation  of  crude  olaparib  and  the  ninth  step  is  micronization.  The  different  steps  of 
olaparib manufacture will be performed by three different sites.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of QbD. Designs of Experiments (DoE) have been performed for six of the steps.  Process 
parameters as proposed for all stages were generally defined on the basis of factorial experimental design 
(FED).  For  parameters  not  included  in  FEDs  either  additional  data  were  provided  in  support  of  the 
proposed ranges or normal operating ranges were proposed. The critical steps whose variability has an 
impact  on  a  critical  quality  attribute  in  the  active  substance  were  identified  and  critical  process 
parameters (CPP) were provided. 
Based on data submitted, the proposed ranges for process parameters are acceptable as they correspond 
to the ranges explored in the DoEs. Absence of details such as type of experimental design, list of design 
runs,  statistical  analysis,  establishment  of  CPP  and  non-CPP  status  for  each  factor  etc.  is  deemed 
acceptable as no Design Space has been claimed. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been  presented.  Validation  data  for  the  analytical  methods  used  to  control  two  of  the  intermediate 
products are missing and the CHMP recommended providing these data. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. Absence of routine control of impurities that may originate from starting 
materials or potential by-products has been justified. Considering the safety profile of olaparib (genotoxic 
and teratogenic), it has been agreed not to control the potential genotoxic imprurities to the threshold of 
toxicological concern (TTC) or to the staged TTC.  
Batch  data  from  40  batches  of  micronised  olaparib  were  presented.  Six  batches  of  the  40  were 
manufactured by proposed commercial synthetic route at the proposed manufacturing site. Five of the six 
batches were production scale batches. The results were within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Specification 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
The active substance critical quality attributes (CQA) are provided and their control strategy is described 
(IPC, starting material, intermediate or active substance testing).  
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification chemical and polymorphic  
(NIR), assay (HPLC), content of one of the other potential polymorphic form  (NIR), impurities (HPLC), 
particle  size  (Laser  diffraction),  residual  solvents  (NMR  spectroscopy  or  GC),  water  content  (KF)  and 
sulfated ash/residue on ignition (USP/Ph. Eur.). XRPD method has been added as a reference method in 
the scope of the NIR polymorphic identification method. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
NIR  methods  for  identification  (chemical  and  polymorphism)  and  quantification  of  one  of  the  other 
potential  polymorphic  form  have  been  appropriately  described  and  validated  in  line  with  the  note  for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 14/187 
  
  
guidance “Guideline on the use of near infrared spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data 
requirements to new submissions and variations”. Absence of a reference method for the quantification of 
one of the other potential polymorphic form was deemed acceptable considering the limitation of available 
alternative solid-state analysis methods sufficiently accurate. A detailed method maintenance protocol 
has been submitted together with a suitable Post Approval Change Management Protocol for both NIRS 
methods (Identification/Polymorphic Form and Quantification of one of the other potential polymorphic 
form).    In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommended  performing  parallel  testing  by  XRPD  on  10  commercial 
batches in order to demonstrate additional validation of the NIR methods. 
Batch  data  from  40  batches  of  micronised  olaparib  were  presented.  Six  batches  of  the  40  were 
manufactured by proposed commercial synthetic route at the proposed manufacturing site. Five of the six 
batches were production scale batches. The results were within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  3  production  scale  batches  of  active  substance  manufactured  via  the  proposed 
commercial synthetic route and stored in the intended commercial package for 48 months under long 
term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and intermediate condition at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The stability batches were not manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site. Commitment has been 
undertaken to carry out long-term (25°C/60 % RH) and accelerated (40°C/75% RH) stability studies on 
the three early commercial batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing sites. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  and  thermal  stress  conditions  (50˚C/ambient 
humidity) were performed on one batch.  
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, organic impurities, water, polymorphic form by 
XRD  (except  for  thermal  stress  study),  particle  size  distribution  by  laser  diffraction  (except  for 
photostability study). Microbiological testing and content of one of the other potential polymorphic form 
by NIR were only tested at the 36 month time point for 3 stability batches for the 25°C/60% RH and 
30°C/65% RH conditions.  
The specification limits and analytical procedures for those parameters tested during stability are identical 
to those employed during release testing except for polymorphism and particle size distribution. Details 
on laser diffraction method and X-Ray Diffraction method have been provided along with validation data. 
All parameters tested have remained within the limits of specification requirements for all samples. No 
trend of degradation is observed. No change in polymorphic form was observed after 36 months. Only a 
slight reduction is observed for the particle size at D(v,50).  
Forced degradation studies of olaparib were also performed to assess the potential degradation pathway 
of  the  active  substance  in  the  solid  state  and  on  the  active  substance  in  organo-aqueous  solutions. 
According to forced degradation studies results, Olaparib in the solid state is highly stable with respect to 
thermal, hydrolytic and photolytic degradation.  Olaparib in solution is significantly degraded under basic 
and oxidative conditions. Only slight degradation occurs under acid and hydrolytic conditions. Olaparib is 
not light sensitive. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier(s)  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the formulation work was to develop an immediate release dosage form allowing a maximised 
exposure of the poorly soluble active substance. 
During early development stage, a tablet formulation and a capsule formulation using semi-solid Lauroyl 
macrogolglyceride (LMG) matrix were studied. Capsule formulation was selected for its better relative 
bioavailability found in a pre-clinical study in dogs. 
Initial formulation development focussed on two enabling approaches to improve the bioavailability of this 
poorly soluble compound: a solution in capsule and a crystalline solid dispersion in capsule. 
The range of materials evaluated for a liquid solution formulation included different hydrophilic, lipophilic 
and amphiphilic liquid vehicles. All of these solvents demonstrated too low solubilisation capacity and 
were thus discounted for this formulation type. A solution formulation was discounted based on greater 
potential  problems  with  capsule  leakage,  stability  and  excipient/active  substance  interactions  in 
comparison to the crystalline solid dispersion. 
Other solid dispersion vehicles were screened in early development and the decision was made to develop 
the  product  based  on  LMG  over  the  other  solid  dispersion  types,  based  on  the  more  appropriate 
processing temperatures combined with the reported bioavailability-enhancing effect of LMG. 
Following selection of the LMG excipient, stability studies demonstrated that the product was stable and 
produced consistent dissolution performance throughout shelf life. Hypromellose capsules were chosen 
because leakage or embrittlement was observed upon storage with gelatine capsules. Olaparib capsules 
do not require additional components to prevent leakage or ensure stability. 
The  impact  of  drug  loading  on  bioavailability  was  further  investigated  in  dogs.  As  the  drug  loading 
increased, a decrease in exposure was observed due to a reduction in the drug: LMG ratio. Based upon 
this data the drug loading for the capsule formulation was fixed. 
In order to maximise the exposure of the active substance, it was chosen to increase the surface area by 
micronisation since the phase 1 development studies. 
Although drug loading has been optimized to the highest possible level within the selected dispersant 
excipient, the percentage of active substance in the finished product remains very low considering the 
recommended posology (daily intake of 16 capsules size 0). The retained formulation is considered by the 
applicant to be the best compromise between active substance solubilisation and drug loading. Olaparib 
50 mg capsule has been administered to 801 patients across the 8-years clinical programme, using the 
maximum recommended posology for at least 1-year treatment with no evidence of compliance issues. 
The  justifications  provided  by  the  applicant  regarding  concerns  raised  on  long-term  compliance  were 
accepted considering the therapeutic indication and the medical need. 
Transfer to commercial site and scale-up was done before the end of phase 1 clinical stage. No qualitative 
or quantitative changes were made since then to the olaparib capsule formulation, except for the addition 
of a black radial band printed on the body and cap of the capsule shell.

All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards  or  food  additive  standard.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The capsules are manufactured using conventional processes. It involves the formation of a suspension of 
active substance in molten excipient. The molten bulk material is filled into capsules. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The critical quality attributes 
identified were: description, assay, uniformity of dosage units, degradation products, dissolution. 
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments  to  identify  the  critical  product  quality  attributes  and  critical  process  parameters.  A  risk 
analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical 
process  steps  and  process  parameters  that  may  have  an  influence  on  the  finished  product  quality 
attributes. No categorization of the effects has been done but the main variables have been considered in 
the  experiments.  The  risk  identification  was  based  on  the  prior  knowledge  of  products  with  similar 
formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development, 
process design and scale-up studies.  
The critical process parameters have been identified. 
It  is  noted  that  DoEs  performed  did  not  cover  all  the  possible,  and  some  final  PARs  have  not  been 
extensively  tested.  However  taking  into  account  that  the  manufacturing  process  consists  in  few  unit 
operations with relatively few process parameters to handle and that potentially introduced variability in 
the process is further limited due to the fact that input materials (active substance and one excipient) 
have well defined specifications regarding functional attributes, it was considered that risk for interactions 
throughout the different unit operations is reduced. In that context, and as far as the investigated CQAs 
are concerned, it was acknowledged that a collection of multiple linear ranges of process parameters has 
been obtained without any significant interaction. 
During clinical studies phase 1, the manufacturing process was transferred to the proposed commercial 
manufacturing  site  and  scale.  A  comparative  pharmacokinetic  study  was  performed  in  dogs  to 
demonstrate that the performance of the capsules manufactured at the commercial site is similar to the 
capsules from the development site. With the exception of minor changes made to the ink printing design 
on  the  capsule  shells,  no  changes  to  the  product  or  manufacturing  process  are  planned  between  the 
pivotal clinical study and the to be marketed product. Development data generated on clinical batches 
manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site were considered to be fully representative of the 
commercial  product,  consequently,  no  clinical  bioequivalence  or  formulation  bridging  studies  were 
considered necessary to link the pivotal clinical study and the commercial product. 
The  discriminatory  power  of  the  dissolution  method  has  been  investigated.  The  proposed  dissolution 
method for routine quality control has shown to be discriminant for active substance particle size and for 
drug  loading.  However,  the  method  is  not  sensitive  enough  to  discriminate  the  different  polymorphic 
forms. Nevertheless, the overall control strategy was considered appropriate to compensate for this gap, 
a specific NIR method being in place for the monitoring of the polymorphic form in routine. 
The primary packaging is a HDPE plastic bottle with a child-resistant closure. The material complies with 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: melting of LMG, mixing of olaparib and LMG, capsule 
filling, capsule cooling and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 17/187 
  
  
An evaluation of the process performance has been completed using data from clinical trial manufacture 
to  provide  further  evidence  of  the  acceptability  and  robustness  of  the  proposed  process.  The  data 
generated  through  the  manufacture  and  testing  of  30  clinical  batches  has  been  used  to  evaluate  the 
capability of the proposed commercial manufacturing process. A formal validation will be completed prior 
to commercial launch, according to the provided validation scheme. 
The maximum holding time and process duration is specified as validated on commercial clinical batches. 
The start of shelf-life is confirmed to be compliant with the Note for Guidance on the start of shelf-life of 
the finished dosage form CPMP/QWP/072/96. The CHMP recommended performing a formal bulk stability 
study on 2 commercial batches of olaparib capsules. 
The impact of the manufacturing process on olaparib polymorphism was discussed. It was concluded that 
process parameters such as temperatures, mixing durations, holding times and cooling conditions do not 
have an impact on levels of the other potential polymorphic form in the finished product. 
Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for the following steps of the medicinal product: preparation 
of bulk material, capsule filling. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch 
analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. It has been demonstrated that 
the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a 
reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
description  (visual),  identity  (UV  and  UHPLC),  assay  (UHPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC), 
dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.,  HPLC),  microbial  quality,  degradation  products  (UHPLC).  In  addition,  shelf-life 
specifications also include a test for the content of one of the other potential polymorphic form (NIR). The 
absence  of  a  test  for  the  content  of  one  of  the  other  potential  polymorphic  form  in  the  release 
specifications  was  accepted  considering  that  drug  product  manufacturing  process    provides  adequate 
control of polymorph at time of release . 
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The in house analytical procedures are described and validated. Stress conditions studies including acidic, 
basic  and  oxidising  conditions  have  been  investigated  showing  that  the  assay  method  is  stability 
indicating. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  30  batches  (29  are  production  scale  batches)  confirming  the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 production batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for  36 months 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate (30°C/65% RH and 30°C/75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description (visual), assay (LC), dissolution (Ph. Eur., HPLC), water content (Karl 
Fischer), microbial quality (Ph. Eur.) , degradation products (LC) .  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014

Although  the  used  methods  of  control  for  assay  and  degradation  products  are  not  those  described  in 
3.2.P.5.2, the stability data can be considered as acceptable. The stability methods have been described 
and validation data have been provided. Comparative data with both methodologies have been generated 
on samples from the 36 month time point of the primary ICH stability studies. These results show no 
significant difference. 
In addition commitment is undertaken to repeat the stability studies using the process validation batches 
to support the shelf life of 36 months when stored below 30°C with the approved methods.  
Regarding the microbiological property of the drug product, the microbial enumeration was performed for 
the ICH primary study at release and at the end of shelf life for information only. A water activity test was 
conducted  on  each  batch  punctually.  Results  obtained  indicate  that  the  sample  is  unlikely  to  support 
microbial growth. This test has been described and validated. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Active Substances and Medicinal Products. The drug product was found not to be sensitive to light. 
Additional in-use stability studies have been conducted on two batches of capsules previously stored 36 
months at 30°C/75% RH to provide data to support the time after which the bottle may be opened and in 
use. The bottle contains a one week supply of capsules. 
Samples of these batches were subsequently stored in conditions simulating the conditions the capsules 
may be exposed to once the bottle is opened. 
Supporting stability study results were provided. One additional batch of capsules has been placed on 
stability within a HDPE bottle to support clinical studies. This batch was manufactured at commercial scale 
in  the  commercial  manufacturing  facility.  They  are  stored  at  5°C,  30°C/65%  RH,  30°C/75%  RH  and 
40°C/75% RH. 
The duration of the stability study is 4 years and this study is complete. 
In addition an open stress study (4 weeks at 40°C/75% RH) has been performed. 
Bulk stability was studied. One batch of capsules, manufactured in the commercial manufacturing facility, 
has been placed on stability within a simulated bulk pack. Study conditions retained for storage time, 
storage temperature and bulk pack headspace simulate a worst case stress storage condition. Results 
support the proposed holding time.  
The stability data of the ICH primary study and in-use stability study show there is no significant effect on 
the physical and chemical characteristics of capsules. 
Regarding the investigation of one of the other potential polymorphic form, a large number of data was 
presented  for  several  batches  stored  under  non-ICH  or  uncontrolled  conditions.  The  other  potential 
polymorphic  form  was  not  detected  in  these  batches  tested  at  one  time-point  ranging  from  1  to  39 
months.  
For 3 stability batches, the content of the other potential polymorphic form was evaluated by the NMR or 
NIR methods at one time-point and then after a period longer than the initial proposed shelf-life of 3 
years. The results indicate that the other potential polymorphic form was not detected after 18 months 
whereas after 43 months, the level of the other potential polymorphic form is above the proposed limit.  
On the basis of these results, showing out of specification results after 43 months, and given the fact that 
no stability results are available for the other potential polymorphic form in batches stored under ICH 
conditions  and  tested  at  regular  intervals,  only  a  shelf  life  of  2  years  could  be  granted.  The  CHMP 
recommended performing on the process validation batches scheduled to be manufactured a full repeat

ICH  stability  study  in  which  polymorphic  form  will  be  routinely  monitored  up  to  36  months  using  the 
quantitative NIR method. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
A  concern  was  raised  during  the  procedure  in  view  of  the  limited  drug  loading  considering  the 
recommended posology (daily intake of 16 capsules size 0). It was clarified that other formulations have 
been  tested  with  even  lower  active  substance  solubilisation  properties.  The  retained  formulation  is 
considered by the applicant to be the best compromise between active substance solubilisation and drug 
loading.  Olaparib  50  mg  capsule  has  been  administered  to  801  patients  across  the  8-years  clinical 
programme, using the maximum recommended posology for at least 1-year treatment with no evidence 
of compliance issues. This justification is accepted considering the therapeutic indication and the medical 
need. 
Major issues were initially raised in relation to the polymorphism. Another polymorph was detected, which 
is less soluble than the claimed polymorph used for the manufacture of the finished product.  In response 
to  the  LoQ,  the  applicant  provided  a  set  of  additional  data  to  clarify  the  thermodynamic  relationship 
between the main polymorph produced and the other polymorph.  It was demonstrated that there is low 
risk for solid-solid transformation between the two forms. Further studies performed using wet dispersion 
laser  diffraction  show  that  the  active  substance  remains  in  a  crystallized  state  within  the  excipient. 
Considering the result of the characterization of the physical state of the active substance in the final 
product  (crystallized  solid  dispersion  of  active  substance  within  lauroyl  macrogol  glycerides),  the 
likelihood  for  interconversion  of  the  main  polymorph  produced  to  the  other  polymorph,  in  the  drug 
product upon storage can be considered low as well.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product 
manufacturing processes. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
active substance nor for the finished product. 
An analysis of the finished product process, focusing on process parameters having a potential impact on 
finished product CQAs, has been carried out. Main experiments details and results are presented in order 
to support the process settings in the description of the manufacturing process. According to the data, all 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 20/187 
 
  
  
product CQAs investigated were within specifications with a great safety margin, without any significant 
impact of the process parameters within the ranges tested.  
The outcome of the development studies identifies the critical process parameters. Data were provided to 
support  the  proposed  process  parameters  settings  in  relation  to  their  impact  on  polymorphism 
transformation using a quantitative NIR method to detect presence of one of  the other polymorph in the 
drug product. All in-life tested samples showed no detectable level of the other polymorph whereas the 
other polymorph was detected in some out of life samples. Based on the provided data supported by a 
validated NIR method, and on the characterization of the physical state of the active substance within the 
drug product, the proposed ranges for the main operating parameters and operating conditions in the 
manufacturing  process  description  (temperatures,  mixing  durations,  holding  times  and  cooling 
conditions)  were  considered  satisfactory.  No  additional  control  of  the  other  polymorph  is  proposed  at 
release  which  is  accepted.  Furthermore,  since  the  ability  of  polymorphic  conversion  to  occur  in  the 
capsule product in aged out of life samples has been unexpectedly observed, an end of life specification 
limit for one of the other olaparib  polymorph was proposed in the drug product specification at end of 
shelf life. This limit was supported by a biopharmaceutics evaluation. It was based on consideration for 
the impact of the level of olaparib other polymorph on safety and efficacy for the patient. The proposed 
limit for olaparib  other polymorph is reasonable in view of the limit of quantitation of the NIR method. 
Overall the proposed specification limit was considered conservative. 
2.2.1.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.2.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-  performing  parallel  testing  by  XRPD  on  10  commercial  batches  of  olaparib  in  order  to  demonstrate 
additional validation of the NIR methods 
- providing validation data for the analytical methods for 2 intermediates. 
- performing a formal bulk stability study on 2 commercial batches of olaparib capsules  
- performing on the process validation batches scheduled to be manufactured a full repeat ICH stability 
study in which polymorphic form will be routinely monitored up to 36 months using the quantitative NIR 
method 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All studies including Safety Pharmacology and pivotal Toxicology studies were performed in compliance 
with GLP. For the safety pharmacology study 0088/453 (KMD008), the Applicant refers to a non-GLP PK 
study for pharmacokinetic parameters.

Olaparib is also referred to as AZD2281, KU-0059436, KU0059436, COCE42, CO-CE42 and/or 
CO-CE000042 in some of these studies. 
ERA studies were conducted in accordance with OECD Principles of Good Laboratory Practices. 
Protocol assistance was given in relation to carcinogenicity, peri-and post-natal studies and duration of 
repeated dose toxicity studies. The CHMP agreed that the carcinogenicity and peri- and post-natal study 
were considered unnecessary in the context of treating patients with serious ovarian cancer as olaparib is 
already known to be embryolethal and teratogenic. Duration of 6 month of repeated dose toxicity studies 
in two species was also considered sufficient. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology

The KuDOS cell line is a cross-tumour 
type panel consisting of 95 cancer cell 
lines. The panel comprises of colorectal, 
breast, ovarian, pancreatic, head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC). 
This study was conducted to determine 
the growth inhibitory activity of olaparib 
across a broad range of cancer cell lines 
and tissue types. A comparison was also 
undertaken with the response of the 
breast cancer cell line panel of direct 
DNA damaging chemotherapy agents 
with different mechanisms of action. 
This included Carboplatin (a platinum 
salt DNA cross-linking agent), 
Camptothecin (a 
topoisomerase-Iinhibitor), Doxorubicin 
(a DNA intercalator/ Topoisomerase-II 
inhibitor) and Paclitaxel (a microtubule 
stabiliser).

The optimization of a series of 
4-benzyl-2H-phthalazin-1-ones led to 
the identification of olaparib as 
described in Menear et al, 2008. 
Olaparib activity against PARP-1, 
PARP-2 and another PARP family 
member. 
Using long-term colony formation 
assays (CFA), a head-to-head 
comparative study of cancer cell line 
growth inhibition was conducted 
between olaparib and platinum-based 
chemotherapy agents (platinum and 
carboplatin). A strong, positive and 
statistically significant correlation was 
observed between olaparib and the 
platinum-based chemotherapeutic 
agents, carboplatin and cisplatin, across 
a panel of 12 breast, 11 head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), 10 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
11 ovarian cancer cell lines. 
0.018 µM 
through to >10 
µM 
A broad range, continuum of growth 
inhibitory (IC 50) activity for olaparib was 
observed across the cell line panel (ranging 
from 0.018 µM through to >10 µM).  
A strong, positive correlation was seen 
between olaparib and both carboplatin or 
camptothecin chemotherapeutic agents, a 
weak correlation observed for doxorubicin 
and no correlation with paclitaxel activity.  
Associations with enhanced olaparib 
sensitivity (IC 50<1µM) were observed in 
cell lines with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutations or low expression of HRR 
genes/proteins. 
Low expression of the target PARP1 gene or 
high expression of ABCB1 (P-gp) drug 
transporter gene were associated with less 
olaparib sensitivity or drug resistance. 
⇒ While a broad range, continuum of 
growth inhibitory (IC 50) activity for olaparib 
was observed across the cell line panel 
(ranging from 0.018 µM through to >10 
µM), associations with enhanced olaparib 
sensitivity (IC 50 <1 µM) were observed in 
cell lines with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutations or low expression of HRR 
genes/proteins.  
These data are consistent with the 
proposed mechanism of action of PARP 
inhibitors, where deficiencies in HRR leads 
to an inability to repair DNA DSBs resulting 
from PARP inhibitor treatment. 
IC 50 = 5 nM (for PARP-1 enzyme) and IC 50 
= 1 nM (for enzyme PARP-2 enzyme). 
IC 50 for Tankyrase-1 is equal to 1500 nM. 
A very strong and statistically significant 
correlation was observed between olaparib 
and platinum agent sensitivity across a 
panel of breast, HNSCC, NSCLC and ovarian 
cancer cell lines. Cisplatin and Carboplatin 
sensitivity were also strongly correlated 
with each other, as expected. The cell lines 
that were more sensitive to platinum 
agents showed sensitivity to olaparib (or 
vice versa), irrespective of tumour type.

Long-term treatment with AZD2281 in this

resistance, caused by up-regulation of 
Abcb1a/b genes encoding P-glycoprotein 
efflux pumps. This resistance to AZD2281 
could be reversed by coadministration of 
the P-glycoprotein inhibitor tariquidar.

Study KTS00049: 
The effective concentration for inhibiting 
cellular PARP activity in cancer cells by 
>90% is approximately 30 nM to 100 nM 
Olaparib in several tumour cell lines 
including ovarian A2780, breast MCF-7, and 
colorectal SW620.

Data suggest that for efficacy in the 
HBCx-10 preclinical model, either the 
PARP-1 IC 50 = 120 nM needs to be 
exceeded for 10 to 12 hours or IC90 (576 
nM) needs to be achieved for 4 to 7 hours. 
A clear correlation was observed between 
olaparib and cisplatin sensitivity in both 
breast and lung PTX models.  
In platinum sensitive breast models, the 
addition of cisplatin to olaparib resulted in a 
prolongation of tumour regression.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Olaparib was tested in a panel of 239 in vitro radioligand binding and enzyme assays, covering a diverse 
panel of molecular targets including enzymes, receptors, transporters and ion channels (Studies 0818SY, 
8157  and  8234).  In  these  studies,  olaparib  at  a  single  concentration  of  10  μM  showed  no  significant 
activity (defined as >50% inhibition) against any of these targets. Olaparib was also tested in vitro in 
electrophysiological assays assessing 7 types of human recombinant voltage-gated cardiac ion channel 
and was shown to be inactive up to a maximum concentration of 31.6 μM (Study 0818SY).

Olaparib had no significant activity in 6 in vitro phosphodiesterase 
binding assays at a concentration of 10 µM. 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed to investigate the effects of olaparib on cardiovascular, 
central nervous and respiratory system. Safety pharmacology of olaparib was evaluated by analysis of the 
effects on tail currents of the human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) channel in vitro, and on heart 
rate, blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) in vivo in anaesthetised dogs. Additionally, effects of 
olaparib on Central Nervous System (CNS) in rats and respiratory function in dogs were evaluated.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The preclinical Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) studies were conducted in the 
same species and strains as used in the pharmacology and toxicology studies. The formulations used in 
the disposition studies were generally the same as those used in the pivotal toxicity studies; oral doses 
were administered by gavage. In vitro investigations were performed in isolated human tissue and in 
animal or insect derived tissue that expressed specific human drug metabolism and transport proteins 
(see table below).

Multiple dose toxicokinetics 
After 14 daily doses, Cmax in male and female mice was much lower than on day 1 at all dose levels (in 
male mice, Cmax after 14 doses at 200 mg/kg/day was only 11.6% of value after a single dose and in 
female mice only 8.7% after 14 doses at 100 mg/kg/day). No clear relationship between Cmax and dose 
was observed. Exposure (AUC(0-24)) was also much lower in male and female mice after multiple doses 
(14.8% in male and 20.1% in female mice at 200 mg/kg/day) although a smaller than proportional 
increase in dose was observed. These data indicated either a change in oral absorption or induction of 
olaparib clearance may have occurred in animals of both sexes although this was not investigated. 
In the rat study 2229/037, after 28 single daily oral doses, AUC(0-24) was unchanged in both sexes 
compared to day 1 at the low dose, approximately 20% lower in both sexes at the mid dose and 30% 
(male) and 45% (female) lower at the high dose; this may indicate increased drug transporter or 
metabolism mediated clearance at the mid and top doses after 1 months exposure. 
In study T110012, after 26 weeks of daily dosing, Cmax data were similar to those after single doses at 
the low and mid doses. However, in this study Cmax was slightly higher at the top dose (1.3 and 1.2 fold 
higher in male and female rats respectively) after 26 weeks dosing in contrast to the moderate decrease 
observed after 28 days. In this study, exposure was reduced by ~30% in male rats after 6 months dosing 
at 30 mg/kg/day. 
Olaparib exposures achieved in the rat embryofoetal development dose range-finding study (1555RR) 
and in the female rat fertility study (1557GR) were in line with those achieved in the 1 and 6-month 
studies and confirmed the tendency for exposure to increase more than proportionally with increasing 
dose.  
In study 2229/038 and after 28 single daily oral doses, AUC(0-24) at the low dose was unchanged in male 
dogs and slightly higher in female dogs; this probably reflects minor variability in the data. At the mid and 
high dose the AUC(0-24) after multiple doses was similar to after single doses. Exposure increased less 
than in proportion to dose in male and female dogs after 28 doses; this may indicate saturated absorption 
at high doses. 
In study T110011, after 26 weeks of daily dosing, Cmax data were similar to those after single doses and 
there was no convincing evidence of drug accumulation.

Distribution 
Plasma protein binding 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of [14C]-olaparib was assessed in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma 
over the concentration range 0.010 to 10.0 µg/ml in study KPJ019. 
Olaparib at 0.010 to 10.0 μg/ml (0.023 to 23.0 μM) demonstrated low binding to plasma proteins in in 
vitro studies. Binding was lowest in dog (38.1 to 45.3% unbound), followed by mouse (28.4 to 30.6% 
unbound), rat (26.5 to 27.3% unbound) and human (8.8 to 18.1% unbound). Protein binding was 
independent of olaparib concentration in mouse and rat plasma. In dog and human plasma, the unbound 
fraction was greater at 10.0 μg/ml than at lower concentrations. 
The effect of LMG, a constituent of the olaparib clinical capsule formulation, on [14C]-olaparib plasma 
protein binding was also investigated (KPJ043). Plasma was collected from naïve healthy male and female 
human volunteers (2 per cohort) and from the same volunteers after twice daily administration of LMG in 
capsules, for 4.5 days, at doses of either 1000 or 4000 mg (equivalent to 2000 mg/day or 8000 mg/day). 
The olaparib free fraction was similar in plasma collected after administration of either 2000 or 8000 
mg/day LMG and in neither case was there a statistically significant difference in the free fraction 
compared to plasma collected from naïve volunteers. The proportion of olaparib bound to plasma proteins 
was similar to that measured previously in study KPJ019 and there was no evidence of a sex related 
difference in binding. 
An additional study (Covance 829103) investigated [14C]-olaparib protein binding in mouse, rat, dog and 
human plasma across an extended concentration range (0.1, 1, 10, 20, 40 µg/mL (0.23 to 92.1 µM)). 
Where the olaparib concentrations were similar to those used previously (KPJ019), the free fraction was 
consistent with the earlier study. In human plasma, the free faction was increased at the extended 
concentrations of 46 and 92.1 μM (both supra-therapeutic) although the increase in free fraction was less 
than proportional to the change in drug concentration. 
Distribution in blood cells 
In study KPJ019, the distribution of [14C]-olaparib between blood cells and plasma, following in vitro 
incubation with whole blood from male mice, rats, dogs and human volunteers, was investigated. 
Association with blood cells was moderate at 25 and 24% in mouse and rat blood respectively; no 
concentration dependence was observed in these species. In contrast, [14C]-olaparib had a greater 
association with dog blood cells and the interaction was concentration related with more drug binding to 
blood cells at higher than at lower concentrations (34% at 0.1 µg/ml and 44% at 10 µg/ml).  
Following oral administration of [14C]-olaparib to male and female rats in studies KMR017, KMR027 and 
KKR007, and to male dogs in study KMD008, the ratio of radioactivity in blood and plasma was assessed 
at pre-determined time points. In rat, the blood/plasma ratio was 0.65 to 0.75 shortly after dosing, 
indicating drug related material was mainly associated with plasma. The ratio changed at later times 
(0.82 to 0.84 at 12 hours) indicating a changed distribution of drug related material; this may reflect the 
presence of circulating metabolites. There was no marked sex difference in blood/plasma ratio in rats. In 
male dogs, the blood/plasma ratio data was similar to that in rat, with a minor change in distribution 
apparent at later times. 
Tissue distribution studies 
The distribution of radioactivity in rats was investigated by quantitative whole body autoradiography 
(QWBA) in studies KMR017 (male, albino rats) and KMR004 (male and female Lister hooded rats). The 
specific radioactivity was much higher in study KMR004 and this, coupled to the use of pigmented animals 
of both sexes made this a more informative study; concentrations of radioactivity from key tissues of 
male and female rats in study KMR004.

1h after administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-olaparib to male Lister hooded rats (study KMR004, 
15 mg/kg), radioactivity was widely distributed; maximal concentrations were measured in many tissues 
at this sample time. The highest concentrations of radioactivity were detected in a number of glandular 
tissues (e.g. adrenal, thyroid, Harderian, prostate and spleen) the mucosa of the upper and lower 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the liver, the bladder and the kidney. Distribution throughout the GI tract was 
typical of an oral drug. Radioactivity was below the limit of quantification in the brain and spinal cord and 
below the concentration in blood in many tissues. By 4h after dosing, concentrations of radioactivity had 
decreased in most tissue although the uveal tract (2.49 to 3.07), prostate (1.54 to 7.34) and seminal 
vesicles were notable exceptions; concentrations of radioactivity also increased in parts of the GI tract at 
this time although they decreased in liver (48.7 to 21.4) and kidney (10.2 to 4.2). By one day post dose, 
radioactivity was below the limit of quantification in the majority of tissues although it was still present at 
low levels in a small number of tissues including parts of the GI tract, excretory organs, pigmented skin 
and uveal tract. By 7 days after dosing, radioactivity was detectable by QWBA at low levels in only liver 
and uveal tract. Radioactivity was undetectable by QWBA in any tissues by 28 days after dosing although 
very low levels were detected in whole eye by LSC.  
Any binding of drug related material to melanin rich tissues (e.g. the uveal tract, pigmented skin) 
appeared to be of relatively short duration with levels of radioactivity in these tissues at 3 days after 
dosing being similar to those in the excretory organs. The distribution of radioactivity was similar for male 
and female animals although higher concentrations of radioactivity were present in many tissues of 
female animals than in the tissues of male animals at equivalent times; this was consistent with the PK 
findings described previously. 
The distribution of [14C]-olaparib in male albino Sprague-Dawley rats following a single oral dose (15 
mg/kg) was investigated by QWBA in study KMR017. The data were consistent with those from study 
KMR004 although the lower dose of radioactivity meant radioactivity was generally detected for a shorter 
period. A notable exception was in skin (non-pigmented) where levels of radioactivity slightly above the 
limit of quantification were measured at 48 hours. 
The tissue distribution of [14C]-olaparib in female BALB/c (albino) nude mice bearing HTC-116 human 
colorectal carcinoma tumours was investigated using QWBA (study KMM016). At six hours after dosing 
(first sampling point), the highest concentrations of radioactivity were associated with the liver and the 
organs and contents of the GI tract (not shown). Concentrations of radioactivity in many tissues were 
similar to those in blood although radioactivity was below the limit of quantification in brain, spinal cord 
and eye. Radioactivity was present at higher levels in tumour than blood. By 24 hours concentrations of 
radioactivity had fallen in most tissues; the highest concentrations continued to be associated with the 
liver and the organs and contents of the GI tract. In all tissues other than liver, tumour and GI tract, 
concentrations of radioactivity had fallen below the limit of quantification by 48 hours after dosing. 
Radioactivity was still measurable in liver, tumour and GI tract at 96 hours after dosing (final sampling 
point) resulting in estimated apparent tissue half-lives of 25.7 hours (liver) and 36.0 hours (tumour). 
Tissue/blood ratios showed that at 6 and 24 hours after dosing the concentrations of radioactivity in the 
tumour were 6 and 4 times higher than those in blood. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of [14C]-olaparib was investigated in rat, dog and human at doses representative of the 
toxicology programme or clinical use. Characterisation of olaparib metabolites was primarily focused on 
rat and human plasma and excreta while characterisation in dog was incomplete. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 30/187 
  
  
Following a single 100 mg oral dose of [14C]-olaparib to female patients, olaparib and 3 additional 
components were quantifiable in plasma. Olaparib represented 70% and the additional components 9 to 
14% of the plasma radioactivity. The additional components were identified as M12 (ring opened 
hydroxy-cyclopropyl), M15 (monooxygenated) and M18 (dehydrogenated piperazine); M18 was a 
positive ion MS source artifact from M39 (monooygenated) and it was M39 that was the plasma 
component. Each of M12, M15 and M18/M39 was also detected in male and female rat plasma, following 
single oral doses. 
However, although these metabolites represented 8 to 12% of the radioactivity in plasma from male rats, 
they were insufficiently abundant to be quantified in female rat plasma. Up to 20 other metabolites were 
present in human plasma although none could be quantified by radio-HPLC; 14 of these were not detected 
in rat or dog plasma although 13 were present in rat excreta, which indicated exposure in a key toxicology 
species. 
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-olaparib to female patients, approximately 44% and 42% was 
eliminated in urine and faeces respectively and olaparib was extensively metabolised. Olaparib was the 
most abundant component in urine (10 to 19% of dose) but at least 37 drug related components were 
present in urine and 18 were quantifiable. The most abundant (M15, monooxygenated) accounted for 4 to 
8% of the dose while the remainder each accounted for <2% of the dose. Olaparib was the most abundant 
component in faecal extract (<1 to 14% of dose) but at least 20 other drug-derived components were 
detected and 10 of these were quantifiable by radio-HPLC. As with urine, the most abundant was M15 (1 
to 8% of the dose) while M9, M12, M23 and M25 each accounted for approximately 6% of the dose. While 
most components in human excreta were also present in rat excreta, four minor human metabolites were 
absent from rat excreta, however, in each matrix each of these metabolites accounted for <1% of the 
dose. 
Following administration of single oral doses of [14C]-olaparib to male and female rats, parent drug was 
the most abundant component in both faeces (20 and 38% from male and female) and urine (4 and 21% 
from male and female). However, a larger proportion of the dose was eliminated as metabolites in the 
excreta of male than female rats. A wider range of metabolites was also detected in the excreta of male 
rats. These data were consistent with the sex difference noted in rat plasma pharmacokinetics and 
excretion. 
Following administration of single oral doses of [14C]-olaparib to male dogs, parent drug was the most 
abundant component in both faeces (31% of dose) and urine (5% of dose). Four other components were 
quantified in faecal extract (4 to 7% of the dose) and 3 in urine (<2% of the dose) although these 
metabolites were not fully identified. In rat and human, most of the metabolites investigated were Phase 
I products; the main sites of metabolism were the piperazine carboxycyclopropyl ring structure and to a 
lesser extent the fluorophenyl and the phathalazinone ring systems. The major metabolic processes were 
oxidations and hydroxylations and many products were the result of multiple metabolic transformations. 
Some minor products resulted from Phase II metabolism of previously formed Phase I products. 
Investigations in human in vitro systems indicated Phase I metabolism of olaparib was CYP mediated and 
that CYP3A4 and 3A5 were the dominant metabolic enzymes. As expression of CYPs 3A4 and 3A5 is highly 
variable in human and olaparib clearance in human was primarily metabolic, this may explain some of the 
variability observed in clinical pharmacokinetics.

Following administration of single oral doses of [14C]-olaparib to male and female rats, elimination was 
rapid (94% to 96% within 48h) and recovery was complete within 5 days. Faeces provided the major 
route of elimination of radioactivity in rats of both sex although a greater proportion of the dose was 
eliminated in the faeces of male rats. A corresponding sex difference in urinary elimination was observed 
with female rats eliminating a larger proportion of the dosed radioactivity by this route. Following single 
IV doses of [14C]-olaparib to bile duct cannulated male and female rats, the sex difference in elimination 
route was confirmed with male rats eliminating a much greater proportion of the dose in the bile. These 
findings were consistent with the sex difference in metabolism of olaparib in rat. 
After single oral and IV doses of [14C]-olaparib to male dogs, elimination was again rapid (91% and 99% 
within  48  hours  after  oral  and  IV  dosing)  and  recovery  complete  within  7  days.  Faecal  elimination 
provided the major route of elimination. 
The main metabolite in human urine  (M15) resulted from a single oxidation while the most abundant 
metabolites 
in  human 
faeces  (M12,  M15,  M23  and  M25)  resulted 
from  single  or  dual 
oxidations/hydroxylations. 
Following administration of single oral doses of [14C]-olaparib to male and female rats, parent drug was 
the most abundant component in both faeces (20% and 38% from male and female) and urine (4% and 
21% from male and female). However, a larger proportion of the dose was eliminated as metabolites in 
the excreta of male than female rats. A wider range of metabolites was also detected in the excreta of 
male rats. These data were consistent with the sex difference noted in rat plasma PK and excretion. 
Following administration of single oral doses of [14C]-olaparib to male dogs, parent drug was the most 
abundant component in both faeces (31% of dose) and urine (5% of dose). Four other components were 
quantified in faecal extract (4 to 7% of the dose) and 3 in urine (<2% of the dose) although these 
metabolites were not fully identified. 
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-olaparib to female patients, approximately 44% and 42% was 
eliminated in urine and faeces respectively. Olaparib was the most abundant component in urine (10 to 
19% of dose) but at least 37 drug related components were present in urine and 18 were quantifiable. The 
most abundant (M15, mono-oxygenated) accounted for 4 to 8% of the dose while the remainder each 
accounted for <2% of the dose. Olaparib was the most abundant component in faecal extract (<1 to 14% 
of dose) but at least 20 other drug derived components were detected and 10 of these were quantifiable 
by radio-HPLC. As with urine, the most abundant was M15 (1 to 8% of the dose) while M9, M12, M23 and 
M25 each accounted for approximately 6% of the dose (see section 2.4.2, pharmacokinetics). While most

components in human excreta were also present in rat excreta, four human metabolites were not 
detected in rat excreta, however, in each matrix each of these metabolites accounted for <1% of the 
dose. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Pharmacokinetics data from in vitro and ex vivo studies are presented and discussed in section 2.4.2 
(pharmacokinetics) of this report.  
Bioequivalence of Phase I development formulation and commercial site and scale batches 
During Phase I a decision was taken to establish the olaparib capsule manufacturing process at the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site and scale. A pre-clinical dog study was undertaken to compare 
olaparib PK data from dogs dosed with capsules from the development and commercial manufacturing 
sites. 
A comparison of the PK data using the t-test at 95% confidence limits, showed no significant difference 
between the batch from the commercial site and either of the batches from the development site for 
either Cmax (p values were 0.19 and 0.10 for BMR/07/429 and BMR/05/158 respectively) or AUC (p 
values were 0.15 and 0.08 for BMR/07/429 and BMR/05/158 respectively). These data indicated the 
performance of the material from the proposed commercial site is similar in dogs to olaparib capsules 
from the development site.

Major findings 
Fertility 
15  mg/kg/d:  showed  slight  toxicity  including  ↓  food  consumption 
during gestation and ↓ body weight gain from the first week of dosing 
that continued throughout gestation for main test animals. Recovery 
animals dosed with 15 mg/kg/day also had ↓ weight gain during the 
dosing  period  and  during  the  first  2  weeks  of  the  recovery  period, 
although during the latter part of the recovery period cumulative body 
weight gain was similar to that of recovery control animals. Maternal 
body weight gain for the recovery animals dosed with 15 mg/kg/day 
was  also  slightly  higher  than  controls  during  the  early  part  of 
gestation.  
↑ incidence of females that had extended oestrus.  
None of the recovery animals dosed with 15 mg/kg/day had extended 
oestrus after a minimum of 14 days recovery.  
There  was  no  effect  of  olaparib  on  mating  performance  or  fertility 
(ovulation and pregnancy rates) at any dose level. 
↓ embryofetal survival after dosing with 15 mg/kg/day for main test 
animals  resulted  in  a  slightly  ↓  %  of  live  foetuses  per  litter  (90% 
versus 96% for controls). There was no effect on embryofetal survival 
after dosing with 0.05 or 0.5 mg/kg/day. After the recovery period, 
there  was  no  decrement  in  embryofetal  survival  seen  for  animals 
previously dosed with olaparib at 15 mg/kg/day. 
There  were  no  significant  maternal  in-life  effects  after  dosing  with 
0.05 or 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
NOEL = 0.5 mg/kg/d.

Mean AUC (0-12) = 38.8 μg.h/ml h 
Estimated Mean AUC (0-24) = 76.6 μg.h/ml h 
AUC (0-24) is presented for rat and dog studies, except where indicated: * AUC (0-8). 
Human dose of 400 mg twice daily (bd) = 800 mg/day, equivalent to 6.67 mg/kg bd (for 60 kg human). 
h  Human  exposure  data  pooled  from  studies  D0810C00002,  D0810C00008,  D0810C00009,  D0810C00012  and 
D0810C00024. AUC (0-12) is calculated from samples taken over 12 hours post-dose; AUC (0-24) is estimated by doubling 
the AUC (0-12) values. 
Estimated mean total steady state AUC(0-24) after dosing at 400 mg bd (~6.67 mg/kg bd) in humans (76.6 
µg.h/ml) was approximately 5 to 13-fold higher than the mean total steady state exposure (AUC(0-8) for 
males and AUC(0-24) for females) achieved at the highest doses used on the pivotal rat 1 month repeat 
dose study (40 mg/kg/day) and approximately 11 to 18-fold higher than the mean total steady state 
AUC(0-24) at the highest doses used in the 6 month rat study (15/30 mg/kg/day). However, in the 7 day 
dose setting study in rats, mean total steady state AUC(0-24) at the high dose level (200 mg/kg/day) was 
approximately 1.3 to 2-fold higher than the estimated mean total steady state AUC(0-24) in humans at the 
clinical dose.

Olaparib showed little absorbance within the UV range of 290 to 700 nm, with the peak of absorbance 
occurring at 276 nm. The molar extinction coefficient determined at 290 nm was 5926 L.mol-1.cm-1. 
Further nonclinical studies assessing phototoxic potential in vitro or in vivo were not conducted. 
Myelotoxicity Studies with a Variety of Experimental Compounds 
To explore potential effects of Olaparib on the bone marrow, ex vivo studies were conducted using human 
bone marrow cells obtained from donors. These studies consisted of a colonyforming 
unit/granulocyte/monocyte assay (CFU-GM), in which cells were continuously exposed to Olaparib for 14 
days, and a bone marrow proliferation test, in which cells were continuously exposed to Olaparib for 3 
days. Olaparib had an IC50 value of 3.9 µM in the CFU-GM assay (from a single donor) and a mean IC50 
of 2.7 µM in the proliferation assay (n=4, range 1.05 to 4.6 µM). Olaparib was also tested for 
myelotoxicity in bone marrow cells obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats in the CFU-GM assay, in which 
cells were continuously exposed to olaparib for 14 days. In this study, Olaparib had an IC50 value of 0.33 
µM. 
14 Day Oral (Gavage) Tolerability and TK Study in the Mouse 
A repeat dose study was conducted in mice to explore Toxicity and TK, as part of dose setting work to 
support possible future longer duration studies in this species. Oral dosing for up to 14 days at 400 
mg/kg/day was not tolerated, with 1 animal killed prematurely on Day 11 following deterioration in its 
clinical condition. Whilst the cause of death for this animal was not established an association with 
treatment could not be discounted. Haematology changes, affecting reticulocytes, red blood cell 
parameters and leucocyte counts, were seen at 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure in this study 
was markedly lower on Day 14, compared to Day 1.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The principle for olaparib mode of action is synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality is observed when defects 
in two genes individually have benign effects but when combined lead to lethality. For olaparib, the 
hypothesis is that inhibition of the PARP repair system (DNA single strand breaks repair)  in Homologous 
recombination repair (HRR) deficient cells (i.e. BRCA 1 or 2 mutated) will lead to accumulation of 
unrepaired DSBs (or reparation by error prone system Non Homologous End-Joining = NHEJ pathway), 
unsustainable DNA damage burden and cell death. 
In vitro results showed that Olaparib is a PARP-1/PARP-2/PARP-3 inhibitor. All three proteins were 
involved (although in different extent) in DNA repair response (Beck C et al, 2014).  
Olaparib was shown to inhibit selected cell lines in vitro and, with a very good sensitivity, cell lines with 
BRCA mutant and low BRCA expression. An analysis of a panel of cancer cell lines treated with olaparib 
showed an enrichment of the most sensitive lines with those containing BRCA homozygous mutations, 
although activity was not limited to BRCA deficiencies, but also correlated with other DNA repair defects.  
PARP inhibition with olaparib in term of clonogenic survival curves was selective for BRCA2 deficient 
(BRCA2-/-) at adequate doses and not for BRCA2 wild type and BRCA2 heterozygous (BRCA2+/-). 
Therefore, olaparib is expected to have significantly reduced effects on normal cells that are wild type or 
heterozygous for either BRCA1 or BRCA2.  
Olaparib inhibited selected xenograft growth in vivo either as a stand-alone treatment (50 mg/kg ip per 
day) or in combination with established chemotherapies. 
In vivo, BRCA1 and BRCA2-deficient models have also been able to confirm the single agent activity of 
olaparib with efficacious doses of 50 mg/kg qd and above.  
An analysis of olaparib and platinum response was extended to additional tumour indications. A strong 
correlation was identified between platinum sensitivity and olaparib sensitivity in breast, HNSCC and 
NSCLC cancer cell. 
Olaparib showed no significant activity in vitro in a panel of 239 radioligand binding and enzyme assays, 
covering a diverse panel of molecular targets including enzymes, receptors, transporters and ion 
channels, at a single concentration of 10 μM. Olaparib was also inactive in a panel of human recombinant 
voltage-gated cardiac ion channels in vitro at up to a maximum concentration of 31.6 μM. Overall, 
olaparib showed little potential for inducing significant off-target activity at clinically relevant 
concentrations (the human mean free Cmax at the clinical dose of 400 mg bd = 1.99 μM). 
Regarding safety pharmacology, olaparib had an IC50 of 226 μM in the hERG-encoded potassium 
channel, 113-fold higher than the human mean free Cmax (0,865 µg/ml = 1.99 μM) at the clinical dose.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 43/187 
 
  
  
In the dog study (2229/053), there was no evidence for QT prolongation following IV dosing up to 15 
mg/kg at clinically relevant exposures.  At doses of 1.5 and 5 mg/kg olaparib had no effects on the 
cardiovascular of anaesthetised dogs when compared to the vehicle control group. However, a dose of 15 
mg/kg elicited a slight increase in heart rate. Moreover, a decrease was observed in the PR interval at 10 
minutes after administration of the high dose. Data from the 5-min timepoint in Study 2229/045, which 
was comparable to the data collected in the study 0088/453 (KMD008) showed that a 2.5 mg/kg 
intravenous dose to dogs in Study 2229/045 was associated with plasma exposures that were 
approximately 3-fold higher than those achieved at the 1 mg/kg dose in Study 0088/453, suggesting 
linearity.  Moreover, these were approximately 2-fold above the revised mean total Cmax at the 400 mg 
BD clinical dose of 4690 ng/ml (range = 1180 to 14200 ng/ml). This entails that at the high dose level (15 
mg/kg) tested in the intravenous cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in the anaesthetised dog 
(Study 2229/053), by linear extrapolation the 5-min C-max could amount to 25038 ng/mL which is 
1.7-fold above the highest clinical exposure level measured following a clinical dose of 400 mg BD.  As the 
Cmax levels measured immediately after dosing in Study 2229/045 were at least two fold higher it can be 
concluded that the non-clinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology in the anaesthetised dog did not 
demonstrate QT prolongation at plasma exposure levels at least 3-fold higher than human clinical 
exposure following a clinical dose of 400 mg BD. 
Overall, the cardiovascular studies suggested no or a very little potential for QT prolongation in man. No 
effect was observed for the CNS and the respiratory system. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not submitted as olaparib will not be co-administered 
with other agents in the maintenance setting in gBRCA ovarian cancer patients. This was considered 
acceptable by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption was rapid (Cmax <2 hour in mice, rats and dogs) while bioavailability was 55 to 60% in male 
and female mice, <20% in male and female rats and 79% in male dogs. For male and female mice, 
exposure was generally similar in each sex. Exposure increased less than in proportion to dose in both 
sexes but more obviously in male mice. In male and female mice exposure was markedly lower at all dose 
levels after 14 daily oral doses. In rats, exposure was markedly higher in female animals (up to 5-fold the 
exposure in male rat) and exposure increased more than in proportion to dose in both sexes. The sex 
difference exposure between male and female rats was consistent with the frequently observed sexual 
dimorphism in rodent cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzyme expression. Following daily dosing for 1 and 
6 months to rats of both sexes, exposure was largely unchanged at low doses but decreased by 25 to 45% 
at high doses. In male and female dogs, exposure was similar. Exposure increased in proportion to dose 
between the low and mid doses but less than proportionately between the mid and high dose in male dogs 
and proportionately in female dogs. In male and female dogs exposure was similar after single doses and 
daily dosing for 1 and 6 months. 
The excipient Lauroyl Macrogol-32 Glycerides (LMG) present in the capsule formulation was absent from 
the product tested in the non-clinical program.  Olaparib is mainly metabolized via CYP3A4/5. No clinical 
data is available yet concerning CYP inhibition/induction by LMG and the ongoing studies are being 
performed with the tablet formulation only. Adequate warnings are included in the SmPC recommending 
avoiding concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section on clinical pharmacokinetics). 
However, the situation concerning the excipient needs to be clarified and the CHMP recommends the 
Applicant to conduct an in vitro test assessing the potential CYP3A4 inhibition by LMG.

Olaparib demonstrated low binding to plasma proteins. Binding was lowest in dog (38 to 45% unbound), 
followed by mouse (28.4 to 30.6% unbound), rat (26.5 to 27.3% unbound) and human (8.8 to 18.1% 
unbound). Mean free fraction was 28.4%-30.6 in mouse and 26.5%-27.3% in rat. In dog plasma the free 
fraction (38.1%-45.3%) was higher than in mouse or rat. In human plasma, mean free fraction was low 
and varied between 8.8% at concentrations of 0.010 µg/ml and 18.1% at 10.0 µg/ml.  
[14C]-olaparib had a lower association with human blood cells and the interaction was again concentration 
related  (12%  at  0.1  µg/ml  and  30%  at  10  µg/ml).  Following  single  oral  doses  of  [14C]-olaparib  to 
pigmented rats, radioactivity was widely distributed. With the exception of organs of the gastrointestinal 
(GI) tract and excretory organs, concentrations of radioactivity in many tissues were similar to whole 
blood;  this  was  consistent  with  the  low  volume  of  distribution  of  olaparib.  Radioactivity  was  not 
quantifiable in brain or spinal cord. A slightly prolonged association was noted with melanin containing 
tissues (uveal tract and pigmented skin) but this was of short duration. Generally, the tissues containing 
the highest concentrations of Olaparib included the liver, kidney and uveal tract. Distribution in male and 
female rats was similar but tissue concentrations were generally higher in females, which was consistent 
with the higher exposure noted previously. 
Single  oral  doses  of  [14C]-olaparib  to  female  nude  mice  bearing  HTC-116  human  colorectal  tumours 
produced a similar distribution of radioactivity to that in rat. However, radioactivity was present in tumour 
at higher concentrations than blood and was retained in tumour longer than in blood. 
In  rat  and  human,  the  metabolites  formed  heavily  favoured  Phase  I  products;  the  main  sites  of 
metabolism were the piperazine carboxycyclopropyl ring structure and to a lesser extent the fluorophenyl 
and the phathalazinone ring systems. The major metabolic processes were oxidations and hydroxylations 
and many products were the result of multiple metabolic transformations. Some minor products resulted 
from Phase II metabolism of previously formed Phase I products. Following a single 100 mg oral dose of 
[14C]-olaparib to female patients, olaparib and 3 additional components were quantifiable in plasma. The 
3 metabolites were M12 (ring-open hydroxy-cyclopropyl: 12.3%), M15 (monooxygenated: 9.4%) and 
M18 (dehydrogenated piperazine: 7.9%). Olaparib represented 70% and the additional components 9 - 
14% of the plasma radioactivity. Each was also present in male and female rat plasma, following single 
oral doses. However, although these metabolites represented 8 to 12% of the radioactivity in plasma 
from male rats, they were insufficiently abundant to be quantified in female rat plasma. Up to 20 other 
metabolites were present in human plasma although none could be quantified by radio-HPLC; 14 of these 
were not detected in rat or dog plasma although 13 were present in rat excreta. 
In humans and rats, many metabolites were present in very low quantities and were detectable by mass 
spectrometry but not quantifiable. Three metabolites were detected in human but not detected in rat 
plasma or excreta: M35 but also M10 (very low levels and in less than half of the analyzed samples) and 
M8 (0.5% of radioactivity in urine). Taking into account the low concentrations of these 3 metabolites, it 
is considered very unlikely that these would play a major role in the toxicity profile. The rats have thus 
been exposed to all main human metabolites in relevant amounts. 
Following administration of single oral doses of [14C]-olaparib to male and female rats, elimination was 
rapid (94% to 96% within 48h) and recovery was complete within 5 days. Faeces provided the major 
route of elimination of radioactivity in rats of both sex although a greater proportion of the dose was 
eliminated in the faeces of male rats. A corresponding sex difference in urinary elimination was observed 
with female rats eliminating a larger proportion of the dosed radioactivity by this route. Following single 
IV doses of [14C]-olaparib to bile duct cannulated male and female rats, the sex difference in elimination 
route was confirmed with male rats eliminating a much greater proportion of the dose in the bile. These 
findings were consistent with the sex difference in metabolism of olaparib in rat. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 45/187 
  
  
After single oral and IV doses of [14C]-olaparib to male dogs, elimination was again rapid (91% and 99% 
within  48  hours  after  oral  and  IV  dosing)  and  recovery  complete  within  7  days.  Faecal  elimination 
provided the major route of elimination. 
The main metabolite in human urine (M15) resulted from a single oxidation while the most abundant 
metabolites in human faeces (M12, M15, M23 and M25) resulted from single or dual 
oxidations/hydroxylations. 
Toxicology 
In mice, the acute minimum lethal oral dose was not established, as there were no deaths or adverse 
signs at 300 mg/kg. In rats, the acute minimum lethal oral dose of olaparib was 300 mg/kg, with some 
animals found dead on Days 1 to 3. The highest non-lethal oral dose in rats was 240 mg/kg. The acute 
minimum lethal intravenous dose of olaparib in mice and rats was 100 mg/kg, with animals dosed at 100 
mg/kg and above dying immediately following dosing. The highest non-lethal IV dose in mice and rats 
was 70 mg/kg. 
In repeat dose oral toxicity studies in rats, dosing olaparib for 7 days at dose levels of up to 200 
mg/kg/day, for 1 month at up to 40 mg/kg/day and for 6 months at up to 15 mg/kg/day (females) or 30 
mg/kg/day (males) was well tolerated, with no compound-related deaths nor reduced body weight. 
Reduced body weight gain, food consumption and effects on haematology parameters were observed at 
40 mg/kg/d and higher. Reductions in body weight, body weight gain and/or food consumption were 
noted in these studies for females dosed at 15 mg/kg/day and above and for males at 40 mg/kg/day and 
above. The different high dose levels of 15 mg/kg/day (females) or 30 mg/kg/day (males) were selected 
for the 6 month rat study because of the higher plasma exposures in females compared to males.  
In dogs, oral dosing for 3 or 7 days at 50 or 75 mg/kg/day resulted in body weight loss, inappetence and 
adverse signs, and as a result 1 dog dosed at 50 mg/kg/day was killed prematurely on Day 5. Lower dose 
levels of up to 15 mg/kg/day and up to 10 mg/kg/day were subsequently selected for the 1 and 6 month 
repeat dose dog studies, respectively, and were well tolerated, with no mortalities, nor effects on body 
weight or food consumption. Haematological changes were observed including decrease in red blood cell 
parameters, white blood cell, platelet and reticulocyte counts.  
In both species, the principal target organ for toxicity following repeat dosing of olaparib for up to 1 or 6 
months was the bone marrow, with associated changes in peripheral haematology parameters.  
In rats, reductions in red blood cell parameters and white blood cell, neutrophil and/or lymphocyte 
counts, and increases and/or decreases in reticulocyte and platelet counts, were seen in one or both sexes 
dosed at 100 or 200 mg/kg/day for 7 days, at 40 mg/kg/day for 1 month or at 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg/day for 
6 months. These changes were associated with increases in the erythropoietic and/or myelopoietic cell 
populations within the bone marrow, and with increases in splenic haemopoiesis, hepatocyte 
pigmentation and/or thymic atrophy. 
The changes generally occurred at lower dose levels in female rats as a result of the higher systemic 
exposures in this sex, compared to males. Similar changes in red blood cell parameters and white blood 
cell, neutrophil lymphocyte, reticulocyte and/or and platelet counts, were seen following dosing dogs at 
50 mg/kg/day for 7 days or 15 mg/kg/day for 1 month, and were associated with bone marrow atrophy 
and with an increase in the myeloid/erythroid (M:E) ratio in the bone marrow smear. Decreases in red and 
white blood cells and platelets, seen following dosing dogs at 3 or 10 mg/kg/day for 6 months, were not 
associated with any microscopic changes in the bone marrow. All changes seen in rats and dogs in the 1 
month studies showed full or partial recovery following a 28 day recovery period.

It was noted that the mean total steady state AUC(0-12) in humans at the 400 mg bd clinical dose was 
approximately 5-fold higher than the mean steady state AUC(0-24) at the highest doses used in the dog 1 
month (15 mg/kg/day) and 6 month (10 mg/kg/day) studies, respectively. Animals in the pivotal 
6-month dog study were under-exposed compared to Human by a factor 3, whereas MTD (defined as a 
decrease in body weight gain of no more than 10%) was not reached. Given the limitations of the 
non-clinical general toxicology data, the limited amount of long-term exposure data for olaparib, the 
potential for long term toxicity on organ systems is unknown from a clinical perspective.  Published clinical 
data on other PARP inhibitors to date has identified no additional toxicity concerns of importance. 
However, PARP inhibitors are a relatively new class of agents with limited published clinical information. 
Therefore, long-term exposure to/potential toxicity to olaparib have been included as missing information 
in the RMP and the MAH will assess the potential for any additional target organ toxicity following 
long-term dosing through pharmacovigilance activities. 
Olaparib showed no mutagenic potential in the Ames bacterial mutation tests, but was clastogenic in an 
in vitro chromosome aberration test in mammalian cells and induced micronuclei in the bone marrow of 
rats following oral dosing for 2 days at dose levels of up to 400 mg/kg/day. This clastogenicity was 
consistent with the primary pharmacology of olaparib and indicated potential for genotoxicity in man (see 
SmPC section 5.3). No carcinogenicity studies were provided which is acceptable according to ICH S9 and 
in line with the protocol assistance received. Possible occurrence of new malignancies due to the 
pharmacological action of olaparib will be closely monitored in line with the RMP (see clinical safety). 
In a female fertility and early embryonic development study, dosing olaparib to female rats from 14 days 
prior to pairing and continuing up to Day 6 post-coitum inclusive, produced no significant maternal 
toxicity or effects on mating performance or fertility (ovulation and pregnancy rates), but resulted in 
slight reduced embryofetal survival at the high dose of 15 mg/kg/day. Main test animals dosed with 15 
mg/kg/day had markedly increased incidence of extended oestrus during dosing (9 affected animals 
versus 0 affected controls). This effect was no longer present after recovery. A recovery group was 
included in the study, with dosing for 19 days followed by a 4 week recovery period before pairing, and 
showed no decrement in embryofetal survival for animals previously dosed with olaparib at 15 
mg/kg/day. In embryofoetal development studies, oral dosing of olaparib to pregnant rats during 
organogenesis caused complete embryofetal lethality at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day and above. At lower doses 
(e.g., 0.05 or 0.5 mg/kg/day), reduced foetal weight and increased incidences of major foetal 
developmental abnormalities (including visceral and skeletal abnormalities, and major eye (e.g. 
anophthalmia, micropthalmia) and vertebral/rib malformations) were seen. Overall, these data provide 
compelling evidence that olaparib can cause developmental toxicity at doses levels that did not induce 
significant maternal toxicity. Plasma exposures at the LOEL for teratogenicity were about 4500-fold lower 
than plasma exposures obtained in humans at the recommended dose of 400 mg b.i.d. 
Assessment of placental transfer and distribution into milk has not been undertaken. It is unknown 
whether olaparib/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Olaparib is contraindicated during 
breast-feeding (see SmPC sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3).  
In a male fertility study, dosing olaparib to male rats for at least 70 consecutive days prior to pairing with 
undosed females and until fertility was proven, produced no effects on mating performance, fertility, 
embryonic survival, sperm parameters or on testis and epididymal weights or histopathology, at doses of 
up to 40 mg/kg/day, although doses of 15 mg/kg/day and above were associated with signs of toxicity, 
notably reduced food consumptions and body weight gain.  
Olaparib showed absorption in the UV visible spectrum and had a MEC of 5926 L.mol-1.cm-1 at 290 nm.  
In addition, olaparib distributed to the skin and eyes.    
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 47/187 
  
  
Olaparib was myelotoxic when assessed in ex vivo bone marrow proliferation and/or colony-forming unit 
granulocyte/macrophage assays, using human donor and rat bone marrow cells. This confirmed that 
olaparib is cytotoxic to human bone marrow cells (see SmPC section 5.3).  
The Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) / Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) ratios for 
ground water, surface water and sediment were below 1, and the PEC/PNEC for microorganisms was 
below 0.1. Olaparib is not predicted to present a significant risk to the environment. Any unused medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements (see SmPC section 
6.6). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Olaparib is a potent inhibitor of human poly (ADP ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2, and 
PARP-3), and has been shown to inhibit the growth of selected tumour cell lines in vitro and tumour 
growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies.  
In BRCA deficient in vivo models, olaparib given after platinum treatment resulted in a delay in tumour 
progression and an increase in overall survival compared to platinum treatment alone. 
In repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 6 months duration in rats and dogs, daily oral doses of olaparib 
were well tolerated. The major primary target organ for toxicity in both species was the bone marrow, 
with associated changes in peripheral haematology parameters. These findings occurred at exposures 
below those seen clinically and were largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing. Ex vivo 
studies using human bone marrow cells also confirmed that olaparib is cytotoxic to human bone marrow 
cells. 
Based on its mechanism of action (PARP inhibition), olaparib could cause foetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant woman. Non-clinical studies in rats have shown that olaparib causes adverse effects on 
embryofoetal survival and induces major foetal malformations at exposures below those expected at the 
recommended human dose of 400 mg twice daily (see discussion above). Therefore, olaparib should not 
be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using reliable contraception during 
therapy and for 1 month after receiving the last dose of olaparib (see SmPC sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3). 
Given the pharmacologic property of the product, olaparib is also contraindicated during breast feeding 
and for 1 month after receiving the last dose. 
Regarding the potential for any additional target organ toxicity following long-term dosing, the applicant 
will provide further information through pharmacovigilance activities as adequately reflected in the RMP. 
The CHMP also recommends the applicant to conduct an in vitro test assessing the potential CYP3A4 
inhibition by LMG. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Olaparib capsules have been designed as an immediate release oral formulation, containing 50 mg of 
olaparib. The capsules consist of olaparib drug substance suspended in the semisolid excipient lauroyl 
macrogol-32 glycerides (LMG) within a white, opaque, hypromellose capsule shell. The same olaparib 
capsule formulation has been used in all Phase I and II studies included in the dossier and this is also the 
proposed commercial formulation. A tablet formulation of olaparib has been developed to deliver a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 48/187 
  
  
clinically therapeutic dose of olaparib in fewer dose units than that required for the capsule formulation. 
The tablet formulation is being used within the ongoing studies of olaparib. 
The application relates to the capsule formulation of olaparib. Clinical data were provided from eight 
studies including in total 911 subjects with ovarian cancer relevant to the assessment of the efficacy of 
the capsule formulation of olaparib. 
The Applicant received protocol assistance on the design of the clinical study and determination of BRCA 
mutations status in patients. The main points are summarised below: 
- Since subsequent therapies are likely to confound OS data, PFS with clearly defined response criteria, 
independent response assessment and no cross over may be an acceptable endpoint if the effect is 
clinically relevant and robust, data on OS show no detrimental effects and toxicity of the substance is low 
(as reflected by absence of impact on QoL) (see EMA/CHMP/27994/2008 “Methodological consideration 
for using progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS) in confirmatory trials”). 
- More mature PFS data and more mature OS data, and information on time to second progression (PFS2) 
were recommended. 
- Time from randomization to second progression / PFS2 would be of some importance as supportive 
endpoints. 
- In Europe, the testing procedures employed for identification of germline BRCA mutations are 
considered acceptable and are embedded in current clinical practice. It was advised, that for an indication 
that would include tumour BRCA mutated patients, it would be essential to develop a tumour based 
testing infrastructure that would ensure such testing could be utilised to support the identification of 
appropriate patients. This could be delivered through a laboratory based testing infrastructure and/or 
through the delivery of a CE marked tumour test. The Applicant considered that this was feasible and is 
exploring options to make a tumour test available. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In addition to non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies (see Table 6), the clinical pharmacology package for 
the capsule formulation included single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) data, data on 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and a PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) report 
(using PARP inhibition as a PD endpoint). It also included a population PK/PD analysis in 293 ovarian 
cancer patients across 6 clinical studies to describe the influence of covariates including patient age, 
weight and race on the pharmacokinetics of olaparib and to explore the relationship of pharmacokinetics 
to the assessments of efficacy and safety.

In the pharmacokinetics studies, standard non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed. Standard 
pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC, AUC0-t, AUC 0-24, λz, CL/F, Varea/F, t 1/2, t max, amount and 
percentage of dose excreted in urine and CLR) were determined by non-compartmental data analysis.  
In the population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and exposure-response relationship modelling in 
patients performed, NONlinear Mixed Effects Modelling program (NONMEM) software was used.  
Various analytical methods were developed and validated in different matrices: Plasma, urine and tumour 
tissues.  
Absorption  
Non-compartmental  analysis  of  the  plasma  concentration  data  obtained  following  administration  of  a 
single oral dose of olaparib to patients in Study 02 (10 to 600 mg) and Study 24 (50, 100 and 400 mg), 
showed  that  absorption  of  drug  was  rapid  with  maximum  plasma  concentrations  typically  achieved 
between 1 and 3 hours after dosing (range: 0.5 to 8 hours).

Exposure to olaparib showed high interindividual variability, increased approximately proportionally with 
dose up to a dose of 100 mg but less than dose-proportionally thereafter. Similar data were obtained 
following single and multiple dosing to Western patients in Study 24 (single doses of 50, 100 and 400 mg; 
multiple dosing at 400 mg bd) and to Japanese patients (100, 200 and 400 mg) in Study 01.  
In vitro study KMX006 showed that olaparib is a substrate to MDR1 transporter (also known as P-gp). In 
Caco-2 cells, bi-directional transport of olaparib was explored at concentrations of 10, 260 and 700 μM. At 
low concentrations (10 μM) olaparib was shown to have a propensity for efflux by P-glycoprotein (Pgp; 
MDR1) but at concentrations in excess of 260 μM the efflux was saturated (efflux ratio <2). Since the 
solubility of olaparib in human intestinal fluid is 0.16 mg/ml (368 μM), MDR1-mediated efflux would be 
expected to be saturated following dosing with olaparib at the 400 mg dose (dose:volume ratio = 1.6 
mg/ml) and is therefore unlikely to impact on absorption of the drug. 
In clinical study 10 (Mass-balance study) conducted in 6 female patients dosed with 100 mg, the total 
related drug material excreted in the urine was approximately 44%. This showed that at 100 mg dose at 
least a 44% fraction of the drug is absorbed. However, it could be anticipated that the drug fraction 
absorbed at the 400 mg claimed dose would be much lower as absorption appeared to be limited by 
dissolution of the drug. 
The absolute bioavailability of olaparib has not been determined. 
Distribution 
Based on data from Study KPJ019, the in vitro protein binding of olaparib was shown to be moderate and 
showed evidence of concentration dependence (91.1, 91.2, 90.9 and 81.9% at concentrations of 0.01, 
0.1, 1 and 10 μg/ml). It was not determined whether the binding is to human serum albumin, to α1-acid 
glycoprotein or to both and the ex vivo protein binding of olaparib (i.e. binding in samples from patients 
treated with olaparib) was not determined. The pooled population PK analysis of the data from Studies 02, 
08, 09, 12 and 24 gave no indication that baseline albumin level was a significant covariate for either 
olaparib clearance or olaparib initial volume of distribution in man suggesting that changes in protein 
binding of olaparib are unlikely to explain the observed variability in exposure or result in changes in 
exposure. 
Non-compartmental analysis of the single dose pharmacokinetic data following doses of 10, 20, 40 and 80 
mg in Study 02 and doses of 50 and 100 mg in Study 24, indicated distribution out of the central 
compartment with a mean apparent volume of distribution (Varea/F) of 54.4 L . Following dosing of a 400 
mg dose in Study 24 however, the mean apparent volume of distribution (Varea/F) was 167 L, although 
this was highly influenced by the value from one patient. Excluding that patient, the mean apparent 
volume of distribution following the 400 mg dose was 88.0 L (Study 24), suggesting that the 
bioavailability of olaparib may be decreasing as administered dose is increased beyond 100 mg. 
From the revised population PK analysis of the pooled Study 1, 2, 8, 9, 12 and 24 data, the mean estimate 
for the central volume of distribution (V2) was 3.75 L and the mean peripheral volume (V3) was 60.3 L, 
indicating a volume of distribution at steady state for the whole population of approximately 64 L.  
Estimates of the inter-patient variability indicated coefficients of variation of greater than 90%.  Volume 
of distribution was found to increase with increasing dose with the volume of distribution following the 400 
mg dose estimated to be ~177 L.

Determination of concentrations of olaparib in tumour biopsies collected from intermediate and high risk 
breast cancer patients scheduled for elective surgery (Study 07) showed that measurable concentrations 
(>40 ng/g) were present in all but one of the samples collected from patients dosed at 30, 100, 200 and 
400 mg bd confirming that tumour exposure to drug had been achieved. In the patients dosed at 400 mg 
bd, tumour concentrations ranged from 63.4 to 1830 ng/g (146 to 4217 nM (assuming the density of the 
tissue = 1.0 to convert the concentration from ng/g to ng/ml) with all of the patients dosed achieving 
tumour concentrations above 100 nM (i.e. at concentration shown to result in maximal inhibition of 
PARP-1 in in vitro experiments conducted in SW620 cell cultures).  
Elimination 
Identification of elimination pathways in human was primarily supported by the mass-balance study 
conducted in 6 female patients (Study 10). In vitro studies were also performed in order to identify the 
metabolism routes. From these investigations, it appeared that olaparib is slowly eliminated mainly by 
metabolism but also by renal route. The excretion of unchanged drug in urine was approximately 15 % of 
the total dose administered. 
At doses up to 100 mg, mean apparent plasma clearance was 5.12 ± 2.23 SD L/h and the mean terminal 
half-life (t½) was 7.05 hours. At a dose of 400 mg however, mean apparent clearance was 8.64 ± 7.11 
SD L/h and mean terminal half-life was 11.9 hours. 
Metabolism 
Data regarding metabolism routes of olaparib were collected from in vitro and clinical studies (mainly 
mass-balance study Study 10).  
• 
In-vitro investigations 
Information regarding metabolism pathways could be obtained mainly from studies KMX039 and KMX009 
conducted respectively in human hepatocytes and human liver microsomes. In these studies numerous 
metabolites (11 different compounds) have been formed and identified. Although low metabolic turnover 
was observed the principal metabolites formed corresponded to those previously seen in incubations with 
human liver microsomes and CYP3A4 supersomes (KMX009). The formation of the principal metabolites 
was mediated by CYP enzymes. Olaparib is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4/5. 
•  Mass-balance study (Study 10) 
Study 10 was a phase I, open, non-randomised, single-centre mass balance study where each patient 
received a single oral 100 mg dose of [14C]-olaparib (120 μCi; 4.44 MBq), composed of one 50 mg 
[14C]-olaparib capsule and one 50 mg non-radiolabelled olaparib capsule. Once excreta levels fell below 
the level of detection for radioactivity, patients who were free from intolerable toxicity and, in the 
investigator’s opinion were eligible to continue treatment, received twice-daily (bd) dosing with 100 mg 
(2 x 50 mg capsules) non-radiolabelled oral olaparib capsules. 
After administration of a single, oral 100 mg [14C]-olaparib dose, absorption of olaparib was rapid with 
maximum plasma concentrations achieved at 1.5 to 2 hours after dosing. Thereafter plasma 
concentrations fell rapidly and had fallen below the limit of sensitivity of the assay by 16 to 24 hours after 
dosing in all but one patient where concentrations were still measurable at 168 hours after dosing. The 
geometric mean Cmax and AUC for olaparib were respectively 3.56 μg/ml and 19.9 μg.h/ml. Plasma 
radioactivity concentrations were generally higher than those of unchanged drug and declined in parallel. 
Olaparib represented, on average, 60% of the circulating radioactivity. The plasma: blood ratio for 
radioactivity suggested a small degree of association of drug related material with red blood cells. Over 
the 7 day collection period, a total of 85.8% of the dosed material was recovered in the excreta with 
approximately 44% recovered in the urine and 42% in the faeces. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 55/187 
  
  
Metabolite profiling (KMX032) by HPLC-RAD and HPLC-MSn of 0-12 hour pooled plasma showed that 
unchanged olaparib was the main component present accounting for an average of 70% of the 
chromatogram radioactivity (range = 56.2 to 83.9%). Three metabolites were detected by HPLC-RAD, 
M12, M15 and M18, each accounting on average for approximately 10% of the chromatogram 
radioactivity (9.3, 10.3 and 13.7% respectively). A further 20 components were detectable only by 
HPLC-MSn. The three major metabolites were identified as a ring-opened hydroxy-cyclopropyl moiety 
(M12), a mono-oxygenated metabolite (M15) and a dehydrogenated piperazine (M18), the latter being 
derived during MS analysis from M39 (a mono-oxygenated moiety). 
The major component present in human urine, accounting for a mean of 15% (range = 10 to 19% of the 
radiochemical dose, was unchanged olaparib. A total of 37 metabolites were observed in human urine. 
Eighteen were quantifiable by HPLC-RAD with M15 accounting for approximately 6% of the dose and the 
remaining components individually representing <2.34%. The remaining metabolites were detectable 
only by HPLC-MSn. 
At least 20 components were observed in the pooled faecal samples with 6 components accounting for 
>1% of the dose and the remaining metabolites detectable only by HPLC-MSn. The major component for 
3 of the 6 patients was unchanged olaparib, accounting for approximately 7, 9 and 14% of the dose; M15 
was the major component present in the samples from the other 3 patients (0.9, 8.4 and 1.2% of the 
dose). 
In summary, unchanged olaparib was the major component present in majority of the samples analysed 
(plasma, urine and faeces). All but 5 of the metabolites detected in human samples, (each representing 
<1% of the dosed material) were also shown to be present in samples from the rat. All the metabolites 
detected by HPLC-RAD in human plasma were produced by male rats with the percentage of the 
radiochromatogram accounted for by each of those peaks being similar for the two species (9.3, 10.3 and 
13.7% in man; 12.3, 9.4 and 7.9% in rat for M12, M15 and M18 respectively). The major components 
present in human excreta were unchanged olaparib and M15 (15 and 6% of the urinary radioactivity 
respectively; 0.6 to 14% and 5% of the faecal radioactivity respectively). The main site of metabolism of 
olaparib was the piperazine carboxycyclopropyl moiety although both the fluorophenyl and 
phathalazinone ring systems were also subject to metabolism, albeit to a lesser extent. The majority of 
the metabolism could be attributed to oxidation reactions with a number of components subsequently 
undergoing glucuronide or sulphate conjugation. 
Excretion 
In the human mass balance study (Study 10), excreta were collected from female cancer patients for 7 
days after administration of a single radiolabelled olaparib dose. Over this period the mean total amount 
of dosed radioactivity recovered was 85.8% ± 7.4 SE with 44.1% excreted in the urine and 41.8% in the 
faeces. Total recovery of drug-related material from 4 of the patients was good (>90%) but was 
comparatively low in the remaining two (61% and 65%). In these two patients very little or no faecal 
material was produced over the 72 to 96 hour period following dosing and faecal excretion of radioactivity 
appeared to be delayed with little drug related material recovered in the faeces in the first 4 days after 
dosing and material still being excreted at up to 21 days after dosing. The rate and extent of recovery of 
material via the urinary route in these two patients however, was similar to that in the other 4 patients 
suggesting that their slower faecal excretion may be a consequence of slow gastrointestinal tract transit. 
Approximately 15% of the dose was excreted as unchanged olaparib in the urine. Renal clearance was 
slightly higher than the rate of renal filtration implying there may be a small degree of active secretion (or 
a combination of active secretion followed by reabsorption) involved in the renal elimination of olaparib. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 56/187 
  
  
Information regarding dose proportionality of Cmax and AUC of the capsules could be obtained from the 
data of dose escalation studies (Study 01 and Study 02) after single and repeated oral doses of olaparib 
varying from 10 mg up to 600 mg. Additional data, using sparse sampling and a population analysis based 
approach, were obtained following multiple dosing of patients in the efficacy expansion cohort of Study 02 
(200 mg bd) and from patients in Studies 8, 9, 12 and 24 (100, 200 and/or 400 mg bd). 
•  Single dose  
Exposure increased approximately proportionally with dose between the 50 and 100 mg doses but less 
than proportionally thereafter. The average terminal half-life at the lower doses was approximately 8 
hours (range: 5.19 to 11.3 hours). Following the 400 mg dose however, the plasma concentration time 
profiles appeared flatter perhaps reflecting prolonged absorption, and the average terminal half-life in 
this cohort was 11.9 hours (range: 7.15 to 17.8 hours). Mean apparent clearance and mean apparent 
volume of distribution also appeared to be greater at the 400 mg dose level than at the two lower doses 
perhaps indicating a reduction in bioavailability at this higher dose. 
The data from Study 02 showed that whilst exposure to olaparib (Cmax and AUC0-10) increased 
approximately proportionally with dose up to 100 mg it increased less than dose proportionally thereafter. 
For a 4-fold increase in dose from 100 mg to 400 mg, geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-12 increased only 
1.8 and 1.7-fold respectively. 
•  Multiple dose 
Following twice daily dosing at 60, 100, 200, 400 and 600 mg, at doses less than 100 mg, average 
exposure appeared to increase proportionally with dose but less than proportionally as the dose was 
increased further (mean C max and AUC0-12 increased only 2.1 and 2.2–fold for a 4-fold increase in dose 
(100 to 400 mg bd)). 
Time dependencies 
Based on its single dose half-life, it would be expected that steady state exposure would be achieved 
within 3 to 4 days after commencing dosing with olaparib. In study 2, comparison of the Day 14 AUC 0-24 
with the Day 1 AUC for the patients, showed that for 8 of the 12 patients where the comparison was 
possible, the Day 14 AUC0-24 was within 30% of the Day 1 AUC value, suggesting there was no marked 
time dependency in the pharmacokinetics of olaparib.  
PK data were collected beyond the end of the first month of dosing of olaparib to patients in the Group 6 
patients in Study D0810C00024. PK sampling was performed on Day 1, 29 and 57 of dosing. There was 
no consistent pattern that suggested exposure to olaparib is changing on continued dosing beyond Day 29 
with 7 of the 14 patients for whom a ratio could be calculated showing a <20% change, one showing an 
approximately 25% decrease in exposure and 6 showing a increase in exposure of approximately 30% or 
greater, changes which could just be a consequence of intra-occasion variability.  
Population PK analysis 
Two pooled population clinical pharmacology analyses have been carried out using the data from a 
number of studies conducted during the development programme.  
In the first study (analysis of pooled data from studies 02 and 07), a structural (bi-compartment) PK 
model was defined and the systemic exposure in patients with sparse data was predicted by the model. 
The PK-PD relationship was investigated. In this investigation the PARP-1 activity was used as a 
biomarker of the drug effectiveness.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 57/187 
  
  
A linear, two-compartment model with consecutive zero- and first-order absorption and first order 
elimination from the central compartment was used to describe the plasma concentrations of olaparib. 
Using this model the population apparent clearance, volume of distribution, duration of the zero-order 
absorption, absorption rate constant and lag time of olaparib were found to be 7.28 L/h, 34.6 L, 0.655 
(~39 min), 0.502 h-1, and 0.182 h (11 min) respectively. The population relative bioavailability in 
patients in study KU36-13 was found to be 75% lower than in study KU36-92. This difference may be 
explained by the different formulation batches with different solubility properties used between the two 
studies. The population used in the pooled analysis was a mixed of different type of cancer patients with 
different disease status (early and advanced disease) which could also explain this difference of 
bioavailability between the two studies and patients. 
The inter-individual variability on PK parameters was moderate to large from 49% to 61%. The inclusion 
Inter-occasion variability (IOV) was found to improve the modelling especially for the Vss. This variability 
on Vss was moderate to large with a CV of 61%. The covariates influencing the PK characteristics of 
olaparib were the BMI, Age and dose on clearance and dose on F1: 
The clearance increases when the BMI decreases. Patients with a low BMI value (18 kg/m2) taking a 100 
mg dose of olaparib, would have a (CL/F) 65 % higher than the typical patient. The clearance decreases 
proportionally when the age decreases. A patient aged 70 years would have a plasma clearance about 
18% lower than the typical patient. The bioavailability decreases when the dose increases. F1 decreases 
not more than 32%, when the treatment dose increases from 100 to 400 mg. 
None of the covariates were shown to have a statistically significant impact on the absorption parameters 
and on the distribution. 
Analysis of the pharmacodynamic data indicated plasma exposure correlated with PBMC PARP-1 inhibition 
and suggested that maximum inhibition could be achieved with high plasma exposure. However, this 
relationship could not be extended to dose, since the reducing bioavailability seemed to significantly 
increase the variability in olaparib plasma exposure observed at higher doses (doses > 100 mg). 
In the second study (analysis of data from studies 01, 02, 08, 09, 12 and 24), the above mentioned model 
was refined and used in order to predict the systemic exposure in patients included in this study. The 
PK-efficacy and PK-side effect correlations have been investigated based on these predictions. The same 
model than that described and commented above (pooled data from studies 02 and 07) was used. 
Table 18: Final PK parameters estimated with FO, SAEM and MCMC 
In conclusion the PK of olaparib was described by a two-compartment system with both zero and first 
order absorption:

• The non-linearity of PK of olaparib was described in F varying with the administered dose. The 
bioavailability was found to be altered by the dissolution performance of the batch of capsules dosed. For 
the 400 mg dose the population bioavailability was equal to 0.27 for fast release profile dissolution 
batches. 
• Estimation of PK parameters as CL/F and V/F are similar to those derived with NCA analysis in study 24. 
• No clinical impact of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of olaparib. 
Using individual estimates of steady state exposure (steady state AUC, Cmax and Cmin), together with 
baseline characteristics and the administrated dose three markers of response (CA125, tumour response, 
tumour size change) were investigated. Dose (log-transformed) was the only significant factor for CA125 
response and tumour size change, whereas log dose together with study as a categorical factor were 
important predictors for tumour response in the present pooled analysis. Results of the analysis 
suggested that 400 mg was more effective than 100 or 200 mg with respect to all these parameter 
changes. Analysis of CA125 suggested a 56% probability of response for 400 mg compared to 31% for 
200 mg, while the predicted proportion of patients with partial or complete response was 35 % for 400 mg 
and 28 % for 200 mg. A 32% reduction of tumour size is predicted for the 400 mg dose after 200 days of 
treatment compared to 17% and 3% for the 200 and 100mg doses. 
Special populations 
Age 
The effect of patient age was assessed on the absorption parameters, the apparent clearance and the 
apparent volume of distribution of olaparib were assessed as part of the covariate analysis performed in the 
revised population analysis of the pooled data from Studies 01, 02, 08, 09, 12 and 24. Age was not found 
to be a statistically significant covariate that warranted inclusion in the final PK model. The median values 
and the spread of the data indicated similarity between the two groups suggesting no impact of age on 
olaparib pharmacokinetics. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Influence of food (Study D081AC00001) 
This was a 2-part, Phase I, multicentre study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A was a 
randomised, open-label, 3-period crossover study to determine the effect of food on the PK profile of 
olaparib. Each patient received a single 400 mg oral dose of olaparib (given as eight 50 mg capsules) in 
each of the 3 treatment periods (once in the overnight fasted state, once immediately following a high-fat 
meal and once immediately following a standard meal), with a washout period of at least 5 and no more 
than 14 days between doses. Food intake was instructed as follows: Patients fasted for at least 10 hours 
after which they were given the recommended meal. Patients should have eaten the meal within 30 
minutes (in the event the patient was unable to eat the meal in 30 minutes, they were still considered 
evaluable as long as they had consumed at least 75% of it within 45 minutes). The olaparib was 
administered 30 minutes after the start of the meal (or a maximum of 45 minutes after the start of the 
meal, if the meal was not completed), after which patients fasted until 4 hours post dose. Water was 
allowed as desired except for 1hour before and after olaparib capsule administration. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 59/187 
  
  
The results of this study showed that whilst the consumption of both the meals altered the 
pharmacokinetics of olaparib, the effect was not as marked as had been predicted from in vitro and in 
silico modeling. Following the high fat meal, the rate of absorption was slowed (median t max delayed by 
~3 hours), Cmax was unchanged (TR = 1.00; 90% CI: 0.92-1.09) and AUC was increased by ~20% (TR = 
1.19; 90% CI: 1.08-1.31). Similarly following the standard meal, the rate of absorption was slowed 
(median t max delayed by ~2 hours), Cmax increased slightly (TR = 1.10; 90% CI: 1.02-1.20) and AUC was 
increased by ~20% (TR = 1.21; 90% CI: 1.10-1.33). Although the average magnitude of effect was not 
large there was clearly a statistically significant effect of food and examination of the data for individual 
patients in the study showed that approximately 10% of patients had a 70% or greater increase in AUC 
in the fed state and approximately 20% had a 50% or greater increase. 
Potential for interactions related to hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
•  Olaparib as a victim drug 
SimCYP population pharmacokinetic simulations of the separate effect of co-administration of 
itraconazole and rifampicin (clinically relevant CYP3A inhibitor and inducer respectively) on olaparib 
pharmacokinetics in humans, when administered at the recommended human dose, were performed. The 
itraconazole (200 mg bd x 7 days) simulation indicated olaparib (400 mg bd x 7 days) Cmax and 
AUC(156-168 hours) would increase by 2.8 and 3.5-fold respectively. The rifampicin simulation (600 mg 
x 6 days) indicated olaparib (400 mg bd x 6 days) Cmax and AUC(132-144 hours) in the presence of 
rifampicin would be reduced to 33% and 29% respectively of the values in the absence of rifampicin. 
•  Olaparib as a perpetrator: inhibitor and inducer 
CYP inhibition 
The direct and time dependant CYP inhibitory potential of olaparib was tested against a panel of enzyme 
activities in study KMX001. Human hepatic microsomal protein was incubated at 37ºC with selective CYP 
substrates in the presence of olaparib at a range of concentrations between 0.1 and 100 μM (0.043 to 
43.4 μg/ml) in order to assess inhibition of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4). The effects of furafylline, 8-methoxypsoralen, ThioTEPA, 
trimethoprim, sulphaphenazole, benzylnirvanol, quinidine, disulfiram and ketoconazole, known potent 
inhibitors of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, respectively, were also examined 
as model inhibitors. For CYP3A4, both testosterone and midazolam were included as substrates. In 
addition, in order to evaluate the time dependent inhibition of the selected CYP isozymes, human hepatic 
microsomal protein was pre-incubated at 37ºC for 15 minutes with olaparib (10 μM) and NADPH, prior to 
addition of the relevant CYP substrate. 
Results showed no direct inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2A6, 2C8, 2E1, 2D6 by olaparib at the higher studied 
concentrations whereas at 100µM a decrease about 46%, 22% and 26% in 3A4, CYP2C9 and 2C19 
activity was observed, respectively. Because inhibition of enzyme activity did not exceed 50% of the 
control value, IC50 was not been calculated by the Applicant. 
A further study to investigate time-dependant inhibition of CYP3A, which used midazolam as substrate 
(more sensitive than testosterone in the previous direct and time dependant inhibition assessment; 
KMX001) generated values of KI = 72.2 μM and Kinact = 0.0675 min-1. Using the approach outlined in 
the EMA guidance, the effect of a time dependant inhibitor on the exposure of a co-administered agent 
was R = 1.011.  
CYP induction 
The objectives of the study KMX002 were to measure the extent of change of specific CYP450 marker 
enzymes (for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) following exposure of human 
hepatocytes to olaparib.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 60/187 
  
  
Fresh human hepatocytes were cultured for 36 hours prior to exposure to olaparib at concentrations of 
0.3, 3 and 30 μM. Cells were also incubated with omeprazole and phenobarbital as prototypical inducers 
of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 and rifampicin as an inducer of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isoforms, 
respectively. After exposure to olaparib and inducers for ca.48 hours, selective substrates for CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4-mediated activities were introduced (namely 7-ethoxyresorufin, 
bupropion, diclofenac, S-mephenytoin and testosterone, respectively) and the effects of olaparib on these 
activities quantified in comparison with those elicited by the prototype inducers. 
There was no evidence of an induction effect on catalytic activities associated with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Small but notable increases in bupropion hydroxylation in hepatocytes treated 
with olaparib at 30 μM indicated that the compound was a weak inducer of CYP2B6-mediated enzyme 
activity in vitro. The magnitude of this effect was, however, small in comparison with that elicited by the 
positive control phenobarbital. Testosterone 6β-hydroxylase activity (CYP3A) showed a concentration 
related decrease in activity, which may suggest olaparib functioned as a time dependent inhibitor of 
CYP3A enzymes in this study. 
Interaction related to efflux transporters: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) 
•  Olaparib as a substrate of P-glycoprotein, BCRP and MRP2 
Two studies were undertaken to investigate whether olaparib was a substrate of efflux human drug 
transport proteins P-gp, BCRP and MRP2 (KMX006 and KMX020).  
In study KMX006, monolayers of MDCKII cells transfected with human MDR1 or human BCRP were used 
to study the directional transport of olaparib. In addition, isolated membranes containing high levels of 
either human MDR1 or human BCRP were used to study direct interaction of olaparib with the transporter 
associated ATPase activity. 
Reference substrates and inhibitors were used to validate the test systems. Olaparib (0.1 to 10 μM) was 
added to either the apical compartment or the basolateral compartment and both a-b and b-a flux 
assessed. In addition, the effect of MDR1 inhibitors verapamil (50 μM) and ketoconazole (25 μM) on 
olaparib flux in this system was investigated. The data showed olaparib b-a flux was greater than a-b; the 
corrected efflux ratio was 6.0 to 7.5 and independent of concentration. Verapamil had no effect on 
olaparib b-a efflux while ketoconazole reduced b-a efflux by 40 to 62%.  Verapamil, a known substrate of 
MDR1, was unable to reduce MDR1-mediated transport of olaparib, suggesting that verapamil and 
olaparib do not bind to the same binding sites on MDR1. The MDCKII-corrected efflux ratio (ER) was 
between 4.1 – 5.9 for olaparib (compared to an ER of 4.85 for the MDR1 reference substrate vinblastine 
sulphate). Together, these data indicated olaparib was an MDR1 substrate. 
A similar investigation to the above, using MDCKII cells transfected with BCRP and Ko143 (5 μM) as 
inhibitor was undertaken. The MDCKII-corrected ER was 0.5 - 1.0 for olaparib (compared to an ER of 3.5 
for the BCRP reference substrate cimetidine). In this system, olaparib b-a flux was only fractionally 
greater than a-b flux (corrected efflux ratio 0.6 to 1.0) indicating olaparib was not a BCRP substrate. 
In additional experiments in study KMX006, membrane vesicles isolated from Sf9 insect cells transfected 
with either MDR1 or BCRP were incubated in the presence of olaparib (0.046 to 100 μM) and 
orthovanadate sensitive ATPase activity was monitored. In the MDR1 containing Sf9 vesicles olaparib 
increased the ATPase activity confirming olaparib was a substrate. No increase in activity occurred in the 
BCRP containing vesicles confirming olaparib was not a substrate. 
•  Olaparib as a P-gp, BCRP and MRP2 inhibitor 
Three studies (KMX006, KMN040 and KMX020) were undertaken to investigate the potential of olaparib to 
inhibit the efflux transporters P-gp (MDR-1), BCRP and MRP2. 
CHMP assessment report

In study KMX006, MDCKII cells were transfected with MDR1. Vinblastine sulphate (1 μM), a proto-typical 
substrate, was included on the apical or basolateral side of the membrane and the trans-membrane apical 
to basolateral (a-b) or basolateral to apical (b-a) flux measured in the absence and presence of olaparib 
(10 μM). The effect of olaparib was to reduce b-a flux of vinblastine sulphate by 14% and to increase a-b 
flux by 1.3 fold, which may indicate a weak inhibitory effect. 
A similar investigation to the above, using MDCKII cells transfected with BCRP and with cimetidine (10 
μM) as a prototypical substrate, was conducted. Olaparib reduced the b-a flux of cimetidine by 59%, 
which indicated inhibitory potential. 
In the same study, membrane vesicles isolated from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells transfected 
with either MDR1 or BCRP were incubated in the presence of the reference substrates verapamil (40 μM) 
or sulfasalazine (10 μM) respectively and ATPase activity was monitored in the absence and presence of 
olaparib (0.046 to 100 μM). The data indicated olaparib may function as an inhibitor of MDR1 activity but 
had no effect on BCRP. 
In study KMN040, the inhibitory potential of olaparib (0.1 to 100 μM) against MDR1 and BCRP, in MDCKII 
cells able to express each protein and maintained in Transwell culture, was explored more thoroughly. 
The experimental design was similar to that used in study KMX006. The prototypical substrates of MDR1 
and BCRP were [3H]-digoxin (0.05 μM) and [3H]-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo-[4,5-b]pyridine (1 
μM; [3H]-PhIP) respectively. Olaparib had no additional inhibitory effect in MDCK-MDR1 cells compared to 
control cells; which indicated olaparib had minimal or no MDR1 inhibitory potential. When incubated with 
MDCKII-BCRP cells, 100 μM olaparib inhibited [3H]-PhIP efflux by 47%; as this was < 50% an IC50 value 
was not calculated. 
In study KMX020, the capacity of olaparib (10 μM) to function as an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance 
protein 2 (MRP2), when the transporter was expressed in MDCKII cells maintained in the Transwell 
format, was investigated. Cells were preloaded with the MRP2 substrate calcein (1 μM) prior to exposure 
to olaparib. In the presence of olaparib, calcein efflux to the apical compartment was inhibited by 24% 
indicating inhibitory potential. In the second assay, isolated membranes of Sf9 insect cells containing high 
levels of human MRP2 were used to study direct interaction of KU-0059436 with the transporter 
associated ATPase activity. KU-0059436 did not enhance the basal vanadate sensitive ATPase activity in 
Sf9-MRP2 isolated membranes except at the highest concentration tested (100 μM). Incubation with 
concentrations up to 100 μM KU-0059436 did show an inhibitory effect on the probenecid-stimulated 
ATPase activity of MRP2, which was most clear at 3.7 μM (in the presence of GSH) and at 10 μM 
KU-0059436 (in the absence of GSH), but it was not concentration-dependent. 
A 
further  study 
investigated 
the  potential 
for  olaparib 
(0.3  –  100  μM) 
to 
inhibit 
carboxy-2’,7’-hydroxyfluorescein  (CDCF;  5  μM)  uptake  into  inside  out  MRP2  containing  membrane 
vesicles. MK571 (100 μM) was used as a positive control. In this assay, MK571 caused >97.7% inhibition 
of MRP2 uptake activity while olaparib had no significant inhibitory effect, indicating olaparib does not 
inhibit MRP2. 
Interaction related to uptake transporters OATP1B1, OCT1, NTCP 
Three in vitro studies (KMX042, KMN037 and KMN046) were undertaken to investigate the potential for 
olaparib to inhibit hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide), NTCP 
(sodium taurocholate co-transporting peptide) and OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1). 
In study KMX042, the mechanism of uptake of olaparib into isolated human hepatocytes was assessed by 
measuring the accumulation of olaparib (0.1 – 100 μM) into hepatocytes. Olaparib (1 μM) was then 
incubated in the absence and presence of a range of known transporter inhibitors (rifamycin SV, 
taurochenodeoxycholic acid, cyproheptadine, diclofenac and cyclosporin A) to determine if there was an 
active component to its hepatic uptake. The effect of olaparib (1.00 to 100 μM) on organic anion transport 
CHMP assessment report

polypeptide-1B1 (OATP1B1) uptake of [3H]-estrone-3-sulfate (1 μM), sodium taurocholate transport 
protein (NTCP) uptake of [3H]-taurocholic acid (0.1 μM) and organic cation transport polypeptide-1 
(OCT1) uptake of [3H]-1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium (MPP+; 1 μM) by human hepatocytes was also 
investigated. Inhibition of [3H]-estrone-3-sulfate and [3H]-taurocholic acid uptake (26 and 23% 
inhibition respectively) was only observed when olaparib was included at 100 μM so IC50 values could not 
be calculated. Inhibition of MPP+ uptake was observed across the olaparib concentration range with a 
maximum 84% inhibition observed. Technical issues with the assay led to uncertainty about the 
robustness of this result and further work is warranted; however, a tentative olaparib IC50 against OCT1 
was calculated as 11.9 μM. 
In study KMN037, the effect of olaparib (1.00 to 100 μM) on OATP1B1 uptake of [3H]- estradiol 
glucuronide (0.02 μM) in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells was investigated. In HEK-vector 
control cells, no difference in [3H]-EG uptake was observed in the presence of olaparib at concentrations 
up to 100 μM, indicating no inhibition of uptake by endogenous transporters in this cell line. In 
HEK-OATP1B1 cells, uptake of the probe substrate decreased over the concentration range studied, from 
1.319 pmoles/min/mg in the absence of olaparib to 0.294 ± 0.020 pmoles/min/mg at the highest 
concentration of 100 μM. Concentration related inhibition of up to 80% was noted indicating olaparib 
inhibited the uptake of [3H]-EG via human OATP1B1 with an estimated apparent IC50 value of 20.3 μM.  
In study KMN046, the effect of olaparib (0.10 to 100 μM) on OATP1B1 uptake was investigated using a 
clinically relevant probe-substrate pravastatin (0.135 μM) in HEK-293 cells. In the presence of olaparib, 
uptake of [3H]-pravastatin in HEK-OATP1B1 cells decreased over the concentration range studied, from 
0.757 ± 0.078 pmoles/min/mg in the absence of olaparib to 0.362 ± 0.051 pmoles/min/mg at the highest 
concentration of 100 μM. The data indicates that olaparib inhibited the uptake of [3H]-pravastatin via 
human OATP1B1 in HEK293 cells, with an estimated apparent IC50 value of 27.1 μM. 
The relationship between the calculated therapeutic maximum plasma concentration (11.0 μM), the 
unbound maximum plasma concentration (1.99 μM) following 400 mg olaparib in the capsule formulation 
and IC50 for OATP1B1 is presented in table 19. Similarly, the relationship between the calculated 
unbound maximum liver plasma concentration (Iin free) and IC50, expressed as R, is presented in table 
below. Using defined criteria (EMA 2013; FDA 2012), the Applicant claims that the relationship between 
I free or Iin free and IC50 suggest clinical investigation of OATP1B1 and OCT1 interactions may both be 
valuable.

A further study investigated uptake of olaparib (1 – 100 μM) by human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK293) 
cells that over expressed one of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1. Incubations included prototypical 
substrates (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 used 0.15 μM atorvastatin; OCT1 used 5 μM 
N-methyl-4phenylpyridinium iodide [MPP+]) and were conducted for 2, 5 and 10 minutes. In this study, 
although the prototypical substrates functioned in the relevant cell line as expected, there was no 
evidence that olaparib was a substrate for any of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1. 
The potential for olaparib to act as an inhibitor of human uptake transporters OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B3 and human efflux transporters MATE1 and MATE2K was investigated in study 13ASTRUKP7S2,. 
Each drug transport protein, individually expressed in HEK293 cells, was incubated in an established 
assay format using appropriate prototypical substrates in the absence and presence of a relevant 
standard inhibitor. Olaparib (0.3-100 μM) was included and substrate uptake rate monitored. In previous 
studies (KMN037 and KMN046), the potential of olaparib to inhibit OATP1B1 was investigated as 
submitted previously and the IC50 values are also included in Table 20.

Table 21: Interpretation of potential for olaparib to inhibit OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and 
MATE2K using EMA criteria 
In study 13, ASTRUKP7S2, olaparib was shown to inhibit OCT1, OCT2, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2K (but not 
OATP1B3 or OAT1), while in KMN037 and KMN046 olaparib was shown to inhibit OATP1B1. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Olaparib is an inhibitor of human poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3), 
which are multifunctional proteins involved in multiple cellular processes (Gibson and Kraus, 2012). 
Among the 17 members of the PARP family, at least these three proteins were found to be implicated in 
DNA repair mechanisms (Murai et al, 2012; Beck et al, 2014; Helleday, 2011). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 64/187 
 
 
  
  
The mechanism of action of olaparib is not fully elucidated. Inhibition of catalytic activity of enzymes 
results in trapping both PARP-1 and PARP-2 on DNA in complexes with olaparib, which prevents 
completion of DNA repair. This mechanism is considered as primary for cytotoxic action of PARP inhibitors 
(Murai et al, 2012; Smith et al, 2014). Other mechanisms related to DNA repair could also be involved 
(Shah et al, 2013). Moreover, off-target pharmacology of PARP inhibitors is not completely understood 
(Antolin and Mestres, 2014). 
The main mechanism of action of olaparib is thought to be related to ‘synthetic lethality’: inhibition of DNA 
repair by PARP inhibitor resulting in selective killing of cancer cells with defects in particular DNA repair 
pathway. In particular, in the absence of functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins, DNA breaks cannot be 
repaired using homologous recombination and repair is performed by alternative pathways, which are 
highly error prone and result in gross genomic instability and subsequent cell death. 
Primary pharmacology 
Inhibition of PARP-1 activity has been explored as a pharmacodynamic endpoint in tumour and surrogate 
tissue (peripheral blood mononuclear cells - PBMCs) collected primarily from the patients dosed in Studies 
02 and 07. 
Study 02 
This open-label, dose-escalating, non-randomised, multi-centre phase I study was designed to establish 
the PARP inhibitory dose range (PID) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of olaparib and to explore the 
safety, tolerability, PK and PD profiles and anti-tumour activity in the patient population. 
There were two distinct phases: a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase using the 
recommended dose established in the escalation phase. 
Optional PK and PD assessments were to be performed on patients in all groups. All patients were 
assessed for safety.  
The following doses and treatment regimens were used: 
• 
The starting dose was 10 mg/day. Olaparib was administered once daily as an oral dose of 10, 20, 
40, or 80 mg to patients for 14 consecutive days followed by a 7 day rest period.  
•  Olaparib was administered twice daily as an oral dose of 60 or 100 mg to patients for 14 
consecutive days followed by a 7 day rest period.  
•  Olaparib was administered twice daily as an oral dose of 100, 200, 400 or 600 mg to patients for 
28 consecutive days.  
The protocol allowed patients to receive up to 2 cycles, although provisions were made for patients to 
receive more than 2 cycles if the patient was deriving benefit from the treatment (in the investigator’s 
opinion) and was tolerating the treatment without dose limiting toxicities. 
This study included patients aged at least 18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant 
advanced solid tumour refractory to standard therapy or for which no suitable effective standard therapy 
exists and who have evaluable or measurable disease (as defined by RECIST).  
Overall, 98 patients were enrolled in the study and received study treatment (46 patients entering the 
dose escalation phase and 52 patients entering the dose expansion phase) and 60 (61.2%) patients had 
BRCA 1/2 mutations, of which 49 were ovarian cancer patients. The 200 mg bd dose level was selected for 
the expansion phase and contains the most patients (58). 
At the time of data cut-off (17 December 2008), 11 patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations were still receiving 
treatment and 87 patients had discontinued the study for the following reasons: 71 patients due to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 65/187 
  
  
disease progression, 5 patients refused further treatment, 4 patients due to unacceptable toxicity, 3 
patients due to intercurrent illness, 3 patients due to the investigator’s decision, and for one patient, 
death was the reason for discontinuation. 
Summary of efficacy results 
An overall RECIST response rate (complete or partial response) of 14.3% (14 in 98 patients) was 
observed in this study with responses noted at olaparib dose levels of 200 mg and 400 mg bd. 
All observed RECIST responses occurred in patients with confirmed genetic BRCA mutations (with 12 out 
of 49 with ovarian cancer) or a strong familial history of cancer. 
Summary of pharmacodynamic results 
All samples were analysed using an electrochemiluminescence-based method to determine levels of 
PARP-1 enzyme protein and levels of PAR (poly adenosine ribose chain) producing activity both in the 
presence and absence of an excess of exogenously added olaparib. 
Tumour biopsy samples were obtained from a total of 11 patients who had received 8 days of dosing with 
olaparib at doses ranging from 40 mg once daily to 600 mg twice daily. 
The calculated % PARP-1 inhibition values are shown in Figure 1. 
Note : the following doses of olaparib were taken by the 11 patients: 40 mg od (8), 80 mg od (12), 60 mg bd (16), 100 mg bd (22), 200 
mg bd (31, 50), 400 mg bd (35, 36 and 42), 600 mg bd (43, 46). 
Figure 1: % PARP-1 inhibition in tumour biopsy samples: PD population 
The PID range was determined to be at olaparib doses above 40 mg od. 
Summary of safety results 
Two dose limiting toxicities were encountered at the 600 mg bd dose level (CTCAE grade 4 
thrombocytopenia and CTCAE grade 3 somnolence) and therefore 400 mg bd was considered to be the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Study 07 
This was a Phase I open-label study to identify an effective biological dose to be used for further clinical 
studies of olaparib by using biomarkers of PARP activity to delineate a PARP inhibitory concentration 
response curve for the selected doses of olaparib in breast tumour. 
Intermediate and high risk breast cancer patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 5 dose cohorts (10 mg 
bd, 30 mg bd, 100 mg bd, 200 mg bd, and 400 mg bd) and received treatment for 4 or 5 days prior to 
surgery. 
Overall, 60 patients were randomized, 12 in each dose cohort, and all patients completed treatment.  
Summary of pharmacodynamic results 
The sample collection time information provided for collection of both PBMC and tumour samples was 
complete for all patients. The % inhibition of PARP-1 in the tumour sample and in the PBMC sample 
collected at the time of surgery was highly variable. The % inhibition of PARP-1 in tumour samples ranged 
from 20 to 80%. 
Comparison of the PAR producing activity and PARP-1 enzyme levels between tumour samples and 
samples of normal breast tissue showed that, although there was variability in both datasets, levels of 
PARP-1 enzyme and PAR producing activity appeared to be higher (on average 3- to 4-fold and 9-fold 
higher, respectively) than those in normal breast tissue. 
Population PK/PD analysis 
PARP-1 inhibition in PBMCs 
The PARP-1 inhibition and plasma concentration data from the two above studies were pooled and 
subjected to non-linear mixed effects modelling in order to evaluate the level of PARP-1 inhibition in the 
PBMC samples and the relationship between the extent of PARP-1 inhibition and plasma 
concentrations/pharmacokinetic parameters. 
The results of the modelling showed that the PARP-1 inhibition data were well described by an inhibitory 
Emax effect compartment model but that inter-individual variability on the parameters of the fitted model 
was high (approximately 50%). The estimated IC50 for PARP-1 inhibition was 19 ng/ml (44 nM). The 
pharmacodynamic effect of olaparib in the PBMC samples was achieved rapidly after dosing (maximal 
inhibition was seen at 6 hours, the first sample collected post dose) and was found to outlast the presence 
of olaparib concentrations in the plasma, with a half-life for the recovery of PARP-1 activity following 
cessation of olaparib dosing, of approximately 36 hours. The extent of inhibition of PARP-1 activity in 
PBMCs showed large inter-individual variability with % inhibition values within the same dose level 
ranging from 20% to 80% and a population average of 50 – 60%. The extent of inhibition showed a 
relationship with plasma exposure to olaparib with maximum inhibition achieved at plasma exposures 
(steady state AUC) in excess of 1000 ng.h/ml (1 μg.h/ml (2.30 μM.h)). 
PBMC PARP-1 inhibition data was also generated from samples collected from patients dosed in Study 
D0810C00001. Consistent with the Study 02 and 07 data, these data showed that following dosing at 
100, 200 and 400 mg, approximately 50 - 60% PARP-1 inhibition had been achieved by 6 hours after the 
first dose and that the same level of inhibition was maintained on multiple dosing. The extent of PARP-1 
inhibition observed was independent of dose. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 67/187 
  
  
In tumour biopsies 
PARP-1 inhibition was also determined in tumour biopsy samples collected from selected patients in Study 
02 and from all patients in Study 07 using the electrochemiluminescence technique. The level of PARP-1 
inhibition and relationships between the extent of PARP-1 inhibition and plasma 
concentrations/pharmacokinetic parameters were again determined using population PKPD analysis of 
the pooled data. This showed that inhibition of PARP-1 in tumour increased with increasing drug exposure 
with the mean population extent of inhibition estimated at 70% from the baseline value. As seen 
previously for the PBMC samples, inhibition reached a maximum at exposures (steady state AUC) values 
greater than around 1000 ng.h/ml (1 μg.h/ml or 2.30 μM.h). 
The plasma concentrations of olaparib achieved in Study 07 were approximately 50% lower than those 
observed in patients dosed in Study 02 (or indeed in any other olaparib study), and therefore the 
dose-exposure relationship from Study 02 alone was used to convert the plasma exposure associated 
with maximal inhibition back into a potential therapeutic dose. This would suggest that a dose of 40 mg 
and above would be predicted to reliably deliver a steady state AUC of ~1 μg.h/ml and therefore achieve 
maximal PARP-1 inhibition. 
With regard to higher levels of PARP-1 enzyme and PAR producing activity in the tumour than those in 
normal breast tissue, it was not possible to calculate the extent of PARP-1 inhibition in normal breast 
tissue; consequently dose and exposure-response curves for olaparib in normal breast tissue could not be 
defined. 
Exposure-response relationships with efficacy endpoints 
The population analysis of the pooled data from Studies 02, 08, 09, 12 and 24 included an exploration of 
relationships between olaparib plasma exposure and the following efficacy endpoints: change in tumour 
size, CA-125 response, objective tumour response and progression free survival. It should be noted that 
since this analysis was based only on data from patients where pharmacokinetic sampling had been 
performed, they are based on a small dataset. 
No evidence of a relationship between olaparib pharmacokinetic parameters (steady state Cmax, Cmin or 
AUC) and efficacy endpoints could be found in the data included in the analysis. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In the phase II study D0810C00012 (olaparib versus liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 ovarian cancer), one case of QT prolongation was reported. Elevation of QTcF from 429 
msec at baseline to 552 msec at day 29 was observed during olaparib treatment in one patient allowed to 
cross over to olaparib from pegylated doxorubicin. The patient also experienced adverse effects of 
hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia. The investigator considered the QTcF increase as clinically significant 
and possibly the result of electrolyte imbalance.  
Olaparib as a single dose showed no clinically relevant effect on QTcF based on a total of 60 patients from 
study D0816C00004 (following 300 mg bd for 5 days) and 59 patients from study D0816C00007 (100 
mg). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Full PK profiling was performed in four studies (Study 01, Study 02, study 10 and study 24). Sparse 
samples were collected in studies 07, study 08, study 09 and study 12 compiled and analysed with data 
from the already mentioned studies with full sampling using population-PK approach.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 68/187 
  
  
Following single and multiple dosing of olaparib to Caucasian patients at doses between 10 mg and 600 
mg (Study 02), absorption was reasonably rapid with Cmax typically achieved at between 1 and 3 hours 
after dosing (range: 0.5 to 8 hours). Exposure to olaparib showed high inter-individual variability. On 
multiple dosing there is no marked accumulation, with steady state exposures achieved within ~3 to 4 
days (see SmPC section 5.2).  
In vitro study showed that olaparib is a substrate of MDR1 transporter. In Caco-2 cells, olaparib was 
shown to have a propensity for efflux by P-glycoprotein (Pgp; MDR1). It is anticipated that efflux would be 
saturated at the concentrations actually observed in clinical situations. 
The mechanism of absorption has not clearly elucidated. However, there are indications that dissolution 
is the limiting step for absorption.  
The influence of food intake on the bioavailabilty of olaparib capsules was investigated. The data 
demonstrated that exposure to olaparib is slightly (approximately 20%) enhanced when the capsules 
were administered within 30-45 min following a standard or high fat food intake. Co-administration with 
food slowed the rate (tmax delayed by 2 hours) and marginally increased the extent of absorption of 
olaparib (AUC increased by approximately 20%). Therefore, it is recommended that patients should take 
olaparib at least one hour after food, and refrain from eating preferably for up to 2 hours afterwards (see 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
There are indications that olaparib is transferred largely to extra-vascular tissue. However, no reliable 
estimation of the Vd could be made as there were noticeable discrepancies between NCA and 
population-PK estimation. Measurable levels of olaparib were observed in tumours biopsies in all patients, 
however it is not clear if the drug levels evolve proportionally to the dose or to the systemic exposure. The 
results of the additional protein binding study showed that, as anticipated, the free fraction increased with 
increasing (and more physiological relevant) concentrations, although the increase in free fraction was 
less than proportional to the change in drug concentration. The in vitro protein binding of olaparib at 
plasma concentrations achieved following dosing at 400 mg twice daily was ~82%. Therefore, it is 
considered that the variability in plasma protein binding with the concentration could add to the observed 
high variability in exposure of olaparib.  
In vitro, CYP3A4 was shown to be the enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of olaparib. As the 
genetic polymorphism of this iso-enzyme is not known to actually modulate the enzyme capability, no 
specific investigation was conducted by the applicant with regard to genetic polymorphism. 
Following oral dosing of 14C-olaparib to female patients, unchanged olaparib accounted for the majority of 
the circulating radioactivity in plasma (70%) and was the major component found in both urine and 
faeces (15% and 6% of the dose respectively). The metabolism of olaparib was extensive. The majority 
of the metabolism was attributable to oxidation reactions with a number of the components produced 
undergoing subsequent glucuronide or sulphate conjugation. Up to 20, 37 and 20 metabolites were 
detected in plasma, urine and faeces respectively, the majority of them representing < 1% of the dosed 
material. A ring-opened hydroxycyclopropyl moiety, and two mono-oxygenated metabolites (each~10%) 
were the major circulating components, with one of the mono-oxygenated metabolites also being the 
major metabolite in the excreta (6% and 5% of the urinary and faecal radioactivity respectively) (see 
SmPC section 5.2). 
The elimination route of olaparib was not sufficiently elucidated. However, there are indications that 
Olaparib is slowly eliminated mainly by metabolism but also by renal route. The excretion of unchanged 
drug in urine was approximately 15 % of the total dose administered. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 69/187 
  
  
The total clearance by oral route (CL/F) was dependent upon dose and estimated to vary from 
approximately 4 to 15 L/h with doses varying from 100 to 400 mg. Such differences are likely due to the 
lower bioavailability at higher doses. The elimination half-life of olaparib was also dependent upon the 
dose. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of olaparib at the 400 mg twice daily capsule dose were characterised by an 
apparent plasma clearance of ~8.6 L/h, an apparent volume of distribution of ~167 L and a terminal 
half-life of 11.9 hours. 
The mass-balance study showed that olaparib is excreted both by renal and faecal route in a balanced 
way. Following a single dose of 14C-olaparib, ~86% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered within a 
7 day collection period, ~44% via the urine and ~42% via the faeces. Majority of the material was 
excreted as metabolites.  
No PK investigations of metabolites have been carried out by the applicant. The pharmacological activity 
of the 3 main circulating metabolites is unknown. Mass-balance study suggested that olaparib levels 
decline more rapidly than the total radioactivity, this is may be linked to the formation of metabolite(s) 
with lower clearance and potential for accumulation. Structural identification of M12, M15 and M18 has 
not been achieved. Therefore, these metabolites have not been monitored and potential for accumulation 
after repeated administration could not be excluded. For the same reasons, the pharmacodynamics 
potencies of these metabolites are still not known.  
The plasma binding of the metabolites of olaparib is also unknown until now. As also the pharmacological 
activity of the metabolites is unknown, the protein binding could be of interest for the three major 
metabolites in plasma (M12, M15 and M39, each accounting for ~10% of dose in plasma). The applicant 
will provide more information based on the plasma samples collected during the Renal Impairment study 
and will explore metabolite profiling and identification as a secondary objective in the ongoing Study 
D0816C00006 as detailed in the RMP. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Olaparib pharmacokinetics appeared to be almost proportional to the dose in the range of 10 up to 100 
mg.  For higher doses, systemic exposure evolved markedly less than proportionally to the dose, 
suggesting dissolution-step limiting absorption. After repeated dose, very limited potential for 
accumulation was observed. Based on the available data, time dependency in olaparib pharmacokinetics 
is not anticipated. 
Population PK analysis 
Inter-subject variability appeared to be high, but no reliable estimation of it could be made from the 
available data. Conventional studies have been performed in a very limited number of patients and the 
reliability of the estimation of inter-subject variability from the population-PK analyses is questionable. 
Within-subject variability (%CV) could not be estimated from the available data.

Special population 
No investigations have been performed in renal impaired patients and liver impaired patients. In addition, 
no reliable information could be derived from the population-PK analysis. Considering that renal route is 
not predominant in the elimination of olaparib (see mass-balance study), olaparib can be administered in 
patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min) but is not recommended in 
patients with moderate (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) and severe impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) since there were limited clinical data. Considering the lack of data in patients with 
hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin > 1.5 time upper limit of normal), olaparib is also not recommended 
in this population. In line with the risk management plan, the company will provide the results of the two 
ongoing studies in patients with liver impairment (study D0816C00005) and renal impairment (study 
D0816C00006). 
No conclusions regarding the influence of ethnicity on olaparib pharmacokinetics could be made from the 
available data. On one hand comparison of NCA data obtained in Caucasian patients (study 02) and 
Japanese (study 01) showed a significant lower exposure in the latter group of patients. It is not clear if 
such difference is linked to ethnicity or to fluctuation in the performances of the capsules between 
batches. On the other hand, only few data from non-Caucasian patients have been included in the 
analysed dataset.  
Overall, there are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on olaparib pharmacokinetics as 
clinical experience is predominantly in Caucasians (94% of patients included in the population analysis 
were Caucasian) (see SmPC section 4.2). Based on the limited data available the CHMP could not 
conclude that there is a marked ethnic difference in the PK of olaparib between Japanese and Caucasian 
patients.  
The applicant will analyse the data collected in olaparib clinical studies in non-Caucasian patients in order 
to further elucidate the influence of ethnicity (see Risk Management Plan). 
The claimed indication implies the use of olaparib in female patients only. Few data are available in male 
patients. Therefore, no conclusions could be made regarding the influence of gender on olaparib 
pharmacokinetics.  
There are no data in obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) or underweight (BMI < 18 kg/m2) patients. No specific 
recommendation of use in underweighted and obese patients can be made on the basis of the available 
data. The population analysis of the available data has found no evidence that patient weight affects 
olaparib plasma concentrations. 
There were limited data in patients aged 75 and over. The population analysis of the available data has 
found no relationship between olaparib plasma concentrations and patient age. Based on the available 
data no adjustment in starting dose is deemed to be necessary in elderly patients. 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of olaparib in paediatric patients. 
Interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been submitted. 
In vitro, olaparib produced little/no inhibition of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 2E1 and is 
not expected to be a clinically significant time dependent inhibitor of any of the P450 enzymes. In vitro 
data also showed that olaparib is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, BCRP or MRP2 substrate 
and not an inhibitor of OATP1B3, OAT1 or MRP2.

In relation to study KMX001, since substrates were incubated at their Km ([S]*=Km), one can stipulate 
that Ki= IC50/2. At the hepatic level, the calculated Ki value for CYP3A4 was likely >50µM (IC50 is 
>100µM) but this was lesser than the cut-off value of 50× Cmax,ss, unbound  for olaparib i.e. 99,5 µM. 
Therefore, a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction due to olaparib CYP inhibition at the systemic level 
cannot be ruled out.  
In the enterocyte, where CYP3A4 is in abundance, olaparib concentrations were higher and calculated Ki 
values for competitive inhibition was lower than the cut-off value of 0.1×dose/250 ml i.e. 368,24 µM for 
olaparib. Therefore, a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction due to olaparib CYP inhibition at the 
intestinal level could not be ruled out. Moreover, the time-dependent inhibition by olaparib was studied 
but only one concentration of olaparib was tested and not the most relevant, i.e. 10μM. This did not allow 
an estimation of the time-dependent inhibitory effect of olaparib notably on CYP3A at the intestinal level 
since olaparib concentrations were expected to be higher than 100μM. Therefore, the Applicant is 
recommended to conduct another in vitro study to investigate CYP3A4 inhibition by olaparib using 
concentrations up to 370 μM (the cut off for intestinal inhibition) (study ADME-AZS-Wave3-140725).  
The applicant provided evidence of the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A by olaparib with a KI = 
72.2μM and Kinact = 0.0675 min-1. However, considering this feature and using the basic model for 
prediction of in vitro-in vivo interaction, according to the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of drug 
interactions, the clinical relevance of such an effect is unlikely since the AUC ratio with inhibitor to without 
was < 1.25.  
The applicant provided the results of an in vitro study measuring the extent of change of specific CYP450 
marker enzymes (for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) following exposure of human 
hepatocytes to olaparib (study KMX002). At the highest olaparib concentration (30 μM), minor induction 
of CYP2B6 activity was observed (<40% positive control) and smaller effects on CYPs 2C9 and 2C19 
activities were noted. Nevertheless, the study setup was not considered acceptable notably due to two 
major limitations. Although the cell model and control substrates/inducers (excepted for CYP2B6) were 
adequate, the three tested concentrations (0.3 µM, 3µM and 30µM) of olaparib did not cover the worst 
case concentrations expected in the hepatocytes for the studied cytochromes (i.e. 50-fold the mean 
unbound Cmax plasma concentration obtained as steady-state or 99.5 µM), and in the intestinal tract for 
CYP3A (i.e. 0.1×dose/250 ml or 368.24 µM). Furthermore, olaparib induction potential was assessed by 
the fold-induction with olaparib relative the corresponding control, also known as the measure of activity 
whereas the measure of the mRNA change is considered more predictive of the inducing potential of a 
new drug entity than the enzymatic activity measure, notably because this is not affected by inhibition. 
Due to these limitations, the study was not considered sufficiently reliable to draw a conclusion on the 
inducing profile of olaparib towards the studied CYPs. Therefore, it remained unclear whether or not 
olaparib may be a CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9 and 19 and 3A inducer at clinically relevant concentrations. The 
Applicant is recommended to conduct further in vitro investigations to clarify this issue. Olaparib’s 
potential to induce CYPs should be tested at relevant concentrations up to 100μM, except for CYP3A4 
which should be studied up to 370μM, using preferably mRNA levels for the detection (study 1404083).  
In addition, clinical studies to evaluate the impact of known CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers have not yet 
been conducted and it is therefore recommended, as reflected in the SmPC, that known strong inhibitors 
(e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, 
nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, 
rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John’s Wort) of these isozymes should be avoided with 
olaparib (sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). Interactions with CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors is a safety 
concern included in the risk management as missing information and the applicant should provide results 
of CYP3A4 interaction and CYP3A4 induction studies using the tablet formulation (studies D0816C00007, 
D0816C00008).

The effect of olaparib as UGTs inhibitor has not been studied. The EMA DDI guideline recommends to 
study inhibition of UGTs known to be involved in drug interactions, including UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, if one 
of the major elimination pathways of the investigational drug is direct glucuronidation. However, some 
currently marketed drugs (e.g. atazanavir, erotinib, indinavir) are potent UGT inhibitors whereas they do 
not undergo a major glucuronidation, and considering the major involvement of UGT in paracetamol and 
morphine metabolism (two drugs often prescribed in oncology field), the Applicant is recommended to 
investigate the effect of olaparib as a UGT inhibitor (study 8305966). 
According to the data from in study KMX006, olaparib is a P-gp substrate in vitro (corrected efflux ratio or 
CER > 2). Furthermore, data displayed in the study KMX0040 showed that olaparib as a P-gp inhibitor can 
be discarded at the systemic level whereas at the intestinal level, where olaparib concentrations were 
higher than 100 μM, the effect is still unknown. Therefore the Applicant is recommended to investigate 
olaparib’s potential to inhibit intestinal P-gp at concentrations up to 370 μM (study 
ADME-AZS-Wave3-140714). 
Clinical studies to evaluate the impact of known P gp inhibitors and inducers have not been 
conducted.Therefore, in the event that a patient already receiving olaparib requires treatment with a 
CYP3A inhibitor or P gp inhibitor, careful monitoring of olaparib associated adverse events and 
management of those events via the dose reduction strategy is recommended. 
The Applicant provided further data as regards the inhibitory effect of olaparib towards MRP2. Results 
showed that olaparib is not expected to inhibit this transporter at clinically relevant concentrations. 
The ability of olaparib to be an OATP1B1 substrate was studied in KMX042 study. The Applicant claimed 
that data suggest a possible involvement of this transporter in the hepatic uptake of olaparib but this 
effect was assessed qualitatively and not quantitatively (no kinetic parameters has been determined). No 
conclusion can be drawn due to the variability of the test system.  
In vitro olaparib inhibited OATP1B1 uptake of pravastatin with an IC50 = 27 µM. Given that the calculated 
cut-off value of 25× Cu,inlet of olaparib is approximately 300µM, the risk for clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions due to OATP1B1 inhibition cannot be discarded. In study 13ASTRUKP7S2, there was no 
evidence that olaparib was a substrate for any of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1, although the prototypical 
substrates functioned in the relevant cell line as expected. In addition, although data from studies 
KMN037 and KMN046 showed olaparib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, new data from study 13ASTRUKP7S2 
showed it not to be an inhibitor of OATP1B3. Thus additional interactions with statins through that 
mechanism would not be expected. For safety reason, a drug-drug interaction study with a statin was not 
encouraged.  
Overall, based on the available PK data, it was considered appropriate to warn on a risk of interaction with 
drugs known to be substrate of CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, P-gp, BRCP, OATP1B1, OCT1 
and OCT2 in section 4.5 of the SmPC.  
The potential for olaparib to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and P gp is unknown and 
it cannot be excluded that olaparib upon co administration may reduce the exposure to substrates of 
these metabolic enzymes and transport protein. The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced 
if co administered with olaparib (see SmPC sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6).  
Olaparib may inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro and it cannot be excluded that olaparib may increase the exposures 
to substrates of this enzyme in vivo. Therefore, caution should be exercised when substrates of CYP3A4 
are combined with olaparib, in particular those with a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. simvastatin, 
cisapride, cyclosporine, ergot alkaloids, fentanyl, pimozide, sirolimus, tacrolimus and quetiapine). 
CHMP assessment report

In vitro olaparib may be an inhibitor of P-gp and is an inhibitor of BRCP, OATP1B1, OCT1 and OCT2. It 
cannot be excluded that olaparib may increase the exposure to substrates of P-gp (e.g. statins, digoxin, 
dabigatran, colchicine), BRCP (e.g. methotrexate, rosuvastatin and sulfasalazine), OATP1B1 (e.g. 
bosentan, glibenclamide, repaglinide, statins, and valsartan), OCT1 (e.g. metformin) and OCT2 (e.g. 
serum creatinine). In particular, caution should be exercised if olaparib is administered in combination 
with any statin (see SmPC sections 4.5). 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of olaparib, based on an assessment of its ability to inhibit Poly (ADP-Ribose) 
polymerase-1 in vivo in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in tumour biopsies, have been 
characterised in patients with advanced solid tumours (study 02) and patients with intermediate to high 
risk breast cancer scheduled for elective surgery (study 07). 
Overall, evidence of inhibition of PARP-1 activity has been seen in PBMC and tumour samples from 
patients dosed with olaparib at all dose levels studied (10 mg to 600 mg) but the data showed wide inter- 
individual and intra-individual variability in the extent of inhibition achieved.  
An assessment of γH2AX foci appears to be more reliable biomarker, but PD data were provided in few 
ovarian cancer tissue samples and surrogate tissues (hair follicles).  
The link between the clinical efficacy of olaparib and PD biomarker could not be established since PD 
samples were either collected from a study in which efficacy was not an endpoint or where BRCA mutation 
status was not known. 
In a pooled population based analysis of PK/PD data, investigations were undertaken to provide a PK/PD 
(descriptive and statistical) evaluation of the relationship of the pharmacokinetics (predicted plasma 
concentration) of olaparib to the inhibition of PARP-1 (PD effect) in both PBMC and tumour samples, and 
to correlate the plasma concentration time profile to tumour concentrations of olaparib. The PK/PD 
relationship established for PARP-1 inhibition did not appear to be predictive of clinical outcome. A 
relationship between PK parameters and efficacy or tolerability endpoints has not been defined. 
Overall, available pharmacodynamic data indicated that the observed clinical efficacy is not only due to 
the inhibition of PAR-forming activity, but involves some other mechanisms either related to DNA repair 
or not (Pettitt et al, 2013; Benson et al, 2006; Schiewer et al, 2012, Do et Chen, 2013, Curtin et Szabo, 
2013). It is not known to what degree the off-target effects might contribute to anti-tumour effects. The 
Applicant provided a discussion based on available pre-clinical and clinical data as well as on literature 
data concerning potential anti-tumoral (or pro-tumoral) effects of olaparib related to known functions of 
PARP-1 and PARP-2 (other than those related to DNA damage repair). In particular, potential anti-tumoral 
olaparib activity in relation to its PARP interference in cell death signalling, transcriptional regulation, cell 
proliferation, immune regulation, estrogen receptor signalling and angiogenesis could not be excluded. 
For instance, anti-angiogenic activity is suggested by pre-clinical and clinical data (Tentori et al, 2007; 
Dean et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2014). 
For the time being, PARP inhibition is probably the main contributor to the efficacy of olaparib. Other 
mechanisms are not excluded and could play a role, but this is difficult to establish based on the currently 
available evidence.

The long-term effects of PARP-inhibition related to DNA damage induction in normal cells (either fully 
BRCA-competent or harbouring haploinsufficiency) were discussed by the Applicant. Risks related to 
chronic DNA damage following olaparib exposure, whether in individuals harbouring gBRCA mutation or 
not, are not completely elucidated. It cannot be excluded that in conditions of hypoxia some cells may 
develop reduced homologous recombination repair functionality what would make haplo-insufficient cells 
potentially more sensitive to the action of olaparib. In such cells exposure to olaparib could lead to an 
induction of genomic instability and potential tumor transformation. Although rare, cases of MDS/AML 
and of other new primary malignancies were reported in patients treated with olaparib. Altered mRNA 
profiles were observed in primary ‘normal’ (haplo-insufficient) breast and ovarian cells in patients with 
germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, indicating that phenotypic differences do occur in these cells 
(Bellacosa et al, 2010). BRCA1 mutant breast cells showed enhanced colony formation potential ex vivo 
as well as impaired lineage commitment in differentiation assays (Burga et al, 2009; Proia et al, 2011). 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 haploinsufficiency alone can compromise genome stability by triggering spontaneous 
recombination events that are likely to account for the increased risk of cancer promoting mutations 
(Cousineau et al, 2007; Kote-Jarai et al, 2006). Mutation of a single allele of BRCA1 was shown to lead to 
genomic instability in human breast cancer epithelial cells (Konishi et al, 2011). It was proposed that 
BRCA1 haploinsufficiency, causing genomic instability, may be contributive to breast cancer initiation 
(Natrajan R et al, 2012). 
The Applicant was asked to discuss which investigational methods could allow to address the potentially 
enhanced risk of secondary malignancies in BRCA-haploinsufficient and in BRCA-proficient cells following 
exposure to olaparib. The provided non-clinical models did not allow concluding on the absence of 
potential olaparib contribution to tumorigenesis in BRCA-haploinsufficient background in the context of 
long-term exposure. The consequences of long-term exposure of normal cells to olaparib were not 
sufficiently documented. However, it is acknowledged that experiments with ex vivo exposure of human 
cells to olaparib would be of value, but not relieve the concerns about secondary malignancies in 
BRCA-haploinsufficient patients and this issue can only be properly addressed by rigorous monitoring 
post-marketing in patients receiving olaparib. This is considered as missing information which is 
appropriately addressed in the RMP. 
Regarding the secondary pharmacology, at this moment it is not thought that olaparib has a significant 
effect on QTc.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The effects of olaparib on the main CYP450 enzymes and on the main efflux/uptake transporters, as a 
substrate, inhibitor and/or inducer, have been investigated and relevant recommendations included in 
the SmPC. Besides, further studies are planned and ongoing to further evaluate the effect of a potent 
inhibitor or inducer on olaparib pharmacokinetics (see RMP). 
The use of olaparib in special populations and long term toxicity of olaparib are also adequately addressed 
in the RMP.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study 09 
This was an international, multi-centre, proof-of-concept, single-arm, Phase II study. Two sequential 
patient cohorts received continuous oral olaparib in 28-day cycles initially at 400 mg bd and subsequently 
at 100 mg bd. 
The patient population participating in this study comprised 58 women with advanced BRCA1- or 
BRCA2-associated ovarian cancer (includes patients who are found to have loss-of-function mutations in 
the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes as determined by the BRACAnalysis assay). 
One patient was not allocated to treatment and was excluded from all analysis sets. 
Of the remaining 57 patients (respectively 24 and 33 in the 100 and 400 mg bd group): 
- 24 successfully completed the full study schedule up to and including cycle 6, 
- 5 patients (respectively 2 and 3 in the 100 and 400 mg bd group) were ongoing at the data cut-off for 
the CSR (17 March 2009), 
- 33 patients (respectively 17 and 16) discontinued olaparib before completing the full study schedule 
mostly due to disease progression (respectively 16 and 10 patients).  
Following implementation of protocol amendment 3, 6 patients in the 100 mg bd group dose escalated to 
400 mg bd. 
In the ITT analysis set the confirmed RECIST ORR (Objective tumour response i.e. Complete Response 
and Partial Response) overall was 33.3% at 400 mg bd and 12.5% at 100 mg bd (14 out of 57 i.e. 24.6% 
in total).  
With regard to secondary efficacy variables:  
- Overall clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD = stable disease for ≥8 weeks ± 1 week visit window) was 
greater in the 400 mg bd group than in the 100 mg bd group (69.7% vs 41.7%);  
- The median duration of response was 290 days (range 126 to 506 days) for the 400 mg bd group and 
269 days (range 169 to 288 days) for the 100 mg bd group. One out of 3 responses in the 100 mg bd 
group and 3 out of 11 responses in the 400 mg bd group were ongoing at data cut-off; 
- The median best percentage change from baseline in the 400 mg bd group was a 29.0% reduction in 
tumour size compared to a 0% reduction in the 100 mg bd group; 
- Median (95% CI) PFS was 177.0 (85-323) days in the 400 mg bd group and 58.0 (56-110) days in the 
100 mg bd group.

Data on platinum sensitivity status at study entry directly were not collected as part of Study 09. The date 
of completion of the last platinum containing chemotherapy and the start date of the next treatment were 
collected and used to retrospectively assign a platinum sensitivity status, presuming that the start of next 
treatment indicated progressive disease. Using the indirect criteria as described above to assign a 
platinum sensitivity status, the majority of patients entering the study were platinum resistant with 7/33 
(21%) patients treated with olaparib 400 mg bd considered to be platinum sensitive (PD >6 months after 
completion of last platinum); and 26/33 (79%) patients platinum resistant (PD ≤6 months of completion 
of last platinum). Of the 7 patients considered to be platinum sensitive, 1 (14%) was a responder; of the 
26 patients considered to be platinum resistant, 10 (38%) were responders (complete response or a 
partial response by RECIST criteria) during treatment with olaparib 400 mg bd.  
Study 12 
This was a Phase II, open-label, randomised, comparative, multicentre study to compare the safety and 
efficacy of 2 different doses of olaparib with intravenous liposomal doxorubicin in the treatment of 
patients with advanced breast cancer gene BRCA1- or BRCA2-associated ovarian cancer who have failed 
previous platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive either olaparib 200 
mg twice daily (bd) orally, olaparib 400 mg bd orally, or liposomal doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 intravenously 
(iv). 
Half of patients were platinum resistant in this study. 
Patients were treated until they had radiologically-confirmed progressive disease (PD) or were withdrawn 
from treatment for another reason. Once patients on olaparib or liposomal doxorubicin had been 
withdrawn from treatment, other treatment options were at the discretion of the investigator. 
Once patients on liposomal doxorubicin had centrally confirmed objective radiological progression, they 
were given the opportunity to begin treatment with olaparib (400 mg bd dose level) if eligible to do so. 
Of the 97 patients randomised into the study, all olaparib patients (32 in each group) and 32 liposomal 
doxorubicin patients received study treatment.  
At data cut-off for PFS analysis (15 September 2009), 10 (31.3%), 12 (37.5%), and 7 (21.9%) patients 
in the olaparib 200 mg bd group, olaparib 400 mg bd group, and the liposomal doxorubicin group, 
respectively, were still receiving their initial study treatment. 
At the time of the PFS analysis, a total of 14 patients had crossed over from the liposomal doxorubicin 
group to the olaparib 400 mg bd group. 
At time of final analysis of OS (30 April 2010), a total of 27 (84.4%), 26 (81.3%), 29 (90.6%) patients in 
the olaparib 200 mg bd group, olaparib 400 mg bd group, and the liposomal doxorubicin group, 
respectively, discontinued treatment prematurely. 
The statistical analysis of investigator-assessed PFS showed no statistically-significant difference 
between olaparib monotherapy and liposomal doxorubicin (HR 0.88, 80% CI 0.62 to 1.28, p=0.6604). 
Olaparib 400 mg was numerically superior to olaparib 200 mg bd versus liposomal doxorubicin [olaparib 
400 mg bd: HR 0.86, 80% CI 0.56 to 1.30, olaparib 200 mg bd: HR 0.91, 80% CI 0.60 to 1.39]), but 
neither was statistically significantly different to liposomal doxorubicin. 
In addition, the CIs were too wide to draw conclusions regarding the subgroup analyses of PFS.  
With regard to secondary efficacy variables (Objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of 
response, tumour size, CA-125 levels, overall survival, and quality of life) there was no statistically 
significant difference between either olaparib group and the liposomal doxorubicin group for any of the 
parameters. Treatment with olaparib 400 mg bd was generally numerically superior to treatment with 
olaparib 200 mg bd but there was no marked difference in efficacy.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Pivotal study 
Study D0810C00019 
Study D0810C00019 was a phase II randomised, double blind, multicentre study to assess the efficacy of 
olaparib in the treatment of patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) high grade serous ovarian 
cancer following treatment with two or more platinum containing regimens. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Patients were enrolled and randomised at 82 sites in 16 countries: Australia (7), Belgium (2), Czech 
Republic (1), Estonia (1), Germany (8), Israel (7), Canada (3), France (5), Netherlands (1), Poland (7),

Patients with low grade ovarian carcinoma (grade 1). 
Patients who had drainage of their ascites during the final 2 cycles of their last chemotherapy 
regimen prior to enrolment on the study. 
Previous treatment with PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except for palliative 
reasons) within 2 weeks from the last dose prior to study entry.  
Patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, 
curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Stage 1, grade 1 
endometrial carcinoma, or other solid tumours including lymphomas (without bone marrow 
involvement) curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥5 years. 
Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases.  
Treatments 
Treatments administered 
Patients were administered olaparib or matching placebo (capsule formulation) orally at 400 mg bd, 
continually throughout a 28 day cycle. Eight 50 mg olaparib or matching placebo capsules were to be 
taken at the same times each day, with approximately 240 mL of water. 
Due to the potential effect of food on absorption, patients were instructed to take their doses of olaparib 
or matching placebo at least 1 hour after food and to refrain from eating for a further 2 hours. The olaparib 
capsules were to be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided.  
Patients continued taking olaparib or matching placebo capsules until objective disease progression 
(determined by RECIST) provided that, in the Investigator’s opinion, they were benefiting from treatment 
and they did not meet any other discontinuation criteria. 
Any toxicity observed during the course of the study was managed by supportive medical care and/or 
interruption of the dose (maximum of 4 weeks on each occasion) if deemed appropriate by the 
Investigator. Where toxicity reoccurred following re-challenge with olaparib or matching placebo capsules, 
and where further dose interruptions were considered inadequate for management of toxicity, then the 
patient was to be considered for dose reduction or had to permanently discontinue treatment with 
olaparib or matching placebo. 
Any patient enrolled on the study that missed a scheduled dose (>2 hours after the scheduled dose time) 
the missed dose was not to be taken and the patient was to take their next normal dose at its scheduled 
time.

Prior and concomitant therapy 
Patients could not have received prior olaparib or other PARP inhibitor treatment. Patients could have 
received prior bevacizumab, except in the regimen immediately prior to randomisation. Retreatment with 
olaparib was not permitted following progression on olaparib. 
Other medications considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well-being could be given at the 
discretion of the investigators.  
- No other chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (hormone replacement therapy [HRT] was acceptable) or 
other novel agent was permitted during the course of the study for any patient (the patient could receive 
a stable dose of corticosteroids during the study provided these were started at least 4 weeks prior to 
enrolment). 
- Palliative radiotherapy was allowed for pre-existing small areas of painful metastases that could not be 
managed with local or systemic analgesics provided there was no evidence of disease progression. 
- Prophylactic cytokine (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor) administration was not to be given in the 
first cycle of the study. 
- An increased risk of infection by the administration of live virus and bacterial vaccines has been 
observed with conventional chemotherapy drugs. Effects with olaparib are unknown and, therefore, they 
were not to be administered to patients in the study. 
- In vitro data have shown that the principal enzyme responsible for the formation of the 3 main 
metabolites of olaparib is CYP3A4 and, consequently, although the contribution of metabolic clearance to 
total drug clearance in man is currently unknown, to ensure patient safety all patients were to avoid 
concomitant use of drugs, herbal supplements and/or ingestion of foods known to modulate CYP3A4 
enzyme activity and drugs that are known to be CYP3A4 substrates from the time they entered the 
screening period until 30 days after the last dose of study medication. 
- Patients should refrain from drinking grape fruit juice and eating star fruit (averrhoa carambola) while 
taking the study medication.

Determination of BRCA status 
BRCA mutation testing was not mandatory for patients to participate in the study. However, BRCA 
mutation status data were obtained by three routes, as summarised below. Each route involved 
determination of gene sequence variants present within a patient’s sample and classification of the 
sequence variant as to whether it could be regarded as causal of an increased risk of breast and ovarian 
cancer when inherited. 
Route (i) for patients with pre-existing BRCA test results, the sequence variants (as determined on a 
blood sample) and local testing laboratory classification were captured in CRFs. This was pre-specified in 
the Clinical Study Protocol (CSP). 
Route (ii) blood samples from patients who consented to the optional genetic analysis were analysed and 
classified. This was retrospectively performed. 
Route (iii) archival tumour samples in patients who consented to genetic analysis were analysed for 
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2: the sequence variants were classified, by the Applicant. This was 
retrospectively performed. 
BRCA testing methodologies 
•  Germline BRCA testing

The integrated BRACAnalysis assay was a test for the detection and classification of variants in the BRCA1 
and BRCA2 genes using genomic DNA obtained from whole blood. Integrated BRACAnalysis included 
complete Sanger sequencing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and an assessment of large rearrangements 
in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The tests were independent of each other but data from both was used 
to give a thorough assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. Sequence analysis consisted of 
sequencing of all translated exons and immediately adjacent intronic regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 
genes (a total of over 17,600 base pairs analysed). This test was also designed to detect duplications and 
deletions involving the promoter region and coding exons of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The amplified products 
were sequenced in forward and reverse directions and the resulting sequencing data was analysed with 
the developed proprietary DNA sequence analysis software. Any potential variants, called by the 
software, were then routed for review and verification. All potential clinically significant variants were 
independently confirmed by repeated PCR amplification of the indicated gene region(s) and 
re-sequencing. Large rearrangement analysis consists of a comprehensive rearrangement test of both 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 by quantitative PCR analysis (BRACAnalysis Rearrangement Test or BART). 
This analysis was used to determine copy number abnormalities indicative of deletion or duplication 
mutations across the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. A software analysis was used to normalise the copy 
number of individual amplicons in the BRCA1 gene against BRCA2, plus three control genes. Any sample 
with a potential large rearrangement mutation was reviewed and verified. Patient samples positive for 
deletions or duplications were confirmed by a repeat multiplex quantitative PCR analysis. 
• 
Tumour BRCA testing 
An informative genomic profiling platform, based on next generation sequencing, was used to identify a 
patient’s individual molecular alterations. A targeted assessment of key cancer related genes, utilizing 
next generation sequencing with routine cancer specimens was performed. The test simultaneously 
sequenced all coding exons of 282 cancer-related genes to an average depth of at least 250-fold coverage 
(250 sequencing reads covering each nucleotide position in the exons). This assay could detect genomic 
alterations including base substitutions, small base insertions and deletions, larger copy number 
alterations (exon amplification or deletions) and rearrangements (recurrent translocations in 20 genes as 
well as large scale rearrangements in all 282 genes) using routine formalin fixed paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) tissue samples. This assay included the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The tumour BRCA data 
generated by patient E-code reported the sequencing coverage for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the 
specific nucleotide variants, as well as copy number changes and gene rearrangements 
The Applicant combined available data for germline BRCA mutation status and tumour BRCA mutation 
status provided from the various sources and re-classified the data into the categories listed below to 
define the subgroups for analysis. Data obtained via the case report form (CRF) did not provide 
information on BRCA mutations (variants) of unknown significance (VUS) so no CRF data were reported 
for the “BRCA Unknown” category. 
1. BRCA mutated 
• 
• 
patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation identified via germline testing, or 
patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation identified in the tumour. 
2. BRCA wildtype/BRCA unknown (variant of unknown significance; VUS): patients who were not BRCA 
mutated as defined above and at least one of the following: 
•  Germline data indicated a genetic variant of unknown significance, or 
• 
patients who have undergone complete germline BRCA testing but with no deleterious or 
suspected deleterious mutation documented, or

• 
• 
patients who have previously undergone testing at a local site and have no deleterious or 
suspected deleterious mutation documented, or 
tumour data showed either a BRCA variant of unknown significance or wild type. 
3. BRCA missing 
• 
• 
patients who were not classified as BRCA mutated, BRCA wildtype/BRCA unknown (VUS) as 
defined above, and 
patients either did not have complete BRCA test reported and did not have BRCA result recorded 
from tumour analysis or a BRCA result recorded in the CRF.

Sample size 
The study was planned on the basis that there would be 2 co-primary analysis populations: the first 
comprising all patients, the second comprising a subset of patients defined to be HRD. 
The HRD status of patients could not be established because the Applicant did not have a diagnostic test 
to identify patients with HRD tumours. The analysis of efficacy in the HRD sub-population formed an 
exploratory objective of the study. This will be addressed when a suitable identification process has been 
defined.  
The following information refers to the HRD population in order to provide a clear understanding of the 
original sample size calculation. 
The primary analysis was to be performed when a total of 137 PFS events had been observed in the 
overall population: this was reported in the CSR dated 26 July 2011 with 153 progression events. If the 
true HR was 0.75 (likely to correspond to a 33% increase in median PFS from 9 to 12 months) and the 
overall type I error rate was 20% (1-sided), there would be approximately 80% power to demonstrate a 
promising difference in favour of olaparib (ie, p<0.2, 1-sided). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 85/187 
 
  
  
The second co-primary analysis, in the HRD population, was to be performed at the time of the first 
co-primary analysis. If the true HR was equal to 0.62 (likely to correspond to a 61% increase in median 
PFS from 9 to 14 months) and the overall type I error rate was 20% (1-sided), there was approximately 
80% power to demonstrate a promising difference in favour of olaparib (p<0.2, 1-sided) in the HRD group 
when 50 events were expected to have occurred. 
The calculation for the overall population assumed that the HR for the non-HRD group was 0.9. Statistical 
significance at conventional levels, in favour of olaparib, was to be declared in the overall population for 
PFS if the observed p-value was <0.025 (1-sided). 
It was prospectively defined to perform an initial analysis of OS at the time of the PFS Data cut off (DCO) 
only if there were sufficient events (at least 20) to make it meaningful, with a final analysis of OS at a later 
point with more mature data. Statistical significance, in favour of olaparib, was to be declared in the 
overall population for OS if the observed p-value at the first OS analysis was <0.0125 (1-sided). The 
corresponding level of significance at the second OS analysis was to be calculated at the time of analysis. 
The overall Type I error rate for OS was to be controlled at the 2.5% level (1-sided) by accounting for the 
correlation between the 2 analyses. 
It was intended that a total of 250 patients (125 patients in the olaparib group and 125 in the placebo 
group) would be randomised to the study. Assuming an HRD prevalence of 50% and a 25% attrition of 
samples, 94 patients would be included in the HRD group. If patients were recruited over 15 months 
according to a non-linear cumulative recruitment function of (t/15)2, and if the median PFS for the 
placebo group was 9 months, it was predicted that 137 PFS events overall (50 in the HRD group) would 
occur at 23 months after the first patient had entered the study. 
Interim analyses 
It was initially planned that the IDMC would conduct a single interim analysis of PFS when approximately 
80 PFS events had occurred. The objective of this interim analysis was to determine whether there was 
sufficient efficacy to trigger a Phase III study in the overall population as per the IDMC charter. There was 
no intention to stop the study early on the basis of good efficacy results from the interim analysis. 
However, from emerging information in the ongoing olaparib programme, the Applicant determined in 
February 2010 that the interim analysis was not required to trigger Phase III studies and the interim 
analysis was not to be performed. 
As only 1 analysis of PFS took place no adjustments were required to control the Type I error. 
Consideration was to be given to formally analysing OS twice, depending on sufficient numbers of death 
events at the time of the primary analysis of PFS. If this was the case, the overall type I error for the OS 
analyses would be controlled at the 2.5% level (1-sided) by accounting for the correlation between the 
analyses. As part of CSP amendments, the AstraZeneca clinical project team added an interim analysis of 
OS, to be performed when there were approximately 100 deaths (~40% maturity) and then the final OS 
analysis was to be performed at approximately 85% maturity (~222 deaths).  
Randomisation 
Patients were to be randomised within 8 weeks after their last dose of the platinum containing regimen in 
a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 arms. The randomisation scheme was stratified based on: 
1. The time to disease progression from the completion of the penultimate platinum-containing therapy 
(last dose) prior to enrolment on the study: 
a. >6 to ≤12 months. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 86/187 
  
  
b. >12 months. 
2. Objective response to the last platinum-containing regimen prior to enrolment on the study 
a. CR (defined as normal radiological findings and CA-125 within the normal range): 
b. PR (defined as a RECIST PR and/or GCIG CA-125 response) 
3. The ethnic descent of the patient: 
a. Jewish 
b. Non Jewish 
Crossover to olaparib was not permitted within the design of the study, but patients were able to access 
PARP inhibitors outside of the study, and subsequent PARP inhibitor use was documented.  
Blinding (masking) 
Olaparib and placebo matched olaparib treatments were blinded. The active and placebo capsules were 
identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the study medication.  
Patients were not to be unblinded prior to the final PFS analysis, unless knowledge of the treatment 
assignment was necessary for the management of medical emergencies, or the patient was considered 
for enrolment into a study in which prior PARP therapy was not allowed. 
Statistical methods 
Definition of Analysis Sets 
Efficacy data from this study was summarised and analysed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis using 
randomised treatment. The primary analysis population was based on the FAS. 
Two main analysis sets were used in the statistical analyses: 
Full analysis set (FAS): Included all randomised patients and compared the treatment groups on the basis 
of randomised treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received or protocol deviations. 
Safety analysis set: A subset of the FAS that included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication (olaparib or placebo). Treatment group comparisons were based on the initial dose of study 
treatment actually received. 
Statistical Methodology 
Analysis of variables 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
There was 1 comparison of interest for PFS, namely olaparib (capsule formulation) compared with 
olaparib matching placebo in the overall population. 
PFS was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model. All efficacy analyses were adjusted according 
to the true levels of the covariates (Ethnic descent, platinum sensitivity, response to final platinum 
therapy), regardless of the levels declared at randomization in the IVRS. 
The primary analysis of PFS did not censor patients who started subsequent therapy prior to progression.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 87/187 
  
  
As prespecified in the SAP, a global interaction test was to be performed to test the overall strength of 
evidence for consistency over all the subgroups defined by the stratification factors plus BRCA status. If 
the global interaction test was found to be statistically significant (p<0.1) an attempt to determine the 
cause and type of interaction would be made. 
Several sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed. An evaluation-time bias analysis using generalised 
log-rank tests for interval-censored failure time data was carried out to assess possible time-assessment 
bias. Attrition bias was assessed by repeating the primary PFS analysis except that the actual PFS event 
times were used rather than the censored times of patients who progressed or died in the absence of 
progression immediately following 2, or more, non-evaluable tumour assessments. A supportive analysis 
of PFS using the stratified log rank test was performed (stratified by ethnic descent, platinum sensitivity 
and response to final platinum therapy). An exploratory analysis using the full analysis set (FAS) that 
included BRCA status in the Cox model was also carried out. 
In the original analysis, the primary variable of PFS was derived based on investigator assessments 
recorded on the CRFs. The study protocol required radiological examinations to be retained at the study 
sites in order to allow a blinded independent central review if required. 
A retrospective blinded independent central review of scans was performed as a sensitivity analysis to 
confirm the robustness of the original primary PFS analysis.  
Sub-group analyses of PFS were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with factors for 
treatment, ethnic descent, platinum sensitivity, and response to final platinum therapy. If there were too 
few results available for a meaningful analysis of a particular subgroup (it was not considered appropriate 
to present analyses where there were less than 20 events in a subgroup), the relationship between that 
subgroup and PFS was not formally analysed but descriptive summaries were provided.  
The following sub-groups were explored: 
•  BRCA mutated / BRCA wild type or variant of unknown significance / BRCA status missing (see 
definitions above); 
age <50 years; age ≥50 to <65 years; age ≥65 years; 
race=White; 
non-Jewish descent; 
• 
• 
• 
•  CR at baseline / PR at baseline (Note, response to previous platinum covariate was defined using 
presence of disease at baseline via RECIST data; presence = PR, absence = CR); 
• 
Time to progression (TTP) penultimate platinum 6 to 12 months / >12 months. 
In the original CSR the sub-group analysis by BRCA status was based on gBRCA status recorded on the 
CRF at entry to the study, whilst the current analysis additionally considers both germline and tumour 
BRCA status at entry and hence the sample size for the current analyses by BRCA status was larger than 
in the original CSR. 
Overall Survival (OS) 
The analysis of OS was to use the same methodology and model as described for the primary analysis of 
PFS and was prospectively defined to be performed only if at the time of the PFS analysis there were 
sufficient events (20 or more) to make it meaningful. A Kaplan Meier plot of OS was presented by 
treatment group. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 88/187 
  
  
Three additional exploratory analyses of intermediate clinical endpoints were conducted at the time of the 
58% interim OS analysis, to evaluate whether PFS benefits are maintained with longer follow up, and to 
assess time to second progression: 
• 
• 
• 
time to discontinuation of olaparib/placebo treatment (TDT), defined as the time from 
randomisation to discontinuation of olaparib/placebo treatment or death; 
time to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST), defined as the time from randomisation to the 
start date of the first cancer therapy received following the discontinuation of olaparib/placebo or 
death; 
time to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST), defined as the time from randomisation to 
the start of a patient’s second cancer therapy subsequent to the discontinuation of 
olaparib/placebo or death. 
No adjustments were made for multiplicity introduced by analysing multiple endpoints (excluding OS), or 
analyses within the BRCA subgroups. The multiplicity adjustment for OS was amended when there were 
insufficient OS events at the time of the PFS analysis and an interim at 100 deaths (~40% maturity) 
added. In October 2012, the protocol was further amended and the OS analysis at 60% maturity was 
classed as a subsequent interim analysis with a final analysis planned to occur at approximately 85% 
maturity. This amendment detailed the change to the multiplicity adjustment in order to continue 
controlling the overall alpha at 2.5% (1-sided); the significance level at the 40% interim analysis was as 
specified in November 2011 (p-value <0.0005 1-sided), the significance level at the 60% analysis would 
be p<0.015 (1-sided) and at each subsequent analysis half the remaining alpha will be spent, unless it is

Data cut-off: 26 November 2012. 
Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 28 August 2008 and the last patient was enrolled on 9 February 2010. 
The Clinical Study Report presented the 58% interim overall survival data cut-off: 26 November 2012 and 
the primary progression free survival analysis (data cut-off: 30 June 2010).  
Conduct of the study 
The main protocol amendments to the CSP are described below: 
Amendment 01 (27 November 2008) 
• 
• 
Primary objective expanded to include patients with HRD tumours  
Inclusion criterion 4 amended to reflect that response to the last platinum-containing 
chemotherapy had to be maintained at study entry. Additionally, following feedback from study 
investigators, the window between last dose of platinum-containing regimen and starting study 
treatment was extended from 6 weeks to 8 weeks from the last chemotherapy treatment. The last 
chemotherapy regimen was to have consisted of at least 4 treatment cycles to exclude patients 
who could have had a poor prognosis. 
•  Clarification that patients could continue to receive study treatment following objective disease 
progression if the investigator felt the patient was benefiting from treatment, and the patient did 
not meet any other discontinuation criteria. 
•  Clarification that dose delays/modifications were not mandated for cases of leucopenia and/or 
anaemia. 
Amendment 02 (14 May 2009) 
•  An interim analysis of PFS was included in the study to provide an early indication of efficacy and 
the text was revised to account for the statistical implications of this (including the determination 
of sample size). The text was revised to discuss the IDMC that will perform the interim analysis. 
Amendment  03 (17 May 2010) 
•  As of February 2010, it was decided that the interim analysis of PFS was no longer required. 
•  Analysis of PFS in the HRD population was removed as a co-primary objective because an assay 
to identify HRD patients was not available at the time of primary analysis. The analysis may be 
performed when an assay becomes available, hence has been changed to become an exploratory 
objective, and will be reported separately from the CSR. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 90/187 
 
  
  
Amendment  04 (2 November 2010 i.e. after the primary PFS database lock and when the results of the 
primary analysis were known.) 
• 
The duration of the study was amended based on the current best estimate of the OS event rate 
and the number of OS events required for the final analysis. As there were insufficient events for 
a meaningful analysis of OS at the time of the PFS analysis then the significance level for the 
single, later analysis of OS will be set at 2.5% (1-sided). The final analysis of OS is scheduled to 
take place when there are a similar number of OS events as PFS events in the primary analysis, 
to enable the data to be assessed with a similar level of precision. For example, with 137 events 
there will be 80% power to demonstrate superior OS at the 1-sided 2.5% level if the true HR is 
0.62 (approximate medians 24 months versus 39 months). Assuming a median survival of 24 
months in the control arm and 12 months non-linear recruitment starting 6 months after FSI (to 
approximately reflect observed recruitment) the final data cut-off for OS is expected to occur 
around 46 months after First Subject In. 
Amendment  05 (1 November 2011) 
•  Addition of an interim analysis of OS, to be performed when approximately 100 deaths have 
occurred, with the final analysis of survival at the same maturity as the PFS analysis: 
• 
This interim analysis was scheduled in order to provide sufficient confidence to be able to start a 
Phase III study. Improving survival is recognised to be an important clinical outcome for 
maintenance treatment and although the final OS analysis of Study D0810C00019 will provide 
this confidence, the event rate is slow and the data will not be available for at least 12 months. 
Amendment 06 (17 October 2012) 
•  After the interim analysis of OS is performed when approximately 100 deaths have occurred, a 
subsequent interim analysis of survival will be performed at approximately the same maturity as 
the PFS analysis (~60% maturity) (per amendment 05). The final survival analysis will be 
performed at approximately 85% maturity (~222 deaths). Collection of survival data will not 
continue beyond 85% maturity. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 52.8% patients (57.4% olaparib versus 48.1% placebo) were defined as having “important” 
deviations in the study that could potentially have influenced the assessment of efficacy with a total of: 
- 79 patients (29.8%) were mis-stratified in the interactive voice response system (IVRS) by study sites, 
with a larger proportion of patients in the olaparib group compared with the placebo group (35.3% 
olaparib vs 24.0% placebo). The randomisation was stratified by 3 factors and the majority of the 
discrepancies between data recorded on the IVRS and the CRF were due to Time to Penultimate Platinum 
disease progression (22 patients were entered into the IVRS as having 6-12 months to penultimate 
progression but as >12 months on the CRF, the converse for 14 patients) and Response to prior disease 
(28 patients were recorded on the IVRS as being in complete response but had disease at baseline 
according to RECIST, the converse for 21 patients); 
- 34.0% of patients had “important” deviations other than IVRS mis-stratifications (33.8% olaparib vs 
34.1% placebo). Only a minority were considered to have the potential to impact the overall efficacy 
conclusions. 
The other “important” deviations are considered to be unlikely to have affected the efficacy analyses.

The majority of patients in each treatment group were randomised to study treatment ≤8 weeks after 
completing their last platinum-containing therapy. Eight patients were not randomised within 8 weeks of 
completion of platinum (4 were randomised within 9 weeks). 
Patients were randomised into the study a median of 40 days after completing their final platinum 
chemotherapy. They received an average of 3 previous chemotherapy regimens (range 2-11) and 
2.6 previous platinum-containing chemotherapies (range 2-8).

respectively, were still receiving study treatment.  
Twenty-three patients withdrew consent prior to DCO (26 Nov 2012), 21 of whom were censored for OS 
>2 months prior to DCO.

c Three patients received the incorrect study treatment for a short period due to a dispensing error. One Patient  
(olaparib group) received 1 bottle of placebo between Cycle 3 and Cycle 4 resulting in an olaparib dose interruption of 
approximately 1 week. No new AEs were reported for this patient between the Cycle 3 and Cycle 4. One Patient  
(olaparib group) received 2 bottles of placebo between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 resulting in an olaparib dose interruption of 
approximately 2 weeks. Between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, the patient had an SAE of Grade 3 syncope (Day 48) whilst 
potentially receiving placebo. This AE was counted in the olaparib safety analysis set. One Patient  (placebo group) 
received 2 bottles of olaparib between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 and, therefore, took the equivalent of olaparib 400 mg bd 
for approximately 2 weeks. Between Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, the patient had a non-serious AE of CTCAE Grade 3 fatigue 
(Day 56) while potentially receiving olaparib. This AE was counted in the placebo safety analysis set but the possibility 
that it was attributable to olaparib cannot be excluded.

from the study) without receiving treatment.

Note: Three patients were classified as BRCAwt in their tumours whilst having a mutant classification in their germline. 
These 3 discrepancies were considered to be false negatives as the changes present in the blood samples were present 
in the tumour sample but the detection threshold used in the tumour assay was not reached.

There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups (Odds ratio 1.17, p=0.65). 
The main analysis of HRQoL was based on the Trial Outcomes Index (TOI), which is one of the scores 
derived from the FACT-O, and includes a summary of physical well-being, functional well-being, and 
ovarian cancer additional concern scores. The compliance rate across all time points was approximately 
70% in each treatment group.

Of patients randomised to olaparib, 84 (78.5%) received subsequent cancer therapy following disease 
progression; correspondingly 108 patients randomised to placebo (87.8%) received subsequent therapy. 
Over one third of eligible patients received 3 subsequent therapies (35.5% of the olaparib group and 
43.1% of the placebo group) and approximately 11% of patients received 5 or more subsequent lines of 
treatment (9.3% of the olaparib group and 12.2% of the placebo group). 
The most commonly reported treatments included those containing platinum or doxorubicin or topotecan. 
Sixteen patients in the placebo arm compared to zero patients in the olaparib arm received a PARP 
inhibitor as a subsequent therapy in the overall population. Approximately a quarter of placebo treated 
patients in the BRCA mutated subgroup (14/62; 22.6%) received a subsequent PARP inhibitor. 
Subgroup analyses 
This section presents analyses of data from patients with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, and over all the 
subgroups defined by the stratification factors plus BRCA status.

The analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model with factors for treatment (olaparib vs. placebo), 
time to disease progression (>6-12 months and >12 months, in the penultimate platinum therapy prior to enrolment), 
objective response (CR or PR, in the last platinum therapy prior to enrolment), and Jewish descent (yes or no).

The BRCAm subgroup showed a differential benefit to the FAS (a global interaction test including 
treatment by covariate [including BRCA status] interaction terms was reported as p=0.146). Adding the 
above RECIST and covariate correction including the additional gBRCA CRF data the fully corrected 
p-value was 0.09. 
A global interaction test of PFS was performed when germline and/or tumour BRCA status was known for 
96% of the study population and although not significant (p=0.142), the BRCA status by treatment 
interaction was found to be a significant quantitative interaction (p=0.025).

Ancillary analysis 
In Study 19, of the 136 patients known from germline and/or tumour testing to have a BRCA mutation, 18 
patients were identified with a BRCA mutation in the tumour in the absence of a mutation being identified 
in the germline (somatic BRCA mutation). For ten patients, complete analysis of the BRCA genome, using 
the Integrated BRACAnalysis assay, was conducted and the mutation detected in the tumour was known 
not to be detected in the germline. Based on the mutations identified in the tumour sample from these 10 
patients, there was no reason to believe that the Integrated BRACAnalysis test would not have detected 
them if they were present in the germline sample (9 mutations in the coding sequence and 1 large 
deletion). For eight patients, germline testing was carried out at local laboratories in accordance with 
usual clinical practice and the patients were considered not to be BRCA mutated. The details of the local 
testing procedures used are not known thus it cannot be ruled out if the germline mutation was not 
detected due to incomplete screening of the BRCA genes by the local laboratory. These 18 patients were 
included in the BRCA mutated group of 136 patients in total. 
The limited data for the somatic tumour BRCA (sBRCA) mutated patients showed that fewer patients on 
olaparib reported progression events or death events compared with placebo.

In the original analysis, the primary variable of 
PFS was derived based on investigator 
assessments recorded on the CRFs. The study 
protocol required radiological examinations to 
be retained at the study sites in order to allow 
a blinded independent central review if 
required. 
A retrospective blinded independent central 
review of scans was performed as a sensitivity 
analysis to confirm the robustness of the 
original primary PFS analysis.

Design 
This was a Phase II open-label, randomised, comparative, multicentre study in patients with advanced 
platinum-sensitive (disease progression >6 months after completion of their last platinum regimen) 
serous ovarian cancer who had received no more than 3 previous platinum-containing regimens. Patients 
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups, each of which comprised 2 phases. - Group A 
(“O/C4/P”; n=81): combination phase – olaparib (200 mg bd on days 1-10 of a 21-day cycle) in 
combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (AUC4) for 6 cycles; maintenance phase – olaparib 
monotherapy (400 mg bd). 
- Group B (“C6/P”; n=81): combination phase – paclitaxel and carboplatin (AUC6) for 6 cycles; post 
completion (maintenance phase) – no treatment was administered.  
Figure 8: Overview of study 41 design 
a Upon completion of Cycle 6 (ie, 21 days after last dose of chemotherapy), patients randomised to the O/C4/P arm 
(Arm  A)  were  to  continue  to  receive  olaparib  at  the  maintenance  dose  of  400  mg  bd  continuously.  Patients  who 
prematurely discontinued the combination of O/C4/P were permitted to participate in the olaparib maintenance phase 
as long as they had completed at least 4 cycles of study treatment in the combination phase and had not received any 
other  anti-cancer  therapy  between  completion  of  the  combination  phase  and  commencing  olaparib  maintenance. 
Patients randomised to O/C4/P who had not completed at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy were to receive no further 
study treatment, and other treatment options were at the discretion of the investigator. 
b  Following  confirmed objective  disease progression  as per  RECIST  criteria,  patients  continued  to  be  contacted  to 
assess survival status until final analysis of OS and to collect subsequent cancer therapy details including best response 
(unless patient withdrew consent).

Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of olaparib in combination with paclitaxel and 
carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone, as assessed by PFS (blinded independent central 
review). 
Key secondary objectives included OS, percentage change in tumour size, ORR, CA-125 and/or RECIST 
response, CA-125 response rate, safety and tolerability. 
Retrospective exploratory analyses (including TSST) were conducted in the overall population and by 
BRCA mutation status. An analysis of efficacy by BRCA mutation status was pre-specified in the SAP that 
was finalised prior to unblinding of the data for primary analysis. 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria 
Key inclusion criteria included: 
• Aged ≥18 years of age (patients in Japan were to be ≥20 years old). 
• Histologically or cytologically diagnosed ovarian cancer with a serous histology or serous component, 
including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer. 
Patients who had received no more than 3 previous platinum-containing regimens and were progression 
free, in the opinion of the investigator, for a minimum of 6 months following completion of their last 
platinum-containing regimen, prior to randomisation in the study. 
• At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that could be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in 
the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which had to have short axis ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI and 
which was suitable for accurate repeated measurements. 
• ECOG PS ≤2 
Key exclusion criteria included: 
• Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitors including olaparib. 
• Patients with second primary cancer, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively 
treated in situ cancer of the cervix, DCIS, Stage 1 Grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, or other solid tumours 
including lymphomas (without bone marrow involvement) curatively treated with no evidence of disease 
for ≥5 years. 
• Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary outcome variable, PFS, was based on the blinded independent central review of RECIST v1.1 
data. Stratified log-rank test with strata defined for the number of prior platinum-containing treatment 
line (1 or >1) and time to disease progression or death following previous platinum-containing therapy 
(>6 to ≤12 months versus >12 months) were used for PFS and OS.

Study D0810C00020 
This was a Phase II, Open Label, Non-Randomised Study of AZD2281 in the Treatment of Patients with 
Known BRCA or Recurrent High Grade Serous/Undifferentiated Tubo-Ovarian Carcinoma and in Known 
BRCA or Triple Negative Breast Cancer to Determine Response Rate and Correlative Markers of Response 
Patients were enrolled into 4 study cohorts: 
1) triple negative breast cancer with unknown gBRCA mutation status; 
2) known gBRCA mutated breast cancer; 
3) high-grade serous/undifferentiated tubo-ovarian carcinoma with unknown gBRCA mutation status; 
4) known gBRCA mutated ovarian cancer. 
All patients received olaparib 400 mg bd until disease progression or until the investigator believed it was 
in the best interest of the patient to stop treatment. Patients with unknown gBRCA status at entry had to 
provide a DNA sample for gBRCA mutation analysis. Data are summarised primarily by confirmed 
mutation status and tumour type determined from the study data, not the groups defined for study entry. 
The primary objective was to determine ORR as evaluated according to RECIST guidelines. 
The key secondary objectives included identification of markers of olaparib efficacy through analysis of 
tumour material; investigation of PFS in patients treated with olaparib; assessment of the safety and 
tolerability profile of olaparib.  
The total study population comprised 91 women (enrolled from 6 centres in Canada), including 65 
patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed ovarian cancer (58 serous and 7 non-serous); 13/58 
serous and 4/7 non-serous ovarian patients were gBRCA mutation carriers. Mean age for the patients with 
ovarian cancer was 59.4 years (range 39 to 84 years). Patients were heavily pre-treated; 37 patients with 
ovarian cancer had received 3 or more prior chemotherapy treatments. In total, 64/65 ovarian cancer 
patients received olaparib, and were included in the safety analysis set. Of the 26 breast cancer patients 
who received treatment with olaparib, 24 patients were considered to have completed the study. 
Ovarian cancer: ORR for all patients with ovarian cancer was 29% (18/63 patients had responses; 95% 
CI 18.90%, 40.70%). Within this overall group, the ORR in ovarian cancer patients who were gBRCA 
mutation carriers was numerically greater than in those who did not harbour a gBRCA mutation (ORR 
41% [7/17 patients had responses; 95% CI 21.6%, 64.0%] versus 24% [11/46 patients had responses; 
95% CI 13.9%, 37.9%], respectively). Secondary efficacy analyses in patients with ovarian cancer: 
overall disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]) at 16 weeks was 48% (95% CI 37% to 60%); 
median duration of response was 277 days; median best percentage change from baseline in tumour size 
was a 14.2% reduction; median PFS as determined by RECIST criteria was

219 days (95% CI 110 to 273 days). In addition, of 54 patients with ovarian cancer who were evaluable 
for CA-125 response, 13 (24.1%) had a complete response and 4 (7.4%) had a partial response; overall 
response rate was 31% (95% CI 21% to 45%) and median best change from baseline in CA-125 was a 
38.5% reduction. Overall, 23/64 (35.9%) ovarian cancer patients had either a RECIST or a CA-125 
response. Median PFS for the ovarian cancer patients overall, determined by either RECIST or CA-125 
response, was 108 days (95% CI 55 to 220 days). 
Study D0810C00042 
This was a Phase II, Open-Label, Non-Randomised, Non-Comparative, Multicentre Study to Assess the 
Efficacy and Safety of Olaparib Given Orally Twice Daily in Patients With Advanced Cancers Who Have A 
Confirmed Genetic BRCA1 And/Or BRCA2 Mutation. 
This was a single-arm, open-label study. After starting treatment with olaparib 400 mg bd orally, patients 
attended periodic clinic visits for assessment of safety and efficacy until confirmed objective disease 
progression occurred according to RECIST v1.1. Following confirmed disease progression, patients 
discontinued olaparib treatment but could receive any other cancer treatment at the investigator’s 
discretion. 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of oral olaparib in patients with advanced cancer who had 
a confirmed germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation by assessment of tumour response. 
Key secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of oral olaparib in patients with advanced cancers 
who had a confirmed germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation, by assessment of objective response rate, 
progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response and disease control rate, as well as to 
determine the safety and tolerability of oral olaparib in patients with advanced cancers who had a 
confirmed germline BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation. 
A total of 298 patients (62 breast cancer patients, 193 ovarian cancer patients, 23 pancreatic cancer 
patients, 8 prostate cancer patients, and 12 patients with another type of cancer) received olaparib at 13 
sites in 6 countries (Israel, USA, Australia, Germany, Spain, and Sweden). All 298 patients were included 
in the safety analysis set. Patients were ≥18 years of age with histologically and/or cytologically 
confirmed malignant solid tumours that were refractory to standard therapy and for which no suitable, 
effective/curative therapy existed. Patients had to have a confirmed documented deleterious or 
suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation. The demographic characteristics of this heavily pre-treated 
advanced disease study population were generally representative of each tumour type, independent of 
gBRCA status. Seventy-three (24.5%) patients had received at least 3 regimens of previous 
chemotherapy prior to study entry. A total of 151 (50.6%) patients had 4 or more chemotherapy 
regimens. 
A total of 78/298 (26.2%) patients experienced a complete or partial tumour response in this study. 
Responses were observed in all tumour type categories: 8/62 (12.9%) breast cancer patients, 60/193 
(31.1%) ovarian cancer patients, 5/23 (21.7%) pancreatic cancer patients, 4/8 (50%) prostate cancer 
patients and 1/12 (8.3%) patients with other cancer types. 
The overall median duration of response from onset of response was 208 days; 204 days in the breast 
cancer group, 225 days in the ovarian cancer group, 134 days in the pancreatic cancer group, 326.5 days 
in the prostate cancer group, and 165 days in the other cancer group. At 16 weeks, disease control was 
observed in 155 (52%) patients in the study; 23 (37.1%) in the breast cancer group, 112 (58%) in the 
ovarian cancer group, 11 (47.8%) in the pancreatic cancer group, 5 (62.5%) in the prostate cancer 
group, and 4 (33.3%) in the other cancer group.

The proportion of patients who were progression free at 6 months was 29% in the breast cancer group, 
54.6% in the ovarian cancer group, 36.4% in the pancreatic cancer group, and 62.5% in the prostate 
cancer group. The proportion of patients who were alive at 12 months was 44.7% in the breast cancer 
group, 64.4% in the ovarian cancer group, 40.9% in the pancreatic cancer group, and 50% in the 
prostate cancer group.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
At the time of the study 19, there were no therapeutic agents approved for maintenance treatment of 
ovarian cancer after a response to platinum-containing regimens and no standard treatment after 
standard platinum based chemotherapy was clearly defined. In this context, using placebo as comparator 
to determine the efficacy of olaparib was considered acceptable. 
Study 19 enrolled patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Patients with low grade ovarian 
carcinoma (grade 1) were excluded from the study. High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) are 
known to be enriched for defects in an essential DNA damage repair pathway called homologous 
recombination (Bowtell 2010). In the absence of any convincing clinical efficacy/safety data in other 
histological types than ‘high grade serous’, the indication is restricted to patients with high grade serous 
ovarian cancer (excluding grade 1 based on the investigators/pathologists’ assessment) (see section 4.1 
of the SmPC). 
The study was performed in serous ovarian cancer patients with partially platinum-sensitive disease 
(platinum-free interval of 6 to 12 months) and platinum-sensitive disease (platinum-free interval of > 12 
months) who had received 2 or more previous platinum-containing regimens. The last chemotherapy 
course must have consisted of a minimum of 4 treatment cycles, although complete standard platinum 
based chemotherapy patients is at least 6 cycles. However, across both arms, the majority of patients 
received 6 or more cycles of platinum immediately prior to randomisation. Therefore, it can be assumed 
that chemotherapy received immediately prior to randomisation was given according to standard clinical 
practice in both arms and that there was no under treatment that would have favoured the experimental 
arm.  
Platinum sensitivity was defined as disease progression greater than 6 months after completion of their 
penultimate platinum regimen (from last dose) prior to enrolling on this study. In the last platinum 
regimen prior to enrolling on this study, patients had to demonstrate an objective stable maintained 
response (CR [complete response] or PR [partial response]) and this response had to be maintained to 
allow entry to the study. The assessment of response (PR or CR) to platinum as described in the proposed 
indication prior to initiation of olaparib maintenance therapy should be confirmed as per RECIST and/or as 
per CA-125 criteria as defined by Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) (at least a 50% reduction in 
CA-125 levels from the last pre-treatment sample, confirmed 28 days later) following completion of two 
or more previous platinum containing chemotherapy (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Patients with stable disease (SD) following platinum-based chemotherapy were not included in the pivotal 
maintenance Study 19.  Additional studies are needed to support efficacy of olaparib for maintenance in 
patients with stable disease following platinum-based chemotherapy. At this time, this population could 
not be included in the scope of the indication. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 126/187 
  
  
The primary endpoint was PFS although it was highlighted in the protocol assistance that overall survival 
(OS) is in general preferred as primary endpoint. However, the CHMP agreed that different subsequent 
therapies are expected to confound OS data making difficult the interpretation of the OS data. A final OS 
analysis for study 19 will be conducted at 85% maturity of the overall population (75% maturity 
estimated for the BRCA mutated population) will be provided by the Applicant as an Annex II condition.  
Knowledge of BRCA mutation status prior to study entry was not mandated, as it was considered by the 
Applicant that the population of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer would 
already be suitably enriched for HRD tumours. Neither primary nor secondary objectives were planned in 
the BRCA subgroup. Patients were classified as BRCA mutated by virtue of having BRCA mutated status 
in either their blood or tumour sample, although both copies of the BRCA gene must be altered/mutated 
before an individual will develop cancer. At the time of the final PFS analysis and first interim OS analysis 
(38% maturity), gBRCA mutation status was known for only a small subset of patients (97/265; 36.6%). 
Final BRCA status was determined, mostly retrospectively, for almost all patients. 
Based on the efficacy data obtained from study 19 (see efficacy data below) in patients with BRCA 
mutation detected in either the germline or the tumour and considering that data from studies 19 and 41 
showed that, when mutations are detected in the germline these mutations are also present in the tumour 
tissue (although there was a false negative rate associated with the detection of single exon indels), it is 
considered that patients are eligible for olaparib treatment if they have a confirmed deleterious or 
suspected deleterious BRCA mutation (i.e., a mutation that disrupts normal gene function) in either the 
germline or the tumour (detected using an appropriately validated test) (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-response studies 
Study 09 assessed the efficacy of olaparib when dosed at 100 mg bd and 400 mg bd. Activity was seen at 
the lower dose and some of these responses were durable, but there was a numerical advantage for the 
higher dose. Study 12 investigated the efficacy of olaparib 200 mg bd, olaparib 400 mg bd and PLD, 
showing a slight numerical advantage of olaparib 400 mg bd compared to treatment with olaparib 200 mg 
without any statistically significant difference between the groups. Pharmacodynamic data did not 
evidence a relationship between the magnitude of effect and the dose administered. Furthermore, neither 
study 09 nor study 12 provided statistically significant difference between the different investigated 
doses. Higher numbers (%) of patients with most common AEs (any grade and at least grade 3) were 
observed in patients receiving 400 mg bid versus 200 mg bid. However, the efficacy and tolerability of a 
lower starting dose (i.e. 200 mg bd) has not been studied in the maintenance treatment setting. In 
addition, the safety profile of the 400 mg bd capsule dose in the maintenance treatment setting is 
consistent with that observed in the larger monotherapy pool of patients who have received this dose and 
is considered to be acceptable (see clinical safety). Therefore, the proposed dose of 400 mg bd was 
considered acceptable. 
Pivotal study 
The study 19 met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved PFS for olaparib maintenance 
monotherapy compared with placebo in the overall population (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.25 0.49; p<0.00001), 
moreover, pre planned subgroup analysis by BRCA mutation status identified patients with BRCA mutated 
ovarian cancer (n=136, 51.3%) as the subgroup that derived the greatest clinical benefit from olaparib 
maintenance monotherapy (see SmPC section 5.1).   
The benefit on PFS was partly maintained at second progression. No negative effects on subsequent lines 
of therapy were observed with favourable TSST in the overall population (HR of 0.53, p<0.0001, medians 
14.8 and 19.1 months) used as a surrogate for PFS2.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 127/187 
  
  
At the time of interim OS analyses at 58% maturity of the overall population, there was no evidence of a 
detrimental effect in OS in the olaparib treated patients. The OS survival data were not yet sufficiently 
mature to allow comparison between two groups. The final OS survival analysis will be done at 85% 
maturity (after 226 deaths) (see Annex II conditions). 
In addition, the observed benefit of olaparib in patients with BRCA mutated ovarian cancer will be further 
defined in the ongoing SOLO-2 study, a randomised (2:1) phase III study in 264 patients (see Annex II 
conditions). SOLO-2 will also allow a prospective validation of ‘BRCA mutated’ biomarker. 
No statistically significant differences were observed between olaparib and placebo in patient reported 
symptoms or HRQoL as measured by improvement and worsening rates in the FACT/NCCN Ovarian 
Symptom Index (FOSI), Trial Outcome Index (TOI) and Functional Analysis of Cancer Therapy–Ovarian 
total score (FACT O total) (see SmPC section 5.1). Although quality of life results did not show significant 
differences between groups, additional data will be provided from the ongoing confirmatory phase III 
study SOLO-2 (D0816C00002) (see above). 
There are no data on retreatment with Lynparza following subsequent relapse (see SmPC section 4.2 and 
5.1).  
The indication claimed was limited to ‘BRCA mutated’ tumours (due to germline and somatic BRCA 
mutations). The choice of this subgroup (51% of patients) was considered a priori acceptable as it was 
based on a biological rationale. 
In BRCA-mutated patients (n=136) there was a statistically significant improvement in PFS, TFST, and 
TSST. The median PFS improvement was 6.9 months over placebo for olaparib treated patients (HR 0.18; 
95% CI 0.10 0.31; p<0.00001; median 11.2 months versus 4.3 months). The investigator assessment of 
PFS was consistent with a blinded independent central radiological review of PFS. The time from 
randomisation to start of first subsequent therapy or death (TFST) was 9.4 months longer for olaparib 
treated patients (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.22–0.50; p<0.00001; median 15.6 months versus 6.2 months). The 
time from randomisation to start of second subsequent therapy or death (TSST) was 8.6 months longer 
for olaparib treated patients (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.29 0.67; p=0.00013; median 23.8 months versus 15.2 
months. There was no statistically significant difference in OS (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.45 1.17; p=0.19; 
median 34.9 months versus 31.9 months). Within the BRCA mutated population the disease control rate 
at 24 weeks was 57% and 24% for patients in the olaparib and placebo groups, respectively (see SmPC 
section 5.1). Therefore, a clinically relevant benefit was demonstrated for this group of patients. 
In the ‘BRCA wildtype/VUS” group (non-‘BRCA mutated’ patients) a progression-free survival hazard ratio 
of 0.54 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34, 0.85; p=0.00745) was observed.  
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG was consulted on the availability of biomarkers to better define olaparib-sensitive patient 
population and on whether a trial could confirm hypotheses on efficacy in the groups of BRCA mutated 
and BRCA wild-type population. In relation to BRCA mutated population (BRCA1 and BRCA2), the SAG 
condisered that in view of the current state of knowledge that there was no better validated biomarker 
method available than the detection of BRCA mutation (somatic and germline) by gene sequencing 
although there are other mechanisms involved in DNA repair. BRCA mutation detected by gene 
sequencing was considered a valid and predictive marker to identify patients that could benefit from 
olaparib. However, the SAG was uncertain about the true effect of olaparib in this patient population due 
to the shortcomings of the pivotal study being a small phase II randomised study with a large percentage 
of censored observations for PFS analysis, and in view of the absence of improvement in overall survival. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 128/187 
  
  
In relation to BRCA wild-type population, there is currently no validated, robust and routinely applicable 
test available to identify patients who will likely respond or may not respond to olaparib. In order to allow 
identification of olaparib-sensitive patients in this population, the SAG considered that a prospective 
randomised trial was necessary and should be based on adequate molecular identification of sensitive 
tumours. This prospective study should be of sufficient size and investigate other genes that might 
influence DNA-repair processes, especially homologous recombination repair (HRR). In view of the 
genetic variability of tumours with somatic mutation, tumours samples should be preferably taken both in 
primary and relapse tissues. In addition, tumour sensitivity upon platinum treatment was not considered 
an adequate criterion to select patients who may respond to PARP inhibitors as it may induce reversion of 
BRCA mutations and clinically tumour sensitivity to platinum-treatment is difficult to assess 
unambiguously. 
Extended sample analysis of study 19 was also not expected to generate convincing data to properly 
identify patients who will likely respond to olaparib. However, robust exploratory and validation strategies 
can be put in place using this data set to generate hypotheses that may support future prospective 
studies, or confirm outcome of other biomarker driven prospective studies. 
The SAG discussed the feasibility of a post-approval prospective study. In relation to BRCA mutated 
patient population, a confirmatory phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre 
study to assess the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance monotherapy in patients with BRCAm platinum 
sensitive relapsed (PSR) high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) (SOLO-2) is ongoing and it is 
foreseen that enrolment of the last patient will occur in 2015. The outcome of this study is expected to 
provide further evidence on the safety and efficacy of olaparib in the BRCA mutated patient population 
and the marketing authorisation of olaparib in this patient population is not expected to hamper the 
conduct of this trial. 
Regarding BRCA wild type population, the SAG considered that the sample size of the study proposed by 
the Applicant was too small and has serious concerns about the external validity of the study in view of the 
suspected high biological heterogeneity of tumours in this patient population. A large phase 3 trial in 
patient with high grade serous might be considered appropriate but marketing authorisation of olaparib 
for this indication would seriously hamper successful execution of such a study. Retrospective molecular 
analysis of tumours from patients in this study might allow the identification of specific genes involved in 
DNA repair to be identified as biomarkers for response to olaparib. 
Considering the shortcomings of study 19 and the less convincing PFS results in the wild type population, 
the inclusion of BRCA wild type patients in the indication could be of concern in view of uncertainty about 
long term safety and the resulting overall benefit-risk balance.  
The SAG also discussed extrapolation of efficacy/safety results from germline to somatic "BRCA mutated" 
ovarian cancer patients. If proven to be pathological mutations, the SAG expected that olaparib will have 
similar activity/biological effect in tumours with somatic mutations to the activity in tumours with 
germline mutations.  
However, the SAG was concerned about extrapolation in terms of the magnitude of the effect in view of 
potential differences in biological composition such as higher level of heterogeneity and degree of 
genomic instability in tumours with somatic mutations versus tumours with germline mutations. In view 
of the limited data available, additional evidence in somatic BRCA mutated patients would be of value. 
Based on available data and taking into account the SAG view, the CHMP considered the detection of 
BRCA mutation (somatic and germline) by gene sequencing was a biomarker of significant clinical value 
for selection of patients given an apparent and clinically significant PFS benefit in the whole 
‘BRCA-mutated’ group and current unavailability of biomarkers that could better predict responses in 
patients. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 129/187 
  
  
In the study 19, the BRCA mutation status based on local testing was known at study entry for 37% of 
patients (36% in the olaparib group and 37% in the placebo group). Further germline or tumor status was 
studied retrospectively for 60% and 79%, respectively. The composite nature of biomarker ‘BRCA 
mutated’ was discussed as it comprised: (1) BRCA testing based on CRF data for germline mutation 
testing (blood-based tests); (2) BRCA testing of germline mutations by next generation sequencing 
(NGS) technology; (3) BRCA testing of mutations in tumors by NGS. While PFS HRs were similar 
irrespective of BRCA tests used in BRCAm group of patients (0.10; 0.15; 0.16, respectively), a slightly 
lower HR was noticed for local testing. In the context of current changes in technologies in practice for 
detection of germline BRCA mutations a spectrum of mutations could be different and, consequently, 
more heterogeneous population than that tested in clinical trials could become eligible for the treatment 
with olaparib (Norquist et al, 2013). Depending on types of mutations determined, the responses of 
patients might differ. Currently there is no evidence of such differential activity of olaparib. However, at 
the time of the Study 19 start, patients that were clinically selected for genetic testing and counselling 
might represent a higher proportion of the study patient population, than it would be in currently ongoing 
studies and in clinical practice in the future. The phase IV study in patients with relapsed platinum 
sensitive ovarian cancer who are in complete or partial response following platinum based chemotherapy 
and who carry loss of function germline or somatic BRCA mutation(s) will provide further information 
addressing this uncertainty (see Annex II conditions).  
The Applicant is also planning to conduct a randomised Phase III study in patients with somatic BRCA 
mutated ovarian cancer (study SOLOIST) and is recommended to share the results when available.  
Although grouping of patients with germline BRCA mutations and patients harbouring somatic BRCA 
mutations was acceptable on the basis of biological rationale, it was nevertheless questioned from clinical 
perspective, since patients with germline BRCA mutations (BRCA1 and BRCA2) constitute clinically 
distinct groups, with age differences and differences in survival rates. It is currently not clear whether 
differences in outcomes between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated cancers would be observed in patients with 
somatic BRCA mutations. The Applicant is recommended to further investigate the prognostic and 
predictive value of tests that would allow quantitative assessment of genomic instability and homologous 
recombination deficiencies in patients with specific mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 and other HRR-related 
genes. The Applicant is also recommended to assess efficacy and safety of olaparib in patients with large 
genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. 
In addition, for patients with sBRCAm, only few data are currently available even though consistent 
results were observed. In addition, whether these patients can be considered as truly somatic remain 
uncertain since 8 of 18 patients were considered as germline BRCA wildtype based on local testing, which 
might miss detection of germline BRCA mutation depending on testing method. Among 37 patients 
categorised as long term responders (defined as patients on treatment for >2 years) in Study 19, 3 
patients were defined as patients with somatic BRCA mutations and 2 of them were treated with olaparib.  
Therefore, the CHMP considered that further efficacy data in patients with sBRCA mutation should be 
provided as Annex II condition. 
As to intra-tumor heterogeneity, the available data are still limited and were provided using experimental 
DNA-based methodology. DNA-based approach used by the Applicant was confined to a single, archival 
tumour samples per patient and so does not inform about temporal and inter-lesional variation. The 
Applicant is recommended to investigate tumour heterogeneity and mechanisms of resistance in patients 
with BRCA-mutated tumours and tumours harbouring mutations in HRR-related genes. 
No studies have been conducted in paediatric patients and the efficacy of olaparib in children and 
adolescents has not been established (see SmPC section 4.2).

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study 19 provided initial and clinically significant evidence of PFS benefit in patients 
harbouring BRCA-mutated tumors (germline and/or somatic mutations). The definition of this group was 
based on several biomarkers defined overall as ‘BRCA mutation’, some of which were used 
retrospectively. A prospective validation of a biomarker ‘BRCA mutation’ will be provided by the SOLO-2 
study (D0816C00002). The results of this study will substantiate the assessment of efficacy results 
reported by the study 19. Further efficacy data will verify the impact of the olaparib on several clinical 
outcomes relevant to assessment of efficacy in maintenance setting. A more comprehensive analysis of 
quality of life will allow to substantiate an observed benefit, while further understanding of mechanisms 
of resistance due to optional collection of samples post-progression performed in SOLO-2 study will allow 
to address potential uncertainties pertaining to long-term benefit. 
The OS data performed at 58% maturity (52% for BRCA mutated group) did not show statistically 
significant differences between olaparib-treated and placebo-treated patients. To further address efficacy 
at long term, the final OS analysis will be provided and will occur at 85% of maturity for overall study 
population (at 75% for BRCA mutated population). 
There are limited data in patients with somatic BRCA mutations (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
However, activity similar to that in patients with germline BRCA mutations is expected based on strong 
biological rationale. In addition, available clinical data indicate efficacy of olaparib in patients with somatic 
BRCA mutations. Nevertheless, clinical data need to be further acquired in these patients. Therefore, it is 
requested to address uncertainties mainly with respect to efficacy of olaparib in this subpopulation of 
patients within the overall group of patients with ‘BRCA-mutated’ tumors. An open-label phase IV study 
will provide further clinical data in patients harbouring tumors with somatic BRCA mutations.  
Therefore, the CHMP considers the following measures (PAES) necessary to address issues related to 
efficacy: 
• 
• 
• 
In order to further define the long term efficacy of olaparib in patients with platinum sensitive 
relapsed BRCA mutated high grade serous ovarian cancer, the MAH should submit the final 
Overall Survival (OS) analysis of D0810C00019, a phase II randomised, double blind, multicentre 
study. 
In order to further confirm the observed efficacy of olaparib in patients with platinum sensitive 
relapsed BRCA mutated high grade serous ovarian cancer, the MAH should submit the results of 
study D0816C00002 (SOLO-2), a phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled 
multicentre study.  
In order to further define the efficacy of olaparib in the subpopulation of patients with platinum 
sensitive relapsed somatic BRCA mutated high grade serous ovarian cancer, the MAH should 
conduct and submit the results of a phase IV, open label, single arm, non-randomised, 
multicentre study in patients with relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer who are in complete 
or partial response following platinum based chemotherapy and who carry loss of function 
germline or somatic BRCA mutation(s). 
The MAH is required to provide the final CSRs (see Annex II) and interim reports in line with the RMP (see 
section 2.8). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Across the entire clinical programme, as of 20 May 2013, an estimated 2034 patients with ovarian, 
breast, pancreatic, gastric or a variety of other solid tumours have received treatment with olaparib 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 131/187 
  
  
across the dose range 10 mg once daily (od) to 600 mg bd in Applicant-sponsored, 
investigator-sponsored, and collaborative group studies. Olaparib has been given as either monotherapy 
(15 studies, an estimated 1162 patients) or in combination with other chemotherapy/anti-cancer agents 
(23 studies, an estimated 872 patients). Many of these combination studies are ongoing. 
The safety data summarised in the dossier are primarily from 801 olaparib-treated patients from the 
Applicant-sponsored studies where olaparib was administered as a monotherapy at a dose of 400 mg bd 
(capsules) (see Table 55).  
Patient exposure 
The data from patients treated with olaparib in pivotal Study 19 were pooled with the data from patients 
receiving olaparib 400 mg bd in other monotherapy studies for the treatment of a range of tumour types, 
including ovarian cancer and BRCA-mutated cancers, providing a larger source of safety information 
(n=735).

Patient numbers are derived from individual CSRs. 
a  Patients  were  included  in  the  monotherapy  pooled  dataset  if  their  first  dose  on  study  was  olaparib  400  mg  bd 
capsule.  In  Study  12,  patients  who  crossed  over  from  liposomal  doxorubicin  to  olaparib  400  mg  bd  were  also 
included. In Study 24, patients were included if their first dose was olaparib 400 mg bd capsule; those who took 
olaparib 400 mg bd tablet first were excluded, even if they took 400 mg bd capsule at a later date 
b   In the CSR for Study 2, 6 patients are stated as having BRCAm ovarian cancer; however this includes a patient with 
a tumour location of ‘other female genital’ and this patient has not been included in the BRCAm ovarian cancer 
subgroup of the monotherapy pool.  
c   N=55 comprises 32 patients who started on olaparib 400 mg bd and 23 patients who crossed over from  doxorubicin 
to olaparib 400 mg bd. There were 2 patients who, after crossing over from doxorubicin, did   not actually receive 
olaparib.   
d   Study 12 was performed in patients with BRCAm ovarian cancer; however, 1 patient has been excluded from the 
BRCAm ovarian cancer subgroup of the monotherapy pool as no tumour location was recorded.

The maximum follow-up in the olaparib arm was 1344 days (approximately 3 years and 8 months), based 
on the study Data Cut-Off (DTO) of 26 November 2012. A safety update of Study 19 was conducted with 
a DCO of 31 January 2014. The maximum follow-up in the olaparib arm as of 31 January 2014 was 1764 
days (approximately 4 years and 10 months). With this increased follow up period, the number of patients 
remaining on treatment in Study 19 decreased from 26 (23 on the olaparib arm and 3 on the placebo arm) 
to 20 (19 on the olaparib arm and 1 on the placebo arm) of which 6 olaparib treated patients and the 1 
placebo patient were gBRCAm. The median total treatment duration in Study 19 has not changed since 
the study DCO of 26 November 2012.

Key demographic and baseline characteristics 
The majority of patients in the pooled dataset (508/735) had ovarian cancer (including ‘ovarian’, ‘primary 
peritoneal’, ‘peritoneum’, and ‘fallopian tubes’). Patients with other advanced solid tumours, including 
breast (n=140), colorectal (n=37), pancreas (n=24) or prostate (n=8) cancers were also treated in these 
studies. Patients were also being treated for different stages of their disease. With the exception of Study 
19 where olaparib was administered in the maintenance setting to responding patients, the treatment 
setting was as a late line of therapy to patients with relapsed, progressive disease. 
Key demographic and baseline characteristics for the 7 studies contributing the majority (96%) of 
patients to the pooled data set are presented below. The majority of patients had ovarian cancer. Overall, 
the demographic characteristics of patients (age, race and ECOG PS) were globally similar across studies.

In Study 41 (maintenance phase), more patients had at least one AE reported in the olaparib arm 
(97.0%) compared with the no treatment (Post C6/P) arm (78.2%). There were more patients with AEs 
of CTCAE grade ≥3 reported in the olaparib arm (31.8%) versus the no treatment arm (16.4%). The 
percentage of patients reported with an SAE was similar in the olaparib and no treatment arms (10.6% 
and 7.3%, respectively). In olaparib arm, 7 patients (10.6%) had an AE leading to discontinuation of 
olaparib reported and 1 patient had an AE with outcome=death.

Table 69: Number (%) of patients with the most common AEs of CTCAE grade 3 or higher (reported in 
≥2% patients in either group [All patients]): Study 19, Safety Analysis Set 
Patients with multiple AEs of CTCAE grade 3 or higher are counted once for each system organ class/preferred term. 
Data sorted alphabetically by system organ class and preferred term. 
Includes AEs with an onset date between the date of first dose and 30 days following the date of last dose of study 
treatment 
The time to first onset for CTCAE grade ≥3 AEs was assessed for the olaparib arm of Study 19 using a 
cumulative incidence plot. Most grade 3 and higher events occurred during the first 6 months of 
treatment, with the total incidence reaching approximately 40% during the study. 
In study 41, the majority of AEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity. Adverse events of CTCAE grade ≥3 
were reported in more patients in the olaparib arm (21 [31.8%]) than in the no treatment arm (9 
[16.4%]). The most common CTCAE grade ≥3 events reported in the olaparib arm were haematological 
and were anaemia (6 [9.1%] patients) and neutropenia (3 [4.5%] patients). There were 2 patients in the 
olaparib arm who had AEs of grade 3 myelodysplastic syndrome reported. All other grade 3/4 AEs were 
reported in 1 patient only in either arm.

Adverse events by organ system or syndrome 
Nausea and vomiting 
In Study 19, the reported incidence was approximately twice as high for olaparib treated patients 
compared to placebo treated patients. Events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 in severity and 
infrequently led to permanent discontinuation of treatment (2 patients, 1 in each arm, discontinued 
treatment due to nausea). Cumulative incidence plots and life table plots of the Study 19 data indicated 
that nausea is reported very early with the probability of having an adverse event of nausea greatest in 
the first month of treatment. Vomiting was generally first reported in the first 3 to 6 months of treatment 
with olaparib with the probability of having an AE of vomiting greatest in the first month of treatment, but 
for some patients the first onset was during the first 6 months.  
Events resolved in the majority of patients, generally whilst continuing treatment with olaparib. In Study 
19 nausea was no longer present in 70/96 (72.9%) of the patients with an event reported and vomiting 
was no longer present in 45/46 (97.8%) of the patients with a reported event at the data cut off. 
Dose reduction and interruptions were used in a small number of patients to manage the events of nausea 
and vomiting in Study 19, with 5.1% patients reporting an AE of nausea that led to a temporary dose 
interruption (8.1% vomiting) and 3.7% required a dose reduction of olaparib treatment for nausea (2.9% 
vomiting). Treatment for nausea was received by 50% patients in the olaparib arm and in 17% patients 
in the placebo arm. Treatment for vomiting was received by 30% olaparib treated patients and 17% of 
placebo treated patients. 
Fatigue (including asthenia) 
In Study 19, 61.8% of olaparib-treated patients and 46.1% of placebo-treated patients reported 
fatigue/asthenia. The events were generally CTCAE grade 1or 2 in severity and did not result in any 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. Cumulative incidence information from Study 19 showed that 
fatigue and asthenia were generally reported early; the majority of olaparib patients who reported events 
of fatigue and asthenia reported the first onset within the first 3 months of treatment. Dose reductions 
and interruptions were used in a small number of patients to manage the events of fatigue and asthenia 
in Study 19, with 4.4% patients receiving olaparib reporting an AE of fatigue that led to a temporary dose 
interruption (1.5% asthenia) and 3.7% required a dose reduction of olaparib treatment for fatigue (2.2% 
asthenia). Fatigue/asthenia was reported at a similar frequency in the 400 mg bd monotherapy pool 
(61.5% of all patients) as in Study 19 (61.8%), and was generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. There was only 
1 SAE in the monotherapy pool, and no AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Anaemia 
In Study 19, anaemia (grouped terms) was reported as an AE in a higher percentage of patients in the 
olaparib arm versus the placebo arm (23.5% vs. 7.0%). The prevalence plot for anaemia indicated that 
at any given time, approximately 5 to 15% of patients were actually experiencing anaemia as an AE. 
Cumulative incidence information in Study 19 showed that anaemia events were generally reported early, 
with the majority of patients reporting events of anaemia having first onset within the first 2 months of 
treatment.  
Anaemia was one of the more common AEs that led to dose interruptions or reductions. Study 19 data 
showed that AEs of anaemia resolved in the majority of olaparib treated patients (20/32) with the AE still 
present in 10/32, and outcome was not recorded for 2/32 patients. 
Anaemia was reported as an AE in a slightly higher proportion of patients in the monotherapy pooled 
dataset compared with Study 19, both overall and for CTCAE grade 3 or higher events. SAEs or AEs 
leading to discontinuation were infrequently reported for anaemia. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 143/187 
  
  
A review of all cases of anaemia resulting in blood transfusions was performed. In the pivotal study, 14 
(10.3%) patients treated with olaparib, needed one or more transfusions during the treatment while one 
patient (0.8%) required transfusions in the placebo group. 
Diarrhoea 
In Study 19, AEs of diarrhoea were reported in a similar percentage of patients in the olaparib and placebo 
arms. Most of the events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity, and none of the events led to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment. One case of diarrhoea in the olaparib arm was reported as being serious. 
Diarrhoea was reported at a similar frequency in the pooled dataset. Although the reporting rate of 
diarrhoea was similar in the olaparib and placebo arms in Study 19, it was considered to be associated 
with olaparib due to findings from other comparative studies in the clinical programme (Study 12 and 
Study 41). In the maintenance phase of the study 41, twice as many patients in the olaparib arm reported 
events of diarrhoea compared to the no treatment arm (12 [18.2%] vs 4 [7.3%]). The majority of the 
events in the olaparib arm were CTCAE grade 1. A dose response relationship was observed in 3 
monotherapy studies where olaparib 100 mg bd or 200 mg bd was compared with 400 mg bd. 
Dyspepsia 
In Study 19, AEs of dyspepsia were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm versus 
the placebo arm. All of these events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity. None of the events were 
reported as being serious and none of the events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Dyspepsia was reported at a similar frequency in the pooled dataset. An assessment of the incidence of 
dyspepsia at other olaparib monotherapy doses showed a dose response relationship in Study 12 and 
Study 8. 
Upper abdominal pain 
In Study 19, AEs of upper abdominal pain were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib 
arm versus the placebo arm. Most of the events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity. None of the events 
were reported as being serious and none of the events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Upper abdominal pain was reported at a lower frequency in the pooled dataset than in Study 19. 
Stomatitis 
Study 19 showed patients on olaparib reporting stomatitis more frequently than those on placebo; 
12/136, 8.8% patients vs. 4/128, 3.1% patients, respectively. After exposure adjustment per 1000 
patient years, stomatitis events on olaparib remained higher; 75.7 vs. 51.4 per 1000 patient years, 
respectively. The median time to onset for those patients who had an event reported was later for 
olaparib-treated patients than those on placebo (75 [range 4 to 581] days vs. 36 [range 2 to 168] days). 
All patients had received platinum based chemotherapy prior to entering the study. All events were 
non-serious, CTC grade 1 or 2 and 11/12 events resolved on study treatment. Only 1 patient in the 
olaparib group required dose modification due to an event of stomatitis, which was also associated with 
herpes zoster and mild oral candidiasis. The majority of events were temporally associated with infections 
or vomiting, fatigue or treatment with sulfasalazine, which has stomatitis listed as a common associated 
event in the SmPC. 
Considering data relating to reports of stomatitis from the combined monotherapy pooled dataset of 11 
studies (including Study 19, the pivotal phase II PSR ovarian maintenance study) 35/735 patients (4.8%) 
reported stomatitis at the 400 mg bd dose level. All events were nonserious and the majority were CTC 
grade 1 or 2. Three patients reported stomatitis with CTC grade 3; all reported other concomitant, 
potentially confounding AEs eg, vomiting, lung infection, pyrexia and anaemia. 
Data from Study 41, the phase II comparative study comparing olaparib in combination with paclitaxel 
and carboplatin followed by maintenance treatment with olaparib, vs. paclitaxel and carboplatin followed

by no treatment, in patients with platinum sensitive advanced serous ovarian cancer has also been 
reviewed and showed an increased frequency in patients receiving combination chemotherapy treatment 
(carboplatin + paclitaxel) with olaparib compared to combination chemotherapy without olaparib (14/81, 
17.3% vs. 8/75, 10.8%, respectively) and likewise in the maintenance phase of the study the frequency 
of stomatitis was greater in the olaparib arm 4/66, 6.1% vs. 0/55, 0% in the non-treated arm. 
Decreased appetite/anorexia 
In Study 19, AEs of decreased appetite/anorexia were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the 
olaparib arm versus the placebo arm. All of these events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity, and there 
were no SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment. Decreased appetite/anorexia was reported 
at a similar frequency in the pooled dataset.  
Headache 
In Study 19, headache was reported as an AE in more patients in the olaparib arm than in the placebo 
arm. Most of these events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity. Headache was not reported as an SAE and 
there were no AEs of headache leading to discontinuation. In the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset, 
headache was reported at a similar frequency. In the maintenance phase of Study 41, more patients in 
the olaparib arm reported events of headache compared to the no treatment arm (8 [12.1%] vs 1 
[1.8%]). In other monotherapy studies of olaparib there was some evidence of a dose response 
relationship for headache. 
 Dizziness 
In Study 19, dizziness was reported as an AE in more patients in the olaparib arm than in the placebo arm; 
all events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity. Dizziness was not reported as an SAE and there were no 
AEs of dizziness leading to discontinuation. Dizziness was reported at a similar frequency in the pooled 
dataset. In the maintenance phase of Study 41, more patients in the olaparib arm reported events of 
dizziness compared with the no treatment arm (7 [10.6%] vs 2 [3.6%]). Across other studies of olaparib 
monotherapy, a dose response relationship for dizziness was evident in Study 12. 
Dysgeusia 
In Study 19, AEs of dysgeusia were reported in a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm versus 
the placebo arm. All of these events were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in severity. None of the events were 
reported as being serious and none of the events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Dysgeusia was reported at a similar frequency in the pooled dataset. 
Dyspnoea 
Dyspnoea events (including dyspnoea exertional) were reported more frequently for patients receiving 
olaparib than those receiving placebo (19/136 [14.0%] patients vs 9/128 [7.0%] patients, respectively). 
When adjusted for extent of exposure, the event rate for ‘dyspnoea’ per 1000 patient years was olaparib 
98.0 vs placebo 104.6 and for ‘dyspnoea exertional’ 17.4 for olaparib vs 12.4 placebo. The number of 
patients with ‘dyspnoea exertional’ was low (3/136 [2.2%] vs 1/128 [0.8%], respectively) and one of 
these olaparib patients also had dyspnoea. Median time to onset for patients who had ‘dyspnoea’ was 124 
days (range 14 to 879 days ) for olaparib vs 102 days (range 5 to 364 days) for placebo and those who 
had ‘dyspnoea exertional’ was 33 days (range 9 to 625 days) for olaparib vs 169 days for placebo. 
All olaparib treated patients with dyspnoea-type events had possible alternative causes for the events, 
such as underlying current medical history eg, dyspnoea (3), anaemia (3), fatigue (2), pleural effusion 
(1), asthma (1), mitral valve insufficiency (1), post traumatic stress disorder and panic attacks (1), 
obesity (1), upper abdominal pain (1) and anxiety (1), or concurrent adverse events including: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 145/187 
  
  
bronchopneumonia (1), pyrexia (1), anaemia (1) or fatigue (1). The majority of the events were CTC 
grade 1 or 2 (17/19) and generally resolved on treatment. 
Of the two patients with CTC grade 3 dyspnoea, one patient experienced dyspnoea after 92 days of 
olaparib treatment; study treatment was stopped due to the event. The patient had been receiving 
several treatments for concurrent bronchopneumonia (CTC grade 2) from day 29 – 101 and again from 
day 120 onwards. These treatments included cephalosporin antibiotic (orelox), penicillin (tazobac), 
prednisolone (decortin) and salbutamol. The investigator considered the dyspnoea to be secondary to the 
bronchopneumonia. 
Another patient experienced dyspnoea after 879 days of olaparib treatment which lasted 18 days; study 
treatment was temporarily stopped due to the event. The patient had a current medical history of 
post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks and alcoholism. A sample of sputum showed large numbers 
of haemophilus influenza isolates. 
Pneumonitis 
As of 20 May 2013, 10 olaparib treated patients have reported pneumonitis out of a total of 2034 patients 
estimated to have received olaparib, giving a cumulative incidence of 0.5% for pneumonitis. Pneumonitis 
has also been reported for 1 patient randomised to placebo in Study 19 and 1 patient randomised to 
placebo plus paclitaxel in Study 39. No new reports of pneumonitis have been received since the 20 May 
2013. As of 31 January 2014, a total of 2389 patients are estimated to have received olaparib, giving a 
cumulative incidence proportion of 0.42%. 
The pneumonitis events were reported in patients receiving olaparib for a variety of tumour types 
(ovarian [n=2], NSCLC [n=2], SCLC [n=1], breast [n=2], and 1 each of pancreatic, thymic and gastric 
cancer), both when given as monotherapy (400 mg bd or 200 mg bd) and when given in combination with 
other anti-cancer agents (at 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg bd). 
Of the 10 patients treated with olaparib reported to have pneumonitis, five died from evidenced disease 
progression, all of whom had locally advanced disease at baseline (NSCLC, SCLC, thymic cancer stage IV, 
breast cancer stage IV and pulmonary metastatic breast cancer). Of the surviving 5 patients with 
pneumonitis, 1 was considered as non-serious by the reporting investigator. 
The presentation and course of the pneumonitis cases did not show a consistent clinical or radiographic 
pattern (as centrally assessed by independent review of chest CT and radiographs), and were confounded 
by several pre disposing factors (including disease under investigation, locally advanced pulmonary 
disease, other pre-existing medical conditions, smoking history and/or prior chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy). 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
In study 19, twelve patients reported a total of 17 events from the hepatobiliary disorders SOC or 
Investigations SOC (relating to abnormal hepatic clinical chemistry); 4 patients (2.9%) reported 4 events 
overall with olaparib and 8 patients (6.3%) reported 13 events overall with placebo. The 4 events 
reported by 4 patients on olaparib treatment were CTCAE grade 1 hepatic cyst, an SAE of CTCAE grade 5 
cholestatic jaundice, CTCAE grade 2 increased ALT and CTCAE grade 1 increased blood alkaline 
phosphatase. The fatal event of cholestatic jaundice in an 80-year patient was considered due to disease 
progression.  
In total, 37/735 patients (5.0%) across the pooled monotherapy dataset reported 57 events from the 
hepatobiliary disorders or investigations SOC relating to hepatic toxicity. The most common events 
reported were hepatomegaly in 5 patients (0.7%), jaundice + cholestatic jaundice in 4 patients (0.5%) 
and abnormalities in liver biochemistry.

Renal events 
Thirty-eight patients overall reported a total of 50 events relating to renal/urinary disorders from the 
Renal and Urinary Disorders or Investigations SOCs in Study 19; 24 patients (17.6%) reported 31 events 
overall with olaparib and 14 patients (10.9%) reported 19 events overall with placebo. Among the 735 
patients who received 400 mg bd olaparib in the pooled data set, 78 patients reported 92 events from the 
Renal/Urinary Disorder SOC and an additional 42 events relating to abnormalities in renal chemistry 
parameters were reported within the Investigations SOC. 
The most common renal symptoms reported were related to urinary urgency, frequency or incontinence, 
e.g. dysuria, pollakiuria, and urinary incontinence, which are commonly reported symptoms for patients 
with advanced ovarian cancer. 
Mild elevations in creatinine with no apparent sequelae have been observed in the absence of an elevation 
in urea or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or a reported abnormality on urinalysis (see laboratory findings).  
QT prolongation and cardiac toxicity 
In Study 19, 1 patient in the olaparib arm had a CTCAC ≥grade 3 SAE of syncope that was considered 
related to study treatment by the investigator. Two patients in the placebo arm had AEs of syncope, 1 of 
which was CTCAC ≥grade 3, but neither of which were considered related to study treatment. 
In the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset, 9 (1.2%) patients reported an ECG-related event (either 
preferred term of prolonged QT [n=2] or syncope [n=7]). This includes the patient in the olaparib arm of 
Study 19 with syncope mentioned above. Six of these 9 patients had AEs of CTCAE ≥grade 3, 3 patients 
had events that were considered causally related to olaparib, and 3 patients had SAEs. Of the 7 reported 
syncope cases in the pooled dataset, 2 were considered by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment. There were 2 events of prolonged ECG QT in the pooled dataset 
Haemorrhages 
In Study 19, 32 patients reported a total of 37 haemorrhagic events (21 patients [15.4%] in the olaparib 
400 mg bd group reported 24 events and 11 patients [8.6%] in the placebo group reported 13 events). 
However, since the overall median actual treatment duration was approximately 9 months and 5 months 
in the olaparib and placebo groups, respectively, the frequencies were not directly comparable. Most of 
the events in either treatment group were considered to be non-serious; only 4 (2.9%) patients in the 
olaparib group reported serious adverse event. A patient in the olaparib group had a fatal AE of CTCAE 
grade 5 haemorrhagic stroke, preceded by an SAE of thrombocytopenia (CTCAE grade 4). The fatal AE 
was considered related to study drug by the investigator. The remaining 3 SAEs (melaena, 
intra-abdominal haemorrhage and post procedural haematoma) were all considered unrelated to 
olaparib.  
A total of 90 patients (12.2%) had 110 events of haemorrhage in the pooled dataset of 735 patients who 
had received 400 mg bd olaparib (including events in Study 19). The majority of the events were 
considered to be non-serious; 13 (1.8%) patients reported SAEs. All SAEs were considered unrelated to 
olaparib except 1 event of haemorrhagic stroke (discussed above). Nine (1.2%) patients reported AEs of 
CTCAE grade 3 or above, with 10 events in 10 (1.4%) of patients were considered related to any 
treatment.  
A review of the haematology laboratory findings in patients with haemorrhagic events did not highlight 
any clinically significant shift from baseline or a relationship to thrombocytopenia, except for the patient 
with haemorrhagic stroke.

Gastrointestinal obstructions 
In Study 19, there were relatively few AEs representing the topic of gastrointestinal obstruction. Eight 
patients reported a total of 10 gastrointestinal obstruction type events: 3 patients (2.2%) in the olaparib 
group each reported 1 event, and 5 patients (3.9%) in the placebo group reported 7 events. The majority 
of the patients in both treatment groups had events that were considered to be serious (3 [2.2%] out of 
a total of 3 patients in the olaparib group and 4 [3.1%] out of a total of 5 patients in the placebo group) 
and resulted in hospitalisation of the patient. Apart from 1 event of subileus and 1 event of intestinal 
obstruction in the placebo group (both CTCAE grade 2), all the events were CTCAE grade 3 or 4. Apart 
from one event of intestinal obstruction on placebo, all the gastrointestinal obstruction events were 
considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study treatment. A total of 40 patients (5.4%) had 54 
events of gastrointestinal obstruction in the pooled dataset of 735 patients who had received 400 mg bd 
olaparib (including events in Study 19). Many patients had a current or past medical history of 
gastrointestinal obstructions. The majority of the events was considered to be serious (32 
[4.4%]patients) and was CTCAE grade 3 or higher in severity (34 [4.6%] patients). None of the patients 
had events that were considered by the investigator to be related to olaparib. The majority of the 
gastrointestinal obstruction events resolved (42/54 events).   
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML)  
There were 21 reports of MDS and/or AML in patients treated with olaparib as of 20 August 2014; 14 cases 
in olaparib monotherapy trials and 7 cases in olaparib combination studies with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
(n=4), cediranib (n=1) or irinotecan and cisplatin (n=2).  A total of 2866 patients are estimated to have 
received olaparib (as of 20 August 2014), giving a cumulative incidence of 0.73% for MDS/AML.  The 
cumulative incidence reported from control arms of olaparib randomised studies is 0.4% (2/550 
patients).Sixteen of the MDS/AML cases were reported in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (12 with 
BRCA1 mutations, 3 with BRCA2 mutations and 1 with unspecified BRCA mutation).  Of the remaining 5 
patients; 3 were BRCA status unknown and 2 were known to be BRCA wildtype.  It is difficult to calculate 
an incidence for MDS/AML in BRCAm patients across the programme because BRCA mutation status was 
not collected in every clinical study with olaparib.  In patients with BRCAm ovarian cancer enrolled in 5 
randomised clinical trials, the incidence of MDS/AML was 1.1% (6 cases/546 olaparib-treated BRCAm 
patients in Studies 19, 12, 41, D0818C00001 [SOLO1] and D0816C00002 [SOLO2]).  The incidence in 
BRCAm control arm patients is 0.6% (2 cases/353 BRCAm control arm patients in Studies 19, 12, 41, 
SOLO1 and SOLO2). 
Other new primary malignancies 
Overall, the number of events of new primary malignant tumours (other than MDS/AML reports discussed 
above) reported was low, with 23 events (in 21 patients) being reported in an estimated 2866 
olaparib-treated patients (0.73%) as of 20 August 2014. No new reports of new primary malignancies 
were received between 20 August 2014 and the 24 September 2014.

Adverse drug reactions  
Reporting AEs in terms of exposure-adjusted event rates indicated that for many of the most common 
events reported at a higher frequency on olaparib compared to placebo, the rate remained higher for 
olaparib treated patients when adjusted for exposure: nausea, vomiting, anaemia, upper abdominal pain, 
dyspepsia and dysgeusia. For a number of events however, namely fatigue, constipation, decreased 
appetite, headache, cough, back pain, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection, 
abdominal distension and dyspnoea, the exposure-adjusted event rates appeared either similar between 
the arms or higher for placebo-treated patients. An assessment of AEs by treatment period of AE onset 
indicated treatment differences between the arms remained for fatigue, decreased appetite, headache 
and dizziness with a higher reporting frequency for olaparib-treated patients over placebo-treated 
patients during the first 0 to 3 months and/or 3 to 6 months on study when the majority of patients on 
both treatment arms were on study treatment. Based on the above analysis of adverse events by system 
organ class, adverse events of nausea, vomiting, fatigue (including asthenia), anaemia, dyspepsia, 
dysguesia, dizziness, headache, upper abdominal pain and decreased appetite were considered 
associated with olaparib treatment. Although the reporting rate of diarrhoea was similar in the olaparib 
and placebo arms in Study 19, it was considered to be associated with olaparib due to findings from other 
studies in the clinical programme (Study 12 and 41). Based on a detailed review of all the available 
individual patient information with reports of stomatitis, it was considered that there is reasonable 
temporal evidence to suggest that olaparib may have a causal association with the development of 
stomatitis.  
Muscle spasms were reported more frequently for olaparib versus placebo (9.6% vs. 3.9%). These were 
isolated events described as cramps in extremities, sometimes intermittent or occasional, all mild and 
moderate intensity (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and did not require olaparib dose modifications. All patients had 
other potential contributory factors for events of muscle cramps, such as arthralgia, peripheral 
neuropathy, varicose veins, or use of concomitant medication such as thyroxine and raloxifene. 
Peripheral neuropathy was reported more frequently for olaparib versus placebo (8.8% vs. 2.3%). 
Additional AE preferred terms including peripheral sensory neuropathy and polyneuropathy were reported 
in small numbers of patients. There were no patients with duplicate reporting of these preferred terms, so 
across these terms 14 (10.3%) patients in the olaparib group and 10 (7.8%) patients in the placebo group 
reported an event. 
 Based on the above, no association with olaparib was concluded for muscle spasms and peripheral 
neuropathy.

Patient who later developed MDS (fatal AE) 
Patient who had a fatal AE of haemorrhagic stroke 
Patient had cholestatic jaundice reported at previous DCO: further follow up led to the re-classification of this 
event to progressive disease therefore the SAE of cholestatic jaundice is no longer reported. 
Patient experienced a second event of pulmonary embolism at the Safety Update DCO but this is not reflected in 
this table because it is a second occurrence of the same SAE Preferred Term in 1 patient. 
Patients reporting multiple SAEs are counted once for each System Organ Class/Preferred Term.  Data sorted 
alphabetically by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. 
Includes adverse events with an onset date between the date of first dose and 30 days following the date of last dose 
of study treatment. 
New SAEs which had not been reported at the MAA DCO are indicated by bold italic text.

Patient (gBRCAm) who had a fatal AE of haemorrhagic stroke 
Patient ad cholestatic jaundice reported at previous DCO: further follow up led to the re-classification of this event 
to progressive disease therefore the SAE of cholestatic jaundice is no longer reported. 
Patients reporting multiple SAEs are counted once for each System Organ Class/Preferred Term.  Data sorted 
alphabetically by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. 
Includes adverse events with an onset date between the date of first dose and 30 days following the date of last dose 
of study treatment. 
New SAEs which had not been reported at the MAA DCO are indicated by bold italic text. 
AE Adverse event; BRCAm gBRCA and/or tBRCA mutated; CSR Clinical study report; DCO Data cut-off; gBRCA 
Germline breast cancer susceptibility gene; MAA New Drug Application; SAE Serious adverse event; tBRCA Tumour 
breast cancer susceptibility gene. 
DCO for MAA: 26 November 2012; DCO for safety update: 31 January 2014 
Consistent with Study 19, the most common SOCs reported for SAEs reported by patients in the 400 mg 
bd monotherapy pool were blood and lymphatic disorders (most commonly reported preferred term 
anaemia, 2.9% patients) and gastrointestinal disorders (intestinal obstruction, small intestinal 
obstruction, vomiting, abdominal pain; 1.8 to 1.9% patients). The proportion of patients in the 400 mg bd 
monotherapy pool reporting SAEs was higher than in Study 19 (25.2% vs 18.4% in the overall 
population; 27.7% vs 21.6% in the BRCAm subgroup), this could reflect the more advanced stage of 
disease of patients included in the pool (data cut-off 26 November 2012). 
In the supportive study 41, serious AEs were reported in 10.6% of patients treated with olaparib 
compared to 7.3% in the placebo group. Notably, 3 MDS were observed in the olaparib arm, one resolved 
and 2 unresolved; one fatal case of DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) in patient also having 
MDS was considered as related to study drug.

Deaths 
Sixteen patients in the pooled dataset had either a fatal AE only reported, or had death related to disease 
and a fatal AE reported. In 2 of the 16 patients, no fatal AE commenced until post follow up. There were 
nine deaths reported in the pooled dataset where the reason was ‘other’. These include 6 patients from 
Study 19. In addition, 1 patient in Study 9 (primary cause of death of acute myeloid leukaemia), 1 patient 
in Study 12 (primary and secondary causes of death recorded as unknown, but appears to be due to 
disease progression) and 1 patient from Study 24 (due to disease progression, but recorded as ‘other’). 
Nine of the 16 patients with fatal AEs were from Study 42. Whilst all patients in Study 42 were late line 
patients (mean number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4.0), the nine patients in Study 42 reporting 
fatal AEs had a higher burden of prior chemotherapy (mean 5.6, range 3-10). In 4 of the patients 
co-morbidities present at study entry contributed to the fatal events. 
In the pivotal study, one patient in the olaparib arm was reported to have died due to an AE only; this 
patient suffered a haemorrhagic stroke, which was considered related to study treatment. Two further 
deaths were reported in the olaparib arm, where the reason for death was recorded as related to the 
disease under study and a fatal AE (cholestatic jaundice and myelodysplastic syndrome).

In study 41, there were 3 ‘other’ deaths in the olaparib arm, all of which occurred post-30-day follow up. 
These were recorded as sepsis (occurred a long time after safety follow-up and after subsequent rounds 
of chemotherapy), metastatic ovarian cancer (but not recorded as due to disease under investigation), 
and cardiac infarction (the patient appeared to have progressive disease due to brain metastases, and 
had recent/prior abnormal ECG findings, along with a history of hypertension and stroke). There was 1 
fatal AE of disseminated intravascular coagulation (AE commenced in the follow-up period after the 
maintenance phase and the patient died post follow up; this patient also had myelodysplastic syndrome).

Clinical chemistry 
Table 75: Number (%) of patients with maximum overall CTCAE grade during treatment for key clinical 
chemistry parameters: Study 19, Safety Analysis Set 
The clinical chemistry changes observed during Study 19 remained generally mild to moderate in severity 
and required no treatment/dose modification.  The number of patients with changes to CTCAE grade 3 or 
4 values during the study remained low and generally similar in the olaparib and placebo groups.  This 
was true for all patients in Study 19 and for the subset of patients with a BRCA mutation.  Laboratory data 
for patients in the gBRCA subgroup were consistent with those for all patients and those with a BRCAm. 
Hepatic function 
The majority of patients in the olaparib (95.6%) and placebo arms (95.3%) had AT values ≤3 x ULN 
(Safety Update).  The number of patients with AT values >3x ULN to ≤5x ULN and >5x ULN to ≤10 x ULN 
was small, and similar in the olaparib arm (2.2% and 0.7%, respectively) and the placebo arm 2.3% and 
2.3%, respectively).  Two patients had elevations of AT >10 x ULN to ≤20 ULN in the olaparib arm.   
In the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset, AT values of >3x ULN to ≤ 5x ULN, >5x ULN to ≤ 10 x 
ULN, >10 x ULN to ≤ 20x ULN, and >20x ULN were infrequently reported (4.2%, 2.2%, 1.0% and 0.4% 
of patients, respectively, safety update).

Renal function 
In Study 19, 90.4% of olaparib treated patients had creatinine CTCAE grade 0 at baseline and 9.6% had 
CTCAE grade 1 at baseline. A small increase in mean and median values for serum creatinine between 
baseline and Day 8 was observed for olaparib treated patients (median level 71 μmol/L at baseline; 85 
μmol/L on Day 8). The median change from baseline on Day 8 for olaparib treated patients was 19.4% 
compared with 0% change for placebo treated patients. A total of 41/135 (30.4%) patients in the olaparib 
arm and 7/127 (5.5%) patients in placebo arm had a change from CTCAE grade 0 at baseline to CTCAE 
grade 1 for creatinine. Median values then remained consistent over time and returned to baseline values 
on discontinuation of olaparib. 
Data from all patients in the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset were consistent with that of Study 
19. In the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset, 78.4% of all patients had a change from CTCAE grade 
0 at baseline to grade 1 for creatinine.  
Two additional patients each reported one additional AE of blood creatinine increased; both events were 
mild or moderate (not CTCAE grade ≥3) (Safety update, 31 January 2014).   
Urinalysis 
There were no clinically relevant findings for urinalysis in Study 19.

relevance to elderly patients, by age (Monotherapy pool, olaparib 400 mg bd) 
Patients with renal impairment 
Clinical studies conducted to date have entry criteria to exclude patients with serum creatinine >1.5x 
institutional ULN. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula this would be expected to exclude patients with a 
creatinine clearance level of >50 mL/min. Patients meeting the criteria for mild renal impairment have 
therefore been eligible to participate in clinical studies for which data are available. As creatinine 
clearance estimates were not required at study entry, a small number of patients falling into the moderate 
category (after estimation by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) have also received olaparib. 
The impact of renal impairment at baseline on the type/frequency of AEs reported with olaparib has been 
assessed using safety data from the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset (n=735). Categorisation for 
renal impairment classification based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is defined in the CHMP Note for 
Guidance 2004. For this assessment of the 735 patients included in the clinical studies of olaparib 400 mg 
bd, estimates for GFR using creatinine clearance estimation have been calculated indirectly using the 
Cockcroft-Gault equation, a recognised formula which uses serum creatinine in combination with age, sex 
and weight to estimate creatinine clearance in mL/min. Normal renal function was defined as creatinine 
clearance >80 mL/min, mild renal impairment as creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min, moderate renal 
impairment as creatinine clearance 30-<50 mL/min and severe renal impairment as creatinine clearance 
<30 mL/min. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 159/187 
 
 
  
  
Overall 448 patients were classified as having normal renal function, 237 mild renal impairment, 45 
moderate renal impairment and 1 patient severe renal impairment at baseline. Data from 4 patients could 
not be categorised according to baseline renal impairment because the required data for the calculation 
was not collected.  
The greatest differences in CTCAE ≥grade 3 reporting rates across the groups was observed in the 
investigations SOC (moderate=11.1%, mild=5.9%, normal=5.1%) and the general disorders and 
administrative site conditions SOC (moderate=13.3%, mild=11.8%, normal=7.1%). The most 
commonly reported AEs leading to dose modifications were anaemia, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions – transporter proteins 
Based on in vitro data, there is a potential for olaparib to reduce statin clearance, a drug-drug interaction 
that may be clinically relevant. No formal olaparib-statin interaction study has been conducted. 
Therefore, safety data from the olaparib 400 mg bd pooled dataset has been used to investigate any 
potential for olaparib to increase the frequency of statin-associated toxicities. In the group of 89 patients 
in the monotherapy pooled dataset who were taking a statin, the frequency of common AEs known to be 
associated with statins (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, back pain, myalgia and increased blood 
transaminases) were similar to those expected, based on published data (for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, 
rosuvastatin and simvastatin). Nausea was reported in 53 (59.6%) patients, diarrhoea in 27 (30.3%), 
abdominal pain in 19 (21.3%), back pain in 13 (14.6%), myalgia in 7 (7.9%), and blood transaminase 
increased in no patients. There was no evidence to suggest that olaparib potentiated statin-associated 
toxicities. 
Based on in vitro data, there is a potential for olaparib to reduce the clearance of OCT transporter 
substrates (e.g. metformin), a drug-drug interaction that may be clinically relevant. No formal 
olaparib-metformin interaction study was conducted. Therefore, safety data from the olaparib 400 mg bd 
pooled dataset has been used to investigate any potential for olaparib to increase the frequency of 
metformin-associated toxicities. Although patient numbers are relatively small, in the group of 45 
patients in the monotherapy pooled dataset who were taking metformin, the frequencies of common AEs 
known to be associated with metformin were similar to that expected, based on published data. Nausea 
was reported in 24 (53.3%) patients, vomiting in 18 (40.0%), diarrhoea in 17 (37.8%), decreased 
appetite in 11 (24.4%), abdominal pain in 9 (20.0%) and taste disturbance (dysphagia) in 1 (2.2%). 
There did not appear to be a potentiation of common AEs associated with metformin use when given 
concurrently with olaparib. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations due to adverse events in Study 19 (data cut off: 31 January 2014) 
The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued study drug due to AEs was low. Across all 
patients, 6 (4.4%) patients receiving olaparib and 2 (1.6%) patients receiving placebo had an AE leading 
to discontinuation reported.  No single event leading to discontinuation was reported in >1 patient in 
either treatment group.  
In the olaparib arm, 6 patients had 8 separate events reported, 5 of which resolved with permanent 
treatment discontinuation, 1 resulted in death (haemorrhagic stroke) and 2 were still present (myalgia 
and pancytopenia).   
The proportion of patients in the gBRCA subgroup with AEs leading to discontinuation was 5/53 (9.4%) in 
the olaparib group and none in the placebo group.

Study 41 maintenance phase 
Few (7 [10.6%]) patients had AEs leading to discontinuation of olaparib monotherapy reported in the 
maintenance phase. These AEs were anaemia, ascites, dysphagia and haemoptysis (each in 1 patient 
only), and 3 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (one of which was recently re-diagnosed as abnormal 
erythropoiesis). Five reported events resolved with olaparib discontinuation, and 2 remained unresolved 
(2 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome). Of note, in the combination phase, 15 patients (18.5%) and 12 
patients (16.0%) had AEs leading to discontinuation in the O/C4/P and C6/P arms, respectively. More 
patients in the O/C4/P arm (8.6%) had haematological toxicity leading to discontinuation than in the C6/P 
arm (0%). 
Adverse events leading to dose interruptions/reductions in Study 19 (data cut off: 31 January 2014) 
There was no overall increase in the number of patients who had a dose interruption due to an AE, 
although there were small increases in the incidence of some individual AEs that led to dose interruptions.  
There was a small increase in the number of patients who reported an AE leading to dose reduction (6 on 
the olaparib arm [3 gBRCAm] and 3 on the placebo arm [1 gBRCAm]) which was accompanied by small 
increases in the incidence of some individual AEs that led to dose reductions. 
Adverse events leading to dose interruptions were reported for a numerically higher percentage of 
patients in the olaparib arm of Study 19 (47 [34.6%]) than in the placebo arm (12 [9.4%]).  The most 
common AEs leading to dose interruption in the olaparib arm were vomiting (8.1% of patients), nausea 
(6.6%), fatigue (4.4%), abdominal pain (3.7%) and diarrhoea (3.7%).  Compared with all patients, AEs 
leading to dose interruptions were reported in a similar proportion of patients in the BRCAm subgroup 
(36.5% olaparib vs. 9.7% placebo) and in a slightly lower proportion of patients in the gBRCA subgroup 
(32.1% olaparib vs. 7.0% placebo).   
Adverse events leading to dose reductions were also more commonly reported in the olaparib arm of 
Study 19 (34 [25.0%] patients) than in the placebo arm (6 [4.7%] patients).  The most common AEs 
leading to dose reductions in the olaparib arm were similar to those leading to dose interruptions: 
vomiting (2.9%), nausea (3.7%), fatigue (4.4%) and anaemia (3.7%).  Compared with all patients, AEs 
leading to dose reductions were reported in a similar proportion of patients in the BRCAm subgroup 
(25.7% olaparib vs. 3.2% placebo) and in a slightly lower proportion of patients in the gBRCA subgroup 
(18.9% olaparib vs. 4.7% placebo).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, the clinical development programme of olaparib included 2034 subjects with ovarian and other 
solid tumours who received at least one dose of olaparib, regardless of the dosage and treatment 
duration. The clinical safety analysis was based on monotherapy and combination, phase 1 and 2 studies. 
No phase 3 study in the requested indication was submitted. 
Pooled safety data from the pivotal study 19 and an additional 10 studies in a total of 735 patients with 
advanced solid tumours were provided in support of the use of olaparib 400 mg bd monotherapy. 
Although the pooling of safety data from studies with different indications and different trial design is 
questionable, a comparison was also provided in patients affected by the BRCAm ovarian cancer receiving 
olaparib (n=397).  
In addition, safety data were also presented for the pivotal study 19 and supportive study 41 (121 
patients who entered the maintenance phase of the study 41). Data from study 41 were presented 
independently considering the potential for carryover of ongoing toxicities from the previous combination 
phase that may have influenced the overall pool dataset. Data from Study 19 are considered to be the 
primary source of information contributing to the olaparib safety profile.  
In study 19, a greater proportion of patients in the olaparib group continued to receive treatment over 
time  than  in  the  placebo  group,  this  becoming  apparent  after  approximately  6  months.  Long-term 
exposure  to  olaparib  maintenance  therapy  was  initially  demonstrated  in  this  study:  54  (39.7%),  32 
(23.5%) and 19 (14.0%) of all patients in the olaparib group remained on treatment at 1 year, 2 years 
and  3  years,  respectively.  Overall,  around  half  of  patients  have  been  treated  for  6  months  and  more 
(320/735, 43.5% in the pooled dataset and 207/397, 52.1% in the BRCAm ovarian cancer subgroup). 
Smaller percentages of patients had treatment duration of ≥12 months (respectively 19% and 23.7%). 
Considering the claimed maintenance setting, the safety dataset contributing to long-term exposure to 
olaparib appears limited. Further safety data will be provided from ongoing studies (see RMP). 
In studies 19 and 41, the mean daily doses for olaparib as maintenance treatment were below 700 mg. 
The mean dose adherence was lower in the olaparib group (84.4%) compared with the placebo group 
(96.6%).Dose reduction to 200 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 400 mg) and, if a 
further final dose reduction is required, to 100 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 200 mg) 
or treatment interruption to manage adverse events were foreseen by study protocols and are adequately 
reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC (dose adjustments). 
Adverse events

Page 163/187 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
According to the primary pharmacology of this class of drugs and as confirmed from non-clinical studies 
with olaparib, the expected toxicities include myelosuppression (anaemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting) and fatigue. Effects on embryo foetal 
survival and clastogenicity were also reported.  
In Study 19, the most common System Organ Classes (SOC) for reported AEs were gastrointestinal 
disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, nervous system disorders, and infections 
and infestations. The most common AEs that were reported at a 5% greater frequency in the olaparib 400 
mg bd group compared with the placebo group were nausea, fatigue, vomiting and anaemia. Overall, the 
profile and incidence of common AEs for the BRCAm subset of patients was similar to that observed in the 
overall patient population. 
In Study 19, a significantly higher percentage of all patients in the olaparib group reported AEs of CTCAE 
grade ≥3 (40.4%) compared with the placebo group (21.9%). The most common AEs of CTCAE grade ≥3 
reported on olaparib treatment were fatigue and anaemia. This was also the case for the subgroup of 
patients with a BRCAm. Most grade 3 and higher events were reported during the first 6 months of 
treatment. When compared with data for all patients in the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset, there 
was a similar percentage of patients with grade 3/4 AEs, with fatigue and anaemia being the most 
common grade 3/4 AEs. Grade 3/4 anaemia was reported more frequently in the pooled dataset (11.4%) 
and in study 41 (9.1%) than in Study 19 (5.1%).  
In all patients in Study 19, there was a numerically higher percentage of patients in the olaparib group 
with a dose interruption (36%) or dose reduction (41.9%) reported compared with the placebo group 
(respectively 16.4% and 21.9%). Dose interruptions were mainly due to an AE. 
The analysis of adverse events by organ system or syndrome showed that gastrointestinal events, 
haematological toxicity and CNS disorders are very common and as such these adverse drug reactions 
have been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Overall, gastrointestinal toxicities were frequently reported with olaparib therapy and were generally low 
grade (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and intermittent and could be managed by dose interruption, dose reduction 
and/or concomitant medicinal products (e.g. antiemetic therapy). Antiemetic prophylaxis is not required 
(see SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8).  
All events of gastrointestinal obstructions were considered not to be related to olaparib by the study 
investigator. Available safety data did not show any evidence that olaparib may increase the risk of 
intestinal obstruction in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.  
Considering that asthenia, fatigue, and dizziness have been reported during treatment with olaparib, 
those patients who experience these symptoms should observe caution when driving or using machines 
(see section 4.7). 
Events from the hepatobiliary disorders SOC or Investigations SOC (abnormalities in liver biochemistry) 
were reported more frequently in the pooled monotherapy than in olaparib arm in study 19. Two cases of 
Hy’s law were also reported but considered as not related to studied drug. However, the role of olaparib 
in worsening of the hepatic injury cannot be excluded. A formal study to evaluate the impact of hepatic 
impairment on olaparib pharmacokinetics and the safety and tolerability profile is ongoing and results will 
be provided in accordance with RMP. 
Mild elevations in creatinine with no apparent sequelae have been observed with olaparib treatment. The 
clinical significance of these mild creatinine elevations in creatinine is unknown (see SmPC section 4.8 and 
RMP) but inhibition of organic cation-transporter-2 (OCT2) by olaparib is considered a plausible 
mechanistic explanation. Further investigations are needed in patients with renal impairment as reflected 
in the RMP. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 164/187 
  
  
In relation to QT prolongation, the clinical data available to date suggest no effect of olaparib on QT 
interval. One case of QT prolongation was reported when olaparib was combined with itraconazole. It is 
recommended that known strong inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, clarithromycin, boosted 
protease inhibitors, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) of CYP3A4/5 isozymes should 
be avoided with olaparib (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Haematological toxicity was reported in patients treated with olaparib, including clinical diagnoses and/or 
laboratory findings of generally mild or moderate (CTCAE grade 1 or 2) anaemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Although, anaemia and other haematological toxicities were 
generally low grade (CTCAE grade 1 or 2), there were reports of CTCAE grade 3 and higher events (see 
SmPC section 4.8). 
Therefore, patients should not start treatment with Lynparza until they have recovered from 
haematological toxicity caused by previous anticancer therapy (haemoglobin, platelet, and neutrophil 
levels should be within normal range or CTCAE grade 1). Baseline testing, followed by monthly 
monitoring, of complete blood counts is recommended for the first 12 months of treatment and 
periodically after this time to monitor for clinically significant changes in any parameter during treatment. 
If a patient develops severe haematological toxicity or blood transfusion dependence, treatment with 
olaparib should be interrupted and appropriate haematological testing should be initiated. If the blood 
parameters remain clinically abnormal after 4 weeks of olaparib dose interruption, bone marrow analysis 
and/or blood cytogenetic analysis are recommended (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Pneumonitis was reported in a small number of patients receiving olaparib, and some reports were fatal. 
The reports of pneumonitis had no consistent clinical pattern and were confounded by a number of 
pre-disposing factors (cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying pulmonary disease, smoking 
history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Therefore, if patients present with new or 
worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough and fever, or a radiological abnormality 
occurs, olaparib treatment should be interrupted and prompt investigation initiated. If pneumonitis is 
confirmed, olaparib treatment should be discontinued and the patient treated appropriately (see SmPC 
section 4.4 and RMP). 
The accumulation of DNA damage following inhibition of PARP might contribute in certain circumstances 
to the development of MDS/AML. The therapeutic window of olaparib might to be narrower in patients 
with germline BRCA mutation at long term since these patients have higher predisposition to cancer in 
general and harbor normal cells with BRCA haploinsufficiency. Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid 
Leukaemia (MDS/AML) were reported in a small number of patients who received olaparib alone or in 
combination with other anti-cancer drugs. The majority of cases have been fatal. The duration of therapy 
with olaparib in patients who developed MDS/AML varied from < 6 months to > 2 years. The cases were 
typical of secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML. All patients had potential contributing factors for 
the development of MDS/AML; the majority of cases were in gBRCA mutation carriers and some of the 
patients had a history of previous cancer or of bone marrow dysplasia. All had received previous platinum- 
containing chemotherapy regimens and many had also received other DNA damaging agents and 
radiotherapy. (see SmPC section 4.4). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 165/187 
  
  
Given that patients with gBRCAm are more likely to participate in PARP inhibitor trials, no firm conclusion 
can be drawn whether incidence is higher in these patients. In addition, it is acknowledged that all 
patients had received previous chemotherapy with DNA damaging agents including platinum, with many 
patients having extensive previous chemotherapy with multiple treatment regimens over multiple years 
including carboplatin, taxanes, anthracyclines, other alkylating and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
damaging agents and radiotherapy. However, the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 3 
for most of the studies in the pooled dataset, indicating that patients were overall not heavily pretreated. 
The risk of developing AML (and secondary MDS) was associated with the cumulative dose and duration 
of treatment. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients with MDS/AML reported was >2 years in 5 
out of 16 patients. Since the maximal total treatment duration in study 19 was 1349 days (<4 years), the 
limitation of the treatment duration with olaparib should be considered. Overall, it is not possible to 
exclude the contribution of previous treatment to the development or acceleration of MDS/AML. However, 
considering the previous points, the risk of presenting MDS/AML when receiving olaparib cannot be ruled 
out. Therefore, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia is considered as an important 
potential risk as reflected in the RMP. Given the seriousness of the risk and the fact that PARP inhibitors 
are a new class of agents with limited knowledge of their safety profile, the PRAC and CHMP considered 
that this risk should be monitored through a registry (see RMP). The applicant will submit within three 
months of approval the protocol synopsis for the registry as reflected in the RMP. 
In addition, if MDS and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with olaparib, it is recommended that 
the patient is treated appropriately. If additional anticancer therapy is recommended, olaparib should be 
discontinued and not given in combination with other anticancer therapy (see SmPC section 4.4).  
In relation to other new primary malignancies, the number of events of new primary malignant tumours 
(including non-melanoma skin cancers) reported was overall low across the development programme for 
olaparib, with 23 events (in 21 patients) being reported in an estimated 2866 olaparib-treated patients 
(0.73%) up to 20 August 2014.  There was also 1 report of bladder cancer in a patient from the placebo 
arm of the double blind Study 19 (1/128 [0.78%]).  Primary malignancies are considered a potential risk 
(see RMP) which will be kept under close surveillance.  The planned placebo-controlled Phase III studies 
will be important in providing additional information on this issue. In addition, annual progress reports 
addressing incidence of MDS/AML and new primary malignancies will be provided together with the PSUR. 
In the pivotal study, significantly higher rate of serious AE has been reported in all patients treated with 
olaparib 400 mg bd compared to placebo: 18.4% vs 8.6% as well as in the BRCAm group treated with 
olaparib: 21.6% vs 9.7% patients under placebo. Both in study 19 and in the pooled dataset, the most 
common SOCs for SAEs were gastrointestinal disorders and blood and lymphatic system disorders. The 
proportion of patients in the 400 mg bd monotherapy pool reporting SAEs was higher than in Study 19 
(25.2% vs 18.4%), especially regarding gastrointestinal disorders (9.7% vs 5.1%). Of note, SAEs were 
more frequent in old people and possibly in the indicated BRCAm population. 
A total of 324/735 (44.1%) of all patients in the 400 mg bd monotherapy pooled dataset were reported 
to have died whilst on treatment, in the 30-day follow up period or post follow up. The majority of deaths 
were reported as due to the disease under investigation (40.7%). Nine of the 16 patients with fatal AEs 
were from Study 42. Four patients of the 16 patients with fatal AEs had AEs causally related to olaparib, 
according to the investigator. Two of them were myelodysplatic syndrome (see discussion on MDS 
above). 
In terms of laboratory findings, five haematology laboratory findings were considered ADRs and are 
therefore listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC for olaparib: haemoglobin levels, neutrophil and lymphocyte 
counts, platelets and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Regarding clinical chemistry, increase in blood 
creatinine was considered an ADR and added to section 4.8 of the SmPC (see also discussion above). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 166/187 
  
  
Overall, in study 19 and in the pooled dataset, the proportion of patients who permanently discontinued 
olaparib due to AEs was low. The most common SOCs reported for AEs leading to discontinuation were 
blood and lymphatic disorders and gastrointestinal disorders. In study 19, more patients receiving 
olaparib with AEs leading to discontinuation were reported: 7 (5.1%) vs 2 (1.6%) patients receiving 
placebo. In the BRCAm group, the difference was even more significant: 8.1% of patients discontinued in 
the olaparib arm compared to 0% in the placebo arm. Nevertheless, all reasons of discontinuation were 
sporadic. Two events were fatal (stroke, jaundice) and two were considered still not resolved 
(thrombocytopenia and myalgia).  
No data were provided in relation to overdose. There is no specific treatment in the event of olaparib 
overdose, and symptoms of overdose were not established. Therefore, in the event of an overdose, 
physicians should follow general supportive measures and should treat symptomatically (see SmPC 
section 4.9). 
Clinical studies with olaparib have not reported any medication errors. The recommended dose of 
Olaparib is 400 mg bid, since olaparib capsules contain 50 mg each, the patient should intake 8 capsules 
of the medicinal product twice a day. This elevated number of capsules is likely to generate medication 
errors resulting in the assumption of an inappropriate dose. Therefore, the potential for patient 
medication errors is considered an important potential risk as adequately addressed in the RMP. 
The use of olaparib as monotherapy treatment has been studied in a number of different tumour types. 
The safety profile of olaparib observed in these studies has been generally consistent with the known 
safety profile of olaparib 400 mg bd for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer maintenance treatment. Therefore, 
the  adverse  events  experienced  with  off-label  monotherapy  use  in  cancers  other  than  the  proposed 
indication (including ovarian cancer with unconfirmed BRCA mutation), would be expected to be generally 
consistent  with  the  prescribing  information.  Off–label  use  will  be  assessed  during  routine 
pharmacovigilance (see RMP). 
Overall, no additional safety issues appeared to emerge in the subgroup of the gBRCAm patients. 
Nevertheless, the relatively small size of this subgroup of patients does not allow drawing firm 
conclusions. More data are needed to confirm that the safety profile in ‘gBRCA mutated’ patients is 
consistent with that of patients without this hereditary alteration. The MAH will provide annual progress 
report addressing the safety issues in patients with gBRCA mutations as part of the PSUR and in line with 
the RMP. The safety data is expected to be analysed as relative to the disease, to the drug, to the inherited 
genetic status (gBRCAm, gBRCAwt), to the mutated genes (BRCA1, BRCA2), to the age of the patients, to 
their ethnologic characteristics and to previous cancer therapies. Although the calculated exposure 
adjusted events, as well as the low numbers and the existence of other potent causal factor did not 
support a causal effect of olaparib in dyspnoea, haemorrhagic stroke, myelodysplastic syndrome and 
pneumonitis, these adverse events will continue to be closely monitored. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is a contraindication (see SmPC 
sections 4.3 and 6.1). 
Special populations 
No studies have been conducted in paediatric patients and the safety of olaparib in children and 
adolescents has not been established (see SmPC section 4.2). 
During clinical studies with olaparib, no pregnancy was observed (pregnancy was an exclusion criterion). 
Based on the mechanism of action of olaparib and taking into account reproductive toxicity including 
serious teratogenic effects and effects on embryofoetal survival reported in the rat at maternal systemic 
exposures lower than those in humans at therapeutic doses, olaparib should not be used during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using reliable contraception during therapy and for 
1 month after receiving the last dose of olaparib. Furthermore, effective methods of contraception are 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 167/187 
  
  
recommended for women of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing potential should not become 
pregnant while on olaparib and not be pregnant at the beginning of treatment. A pregnancy test should be 
performed on all pre-menopausal women prior to treatment (see SmPC section 4.6). 
In addition, a potential interaction of olaparib with hormonal contraceptives which may reduce the 
efficacy of hormonal contraceptives if co-administered with olaparib cannot be excluded because 
inhibition of CYP3A has been observed in vitro and no study in Human has been conducted. Therefore, an 
additional non-hormonal contraceptive method and regular pregnancy tests should be considered during 
treatment (see SmPC sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
The period of 1 month after discontinuation of therapy for the duration of contraception use in females 
was based on a mean terminal elimination half-life of 18.4 hours (range 6.95 to 34.9 hours) and was 
considered adequate given the fact that olaparib showed no mutagenic potential in animal studies. 
There were no clinical data on fertility. In animal studies, no effect on conception was observed but there 
are adverse effects on embryofoetal survival. 
In addition, no data related to milk excretion of olaparib are available. As a precautionary measure, given 
the pharmacologic property of the product, olaparib is contraindicated during breast feeding and for 1 
month after receiving the last dose (see SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.6).  
The review of the safety profile across three age groups (<65 years, 65-74 years and 75-84 years) 
showed an increase of the frequency of SAEs in the seriousness categories of hospitalisation/prolongation 
of hospitalisation, and life threatening events and an increase in number of patients experiencing events 
within the accidents and injuries SMQ with age (mainly due to an increase in reports of fracture). No 
apparent age associated difference in the number of patients reporting events within the SMQs of 
Cerebrovascular disorders and in the System Organ Classes of Nervous disorders, Cardiac disorders, 
Vascular disorders, Infections and Infestations which are potentially more serious in the elderly was 
shown. The type and frequency of events known to be associated with olaparib were similar across the 
different age groups and the number of patients discontinuing treatment with olaparib due to AEs was not 
age dependent. However, the information available in elderly (age ≥ 75 years) is limited (see SmPC 
section 4.2). 
There is also limited clinical data available in non-Caucasian patients. However, no dose adjustment is 
required on the basis of ethnicity (see SmPC section 4.2). Further data will be collected in the course of 
olaparib clinical studies in ethnically diverse groups of patients in order to elucidate the influence of 
ethnicity on olaparib PKs/efficacy/safety profile as reflected in the RMP. 
No specific studies in patients with hepatic or renal impairment using olaparib were submitted and data 
are expected to be provided post-approval as reflected in the RMP. Based on available data, it is 
considered that olaparib can be administered in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
> 50 ml/min). However, olaparib is not recommended for use in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min) or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
considering the limited data and that safety and efficacy have not been established. Olaparib may only be 
used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk, and 
the patient should be carefully monitored for renal function and adverse events (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Olaparib is also not recommended for use in patients with hepatic impairment (serum bilirubin greater 
than 1.5 times upper limit of normal), as safety and efficacy have not been established (see SmPC section 
4.2). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 168/187 
  
  
Of the inclusion criteria for the pivotal Study 19, Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status ≤2 was selected. Thus, there are very limited clinical data available in patients with 
performance status 2 to 4 (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.2). In the real clinical practice it is frequent that 
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, who have completed at least 2 previous courses of 
platinum-containing therapy present a ECOG performance status > 2, therefore patients with ECOG 
performance status > 2 are considered a missing information (see RMP).Interactions 
No formal interactions studies were conducted with olaparib while there is a potential to reduce statin 
clearance and the clearance of OCT transporter substrates (metformin). However, in the subgroup of 45 
patients treated with olaparib and metformin concomitantly, safety profile seemed similar to the total 
safety population.  
Co-administration with potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is expected to alter the pharmacokinetics 
and safety/tolerability profile of olaparib. Clinical studies to evaluate the impact of known CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers have not yet been conducted and it is therefore recommended in the SmPC that 
known potent inhibitors/inducers of this isoenzyme are not co-administered with olaparib.  
Interactions with CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors and interactions with substrates of transporters proteins are 
covered in the RMP under missing information and further data are expected post-authorisation (see 
RMP). 
Non-clinical data showed that olaparib may alter the efficacy of vitamin K antagonists. Clinical data 
available are not sufficiently reliable and robust to conclude to a risk. Therefore, co-administrations of 
vitamin K antagonists with olaparib and the occurrence of events related to disturbances in the INR values 
should be closely monitored and discussed in the first PSUR. 
A review of the available clinical data (400 mg monotherapy pool), identified no patients who received 
concomitant treatment with immunosuppressant drugs or vaccines. Since no clinical data on such risk is 
available and since it cannot be excluded that an interaction could occur, as other chemotherapy agents, 
caution should be taken if these drugs are co administered with olaparib and patients should be closely 
monitored (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Clinical studies of olaparib in combination with other anticancer medicinal products, including DNA 
damaging agents, indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity. Thus, the 
recommended olaparib monotherapy dose is not suitable for combination with other anticancer medicinal 
products (see SmPC section 4.5). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, olaparib monotherapy has been associated with adverse drug reactions generally of mild or 
moderate severity (CTCAE 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. The most 
frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving olaparib monotherapy (≥ 
10%) were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, fatigue, headache, dysgeusia, decreased appetite, 
dizziness, anaemia, neutropaenia, lymphopaenia, mean corpuscular volume elevation, and increase in 
creatinine. 
Adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and anaemia are manageable through treatment 
interruption, dose reduction and/or concomitant medicinal products (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Considering the intended indication in maintenance treatment setting, safety data remains limited and 
longer-term follow-up is required to provide more information about long-term toxicity of olaparib (see 
RMP). In addition, it is expected that the placebo-controlled phase 3 study (SOLO-2) and the phase IV 
study in patients with BRCA mutated population, to be completed as a Annex II condition to better

characterise the efficacy of olaparib will also provide further information on the safety profile of olaparib 
in maintenance setting. Safety data from the study in somatic BRCA mutated patients will contribute to 
the safety data pool and provide further information on potential differences between safety profiles in 
gBRCAm and BRCA wild-type patients (with sBRCAm).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The study 19 met its primary objective of statistically significantly improved PFS in patients with PSR 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer treated with olaparib 400 mg bd as maintenance monotherapy 
compared with placebo. The PFS gain of 3.6 months (medians of 4.8 and 8.4 months) was observed in the 
overall population with PFS HR 0.35. No negative effects on OS or subsequent lines of therapy were 
reported. 
In patients with BRCA-mutated tumors, a 6.9 months prolongation of median PFS (from 4.3 to 11.2 
months) was reported with HR 0.18. The benefit on PFS was partly maintained at second progression: no 
negative effects on subsequent lines of therapy were observed with favourable TSST (HR 0.44) used as a 
surrogate for PFS2. 
There was no statistically significant difference in OS between olaparib-treated patients and 
placebo-treated patients (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.45 1.17; p=0.19; median 34.9 months versus 31.9 months, 
respectively).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the pivotal study 19, an interim analysis of OS was performed at 58% maturity. Mature overall survival 
data at 85% will be provided and allow for a definitive comparison between treatment groups (see Annex 
II conditions). In addition, the ongoing phase III SOLO-2 trial will further define the efficacy of olaparib in 
patients with ‘BRCA mutated’ ovarian cancer. 
SOLO-2  will  also  allow  a  prospective  validation  of  ‘BRCA  mutated’  biomarker  and  provide  a  more 
comprehensive  view  on  the  impact  on  QoL  and  further  understanding  of  mechanisms  of  olaparib 
resistance. 
Available  data  in  patients  with  somatic  BRCA  mutations  are  considered  limited.  However,  there  is  a 
biological rationale suggesting similar activity in patients with somatic BRCA mutations as in patients with 
germline origin of BRCA mutations in their tumors. In addition, the open label study D0816C0000X will 
provide further efficacy data of olaparib in patients harbouring tumors with somatic BRCA mutations (see 
Annex II conditions). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving olaparib 
monotherapy were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, fatigue, headache, dysgeusia, decreased 
appetite, dizziness, anaemia, neutropaenia, lymphopaenia, mean corpuscular volume elevation, and 
increase in creatinine. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 183/187 
  
  
High grade adverse events reported in clinical trials included: blood and lymphatic disorders (grade 3 and 
4), gastrointestinal disorders (grade 3 and 4) and fatigue (grade 3 and 4). 
Adverse events and serious adverse events were significantly more frequent in the olaparib group versus 
the placebo arm in both overall population and BRCAm sub-group. The incidence of AEs for the BRCAm 
subset of patients was similar to that observed in the overall patient population. 
Based on the available data, the following important safety concerns have been identified for olaparib 
(see RMP): anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, raised creatinine levels, nausea including vomiting. 
In addition important potential safety concerns include the risk of MDS/AML, new primary malignancies, 
pneumonitis, potential for off-label use, potential for patient medication errors and effects on 
embryofoetal survival and development. 
Overall, olaparib has been associated with adverse drug reactions generally of mild or moderate severity 
(CTCAE 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety data available are considered limited in terms of number of patients and long-term follow-up 
and therefore does not allow to comprehensively determine long-term toxicities. Long-term exposure 
to/potential toxicity to olaparib is addressed in the risk management plan. In particular, the causality of 
olaparib in occurrence of rare cases of MDS/AML could not be firmly established in the context of previous 
courses of chemotherapy. MDS/AML will be closely monitored as reflected in the RMP.  
In addition, the ongoing SOLO-2 study, although performed with the tablet formulation, will provide 
further long term toxicity data in the BRCAm population. Further safety data will also be available from 
several post-authorisation studies (see Risk Management Plan), with the aim to compare two clinically 
distinct groups of patients, patients with germline BRCA mutations and BRCA wildtype patients 
harbouring somatic BRCA mutations. 
With regard to special populations, exposure in elderly, exposure in ethnically diverse groups and 
exposure in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is limited and further data are expected in these 
populations (see RMP). The risk of interactions with CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors and with substrates of 
transporters is also adequately addressed in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
There is a medical need for the treatment of relapsed high grade serous ovarian cancers. The pivotal 
study 19 was positive with PFS HR of 0.35 and gain of 3.6 months (medians of 4.8 and 8.4 months). No 
negative effects on subsequent lines of therapy, HRQoL or OS were observed. Patients defined as ‘BRCA 
mutated had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS of 6.9 months 
compared with placebo. Although more frequent, other adverse events, like gastrointestinal and 
haematological toxicity were generally of low grade and could be manageable with specific therapy. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 184/187 
  
  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of olaparib as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial 
response) to platinum-based chemotherapy, is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The recommended indication of olaparib is maintenance treatment and PFS benefit is considered clinically 
relevant in this setting. The indication is limited to patient population with BRCA-mutated tumours (51% 
of patients in the pivotal study).  This population was defined based on analysis of mutations in BRCA1 
and BRCA2 genes in blood and tumour samples of patients. This analysis allowed determining the origin 
of tumour mutations in the majority of patients: either due to mutation in germline (present also in tumor 
cells) or acquired mutation within tumor (somatic mutation). Given a claimed mechanism of action and 
well established role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in homologous recombination repair and considering 
that a statistical significance was reached in the overall population, the rationale of performing subgroup 
analysis in this subgroup was considered acceptable.  
For patients with BRCA-mutated tumors, median PFS was 11.2 months in the olaparib group compared 
with 4.3 months in the placebo group, demonstrating that a 6.9-month delay in disease progression could 
be achieved. Consequently, the subsequent chemotherapeutic regimen could be delayed. Although 
olaparib treatment was used for one maintenance cycle between two courses of chemotherapy, a benefit 
was expanded beyond since TSST was also prolonged. No treatment with olaparib was used at 
subsequent relapses. The observed benefit is considered clinically significant since the course of disease 
may be modified. Adverse drug reactions reported with olaparib were generally of mild or moderate 
severity and manageable. Long-term safety data will be provided post-authorisation in line with the risk 
management plan (see RMP). 
The OS data performed at 58% maturity (52% for BRCA mutated group) did not show statistically 
significant differences between olaparib-treated and placebo-treated patients. Mature OS data from study 
19 is required to further address efficacy in the long term (please refer to conclusion on clinical efficacy 
and Annex II conditions). 
The results of study SOLO-2 are required to further confirm the efficacy of olaparib.  Further efficacy data 
from SOLO-2 will verify the impact of the olaparib on several clinical outcomes relevant to assessment of 
efficacy in maintenance setting (please refer to conclusion on clinical efficacy and Annex II conditions).  
As of 19th September 2014, the number of patients randomised into SOLO-2 was 204 out of the planned 
264 patients (77% complete) and based on the numbers of patients known to be in screening, it is 
anticipated that recruitment will complete in November 2014. Considering the current status of the 
SOLO-2, the marketing authorisation of olaparib in this patient population is not expected to hamper the 
conduct of this trial. Longer-term safety will also be followed-up in this study (see conclusion on clinical 
safety). 
Considering the limited number of observations in patients with somatic BRCA mutations it was discussed 
how efficacy demonstrated in patients with germline BRCA mutations could be extrapolated to patients 
with somatic mutations. Based on strong biological rationale and considering the SAG view, similar 
activity is expected in patients with somatic BRCA mutations to that in patients with germline BRCA 
mutations. The reported prevalence of somatic BRCA mutations varies but they may represent a 
substantial proportion of alterations leading to HR deficiencies. Uncertainties relative to efficacy in this 
group of patients may be related to tumor heterogeneity and involvement of other mechanisms leading to 
HR deficiency. Although limited, available clinical data indicate efficacy of olaparib in patients with somatic 
BRCA mutations. An open-label phase IV study is required to address the remaining uncertainty in this 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/789139/2014 
Page 185/187 
  
  
subpopulation of patients (please refer to conclusion on clinical efficacy). Safety data from this study will 
also contribute to the safety data pool and provide further information on potential differences between 
safety profiles in gBRCAm and BRCA wild-type patients (with sBRCAm) (see conclusion on clinical safety). 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lynparza (olaparib) is not similar to Yondelis (trabectedin) 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Lynparza as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial 
response) to platinum-based chemotherapy, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the

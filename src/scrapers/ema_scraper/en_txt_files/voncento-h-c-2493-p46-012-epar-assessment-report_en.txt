1.  Introduction 
On  7th August 2018, the MAH submitted a final clinical study report CSLCT-BIO-12-83 for Voncento in 
von  Willebrand  disease  (VWD),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as 
amended.  
The  current  assessment  report  concerns  this  final  study  report  of  Study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  which 
involved 25 subjects with VWD of whom 4 were paediatric patients younger than 12 years. There were 
no patients aged 12 to 18 years. 
This  study  report  is  also  submitted  as  part  of  the  post-authorisation  measure  to  conduct  a  post-
marketing  study  (PMS)  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  EMA  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Clinical 
Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand factor (VWF) Products [CPMP/BPWG/220/02]. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Voncento  contains  human  coagulant  FVIII/von  Willebrand  factor  complex  concentrate  at  a  ratio  of 
approximately 1:2.4 (100 IU/mL FVIII:C and approximately 240 IU/mL VWF:RCo). 
Since  12  August  2013,  Biostate  has  been  licensed  in  the  European  Union  under  the  trade  name 
Voncento.  
The approved indications for Voncento are: 
“Voncento can be used for all age groups. 
von Willebrand disease (VWD) 
Prophylaxis  and  treatment  of  haemorrhage  or  surgical  bleeding  in  patients  with  VWD,  when 
desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or contraindicated. 
Haemophilia A (congenital FVIII deficiency) 
Prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A.” 
Section 4.2 - Current dose recommendations for paediatric use in VWD: 
Regarding the paediatric use of Voncento in the paediatric population with VWD the SPC text (as of 10-
09-2018) states the following: 
Paediatric VWD population 
Treatment of bleeding 
Usually 40 - 80  IU/kg of  von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) corresponding to 20 - 40 IU FVIII:C/kg of 
body weight (BW) are recommended in paediatric patients to treat a bleed. 
Prophylaxis treatment 
Patients aged 12 to 18 years old: Dosing is based on the same guidelines as for adults. 
Patients aged <12 years old: Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 
years  of  age  were  shown  to  have  lower  exposure  of  VWF,  a  prophylactic  dose  range  of  40  –  80  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg body weight 1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2). 
The  dose  and  duration  of  treatment  will  depend  on  the  clinical  status  of  the  patient,  as  well  as  their 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
Section 4.8 – contains a general statement on the Paediatric Population:  
“Frequency,  type  and  severity  of  adverse  reactions  in  children  are  expected  to  be  the  same  as  in 
adults.”

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Safety, tolerability, and efficacy have been demonstrated in clinical studies conducted in haemophilia A 
and VWD subjects in Australia and Europe. Voncento was found to be effective in the management of 
haemorrhage in major and minor surgery, for non-surgical bleeding (NSB) and prophylaxis therapy in 
subjects with VWD and haemophilia A. 
Data  from  8  clinical  studies  in  subjects  over  the  age  of  12  years,  3  in  haemophilia  A  and  5  in  VWD, 
were included in a Marketing Authorisation Application submitted in December 2011. 
Assessor’s comment  
Since  approval,  the  following  clinical  studies  with  Voncento  have  been  submitted  to  the  EMA  and 
reviewed: 
Haemophilia A 
●  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-53,  a  Phase  III,  Open-Label,  Multicentre  Study  to  Evaluate  Efficacy, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Safety of Biostate (Voncento) in Paediatric Subjects with Haemophilia A was 
submitted  in  September  2015.  Evaluation  of  Study  CSLCT-BIO-08-53  led  to  changes  in  the 
information on paediatric Haemophilia A patients in the Voncento product information.

Overall,  the  clinical  program  for  Voncento  in  VWD,  which  includes  the  pivotal  studies  in  adults 
CSLCTBIO-08-54  and  paediatric  subjects  CSLCT-BIO-08-52,  as  well  as  the  extension  study  CSLCT-
BIO-09-64, and now the PMS CSLCT-BIO-12-83 both in adults and paediatrics, provide: 
●  on-demand  treatment  in  31  adults,  10  of  these  subjects  completed  more  than  24  months 
treatment (range 24 to 46 months), and 14 paediatrics (12 months), and 
●  prophylaxis  regimen  in  19  adults,  7  of  whom  completed  more  than  19  months  (range  19  to  28 
months) and 7 paediatrics (3 subjects completing 19 to 28 months). 
The prospective surgery study (CSLCT-BIO-03-97) and investigator led studies [Shortt et al, 2007 and 
Howman  et  al,  2011]  provide  an  additional  65  adults  and  44  paediatric  and  adolescent  subjects  with 
VWD; primarily treated to prevent or stop surgical bleeding.  
Assessor’s comment   
The VWD studies pivotal/most relevant to the Voncento approval in the EU are: 
●  CSLCT-BIO-08-54 which included only subjects ≥12 years old, 
●  CSLCT-BIO-08-52 which included only subjects <12 years old, 
●  Extension  study 09-67 which only included subjects from studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and 08-52 and 
● 
this post-marketing study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 which included subjects of any age. 
Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 has now been submitted in fulfilment of an Article 46 procedure.. 
In the context of the Marketing approval application (MAA) of Voncento, Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 was 
conducted as a commitment to conduct a post-marketing study to comply with the requirements of the 
EMA  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Human  Plasma  Derived  von  Willebrand  factor 
(VWF) Products [CPMP/BPWG/220/02].  
From  Table  1  and  the  information  above  it  can  be  calculated  that  of  the  64  subjects  investigated  in 
these 3 studies, the ages were as follows:  
●  <12 years:   
n= 21 
  -   aged 0 to <6 years:     n= 11 
  -   aged 6 to <12 years:   n= 10 
●  12 to <18 years:         n= 3 
●  ≥18 years: 
n= 40 
With the new data from Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, the number of patients investigated has increased: 
− 
in age group ≥18 years  from 19 (from Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54) to 40 and 
− 
in age group <12 years from 17 (from Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52)  to 21. 
There  are  still  thus  few  data  in  the  adolescent  age  group  in  the  paediatric  population.  However,  this 
was also the case at the time of the MAA and the database at that time was considered acceptable for 
approval.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
CSL has been supplying plasma derived VWF / FVIII complex concentrate in Australia for more than 30 
years and in New Zealand and subsequently several Asian countries for more than a decade. The new 
generation  VWF  /  FVIII  complex  concentrate,  that  for  which  marketing  authorisation  in  the  EU  was

granted in 2013, is marketed as “Voncento” in Europe and “Biostate” outside Europe; for consistency, 
“Voncento”  is  used  throughout  the  CSR  of  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  to  denote  the  investigational 
product. 
The  MAH  states  that  the  formulation  of  the  study  drug,  Voncento,  was  the  same  as  licensed  for 
commercial use.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted a full study report of  Clinical Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, a report synopsis and 
an appendix to module 2.5 (Clinical Overview) as part of this art 46 submission.  
CSL  conducted  this  study  as  a  commitment to  conduct  a  post-marketing  study  (PMS)  to  comply  with 
the  requirements  of  the  EMA  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Human  Plasma  Derived 
von  Willebrand  factor  (VWF)  Products  [CPMP/BPWG/220/02],  specifically  in  relation  to  the  directives 
regarding PMS to collect additional clinical data and to ensure consistency in the long term between the 
outcomes from clinical studies and those from routine use. EMA approved the study protocol to treat at 
least 20 subjects with von Willebrand disease (VWD) for 12 months. 
Types of Von Willebrand Disease 
Type  1  is  the  most  commonly  documented  form  of  VWD,  accounting  for  70-80%  of  cases,  Type  2 
accounts for approximately 20% of all diagnosed cases, and Type 3 the rarest form, accounts for 1-3% 
of cases. Subtypes relevant to study CSLCT-BIO-12-83  are: 
Type  1:  A  quantitative  defect,  in  which  there  are  proportional  reductions  in  the  levels  of  the  VWF 
Antigen  (VWF:Ag)  and  VWF  function  as  measured  by  VWF  Ristocetin  Cofactor  activity   VWF:RCo)  or 
Collagen  Binding  capacity  (VWF:CB);  reduced  level  of  factor  VIII  coagulant  activity  (FVIII:C).  An 
autosomal dominant disorder. 
Type 2A: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to 
the  levels  of  VWF:Ag  and  characterised  by  absence  of  HMW  multimers;  reduced  or  normal  level  of 
FVIII:C. An autosomal dominant disorder. 
Type 2B: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to 
the levels of VWF:Ag; increased affinity to platelet glycoprotein Ibα results in loss of HMW multimers 
and thrombocytopenia; reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. An autosomal dominant disorder. (Patients 
with  Type  2B  were  excluded  from  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  but  one  subject  was  mistakenly  included 
and later withdrawn before any treatment with Voncento was given.) 
Type  3:  Severe  deficiency  of  VWF  characterised  by  VWF:RCo,  VWF:Ag,  and  FVIII:C  levels  typically 
<5% (or virtually immeasurable). An autosomal recessive disorder. 
In  general,  patients  with  Type  1  VWD  may  be  treated  satisfactorily  with  DDAVP,  which  releases 
endogenous vWF from endothelial cells, but for the other types of vWD use of a vWF/FVIII concentrate 
is  necessary  in  order  to  achieve  haemostasis  during  bleeds  or  surgery.  Fibrinolytic  inhibitors  such  as 
tranexamic acid are frequently also used during bleeds and surgery.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 
Description 
Study design 
Clinical  Study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  was  a  multicentre,  open-label,  single-arm,  phase  4,  post-marketing 
study  to  further  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  Voncento  in  subjects  with  VWD  in  whom 
treatment with a VWF product was required as on-demand therapy, as prophylactic therapy, or during 
surgery.  
The  study  was  performed  as  a  multicentre  study  at  12  centres  in  5  countries  (Austria,  Germany, 
Greece, Poland and the United Kingdom).  
Subjects  admitted  to  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  had  not  previously  taken  part  in  a  Voncento  /  Biostate 
study (see Exclusion criteria below). 
26 subjects were enrolled in this study of which: 
−  4 were children aged <12 years 
−  None were in the adolescent age range (12- <18 years) 
−  22 were adults (≥18years). (One adult was withdrawn by the sponsor as they had severe Type 2B 
and only patients with Types 1, 2A or 3 were eligible for inclusion.) 
Results from the pivotal Phase II/III study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 in VWD subjects aged ≥12 years as well 
as pivotal Phase III study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in paediatric VWD subjects age <12 years were taken into 
account  (see  Substantial  amendment  1  below)  in  the  design  of  this  study.    These  studies  were 
submitted  in  procedure  EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G  in  September  2014  to  support  routine 
prophylaxis in VWD and provided data from paediatric patients <12 years of age with VWD. 
 Assessor’s comment  
The  final  report  of  study  pivotal  Phase  II/III  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  was  submitted  in  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G. An interim report CSLCT-BIO-08-54 had been submitted at the time of 
the  MAA  supporting  on-demand  treatment  but  at  that  time,  there  were  data  on  routine  prophylaxis 
from  only  one 
subject.  Data  on 
routine  prophylaxis  were 
submitted 
in  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002493/II/0008/G. 
Substantial amendment 1 (27 Aug 2015) of the CSLCT-BIO-12-83 protocol 
This  was  issued  after  the  approval  by  the  EMA  on  24  July  2015  of  the  extension  of  the  indication  to 
include prophylactic treatment of patients with VWD and the product information update providing data 
on the treatment of paediatric patients with VWD.  
Main changes described in this amendment were the following: 
●  Prophylaxis  treatment  was  added  as  treatment  option  in  the  study,  resulting  in  various  changes 
throughout the protocol (number of bleeding events became a primary endpoint and the ABR was 
added  as  another  efficacy  variable;  new  rating  scale  introduced  to  allow  for  haemostasis 
assessment for prophylaxis subjects, prophylaxis dosing instructions as per updated SmPC). 
●  The removal of the age restriction i.e. also subjects aged < 12 years were allowed to enter. 
●  Voncento clinical development history and summary of post-marketing safety data were updated.

Page 8/47 
 
 
 
 
 
●  Overall study duration (i.e. first subject’s Screening  Visit to last subject’s End  of Study  Visit) was 
expected to be 2.5 years instead of 4. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective 
• 
To  collect  long-term  data  on  the  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  in  subjects  with  VWD  who 
require a VWF product to control a NSB (non-surgical bleeding) event or as prophylaxis therapy. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
• 
To assess the efficacy of Voncento in the prevention and treatment of surgical bleeding events. 
To  collect  long-term  data on  the  safety  of  Voncento  used  as  on-demand  therapy  to  treat  an  NSB 
event or as prophylaxis therapy. 
Primary Endpoints 
•  Subject’s and investigator’s subjective assessment of haemostatic efficacy of Voncento in its usage 
for an NSB event. 
•  Number of NSB events per 3-month interval and annual bleeding rate (ABR). 
•  Number of infusions and total dose of Voncento (in IU VWF:RCo) required to treat an NSB event. 
Assessments of haemostatic efficacy were based on a 4-point ordinal scale as outlined in Table 2. 
Table 2   Efficacy Grading Scale 
Bleeding  events  that  were  not  treated  with  Voncento  were  not  assessed  for  haemostatic  efficacy 
according to the grading scale, and thus were excluded from the haemostatic efficacy analysis. 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Subject’s  and  investigator’s  subjective  assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  as 
prophylaxis therapy. 
• 
Investigator’s  or  surgeon’s  assessment  of  blood  loss  during  a  surgical  event  and  an  overall 
haemostatic efficacy assessment by the investigator after the surgical procedure. 
•  Number  of  infusions  and  total  dose  of  Voncento  (in  IU  VWF:RCo)  required  to  treat  a  surgical 
bleeding event. 
•  Nature  and  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs),  including  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  AEs 
related to Voncento, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), and number of VWF and FVIII 
inhibitors which occur during the administration of Voncento as on demand therapy to treat an NSB 
or surgical bleeding event or as prophylaxis therapy.

•  Male  or  female  subjects  of  any  age  with  a  diagnosis  of  severe  Type  1,  2A,  or  3  VWD  where  von 
Willebrand Factor: Ristocetin Cofactor (VWF:RCo) was < 20% at Screening. 
•  Availability  of  detailed  subject  documentation  (e.g.  medical  record,  diary,  logbook)  covering  prior 
bleeding and VWD treatment history over the past 12 months prior to Screening. 
•  Subjects  where  DDAVP  treatment  was  ineffective  or  contraindicated.  In  countries  where  DDAVP 
was not available only subjects with Type 3 VWD were allowed to be enrolled. 
•  Subjects required a VWF product to control an NSB event or for ongoing prophylactic therapy. 
Main Exclusion Criteria 
•  A known history of VWF or FVIII inhibitors, or were suspected to have VWF or FVIII inhibitors.  
•  Known or suspected hypersensitivity or previous evidence of severe side effects to Voncento, VWF 
/ FVIII concentrates, or human albumin. 
• 
Previous  participation  in  a  Voncento  /  Biostate  study  (patients  can  also  not  be  enrolled  a  second 
time into the current study). 
Assessor’s comment  
Note  that  only  patients  who  had  not  previously  participated  in  a  Voncento  /  Biostate  study  could  be 
enrolled. 
Treatments 
The  dose  and  dose  frequency  were  determined  by  the  investigator  using  the  information  in  the 
Voncento    SmPC.  Voncento  was  administered  intravenously  as  a  bolus  dose  at  a  maximum  infusion 
rate of 6 mL/min as tolerated by the subject. 
Treatment regimens were as follows: 
•  On-demand regimen including the following: 
−  On-demand  treatment:  irregular  treatment  with  Voncento  of  a  non-surgical,  spontaneous,  or 
traumatic bleeding event. 
−  Prevention  treatment:  irregular  treatment  with  Voncento  to  prevent  an  anticipated  bleeding 
event  (e.g.  before  expected  physical  activity  that  might  be  associated  with  an  increased 
bleeding risk).  
• 
Prophylaxis regimen: regular treatment with Voncento at a frequency of 1 to 3 times per week. 
•  Surgery: In addition, Voncento was given to prevent and treat any surgical bleeding events. 
Subjects on prevention treatment or on a prophylaxis regimen were to take additional Voncento doses 
on-demand to treat an NSB event, as necessary. 
Assignment of Subjects to Treatment Groups

Based on the subject’s bleeding history and previous VWF treatment history (from the last 12 months 
prior to Screening), the investigator prescribed 1 of the 2 regimens to the subject to manage his / her 
VWD condition during the 12 months of study participation. 
●  On-demand regimen including the following: 
−  On-demand  treatment:  irregular  treatment  with  Voncento  of  a  non-surgical,  spontaneous,  or 
traumatic bleeding event. 
−  Prevention treatment: irregular treatment with Voncento to prevent an anticipated bleeding event 
(eg,  before  expected  physical  activity  that  was  associated  with  an  increased  bleeding  risk). 
Subjects on prevention treatment were to take additional Voncento doses on-demand to treat an 
NSB event, as necessary. 
●  Prophylaxis  regimen:  regular  treatment  with  Voncento  at  a  frequency  of  1  to  3  times  per  week. 
Subjects on a prophylaxis regimen were to take additional Voncento doses on-demand to treat an 
NSB event, as necessary. 
Subjects were allowed to switch from one regimen to the other at the discretion of the investigator. 
Doses 
On-demand treatment dose 
For both adult and paediatric subjects, usually 40 to 80 IU/kg of VWF:RCo corresponding to 20 to 40 
IU FVIII:C/kg of body weight were recommended to achieve haemostasis. 
An initial dose of 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may have been required, especially in subjects with Type 3 VWD 
where maintenance of adequate levels may have required greater doses than in other types of VWD. 
On-demand prevention dose 
For prevention of excessive bleeding during or after surgery the application was to start 1 to 2 hours 
before  the  surgical  procedure.  An  appropriate  dose  was  to  be  re-administered  every  12  to  24  hours. 
The  dose  and  duration  of  the  treatment  depended  on  the  clinical  status  of  the  subject,  the  type  and 
severity of the bleeding, and both VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels.  
Prophylaxis dose 
Adult and Adolescent Subjects (≥ 12 Years of Age) 
For  long-term  prophylaxis,  25  to  40  IU  of  VWF:RCo  per  kg  body  weight  was  to  be  considered  at  a 
frequency of 1 to 3 times per week. In subjects with gastrointestinal bleedings or menorrhagia, shorter 
dose intervals or higher doses were necessary.  The dose and duration of treatment depended on the 
clinical status of the subject, as well as their VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
Paediatric Subjects (< 12 Years of Age) 
Based on results from previous clinical Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, in which paediatric subjects aged <12 
years  were  shown  to  have  lower  exposure  of  VWF,  a  prophylactic  dose  range  of  40  to  80  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg body weight administered 1 to 3 times a week was to be considered. 
The  dose  and  duration  of  treatment  depended  on  the  clinical  status  of  the  subject,  as  well  as  their 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
Concomitant Therapy 
The following therapies were permitted during the study: 
•  Blood  product  transfusions  (this  included  whole  blood,  erythrocytes  and  platelets)  as  required  for 
emergency purposes and to prevent intra-/ postoperative complications. 
• 
• 
Paracetamol / acetaminophen for pain. 
Tranexamic acid. 
The following therapies were not permitted during the study:

•  Another VWF / FVIII concentrate or a recombinant VWF-containing product. 
•  DDAVP. 
• 
Plasma products containing coagulation factors (such as elective plasma). 
If  administration  of  any  prohibited  therapy  became  necessary  during  the  study  for  medical  reasons, 
the subject may have been withdrawn from further study participation. 
Efficacy Assessments 
•  Study product usage in the treatment of a bleeding event or a surgical procedure. 
•  Haemostasis assessment for each NSB event (by the investigator and the subject / legal guardian) 
and for each surgical bleeding (by the investigator) treated with Voncento  
•  Number of NSB events per 3-month interval and ABR. 
•  Blood product transfusion requirements. 
• 
Investigator’s or surgeon’s assessment of blood loss during a surgical procedure. 
Safety Assessments 
•  Nature and incidence of AEs, including SAEs, AEs related to Voncento, and AESIs.  
Bleeding events were not considered an AE. 
The following events were considered as AESIs: 
• 
• 
development of VWF / FVIII inhibitors, embolic and thrombotic events, hypersensitivity reactions, 
including anaphylaxis, transmission of infectious agents, and medication errors.  
Laboratory safety parameters: haematology, biochemistry, VWF and FVIII inhibitors, and VWF and 
FVIII:C levels. 
•  Vital signs, including height (Screening only) and weight. 
• 
Physical examination. 
•  Viral Serology testing 
•  Review of concomitant medications. 
•  Voncento  dosing  deviations  (±  20%  between  the  actual  administered  and  the  prescribed  dose), 
including overdose. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: 
Continuous  /  quantitative  variables  were  summarised  using  descriptive  statistics  which  included  the 
number of subjects with non-missing data (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), first quartile (Q1, 25th 
percentile),  median,  third  quartile  (Q3,  75th  percentile),  minimum,  and  maximum.  All  categorical  / 
qualitative data were summarised using frequency counts and percentage.  
The efficacy endpoints were analysed using the efficacy population as the primary population, and the 
per-protocol population as the secondary population. 
The Efficacy population included all subjects of the safety population who had at least 1 post-baseline 
assessment  for  haemostatic  efficacy  of  treatment  with  Voncento  or  assessment  for  prophylaxis 
treatment. 
Bleeding events that were not treated with Voncento were not assessed for haemostatic efficacy, and 
thus  were  excluded  from  the  haemostatic  efficacy  analysis.  Haemostatic  efficacy  for  NSB  events  was 
descriptively  summarised  by  number  and  percentage  of  NSB  events  for  each  efficacy  grade  for  the 
entire study period and for each 3- month time interval.

Safety:  
The Safety population comprised all subjects who received at least 1 dose of Voncento. 
Voncento doses were summarised using descriptive statistics as given above. 
Frequency  distributions  for  the  number  of  subjects  with  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs) 
are provided per MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.  
Laboratory  parameters,  vital  signs,  and  physical  examination  findings  were  also  descriptively 
summarised. 
Results 
Recruitment and Disposition of Subjects 
First Subject Visit was on 05 October 2015 and Last Subject Visit on 15 February 2018 
Screened:  28; 
Enrolled:  26:  
Treated:  25;   
Completed:  21 
Age distribution of the 25 subjects treated with Voncento: 
- 4 children (<12 years) 
- no adolescents (12- <18 years) 
- 14 adults (≥ 18years) 
Type of treatment regimen 
On demand (on-demand arm): 
11 subjects, (with 1 paediatric patient aged < 12 years) 
Prophylaxis regimen (prophylaxis arm): 
14 subjects (with 3 paediatric patients aged < 12 years) 
Of  the  28  subjects  who  were  screened,  2  subjects  were  screening  failures  (one  subject  did  not  fulfil 
entry criterion 4 regarding the required VWD severity, and the other subject fulfilled exclusion criterion 
regarding  a  known  history  or  suspicion  of  inhibitors).  Thus  26  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study 
and assigned to either the on-demand arm (12 subjects) or the prophylaxis arm (14 subjects). 
One subject in the on-demand arm with Type 2B VWD was enrolled by mistake (only VWD of Type 1, 
2A, or 3 was allowed) and his participation was terminated by the sponsor before any study drug was 
administered. 
All remaining 25 subjects were treated with Voncento. 
Discontinuations 
Four subjects in the prophylaxis arm discontinued the study and none in the on-demand arm.  
Reasons for discontinuation: 
●  Pregnancy, n=1 
●  Lost to follow-up, n=1 
●  Self-withdrawal, n=1: A female subject with Type 2A VWD, experienced 4 gastrointestinal bleeding 
events  during  the  study,  for  which  the  final  diagnosis  was  confirmed  as  small  intestine  
angiodysplasia.  After the subject was on the study for approximately 8 months she withdrew her 
informed consent and discontinued the study. 
●  Other, n=1:  According to additional information obtained from the investigator, this Subject  was 
not keen to continue with Voncento as she was concerned that it was not working sufficiently; she 
wanted to return to her previous treatment. 
All  11  subjects  in  the  on-demand  arm  and  10  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  completed  the  study. 
Thus, more than the required 20 subjects completed 12 months of treatment.

All 25 treated subjects were included in the safety population.  
The efficacy population was identical to the safety population as all treated subjects had at least one 
assessment for haemostatic efficacy. 
Nine treated subjects had at least 1 major protocol deviation and were therefore excluded from the PP 
population, which comprised 16 subjects in total, 8 subjects in each arm. 
Demographic and Baseline data 
Demographics 
The mean age of patients in the study (safety population was identical to the efficacy population), was 
35.8 years. There were 4 subjects (16.0%) aged < 12 years:  one in the on-demand arm and 3 in the 
prophylaxis arm (Table 3). 
The  majority  of  subjects  (84.0%  overall)  were  white,  and  no  subject  was  of  Hispanic  or  Latino 
ethnicity. 
Table 3 
Demographics 
Medical and Von Willebrand Disease History 
At  study  entry,  all  but  2  subjects  (92.0%),  both  in  the  prophylaxis  arm,  reported  a  medical  history 
aside from their VWD history, with no relevant differences between the treatment arms (Table 4). 
The  only  3  prior  diseases  reported  by  ≥  5  subjects  were  chronic  hepatitis  C,  arthropathy,  and  iron 
deficiency anaemia (5 subjects [20.0%] each). 
In both treatment arms, the majority of subjects had Type 3 VWD, with a lower proportion in the on-
demand arm (6 subjects [54.5%]) than in the prophylaxis arm (11 [78.6%]); 3 subjects in each arm 
(27.3% and 21.4%, respectively) had Type 2A VWD, and 2 additional subjects in the on-demand arm 
(18.2%) had Type 1 VWD.

 As per the exclusion criteria none of the subjects had a history of FVIII and VWF inhibition. 
The overall mean (SD) number of bleeding events during the 12 months prior to study entry was 8.6 
(8.63). 
Table 4 
Von Willebrand Disease History (Safety Population) 
Previous Von Willebrand Disease Treatment 
On-demand  arm  (n=11):  5  subjects  received  FVIII  concentrate  and  5  subjects  received  VWF 
concentrate  as  previous  VWD  treatment.  9  subjects  had  previously  received  the  FVIII  or  VWF 
concentrate as on-demand treatment and 1 subject as prophylaxis treatment.  
Prophylaxis arm (n=14): the majority (13 subjects) received VWF concentrate and 2 subjects received 
FVIII  concentrate  as  previous  VWD  treatment.  7  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  had  previously 
received their prior VWD treatment on-demand, while 10 subjects (71.4%) received it as prophylaxis 
(i.e. 3 subjects had received both regimens in the 12 months prior to study entry). 
Efficacy results 
Prophylaxis arm 
Number of non-surgical bleeds (NSB) – Primary endpoint 
The 14 subjects in the prophylaxis arm experienced a total of 78 NSB events.  
(Note  Assessor:  4  of  these  14  subjects  discontinued  for  various  reasons  as  described  under 
Recruitment and Disposition of Subjects.) 
The majority of the 78 NSB events were minor / moderate (89.7%), spontaneous (56.4%) or trauma-
induced (42.3%), mucosal (46.2%) or in the joint (20.5%). 
Five subjects had a total of 8 major NSB events (5 mucosal and 3 joint bleeding events) and 6 subjects 
had a total of 16 bleeding events in joints (13 minor / moderate and 3 major events); almost all these 
subjects had VWD of Type 3.

ABR:  The median (range) observed ABR was 4.36 (0.0 to 26.3) bleeding events per year per subject 
for total bleeding events, and 3.33 (0.0 to 11.3) for spontaneous bleeding events. 
These median ABRs were lower than the median number of NSB events during the 12 months prior to 
study entry, which were 6.5 (range: 0 to 34) and 4.5 (range: 0 to 13), respectively. 
Number of NSB events treated with Voncento 
Overall,  72  of  the  78  NSB  events  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  were  treated  with  Voncento,  predominantly 
with 1 infusion (51 events [70.8%]). 
Haemostatic efficacy – primary endpoint 
The  haemostatic  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  either  excellent  or  good  for  the  vast 
majority  of  NSB  events  (64  [88.9%]);  for  the  remaining  8  events  (11.1%),  the  haemostatic  efficacy 
was assessed as moderate (Table 5). For the entire study and each 3-month interval, the investigator 
rated the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento administered as prophylaxis mostly as excellent (> 64% of 
subjects given time interval).  
Subjects  assessed  the  haemostatic  efficacy  as  excellent  for  52  bleeding  days  (24.0%),  good  for  45 
days (20.7%), and moderate for 14 days (6.5%) (Table 6). The subject assessment of the remaining 
106  rated  bleeding  days  (48.8%)  was  “none”,  all  by  1  subject.  Please  be  referred  to  the  narrative  
below  for  this  subject.  For  the  entire  study  and  each  3-month  interval,  the  subjects  rated  the 
haemostatic efficacy of Voncento administered as prophylaxis mostly as excellent or good.

Table 6  Subjects’ Assessment of Haemostatic Efficacy per Day on Non-Surgical Bleeding 
Event – Prophylaxis Arm (Efficacy Population; N = 14) 
Subject   ( Assessor’s summary of the patient narrative in the CSR) 
This subject was a female with Type 2A VWD in the prophylaxis arm assigned to a prophylaxis regimen 
of  34  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  twice  a  week.  She  had  a  history  of  anaemia  and  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage 
since  the  1990’s,  uterine  leiomyoma  since  2010,  and  haemorrhoids  since  2015.    She  had  no  recent 
surgery and no history of inhibitor development. 
This subject had experienced 4 spontaneous bleeding episodes during the 12 months prior to the study 
that  were  treated  on-demand  with  a  VWF  concentrate  (Fanhdi®)  to  which,  as  per  the  investigator’s 
judgement, she had not responded. 
During the study, the subject experienced 4 events of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (3 major 
and  1  minor  /  moderate  event).  The  investigator  assessed  the  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  as 
moderate for each of these 4 bleeding events.  
The subject assessed the haemostatic efficacy on each of the 106 rated bleeding days as “none”. She 
withdrew her informed consent when she experienced lack of response, after 8 months on study and 
experiencing these 4 bleeding events. 
The  investigator  suspected  another  pathway  as  bleeding  reason,  because  the  subject  had  a  sufficient 
FVIII:C  level  and  high  VWF:Ag  levels.  An  initial  judgment  specified  haemorrhagic  diathesis  as  the 
primary reason of the bleeds. The final diagnosis causing the gastrointestinal bleedings was confirmed 
as small intestine angiodysplasia.  
On-demand arm 
Number of non-surgical bleeds (NSB) – Primary endpoint 
The 11 subjects in the on-demand arm experienced a total of 82 NSB events. 
All were minor / moderate in severity, 87.8% spontaneous, and 62.2% mucosal bleeds.  
Four (4.9%) of the 82 reported events occurred in joints.  
ABR:   The median (range) observed ABR was 2.99 (0.0 to 24.6) bleeding events per year per subject 
for all NSB events, and 0.95 (0.0 to 24.6) for spontaneous bleeding events. 
These median ABRs were lower than the median number of NSB events during the 12 months prior to 
study entry, which were 4.0 (range: 0 to 20) and 2.0 (range: 0 to 18), respectively.

Number of NSB events treated with Voncento 
Overall,  69  of  the  82  NSB  events  in  the  on-demand  arm  were  treated  with  Voncento,  predominantly 
with 1 infusion (38 events [55.1%]). 
Haemostatic efficacy – primary endpoint 
The haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator as either excellent or good for the majority 
of  NSB  events  (58  [84.1%]);  for  the  remaining  11  events  (15.9%),  the  haemostatic  efficacy  was 
assessed as moderate Table 7. 
The subjects assessed the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento as excellent for 14 bleeding days (10.0%), 
good for 77 bleeding days (55.0%), and moderate for the remaining 49 days (35.0%).

Table 8   Subjects’ Assessment of Haemostatic Efficacy per Bleeding Day – On-Demand Arm 
(Efficacy Population; N = 11) 
Assessor’s comment: 
Bleeding rates 
It is noted that the ABR was calculated using the number of treated bleeds and not the total number of 
bleeds. Thus the ABR was defined as: 
(the number of treated bleeding events) / (duration of treatment period) × 365.25. 
However,  this  is  not  of  major  significance  as  the  total  number  of  bleeds  per  arm  was  not  much 
different from the number of treated bleeds per arm (82 total vs 69 treated in the on-demand arm; 78 
total vs 72 treated in the prophylaxis arm).  
Also,  as  4  patients  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  had  discontinued,  the  calculated  ABR  per  subject  gives  a 
better estimation of the number of bleeds over 12 months than the mean or median number of events 
per subject while on study. 
Blood Product Transfusion Requirements 
Two  subjects  in  the  efficacy  population,  both  from  the  prophylaxis  arm,  required  blood  product 
transfusion. 
•  One female Subject required transfusions for 3 of the 4 mucosal  bleeds that she experienced: 
5 units of erythrocytes and 6 units of platelets for a major spontaneous mucosal bleeding event in 
the  gastrointestinal  tract,  3  units  of  erythrocytes  for  a  minor  /  moderate  spontaneous  mucosal 
bleeding  /  blood  in  stool,  and  1  unit  of  erythrocytes  for  a  major  spontaneous  mucosal  bleeding  / 
blood in stool. 
•  One female Subject required 200 mL of red blood cells for a major spontaneous mucosal bleeding 
event in the stomach. 
Surgical events 
There  were  13  surgical  events  overall  and  all  but  1  event  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  were  assessed  for 
haemostatic efficacy by the investigator :

●  9 events in the on-demand arm for which the haemostatic efficacy was assessed as either excellent 
(44.4% of events) or good (55.6%).  
Blood loss was assessed by the surgeon or the investigator as equivalent to that expected in 8 of 
these 9 surgical events. 
●  4 in the prophylaxis arm for which the haemostatic efficacy for all 3 assessed events was rated as 
excellent. 
Blood loss was assessed by the surgeon or the investigator as equivalent to that expected in 2 of 
these surgical events. 
Blood  loss  during  surgical  events  was  assessed  by  the  surgeon  or  the  investigator  as  less  than 
expected  in  one  event  in  each  treatment  arm  and  this  assessment  was  missing  for  1  event  in  the 
prophylaxis arm. 
Assessor’s comment  
The numbers on surgery are somewhat confusing.  
The Voncento usage data for surgery in Table 9 below summarise numbers of Voncento infusions over 
4 subjects in the on-demand arm and 4 subjects in the prophylaxis arm. 
Overall,  from  the  summarised  data  in  the  CSR  it  is  not  clear  how  many  surgical  procedures  each 
subject underwent. 
However,  some  information  on  treatment  administration  during  surgery  form  Table  14.1.5.2.2  and 
information on surgery in Listings 16.2.6.3.1  / 16.2.6.3.2  are summarised in the following table.  
From the Listings, no blood product transfusions were given in association with surgical procedures. 
It  can  be  concluded  that  in  10  surgical  procedures  where  Voncento  was  given,  haemostatic  efficacy 
was  rated  as  excellent  in  6  (which  included  an  appendectomy  and  a  tonsillectomy)  and  good  in  the 
other 4 (which included a knee replacement and 3 minor procedures).

Paediatric subjects 
Surgery in children <12 years is not discussed in the CSLCT-BIO-12-83 CSR, however, again from the 
listings  it  can  be  seen  that  2  subjects  <12  years  old  underwent  surgery  for  which  both  received 
Voncento: 
−  a  2  year  old  girl  had  a  tympanostomy  (minor  planned  procedure)  with  haemostasis  rated  as 
excellent 
−  an 8 year old girl had a major tooth extraction but there was no rating for haemostasis given. 
Conclusion 
These  data  show  that  overall  haemostatic  efficacy  in  relation  to  surgical  procedures  was  rated  as 
excellent or good in the 7 subjects aged ≥18 years and excellent in the one subject aged <12 years for 
whom  a  rating  was  given.  As  only  2  children  <12  years  received  Voncento  before  or  during  their 
procedure, no conclusion specific to this age group can be drawn. 
Overall  it  can  be  concluded  that  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  was  acceptable  in  VWD  patients 
undergoing surgical procedures.  
Voncento Usage by reason for administration 
Usage  of  Voncento  per  subject  by  reason  for  administration  is  summarised  in  Table  9  and  usage  per 
bleed is summarised in Table 10.

Prophylaxis  regimen:  Most  of  the  14  subjects  were  assigned  a  prophylactic  regimen  of  an  infusion 
every  2  days  (n=7)  or  every  3  days  (n=3).  For  a  further  3  subjects  a  frequency  of  “other”  was 
assigned and for one the assigned regimen was daily. 
In  the  prophylaxis  arm,  the  median  (range)  number  of  infusions  of  Voncento  administered  as 
prophylaxis  was  102.5  (25  to  164)  and  the  median  (range)  prophylaxis  dose  per  infusion  was  37.6 
(25.5 to 108.0) IU VWF:RCo/kg.  
Treatment  of  a  bleeding  event:    All  but  2  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  received  Voncento  for  a 
bleeding  event.  the  median  (range)  number  of  such  infusions  was  7.0  (2  to  59)  and  the  median 
(range) dose per infusion 43.6 (30.0 to 183.0) IU VWF:RCo/kg. 
Prevention prior to physical activity: 3 subjects in the prophylaxis arm also received a median (range) 
number  of  1.0  (1  to  8)  infusion  with  a  median  (range)  dose  per  infusion  of  62.0  (40.0  to  71.0)  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg.  
Surgery: 4 subjects received a median (range) number of 3.0 (1 to 6) infusions and a median (range) 
dose per infusion of 72.0 (40.8 to 233.3) IU VWF:RCo/kg during surgery. 
On-demand arm 
Treatment of a bleeding event:  All but 1 subject received Voncento for a bleeding event (Table 9).  
The  median  (range)  number  of  infusions  administered  per  subject  for  bleeding  events  was  5.0  (1  to 
48) and the median (range) dose per infusion was 47.5 (31.2 to 115.5) IU VWF:RCo/kg. 
Prevention  prior  to  physical  activity:  6  subjects  in  the  on-demand  arm  received  a  median  (range) 
number  of  3.0  (1  to  45) infusions  with  a  median  (range)  dose  per  infusion  of  42.5  (27.0 to 66.0)  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg. 
Surgery:  4  subjects  received  a  median  (range)  number  of  14.0  (6  to  29)  infusions  and  a  median 
(range) dose per infusion of 42.8 (33.8 to 114.6) IU VWF:RCo/kg during surgery.

Usage of Voncento per Treated Non-Surgical Bleeding Event (Primary endpoint) 
Prophylaxis arm 
In  the  prophylaxis  arm,  the  median  number  of  infusions  administered  per  bleeding  event  was  1.0 
infusion  (range:  1  to  30),  with  a  median  total  Voncento  dose  per  bleeding  event  of  160.0  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg (range: 30 to 1020 IU VWF:RCo/kg) Table 10.  
Of  the  72  treated  NSB  events  in  the  prophylaxis  arm,  51  (70.8%)  required  treatment  with  only  1 
infusion  of  Voncento  and  16  events  (22.2%)  treatment  with  >  2  infusions.  ,  a  woman  with  Type  2A 
VWD,  experienced  a  minor  /  moderate  spontaneous  mucosal  bleeding  event  in  the  gastrointestinal 
tract that required treatment with 30 infusions. 
On-demand arm 
The median number of infusions administered per bleeding event was 1.0 infusion (range: 1 to 21) in 
the  on-demand  arm,  with  a  median  total  Voncento  dose  per  bleeding  event  of  54.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg 
(range: 24 to 662 IU VWF:RCo/kg)  Table 10. 
Of  the  69  treated  NSB  events  in  the  on-demand  arm,  38  (55.1%)  required  treatment  with  only  1 
Voncento  infusion  and  21  events  (30.4%)  treatment  with  >  2  infusions.  One  subject  (male  Subject  
with Type 3 VWD) experienced a minor / moderate spontaneous joint bleeding event (right ankle) that 
required treatment with 21 infusions.

(CSR table 11-16)  
Dose Adjustment 
One  subject  (9.1%)  in  the  on-demand  arm  and  6  subjects  (42.9%)  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  required 
dose adjustments. The reason for dose adjustment for the 1 subject in the on-demand arm was lack of 
efficacy.  
For  the  6  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  the  main  reasons  were  investigator’s  decision  (4  subjects) 
and “other” (2 subjects, due to weight change. 
Assessor’s comment 
Concerning doses (number of infusions administered = primary endpoint) 
• 
For  the  treatment  of  a  bleeding  event,  overall  most  bleeding  events  (~63%)  were  treated 
adequately  with  only  one  infusion  of  Voncento,  but  the  proportion  treated  with  one  infusion  was 
lower for bleeds in the on-demand arm (~55%) than in the prophylaxis arm (~71%) (Table 10). 
This somewhat lower usage of Voncento per bleeding event in the prophylaxis arm seems plausible 
as patients on routine prophylaxis may have an ongoing higher plasma level of VWF at the time of 
occurrence of a bleed than patients on an on-demand regimen. 
• 
The  median  dose  (IU  VWF:RCo/kg)  per  infusion  given  for  the  treatment  of  a  bleeding  event  was  
47.5 (range 31.2 - 115.5) in the on-demand arm and 43.6 (range 30.0 - 183.0) in the prophylaxis 
arm (Table 9). These median doses are within the range recommended in the Voncento SmPC (40 
- 80 IU/kg) to achieve haemostasis for both the adult and paediatric population. The median dose 
37.6 (range 25.5 - 108.0) given for routine prophylaxis falls within the ranges recommended in the 
Voncento SmPC for subjects 12 to 18 years old (25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo /kg) and  within the higher 
dose recommendation for the younger age group of paediatric subjects who are <12 years old (40 
– 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg). 
Dose adjustments 
The assigned frequency of dosing for routine prophylaxis was every 2 or 3 days (as recommended in 
the  Voncento  SmPC)  for  most  of  the  14  subjects  (every  2  days  (n=7);  every  3  days  (n=3)).  For  a 
further  3  subjects  a  frequency  of  “other”  was  assigned  and  for  one  the  assigned  regimen  was  daily. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012 
EMA/469594/2019  
Page 23/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After  the  dose  adjustments  referred  to  above  for  patients  on  routine  prophylaxis,  their  regimens  still 
remained within the dose recommendations in the Voncento SmPC. 
The on-demand subject with dose adjustment was a woman whose on-demand dose had already been 
increased to 130 IU VWF:RCo/kg from her assigned dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg. A minor increase from 
130  to  133    IU  VWF:RCo/kg  was  given  to  improve  control  of  moderate  menstrual  bleeding  which 
stopped after one administration of this dose on the 3rd menstrual day (response rated as moderate). 
Efficacy for other events for that subject had been rated as good. Although the dose given was quite 
high, this case is not considered to raise concern as control of menstrual bleeding in subjects with VWD 
may be difficult.  
It should also be kept in mind that the actual VWF content in a vial may vary while remaining within 
the labelled nominal potency, although this aspect was (apparently) not evaluated in this case. 
Doses used during surgery 
The  recommendation  for  use  of  Voncento  to  control  bleeding  in  relation  to  surgery  is  that  an 
appropriate  dose  should  be  re-administered  every  12  -  24  hours.  The  dose  and  duration  of  the 
treatment depend on the clinical status of the patient, the type and severity of the bleeding, and both 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels. 
The information in Table 9 on use of Voncento in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 during surgery is of limited 
value  as  the  number  of  infusions  is  given  per  subject,  but  subjects  underwent  more  than  one 
procedure. 
The 9 surgical procedures in the on-demand arm were performed in 4 patients and Voncento was used 
in  8  of  the  9  procedures.  Thus,  the  number  of  infusions  per  subject  in  the  on-demand  arm  (median 
14.0 range (6 - 29)) is not informative.  
In  the  prophylaxis  arm,  3  of  4  subjects  with  surgery  received  Voncento  for  the  procedure  and  the 
median number per subject was 3.0 (range 1 - 6)).  
The median doses per infusion for surgery were 42.8 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 33.8 - 114.6) in the on-
demand arm and 72.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg (40.8 - 233.3) in the prophylaxis arm. These median values are 
not  unexpected  when  compared  with  the  recommended  dose  for  treatment  of  bleeding  events, 
although the upper limit of these ranges in the prophylaxis arm are very high. 
Conclusion 
Overall  the  doses  used  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  were  broadly  within  or  close  to  the  doses 
recommended in the Voncento SmPC.  
However,  the  upper  limit  of  the  range  for  doses  given  for  bleeds  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  (183.0  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg) and for surgery in the prophylaxis arm (233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg) are considered to be very 
high compared to a usual maximum recommended dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg. As medication error is 
defined  as  an  AESI  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  and  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  Voncento  RMP,  the  MAH 
was requested to clarify these high doses, separately for patients ≥18 years and those <12 years, and 
to evaluate whether they may have been due to a medication error. 
The  lower  limits  of  the  ranges  of  doses  used  are  not  considered  to  be  of  concern  as  they  are  in  line 
with the recommended lower dose ranges. 
In response to the 1st RSI, the MAH provided the requested information.  The doses used are shown in 
the tables below.

The  information  provided by  the  MAH  clarifies  that the  very  high  doses  of  183.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  and 
(233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg were confined to one patient with Type 3 VWD and were apparently a decision 
of  the  physician,  who  had  prescribed  both  recommended  and  higher  doses  for  routine  prophylaxis 
during the study and who had also prescribed somewhat higher than recommended prophylaxis doses 
for this child before she took part in the study. No other subject (with the exception of an adult subject 
who received 108 IU/kg for treatment of a bleeding event) received doses outside the recommended 
range. 
Overall  there  are  no  indications  that  there  was  a  dosing  error  in  the  2  year  old  subject or  that  there 
were dosing errors throughout the study. 
However, the study findings do not rule out the possibility of medication errors which is still considered 
to be relevant in the real-life situation.

Efficacy in subgroups age ≥18 years and < 12 Years   
Prophylaxis 
Age Group  ≥18 years 
Haemostatic Efficacy prophylaxis 
Similarly to the on-demand arm, the prophylaxis arm included no adolescent subjects (aged 12 to 18 
years); therefore 11 adult subjects (≥ 18 years) were included. These subjects experienced a total of 
45  NSB  events,  the  majority  of  which  were  minor  /  moderate  (38  [84.4%]),  spontaneous  (37 
[82.2%]), and either mucosal (27 [60.0%]) or in the joint (14 [31.1%]).  
Major bleeds: Seven of the 8 major bleeds occurred in patients aged  ≥18 years (CSR Table 11-12). 
Of  the  45  reported  NSB  events,  39  events  were  treated  with  Voncento  and  assessed  for  haemostatic 
efficacy  by  the  investigator.  For  32  (82.1%)  events,  the  haemostatic  efficacy  was  rated  as  either 
excellent or good. 
The adult subjects in the prophylaxis arm assessed the haemostatic efficacy for each bleeding day as 
excellent for 21 days (11.4%), as good for 43 days (23.4%), as moderate for 14 days (7.6%), and as 
none for 106 days (57.6%). All ratings of “none” were from Subject described above. 
The  median  ABR  in  the  adult  subjects  of  the  prophylaxis  arm  was  4.71  bleeds  per  year  (range:  0  to 
11.3). 
Voncento  usage 
The  median  number  of  infusions  per  bleed  was  1.0  (range:  1  to  30),  and  the  median  total  Voncento 
dose per bleed was 80.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 30 to 1020 IU VWF:RCo/kg). 
Paediatrics Age Group < 12 Years 
Hemostatic Efficacy prophylaxis 
The prophylaxis arm included 3 subjects < 12 years of age. The 3 subjects experienced a total of 33 
NSB  events.  Of  these,  32  events  were  minor  /  moderate  and  one  was  major  bleed,  7  were 
spontaneous,  and  26  trauma-induced.  The  bleeding  location  was  mucosal  for  9  bleeds,  muscle  for  5 
bleeds, joint for 2 bleeds, and “other” for 17 bleeds ( CSR Table 11-17).  
Major bleeds: One major bleed was reported, which was in a female with Type 3 VWD (CSR Table 11-
12). This was a spontaneous Gastrointestinal tract / Mucosal / Stomach bleed treated in hospital with 2 
infusions of 73 IU VWF:RCo/kg. The investigator rated efficacy as moderate. 
The haemostatic efficacy for the 33 treated NSB events was assessed by the investigator as excellent 
for 32 events (97.0%) and as moderate for the 1 remaining event (3.0%). The subject’s assessment of 
haemostatic efficacy per bleeding day was either excellent (93.9% of assessed days) or good (6.1%). 
The median observed ABR was 3.76 bleeding events per year. 
Voncento usage 
The  paediatric  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  received  a  median  number  of  1.0  infusion  per  NSB 
event (range: 1 to 3) and a median total Voncento dose per event of 171.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range: 40 
to 554 IU VWF:RCo/kg). 
On-Demand 
Age Group  ≥18 years 
Haemostatic Efficacy on-demand 
With  the  exception  of  the  1  subject  aged  <  12  years,  all  other  subjects  in  the  on-demand  arm  were 
adults. Hence, the efficacy results in these 10 adult subjects were very similar to those described in for 
the  overall  on-demand  arm.  The  10  adult  subjects  experienced  a  total  of  78  NSB  events.  Of  the  78 
NSB events, 65 events were treated with Voncento and were assessed for haemostatic efficacy.

(Assessor’s  Note:  investigator  efficacy ratings  overall  for  the on-demand  arm  (69  treated  bleeds  in 
11  subjects)  per  number  of  bleeds  were  31.9%  excellent,  52.2%  good  and  15.9%  moderate  (Table 
7)). The median ABR in the adult subjects of the on-demand arm was 2.44 bleeds per year (range: 0 
to 24.6). 
Voncento usage  
The median number of infusions per NSB event was 1.0 (range: 1 to 21). 
The  median  total  Voncento  dose  per  event  was  50.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  (range:  24  to  662  IU 
VWF:RCo/kg). 
Paediatric  Age Group < 12 Years 
Hemostatic Efficacy on-demand  
The on-demand arm included 1 subject < 12 years of age  who experienced 4 NSB events which were 
treated with Voncento. The events, 1 joint and 3 muscle bleeding events (haematomas), were minor / 
moderate  and  trauma-induced.  The  subject  attended  the  site  for  each  of  the 4  trauma-induced  NSBs 
and  therefore  had  all  daily  efficacy  assessments  completed  at  the  site  by  the  investigator.  The 
haemostatic  efficacy  for  the  4  NSB  events  in  this  single  subject  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
excellent.  
The treatment duration for the subject was 376.0 days, resulting in an ABR of 3.89 bleeding events per 
year. 
Voncento usage  
The haematomas were treated with 8, 1, and 2 infusions of Voncento, respectively, and the joint bleed 
with  4  infusions.  The  median  total  Voncento  dose  per  bleeding  event  was  177.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg 
(range: 54 to 432 IU VWF:RCo/kg). 
Assessor’s Comment 
As  there  was  only  one  subject  aged  <12  years  treated  with  an  on-demand  regimen,  no  meaningful 
comment  on  a  comparison  with  regard  to  efficacy  according  to  age  ≥18  years  or  <12  years  can  be 
made. 
Safety results 
Exposure 
The  mean  (SD)  duration  of  the  treatment  period  was  375.5  (9.36)  days  in  the  on-demand  arm  and 
322.8 (96.13) days in the prophylaxis arm. 
All  11  treated  subjects  in  the  on-demand  arm  and  all  10  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  who 
completed the study had a treatment period of at least 364 days, i.e. 12 months. 
The  mean  (SD)  number  of  exposure  days  was  24.5  (25.59)  days  in  the  on-demand  arm  and  102.3 
(46.82) days in the prophylaxis arm.

  Table 11   Drug Exposure (Safety Population) 
Assessor’s Comment 
Note that the mean duration of the treatment period was lower in the prophylaxis arm than in the on-
demand arm but the median duration was similar. This can be explained by the fact that 4 patients in 
the prophylaxis arm discontinued, all of whom were >18 years old (reasons: pregnancy, lost to follow-
up, subject decision and diagnosis of intestinal angiodysplasia). 
The 4 subjects who discontinued had been in the study for durations of 8, 6, 5 and 5 months (Listing 
16.2.1.2), thus also providing some data for estimation of an ABR. 
All 4 subjects aged <12 years (one in the on-demand arm and 3 in the prophylaxis arm) completed the 
study, i.e. reached  a treatment period of 12 months. 
Adverse Events 
Summary of Adverse Events 
Overall, 19 subjects (76.0%) had at least 1 TEAE during the study (Table 13  and Table 13):  
•  7 subjects (63.6%) in the on-demand arm  reported 13 TEAEs and  
•  12 subjects (85.7%) in the prophylaxis arm reported 84 TEAEs.  
Most subjects experienced either mild (13 subjects [52.0%]) or moderate (4 subjects [16.0%]) TEAEs. 
Overall, 2 subjects each reported TEAEs of diarrhoea, nausea, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity 
and cough. The only TEAE reported by >2 subjects overall was nasopharyngitis (3 subjects [12.0%]). 
Two  subjects  (in  the  prophylaxis  arm)  experienced  severe  TEAEs  each  of  abdominal  pain  and  pain  in 
extremity. 
The  most  frequently  affected  system  organ  classes  (>  25%  of  subjects  overall)  were  infections  and 
infestations (9 subjects [36.0%]) and gastrointestinal disorders (7 [28.0%]).

Relatedness of TEAEs 
One  subject  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  (female  Subject    with  Type  3  VWD)  experienced  15  non-serious 
TEAEs  considered  related  to  study  treatment  (9  events  of  headache  and  6  events  of  injection  site 
pain). All these events were non-serious and mild in intensity; they resolved within a maximum of 14 
hours. 
In the on-demand arm there were no TEAEs considered by the investigator to be treatment-related.  
Serious TEAEs / Discontinuations / Deaths 
• 
Two subjects reported 3 serious TEAEs none of which were assessed as being related to the study 
drug:  
•  2 events of asthma in 1 subject of the on-demand arm  
•  1  event  of  severe  abdominal  pain,  in  1  subject  of  the  prophylaxis  arm  (female  Subject  
mentioned above). This event was not considered related to Voncento by the investigator. She 
underwent appendectomy and the event was considered resolved. 
•  No TEAEs leading to study discontinuation or death occurred during the study.  
Assessor’s comment 
There was a high number of TEAEs in the prophylaxis arm (84 TEAEs in 12 subjects) compared to the 
on-demand arm (13 TEAEs in 7 subjects). It seems likely that this was due to the higher exposure to 
Voncento  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  (median  106.5  exposure  days,  range  31-182)  compared  to  the  on-
demand arm (median 15.0 exposure days, range 3 – 83). The lower exposure in the on-demand arm 
can  also  be  seen  in  that  9/11  (81.8%)  of  the  subjects  had  <50  exposure  days  compared  to  the 
prophylaxis arm in which subjects  8/14 (57.1%) had >100 exposure days. 
The TEAEs which were reported at a higher frequency in the prophylaxis arm were (by System 
Organ  Class),  Infections  and  infestations  (~43%  vs  27%),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (~43%  vs  9%), 
Nervous system disorders (~29% vs 9%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders C9%) and 
General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (~21%  vs  none)  (Table  13).  Although  some  of 
these  events  could  occur  in  a  patient  on  treatment  with  a  coagulation  factor,  e.g.  Gastrointestinal 
disorder (e.g. bleeding), headache, administration site conditions, it is reassuring that severe, serious 
or AESIs occurred at a similar rate and very infrequently in both arms (Table 12). Also there were no 
TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal. 
Treatment related TEAE 
One subject reported treatment-related AEs in the prophylaxis arm. These were 15 non-serious TEAEs, 
all  mild  in  intensity  resolved  within  a  maximum  of  14  hours  [9  events  of  headache  and  6  events  of 
injection site pain in a female Subject  with Type 3 VWD.] 
Headache is mentioned in Voncento SmPC Section 4.8 and although injection site pain is not, it is not 
considered to be an unexpected event. 
No treatment related AEs were reported in the on-demand arm. 
It can be noted that most of the TEAEs occurred in adult patients, with 67 TEAEs in 9 subjects in the 
prophylaxis arm and 13 TEAEs in 7 subjects in the on-demand arm  (CSR Table 14.3.1.2)

AESIs 
No VWF and FVIII inhibitors occurred during the study. 
Two subjects, both in the prophylaxis arm, each experienced 1 event reported in the CSR as an AESI  
as follows: 
•  A  male  subject    had  contact  dermatitis  that  started  54  days  after  the  first  prophylactic  dose  of 
Voncento. It resolved 9 days after its onset, following administration of an antihistamine 
•  A female subject  had face swelling. It resolved 5 days after its onset. 
Both  AESI  events  was  non-serious,  mild  in  intensity,  and  not  considered  related  to  Voncento  by  the 
investigator.  
Assessor’s comment 
It is not clear why the event of face swelling reported in a female was reported as an AESI, although 
presumably  this  is  because  facial  swelling  can  be  a  manifestation  of  a  hypersensitivity  reaction. 
However,  according  to  the  case  narrative,  this  non-serious  event  occurred  275  days  after  the  first 
prophylactic  dose  of  Voncento.  The  Voncento  dose  and  dosing  regimen  were  not  changed  and  the 
subject completed the study approximately 3 months after the event. Therefore it seems unlikely that 
a hypersensitivity reaction related to Voncento had occurred. 
It  seems  that  the  event  of  contact  dermatitis  may  have  been  mentioned  as  an  AESI  because  of  the 
possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction. Based on the available information this cannot be established. 
However  both  above  mentioned  AESI  events  were  non-serious,  mild  in  intensity,  and  not  considered 
related to Voncento by the investigator.  
Lack of Efficacy 
As  described  in  the  Efficacy  Section  of  this  AR,  a  female  with  Type  2A  VWD,  experienced  4 
gastrointestinal bleeding events during the study, for which she assessed the haemostatic efficacy on 
each  of  the  total  of  106  rated  bleeding  days  as  “none”.    The  final  diagnosis  for  the  gastrointestinal 
bleeding events was confirmed as small intestine  angiodysplasia. 
After the subject was on the study for 238 days (approximately 8 months), she withdrew her informed 
consent and discontinued the study. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation and Vital signs 
No clinically relevant findings were seen in vital signs. Few subjects had shifts from normal at baseline 
to abnormal during the study for any clinical laboratory parameter. 
Haematology 
Below  is  a  summary  of  cases  of  abnormally  low  haematology  parameters  that  were  considered  to  be 
clinically significant. 
•  A d male subject (VWD Type 2A) in the on-demand arm: low erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume  
(MCV)  at  Months  3,  6  and  12  which  was  the  subject’s  last  laboratory  assessment.  The  baseline 
value was low but within the reference range.  
•  A female subject (VWD Type 2A, also small intestine  angiodysplasia) in the prophylaxis arm: low 
haematocrit and haemoglobin at Month 3. Values were normal again at subsequent visits. 
• 
female subject (VWD Type 3) in the prophylaxis arm: low erythrocyte count value on Day 1 (note: 
the screening assessment was considered baseline for this subject). The subject did not have any 
laboratory  assessments  after  Day  1  and  was  withdrawn  from  study  on  Day  155  due  to  loss  to 
follow-up.

•  A  male  subject  (VWD  Type  3)  in  the  prophylaxis  arm:  low  erythrocyte  count  and  haematocrit    at 
Month 12, the subject’s last laboratory assessment. 
•  A  male  subject  (VWD  Type  2A)  in  the  prophylaxis  arm:  low  erythrocyte  count  at  Month  9.  The 
value returned to normal at Month 12. 
Biochemistry 
No subjects had shifts from normal at baseline to abnormal and clinically significant during the study 
for any biochemistry parameters. 
Adverse Events by Age Groups 
Paediatric data - Patients aged <12 years 
Three of the 4 subjects aged < 12 years, all in the prophylaxis arm reported a total of 17 TEAEs which 
were mostly characteristic for this age group.  
There was one AESI reported for a female Subject  who had face swelling (also mentioned above under 
AESIs)  which  started  275  days  after  the  first  prophylactic  dose  of  Voncento.  This  event  was  non-
serious,  mild  in  intensity,  and  not  considered  related  to  Voncento  by  the  investigator).  It  resolved  5 
days after its onset. 
None  of  the  TEAEs  were  reported  by  >1  subject  aged  <12  years.  Reported  TEAEs  of  pyrexia, 
bronchitis, ear infection, otitis media, tongue biting, compulsive lip biting, contusion, swelling face, and 
face injury only occurred in this age group and mostly are particularly common in young children. The 
other TEAEs reported in this age group were nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, and cough. 
Patients aged ≥18 years 
Among the 21 subjects aged ≥18 years, 16 subjects (76.2%) (7 subjects in the on-demand arm and 9 
subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm),  had  a  total  of  80  TEAEs,  with  nasopharyngitis,  nausea,  headache, 
arthralgia, and pain in extremity being the only TEAEs reported by 2 subjects overall. The distribution 
of TEAEs was similar to that in the overall safety population. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy Discussion 
Haemostatic efficacy 
With reference to the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, bleeding events that were not treated 
with Voncento were not assessed for haemostatic efficacy according to the grading scale described in 
Table 2, and thus were excluded from the haemostatic efficacy analysis. 
Haemostatic efficacy was rated per bleed by the investigator and per bleeding day by the subject. 
Investigator assessment: Overall efficacy in the treatment of NSB events was rated by the investigator 
as excellent or good in most bleeds in both arms.  
• 
• 
In the prophylaxis arm (n=72 treated bleeds) the investigator ratings were 81.9% excellent, 6.9% 
good and 11.1% moderate (Table 5).  
In the on-demand arm (n=69 treated bleeds the investigator ratings were 31.9% excellent and 
52.2% good and 15.9% moderate (Table 7). 
Subject assessment: The very high overall number of subject efficacy ratings of “none”, due to subject  
with intestinal angiodysplasia, distorts the evaluation of subject efficacy ratings over all days. 
Therefore the subject efficacy for Bleed Day 1 is discussed here. 
• 
In the prophylaxis arm (overall 217 assessments/bleeding days): on Bleeding Day 1 (n=67 first 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012 
EMA/469594/2019  
Page 32/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
days), subjects efficacy rating was excellent for 46/67 (68.7%) days, good for 14/67 (20.9%) days 
and moderate for 4/67 (6.0%)  (Table 6). 
• 
In the on-demand arm (overall 140 assessments/bleeding days): on Bleeding Day 1 (n=58 first 
days), subject efficacy rating was excellent for 3/58 (5.2%) days, good for 37/58 (63.8%) days 
and moderate for 18/58 (31.0%) (Table 8). 
Similar to the investigator haemostatic efficacy ratings, the subject efficacy ratings (on bleed day 1) 
were apparently thus also more positive in the prophylaxis arm than in the on-demand arm when 
looking at the Day 1 assessment. This suggests consistency between the investigator and subject 
assessment of haemostatic efficacy. It is not clear if there is a specific reason for the lower rating for 
haemostatic efficacy in the on-demand arm.  
Major and joint bleeds 
In the prophylaxis arm 16/78 (20.5%) of reported bleeding events were in a joint (3 major) and 36/78 
(46.2%) were mucosal (5 major). Four of the 5 subjects concerned had VWD of Type 3 and one had 
Type 2A VWD.  The investigator rated the haemostatic efficacy for the events as excellent and good for 
one event each and as moderate for the 6 remaining events. 
These 8 major bleeds were the only bleeds classified as major in the prophylaxis arm.  
In the on-demand arm 4/82 (4.9%) of reported bleeding events were in a joint and 51/82 (62%) were 
mucosal. The investigator rated efficacy in the treatment of 3 of the 4 joint bleeds as excellent and 
moderate in the 4th one (CSR Section 11.2.1.14 and Table 11-5). 
There were no bleeds classified as major in the on-demand arm. 
Number of infusions per bleeding event 
In both the on-demand and prophylaxis arm overall and in subjects ≥18 years and <12 years of age, 
the median number of infusions to treat a NSB was 1.0 which is supportive of adequate efficacy of 
Voncento. The proportion treated with one infusion was lower for bleeds in the on-demand arm 
(~55%) than in the prophylaxis arm (~71%) (Table 10). It can be speculated that patients on routine 
prophylaxis may have an ongoing higher plasma level of VWF at the time of occurrence of a bleed than 
patients on an on-demand regimen leading to this somewhat lower usage of Voncento per bleeding 
event in the prophylaxis arm. 
Concomitant haemostatic therapy 
With regard to haemostatic efficacy, the use of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid was allowed 
and was used in 6/11 (54.5%) of the subjects in the on-demand arm and in 6/14 (42.9%) of the 
subjects in the prophylaxis arm (Table 14.1.4.3 of the CSR). It is not clear if it was used at the same 
time as Voncento for the treatment of a bleed. 
However, similar proportions of subjects in both arms used tranexamic acid, it’s use is common in 
patients with VWD, the number of subjects in this study is small and there is subject related variability 
in response of subjects to treatment. Use of tranexamic acid was also allowed in the pivotal Voncento 
VWD studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (age ≥12years) and CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (age ,12 years). Therefore it is 
not considered likely that further analysis of efficacy taking use of tranexamic into account will yield 
useful insight into the efficacy of Voncento.  
Bleeding rates 
At inclusion, patients were assigned to on-demand or prophylaxis treatment based on their bleeding 
history and VWF treatment history from the last 12 months prior to Screening. Availability of detailed 
subject documentation (e.g. medical record, diary, logbook) covering prior bleeding and VWD 
treatment history over the past 12 months prior to screening was one of the inclusion criteria. No 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012

statistical comparison or endpoint on bleeding rates before and during the study was planned. Thus 
comparison of the number of bleeds during the ~12 months on study using either an on-demand or 
prophylaxis regimen and the 12 months prior to the study can be viewed descriptively.  
Prophylaxis arm 
The median (range) ABR was 4.36 (0.0 to 26.3) bleeding events for all NSB events, somewhat lower 
than the median number of bleeding events in the 12 months prior to the study but still within the 
same range (6.5; range: 0 to 34). 
On-demand 
The median (range) observed ABR was 2.99 (0.0 to 24.6) bleeding events for all NSB events. As for 
the prophylaxis arm, this was also lower than the median number of NSB events during the 12 months 
prior to the study but within the same range (4.0; range: 0 to 20). 
Thus regarding bleeds while on prophylaxis, apart from the subject who decided to discontinue as she 
was concerned that it was not working sufficiently (thus not the patient with gastrointestinal 
angiodysplasia), the frequency of bleeds on an annual basis was similar before and during the study. 
Efficacy according to age group 
Haemostatic Efficacy 
Per number of bleeds:  
Age  ≥18  years:  In  adult  patients,  in  the  prophylaxis  arm,  39  of  45  NSB  events  were  treated  with 
Voncento and assessed for efficacy and for ~82% of these 39 events (which included 8 major bleeds) 
the investigator rated haemostatic efficacy as either excellent (~69%) or good (~13%).  
In the on-demand arm, since all but one of the  subjects were adults, the efficacy results in these 10 
adult  subjects  were  very  similar  to  those  in  the  overall  on-demand  arm.  In  the  adult  subjects,  65 of 
the 78 events were treated with Voncento and assessed for haemostatic efficacy. Investigator efficacy 
ratings overall for the on-demand arm were 31.9% excellent, 52.2% good and 15.9% moderate. 
Haemostatic  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  bleeds  seems  to  have  been  less  in  the  on-demand  arm  in 
which none of the bleeds were classified as major. 
Age  <12  years:  The  investigator  efficacy  ratings  in  the  prophylaxis  arm,  were  somewhat  higher  for 
children  <12  years  in  whom  it  was  excellent  for  32  events  (97.0%)  moderate  for  the  one  remaining 
event. (As noted above, almost all of the events in age group <12 years were in one subject.) 
The  single  subject  <12  years  in  the  on-demand  arm  had  one  joint  and  3  muscle  bleeds 
(minor/moderate) for which efficacy was rated as excellent. 
Per number of subjects: The CSR refers to Table 14.2.2.1.3.2 for the investigator’s rating of efficacy 
per number of subjects for both age groups. For the prophylaxis arm, this table provides the following 
information: 
Age ≥18 years:  In the prophylaxis arm, the investigator rated efficacy as excellent for some event in 
7 of 11 subjects, good in 3 subjects and moderate in 3 subjects. Similarly, in the on-demand arm, the 
investigator  rated  efficacy  as  excellent  for  some  event  in  7  of  10  subjects,  good  in  5  subjects  and 
moderate in 3 subjects.  
In  both  the  prophylaxis  and  on-demand  arm,  the  worst  efficacy  grade  per  number  of  subjects  was 
excellent in 4, good in 2 subjects and moderate in 3 subjects. 
Age <12 years: In the prophylaxis arm, the investigator rated efficacy as excellent for some event in 2 
of 3 subjects and moderate in the third subject. (No subject had a rating of “good”). The worst efficacy 
grade was also excellent in 2 subjects and moderate in one subject. 
The single patient in the on-demand arm had an investigator efficacy rating of excellent. 
Overall, for  subjects <12 years, the efficacy ratings based on the number of bleeds tended to be more 
positive than for subjects ≥18 years, but no further conclusions can be made due to the nature of the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012

data (e.g. including variability between subjects, nature of bleeds and previous treatment history) and 
small numbers of subjects. 
Comparison to previous haemostatic efficacy data 
Age ≥18 years: 
Pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 included subjects aged >12 years, of whom 3 were adolescents,  
The data in the final integrated CSR, covering both on-demand treatment and routine prophylaxis with 
Voncento,  showed  that  in  the  20  subjects  receiving  on-demand  treatment,  the  investigator  rated 
haemostatic efficacy per bleeding event as excellent for 92% of the events. 
For all 10 bleeding events in the 9 subjects in prophylaxis Arm 3, the haemostatic efficacy was judged 
by the investigator to be excellent. 
Age <12 years:  
In the pivotal paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52 in VWD, from the CSR, the investigator’s assessment 
of  haemostatic  efficacy  per  treated  bleeding  event  in  Arm  1  (prophylaxis;  N=4  subjects,  73  treated 
bleeds)  was  rated  as  excellent  for  59  events  (80.8%)  and  as  good  for  the  remaining  14  events 
(19.2%).  
In  the  on-demand  arm  of  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-52,  haemostatic  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the 
investigator  for  all  80  events  treated  with  Voncento/Biostate  in  the  12  subjects,  as  excellent  for  36 
events (45.0%) and as good for the remaining 44 events (55.0%). 
Overall Conclusion Haemostatic Efficacy  
There was somewhat lower haemostatic efficacy reported in adults in the on-demand arm compared to 
the prophylaxis arm but nevertheless, efficacy was rated as excellent or good for similar proportions of 
bleeds in both arms at 84% of bleeds in the on-demand arm and 82% in the prophylaxis arm (together 
21 subjects). 
There were higher efficacy ratings for bleeding events in the previous study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 in which 
most subjects (n=) were ≥18 years old, with efficacy in at least 92% of bleeds rated excellent in the 
on-demand  and  prophylaxis  arms.  With  small  numbers  of  subjects  and  differences  between  the 
individual patient’s disease status which may affect their response to treatment it cannot be concluded 
that  that  there  is  a  real  difference  between  the  results  of  the  studies.  The  MAH  also  suggests  that 
differences  might  be  due  to  the  characteristics  of  this  post-marketing  study,  with  fewer  clinical  visits 
and  with  less  stringent  guidance  on  the  Voncento  dose  to  be  prescribed  compared  with  the  previous 
pivotal studies. 
For  subjects  aged  <12  years  efficacy  ratings  in  bleeds  (97%)  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  in  the  3 
patients on routine prophylaxis were higher but not dissimilar to those in the paediatric study CSLCT-
BIO-08-52  in  which  it  was  ~81%  excellent  and  ~19%  good  in  4  patients  on  routine  prophylaxis.  As 
there  was  only  one  child  receiving  on-demand  treatment  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83,  no  comparison 
with data from previous studies can be made. 
Overall, in children <12 years, numbers of subjects are too small to draw rigorous conclusions but the 
available  data  suggest  similar  haemostatic  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  bleeding  events  in  this  age 
group in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and in paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52. 
Number  of  bleeding  events  in  subjects  on  routine  prophylaxis  and  comparison  to  previous 
data 
Age ≥18 years: The median ABR in the 11 adult subjects of the prophylaxis arm was 4.71 bleeds per 
year (range: 0 to 11.3). 
For  comparison,  in  the  previous  study  CSLCT-BIO-08-54,  the  8  subjects  who  received  prophylaxis 
therapy  in  Arm  3,  had  a  median  of  1.0  event  (range:  1-6)  during  the  12  months  of  prophylaxis

therapy. (Prior to their period on prophylaxis, these 8 subjects had participated in Arm 2 of that study 
receiving on-demand treatment.) It can also be speculated that less frequent clinical visits during this 
post-marketing study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, or the fact that the prophylaxis subjects in study CSLCT-BIO-
08-54  already  had  been  in  the  study  for  a  year  prior  to  starting  prophylaxis  may  have  led  to  less 
favourable  results  in  the  post-marketing  study,  but  no  further  explanation  has  been  offered  by  the 
MAH.    
Age <12 years 
The  median  ABR  mentioned  for  subjects  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  in  age  group  <12  years  was  3.76  
range  1  to  26.3.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  of  the  33  bleeds  in  age  group  <12  years  in  the 
prophylaxis arm, as far as can be seen in listing 16.2.6.2.1, the vast majority occurred in one subject  
a female with Type 3 VWD. She had ~26 traumatic bleeds and 4 spontaneous bleeds during the study. 
The  other  2  subjects  mentioned  above,  both  also  with  Type  3  VWD,  had  one  bleed  and  4  bleeds 
respectively. 
In the previous paediatric study CSLCT-BIO-08-52, the number of bleeds (median 23.5, range 9 to 35) 
was  much  higher  in  the  4  patients  on  routine  prophylaxis  than  in  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83.  This  high 
rate  of  bleeds  in  subjects  <12  years  (median  22.2,  range  14  to  26)  was  also  seen  in  the  extension 
study  CSLCT-BIO-09-64,  which  included  3  patients  from  CSLCT-BIO-08-52.  There  has  been  no  clear 
explanation  for  these  high  rates  in  children  in  the  previous  studies.  However,  it  can  be  taken  into 
account  that  Studies  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  /  CSLCT-BIO-09-64  were  carried  out 
largely in different countries and subjects may have had different levels of care. Furthermore, numbers 
are  small  and  individual  patients  may  have  high  bleeding  rates  depending  on  their  VWD  type  and 
actual  bleeding  phenotype.  This  is  can  be  seen  in  the  single  subject  in  this  post-marketing  study 
CSLCT-BIO-12-83 also had ~30 bleeds during the study.  
Conclusion Number of bleeding events  
The ABR in subjects on routine prophylaxis in the paediatric patients is not very informative as most of 
the events occurred in one of the 3 subjects. 
With regard to treatment prior to study entry, based on the subject’s bleeding history and previous 
VWF treatment history (from the last 12 months prior to screening), the investigator prescribed an on-
demand or prophylaxis regimen. Of the 14 subjects in the prophylaxis arm, 10 had previously been on 
prophylaxis. 
Taking the regimens used prior to study entry into account and although ABR (based on treated 
bleeds) and number of bleeds per 12 months may not be directly comparable, it is of some relevance 
that overall, the 14 subjects in the prophylaxis arm during the 12 months in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, 
had a similar / lower number of bleeds (median  ABR 4.36; range (0.0 to 26.3)) than the number of 
bleeding events  in the 12 months prior to the study (median 6.0, range 0 to 34).  
Overall,  taking  the  high  variability  in  bleeding  rates  which  can  be  seen  between  subjects,  nature  of 
bleeds, and small numbers of subjects it seems reasonable to conclude that efficacy with regard to the 
number of bleeds per year in patients on routine prophylaxis was not worse than in previous studies.  
Dosage 
The median dose (IU VWF:RCo/kg) per infusion given for the treatment of a bleeding event was  47.5 
(range 31.2 - 115.5) in the on-demand arm and 43.6 (range 30.0 - 183.0) in the prophylaxis arm 
(Table 9). These median doses are within the range recommended in the Voncento SmPC (40 - 80 
IU/kg) to achieve haemostasis for both the adult and paediatric population. 
However, the upper limit of the range for doses given for bleeds in the prophylaxis arm (183.0 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg) is considered to be very high compared to a usual maximum recommended dose of 80 
IU VWF:RCo/kg.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012 
EMA/469594/2019  
Page 36/47 
 
 
 
 
 
The median dose 37.6 (range 25.5 - 108.0) per infusion  given for routine prophylaxis falls within the 
ranges recommended in the Voncento SmPC for subjects 12 to 18 years old (25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo /kg) 
and  within the higher dose recommendation for the younger age group of paediatric subjects who are 
<12 years old (40 – 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg). 
The median doses per infusion for surgery were 42.8 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 33.8 - 114.6) in the on-
demand arm and 72.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg (40.8 - 233.3) in the prophylaxis arm. These median values are 
not unexpected when compared with the recommended dose for treatment of bleeding events, 
although the upper limit of these ranges for surgeries performed in the prophylaxis arm are very high. 
Dosage according to age group 
The upper limit for the range of total Voncento dose per event was 1020 IU VWF:RCo/kg in the 11 
adults for whom the number of infusions per event ranged from 1 to 30. For the 3 subjects aged <12 
years, the Voncento dose per event ranged up to 554 IU VWF:RCo/kg with the number of infusions per 
event ranging from 1 to 3.  
From the ranges of the total amount of Voncento per bleeding event it would appear that both in adult 
patients and in patients <12 years, rather high doses per infusion were given to some patients in the 
prophylaxis arm to treat bleeds. 
Conclusion on dosage 
Overall the doses used in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 were broadly within or close to those recommended 
in the Voncento SmPC.  
However, the upper limit of the range for doses given for bleeds in the prophylaxis arm (183.0 IU 
VWF:RCo/kg) and for surgery in the prophylaxis arm (233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg) are considered to be very 
high compared to a usual maximum recommended dose of 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg. As medication error is 
defined as an AESI in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and as a potential risk in the Voncento RMP, the MAH 
was requested to clarify these high doses, separately for patients ≥18 years and those <12 years, and 
to evaluate whether they may have been due to medication error. 
The lower limits of the ranges of doses used are not considered to be of concern as they are in line 
with the recommended lower dose ranges. 
In  response  to  the  1st  RSI,  the  MAH  provided  the  requested  information.  This  clarified  that  the  very 
high doses of 183.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg and 233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg were confined to one subject with Type 
3  VWD  and  were  apparently  a  decision  of  the  physician,  who  had  prescribed both  recommended  and 
higher  doses  for  routine  prophylaxis  during  the  study  and  who  had  also  prescribed  somewhat  higher 
than  recommended  prophylaxis  doses  for  this  subject  before  she  took  part  in  the  study.  No  other 
subject  (with  the  exception  of  an  adult  subject  who  received  108  IU/kg  for  treatment  of  a  bleeding 
event) received doses outside the recommended range. 
Overall there are no indications that there was a dosing error in the subject or that there were dosing 
errors throughout the study. 
However, the study findings do not rule out the possibility of medication errors which is still considered 
to be relevant in the real-life situation. 
Surgery 
Overall there were 13 surgeries in 9 subjects of whom 2 were aged <12 years.It can be concluded that 
in  the  10  surgical  procedures  where  Voncento  was  given  (most  of  which  were  in  subjects  aged  ≥18 
years),  haemostatic  efficacy  was  rated  as  excellent  in  6  (which  included  an  appendicectomy  and  a 
tonsillectomy) and good in the other 4 (which included a knee replacement and 3 minor procedures).

Age <12 years 
Surgery in children <12 years is not discussed in the CSLCT-BIO-12-83 CSR, however, in the listings it 
can  be  seen  that  2  subjects  <12  years  old  underwent  surgery  for  which  both  received  Voncento.  A  
female  had  a  tympanostomy  (minor  planned  procedure)  with  haemostasis  rated  as  excellent  and 
afemale had a major tooth extraction but there was no rating for haemostasis given. 
From the Listings, no blood product transfusions were given in association with surgical procedures. 
These  data  show  that  overall  haemostatic  efficacy  in  relation  to  surgical  procedures  was  rated  as 
excellent  or  good  in  the  7  subjects  aged  ≥18  years  and  excellent  in  the  subject  aged  <12  years 
(tympanostomy) for whom a rating was given.  
Overall Conclusion on Efficacy 
The assessment of the haemostatic efficacy as assessed by the investigator and the subjects was rated 
excellent or good at for a large majority of bleeds and no subject required blood product transfusions.  
Efficacy  of  routine  prophylaxis  with  Voncento  in  preventing  non-surgical  bleeding  (NSB)  events  and 
haemostatic  efficacy  of  therapy  with  Voncento  in  the  treatment  of  bleeds  in  patients  who  require  a 
(VWF) product to control an NSB event were confirmed in CSLCT-BIO-12-83.  
With  regard  to  surgery,  it  can  be  concluded  that  haemostatic  efficacy  of  Voncento  was  acceptable  in 
VWD patients undergoing surgical procedures. As only 2 children <12 years received Voncento before 
or  during  their  procedure,  no  conclusion  on  data  from  this  study  specific  to  this  age  group  can  be 
drawn. 
As no subjects aged from 12 to 18 years were included in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83, there has been no 
increase in data in the adolescent age group. With regard to efficacy in different age groups, subjects 
may  have  different  bleeding  patterns  according  to  age  (e.g.  menstrual  bleeding  from  adolescent  age 
onwards) and level of physical activity which is likely to be higher in younger patients. It is reasonable 
to assume that such patterns will be reflected in either the age group <12 years or ≥18 years and in 
patients 12 to 18 years both are likely. 
Patients with a severe VWD bleeding phenotype are expected to have a serious bleeding disorder from 
an early age.  
PK  data  from  studies  CSLCT-BIO-08-52  and  CSLCT-BIO-08-54  have  been  thoroughly  analysed  in  a 
previous  procedure  (Type  II/08).  With  regard  to  adolescents  it  was  concluded  that  “In  view  of  the 
similar PK data in patients aged from 12 to 18 years it can be agreed that prophylactic dosing in this 
age group can be based on the same guidelines as for adults.” 
Therefore, taking the above points into consideration, the available data are considered supportive of 
efficacy in the  age group 12 to 18 years.  
In  line  with  the  conclusion  of  the  MAH,  it  is  considered  that  efficacy  results  from  this  post-marketing 
study in subjects with VWD were generally consistent with those observed in previous clinical studies, 
without any new or unexpected findings. 
Safety Discussion 
The  main  reason  for  performing  post-marketing  study  CSLSCT-BIO-12-83  was  to  collect  additional 
clinical data and to ensure consistency in the long term between the outcomes from clinical studies and 
those  from  routine  use,  in  line  with    the  EMA  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Human 
Plasma Derived VWF Products [CPMP/BPWG/220/02].

Important adverse events have been classified as adverse events of special interest (AESI, see below). 
Lack  of  efficacy  was  not  defined  as  an  AESI  but  is  also  considered  to  be  an  important  AE  as  it  could 
have  serious  consequences  and  might  indicate  the  presence  of  inhibiting  antibodies.  Most  of  these 
important  AEs  would  be  treatment  related  with  the  exception  of  lack  of  efficacy  which  could  also  be 
due to a dosing error. 
As these important AEs are not age specific, AEs are mainly discussed for patients ≥18 years and <12 
years together with a short discussion on TEAEs according to age. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Per  protocol,  development  of  VWF/FVIII  inhibitors,  embolic  and  thrombotic  events,  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  including  anaphylaxis,  transmission  of  infectious  agents,  and  medication  errors  were 
considered  as  AESIs.  Also,  Voncento  dosing  deviations  (±  20%  between  the  actual  administered  and 
the prescribed dose), including overdose was defined as a safety assessment. 
No development of these AESIs were reported, however, some events deserve mention. 
Although development of VWF / FVIII inhibitors was as an AESI, lack of efficacy, which may result from 
the  presence  of  inhibiting  antibodies,  was  not  defined  as  an  AESI.  Concerning  a  subject  in  the 
prophylaxis  arm,  for  whom  efficacy  was  reported  as  being  “none”,  according  to  the  narrative  the 
investigator  suspected  another  pathway  as  bleeding  reason,  because  the  subject  had  a  sufficient 
FVIII:C  level  and  high  VWF:Ag  levels.  An  initial  judgment  specified  haemorrhagic  diathesis  as  the 
primary reason of the bleeds. However, the final diagnosis for the gastrointestinal bleeding events was 
confirmed as small intestine angiodysplasia (detailed in correspondence filed in the Trial Master File).  
As  high  VWF:Ag  levels  were  measured  at  the  time  of  the  event  (e.g.  May  and  July  2017  in  listing 
16.2.8.4)  it  can  be  concluded  that,  although  not  measured  at  the  time  of  the  bleeding  events,  there 
was no evidence of antibodies to VWF. 
There was an event of face swelling reported in a female but it is not clear why this was reported as an 
AESI  although presumably  this  is  because  facial  swelling  can  be  a  manifestation  of  a  hypersensitivity 
reaction. However, according to the case narrative, this non-serious event occurred 275 days after the 
first prophylactic dose of Voncento. The Voncento dose and dosing regimen were not changed and the 
subject completed the study approximately 3 months after the event. Therefore it seems unlikely that 
a hypersensitivity reaction related to Voncento had occurred. 
As noted in the Voncento EPAR, the outer labelling (carton and label) displays both the FVIII and VWF 
content, and uses different colour design for each strength. Patients with haemophilia A or VWD should 
be  dosed  according  to  FVIII  or  VWF  requirement  respectively,  as  is  advised  in  the  Voncento  SmPC 
There is potential for medication error as Voncento contains both FVIII and VWF. As mentioned in the 
RMP,  one  case  of  overdose  (without  associated  undesirable  effects)  and  4  cases  of  under  dosing  and 
also had been reported from clinical trials. 
As  discussed  above  in  the  “Conclusion  on  dosage”,  since  medication  error  was  defined  as  an  AESI  in 
study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and as a potential risk in the Voncento RMP, the MAH was requested to clarify 
these high doses and to evaluate whether they may have been due to medication error. 
In  response  to  the  1st  RSI,  the  MAH  clarified  that  the  very  high  doses  of  183.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  and 
233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg were confined to one subject with Type 3 VWD and were apparently a decision 
of the physician. No other subject (with the exception of an adult subject who received 108 IU/kg for 
treatment of a bleeding event) received doses outside the recommended range. 
Overall there are no indications that there was a dosing error in the subject or that there were dosing 
errors throughout the study.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012

However, the study findings do not rule out the possibility of medication errors which is still considered 
to be relevant in the real-life situation. 
TEAEs 
There was a high number of TEAEs in the prophylaxis arm (84 TEAES in 12 subjects) compared to the 
on-demand arm (13 TEAEs in7 subjects). It seems likely that this was due to the greater exposure to 
Voncento  in  the  prophylaxis  arm  (median  106.5  exposure  days,  range  31-182  with  8/14  (57.1%) 
having >100 exposure days ) compared to the on-demand arm (median 15.0 exposure days, range 3 – 
83 with 9/11 (81.8%) of the subjects having <50 exposure days).  
Although some of the TEAEs which were reported at a higher frequency in the prophylaxis arm (Table 
13)  might  be  likely  to  occur  in  a  patient  on  treatment  with  a  coagulation  factor  e.g.  Gastrointestinal 
disorder  (e.g.  bleeding),  headache,  administration  site  conditions  it  is  reassuring  that  severe,  serious 
or AESIs occurred at a similar rate and very infrequently in both arms (Table 12). Also there were no 
TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal. 
Treatment Related AEs  
No  treatment  related  AEs  were  reported  in  the  on-demand  arm  and  in  only  one  subject  in  the 
prophylaxis arm, all mild in intensity and resolving within a maximum of 14 hours. 
Haematology parameters  
Of the values which were not normalised at 12 months, in one male subject had a baseline  MCV value 
had been low but within the reference range; a male with VWD Type 3) had a  low erythrocyte count 
and haematocrit  at Month 12, the subject’s last laboratory assessment. 
The reported abnormal haematology parameters are not considered to be of concern as they might be 
expected i.e. possibly indicative of (impending) anaemia in patients with a bleeding disorder at risk of 
blood loss despite treatment. 
TEAEs according to age 
Patients aged ≥18 years 
Most of the TEAEs in this study occurred in the 21 adult patients who had a total of 80 TEAEs. There 
were 67 TEAEs in 9 subjects in the prophylaxis arm and 13 TEAEs in 7 subjects in the on-demand arm. 
Nasopharyngitis, nausea, headache, arthralgia, and pain in extremity being the only TEAEs reported by 
2 subjects overall. The distribution of TEAEs was similar to that in the overall safety population. 
Patients aged <12 years 
There  was  not  a  high  rate  of  TEAEs  (17  over  4  subjects)  in  the  paediatric  subjects  with  all  of  these 
reported in the 3 subjects who were on routine prophylaxis. As only one paediatric subject was treated 
on-demand, no further conclusions can be drawn from the reporting of TEAEs in this arm. 
Reported TEAEs of pyrexia, bronchitis, ear infection, otitis media, tongue biting, compulsive lip biting, 
contusion,  swelling  face,  and  face  injury  only  occurred  in  this  age  group  and  mostly  are  particularly 
common  in  young  children.  The  other  TEAEs  reported  in  this  age  group  were  nasopharyngitis, 
diarrhoea, and cough. 
The  event  of  facial  swelling  is  discussed  above  and  does  not  appear  to  have  been  a  hypersensitivity 
reaction to Voncento. 
The  TEAEs  reported  in  the  subjects  aged  <12  years  were  consistent  with  what  might  be  expected  in 
the paediatric population of that age. 
The adverse event profile was similar to that in paediatric Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52.

Overall, the safety profile seen in study CSLSCT-BIO-12-83 was mild and in line with that observed in 
previous  Voncento  studies  in  patients  with  VWD.  Treatment  related  AEs  were  reported  in  only  one 
subject in the prophylaxis arm, all mild in intensity. 
Importantly, no development of FVIII / VWF inhibitors, virus transmissions, hypersensitivity reactions, 
embolic and thrombotic events or medication errors were reported. 
The  TEAEs  reported  in  the  subjects  aged  <12  years  were  consistent  with  what  might  be  expected  in 
the paediatric population of that age. 
The safety findings do not give cause for concern.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 was submitted to comply with Article 46 of the paediatric regulation . 
In the context of the Marketing approval application (MAA) of Voncento, Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 was 
conducted as a commitment to conduct a post-marketing study to comply with the requirements of the 
EMA  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Human  Plasma  Derived  von  Willebrand  factor 
(VWF) Products [CPMP/BPWG/220/02].  
With  submission  of  study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  all  studies  with  Voncento  in  VWD  have  been  completed 
and submitted. 
Data in the adult population submitted in this procedure are far more extensive than the new data in 
the  paediatric  population.  Study  CSLCT-BIO-12-83  represents  compliance  with  providing  additional 
efficacy and safety data to confirm findings from study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 which was pivotal to approval 
of the indication in VWD. 
Until now, data to support the indication for Voncento in patients with VWD was available from Studies 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and CSLCT-BIO-08-52 (and their extension study CSLCT-BIO-09-64). 
As only patients who had not previously participated in a Voncento / Biostate study could be enrolled, 
Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 has provided additional data in subjects with VWD aged ≥18 years of age and 
in the paediatric population aged <12 years.  
in age group ≥18 years  from 19 (from Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54) to 40 and 
With this new data, the number of patients investigated has increased: 
− 
− 
No new adolescent subjects (age 12 to <18 years) have been investigated.  
in age group <12 years from 17  (from Study CSLCT-BIO-08-52)  to 21. 
Data from Study CSLCT-BIO-12-83  thus represent a significant increase in the available data on 
treatment with Voncento in adult patients with VWD, and a smaller, but nevertheless valuable increase 
in data in paediatric subjects aged <12 years. 
There are still few data in subjects aged 12 to 18 years. However, based on the fact that patients with 
a severe VWD bleeding phenotype have a lifelong bleeding disorder, that subjects aged <12 years and 
≥18 years experience bleeding problems likely also to be encountered in patients of 12 to 18 years old, 
previous thorough PK analysis supporting that dosing in patients of 12 to 18 years old is the same as 
in adults, the available data are considered supportive of efficacy in the age group 12 to 18 years. 
With  regard  to  adverse  events,  those  seen  in  study  CSLSCT-BIO-12-83  were  mild  and  in  line  with 
those observed in previous Voncento studies in patients with VWD. Adverse events likely to be related 
to  treatment  with  Voncento  are  not  expected  to  differ  between  age  groups,  thus  the  available  safety 
data,  although  mostly  obtained  in  subjects  aged  <12  years  and  ≥18  years,  is  considered  also 
applicable to patients aged 12 to 18 years. 
Overall, it is considered that efficacy and safety in the age groups investigated have confirmed the 
favourable efficacy and safety profile seen in the pivotal studies CSLCT-BIO-08-54 and CSLCT-BIO-08-
52 and extension study CSLCT-BIO-09-64. 
The MAH has not been submitted a Product Information document and does not propose any changes 
in the SmPC which is agreed.

RMP 
No  RMP  has  been  submitted,  however  an  additional  comment  is  made  with  regard  to  the  RMP  which 
was recently updated to Version 6.7, dated 12 February 2018.  
In the next RMP revision, the MAH is asked to update the information about the study CSLCT-BIO-12-
83 in the relevant sections of the RMP. 
  Fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide additional clarifications as part of this procedure. 
(see section 4 “Additional clarifications requested”) 
4.  Additonal clarification request 
The MAH is to clarify the following points: 
1.  The upper limit of the range for doses given for routine prophylaxis (183.0 IU VWF:RCo/kg) and for 
surgery in the prophylaxis (233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg) are considered to be very high. As medication 
error is defined as an AESI in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and as a potential risk in the Voncento RMP, 
the MAH is requested to clarify these high doses, separately for patients ≥18 years and those <12 
years, and to evaluate whether they may have been due to medication error.  
2.  RMP  
An additional comment is made with regard to the RMP which was recently updated to Version 6.7, 
dated  12  February  2018.  In  the  next  RMP  revision,  the  MAH  is  asked  to  update  the  information 
about the study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 in the relevant sections of the RMP.

the Request for Supplementary Information 
2. Clinical Aspects  
Other concerns 
Question 1: 
The  upper  limit  of  the  range  for  doses  given  for  routine  prophylaxis  (183.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg)  and  for 
surgery in the prophylaxis (233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg) are considered to be very high. As medication error 
is defined as an AESI in study CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and as a potential risk in the Voncento RMP, the MAH 
is requested to clarify these high doses, separately for patients ≥18 years and those <12 years, and to 
evaluate whether they may have been due to medication error.  
Summary of MAH answer  
Each subject’s individual dose was determined by the investigator, based on the subject’s clinical 
condition,  previous  VWF  /  FVIII  concentrate  requirements,  response  to  therapy,  body  weight,  and 
reason for usage (ie, to treat a bleeding event, prevent a surgical bleeding event, provide prophylaxis, 
etc) using the SmPC as a guide. 
The mean dose per infusion to treat a BE (Table 1) and for surgery (Table 2) for each patient in 
the prophylaxis arm is listed below. 
Table 1: Mean dose per infusion [IU VWF:RCo/kg] for treatment of BE in the prophylaxis arm 
Table 2: Mean dose per infusion [IU VWF:RCo/kg] for surgery in the prophylaxis arm 
VWF:RCo/kg) and for surgery (233.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg) in the prophylaxis arm were administered to the 
same  subject.  This  white  female  with  a  history  of  VWD  Type  3  was  screened  and  enrolled  in  the

prophylaxis  arm.  No  other  medical  condition  was  reported.  In  the  12  month  prior  to  enrolment  the 
subject was on a prophylaxis regimen with Voncento of 92 IU VWF:RCo/kg (3 times per week), during 
this  period  the  subject  experienced  9  traumatic  BE  (dose  and  treatment  not  recorded).  the  following 
doses were assigned: 
Prophylaxis: 100 IU VWF:RCo/kg (3 times per week) 
Treatment of BE: 100 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
• 
• 
•  During surgery: 400 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
• 
Post-surgery: 200 IU/kg 
The prophylaxis dose assigned was higher than, but in the same range as the subject’s recent previous 
prophylaxis  regimen.  Two  traumatic  BE  were  reported  during  the  first  3  treatment  months.  The 
haemostatic efficacy was  assessed by the investigator and the subject’s parents as excellent for both 
bleeding episodes. During this period 4 non-related AEs were reported (common cold (2), otitis media 
(2)). the investigator decided to adjust the subject’s doses due to weight gain: 
• 
• 
Prophylaxis: 92 IU VWF:RCo/kg (3 times per week) 
Treatment of BE: 185 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
Seven  BE  (5  traumatic,  2  spontaneous)  were  reported  during  the  3  treatment  months  after  the  dose 
adjustment.  The  haemostatic  efficacy  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  and  the  subject’s  parents  as 
excellent for all BE. During this period 3 non-related AEs were reported (cough, otitis media, diarrhea). 
the investigator decided to adjust the subject’s doses again, attributed to weight gain: 
• 
• 
Prophylaxis: 86 IU VWF:RCo/kg (3 times per week) 
Treatment of BE: 171 IU VWF:RCo/kg 
Nineteen  BE  (17  traumatic,  2  spontaneous)  were  reported  after  the  second  dose  adjustment.  The 
haemostatic efficacy was assessed by the investigator as excellent for all BE and the subject’s parents 
as  excellent  for  all  but  1  BE  and  good  for  1  BE.  During  this  period  8  non-related  AEs  were  reported 
(common cold (4), fever, cheek injury, tongue bite, lip bite). 
The  haemostatic  efficacy  of  prophylaxis  treatment  was  assessed  as  excellent  by  the  investigator  for  
each 3-month interval and by the subject’s parents for each month. the subject had a minor surgery 
(tympanostomy tube operation). The subject received 1 administration of 400 IU VWF:RCo/kg during 
surgery  followed  by  post-surgery  doses  of  200  IU  VWF:RCo/kg  once  daily  for  5  days,  resulting  in  a 
mean  dose  for  surgery  of  233.3  IU  VWF:RCo/kg.  No  AEs  were  reported  during  the  surgery  or  in  the 
post-surgery follow-up period. 
The  overall  haemostatic  efficacy  was  assessed  as  excellent.  The  blood  loss  during  the  surgery  was 
assessed as equivalent compared with the expected blood loss in a patient without a bleeding disorder 
undergoing the same procedure. No blood product transfusion was required. 
In  conclusion,  a  single  subject  received  very  high  doses  of  Voncento  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating 
physician. The prophylactic regimen during the trial was similar to the dose in the previous 12 months. 
Excellent  efficacy  was  achieved,  with  few  AEs,  none  of  which  was  considered  related  to  Voncento 
therapy. There does not appear to be an error of medication in relation to this patient. 
Rapporteur’s  Assessment  
The MAH has provided the requested information. 
It has been clarified that the two high doses in the prophylaxis arm, one for the treatment of a bleed 
(183.0  IU  VWF:RCo/kg)  and  one  for  surgery    (233.3  IU  VWF:RCo/kg),  were  both  given  in  the  same 
subject, a female with VWD Type 3. 
This subject had already been on relatively high prophylactic doses of Voncento (92 IU VWF:RCo/kg,  3 
times  per  week),  before  entering  the  post-marketing  study  but  still  had  experienced  9  bleeds  in  12 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 – P46/012

months.  The  physician  had  apparently  consciously  decided  on  somewhat  higher  doses  of  Voncento, 
expressed in units of VWF:RCo/kg, before study entry. 
During the study, the physician had also assigned a prophylaxis dose above and later at the upper end 
of the recommended range for prophylaxis for her age group. The physician had consistently assigned 
higher  than  recommended  doses  for  this  subject  for  the  treatment of  bleeds and  very  high  doses  for 
surgery.  
The doses used by the other patients  were within the  range recommended in the Voncento product 
information  (with  the  exception  of  108  IU/kg  in  one  adult  subject  which  is  not  considered  to  be  of 
concern  as  if  thought  to  be  clinically  necessary  a  physician  may  decide  upon  a  higher  dose  and  this 
dose is not extreme).  
For information, posology recommendations from the Voncento SmPC are given below. The long term 
prophylaxis dosage recommendation in the Voncento product information for paediatric patients aged 
<12 years old is as follows: 
−  Based on results from a clinical trial in which paediatric patients under 12 years of age were shown 
to have lower exposure of VWF, a prophylactic dose range of 40 – 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight 
1 to 3 times a week should be considered. (see Section 5.2). 
− 
For patients aged 12 years and older it is 25 - 40 IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight given 1 to 3 times 
per week. 
−  The dose and duration of treatment will depend on the clinical status of the patient, as well as their 
VWF:RCo and FVIII:C plasma levels. 
− 
For all ages, usually 40 - 80 IU/kg are recommended to treat a bleed. 
−  No dosage range is given for surgery.  
For surgery, although a strict dose recommendation is not actually given in the Voncento SmPC,  it can 
be expected that dosing is similar to that used for the treatment of bleeds and dosing must be tailored 
to the individual need and response. 
Conclusion 
The very high doses were confined to one subject with Type 3 VWD and were apparently a decision of 
the physician, who had prescribed both recommended and higher doses for routine prophylaxis during 
the study and who had also prescribed somewhat higher than recommended prophylaxis doses for this 
subject before she took part in the study. No other subject (with the exception of the adult subject who 
received 108 IU/kg) received doses outside the recommended range. 
Overall there are no indications that there was a dosing error in the subject or that there were dosing 
errors throughout the study. 
However, the study findings do not rule out the possibility of medication errors which is still considered 
to be relevant in the real-life situation.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Requested type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC submitted 
to the European Medicines Agency on 4 November 2014 an application for a variation following a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Pursuant to section 10 of the CHMP “Guideline on procedural aspects regarding a CHMP scientific opinion 
in the context of cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the evaluation of medicinal 
products intended exclusively for markets outside the community” (EMEA/CHMP/5579/04), Sanofi 
Pasteur MSD SNC submitted to the EMA on 4 November 2014 an application for a variation1 to the CHMP 
Scientific Opinion. 
The following changes were proposed:

Type II 
I and IIIB 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data  
Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC with regards to 2+1 vaccination schedule combining a 2 dose 
priming series with a booster vaccination, further to the results of Phase III Study A3L38 (EU) conducted 
in healthy infants and toddlers (MEA 005). The package leaflet is updated accordingly. Additionally, the 
results of the primary vaccination using the 2+1 scheme in South America are described in study A3L24. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
and Package Leaflet. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The objective of this variation is to update the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-Hib vaccine's product information with the 
immunogenicity and safety results from the recently completed Phase III Study A3L38 (NCT-01177722, 
Eudra CT 2012-001054-26). This study was conducted in healthy infants and toddlers in Sweden and 
Finland and to investigate a 2+1 vaccination schedule (vaccinations at 3, 5, 11 to 12 MoA) in the 
development program. The schedules combining a 2 dose priming series with a booster vaccination are 
either implemented at 2, 4, and 11 to 12 MoA (e.g. Italy, Austria and, more recently, France), or at 3, 5, 
and 11 to 12 MoA (e.g. in Finland and Sweden).  
The supplement also includes immunogenicity data collected during a post-hoc exploratory analysis of 
immunogenicity in Study A3L24 (initially discussed during MAA –D150), a primary series investigation of 
Hexacima versus Infanrix hexa, with concomitant administration of Prevenar at 2, 4, and 6 MoA and 
Rotarix at 2 and 4 MoA, conducted in healthy infants in Colombia and Costa Rica (U1111-1111-5801). The 
data from the A3L24 Addendum Report are included to further characterize the immune response of 
hexavalent combined vaccines following administration of the second dose of primary immunization, as 
well as an indirect descriptive comparison of the immune response to the pertussis (PT), filamentous 
1 Which corresponds, by analogy, to a Type II variation pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) 1234/2008

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The data presented with this worksharing are sufficient to implement the changes to the SmPC as 
suggested by the MAH 
• 
provided that satisfactory answers are given to the ‘other concerns’ as detailed in section 5. 
The benefit-risk balance of Hexaxim, Hexacima and Hexyon, remains positive.  
No new safety concerns emerged.

 is recommended for approval. 
The requested worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
and Package Leaflet. 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
The initial authorization of Hexacima/Hexyon was based on data from studies conducted exclusively 
outside the EU and for the most parts not including Caucasians. Although the general applicability of data 
was accepted the company proposed several studies – including A3L38 – in Caucasians to show data 
similarity. 
Exploratory analysis of anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRP in study A3L24 
The assessment of the immune response in the Phase III A3L24 was mainly based on the blood samples 
taken 1 month post-dose 3, and there were no objectives for describing the immunogenicity after the 
second dose of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T. However, a blood sample had been taken 1 month post-dose 2 at 
5 MoA to assess the immune response against rotavirus antigen on a subset of subjects (68 planned 
subjects in each batch group, i.e., 204 subjects in DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T pooled batches group; and 68

subjects in control vaccine group). In order to further describe the immunogenicity of the hexavalent 
paediatric combination vaccines administered in A3L24, complementary testing on remaining post-dose 2 
sera were suggested by Sanofi Pasteur. The exploratory analyses described in the sections below were 
not planned in the A3L24 protocol.

4.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study A3L38  
The study was part of the pediatric investigational plan as agreed by the EMA. 
Design: Phase III, randomized, observer-blinded, multicentre study carried out in Finland and Sweden in 
healthy infants 3 months old at enrollment between 01 November 2012 (FVFS) and 10 January 2014 
(LVLS). 
A total of 554 Subjects were 1 : 1 randomized to one of the following groups (277 subjects per group): 
•  Group 1, Hexacima/Hexyon (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) + Prevenar 13 
•  Group 2, Infanrix Hexa (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib reference vaccine) + Prevenar 13 
All subjects received 3 doses of either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine each co-administered with Prevenar 13 
at 3, 5, and 11 to 12 months of age (2 + 1 schedule). 
Overall, there were 50.2% of male and 49.8% of female subjects. The mean age of the subjects at 
vaccine Dose 1 was 89.3 days (range 85-95 days); the mean weight of subjects was 6.1 kg (range 4-9 
kg). 95% of subjects were White, 4% of mixed origin, 1% others.   
Blood sampling was performed at 4 time points: prior to dose 1, at 1 month post-dose 2, prior to and at 
1 month post-dose 3. 
Infants may have received a rotavirus vaccination as an additional vaccine, but not as part of the study 
protocol.

Statistical analysis (primary endpoint):  
The difference [Hexacima – Infanrix Hexa] in seroprotection/vaccine response rates was calculated. The 
relevant limit for non-inferiority was −10% for D, T, Hep B, PRP, PT, and FHA antigens and –5% for 
poliovirus antigens, based on the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference of the 
seroprotection/vaccine response rates. 
The hypothesis of non-inferiority was tested on the PP analysis set (subjects vaccinated according to 
protocol) at 1 month post-dose 3 (PP1, primary endpoint). It was repeated in the PP analysis set at 1 
month post-dose 2 (PP2, secondary) and in the Full analysis set (FAS, subjects who received at least one 
vaccine dose). 
Sample Size and Power Calculation 
The sample size calculation was based on the test for the primary objective. A total of 554 subjects were 
to be included in the study, 277 per group. Using an alpha level of 2.5% (onesided hypotheses), and

under the assumption that approximately 80% (N=222 per group) of subjects were evaluable, the overall 
power was  > 90% for non-inferiority of Hexacima versus Infanrix Hexa in terms of immunogenicity at 1 
month post-Dose 3 (Table 2).

4.3.2.  Results 
Study A3L38 
Trial population: 
A total of 554 subjects were presented at 1st visit of which 551 (99.5%) were eligible, 3 subjects were 
excluded because of acute illness/infection (2 subjects) and a hernia (1 subject).  
A total of 546 subjects vaccinated at visit 1 (Hexacima: 271 subjects; Infanrix hexa: 275 subjects) were 
included in the FAS; 5 eligible subjects did not receive any study vaccine because of a missing blood 
sample at visit 1. A total of 533 subjects (97.6%) completed the study. Reasons for discontinuation were 
mainly voluntary withdrawal (10 subjects) or SAEs (3 subjects; refer to safety section for details). 
A total of 49 subjects (22 in Hexacima group; 27 in Infanrix hexa group) were excluded from the PP1 
because of protocol violation, e.g. vaccination outside specified time interval, missing vaccine injection or 
blood sampling etc. Thus, the PP1 comprised 497 subjects (249 in Hexacima; 248 in Infanrix hexa group), 
the PP2 (at post-Dose 2) comprised 495 subjects (249 in Hexacima, 246 in Infanrix hexa group). 
Immunogenicity (primary endpoints): 
For the primary objective, non-inferiority of Hexacima as compared to Infanrix Hexa was assessed in 
terms of seroprotection rates (for D, T, Hep B, PRP and Polio 1, 2 and 3) or vaccine response rates (for PT 
and FHA). Antibody thresholds applied were either established correlates (for D, T, Hep B, PRP and Polio 
1, 2 and 3) or accepted surrogates (for PT and FHA) of protection (see Table 1). The primary analysis was 
based on the PP1 subjects at post-dose 3.  
Minimum 93% of subjects in both vaccine groups showed seroprotection or vaccine response (with CIs 
between 90 and 100%), respectively, except for PRP in the Infanrix Hexa group for which a seroprotection 
rate of 85.2% (CI, 80.2; 89.4) was found. For Hexacima, a higher PRP seroprotection rate of 93.5% was 
observed at 1 month post-dose 3 (CI, 89.6; 96.2).  
Compared to Infanrix Hexa, Hexacima showed somewhat lower response or seroprotection rates for PT 
(98% vs. 99.6%) and Hep B (96.4% vs. 99.6%), each with overlapping CI. 
Hexacima was non-inferior to Infanrix Hexa for every antigen since the lower bounds of the 95% CI of the 
difference in seroprotection/ vaccine response percentages between Hexacima and Infanrix Hexa for each 
valence was greater than –δ (i.e., –10 for D, T, PT, FHA, B, and PRP, and –5 for Polio) Table 3). 
Very similar results were obtained for non-inferiority testing on full analysis set at 1 month-post dose 3 
(for further details please refer to A3L38 CSR, Table 9.23). 
Immunogenicity against DTaPHepBHiB antigens (secondary and observational endpoints; 
Table 3 to Table 7): 
Non-inferiority of Hexacima compared to Infanrix Hexa was also given at 1 month post-Dose 2 except for 
poliovirus type 1 and 2 for which the lower bounds of the 95% CI of the difference in seroprotection rates 
between both vaccines was lower than –5. Please note that for D, T, and PRP short-term protection levels 
of 0.01 IU/mL (D, T) and 0.15 µg/mL (PRP) were used for non-inferiority testing at 1 month post-Dose 2.  
Diphtheria: 100 and 99% of subjects in the Hexacima and Infanrix Hexa group, respectively, showed 
(long-term) seroprotection levels > 0.1 IU/mL at 1 month post-Dose 3. At this time point, higher GMCs of 
1.7 IU/mL were achieved in the Hexacima group compared to 1.2 IU/mL in the Infanrix Hexa group 
(non-overlapping CI). At 1 month post-Dose 2, 99.6% of subjects in both groups showed short-term 
Type II variation assessment report

seroprotection levels of > 0.01 IU/mL. These levels were still seen in 98% of subjects in both groups 6 
months later at pre-booster time point. 
Tetanus:  100% of subjects in both groups showed (long-term) seroprotection at >  0.1 IU/mL at 1 month 
post-dose 3. At this time point, similar GMCs of 2.2 and 2.4 IU/mL were achieved in the Hexacima and 
Infanrix hexa group, respectively. All subjects in both groups showed short-term seroprotection at >  
0.01 IU/mL at 1 month post-dose 2. These levels were still detected in all subjects of both groups at 
pre-dose 3. 
PT, FHA: Between 98 and 100% of subjects in both groups showed vaccine response as defined by 
antibody levels  > 4x LLOQ (i.e., > 8 EU/mL) at 1 month post-3rd dose. At this time point, subjects of 
Hexacima and Infanrix hexa groups showed GMC of 91 and 129 EU/mL for PT and 148 and 167 EU/mL for 
FHA, respectively. The corresponding antibody levels at 1 month post-dose 2 were in the same range or 
somewhat lower, i.e, at 105 and 106 EU/mL for PT and 95 and 98 EU/mL for FHA, respectively. Until 
pre-dose-3, these levels decreased to 21 and 24 EU/mL for PT and 31 and 29 EU/mL for FHA in the 
Hexacima and Infanrix hexa group, respectively. 
In the Hexacima and Infanrix Hexa groups, 48 respective 45% and 80 respective 82% of subjects had 
detectable PT and FHA levels > LLOQ (i.e., > 2EU/mL) already at baseline (=pre-Dose 1). The GMC for PT 
lay at 2.5 and 2.2 EU/mL in the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa group, respectively. For FHA, GMC of 3.7 and 
3.9 EU/mL, respectively, were found. In both groups, subjects showed antibody increases of at least 
37-fold from baseline to 1 month post-dose 3 indicating a significant seroconversion for both antigens. 
Additionally, both groups showed a considerable booster response as mean PT and FHA antibody GMC 
increased at least 4.4-fold from pre-dose 3 to 1 month post-dose 3. 
Polio type 1, 2, and 3: 99 to 100% of subjects in both groups showed protective antibody levels > 8 
(1/dil.) against polio type 1, 2, and 3 at 1 month post-dose 3. After 2 vaccine doses, seroprotection was 
achieved by at least 90% of subjects in both groups. High anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 titres of >1200 (1/dil.) 
were achieved following 3 vaccine doses in both groups. Respective titres lay in the range of 60 - 142 
(1/dil.) at 1 month post-dose 2 and decreased to 14 – 27 (1/dil.) until pre-3rd dose. Generally, geometric 
mean anti-polio titres of the Hexacima group were lower than those of the Infanrix hexa group (mostly 
non-overlapping CI). 
Hep B: 96.4 vs. 99.6 % of subjects in the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa group, respectively, showed 
seroprotective anti-Hep B levels > 10mIU/mL at 1 month post-dose 3 (with overlapping CI). 
Corresponding seroprotection rates lay at 97 and 98% at 1 month post-2nd dose and at 88 and 98%, 
respectively, at pre-dose 3 (the latter with non-overlapping CI). At post-3rd dose, 45% of subjects in the 
Hexacima group compared to 81% in the Infanrix hexa group reached optimal anti-Hep B levels > 
100mIU/mL.  
Compared to Infanrix hexa, much lower GMC (1370 vs. 5015 mIU/mL) were achieved in the Hexacima 
group at 1 month post-dose 3. Similarly, at 1 month post-dose 2 and prior to dose 3, GMC were lower in 
the Hexacima group (401 vs. 699 and 77 vs. 260 mIU/mL, respectively; with non-overlapping CI at each 
time point).  
PRP: Following 3 doses of Hexacima or Infanrix hexa, 94 vs. 85% of subjects showed seroprotection 
against PRP at > 1 µg/mL. At post-dose 2, 72 and 58% of subjects in the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa 
group, respectively, showed short-term protection at antibody levels > 0.15 µg/mL. These rates 
decreased to 51 and 41% in the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa group, respectively, until pre-dose 3. 
Generally, GMC were about twice as high in the Hexacima group compared to the Infanrix hexa group: 
0.51 vs. 0.23 µg/mL at post-dose 2 and 9.7 vs. 5.6 µg/mL at post-dose 3 (with non-overlapping CI).

Immunogenicity against Prevenar 13 (secondary endpoints; Table 8 and Table 9): 
Immunogenicity against Prevenar 13 antigens was assessed in a subset of vaccinees (164 and 162 
subjects in the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa PP1 group, respectively) at 1 month post-dose 3 only. Please 
note that no functional antibody assay (OPA) was performed on sera obtained in study A3L38. 
Seroprotective antibody levels of > 0.35 µg/mL against every serotype were obtained in 98 to 100% of 
subjects in both groups except for serotype 3, for which seroprotection rates of 86 and 88% were 
achieved in the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa group, respectively.  The GMCs ranged from 0.7 to 6.8 μg/mL 
in the Hexacima group and from 0.8 to 7.8 μg/mL in the Infanrix hexa group. However, for many 
serotypes, somewhat lower GMC were found in the Hexacima group compared to the Infanrix Hexa group 
(with non-overlapping CI). 
Assessor’s comment: 
The immunogenicity of Hexacima in terms of seroprotection/ vaccine response rate was non-inferior to 
that of Infanrix hexa for every antigen at 1 month after the 3rd dose. Both hexavalent vaccines elicited 
similar antibody responses against each valence following the 2+1 vaccination scheme with 
co-administration of Prevenar 13. The protective antibody titers chosen by the sponsor to calculate 
seroprotection/vaccine response rates were accepted surrogates (for PT and FHA) or established 
correlates (other antigens) of protection. 
Compared to Infanrix Hexa, generally lower GMC were achieved for Hep B and polio type 1, 2, and 3 but 
higher GMC for D and PRP following vaccination with Hexacima. Additionally, in the Hexacima group, 
lower antibody levels were seen for several PCV13 serotypes. Despite these differences in GM titers, 
overall both hexavalent vaccines induced very similar seroprotection/vaccine response rates following the 
primary (2 doses) and booster vaccination indicating that Hexacima and Infanrix hexa provide equal 
protection against diseases to infants following the 2+1 vaccination schedule at 3, 5, and 11 to 12 MoA.  
Following co-administration of PCV13, Hexacima and Infanrix hexa equally induced antibody titers > 0.35  
µg/ml against pneumococcal serotypes  1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F in >95% of 
subjects. The respective seroresponse against serotype 3 was lower, i.e. 86% in the Hexacima group and 
88% in the Infanrix hexa group. The results confirm that Hexacima can be equally well administered 
concomitantly with Prevenar 13 in the 2+1 as in the 3+1 vaccination schedule.

%: percentages were calculated according to the subjects available for the endpoint. 
* Vaccine response for PT and FHA defined as: post-Dose 2 Ab concentrations ≥ 4 × LLOQ, if pre-Dose 1 Ab concentrations < 4 × LLOQ; Post-Dose 2 Ab concentrations 
≥  pre-Dose 1, if pre-Dose 1 Ab concentrations ≥  4 × LLOQ 
† The 95% CI was calculated based on the Wilson score method without continuity correction as described by Newcombe R.G. 
‡ If lower bound of 95% CI was greater than -δ then the null hypothesis H0 was rejected and we could conclude for the non-inferiority (same statistical method as the one used for 
the primary objective was applied).

Study A3L24 
Demographic parameters of the children in the two subgroups were similar between the subgroups and to 
the ‘all subjects’ groups. 
Lot-to-lot consistency had been demonstrated in the study, thus, the pooled data are discussed only. As 
the ITT and PP results were also very similar the ITT results are shown here. 
Anti-PT 
30 days after the second dose all subgroup subjects in all vaccination groups showed a 4-fold increase of 
the titres and the resulting GMTs were similar. There was no significant titre increase resulting from the 
3rd dose. 
Anti-FHA 
30 days after the second dose all subgroup subjects in all vaccination groups showed a 4-fold increase of 
the titres and the resulting GMTs were similar. Titres doubled roughly from the second to the third dose. 
After three doses there was a statistically significant higher GMT in the Hexyon groups compared to the 
Infanrix hexa group. 
Anti-PRP 
30 days after the second dose >70% of the subgroup subjects in all vaccination groups had at least 
reached seroprotection levels (≥  0.15 µg/ml) and ~30% long-term protection levels of  ≥ 1µg/ml. After 
the third dose nearly all subjects had reached seroprotection and 70% the long-term protection levels. 
GMTs were again similar between the different vaccination groups although slightly lower in the Infanrix 
hexa group.

4.3.3.  Discussion 
Study A3L38 
After  a  complete  2+1  vaccination  schedule,  non-inferiority  of  Hexacima  to  Infanrix  hexa  was 
demonstrated for each valence. High proportions of subjects (94 to 100% in the Hexacima group and 85 
to 100% in the Infanrix hexa group) showed seroprotection or vaccine response rates above thresholds 
defined as established correlates or accepted surrogates of protection.  
Compared to Infanrix Hexa, generally lower GMC were achieved for Hep B and polio type 1, 2, and 3 but 
higher GMC for D and PRP following vaccination with Hexacima. Additionally, in the Hexacima group, 
lower antibody levels were seen for several PCV13 serotypes. Despite these differences in GM titers, 
overall both hexavalent vaccines induced very similar seroprotection/vaccine response rates following the 
primary (2 doses) and booster vaccination indicating that Hexacima and Infanrix hexa provide equal 
protection against diseases to infants following the 2+1 vaccination schedule at 3, 5, and 11 to 12 MoA.  
Study A3L24 
The descriptive analysis of the post-dose 2 results in the subgroups tested for anti-PT, anti-FHA and 
anti-PRP shows that the final anti-PT GMTs are already reached after two doses of either Hexyon or 
Infanrix hexa. Anti-FHA and anti-PT are both significantly increased with a further dose. Seroprotection 
against Hib is only achieved in 70% of subjects after two doses and long-term protection levels in only 
30% regardless of the vaccine used. After three doses for primary immunization nearly all subjects have 
seroprotection and >70% long-term protection thresholds reached. The GMT of anti-FHA is doubled with 
the third dose.  
4.4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study A3L38 
Safety endpoints (secondary only): 
•  Occurrence of any unsolicited AEs reported in the 30 minutes after each and any dose 
•  Occurrence of solicited, i.e. pre-listed in the subject’s diary and eCRF, injection site and systemic 
reactions (always considered related to vaccination) occurring up to 7 days after each and any 
dose 
Prelisted injection site reactions were: injection site tenderness, injection site erythema, injection 
site swellings, and, after administration of the third dose at 11 to 12 MoA, extensive swelling of 
the vaccinated limb (ELS).  
Solicited systemic reactions were: fever, vomiting, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite lost, 
and irritability. 
•  Occurrence of unsolicited (spontaneously reported) AEs up to 30 days after each and any dose 
including documentation of start and stop dates, intensity of event, action taken if any (e.g. 
medication), and whether AE led to study discontinuation. 
AEs likely to be related to the product that persisted at the end of the trial were followed up by the 
investigator until their complete disappearance or the stabilization of the subject’s condition.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Extensive limb swelling (ELS), hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) and convulsions (whether febrile 
or not), anaphylactic reactions, apnea, severe neurological conditions are considered as important 
identified or potential risks due to the age group, morbidity specifics of the vaccinated population and 
historical data on similar combined vaccines. Although no increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS) or sudden unexpected death (SUD) has been associated with hexavalent pediatric vaccines, these 
events are considered as other AESI and were closely monitored. By definition, convulsions, HHE, 
anaphylactic reactions, severe neurological conditions and fatal outcomes were to be considered as SAEs. 
Medical judgment of the investigator was required to assess seriousness of extensive limb swelling and 
apnea. 
The Safety Analysis Set (SafAS) included, for each dose, the subset of subjects having received this 
dose. Out of the 554 randomized subjects, 546 subjects received at least 1 vaccine dose and were 
included in the SafAS. Of these 546 subjects 271 subjects received at least 1 dose of Hexacima 
concomitantly with Prevenar 13 and 275 subjects received at least 1 dose of Infanrix hexa concomitantly 
with Prevenar 13. A total of 541 subjects (99.1%) were included in the SafAS at post-dose 2 and 535 
subjects (98.0%) in the SafAS at post-dose 3. 
Study A3L24 
No (additional) safety data were collected. 
4.4.2.  Results 
Study A3L38 
An overview of the safety results is presented in Table 12 for the SafAS. 
Immediate unsolicited AEs were not observed in any subject. 
Most subjects in both groups experienced at least 1 solicited injection site reaction (94% in the Hexacima 
and 89% in the Infanrix hexa Group) and at least 1 solicited systemic reaction (100% in the Hexacima 
and 99% in the Infanrix hexa group). 
Injection site reactions 
Pain, erythema, and swelling were the most frequent solicited injection site reactions reported by up to 
80% of subjects within 7d following vaccination at both administration sites (hexavalent vaccine and 
Prevenar 13). They were observed with similar frequencies for the Hexacima and Infanrix hexa 
administration site as well as for the Prevenar 13 administration site with a tendency of higher frequencies 
after the 3rd injection. However, overall injection site pain was more frequently observed after Hexacima 
injection than after Infanrix hexa injection (80 vs. 69% of subjects after any injection, Table 13). This 
mainly affected site pain of grade 2 (for more details refer to study A3L38 CSR, tables 9.92 ff.).  
Most injection site reactions were of grade 1 to 2, were reported within the first 3 days after vaccination 
and lasted a maximum of 3 days. 
Solicited systemic reactions 
Overall, no differences were observed between groups regarding frequency of vomiting, crying, 
somnolence, anorexia (appetite loss), or irritability which were experienced by up to 97% of subjects 
within 7d after at least one vaccination (Table 14). However, pyrexia (> 38.0°C) was recorded more

frequently in the Hexacima group compared to the Infanrix hexa group (82 vs. 69%, respectively).  
Unsolicited AEs and ARs 
A similar proportion of subjects reported unsolicited AEs (73% in the Hexacima group and 80% in the 
Infanrix hexa group) and unsolicited ARs (18% in the Hexacima and 21% in the Infanrix hexa group).  
For both vaccine groups, the most frequent unsolicited AEs reported both within 7 d as well as within 30 
d after any vaccination were in the SOC of ‘infections and infestations’ and  ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ 
(Table 15 and Table 16).  
Neither of these unsolicited AEs/ARs were serious, except for 1 subject in the Infanrix hexa group who 
experienced urticaria in relation to the 3rd dose of Infanrix hexa (see below). 
SAEs 
A total of 30 subjects experienced 33 SAEs during the course of the study. In the Hexacima group, 15 
subjects experienced 1 SAE each; and in the Infanrix hexa group, 12 subjects reported 1 SAE each and 3 
subjects reported 2 SAEs each. Within 30 days after any vaccination, 8 subjects in the Hexacima group 
and 7 subjects in the Infanrix hexa group experienced an SAE. 5 SAEs were reported within 7 d 
post-vaccination, 3 in the Hexacima group and 2 in the Infanrix hexa group. These SAEs comprised 2 
cases of bronchitis and one case of otitis media in the Hexacima group and one case each of apnea and 
urticaria in the Infanrix hexa group. Only the urticaria on the day of 3rd injection with Infanrix hexa was 
vaccine-related (see below).  
Of the 30 subjects in both vaccine groups who experienced SAEs, 3 subjects discontinued. In the 
Hexacima group, 1 subject discontinued 17 days after the first dose due to petechiae; in the Infanrix hexa 
group, 1 subject discontinued due to cerebral palsy reported 36 days after the 2nd dose, and 1 subject 
discontinued due to epilepsy reported 5 months after the 2nd dose.  
Apart from the urticaria case reported for one subject on the day of the 3rd Infanrix hexa injection (see 
below), none of the other 32 SAEs were related to treatment.  
AESIs 
3 AESIs were experienced during the study: 1 subject in the Hexacima group reported febrile convulsion; 
and 2 subjects in the Infanrix hexa group presented with apnea or convulsions. None of the AESIs were 
related to vaccination.  
There were no deaths during the study.  
Selected narratives, Hexacima group: 
One male subject aged 3 months developed petechiae on face, chest, and extremities 17 days after the 
1st vaccination with Hexacima and Prevenar 13. He also received one dose of RotaTeq on the same 
vaccination day. The subject had a family history of easy bruising (father) and bleeding in operations 
(grandmother). Laboratory test showed low vitamin K-dependent and hepatic blood clotting factors, low 
fibrinogen and thromboplastin time decreased at 64%. The subject received vitamin K i.m. He was 
reported to have bleeding disorder, with petechiae still ongoing. No etiology for low hepatic blood clotting 
factors was found. The SAE was reported as unrelated to vaccination; the subject discontinued .  
One 4-month-old female experienced fever at 39°C and convulsions 41 days after the 1st vaccination with 
Hexacima and Prevenar 13. She also received RotaTeq on the same vaccination day. The convulsion was 
considered due to rapid fever rise in influenza. Nasal swab test for influenza A non-vH1N1 type was 
proven positive; EEG was normal. Following treatment with paracetamol and ibuprofen, the subject fully 
recovered and continued in the trial. The event of febrile convulsion was reported as unrelated to

vaccination.  
Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/707880/2020 
Page 31/37 
 
  
  
 
 
Selected narratives, Infanrix hexa group: 
A female subject developed cerebral palsy 36 days after 2nd vaccination with Infanrix hexa concomitantly 
with Prevenar 13. She had also received RotaTeq on the same day. The clinical examination revealed 
spastic hemiplegia of the left hand. Left-sided motor impairment was evident in both upper and lower 
limb, but was more severe in the arm. The subject’s medical history reported delivery in poor health with 
vacuum extraction and low Apgar value probably because of umbilical cord slung twice around the neck. 
The subject recovered with sequelae. She discontinued due to the SAE. The SAE was reported as 
unrelated to study vaccination and trial procedures. 
Another female experienced convulsions attack with tremble of hands 5 months after 2nd vaccination with 
Infanrix hexa concomitantly with Prevenar 13, again plus additional vaccination with RotaTeq. The girl 
was hospitalized with diagnosis of epilepsy. MRI revealed inborn developmental disorder in the left brain 
block (Dandy-Walker malformations in cerebellum). She discontinued due to the SAE. The investigator 
reported the event of epilepsy as unrelated to vaccination and unrelated to trial procedures. 
Four days after the first Infanrix hexa plus Prevenar 13 dose a female subject experienced 2 episodes of 
apnea (gasping for breath) for few seconds within one day with the 1st episode following feeding. Clinical 
examination was normal, aspiration was excluded. The reason for apnea episodes was suspected diving 
reflex due to the subject mother’s plentiful milk production. The subject recovered without any new 
episodes of apnea and continued in the trial. She experienced otitis media serosa at 6.5 months post-2nd 
vaccine dose and underwent tympanostomy. She recovered under chloramphenicol treatment. The 
(S)AEs for this subject were reported unrelated to vaccination and trial procedures.  
A male subject experienced convulsions 10 days after 2nd dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13. He had 
also received a RotaTeq dose on the same day. Further episodes of head and neck stiffness and/ or right 
arm shaking were documented on several days afterwards with last convulsions episode at 40 days-post 
vaccination. EEG was normal. The probable diagnosis was infant benign epilepsy. The subject recovered 
without treatment and continued in the trial. The convulsions were reported as unrelated to vaccination 
and trial procedures.  
A male subject experienced extensive urticaria 6 hours after the 3rd vaccination with Infanrix hexa 
concomitantly with Prevenar 13. The urticaria worsened after hospitalization. The subject had a medical 
history of atopic eczema, milk allergy and egg allergy plus a family history of allergies from food, animal, 
pollen, and penicillin (parents). He fully recovered under prolonged treatment with antihistamine and 
corticosteroids and continued in the trial. The event of urticarial was reported by the investigator as 
related to vaccination and unrelated to the trial procedure.  
Assessor’s comments: 
Solicited (injection site and systemic) reactions, unsolicited AEs, and unsolicited ARs were reported with 
similar frequencies between the 2 vaccine groups. Few subjects in both groups reported AEs of grade 3.  
From the narratives provided by the sponsor it can be inferred that none of the SAEs were related to 
vaccination. An exception was the urticaria case in a subject with a history of food allergy which was 
(causally and timely) related to the 3rd vaccination with Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13.  
Overall, no new safety signals emerged during the course of study A3L38.

4.4.3.  Discussion 
The safety profile of Hexacima was generally similar to Infanrix hexa although a higher rate of subjects in 
the Hexacima group reported pain and fever. 
Overall, there is no safety concern with Hexacima administered in a 2+1 schedule. 
There  is  no  interaction  with  Prevenar  13  in  terms  of  immune  responses  or  safety  profile,  when  it  is 
administered concomitantly with Hexacima. 
4.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated.  
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Clinical aspects -Changes to the packet leaflet: 
To avoid misuse in the 2+1 vaccination schedule with only 1 month in between the 1st and 2nd dose the 
assessor suggests the following change: 
First course of vaccination (primary vaccination) 
‘Your child will receive two or three injections given at an interval of one to two months (at least 
four weeks apart). This vaccine should be used according to the local vaccination programme.’ 
Should be adjusted to: 
‘Your  child  will  receive  either  two  injections  given  at  an  interval  of  two  months  or  three 
injections given at an interval of one to two months (at least four weeks apart). This vaccine should 
be used according to the local vaccination programme. ‘   
This was accepted. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Saxenda to assess, tolerability, pharmacokinetics 
and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide in obese children aged 7 to 11 years, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Trial NN8022-4181 is part of the PIP (EMEA 000128-PIP02-09) for Saxenda®, liraglutide 3 mg for 
weight management. The PIP comprises 7 studies (one quality study, one nonclinical study and 5 
clinical trials) and is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Trial NN8022-4181 (hereafter referred to as 
trial 4181) is the second of the 5 planned paediatric clinical trials to be completed. This trial 
investigates the safety, tolerability and PK of liraglutide at doses up to 3.0 mg in children with obesity 
(7−11 years and Tanner stage 1) over 7 weeks of treatment (with option to prolong treatment to 13 
weeks) prior to the initiation of a longer-term trial investigating the efficacy and safety of liraglutide 
3.0 mg in young children with obesity. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures. A waiver for the paediatric 
populations 0-2 years and 2-5 years of age was granted and a deferral for the trials in the age groups 
of 6-11 years and 12-17 years. The Agency’s decision was agreed on 11 May 2012 
(EMA/PDCO/266178). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that trial NN8022-4181 is part of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Saxenda® 3 
mg. The extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several 
studies) is expected to be submitted by 2023. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Liraglutide is a long-acting analogue of GLP-1. Liraglutide has been shown to stimulate insulin 
secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, thereby improving fasting and 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 4/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
postprandial glycaemia. The weight-reducing effect of liraglutide largely follows from influence on 
appetite regulation (fullness, satiety, hunger and prospective food consumption), which leads to 
lowering of caloric intake. Liraglutide has been approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise for adult 
weight management in the US in December 2014 and has since received marketing authorisation in 
other countries and regions, including the EU in 2015. 
Liraglutide should be administered once-daily by subcutaneous injection. The formulation of liraglutide 
used in trial 4181 was the same as that used in clinical trials in adults. Liraglutide (6.0 mg/ml) was 
provided in a prefilled device (Novo Nordisk FlexPen® pen injector) and was self-administered by the 
subjects or with assistance from subjects parents or representative. The placebo product contained the 
same excipients as liraglutide 6.0 mg/mL, 3 mL cartridge, but without the active ingredient, liraglutide. 
Liraglutide and placebo were supplied in similar 3 mL FlexPen® devices and were visually identical. 
All excipients in the liraglutide formulation are considered suitable for the paediatric/adolescent 
population.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Trial NN8022-4181, A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide in obese children aged 7 to 11 
years. 
2.3.1.  Clinical study 
Description 
This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of liraglutide treatment in children with obesity. A total 
of 24 children, 7-11 years of age and at Tanner stage 1 were randomised 2:1 to treatment with either 
liraglutide or placebo. After a screening visit, the subjects entered a 7 week treatment period with 6 
optional flex weeks (one flex week between each of the 7 treatment weeks). A flex week on an 
unchanged or lowered dose was included in case the dose escalation criteria were not met at the end 
of a mandatory treatment week. Subjects attended a follow-up visit 10-17 days after the last dose. 
Treatment with liraglutide (or the corresponding volume of placebo) was administered by 
subcutaneous injections according to a dose-escalation schedule starting at a dose of 0.3 mg/day. The 
dose was then gradually increased in weekly steps of 0.3 mg to a maximum dose of 3.0 mg/day. If 
during dose-escalation the higher dose was not tolerated, the dose could be reduced (or kept at the 
same dose) and the subject could stay on the dose the remainder of the trial (see Figure 1). 
Additionally, there were 6 optional flex weeks (one flex week between each of the treatment weeks). 
Therefore, the treatment period could be prolonged up to 13 weeks in case a flex week was needed 
between all 7 treatments. 
Safety and tolerability was assessed during the entire trial. PK blood sampling for Ctrough assessments 
to investigate dose proportionality was performed prior to the subjects taking their daily dose of 
liraglutide or placebo at visits 3 to 8. In addition, PK blood sampling for population PK analysis 
(modelling) was performed after the last dose administration according to the specific sampling 
scheme.

Methods 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple once-daily doses of liraglutide at doses up to 
3.0 mg in obese children aged 7-11 years and at Tanner stage 1. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
To assess the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide in steady state at doses up to 3.0 mg in obese 
children aged 7-11 years and at Tanner stage 1 
To assess the pharmacodynamics of liraglutide in steady state at doses up to 3.0 mg in obese 
children aged 7-11 years and at Tanner stage 1 
Study design 
Figure 1. Study design 
Study population /Sample size 
A sample size of 11 subjects on active treatment (liraglutide) and 4 on placebo was considered 
sufficient to evaluate safety and tolerability as well as make appropriate assessments of PK endpoints. 
In order to account for drop-outs, it was planned to randomise 14 subjects to active treatment and 7 
subjects to placebo; thus a total of 21 subjects were planned for enrolment into the trial. 
Paediatric subjects from the age of 7 to 11 years (both inclusive) and at Tanner stage 1 (pre-pubertal), 
including children with premature adrenarche (development of pubic hair without the child having 
entered true puberty), were the target population for this trial. The lower age boundary of 7 years was 
set in accordance with the requirement from the FDA to the lower age for this paediatric population in 
clinical trials for weight management. The combination of age and Tanner staging was used in the trial 
population selection due to the variability in the onset of normal pubertal development and in 
agreement with the Paediatric Committee in EU (PDCO).

The key inclusion criteria were: 
•  Male or female subjects 7-11 years of age (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed 
consent 
• 
Tanner stage 1 (including subjects with premature adrenarche) at the time of signing informed 
consent 
•  BMI corresponding to ≥30 kg/m2 for adults by international cut-off points and BMI ≤45 kg/m2 as 
well as BMI ≥95th percentile for age and gender at the time of signing informed consent 
The key exclusion criteria: 
•  Subjects with secondary causes of childhood obesity (i.e., hypothalamic, genetic or endocrine 
causes) 
•  Subjects with confirmed bulimia nervosa disorder 
•  Diagnosis of DM type 1 or type 2 as defined by HbA1c ≥6.5% 
•  Subjects with Tanner stage 2-5 (except subjects with premature adrenarche) at the time of 
screening 
•  History of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) 
• 
• 
Presence of severe co-morbidities as judged by the investigator 
Family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or medullary thyroid 
carcinoma 
•  History of major depressive disorder within 2 years before randomisation 
Treatments 
Treatment with liraglutide (or the corresponding volume of placebo) was initiated with 0.3 mg 
liraglutide daily for one week and increased in weekly steps, with 6 optional flex weeks (one flex week 
between each of the treatment weeks) until a maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide or maximum 
tolerated dose. The dose was not escalated if the subject had had fasting plasma glucose below 3.1 
mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in the presence of symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 
the previous week. Additionally, the dose was not escalated if the previous dose was not tolerated with 
respect to AEs, as judged by investigators. For subjects who could not comply with the dose escalation 
criteria, the current dose was maintained for another week or the dose was lowered. The treatment 
period was 7 weeks with option to prolong up to 13 weeks in case a flex week was needed between all 
7 treatments. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was: 
•  Number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) recorded from the time of first dosing 
and until completion of follow-up visit 
The supportive secondary safety endpoints were: 
•  Number of treatment-emergent hypoglycaemic events from time of first dosing and until 
completion of follow-up visit 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in physical examination 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in laboratory tests: 
–  Haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis 
–  Calcitonin, amylase, lipase 
–  Lipids: total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides

–  Hormones: IGF-1, TSH, free T4, DHEAS, LH, FSH, CEA, cortisol, ACTH, estradiol (for 
females only) and testosterone (for males only) 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in ECG 
• 
Incidence of anti-liraglutide antibody at follow up 
Pharmacokinetics 
The secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints were: 
•  C trough during dose escalation 
•  CL/F at steady state following the last dose 
•  AUC0-24h at steady state following the last dose 
Pharmacodynamics 
The secondary exploratory PD endpoints were: 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in BMI z-score 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight 
•  Change from baseline to end of treatment in fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin and HbA1c 
CHMP comment: 
The secondary exploratory PD endpoints are acceptable. The BMI z-score represents a measure of 
weight, adjusted for height, sex, and age, relative to a reference distribution.  
At the randomisation visit (visit 2), the subjects and their parent(s) or representatives were instructed 
in the symptoms and treatment of hypoglycaemia and how to measure blood glucose. The subjects 
and their parent(s) or representatives were instructed to measure the subject’s blood 
glucoseconcentration in case of symptoms of hypoglycaemia and to record the episode in the subject’s 
diary. 
However, the glucose measurements during the trial were performed with a glucometer by the 
subject. From glucometers it is known that they show a wide variability in glucose measurements and 
most often they measure capillary glucose, which may differ from whole blood or plasma glucose 
measurements.

Statistical Methods 
Full analysis set (FAS) – all subjects who were randomised and who received at least one dose of trial 
product. In exceptional cases, subjects could have been eliminated from the FAS. In such cases the 
elimination was to be justified and documented. Subjects contributed to the evaluation ‘as treated’. 
The Safety analysis set (SAS) is identical to the FAS. 
No formal statistical testing was performed for any of the safety or tolerability endpoints and summary 
statistics by treatment were the primary mode of statistical presentation of safety data. 
Changes in BMI z-score and body weight were analysed in a linear model with treatment as a fixed 
factor with two levels (active or placebo) and baseline values as covariate. Treatment difference was 
estimated with 95% CI. 
CHMP comment: 
The proposed analysis sets are considered acceptable for a trial aimed at safety/tolerability, PK and 
PD. Safety and tolerability will assessed using summary statistics and changes in BMI z-score will be 
tested using a linear model, which is acceptable. However it is not clear how patients withdrawing 
from the trial will be handled in the PD analysis. From the results it appears the PD analyses were 
based on observed cases and thus more using a per protocol analysis set. Nevertheless, since this 
concerns secondary exploratory endpoints this can be acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetic modelling 
The objective of the analysis is to study the liraglutide exposure in obese children aged 7 to 11 years 
and to investigate the effects on liraglutide plasma concentrations of pre-specified covariates for these 
subjects. A previously developed population PK model for liraglutide will be used. For the PK model, the 
CL/F will be estimated, while other model parameters may be set to prior pre-defined estimates (based 
on data from other trials in other populations). AUC0-24h in steady state will be derived from CL/F. The 
covariates of interest, such as body weight, sex and age group (children/adolescent/adult), will be 
tested on CL/F. The mean (95% CI) estimate for CL/F and AUC0-24h for each age group will be 
reported. Data from all 3 trials was included, trial 4181 children with obesity aged 7-11, trial 3967 
adolescents with obesity and trial 3630 adults with obesity, see treatment schedules in Table 2 and 
blood sampling for liraglutide in Table 3. The final compiled data set based on all three trials contained 
614 PK observations from 55 subjects.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 33 subjects were screened for the trial, 9 subjects failed screening and 24 subjects were 
eligible, randomised and exposed to treatment. Sixteen (16) subjects were randomised and exposed to 
liraglutide and 8 were randomised and exposed to placebo. Four (4) subjects withdrew from the trial (2 
liraglutide and 2 placebo). See Table 4 for details on subject disposition. 
A total of 20 subjects completed the trial (14 liraglutide treated subjects and 6 placebo treated 
subjects). A total of 19 subjects reached the maximum dose of 3.0 mg (14 liraglutide treated subjects, 
5 placebo treated subjects). One subject reached a maximum dose of 2.4 mg liraglutide and remained 
at this dose for a third week coinciding with the last week in the trial. Two subjects used 1 flex week 
and were treated with liraglutide 0.9 mg for two weeks before escalating the dose. Both subjects 
reached the liraglutide 3.0 mg maximum dose. No subjects were treated beyond 8 weeks. Both the full 
analysis set (FAS) and safety analysis set (SAS) included 16 liraglutide treated subjects and 8 placebo 
treated subjects (24 subjects total).

Table 4. Subject disposition 
CHMP comment: 
24 patients were randomized, 2 out of 16 patients withdrawn in the liraglutide group compared to 2 
out of 8 patients in the placebo group, this is acceptable. Except for one subject, the study population 
reached a maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide. The exposure to the maximum dose of 3.0 mg 
liraglutide in this trial was only one week.  
In the first trial of paediatric clinical trials for Saxenda (trial 3967, EMA/H/C/003780/P46) tolerability/ 
pharmacokinetics in 12-17 year old children with primary obesity was assessed, the exposure to the 
maximum dose of 3.0 mg for a period of only one week was  identical. 
Baseline data 
The overall trial population consisted of more males (15) than females (9). Although, there was an 
even distribution observed in the liraglutide treatment group (i.e., 8 males and 8 females, 16 subjects 
total), an imbalance was evident in the placebo treatment group where 7 of the subjects were male 
and 1 subject was female.  The mean age was 9.9 years (ranging between 7 and 11 years) in the 
overall trial population, with no major difference between the treatment groups. 
A small difference in height was observed between treatment groups. Mean height of the liraglutide 
treatment group was shorter than the placebo treatment group.  
A difference in mean body weight (kg) between treatment groups was observed. On average, mean 
weight in the liraglutide treatment group was 66.6 kg, lighter than the mean body weight (81.4 kg) of 
the placebo group. Body weight ranged from 45.0 to 86.8 kg in the liraglutide treatment group 
compared to 68.1 to 115.4 kg in the placebo treatment group. For the overall trial population, the 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 11/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
mean BMI z-score was 3.9. The two groups were similar with regard to BMI z-score, which took age 
and gender into consideration. See Table 3. 
Table 5. Demographics and baseline characteristics 
CHMP comment: 
In the placebo group, an imbalance between boys and girls was reported with 87.5% males. This 
could be associated with the difference in mean body weight (81.4kg in the placebo group at baseline, 
versus 66.6 kg in the liraglutide group).  
In the liraglutide group an even sex distribution was observed.  
Compared to trials in adults relative more children with a Hispanic or Latino background were included 
(37.5% in the liraglutide and placebo group, compared to 9.5% in adult trials with saxenda (MAA for 
Saxenda)). In the liraglutide group 43.8% of children had a black or African American origin, 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 12/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
compared to 37.5% in the placebo group; in adult trials 10% of subjects was of black of African 
American. It is unknown of ethnicity and race will influence the results; however, in adults there was 
no indication that race or ethnicity had an impact on the adverse event pattern. 
As BMI z-scores (representing a measure of weight, adjusted for height, sex, and age, relative to a 
reference distribution) were comparable between liraglutide and placebo group, and the sex 
distribution was even in the liraglutide group, the assessor agrees with the use of BMI z-score as a 
secondary outcome measure.  
Efficacy results 
The primary endpoint in this trial was related to safety and tolerability and the evaluation of the 
primary endpoint is therefore presented in the safety section. 
Safety results 
TEAE: 
More treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported In the liraglutide group compared to 
the placebo group; 9 subjects (56.3%) in the liraglutide group reported 37 TEAEs during the trial 
compared to 5 subjects (62.5%) in the placebo group reporting 12 TEAEs. The majority of the TEAEs 
reported in the liraglutide group were mild in severity (35 of 37 mild events); the remaining 2 of the 
TEAEs were moderate. In the placebo group, 11 TEAEs were mild in severity and 1 event was of 
moderate severity. No severe TEAEs were reported during the trial in either treatment group. 
Of the TEAEs reported in the liraglutide treatment group, 21 events (corresponding to 57%) were 
considered to have probable or possible relation to the trial product. In the placebo group, 2 events 
(corresponding to 17%)  were considered to have probable or possible relation to the trial product. For 
the liraglutide treatment group, the TEAEs were mainly reported within the system organ class (SOC) 
‘gastrointestinal disorders’ with vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain representing the most common 
preferred terms within this SOC. For the placebo treatment group, the TEAEs were mainly report within 
the SOC ‘nervous system disorders’ with headache and dizziness representing the most common 
preferred terms within this SOC.  
Subject IDs  and used a flex week at 0.9 mg due to vomiting. Subject ID , used a flex with at 2.4 mg 
and remained at that dose for a third week coinciding with the last week of the trial and did not receive 
the maximum dose of 3.0 mg.  The two reported TEAEs (vomiting) of moderate severity were reported 
by subject ID . 
No TEAEs led to withdrawal of subjects from the trial.

Table 6. Summary of treatment emergent adverse events – safety analysis set 
CHMP comment: 
9 subjects (56.3%) in the liraglutide group reported 37 TEAEs during the trial. The majority of the 
TEAEs reported in the liraglutide group were mild in severity (35 of 37 mild events) and included 
gastrointestinal complaints mainly vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain. 
In the adult population the most common reported side effects are gastrointestinal complaints as well 
(≥1/10), no difference was seen in the children population included in this trial.

- No severe or BG-confirmed episodes were reported during the trial (i.e., all subjects were able to 
treat themselves).  
- More subjects in the liraglutide group reported hypoglycaemic episodes compared to the placebo 
group; 5 hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in 4 subjects in the liraglutide treatment group 
compared to 1 episode in 1 subject in the placebo group). All of these hypoglycaemic episodes were 
classified as asymptomatic and the majority occurred after an overnight fast.

Table 8. Hypoglycaemic episodes by classification treatment emergent summary – 
safety analysis set 
CHMP comment: 
At the randomisation visit (visit 2), the subjects and their parent(s) or representatives were instructed 
in the symptoms and treatment of hypoglycaemia and how to measure blood glucose. The glucose 
measurements were to be performed at home after an overnight fast before coming to the trial site 
for the following visit (visits 3-8) or in the case of a suspected hypoglycaemic episode. 
The glucose measurements during the trial were performed with a glucometer by the subject. From 
glucometers it is known that they show a wide variability in glucose measurements and most often 
they measure capillary glucose, which may differ from whole blood or plasma glucose measurements.  
However, no severe hypoglycaemic episodes were reported during the trial. In the current registered 
SmPC a warning regarding hypoglycaemic episodes is already present. Current data do not raise any 
new safety concerns regarding hypoglycaemia.  
Laboratory results: 
• 
There were no clinically relevant changes in hematology, biochemistry, ECG, hormones, lipids 
and calcitonin observed during the trial. 
•  Vital signs;  
o  Resting pulse;  The change in resting pulse from baseline (visit 2) to end of treatment 
(visit 10) was 7 beats per min for the liraglutide treated subjects compared to placebo 
(1 beats per min). 
o  Blood pressure; Overall there was no clinically relevant change in systolic or diastolic 
blood pressure in either treatment groups. 
•  All changes in amylase and lipase were in line with the known safety profile of liraglutide. 
o 
 The mean level of amylase increased during treatment in the liraglutide group 
compared to placebo. The increase in serum amylase was within normal range for 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 16/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
several subjects; however 4 subjects had elevated amylase above the reference range. 
These values were not however considered to be of clinical significance.  
o  A total of 7 subjects in the liraglutide-treated group had lipase values above the 
reference range. No clinically relevant changes in lipase levels in the placebo group 
were observed. 
•  No subjects were positive for positive anti-liraglutide antibodies. 
CHMP comment: 
The change in resting pulse from baseline (visit 2) to end of treatment (visit 10) was 7 beats per min 
for the liraglutide treated subjects compared to placebo (1 beats per min).  This is also seen in the 
adult population. The clinical relevance for the paediatric population is unknown. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics results 
Pharmacokinetics 
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality of liraglutide was investigated based on Ctrough values, see Figure 1. The liraglutide 
concentration appeared to be consistent with dose proportionality, (estimate for 2β was 1.66 [1.26; 
2.19] 95% CI).  
Due to 4 unexpectedly low Ctrough liraglutide concentrations a post-hoc sensitivity analysis was run 
excluding the individual subjects with low liraglutide concentrations. When excluding 4 low liraglutide 
concentration levels, see Figure 2, the increase in liraglutide concentration with increasing dose was 
consistent with dose proportionality (estimate for 2β was 1.94 [1.53; 2.45] 95% CI), supporting the 
conclusions in the primary analysis. Subjects 110012, 110013, 113011, 113012 were excluded from 
the analysis. 
Unexpectedly low liraglutide concentration levels were noted in several subjects. Four (4) subjects 
were identified with low liraglutide Ctrough concentrations. In addition, 5 subjects did not reach the 
expected steady-state concentrations when the last dose was administered. An investigation of sample 
handling, bioanalysis, subject diaries and drug accountability records did not provide an explanation for 
the low concentrations of liraglutide. Therefore investigators were contacted with regard to potential 
compliance issues with self-administration of the trial product. No evidence of non-compliance was 
identified. Hence, the cause of the unexpectedly low concentrations in the individual subjects was not 
determined.

Figure 3: Ctrough of liraglutide at steady state – dose proportionality after excluding 
unusual profiles - full analysis set 
CHMP comments: 
The results of this study demonstrate that the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide can be considered as 
approximately linear but not fully dose proportional. However, the deviation from dose proportionality    
is considered not clinical relevant.  
The applicant performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding data from 4 subjects demonstrating 
unexpectedly low profiles. This approach is not necessarily supported. The criteria for exclusion of 
these profiles is subjective and unclear and these subjects did demonstrate concentration time profiles 
after the last dose. However, the original analysis of the full analysis set supports the conclusion that 
the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide can be considered as approximately linear but not fully dose 
proportional. 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 18/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant performed an adequate investigation of the cause of the unexpected. 
Therefore, these issues are not further pursued. 
The population pharmacokinetic modelling was based on a previously developed model; a 1-
compartment pharmacokinetic model with first order absorption and elimination parameters (ka, CL/F, 
V/F). Between-subject variability parameters (random effects) were included for CL/F and V/F. 
Residual error was described using a proportional error model. The population PK analysis was a meta-
analysis, also including PK data from trials in adolescents aged 13–16 years (NN8022-3967) and adults 
aged 20–72 years (NN8022-3630). 
Population pharmacokinetic modeling 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis resulted in the following model-derived PK parameters for 
children (body weight 53.9-86.8 kg) dosed at 0.3 mg liraglutide. 
•  CL/F: geometric mean: 0.69 l/h [0.6; 0.82] 95% CI 
•  AUC0-24, ss: geometric mean: 1161 h*nmol/l [1002; 1398] 95% CI 
Body weight was found to be the major covariate of importance for liraglutide exposure. Due to 
unexpectedly low liraglutide concentrations in some subjects, a correction factor was used in the 
model-based analysis for population PK analysis. 
Estimated pharmacokinetic properties for the present child trial population were compared with 
estimated pharmacokinetic parameters for an adult trial population with obesity (NN8022-3630) and 
adolescent trial population with obesity (NN8022-3967), see Table 2. The estimated dose-normalised 
liraglutide concentrations at steady-state were higher in children (body weight 53.9-86.8 kg) compared 
to adolescents and adults. After adjusting for differences in body weight, mean concentrations were 
similar in the three age groups see Figure 3.

Figure 4: Dose-normalised average concentrations in children, adolescents and 
adults before (A) and after (B) adjustment for differences in body weight. 
In order to evaluate an appropriate starting dose in children with body weights down to 26 kg (relevant 
for a 6 year old child with obesity), liraglutide concentration profiles were simulated for the first three 
dosing intervals after treatment initiation, as seen in Figure 4.  
Figure 5: Simulated concentration-time profiles in subjects with body weights of 
26 kg following liraglutide starting doses of 0.6 mg (A) and 0.3 mg (B), both 
compared to a starting dose of 0.6 mg in subjects with 50 and 100 kg body weight. 
Concentrations in subjects with low body weights (down to 26 kg) dosed at 0.6 mg were higher than in 
subjects with high body weights (up to 100 kg) at the same dose level. However, for subjects with 
body weights down to 26 kg, concentrations using a lower starting dose of 0.3 mg liraglutide were 
within those seen in subjects with higher body weights (50 to 100 kg) dosed at 0.6 mg. 
CHMP comments: 
Pharmacokinetic modelling seems to be adequately performed. The model was developed and 
assessed during other procedures. Modeling for this younger age groups seems to be less reliable, 
especially since a correction factor was used in the model-based analysis. 
However, the conclusion drawn by the applicant is supported that the steady-state exposure for 
liraglutide 3.0 mg is estimated to be higher in children aged 8-11, compared to adults and 
adolescents. The differences in exposure between age groups could largely be explained by 
differences in body weight. After adjusting for differences in body weight, mean concentrations were 
similar in the three age groups.

indicate a starting dose of 0.3 mg liraglutide. This is based on extensive extrapolation as the actual 
body weight was 54-87kg in this trial, but could indeed be a good starting dose for ongoing or 
planned trials in the paediatric clinical development. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The PD results for BMI z-score, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and HbA1c are presented 
in Table 10: 
Table 10. BMI z-score, body weight, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1C – 
statistical analysis 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 21/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following pharmacodynamics conclusions could be drawn: 
BMI z-score; Comparing change from baseline to end of treatment, there was a statistically 
significant treatment difference for subjects on liraglutide compared to those on placebo. Estimated 
treatment difference was -0.28 [-0.47; -0.09] 95%CI, p-value=0.0062, favouring liraglutide. 
Mean body weight; Decreased (mean relative change -1.7%) from baseline to end of treatment in 
the liraglutide group compared to an increase (mean relative change 2.2%) in the placebo group. 
However, no statistically significant treatment difference was shown. 
Mean FPG; decreased numerically more from baseline to end of treatment with liraglutide treatment 
(mean change of -0.51 mmol/L) when compared to placebo (mean change of 0.12 mmol/L). 
No clinically relevant differences between the two groups were observed in fasting serum insulin or 
HbA1c. 
CHMP comments: 
As the MAH stated, comparing change from baseline to end of treatment, there was a statistically 
significant treatment difference in BMI z-score for subjects on liraglutide compared to those on 
placebo. Mean FPG decreased from baseline to end of treatment. A tendency in decrease in body 
weight was found, however not significant.  This might be associated to the imbalance of boys and 
girls in the placebo group at baseline, or the imbalance of weight at baseline between the liraglutide 
and placebo group. 
In the currently registered SmPC  the following is mentioned in section 4.1:  
Treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients 
EMA/201752/2018  
Page 22/25 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight. 
In this trial no subjects were treated beyond 8 weeks. The exposure to the maximum dose of 3.0 mg 
liraglutide in this trial was only one week. Long-term future research is needed to draw further 
conclusions of the efficacy and sustainability of Saxenda for weight and BMI z-score in children.   
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, the applicant concludes that the extent of the exposure (Ctrough) at 
steady-state with respect to liraglutide was consistent with dose proportionality. Further, as resulted 
from the population pharmacokinetic modelling, after adjusting for differences in body weight, 
exposure associated with 3.0 mg liraglutide was found to be comparable between the children studied 
in this clinical trial 7-11 years of age and what has been demonstrated in adolescent and adult 
subjects. A dose of 0.3 mg liraglutide was estimated to be an appropriate starting dose for younger 
children (26 kg) with obesity. This is based on extensive weight extrapolation, but could indeed be a 
good starting dose for ongoing or planned trials in the paediatric clinical development. 
In this trial in children aged 7 to 11 years, with a mean age of 9.9 years, a mean BMI z-score of 3.9 at 
Tanner stage 1, more TEAE were observed in the liraglutide treatment group. Nine subjects (56.3%) in 
the liraglutide group reported 37 TEAEs during the trial compared to 5 subjects (62.5%) in the placebo 
group reporting 12 TEAEs. The most common TEAE were mild gastrointestinal disorders mainly 
vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain. 
More subjects in the liraglutide group reported hypoglycaemic episodes compared to the placebo 
group; 5 hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in 4 subjects in the liraglutide treatment group 
compared to 1 episode in 1 subject in the placebo group). All of these hypoglycaemic episodes were 
classified as asymptomatic and the majority occurred after an overnight fast. 
The mean level of amylase increased during treatment in the liraglutide group compared to placebo. A 
total of 7 subjects in the liraglutide-treated group had lipase values above the reference range. No 
clinically relevant changes in amylase or lipase levels in the placebo group were observed. No 
liraglutide antibodies were observed. 
Regarding vital signs, resting pulse increased 7 beats per min for the liraglutide treated subjects 
compared to placebo (1 beats per min). This phenomenon is also observed in adults. 
At baseline a difference in mean body weight (kg) between treatment groups was observed. On 
average, mean weight in the liraglutide treatment group was 66.6 kg, lighter than the mean body 
weight (81.4 kg) of the placebo group. Body weight ranged from 45.0 to 86.8 kg in the liraglutide 
treatment group compared to 68.1 to 115.4 kg in the placebo treatment group. For the overall trial 
population, the mean BMI z-score was 3.9. The two groups were similar with regard to BMI z-score. 
The secondary exploratory PD endpoints tended to be in favour of liraglutide. A statistically significant 
treatment difference was shown for the BMI z-score. Mean body weight and mean fasting plasma 
glucose decreased, but no statistically significant treatment difference was shown. No clinically relevant 
differences between the two groups were observed in fasting serum insulin or HbA1c. However, the 
exposure to the maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide in this trial was only one week. As adverse events 
are the most profound after starting treatment, this period is acceptable to assess adverse events.  
Long-term future research is needed to draw further conclusions of the efficacy and sustainability of 
Saxenda for weight and BMI z-score in children.

Overall conclusion 
Trial NN8022-4181, assessing the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of liraglutide 
administered according to a dose-escalation schedule until a maximum dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide or 
maximum tolerated dose; for a period of 7 weeks (with option to prolong up to 13 weeks in case a flex 
week was needed) in obese children aged 7 to 11 years, did not reveal unexpected safety and 
tolerability issues. Exposure associated with 3.0 mg liraglutide was found to be comparable between 
the children aged 7 to 11 and adolescents and adult subjects, if corrected for body weight.  
Trial NN8022-4181 is part of the PIP (EMEA/H/C/003780) for Saxenda®, liraglutide 3 mg for weight 
management. The PIP comprises 7 studies (one quality study, one nonclinical study and 5 clinical 
trials) and is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Trial NN8022-4181 is the second of the 5 planned 
paediatric clinical trials to be completed. 
The results of the other paediatric clinical trials has to be waited for, to draw definite conclusions. In 
general, the side effects of Saxenda in children aged 7 to 11 years are in accordance with adults. No 
pronounced effect on hypoglycaemia was found. Long-term future research is needed to draw further 
conclusions of the efficacy and sustainability of Saxenda for weight and BMI z-score in children.

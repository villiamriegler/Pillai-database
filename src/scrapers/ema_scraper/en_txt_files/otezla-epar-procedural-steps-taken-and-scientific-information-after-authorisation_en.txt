maintained in the long-term open label extension studies 
for up to 5 years. The clinical responses were maintained in 
the same parameters of peripheral activity and in the skin 
manifestations of psoriasis in the open-label extension 
studies for up to 5 years of treatment. Improved physical 
function as assessed by the HAQ-DI  and the SF36v2PF 
domain, and the FACIT-fatigue scores were maintained in 
the open-label extension studies for up to 5 years of 
treatment. 
In psoriasis patients, improvements were generally 
maintained in PASI  score, affected BSA,  itch, nail and 
quality of life measures for up to 5 years.  
The long-term safety of apremilast 30 mg twice daily in 
patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis in open -label 
extension studies for a total duration of treatment up to 5 
years was generally comparable to the 52-week studies.

have been post-marketing reports of severe diarrhoea, 
nausea, and vomiting associated with the use of Otezla. 
Most events occurred within the first few weeks of 
treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. 
Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking 
medications that can lead to volume depletion or 
hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications. 
Patients who reduced dosage or discontinued Otezla 
generally improved quickly. If patients develop severe 
diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting, discontinuation of 
treatment with apremilast may be necessary

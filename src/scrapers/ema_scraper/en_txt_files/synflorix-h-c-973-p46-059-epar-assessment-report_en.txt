Introduction 
In July 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The MAH stated that the data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Synflorix. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The applicant states that the study DTPa-IPV-059 ‘A phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre 
study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’
combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2-4-6 
months of age in healthy infants in South Korea’ is a stand alone study.  
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
Synflorix is a 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine containing polysaccharides of 
8 pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14 and 23F conjugated individually to protein D, a 
highly conserved protein of non-typeable Haemophilus influenza, serotype 18C conjugated to tetanus 
toxoid and serotype 19F conjugated to diphtheria toxoid. The first license for Synflorix was obtained 
from the Canadian authorities in December 2008, followed by Australia and the EU in 2009. The 
current therapeutic indications in the Synflorix SmPC are active immunisation against invasive disease, 
pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 
weeks up to 5 years of age.  
As stated in the Synflorix SmPC, Synflorix can be given concomitantly with any of the following 
monovalent or combination vaccines (including DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib and DTPw-HBV/Hib): diphtheria-
tetnaus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), 
Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (Hib), diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTPw), 
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR), varicella vaccine (V), meningococcal serogroup C conjugate 
vaccine (CRM197 and TT conjugates), meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine 
(TT conjugate), oral polio vaccine (OPV) and oral rotavirus vaccine.  
The current submission pertains to fulfilling the requirements of Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation 
(EC) No 1901/2006 towards the Synflorix license. The study was not included in the agreed Synflorix 
paediatric investigation plan.

Description 
Methods 
Study design and objectives 
Assessor's comment: 
In this study, Synflorix was concomitantly administered with other vaccines. Only the results regarding 
Synflorix will be evaluated in the present P46 procedure report.  
Assessor's comment: 
It is noted that all participants received Synflorix in combination with other vaccines.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 451 infants (combo group=224; control group=227) were enrolled between 04 March 2011 
and 24 February 2012.

Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity:  
One month after the third dose of the primary vaccination, the non-inferiority of the DTPa-IPV/Hib 
vaccine (combo group) administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age to that of the concomitant 
administration of DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines (control group) in terms of seroprotection rates for 
antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3 and PRP 
antigens and GMCs of antibodies against PT, FHA and PRN antigens, was demonstrated. Therefore, the 
primary objective of the study was met. 
Assessor's comment: 
No immunogenicity results for Synflorix were generated in study DTPA-IPV-059. 
Safety/reactogenicity: 
A total of 57 SAEs were reported in 46 subjects (25 subjects in the combo group and 21 subjects in the 
control group). Among the SAEs, bronchiolitis, urinary tract infections and gastroenteritis were the 
most frequently reported SAEs in both the groups. All other SAEs also led to hospitalization and were 
resolved by the end of study. None of the SAEs were considered related to vaccination by the 
investigator. The administration of all study vaccines was considered safe and generally well tolerated.  
Assessor's comment: 
No SAEs considered related to vaccination were identified within the study.  
As there was no control group that did not receive Synflorix, it is difficult to draw specific conclusions 
of events possibly related to Synflorix vaccination. Moreover, such conclusions are even more difficult 
to perform as concomitant administration with other vaccines was done.  
The data appears to be in line with the approved SPC of Synflorix and no new safety concerns have 
been identified from study DTPA-IPV-059. 
1.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In the present study, Synflorix was concomitantly administered with other vaccines. No 
immunogenicity endpoints regarding Synflorix were included in the study, but SAEs were evaluated. A 
total of 451 infants were enrolled in the study. No new safety concerns were identified from the study 
and the results on Synflorix is in consistency with the approved SPC.  
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
This article 46 submission is considered satisfactory and no further regulatory action regarding 
Synflorix is required.

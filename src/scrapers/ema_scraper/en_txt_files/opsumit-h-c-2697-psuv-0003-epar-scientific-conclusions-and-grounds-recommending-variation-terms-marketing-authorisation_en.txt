Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Opsumit, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
A signal of hypersensitivity has been assessed during this PSUR for which a total of 45 serious cases from 
clinical trials and 57 cases from postmarketing sources (9 serious cases and 48 non-serious cases) were 
identified. From postmarketing data 8 cases and from clinical trials two cases supported a possible causal 
relationship.  Most of PTs reported are related to skin reactions (no cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis or 
Stevens- Johnson syndrome were reported).  Hypersensitivity reactions are a known class effect of 
endothelin receptor antagonists, and were reported in the post-marketing setting with other products of this 
class. 
Overall, the PRAC considers that in the light of all safety data provided, a possible causal relationship 
between macitentan and hypersensitivity reactions is supported and therefore hypersensitivity reactions 
should be included in the PI of macitentan. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding hypersensitivity, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Opsumit, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance 
of the medicinal product containing the active substance MACITENTAN is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

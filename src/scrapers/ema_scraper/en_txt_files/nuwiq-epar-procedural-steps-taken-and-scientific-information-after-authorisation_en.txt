on concerns resulting from the evaluation of data 
from pharmacovigilance activities. 
The PRAC was requested to assess the potential

impact of the results of the SIPPET study (which 
concluded that recombinant factor VIII medicines 
had a higher incidence of inhibitor development than 
plasma-derived medicines), and to issue a 
recommendation as to whether the marketing 
authorisations of these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.  The EMA 
concluded in September 2017 that there is no clear 
and consistent evidence of a difference in the 
incidence of inhibitor development between the two 
classes of factor VIII medicines: those derived from 
plasma and those made by recombinant DNA 
technology. Due to the different characteristics of 
individual products within the two classes, EMA 
concluded that the risk of inhibitor development 
should be evaluated individually for each medicine, 
regardless of class. The risk for each product will 
continue to be assessed as more evidence becomes 
available.

C.I.4: Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC to reflect available data from Previously 
Untreated Patients (PUP) from GENA-05 (interim 
report) study. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 8.0 has also been 
submitted. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update the Product 
Information throughout to bring it in line with the 
Core summary of product characteristics for human 
plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation factor 
VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1619/1999 rev. 2) 
and with the QRD version 10 (affects labelling only). 
Moreover the MAH is combining the SmPC for all 
strengths and updating Annex A with detailed 
information on the packaging.

order to align the content in a single harmonised 
Labelling and 
Preliminary data regarding efficacy and safety is considered 
PL 
to be in line with previously collected data in children but 
should be updated, accordingly, as soon as the final study 
report is available. Consequently, section 4.2 of the SmPC 
has been updated to remove the statement that safety and 
efficacy of Nuwiq in previously untreated patients (PUP) 
have not yet been established and additional information 
on treatment monitoring has been added. Section 4.8 has 
been updated to reflect the entity of ‘Hypersensitivity’. 
Section 5.1 has been updated with a statement that the 
PUP-study is ongoing. The MAH should provide an update of 
the SmPC with the Final Study Report.

SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR YESCARTA (AXICABTAGENE 
CILOLEUCEL) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel). 
The RMP details important risks of Yescarta, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Yescarta’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Yescarta’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Yescarta should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Yescarta should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Yescarta’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What is it Used for 
Yescarta is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) that relapses within 12 months from 
completion of, or is refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy. In addition, Yescarta is 
authorized for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal 
large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy; and adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after three or more lines of systemic 
therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains axicabtagene ciloleucel as the active 
substance and it is a single infusion product for autologous and intravenous use only. 
Further information about the evaluation of Yescarta’s benefits can be found in Yescarta’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=/pages/medicines/human/medicines/human_med_
002292.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124. 
II. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Yescarta, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Yescarta’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Yescarta, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed (e.g., via the periodic safety update report [PSUR]) so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Yescarta is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Yescarta are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Yescarta. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine);

axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Patients who had undergone a prior allogeneic haematopoietic stem-
cell transplant (allo-HSCT) and then received donor derived CAR T 
cells (from prior allo-HSCT donor) appear to be at an increased risk 
of developing aggravation of GvHD or GvHD.

Primary objective: 
To evaluate the incidence rate and severity of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) in patients treated with Yescarta, including 
secondary malignancies, CRS, neurologic events, serious 
infections, prolonged cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinaemia, 
and pregnancy outcomes in female patients of childbearing 
potential.  
Secondary objectives: 
To determine the overall survival rate and causes of death 
after administration of Yescarta. 
To determine the time to next treatment after administration 
of Yescarta. 
To determine the time to relapse or progression of primary 
disease after administration of Yescarta. 
To assess the safety and effectiveness profile by gender, age, 
and in special populations (patients with prior autologous 
stem cell transplant, high risk comorbidity index, patients 
treated with out-of-specification product), and additional 
subgroups may also be explored. 
To assess the risk of TLS and aggravation of GvHD, and the 
detection of RCR in samples of patients with secondary 
malignancies. 
Other exploratory objectives: 
To determine the occurrence of loss of target antigen and of 
functional CAR T persistence in patients relapsing after 
Yescarta therapy.

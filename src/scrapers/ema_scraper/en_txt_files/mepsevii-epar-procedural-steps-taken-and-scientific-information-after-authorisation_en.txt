SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Mepsevii in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

glycosaminoglycans (Dermatan Sulfate) were observed in 
patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis VII after treatment 
with vestronidase alfa of up to 3.6 years. Additional 
beneficial responses following long term treatment with 
vestronidase alfa was seen in some treated patients, 
including a sustained increase in the results of the 6-Minute 
Walk Test.

CL203, an open –label study of vestrodinase alfa 
patients less than 5 years of age received a dose of 4 
mg/kg vestronidase alfa every two weeks for 48 weeks of

optional continuation period. 
Treatment with vestronidase alfa resulted in a rapid and 
sustained, highly significant reduction in urinary 
glycosaminoglycans Dermatan Sulfate (uGAG DS) excretion 
with a mean percent change of -60%  at Week 4 which was 
sustained at Week 48. Subjects who entered the 
Continuation Period up to Week 132 experienced further 
reduction in uGAG DS. 
A positive trend toward increased growth velocity was 
observed after vestronidase alfa treatment. All 3 subjects 
with hepatomegaly assessed by ultrasound examination at 
Baseline had decreased liver size to within normal range for 
age and sex prior to study termination.

Introduction 
The MAH has in accordance with article 46 of the paediatric regulation 1901/2006 submitted the study  
“An  evaluation  of  the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  On-demand  Treatment  with  Xyntha  (B-Domain  Deleted 
Recombinant Factor VIII, Albumin Free) in Chinese Subjects with Hemophilia A (Study 3082B2-3316)” 
Summary of Study and Results 
This open-label trial included assessments of safety, clinical efficacy and Factor VIII (FVIII) recovery in 
Chinese subjects with hemophilia A.   
Methods 
Subjects received on-demand treatments with Xyntha over a 6-month period.  The subjects’ response 
to treatment of bleeding episodes with Xyntha was evaluated by the Investigator using a 4-point rating 
scale  (Excellent=1,  Good=2,  Moderate=3  and  No  response=4).    The  number  of  infusions  required  to 
resolve bleeding episodes were also collected.  FVIII recovery was assessed by determining the FVIII 
concentration (FVIII: C) levels in individual subjects.  Safety was assessed by the incidence of adverse 
events  (AEs)  and  the  incidence  of  FVIII  inhibitors.    Subjects  who  discontinued  Xyntha  therapy  for 
clinical reasons during the active phase of the study were followed for safety for the duration of their 
planned participation in the study (i.e. until the Follow-up call or visit, which occurred 30 days after the 
completion of the 6 months on-demand period).  
Subjects  aged  6  years  or  older,  with  1  or  more  prior  exposure  days  (ED)  to  FVIII  replacement 
products, who met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and were not currently utilizing 
FVIII  prophylaxis  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  trial.    A  post-hoc  analysis  of  the  data  from  the 
paediatric subjects enrolled in the study was performed. (i.e. 16 out of 51) 
Main inclusion criteria 
1. Subjects ≥6 years of age with mild, moderate or severe hemophilia A (FVIII activity: >5%, 1-5%, 
or <1%, respectively) 
2. Subjects with previous exposure to FVIII replacement therapy 
3. If HIV positive, documented CD4 count >200/μL within 6 months (calendar day) of study entry 
Main exclusion criterias 
1. Diagnosed with any bleeding disorder in addition to hemophilia A 
2.  Current  FVIII  inhibitor  or  history  of  FVIII  inhibitor  (defined  as  positive  result  of  the  reporting 
laboratory) 
3. Subject has no history of exposure to FVIII products (previously untreated patient [PUP]) 
4. Subject is currently utilizing primary FVIII prophylaxis 
5. Subjects anticipating elective surgery that may be planned to occur in the 6 months following study 
entry 
6. Treated with immunomodulatory therapy within 30 days prior to study entry or planned use for the 
duration of their study participation 
7.  Participated  in  another  investigational  drug  or  device  study  within  30  days  prior  to  study  entry  or 
planned participation for the duration of their study participation 
8. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to hamster protein

12. Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  describe  the  safety  and  clinical  efficacy  of  Xyntha  in 
previously treated Chinese subjects with haemophilia A. The secondary objective of this study was to 
describe  FVIII  recovery  after  exposure  to  Xyntha  in  previously  treated  Chinese  subjects  with 
haemophilia A. 
Blood  samples  were  collected  from  each  subject  (approximately  60  ml)  at  scheduled  visits.    The 
precise number of visits required varied from subject to subject and was determined by the frequency 
of bleeds requiring on-demand treatment.  
Overall  55  subjects  were  screened,  53  of  these  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  49 subjects 
completed the final evaluation.   
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  Investigator  Haemostatic  Efficacy  assessment  in  subjects  who 
received at least one dose of Xyntha.  All efficacy results were analyzed using both the full analysis set 
(FAS N=51) and per protocol set (PPS N=47) populations.   
Results 
A post-hoc analysis of the data from the paediatric subjects enrolled in the study was performed which 
is  presented  below.  The  paediatric  population  of  the  study  was  comprised  of  18  subjects  at  the 
screening  phase,  out  of  which  16  subjects  reached  the  on-demand/active  phase  and  14  subjects 
completed  the  final  recovery  phase.  The  prior  FVIII  product  ED  history  was  identified  for  subjects  as 
either > 100 EDs or ≤ 100 EDs with the majority of subjects having < 100 EDs, 12 and 10 respectively 
for subjects reaching the on-demand/active  and final recovery phases.   
The mean score of Haemostatic Efficacy assessment for pediatric population in FAS was 1.80±0.65 at 8 
hours and 1.74±0.59 at 24 hours post-infusion. In the PPS population the mean score of Haemostatic 
Efficacy  assessment  for  paediatric  population  was  1.72±0.60  at  8  hours  and  1.69±0.58  at  24  hours 
post-infusion.  All  assessments  of  Haemostatic  Efficacy  in  the  FAS  and  PPS  populations  at  8  and 
24 hours post-infusion were rated as good or excellent by the investigator.  
A comparison of the Haemostatic Efficacy assessment of all subjects and paediatric subjects is shown 
in Table 1. No difference was noted between the results of the Haemostatic Efficacy assessment in the 
paediatric study population subset and the combined adult and paediatric study population.

For  the  secondary  endpoint  FVIII  incremental  recovery  no  analysis  in  the  paediatric  subset  has  been 
presented. For the full population the following results are presented: 
FVIII recovery was assessed by evaluating FVIII:C after initial exposure and again following 6 months 
of repeated exposures to Xyntha. Incremental FVIII recovery values were calculated from the change 
before (pre) infusion at time 0 and at 30 min (5 minutes) after the start of infusion, and were analyzed 
by paired t-test. 
In the FAS population, the average  (  ±SD) recovery of FVIII activity at visits 2 and 4 are 1.77±0.50 
IU/dL  per  IU/kg  and  1.67±0.45  IU/dL  per  IU/kg,  respectively.  There  was  no  significant  difference 
between the 2 visits for the change of recovery (p>0.05). (Table 3) 
In  the  PPS  population,  the  average  (±  SD  recovery  of  FVIII  activity  at  visits  2  and  4  are  1.79±0.50 
IU/dL  per  IU/kg  and  1.66±0.45  IU/dL  per  IU/kg,  respectively.  There  was  no  significant  difference 
between the 2 visits for the change of recovery (p>0.05). (Table 3)

The  safety  variables  included  adverse  events  (AEs)  occurring  from  the  time  informed  consent  was 
obtained until 30 days after the completion of 6 months on-demand period.  Overall, during this study, 
there  were  19 subjects  with  31  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs);  10  of  these  TEAEs 
occurred  in  8  subjects  and  were  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  Principal  Investigator.  
Nine  (9)  subjects  reported  11  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs);  8 of  these  SAEs  occurred  in  7 subjects 
and were considered related to the study drug by the Principal Investigator.  
 In  the  paediatric  subset  there  were  14  AEs  and  1  SAE  reported.  The  SAE  was  a  FVIII  inhibitor  that 
occurred  during  the  screening  period  of  the  study.  This  subject  did  not  receive  Xyntha  was  and  thus 
the SAE was considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator and he was excluded from study 
participation.  Two  (2)  out  of  the  14  AEs,  2  occurrences  of  hypersensitivity in  the  same  subject,  were 
considered  related  to  the  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  These  events  were  considered  mild  by  the 
investigator  and  required  no  treatment.    Eight  (8)  of  the  AEs  in  the  paediatric  subjects  were  mild,  4 
were  moderate  and  2  were  considered  severe.    Both  severe  AEs,  injury  and  FVIII  inhibitor  (during 
screening and described above) were considered unrelated by the investigator.  
The incidence of FVIII inhibitor, was defined as any result determined as positive at a local laboratory 
(if  done),  and  confirmed  by  testing  of  a  concurrent  aliquot  at  a  central  laboratory.    There  were  no 
treatment-emergent  events  of  FVIII  inhibitor  development  in  the  paediatric  population  of  this  study. 
One  subject  had  a  positive  FVIII  inhibitor  result  that  was  detected  during  the  screening  period.  This 
subject  did  not  receive  Xyntha  and  was  excluded  from  participation  in  the  study.    No  events  of 
thrombosis or Less than Expected Therapeutic Effect (LETE) were reported. 
Overall,  the  results  of  the  safety  data  from  the  paediatric  subset  in  study  3082B2-3316  were 
consistent with the known safety profile for Xyntha. 
Conclusions of the MAH 
This  study  showed  that  the  safety  and  efficacy  of Xyntha  in  the  paediatric population  was  acceptable 
and  similar  to  the  results  of  the  overall  study  analysis  and  consistent  with  the  information  in  the 
product labeling for Xyntha. There were no reports of LETE in paediatric subjects in this study. There 
were no treatment emergent FVIII inhibitors reported.   No new safety findings were observed in this 
study.  
Conclusion of the Rapporteur 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  results  from  an  open  label  study  in  Chinese  subjects  >  6  years  of  age 
assessing safety, clinical efficacy, and FVIII recovery in Chinese subjects with haemophilia A. Subjects 
received  on-demand  treatments  with  Refacto  Xyntha  (i.e.  the  Refacto  version  approved  also  in  US) 
over a 6-month period. The post hoc analysis performed in the paediatric part of the included subjects 
(16 out of 51) showed that the results seen in this Asian population is in line with what has formed the 
basis of the approval of Refacto AF in EU; study 310, which did not include Asian subjects.

The  current  approved  SmPC  in  EU  already  reflects  the  data  seen  from  the  310  study.  The  overall 
conclusion of the MAH is endorsed. None of the data submitted have implications for the overall benefit 
risk of the product.

On 10 June 1996 the company Orion Corporation submitted to the EMEA an application for the 
modification  of  the  package  leaflet  to  include  the  list  of  contact  points  of  the  Marketing 
Authorisation Holder in the fifteen Member States. On 13 August 1996 the EMEA notified the 
European Commission, who amended the Commission Decision on 14 August 1996. 
On  21  March  1996  the  company  Orion  Corporation  (Finland)  submitted  to  the  EMEA  an 
application  for  a  transfer  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  from  Ercopharm  a/s  (Denmark).  The 
EMEA  notified  the  European  Commission,  who  amended  the  Commission  Decision  on  2 
October 1996.  
Following  review  of  the  third  Periodic  Safety  Update  by  the  CPMP,  the  company  Orion 
Corporation submitted an application for a Type II variation on 15 September 1997. The scope 
of  the  variation  was  to  update  the  SPC;  in  particular  with  regard  to  thrombo-embolic  events, 
elevation of transaminases and the addition of a sentence relating to effects on cholesterol and 
LDL.  The  CPMP,  during  its  November  1997  plenary  meeting,  considered  the  changes 
acceptable and issued on 19 November 1997 a positive Opinion on the Type II variation. This 
Opinion  was  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the  European 
Commission who adopted the corresponding Decision on 11 March 1998.

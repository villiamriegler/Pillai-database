PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR IMRALDI 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Imraldi®. The RMP details important risks 
of Imraldi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Imraldi’s 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Imraldi’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Imraldi should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Imraldi should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Imraldi’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Imraldi  is  authorised  for  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA), 
enthesitis-related  arthritis,  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  axial  spondyloarthritis  without  radiographic 
evidence of AS (nr-axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (PsO), paediatric plaque PsO, hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS), Crohn’s disease (CD), paediatric CD, ulcerative colitis (UC), paediatric UC, uveitis 
and paediatric uveitis (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains adalimumab as the active substance 
and it is given by subcutaneous injection.  
Further information about the evaluation of Imraldi’s benefits can be found in Imraldi’s EPAR, including 
in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imraldi 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of Imraldi, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Imraldi’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Imraldi, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed, including  PSUR  assessment so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken as  necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Imraldi is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Imraldi are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Imraldi. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Study SB5-G31-RA; Imraldi SmPC, Section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and p
recautions for use’; and referenced scientific publications 
Lymphoma 
There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and leukaemia in 
RA patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease.  
Malignancies 
Studies have shown that patients with RA have an approximately 2-fold 
increased risk of lymphoma and leukaemia. The increase in lymphoma 
risk is limited to those RA patients who have long standing and very 
severe disease.  
In a prospective study designed to determine the rate of lymphoma 
among patients with RA, those who developed lymphoma (irrespective 
of treatment) were significantly older, had more comorbidities, were 
more likely to be male, had more education, and were more likely to be 
non-Hispanic whites compared with those that did not develop 
lymphoma.  
Factors that increase the risk of HL include age (from 15 to 30 years as 
well as older than 55 years), a family history of lymphoma, being a 
male, previous Epstein-Barr virus infection, and a weakened immune 
system (such as from HIV/AIDS or certain medications after organ 
transplant).   
Factors that may increase the risk of NHL include medications that 
suppress the immune system, infections with certain viruses and bacteria 
(such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, ulcer-causing Helicobacter pylori), 
and older age (60 years or older)  
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) 
Some of these HSTCLs with adalimumab have occurred in young adult 
patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine (AZA) or 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP) used for IBD. The potential risk with the 
combination of AZA or 6-MP and adalimumab should be carefully 
considered. 
Additionally, thiopurine therapy in patients with IBD, combined 
immunosuppression, age groups from 10 to 35 years, and the male sex 
are considered to be risk factors of HSTCL.  
Leukaemia 
Patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, and 
those with a history of malignancy are at an increased risk of developing 
leukaemia after treatment with a TNF-antagonist. Caution should also 
be exercised in considering treatment of patients with increased risk for 
malignancy due to heavy smoking or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. 
Factors with an increased risk of leukaemia include previous 
chemotherapy and radiation therapy, certain genetic disorders (such as 
Down syndrome), exposure to certain chemicals (such as benzene), 
smoking, and a family history of leukaemia. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 
Risk factors of skin cancer include radiation (sunlight or radiation 
therapy), personal or family history of melanoma, fair skin (having less 
melanin), certain medical conditions that suppress the immune system, 
certain medicines (such as some antibiotics, hormones, or 
antidepressants), and exposure to arsenic at work. In addition, actinic 
keratosis and HPV infection are also risk factors of skin cancer.  
Melanoma 
Malignancies 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Among patients considered for TNF-therapy, patients with a history of 
malignancy, or patients who develop a malignancy during treatment and 
considering continuation of the treatment. Patients with PsO and a 
medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or prolonged 
PUVA treatment. .
Factors that may increase the risk of melanoma include fair skin (having 
less melanin), a history of sunburn, a family history of melanoma, 
excessive ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, many common moles, and a 
weakened immune system (such as those who have undergone organ 
transplant). 
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) 
Factors such as advanced age, immunosuppression (such as organ 
transplants and HIV), other cancers, and UV light exposure may 
increase the risk of developing Merkel cell carcinoma.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Study SB5-G31-RA; Imraldi SmPC, Section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effects’ 
and Section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and precautions for use’; referenced 
scientific publications. 
Patients with pre-existing multiple sclerosis (MS) or Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (GBS) belong to the high-risk group. Additionally, first-
degree relatives of patients with MS have an increased propensity for 
developing MS, with a sibling relative risk ranging between 18 and 36. 
Factors of increased risk of MS include genetic associations (e.g., HLA-
DR2 [HLA-DRB1*15]), ethnic origin (e.g., African American men have 
lower risk than white men), women, Epstein-Barr virus infection, 
smoking, and latitude/vitamin D. 
Factors of increased risk of GBS include men, increased age, viral or 
bacterial infection (particularly Campylobacter jejuni infection), and 
certain vaccines.

II.B.2 Important potential risk
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Referenced scientific publications 
Immunosuppressive conditions such as HIV/AIDS are the main risk 
factors of PML. A study conducted by Eng et al. analysed that 
approximately 41% of the patients with PML were found in the 40 to 49 
years age group and the PML patients were predominantly male with a 
75% estimate. 
HIV infection is the basis of approximately 85% of all PML cases. 
Before the HIV epidemic, more than 60% of PML cases were found in 
patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Other conditions that are 
risk factors of PML are hematologic malignancies, organ transplants, 
and chronic inflammatory diseases.

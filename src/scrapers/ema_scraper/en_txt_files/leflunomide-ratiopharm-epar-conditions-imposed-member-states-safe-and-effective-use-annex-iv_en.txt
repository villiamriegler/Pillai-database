 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the member states 
The Member States shall ensure that the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) provides physicians 
who are expected to prescribe/use Leflunomide ratiopharm with a physician educational pack 
containing the following: 
  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
  Physician Leaflet 
The Physician Leaflet should contain the following key messages: 
  That there is a risk of severe liver injury and so regular measurement of ALT (SGPT) levels 
to 
monitor liver function is important. The information provided in the Physician Leaflet should 
provide information on dose reduction, discontinuation and wash out procedures in the event 
of raised ALT. 
  The identified risk of synergistic hepato- or haematotoxicity associated with combination 
therapy with another Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug (e.g. methotrexate) 
  That there is a risk of teratogenicity and so pregnancy must be avoided until leflunomide 
plasma levels are at an appropriate level. Physicians and patients should be made aware that 
there is an ad hoc advisory service available to provide information on leflunomide plasma 
level laboratory testing 
  The risk of infections, including opportunistic infections, and the contraindication for use in 
immuno-compromised patients. 
  The need to counsel patients on important risks associated with leflunomide therapy and 
appropriate precautions when using the medicine.

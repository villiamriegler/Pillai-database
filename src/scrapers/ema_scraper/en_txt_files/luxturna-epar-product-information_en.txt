NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Luxturna 5 × 1012 vector genomes/mL concentrate and solvent for solution for injection 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
2.1  General description 
Voretigene neparvovec is a gene transfer vector that employs an adeno-associated viral vector 
serotype 2 (AAV2) capsid as a delivery vehicle for the human retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa 
protein (hRPE65) cDNA to the retina. Voretigene neparvovec is derived from wild-type AAV2 using 
recombinant DNA techniques. 
2.2  Qualitative and quantitative composition 
Each mL of concentrate contains 5 × 1012 vector genomes (vg). 
Each vial of Luxturna contains 0.5 extractable mL of concentrate (corresponding to 2.5 × 1012 vector 
genomes) which requires a 1:10 dilution prior to administration, see section 6.6. 
After dilution of 0.3 mL of concentrate with 2.7 mL of solvent, each mL contains 5 × 1011 vector 
genomes. Each dose of 0.3 mL Luxturna contains 1.5 x 1011 vector genomes. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and administered by a retinal surgeon experienced in performing 
macular surgery. 
Posology 
Patients will receive a single dose of 1.5 × 1011 vector genomes voretigene neparvovec in each eye. 
Each dose will be delivered into the subretinal space in a total volume of 0.3 mL. The individual 
administration procedure to each eye is performed on separate days within a close interval, but no 
fewer than 6 days apart. 
Immunomodulatory regimen 
Prior to initiation of the immunomodulatory regimen and prior to administration of voretigene 
neparvovec, the patient must be checked for symptoms of active infectious disease of any nature, and 
in case of such infection the start of treatment must be postponed until after the patient has recovered. 
Starting 3 days prior to the administration of voretigene neparvovec to the first eye, it is recommended 
that an immunomodulatory regimen is initiated following the schedule below (Table 1). Initiation of 
the immunomodulatory regimen for the second eye should follow the same schedule and supersede 
completion of the immunomodulatory regimen of the first eye.

Method of administration 
Subretinal use. 
Luxturna is a sterile concentrate solution for subretinal injection that requires thawing and dilution 
prior to administration (see section 6.6). 
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravitreal injection. 
Luxturna is a single-use vial for a single administration in one eye only. The product is administered 
as a subretinal injection after vitrectomy in each eye. It should not be administered in the immediate 
vicinity of the fovea to maintain foveal integrity (see section 4.4). 
The administration of voretigene neparvovec should be carried out in the surgical suite under 
controlled aseptic conditions. Adequate anaesthesia should be given to the patient prior to the 
procedure. The pupil of the eye to be injected must be dilated and a broad-spectrum microbicide 
should be topically administered prior to the surgery according to standard medical practice. 
For instructions for preparation, accidental exposure to and disposal of Luxturna, see section 6.6. 
Administration 
Follow the steps below to administer voretigene neparvovec to patients: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Diluted Luxturna should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, 
cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the medicinal product must not be used. 
Connect the syringe containing the diluted product to the extension tube and subretinal injection 
cannula. The product is slowly injected through the extension tube and subretinal injection 
cannula to eliminate any air bubbles in the system. 
The volume of product available for injection is confirmed in the syringe, by aligning the 
plunger tip with the line that marks 0.3 mL. 
After vitrectomy is completed, Luxturna is administered by subretinal injection using a 
subretinal injection cannula introduced via pars plana (Figure 1A). 
Under direct visualisation, the tip of the subretinal injection cannula is placed in contact with 
the retinal surface. The recommended site of injection should be located along the superior 
vascular arcade, at least 2 mm distal to the centre of the fovea (Figure 1B). A small amount of 
the product is slowly injected until an initial subretinal bleb is observed, and then the remaining 
volume is slowly injected until the total 0.3 mL is delivered.

injection (surgeon’s view) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
At the completion of the injection, the subretinal injection cannula is removed from the eye. 
After injection, any unused product must be discarded. The back-up syringe may not be 
retained. 
Fluid-air exchange is performed, carefully avoiding fluid drainage near the retinotomy created 
for the subretinal injection. 
Supine head positioning is initiated immediately in the post-operative period and upon 
discharge should be maintained by the patient for 24 hours. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Ocular or periocular infection. 
Active intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Subretinal injection-related reactions 
Proper aseptic techniques should always be used for the preparation and administration of Luxturna. 
• 
• 
The following adverse reactions have been observed with the administration procedure: 
• 
Eye inflammation (including endophthalmitis), retinal tear and retinal detachment. Patients 
should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal 
detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. 
Retinal disorder (foveal thinning, loss of foveal function), macular hole, maculopathy (epiretinal 
membrane, macular pucker) and eye disorder (foveal dehiscence). 
Increase in intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure should be monitored prior to and following 
administration of the medicinal product and managed appropriately. Patients should be 
instructed to avoid air travel or other travel to high elevations until the air bubble formed as a 
result of administration of Luxturna has completely dissipated from the eye. A time period of up 
to one week or more following injection may be required before dissipation of the air bubble; 
this should be verified on ophthalmic examination. A rapid increase in altitude while the air 
bubble is still present can cause a rise in eye pressure and irreversible vision loss. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Temporary visual disturbances, such as blurred vision and photophobia (see section 4.8), may occur 
during the weeks that follow the treatment. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare 
professional if visual disturbances persist. Patients should avoid swimming because of an increased 
risk of infection in the eye. Patients should avoid strenuous physical activity because of an increased 
risk of injury to the eye. Patients may resume swimming and strenuous activity, after a minimum of 
one to two weeks, on the advice of their healthcare professional. 
Shedding 
Transient and low-level vector shedding may occur in patient tears (see section 5.2). 
Patients/caregivers should be advised to handle waste material generated from dressings, tears and 
nasal secretion appropriately, which may include storage of waste material in sealed bags prior to 
disposal. These handling precautions should be followed for 14 days after administration of voretigene 
neparvovec. It is recommended that patients/caregivers wear gloves for dressing changes and waste 
disposal, especially in case of underlying pregnancy, breast-feeding and immunodeficiency of 
caregivers. 
Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation 
Patients treated with Luxturna should not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation. 
Immunogenicity 
To reduce the potential for immunogenicity patients should receive systemic corticosteroids before 
and after the subretinal injection of voretigene neparvovec to each eye (see section 4.2). The 
corticosteroids may decrease the potential immune reaction to either vector capsid (adeno-associated 
virus serotype 2 [AAV2] vector) or transgene product (retinal pigment epithelial 65 kDa protein 
[RPE65]). 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
There are no known clinically significant interactions. No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Based on non-clinical studies and clinical data from trials of AAV2 vectors, and considering the 
subretinal route of administration of Luxturna, inadvertent germ-line transmission with AAV vectors 
is highly unlikely. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of voretigene 
neparvovec in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Luxturna during pregnancy. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Luxturna has not been studied in breast-feeding women. It is unknown whether voretigene neparvovec 
is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be 
made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from voretigene neparvovec 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
No clinical data on the effect of the medicinal product on fertility are available. Effects on male and 
female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Voretigene neparvovec has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients may 
experience temporary visual disturbances after receiving subretinal injection of Luxturna. Patients 
should not drive or use heavy machines until visual function has recovered sufficiently, as advised by 
their ophthalmologist. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the phase 1 and phase 3 clinical studies, there were three non-serious adverse reactions of retinal 
deposits in three of 41 (7%) subjects that were considered to be related to voretigene neparvovec. All 
three of these events were a transient appearance of asymptomatic subretinal precipitates inferior to 
the retinal injection site, 1-6 days after injection and resolved without sequelae. 
Serious adverse reactions related to the administration procedure were reported in three subjects. One 
of 41 (2%) subjects reported a serious event of intraocular pressure increased (secondary to 
administration of depo-steroid) that was associated with treatment for endophthalmitis related to the 
administration procedure and resulted in optic atrophy, and one of 41 (2%) subjects reported a serious 
event of retinal disorder (loss of foveal function) that was assessed as related to the administration 
procedure. One of 41 (2%) subjects reported a serious event of retinal detachment that was assessed as 
related to the administration procedure. 
The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) related to the administration procedure were 
conjunctival hyperaemia, cataract, increased intraocular pressure, retinal tear, dellen, macular hole, 
subretinal deposits, eye inflammation, eye irritation, eye pain and maculopathy (wrinkling on the 
surface of the macula).

Description of select adverse reactions 
Chorioretinal atrophy 
Chorioretinal atrophy was reported as progressive in some patients. Events were temporally related to 
treatment and occurred in the estimated treated area of the bleb site and outside of the bleb area. 
Isolated cases of retinal atrophy extending to the fovea with visual impairment were reported. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no clinical experience with overdose of voretigene neparvovec. Symptomatic and supportive 
treatment, as deemed necessary by the treating physician, is advised in case of overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, other ophthalmologicals, ATC code: S01XA27. 
Mechanism of action 
The retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65 kilodalton protein (RPE65) is located in the retinal pigment 
epithelial cells and converts all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol, which subsequently forms the 
chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, during the visual (retinoid) cycle. These steps are critical in the biological 
conversion of a photon of light into an electrical signal within the retina. Mutations in the RPE65 gene 
lead to reduced or absent RPE65 all-trans-retinyl isomerase activity, blocking the visual cycle and 
resulting in vision loss. Over time, accumulation of toxic precursors leads to the death of retinal 
pigment epithelial cells, and subsequently to progressive photoreceptor cell death. Individuals with 
biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy exhibit vision loss, including impaired visual 
function parameters such as visual acuity and visual fields often during childhood or adolescence; this 
loss of vision ultimately progresses to complete blindness. 
Injection of voretigene neparvovec into the subretinal space results in transduction of retinal pigment 
epithelial cells with a cDNA encoding normal human RPE65 protein (gene augmentation therapy), 
providing the potential to restore the visual cycle. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The long-term safety and efficacy of Luxturna were assessed in a phase 1 safety and dose escalation 
study (101), in which 12 subjects received unilateral subretinal injections of voretigene neparvovec; a 
follow-on study (102) in which voretigene neparvovec was administered to the contralateral eye in 11 
of the 12 subjects who participated in the dose escalation study; a one-year, open-label phase 3 
controlled study (301) in which 31 subjects were randomised at two sites; and the continuation of the 
phase 3 study, in which the 9 control subjects crossed over and received the intervention. A total of 
41 subjects (81 eyes injected [one phase 1 subject did not meet eligibility criteria for a second 
injection]) participated in the clinical programme. All participants had a clinical diagnosis of Leber 
congenital amaurosis, and some may have also had prior or additional clinical diagnoses, including 
retinitis pigmentosa. Confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and the presence of sufficient viable retinal 
cells (an area of retina within the posterior pole of >100 micron thickness, as estimated by optical 
coherence tomography [OCT]) were established for all participants. 
Phase 3 study 
Study 301 was an open-label, randomised, controlled study. 31 subjects were enrolled, 13 males and 
18 females. The average age was 15 years (range 4 to 44 years), including 64% paediatric subjects 
(n=20, age from 4 to 17 years) and 36% adults (n=11). All subjects had a diagnosis of Leber’s 
congenital amaurosis owing to RPE65 mutations confirmed by genetic analysis in a certified 
laboratory. 
21 subjects were randomised to receive subretinal injection of voretigene neparvovec. Visual acuity 
(LogMAR) of the first eye of these subjects at baseline was 1.18 (0.14), mean (SE). One subject 
discontinued from the study prior to treatment. 10 subjects were randomised to the control 
(non-intervention) group. Visual acuity (LogMAR) of the first eye of these subjects at baseline was 
1.29 (0.21), mean (SE). One subject in the control group withdrew consent and was discontinued from 
the study. The nine subjects who were randomised to the control group were crossed over to receive 
subretinal injection of voretigene neparvovec after one year of observation. Each eye was administered 
a single subretinal injection of 1.5 × 1011 vector genomes voretigene neparvovec in a total volume of 
300 μL. The interval between injection to the eyes for each subject was from 6 to 18 days.

The primary endpoint of the phase 3 study measured the mean change from baseline to one year in 
binocular multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT) between the intervention and control groups. The 
MLMT was designed to measure changes in functional vision, specifically the ability of a subject to 
navigate a course accurately and at a reasonable pace at different levels of environmental illumination. 
This ability depends on the subject’s visual acuity, visual field and the extent of nyctalopia (decreased 
ability to perceive and/or see in dim light), each of which are functions specifically affected by the 
retinal disease associated with RPE65 mutations. In the phase 3 study, the MLMT used seven levels of 
illumination ranging from 400 lux to 1 lux (corresponding to, for example, a brightly lit office down to 
a moonless summer night). The testing of each subject was videotaped and assessed by independent 
graders. A positive change score reflects passing the MLMT at a lower light level and a lux score of 6 
reflects the maximum possible MLMT improvement. Three secondary endpoints were also tested: 
full-field light sensitivity threshold (FST) testing using white light; the change in MLMT score for the 
first assigned eye; and visual acuity (VA) testing. 
At baseline, subjects achieved pass marks on the mobility test at between 4 and 400 ambient lux.

The monocular MLMT change score significantly improved in the treatment group and was similar to 
the binocular MLMT results (see Table 4). 
Figure 2 shows the effect of the medicinal product over the three-year period in the voretigene 
neparvovec treatment group, as well as the effect in the control group after crossing over to receive 
subretinal injection of voretigene neparvovec. Significant differences in binocular MLMT 
performance were observed for the voretigene neparvovec treatment group at day 30 and were 
maintained over the remaining follow-up visits throughout the three-year period, compared to no 
change in the control group. However, after crossing-over to receive subretinal injection of voretigene 
neparvovec, the subjects in the control group showed a similar response to the voretigene neparvovec 
as compared to the subjects in the voretigene neparvovec treatment group.

Improvement in full-field light sensitivity was maintained for up to 3 years after exposure to 
voretigene neparvovec. 
At one year after exposure to voretigene neparvovec, improvement in visual acuity of at least 
0.3 LogMAR occurred in 11/20 (55%) of the first-treated eyes and 4/20 (20%) of the second-treated 
eyes in the intervention group; no one in the control group displayed such an improvement of visual 
acuity in either the first or second eye. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Voretigene neparvovec is expected to be taken up by cells through heparin sulphate proteoglycan 
receptors and be degraded by endogenous proteins and DNA catabolic pathways. 
Non-clinical biodistribution 
Biodistribution of voretigene neparvovec was evaluated at three months following subretinal 
administration in non-human primates. The highest levels of vector DNA sequences were detected in 
intraocular fluids (anterior chamber fluid and vitreous) of vector-injected eyes. Low levels of vector 
DNA sequences were detected in the optic nerve of the vector-injected eye, optic chiasm, spleen and 
liver, and sporadically in the stomach and lymph nodes. In one animal administered with voretigene 
neparvovec at 7.5 × 1011 vector genomes (5 times the recommended per eye dose), vector DNA 
sequences were detected in colon, duodenum and trachea. Vector DNA sequences were not detected in 
gonads.

Clinical pharmacokinetics and shedding 
The vector shedding and biodistribution were evaluated in tears from both eyes, serum and whole 
blood of subjects in the phase 3 clinical study. In 13/29 (45%) subjects receiving bilateral 
administrations, voretigene neparvovec vector DNA sequences were detected in tear samples; most of 
these subjects were negative after the day 1 post-injection visit, however, four of these subjects had 
positive tear samples beyond the first day, one subject up to day 14 post-second eye injection. Vector 
DNA sequences were detected in serum in 3/29 (10%) subjects, including two with positive tear 
samples, and only up to day 3 following each injection. Overall, transient and low levels of vector 
DNA were detected in tear and occasional serum samples from 14/29 (48%) of subjects in the phase 3 
study. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
No pharmacokinetic studies with voretigene neparvovec have been conducted in special populations. 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Luxturna is injected directly into the eye. Liver and kidney function, cytochrome P450 polymorphisms 
and ageing are not expected to influence the clinical efficacy or safety of the product. Therefore, no 
adjustment in dose is necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Ocular histopathology of dog and non-human primate eyes exposed to voretigene neparvovec showed 
only mild changes, which were mostly related to healing from surgical injury. In an earlier toxicology 
study, a similar AAV2 vector administered subretinally in dogs at a dose of 10 times the 
recommended dose resulted in focal retinal toxicity and inflammatory cell infiltrates histologically in 
regions exposed to the vector. Other findings from voretigene neparvovec non-clinical studies 
included occasional and isolated inflammatory cells in the retina, with no apparent retinal 
degeneration. Following a single vector administration, dogs developed antibodies to the AAV2 vector 
capsid which were absent in naïve non-human primates.

Thaw one single-dose vial of concentrate and two vials of solvent at room temperature. Once all 
3 vials (1 vial of concentrate and 2 vials of diluent) are thawed, dilution should be initiated. Gently 
invert the vials five times to mix the contents. 
Inspect for any visual particulates or any anomalies. Any anomalies or appearance of visual 
particulates should be reported to the Marketing Authorisation Holder and product should not be used. 
Transfer 2.7 mL of solvent taken from the two thawed vials and dispense into a sterile 10 mL empty 
glass vial using a 3 mL syringe. 
For dilution, draw 0.3 mL of thawed concentrate into a 1 mL syringe and add it to the 10 mL sterile 
vial containing the solvent. Gently invert the vial at least five times for proper mixing. Inspect for any 
visual particulates. The diluted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent. Label the 10 mL glass 
vial containing the diluted concentrate as follows: ‘Diluted Luxturna’. 
Do not prepare syringes if the vial shows any damage or if any visual particulates are observed. 
Prepare the syringes for injection by drawing 0.8 mL of the diluted solution into a sterile 1 mL 
syringe. Repeat the same procedure to prepare a backup syringe. The product-filled syringes should 
then be transferred in a designated transport container to the surgical suite.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Luxturna is and what it is used for 
Luxturna is a gene therapy product that contains the active substance voretigene neparvovec. 
Luxturna is used for the treatment of adults and children with vision loss due to inherited retinal 
dystrophy caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. These mutations prevent the body from producing 
a protein needed for vision and so lead to loss of sight and eventual blindness. 
The active substance in Luxturna, voretigene neparvovec, is a modified virus that contains a working 
copy of the RPE65 gene. After injection it delivers this gene into the cells of the retina, the layer at the 
back of the eye that detects light. This enables the retina to produce the proteins needed for vision. The 
virus used to deliver the gene does not cause disease in humans. 
Luxturna will be given to you only if genetic testing shows that your vision loss is caused by 
mutations in the RPE65 gene.

2.  What you need to know before you are given Luxturna 
You will not be given Luxturna 
- 
if you are allergic to voretigene neparvovec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6) 
if you have an eye infection 
if you have eye inflammation 
If any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure of any of the above, please talk to your doctor 
before you receive Luxturna. 
Warnings and precautions 
Before receiving treatment with Luxturna: 
• 
Tell your doctor if you have signs of an eye infection or eye inflammation, for example if you 
have eye redness, sensitivity to light, eye swelling or eye pain. 
Tell your doctor if you have an active infection of any sort. Your doctor may delay your 
treatment until your infection is gone because this medicine may make it more difficult for you 
to fight an infection. See also section 3. 
After receiving Luxturna: 
• 
Get immediate care from your doctor if your eye or eyes become red, painful, sensitive to light, 
you see flashes or floaters in your vision, or if you notice any worsening or blurred vision. 
You should avoid air travel or other travel to high elevations until advised by your doctor. 
During treatment with this medicine, the doctor inserts an air bubble in the eye, which is slowly 
absorbed by your body. Until the bubble is fully absorbed, air travel or other travel to high 
elevations may make the bubble expand and lead to eye damage, including vision loss. Please 
talk to your doctor before travelling. 
You should avoid swimming because of an increased risk of infection in the eye. Please talk to 
your doctor before going to swim after receiving treatment with Luxturna. 
You should avoid strenuous physical activity because of an increased risk of injury to the eye. 
Please talk to your doctor before beginning to engage in strenuous physical activity after 
receiving Luxturna. 
You may have temporary visual disturbances, such as light sensitivity, and blurred vision. Tell 
your doctor about any visual disturbances that you experience. Your doctor may be able to help 
reduce any discomfort caused by these temporary disturbances. 
The active substance in Luxturna may temporarily be excreted through your tears. You and your 
caregiver should place any used dressings and waste material with tears and nasal secretions in 
sealed bags before disposing of them. You should follow these precautions for 14 days. 
You might not be able to donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation after you 
have been treated with Luxturna. 
Children and adolescents 
Luxturna has not been studied in children below 4 years of age. Data are limited. 
Other medicines and Luxturna 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or nurse for advice before being treated with Luxturna. 
The effects of this medicine on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. As a precaution, you 
should not receive Luxturna while you are pregnant. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Luxturna has not been studied in breast-feeding women. It is not known whether it passes into breast 
milk. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help you decide 
whether to stop breast-feeding or to not receive Luxturna, taking into account the benefit of breast-
feeding for your baby and the benefit of Luxturna for you. 
Driving and using machines 
You may have temporary visual disturbances after receiving Luxturna. Do not drive or use heavy 
machines until your vision has recovered. Talk to your doctor before resuming these activities. 
Luxturna contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How Luxturna is given to you 
Luxturna will be given to you in an operating room by surgeons experienced in performing eye 
surgery. 
Luxturna is given under anaesthesia. Your doctor will talk to you about the anaesthesia and how it will 
be given to you. 
Your doctor will carry out eye surgery to remove the clear gel inside the eye, and then inject Luxturna 
directly under your retina, the thin light-sensing layer at the back of that eye. This will be repeated on 
your other eye at least 6 days afterwards. You will need to stay for post-operative observation for a 
few hours after each procedure to monitor your recovery and watch for any side effects from the 
surgery or the anaesthesia. 
Before Luxturna treatment is started your doctor may ask you to take a medicine that will suppress 
your immune system (the body’s natural defences) so that it will not try to fight the Luxturna when it 
is given. It is important that you take this medicine according to the instructions given. Do not stop 
taking the medicine without first talking to your doctor. 
If you are given more Luxturna than you should be 
As this medicine is given to you by a doctor, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If it does 
occur, your doctor will treat the symptoms as necessary. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any 
visual problems. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
This medicinal product contains genetically modified organisms. Personal protective equipment (to 
include laboratory coat, safety glasses and gloves) should be worn while handling or administering 
voretigene neparvovec. 
Intraocular pressure should be monitored prior to and following administration of the medicinal 
product and managed appropriately. 
Following the administration, patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. 
Preparation prior to administration 
Each pack contains 1 vial of concentrate and 2 vials of solvent for single use only. 
Luxturna should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or 
discoloration are visible, the single-dose vial must not be used. 
Preparation of Luxturna should be performed within 4 hours of beginning the administration 
procedure, in accordance with the following recommended procedure performed under aseptic 
conditions. 
Thaw one single-dose vial of concentrate and two vials of solvent at room temperature. Once all 
3 vials (1 vial of concentrate and 2 vials of diluent) are thawed, dilution should be initiated. Gently 
invert the vials five times to mix the contents. 
Inspect for any visual particulates or any anomalies. Any anomalies or appearance of visual 
particulates should be reported to the Marketing Authorisation Holder and product should not be used. 
Transfer 2.7 mL of solvent taken from the two thawed vials and dispense into a sterile 10 mL empty 
glass vial using a 3 mL syringe. 
For dilution, draw 0.3 mL of thawed concentrate into a 1 mL syringe and add it to the 10 mL sterile 
vial containing the solvent. Gently invert the vial at least five times for proper mixing. Inspect for any 
visual particulates. The diluted solution should be clear to slightly opalescent. Label the 10 mL glass 
vial containing the diluted concentrate as follows: ‘Diluted Luxturna’. 
Do not prepare syringes if the vial shows any damage or if any visual particulates are observed. 
Prepare the syringes for injection by drawing 0.8 mL of the diluted solution into a sterile 1 mL 
syringe. Repeat the same procedure to prepare a backup syringe. The product-filled syringes should 
then be transferred in a designated transport container to the surgical suite.

handling of voretigene neparvovec should be followed. 
- 
Personal protective equipment (to include laboratory coat, safety glasses and gloves) should be 
worn while handling or administering voretigene neparvovec. 
Accidental exposure to voretigene neparvovec, including contact with skin, eyes and mucous 
membranes, is to be avoided. Any exposed wounds should be covered before handling. 
All spills of voretigene neparvovec must be treated with a virucidal agent such as 1% sodium 
hypochlorite and blot using absorbent materials. 
All materials that may have come in contact with voretigene neparvovec (e.g. vial, syringe, 
needle, cotton gauze, gloves, masks or dressings) must be disposed of in accordance with local 
biosafety guidelines. 
- 
- 
- 
Accidental exposure 
- 
- 
In the event of an accidental occupational exposure (e.g. through a splash to the eyes or mucous 
membranes), flush with clean water for at least 5 minutes. 
In the event of exposure to broken skin or needlestick injury, clean the affected area thoroughly 
with soap and water and/or a disinfectant. 
Precautions to be taken for the disposal of the medicinal product 
This medicinal product contains genetically modified organisms. Unused medicinal product or waste 
material must be disposed of in compliance with the local guidance for pharmaceutical waste. 
Posology 
Treatment should be initiated and administered by a retinal surgeon experienced in performing 
macular surgery. 
Patients will receive a single dose of 1.5 × 1011 vector genomes voretigene neparvovec in each eye. 
Each dose will be delivered into the subretinal space in a total volume of 0.3 mL. The individual 
administration procedure to each eye is performed on separate days within a close interval, but no 
fewer than 6 days apart. 
Immunomodulatory regimen 
Prior to initiation of the immunomodulatory regimen and prior to administration of voretigene 
neparvovec, the patient must be checked for symptoms of active infectious disease of any nature, and 
in case of such infection the start of treatment must be postponed until after the patient has recovered. 
Starting 3 days prior to the administration of voretigene neparvovec to the first eye, it is recommended 
that an immunomodulatory regimen is initiated following the schedule below (Table 1). Initiation of 
the immunomodulatory regimen for the second eye should follow the same schedule and supersede 
completion of the immunomodulatory regimen of the first eye.

established. Data are limited. No adjustment in dose is necessary for paediatric patients. 
Method of administration 
Subretinal use. 
Luxturna is a sterile concentrate solution for subretinal injection that requires thawing and dilution 
prior to administration. 
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravitreal injection. 
Luxturna is a single-use vial for a single administration in one eye only. The product is administered 
as a subretinal injection after vitrectomy in each eye. It should not be administered in the immediate 
vicinity of the fovea to maintain foveal integrity. 
The administration of voretigene neparvovec should be carried out in the surgical suite under 
controlled aseptic conditions. Adequate anaesthesia should be given to the patient prior to the 
procedure. The pupil of the eye to be injected must be dilated and a broad-spectrum microbiocide 
should be topically administered prior to the surgery according to standard medical practice.

Administration 
Follow the steps below to administer voretigene neparvovec to patients: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Diluted Luxturna should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, 
cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the medicinal product must not be used. 
Connect the syringe containing the diluted product to the extension tube and subretinal injection 
cannula. The product is slowly injected through the extension tube and subretinal injection 
cannula to eliminate any air bubbles in the system. 
The volume of product available for injection is confirmed in the syringe, by aligning the 
plunger tip with the line that marks 0.3 mL. 
After vitrectomy is completed, Luxturna is administered by subretinal injection using a 
subretinal injection cannula introduced via pars plana. 
Under direct visualisation, the tip of the subretinal injection cannula is placed in contact with 
the retinal surface. The recommended site of injection should be located along the superior 
vascular arcade, at least 2 mm distal to the centre of the fovea. A small amount of the product is 
slowly injected until an initial subretinal bleb is observed, and then the remaining volume is 
slowly injected until the total 0.3 mL is delivered (Figure 1). 
Figure 1  Tip of the subretinal injection cannula placed within recommended site of injection 
(surgeon’s view) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
At the completion of the injection, the subretinal injection cannula is removed from the eye. 
After injection, any unused product must be discarded. The back-up syringe may not be 
retained. 
Fluid-air exchange is performed, carefully avoiding fluid drainage near the retinotomy created 
for the subretinal injection. 
Supine head positioning is initiated immediately in the post-operative period and, upon 
discharge should be maintained by the patient for 24 hours.

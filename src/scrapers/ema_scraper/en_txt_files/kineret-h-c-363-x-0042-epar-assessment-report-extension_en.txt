2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem Statement  
The extension of the Marketing Authorisation concerns a new strength (100 mg/0.67 ml) 
presented in a graduated single-use pre-filled syringe to allow a new dose regimen required for 
CAPS (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes) patients. The prefilled syringe also allows the 
administration of the 100 mg dosage required in RA patients. 
Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) is a rare monogenetic systemic 
autoinflammatory disease including the 3 sub-diagnoses neonatal onset multisystem 
inflammatory disease/chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular syndrome 
(NOMID/CINCA), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 
(FCAS). CAPS is a life-long disease, and symptoms appear early in life. The intended treatment 
population thus includes both paediatric and adult patients. The disease affects all ethnic groups 
and both sexes equally. 
In CAPS, the CAPS-associated mutations in the NLRP3 (also known as CIAS1) gene lead to an 
uncontrolled release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which induces inflammatory disease 
symptoms. The central role of IL-1 in CAPS has been demonstrated with IL-1 blocking agents 
(canakinumab and rilonacept) leading to a rapid clinical improvement of the inflammatory 
disease symptoms. 
CAPS, in all 3 subdiagnoses, are characterized by a multitude of inflammatory symptoms, 
including persistent urticarial-like skin rash, arthralgia, fever, headache and malaise. Laboratory 
findings reflect the presence of systemic inflammation and include leukocytosis, elevations in 
serum levels of amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR). Patients with FCAS and MWS experience frequent, intermittent 
episodes of incapacitation. FCAS is a chronic disease punctuated by acute flares triggered by 
exposure to cold, whereas in patients with MWS, the symptoms are more constant, and flares 
are unpredictable. In addition, patients with MWS often develop progressive neurosensory 
hearing loss. In the most severe form of CAPS, NOMID/CINCA, arthropathy associated with 
patellar and epiphyseal osseous overgrowth and neurological manifestations, including chronic 
aseptic meningitis, papilledema, sensorineural hearing loss, and mental retardation also to a 
variable degree affect patients. Approximately 20% of patients with NOMID/CINCA die before 
reaching adulthood if untreated. It is estimated that less than 200 individuals are affected by 
CAPS in the Western world, but milder and incomplete forms of the disease may be difficult to 
recognize.

About the Product 
Kineret (anakinra) is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of the human interleukin-1 (IL-1) 
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) produced in E. coli using recombinant DNA techniques.  
Anakinra is a 153 amino acid protein with an approximate molecular weight of 17.3 kDa. 
Anakinra belongs to the pharmacological class of IL-1 inhibitors, L04AC03 and is currently 
approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of RA in combination with methotrexate, 
in adults with an inadequate response to methotrexate alone. The recommended dose of 
anakinra is 100 mg administered once a day by subcutaneous injection. The dose should be 
administered at approximately the same time each day. 
The use of anakinra in CAPS patients includes a new dosage regimen that requires the allowance 
of partial use of the Kineret syringe. The proposed doses of anakinra in CAPS patients is as 
follows: recommended starting dose is 1-2 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection, and 
recommended maintenance dose is 1-2 mg/kg/day for milder cases and 3-4 mg/kg/day for more 
severe CAPS or patients with inadequate responses. Dose adjustments are to be performed in 
steps of 0.5-1 mg/kg. Daily life long treatment is expected, as anakinra alleviate the symptoms, 
but does not remove the underlying cause of CAPS. 
Type of application and aspects on development 
The applicant has submitted an application for an application for an extension of Marketing 
Authorisation for Kineret, under Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and 
Annex I (point 2 c). 
The applicant received scientific advice from the CHMP on 19 May 2011. The scientific advice 
pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Kineret is currently approved as 100 mg solution for injection in a non-graduated pre-filled 
syringe. The extension of the Marketing Authorisation concerns a new strength (100 mg/0.67 ml) 
presented in a graduated single-use pre-filled syringe to allow a new dose regimen required for 
CAPS (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes) patients. 
The graduation of the syringe with a dosage range of 20-100 mg and scale intervals of 10 mg is 
obtained by placing a graduated label on the syringe instead of the currently approved non-
graduated label. 
Kineret active substance and finished product are identical to the product already approved, 
except for the use of a graduated label. No additional changes have been made to the product. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Anakinra is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of the human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor 
antagonist (IL-1Ra) produced in Escherichia coli. The primary amino acid sequence is identical to 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 9/93 
 
  
the naturally occurring form of the protein except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine 
residue, required for production in E. coli. Anakinra is a 153 amino acid protein with a mass of 
approximately 17.3 kDa. 
Anakinra used for the manufacture of the new strength of Kineret 100 mg/0.67mL solution for 
injection presented in graduated pre-filled syringes has the same physicochemical, biological and 
immunological properties and is of the same quality as that used for the already marketed 
Kineret 100 mg solution for injection supplied in non-graduated pre-filled syringes. 
No further data was provided regarding the active substance for this line extension application as 
no new information or assessment was required. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Kineret is supplied as a sterile solution for injection for subcutaneous use with a deliverable 
volume of 0.67 mL in pre-filled, single use, colourless borosilicate Type I glass syringes. The 
syringe is labelled with a transparent label with a printed graduation made of a clear polyester 
film and an acrylic adhesive.  
The primary packaging materials, a pre-filled syringe consisting of a syringe barrel assembly and 
an elastomeric plunger stopper (bromobutyl rubber) have been adequately described. All 
components meet Ph. Eur. and USP requirements where applicable. 
Studies to monitor physicochemical aspects of the elastomeric stopper, extraction characteristics 
of the rubber closure and functional suitability indicate that the container system has no adverse 
impact on the finished product. Based on the results of various physical, chemical, and functional 
tests of the components the selection of the container closure system is therefore considered 
appropriate for the storage and delivery of the finished product. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal derived material are used in the manufacture of this medicinal 
product. All excipients used comply with the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements. 
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product manufacturing process is generally well-described. The dossier contains 
adequate detailed information on the manufacturing steps, operating conditions and in-process 
controls (IPC). 
Aging studies have been performed and demonstrated that storage of the syringes does not 
affect the position or readability of the graduated label. Results from two aging studies (position 
and adhesion of the label after storage) have been provided and confirmed that the label will not 
be dislocated during storage.

Product specification 
The proposed specifications for Kineret (100 mg/0.67 mL) and analytical methods are detailed 
in the dossier and remain the same as for the currently approved Kineret (100 mg).  
Stability of the product 
Based on the stability data provided the requested shelf-life (36 months when stored at 2°C to 
8°C in the original container to protect from light) is considered acceptable. 
For the purpose of ambulatory use, Kineret may be removed from the refrigerator for 12 hours 
at temperature not above 25°C, without exceeding the expiry date. At the end of this period, 
the product must be disposed of. 
Kineret is presented in a pre-filled syringe for single use only, containing no preservative. The 
sterility of the product over its shelf life is assured by the integrity of the primary packaging 
components. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development   
Information on development, manufacture and control of the new strength (100 mg/0.67 ml) of 
Kineret has been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The manufacturing process is well described. It was demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process of Kineret is capable, within its specified design parameters, of consistently producing a 
finished product or required quality. 
The in-process control tests are described and deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring 
the manufacturing process.  
The labelling process was validated and an additional in-process control was introduced to verify 
the position of the graduated label.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Overall, information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important quality characteristics.  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
To support the original marketing authorisation application (MAA), an extensive number 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicities studies were conducted. 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in support of new application. In support of the 
pharmacodynamic rationale for the use of anakinra in CAPS, the applicant has made reference to 
literature references.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamics studies performed with anakinra in support of the original application 
showed that anakinra inhibits the action of the cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β through its antagonist 
function at the receptor level. These cytokines are critical mediators of inflammation and joint 
damage in RA and other IL-1 driven diseases and cryopyrinopathies, e.g. CAPS.  
Support for a role of anakinra in CAPS 
Under normal conditions, serum and other body fluids do not contain detectable levels of IL-1. 
However, cellular production of IL-1 is induced in response to inflammation, immunologic 
reactions, microbial invasion, and tissue injury. The acute and chronic inflammatory diseases 
involving systemic inflammation associated with increased IL-1 activity are the IL-1-driven auto-
inflammatory diseases collectively called CAPS. Clinical efficacy data show that a reduction of the 
IL-1 activity can prevent the tissue lesions. IL-1β is virtually undetectable in human plasma still 
increased IL-1β serum concentrations in humans with CAPS syndromes was demonstrated by 
administering the anti-human IL-1β-antibody canakinumab and measuring the IL-1β-antibody 
complex (Lachmann et al 2009).  
Increased serum concentration of IL-1β has also been demonstrated in mice having mutations in 
the NLRP3 gene (Brydges et al 2009, Meng et al 2009). Hence, mice carrying mutations in the 
mouse NLRP3 gene (Nlrp3A350V/+CreT, Nlrp3L351P/+CreT) reproduce many of the features of CAPS 
syndromes in humans (scaling erythema, fever, arthralgia and conjunctivitis), although the 
phenotype appears to be more severe in this species (Brydges et al 2009). While the NLRP3 
A350V mutants survived for up to 14 days, the NLRP3 L351P mutants all died within post-natal 
day one. When the NLRP3 A350V mutant mice were crossed with mice lacking the IL-1 receptor 
type 1, the resultant offspring showed no symptoms or signs of CAPS, demonstrating that IL-1 
and its subsequent downstream signalling lies behind the symptoms associated with the 
condition in this model. Moreover, a slight increase in survival was observed following dosing 
with IL-1 blockers (Brydges et al 2009).  
Meng et al (2009) studied a different NLPR3 gene mutation (R258W) in transgenic mice and 
found that following 10 days of treatment with an IL-1-receptor blocking antibody, the skin 
lesions of inflamed R258W mice were markedly improved compared to mice receiving a control 
treatment.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 12/93 
 
  
Although IL-1 plays a role in inflammation, in the brain, the interleukin is also involved in 
hippocampal-dependent memory process (Goshen et al 2007), and in brain development 
(Spulber et al 2007, Yirmiya et al 2002). Goshen et al (2007) state “IL-1β, IL-1Ra and IL-1 
receptor genes are present during neonatal development in mouse embryos (Kruessel et al 
1997), and their proteins are detectable starting from the 2 cell stage and throughout human 
embryonic development (De los Santos et al 1996) as well as human newborns (Pillay et al 
1993). Specifically, IL-1β was found to increase with time in human forebrain cells during the 
first trimester.” In the rat, IL-1 levels are increased immediately before birth and remain 
elevated until the end of the first post natal week (Guilian et al 1988) which is a period of 
neurodevelopment (Kaffman and Meaney 2007).  
Goshen et al (2007) found that prenatal IL-1 blockade in mice have developmental consequences 
that results in memory deficiency in adulthood and state that this is consistent with previous 
reports on the neurodevelopment role of IL-1. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing the 
human soluble IL-1ra have smaller brains and poorer results in hippocampal-dependent learning 
tests than wild-type animals, and the difference is consistent in young (1 month old) and adult 
(12 month old) mice (Spulber et al 2011).  
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
No dedicated ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment was performed for this medicinal 
product, which is in accordance with the applicable guidance. The active substance is a protein, 
the use of which is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Therefore, anakinra is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies have been performed with anakinra to support he 
extension application. In support of the PD rationale for the use of anakinra in CAPS, the 
applicant has made reference to studies in transgenic mice reported in the literature which 
substantiated the pivotal role of IL-1 in CAPS. Taking into account also the convincing efficacy 
observed in the clinical studies, the CHMP considered this acceptable. 
The available literature also indicated that IL-1 plays an important role in brain development. 
Hence, there appears to be a narrow physiological range of IL-1 required for optimal brain 
development and both too little and too much IL-1 is detrimental to the normal (and optimal) 
brain development (Spulber et al 2011). Anakinra has been shown to cross the blood-brain 
barrier and has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both rhesus monkeys and 
humans. 
The human brain undergoes major development (brain growth spurt) within the first years after 
birth and brain development continues until adulthood (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005). The 
possible influence of anakinra treatment on this phase of brain development is of importance. 
Furthermore, as IL-1 also plays an important role in memory and learning, e.g. hippocampal-

with less severe forms of CAPS is also of importance. During the procedure the MAH has 
discussed thoroughly the possible effects of anakinra treatment on brain development based on 
literature and elaborated on the clinical relevance of the literature findings of negative effects on 
brain development after pre-natal IL-1 inhibition. In summary, the pre-clinical findings distinctly 
demonstrated the absence of adverse effects on the development of hippocampal memory 
functions in pups exposed prenatally to anakinra by daily injections of the dams. Even though, 
the literature demonstrated that the development of the hippocampal memory is vulnerable to 
changes in IL-1 homeostasis, it appeared that hippocampal memory is only detrimentally 
affected when the foetus is subjected to chronic and complete blockade of IL-1 signalling or 
pathologically elevated IL-1 levels. The MAH has also highlighted results from Lepore et al (2010) 
where health-related quality of life was evaluated following anakinra treatment, compared to 
baseline and healthy controls. The MAH highlighted role/social limitations-emotional/behavioural, 
behaviour, general behaviour, mental health and parent impact-emotional scores, as considered 
related to normal brain function. In all five categories, the scores were improved (statistically 
significantly) compared to baseline. So even though the development of hippocampal memory is 
vulnerable to changes in IL-1 homeostasis, treatment with anakinra did not appear to have 
adverse effect on cognitive function or memory.  
The safety pharmacology studies were evaluated as part of the original marketing authorisation 
application, and no anakinra related effects on the CNS, cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
were observed. 
In the original MAA, it was established that anakinra acts on different receptors to both NSAIDs 
and corticosteroids; hence pharmacodynamic drug interaction with commonly co-administered 
medicine such as NSAIDs and corticoids is not anticipated. However, it has been shown in the 
clinical setting that co-administration of anakinra and etanercept (TNFα antagonist) increased the 
risk for neutropenia and serious infections. Therefore the concurrent use of Kineret with 
etanercept or any other TNF antagonist is not recommended as already addressed in the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant has not performed any new PK studies. In the original MAA, PK studies performed 
in rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys were included. 
There are no clinical PK data available for children below 4 years of age. Anakinra is primarily 
excreted via the kidneys. The kidneys are functionally immature in children younger than one 
year. During the procedure, the Applicant further discussed the possible influence of the lack of 
kidney maturation on the PK of anakinra in the paediatric population. The glomerular filtration 
rate as studied by renal clearance of gentamicin and vancomycin (both evaluated as mL/min/kg) 
as well as inulin (evaluated as mL/min/1.73m2, body surface area) was provided. For gentamicin 
and vancomycin, limited variation in body-weight normalised GFR was observed, whereas, when 
body-surface normalised data obtained for inulin, showed a much larger variation (decrease) in 
GFR. Records showed as much as a 6-fold difference from neonate (<24 h) to adult (neonate; 
approximately 20 ml/min/1.73m2 and adult: 127 ml/min/1.73m2). However, as the proposed 
indication is treatment from 8 months of age, the relevant literature value is the one listed for 3-
12 months of age, at 103-110ml/min/1.73m2. As the proposed SmPC specify mild renal 
impairment as GFR below 50 mL7min or 29 mL/min/1.73m2, the reduced GFR observed in 
infants (3-12 months) is of no concern.  
Kineret (anakinra)

Available PK data in severe CAPS patients 4 years of age and above, support minor influence of 
age on the exposure to anakinra over 3.5 years of treatment. In study 03-AR-0298, patients 
between 8 months and 4 years of age (not included in the PK population) started at daily dosage 
of 1-2 mg/kg and were effectively treated with no reported safety concerns. 
Toxicology 
No new toxicology studies have been submitted in support of the present application. In support 
of the original application, single and repeated dose toxicity studies have been performed in both 
rat and cynomolgus monkey, and repeated dose toxicity studies in rhesus monkey as well. The 
lack of any new single-dose toxicity studies is acceptable and in line with the Questions & 
answers on the withdrawal of the “Note for guidance on single dose toxicity” 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010). 
Kidney toxicity in the form of proteinuria, increased kidney weight, renal interstitial mononuclear 
cell infiltration and chronic progressive nephropathy were observed in rats treated with anakinra 
for 6 months. Taking these findings into consideration along with the fact that the elimination of 
anakinra is mainly through the kidneys and the kidney is functionally immature in children 
younger than one year, an increased risk for development of kidney toxicity in young children 
cannot be fully excluded. During the procedure, the MAH has discussed whether the 
administration of anakinra to children below one year of age may be associated with kidney 
toxicity. The MAH has argued, that the kidney toxicity observed in the 6 month rat repeat dose 
toxicity study is species specific, and due to the protein nature and human origin of anakinra. 
Anakinra may have contributed to the development of the chronic nephropathy in rats through 
immune complex formation and the renal excretion of anakinra protein causing a protein 
overload. In monkeys, proteinuria was also observed in the 4 week repeat dose study. Urinalysis 
confirmed that anakinra was found in the urine, and the MAH has drawn the conclusion that the 
proteinuria was a result of excreted anakinra and a sign of functioning renal clearance rather 
than a sign of kidney toxicity. This is supported by the CHMP. The MAH reinforced that no safety 
signals related to kidney toxicity was observed in patients down to 8 months of age (03-AR-
0298). Therefore, the CHMP considered that there is no specific concern for the use of anakinra 
in CAPS patients above the age of 8 months with regards to kidney toxicity.  
Since 1) slight effects on the immune system was observed in the toxicity studies conducted with 
anakinra (slight enhancement of the NK cell activity and a mild increase in eosinophil count in 
rats), 2) neutropenia is observed in the clinical setting and 3) the immune system undergoes 
development until adolescence, anakinra treatment might potentially be associated with effects 
on immune system development when administered chronically to children. During the 
procedure, the MAH has reviewed in the literature the impact of anakinra treatment on the 
developing immune system. The MAH has not found any indications that the developing immune 
system in animals is affected by chronic exposure to exaggerated levels of IL-1Ra (Boggs et al 
1995, Doughty et al (1997), Ma et al 1998). 
The MAH has also performed an examination of the clinical safety data (03-AR-0298), and 
showed that anakinra exposure would not affect the development of the immune system in CAPS 
patients. Of the patients younger than 1 year included in Study 03-AR-0298, 3 of 5 were 
hospitalized due to an infection once or more. However, all patients continued with anakinra 
treatment during infections, and the infections resolved without sequelae. Also in this study, 2

patients showed transient neutropenia, but did not discontinue anakinra treatment and the 
neutropenia resolved. Taken together, the published preclinical data from transgenic animals and 
the clinical safety data do not indicate that exposure to anakinra would affect the development of 
the immune system in CAPS patients. In addition, according to the proposed indication, patients 
younger than 8 months should not be treated with Kineret. 
No juvenile studies were performed with anakinra. Juvenile animal studies focusing on the risk 
for treatment-related effects on CNS, kidney and immune system development could have 
provided valuable information on this aspect. However, finding an appropriate animal model to 
further elucidate the complexities of IL-1 homeostasis on brain development would prove to be 
difficult, as the dose-response relationship of IL-1 and brain development is bi-phasic, and both 
too little and too much is apparently detrimental to normal brain development. As the MAH 
pointed out, a CAPS mouse model of would possibly be suitable, however, as early mortality 
appeared evident (Brydges et al 2009), this model would be difficult to implement. Although 
there is limited clinical data available, the data previously discussed (Lepore et al 2010), are 
reassuring with regards to brain development. Overall, as discussed earlier in the present 
assessment, the concerns identified for adverse effects on CNS, kidney and immune system 
development mainly in children younger than two years of age have been addressed 
satisfactorily by the MAH and no further animal studies in juvenile models have been considered 
necessary by the CHMP. 
As the proposed extension application does not introduce any new routes of administration, no 
additional local tolerance study needed to be conducted. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in support of the current extension application 
which is acceptable to the CHMP. In combination with the convincing clinical efficacy data, the 
CHMP also concluded that the literature data provided by the applicant supports the use of 
anakinra for the treatment of CAPS in the paediatric and adult populations.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
General PK has been investigated in healthy subjects and RA patients and was described in the 
original MAA for anakinra. The PK data in CAPS patients, especially in the paediatric population, 
is based on the pivotal study 03-AR-0298. For comparative purposes PK data from juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients in study 990758 and its extension, study 990779, (Procedure 
OTH 017 assessed by the CHMP in 2006) and adult RA patients in study 0502 (original MAA) 
were reported in this submission. Finally, a population PK report 100788 (included in original 
MAA) was presented based on 3 studies in RA patients (studies 0501, 0502 and 0560). The study 
population, design, PK analysis method and evaluated PK evaluated variables are described in 
the table below.

Pharmacokinetic methodology 
Blood samples for PK evaluation were drawn on 3 occasions: after the first dose, after 
approximately 3 months, and 3 years of treatment. At each occasion, blood was collected before

dose and at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after dose. In addition, one CSF sample per patient was drawn 
at baseline and after 3 months to evaluate the potential increase in interleukin-1 receptor 
antagonist (IL-1Ra) levels in the CSF following treatment with anakinra. Anakinra concentrations 
in serum and CSF samples were determined using the IL-1Ra Cytoscreen assay. The bioanalytical 
method was shifted from an IL-1Ra standard at baseline and Month 3 to an anakinra standard at 
3.5 years. IL-1Ra and anakinra were analysed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) method. The CSF samples were determined against the IL-1Ra standard. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The PK population comprised 21 patients; of these, 13 patients were assessed at baseline (first 
dose), 14 at Month 3, and 16 at approximately 3.5 years. The median (range) age at the time of 
the first anakinra dose (N=21) was 11.4 (4.2-42.2) years. Of the 21 patients 13 were within the 
age interval 2-11 years, 4 patients within 12-17 years, and 4 patients above 18 years. The 
median body weight was 31.3 kg with a range of 13.0-82.2 kg. The gender distribution was 11 
males and 10 females, and the race distribution was 17 White, 1 Asian, 1 Black, and 2 Other. 
The dose range during the PK assessments was 1.0-4.5 mg/kg/day administered 
subcutaneously. The concentration in CSF was measured before start of treatment in 11 patients 
and after about 3 months in 12 patients. 
The PK population exhibited baseline serum concentrations of IL-1Ra before the first dose that 
extended above but covered that reported for healthy subjects. Once-daily dosing resulted in a 
low increase in IL-1Ra in serum after the first dose until Month 3, consistent with the PK of 
anakinra. The IL-1Ra concentration in CSF increased from 15.7 pg/mL before the first dose of 
Kineret to 797 pg/mL (median of N=12) at Month 3. This is in line with the previous finding of 
CSF penetration in non-human primates (Fox et al 2010). At a median s.c. dose of 3 mg/kg once 
daily and a median treatment time of 3.5 years, the median (range) peak steady-state serum 
concentration of anakinra was 3628 (655–8511) ng/mL and the trough concentration was 203 
(53–1979) ng/mL. The median (range) half-life of anakinra was 5.7 (3.1–28.2) hours. Within the 
age and body-weight range of the subjects in the PK population, the dose-adjusted area under 
the curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 
showed no trend versus age or body weight, and there was no gender difference in the PK.  
The exposure of IL-1Ra in terms of dose adjusted Cmax, C24h and AUC0-24h is given in the 
table below after the first dose of anakinra and at Month 3. The estimated median dose 
normalized AUC0-24h in all patients increased from 4353 ng·h·mL-1/mg·kg-1 at baseline to 4897 
ng·h·mL-1/mg·kg-1 following 3 months of treatment, which corresponds to an increase of about 
12%. The observed increases in AUC0-24h in the age classes 2-11, 12-17 and ≥18 years were 
14%, 33%, and 24%, respectively. The numbers of patients in the respective age groups were 
small, ranging between 1 and 9.

Effect of demographic variables on the pharmacokinetics of anakinra 
•  Body weight 
CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298 were dosed on a body weight basis and adjusted according 
to the severity of the disease. No definite trend in exposure versus body weight was observed. 
This indicates that the non-adjusted exposure is dependent on the body weight. In the 
population PK analysis it was demonstrated that anakinra CL/F value increased with increasing 
body weight.

For study 990758, the correlation between body weight and PK parameters in JIA patients has 
not been directly presented in the report (study 990758). However, plasma concentrations

normalized to a daily fixed s.c. dose of 100 mg anakinra, showed a trend of higher 
concentrations in the youngest JIA patients compared to JIA patients of higher age and to adult 
RA patients. Since there is a positive correlation between the JIA patient age groups and the RA 
patients, the normalized concentrations were inversely related to body weight, with higher 
ranges of concentrations observed for patients with the lowest body weights. The lower 
concentration at increasing body weight in in JIA patients (study 990758) is consistent with the 
results of the population PK modeling performed using data from adult patients with RA, which 
demonstrated that the anakinra CL/F value increased with increasing body weight (Report 
100788). Overall, data on body weight, exposure, and clearance indicate that that dosage of 
anakinra should be adjusted for body weight, especially in the most severe form of CAPS, i.e. 
NOMID/CINCA. 
•  Gender 
There was no obvious gender difference in the anakinra serum concentration time profiles in 
8 male and 8 female patients in study 03-AR-0298. In the population PK analysis (Report 100788 
in original MAA it was concluded that in study 0560 the mean CL/F value was approximately 14% 
higher in men than in women. However, after adjusting for CLcr and body weight, sex was not a 
significant factor for CL/F. After adjustment of CLcr and body weight, gender is not significant 
factor for CL/F. 
•  Age 
PK data is not available for children below 4 years and below 15 kg from study 03-AR-0298. 
However, patients ≥ 0.7 years and with a body weight ≥ 6.0 kg have been included in the study 
and have successfully been initiated and maintained on treatment with positive outcome. 
Thirteen children < 2 years (age median (range) 1.2 (0.7-1.8) years, body weight median 
(range) 7.7 (6.0-15.2)) were included in the safety/efficacy study and treated successfully. For 
patients < 2 years of age, the starting dose ranged between 1.0 and 2.4 mg/kg (N=13). It can 
be estimated that patients at an age of 1 year need a 20% higher dose than a subject of 4 years 
to adjust for the higher clearance per kg body weight at the lower age. The safe and effective 
administration of Kineret in patients starting at 0.7 years of age is in line with the  theoretically 
estimated relatively small changes in clearance from 4 years (from which PK data is available for 
anakinra) and down to about 1 year.

A brief overview of general PK is provided for completeness. Distribution to CNS is added. 
Absorption  
Following  subcutaneous  injection,  anakinra  is  absorbed  with  maximal  plasma  levels  obtained 
within 3 to 9 hours post injection. The relative bioavailability of anakinra following subcutaneous 
injection  is  approximately  95%.  Following  subcutaneous  injection,  the  terminal  half-life  of 
anakinra is longer than after intravenous injection (3 to 9.5 hours versus 2 hours), reflecting the 
effect of the slow absorption rate following subcutaneous injection. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous injection, anakinra distributes initially into a volume of 3.6 L and 
subsequently distributes into a steady-state volume of 9 to 15 L. These volumes of distribution 
data were consistent with initial distribution into the physiological plasma volume (3 L) and 
subsequent distribution into a steady-state distribution volume that approximates the 
extracellular volume (18.2 L). In study 03-AR-0298 CSF IL-1Ra concentrations in lumbar 
puncture samples were measured at baseline and at Month 3 in 11 and 12 patients 
respectively. The median CSF concentration of CSF IL-1Ra increased from a pre-dose baseline 
of 15.7 pg/mL to a Month 3 concentration of 797 pg/mL. 
Elimination 
In the dose-range studied (1 to 10 mg/kg) the pharmacokinetics of anakinra was linear. The 
clearance is about 150 ml/min and is correlated to renal creatinine clearance. Clearance was 
modestly higher than the estimated glomerular filtration rate. These data suggest that in humans 
(like in animals), anakinra is predominantly eliminated via the kidneys. However, the route of 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 24/93 
 
  
 
elimination has not been studied directly in humans. Urinary recovery of anakinra in humans was 
low suggesting that anakinra filtered in the glomeruli is absorbed and metabolised by the renal 
tubular cells. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In study 03-AR-0298 the starting dose ranged from 1.0 – 2.4 mg/kg. Dose increments of about 
0.5 mg/kg were performed approximately 6 months after initiation of treatment and then after 
an additional 12 months and thereafter additionally 18-36 months, i.e. after treatment times of 
about 6, 18, and 36-54 months duration based on clinical response (clinical symptoms and 
elevated CRP). Due to dose adjustments in order to achieve the treatment objectives, the 
average dose at the end of the study was higher than the initial dose levelling off to a range of 
3.2-3.6 mg/kg after 48-60 months, for all age groups (<2, 2-11, 12-17 and ≥ 18 yrs). 
In a retrospective study of 10 patients with CAPS (Neven et al, 2010), the two youngest patients 
of 3 and 4 months require a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day to achieve relieve of symptoms. 
The minimum amount to be delivered directly from the graded syringe is proposed to be 20 mg, 
and dose adjustments possible in steps of 10 mg. Anakinra PK exhibits approximate dose 
linearity with a slight tendency to higher than proportional increase with increasing dose.

No formal dose frequency evaluation was performed. In study 03-AR-0298 95 % of the patient 
years represented once-daily dosing. During the withdrawal period clinical symptoms appeared 
after the first day, confirming the necessity of once-daily dosing.

symptoms of DSSS (study 03-AR-0298) 
Time dependency 
It was not possible to measure the accumulation of anakinra between 3 months and 3.5 years in 
study 03-AR-0298 due to change in standard IL-1RA to anakinra in the bioanalytical method. 
Numerically there is a 3-fold increase in dose-adjusted exposure, but the apparent increase in 
exposure may be due to the change in standard. Preclinical data have shown significant 
accumulation that may be the result of decreases in glomerular filtration of anakinra secondary 
to binding to anti-anakinra antibodies or other proteins. There is no evidence of decreased 
clearance after 3.5 years of treatment.  
Special populations   
No new studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic functions. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug-drug interaction study has been performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
At the molecular level, CAPS-associated mutations in the NLRP3 (also known as CIAS1) gene 
leads to an uncontrolled release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Kineret blocks the 
biological activity of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the interleukin-1 type I 
receptor (IL-1RI), which is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and organs. Ex vivo CAPS 
patient cells secrete high levels of cytokine response to inflammatory stimuli, which confirms the 
importance of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of CAPS. IL-6 is a downstream cytokine of IL-1β and, in 
contrast to IL-1β, IL-6 is readily measurable in serum from patients with CAPS. Besides the 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report

clinical symptoms of CAPS, IL-1β also mediates the synthesis of the hepatic acute phase 
reactants CRP and SAA. These are common and sensitive markers for inflammation. CRP, SAA 
and IL-6 are markers for the pharmacodynamics of anakinra. Together they confirm the 
antagonism of IL-1β by Kineret and support the treatment effect of Kineret in CAPS. 
Primary pharmacology 
This section summarizes findings on the selected markers for the PD of Kineret, i.e. CRP, SAA 
and IL-6. The data on these markers are derived from the pivotal trial supporting this application 
supported by 7 studies published in the literature. The three selected markers have not 
consistently been reported in all studies but together they confirm the antagonism of IL-1β by 
Kineret and support the treatment effect of Kineret in CAPS. The studies are listed below.

A dramatic and persistent normalization of acute phase reactants was reported. 
Kümmerke-Deschner et al, 2011 
A statistically significant decrease in CRP and SAA from baseline to median follow-up (11 
months) was reported. The CRP level normalized in 45% of those who had an elevation at 
baseline. The SAA levels mirrored the CRP, improving at 2 weeks and significantly decreasing 
over the long term. 
Hawkins et al, 2004 
After 7 days, the plasma SAA concentration decreased to <3 mg/L in all 3 subjects and remained 
below this level on fortnightly follow-up testing for 3 months. 
Ross et al, 2008 
The reduction in CRP during treatment was significant (mean change -14.38, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 7.35 to -21.42, p ≤ 0.0001) and was followed by a significant increase in CRP 
(mean change -15.19, 95% CI 4.88 to 25.50, p = 0.0013) post-treatment. Similar results were 
observed for SAA. Overall, the circulating concentration of CRP and SAA closely mirrored the 
clinical activity of the disease. 
Hoffman et al, 2010 
There were no significant differences in CRP or SAA between FCAS patients and controls at 
baseline. Although no change in acute phase reactants were observed the patients pretreated 
with 2 doses of anakinra 24 h apart before cold challenge did not develop any of the signs or 
symptoms that they developed during their previous cold challenge. 
Neven et al, 2010 
Of the 10 patients the two youngest (3 and 4 months old) had baseline CRP of 150 and 305 
mg/L, respectively. The median (range) of CRP and SAA for the other 8 patients (6-19.8 years) 
were 69 (26-110) mg/L and 150 (48-386) mg/L, respectively. CRP and SAA levels in the patients 
> 6 years of age rapidly decreased 1 month after the initiation of anakinra. Further follow-up 
revealed dose-dependent benefits in 3 patients. Inflammation marker levels also significantly and 
persistently improved in the two youngest patients after upward adjustment of the anakinra 
dosage. 
Leslie et al, 2006 
Serum CRP and SAA levels normalized (< 10 mg/L) within 1 week in all patients, with median 
values of 2 mg/L and 5 mg/L, respectively. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK has been investigated in healthy subjects and patients with RA in the original MAA for Kineret. 
PK in CAPS patients and especially in the paediatric population is based on the pivotal CAPS 
study 03-AR-0298 where 21 of the 43 patients represent the PK population. For comparative 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 28/93 
 
  
purposes PK data from JIA patients in study 990758 (previously assessed by the CHMP in 2006) 
and adult RA patients in study 0502 (original MAA) were included. Finally, a population PK 
evaluation was presented based on 3 studies in RA patients (0501, 0502 and 0560).  
PK parameter values were presented from the once-daily treated patients in the pivotal CAPS 
study 03-AR-0298, the 0502 RA study, and the population PK evaluation in RA patients. The 
median clearance in study 03-AR-0298 was similar to the estimates from the repeated-dose 
segment of study 0502 (73.5 versus 86.6 mL/h.kg) whereas the median dose-normalized Cmax 
was rather higher (999 versus 878 ng/mL). For unknown reasons, a higher estimate was 
obtained for study 0560 (128 mL/h.kg) compared to study 0501/0502. The median terminal half-
life estimates are similar, around 6 hours, for all studies. In study 03-AR-0298 one subject 
showed a distinctly longer half-life (28.2 hours) than other patients. However, based on the 
overall PK profile derived from the severe CAPS patients, no markedly different PK characteristics 
relative to RA patients are observed. Anakinra exhibits approximate dose linearity (Cmax and 
AUC) with a slight tendency to higher than proportional increase but this raise no clinical 
concern.  The PK in CAPS patients is similar to that of RA patients. 
Inter-individual variability from study 03-AR-0298 showed that the coefficient of the maximal 
concentration (Cmax) is remarkable stable over time. The AUC(0-24)/dose and the clearance range 
between and 31-51% and 36-59% respectively and thus, shows a greater variability. Intra-
individual PK variability could not be estimated due to differences in the bioanalytical methods 
used during the study period of study 03-AR-0298.  
PK results from study 03-AR-0298 have confirmed that anakinra distributes to the central 
nervous system as anakinra distributes to the cerebrospinal fluid. 
The PK profile of anakinra has been evaluated in a subset of the CAPS patients in study 03-AR-
0298. The median age of was 11.4 (4.2 to 42.2) years. PK data is thus not available from 
children below 4 years and below 15 kg. However, patients with an age ≥ 0.7 years and with a 
body weight ≥ 6.0 kg have been included in the study and have successfully been initiated and 
maintained on treatment with positive outcome. It was estimated that patients of 1 year need a 
20% higher dose than a subject of 4 years to adjust for the higher clearance per kg body weight 
at the lower age. The safe and effective administration of Kineret in patients starting at 0.7 years 
of age is in line with the estimated rather small changes in clearance from 4 years and down to 
about 1 year. It is therefore considered that the PK data presented are representative of the 
target population. 
CAPS patients were dosed on a body weight basis and adjusted according to the clinical 
response. Patients were started at a body weight adjusted dosage of 1-2 mg/kg/day. In the 
published studies supporting efficacy of Kineret the starting dose approach has been based on 
body weight as well as on a fixed dose. In the studies with FCAS patients (Hoffman et al 2009 
and Ross et al 2008) only adults were included and they were started at a dosage of 
100 mg/day. The same starting dose was used for MWS patients in the study by Hawkins et al 
2004 and in the study by Kümmerle-Deschner et al 2011 for patients with body weights > 40 kg. 
In the study by Leslie et al 2006 NOMID/CINCA patients were also started at a dose of 100 mg. A 
100 mg dose corresponds to a 1-2 mg/kg dose in patients within the body weight range 50 to 
100 kg. For patients with lower body weights than 50 kg, a 1-2 mg/kg dose would accordingly 
reduce the starting dose to e.g. 20 mg for a 10 kg child, which in e.g. study 03-AR-0298 has 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 29/93 
 
  
been demonstrated to be a safe and effective. This provides a rationale for a starting dose 
recommendation of 1-2 mg/kg for all CAPS patients. 
Dose adjustments were performed with the aim to achieve efficacy in severe CAPS patients, i.e. 
systemic inflammatory remission and absence of organ inflammation. Dose increments of about 
0.5 mg/kg were performed approximately 6 months after initiation of treatment and then after 
an additional 12 months and thereafter additionally 18-36 months, i.e. after treatment times of 
about 6, 18, and 36-54 months duration. It became clear during the initial years of treatment 
that, in addition to the basic criteria of preventing disease flares such as rash, fever, and 
elevated CRP, dose adjustments had to address “smoldering” organ inflammation to prevent 
progression of organ damage and to preserve organ function (e.g. hearing). Thus, the criteria for 
dose escalation evolved during the study from dose increases mainly due to clinical symptoms 
and elevated CRP to focus also on organ inflammation of eyes, inner ear, and CNS. Due to dose 
adjustments in order to achieve the treatment objectives, the average dose at the end of the 
study was higher than the initial dose leveling off to a range of 3.2-3.6 mg/kg after 48-60 
months, for all age groups (<2, 2-11, 12-17 and ≥ 18 yrs). Information regarding the magnitude 
of dose adjustments in the supportive published studies are lacking. However, the dose 
adjustments applied in severe CAPS patients (steps of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg) would also be applicable 
for less severe CAPS patients. Dose adjustments could be easily managed due to the short half-
life of anakinra. 
No formal dose frequency response evaluation has been performed. However, the PK profile of 
anakinra and the data from the drug withdrawal population in study 03-AR-0298 support daily 
s.c. injection of anakinra. In study 03-AR-0298, 95 % of the patient years represented once-daily 
dosing and during the withdrawal period clinical symptoms appeared after the first day, 
confirming the necessity of once-daily dosing. 
The accumulation from the first dose until Month 3 was low (using IL-1Ra standard). 
Concentrations after approximately 3.5 years (using anakinra standard) were similar to those 
observed in RA studies. 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed in human subjects. Experimental studies 
in human hepatocyte culture published in the literature have shown that that interleukin (IL)-1β 
and IL-6 both suppress cytochrome P450 mRNA and enzyme levels in vitro. The MAH has 
performed a search in their safety database in order to evaluate the clinical effect of this 
potential interaction. From a total of 26,000 reports in the safety database, 16 events that could 
potentially result from an increased activity of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system were 
identified. Therefore, the MAH proposed to add in section 4.5 of the SmPC that the formation of 
CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines, and that treatment with an IL-1 
receptor antagonist might normalize/change the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Based on the 
data presented and analysed the CHMP considered justified to include the information in the 
SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The 8 studies providing efficacy data also reported data on markers for pharmacodynamic 
responses. SAA and CRP are acute phase reactants that are closely related to IL-1 activity, and 
thereby reflect treatment efficacy of anakinra. Since CRP and SAA were not measured in all 
studies, IL-6 was also included as a PD marker to be assessed across studies. Thereby an

outcome was measurable in all studies, including Hoffman et al 2009, where only 2 single-doses 
were given to FCAS patients. Decreased levels of CRP following anakinra treatment were 
reported in all CAPS entities at repeated dosages. SAA also decreased in all studies where 
measurements were performed at repeated dosage. IL-6 decreased in FCAS patients (both at 
single and repeated dosage), in MWS and in NOMID patients. In study 03-AR-0298 the IL-6 
decrease was more marked in CSF than in serum.  The combined outcome of CRP, SAA and IL-6 
as PD markers confirms that anakinra decreases IL-1 activity in all 3 CAPS entities. 
The importance of daily dosing and maintaining adequate anakinra concentrations to achieve a 
stable PD response in terms of inflammatory biomarkers is obvious from data obtained from the 
withdrawal period in a subset of the CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298. In study 03-AR-0298 
the median SAA was 7 mg/L during Kineret treatment before the withdrawal period was started. 
At the end of the drug withdrawal period (duration 2-7 days), SAA had increased to 310 mg/L. A 
similar rapid response was found for high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), which was 4 
mg/L before the withdrawal and increased at the end of the withdrawal period to 72 mg/L.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK in CAPS patients has been shown to be similar to that in RA patients. Gender, race and age 
are not found to be significant factors for CL/F. 
Data from the CAPS studies support a starting dose of 1-2 mg/kg in all 3 CAPS entities and ages. 
Up- or downward dose adjustments can be performed based on clinical response. Body-weight 
adjusted dosage is a safe and effective approach for treatment of CAPS, also in children older 
than one year. Weight adjusted dosage based on clinical and response and measures of CRP in 
increments of 0.5-1 mg/kg is appropriate. The maintenance dose is in general lowest in FCAS 
and highest in NOMID/CINCA patients.  
No formal dose frequency response evaluation has been performed. However, the PK profile of 
anakinra and the data from the drug withdrawal population in study 03-AR-0298 support a once 
daily dosing in patients with severe CAPS or alternatively also on-demand in FCAS patients. 
Dose adjustments were performed with the aim to achieve efficacy in severe CAPS patients, i.e. 
systemic inflammatory remission and absence of organ inflammation. The maximum allowed 
dose of anakinra was increased over time in the study from 1-2 mg/kg body weight, to 3 mg/kg, 
5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg. The posology section of the SmPC reflects the clinical study data and 
current clinical practice.  
Untreated CAPS patients are characterized by increased CRP, SAA and IL-6 relative to normal 
levels. Administration of Kineret resulted in a decrease in the acute phase reactants in all clinical 
CAPS studies except the study by Hoffman et al 2004, where only two doses of anakinra were 
given but where nevertheless a marked decrease in IL-6 expression level was observed. 
Decreased acute phase levels were noted within the first weeks of treatment and sustained 
throughout the studies. Anakinra treatment often resulted in complete normalization of the acute 
phase reactants. The combined outcome of CRP, SAA and IL-6 as PD markers confirms that 
anakinra decreases IL-1 activity in all 3 CAPS entities. The pharmacodynamic action of anakinra 
as an IL-1 receptor antagonist explains the clinical effect in CAPS patients with elevated IL-1.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The anakinra dose is adjusted to the clinical response. No formal exposure-response evaluation 
has been performed. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study 03-AR-0298: a long-term outcome study with the IL-1receptor antagonist anakinra in 
patients with neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID/CINCA syndrome). 
Methods 
This was a prospective, long-term, open-label outcome study to investigate the clinical response 
of Kineret in NOMID/CINCA patients comparing the change in disease diary score from baseline 
to 3-6 months and every 6 months thereafter while on treatment. Change in SAA levels from 
before to after treatment was assessed. Long-term effects on neurological parameters, hearing, 
vision, joint status, and quality of life were studied. The overall study design and sequence of 
treatment periods are presented in Figure 1. 
Figure  5 
Study 03-AR-0298 design 
The study comprised the following phases: 
- Enrolment/observation phase and initial treatment for 1-6 months 
The enrollment/observation phase lasted for up to 3 weeks to determine main baseline 
characteristics. If eligible, the patient was started on an open-label administration of Kineret at 
1-2 mg/kg/day by s.c. injections. 
Patients were admitted to the NIH for a standardized subspecialty examination before drug 
initiation and between 3 and 6 months after. The change in clinical diary scores from 
enrollment/baseline to the 3-6 months appointment was assessed (primary efficacy endpoint). 
Dose escalations between 0.5-1 mg/kg/day were possible in order to elicit positive response, on 
a case-by-case basis.

The protocol initially included visits after 1 month and after 3-4 months of Kineret treatment; 
however, for logistic reasons, these visits were no longer mandatory in later versions of the 
protocol, but instead replaced by a 3-6 month visit. Also, the screening period included 3 
occasions for baseline blood draws to determine level of inflammation (1 week apart) for the 
first 18 patients, but the period was thereafter shortened to 3-7 days and coincided with the 
first visit to the NIH. 
- Withdrawal phase 
Prior to June 28, 2004, the study included a withdrawal phase, where, during a period of 
maximum 7 days, Kineret was withdrawn and clinical symptoms were recorded, as well as SAA, 
hsCRP, and ESR levels determined. However, the withdrawal period was discontinued, because 
of the significance of the study drug treatment effects seen in the first 11 patients and the 
severity of their flares upon withdrawal. During the time the withdrawal period was included in 
the protocol, assessment of change in SAA levels from before to after a maximum of 7 days of 
drug withdrawal or up to flare was included as a primary endpoint. 
- Month 6 visit and onward (open-ended extension phase) 
Patients received study treatment throughout the study. Patients and parents continued to fill 
out the NOMID/CINCA daily diaries. At any point during the study, patients could have the dose 
of Kineret increased by 0.5-1 mg/kg/day increments up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day if 
active disease persisted. They returned to the NIH for an outpatient safety and efficacy 
evaluation every 6 months. Annually, patients returned to the NIH for a full safety and efficacy 
assessment visit. 
After 5 years of treatment in the study, patients were offered continued treatment and returned 
only for annual visits. 
Study Participants  
Individuals with NOMID were eligible for participation in this study. Patients previously evaluated 
at the NIH who had been clinically diagnosed with NOMID, including patients with and without

Treatments 
The initial dose of anakinra given was 1-2 mg/kg body weight per day. First evaluation of the 
clinical response was done 1-3 months after initiation. At intervals no less than 7 days, a patient 
who was not in clinical remission could continue to have his/her anakinra dose increased in 
increments between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg to a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg per day to achieve clinical 
remission. 
Criteria for dose escalation included: 
1.  A clinically inadequate response (one of the following criteria): 
• 
improvement on the diary score from baseline by less or equal to 20% 
•  SAA level >10mg/mL 
• 
requirement of additional DMARD therapy (the date and time of initiating additional 
therapy were to be recorded, for steroid increase. 
•  persistently elevated CRP level >0.5mg/dL 
•  persistent active (inflammatory) organ disease and/or 
2.  Development of a flare (as defined below) after having received Kineret for at least 4 weeks. 
A flare was defined as at least 2 of the following parameters: 
•  If the typical rash of NOMID worsened (increase in rash diary score by 1 or more) on 4 
different days in one week. 
•  If fever occurred on 4 or more occasions in one week with a temperature of >98.6°F, 
(>37°C). Temperature was taken axillary every morning before drug administration, 
temperature could be taken additionally when clinically suspected. 
•  If episodes of vomiting or headache developed on 3 days out of a week, were more 
frequent than before, and could not be attributed to an infection. 
•  If neurosensory symptoms associated with worsening of the disease occurred, including 
vision or hearing impairment or new onset tinnitus or vertigo (only one criterion required 
to meet definition of flare). Corneal oedema was retrospectively included as a symptom 
indicating eye flare because of the seriousness of the condition. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Enbrel, Remicade, Humira, and other anti-TNF inhibitory drugs such as thalidomide were to be 
discontinued prior to initiation of Kineret therapy because of the increased risk of infection on 
combination treatment. Concomitant DMARDs other than Enbrel, Remicade, and other anti-TNF 
Kineret (anakinra)

inhibiting agents such as Humira or thalidomide could be continued throughout the study. 
DMARD use was to remain stable during the initial 3-6 months, but tapering was permitted 
thereafter. Steroid use could be reduced according to the guidelines.

Sample size 
Protocol version August 8, 2003, was designed to have a statistical power of 80% with the use of 
a two-sided test, with a level of significance of 0.05, to detect a mean difference in diary scores 
before and after treatment equal in magnitude to the standard deviations of the differences. This 
would have required at least 10 patients. 
Randomisation 
All patients enrolled received the study drug. Randomisation procedures were not required. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study and blinding procedures were not required.  
Statistical methods 
The DSSS (primary endpoint) was the sum of 5 symptoms, and the mean value over the last 30 
days before each visit was used as the response variable. The DSSS were primarily analysed 
using a repeated measures analysis of covariance (RMANCOVA) model. All visits after baseline 
were used as response in the model. The visit was included as a fixed factor and baseline value 
as a covariate. Changes from baseline to each visit were estimated based on the RMANCOVA 
model. In addition to the estimate of change, 95% confidence intervals and p-values comparing 
the change to zero were calculated. The change from baseline in SAA (primary endpoint) was 
analysed using similar methods. In addition, the changes from before withdrawal to the 
withdrawal period were analysed using a RMANCOVA model. The group (drug withdrawal vs. 
continued treatment), visit, and the interaction between group and visit were included as fixed 
factors in the model. The value before withdrawal was included as a covariate. 
Sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoints was performed by using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model separately for each time point with different data imputation methods and in 
different subsets. Change from baseline to time points up to 60 months were evaluated for 
secondary endpoints with the same approach as for the primary endpoints.

Results 
Participant flow 
The disposition for all patients is illustrated below. 
Protocol deviations 
Disposition of patients 
In all, there were 30 major protocol violations in 26 patients: 1 patient signed the informed 
consent late, 9 patients were treated before baseline data was obtained, and in 20 patients, the 
maximum allowed anakinra dose, at that time, was exceeded. One patient started Kineret 
treatment one day before the informed consent was signed due to administrative delay in getting 
the IRB approved version uploaded. 
Treatment with anakinra had been started in 9 patients before their first visit to NIH and before 
the official removal of the exclusion criterion forbidding IL-1 antagonist treatment (the question 
related to the exclusion criterion was erroneously answered by 1 patient). Eight of these patient 
started treatment because their unstable condition required therapy before travelling to the NIH. 
Of the 9 patients, 7 were included in the study on their first visit to the NIH, and 2 were later 
transferred from other studies: one when the diagnosis was confirmed and one when the study 
focus changed to long-term outcome. None of these 9 patients had baseline data and were 
therefore not included in the primary efficacy evaluations. For 7 of the 9 patients, demographic 
and safety data and eligibility criteria were recorded within the first 4 months from treatment 
start. 
Recruitment 
In total, 43 patients were enrolled in the study and treated with anakinra. The first patient was 
enrolled on September 14, 2003, and, for the purpose of this report, the last patient on April 20, 
2010. Twenty-two patients completed 60 months of treatment (i.e. either passed the visit Month 
60 (N=17) or the duration of the treatment with Kineret was >60 months, although the Month 
60 visit is missing), 19 patients had not yet reached 60 months, and 2 patients discontinued the 
study prematurely due to noncompliance and withdrawal of consent.

Conduct of the study 
The focus of the study evolved over time. It was originally intended to determine whether 
oversecretion of IL-1 was the pivotal pathogenic mechanism in NOMID/CINCA, and whether 
blocking IL-1 would be an effective treatment strategy. Subsequently, the optimal dosing to 
control inflammation was to be determined. Through increasing knowledge about the product 
and disease mechanisms, the long-term objectives of the study changed to determine if Kineret 
could prevent the progression of pre-existing organ damage and even prevent the development 
of organ damage in young NOMID/CINCA patients. As a consequence, the study protocol was 
subject to a number of amendments, most importantly regarding the withdrawal phase, study 
duration, maximum dose, and age limit for inclusion. 
• 
In protocol version January 30, 2004, the study included a withdrawal phase, where, during 
a maximum period of 7 days, Kineret was withdrawn and clinical symptoms were recorded, 
as well as SAA, hsCRP, and ESR levels determined. 
•  However, because of the significance of the study drug treatment effects seen in the first 11 
patients and the severity of their flares upon withdrawal, the IRB at NIH agreed with the 
investigator’s recommendation to discontinue the withdrawal period thereafter. 
•  The study duration was originally limited to 12 months, but after determination of disease 
mechanisms involved in NOMID/CINCA and in order to assess the long-term benefits of 
treatment (as well as assuring availability of treatment for the patients), the study was 
extended to become open-ended. 
• 
Initially, maintenance doses up to 2 mg/kg were given, but with increasing knowledge of the 
large safety margin of Kineret treatment and the severity of the disease in some individuals, 
the study allowed for optimizing dosing, and, consequently, doses up to 10 mg/kg/day could 
be given. 
•  The age limit for inclusion in the study was initially 2 years of age. With increasing 
experience of the safety and efficacy of Kineret treatment, including growing evidence of the 
potential to prevent irreversible organ damage, the population was extended to include 
patients of all ages so as to treat patients from the earliest age. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
Of the 43 patients included in the safety population, 25 (58.1%) were females and 36 (83.7%) 
were white. Patient ages at treatment start ranged from 0.7 to 46.3 years, with an overall mean 
(SD) of 10.3 (10.4) years. Most patients were children (36 patients): 13 below 2 years, 18 
between 2 and 11 years, and 5 between 12 and 17 years. 
The ITT population, ITT diary population, and PK population were overall similar to the safety 
population with respect to demographic characteristics with the exception of the proportion of 
patients <2 years being somewhat lower in the ITT populations. In the PK population, there were 
no patients under the age of 4. 
In the Withdrawal population, age was slightly lower in the Treatment group than in the 
Withdrawal group, because patients <2 years were initially not allowed to enter the study.

All patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for NOMID/CINCA rash and CNS involvement. No CNS 
involvement was recorded for patient no. 2009, but there were signs of active CNS inflammation 
including ventriculomegaly on brain MRI and elevated intracranial pressure, measured as CSF 
opening pressure on lumbar puncture. 
Mutation in exon 3 of CIAS1 was present in 31 patients (72.1%), and the most common type 
was D303N.

Table 12 
Disease characteristics at baseline (Safety population) 
Diary symptom sum score (DSSS) at baseline 
Symptom severity at baseline was highest for rash followed by joint pain and headache. The 
proportion of days with at least mild symptom severity was 78.9% for rash, 51.3% for joint pain, 
and 37.3% for headache. The proportion of days with the highest severity score was below 15% 
for all key symptoms except rash, which had the highest score on 16.9% of the days. Proportion 
of days with fever was relatively low, and vomiting was the least common of the individual key 
symptoms. In addition to the 5 key symptoms, fatigue, hearing loss, eye redness, and difficulties 
ambulating were present on 40%-60% of the days during the baseline period. Calculations for 
the distribution of days with each severity (i.e. giving more weight to patients with data available 
from more days) showed similar results. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
At baseline, 16 of 34 patients (47.1%) in the ITT population were treated with oral steroids, 9 
(26.5%) with DMARDs (methotrexate), and 3 (8.8%) with acetazolamide. Use of steroid 
medication was also obtained from the patient diary. Different types of steroids recorded in the 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report

diary were converted into prednisone-equivalent doses to facilitate comparisons. The mean daily 
dose of oral steroids before treatment start in the ITT population was 0.35 mg/kg. 
Numbers analysed 
Five  analysis  sets  were  used.  The  population  size  for  each  analysis  set  was  as  follows:  43 
patients in the Safety population, 34 patients in the ITT population, 29 patients in the ITT diary 
population, 22 patients in the Withdrawal population, and 21 patients in the PK population. 
Safety population 
Analysis data sets 
All 43 enrolled patients provided data for the evaluation of AEs. Safety laboratory tests and vital 
signs data were available for 43 patients as well, but only 34 patients were included in the 
evaluation of change from baseline because of missing baseline values before treatment.. 
ITT population 
The ITT population comprised 34 patients; 9 patients were excluded because they started 
treatment with Kineret before the first visit in the study, i.e. no baseline data could be obtained. 
For individual outcome variables, additional patients have been excluded from the ITT analysis of 
that variable if baseline data was missing. Further, not all patients completed all visits, and 
because of this, the number of patients may vary at different time points. 
ITT diary population 
The ITT diary population included 29 patients; 5 patients were excluded from the ITT population 
because of missing complete baseline diary data for the 5 key symptoms. 
Withdrawal population 
The Withdrawal population comprised 22 patients, 11 in the Withdrawal group and 11 in the 
Treatment group. The Withdrawal group consisted of the first 11 patients enrolled in the study, 
who completed a period of treatment withdrawal for up to 7 days, when disease symptoms were 
evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the withdrawal period. Data from these patients

were compared with data from 11 patients who were enrolled after the withdrawal period had 
been removed from the protocol, the Treatment group, by selecting the time period 
corresponding to the withdrawal period. All patients who did not participate in the withdrawal 
period and who provided diary data at baseline, Month 3, and during the period corresponding to 
the withdrawal period (4-10 days after the visit at Month 3) were included in the Treatment 
group. 
PK population 
The  PK  population  included  21  patients,  in  whom  serum  samples  were  taken  for  PK  analysis  at 
least once. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Diary symptom sum score (DSSS) 
Analysis of the primary variable, change in DSSS after 3-6 months of administration of Kineret, 
showed significant improvement. The DSSS included the sum of the 5 key symptoms fever, rash, 
joint pain, vomiting, and headache. The estimated change in DSSS from baseline to Month 3-6 
was -3.5 (95% CI -3.7 to -3.2; p-value <0.0001), and this range of improvement was constant 
throughout the study. The immediate clinical response to Kineret treatment was reflected in a 
rapid decrease in DSSS, demonstrated in Figure 5 as change from baseline by day during the 
first month of treatment. Within 3 days of treatment initiation, the DSSS decreased from a mean 
(SEM) baseline value of 4.5 (0.6) to 0.8 (0.3). 
Figure 5 
Diary symptom sum score (DSSS) by day during the first month of 
Kineret treatment (ITT diary population) 
The decline in average DSSS was sustained throughout the long-term follow up, with a score 
equal to 0.7 or lower up to Month 60 (Figure below). The estimated changes from baseline were 
statistically significant also at all other visits. In addition to the DSSS (i.e. score ranging between 
0-20 which can be calculated only if all 5 key symptoms were assessed) the mean symptom 
score was evaluated (i.e. score ranging between 0-4, which is the average of all available key 
symptoms and can be calculated regardless of how many of the 5 key symptoms that were 
assessed). The mean symptom score results were consistent with the DSSS results.

All age groups showed comparable clinical improvement. Further subgroup analyses showed a 
comparable decrease in DSSS between female and male patients, between patients with and 
without CIAS1 mutation, and between patients diagnosed with NOMID/CINCA and those with 
borderline phenotypes between NOMID/CINCA and MWS. 
Individual Key and Secondary Symptoms 
There was a rapid and sustained decrease in diary symptom score from baseline to Month 60 for 
each individual key symptom, except for vomiting, which had a very low score already at study 
initiation.

There was also a rapid and sustained decrease in diary symptom score from baseline to Month 
60 for the secondary symptoms fatigue, eye redness, and sleep problems. 
The diary also included 2 fields for reporting hearing and vision loss. There were small changes in 
hearing that stabilized at Month 12, indicating a subjective improvement in hearing. More than 
50% of the patients recorded no symptoms at baseline, and this subgroup showed no worsening 
with time, but the subgroup with symptoms recorded at baseline improved in hearing from a 
mean of 
2.3 to 0.9 at Month 12. For vision, there were only very minor changes and no indications of 
worsening in the subgroup with no vision loss at baseline (21 of 27 patients). In the subgroup 
with vision loss present at baseline, there was a slight decrease in the self-perceived vision loss 
score from a mean value of 2.1 at baseline to 1.5 or lower at subsequent visits during the study.

DSSS before and at end of withdrawal period, and after reinstitution of 
therapy, to Month 6 (Withdrawal population) 
Both groups responded after initiation of treatment and had a similar DSSS at Month 3. In the 
Withdrawal group, the average DSSS increased from 0.6 to 5.2; estimated change 4.6 (95% CI 
3.8 to 5.4; p<0.0001) upon withdrawal of treatment, while the average DSSS remained on the 
same level in the Treatment group (from 0.5 to 0.6). The difference between the Withdrawal and 
Treatment groups in change from Month 3 (before withdrawal) to end of the withdrawal period 
was statistically significant, estimated difference between the groups being 4.5 points (95% CI 
3.3 to 5.6; p<0.0001) (Table 12). 
Treatment was then reinstituted for the Withdrawal group, and 3 months later (at Month 6) both 
groups had a similar average DSSS again (0.6 in the Withdrawal group and 0.4 in the Treatment 
group). No significant difference was seen between the groups in estimated change from Month 3 
(before withdrawal) to Month 6, i.e. after Kineret treatment had been restarted in the Withdrawal 
group; 0.0 points (95% CI -1.1 to 1.2; p=0.9422).

Table 15 
Estimated changes in DSSS from before to end of withdrawal period, and

Of the 11 patients in the Withdrawal group, 10 reached the criteria for disease flare as recorded 
by the clinical staff within the specified withdrawal period of maximum 7 days. The patient who 
did not fulfil the criteria had 6 days of rash, 3 days of joint pain and conjunctivitis, and one 
episode of fever. The median time until disease flare was 5.0 days (95% CI 2.5 to 6.0). The most 
frequent fulfilled criteria were rash and headache. 
Inflammatory markers: SAA, hsCRP, and ESR 
Change in SAA from baseline to 3-6 months was a variable directly related to the primary 
objective in the study protocol. hsCRP and ESR were secondary variables, but as they all reflect 
the inflammatory process and closely follow each other. 
Levels of SAA, hsCRP, and ESR were elevated before initiation of Kineret therapy. After 
treatment start, levels for all 3 decreased significantly from baseline. At Month 1, SAA had 
decreased from a median baseline value of 149 mg/L to 31 mg/L and median hsCRP from 51 
mg/L to 9 mg/L. After an additional 2 months (at Month 3) levels were even lower, 6 mg/L and 4 
mg/L, respectively, and sustained over time. There was a reduction in median ESR from 52 
mm/h at baseline to 13 mm/h at Month 1, a level that changed only slightly at subsequent visits. 
Very high levels of SAA and hsCRP occurred most frequently at baseline. At subsequent visits, 
high levels were less frequent and transient. Isolated elevations may have reflected occasional 
relapses in individual patients over the course of treatment, which can be seen with viral 
infections and stress. 
The estimated changes in SAA, hsCRP, and ESR levels from baseline were statistically significant 
at all visits (p<0.0001).

Data is shown only for the Withdrawal group, because the SAA, hsCRP, and ESR samples were 
not taken at a corresponding time at the end of the withdrawal period for the Treatment group. 
The evidence of disease flare during withdrawal of treatment, as reflected by significant changes 
in subjective symptom scoring, was also demonstrated as rapid changes in the inflammatory 
serum markers SAA (primary variable), hsCRP and ESR. 
In the 11 patients in the Withdrawal group, the median SAA value was 162 mg/L at baseline and 
decreased to 7 mg/L before the withdrawal period. At the end of the withdrawal period, SAA had 
increased to 310 mg/L (compared to before withdrawal p<0.0001). Restart of treatment resulted 
in a decrease at Month 6 to 6 mg/L (compared to before withdrawal p=0.8932). Sustained low 
levels of SAA were evident over time in the ITT population. 
There was a reduction in median hsCRP from 50 mg/L at baseline to 4 mg/L before the 
withdrawal, then an increase at the end of the withdrawal period to 72 mg/L (compared to before 
withdrawal p<0.0001). At Month 6 of treatment, median hsCRP had again decreased to 4 mg/L 
(compared to before withdrawal p=0.8519). 
Change in ESR showed a similar pattern with a median value at baseline of 69 mm/h and a 
decrease to 24 mm/h before withdrawal. At the end of the withdrawal period, ESR had increased 
to 69 mm/h (compared to before withdrawal p<0.0001). Restart of therapy resulted in a 
decrease at Month 6 to 27 mm/h (compared to before withdrawal p=0.5601). 
Secondary Efficacy Variables 
CNS evaluation 
Before Kineret treatment, all patients except 2 in the ITT population with evaluable LP had 
objective signs of aseptic meningitis. This was evident from results obtained at LP (adjusted 
cellularity and opening pressure). The patients with normal range values at LP had CNS

involvement in the form of leptomeningeal as well as cochlear enhancement at baseline MRI and 
papilledema.  
The majority of patients had LP done at baseline, Month 3-6, Month 12, and yearly thereafter. 
However, three patients had no LPs at baseline, and four patients only had limited data 
throughout the study. 
Intracranial pressure 
Intracranial opening pressure was measured with a normal value defined as less than 200 mm of 
water column. At baseline, the mean (SEM) value of 29 patients was 239 (15) mm. The mean 
value decreased to 212 (17) mm at Month 3 and further to 183 (13) mm at Month 36, and to 
179 (18) mm at Month 60. 
The estimated change from baseline to Month 3-6 was -52 mm (95% CI -76 to -28; p-value 
<0.001) and -83 mm (95% CI -123 to -43; p-value <0.001) at Month 60. 
CSF cellularity and chemistry 
CSF WBC-adjusted cellularity was assessed with a normal value defined as ≤5 cells/μL. Mean 
(SEM) WBC-adjusted cell count decreased from 27.9 (5.7) cells/μL at baseline to 11.0 (2.8) 
cells/μL at Month 3. There was an increase in mean at Month 12 compared to Month 6 due to 
one patient who was affected by a viral meningitis at that time point with an adjusted cellularity 
of 335/μL. The mean decreased to 5.7 (1.0) cells/μL at Month 36 and further to 3.5 (0.6) 
cells/μL at Month 60. 
The estimated change from baseline to Month 3-6 was -20.6 cells/μL (95% CI -32.9 to -8.3; p-
value=0.0013), -6.1 cells/μL (95% CI -19.6 to 7.5; p-value=0.3748) at Month 12, and -27.7 
cells/μL (95% CI -47.3 to -8.2; p-value=0.0061) at Month 60. 
Total protein, albumin, albumin quotient, and glucose in the CSF were also measured, and levels 
decreased similarly to adjusted cellularity. CSF glucose was stable over time.  
CSF-WBC adjusted cellularity and diary headache score. 
The mean (SEM) daily diary headache score (0-4 for increasing severity) rated 0.9 (0.2) at 
baseline. With initiation of therapy, it decreased rapidly and remained significantly reduced 
throughout the study with mean scores between 0.1 and 0.3 (p<0.0001 for all time points after 
baseline compared to baseline). The change in mean CSF WBC over time paralleled the decrease 
in the diary headache score. 
Brain MRI 
Ventriculomegaly was present in 10 of 23 patients (43.5%) at baseline, and an additional 2 
patients had shunts. As expected in these patients with long-standing disease, treatment had 
limited effect on this condition; a similar proportion of patients, 7 of 17 (41.2%), had 
ventriculomegaly at Month 60 as at baseline. One patient with ventriculomegaly present at 
baseline improved at Month 36. This was a patient who started treatment at the age of 0.8 years 
(patient no 2042). No patient with normal ventricular appearance at baseline developed 
ventriculomegaly during treatment. 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 50/93 
 
  
Leptomeningeal enhancement, which to a higher degree than ventriculomegaly reflects active 
CNS inflammation, was present in 10 of 25 patients (40.0%) at baseline and in 1 of 19 patients 
(5.3%) at Month 60. Eight patients with enhancement present at baseline improved at Month 36 
and 7 patients at Month 60. One patient worsened at Month 36, but normalized and had no sign 
of enhancement at Month 60. 
Cochlear enhancement 
Of the 20 patients (87.0%) with some degree of cochlear enhancement on the initial MRI worst 
ear, 11 of 20 patients (57.9%) had normalized at Month 3. Four additional patients improved by 
at least 1 grade, totaling in 15 improved patients (78.9% of those with some degree of cochlear 
enhancement present at baseline). At Month 36, 10 of 20 patients (50%) were free of cochlear 
enhancement in both ears and 9 of 19 patients (47.4%) at Month 60 (or last assessment after 
month 42). 
From diary data recording subjective hearing, the subgroup with symptoms at baseline improved 
in self-perceived hearing from a mean score of 2.3 to 0.9 at Month 12. By objective measures, 
this is reflected as small improvements in air conduction ePTA score for best ear compared to 
baseline early in treatment.  
Patients ≥12 years had more severe hearing impairment than patients <12 years. The older 
patients in general stabilized without progressive worsening, but typically did not improve. 
Patients with normal hearing or limited ePTA abnormalities were younger at baseline and did not 
deteriorate with treatment over time. 
Ophthalmology 
Patients underwent full ophthalmologic examinations including visual acuity (presented as 
logMAR), visual field and dilated eye examinations. Seventeen patients with visual data from 
both eyes at each visit were included in the analysis; all had baseline data for assessment of 
visual acuity, papilledema, and uveitis, but only 5 patients performed the visual field examination 
at baseline. 
Inflammatory eye manifestations also included uveitis and papilledema. Uveitis was present 
(assessed from “trace” to score “3”) at baseline or had occurred historically in 8/17 patients. 
During the study, none of these patients experienced any new events. One patient with no 
previous uveitis reported 2 events as AEs after 8 and 10 months of treatment; the inflammation 
resolved. Up to Month 60, there had been no other AE reports of uveitis in the study population. 
Papilledema score (with 0 as best outcome and 4 as worst) improved significantly during the 
study with an estimated change from baseline to Month 36 of -0.88 (95% CI -1.06 to -0.70; p-
value <0.0001) in the best eye and -1.05 (95% CI -1.20 to -0.89; p-value <0.0001) in the worst 
eye. The improvement was sustained at the Month 60 visit. 
Dermatology 
Thirty patients had baseline dermatology data. Mean (SEM) percentage of the body surface area 
affected with rash was 10.5 (2.3)% at baseline with a decrease to 3.6 (2.4)% at Month 3. At 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 51/93 
 
  
 
 
Month 6 and thereafter, it was 0%. A VAS was used for an overall assessment of skin color, not 
concentrated to the rash area, but an assessment over the whole body surface, Skin color was 
scored from zero (normal skin) to 100 (reddest possible skin). Mean (SEM) value at baseline was 
37.7 (4.5) with a decrease to 7.6 (3.3) at Month 3 and a further reduction to below 1 at Month 
36. 
Table   19 
Estimated changes in body surface area of rash and VAS from baseline 
(ITT population) 
Joint count 
Mean (SEM) number of swollen joints decreased from a baseline mean of 7.8 (1.9) to 0 at Month 
60, and number of joints with pain on motion decreased from 5.2 (1.6) to 0.4 (0.2) during the 
same period. The corresponding figures for joints with loss of motion were 8.6 (1.9) to 0.6 (0.3). 
The decrease in the number of affected joints was seen within the first 12 months of treatment 
and remained stable up to Month 60. 
Table 20 
Estimated changes in total number of swollen joints and joints with loss 
of motion from baseline (ITT population) 
Concomitant therapy 
Use of DMARDs remained on the same level throughout the study, 26.5% (9 of 34 patients) at 
baseline to 20.0% at Month 60, while use of acetazolamide increased from 8.8% at baseline to 
53.3% at Month 60. 
Use of steroid medication was also obtained from the patient diary. Among patients with baseline 
diary data, 13 patients were on glucocorticoid treatment, while 15 patients were steroid free. 
None of the latter started glucocorticoid treatment during the study. The mean (SEM) 
prednisone-equivalent dose of these patients were 0.76 (0.31) mg/kg at baseline, but a prompt

tapering of their doses during the first 3 months were seen. At 12 months, 10 of these 13 
patients were still on glucocorticoid medication, but at considerably lower doses. At Month 36 
and Month 60, there was a further decline in the number of patients with concomitant 
glucocorticoid treatment, all with lower doses than at baseline. 
Table 21 
Diary data on glucocorticoid treatment (ITT population) 
Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) 
CHAQ scoring ranged from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty or not applicable and 3=unable to do, i.e. 
higher scores indicated more severe impairment. A clinically relevant change was defined as a 
change in score of 0.125. 
Table 22 
Estimated changes in CHAQ from baseline in overall pain and 
parent/patient global rating (ITT population) 
Start and maintenance dose 
Initially the patients were started on 1 mg/kg. Over time the starting dose was increased and 
patients enrolled later in the study were started also at higher doses. Throughout the study, the 
starting dose for treatment ranged from 1.0 to 2.4 mg/kg. The number of patients in the 1 
mg/kg dose class (defined as 0.5 to <1.5 mg/kg doses) and in the 2 mg/kg dose class (1.5 to 
<2.5 mg/kg) were 26 and 17, respectively. 
Following initiation of therapy, the clinical response was evaluated intermittently and the dose 
was either maintained or adjusted. For a patient with inadequate clinical response, the Kineret 
dose could be increased by 0.5 to 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day according to the 
study protocol. The dose range recorded for the safety population at the study visits was 0.9 to 
7.6 mg/kg/day. The highest dose was maintained for 15 months. Dosing was performed per 
mg/kg body weight, and the dose in mg was accordingly adjusted based on changes in body 
weight. The median dose after 5 years of treatment was similar for those aged <2 years and for 
those ≥18 years and ranged from 2.8 -3.6 mg/kg/day (overall median 3.1 mg/kg/day).

The median start dose in the study population was 1.4 mg/kg. Due to dose adjustments in order 
to achieve the specified treatment objectives, the dose for the patients at the end of the study 
was higher but levelled off to 3.2, 3.6, and 3.2 mg/kg/day after 48, 54, and 60 months, 
respectively.

Supportive studies 
Lepore et al (J Pediatr 2010)- Follow-up and quality of life of patients with cryopyrin-associated 
periodic syndromes treated with anakinra. 
- Methods 
The investigation was a prospective open-label long-term follow-up (12 to 54 months) study of 
QoL in severely affected CAPS patients (NOMID/CINCA and MWS) treated with Kineret. The study 
also included a non-randomized parallel cohort with surveillance of untreated patients. Both 
treated (n = 14) and untreated patients (n = 5) were assessed every 4 to 6 months. One 
additional patient was enrolled in the registry but never completed the study. Ophthalmologic 
evaluation and audiometry were performed every 6 months. CNS and/or bone  
imaging was performed according to patient’s clinical needs. Hematological and biochemical  
profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), ESR, and SAA were obtained at baseline and during control  
visits. In addition, the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQPF50) was used to assess the QoL in both 
treated and untreated patients. An international sample of 3315 healthy children (52.2% 
female), with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 11.2 (3.8) years, constituted the healthy 
control group

- Patient characteristics 
Fifteen of the 20 patients included had a phenotype consistent with NOMID/CINCA, whereas 5 
patients had a milder phenotype consistent with MWS. Fourteen of the patients were treated with 
Kineret, 5 were untreated controls and 1 patient was not evaluated. The mean (SD) age of the 
19 prospectively followed patients was 12.4 (10.9) at enrolment. Nine were males and 10 
females with 14 patients still in the paediatric age group. The mean age of treated (14 patients) 
and untreated (5 patients) MWS and NOMID/CINCA patients were 13.9 (12.2) and 8.1 (3.7), 
respectively. Most of the patients had disease onset during the first weeks of life. Thirteen 
patients (68%) carried mutations of the CIAS1 gene. At baseline, almost all patients had 
elevated acute phase reactants and experienced rash, headache and arthralgia.  
- Dosage 
The starting dose of Kineret was 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 100 mg). In 5 patients, the dose was  
increased during follow-up, up to 3 mg/kg/day. The major causes for dose increments were the  
finding of an isolated elevation of acute phase reactants and/or the persistence of papilledema on  
ophthalmologic evaluation in the absence of other disease-associated clinical manifestations. 
- Efficacy results 
Treated patients 
All treated patients demonstrated an immediate clinical benefit of Kineret, with rash, fever, and 
joint affection resolving within a few days. A prompt and persistent normalization of 
inflammatory markers, including SAA, and haematological measures was achieved.  
The frequency of headache episodes decreased significantly upon treatment and completely 
resolved during the follow-up period.  
Papilledema was completely resolved in 3 of 7 treated patients who had papilledema present at  
baseline. In 4 patients partial papilledema still persisted despite an increase in Kineret dosage.  
No treated patients had a worsening of their hearing loss during follow-up; 1 patient displayed a 
slight improvement of the audiogram after treatment with Kineret.  None of the treated patients 
developed new organ manifestations related to the disease during the follow-up period.  
There was no difference in the long-term pattern of response to treatment between 
CIAS1/NALP3-mutated and non-mutated patients observed.  
The CHQ-PF50 questionnaire is a self-administered instrument designed to capture the physical,  
emotional, and social components of health status of children 5-18 years of age and comprises 
15 health concepts. In addition, there are 2 summary measures based on US normative 
standard:  
the physical summary score (PhS) and the psychosocial summary score (PsS). These summary  
measures were used at baseline and at the last follow-up visit. They are standardized to have a  
mean of 50 and SD of 10. An international sample of 3315 healthy children constituted a healthy  
control group (Oliveira et al 2007). Patients with both NOMID and MWS showed significantly  
lower values for both PhS (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) and PsS (p < 0.01) compared  
with healthy control subjects at baseline. Treatment was associated with a dramatic amelioration 
of negative aspects related to the QoL, with the greatest improvement in the physical (PhS)

summary median score (SD) increasing from a pre-treatment value of 38 (11.8) to 52.2 (4.5) 
post treatment (p < 0.001). Thus, an almost complete normalization of most of the items 
concerning PhS activities was observed, but with less impact on the psychological domains.  
No treatment control patients 
Five patients with CAPS who did not receive Kineret therapy were prospectively followed. Of 
these, 4 patients were diagnosed with NOMID/CINCA with a severe CAPS phenotype, while  
one was a MWS patient with a milder phenotype. The mean follow-up period of the 5 untreated 
patients was 45 months (range 19 to 52 months). The patients’ ages at enrolment were 3 to 
12.1 years (Mean (SD) 8.1 (3.7)). The 4 severly affected no-treatment concurrent control 
patients had a stable and long-lasting disease course, with daily rash, headaches, and recurrent 
episodes of arthralgia. All patients displayed chronic elevation of acute phase reactants, including 
SAA levels, with mild to moderate microcytic anemia. These clinical manifestations were partially 
controlled by the use of NSAIDs. Three of the patients had persisting papilledema at the last 
follow-up. One patient developed moderate neurosensory hearing loss, and in 2 patients a 
worsening of this complication was noted.

the study were to describe a cohort of patients with a severe disease course, and to describe the 
short-term efficacy of Kineret treatment (after 2 weeks) and the long-term response, as well as 
the safety of Kineret therapy in MWS patients.  
The primary study outcome was the response in MWS-disease activity score (DAS) after 2 weeks 
of treatment. The MWS-DAS captures active disease in terms of: fever, headache, eye 
involvement, hearing impairment, oral ulcers, abdominal pain, renal disease, musculoskeletal 
disease, and rash, and also includes the patient’s global assessment score. A good response was 
defined as controlled MWS disease activity with an MWS-DAS <10 at 2 weeks.  
The following efficacy secondary outcomes were also assessed:  
• 
• 
• 
Long-term  efficacy  in  all  single domains of  the  MWS-DAS  and  the  total  MWS-DAS  score 
at last follow-up  
Patient- and physician-derived global measures of disease activity and overall health at 2 
weeks and last follow-up  
Inflammatory markers at 2 weeks and at last follow-up  
•  Organ  specific  disease  assessments  included  renal  function  and  amyloidosis,  repeat 
audiology examinations, CNS and inner ear MRI, and ophtalmological evaluations.  
- Patient characteristics 
Twelve patients (3 males and 9 females) were included; 5 (42%) were pediatric patients (median  
age 6.4 years, range 3.0-15.3 years), and 7 were adults (median age 39.0 years, range 20.6-

66.9 years). The majority of patients had elevated levels of markers of inflammation at baseline: 
ESR elevation was reported for 9 patients (75%), and the CRP was raised in 11 (92%). High 
serum levels of SAA were seen in 11 of the 12 patients (92%). Severe fatigue was reported for 
all patients before treatment. The most common organ system features were musculoskeletal 
and ocular manifestations: Arthralgia were present in all 12 of the patients (100%), arthritis in 8 
(67%), and myalgia in 6 patient (50%). Ocular symptoms were seen in 12 patients (100%), with 
conjunctivitis in 11 (92%) as most common. At baseline, hearing loss was present in 10 patients 
(83%). Recurrent episodes of headache and oral ulcers were found in 10 patients (83%).  
- Dosage 
The Kineret doses were 1-2 mg/kg/day in patients with a body weight <40 kg and 100 mg for 
patients with a body weight ≥40 kg (corresponding to 1-2.5 g/kg/day up to 100 kg body weight). 
The product was self-administered by s.c. injection once daily. In children with persistent disease 
activity, the Kineret dose was raised stepwise to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/day. Concurrent NSAID 
medication was added if required.  
- Overall disease activity 
Disease activity was significantly lower in all patients at 2 weeks compared to baseline 
(p=0.0005). MWS organ manifestations improved, as did all patient-derived measures of health 
and inflammatory markers. In total 92% of the patients had a sustained disease control 
throughout treatment with a MWS-DAS <10, with a mean score of 3.9. Two children aged 3.0 
and 6.4 years required Kineret dose adjustment in order to maintain disease control. The dose 
had to be stepwise increased to 8 mg/kg/day. Both were carrying the V198M mutation.  
- Disease activity in MWS-DAS domains 
Musculoskeletal manifestations disappeared in all patients after 2 weeks of treatment, and 
remained well controlled at last visit in 9 out of 12 patients. Ocular symptoms were present in 4 
of 12 individuals at last follow-up. Skin manifestations flared in one patient, who had been 
previously inactive. Sustained disease control was seen for headache, oral ulcers, and renal 
disease including proteinuria and hematuria. There was an increase in the number of patients 
reporting a resolution of abdominal pain. All but one patient remained afebrile at last follow-up. 
- Inflammatory markers 
SAA levels had normalized in all patients at the primary endpoint visit at 2 weeks while CRP was 
completely normalized in 5/11 patients with baseline elevations. CRP levels further improved 
compared to the 2 week endpoint and normalized in the majority of patients. Haematological 
abnormalities completely resolved in all patients. Mean SAA levels further decreased from 27.5 to 
6.6 mg/L. 
- Global assessments of health 
All global measures of health improved during treatment: The patient global assessment score of  
overall disease activity decreased from 6.3 at at baseline to 2.5 at last follow-up (0 represents no  
disease activity and 10 represents maximum disease activity). The patient mood score also 
decreased from 2.2 to 1.4 (1 represents excellent mood and 3 represents the lowest mood 
possible). The patient performance score increased from 5.9 at baseline to 8.2 at last follow-up 
(0 represents inability to perform and 10 represents the best possible performance level). The 
Kineret (anakinra)

physician global assessment score confirmed stable disease control. All patients’ measures were 
statistically significant. 
- Long-term effects 
MWS sequelae  
Amyloidosis, which was confirmed by kidney biopsy in 2 patients at baseline, resolved in one  
and improved in the other as documented by repeat scans. Delayed puberty, in one patient, had  
resolved at last follow-up. Sensorineural hearing loss was documented in 10 of 12 patients at  
baseline and had improved in 2 of the patients at last follow-up, with complete resolution in one.  
In the second individual, initial hearing impairment was the most severe (grade 4) at baseline,  
whereas subsequent testing after Kineret treatment revealed only grade 3 impairment. Hearing  
loss became worse during Kineret treatment in 2 patients: from grade 1 to grade 2 in one and  
from grade 2 to grade 3 in the other. In the remaining 6 patients reporting hearing loss at  
baseline, hearing remained stable.  
Hawkins et al (Arthritis Rheum 2004) - Spectrum of clinical features in Muckle-Wells Syndrome 
and response to anakinra  
- Methods 
This report was the first clinical evidence for the fundamental role of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of 
inflammation associated with CAPS, and the efficacy of Il-1 inhibition in these patients. The trial 
was based on the evolving knowledge on the NALP3 (often mutated in CAPS) inflammasome 
protein complex activation leading to an increased IL-1 production, and the reporting of the 
spontaneous up-regulation of IL-1 production in unstimulated monocytes obtained from a patient 
with NOMID/ CINCA syndrome. The clinical features of 3 members of a family, all of whom had 
MWS associated with a NALP3 mutation, were evaluated at baseline and following initiation of 
Kineret treatment. The results of three months of treatment were reported. The response of 
these patients inflammatory disease to treatment were assessed through diaries of symptoms, 
and clinical and laboratory assessments including measurement of SAA and CRP concentrations.  
- Patient characteristics 
Three patients diagnosed with MWS with overlapping features of MWS, FCAS and NOMID/CINCA 
participated in the study. The patients were a 42 years old female (mother), a 15 years old 
female (daughter) and a 22 years old male (son). During the year prior to treatment, the median 
SAA (CRP) concentrations in the mother, son, and daughter were 141 mg/l (58 mg/l), 161 mg/l 
(89 mg/l), and 148 mg/l (42 mg/l), respectively (normal concentration <10 mg/l for both SAA 
and CRP). The predominant clinical features in the 3 patients were rashes, arthralgia, fever, 
severe fatigue, and deafness.  
- Dosage 
An initial dose of 100 mg/day was reduced to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks as a result of the 
satisfactory treatment response. The patients were treated for 12 weeks.

- Efficacy results 
All 3 patients had typical clinical and serologic evidence of active inflammatory disease including 
rash, conjunctivitis, neutrophilia and intense acute-phase response, SAA and CRP.  All overt 
clinical features associated with active inflammation ceased within 4 hours of first dose of 
Kineret, including complete resolution of rash, and CRP and SAA had normalized at day 7. After 
start of therapy, all patients remained free of rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. Furthermore, 
they tolerated exposure to cold ambient temperature without development of any symptoms. 
Hoffman et al (Lancet 2004) - Prevention of cold-associated acute inflammation in familial cold 
autoinflammatory syndrome by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist  
- Methods 
In this study an experimental cold challenge protocol was developed to study the acute 
inflammatory mechanisms occurring after a general cold exposure in FCAS patients and to 
investigate the effects of IL-1 inhibition by pretreatment with Kineret. Four participants with 
FCAS and three healthy controls were exposed for 45 min to a room with an ambient 
temperature of 4°C. Symptom ratings and physical examinations, blood samples, skin by biopsy 
and assessments of affected skin surface area, and urine were obtained before cold challenge 
and repeatedly after the cold challenge. Six to 12 months after the initial non-treated challenge a 
therapeutic trial with the same protocol was performed, but with Kineret 100 mg administered 24 
h and 1 h before the cold challenge.  
- Patient characteristics 
The study included 4 FCAS patients (3 females and 1 male, aged 49 to74 years) and 3 controls 
(all males, aged 49 to74 years). During a first phase of the study the patients and controls were 
exposed to a cold challenge and followed for 18 hours. In the second phase, the FCAS patients 
returned after 6-12 months for pretreatment with Kineret 100 mg, followed by a cold challenge.  
- Dosage 
100 mg at 24 and 1 hour prior to cold challenge.  
- Efficacy results 
After the cold challenge without pre-treatment, the patients developed low-grade fever beginning 
2 hours after the challenge, peaking at about 8 hours and abating by the next morning.  
Evidence of rash began 1 hour after cold challenge and joint pain after 2 hours; both symptoms 
peaking at 8 hours. There was some evidence of mild general hand swelling and non-articular 
tenderness in 2 of the FCAS patients about 8 hours after the cold challenge. One patient 
developed acute painful bilateral conjunctivitis 8 hours after the cold challenge. WBC count and 
IL-6 levels increased within 1 hour of cold challenge, peaked at 8 and 4 hours, respectively, and 
returned to baseline by the next morning. After cold challenge with pre-treatment, neither 
controls nor IL-1Ra treated FCAS patients developed fever. The 3 FCAS patients treated with IL-
1Ra before cold challenge did not develop any of the signs or symptoms that developed during 
the first part despite the same exposure and similar baseline degree of inflammation. Patients 
developed their usual mild evening rash after the initial dose of IL-1Ra, but had no symptoms at 
Kineret (anakinra)

all after the second dose and remained symptom free for 24-48 hours. After that, the regular 
cold-induced symptoms and daily rash returned. There was no significant change in total WBC 
counts or in serum IL-6 induced by the cold challenge in IL-1Ra treated FCAS patients.  
Ross et al ( J Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery 2008) - Use of anakinra (Kineret) in the treatment 
of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome with a 16-month follow-up  
- Methods 
Eight adult family members with FCAS received Kineret 100 mg daily for 4 weeks. 7 of the 
patients were severely affected, implicating daily disabling symptoms. Treatment was preceded 
and followed by 2 weeks of no-treatment control periods. Assessments included repeat 
laboratory testing of CRP and SAA and physical examinations, and daily diaries capturing cold 
exposure and symptomatology. Symptoms were graded on a 5- point scale relating to skin, 
musculoskeletal, and eye symptoms, the presence of fever or chills, and general indicators of 
well-being. Also in this study an experimental cold challenge protocol was employed, and 
performed at baseline, during treatment with Kineret, and at a final occasion 2 weeks after the 
last Kineret administration. A Dermatology Life Quality Investigation (DLQI) assessment was 
performed, and a long-term assessment of treatment efficacy was done at 4 and 16 months of 
follow-up in patients continuing treatment.  
- Patient characteristics 
This study included 8 adult CAPS patients (6 females and 2 males) aged 29-77 years within the 
more severe spectrum of FCAS in all but one. The patients were seen over an 8-week period, 
which included 2 weeks pretreatment, 4 weeks of treatment with Kineret and 2 final weeks 
without medication. In all periods, the patients were exposed to a cold challenge. In addition, a 
long-term evaluation in continuously treated patients (n=5) was performed by use of a  
questionnaire at 4 and 16 months after the study. 
- Dosage 
Four weeks treatment with Kineret, 100 mg SC daily.  
- Efficacy results 
All  patients  reported  severe  signs  and  symptoms  (relating  to  skin  changes,  musculoskeletal 
symptoms,  eye  problems,  fever  or  chills,  and  general  indicators  of  well-being)  during  the  initial 
2-week  non-treatment  period,  with  the  exception  of  the  patient  aged  77  years.  In  all  patients, 
signs  and  symptoms  of  FCAS  resolved  within  24  hours  of  the  first  injection  of  Kineret  and  all 
remained  free  of  symptoms  throughout  the  4  weeks  of  treatment.  The  symptoms  relapsed 
completely in all patients but one within 36 hours of ceasing Kineret treatment. In the pre- and 
post-treatment  periods,  all  of  the  patients  developed  typical  chills  and  characteristic  discomfort 
within  1  hour  of  exposure  to  the  cold  room.  In  contrast,  all  remained  completely  free  of 
symptoms and signs of FCAS on similar cold challenge during the treatment period.  
The reduction in CRP during treatment was significant (mean change -14.38; 95% CI -7.35 to - 
21.42;  p≤0.0001)  and  was  followed  by  a  significant  increase  in  CRP  after  treatment  (mean 
change -15.19; 95% CI 4.88 to 25.50; p=0.0013). Similar results were observed for SAA.

The  subjective  experience  of  skin  manifestations  was  assessed  using  the  Dermatology  Life 
Quality Investigation (DLQI). During treatment, there was a significant improvement in DLQI  
score, with a mean reduction of -16.75 (95% CI -26.95 to -6.51, p= 0.004), followed by a  
significant increase when treatment was withdrawn (mean change 20.88, 95% CI 9.43 to 31.32,  
p=0.0019).  At  4  and  16  months  after  the  study,  the  long-term  experience  among  continuously 
treated  patients  was  assessed  using  a  questionnaire.  All  patients  remained  satisfied  with  the 
efficacy of the treatment.  
Neven et al (Arthritis Rheum 2010) - Long-term efficacy of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 
anakinra in ten patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease/chronic infantile 
neurologic cutaneous articular syndrome.  
- Methods 
This study retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of Kineret in 10 patients with 
NOMID/CINCA. This analysis was the first evaluation of the long-term effects of Kineret 
treatment in severely affected CAPS patients, with a follow-up of 26 to 42 months. The frequency 
and severity of clinical symptoms (including rash, fever, arthralgia or arthritis, and headache) 
were recorded before treatment and during follow-up. Inflammatory biologic markers included 
SAA, CRP and ESR and were measured regularly. In subsets of patients, audiography, vision, CSF 
examination (protein level, cell counts), and tests of cognitive function (intelligence quotient 
[IQ], Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for 
Children) were performed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (including fluid-attenuated 
inversion recovery [FLAIR] imaging and contrast injection) was performed before and after 
treatment in most patients with the results retrospectively reviewed by the same experienced 
radiologist. 
- Patient characteristics 
Eight of the 10 patients were paediatric, including two infants (3 and 4 months, respectively). 
The mean (SD) age was 10.9 (7.3) years (range 0.25 to 19.8 years) at treatment initiation. All 
patients exhibited symptoms from the first days of life, and all except the two infants had 
previous treatment attempts with steroids, NSAIDS, and various DMARDS. 9/10 patients carried 
mutations of the CIAS1gene. Clinical CNS involvement and aseptic meningitis were present in all 
patients. Five patients exhibited developmental retardation, with IQ scores between 50 and 70. 
Brain MRI (with FLAIR imaging and contrast injection) performed before treatment in all except 1 
patient showed abnormalities. Median CRP concentration, ESR, and SAA concentration before the 
start of treatment was 69 mg/L (range 26-110), 62 mm/hour (range 14-120), and 150 mg/L 
(48-386), respectively. Neutrophilia was also observed in all patients.  
- Dosage 
In all patients, Kineret treatment was initiated at 1 mg/kg/day, which was gradually increased to 
2 to 3 mg/kg/day in 6 of the 8 older patients. In the 2 infant patients, dose increments up to 6 
and 10 mg/kg were used.

- Efficacy results 
The 8 non-infant patients displayed a rapid clinical response to Kineret, with complete remission  
of rash, fever, arthralgia, and myalgia within 24 hours of treatment initiation. In the 2 infants,  
symptoms improved with Kineret at 1 mg/kg/day but with reappearing disease manifestations 
the dose was increased up to 6 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. Inflammation 
marker levels also significantly and persistently improved after adjustment of the Kineret dosage.  
The high levels of CRP, ESR and SAA observed at baseline were significantly reduced after one 
month treatment. All of the 8 non-infant patients exhibited CNS involvement at baseline, with 
headache (7/8), papilledema (7/8) and/or abnormalities found on CSF examination (8/8). After 6 
months of treatment, headaches were completely resolved in 3 patients and were decreased in 
frequency and severity in the remaining 4. Papilledema normalized in 3 patients and improved in 
the other 4 patients. CSF investigations were repeated in 6 patients; CSF white blood cells 
significantly decreased in all of these 6 patients compared to baseline. Protein levels decreased 
but not significantly. One patient exhibited complete normalization of all CSF parameters.  
In 5 patients with relapsing headaches and/or papilledema after 1 year of treatment, the Kineret  
dose was gradually increased to 3 mg/kg/day. These CNS symptoms resolved except for episodic  
headache in 1 patient. The CSF parameters normalized in 1 patient, improved in 2 patients and  
remained stable in 2 patients. A re-evaluation of mental retardation at the last follow-up showed  
no improvement.  
Cerebral MRI was reassessed 2 to 3 years after treatment initiation in 4 patients. Small vessel 
enhancement after contrast injection at baseline improved, as did periventricular white matter 
anomalies initially present in two of the patients.  
Seven of the 8 non-infant patients reported hearing loss at baseline. Six months after start of 
treatment, 2 of the patients exhibited a 15-dB improvement on audiology assessment that 
remained stable up to the last follow-up. In 4 patients, hearing remained stable. Visual acuity 
remained unchanged in all patients. The visual field defects present in 4 patients at baseline 
normalized in all 4, together with resolution of papilledema. None of the two infants had 
neurosensory involvement at baseline, or during follow-up.  
The two infants displayed irritability at baseline which rapidly improved with treatment. No 
papilledema developed during follow-up. Both patients exhibited a rapid improvement in CSF 
parameters within 3 months of treatment and complete normalization after 12 months. One of 
these younger patients developed a mild developmental retardation.  
Two patients had signs of amyloidosis at baseline. Of these, one had an abnormal filtration rate  
which did not improve during 38 months of Kineret treatment, although the SAA normalized 
within 6 months, however, no proteinuria developed. In the other patient, proteinuria present at 
baseline gradually improved and normalized.

Leslie et al (Arch Dermatol 2006) - Phenotype, genotype and sustained response to anakinra in 
22 patients with autoinflammatory disease associated with CIAS-1/NALP3 mutations.  
- Methods 
This was a retrospective review of medical records in a cohort of 22 patients with CAPS of 
varying clinical severity, spanning from FCAS to NOMID/CINCA phenotypes, in all cases 
associated with NALP-3 mutations. Two of the 22 patients were paediatric. Fifteen patients 
received long-term therapy with Kineret. Besides the characterization of clinical features and 
routine laboratory parameters, SAA and CRP were measured monthly, and the development of 
AA amyloidosis was investigated through renal biopsies and SAP scintigraphy in selected cases, 
which was repeated during long-term treatment follow-up.  
- Patient characteristics 
Twenty-two patients were included in the review, whereof 15 were treated with Kineret.  The 
phenotype of these patients varied: MWS in 11 patients, NOMID/CINCA in 2 patients and  
FCAS in 2 patients. Two paediatric patients were included; all others were >18 years of age. Of 7 
patients not receiving Kineret treatment, 2 died before therapy was available, 2 had mild disease 
and declined therapy, and 3 received other (experimental) therapies. Highly elevated 
inflammatory markers were present at baseline. At baseline almost all (20 out of 22) patients 
were symptom free in the morning but developed progressive rash, fever, and arthralgia in the 
late afternoon to evening, accompanied by severe lethargy. Nineteen patients reported frequent 
diffuse flulike limb aches, which sometimes localized to joints. Knees and ankles were most 
commonly affected. Twenty-one patients experienced frequent conjunctivitis before treatment. 
Sensorineural deafness was present in 13/22 patients and was associated with all NALP3 variants  
except A439V. Hearing impairment was progressive and began in childhood or early  
adolescence; audiograms generally demonstrated hightone loss, and 8 patients used hearing 
aids.  
- Dosage 
All 15 patients treated with Kineret started on 100 mg/day. The dosage was then progressively 
reduced based on clinical response to 20 to 50 mg/day in all adults. The 2 children maintained 
the 100 mg/day dosage. The median treatment period was 17.7 months (range 1-39.1 months). 
- Efficacy results 
All Kineret treated patients had complete remission from rash, fever, conjunctivitis and 
rheumatic aches within 12 hours after starting Kineret (in 6 patients within 4 hours). The SAA 
and CRP levels were normalized from 99.5 and 41 mg/L at baseline to 5 mg/L and 2 mg/L, 
respectively, within 1 week. The treatment effects were sustained throughout the treatment 
period. Clinical disease recrudesced within 36 to 48 hours of Kineret injections in 5 patients who 
briefly stopped treatment, demonstrating the necessity of daily maintenance therapy. Nephrotic 
syndrome remitted within 8 to 33 months in 3 patients who had AA amyloidosis, associated with 
regression of amyloid on serial SAP scintigraphy. Data on urinary protein leak demonstrated 
substantial improvement. The fourth treated patient with amyloidosis began taking Kineret 18 
months after undergoing renal transplantation; SAP scintigraphy showed regression of amyloid 
from his spleen and no involvement of the graft.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 03-AR-0298 
The pivotal efficacy study is prospective, open-label, and includes a withdrawal phase, with the 
objective of determining the effects of anakinra in controlling the inflammatory manifestations in 
paediatric and adult patients with NOMID/CINCA, the most severe form of CAPS The study is 
ongoing and has an open ended follow-up period. The data cut-off date is 16 August 2010. 
This long-term outcome study investigated the efficacy (PK and safety) of anakinra treatment up 
to 60 months in paediatric and adult patients with CAPS. The study initially was planned as a 
“proof of concept” trial to illustrate the effect of IL-1 blockade in NOMID and MWS patients. 
When anakinra proved efficacious in this patient group the focus changed to results of long-term 
treatment and prevention of future organ damage. Several amendments were added during the 
years resulting in a trial with a limited methodological design. No dose finding studies were 
conducted. The maximum dose per day was increased from 1-2 mg/kg (2003) to 3 mg/kg 
(2004), 5 mg/kg (2007), and 10 mg/kg (2010). The withdrawal period was reduced from 3 
month to 7 days – and there was no blinding of the withdrawal arm. Instead the first 11 patients 
included comprised the withdrawal group. As the age limit was also changed to include children 
<2yrs (June 2007) the withdrawal patients are probably not fully representative of the whole 
studied group. In an amendment in March 2007 patients were included who had participated in 
other clinical trials at NIH. Nine patients had received anakinra before baseline data was 
recorded and were thus excluded from the ITT population. Although the principle of “last 
observation carried forward” was used, the overall quality of the study remains limited and the 
final conclusions are inevitably impacted. However, the CHMP acknowledged that the study is 
performed on patients suffering from an extremely rare condition and therefore obvious inherent 
recruitment problems have impacted the conduct of the trial.  
Initial literature reports, e.g. Hawkins et al 2003, of the safe and effective use of anakinra 
throughout the severity spectrum of all CAPS phenotypes were subsequently followed by 
successful open label studies and numerous case reports published in the literature. As a result, 
the CHMP acknowledged the ethical concerns in conducting a randomized placebo controlled 
trials in CAPS due to the immediate and pronounced clinical response (shown following the 
withdrawal and subsequent reinstitution of the product) (Ross et al 2008, Goldbach-Mansky et al 
2006), and the clear lack of placebo response in trials with other IL-1 inhibitors (Hoffman et al 
2009, Lachmann et al 2009). The collection of the three syndromes FCAS, MWS, and 
NOMID/CINCA under the common syndrome CAPS is justified on the basis of a continuum of 
increasing severity of inflammatory phenotype with an identical pathogenetic background, and 
the response to IL-1 blocking therapies. 
Validated outcome measures for CAPS do not exist. The endpoints chosen in study 03-AR-0298 
correspond well to recently agreed standards for assessment of patients with autoinflammatory 
disease (Piram et al 2010). In addition to assessment of daily symptoms and acute phase 
reactants, the importance of assessing long-term disease impact and corresponding therapeutic 
efficacy, including quality of life and effects on disease-specific organ inflammation in the 
evaluation is acknowledged by the CHMP.

Supportive studies 
In support of the efficacy of anakinra treatment throughout all CAPS subtypes and in adult and 
pediatric patients, data from published prospective and retrospective studies were provided. 
These are open-label long-term studies with organ function outcome measures and QoL 
assessments in severely affected CAPS patients (NOMID/CINCA and MWS). Trials of treatment in 
FCAS patients, and the prevention of cold-induced disease flares with Kineret, were also 
included. The selected endpoints in these studies comply with current recognised assessment 
methods for the indication (Piram et al 2010). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 03-AR-0298 
In total, 43 patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients completed 60 months of treatment, 19 
patients had not yet reached 60 months and 2 patients discontinued the study prematurely due 
to noncompliance and withdrawal of consent. NOMID/CINCA was diagnosed in 36 patients 
(83.7%). Seven patients (16.3%) were enrolled fulfilling the study inclusion criteria, but had 
characteristics overlapping between MWS and NOMID/CINCA. Of the 43 patients, 25 (58.1%) 
were females, and 36 (83.7%) were white. All patients had active disease at baseline. Patient 
ages at treatment start ranged from 0.7 to 46.3 years, with an overall mean (SD) of 10.3 (10.4) 
years. Most patients were children (36 patients): 13 below 2 years, 18 between 2 and 11 years, 
and 5 between 12 and 17 years. The youngest patients were 8 months old. The populations 
studied are considered representative of the population intended to be treated. CAPS is a life-
long disease, and symptoms appear early in life, in NOMID/CINCA even within days or weeks of 
birth. Both genders are affected equally, and the disease may affect patients of all races. 
Out of 43 patients enrolled, 9 were excluded from the ITT group because treatment was started 
before the baseline visit. Thus, the ITT population was 34 subjects. Five more subjects were 
excluded due to missing baseline diary data (ITT diary population; n = 29), seven patients were 
subsequently excluded because of missing diary data before or after the withdrawal period 
(withdrawal population; n = 22). The first 11 patients constituted the “withdrawal group” and the 
remaining 11 patients was the “treatment group”.  
The primary objectives of the study were to assess the change in DSSS of 5 key symptoms 
(fever, rash, headache, joint pain, and vomiting) and the change in SAA levels from baseline to 
3-6 months of administration of anakinra. Results showed that the key symptoms of NOMID 
improved rapidly and significantly as assessed by DSSS from baseline to Month 3-6, with an 
estimated change of -3.5 (95% CI -3.7 to -3.3; p <0.0001) and this range of improvement was 
constant throughout the study up to Month 60. Within 3 days of treatment initiation, the DSSS 
decreased from a mean baseline value of 4.5 to 0.8 at Day 3. All age group showed comparable 
clinical improvement. There was a rapid and sustained decrease in diary symptom score from 
baseline to Month 60 for each individual key symptom, except for vomiting, which had a very low 
score already at study initiation. Secondary diary symptom scoring (e.g. fatigue and eye 
redness) displayed similar changes, decreasing significantly during early treatment up to Month 
60.

It was noted that instead of using validated skin and joint scores self-composed scoring systems 
were used. During the procedure it was clarified that both the dermatology and joint scores, 
designed for the purpose of the study, were at the time considered to best address the 
characteristic features of severe CAPS. The most comprehensive way to demonstrate 
improvement in disease manifestations was to report each component separately. Rash and the 
individual components of a DAS 28, including joint swelling and pain as well as CRP and ESR 
have all been reported. 
In study 03-AR-0298, the SAA levels decreased significantly over the first 3 months of Kineret 
treatment (from median 149 mg/L at baseline to 6 mg/L). The decrease in SAA, calculated based 
on a repeated measures analysis of covariance model, was significant and sustained throughout 
the study period. The inflammatory serum markers ESR and hsCRP also decreased significantly 
during the first 3-month treatment period; median ESR from 52 to 16 mm/h and median hsCRP 
from 51 to 4 mg/L. 
An open withdrawal phase after 3 months of treatment served as a treatment control. As evident 
from symptom scores and inflammatory markers (SAA, hsCRP, and ESR), the withdrawal of 
anakinra resulted in relapse within a few days. Reinstitution of anakinra led to rapid clinical 
improvements. The withdrawal phase was discontinued after the first 11 patients due to the 
dramatic effect of withdrawal and reinstitution. 
Long-term results up to 5 years (60 months) showed progression of most of the secondary 
efficacy variables. Indicators of CNS inflammation (elevated intracranial pressure, laboratory 
evidence of aseptic meningitis in the CSF, and headache) decreased significantly. Significant 
improvements were seen in other secondary symptoms, including fatigue, difficulties ambulating, 
eye redness, and sleep problems, as well as in rash, joint status, endurance test, and QoL 
scores. Ophthalmology data showed significant reductions in inflammatory eye manifestations 
including uveitis and papilledema. Visual acuity and peripheral vision did not improve. Hearing 
loss was not improved by anakinra treatment. 
It became clear during the initial years of treatment that, in addition to the basic criteria of 
preventing disease flares such as rash, fever, and elevated CRP, dose adjustments had to 
address “smoldering” organ inflammation to prevent progression of organ damage and to 
preserve organ function (e.g. hearing). Thus, the criteria for dose escalation evolved during the 
study from dose increases mainly due to clinical symptoms and elevated CRP to focus also on 
organ inflammation of eyes, inner ear, and CNS. Due to dose adjustments in order to achieve the 
treatment objectives, the average dose at the end of the study was higher than the initial dose 
leveling off to a range of 3.2-3.6 mg/kg after 48-60 months, for all age groups (<2, 2-11, 12-17 
and ≥ 18 yrs). 
Supportive studies 
Although the studies were independently designed and conducted, the parameters used when 
evaluating therapeutic effects in the treatment of CAPS are largely similar allowing descriptive 
comparisons of the short and long-term effects across studies. The results observed in the 
pivotal trial were generally consistent with the findings of the supportive studies published in the 
literature. Throughout these studies, the authors reported that the patients displayed a rapid 
clinical response to anakinra, with prompt remission of overt symptoms as rash, fever, 
conjunctivitis, and arthralgia, corresponding to the parameters of the DSSS employed in study 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/398765/2013 
Page 66/93 
 
  
03-AR-0298. A prompt and persistent normalization of inflammatory markers, including SAA, 
CRP and haematological measures, was achieved in the patients in the two supportive published 
studies that included patients with the most severe forms of CAPS (Lepore et al 2010, Neven et 
al 2010), and in MWS patients, a similar decrease in inflammatory marker levels were observed 
early after treatment initiation (Hawkins et al 2004, Kümmerle-Deschner et al 2011, Leslie et al 
2006). This finding is also described in Ross et al 2008 in FCAS patients during 4 weeks of 
Kineret treatment. 
A sustained control of inflammatory disease manifestations was achieved also in the supportive 
studies, both including long-term data. However, a common finding was the requirement of dose 
increments in many patients over time to maintain disease control, both in terms of overt 
symptoms of disease flare and chronic organ inflammation. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of study 03-RA-0298 showed that anakinra significantly decreased the primary 
endpoints NOMID-specific diary scores and biomarkers of inflammation (SAA, CRP, and ESR). 
Results were consistent across all subgroups including age, gender, presence of CIAS1 mutation, 
and disease phenotype. Remission was sustained up to 60 months. Following withdrawal, fever, 
rash, joint pain, and vomiting all appeared after the first day and headache after 2 days. 
Symptoms promptly responded to reinstitution of anakinra. Indicators of CNS inflammation 
(elevated intracranial pressure, laboratory evidence of aseptic meningitis in the CSF, and 
headache) decreased significantly. Significant improvements were seen in other secondary 
symptoms, including fatigue, difficulties ambulating, eye redness, and sleep problems, as well as 
in rash, joint status, endurance test, and QoL scores. Ophthalmology data showed significant 
reductions in inflammatory eye manifestations including uveitis and papilledema. These effects 
on inflammation are all considered of clinical importance for CAPS patients. Visual acuity and 
peripheral vision did not improve. Hearing loss was not improved by anakinra treatment.  
The results reported in the supportive prospective and retrospective efficacy studies in patients 
across the whole spectrum of CAPS severity, as well as by published case reports, were in line 
with the efficacy results observed in the pivotal study 03-AR-0298. In all studies, the onset of 
response following anakinra treatment was rapid with a clinically relevant effect within a few 
days. The treatment resulted in a normalization of inflammatory serum markers and overt 
disease symptoms as shown in the meta-analysis and the descriptive comparison of efficacy. 
Kineret treatment also reduced or stabilized the progression of neurological manifestations, 
hearing, vision and QoL in severe CAPS phenotype patients. 
The prefilled syringe with a graduated label with a dosage range of 20-100 mg and scale 
intervals of 10 mg allows the new dose regimen required for CAPS patients as well as the 
administration of the 100 mg dosage required in RA patients. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data of anakinra for the treatment of CAPS originated from the pivotal study 03-AR-
0298 supported by published studies and published case reports as well as safety reports from 
the MAH’s safety database. Supportive safety data in JIA patients from study 990758 and its 
Kineret (anakinra)

open label extension, study 990779. These 2 studies were already assessed by the CHMP in 2006 
as part of the MAH’s obligation to submit paediatric data.  
Patient exposure 
The safety population included 43 patients, of whom 26 patients (60.5%) had a treatment 
duration of >4 years. Median duration of exposure expressed as patient years was 4.9 and total 
exposure 159.8 patient years. Most patients were exposed to dose levels up to 3 mg/kg, with the 
dose level of 2 mg/kg representing most patient years (76.0). 
Table 24 
Duration  of  Kineret  treatment  as  patient  years  by  dose  level  (Safety 
population) 
There were no major differences in duration between subgroups (baseline age, gender, CIAS1 
mutation, and starting dose level), except for a slightly shorter duration of treatment in patients 
<2 years because this age group was included only during the later years of the study. 
An estimation of the total Kineret exposure in CAPS studies, including study 03-AR-0298 and the 
supporting published studies, is presented below.

Rate=number of events per patient year.  
In total, 1233 TEAEs occurred in 41 patients (95.3%). Thirty-two AEs were classified as 
significant. None of these events led to permanent discontinuation of study medication, but one 
patient was temporarily withdrawn from treatment, and dose adjustments (all dose increases) 
were made for 11 AEs in 5 patients. 
The most commonly reported AEs (occurring in >10% of the patients or >10 AEs) are 
summarised by preferred term in the table below. The most frequent SOCs involved were 
Infections and infestations (86.0%), General disorders (65.1%), Nervous system disorders 
(53.5%) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (46.5%). The most common AEs 
were headache (48.8%), arthralgia (41.9%), pyrexia (39.5%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(39.5%), nasopharyngitis (34.9%), and rash (32.6%). Other frequent AEs were ocular 
hyperemia, sinusitis, ear infection and otitis media. With the exception of infections, these AEs 
are also common features of NOMID/CINCA and as such may have been scored in the disease 
diary as well. Eight patients (18.6%) reported injection site reactions (ISRs). 
Most AEs (86.0%) were mild in intensity (1.1% were severe) and classified by the investigator to 
be unrelated or unlikely related to study treatment (81.3%).

Table 27 
Most common (>10% of patients or >10 adverse events) treatment-
emergent adverse events by preferred term (Safety population)  
Most AEs (427) were recorded during the first year, which also represented most patient years 
(40.9). The AE reporting rate was 10.4, calculated as number of AEs per patient year. Rates 
decreased the 2 following years to 6.2 and 4.3, respectively. At year 4, the number of patient 
years was unchanged, but there was an increase in reported AEs leading to an increase in the 
reporting rate up to 12.0. At year 5, rates were back to 4.9, the same level as year 3. 
There was an increase in AE reporting in 2007 due to reporting of disease symptoms as AEs. The 
year 2007 was also the fourth treatment year for the first 18 patients, which explains why many 
AEs related to the disease were recorded year 4, e.g. arthralgia, headache, pyrexia, rash, ocular 
hyperaemia and fatigue. The number of patient years 2007 was comparable to 2006 and 2008. 
The frequency of infections (AEs in the SOC Infections and infestations) remained on a stable 
level. The AE reporting rate was 2.4 the first year of treatment, 1.5 the second year, and 
Kineret (anakinra)

between 1.3 and 1.6 the following years. ISRs were reported during the first year of treatment 
and thereafter at only one occasion the following year.

PYRS=patient years, F=Number of events, rate=number of events per patient year. 
Included in table if >10% of patients or >10 events. Adverse events which started  
before the first dose of Kineret, started or worsened after the last dose of Kineret, after  
Month 60 visit, or during the withdrawal period are excluded. NOTE: Two adverse events 
are excluded due to missing date of onset. 
Adverse events by age 
The number of AEs per patient year, i.e. the AE reporting rate, by age at AE onset is presented in 
Table 35. There were similar overall rates in the age groups <2, 2-11, and ≥18 years (9.5, 8.6, 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report

and 9.5, respectively) and a lower rate in the age group 12-17 years (3.6). Individual SOCs 
indicated that Gastrointestinal disorders, General disorders, and Infections and infestations were 
more common in patients <2 years and Musculoskeletal disorders in patients ≥18 years.  
Adverse events by dose 
For AEs classified by dose at AE onset, there were no differences between doses of 1-
3 mg/kg/day and ≥4 mg/kg/day in the overall AE reporting rate (7.9 and 6.8) or in rates for 
individual SOCs and AEs. The dose 3 mg/kg was selected based on the estimated plateau dose 
level reached during the study. 
Adverse events by presence of CIAS1 mutation 
There were no major differences between the CIAS1 and non-CIAS1 groups in AE reporting rates 
(7.4 and 9.2). Thus, CIAS1 mutation was not associated with more or less AEs. Similar rates 
were obtained for the groups on the SOC level, except for Eye disorders with 55 AEs, whereof 35 
ocular hyperemia, in the CIAS1 group and 4 AEs in the non-CIAS1 group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths during the study. 
There were 24 SAEs reported in 14 patients. Most common were SAEs in the SOC Infections and 
infestations (13 SAEs), with pneumonia and gastroenteritis occurring in 3 and 2 patients, 
respectively, and the SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (4 SAEs, all related to 
lumbar puncture, which was part of the study procedure). Eleven of the SAEs were considered 
causally related (possible or probable) to drug treatment by the investigator; all were infections, 
one in combination with an episode of histiocytosis hematophagica. Four SAEs regarding 
infections were considered not related (unrelated or unlikely). There was one SAE report 
regarding histiocytosis haematophagica (also known as macrophage activation syndrome [MAS]) 
in connection with a post-operative infection. The patient, who was mutation negative, had 2 
previous episodes of MAS before start of Kineret treatment. She was treated with prednisolone 
and cyclosporine, and the Kineret dose was maintained at 2 mg/kg/day. The event resolved 
without sequelae.

Treatment-emergent serious adverse events by system-organ class and 
preferred term (Safety population) 
Injection site reactions 
Ten out of 43 (23%) patients reported 17 ISRs (i.e. AEs belonging to MedDRA HLGT 
Administration site reactions) in study 03-AR-0298. Out of the 17 ISRs, 11 (65%) occurred 
during the first month and 13 (76%) were reported during the first 6 months. No ISRs were 
reported after year 2. All ISRs reported during the first 6 months of Kineret treatment occurred 
in patients who had received a starting dose of 1 mg/kg. With the exception of one event of 
injection site erythema in a patient 12-17 years, ISRs were only reported in patients 2-11 years 
and ≥18 years. Most ISRs (13 out of 17) were mild, none was severe and there were no serious 
ISRs. There was no difference between genders in reporting rates of ISRs. Patients with a 
CIAS1 mutation had a similar AE reporting rate of ISRs compared to those without the 
mutation, 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. 
Infections 
In total 37 patients out of 43 (86%) reported 273 infections (AE reporting rate 1.7). The most 
common infections were upper respiratory tract infection (reporting rate 0.3) and 
nasopharyngitis (reporting rate 0.3). There were no deaths but 7 patients experienced 13 SAEs 
denoting infections (rate 0.1). Nine were judged as causally related (possible or probable) to 
drug treatment by the investigator, one in combination with an episode of histiocytosis

hematophagica. Four SAEs denoting infections were considered not related (unrelated or 
unlikely). In one patient, Kineret was temporarily stopped and in 2 cases the Kineret dose was 
increased during the infections. All SAEs resolved.  
The overall frequency of infections remained stable over time with the exception of a higher 
reporting rate during the first year of treatment; 2.4 the first year of treatment, 1.5 the second 
year, and between 1.3 and 1.6 the following years. The reporting rate during the first 6 months 
was higher (2.9) in patients who had received a starting dose of 1 mg/kg than in those starting 
on 2 mg/kg (1.3). There was no difference between genders in reporting rates of infections. 
The reporting rate for infections was higher in patients <2 years (rate 3.4) and 2-11 years (rate 
2.2), than in other age groups. Most infections were classified as mild or moderate. There were 
no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to infections. Kineret administration was 
temporarily stopped in 1 patient due to an infection, and doses were increased in 5 patients due 
to disease flares in connection with the infections. Patients with a CIAS1 mutation had a similar 
yearly rate of infections compared to those without the mutation, 1.7 and 2.0, respectively. 
Hepatic events 
In total there were 6 hepatic events in 5 patients. All events were considered mild, except one 
episode of Hepatic enzyme increased which was considered to be of moderate severity. All 
events were non-serious and resolved without sequelae on continued Kineret treatment.

Laboratory findings 
At baseline, haemoglobin and haematocrit values were low and WBC, neutrophil, and platelet 
values were elevated, reflecting active disease in the study population. All values improved 
rapidly after initiation of Kineret treatment and levels were sustained up to Month 60. 
Inflammatory  markers  (ESR,  hsCRP,  SAA,  haptoglobin,  and  fibrinogen)  were  all  elevated  at 
baseline.  All  values  improved  rapidly  after  initiation  of  Kineret  treatment  and  levels  were 
sustained up to Month 60. No clinically relevant changes were found in the urinalysis. 
Safety in special populations 
A patient became pregnant during the study. Due to the risk of a disease flare, anakinra was 
continued during the whole pregnancy, and the baby was delivered full-term. After birth, the 
patient remained on anakinra. The baby was diagnosed with D303N mutation and was started on 
anakinra treatment before the age of 1 year.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed for the CAPS indication. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of Kineret treatment. One patient was temporarily 
withdrawn from treatment due to cellulitis, wound infection and chest pain. These AEs were 
classified as serious. Treatment was reinstituted after 2 weeks. 
Five patients had their doses adjusted due to AEs; all adjustments were dose increases in 
connection with disease flares. At some of these occasions, CAPS symptoms escalating to flares 
were induced by infections. Three of the AEs leading to dose adjustment in 2 patients were 
considered serious. 
Safety database report 
There were 28 medically confirmed reports with 44 AEs in the MAH safety database in patients 
with different forms of CAPS (cut-off date 13 May 2012). The majority, 18 reports with 30 AEs, 
concerns patients with NOMID/CINCA. There are no reports with fatal SAEs. Thirteen out of the 
28 medically confirmed reports in CAPS patients were serious, and contain, in total, 20 SAEs.

*** This patient has also taken part in study 03-AR-0298, in which she also developed a serious event of MAS. 
Safety reported from the literature 
There are no fatal AEs, and with the exception of a case report no severe or serious AEs 
reported in any of the 7 published studies including 66 CAPS patients or in the published case 
reports comprising 133 CAPS patients. It should be noted that the reported safety information, 
in many cases, is very limited for published studies and case reports. 
Adverse events in published studies with CAPS subdiagnosis NOMID/CINCA 
Neven et al. 2012: The most common adverse effects reported were mild local stinging and 
erythema at the injection sites, which gradually decreased in most patients. All patients gained 
height and exhibited increased BMI. Two patients became overweight, with BMI more than 
2 standard deviation (SD) above normal mean value. No severe infections were reported but it 
should be noted that all patients had been immunized against Streptococcus pneumonia and 
Haemophilus influenzae. The 2 youngest patients also received daily antibiotic prophylaxis with 
penicillin and trimethoprim. 
Adverse events in published studies with CAPS subdiagnosis MWS 
Kümmerle-Deschner et al. 2011: There were no reports of serious adverse events during the 
study period. The reported adverse events included mild injection site reactions in 5 patients 
(42%), mild infections in 5 patients (42%), and hyperactivity and weight gain in 4 patients each

Adverse events in published studies in mixed CAPS populations 
Lepore et al. 2010: Compliance to treatment was good in all patients; there were no cases of 
treatment withdrawal for AEs. The main AEs observed were local erythematous skin reactions at 
the injection site, especially at the beginning of the treatment in 4 patients, excessive weight 
gain in 2 patients; and severe oral aphthosis in 1 patient. Stomatitis improved after Kineret 
withholding to reappear on re-challenge 1 week later. Treatment with anakinra was, however, 
ongoing at the time of the last follow-up at 45 months. No severe infections requiring suspension 
of Kineret for long periods or hospitalizations were observed. 
Leslie et al. 2006: Minor local stinging and erythema at the injection sites, gradually diminishing 
in most patients, were reported. Three adults gained substantial weight, according to the authors 
presumably reflecting resolution of their former lifelong chronic inflammatory catabolic state. 
Adverse events in published case reports 
In most published case reports no safety findings were reported or it was only reported that 
anakinra was well tolerated. There are a few reports describing ISRs and one report describing a 
need for dose reduction of anakinra due to leukopenia. 
Injection site reactions in published studies and case reports 
ISRs are the most frequently reported AEs in published studies and case reports in CAPS 
patients. There are sporadic reports of ISRs that have caused temporary, but not permanent, 
discontinuations of Kineret treatment. From the limited information available, there are 
indications that the ISRs occur early during Kineret treatment and decrease over time. 
Infections in published studies and case reports 
With the exception of a case report described describing an 8-year old boy with the CAPS 
subdiagnosis NOMID/CINCA who experienced several episodes of gastroenteritis, bronchitis and 
pharyngo-tonsillitis requiring hospitalization (Rigante et al 2008), no severe or serious AEs 
denoting infections were reported in published studies and case reports. There were occasional 
reports of mild, non-serious infections. 
Other supportive study 
Study 990758/990779  
-  Study 990758: a randomized, multicenter, blinded placebo-controlled study with an open-
label run-in period to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of daily, single 
subcutaneous injections of anakinra in polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 
(JRA). 
-  Study 990779: a companion extension study to evaluate the long-term safety of daily, 
single subcutaneous injections of anakinra in subjects with JRA who participated in IL-1 ra 
protocol 990758. 
Study 990758 and its extension, study 990779, were initially planned for efficacy evaluation in 
JIA, but due to insufficient enrolment of patients the primary objective was changed to safety

evaluation. This study was submitted to the CHMP in 2006 (procedure OTH 017). On 22 
November 2006, the CHMP concluded that the data cannot support an extension of indication for 
the treatment of juvenile arthritis.  
Eighty-six patients were included in the initial open-label phase, 50 in the placebo-controlled 
phase (25 on placebo and 25 on Kineret) and 44 in the open-label continuation phase. A total of 
29 patients completed study 990758/990779. The total Kineret exposure in the study was 46.8 
patient years. The number of patient-years on blinded Kineret and placebo treatment was 8.4 
and 6.6, respectively. 
Common AEs in study 990758/990779 
In study 990758/990779, the overall most commonly reported AE was headache. The reporting 
rate for headache was higher for Kineret treated patients than for placebo, 1.5 and 0.6 
respectively. Most headaches were classified as mild; only one event was classified as severe. 
There were no SAEs or discontinuations due to headache. 
In general, the reporting rate of AEs was highest during the initial 6 weeks of treatment in the 
open-label phase of study 990758. This pattern was most apparent for ISRs but also headache 
and infections had a lower reporting rate after week 6. During the blinded phase, headache was 
the most commonly reported AE and occurred more frequently in Kineret treated patients. 
Headache was less common during weeks 6 to 12 than during the initial 6 weeks, in both the 
anakinra and placebo groups. The frequency of ISRs was lower than during the open label 
990758 phase, evenly distributed over time and there was no difference in frequency between 
anakinra and placebo treated patients. Infections had a similar reporting rate over time, both in 
anakinra and placebo treated patients. 
Serious AEs in study 990758/990779 
Three patients experienced an SAE (fracture, bacterial infection and papilledema) during the 
open-label phase of study 990758, giving an overall SAE reporting rate of 0.2. No event was 
considered to be related to treatment. During the blinded treatment phase, 1 patient on Kineret 
experienced 1 event of serious herpes zoster (rate 0.1). The event was judged to be related to 
treatment. One patient reported serious hepatitis in connection with a cytomegalovirus infection 
during the 990779 open-label phase. The event was judged to be not related to treatment. Two 
additional SAEs (nephrosis and viral infection) were recorded during this study phase. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation or dose adjustment in study 990758/990779 
During the initial open-label phase, 4 patients experienced 7 AEs that led to withdrawal. None of 
these events were serious. The most common AEs causing withdrawal during the open-label 
phase were ISRs (rate 0.3), constituting 5 of 7 AEs in 3 patients. During the blinded phase 1 
patient on Kineret withdrew due to non-serious arthralgia. During the open-label 990779 phase, 
2 patients withdrew due to non-serious AEs defined as RA (rate 0.1).

Injection site reactions in study 990758/990779 
During the initial 6 weeks of Kineret treatment, the reporting rate for ISRs was 18.25. The 
reporting rates thereafter declined rapidly, the reporting rate during weeks >6 to 12, >12-28, 
>28-40 and >40 was 4.4, 1.4, 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. During the whole study, the reporting 
rate for ISRs was more than twice as high in females than in males (rate 8.06 vs. 2.79). During 
the open-label 990758 phase, ISRs were most frequent in the age group 12–18 years, but 
overall study periods, rates were comparable between age groups. The ISR with the highest 
reporting rate (3.0) during the open-label 990758 phase, was injection site pain. During the 
blinded phase the ISR reporting rate in Kineret and placebo treated patients was similar, 1.2 
and 1.4, respectively. Most ISRs were mild, none was severe. There were no serious ISRs. ISRs 
leading to discontinuation only occurred in the open-label phase of study 990758. Five ISRs 
caused withdrawal of 3 patients.  
Infections in study 990758/990779 
When calculating the frequency of infections using continuous exposure, 41 patients out of 86 
(48%) reported 99 infectious episodes (rate 2.8). The AE reporting rate was relatively constant 
(2.9 - 3.2) during the first 40 weeks of treatment but decreased to 1.4 thereafter. More females 
than males experienced infectious episodes (rate 3.4 vs. 1.6), and children 2-11 years old were 
somewhat more affected than patients 12-18 years old (3.3 vs. 2.1). During the blinded phase 
the AE reporting rate was slightly higher among Kineret treated patients than placebo treated, 
2.5 and 2.1, respectively. The most common AEs in the study judged to be infectious episodes 
were upper respiratory tract infections and fever. There were no discontinuations due to 
infectious episodes. Three infectious episodes in 3 patients were classified as serious (impetigo, 
herpes zoster and hepatitis in connection with a CMV infection), corresponding to a yearly 
reporting rate of 0.1. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
No clinically relevant patterns of abnormalities in clinical laboratory evaluations were identified in 
the study populations. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population in the pivotal study 03-AR-0298 comprised 43 CAPS patients. The 
treatment duration was up to 5 years, corresponding to 159.8 patient years of Kineret exposure. 
Most patients (60.5%) were exposed >4 years, and 91% of the patients were exposed >1 year. 
The AE reporting frequency was highest during the first year of Kineret treatment and decreased 
thereafter except for year 4. Headache, arthralgia, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
nasopharyngitis and rash were the most common AEs. All these AEs, apart from infections, are 
also common features of CAPS. Most AEs were mild in intensity (86.0%) and considered to be 
unrelated or unlikely related to study treatment (81.3%). Infections seemed to be more 
prevalent in the younger age groups and occurred with the lowest frequency in the group 12-17 
years (0.5), but increased again slightly in the group >18 years (1.6). Analysis of TEAEs 
classified by presence of CIAS1 mutation showed that there were no major differences between 
the CIAS1 and non-CIAS1 groups in overall AE reporting rates, 7.4 and 9.2, respectively. Similar 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report

Page 79/93 
 
  
 
rates were obtained for the groups on the SOC level, except for eye disorders with 55 AEs (rate 
0.5), whereof 35 ocular hyperaemia (which could also be a symptom of CAPS) in the CIAS1 
group, and 4 AEs in the non-CIAS1 group (rate 0.1). This information was reported in the SmPC. 
There were no deaths in the study. Fourteen patients experienced 24 SAEs. SAEs were most 
common in the SOC Infections and infestations. In total 7 patients (16.3%) developed 13 serious 
infections (among which 3 pneumonia, 2 gastroenteritis, 1 septic arthritis, 1 otitis media were 
the most severe). This seemed to be noticeably higher compared to known experience with RA 
patients. During the procedure the applicant clarified that in the RA safety data, there are a total 
of 51 serious infections in 923.4 patient years corresponding to 0.06 serious infections/patient 
year. Among CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298 there were a total of 13 serious infections in 
159.8 patient years, corresponding to 0.08 serious infections/patient year. In conclusion, the 
CHMP agreed that when time of exposure is taken into account, the frequency of serious 
infections is similar in patients in the RA safety pool and CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298. Ten 
out of 43 (23%) patients reported 17 ISRs. In total 65% occurred during the first month and 
76% were reported during the first 6 months. No ISRs were reported after year 2. ISRs were 
only reported in patients 2-11 years and ≥18 years, with the exception of one event of in a 12-
17 years patient. Most ISRs (13) were mild, none was severe and there were no serious ISRs.  
There were no permanent discontinuations of study medication due to AEs. Dose adjustments 
were made for 11 AEs in 5 patients. All dose adjustments were increases in connection with 
disease flares, in some cases induced by infections. 
The lack of control group made difficult to evaluate the spectrum of AEs occurring in the study 
population. Many of the reported AEs were probably disease manifestation of NOMID/CINCA 
rather than real reactions to anakinra. At least this was illustrated in year 4 (2007) when the rate 
of AEs per patients year increased to 12.0 compared to first year (10.4), second year (6.2), third 
year (4.3) fourth year (12.0), and fifth year (4.9). Therefore, the safety data of anakinra in 
paediatric patients were supported by safety study 990758 and its long-term extension study 
990779 in JIA patients. Eighty-six patients were included in the initial open-label phase, 50 in the 
placebo-controlled phase (25 on placebo and 25 on anakinra) and 44 in the open-label 
continuation phase. A total of 29 patients completed study 990758/990779. The total anakinra 
exposure was 46.8 patient years. The number of patient-years on blinded anakinra and placebo 
treatment was 8.4 and 6.6, respectively. No patient died during the study. There were 7 SAEs in 
6 patients, all during Kineret treatment (fracture, bacterial infection, papilledema, serious herpes 
zoster, serious hepatitis, nephrosis and viral infection). All SAEs, except for an event of nephrosis 
resolved without sequelae. Eight patients discontinued study drug permanently due to AEs during 
Kineret treatment. The most common AEs were ISRs, headache, and upper respiratory tract 
infections, and the majority was assessed as mild or moderate. During the blinded phase, the 
most common AEs for patients receiving anakinra were headache.  
The pattern of AEs reported in the published studies of different sub-diagnoses of CAPS, 
appeared similar to that in study 03-AR-0298. No new clinically relevant AEs, either in paediatric 
or adult patients, were reported in the studies, comprising in total 66 patients with Kineret 
exposure up to 54 months. No SAEs were reported in the studies. Published case reports 
comprise 133 CAPS patients. The vast majority of the reports contain very limited safety 
information and most of the reports have no reported AEs therefore the data must be interpreted 
with caution. ISRs were the most frequently reported AEs in published studies and case reports 
Kineret (anakinra)  
Assessment report

Page 80/93 
 
  
in CAPS patients. The safety data presented in the published studies and case reports do not 
deviate from the findings in study 03-AR-0298. 
In the applicant’ safety database there are 28 medically confirmed reports with 44 AEs in 
patients with different forms of CAPS. In total 18 reports (30 AEs) concerned patients with 
NOMID/CINCA. There were no reports with fatal SAEs. Thirteen out of the 28 medically confirmed 
reports were serious, and contain, in total, 20 SAEs. The types and distribution of AEs in CAPS 
patients compared with the total paediatric and adult patient populations was generally similar. 
No new clinically relevant AEs have been identified, no AEs occur with a markedly higher 
frequency among CAPS patients compared to other Kineret-treated paediatric and adult patients. 
Overall, no new safety signal was identified and the safety in CAPS patients observed from the 
pivotal trial and the published literature submitted was generally in line with the known safety 
profile of anakinra in RA patients.  
Kineret is administered from a prefilled syringe. The prefilled syringe contains 100 mg and is 
intended for single use. When used for treatment of adult patients with RA the whole content of 
the syringe, 100 mg, is injected. To meet the demands for use in children with CAPS that need 
smaller and varying doses of Kineret, the syringe is supplied with a graduated label to allow for 
single-use injections of doses in the interval 20-100 mg in steps of 10 mg. The scale interval has 
been chosen based on the clinical need to adjust dosing, to achieve an easy-to-communicate 
dosing versus body weight regimen, and to secure readability and thereby compliance. There 
remains a potential risk of overdosing or underdosing if the wrong volume of Kineret is injected 
in a patient requiring a lower dose than 100 mg. The PL, including instructions on the use of the 
syringe has been designed to further prevent re-use by requiring disposal of the needle cover 
and discarding the excess solution prior to injection. This addresses the risk of both overdosing 
and re-use. Usability testing of the graduated syringe confirmed that the instructions for use of 
the graduated syringe in the PL are both easily understood and easy to adhere to. In addition, as 
part of the educational programme (as detailed in the RMP), clear instructions on correct 
injection procedures and disposal of used syringes will be given so that healthcare providers can 
further instruct patients on the proper use of the graduated syringe. 
In order to follow further the long-term safety of Kineret treatment in CAPS patients the MAH will 
follow (as described in the RMP) the already existing cohort registered in the Eurofever registry 
via the associated PRINTO network: Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation 
(PRINTO)/Eurofever Registry. There are multiple registries across Europe covering 
autoinflammatory conditions. The EU-supported Eurofever registry is an initiative to collect data 
from all these registries as well as other previously uncategorized patient groups into one 
registry. Eurofever is organized and maintained by the PRINTO and the PRINTO network has 
been utilized to collect data for the Eurofever registry. The PRINTO network will collect data pre-
specified by the MAH. PRINTO will compile yearly reports based on the data and supply the 
reports to the MAH. This non-interventional, post authorization safety study will evaluate the 
safety of Kineret in the treatment of CAPS in routine clinical care. Focus will be on serious 
infections, malignancies, injection site reactions, allergic reactions and medication errors. 
European CAPS patients treated with Kineret at the time of market authorization or starting 
treatment during the study will be eligible for inclusion in the study. The patients will be enrolled 
according to the treatment recommendations in the SmPC. The planned duration of the follow-up 
period for each patient will be 3 years. The duration of the enrolment period will be 1 year and 
Kineret (anakinra)

the study is estimated to enrol 15-20 CAPS patients. Results will be reported annually. The 1st 
annual submission is expected by July 2015. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new safety signal has been observed in the CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298. The AE and 
SAE reporting rates were generally low. The most common AEs were headache, arthralgia, 
pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and rash. Apart from infections, all are 
also common features of CAPS. ISR were common but none were serious. They mainly occurred 
the first 6 months and tended to ease off with time. No ISRs were reported after year 2. The 
most common SAEs were reported within the SOC Infections and infestations. The frequency of 
serious infections was shown as being similar in patients in the RA and CAPS patients in study 
03-AR-0298. Infections seemed to be more prevalent in the younger age groups and occurred 
with the lowest frequency in the group 12-17 years (0.5), but increased again slightly in the 
group >18 years (1.6). No patients permanently discontinued from the study as a result of an 
infection. 
The pattern of AEs reported in the published literature and the case reports were similar to that 
in study 03-AR-0298.  
Most adverse events in CAPS and JIA patients occurred during the first months of Kineret 
treatment. Although the reporting rates were generally lower in CAPS patients than in JIA 
patients, the AE profile was generally similar in the 2 populations. The higher doses of Kineret 
given to the CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298 did not seem to affect the safety profile. 
The long term safety of anakinra in CAPS treated patients will be further followed-up and 
characterised with the submissions of annual report of the PRINTO/Eurofever registry results.

The results of study 03-RA-0298 showed that anakinra significantly decreased the primary 
endpoints NOMID-specific diary scores and biomarkers of inflammation (SAA, CRP, and ESR). 
Results were consistent across all subgroups including age, gender, presence of CIAS1 mutation, 
and disease phenotype. Remission was sustained up to 60 months. Following withdrawal, fever, 
rash, joint pain, and vomiting all appeared after the first day and headache after 2 days. 
Symptoms promptly responded to reinstitution of anakinra.  
Indicators  of  CNS  inflammation  (elevated  intracranial  pressure,  laboratory  evidence  of  aseptic 
meningitis  in  the  CSF,  and  headache)  decreased  significantly.  Significant  improvements  were 
seen  in  other  secondary  symptoms,  including  fatigue,  difficulties  ambulating,  eye  redness,  and 
sleep problems, as well as in rash, joint status, endurance test, and QoL scores. 
Ophthalmology  data  showed  significant  reductions  in  inflammatory  eye  manifestations  including 
uveitis and papilledema. 
These  effects  on  inflammation  are  all  considered  of  clinical  importance  for  CAPS  patients.  Pre-
existing organ damage or failure seems not to be reversed by the treatment. 
The  prefilled  syringe  with  a  graduated  label  with  a  dosage  range  of  20-100  mg  and  scale 
intervals  of  10  mg  allows  the  new  dose  regimen  required  for  CAPS  patients  as  well  as  the 
administration of the 100 mg dosage required in RA patients. 
•  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the pivotal study, the number of CAPS patients treated with anakinra (n=43) was limited; this 
is however acknowledged as CAPS is an extremely rare condition limiting the recruitment 
possibilities. Out of the 43 patients enrolled the ITT diary population was formed of only 29 
patients. The withdrawal period included only the first 11 patients. This limited population was 
probably not representative for the entire study group. However, the dramatic effect observed of 
withdrawal and reinstitution of anakinra led to the discontinuation of this withdrawal phase. 
Even in a setting of a rare disease such as CAPS, a controlled setting is preferable for the 
evaluation of efficacy to an uncontrolled setting for the conduct of the clinical trial. However 
because of the high rate of response, the high rate of worsening on withdrawal and the response 
on re-treatment and the evidence on the beneficial effect of anakinra on signs and symptoms can 
be considered sufficient as reported by the CHMP in its advice given in 2011. A placebo controlled 
trial was not feasible given that there were authorised medicinal products for the treatments of 
Kineret (anakinra)

CAPS in the EU and given the severity of the disease. An active comparator study with non-
inferiority as the primary goal would have limited results due to the very limited number of CAPS 
patients. 
Clinical data in children <1 year were limited. Especially treatment of infants <8 months of age, 
premature and newborn lacks clinical (including efficacy and safety) data and PK data. The 
limited available data is adequately reflected in the SmPC and the indication starts from the age 
of 8 months with a minimum body weight of 10 kg.  
Risks 
•  Unfavourable effects 
Anakinra was generally well tolerated during the study 03-RA-0298. The most common AEs were 
headache, arthralgia, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and rash. Apart 
from infections, all are also common features of CAPS. The AE pattern in this study did not differ 
from the known safety profile of anakinra. Most AEs were mild in intensity. The AE rates were 
similar in the age groups <2, 2-11, and ≥18 years and a lower rate in the age group 12-17 
years. No new safety signal has been identified in the results presented. ISR were common but 
none were serious. They mainly occurred the first 6 months and tended to ease off with time. No 
ISRs were reported after year 2. The most common SAEs were infections. The frequency of 
serious infections was shown as being similar in patients in the RA and CAPS patients in study 
03-AR-0298. Infections were more common. Infections seemed to be more prevalent in the 
younger age groups and occurred with the lowest frequency in the group 12-17 years (0.5), but 
increased again slightly in the group >18 years (1.6). No patients permanently discontinued from 
the study as a result of an infection. The safety data up to week 60 are considered in line with 
the known safety profile of anakinra. 
The pattern of AEs reported in the published literature and the case reports were similar to that 
in study 03-AR-0298. No new safety signal, either in paediatric or adult patients, was reported in 
the studies with a Kineret exposure up to 54 months. With the exception of 1 case no cases of 
severe infections were reported. Injections site reactions were the most reported AEs, occurred 
early during treatment and decreased over time in line with the pivotal trial. 
To further support the anakinra safety profile in paediatric patient’s data from studies 
990758/990779 conducted in JIA patients were presented. The most common AE reported was 
headache. The incidence of IRS was higher than in CAPS but also decreased over time. Infections 
were common. The most common infections were upper respiratory tract infections. Infections 
were most common early after start of Kineret treatment and in younger patients as observed 
within the CAPS patients. The type and frequencies of SAEs were generally similar in JIA and 
CAPS patients.  
The smallest amount the Kineret syringe allows for administration is 20 mg which corresponds to 
a body weight of minimum 10 kg. The indication starts from the age of 8 months (clinical 
experience being available from 8 months of age) with a minimum body weight of 10 kg. The 
MAH has calculated that if the full content of the syringe is injected by mistake, the maximum 
total dose would amount to 100 mg corresponding to a dose of 10 mg/kg in a 10 kg infant, which 
is a high dose compared to the recommended starting dose (1-2 mg/kg). This dose only 
marginally exceeds the recommended therapeutic maintenance dose range for severe CAPS. The

PL includes clear instructions on the use of the syringe to addresses the risk of both overdosing 
and re-use. Usability testing of the graduated syringe confirmed that the instructions for use of 
the graduated syringe in the PL are both easily understood and easy to adhere to. In addition, as 
part of the educational programme (as detailed in the RMP and annex II) clear instructions on 
correct injection procedures and disposal of used syringes will be given to healthcare providers 
and patients on the proper use of the graduated syringe.  
•  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Given the limited sample size and the open label design of study 03-RA-0298, the long term 
effects of anakinra in CAPS patients, especially in children, require further characterisation. The 
PRINTO/Eurofever registry (described in the RMP) will address this, evaluating the long term 
safety of Kineret in the treatment of CAPS in routine clinical care. Focus will be on the risks of 
serious infections, malignancies, injection site reactions, allergic reactions and medication errors.  
This registry will allow further characterisation of the long term safety of anakinra treatment in 
CAPS patients. Interim data from the registry will be provided on a yearly basis. The next interim 
report is expected in July 2015 as detailed in the RMP.  
Benefit-risk balance 
• 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Results from study 03-RA-0298 showed that treatment with anakinra dosed at a starting dose of 
1-2 mg/kg/day conferred a clinical benefit to the patients reducing the signs and symptoms of 
the disease. These data are considered valuable and of clinical importance.  
The safety profile of anakinra described reported in study 03-RA-0298 and the supporting data 
was in line with the known safety profile of anakinra. No new safety signal was identified from 
the data submitted up to week 60. Long term safety of anakinra will be further characterized 
thought the PRINTO/Eurofever registry.  
•  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy results presented clearly support a positive effect of anakinra treatment in CAPS. 
Anakinra significantly decreased the primary endpoints NOMID-specific diary scores i.e. 
decreased disease manifestations, including reduction in symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, 
headache and biomarkers of inflammation (SAA, CRP, and ESR). The onset of response following 
Kineret treatment was rapid, with a clinically relevant effect within a few days in all patients. 
Results were consistent across all subgroups including age, gender, and presence of CIAS1 
mutations, and the findings were common to all the supportive studies, including patients of all 
CAPS phenotypes. Following withdrawal, fever, rash, joint pain, and vomiting all appeared after 
the first day and headache after 2 days. Symptoms promptly responded to reinstitution of 
anakinra. Indicators of CNS inflammation (elevated intracranial pressure, laboratory evidence of 
aseptic meningitis in the CSF, and headache) decreased significantly. Significant improvements 
were seen in other secondary symptoms, including fatigue, difficulties ambulating, eye redness, 
and sleep problems, as well as in rash, joint status, endurance test and QoL scores. 
Ophthalmology data showed significant reductions in inflammatory eye manifestations including 
uveitis and papilledema. Visual acuity and peripheral vision did not improve. Hearing loss was

not improved by anakinra treatment. The evaluation showed that the effects on overt clinical 
symptoms and inflammatory serum markers were sustained for up to 5 years of anakinra 
treatment. In all CAPS patients, a starting dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day was adequate to achieve the 
treatment goals. In milder forms of MWS and in FCAS patients, dose adjustments may not be 
necessary, while in severe forms of CAPS a maintenance dosage of 3 to 4 mg/kg/day may be 
required.  
A sustained control of inflammatory disease manifestations was achieved also in the supportive 
studies published in the literature. Dose increments in many patients over time to maintain 
disease control, in terms of symptoms of disease flare and chronic organ inflammation was 
necessary. 
The safety of anakinra treatment has been satisfactorily characterized in the CAPS population. 
Safety data from the pivotal study were shown to be comparable to the one currently known for 
anakinra. No new safety signal has been identified in the results presented. The 
PRINTO/Eurofever registry will further characterize the long term safety anakinra effect in CAPS 
patients. 
In conclusion, based on the available efficacy and safety data presented, the benefit risk balance 
of Kineret (100 mg/0.67 ml) presented in a graduated single-use pre-filled syringe is considered 
positive: 
• 
in the treatment of adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a 
body weight of 10 kg or above for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic 
Syndromes (CAPS), including: 
-  Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) / Chronic Infantile 
Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA) 
-  Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) 
- 
Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS). 
• 
in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in combination 
with methotrexate, with an inadequate response to methotrexate alone.

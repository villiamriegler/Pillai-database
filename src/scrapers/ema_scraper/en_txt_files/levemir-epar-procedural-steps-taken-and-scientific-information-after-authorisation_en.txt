The use of Levemir in pregnant women with diabetes has 
update information on pregnancy, based on final 
results from the non-interventional Post-Authorisation 
Safety Study, NN304-4016, listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP. This is a diabetes pregnancy registry 
study conducted to assess the long-term safety of 
insulin use in pregnant women. The RMP version 21.0 
has also been submitted.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP).

SmPC, Annex 
With the present application the MAH proposed the following 
information on an alternative titration algorithm, 
referred to as the 3-0-3 titration algorithm.  
In addition the MAH took the opportunity to amend the 
product information in order to harmonise with other 
insulins from the same MAH. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
II, Labelling 
changes to the product’s posology: 
and PL 
Switching from NPH insulin to Levemir 
The first proposed change concerns addition of information 
with regards to dose reduction when switching from twice 
daily NPH insulin to once daily Levemir. A level of 20-30% 
reduction was proposed by the MAH in accordance with 
clinical practice. In support of this variation the MAH 
submitted 4 clinical trials in which a subset of subjects 
switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once daily Levemir 
and had their daily dose reduced by 20−30% according to 
protocol.  
The data presented revealed no increased risk of no 
reduction in the Levemir dose when switching, and therefore 
the relevance of the proposed changes are questioned.  More 
important is, however, that none of the four trials presented 
were designed to answer the question whether a dose 
reduction of Levemir (and to which extent), is appropriate 
when switching from twice daily NPH insulin to once daily 
Levemir. Thus the subjects were not randomized to different 
levels of dose-reduction of Levemir, but on levels of 
reduction chosen at the discretion of the investigators. 
Furthermore the studies were not powered to demonstrate 
differences between the groups of dose reduction. In fact the 
groups compared were small and in several cases there were 
so few events that comparison between the groups was 
difficult or inappropriate.  
Therefore the CHMP concluded that the changes related to 
the switching from NPH insulin to Levemir were not 
Page 8/23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approvable. The MAH agreed with the CHMP and did not 
introduce the proposed changes to the product information. 
3-0-3 titration algorithm 
The MAH further proposed to include a self-managed 3-0-3 
algorithm allowing patients to titrate their Levemir dose in 
steps of ±3 units every third day. In support of this change 
data from 3 randomised controlled clinical trials including 
6454 subjects with type 2 diabetes have been submitted.  
The data submitted demonstrates that a similar level of 
glycaemic control can be obtained with the use of the 
self-managed 3-0-3 titration algorithm compared to 
standard care titration. The use of the 3-0-3 regime is 
however associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia, 
although not major hypoglycemia, especially when using the 
more aggressive titration. Therefore a warning of 
hypoglycaemia has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Due to the benefits for the patients in terms of optimised 
self-care with this algorithm, the benefit risk ratio is however 
considered positive.

Overall, Levemir was as efficacious as NPH insulin when 
order to include the results from a clinical study 
and PL 
administered as basal insulin in combination with IAsp as 
comparing the efficacy and safety of Levemir versus 
NPH insulin in the treatment of pregnant women with 
type I diabetes and to make the information regarding 
lipodystrophy clearer. The Package Leaflet was 
proposed to be updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH deleted the version number of 
the RMP in Annex II in order to align the text to the 
current QRD template.

mealtime bolus insulin. Non-inferiority of IDet to NPH 
measured by HbA1c at Gestational Week (GW) 36 was 
shown. The upper limit of the 95% CI for the estimated mean 
treatment difference in HbA1c was below the pre-specified 
non-inferiority criterion of 0.4% for both the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS)Pregnant analysis set (IDet-NPH [95% CI];  0.06 
[-0.21;0.08]) and the Per Protocol (PP)Pregnant analysis set 
(IDet-NPH [95% CI]; -0.15 [-0.34;0.04]). IDet was not 
superior to NPH. With Estimated HbA1c values at GW 36 
follows: FASPregnant analysis set, IDet 6.27%, NPH 6.33% 
PPPregnant analysis set, IDet 6.22%, NPH 6.37%. 
Secondary outcome measures showed a trend toward 
superior glycaemic control with Levemir compared to NPH as 
basal insulin treatment.  
Some adverse outcomes including early foetal deaths and 
stillbirths, in combination with more serious adverse events 
in mothers such as pre-eclampsia and minor and major 
malformations in newborn children were numerically (but not 
statistically) more frequent in the Levemir group compared 
to the in the NPH group. 
It was concluded that a trial of this size cannot demonstrate 
minor, nevertheless clinically relevant, differences in the

safety outcomes investigated. Randomised clinical drug trials 
in pregnant women are rare, and the inherent difficulties in 
interpreting these studies from a safety perspective are well 
illustrated by this case. A number of uncertainties regarding 
the safety of Levemir in pregnant women still exist – mainly 
related to the low power for detecting differences between 
IDet and NPH insulin. Even if it cannot be excluded that the 
observed excess of a number of untoward events on Levemir 
may represent a signal for a true difference, the observed 
differences could also very well be chance findings. 
Consequently, it is concluded that treatment with Levemir 
can be considered during pregnancy, but that any potential 
benefit must be weighed against a possibly increased risk of 
an adverse pregnancy outcome.

to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for

CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the 
Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin

non-inferior to NPH insulin and insulin glargine in terms of 
glycaemic control. It also seems that insulin detemir as 
add-on to OADs might be associated with a smaller weight 
gain than the comparator insulins.  
Furthermore insulin detemir as add on to OAD was in general 
well tolerated. Especially the safety-profile in terms of 
hypoglycaemic events seems to be favourable. As 
demonstrated in previous trials application site disorders, 
lipodystrophy and potential allergic adverse events were 
reported with higher frequency for insulin detemir than for 
NHP insulin and also a rise in specific and cross-reacting 
antibody formation associated with insulin detemir treatment 
was observed in the insulin detemir groups whereas this was 
not the case to the same extent in the NPH group. However, 
these safety issues are known and not related to the 
concomitant use of OAD.  
Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been changed as 
well as the relevant section in the PL.

providers using the marketed product, the MAH considered 
that the product information for Levemir should be updated 
with new relevant information regarding the frequency of 
application site disorders, how this compares to NPH insulin 
and the rare need for discontinuation of Levemir after such 
reactions. Consequently, section 4.4 of the SPC was updated 
with a warning including more precise information regarding 
injection site reactions and the recommendation to rotate the 
injection site in order to prevent these reactions, as well as 
the necessity to discontinue the treatment on the rare 
occasion that this reactions are not resolved in a few days to 
a few weeks. Additionally, the sentence related to the 
frequency of injection site reactions in section 4.8 of the SPC 
was updated to reflect that these reactions are seen more 
frequently during the treatment with Levemir than with 
human insulin.

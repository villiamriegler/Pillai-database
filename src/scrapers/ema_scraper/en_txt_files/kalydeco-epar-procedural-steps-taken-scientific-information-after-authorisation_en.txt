VX17- 
661-116 (A Phase 3, Open-label, Rollover Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Long-term 
Treatment With Tezacaftor in Combination With 
Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Aged 6 
Years 
and Older, Homozygous or Heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR Mutation).  
Consequently the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and

rollover study designed to evaluate the long-term safety 
and tolerability of Tezacaftor in combination with Ivacaftor 
in CF subjects 6 years of age and older, homozygous or 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation. A total of 130 
subjects were enrolled. 
The treatment effects observed were generally consistent 
with those previously observed in CF subjects 6 through 11 
years of age with F/F and F/RF genotypes. In particular, the 
improvements observed in the parent studies (Studies 
113B and 115) in LCI2.5, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score and BMI z-
score were maintained or improved slightly over 96 weeks 
of treatment, and BMI improved during the treatment 
period of up to 120 weeks. Overall, the safety profile was in 
line with the known safety profile of Symkevi and Kalydeco. 
These results are added in section 5.1 of Symkevi SmPC, 
and the study is mentioned in section 4.8 of Symkevi SmPC 
and section 5.1 of Kalydeco SmPC.For more information,

transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. 
This application is based on the results of study 
VX18-445-106, a phase 3, open-label, multicentre 
study in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, with 
F/MF and F/F genotypes. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Packaged Leaflet is updated in accordance. Changes 
were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the 
current Agency/QRD template. RMP version 13.0 is

In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension liver 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) to add “liver injury” 
and “total bilirubin elevations” as new adverse 
reactions with a frequency unknown and reinforce 
corresponding existing warning following cases of 
liver injury and liver failure in the post marketing 
setting. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated 
accordingly. Kaftrio’s RMP is updated to version 3.1 
to upgrade hepatoxicity from a potentially serious 
risk to an important identified risk. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
failure leading to transplantation has been reported while 
receiving Ivacaftor/Tezacaftor/Elexacaftor (IVA/TEZ/ELX) in 
combination with ivacaftor. IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination 
with IVA should be used with caution in patients with pre 
existing advanced liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, portal 
hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to 
outweigh the risks. If used in these patients, they should 
be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment. 
Elevated transaminases are common in patients with CF 
and have been observed in some patients treated with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. In patients taking 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, these elevations 
have sometimes been associated with concomitant 
elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of transaminases 
(ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all 
patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months 
during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. 
For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase 
elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. 
In the event of ALT or AST >5 x the upper limit of normal 
(ULN), or ALT or AST >3 x ULN with bilirubin >2 x ULN, 
dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely 
followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the 
resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and 
risks of resuming treatment should be considered. 
Liver injury and total bilirubin elevations are added as new 
adverse reactions with a frequency “not known” as the 
frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. 
Kaftrio’s RMP is updated to version  3.1 to upgrade 
hepatoxicity from a potential serious risk to an important

but recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
There is a PASS category 1 ongoing. The fourth annual 
analysis will be completed by December 2016, with the 
final report submitted by December 2017. Long term safety 
is considered a key element to evaluate the benefit-risk 
balance of the product and therefore a second renewal is 
required.

reflected in the Summary of Product characteristics to 
update pharmacological properties and safety aspects of 
the product. In part 2, all patients received ivacaftor for 16 
additional weeks. The duration of continuous ivacaftor 
treatment was 24 weeks for patients randomised to part 1 
placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence and 16 weeks for 
patients randomised to part 1 ivacaftor/placebo treatment 
sequence. Similar results to part 1 were seen in part 2 of 
the study. At the 4 week follow up visit (4 weeks after 
dosing with ivacaftor ended), mean sweat chloride values 
for each group were trending to pre-treatment levels. The 
mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 
following 16 weeks (patients randomised to 
ivacaftor/placebo treatment sequence in part 1) of 
continuous ivacaftor treatment was 10.4% (13.2%). At the 
follow up visit, 4 weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, 
the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 
from part 2 week 16 was -5.9% (9.4%). For patients 
randomised to placebo/ivacaftor treatment sequence in

weeks of treatment with ivacaftor. At the follow up visit, 4 
weeks after ivacaftor dosing had ended, the mean (SD) 
absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from part 2 
week 16 was -7.4% (5.5%).

However, the high number of disease exacerbations in the 
ivacaftor group compared to placebo reported in one of the 
two studies is unexpected. Overall, the rates of CF 
exacerbations in the Ivacaftor group show a lack of efficacy 
upon off-label use since the enrolled subjects were patients 
without an approved CFTR mutation. The off-label use in 
patients without an approved CFTR mutation is an 
important potential risk in the ivacaftor RMP and the 
potential consequences of off-label use will be evaluated in 
each PSUR.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to include information from study VX12-770-016, a 
drug drug interaction (DDI) study with digoxin in 
order to fulfil MEA 006. Section 4.2 of the SmPC 
clarified by replacing “potent” by “strong“ when 
referring to inhibitors of CYP3A (ketoconazole, 
assessed in a phase 1, open-label, single-centre, non-
randomized study of multiple-dose oral ivacaftor (150 mg 
every 12 hours [q12h]) in combination with single-dose 
oral digoxin (0.25 mg) in healthy subjects. It can be agreed 
that the administration of Kalydeco increases digoxin 
exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-
gp. The MAH’s proposed changes to sections 4.2, 4.4 and

(itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, 
telithromycin and clarithromycin). In addition the 
MAH has submitted the following RMP commitments: 
report on modelling and simulation of reduced 
ivacaftor strength dosing to inform on the potential 
daily dosing recommendations in patients receiving 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment to inform on potential 
daily dosing recommendations in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment, and two years follow-up 
of subjects who prematurely discontinued in study

The potential daily dosing of ivacaftor in patients receiving 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, simulations of ivacaftor plasma 
concentrations after the administration of different ivacaftor 
daily dose with ketoconazole have also been provided. At 
present, no further investigations will be requested to the 
MAH and the authorised posology (150 mg twice weekly) is 
considered acceptable. 
In relation to the potential daily dose of ivacaftor in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment, data provided by 
the MAH refer to moderate hepatic impairment patients but 
they are not informative for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. As for the case of concomitant administration 
of CYP3A4 inhibitors no further investigations are requested 
to the MAH as ivacaftor strengths other than 150 mg are 
not currently marketed and no safety concerns have been 
identified with the use of ivacaftor at the authorised 
posology (150 mg every other day).  
Finally, an update is provided by the MAH regarding on 
discontinuations from study VX08-770-103. Results show 
that all patients on ivacaftor completed the study and that 
all patients discontinuing were on placebo.

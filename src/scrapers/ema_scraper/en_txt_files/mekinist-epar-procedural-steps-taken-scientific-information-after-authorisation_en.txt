revised guidance for the management of pyrexia resulted in

a reduction in the incidence of grade 3/4 pyrexia AEs, 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to update the recommendations for the 
management of pyrexia and to reflect the results of 
cross comparison clinical studies that used either the 
hospitalizations due to serious pyrexia, and pyrexia with 
complications. Based on this comparison, it is 
recommended that therapy should be interrupted 
(trametinib when used as monotherapy, and both 
trametinib and dabrafenib when used in combination;

existing or updated pyrexia management guidance; 
the Package Leaflets are updated accordingly. In 
addition, the WSA took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives and to include minor 
editorial changes in the Package Leaflets. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed 
amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics, and Package Leaflet. Amendments 
are also made to Annex II and Annex IIIA of Tafinlar 
product information to bring it in line with the QRD 
template version 10.2.

dabrafenib and trametinib when used in combination) if a 
patient’s temperature is ≥38oC. In case of recurrence, 
therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of 
pyrexia. Treatment with anti-pyretics such as ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol should be initiated. The use of 
oral corticosteroids should be considered in those instances 
in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. Patients should be 
evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection and if 
necessary treated in line with local practice. Trametinib, 
dabrafenib or both trametinib and dabrafenib, when used in 
combination, should be restarted if the patient is symptom 
free for at least 24 hours either (1) at the same dose level, 
or (2) reduced by one dose level, if pyrexia is recurrent 
and/or was accompanied by other severe symptoms 
including dehydration, hypotension or renal failure.

approximately 7 months longer than for dabrafenib 
monotherapy (25.8 months versus 18.7 months) with 5-
year survival rates of 32% for the combination versus 27% 
for dabrafenib monotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier OS curve 
appears to stabilise from 3 to 5 years. The 5-year overall 
survival rate was 40% (95% CI: 31.2, 48.4) in the 
combination arm versus 33% (95% CI: 25.0, 41.0) in the 
dabrafenib monotherapy arm for patients who had a normal

6.8, 23.1) in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm for patients 
with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level at baseline. 
From an OS analysis of study MEK116513 (COMBI-v) at 5 
years, the median OS for the combination arm was 
approximately 8 months longer than the median OS for 
vemurafenib monotherapy (26.0 months versus 17.8

combination versus 23% for vemurafenib monotherapy 
(Table 8, Figure 2). The Kaplan-Meier OS curve appears to

and dabrafenib have been evaluated in a multi-cohort, 
open-label, Phase II study in patients with BRAF V600 
mutant melanoma with brain metastases. A total of 125 
patients were enrolled into four cohorts. The primary 
endpoint of the study was intracranial response in Cohort A 
defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed 
intracranial response assessed by the investigator using 
modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) version 1.1. This cohort included patients with 
BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain 
metastases without prior local brain-directed therapy and 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The intracranial 
response rate in 76 patients in cohort A was 59% (95% CI: 
47.3-70.4). Due to small sample size reflected by wide 
95% CIs, the results in cohorts B, C, and D should be 
interpreted with caution. The safety profile observed in the 
study appears to be consistent with the integrated safety 
profile of the combination.

An updated OS analysis (15 February 2016) for study

Update of section 5.1 of the Mekinist (trametinib) 
and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) SmPC to include the 3-
years overall survival (OS) results from study 
MEK115306 (COMBI-d), a phase III, randomised, 
double-blinded study comparing the combination of 
dabrafenib and trametinib to dabrafenib  and placebo 
in first-line therapy for subjects with unresectable or 
metastatic BRAF V600/K mutation-positive cutaneous 
melanoma. 
Update of section 5.1 of the Mekinist (trametinib) 
and Tafinlar (dabrafenib) SmPC to include the 3-
years overall survival (OS) results from study 
MEK116513 (COMBI-v), a phase III, open-label, 2 
arm, randomised study comparing dabrafenib and 
trametinib combination therapy with vemurafenib 
monotherapy in BRAF V600 mutation-positive 
metastatic melanoma. In addition the MAH has taken 
the opportunity to align the storage

with the current wording in section 6.4 of the SmPC 
for Mekinist. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
MEK115306 (COMBI-d) demonstrated an improvement in 
OS for the combination compared with dabrafenib 
monotherapy. The 3-year OS estimate for the combination 
arm was greater than for dabrafenib monotherapy (44% 
vs. 32%, respectively). The median OS for the combination 
arm was approximately 8 months longer than the median 
OS for dabrafenib monotherapy (26.7 months versus 18.7 
months). These data also demonstrated a reduction in the 
risk of death (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.96) which was 
consistent with the primary OS analysis. An updated OS 
analysis (15 July 2016) for study MEK116513 (COMBI-v) 
demonstrated improvement in OS for the combination 
compared with vemurafenib monotherapy. The 3-year OS 
estimate was 45% for combination therapy and 31% for 
vemurafenib. The median OS for the combination arm was 
approximately 8 months longer than the median OS for 
vemurafenib monotherapy (26.1 months versus 17.8 
months). These data also demonstrated a reduction in the 
risk of death (HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.83) which was 
consistent with the primary OS analysis. These updated 3-
year OS data for these two phase III studies demonstrated 
that durable survival is achievable with dabrafenib and 
trametinib, that the beneficial effect of combining 
dabrafenib with trametinib is maintained over time and that 
long-term clinical tolerability is considered acceptable.

metabolised predominantly via deacetylation alone or with 
mono-oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation 
biotransformation pathways. CYP3A4 oxidation is 
considered a minor pathway of metabolism. The 
deacetylation is mediated by carboxyl-esterases (i.e. 
carboxylesterase 1b/c and 2) and may also be mediated by 
other hydrolytic enzymes.  
Trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, an inducer of CYP3A4 and an 
inhibitor of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, Pgp and BCRP. However, based on the 
low dose and low clinical systemic exposure relative to the 
in vitro potency of inhibition or induction values, trametinib 
is not considered to be a in vivo inhibitor or inducer of 
these enzymes or transporters, although transient 
inhibition of BCRP substrates in the gut may occur. 
Trametinib is not a substrate of CYP enzymes or of the 
transporters BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, 
MRP2, and MATE1. Trametinib is an in vitro substrate of 
BSEP and the efflux transporter P-gp. Although tramatinib 
exposure is unlikely to be affected by inhibition of BSEP, 
increased levels of trametinib upon strong inhibition of 
hepatic P-gp cannot be excluded.

to prevent dermatologic AEs and there is no information on 
the success of the treatment of AEs and the dose

have occurred.

Data) of the SmPC following the completion of a 
trametinib in vitro phototoxicity assay 
C.1.13 – Submission of the final reports from 
3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay at significantly higher 
concentrations than clinical exposures, indicating that there 
is low risk for phototoxicity to patients taking trametinib. 
M5 is highly bound to plasma proteins with a free fraction 
of 1.2%, which is comparable to the free fraction of

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
calculated contribution of M5 to the total pharmacological 
activity is 12%. This is less than the recommended cut-off 
value of 50%. Therefore, it is agreed that the enzyme(s) 
and transporter(s) involved in the elimination pathway(s) of 
M5 do not have to be further investigated.

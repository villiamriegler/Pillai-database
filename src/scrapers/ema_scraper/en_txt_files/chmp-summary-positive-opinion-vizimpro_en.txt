Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Vizimpro 
dacomitinib 
On 31 January 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Vizimpro, 
intended for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Pfizer Europe MA EEIG. 
Vizimpro will be available as film-coated tablets (15, 30 and 45 mg). The active substance of Vizimpro is 
dacomitinib, a pan-human EGFR (EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER4) inhibitor, with activity against mutated 
EGFR with deletions in exon 19 or L858R substitution in exon 21 (ATC code: L01XE47). 
The benefits with Vizimpro are its ability to increase progression free survival compared with gefitinib. The 
most common side effects are diarrhoea, rash, stomatitis, nail disorder, dry skin, decreased appetite, 
conjunctivitis, weight loss, alopecia, pruritus, increased transaminases and nausea. 
The full indication is: "Vizimpro, as monotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) activating mutations". It is proposed that Vizimpro be prescribed by physicians experienced 
in the use of anticancer therapies. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

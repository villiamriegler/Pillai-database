Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nalmefene, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Cases of “priapism” have been reported in nalmefene treated patients. Priapism is defined as an erection 
lasting more than 4 hours, and is divided into ischemic (painful) and non-ischemic (painless) type. Priapism 
is a condition demanding medical attention. Due to the number of cases of positive dechallenge (one 
erection increased, six priapism, one spontaneous erection) and some potential cases of positive rechallenge 
and due to the nature of the symptoms, where a certain amount of underreporting is to be expected, there 
is a potential causal relationship between priapism and nalmefene. Hence, Priapism should be added as a 
new adverse drug reaction with a frequency ‘unknown’ in section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of the 
Package Leaflet. 
Cumulatively, 305 adverse drug reactions in 264 cases in the system organ class skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders have been reported from post-marketing sources. Of those, 66 adverse drug reactions in 56 
cases were assessed as possibly or probably related to nalmefene. Reviewing in more detail the skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, it is concluded that a causal relationship between nalmefene and the 
reactions angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, rash, and erythema cannot be excluded. Hence, these terms 
should be added as new adverse drug reactions with a frequency ‘unknown’ in section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
section 4 of the Package Leaflet. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing nalmefene were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nalmefene the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nalmefene is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

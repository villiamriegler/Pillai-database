are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

adjuvanted influenza antigen on cardiovascular and 
respiratory of telemetered dogs (study MDS 
AA80120).                                                                                                                               
- Submission of a biodistribution study (study GSK-
CH-02-11) conducted in mice with the 3 components 
of the AS03 Adjuvant System radio-labelled ([14C]-
α-tocopherol, [14C]-squalene, and [3H]-polysorbate) 
to support the understanding of mode of action of 
AS03. 
- Submission of a GLP reproductive and 
developmental toxicity study (study HLS 
GVB/007/063710) conducted to evaluate the effect 
of AS03 on embryo-fetal and peri- and post-natal 
development in Crl:CD® (SD) IGS BR rats following

Based upon the data that have become available since the

Page 11/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Adjupanrix 
remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to 
be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
Considering the theoretical possibility that the AS03 
adjuvant or some other vaccine component common to the 
MAH’s pandemic influenza vaccines has a role in the 
development of narcolepsy, this event is considered a 
potential risk for Adjupanrix until data awaited from 
epidemiological and mechanistic studies allow for further 
discussion on whether this risk may be applied to AS03-
containing products other than Pandemrix H1N1. 
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
1-yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Adjupanrix, 
which requires the submission of 1-yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years’ time.

countries have indicated an increased risk of narcolepsy 
with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with 
unvaccinated individuals. In children/adolescents (aged up 
to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional 1.4 
to 8 cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available 
epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 years have 
indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 
vaccinated subjects. These data suggest that the excess 
risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination. 
There is currently no evidence to indicate that Adjupanrix

Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order 
to extend up to 12 months the interval between the 
two doses based on data from study D-PAN-H5N1-

included in section 5.1 of the SmPC were introduced.

additional efficacy and safety data from adult subjects in 
Study 012 who received A/Vietnam and were subsequently 
boosted with A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia at 6 or 12 months. 
The immune response achieved with boosting at 12 months 
was comparable to that achieved with boosting at 6 
months. This applies to both single and double priming 
regimens, and cross-protection for heterologous strains. 
There was no evidence of a waning of the priming effect 
over the 12 month period.  The safety data support the 
favourable benefit-risk relationship for the regimens 
studied. The amendments proposed for the SmPC and PL 
were agreed.

Pandemrix, as requested by the CHMP in the 4th 
PSUR assessment for the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 
vaccine Marketing Authorisations. The PL is updated 
post marketing experience with Pandemrix in SmPC 
sections 4.6 and 4.8, and to align the Product Information 
with wording in the Pandemrix and Pumarix Product

Based on a review of literature and a search in the global 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of

This was an application for a group of variations 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
include a warning on psychogenic syncope based on 
the available safety data. The PL was proposed to be 
updated in accordance. In addition, the company 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the PL of Pumarix, Ambirix, 
safety database performed by the MAH, the CHMP 
recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope 
to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. 
The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred 
around the age of 15 years, with females having more than 
twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with 
secondary injuries were reported most frequently in 
children and adolescents.  
Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it 
was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an 
undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as 
such events can result in injury, and may not have

of the SmPC to include persistence/booster data 
from 
- Study H5N1-009/022/023 (conducted in children 3-

(including booster) were considered to be in line with the 
cumulative experience of the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines. 
There are no new concerns in view of immunogenicity and 
the reflection of the longer-term data from these studies in 
the SmPC was considered appropriate. 
In view of safety, no new concerns have arisen from these 
data that would require an update of the Product

distinguish any one of the three formulations (Half HA/Half 
and 4). This clinical study is conducted in children 
aged 3 to 9 years, to evaluate the immunogenicity, 
reactogenicity and safety of three formulations of 
AS03 adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine, given following a 
two dose schedule on Days 0 and 21. The MAH is 
also taking the opportunity of this procedure to

the Pharmacovigilance System as requested by

However, the administration of a higher HA dose and, 
especially, the full adult dose, demonstrated advantages in 
terms of several HI and NA immune parameters. In 
particular, use of the adult dose gave improved HI 
responses to the heterologous strain and higher NA GMTs. 
Concerning safety, the greatest differences between the 
H5N1 vaccine and control groups in this study were seen 
when the adult dose was administered. Despite the greater 
local and general reactogenicity with the adult dose uptake 
of the second dose was very high and only four subjects did 
not complete both doses in the entire study. In addition the 
data do not indicate that higher reactogenicity was 
associated with SAEs. 
Overall, a difference in the frequency of adverse reactions 
between half adult and adult doses was observed after each 
dose. However, the administration of a second half adult or 
an adult dose did not enhance the reactogenicity, except 
for rates of general symptoms which were higher after the 
second adult dose.

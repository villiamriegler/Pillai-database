1.  Scientific discussion
1.1.  Introduction
Saxagliptin  is  an  orally  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4).  DPP-4 
inhibitors  act  by  enhancing  the  levels  of  active  incretin  hormones.  These  hormones,  including 
glucagon-like  peptide-1  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide,  are  released  from  the 
intestine in response to a meal and are part of an endogenous system involved in glucose homeostasis.
Saxagliptin was approved for marketing in the EU on October 1st 2009 and currently has therapeutic 
indications for second line use in combination with metformin, a PPAR-γ agonist, or a sulphonylurea in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The MAH submitted with this application the following extension to the indication:
Onglyza is indicated as add on combination therapy in adult patients aged 18 years and older with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. The applicant is seeking to add to the list of combination therapies, the 
following: ‘to improve glycaemic control in combination with insulin (with or without metformin), 
when this regimen alone with diet and exercise does not provide adequate glycaemic control’.
The variation submitted is the following:

Information on Paediatric requirements
Pursuant to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  N°  1901/2006  as  amended, the  application  included  an  EMA 
decision (P/97/2011) for the following condition(s):

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  At the time of submission of this application, 
the PIP is not yet completed as some measures were deferred.
1.2.  Clinical aspects
The clinical program to evaluate the anti-hyperglycaemic activity of saxagliptin as add-on combination 
therapy with insulin in T2DM began with the initiation of the Phase 3b study CV181057 (study 057), a 
randomised,  parallel,  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicentre 
the  anti-
hyperglycaemic activity of saxagliptin 5 mg added on as combination therapy with insulin or to insulin 
in combination with metformin in subjects with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control. The 24-
week double-blind ST treatment period was intended to provide efficacy and safety data to support the 
proposed indication; during the evalution of this extension of indication application, efficacy and safety 
results from the long term extension period of study 057 became available and were provided by the 
applicant,  but  no  additional  efficacy and  safety  aspects  did  emerge  beyond  the  ST  treatment results.
The main study of this application is study 057, a supportive study relevant for this application (study 
D1680C00007)  is  summarized  at  the  end  of  this  section.  In  general  the  guideline  in  the  therapeutic 
area was followed.

Methods
Study design
Study  057  was  a  Phase  3b,  randomized,  two-arm,  parallel,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled
multicenter  trial  comparing  the  antihyperglycaemic  activity  of  saxagliptin  added  on  as combination 
therapy  with  insulin  or  to  insulin  in  combination  with  metformin  in  subjects  with T2DM  who  had 
inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c  ≥  7.5%  and  ≤  11.0%)  while  on  a  stable dose  of  insulin  (≥  30 
units/day,  ≤  150  units/day)  or  a  stable  dose  of  insulin  (≥  30  units/day,  ≤ 150  units/day)  in 
combination  with  a  stable  dose  of  metformin  for  at  least  8  weeks.  The  ST treatment  period  was  24 
weeks.  Randomization  was  2:1  (saxagliptin:  placebo),  and  was stratified  by  metformin  use  at 
enrolment. The proportion of subjects using metformin was capped at 75% of total sample, to ensure 
sufficient participation of those on insulin monotherapy. The usual clinical dose of 5 mg once daily of 
saxagliptin was administered in this study. See Figure 1.

Figure 1: design of study 057
Study population
The population of study 057 consisted of male and female subjects with T2DM, aged between 18 and 
78  years  (inclusive),  who  had  inadequate  glycaemic  control  (defined  as  HbA1c  levels  ≥  7.5%  and  ≤ 
11.0%)  and  were  on  insulin  alone  [(≥  30  units/day,  ≤  150  units/day)  with  ≤  20%  variation  in  total 
daily dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening] or in combination with metformin.
Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint in study 057 was the change in HbA1c level from baseline until Week 24 
(or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24, if no Week 24 measurement was available or 
before rescue). 
Secondary endpoints assessed at week 24 were: 
• Change from baseline in AUC from 0 to 180 minutes for postprandial glucose response to an MTT;
• Change from baseline in the 120-minute postprandial glucose value during an MTT;
• Change from baseline in FPG;
• Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined as HbA1c < 7%);
• Change from baseline in mean total daily insulin dose based on information recorded on the subjects’ 
daily diary.
Other  efficacy  endpoints were  the  changes  from  baseline  to  week  24  for  the  postprandial  glucagon 
AUC, postprandial C-peptide AUC, fasting glucagon, and fasting C-peptide.
Statistical analysis
With a total of 390 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive saxagliptin 5 mg (260 subjects) or placebo (130 
subjects), there was 90% power to detect a difference in A1C mean change from baseline to Week 24 
of 0.35% between saxagliptin and placebo, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0%. Assuming a drop 
out  rate  of  10%,  a  total  of 435  subjects  (290  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  arm  and  145 
subjects in the placebo treatment arm) were to be randomized.
Analysis populations
The  Lead-in  Subjects  Data  Set  included  data  collected  from  all  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of 
placebo lead-in study medication.
The  Randomized  Subjects  Data  Set  consisted  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of 
double-blind treatment.
The  Evaluable  Subjects  Data  Set  (called  the  “Secondary  Efficacy  Data  Set”  in  the  protocol)  was  a 
subset  of  the  Randomized  Subjects  Data  Set.  It  consisted  of  subjects  who  did  not  deviate  from  the

terms  of  the  protocol  in  ways  which  could  have  affected  the  primary  endpoint  in  a  relevant  way 
(“relevant  deviation”),  as  specified  in  the  pre-defined  protocol  deviation  list  prior  to  unblinding  the 
study. Only the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in A1C, demographics, and baseline 
diabetes-related characteristics were to be analyzed using the Evaluable Subjects Data Set, and only if 
>10% of the subjects in any treatment group were found to have a relevant deviation.
The  Treated  Subjects  Data  Set  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of double-blind 
study drug during the short-term treatment period.
Efficacy analysis
In calculating primary and secondary endpoints in rescued subjects, endpoints (except mean total daily 
dose of insulin [MTDDI]) were analyzed by last observation carried forward (LOCF), as follows:

Rescue because of increased fasting plasma glucose: For subjects rescued because of increased 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, measurements obtained after rescue were not considered in 
the  analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints.  Rather,  the  last observations  prior  to 
rescue were carried forward (LOCF).
Rescue because of increased insulin use: For subjects rescued because of persistently increased 
use of insulin (MTDDI exceeding by > 20% the subject’s baseline MTDDI), the last observations 
prior  to  rescue  and  prior  to  the  visit  with  the  20%  increase  in  MTDDI  were carried  forward 
(LOCF).

Primary endpoint
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24.  The primary 
efficacy  analysis  was  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  of  that  endpoint  (LOCF), with  treatment 
group and metformin use at enrolment as fixed effects, and baseline value as a covariate in the model. 
It  included  subjects  in  the  Randomized  Data  Set  who  had  HbA1c assessments  at  baseline  and  post-
baseline (excluding any post-rescue assessments). Within the framework of the ANCOVA model, point 
estimates  and  95%  CIs  for  the  mean  changes between  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  the 
placebo treatment group were calculated. Each comparison of the saxagliptin treatment group versus
the placebo treatment group was performed using a t test at α=0.05 level. The treatment-by-baseline 
interaction was tested and distributional assumptions were assessed.
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis, the modeling of the primary efficacy analysis 
was repeated in a number of sensitivity analyses.
The  statistical  testing  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  proceeded  in  a sequential 
manner to control the overall type I (family-wise) error rate at the 0.05 level. The significance or non-
significance  of  the  treatment  comparisons  for  the  primary  efficacy endpoint  determined  which 
statistical tests were performed to compare treatments for the secondary efficacy endpoints.
Overall,  the  design  of  the  study  was  considered  adequate  to  evaluate  the  value  of  saxagliptin  when 
added  to  insulin.  Primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were adequate The  mean  dose  of  >1800  mg  is 
acceptable. The chosen superiority margin of 0.35% was considered rather small by CHMP but found to 
be acceptable in this clinical context.
Results
Disposition of subjects
Disposition of subjects is shown in Figure 2. Of the 500 subjects who entered the lead-in period, 45 did 
not enter the double-blind treatment period, including 2 subjects who were randomized but not treated. 
The most common reason for subjects discontinuing during the lead-in period was that the subjects did 
not  meet  study  criteria  (30  subjects,  6.0%). Of  the  455  subjects  who  were  randomized  and  treated 
with  double-blind  therapy, 402  (88%)  subjects  completed  24-weeks  of  treatment.    A  total  of  304 
subjects were randomized to saxagliptin and 151 were randomized to placebo. Discontinuations during 
the  short-term  treatment  period  were similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (11.8%  and  11.3%, 
respectively).  The  most  common reason  for  discontinuation  from  the  short-term  treatment  period  in 
the saxagliptin group was subject withdrew consent (13 subjects, or 4.3%). The most common reasons 
for discontinuation  from  the  placebo  group  were  subject  withdrew  consent  (5  subjects,  or 3.3%)  and 
lost to follow-up (5 subjects, or 3.3%). Lack of efficacy led to discontinuation in 5 subjects (3, or 1.0%, 
in the saxagliptin group and 2, or 1.3%, in the placebo group).

Demographics and baseline characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The 2 treatment groups 
were  generally  well  balanced  for  demographic  and  baseline  diabetes characteristics.  Of  the  455
randomized  and  treated  subjects,  41.3%  were  men  and  78.0%  were  white;  the  mean  age  was 57.2 
years (range 18 to 77 years). Most (84.6%) subjects were diagnosed with T2DM ≥5 years before the 
start  of  the  study  with  a  mean  duration  of  diabetes  of  12.0  years.  The  mean  baseline  HbA1c  was 
8.66% (range, 7.3% to 11.4%).
Demographic  characteristics  were  also  examined  for  the  314  subjects  taking  metformin and  the  141 
subjects not taking metformin. Among subjects taking metformin 41.7% were male, 76.4% were white, 
and  the  mean  age  was  56.7  years  (range  18  to  77  years). Among  subjects  not  taking  metformin
40.4%  were  male, 81.6%  were  white,  and  the  mean  age  was  58.4  years  (range  29  to  77  years). 
Overall,  baseline diabetes  characteristics  were  generally  similar  between  those  taking  metformin  and 
those not taking concomitant metformin.

Overall, there were no differences between treatment groups in percentages of patients who completed 
the  study  and  percentage  of  withdrawals.  In  addition,  there  were  no  relevant  differences  between 
treatment  groups  in  demographics  and  baseline  disease  characteristics.  Most  patients  were  White 
(78%),  20%  were  from  North  America,  20%  from  Latin  America,  40%  from  Europe,  11%  from  Asia. 
Baseline disease characteristics were typical for T2DM patients.
Primary efficacy endpoint
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  study  057  are  summarized  by  treatment group  in
Table  5.  Overall,  study  057  showed  that  saxagliptin  added  on  to  insulin  (or  to  insulin  combined  with
metformin)  improves  glycaemic  control  in  subjects  with  T2DM.  There  was  a statistically  significant 
reduction  in  adjusted  mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24 in  the  saxagliptin  treatment 
group compared with placebo (p<0.0001). The adjusted mean change from baseline was -0.73% (95% 
CI [-0.83, -0.62]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.32% (95% CI [-0.46, -0.17]) for placebo. 
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.41% (95% CI [-0.59, 
-0.24]).

Changes over time are shown in Figure 3. For saxagliptin, a reduction from baseline was observed at 
Weeks 4 and 8 and became progressively greater to Week 12; this reduction was maintained through
Week  24.  For  placebo,  smaller  reductions  were  observed  from  Weeks  4  to  12  and  values stabilized 
after that point through Week 24.

Similar  results  were  obtained  when  examining  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  results  at  Week 24 
regardless  of  rescue.  The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  HbA1c  (regardless  of  rescue) 
was  - 0.76%  (95%  CI  [-0.87,  -0.66])  for  the saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  -0.40%  (95%  CI  [-
0.54,  -0.25])  for  placebo.  The  difference  in the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo 
was -0.37% (95% CI [-0.54, -0.19]).
When examining HbA1c data obtained prior to a 10% change in insulin dose, there was a reduction in 
adjusted  mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  in  the  saxagliptin treatment  group 
compared with placebo. The adjusted mean change from baseline was -0.71% (95% CI [-0.81, - 0.61]) 
for the saxagliptin treatment group and -0.25% (95% CI [-0.40, -0.11]) for placebo. The difference in 
the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.46% (95% CI [-0.63, -0.29]). These 
results were consistent with those obtained for the main analysis.
Results  for  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  were  similar  in  subjects  with and 
without metformin use at baseline. Among subjects with metformin use at baseline, the adjusted mean 
change from baseline was -0.79% (95% CI [-0.91,  -0.67]) for the saxagliptin treatment group and -
0.38% (95% CI [-0.55, -0.21]) for placebo. The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline 
versus  placebo  was -0.41%  (95%  CI  [-0.62,  -0.20]).  Among  subjects  with  no  metformin  use  at 
baseline,  the adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.67%  (95%  CI  [-0.84,  - 0.49])  for  the 
saxagliptin treatment  group  and  -0.25%  (95%  CI  [-0.51,  0.00])  for  placebo.  The  difference  in  the
adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -0.41% (95% CI [-0.72, -0.10]).
Secondary endpoints
Results for secondary endpoints were in line with those of the primary endpoint.
At  Week  24,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  change  from  baseline  in  postprandial 
glucose  AUC  during  an  MTT  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  compared  with  placebo  (p=0.0011) 
(Table  5).  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  -3829.8 
(95%  CI  [-6122.4,  -1537.1]).  There  was  also  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  120-minute 
postprandial  glucose  concentration  when  examining  results  for  change  from  baseline  to  Week  24 
(p=0.0016) (Table 5). The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was -
23.0 mg/dL (-1.3 mmol/L) (95% CI [-37.2, -8.7 mg/dL; -2.1, -0.5 mmol/L]).

Saxagliptin was associated with a numerically greater decrease in adjusted mean change from baseline 
in  FPG  compared  with  placebo  (-4.02  mg/dL,  -0.2  mmol/L),  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant  (p=  0.3958;  95%  CI  [-13.32,  5.28  mg/dL;  -0.7,  0.3  mmol/L])(Table  5).  When  examining 
data obtained prior to a 10% change in insulin dose in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the reduction in 
adjusted mean change in FPG from baseline to Week 24 was greater in the saxagliptin treatment group 
compared  with  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus 
placebo was -12.94 mg/dL (-0.7 mmol/L) (95% CI [-22.27, -3.61 mg/dL; -1.2, -0.2 mmol/L]).
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  saxagliptin  achieved  a  therapeutic  glycaemic  response 
(defined  as  HbA1c  <  7.0%)  adjusted  for  baseline  HbA1c  relative  to  placebo  (17.3%  versus  6.7%) 
(Table  1).  The  difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  <  7%  versus  placebo  was 
10.6%  (95%  CI  [4.7,  16.5]).  The  absence  of  statistical  significance  on  the  prior  secondary  endpoint 
(FPG) precluded formal assessment of this secondary endpoint for statistical significance. However, the 
95%  CI  for  the  difference  for  the  proportions  in  the  2  treatment  groups  did  not  include  0.  The 
difference  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  achieving  HbA1c  <  7%  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
than the placebo group regardless of whether subjects were receiving metformin (saxagliptin: 19.4%; 
placebo: 7.8%) or were not receiving metformin (saxagliptin: 12.8%; placebo: 4.3%).
Mean total daily insulin dose increased from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in both treatment groups. The 
adjusted mean increase from baseline in MTDDI was lower in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units; 95% CI 
[0.3, 3.0]) than the placebo group (5.0 units; 95% CI [3.1, 6.9]) at Week 24 (Table 5). The difference 
in the adjusted mean change from baseline in the total daily dose of insulin  versus placebo was -3.3 
units  (95%  CI  [-5.6,  -1.1]).  The  absence  of  statistical  significance  on  the  prior  secondary  endpoint 
(FPG) precluded formal assessment of this secondary endpoint for statistical significance. However, the 
95% CI for the difference in the insulin dose in the 2 treatment groups did not include 0.
Other efficacy endpoints
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting C-peptide at Week 24 (saxagliptin 
versus placebo) was 0.05 ng/mL (95% CI [-0.18, 0.29]).
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in postprandial C-peptide AUC at Week 24 
(saxagliptin versus placebo) was 5.1 ng*min/mL (95% CI [-50.1, 60.4]).
The difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting glucagon at Week 24 (saxagliptin 
versus placebo) was -4.53 pg/mL (95% CI [-10.01, 0.95]).
The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  postprandial  glucagon  AUC  at Week  24 
(saxagliptin versus placebo) was -1640.2 pg*min/mL (95% CI [-2649.1, -631.2]).
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  discontinued  for  lack  of  glycaemic  control  or  who  were  rescued for 
meeting pre-specified glycaemic criteria during the short-term treatment period was numerically lower 
in the saxagliptin group at every time point. At Week 24, 22.7% of the saxagliptin treated patients and 
31.8% of the placebo treated patients had discontinued (difference -9.1%; 95% CI [-18.7, 0.7]).
Physical measurements
Overall,  there  were  numerical  increases  in  mean  body  weight  (LOCF)  across  both  treatment groups. 
Baseline  mean  body  weight  was 87.71  kg  for  saxagliptin  treated  subjects  and  86.21  kg  for  placebo 
treated subjects. At Week 24, the adjusted mean change in body weight (LOCF) was 0.39 kg (95% CI 
[0.10, 0.69]) for the saxagliptin group and 0.18 kg (95% CI [-0.23, 0.59]) for the placebo group. The
difference  in  the  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  versus  placebo  was  0.22  kg  (95%  CI [-0.27, 
0.70]).
Mean BMI values also increased (LOCF) across both treatment groups. Baseline mean BMI was 32.58 
kg/m2 for saxagliptin treated subjects and 31.76 kg/m2 for placebo treated subjects. At Week 24, the 
adjusted mean change in BMI (LOCF) was 0.16 kg/m2 (95% CI [0.05, 0.27]) for the saxagliptin group 
and 0.05  kg/m2  (95%  CI  [-0.11,  0.20])  for  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  the  adjusted  mean
change from baseline versus placebo was 0.11 kg/m2 (95% CI [-0.07, 0.30]).
Summary of main outcome parameters
Overall,  both  primary  and  secondary  parameters  indicate  that  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients 
treated with insulin was effective. The results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use 
at  baseline.However,  the  effect  was  modest.  For  HbA1c,  the  adjusted  mean  difference  from  placebo 
was  -0.41.  This  was  also  expressed  in  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  therapeutic  glycaemic 
response (HbA1c < 7%): 17.3 vs 6.7% for the saxagliptin and insulin group, respectively. Even though 
Assessment report 
12
the  treatment  effect  was  modest,  the  study  demonstrated  that  saxagliptin  +  insulin  produced  a 
statistically  significant  reduction  in  HbA1c  compared  to  placebo  +  insulin  after  24  weeks  of  double-
blind treatment, with a treatment difference of 0.41%.
The placebo group had a reduction in A1C of 0.32%, likely attributable to dietary and exercise factors, 
some of which may have extended beyond randomisation. 
A  small  increase  in  body  weight  was  seen  in  both  groups  (0.39  kg  vs  0.18  kg  in  the  saxagliptin  vs 
placebo group, respectively).
During  the  evalution  of  this  extension  of  indication  application,  efficacy  results  from  the  long  term 
extension period of study 057 became available and were provided by the applicant and did show that 
reductions  from  baseline  A1C  seen  in  the  saxagliptin  +  insulin  group  compared  with  the  placebo  + 
insulin group were sustained to Week 52; results were consistent for subjects using metformin and not 
using metformin at baseline. Increases from baseline in mean total daily dose of insulin were seen in 
both treatment groups through Week 52, with a numerically smaller increase in the saxagliptin group.
Both treatment groups experienced small numerical increases in weight, of similar magnitude, through 
Week 52.
Clinical studies in special populations
No strong interactions (p < 0.1) of treatment by subgroup were noted for subgroup analyses of change 
from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  by  metformin  use,  baseline  HbA1c,  duration  of  diabetes, 
race, gender, age, BMI, or geographic region (see Table 6).

For some subgroups (duration of diabetes ≤1.5 yr and race “other”) the effect in the saxagliptin group 
was smaller than in the placebo group. However, in these subgroups the number of patients was small 
and the 95% CIs were large.
With  respect  to  the  geographic  region,  the  difference  from  control  was  -0.29  in  Europe,  vs  -0.64  in 
Asia,  -0.49  in  North  America  and  -0.63  in  Latin  America.  There  is  a  large  difference  in  response  to 
placebo,  with  no  effect  in  Asia,  and  the  largest  effect  (-0.52)  in  Latin  America.  This  was  raised  as  a 
concern  by  the  CHMP,  and  in  response  the  MAH  has  submitted  further  details  on  the  number  of 
European  patients  recruited  from  the  EU  and  the  number  of  patients  outside  the  EU.  The  efficacy 
results  of  these  both  groups  are  compared.  Although  the  placebo-corrected  mean  reductions  were 
numerically  smaller  for  EU  subjects  than  in  the  overall  population  (also  in  the  individual  geographic 
regions  as  presented  in  the  ST  CSR)  and  the  95%  CI  of  the  placebo-corrected  reduction  was  wide, 
there  was  no  evidence  of  a  treatment-by-region  interaction  in  this  new  analysis  (p=0.262).  A 
difference  in  placebo-corrected  response  between  Asian  and  European  patients  or  Asian  and  White 
patients had previously also been observed with another DPP-4 inhibitor.

N/A
Supportive study: Study D1680C00007 (study 07)
To supplement study 057, this submission also includes data from study D1680C00007 (study 07), a 
Phase 3b clinical study that investigated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of saxagliptin 2.5 mg 
compared to placebo in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment (moderate, severe, 
and  end-stage).  Study  07  was  designed  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  saxagliptin  2.5  mg  once  daily  in 
renally impaired subjects with type 2 diabetes is effective and well tolerated. Because the intent was to 
evaluate the effects of the selected dose of saxagliptin in a subject population as broad as possible to 
reflect general treatment practices, subjects receiving treatment with oral antidiabetics (OADs) and/or 
insulin were permitted to enrol in the study.  Results of this study have previously been submitted and 
assessed  in  regulatory  applications  introducing  the  2.5  mg  strength  and  posology  in  patients  with 
moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (EMEA/H/C/10039/X/04-II/08).  In  short:  Study  07  was  a  12-
week  study  with  a  40  week  extension.  At  baseline,  the  majority  of  subjects  was  using  other

antihyperglycaemic  medications,  including  insulin  and  oral  blood  glucose  lowering  drugs.  Numbers  of 
patients using insulin were 70/85 (82.4%) in the saxagliptin group versus 55/85 subjects (64.7%) in 
the  placebo  group.  Mean  insulin  dose  was  50.73  IU  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  41.68  IU  in  the 
placebo  group.  At  week  12,  HbA1c  was  reduced  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  reduction  was 
statistically  significantly  greater  with  saxagliptin  group  than  with  placebo.  Insulin  dose  decreased 
slightly from baseline in the saxagliptin group but remained relatively constant in the placebo group. In 
general, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was well tolerated. In subjects receiving insulin, the incidence of AEs and 
SAEs  was  higher  than  in  patients  not  treated  with  insulin  (AEs:  77.5%  vs  64.3%  in  the  saxagliptin 
group insulin vs non-insulin; 70.2% vs 71.4% in the placebo group insulin vs non-insulin. SAEs: 28.2% 
vs  21.4%  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  31.6%  vs  21.4%  in  the  placebo  group).  In  these  groups  too, 
incidence in the saxagliptin group was higher as compared with placebo. The CHMP concluded that the 
benefit/risk of this study and the Type II variation was positive. Results of study 07 will not be further 
discussed in this Assessment Report.
3.3.2 Conclusion on the clinical efficacy
The addition of saxagliptin to patients treated with insulin resulted in a modest decrease of HbA1c. The 
maximum was reached at week 12 and was maintained trough week 24. The mean placebo corrected 
decrease was -0.41%. Secondary endpoints were in line with this result.
Results were similar in subjects with and without metformin use at baseline.
In both groups a relative large percentage of patients discontinued because of lack of glycaemic control 
(22.7% vs 32.8 in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively).
There  were  differences  in  effect  according  to  geographic  region.  These  differences  were  due  to  a 
difference  in  placebo  response,  with  no  effect  of  placebo  in  Asian  patients  and  the  largest  effect  in 
Latin  America  patients.  In  European  patients  the  placebo-corrected  decrease  in  HbA1c  was  very 
modest: -0.29%. However, there was no evidence of a treatment-by-region interaction in an additional 
analysis  requested  by  CHMP  during  the  evaluation.  Also,  a  difference  in  placebo-corrected  response 
between  Asian  and  European  patients  or  Asian  and  White  patients  has  been  observed  with  another 
DPP-4 inhibitor. In study 057, there was no significant difference in placebo-corrected HbA1c between 
White  patients  and  Asian  patients,  perhaps  because  of  the  inclusion  of  Latin  American  patients  who 
had both a large response on placebo and on saxagliptin.
1.4.  Clinical safety
Patient exposure
In  study  057,  a  total  of  455  subjects  (saxagliptin:  304;  placebo:  151)  received  double-blind  study
medication  during  the  24-week  ST  period.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  to study  medication  was 
161.6 days (standard deviation [SD] 31.06) in the saxagliptin group and 161.9 days (SD 29.46) in the 
placebo group. A total of 402 of these 455 subjects (88.4%) completed 24 weeks of treatment.
See also Figure 2 and Table 1.
Adverse events
Saxagliptin  added  to  insulin  therapy  was  well  tolerated  with  a  safety  profile  comparable  to that  of 
placebo.  The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  similar between  the  2 
treatment groups (Table 7). 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  during  the  short-term  treatment  period  (prior  to  rescue), excluding  all 
events  of  hypoglycaemia,  was  52.3%  in  subjects  receiving  saxagliptin compared  with  55.6%  in 
subjects receiving placebo. Table 8 presents AEs (excluding events of hypoglycaemia) that occurred in 
≥  2%  of  subjects.  In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  3  most  common  events  were  urinary tract  infection, 
upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo group  the  3  most  common 
events were influenza, urinary tract infection, and pain in extremity. When examining AEs regardless of 
rescue  status,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs,  excluding all  events  of  hypoglycaemia,  was  53.9%  in 
subjects  receiving  saxagliptin  compared  with 57.6%  in  subjects  receiving  placebo.  This  incidence 
reflects the addition of 8 subjects (5 in the saxagliptin group and 3 in the placebo group) with AEs post 
rescue  (and  not  prior  to  rescue).  The  types  of  AEs  reported  regardless  of  rescue status  were 
comparable  to  those  noted  prior  to  rescue;  most  were  unlikely  or  unrelated  to study  drug  treatment 
and mild or moderate in intensity.

The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  similar between  the  2  treatment 
groups. The safety profile of saxagliptin was comparable to that of placebo. There were no unexpected 
adverse events.
Serious adverse events and deaths
One  death,  as  a  result  of  myocardial  infarction,  was  reported  during  the  24-week  ST  period. The 
investigator judged the event of myocardial infarction to be very severe in intensity and considered the 
event not to be related to the study medication. The patient had a history of cardiovascular disease.
Other  SAEs  (prior  to  rescue) were  reported  for  a  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  the saxagliptin  (12 
patients, 3.9%) and placebo (6 patients, 4.0%) groups. No SAE was reported for more than 1 subject 
during  the  ST  treatment  period  and  most  SAEs  were considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  not  likely 
related or unrelated to study drug treatment.
Assessment report 
17
Two  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  had  SAEs  that  were  considered  to  be  related  to  study drug 
treatment:  1  subject  with  chest  pain  and  1  subject  with  2  episodes  of  severe hypoglycaemia.  Three 
saxagliptin-treated  subjects  and  no  placebo-treated subjects  had cardiovascular-related  SAEs  prior  to 
rescue:  myocardial  infarction  that  led  to  death  (see “Deaths”  above),  acute  coronary  syndrome,  and 
acute  myocardial  infarction.  There  was  1 subject  with  a  SAE  of  breast  cancer  post-rescue  leading  to 
discontinuation during the ST treatment period in the saxagliptin group.
There  were  3  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group  with  a  cardiac  event. 
One of these patients died. All patients had a history of cardiovascular disease or hypercholesterolemia. 
No action was taken in relation to the study drug. None of these events was considered related to the 
study  drug  by  the  investigator.  Although  these  cases  are  serious,  there  is  insufficient  information  to 
draw  a  conclusion  on  any  relation  with  saxagliptin.  In  any    case,  cardiac  event  are  closely  monitored 
and  reported  in  6 monthly  periodc  safety  update  reports.  Moreover,  the  MAH is  conducting  a  5-year 
cardiovascular  outcomes  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  the  incidence  of  CV  death, 
myocardial infarction, or ischaemic stroke in subjects with T2DM.
Adverse events leading to discontinuation
Seven  subjects  (4  [1.3%]  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  3  [2.0%]  in  the  placebo  group) discontinued 
from  study  due  to  AEs  during  the  ST  treatment  period  (prior  to  rescue). Additionally,  1  subject 
discontinued due to an AE that began during the lead-in period (creatinine renal clearance decreased. 
In the saxagliptin group, there were two patients in the SOC “investigations” (glomerular filtration rate 
decreased), one patients with “gastrointestinal disorders” (diarrhoea, dyspepsia), and one patient with 
hypoglycaemia.  Hypoglycaemia began  on  Day 125  and  resolved  within  5  days.  In  the  placebo  group, 
there  were  two  patients  in  the  SOC  “investigations”  (blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased,  blood
creatinine increased, creatinine renal clearance decreased), and one with upper abdominal pain.  Most 
AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported to be of mild or moderate intensity. 
When examining subjects regardless of rescue status, there was 1 additional subject in the saxagliptin 
group with an AE that led to discontinuation from study. This subject had a post-rescue SAE of breast 
cancer (considered by the investigator not to be related to study medication).
Adverse events of special interest
AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  were  recorded  and  analysed  separately  from  other  AEs.  Confirmed
hypoglycaemia  was  defined  by  a  fingerstick  glucose  value  ≤50  mg/dL  (2.8  mmol/L)  with  associated 
hypoglycaemia  symptoms.  The  overall  frequency  of  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  with  associated 
symptoms during the ST treatment period was 5.3% in the saxagliptin group and 3.3% in the placebo 
group.  Most  of  these  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  with  associated  symptoms  were  mild  or 
moderate in intensity.
A total of 56 (18.4%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 30 (19.9%) subjects in the placebo group 
experienced any hypoglycaemic AE during the ST treatment period and prior to rescue. These included 
hypoglycaemia  in  15.8%  and  17.2%  of  subjects,  and  blood  glucose  decreased  in  2.6%  and  6.0%  of 
subjects, respectively. Most hypoglycaemic events were of mild or moderate intensity. One subject in 
the saxagliptin group required medical assistance for her hypoglycaemia.
The proportion of subjects who had AEs included in the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 
was  the  same  in  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups  (2.0%).  The  SOC  Skin  and  subcutaneous  Tissue 
Disorder  AEs  occurring  in  ≥ 2  subjects  were  skin  ulcer  in  2  (0.7%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
and rash in 2 (1.3%) subjects in the placebo group.
A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  had  AEs  prior  to  rescue  in  the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations 
(saxagliptin: 26.0%; placebo: 29.1%). These AEs most common AEs in this SOC included urinary tract 
infection, upper respiratory tract infection, and influenza.
One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and no subject in the placebo group had an AE of
Lymphopenia.
One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had an AE of 
thrombocytopenia prior to rescue. For the subject in the saxagliptin group, the investigator reported a 
non-serious  AE  of  thrombocytopenia  for  a  platelet  count  of  39  x103  c/μL  (39  x109  c/L).  The  study 
medication was interrupted due to the thrombocytopenia, the platelet count returned to normal at the 
next measurement, the event of thrombocytopenia resolved, and the study medication was restarted. 
Assessment report 
18
The  investigator  judged  the  event  to  be  moderate  in  intensity  and  possibly  related  to  the  study 
medication.
One (0.3%) subject in the saxagliptin group and no subject in the placebo group had an AE of
pedal  oedema. This  AE  was  mild  in  intensity,  and  considered  by  the  investigator  not  to  be  related  to 
study drug treatment, and was still continuing as of last contact with the subject.
Three (1.0%) saxagliptin-treated subjects and no placebo-treated subjects had cardiovascular-related 
PT  (preferred  term)  events  prior  to  rescue:  a  SAE  of  acute  coronary  syndrome,  a  SAE  of  acute 
myocardial infarction, and a SAE of myocardial infarction that led to death. All 3 events were submitted 
to the adjudication committee and confirmed by reviewers. None of these AEs were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study medication.
Two (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and no subject in the placebo group had hypersensitivity 
AEs.  One  subject  had  an  AE  of  hypersensitivity  (reported  term  of  allergy  symptoms)  that  was 
moderate  in  intensity,  considered  by  the  investigator  not  to  be  related  to  study  drug  treatment,  and 
was still ongoing as of last contact with the subject. One subject had an AE of urticaria that was mild in 
intensity, considered by the investigator to possibly be related to study drug treatment, and resolved 
within 5 days.
No subject had an AE matching the pre-specified preferred terms for pancreatitis.
Five subjects, 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 3 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo group 
had fracture AEs (Supplemental Table S.6.5.14). These included foot fracture in the 2 subjects in the 
saxagliptin group and 1 subject each with hand fracture, humerus fracture, and lower limb fracture in 
the placebo group. None of these fractures were considered by the investigator to be related to study 
drug treatment and all resolved within 32 days.
In  the  SOC  Gastrointestinal  disorders,  there  was  no  apparent  difference  between  treatment  groups, 
saxagliptin  group  41  (13.5%)  subjects  and  placebo  group  21  (13.9%)  subjects.  Gastrointestinal-
related AEs by PT reported by ≥ 2% of subjects in either treatment group during the ST period were 
constipation (2.6% versus 2.6% in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively), diarrhoea (2.6% 
versus 4.0%, respectively), and gastritis (2.3% versus 1.3%, respectively).
Overal, analysis of adverse events of special interest did not reveal unexpected adverse events. There 
was  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  between  the  saxagliptin  group  and  the  placebo 
group.
However,  skin  ulcer  and  neuropathic  ulcer  observed  in  less  than  2%  in  the  saxagliptin  group  were 
raised  as  a  concern  by  the  CHMP.  The  MAH therefore  provided  further  clarification  that  the  cases  in 
study  057  represent  isolated  reports  of  skin  ulceration.  There  were  3  (1.0%)  subjects  who  reported 
skin  or  neuropathic  ulcers  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  group  and  none  in  the  placebo  group.  These 
ulcers were mild in intensity, did not lead to discontinuation, and resolved during saxagliptin therapy. 
Section  4.4  of  the  current  SmPC  contains  text  regarding  skin  disorder,  including  ulceration  and  the 
current text was considered sufficient by the CHMP.
Laboratory findings
There were no marked abnormalities (MAs) reported for decreased platelets or decreased neutrophils. 
For  saxagliptin  treated  subjects,  marked  abnormalities  were  reported  in  1  (0.3%) subject  each  for 
decreased  hemoglobin  and  decreased  hematocrit  and  for  1  (0.7%)  subject  in the  placebo  group  for 
decreased  leukocytes. Decreased lymphocytes  (lymphopenia)  was  noted  for  3  (1.0%)  subjects  in  the 
saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group. Increased eosinophils were noted for 7 
(2.4%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 6 (4.0%) subjects in the placebo group.
Alkaline  phosphatase levels  elevated  >1.5  x  ULN  were  noted  for  9  (3.0%)  subjects  in  the saxagliptin 
group  and  3  (2.0%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group,  and  there  were  no  subjects  with alkaline 
phosphatase  levels  >3  x  baseline  and  >ULN.  Markedly  abnormal  elevated  ALT  (>3  x  ULN)  was 
reported for 2 (0.7%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) in the placebo group. One (0.3%) 
subject  in  the  saxagliptin group  had  markedly  abnormal  elevated  total  bilirubin  (>2  mg/dL  [34.2 
μmol/L] or  >1.5  x ULN).  However,  no  subject  had  ALT  >3  x  ULN  and  a  total  bilirubin  >1.5  x  ULN  or 
ALT >3 x ULN and a total bilirubin >2 mg/dL (34.2 μmol/L).
Four (1.3%) subjects in the saxagliptin group and 1 (0.7%) subject in the placebo group had elevated 
creatine kinase (CK) > 5 x ULN and were reported as AEs in 3 cases. In most cases these elevations 
Assessment report 
19
represented  a  single  high  value  and  CK  levels  had returned  to  within  normal  limits  (or  were  much 
lower) by the last recorded value.
The  most  frequent  urinary  marked  abnormality  was  urinary  WBCs  (measured  quantitatively), which 
was  present  in  26  (25.2%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  6  (13.3%)  subjects  in the  placebo 
group. Marked abnormalities of haematuria (measured via dipstick) were seen in 11 (3.7%) subjects in 
the  saxagliptin  group  and  1  (0.7%)  subject  in  the  placebo  group. Few  subjects  had  marked 
abnormalities  of  urinary  protein  (4  [1.4%]  saxagliptin  subjects  and no  placebo  subject)  or  urinary 
RBCs (6 [12.8%] saxagliptin subjects and no placebo subjects) during the ST treatment period.
Vital signs
Of  the  180  subjects  who  had  normal  ECG  tracings  at  baseline,  16  (12.5%)  who  received saxagliptin 
and  2  (3.8%)  who  received  placebo  had  abnormal  tracings  at  Week  24.  A  varying  spectrum  of  ECG 
abnormalities  was noted  over  all  treatment  groups.  A  review  of  the  ECG  abnormality  descriptions 
indicated that none of the changes was of clinical relevance.
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
or heart rate in either treatment group during the double blind treatment period.
3.4.1 Conclusion on clinical safety
Overall saxagliptin was well tolerated. There were no unexpected or new adverse events. 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  during  the  short-term  treatment  period  (prior  to  rescue), excluding  all 
events  of  hypoglycaemia,  was  52.3%  in  subjects  receiving  saxagliptin compared  with  55.6%  in 
subjects receiving placebo. Including rescue, the incidence was 53.9% and 57.6% respectively.
In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  3  most  common  events  were  urinary tract  infection,  upper  respiratory 
tract infection, and headache whereas in the placebo group the 3 most common events were influenza, 
urinary tract infection, and pain in extremity.
Patients on saxagliptin had no more hypoglycaemia than placebo treated patients.
There  was  one  death due  to  myocardial  infarction  and  two  other  cardiovascular-related  SAEs  in  the 
saxagliptin group, all considered unrelated to study medication. Patients had already a cardiovascular 
history  and/or  hypercholesterolemia.  Information  is  insufficient  to  draw  any  conclusion  on  a  relation 
with  saxagliptin  usage.  In  any  case,  cardiac  events  are  closely  monitored  and  reported  in  6-monthly 
periodc  safety  update  reports.  Moreover,  the  MAH is  conducting  a  5-year  cardiovascular  outcomes 
study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  the  incidence  of  CV  death,  myocardial  infarction,  or 
ischaemic stroke in subjects with T2DM.
During  the  evalution  of  this  extension  of  indication  application,  efficacy  results  from  the  long  term 
extension period of study 057 became available and were provided by the applicant and did show that
proportions  of  subjects  reporting  AEs,  serious  AEs,  and  discontinuations  for  AEs  were  similar  across 
both  treatment  groups  during  the  extension  period.  No  additional  efficacy  and  safety  aspects  have 
emerged.
Risk management plan
A new RMP version had been provided as part of a recent PSUR submission, which was assessed and 
concluded.  This  RMP  version  was  already  updated  to  include  exposure  data  from  study  CV181057  as 
well  as  data  on  identified  and  potential  risks  and  therefore  also  contains  important  identified  and 
potential risks for saxagliptin in the context of the change in indication with this type II variation. The
applicant hereby provided a justification for not submitting an update of the current RMP as part of this 
extension of indication application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
Assessment report

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.
No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information
Changes to the Product Information
Following the assessment of this extension of indication application, the CHMP endorsed the following 
changes to the SmPC and to the Package Leaflet (bold underlined = new text, strikethrough = deleted 
text):
Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications of the SmPC

in combination with insulin (with or without metformin), when this regimen alone, 
with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC
Posology
Add-on combination therapy
The recommended dose of Onglyza is 5 mg once daily as add-on combination therapy with metformin, 
insulin, a thiazolidinedione or a sulphonylurea.
Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC
General
Onglyza should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic 
ketoacidosis.
Onglyza is not a substitute for insulin in insulin-requiring patients.
Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia
Sulphonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of 
sulphonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in 
combination with Onglyza.
Section 4.8 Undesirable effects of the SmPC
When used as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin), the overall incidence of 
reported hypoglycaemia was 18.4% for Onglyza 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo.

Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC
Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin)
A total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in 
combination with a stable dose of insulin (baseline mean: 54.2 Units) in patients with 
inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 11%) on insulin alone (n=141) or on 
insulin in combination with a stable dose of metformin (n=314). Saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to 
insulin with or without metformin provided significant improvements after 24 weeks in 
HbA1c and PPG compared with placebo add-on to insulin with or without metformin. Similar 
HbA1c reductions versus placebo were achieved for patients receiving saxagliptin 5 mg 
add-on to insulin regardless of metformin use (−0.4% for both subgroups). Improvements 
from baseline HbA1c were sustained in the saxagliptin add-on to insulin group compared to 
the placebo add-on to insulin group with or without metformin at Week 52. The HbA1c 
change for the saxagliptin group (n=244) compared to placebo (n=124) was -0.4% at 
Week 52.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies 
with Onglyza in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
The  Package  Leaflet  has  been  updated  accordingly.  In  addition  minor  changes  have  been  made 
throughout the Product Information.
The CHMP agreed with the changes to the Annexes requested by the MAH listed above.
2.  Benefit Risk Balance
Benefits
Beneficial effects
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  insulin  was  investigated  in  one  clinical  study 
(057).  This  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  trial  in  455  patients,  insufficiently 
controlled by insulin or insulin plus metformin. After screening and lead-in, patients were randomised 
in a 2:1 ratio to receive saxagliptin 5 mg qd or placebo for 24 weeks. 
The  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients  treated  with  insulin  resulted  in  a  decrease  of  HbA1c.  The 
maximum was reached at week 12 and was maintained trough week 24. The mean placebo corrected 
decrease  was  -0.41%.  Secondary  endpoints  were  in  line  with  this  result.  Results  were  similar  in 
subjects with and without metformin use at baseline.
Mean  total  insulin  dose  increased  from  baseline  to  week  24  in  both  groups.  However,  the  mean 
increase was lower in the saxagliptin group (1.7 units) than in the placebo group (5.0 units).
After  this  short  term  period,  patients  entered  a  long-term  phase  of  28  weeks,  the  data  of  which  had 
been provided by the applicant during the evaluation and did not show any additional efficacy aspects; 
the observed decrease of HbA1c in particular was sustained thought week 52. 
Overall,  both  primary  and  secondary  parameters  indicate  that  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  patients 
treated with insulin was effective. The effect was modest with an HbA1c adjusted mean difference from 
placebo  of  -0.41%  but  the  study  demonstrated  nevertheless  a  statistically  significant  reduction,  and 
the effect size in this population with advanced T2DM was still considered to be of clinical relevance by 
the CHMP.
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects
In both groups a relative large percentage of patients discontinued because of lack of glycaemic control 
(22.7% vs 32.8 in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively).
The placebo group had a  considerable reduction in HbA1c of 0.32%, likely attributable to dietary and 
exercise factors, some of which may have extended beyond randomisation. 
There were differences in effect according to geographic region. The adjusted mean change in  HbA1c 
from baseline was -0.69% in Europe, -0.64% in North America, -1.15% in Latin America, and -0.58%
in Asia. The response in the placebo group was -0.41% in Europe, -0.15% in North America, -0.52% in 
Latin America and 0.06% in Asia. This resulted in a difference from control of -0.29% in Europe, vs -
0.49%  in  North  America,  -0.63%  in  Latin  America  and  -0.64%  in  Asia.  However,  there  was  no 
evidence  of  a  treatment-by-region  interaction  (p=0.262)  and  a  difference  in  placebo-corrected 
response between Asian and European patients had previously also been observed with another DPP-4 
inhibitor.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects
In general saxagliptin was well tolerated. There were no unexpected or new adverse events. 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  during  the  short-term  treatment  period  (prior  to  rescue), excluding  all 
events  of  hypoglycaemia,  was  52.3%  in  subjects  receiving  saxagliptin compared  with  55.6%  in 
subjects  receiving  placebo.  In  the  saxagliptin  group  the  3  most  common  events  were  urinary tract 
infection,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  headache  whereas  in  the  placebo group  the  3  most 
common events were influenza, urinary tract infection, and pain in extremity.
Patients on saxagliptin had no more hypoglycaemia than placebo treated patients.
Data  submitted during  the  evaluation  for  the  extension period  through  week  52  of  study  057  did  not 
show any different findings compared to the short term period.
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects
There  was  one  death due  to  myocardial  infarction  and  two  other  cardiovascular-related  SAEs  in  the 
saxagliptin group, all considered unrelated to study medication. Patients had already a cardiovascular 
history  and/or  hypercholesterolemia.  Nevertheless,  cardiac  safety  is  specifically  monitored  in  6-
monthly  periodic  safety  update  reports  and  further  addressed  in  the  context  of  a  cardiovascular 
outcome study performed by the MAH.
Balance
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The addition of saxagliptin resulted in a decrease in HbA1c for the whole population. 
However,  in  both  groups  a  relative  large  percentage  of  patients  discontinued  because  of  lack  of 
glycaemic control (22.7% vs 32.8 in the saxagliptin and placebo group, respectively).
There were no differences in the size of the effect between races, but there were differences between 
geographic  regions.  These  were  mainly  due  to  differences  in  placebo-response,  with  no  response  in 
Asian  people  and  a  decrease  of  HbA1C  of  -0.41%  in  European  patients.  This  resulted  in  a  relatively 
small placebo-corrected numerical decrease of -0.29% in the European population of the study. In this 
heavily  treated  population  with  advanced diabetes the  effect  size  was  nevertheless  still  considered to 
be clinically relevant by the CHMP.
Saxagliptin was in general well tolerated, with no unexpected findings, and no more side effects than 
the  placebo  treated  patients.  Although  the  three  cardiac  adverse  events  were  serious,  their  relation 
with saxagliptin, if any, is not established. Therefore, cardiovascular adverse events are being closely 
monitored and further addressed in a dedicated outcome study.
Benefit-risk balance
The effect of adding saxagliptin on HbA1c  was modest, especially in  European patients, however was 
still  considered  to  be  relevant  for  the  patient  group  involved.  Treatment  was  not  associated  with  an 
increase  in  events  of  hypoglycaemia,  and  the  increase  of  daily  insulin  dose  was  slightly  less  in  the 
saxagliptin group. Saxagliptin was well tolerated.
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment
Saxagliptin,  when  added  to  an  existing  insulin  treatment,  resulted  in  further  reductions  of  HbA1c, 
without showing any unexpected consequences in its safety profile. 
The overall B/R of saxagliptin added to insulin is positive.

3.  Conclusion
On  20  October  2011 the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the SmPC and PL.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Onureg is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery 
(CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates 
for, including those who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Onureg treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced 
in the use of chemotherapeutic medicinal products. 
Patients are to be treated with an anti-emetic 30 minutes prior to each dose of Onureg for the first 
2 treatment cycles. Anti-emetic prophylaxis may be omitted after 2 cycles, if there has been no nausea 
and vomiting (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 300 mg azacitidine orally once daily. Each repeated cycle consists of a 
treatment period of 14 days followed by a treatment free period of 14 days (28-day treatment cycle).

Onureg treatment should be continued until no more than 15% blasts are observed in peripheral blood 
or bone marrow or until unacceptable toxicity (see dose schedule modification guidance for disease 
relapse). 
Onureg should not be used interchangeably with injectable azacitidine due to differences in the 
exposure, dose and schedule of treatment. Healthcare professionals are recommended to verify the 
name of the medicinal product, dose and administration route. 
Laboratory tests 
Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy. Complete blood count 
monitoring is also recommended every other week for the first 2 cycles (56 days), every other week 
for the next 2 cycles after dose adjustment, and monthly thereafter, prior to the start of subsequent 
cycles of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Dose schedule modification for AML disease relapse 
In the case of disease relapse, with 5% to 15% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, in 
conjunction with a clinical assessment, an extension of the dosing schedule from 14 to 21 days of 
repeated 28-day cycles should be considered. Dosing should not exceed 21 days during any 28-day 
period. Onureg should be discontinued if more than 15% blasts are observed in either the peripheral 
blood or bone marrow or at the physician’s discretion. 
Dose adjustment for adverse reactions 
Dose modification guidelines for haematologic and non-haematologic adverse reactions are 
recommended based on clinical and laboratory findings (see Table 1).

* Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe, Grade 4 is life-threatening. Toxicity grades  
are in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.3 
(NCI-CTCAE v4.3). 
Missed or delayed doses 
If a dose of Onureg is missed, or not taken at the usual time, the dose should be taken as soon as 
possible on the same day. Then, the next scheduled dose should be taken at the normal time the 
following day. Two doses should not be taken on the same day. 
If a dose is vomited, another dose must not be taken on the same day. Instead return to the normal time 
of dose administration the following day. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustments are recommended for patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Onureg can be administered to patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment without initial 
dose adjustment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin (BIL) 
≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or BIL 1 to 1.5 × ULN 
and any AST) (see section 5.2). 
Patients with moderate (BIL > 1.5 to 3 × ULN) and severe hepatic impairment (BIL > 3 × ULN) 
should be monitored more frequently for adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment should be 
made (see Table 1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Onureg in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Onureg is for oral use. 
Onureg can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of 
water at about the same time each day. They should not be split, crushed, dissolved or chewed (see 
section 6.6).

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haematological toxicity 
Treatment with Onureg can be associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia 
(see section 4.8 for frequencies). Interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Onureg may be 
necessary to manage haematological toxicities. Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile 
episodes. Patients with low platelet counts should be advised to report early signs or symptoms of 
bleeding. Supportive care such as antibiotics and/or antipyretics for management of infection/fever 
and GCSF for neutropenia should be provided based on individual patient characteristics, treatment 
response and according to the current clinical guidelines (see section 4.2 Table 1). 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most frequent adverse reactions in patients treated with Onureg 
(see section 4.8). Patients should be administered prophylactic anti-emetic therapy for the first 2 cycles 
of Onureg treatment (see section 4.2). Diarrhoea should be treated promptly at the onset of symptoms. 
Interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Onureg may be necessary to manage gastrointestinal 
toxicities (see section 4.2). 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after 
treatment. Men have to use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment (see 
section 4.6). 
Lactose intolerance 
Onureg tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
'sodium-free'. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal clinical drug-drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. 
In case of concomitant administration with other antineoplastic agents, caution and monitoring is 
recommended as an antagonistic, additive, or synergistic pharmacodynamic effect cannot be excluded. 
These effects may be dependent on the dose, sequence and schedule of administration. 
Onureg exposure was minimally affected when co-administered with a proton pump inhibitor 
(omeprazole). Therefore, dose modification is not required when Onureg is co-administered with 
proton pump inhibitors or other pH modifiers. 
An in vitro study of azacitidine with human liver fractions indicated that azacitidine was not 
metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYPs). Therefore, interactions with CYP inducers or 
inhibitors are considered unlikely (see section 5.2). 
Clinically relevant inhibitory or inductive effects of azacitidine on the metabolism of cytochrome 
P450 substrates are unlikely (see section 5.2). No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are 
expected when Onureg is co-administered with substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transporting polypeptides (OATP) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, or organic cation transporter (OCT) 
OCT2. 
Azacitidine is not a substrate of P-gp, therefore it is not expected to interact with P-gp inducers or 
inhibitors. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and up to 6 months after 
treatment.  Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment and have to use 
effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Onureg in pregnant women. Studies in mice and rats have 
shown reproductive and developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. Based on results from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Onureg is not 
recommended during pregnancy (especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary) and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception. The advantages of treatment should be 
weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case. If a patient or partner 
becomes pregnant while taking Onureg, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the 
foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether azacitidine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential 
serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, breast-feeding is contraindicated during Onureg 
therapy (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There are no human data on the effect of azacitidine on fertility. In animals, adverse effects of 
azacitidine on male fertility have been documented (see section 5.3). Patients who wish to conceive a 
child should be advised to seek reproductive counselling and cryo-conservation of either the ovum or 
sperm prior to starting Onureg treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Onureg has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported with 
the use of Onureg. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Haematological toxicity 
New or worsening Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (41.1%), thrombocytopenia (22.5%), or febrile 
neutropenia (11.4%) were commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with Onureg. The 
first occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or febrile neutropenia occurred within 
the first 2 cycles in 19.9%, 10.6%, and 1.7%, respectively in patients treated with Onureg. See 
section 4.2 for monitoring and management guidance. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Gastrointestinal toxicities were the most frequent adverse reactions in patients treated with Onureg. 
Nausea (64.8%), vomiting (59.7%), and diarrhoea (50.4%) were reported in patients treated with 
Onureg. Grade 3 or higher diarrhoea occurred in 5.1% of patients and Grade 3 or higher vomiting and 
nausea occurred in 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively in patients treated with Onureg. The first occurrence 
of Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea occurred within the first 2 cycles in 1.7%, 3.0%, and 
1.3%, respectively, in patients treated with Onureg. See section 4.2 for monitoring and management 
guidance. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood counts and supportive 
treatment should be provided, as necessary, according to local recommendations. There is no known 
specific antidote for an overdose with Onureg.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: 
L01BC07 
Mechanism of action 
Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and epigenetic modifier. Azacitidine is incorporated 
into DNA and RNA following cellular uptake and enzymatic biotransformation to nucleotide 
triphosphates. Incorporation of azacitidine into the DNA of AML cells, modified epigenetic pathways 
through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, and reduction of DNA methylation. This led to 
alteration of gene expression, including re-expression of genes regulating tumour suppression, 
immune pathways, cell cycle, and cell differentiation. Incorporation of azacitidine into the RNA of 
AML cells, inhibited RNA methyltransferase, reduced RNA methylation, decreased RNA stability, 
and decreased protein synthesis. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of Onureg was studied in a multi-centre, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study 
QUAZAR AML-001 (CC-486-AML-001) with a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group design 
which evaluated Onureg versus placebo as maintenance therapy in AML patients. Patients were 
enrolled with de novo AML, AML secondary to prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML); the patients were aged ≥ 55 years, and had achieved 
first complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) 
within 4 months (+/- 7 days) after intensive induction chemotherapy with or without consolidation 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy. Patients were not eligible for HSCT at the time of randomisation, which included patients 
who did not have a transplant donor, or who chose not to proceed to HSCT. 
Patients in both treatment arms received best supportive care as deemed necessary by the investigator. 
Best supportive care included, but was not limited to, treatment with red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions, platelet transfusions, use of erythropoiesis stimulating agent, antibiotic, antiviral and/or 
antifungal therapy, GCSF, anti-emetic therapy, and nutritional support. 
Patients who achieved a CR/CRi after completion of intensive induction therapy with or without 
consolidation were administered Onureg 300 mg (N=236) or placebo (N=233) once daily on Days 1 
through 14 of each 28-day cycle. In the event of disease relapse (5% to 15% blasts in peripheral blood 
or bone marrow), the dose schedule was extended to 21 days of repeated 28-day treatment cycles per 
medical discretion. Treatment continued until disease progression (more than 15% blasts were 
observed in peripheral blood or bone marrow) or until unacceptable toxicity. 
A total of 472 patients were randomised 1:1 between Onureg and placebo treatment arms. Baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics for the AML patient population were balanced between 
treatment arms as shown in Table 3. The median treatment duration was 11.6 months (range: 0.5 to 
74.3 months) for the Onureg arm versus 5.7 months (range: 0.7 to 68.5 months) for the placebo arm. A 
total of 51 patients (21%) receiving Onureg and 40 patients (17%) receiving placebo extended their 
dose schedule to 300 mg daily for 21 days due to AML disease relapse. 
Of the 469 patients in the Phase 3 study who received treatment, 61% (285/469) were 65 years of age 
or older and 11% (51/469) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy 
of Onureg were observed between these patients and younger patients.

Placebo 
In patients who had their dose schedule extended to 300 mg for 21 days due to disease relapse, the 
median OS (22.8 months for Onureg and 14.6 months for placebo) and median RFS (7.4 months for 
Onureg and 4.6 months for placebo) were comparable to the overall study results. 
Onureg demonstrated a favorable treatment effect for OS compared with placebo in both minimal 
residual disease (MRD)-positive and MRD-negative patients. The treatment effect for OS was more 
pronounced in MRD-positive patients (HR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.93) than in MRD-negative patients 
(HR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.12). 
Health related quality of life (HRQoL) 
HRQoL was assessed using the Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue scale (FACIT 
– fatigue scale) and the Five dimensions three levels (EQ-5D-3L) health utility index and visual 
analogue scale (VAS). At baseline, patients had a low level of fatigue and good level of HRQoL that 
were generally comparable to those of the general population of similar age. This level of HRQoL was 
maintained over time with Onureg, as compared to baseline, as well as to placebo. Both the time to 
definitive deterioration and the proportion of patients experiencing clinically meaningful deterioration 
was found to be similar between those receiving Onureg and placebo. Overall, the findings 
demonstrate that HRQoL was similar between Onureg treatment and placebo arms, with no clinically 
meaningful deterioration over time. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Exposure was generally linear with dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure; high intersubject 
variability was observed. The geometric mean (coefficient of variation [%CV]) Cmax and AUC values 
after oral administration of a 300 mg single dose were 145.1 ng/mL (63.7) and 241.6 ng h/mL (64.5), 
respectively. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen did not result in drug accumulation. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Absorption of azacitidine was rapid, with a median Tmax of 1 hour post dose. Mean oral bioavailability 
relative to subcutaneous (SC) administration was approximately 11%. 
Effect of food 
The impact of food on the exposure of Onureg was minimal. Therefore, Onureg can be administered 
with or without food. 
Distribution 
After oral administration, the geometric mean apparent volume of distribution was 12.6 L/kg for a 
70 kg person. The plasma protein binding of azacitidine was 6 to 12%. 
Biotransformation 
Based on in vitro data, azacitidine metabolism does not appear to be mediated by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes (CYPs). Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by 
cytidine deaminase. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean apparent clearance was 1242 L/hour and the geometric mean half-life was 
approximately 0.5 hours. Following intravenous administration of 14C azacitidine to 5 cancer patients, 
the cumulative urinary excretion was 85% of the radioactive dose. Faecal excretion accounted for <1% 
of administered radioactivity over 3 days. Mean excretion of radioactivity in urine following 
subcutaneous administration of 14C-azacitidine was 50%. The amount of unchanged azacitidine 
recovered in urine relative to dose was < 2% following either subcutaneous (SC) or oral 
administration. Faecal excretion has not been measured following oral administration. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The epigenetic regulatory effect of azacitidine on DNA global methylation reduction in the blood was 
sustained with prolonged exposure of 300 mg daily administered for 14 or 21 days of a 28-day cycle in 
myeloid cancers including AML patients from a Phase 1/2 study. A positive correlation was observed 
between azacitidine plasma exposure and the pharmacodynamic effect of reduction in global DNA 
methylation in blood. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In a population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis from 286 AML patients, age (46 to 93 years) did not 
have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of Onureg. Therefore, dose modification for Onureg is 
not required, regardless of patient age. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is 
unlikely to affect the PK to a clinically relevant extent since azacitidine undergoes spontaneous 
hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase. A population PK analysis determined 
that AST (8 to 155 U/L), ALT (5 to 185 U/L) and mild hepatic impairment (BIL ≤ ULN and AST > 
ULN, or BIL 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of 
azacitidine. The effects of moderate to severe hepatic impairment (BIL > 1.5 × ULN and any AST) on 
the PK of azacitidine is unknown. 
Renal impairment 
In patients with cancer, the PK of azacitidine in 6 patients with normal renal function 
(CLcr >80 mL/min) and 6 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were compared 
following daily subcutaneous dosing (Days 1 through 5) at 75 mg/m2/day. Severe renal impairment 
increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70% after single and 41% after multiple 
subcutaneous administrations. This increase in exposure was not correlated with an increase in adverse 
events.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A population PK analysis following a 300 mg dose of Onureg determined that patients with mild 
(CLcr: ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min), moderate (CLcr: ≥30 to <60 mL/min), and severe (CLcr: <30 mL/min) 
renal impairment had 19%, 25%, and 38% increases in azacitidine plasma AUC, respectively. The 
effect of severe renal impairment on Onureg was similar to the above referenced clinical renal 
impairment study with injectable azacitidine (~40% increase in AUC). The exposure of azacitidine 
(AUC) is approximately 75% lower after oral administration relative to the exposure achieved 
following SC administration; therefore, an increase in exposure of approximately 40% following oral 
administration is still considered safe and tolerable. Thus, no dose adjustment of Onureg is 
recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. 
Race/ethnicity 
The effects of race/ethnicity on the PK of Onureg is unknown. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In a 14-day oral toxicity study in dogs, mortality occurred at doses of 8 and 16 mg/m2/day. The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 4 mg/m2/day. At 1 or all doses, pancytopenia correlated with 
bone marrow hypoplasia, lymphoid depletion, gland/lumen dilation and single cell necrosis in mucosal 
crypts of small and large intestines and/or centrilobular hepatocellular vacuolation were observed. At 
the MTD, these findings were partially or completely resolved after 3 weeks. Following parenteral 
azacitidine administrations at comparable dose ranges, mortality and similar target organ toxicities 
were observed in rodents, dogs and monkeys. Non-clinical data from repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
azacitidine revealed no special hazard for humans. 
Azacitidine induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian 
cell systems in vitro. The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats. 
Azacitidine induced tumours of the haematopoietic system in female mice, when administered 
intraperitoneally 3 times per week for 52 weeks. An increased incidence of tumours in the 
lymphoreticular system, lung, mammary gland, and skin was seen in mice treated with azacitidine 
administered intraperitoneally for 50 weeks. A tumorigenicity study in rats revealed an increased 
incidence of testicular tumours. 
Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44% frequency of intrauterine embryonal death 
(increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis. 
Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before 
closure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse reactions when given 
pre-implantation, but it was clearly embryotoxic when given during organogenesis. Foetal 
abnormalities during organogenesis in rats included: Central nervous system (CNS) anomalies 
(exencephaly/encephalocele), limb anomalies (micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and 
others (microphthalmia, micrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and rib abnormalities). 
Administration of azacitidine to male mice prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in 
decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development. 
Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm 
counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in 
mated females (see section 4.6).

1.  What Onureg is and what it is used for 
What Onureg is 
Onureg is an anti-cancer medicine that belongs to a group of medicines called anti-metabolites. 
Onureg contains the active substance azacitidine. 
What Onureg is used for  
Onureg is used to treat adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This is a form of cancer which 
affects your bone marrow and can cause problems with producing normal blood cells. 
Onureg is used to keep the disease in control (remission, when the disease is less severe or not active). 
How Onureg works 
Onureg works by preventing cancer cells from growing. Azacitidine, the active substance in Onureg, 
works by altering the way the cell turns genes on and off. It also reduces the production of new genetic 
material (RNA and DNA). These effects are thought to block growth of cancer cells in leukaemia. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about how Onureg works or why this medicine 
has been prescribed for you. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Onureg 
Do not take Onureg 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to azacitidine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you are breast-feeding.

Warnings and precautions 
Blood tests 
You will have blood tests before you begin treatment with Onureg and during treatment with Onureg 
to check that you have enough blood cells and that your liver and kidneys are working properly. Your 
doctor will decide how often you have blood tests. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away if you get any of these symptoms during treatment

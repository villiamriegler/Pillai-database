RMP. This is a descriptive, non-interventional, 
multinational European cohort study of new users of 
aclidinium, aclidinium/formoterol, and other selected 
COPD medications. The following safety concerns, 
listed as missing information in the RMP: ‘safety in 
patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment’, 
‘safety in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
or urinary retention’ and ‘use in pregnancy or 
lactation’ are removed. The updated RMP version 5.0

in exercise endurance time compared to placebo after 8 
weeks of treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, Brimica 
Genuair improved the number of steps per day compared 
to placebo and reduced the percentage of inactive patients. 
Improvements in the PROactive total score were observed 
in patients treated with Brimica Genuair compared with 
placebo.  A behavioural intervention program was added to 
both treatment groups for an additional 4 weeks. The 
number of steps/day in the Brimica Genuair treatment 
group was maintained resulting in a treatment effect 
compared to placebo of 510 steps/day and a reduction

Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: This RMP v11.0 was prepared to consolidate the 
RMPs  from  simultaneous  procedures  EMEA/H/C/004913/II/0018  (RMP  v9.0  and  v9.1)  and 
EMEA/H/C/004913/II/0021 (RMP v10.0 and v10.1). For this RMP v11.0, the base version used 
is the currently approved v8.1 and all the RMP changes submitted to EMA as part of the above-
mentioned procedure numbers have been incorporated.  
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: Key changes made compared to RMP v8.1 are: 
•  Product overview section has been updated with proposed alternative dosing options for 
the nAMD indication. 
•  Post-marketing exposure data have been updated. 
•  100-week final KESTREL and KITE data replaces the interim 52-week data from the 
studies in the EU RMP. 
•  Updated information on dosing interval for DME indication has been included in the 
Product overview section. 
The major changes made in RMP v11.0 are presented in the table below.

Beovu® 
Centralized procedure 
Chemical class: Humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody 
fragment 
Summary of mode of action: 
Increased levels of signalling through the vascular endothelial growth 
factor A (VEGF-A) pathway are associated with pathological ocular 
angiogenesis and retinal oedema. Brolucizumab binds with high 
affinity to VEGF-A isoforms (e.g. VEGF110, VEGF121, and VEGF165), 
thereby preventing binding of VEGF-A to its receptors VEGFR-1 and 
VEGFR-2. By inhibiting VEGF-A binding, brolucizumab suppresses 
endothelial cell proliferation, thereby reducing pathological 
neovascularisation and decreasing vascular permeability. 
Important information about its composition:  
None of the excipients used are of human or animal origin. In addition, 
the primary container closure system does not pose a risk of 
transmitting spongiform animal encephalopathy agents. 
[Current approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)] 
[Proposed SmPC] 
Current: nAMD: Brolucizumab is indicated in adults for the treatment 
of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
DME: Brolucizumab is indicated in adults for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME).

RTH258/Brolucizumab 
Dosage in the EEA 
Current: nAMD: The recommended dose is 6 mg brolucizumab 
(0.05 mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks 
(monthly) for the first three doses. Thereafter, the physician may 
individualise treatment intervals based on disease activity as assessed 
by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. A disease activity 
assessment is suggested 16 weeks (4 months) after treatment start. In 
patients without disease activity, treatment every 12 weeks (3 months) 
should be considered. In patients with disease activity, treatment 
every 8 weeks (2 months) should be considered. 
If visual and anatomical outcomes indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, brolucizumab should be 
discontinued.  
DME: The recommended dose for Beovu is 6 mg (0.05 ml solution) 
administered by intravitreal injection every 6 weeks for the first five 
doses. Thereafter, the physician may individualise treatment intervals 
based on disease activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or 
anatomical parameters. In patients without disease activity, treatment 
every 12 weeks (3 months) should be considered. In patients with 
disease activity, treatment every 8 weeks (2 months) should be 
considered.  
If visual and anatomical outcomes indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, brolucizumab should be 
discontinued. 
Proposed:  
nAMD:  
Treatment initiation – loading 
The recommended dose is 6 mg brolucizumab (0.05 mL solution), 
administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the 
first three doses. A disease activity assessment is suggested 
16 weeks (4 months) after treatment start. 
Alternatively, 6 mg brolucizumab (0.05 mL solution) may be 
administered every 6 weeks for the first 2 doses. A disease activity 
assessment is suggested 12 weeks (3 months) after treatment start. A 
third dose may be administered based on disease activity as assessed 
by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters at week 12. 
Maintenance treatment 
After the last loading dose, the physician may individualise treatment 
intervals based on disease activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or 
anatomical parameters. In patients without disease activity, treatment 
every 12 weeks (3 months) should be considered. In patients with 
disease activity, treatment every 8 weeks (2 months) should be 
considered. 
If visual and anatomical outcomes indicate that the patient is not 
benefiting from continued treatment, brolucizumab should be 
discontinued. 
DME: The recommended dose for Beovu is 6 mg (0.05 ml solution) 
administered by intravitreal injection every 6 weeks for the first five 
doses. Thereafter, the physician may individualise treatment intervals 
based on disease activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or

Part II Safety specification Module SI: Epidemiology of the 
indication(s) and target population 
2.1 
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
Incidence:  
Annual incidence of treated neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in the UK 
in 2008-2012 was stable at 120 eyes (95% confidence interval [CI] 110-138) or 100 persons 
(95% CI 89-115) per 100,000 population (Keenan et al 2013). nAMD is a disease of the elderly, 
and in an elderly population in France in 2006-2012, incidence of nAMD was 890 per 100,000 
patient-years (95% CI 590-1360), and was higher in women (Saunier et al 2018). Further studies 
reporting cumulative (rather than annualized) incidence of nAMD and late AMD (defined as 
pure  geographic  atrophy,  or  exudative  macular  degeneration  with  or  without  geographic 
atrophy) in Europe, the US and Asia are reported in Table 2-1 below.

Prevalence: 
Prevalence:  The  prevalence  of  nAMD  increases  with  age.  In  a  pooled  analysis  of  three 
population-based studies from three continents (Rotterdam Study, Beaver Dam Eye Study, and 
Blue Mountains Eye Study) the prevalence of nAMD increased from 0.17% among subjects 
aged 55 to 64 years to 5.8% for those older than 85 years (Smith et al 2001). 
Another analysis on six studies in the US, Australia and Europe estimated a pooled prevalence 
of nAMD of 1.05% (95% CI: 0.57-1.52) for subjects aged 65-79 years (Owen et al 2003). The 
overall prevalence of nAMD in the US population 40 years and older in a pooled analysis of 
three  studies  was estimated to  be  1.02%  (95% CI:  0.93-1.11).  In  the  US it is  estimated that 
nAMD affects more than 1.75 million individuals and this number is projected to increase to 
almost  three  million  by  2020  (Friedman  et  al  2004).  A  recently  published  literature  review 
found  the  reported  prevalence  of  nAMD  in  China  increased  from  0.24%  in  the  youngest 
included age group (45-49 years) to 2.79% in the oldest (85-89 years), and estimated that in 
2015, 3.81 million (95% CI 2.57-5.51) persons in this country were affected with nAMD (Song 
et al 2017). 
Further recently published studies are summarized in Table 2-2 below. Only overall estimates 
are  presented;  studies  that  report  age-specific  prevalence  confirm  the  previous  findings  that 
prevalence of nAMD increases steeply with age, from approximately 0.1-0.2% in those aged 
under 65, to over 5% in those aged 75 and older.

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, 
racial and/or ethnic origin and risk factors of the disease 
Risk of nAMD steeply increases with age and appears to be higher in women, although studies 
in  Asian  population  tend  to  demonstrate  a  reversed  trend,  with  higher  risk  in  men  (e.g. 
Tomany et al  2004,  Buch  et  al  2005a,  Joachim  et  al  2016,  Fisher  et  al  2016).  Studies  that 
evaluated risk of advanced AMD (late and nAMD) in various ethnicities reported that it may 
be  significantly  more  common  in  White  rather  than  Black  patients  or  those  of  Hispanic 
ethnicities  (Fisher  et  al  2016);  data  from  Asian  populations  indicate  that  the  age-specific 
prevalence of late AMD in Asians is largely similar to that in White people (Lim et al 2012). 
A number of further risk factors have been linked to a higher risk of nAMD (Lim et al 2012): 
•  Environmental and behavioral factors 
•  Cigarette smoking 
•  Obesity 
•  Low dietary intake of vitamins A, C, and E, and zinc 
•  Low dietary intake of lutein and omega-3 fatty acids 
•  Unhealthy lifestyle related to cardiovascular risk factors 
•  Ocular risk factors:  
•  Darker iris pigmentation 
•  Previous cataract surgery 
•  Hyperopic refraction 
•  Main genetic loci identified: 
•  CFH (complement factor H; chromosome [chr 1]) 
•  Age-related maculopathy (ARMS2)/HTRA1 (HtrA-serinepeptidase1; chr 10) 
•  CFB (complement factor B [properdin]; chr 6) 
•  C2 (complement component 2; chr 6) 
•  CF1 (complement factor 1; chr 4) 
•  Other 
•  Age (main risk factor) 
•  Family history 
•  Race (more common in Asian or White patients compared to Blacks and those of 
Hispanic ethnicity)

The main existing treatment options:  
Anti-VEGF  therapies  delivered  intravitreally  are  the  main  therapies  used  for  treatment  of 
nAMD  and  include  ranibizumab  (Lucentis,  Novartis/Genentech)  and  aflibercept  (Eylea, 
Bayer/Regeneron). Additionally, bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech/ Roche) is unlicensed for 
ocular use yet broadly used in clinical practice worldwide. 
Photodynamic therapy with  verteporfin is also licensed in this indication although its use in 
clinical practice is limited as is use of laser for extrafoveal lesions. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity 
Untreated nAMD is associated with a risk of impaired vision, including blindness. A study in 
the  US  Medicare  database  followed  a  cohort  of  patients  newly  diagnosed  with  any  AMD 
between  1994  and  2004  (before  anti-VEGF  treatments  became  available).  The  10-year 
cumulative incidences of blindness, severe vision loss and moderate vision loss in this cohort 
were 3.2%, 5.4% and 6.0%, respectively; there was a statistically significant 2.3-fold increase 
in blindness and 3.7-fold increase in severe vision loss when compared to the control population 
without AMD (Wysong et al 2009). Neovascular-AMD and the associated visual impairment 
have an impact on functional independence and quality of life (Ramrattan et al 2001, Cruess et 
al 2007, Soubrane et al 2007).  
Mortality:  Decreased  visual  acuity  is  associated  with  increased  5-year  mortality  and  even 
relatively mild visual impairment increases the risk of death more than 2-fold (McCarty et al 
2001). Findings from long-term follow-up studies regarding a possible association of nAMD 
with increased mortality risk have been inconsistent. Whereas some studies have observed no 
association between nAMD and mortality after adjusting for other confounding factors (Borger 
et al 2003, Thiagarajan et al 2005, Knudtson et al 2006, Pedula et al 2015), nAMD was reported 
as a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in women in a population-based 14-year cohort 
study in people aged 60-80 years in Denmark (Buch et al 2005b) and in men only in a 15-year 
cohort  study  in  Australia  (Gopinath  et  al  2016).  In  a  cohort  study  in  Iceland,  nAMD  was 
associated with all-cause mortality only in the subgroup aged 83 years or older (Fisher et al 
2015), while in the Blue Mountains Eye Study, nAMD was significantly associated with all-
cause mortality only among persons younger than 75 years (Cugati et al 2007).

The reported cumulative incidence of DME depended on the length of follow-up of the patients 
in  the  different  studies;  highest  estimates  are  provided  in  a  T1DM  population.  The  high 
cumulative incidence of DME in a population of T1DM and T2DM by Sun et al (2019) could 
be  explained  due  to  the  use  of  optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT),  a  new  diagnostic  tool 
noted  by  Kume  et al (2020) to  have an increased diagnostic accuracy and thus  a  significant 
increase in the incidence of DME detected. 
Prevalence 
A  number  of  population-based  studies  have  provided  prevalence  for  DME  and  CSDME. 
Selected recent studies are summarized in the Table 2-5, stratified by diabetes subtype.  CSDME 
is the most significant outcome of the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) in 
that  it  established  a  method  for  classifying  and  diagnosing  DME  and  determining  when 
treatment is required. For the diagnosis of CSDME, one of the following characteristics must 
be present on clinical examination: Any retinal thickening within 500 microns of the center of 
the macula. Hard exudates within 500 microns of the center of the macula with adjacent retinal 
thickening. Retinal thickening at least 1 disc area in size, any part of which is within 1 disc 
diameter  of  the  center  of  the  macula.  It  is  essential  to  realize  that  the  determination  of  the 
presence of CSME is a clinical diagnosis based on a retinal biomicroscopic examination of the 
patient, and not based on fluorescein angiography (Ali F A 1997).

The reported range in prevalence estimates of DME in T1DM and T2DM patients were similar 
(T1DM: 2.7-14.8%, T2DM: 3.11-15.3%). There was a large range in the prevalence estimates 
reported  in  the  recent  literature,  which  is  most  likely  due  to  the  various  methods  used  to 
diagnose DME – notably the high prevalence of DME in both the T1DM and T2DM populations 
by Acan et al (2018) is likely due to the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), a new 
diagnostic tool noted by Kume et al (2020) to have increased diagnostic accuracy and thus a 
significant increase in the prevalence of DME detected. Besides, prevalence estimated provided 
by  electronic  records  or  databases  are  highly  variable,  which  reflects  the  inconsistency  in 
reporting DME diagnosis. 
Demographics of the DME population– age, gender, racial and/or ethnic origin 
and risk factors of the disease 
A key factor associated with the development of DME is the duration of diabetes, with a rise in 
DME  prevalence  reported  with  increasing  DM  duration,  irrespective  of  diabetic  type 
(Ondreikova et al 2019).  The mean age at diagnosis of DME was reported to range from 61 
years in T1DM and T2DM patients (Eldem et al 2017),  to 64 years in T2DM patients (Martín-
Merino  et  al  2017).  There  was  a  slight  preponderance  reported  in  the  literature,  with  males 
representing 55.2-59% of DME cases (Eldem et al 2017, Martín-Merino et al 2017), with Acan 
et al (2018) reporting a significantly higher prevalence of DME in males. One study assessed 
the  prevalence  of  DME  between  three  major  ethnic  groups  in  Singapore,  with  Indian 
Singaporeans found to have a higher prevalence compared to Chinese and Malays (Tan et al 
2018).  
Risk factors:  
A recent literature  review assessed the  non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors for DME 
(Lee  et  al  2015)  and  concluded  that  hyperglycemia,  hypertension,  and  dyslipidemia  are  key 
modifiable risk factors for DME. Pregnancy was identified as key non-modifiable risk factor, 
where DME can progress rapidly, especially in T1DM. In addition, the duration of diabetes and 
anemia were also important risk factors (Tan et al 2018, Raman et al 2017). HbA1c levels were 
also found to be a significant risk factor for the development of DME (Tan et al 2018), with an 
HbA1c level of >7% associated with increased risk of DME in T2DM patients (Martín-Merino 
et al 2017).

Main Existing treatment options 
The  current  treatment  options  for  patients  with  DME  are:  laser  photocoagulation,  and 
intravitreal injections (IVT) or intravitreal implants of corticosteroids and anti-VEGF. Due to 
the  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  anti-VEGF  therapy,  it  has  become  the  first-line  treatment. 
Corticosteroids  are  used  as  a  second  line  treatment  and  focal  /  grid  laser  photocoagulation 
remains a therapeutic option, but with a lower expected benefit compared with steroid and anti-
VEGF therapy. 
Natural history of DME in the untreated population, including mortality and 
morbidity 
No recent studies were identified to report the mortality or morbidity of DME. 
Important co-morbidities 
The key comorbidities in the population with DME are listed in the following Table 2-6.

Comments 
During both the 6-month pre-index 
and 12-month post-index periods, 
DME patients had significantly higher 
rates of CVD, than matched non-DME 
diabetic patients.  
The incidence rate and prevalence of 
cataracts were reported to be 
significantly higher in DME patients 
than in the general diabetic 
population.  History of cataracts in 
T2DM patients was associated with a 
four-fold increased risk of DME.  
During both the pre-index 6-month 
and post-index 12-month periods, 
DME patients had significantly higher 
rates of CHF, than matched non-DME 
diabetic patients.  
T2DM patients with DME had 
significantly higher prevalence of 
hypercholesterolemia than T2DM 
patients without DME. 
During both the 6-month pre-index 
period and 12-month post-index 
periods, DME patients had 
significantly higher rates of renal 
disease, than matched non-DME 
diabetic patients did.

Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human 
usage 
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies) 
Toxicity: 
•  Key issues identified from acute or repeat 
dose toxicity studies 
No safety findings have been observed in any 
nonclinical study. 
Three- and six-month Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) studies were conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys, with intravitreal injections of 
brolucizumab administered up to 6 mg/eye every 
3 to 4 weeks. Evaluations included daily 
observations for morbidity and mortality, clinical 
observations (including abnormal respiration and 
behavior), body weight determinations, 
biomicroscopic and indirect ophthalmoscopic 
examinations, intraocular pressure (IOP) 
measurements, electroretinogram analysis, 
clinical pathology, toxicokinetic analysis of the 
serum and vitreous, anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
analysis of the serum and vitreous, and 
macroscopic and microscopic tissue 
examinations. No ocular or systemic toxicity 
/effects were noted in any study. Pre-existing 
ADA were measured before dosing on Day 1 
and although there appeared to be an increase 
in ADA incidence and titer over time, there was 
no dose-response relationship and no 
correlation between ADA titers and systemic 
exposure or adverse effects in any study. 
Other toxicity-related information or data:  
•  A study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys did 
not indicate any harmful effects with respect to 
pre- or postnatal development at approximately 
6-times the human exposure based on serum 
Cmax. 
•  In the reproductive toxicity study, 
brolucizumab was not detected in the maternal 
milk or infant serum of cynomolgus monkeys. 
Relevance to human usage 
No ocular or systemic toxicities were noted in 
non-clinical studies conducted using the clinical 
dose and clinical route of exposure. 
There are no adequate and well-controlled 
studies of brolucizumab treatment in pregnant 
women. 
Based on the mechanism of action of VEGF 
inhibitors, there is a potential risk to female 
reproduction and to embryo-fetal development.

Part II Safety specification Module SIII Clinical trial exposure 
4.1 
Part II Module SIII Clinical trial exposure 
For the assessment of safety concerns in patients with nAMD and DME, this section provides 
an overview on the drug exposure related to the 3 mg and 6 mg treatment groups from various 
studies (see Attachment to Annex 7 to EU RMP version 4.0) analyzed in this RMP.  
Calculation of clinical trial exposure was done using the long-term safety database (S-db) of 96 
weeks in nAMD and the 100 Week S-db in DME.     
Long-term S-db (nAMD): 
This  pool  consisted  of  nAMD  studies  with  a  duration  of  at  least  96  weeks  and  with  a 
brolucizumab 6 mg/50 µL dose administered at 4-week intervals followed by q12w/q8w. Two 
Phase 3  pivotal  double-masked  parallel  group  studies  (Study  RTH258-C001  and  Study 
RTH258-C002) were included in this pool. Only Study RTH258-C001 included a brolucizumab 
3 mg group. Data from Screening up to Week 96 was included. 
Exposure to brolucizumab in the long-term S-db is presented by injection frequency category 
in Table 4-1.

100 Week S-db (DME) 
This pool consisted of 100-week data from the two 2-year pivotal Phase III clinical studies in 
the  DME  indication:  RTH258B2301  (KESTREL)  and  RTH258B2302  (KITE).  Both  studies 
included a brolucizumab 6 mg injection every 6 weeks for the first 5 doses (loading phase), then

q12w/q8w during maintenance phase. In the RTH258B2302 study, the dosing interval could be 
extended up to q16w from Week 72 onwards when disease stability (no disease activity at Week 
60 and Week 72) was observed. Study RTH258B2301 included a brolucizumab 3 mg treatment 
group in addition to the brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg treatment groups.

studied in clinical trials 
Part II Module SIV.1 Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies 
within the development program 
Table 5-1 
Important exclusion criteria in pivotal studies in the development 
program 
Criteria 
Reason for exclusion  
Active intraocular or 
periocular infection. 
Active intraocular 
inflammation. 
Concurrent 
confounding ocular 
conditions (e.g., 
vitreous hemorrhage, 
retinal pigment 
epithelium rip/tear, 
aphakia and/or 
absence of the 
posterior capsule) in 
the study eye 
Uncontrolled 
glaucoma in the study 
eye defined as 
intraocular pressure 
(IOP) >25 mmHg on 
medication  
Risk of worsening of an 
ongoing intraocular 
infection into a more severe 
stage and potential loss of 
vision. An active periocular 
infection might increase the 
risk of endophthalmitis. 
Risk of worsening of an 
ongoing intraocular 
inflammatory process, or 
inflammation due to another 
cause. 
Precautionary measure. 
These anatomic 
characteristics are 
representative of pre-
existing pathology, which 
make interpretation of 
patient data obtained during 
a clinical trial difficult, may 
confound study results and 
may require surgical 
intervention. 
Precautionary measure. 
Increased IOP and 
uncontrolled glaucoma is a 
general contraindication to 
any invasive intraocular 
procedure due to known 
possible associated 
complications. 
Is it 
considered to 
be included 
as missing 
information?  
No 
No 
No 
No 
Rationale  
Exclude patients to 
prevent worsening of 
intraocular infection and 
potential vision loss. 
Active or suspected 
ocular or periocular 
infections is a 
contraindication. 
Exclude patients to 
prevent worsening of an 
inflammation. 
Active intraocular 
inflammation is a 
contraindication  
In a study setting exclude 
patients with pre-existing 
pathology, which make 
interpretation of patient 
data obtained during a 
clinical trial difficult and 
may confound study 
results. 
Injection of additional 
volume to the vitreous in 
patients with IOP >25 
mmHg on medication or 
uncontrolled glaucoma 
should generally be 
avoided to avoid 
consequences of 
additional raised IOP, 
including a temporary 
increase associated with 
the intravitreal injection 
procedure.

RTH258/Brolucizumab 
Criteria 
Reason for exclusion  
History of 
hypersensitivity to any 
component of the test 
article, control article, 
or clinically relevant 
sensitivity to 
fluorescein dye (or 
indocyanine green for 
subjects in Japan), as 
assessed by the 
Investigator 
Stroke or myocardial 
infarction in the 90 day 
period prior to 
Baseline 
Presence of 
amblyopia, amaurosis 
or ocular disorders 
with vision <20/200 
(35 letters) in the 
fellow eye at 
screening or baseline 
Due to the low systemic 
exposure of brolucizumab 
the chance for a systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction is 
low, but can however not be 
excluded.  
There are a number of 
concurrently administered 
agents during the 
intravitreal injection 
procedure which could also 
be the cause of a 
hypersensitivity reaction

Part II Module SV.1. Post-authorization exposure  
6.1.1 
Part II Module SV.1.1 Method used to calculate exposure 
An  estimate  of  patient  exposure  is  calculated  based  on  worldwide  sales  volume  in  Patient 
Treatment years (PTY) based on the number of brolucizumab vials and PFS sold worldwide. 
Vials and PFS are designed for single use and hence it is assumed that each vial/PFS represents 
one injection to one patient. Based on market research into prescribers’ dosing behavior (Kim 
et al 2016) of the intravitreal VEGF inhibitors, the average number of vials/PFS used per patient 
per  year  is  5.4,  and  this  will  be  used  as  basis  for  the  estimate  of  the  PTY  exposure  to 
brolucizumab. The number of vials/PFS used to calculate one PTY will be adapted if further 
information becomes available on the use of Beovu in the post-marketing setting. 
6.1.2 
Part II Module SV.1.2. Exposure 
Brolucizumab received its first marketing authorization in the US on 07-Oct-2019. Up to 31-
Mar-2022,  based  on  overall  use  of  509,819  vials/  PFS  (Table  6-1)  and  considering  that  the 
average number of vials/PFS used per patient per year is 5.4, it is estimated that overall post-
marketing exposure of brolucizumab is 94,411 PTYs.

Part II Module SVII.1. Identification of safety concerns in the 
initial RMP submission  
8.1.1 
Part II Module SVII.1.1. Risks not considered important for inclusion in 
the list of safety concerns in the RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP: 
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated): 
None 
Adverse  reactions  with  clinical  consequences,  even  serious,  but  occurring  with  a  low 
frequency  and  considered  to  be  acceptable  in  relation  to  the  severity  of  the  indication 
treated: 
None 
Known  risks  that  require  no  further  characterization  and  are  followed  up  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and 
for  which  the  risk  minimization  messages  in  the  product  information  are  adhered  by 
prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state 
where the product is authorised): 
Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears are known to occur because of progression of underlying 
nAMD,  and  eyes  with  serous  RPE  detachments  appear to  be  most  vulnerable  to  developing 
RPE  tears.  Increased  height  and  shorter  duration  of  the  RPE  detachment  are  important  risk 
factors  for  the  development  of  subsequent  RPE  tears  in  patients  receiving  treatment  with 
VEGF-inhibitors (Doguizi and Ozdek 2014, Guber et al 2014, Clemens and Eter 2016).  
The  reported  incidence  of  RPE  tear  after  treatment  with  VEGF-inhibitors  varies  widely  and 
depends  on  the  selected  patients,  the  treatment  regimens  of  the  VEGF-inhibitors,  and  the 
nomenclature of the lesion morphology used (Clemens and Eter 2016, Ersoz et al 2017). In the 
brolucizumab pivotal studies the number of patients with a retinal pigment epithelial tear was 
low (target posology long term S-db: brolucizumab 3 mg 1.4%; brolucizumab 6 mg 2.7%; a 
higher incidence of RPE tear was reported for patients on brolucizumab 6 mg in Study RTH258-
C001  (3.3%)  compared  to  Study  RTH258-C002  (2.2%)).  The  risk  difference  between 
brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg was 1.6% [95% CI 0.13, 3.42] in the target posology 
long term S-db.  
Retinal  pigment  epithelial  tear  is  listed  as  a  common  ADR  in  the  SmPC  and  is  part  of  the 
Package Insert. There are no pharmacovigilance activities that will minimize the risk. Therefore,

RTH258/Brolucizumab 
retinal  pigment  epithelial  tear  is  not  considered  an  important  identified  risk  for  the  RMP. 
Routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient. 
Further details on Retinal pigment epithelial tear can be found in the Clinical Study Reports 
(Study RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002). 
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile: 
Sustained intraocular pressure increase and Glaucoma 
In the two pivotal trials for brolucizumab, sustained increases in IOP have not been observed 
(Study RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002). The pre-injection values of IOP were similar 
to the baseline values with a low 95%CI, indicating that patients are not at risk for developing 
glaucoma due to a sustained increase in IOP. This finding is consistent with experience with 
intravitreally  administered  VEGF-inhibitors.  There  are  no 
the  already  marketed 
pharmacovigilance  activities  that  will  minimize  the  risk  for  the  patient  and  further 
characterization is not considered required. Sustained IOP increase and glaucoma are therefore 
not  considered  to  meet  the  criteria  for  an  important  identified  risk  for  an  RMP.  Routine 
pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient for this risk.  
Further details on Sustained intraocular pressure increase and Glaucoma can be found in the 
Clinical Study Reports (Study RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002).

Important identified risks 
Risk 
Intraocular inflammation 
Risk-benefit impact (Reasons for classification as important 
identified risk) 
For treatment emergent ocular adverse events (AEs) in the study eye, 
the most pronounced numerical difference between brolucizumab and 
aflibercept was observed for intraocular inflammation and this was 
more pronounced in the Study RTH258-C001. Most intraocular 
inflammation cases were reported during the first 6 months of 
treatment. In the target posology long term S-db the incidence for 
Intraocular inflammation in the brolucizumab 6 mg group was 4.4%. 
Most Intraocular inflammation cases were mild to moderate (93.8% and 
95.2% for 3 mg and 6 mg respectively in Study RTH258-C001, 81.8% 
for 6 mg in Study RTH258-C002), and most resolved with no sequelae. 
New Intraocular inflammation events in Year 2 were balanced across 
treatment arms. 
Intraocular inflammation most accurately represents the grouping of 
different PTs and was selected as an important identified risk in the 
RMP. All important identified risks should be considered adverse drug 
reactions (The Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) 
Annex I - Definitions (Rev 4)). However, the SmPC guideline (revision 
2, 2009) states that “Adverse reactions descriptions should be based 
on the most suitable representation within the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) terminology." Intraocular inflammation is 
an umbrella term and is not available as PT, nor is it available at the 
Lowest Term Level or High Level Terms. Therefore, individual PTs

Endophthalmitis 
Transient intraocular

Risk-benefit impact (Reasons for classification as important 
identified risk) 
representing the umbrella term Intraocular inflammation were proposed 
as ADRs. Intraocular inflammation is categorized as an important 
identified risk. 
Endophthalmitis is a well-known and well-characterized risk associated 
with the intravitreal injection procedure. The number of patients with an 
endophthalmitis in the brolucizumab pivotal studies was low (target 
posology long term S-db: brolucizumab 3 mg 1.1%; brolucizumab 6 mg 
0.7%). The Risk difference between brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 
2 mg was less than 1.0% [0.5% (95% CI: −0.27, 1.67)] in the target 
posology long term S-db. The time to onset since the last active 
injection (all but two events started within 8 days) and the investigator 
assessment suggests that it is very likely that the reported 
endophthalmitis events are in most, if not all cases, caused by the 
intravitreal injection procedure and not by brolucizumab (Study 
RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002). 
Endophthalmitis is listed as an ADR in the SmPC and is part of the 
Package Leaflet too. At the request of the EMA Endophthalmitis is 
categorized as an important identified risk. 
A transient increase in IOP is expected when an intravitreal injection of 
brolucizumab (volume of 0.05 mL) is administered. In the two pivotal 
trials for brolucizumab (Study RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-
C002), transient increases were observed immediately after the 
intravitreal injections were administered. This finding is consistent with 
experience with the already marketed intravitreally administered VEGF-
inhibitors.  
Intraocular pressure increase is listed as a common ADR in the SmPC. 
As indicated in Section 4.4 of the SmPC ‘Special warnings and 
precautions for use’, transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) 
have been seen within 30 minutes of injection of brolucizumab (volume 
of 0.05 mL). Additionally, in the SmPC, advice is given to the 
administering health care provider that both intraocular pressure and 
the perfusion of the optic nerve head must be monitored and managed 
appropriately (Section 4.4 SmPC). The monitoring of IOP increase is 
fully integrated into standard clinical practice to minimize the risk. In 
addition, these post-injection increases are short-lived or can be treated 
with standard of care. Therefore, Novartis considers the information 
provided in the SmPC for this well-known and well-characterized risk 
sufficient and there are no pharmacovigilance activities that will further 
minimize the risk for the patient.  
At the request of the EMA Transient intraocular pressure increased is 
categorized as an important identified risk. 
Retinal detachment / tear  Retinal detachment and tear are mainly associated with the underlying 
disease and aging of the eye; rarely these are associated with the 
intravitreal injection. The number of patients with Retinal detachment 
and tear was low (target posology long term S-db: brolucizumab 3 mg 
0.6%; brolucizumab 6 mg 1.6%). The Risk difference between 
brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg was less than 1.0% in the 
target posology long term S-db. Overall, the reported incidences are 
similar to ranibizumab clinical studies (Lucentis EU RMP version 16.2 
and Lucentis PSUR 12).

Retinal detachment and tear is a well-known and well-characterized risk 
associated with the underlying disease and the aging of the eye. In line 
with VEGF-inhibitors approved for nAMD, retinal detachment and 
retinal tear are both listed as an ADR in the SmPC (as uncommon and 
common respectively) and are part of the Package Leaflet. At the 
request of the EMA, retinal detachment / tear is categorized as an

Risk-benefit impact (Reasons for classification as important 
potential risk)  
No consistent increased incidences of ATEs and hypertension 
compared to sham/control have been reported for the intravitreally 
administered VEGF-inhibitors ranibizumab and aflibercept in patients 
with nAMD (Zarbin et al 2018, Kitchens et al 2016). The reported 
incidence for brolucizumab is consistent with those observed for 
Lucentis and sham treatment. The number of patients with an ATE, 
VTEs, non-ocular haemorrhage and hypertension in the ranibizumab 
nAMD studies varied between 4.3-8.1% for ATEs, 0.4-1.8% for VTEs, 
2.1-15.0 for non-ocular haemorrhage, and 10.3-20.2% for 
hypertension after two years of treatment (total number of patients in 
the studies ranged from 440 to 549), and these incidences were 
similar to sham treatment (Lucentis EU RMP v16.2). Reported 
incidences for Study RFB002A2401 (n=755) were in general an 
exception with an incidence of 1.5% for ATEs, 0.5% for VTEs, 0.4% 
for non-ocular haemorrhage, and 2.5% for hypertension. 
However, at the request of the EMA non-ocular events have been 
categorized as an important potential risk.

The risk tables include side by side pooled data presenting brolucizumab 6 mg, the approved 
dose  and  aflibercept  2  mg  in  nAMD  and  DME  indications  respectively.  Annex  7  includes 
detailed  data  presenting  side  by  side  pivotal  trials  in  nAMD  and  DME  indications.  These 
detailed  tables  also  include  data  on  brolucizumab  3  mg.  For  the  purpose  of  presentation  of 
clinical trial data, data for only brolucizumab 6 mg is provided. However, 3 mg data is discussed 
where relevant. 
In both nAMD and DME studies, comparison of event frequency between the brolucizumab 3 
mg  group  and  the  brolucizumab  6  mg  group  has  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  since  the 
brolucizumab 3 mg group was only included in some pivotal trials, while the brolucizumab 6 
mg and 2 mg aflibercept results are obtained from the pooled pivotal trials.

Important identified risk Intraocular inflammation: Other details 
Intraocular 
inflammation 
Potential 
mechanisms 
Details 
The mechanism that might cause intraocular inflammation is currently not 
fully defined. Potential mechanisms include the quality of the test article, 
the pharmacology of the protein (e.g., binding of specific complement 
factors), Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) as with all therapeutic proteins, or the 
amount or molar dose of protein injected into the eye. 
No relationship has been found between batch numbers and the intraocular 
inflammation events. Data from a number of sources do also not support 
the hypothesis that the molar dose of protein injected into the eye 
correlates with the development of intraocular inflammation. Examples of 
other agents that contain greater molar doses of protein than that in a 6 mg 
dose of brolucizumab have not been associated with the development of 
intraocular inflammation. In two Phase 3 studies with lampalizumab 
(Spectri and Chroma), an anti-Factor D Fab with a molecular weight twice 
the molecular weight of brolucizumab, doses of 10 mg have been 
administered intravitreally every 4 weeks for 48 weeks without any reported 
notable tolerability issues. Additionally, in Novartis early development 
programs in non-human primates, intravitreal doses of 10 mg of Fab have 
been administered once every two weeks for 26 weeks, doses of 19 mg of 
a Fab-Fab bispecific construct have been administered once every two 
weeks for 3 doses and 12 mg of an single-chain variable fragments (scFv) 
have been administered once every two weeks for 2 doses, all without side 
effects or dose limiting toxicities (Novartis data on file). Also, in the Study 
RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002, there was no increase in the 
incidence of patients with intraocular inflammation events in the second 
year of treatment, which would have been expected in case of a 
relationship between the exposure to the drug and/or the molar dose and

Intraocular

Details 
the development of intraocular inflammation. Hence, although a 
brolucizumab 6 mg dose represents the highest amount and highest molar 
dose of an anti-VEGF administered intravitreally, a relationship between 
the amount of protein and/or molar dose and the development of 
intraocular inflammation is highly unlikely. 
The immunogenicity of brolucizumab was evaluated in serum samples. The 
immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results 
were considered positive for antibodies to brolucizumab in immunoassays. 
The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity 
and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample 
collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. Pre-treatment 
antibodies have been detected in drug-naïve subjects for a variety of 
biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins including single-chain 
antibodies. The pre-treatment incidence of anti-brolucizumab antibodies 
was 35-52%. After dosing with brolucizumab for 88 weeks, treatment-
emergent anti-brolucizumab antibodies were detected in 23-25% of 
patients. Anti-brolucizumab antibodies were not associated with an impact 
on clinical efficacy. Among patients with treatment-emergent antibodies, a 
higher number of intraocular inflammation events were observed. All these 
events were treated with standard of care.  
The evidence comes from 4 pivotal trials in nAMD and DME indications and 
overall there is an imbalance between the brolucizumab and aflibercept 
arms.   
The number of patients with an intraocular inflammation event for 
brolucizumab 6 mg was 4.4% in the long-term S-db (nAMD) and 3.3% in 
the 100 week S-db (DME). Most events of intraocular inflammation in the 
100 week S-db (DME) were mild or moderate in severity. 
In nAMD, most patients with an intraocular inflammation event had an 
event occurring during the first 6 months of treatment and intraocular 
inflammation AEs newly occurring in Year 2 were balanced between the 
brolucizumab and aflibercept treatment arms. Most intraocular inflammation 
cases were mild to moderate, and most resolved without sequelae. 
In a Phase IIIa clinical trial (MERLIN), in patients with nAMD who received 
brolucizumab every 4 weeks (q4w) maintenance dosing, intraocular 
inflammation (including retinal vasculitis) and retinal occlusion were 
reported with a higher frequency in the brolucizumab 6 mg arm with 
continuous q4w (not approved regimen) compared to aflibercept 2 mg arm 
with continuous q4w regimen (IOI: 9.3% vs 4.5% of which RV: 0.8% vs 
0.0%; RO: 2.0% vs 0.0%). 
In nAMD clinical trials, a higher intraocular inflammation incidence was 
observed in Japanese patients treated with brolucizumab compared to non-
Japanese patients. In Study RTH258-C001 the number of patients with an 
intraocular inflammation event was 7/60 (11.7%) in Japanese patients and 
14/300 (4.7%) in non-Japanese patients. There is also a higher incidence 
of intraocular inflammation in females compared to males (long-term S-db): 
brolucizumab 6 mg 5.3% in females vs. 3.2% in males. 
In DME clinical trials, the above observations were not possible to make 
due to the smaller size of the Japanese cohort (approximately 20 per 
treatment arm).

Intraocular 
inflammation 
Details 
In overall population included in the DME trials KESTREL and KITE, there 
is also a higher incidence of intraocular inflammation in females compared 
to males (100 Week S-db in DME): pooled brolucizumab 6 mg 5.1% in 
females (7/138) vs. 2.2% in males (5/230). 
In the nAMD clinical trials, a higher proportion of patients who developed 
intraocular inflammation had a positive status for treatment emergent 
(boosted or induced) ADAs, as compared to those with a negative post-
treatment ADA status 
In the DME clinical trials, a higher proportion of patients who developed 
AESIs had a positive status for treatment emergent (boosted or induced) 
ADAs, as compared to those with a negative post-treatment ADA status. 
Given that there is no apparent mechanism leading to the reported 
incidence of intraocular inflammation events associated with brolucizumab, 
there are no additional steps to prevent intraocular inflammation specific to 
brolucizumab. 
Preventability 
Impact on the benefit-
risk balance of the 
product 
Most intraocular inflammation cases were mild to moderate and most 
resolved with appropriate standard of care treatment and with no sequelae.  
Therefore, the impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product is 
considered to be low. 
There is no public health impact.

Potential 
mechanisms 
Details 
Typically, retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion events are seen in 
the presence of intraocular inflammation. 
The results from the BASICHR0049 mechanistic study represent an additional 
characterization of the risk and indicate that the underlying mechanism is 
immune mediated. These results suggest a mature, high affinity and diverse IgG-
driven ADA response with ADAs recognizing multiple different B cell epitopes on 
the brolucizumab molecule. The presence of a polyclonal and diverse immune 
response against multiple epitopes to brolucizumab, along with a possible 
increased potential for platelet aggregation, could be consistent with an 
increased risk of the formation of immune complexes resulting in intraocular 
inflammation and vascular occlusion. In addition, the in vitro activation by 
brolucizumab of T-cell from case subjects is evidence that these master 
regulators of the immune response carried a memory of previous activation to 
brolucizumab. This provides evidence that subjects with brolucizumab-

Characterization 
of the risk: 
associated retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion had a coordinated 
and specific immunity to brolucizumab. 
In Study RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002, the pre-treatment incidence of 
anti-brolucizumab antibodies was 35 – 52%. After dosing with brolucizumab for 
88 weeks, treatment-emergent anti-brolucizumab antibodies were detected in 23 
to 25% of patients. Among patients with treatment-emergent antibodies, a higher 
number of intraocular inflammation events were observed. 
The totality of the available evidence indicates that the treatment-emergent 
immune response against brolucizumab drives the immune-mediated adverse 
reactions. The presence of pre-existing ADA does not influence the likelihood 
that a patient would develop a treatment-emergent immune response against 
brolucizumab or influence the likelihood of developing IOI including RV, and/or 
RO. 
Current evidence is based on the 4 pivotal trials in nAMD and DME indications 
and on post-marketing data for nAMD indication. 
Retinal  vasculitis  was  defined  in  the  pivotal  AMD  Phase  III  studies  as  part  of 
intraocular  inflammation  and  no  cases  of  retinal  vasculitis  were  reported  for 
brolucizumab 6 mg. One event was reported in a patient receiving brolucizumab 
3 mg. Intraocular inflammation is characterized in the relevant section.  
In  a  Phase  IIIa  clinical  trial  (MERLIN),  in  patients  with  nAMD  who  received 
brolucizumab  every  4  week  maintenance  dosing,  intraocular  inflammation 
(including  retinal  vasculitis)  and  retinal  occlusion  were  reported  with  a  higher 
frequency  in  the  brolucizumab  6  mg  every  four  weeks  arm  when  compared  to 
aflibercept 2 mg every four weeks (IOI: 9.3% vs 4.5% of which RV: 0.8% vs 0.0%; 
RO: 2.0% vs 0.0%.).

Events of “retinal vasculitis” and/or “retinal vascular occlusion” reported in the post-
marketing setting have occurred in the presence of intraocular inflammation. Some 
of these events have been reported with severe vision loss.   
Patients who are at risk for intraocular inflammation or with active intraocular 
inflammation at the time of brolucizumab administration are considered as a risk 
groups for retinal vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusion. 
Based on a retrospective real world evidence analysis, patients with a medical 
history of intraocular inflammation and/or retinal vascular occlusion in the year 
prior to treatment with brolucizumab were more likely to present with similar 
events after brolucizumab injection, as compared to nAMD patients with no 
history of these events. 
Retinal vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusion are typically seen in the 
presence of intraocular inflammation. A careful eye examination before each 
intravitreal injection should be performed to exclude an intraocular inflammation. 
Intraocular inflammation is a contraindication in anti-VEGF drugs for intravitreal 
use. Furthermore, patient awareness of signs of inflammation and prompt 
reporting of these to the healthcare provider could allow for timely and corrective 
therapeutic measures. Discontinuation of the treatment with brolucizumab in 
patients developing retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion events, 
managing the symptoms and discontinuation of treatment in the patients 
experiencing intraocular inflammation is advised as these patients may be at risk 
of developing retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion. Patients treated 
with brolucizumab with a medical history of intraocular inflammation and/or 
retinal vascular occlusion (within 12 months prior to the first brolucizumab 
injection) should be closely monitored, since they are at increased risk of 
developing retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion. 
 Retinal vasculitis was observed to occur with uncommon frequency and the 
frequency of retinal vascular occlusion was changed from ‘uncommon’ to 
‘common’ in the pooled DME studies through Week 100. The impact of retinal 
vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion on the benefit-risk balance of the 
product is considered to be low. 
The impact on public health is considered to be low.

Details 
The incidence of endophthalmitis after an intravitreal injection is low. 
Current evidence is based on the 4 pivotal trials in nAMD and DME 
indications. 
Endophthalmitis is a well-known and well-characterized risk associated 
with the intravitreal injection procedure. The number of patients with an 
endophthalmitis in the brolucizumab pivotal studies was low (long-term S-
db: brolucizumab 3 mg 1.1%; brolucizumab 6 mg 0.7%).   
The risk difference between brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg in 
nAMD was less than 1.0% [0.5% (95% CI: −0.27%, 1.67%)] in the long-
term S-db. The number of patients with an endophthalmitis is similar to 
incidences reported in ranibizumab clinical studies. 
In DME, very few patients (0.5%) experienced endophthalmitis and the 
risk difference is thus difficult to interpret. 
There is an increased risk of endophthalmitis if the intravitreal injection 
procedure is not carried out under aseptic conditions. 
The SmPC specifically mentions that the intravitreal injection procedure 
should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which include the use of 
surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile 
eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Patients should be instructed to report 
any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay. 
The incidence of endophthalmitis in the brolucizumab pivotal studies was 
low. The impact of endophthalmitis on the benefit-risk balance of the 
brolucizumab is considered to be low since ‘how to administer an 
intravitreal injection’ and ‘how to communicate to the patients when to 
seek urgent medical attention’ are standard clinical practice to minimize 
the risk of infections with the use of intravitreal injections. 
The impact on public health is considered to be low. Events are generally 
manageable with appropriate treatment.

characterized risk associated with an intravitreal injection volume of 
0.05 mL. Brolucizumab is also administered with a volume 0.05 mL and 
therefore a transient intraocular pressure increase due to increased 
intraocular volume may be anticipated. 
Current evidence is based on the 4 pivotal trials in nAMD and DME 
indications. 
In the two pivotal nAMD trials for brolucizumab (Study RTH258-C001 and 
Study RTH258-C002), transient increases in intraocular pressure have 
been seen within 30 minutes of injection, similar to those observed with

intravitreal administration of other VEGF inhibitors. These post-injection 
increases are self-limiting or can be treated with standard of care. 
Transient intraocular pressure increased is a well-known and well-
characterized risk associated with the intravitreal injection of 0.05 mL 
brolucizumab solution. The number of patients with an intraocular pressure 
increased in the brolucizumab pivotal studies was low. The risk difference 
between brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg was comparable in 
nAMD, while it was slightly higher in DME. 
Patients with intraocular pressure increased or glaucoma prior to the 
intravitreal injection. 
As per SmPC both intraocular pressure and perfusion of the optic nerve 
head must be monitored and managed appropriately. If needed, an 
intraocular pressure increased can be treated with standard of care. 
The impact of transient intraocular pressure increased on the benefit-risk 
balance of the product is considered to be low. 
The impact on public health is considered to be low. Events are generally 
manageable with standard of care.

Important identified risk- Retinal detachment / tear: Other details 
Retinal detachment / 
tear 
Potential mechanisms  Retinal detachment and tear are mainly associated with the underlying 
Details 
disease and aging; rarely these are associated with the intravitreal injection 
or with intravitreally administered VEGF-inhibitors.  
Retinal detachment and tear is a well-known and well-characterized risk 
associated with the underlying disease and the aging of the eye. 
The number of patients with retinal detachment and tear was low 
(brolucizumab 6 mg nAMD 1.6% and DME 0.3%). The risk difference 
between brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg was less than 1.0% in 
both indication pivotal studies. Overall, the reported incidences are similar 
to ranibizumab clinical studies (Lucentis EU RMP version 17.2 and 
Lucentis PSUR 12). 
The following conditions might increase the risk for retinal detachment: 
previous retinal detachment or retinal tear, eye tumors, inflammation in the 
choroid or the retina, eye injury, or severe high blood pressure. 
Caution should be used in patients having risk factors for retinal 
detachment. 
The impact of retinal detachment/ tear on the benefit-risk balance of the 
product is considered to be low.

Potential mechanisms

Characterization of the risk 
Details 
Systemically administered VEGF-inhibitors in patients 
with cancer have been associated with an increased risk 
of ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular haemorrhage and 
hypertension (see e.g. SmPCs of Zaltrep, Avastin, 
Votrient) due to its effect on the microvasculature.   
Although there is an increased risk of ATEs, VTEs, non-
ocular haemorrhage and hypertension after intravenously 
administered high doses of VEGF-inhibitors for the 
treatment of cancer, there is currently no evidence of 
increased incidences of ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular 
haemorrhage and hypertension for the much lower 
intravitreally administered doses of VEGF-inhibitors in 
patients with nAMD (Zarbin et al 2018, Kitchens et al 
2016, Lucentis RMP version 16.2). After intravitreal 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys, the systemic 
maximal concentration of brolucizumab is approximately 
1000-fold less than the trough concentration of a 
therapeutic dose of intravenously administered anti-
VEGFs. 
The number of patients with ATEs in the brolucizumab 
pivotal studies was low (brolucizumab 6 mg: 3.0% in the 
long-term S-db in nAMD and 5.7% in the 100 week S-db 
in DME). The risk difference between brolucizumab 6 mg 
and aflibercept 2 mg was less than 1.0% in both 
indications.

Non-ocular events (ATE, VTE, non-
ocular haemorrhage and 
hypertension) 
Details 
The number of patients with VTEs in the brolucizumab 
pivotal studies was low (brolucizumab 6 mg: 0.7% in the 
long-term S-db in nAMD and 1.4% in the 100 week S-db 
in DME). The Risk difference between brolucizumab 6 
mg and aflibercept 2 mg was balanced overall.  
The number of patients with a non-ocular haemorrhage 
in the brolucizumab pivotal studies was low 
(brolucizumab 6 mg: 7.1% in the long-term S-db in nAMD 
and 4.1% in the 100 week S-db in DME). The risk 
difference between brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 
mg was less than < 1.0% in both indications. 
The number of patients with a hypertension in the 
brolucizumab pivotal studies was low (brolucizumab 6 
mg: 9.0% in the long-term S-db in nAMD and 13.0% in 
the 100 week S-db in DME). The risk difference between 
brolucizumab 6 mg and aflibercept 2 mg was less than < 
1.0% in both indications.  
A reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from 
baseline was observed in the two pivotal studies 
RTH258-C001 and RTH258-C002 over a period of 96 
weeks. The observed reduction is considered not 
clinically relevant. 
Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or clotting 
disorders have a higher risk for ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular 
haemorrhage, and hypertension. In DME patients, 
underlying disease (diabetes) is a risk factor (Lee et al 
2015). 
Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or clotting 
disorders have a higher risk for ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular 
haemorrhage and hypertension should be treated with 
standard of care. 
The impact of non-ocular events on the benefit-risk 
balance of the product is considered to be very low. 
The impact on public health is considered to be very low 
due to the low incidence of these events.

Although this section on potential risks is primarily intended for non-ocular events, Table 8-19 
provides the incidence rates for ocular adverse events in the 100 week S-db in DME which fall 
under each of the potential risk categories. The ocular AEs were retrieved in the pre-defined 
search for the potential risks either based on the broad nature of the MedDRA search or due to 
the use of non-specific MedDRA coding.

Safety beyond two years of treatment 
Safety beyond two

Evidence source 
Details 
The safety of brolucizumab has been studied up to 96 weeks in the Study 
RTH258-C001 and Study RTH258-C002 and up to 100 weeks in DME 
studies (RTH258B2301 and RTH258B2302).  
The RTH258-C001 extension study provided safety data for 150 patients 
with a total treatment duration between 120 and 132 weeks. 
Population in need of further characterization: 
nAMD and DME are progressive diseases, and long term treatment is often 
required to control the disease. It is therefore likely that nAMD and DME 
patients will be treated with brolucizumab beyond two years of treatment.

Physicians are advised that the treatment interval between two doses should 
not be less than every 8 weeks (2 months) during the maintenance phase. 
Physicians are advised to discontinue the treatment with brolucizumab in 
patients developing intraocular inflammation including retinal vasculitis and/or 
retinal vascular occlusion events and manage the symptoms promptly. 
Patients treated with brolucizumab with a medical history of intraocular 
inflammation and/or retinal vascular occlusion (within 12 months prior to the 
first brolucizumab injection) should be closely monitored, since they are at 
increased risk of developing retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion.

Part V.2. Additional Risk minimization measures 
Educational materials for patients (Annex 6) 
Educational materials for patients for the important identified risks intraocular inflammation, 
retinal  vasculitis  and/or  retinal  vascular  occlusion,  endophthalmitis,  transient  intraocular 
pressure increased, and retinal detachment/ tear are included. 
Objectives: 
To  ensure  that  patients  are  adequately  informed  about  the  potential  to  develop  intraocular 
inflammation,  retinal  vasculitis  and/or  retinal  vascular  occlusion,  endophthalmitis,  transient 
intraocular  pressure  increased  or  retinal  detachment/  tear  after  an  intravitreal  injection  of 
brolucizumab.  
Rationale for the additional risk minimization activity: 
Although  intraocular  inflammation,  retinal  vasculitis  and/or  retinal  vascular  occlusion, 
endophthalmitis,  transient  intraocular  pressure  increased,  and  retinal  detachment/tear  is 
mentioned in the Package Leaflet (PL) and clear instructions are provided in the PL when to 
seek immediate medical help, a patient guide has been developed. 
Intraocular inflammation can lead to vision loss if not treated with standard of care.  Retinal 
vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion may lead to vision loss. Endophthalmitis is a serious 
intraocular condition that can lead to vision loss. In most, if not all cases, endophthalmitis is 
caused by the intravitreal injection procedure and not by brolucizumab. Retinal detachment/tear 
are mainly associated with the underlying disease and aging; rarely these are associated with 
the intravitreal injection procedure or brolucizumab. 
The patient guide aims to provide adequate patient education on key signs and symptoms of a 
potential  endophthalmitis,  intraocular  inflammation,  retinal  vasculitis  and/or  retinal  vascular 
occlusion, transient intraocular pressure increased and retinal detachment/ tear and when to seek 
urgent attention from their physician, ensuring rapid identification and treatment. 
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
A patient guide is prepared nationally, in line with the key important risks defined in the RMP 
and with  each  EU member  state’s national  regulations and legislations. The patient guide  is 
distributed to all ophthalmology clinics where brolucizumab is expected to be used in patients. 
The  treating  physician  is  expected  to  provide  the  patient  guide  to  the  patients  receiving 
treatment with brolucizumab.  
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
Success of the proposed risk minimization measure will be assessed by the reported frequency 
in the PSUR of intraocular inflammation, retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, 
endophthalmitis, transient intraocular pressure increased and retinal detachment/ tear over time.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan for Beovu® 
(brolucizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Beovu®. The RMP details important 
risks of Beovu®, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Beovu's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Beovu’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Beovu® should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP for Beovu® should be  read in  the  context  of  all this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Beovu’s 
RMP. 
Part VI: I. The medicine and what it is used for 
13.1 
Beovu® is authorized for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME) in adults (see SmPC for 
full indication).  
It contains brolucizumab as the active substance and it is given by intravitreal injections. 
Further information about the evaluation of Beovu’s benefits can be found in Beovu’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/beovu 
13.2 
Part VI: II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimize or further characterize the risks 
Important  risks  of  Beovu®  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Beovu’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  the  case  of  Beovu®,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.

RTH258/Brolucizumab 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Beovu® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
13.2.1  Part VI – II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Beovu®  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Beovu®. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
The evidence comes from 4 pivotal trials in nAMD and DME 
indications and overall there is an imbalance between the 
brolucizumab and aflibercept arms. .  
In nAMD clinical trials, a higher intraocular inflammation incidence was 
observed in Japanese patients treated with brolucizumab compared to 
non-Japanese patients. In Study RTH258-C001 the number of patients 
with an intraocular inflammation event was 7/60 (11.7%) in Japanese 
patients and 14/300 (4.7%) in non-Japanese patients.  
There is also a higher incidence of intraocular inflammation in females 
compared to males (long-term S-db): brolucizumab 6 mg 5.3% in 
females vs. 3.2% in males. 
In DME clinical trials, the above observations were not possible to 
make due to the smaller size of the Japanese cohort (approximately 
20 per treatment arm).

RTH258/Brolucizumab 
In overall population included in the DME trials, there is also a higher 
incidence of intraocular inflammation in females compared to males 
(100 Week S-db):  5.1% in females (7/138) vs. 2.2% in males (5/230) 
receiving brolucizumab 6 mg. 
In the nAMD clinical trials, a higher proportion of patients who 
developed intraocular-inflammation had a positive status for treatment 
emergent (boosted or induced) ADAs, as compared to those with a 
negative post-treatment ADA status. 
In the DME clinical trials, a higher proportion of patients who 
developed AESIs had a positive status for treatment-emergent 
(boosted and induced) ADAs as compared to those with a negative 
post-treatment ADA status.

Current evidence is based on the 4 pivotal trials in nAMD and DME 
indications and on post-marketing data for nAMD indication. 
Patients at risk for intraocular inflammation or with active intraocular 
inflammation at the time of brolucizumab administration. 
Based on a retrospective real world evidence analysis, patients with a 
medical history of intraocular inflammation and/or retinal vascular 
occlusion in the year prior to treatment with brolucizumab were more 
likely to present with similar events after brolucizumab injection, as 
compared to nAMD patients with no history of these events.

In the two pivotal nAMD trials for brolucizumab (Study RTH258-C001 
and Study RTH258-C002), transient increases in intraocular pressure 
have been seen within 30 minutes of injection, similar to those 
observed with intravitreal administration of other VEGF inhibitors. 
These post-injection increases are self-limiting or can be treated with 
standard of care.

Retinal detachment and tear is a well-known and well-characterized 
risk associated with the underlying disease and the aging of the eye. 
The following conditions might increase the risk for retinal detachment: 
previous retinal detachment or retinal tear, eye tumors, inflammation in 
the choroid or the retina, eye injury, or severe high blood pressure.

pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Although there is an increased risk of ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular 
haemorrhage and hypertension after intravenously administered high 
doses of VEGF-inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, there is currently 
no evidence of increased incidences of ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular 
haemorrhage and hypertension for the much lower intravitreally 
administered doses of VEGF-inhibitors in patients with nAMD. 
After intravitreal administration in cynomolgus monkeys, the systemic 
maximal concentration of brolucizumab is approximately 1000-fold 
less than the trough concentration of a therapeutic dose of 
intravenously administered anti-VEGFs. 
Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or clotting disorders have a 
higher risk for ATEs, VTEs, non-ocular haemorrhage and 
hypertension. In DME patients, underlying disease (diabetes) is a risk 
factor.

Annex 6 - Details of proposed additional risk minimization activities (if 
applicable) 
The patient educational materials will be implemented in accordance to the addendum to GVP 
Module XVI and the national guidelines of each of the EU Member States. 
Approved key messages of the additional risk minimization measures 
The key safety messages are focused on facilitating the patient recognizing the key signs and 
symptoms of potential adverse reactions to ensure the patient informs their ophthalmologist of 
these potentially severe outcomes.  
The patient guide will contain the following: 
•  What is neovascular (wet) age related macular degeneration and diabetic macular oedema 
(DME) 
•  What is Beovu, how does it work, how is it administered and what to expect from the 
treatment 
•  What are the steps following treatment with Beovu 
•  Description of the risks including increased intraocular pressure, intraocular inflammation, 
retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, retinal detachment and retinal tear and 
endophthalmitis and their key signs and symptoms. Also, patients should be informed of 
the signs and symptoms of immunogenicity 
•  Patients should be alerted of the importance of reporting adverse reactions without delay 
•  Description of the best course of action if sign and symptoms of those risks present 
themselves (e.g. How to reach your doctors) 
•  Recommendations for monitoring and required examinations: Following intravitreal 
injection: measurement of increased intraocular pressure and perfusion of the optic nerve  
•  The patient guide will also be available in spoken form in audio format. 
The following are the key safety messages to be communicated to allow early diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment of these events:  
•  Beovu  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines  called  anti-neovascularization  agents  (“anti-
VEGF”)  that  are  given  as  an  injection  into  your  eye  (intravitreal  injection).  An 
uncommon severe  inflammation (endophthalmitis), usually associated with  infection, 
inside  the  eye  or  a  detachment  of  one  of  the  layers  in  the  back  of  the  eye  (retinal 
detachment/tear) sometimes develops after an injection into the eye. A transient increase 
in  eye  pressure  (transient  intraocular  pressure  increased)  is  common  but  is  usually 
asymptomatic; the doctor needs to do measurements of the pressure inside the eye to 
detect this. 
• 
Inflammation of the blood vessels in the retina (retinal vasculitis) and/or blockage of the 
blood vessels in the eye (retinal vascular occlusion), or a less severe inflammation in the 
eye  (intraocular  inflammation)  may  occur.  Patients  who  are  female  or  of  Japanese 
ethnicity may be more at risk of developing similar events.

Patients who have had intraocular inflammation and/or retinal vascular occlusion in the 
last  year  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  retinal  vasculitis  and/or  retinal  vascular 
occlusion.  
An immune response (immunogenicity) is also possible. 
•  Seek immediate medical help if you experience any of the following:  
o  a sudden decrease or change in vision, including an increased number of small 
particles in your vision (floaters) 
o  pain, discomfort, redness in your eye 
o  flashes of light 
o 
increased sensitivity to light (discomfort to bright lights)

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for liraglutide, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Data from clinical trials showed that liraglutide is associated with delayed gastric emptying. In the 
LEADER study, delayed gastric emptying was reported three times more frequently in the liraglutide 
group compared to the placebo group. As there is sufficient evidence to conclude on a causal relationship 
between delayed gastric emptying and liraglutide, delayed gastric emptying should be included as an ADR 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a frequency allocation of ‘uncommon’ and in section 4 of the Package 
Leaflet.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for liraglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing liraglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

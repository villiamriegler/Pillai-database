2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hormonal  contraception  refers  to  birth  control  methods  that  act  on  the  endocrine  system.  The  vast 
majority  of  methods  are  composed  of  steroid  hormones.  There  are  two  main  types  of  hormonal 
contraceptive  formulations:  combined  methods  which  contain  both  an  estrogen  and  a  progestin,  and 
progestogen-only  methods  which  contain  only  progesterone  or  one  of  its  synthetic  analogues 
(progestins).  Traditionally  the  combined  hormonal  contraceptives  contain  two  steroids:  one  with 
gestagenic and the other with estrogenic effects. The functions of progestagens are to inhibit ovulation, 
primarily by the central feedback mechanism resulting in decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion 
by the pituitary gland. The estrogen component also contributes to contraceptive efficacy by inhibiting 
the effect on FSH secretion but the  major function of estrogens in the contraceptive pill is to provide 
stability to the endometrium and consequently to provide acceptable cycle control and bleeding pattern. 
The  progestagen  components  of  combined  hormonal  contraceptive  pills  are  nor-testosteron  or 
progesterone  derivatives.  Combined  hormonal  contraceptives  almost  without  exception  contain  17-
alpha-ethinylestradiol  (EE)  and  some  first  generation  combined  hormonal  contraceptives  contain 
mestranol.  19-nor-testosteron  derivatives  have,  besides  their  gestagenic  effects,  mild  to  moderate 
androgenic  effects  and  might  have  negative  impact  on  the  lipid  metabolism.  They  can  also  cause 
intrahepatic cholestasis.  
Nomegestrol  Acetate  (NOMAC)  is  a  highly  selective  progestin  derived  from  the  naturally  occurring 
steroid  hormone,  progesterone.  The  17β-estradiol  (E2)  compound  is  identical  to  the  endogenous 
human  E2  and  is  therefore  classified  as  a  natural  estrogen.  Zoely  2.5mg/1.5mg,  film-coated  tablet 
(NOMAC-E2)  is  a  new  novel  monophasic  oral  preparation  which  contains  2.5mg  of  the  progestagen 
nomegestrol  acetate  (NOMAC)  and  1.5mg  of  the  estrogen  17β-estradiol  (E2).  The  two  active 
components  are  already  approved  for  marketing,  either  individually  or  as  a  combination:  Estreva® 
tablets (1.5 mg E2), Lutenyl® tablets (3.75 mg and 5 mg NOMAC) or Naemis® tablets (E2 1.5 mg for 
10- days and E2 1.5 mg + NOMAC 3.75 mg for the next 14 days). 
The 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol compound has a very strong estrogenic activity; its bioavailability is very 
high (=90%). The 17-alpha-ethinyl side chain protects the molecule against the rapid metabolism (first 
pass  metabolism)  by  the  liver.  Ethinylestradiol  has  a  stronger  effect  on  the  metabolic  activity  of  the 
liver compared to estradiol, and namely increases in a dose dependant way the production of several 
serum  factors  which  facilitate  coagulation.  The  main  aim  to  develop  this  compound  was  to  use  more 
natural hormones in the hormonal combined contraception in contrast with those which are available. 
Nomegestrol  acetate  has  strong  affinity  for  the  human  progesterone  receptor  an  antigonadotropic 
activity  and  has  no  androgenic  or  mineralocorticoid  effects.  In  addition  NOMAC  shows  moderate 
antiandrogenic effects as well.  
NOMAC-E2 is classified under ATC code G03AA14, therapeutic/pharmacological group: “Genitorurinary 
system  and  sex  hormones  –  sex  hormones  and  modulators  of  the  genital  system  –  hormonal 
contraceptives for systemic use- progestagens and estrogens, fixed combinations”. 
The  main  mechanism  by  which  the  combination  of  NOMAC-E2  provides  its  contraceptive  effect  is 
ovulation  inhibition.  Additional  mechanisms  concern  the  induction  of  cervical  mucus  impenetrable  to 
sperm  and  induction  of  an  atrophic  endometrium  which  is  not  suitable  for  nidation.  The  approved 
indication is oral contraception. One tablet is to be taken daily for 28 consecutive days.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Zoely  is  a  novel  oral  contraceptive  and  is  presented  as  film  coated  tablets,  containing  2.5  mg 
nomegestrol  acetate  and  1.5  mg  estradiol  packed  in  blisters.  Each  blister  contains  24  white  active 
tablets with 4 placebo tablets. 
Page 7/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Estradiol hemihydrate 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol  hemihydrate.  The  molecular 
formula  of  active  substance  is  C18H24O2,½H2O.  Its  relative  molecular  mass  is 281.4  and  its  structural 
formula is shown below: 
Estradiol hemihydrate is a white or almost white, crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water and 
sparingly soluble in ethanol. According to the presented results estradiol has several polymorphic forms 
and exhibits a strong tendency to form solvates. It has been demonstrated however that the proposed 
manufacturing process consistently yields the desired form. 
Manufacture 
A  Certificate  of  Suitability  (CEP)  has  been  provided  for  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the 
proposed supplier covering the manufacturing. The CEP also contains a declaration about the absence 
of use of material of human or animal origin in the manufacture of the substance. 
Specification 
Estradiol  hemihydrate  is described  in the  European  Pharmacopoeia  (Ph.  Eur).  The  specification  of  the 
active substance as set up by the drug product manufacturer includes tests and limits for appearance 
and  colour  (visual),  identification  (IR,  UV,  melting  range),  impurities  (HPLC),  assay  (Ph.Eur.,  HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), water (Ph.Eur.) and particle size (LDS). 
A specific control of the polymorphic form is not included in the specification because the most stable 
polymorphic  form  is  used,  and  polymorphism  is  not  considered  a  critical  quality  attribute  in  the  unit 
operations utilised in the drug product manufacturing process. 
Stability 
The retest period is covered by the CEP. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
Active Substance 
Nomegestrol acetate  
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  17α-acetoxy-6-methyl-19-norpregna-4,6-dien-3,20-
dione. The molecular formula of active substance is C23H 30O4 and the relative molecular mass 370.48 
and its structural formula is shown below: 
Nomegestrol  acetate  is  a  white  to  off-white  non-hygroscopic  crystalline  powder.  It  is  practically 
insoluble in water. The partition coefficient at 25°C: logP (octanol/purified water) was found 3.70.

It  has  6  asymmetric  carbons:  the  isomers  in  C8,  C9,  C10,  C13  and  C14  are  determined  by  the  ring 
structure. Structural inversion is not possible without ring rupture for these isomers. 
Nomegestrol  acetate  shows  polymorphism.  A  number  of  different  polymorphs  were  found.  In  the 
manufacturing process conditions however, it is only possible to obtain one form.  
Manufacture 
For  nomegestrol  acetate  an  ASMF  has  been  provided.  The  route  of  synthesis  as  it  is  included  in  the 
submitted  ASMF  is  adequately  described.  Specifications  for  starting  material,  reagents,  and 
intermediates  were  given.  In-process  controls  are  described.  Carry-over  of  potentially  toxic  reagents 
was discussed and justification for non-routine control was presented.  
Specification 
Nomegestrol  acetate  is  described  in  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  (Ph.  Eur).  The  specification  of  the 
active substance as set up by the drug product manufacturer includes tests and limits for appearance 
and  colour  (visual),  identification  (Ph.Eur.),  impurities  (HPLC,  ICP),  assay  (HPLC),    residual  solvents 
(GC), optical rotation (Ph.Eur.), loss on drying (Ph.Eur.), and particle size (LDS). In addition the active 
substance  supplier  includes  the  two  following  tests  in  the  specification  for  nomegestrol  acetate: 
appearance of solution (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.) and sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.). 
Analysis  results  from  the  ASMF  holder  were  provided  for  three  batches.  All  results  comply  with  the 
proposed  specifications.  Analysis  results  from  the  applicant  were  provided  for  nomegestrol  acetate 
batches  used  in  clinical,  development  and  stability  studies.  All  results  except  particle  size  distribution 
comply  with  the  proposed  specifications  which  have  been  refined  through  development  and  revised 
during procedure.. Batch consistency was demonstrated. 
Stability 
The  stability  studies  on  nomegestrol  acetate  drug  substance  are  performed  under  ICH  storage 
conditions  on  three  commercial  batches.  The  samples  for  stability  study  were  stored  in  similar 
containers  to  those  used  for  industrial  batches  for  up  to  36  months  under  25°C/60%RH  and  for  six 
months at 40°C/75%RH. 
The  results  showed  that  the  substance  remains  within  the  specifications,  moreover  no  significant 
changes in the data can be observed. Supportive stability data for four batches were attached, which 
indicate  that  the  stability  is  not  adversely  affected  by  particle  size  reduction.  One  batch  of  drug 
substance  was  exposed  to  heat,  light,  acid,  alkaline  and  neutral  pH,  oxidising  medium  and  radical 
initiator  medium.  Results  indicated  that  the  drug  substance  is  not  sensitive  to  light  in  the  solid  state 
but  it  slightly  degraded  when  exposed  to  heat  in  the  solid  state  and,  in  solution,  it  is  hydrolysed  to 
nomegestrol. It is not sensitive to an oxidising medium but degraded in presence of the radical initiator 
medium  which  was  subjected  to.  Based  on  the  presented  information  the  proposed  retest  period  is 
accepted.  In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or 
significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Nomegestrol acetate and estradiol hemihydrate are commercially available in the EU in other products. 
These products were the starting products to establish the contraceptive efficacy of this combination. 
Based  on  these  results  a  combination  tablet  has  been  developed.  The  drug  product  consists  of  a 
combination  of  24  active,  white  film-coated  tablets,  each  containing  2.5  mg  of  nomegestrol  acetate 
and  1.5  mg  of  estradiol,  and  4  placebo  yellow  film-coated  tablets,  packed  together  in  a  blister.  The 
colour  of  the  film-coat  enables  to  distinguish  between  active  and  placebo  tablets  and  also  serves  to 
reduce health, safety and environment (HSE) risks during packaging. The objective for the formulation 
development  was  obtaining  comparable  pharmacokinetic  profiles  as  obtained  in  phase  IIA  and  IIB 
studies. Both active substances are BCS class II compounds (low solubility and high permeability). 
Initially,  two  formulations  and  two  different  manufacturing  approaches  have  been  tried.  Since  the 
dissolution  profiles  were  similar  for  both  developed  products,  the  simplest  formulation  and 
Page 9/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
manufacturing  process  were  preferred.  The  placebo  tablets  developed  were  directly  derived  from  the 
formula  and  manufacturing  process  of  the  active  tablet.  To  avoid  the  risk  of  any  mix-up  during  the 
packaging it was decided to differentiate the placebo tablet from the active ones by the addition of a 
coloured film coat. 
Excipients  were  selected  based  on  their  previously  established  compatibility  with  the  same  active 
substances in other products. Their amount has been optimized. The amount of the film-coat has been 
optimized  with  regard  to  disintegration  time  and  dissolution.  For  comparability  reasons  with  the 
uncoated  drug  product  an  extensive  set  of  dissolution  experiments  were  performed.  No  effect  of  the 
film coat layer was found.  
After  the  production  of  the  pivotal  clinical  batches,  a  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  based  approach  was 
applied. The science- and risk- based pharmaceutical development studies performed and a reasonably 
wide  range  for  the  different  (potentially)  critical  quality  attributes  and  process  parameters  has  been 
investigated during development of drug product. Critical Quality Attributes that impact safety, efficacy 
and/or  manufacturability  have  been  identified  and  risk  management  processes  have  been  used  to 
facilitate risk reduction. The applicant has carried out extensive development studies in order to better 
understand and control the manufacturing process. However, no multifactorial (design of experiments) 
or full interaction studies have been carried out to address the potential impact of interactions between 
attributes and/or parameters on drug product quality. Instead, the impact of attributes/parameters on 
drug  product  quality  has  been  studied  one  factor  at  a  time,  leading  to  a  satisfactory  set  of  proven 
acceptable  ranges.  A  NIR  on-line  PAT  application  has  been  developed  for  the  control  of  blend 
uniformity  of  active  tablets  and  the  performance  of  the  application  has  been  satisfactorily  optimised. 
Appropriate  control  strategy  has  been  implemented  based  on  the  knowledge  gained  from  the 
manufacture  of  the  pivotal  clinical  batches,  process  development  studies,  the  manufacture  of  the 
primary  stability  batches  and  the  scale-up  studies.  Appropriate  process  controls  and  monitoring  are 
described  for  both  active  and  placebo  tablets.  Because  the  selected  polymorphic  forms  are 
unambiguously  being  provided  by  the  drug  substance  manufacturers  and  show  very  good  stability, 
polymorphism is not considered a critical quality attribute. Studies were conducted varying the amount 
of  excipients  focusing  on  the  effect  on  critical  quality  attributes.  Results  confirmed  the  robustness  of 
the  formulation  and  production  process  since  relatively  large  intentional  variations  in  the  amounts  of 
the excipients in the tested ranges did not affect the quality of the drug product. 
The impact of the particle size distribution of the two active substances on the content uniformity and 
dissolution was evaluated and appropriate specifications have been set. The impact of moisture content 
on  disintegration,  dissolution,  and  processability  was  also  evaluated.  Results  show  that  disintegration 
and dissolution were not significantly affected.  The control of the environment parameters and the set 
specifications  for  moisture  content  of  excipients  assure  adequate  processability.  The  relationship 
between  disintegration  and  dissolution  has  been  investigated.  Disintegration  was  always  very  fast  for 
all  these  batches.  Over  the  range  of  disintegration  time  observed,  no  impact  was  displayed  on 
dissolution.  The  differences  of  the  formulations  studied  and  clinically  tested  during  development  of 
drug  product  and  the  intended  for  marketing  can  be  considered  minor  having  no  impact  on  drug 
product bioavailability.  
A  commitment  has  been  undertaken  by  the  applicant  that  before  application  in  routine,  the 
performance  with  the  final  optimised  settings  will  be  validated  on  industrial  scale  batches.    For  these 
batches,  the  NIR  application  will  be  used  to  control  the  mixing  time  and  it  will  be  demonstrated  by 
comparison  with  extended  blend  sampling  and  tablet  stratified  sampling  that  the  NIR  end-point 
criterion corresponds to a uniform blend. If needed, the applicant should submit appropriate variations 
to change the NIR method parameters or equipment. 
Adventitious agents 
Only lactose is of animal origin. Satisfactory documentation has been provided that lactose used in the 
manufacture is in compliance with the Note for Guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal 
spongiform  encephalopathy  agents  via  human  and  veterinary  medicinal  products  (EMEA  410/01  Rev. 
2). 
Manufacture of the product 
Satisfactory  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  is  provided  for  both  the  active  and  placebo 
tablets.  Both  the  critical  and  the  potentially  critical  process  parameters  and  quality  attributes,  were 
Page 10/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
defined.  IPCs  and  critical  steps  are  specified.  The  process  controls  are  derived  from  the  risk  and 
science based development approach. 
Process validation scheme for the manufacturing scale batches was presented. As the estradiol active 
substance  content  of  the  tablet  is  below  2%  the  manufacturing  process  is  not  considered  to  be  a 
standard  one.  Validation  report  should  be  submitted  according  to  the  guideline  CPMP/QWP/848/96 
Process  validation.  Manufacturing  process  of  active  and  placebo  tablets  is  considered  validated  at  full 
scale at the claimed manufacturing site. A commitment is undertaken by the applicant to validate the 
manufacturing process on the three consecutive commercial batches of active and placebo tablets. 
Product specification 
The  active  tablets  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  tests  and  limits  for:  appearance  and 
colour  (Ph.Eur.),  identification  (HPLC  or  UHPLC-  at  release  only),  assay  (HPLC  or  UHPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC  or  UHPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.  -  at  release  only),  dissolution  (Ph.Eur.)  and 
microbial  tests  (Ph.Eur.).  The  placebo  tablets  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include  tests  and 
limits  for:  appearance  and  colour  (Ph.Eur.),  identification  (HPLC  or  UHPLC-  at  release  only)  and 
microbial tests (Ph.Eur.). 
For the active tablets, results from six primary stability batches and two commercial size batches were 
presented.  Supportive  data  from  another  13  batches  manufactured  at  different  sites  as  well  as 
historical batches (not film coated) were also provided. 
The  data  provided  on  the  batches  described  above  include  batch  analysis  data  and  data  on  stratified 
sampling.  A  comparison  of  the  performance  of  the  methods  used  over  the  course  of  development  is 
provided. The results are comparable. 
All  active  tablets  batch  data  met  the  specifications and  confirmed  the  suitability  of  the  same.  For  the 
placebo  tablets,  results  from  one  primary  stability  batch  and  one  commercial  size  batch  were 
presented. Supportive data from one pivotal clinical manufactured at a different site was also provided. 
The composition of the commercial scale batch is identical to the market formulation of placebo tablets. 
The composition of the other two batches is equivalent to the market formulation, with the exception 
of colour. All results comply with the proposed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Six  primary  stability  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  commercial  formulation  were  put  on 
stability  studies  at  ICH  conditions.  The  container  closure  system  is  identical  to  that  proposed  for  the 
commercial product except for the use of a coloured lidding foil.  
Results have been provided for up to 24 months at 5C/ambient RH, up to 24 months at 25 C/60% RH, 
30 C/40% RH and 30 C/75% RH and up to 6 months at 40 C/75% RH. 
No  relevant  changes  in  active  substances  content  or  individual  impurities  were  observed.  All  other 
parameters remained within the specifications. 
Stability  data  of  seven  supporting  stability  batches have  also  been  provided.  The  compositions  of  the 
tablets  are  identical  to  the  proposed  marketing  formulation,  manufacturing  site  and  process  and  the 
packaging is the same as for the primary stability batches. Results of three scale up batches are also 
provided. Stability results for the supportive batches are in line with the results of the primary stability 
batches.  Two  primary  stability  batches  were  involved  into  the  photostability  studies.  There  were  no 
significant changes in the packed and unpacked product for the tested parameters. 
Stability  studies  were  also  provided  for  three  placebo  batches;  one  primary  stability  batch,  one 
supportive and one clinical batch. All batches were packed in the commercial blister. 
Results have been provided for up to 24 months for the primary stability batch and up to 33 months 
for the other two batches at 5C/ambient RH, 25 C/60% RH, 30 C/40% RH and 30 C/75% RH and 
up to 6 months at 40 C/75% RH. The yellow colour used for the intended commercial placebo tablet 
shows no change under the various temperature and humidity conditions. 
The overall stability results support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions.

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Zoely  film-coated  tablets  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with 
the conditions defined in the SmPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug 
substances  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  quality  of  the  active  substances  is 
considered  sufficiently  described  and  adequately  supported  by  data.  Sufficient  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  product 
has been presented. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product 
quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one quality issue that will be resolved 
as Follow-up Measure within an agreed timeframe. This issue relates to validation of commercial scale 
batches  and  the  use  of  the  NIR  application  as  control  of  the  mixing.  However,  this  issue  is  not 
expected to have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
NOMAC-E2  is  a  monophasic  combined oral  contraceptive  (COC) combining  the  natural  estrogen,  17-
estradiol  (E2)  and  nomegestrol  acetate  (NOMAC),  a  19-norprogesterone  progestin  with  a  potent 
gonadotropin-inhibiting  effect  in  females.  NOMAC  binds  with  a  strong  affinity  to  the  progesterone 
receptor (PR) derived from hormone-sensitive cell lines and tissues from rat, rabbit, and human origin 
and  has  no  activity  on  other  steroid  receptors  with the  exception  of  a  weak  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  anti-
androgenic activity. Non- clinical studies showed that NOMAC exhibits the profile of a full progestogen, 
which  is  intrinsically  active  by  the  oral  route.  NOMAC  inhibits  ovulation  in  the  rat  and  monkey. 
Moreover,  NOMAC  displays  anti-androgenic  activity,  anti-estrogenic  activity,  and  pituitary  inhibitory 
potency.  The  estrogen  contained  in  Zoely  is  17β-estradiol,  a  natural  estrogen  identical  to  the 
endogenous human 17β-estradiol. E2 is combined with NOMAC in order to compensate the decrease of 
the  endogenous  estrogen  production  (anti-gonadotropic  effect  of  NOMAC).  E2  may  also  reinforce  the 
anti-gonadotropic effect of NOMAC, measured by FSH and LH blood levels.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
A full non-clinical testing program was performed for NOMAC. The estrogen in NOMAC-E2, being 17β-
estradiol,  is  a  well-established  pharmaceutical  product  and  concerning  its  effects  and  metabolism 
abundant literature data are available. Therefore, no non-clinical studies with E2 alone were performed 
during the development of NOMAC-E2. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
Receptor  binding  studies  have  shown  that  NOMAC  binds  with  a  high  affinity  to  the  progesterone 
receptor  (PR)  in  various  hormone  sensitive  cell  lines  derived  from  rat,  rabbit  or  human  and 
transactivates  human  PR  in  HeLa  and  CHO  cells  transfected  with  progesterone  receptor  B  (PRB). 
NOMAC  showed  anti-androgenic  activity  with  an  IC 50  value  of  92,1  nmol/L.  NOMAC  does  not  show 
(anti)-mineralocorticoid activity.

In  vivo,  NOMAC  exhibited  the  profile  of  a  full  progestogen  in  classical  progestagenic  bioassays 
performed  in  rabbits  (Mc  Phail  and  Mc  Ginty  tests)  and  rats.  NOMAC  induced  a  high  decidual 
proliferation/  differentiation  in  immature  estrogen-primed  female  rabbits  and  induces  a  decidual 
reaction  after  trauma  of  the  uterine  horn  of  the  rat.  NOMAC  had  a  strong  anti-gonadotropic  activity, 
which resulted in an inhibition of spontaneous ovulation in rats and monkeys.  The oral ID50 (inhibition 
of  ovulation  in  50%  of  treated  animals)  was  0,5  mg/kg  and  0,2  mg/kg  in  rats  and  monkeys 
respectively. Moreover, NOMAC displays anti-androgenic activity, anti-estrogenic activity and pituitary 
inhibitory potency. No in vivo pharmacodynamic studies were performed with the combination NOMAC-
E2. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
NOMAC  was  tested  in  combination  with  E2  in  studies  using  OVX  animals  in  the  context  of  the 
development  of  NOMAC  in  HRT.  The  main  characteristic  of  NOMAC  was  its  neutral  effect  on  the 
beneficial  action  of  estradiol  in  non-genital  targets.  Combined  NOMAC  did  not  interfere  with  the 
beneficial  effects  of  E2.  NOMAC  had  a  strong  progestational  and  anti-estrogenic  effect  on  the  uterus 
and  significantly  reduced  the  proliferation  that  occurs  with  estradiol  alone.  NOMAC  alone  had  no 
functional impact on glucid and lipid metabolism at doses up to 10 times higher than the effective dose 
on  bone  in  rats.  In  combination  with  E2,  the  functional  impact  was  limited  to  amplification  of  the 
pharmacological. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
NOMAC was assessed for its effect on core battery safety pharmacology tests. Studies investigating the 
central nervous, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems and the hemodynamic study in anesthetized 
beagle  dog  were  performed  in  the  context  of  nomegestrol  acetate  development  in  Hormone 
Replacement  Therapy.  Additional  cardiovascular  safety  studies  (hERG  tail  current  study  in  stably 
transfected  HEK-293  cells  and  study  in  telemetered  Cynomolgus  monkeys)  were  recently  completed 
and were included in the MAA dossier. NOMAC did not produce any unexpected or toxic effects. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  performed  with  NOMAC-E2.  Two  human  drug 
interaction  studies  were  performed  in  which  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  NOMAC  were 
evaluated. 
The lack of formal pharmacodynamic interaction studies has been considered acceptable by the CHMP 
taking  into  account  that  the  interactions  of  progestogens  are  well  known  and  NOMAC-E2  has  been 
registered for HRT since 2003 in several European countries. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  of  NOMAC  have  been  investigated  in 
several species, especially in rats and monkeys at the time of the development of NOMAC in HRT. No 
specific pharmacokinetic animal studies were performed with the NOMAC-E2 combination. In addition, 
results of recent in vitro studies performed with NOMAC alone have been provided: in vitro metabolism 
in  human  hepatic  microsomes,  recombinant  CYP450s,  in  vitro  studies  investigating  the  inhibition  and 
induction of CYP450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein interaction study. 
Absorption 
NOMAC  was rapidly  absorbed  after  oral  administration  to  mice,  rats  and  monkeys.  After  a  single  oral 
dose,  the  T max  varied  between  0.25  to  0.5  h  (mouse),  1  to  2  h  (rat  and  monkey).  In  dogs,  the 
absorption  was  relatively  slow  with  a  Tmax  of  6.7  h.  Elimination  is  slow  in  human  and  monkey  as 
opposed to rodents. 
Regarding  E2,  subject  to  a  known  substantial  intestinal  and/or  liver  first-pass  effect,  there  is  a  large 
variability  in  humans  in  the  rate  of  absorption  with  median  Tmax  of  48  h  (min  –  max:  1.0  –  145  h) 
following  single  dose  of  1.5  mg  estradiol  and  mean  Cmax  of  253  ±  179  pg/ml.  Following  repeated 
dosing in humans, median Tmax is 6 h (min – max: 0.5 – 144 h) with mean Css, max of 86.0 ± 51.3 
pg/ml. Thus, this pivotal study, conducted with the to-be-marketed coated tablet shows that NOMAC is 
Page 13/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rapidly  absorbed  by  oral  route,  with  time  independent  kinetics.  As  expected  for  E2,  endogenous 
secretion and large first-pass effect give rise to large variability in its rate of absorption. 
Distribution 
NOMAC has a high plasma protein binding: around 91% in rats and rabbit, 93% in mouse and monkey 
and 95-97% in human. In human, albumin binds NOMAC (98%), indicating a major role for albumin in 
plasma protein binding. 
Following oral administration of [14C]-NOMAC to rats and monkeys, radioactivity was widely distributed. 
Distribution was principally to the liver in rat and monkey, stomach and adrenals in rat and intestine in 
monkey. No significant residues of radioactivity were observed at 96h after dosing in both species. 
Metabolism 
The  metabolism  of  NOMAC  involves  CYP450  enzymes.  In  vitro  studies  using  hepatic  microsomes  and 
recombinant  CYP450s  have  shown  that  several  CYP  are  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  NOMAC 
(CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19). NOMAC was extensively metabolized. The metabolism of NOMAC is 
characterized by hydroxylation reactions followed by conjugation. Moreover, in rabbit and rat plasma; 
monkey  and  human  urine,  a  deacetylated  metabolite  (nomegestrol)  was  observed.  Whereas  the  rat 
produced  2  major  urinary  metabolites,  the  pattern  in  monkey  was  significant  different  consisting  of 
essentially highly polar metabolites. 
Unchanged NOMAC accounted for 25-35% of total drug related material in circulation in human at 2h 
post  dosage  dropping  to  some  12-21%  at  48h  post  dosage.  By  comparison,  9%  of  radioactivity 
represented NOMAC at 1.5h in rat plasma, decreasing to 5% at 12h and a steady 1% of radioactivity 
represented NOMAC at 1.5h and 6 h in monkey plasma. Part of the circulating (at Cmax) and excreted 
(0-24 h) metabolites appears to be conjugated (i.e. phase 2 metabolites), especially in monkey (55%, 
both in urine and plasma) and human (30%, urine) and to a lesser extent in rats (12% in plasma and 
20%  in  urine).  By  enzymatic  degradation  the  conjugates  were  shown  to  be  mainly  glucuronides  and 
sulfates in all these species. 
Excretion 
In vivo excretion/mass balance studies with [14C]-NOMAC were carried out in monkeys and humans. 
NOMAC drug related material was observed in both urine and feces. The percentage of total dose 
recovered in feces was 74, 40-57 and 55-67 of the dose for female rats, monkeys and humans 
respectively. The percent of total dose recovered in urine was 19% in rats, 13-41% in monkeys and 
23-41% in human respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in vitro examined the potential of NOMAC to inhibit a range of CYP 
isoenzymes  or  to  cause  induction  of  cytochrome  P450  activities.  NOMAC  did  not  inhibit  or  cause 
induction  of  any  CYP450  activities  tested.  NOMAC  was  a  weak  inhibitor  of  P-gp-mediated  transport, 
50% inhibition occurred only above concentration of 3 M. Therefore, significant P-gp inhibition would 
only occur at plasma concentrations of at least 100 fold the Cmax. In-vivo interaction studies were not 
carried out in animals. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In  the  context  of  the  development  of  the  combination  of  NOMAC  and  E2  for  Hormone  Replacement 
Therapy, single and repeat-dose toxicity studies bridging studies were performed with the combination 
of NOMAC and E2, using a 0,4 E2/ NOMAC ratio.  
Single dose toxicity 
NOMAC  
Single dose toxicity was investigated in mice and rats following oral and intraperitoneal administration. 
The acute toxicity via the oral route is low, the maximum non-lethal dose being 2000 mg/kg or higher. 
Following  intraperitoneal  administration,  the  maximum  non-lethal  dose  is  705  and  385  mg/kg  for 
female mice and rats respectively.  
NOMAC-E2  oral  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  and  rats  at  maximum  doses  of  2000  mg/kg. 
Toxicity was low and appeared in form of mild hypoactivity and sedation. 
Page 14/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  the  NOMAC-E2  combination  (E2/NOMAC  ratio  of  0,4) 
have  been  performed  in  rats  and  Cynomolgus  monkeys  up  to  13  weeks  with  respectively  4  and  6 
weeks  of  recovery.  In  females  of  both  species,  an  increase  in  body  weight  and  in  food  consumption 
was  observed,  as  well  as  decrease  in  the  weight  of  the  ovaries  and  uterus,  mammary  hyperplasia, 
blockade  of  ovarian  activity,  and  in  monkeys  endometrial  hyperplasia.  In  addition,  two  13-week  oral 
toxicity studies were performed with the NOMAC-E2 combination using the E2-NOMAC ratio of 0,6; this  
is the ratio selected for the claimed contraceptive indication. The studies were performed in mouse and 
rats by oral gavage up to 13 weeks. 
Bridging  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  have  shown  toxic  effects  which  were  consistent  with  the 
amplification  of  the  hormonal  activity  which  is  predominantly  estrogenic.  The  estrogenic  effect  was 
apparent  in  biochemical  signs  such  as  anaemia  and  variations  in  coagulation  parameters  and  plasma 
lipid  levels,  and  was  also  shown  by  variations  in  the  weight  of  certain  organs,  including  decreased 
weight of the ovaries, thymus and spleen, and increased weight of the liver and pituitary and adrenal 
glands  depending  on  the  species.  This  was  often  related  to  pathological  changes  (inhibition  of  the 
ovarian function, endometrial hyperplasia, hyperactivity of the mammary glands). In terms of plasma 
level,  the  E2  highest  exposure  was  observed  in  monkey  and  the  NOMAC  highest  exposure  was 
observed in rat. 
The administration of the NOMAC-E2 combination to mice, rats and Cynomolgus monkeys exhibited a 
toxicological  profile  typical  of  an  estrogen-progestin  combination  (with  a  predominance  of  estrogenic 
effects, particularly in the rat). 
Genotoxicity 
NOMAC  had  no  mutagenic  potential.  A  battery  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  tests  have  been 
performed with NOMAC. None of the tests indicated any suspicion of genotoxicity. Therefore, no 
additional genotoxicity testing was performed with the NOMAC-E2 combination. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  performed  with  the  combination  NOMAC-E2.  This  was 
accepted since NOMAC had no carcinogenic effect in the rat and only induced mammary and pituitary 
tumors in mice, findings which are known for this class of compounds in rodents. Because of this and 
as  NOMAC  is  combined  to  an  approved  estrogen  known  for  its  carcinogenic  potential  in  animals,  the 
lack of carcinogenicity studies with the NOMAC-E2 combination is considered acceptable. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted with NOMAC in order to comply with 
recent  guidelines.  Specific  repro-toxicology  studies  have  been  carried  out  with  the  NOMAC-E2 
combination. No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted with E2.  
Teratology studies were performed in rat and rabbit with the NOMAC-E2 combination (E2/NOMAC ratio 
=  0,6).  Maternal  toxicity  was  observed  in  both  species  as  well  as  developmental  toxicity  which  were 
not observed with NOMAC alone. Developmental toxicity was evidenced by reduced fetal weights and 
embryo-fetal  viability.  In  rats,  development  delays  (reduced  ossification)  considered  related  to  the 
treatment were observed at the highest doses (NOMAC/E2 doses of 4 /2,4 and 10/2,4).   
The  NOAEL  was  established  at  NOMAC/E2  1/0,6  mg/kg/day  for  maternal  toxicity  and  fetus 
development. In rabbits, at the highest dose tested (NOMAC/E2 = 15/0,5)  there were increases in the 
litter and/or fetal incidences of thoracic hemi-vertebrae and sternal alterations. However, because the 
increase  in  post-implantation  loss  at  0,83/0,5  and  1,7/1  mg/kg/day  lowered  the  number  to  be 
examinated,  it  cannot  be  fully  ascertained  whatever  the  individual  fetal  alterations  seen  at  15/0,5 
mg/kg/day  would  not  have  been  occurred  in  these  dosage  groups.  In  rabbits,  no  NOAEL  could  be 
established for maternal toxicity and fetus development.  
The  maternal  toxicity  and  fetal  variations  observed  in  the  above  studies  appeared  at  systemic 
exposures  similar  to  or  slightly  higher  than  that  expected  in  the  woman,  indicating  that  changes 
observed  with  the  combination  were  related  to  the  presence  of  E2.  In  the  return  to  fertility  study 
Page 15/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performed  in  female  rats  with  the  NOMAC-E2  combination  up  to  16/9,6  mg/kg/day  for  2  weeks, 
females returned to normal fertility after a 2-week treatment withdrawal.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were not performed. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
The  metabolite  3  (or  TX  219),  which  has  been  under  development  for  a  different  pharmacological 
target, was investigated in 4-week toxicity studies in rat and dog using the subcutaneous route. There 
was no test substance related toxicity. 
Impurities 
The  specification  of  TX071  and  TX271,  which  are  two  potential  impurities  in  NOMAC  drug  substance, 
were  set  at  ≤  0.1%  and  thus  no  further  toxicological  qualification  was  needed  for  these  potential 
impurities. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The PEC  surface water for the active ingredients of NOMAC-E2 is as follows: 
For NOMAC : 
 
       PEC surface water (mg/L) = 2,5 x 0.01 / 200 x 10 = 0,0125 g/L 
 
       PEC surface water (mg/L) = 1,5 x 0.01 / 200 x 10 = 0,0075 g/L 
For E2 : 
The PEC surface water for NOMAC is above the guideline limit of 0.01 g/L,.     
Although the PEC  surface water for estradiol is below the Guideline limit, this drug substance is regarded as 
endocrine  disrupter.  [NOEC  0.003  μg/L  for  reproduction  in  the  fish,  Oryzias  latipes].  Since  the 
estimated  NOEC  for  estradiol  is  below  the  (reproduction)  threshold  of  0.01  μg/L,  the  PNEC  is  also  < 
0.01 μg/L. 
Therefore a Phase II environmental effect analysis and risk assessment has been performed. 
The ERA data provided a phase II assessment for each compound. These data include results of studies 
on  aquatic  organisms  performed  on  nomegestrol  acetate  according  to  the  principles  of  the  guideline 
and an extensive review of bibliographical data on 17β-estradiol. (see summary results below)

PEC/PNEC assessments: 
The  PEC/PNEC  ratios  with  respect  to  surface  water,  groundwater  and  micro-organisms  are  all 
substantially  less  than  1  and/or  0.1  for  NOMAC.  Based  on  these  data,  the  use  of  NOMAC  is  not 
considered to be a cause for concern relative to these environmental compartments. However, the log 
Kow value  suggests  a  potential  for  bioconcentration  in  aquatic  species,  so  it  is  therefore  necessary  to 
conduct a fish bioconcentration study. Based on log Koc values all below 4.0, the impact to terrestrial 
organisms  was  not  assessed.  An  assessment  of  bioconcentration  in  zebrafish  is  included  in  the 
following Phase II Tier B.

Phase II Tier B: (extended environmental for NOMAC)  
NOMAC  was  evaluated  in  a  bioconcentration  study  in  zebrafish  aged  4-6  months,  according  to  the 
guidelines  of  OECD  305  (Egeler  et  al.,  2009).  The  results  of  the  bioconcentration  study  in  zebrafish 
indicate  that  only  a  small  accumulation  occurs  in  the  uptake  phase.  BCF  values  expressed  based  on 
content  of  parent  compound  in  water  and  fish  were  14.8  and  15.0  for  the  low  and  high  exposures, 
respectively.  Two  other  radioactive  peaks  were  identified  in  the  fish  and  were  considered  to  be  polar 
metabolites  of  NOMAC.  Depuration  resulted  in  a  rapid  elimination  of  residues  from  the  fish,  with 
approximately 9.5% remaining after 10 days. 
Estradiol (E2) 
Phase II Tier A :  
PEC/PNEC assessments: 
The data from studies on aquatic species and sludge organisms were used to derive predicted no-effect 
concentrations (PNEC) for relevant environmental compartments. 
Regarding PNEC SURFACEWATER, numerous studies have been conducted with E2. The various fish species 
were  typically  much  more  sensitive  to  sub-chronic  and  chronic  exposure  to  E2  vs.  non-fish  species. 
Therefore  the  repeat  exposure  and  reproduction  studies  for  fish  species  were  reviewed  to  determine 
the most appropriate endpoint for deriving a PNECSURFACE WATER for E2. 
The full-life cycle study in Japanese medaka (Seki et al., 2005) was selected to derive the PNEC. This 
is  a  standard  life  cycle  study  that  evaluated  several  aspects  of  general  toxicity  and  reproductive 
function in the fish after exposure to E2. Of the life cycle and multigenerational studies, this study gave 
the lowest NOEC (2,6 ng/L) . The study of Lahnsteiner et al., (2006) provides supporting evidence for 
an effect of E2 on male fish as evidenced by decreased semen volume and semen fertility, but mating 
and reproduction were not evaluated as in a standard life cycle study. 
The PNEC GROUNDWATER, was derived from the NOEC in a full life-cycle toxicity study of daphnids using an 
assessment factor of 10. The NOEC for the reproduction study with Daphnia magna from (Brennan et 
al., 2006) was selected. The NOEC was >/= 200 mcg/L, based on survival. 
The PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water and groundwater are less than 1 and the PEC/PNEC ratio for the 
WTP is less than 0.1. Based on these results, the use of this product is not considered to pose a risk to 
the  aquatic  environment.  As  noted  previously,  however,  the  log  Kow  value  suggests  a  potential  for 
bioconcentration in aquatic species, so it is therefore required to conduct a fish bioconcentration study. 
Based on log Koc values all below 4.0, it is not required to assess the impact to terrestrial organisms. 
An  assessment  of  bioconcentration  in  relation  to  fish  and  other  species  is  included  in  the  following 
Phase II Tier B. Also as E2 is likely to partition to sediment to some extent, a discussion of potential 
impact to sediment organisms is included in Phase II Tier B. 
Phase II Tier B : extended environmental 
The  results  of  the  bioconcentration  studies  in  fish  indicate  that  bioconcentration  is  not  a  significant 
environmental  concern  for  these  species.  In  most  of  the  non-fish  species  a  similar  conclusion  can  be 
reached  based  on  relatively  low  BCFs.  The  results  from  the  studies  in  zebra  mussels  are  interesting, 
but seem to indicate that E2 is taken up by these organisms and stored in an inactive form. There is 
less data available concerning the effect of E2 on sediment organisms. However, based on analogy to 
EE2, a much more potent estrogen, it is not expected to have significant effects on sediment species. 
In conclusion, based on the above results, NOMAC-E2 does not appear to present a specific risk to the 
aquatic environment. However, given the hormonal activity of both components, nomegestrol acetate 
and  estradiol,  a  warning  has  been  included  in  the  relevant  section  of  the  product  SmPC  and  in  the 
package leaflet as follows: 
Page 18/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Zoely  tablets  no  longer  required  should  not  be  disposed  via  wastewater  or  the  municipal  drainage 
system. The hormonal active compounds in the tablet may have harmful effects if reaching the aquatic 
environment.  Return  them  to  a  pharmacy  or  dispose  them  in  another  safe  way  according  to  local 
requirements. These measures will help to protect the environment.” 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Three  dose  finding  clinical  trials  were  initially  performed  with  either  NOMAC  alone  (2.5  mg)  or 
subsequently  with  combination  of  1.5  mg  estradiol.  Based  on  the  results  of  these  clinical  trials  the 
combination of 2.5 mg NOMAC + 1.5 mg E2 was selected for the further clinical studies. The applicant 
justified  the  choice  of  the  24/4  regimen,  that  is  24  active  tablets  followed  by  4  placebo  tablets  by  a 
better bleeding profile, lower overall number of days with vaginal bleeding than the 21/7 regimen. The 
final  phase  clinical  program  started  in  May  2006  in  two  adequate  and  well-controlled  trials  (292001 
and 292002). The contraceptive effect of NOMAC-E2 was investigated and proved as compared to that 
of DRSP-EE 3.0 mg/30 µg reference product. These trials  generated evidence of contraceptive efficacy 
and sufficient general safety data. In the clinical phase III program the metabolic safety of the product 
including  effects  on  hemostasis,  lipid  metabolism,  carbohydrate  metabolism,  adrenal  and  thyroid 
function and effects of androgens were also investigated (trial 292004) and compared to those of LNG-
EE  (levonorgestrel  +  ethinylestradiol).  The  PK  of  NOMAC-E2  was  investigated  in  trial  292006  and 
292007.  The  contraceptive  mechanism  of  NOMAC-E2  vs.  DRSP-EE  was  studied  in  trial  292003.  The 
possible impact of NOMAC-E2 on QTc interval was studied in healthy women trial 292011. One study 
was  in  progress  aiming  to  study  the  impact  of  NOMAC-E2  on  bone  mineral  density.  One  study  was 
planned to investigate the PK properties of NOMAC-E2 in adolescents (trial 292008).  
The indication as claimed by the applicant was: 
Oral  contraception  in  fertile  women  including  post-menarcheal  adolescents  from  age  of  12 
years. 
The approved indication by the CHMP was: 
Oral contraception 
GCP 
The data submitted are derived from forty-one trials in the NOMAC-E2 clinical development program. 
Twenty trials were conducted in accordance with ICH-GCP, while twelve were conducted under EU-GCP. 
All  trials  were  conducted  with  the  approval  of  Ethics  Committees  or  Institutional  Review  Boards. 
However, six trials (LUT 5-03-01, LUT 5-21-01, LUT 5-22-01, LUT 5-17-01, LUT 4-13 and LUT 4-12-01) 
did  not  comply  with  the  principles  of  the  ICH-GCP  and  for  three  other  trials,  GCP  was  not  effective 
because  these  trials  were  performed  in  1982-1983  prior  to  the  implementation  of  GCP.  This  was 
accepted by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  large  number  of  pharmacokinetic  trials  and  BA/BE  studies  have  been  performed  in  women  of 
childbearing potential, post-menopausal women or men with NOMAC alone or different doses of NOMAC 
combined  with  E2.  However,  a  limited  number  of  trials  were  conducted  with  NOMAC-E2  at  the 
contraceptive  dose  of  NOMAC  2.5mg  –  E2  1.5mg  in  the  target  population,  i.e.  women  of  childbearing 
potential. These latter trials are presented while the others are considered as supportive.  
Table  1  summarises  the  main  pharmacodynamic  studies  performed  for  the  current  application 
(Mechanism of action, in trials employing combinations of 1.5mg E2 and various doses of NOMAC). The 
pharmacodynamic  properties  of  this  new  contraceptive  pill  have  been  established  in  different  steps. 
Thus,  a  complete  pharmacodynamic  program  to  assess  the  contraceptive  effect  of  this  NOMAC-E2  has 
been  performed  by  the  applicant.  Five  dose  ranging  studies  have  been  performed  first  to  sustain  the 
choice of the selected  NOMAC optimal dose. Of note, four of these studies are non compliant with the 
European  GCP  guidelines  and  ICH-GCP  as  they  were  performed  in  the  1980s  before  there  were 
guidelines  applied.  This is  not  of  concern  to  our  point  of  view as  complementary/additional  PD  studies 
Page 19/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have  been  performed  to  confirm  and  sustain  the  PD  effects  of  NOMAC-E2  mainly  on  the  inhibition  of 
ovulation.  
Thus,  the  main  PD  program  comprises  three  Phase  II  and  two  Phase  III  studies  that  assessed 
successively  the  selection  of  the  optimal  NOMAC  dose  in  combination  with  17-beta  estradiol  (96-
ESC/NOM-1-RD  and  98-ESC/NOM-1-RD),  the  selection  of  the  optimal  therapeutic  regimen  (03-
ESC/NOM-1-RD),  and  lastly  the  ovulation  inhibitory  properties  that  were  assessed  during  6  cycles  of 
treatment in study 292003.

Absorption  
During  the  formulation  development  program,  two  different  tableting  technologies  were  tested,  and. 
BA/BE  studies  were  conducted  to  finally  select  the  direct  compression  technology.  Later  on,  a  film 
coating  was  added  for  environment  reasons  as  well  as  to  improve  the  appearance  of  the  tablet  and 
other manufacturing changes were operated. 
The  pivotal  trial  292006  (with  film-coated,  direct  compression  tablet  TX127066)  was  specifically 
designed  to  assess  the  PK  profile  of  NOMAC-E2  (2.5mg/1.5mg)  as  administered  via  the  film  coated 
combined  tablet  formulation  after  multiple  and  single  oral  dosing  in  women  of  childbearing  potential. 
Thus,  this  pivotal  study, shows  that  NOMAC  is  rapidly  absorbed  by  oral  route,  with  time independent 
kinetics.  As  expected  for  E2,  endogenous  secretion  and  large  first-pass  effect  give  rise  to  large 
variability in its rate of absorption. 
Oral  absolute  bioavailability.  In  the  trial  INT00104097  (combined  analysis  of  trial  292006  and  trial 
307001),  the  absolute  bioavailability  of  NOMAC  from  the  combination  tablet  is  63.4%.  For  E2,  the 
absolute bioavailability is very low (with or without baseline correction), about 1%. This is a known and 
expected information as a result of pre-systemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. 
Bioequivalence.  Two  bioavailability-bioequivalence  studies  with  the  same  objectives  and  the  same 
study design were performed to compare, the two different tableting technologies of the combination 
NOMAC 2.5 mg– E2 1.5 mg with a capsule containing the same combination in two separate tablets: i) 
Trial 02-TX133066-1-RD and ii) Trial 02-TX127066-1-RD.  Both studies were open, randomised three-
way cross-over study performed in healthy volunteers.  
Based on the results of these two BA-BE studies, the Applicant selected the formulation that was most 
comparable to the capsule with respect to bioavailability for both components of the product. Therefore, 
all subsequent phase III trials and additional phase I trials were performed with this formulation. The 
change  from  an  uncoated  tablet  to  a  film-coated  tablet  was  supported  by  a  comparative  in  vitro 
dissolution study in different appropriate media. Three other changes to the manufactured tablet were 
also reported by the Applicant: i) change in mixer type for the blending step; ii) site and scale changes 
as part of the technology transfer iii) introduction of a milling step for drug substance  
To  bridge  between  this  new  intended  commercial  NOMAC-E2  combination  tablet  and  the  to-be-
marketed  tablet  an  IVIVC  trial  (Trial  292007)  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  relationship  between 
the  in  vitro  dissolution  curves  and  the  in  vivo  exposure.  In  brief,  six  batches  of  NOMAC-E2  were 
investigated in eighteen female subjects of child bearing potential.  
Subjects were randomly allocated to one of the six treatment sequences, each including two different 
batches.  Blood  samples  were  collected  up  to  144  hours  post  dose.  The  development  of  an  IVIVC-A 
level  model  was  undertaken,  following  the  recommended  procedures  (computing  resources: 
WinNonlin®  ver  5.2,  IVIVC  Toolkit,  IVIVC  Wizard).  Based  on  4  selected  batches  the  internal 
predictability  of  the  model  was  good,  with  absolute  percent  prediction  errors  below  the  guidance 
criterion  of  10%  for  Cmax  and  AUC.  However,  the  external  validation  results  with  the  two  remaining 
batches were not acceptable since the prediction error was greater than the guidance criterion of 10%. 
This  analysis  was  followed  by  a  population  pharmacokinetic  study  (not  discussed  here)  aimed  to 
characterize and quantify the influence of batch differences on the pharmacokinetics of NOMAC during 
simulated  steady-state  conditions.  As  main  result,  the  difference  in  the  in  vitro  dissolution  rate  of 
Cmax would tend to decrease from a single dose to a steady-state situation. 
Regarding  bioequivalence  between  the  to-be-marketed  formulation  and  subsequent  manufacturing 
changes,  a  major  issue  was  raised  by  the  CHMP.  Since  study  292007  failed  to  establish  a  relevant 
IVIVC-A level model, the Applicant was asked to perform an additional bioequivalence study between 
the intended to-be-marketed formulation and the final commercial tablet. This study (study P06328) is 
based  on  two  parallels  parts  conducted  in  two  separate  US  clinical  centers,  each  part  including  72 
healthy postmenopausal women in a replicate four-way crossover design. The first part was comparing 
the final commercial tablet batch CD078 versus the phase III batch CA057, while the second part was 
comparing this same final commercial tablet batch CD078 to the phase III batch CZ189.  
In Study P06328, bioequivalence with NOMAC and E2 has been shown between batch CA057 and the 
final commercial batch CD078. However, a similar conclusion could not be drawn for batch CZ189, as 
the  Cmax  value  for  NOMAC  is  higher  with  the  commercial  batch  CD078  compared  to  the  reference 
Batch CZ189 (Ratio test/ref= 137.5 (131.0;144.4).

The  updated  Level  A  (and  C)  IVIVC  analyses  have  confirmed  the  consistency  and  suitability  of  the 
established NOMAC relationship between in vitro dissolution and Cmax 
Influence of food.  
In trials 02-TX127066-1-RD and 02-TX133066-1-RD the effect of concomitant food on bioavailability of 
the combination NOMAC-E2 (2.5 mg – 1.5 mg) was also studied. The meal served was designated as 
“standard FDA meal”, to be consumed within 30 minutes before the drug intake. There is a moderate 
food effect on the bioavailability of NOMAC from either tableting technology, with on average, a 27% 
increase in the extent of systemic exposure and a more variable impact of 27 to 66% for the peak of 
exposure. For E2, food effect is probably less with geometric mean ratios very close to 1 for Cmax and 
AUC,  even  if  we  observe  very  wide  90%  confidence  intervals,  never  contained  within  the  regulatory 
interval  of  bioequivalence  (0.80  –  1.25).  The  CHMP  finally  agreed  that  the  food  effect  is  actually  not 
clinically relevant so that no recommendation with food should be mentioned in the SPC. 
Distribution 
NOMAC and E2 
 
In vitro 
In  vitro  studies  showed  NOMAC  to  be  highly  bound  (97-98%)  in  a  non  saturable  way  to  plasma 
proteins across a wide concentration range, including therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations. 
Albumin  displayed  a  high  binding  with  NOMAC  (98%)  thus  indicating  a  major  role  for  albumin  in 
plasma  protein  binding.  SHBG  and  CBG  on  the  other  hand  showed  no  detectable  NOMAC  binding. 
Estimation  of  red  blood  cell  uptake  gave  low  values  in  the  range  14  –  22%.  The  distribution  of 
exogenous  natural  estrogens  is  similar  to  that  of  endogenous  estrogens.  Estrogens  are  widely 
distributed  in  the  body  and  are  generally  found  in  higher  concentrations  in  the  sex  hormone  target 
organs.  In  plasma,  Estradiol  circulates  bound  to  SHBG  (37%)  and  to  albumin  (61%),  while  only 
approximately 1-2% is unbound. 
 
In vivo  
A  pooled  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (INT00101987),  described  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
NOMAC  using  a  two-compartment  model  and  resulted  in  a  total  apparent  volume  of  distribution 
([central  +  peripheral  volume  of  distribution]/F)  of  1246L.  Using  the  estimate  of  absolute 
bioavailability (63.4%), the overall volume of distribution of this analysis was calculated to be 790 L. 
Another  population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  (Trial  292007)  provided  a  total  apparent  volume  of 
distribution  ([central  +  peripheral  volume  of  distribution]/F)  of  946  L,  which  resulted  in  an  overall 
volume  of  distribution  of 600  L.  Both  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses were  in  line  with  the  non-
compartmental  distribution  volumes  (979  and  662  L)  following  intravenous  administration.  The 
relatively large volume of distribution of NOMAC indicates extravascular distribution and is in line with 
the lipophilicity of NOMAC.  
In  conclusion,  NOMAC  is  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins  (consistently  over  97%)  while  displaying  a 
very  large  volume  of  distribution  (over  20  l/kg).  Thus,  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  drug-drug 
interaction may occur because of drug protein displacement. 
Elimination 
Several studies were performed to study the excretion of NOMAC. Trials INT00104097 and 292006 were 
performed  in  women  with  childbearing  potential.  Trials  LUT-4-06-01,  LUT  4-12  and  LUT  4.13  were 
performed  in  healthy  post  menopausal  women.  In  summary,  with  NOMAC,  the  total  amount  of 
radioactivity  recovered  within  the  first  24  h  post  dose  is  high,  at  least  90%.  Since  the  oral  absolute 
bioavailability  is  estimated  around  64%,  the  radioactivity  recovered  in  faeces  comes  likely  from 
unabsorbed  drug  and/or  from  enterohepatic  recycling.  In  urine,  unchanged  NOMAC  is  low  or 
undetectable  which  in  turn  means  the  presence  of  various  conjugated  or  unconjugated  polar 
metabolites. With exogenous E2, less information is available. However, the fate of the natural hormone 
is  rather  well  established  elsewhere  so  that  no  further  requirement  is  needed  from  a  pharmacokinetic 
point of view.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  post-menopausal  women,  dose  proportionality  was  investigated  at  steady-state  and  established 
across a NOMAC dose range of 0.625 mg - 5 mg (NOMAC in combination with 2 mg estradiol valerate, 
Trial 96-LUT-1-RD). In another trial (Trial 98-ESC-NOM) dose linearity (0.625 mg – 2.5 mg NOMAC with 
1.5 mg E2) was observed in women of childbearing potential.  
In summary, no accumulation of NOMAC is observed following single administration of a dose ranging 
from  0.625  mg  to  12.5  mg  for  14  days.  The  range  of  linearity  is  probably  much  wider.  Dose 
proportionality and time independency of NOMAC pharmacokinetics have been correctly demonstrated. 
Since  NOMAC  can  interfere  with  endogenous  E2  secretion  in  women  of  child-bearing  potential,  it  is 
noted that methodological difficulties were overcome to reliably evaluate dose proportionality and time 
dependency with exogenous E2. 
Regarding time dependency, NOMAC is considered a substrate for cytochrome P450 without inhibitory 
or  inducer  properties.  The  film  coated  tablet  NOMAC-E2  (2.5–1.5  mg)  gave  similar  data  between 
infinite  AUC  after  single  dose  (112  hxng/ml)  and  steady-state  AUC0-24  (106  hxng/ml)  in  women  of 
child  bearing  potential  (Trial  292006),  suggesting  time-independent  pharmacokinetics.  Same  results 
were observed in 24 post-menopausal women with the fixed combination NOMAC-E2 (3.75 – 1.5 mg) 
following  single  and  repeated  dosing  for  14  days  (Trial  95-TX323/NOM-2-RD)  with  mean  AUC0-72h 
(first dose) of 180.7 hxng/ml and AUCss on day 14 of 209.8 hxng/ml. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
No study has been performed in patients with renal insufficiency and this population was excluded from 
pivotal  trials  292001  and  292002  due  to  the  known  antimineralocorticoid  activity  of  the  comparator 
drospirenone.  However,  no  specific  issue  is  expected  in  the  target  population  as  nomegestrol  acetate 
does not have any mineralocorticoid activity.  
Impaired hepatic function 
No  study  has  been  performed  in  patients  with  hepatic  insufficiency  and  this  population  was  excluded 
from  pivotal  trials  292001  and  292002  due  to  the  known  antimineralocorticoid  activity  of  the 
comparator  drospirenone.  However,  no  specific  issue  is  expected  in  the  target  population  as 
nomegestrol acetate does not have any mineralocorticoid activity. 
Gender 
N/A 
Race 
Studies  INT001016987  and  INT00105057  showed  the  impact  of  race,  age  and  BMI.  In  addition,  a 
population PK model was developed to evaluate the effects of the covariates age, race and BMI on the 
pharmacokinetics of NOMAC.  
The analysis was performed on data gathered from studies 292006 and 292002. The database is rather 
small  with  1139  NOMAC  plasma  concentrations  from  75  Caucasian  (92.6%),  4  black/African  American 
(4.9%) and 2 Asian (2.5%) women of child bearing potential. The average age was 29 y (range: 18 – 
47), the average weight was 61.9 kg (range: 44.2 – 97.5) and the average BMI was 23.3 kg/m2 (18.3 – 
34).  The  statistical  analysis  was  performed  with  NonMen  ver.  VI  (method  FOCEI).  The  technical 
management of this population PK analysis follows the recommended procedures. No external validation 
of  the  model  was  done  but  its  reliability  is  evaluated  by  a  bootstrap  approach.  This  is  acceptable  for 
such a database. 
Despite  a  rich  data  subpopulation,  the  structural  PK  model  did  not  perform  well  for  the  absorption 
phase, leading to the incorporation in the final model of a separate first order absorption rate constant 
for single dose and multiple dose (assumed to be caused by food effect), as well as a single lag-time 
parameter.  However,  this  “data-driven”  model  could  be  considered  as  poorly  reflecting  the  true 
pharmacokinetic  profile  of  NOMAC.  At  Day  150,  the  applicant  satisfactorily  answered  this  question. 
Indeed,  from  a  strict  clinical  point  of  view,  we  could  consider  as  not  relevant  the  influence  of  food. 
However,  from  a  strictly  PK  point  of  view,  this  latter  effect  should  be  incorporated  in  the  modelling 
process  to  obtain  a  good  estimate  for  Cmax.  At  fasting  state,  median  Tmax  for  NOMAC  is  around  2h 
with food, we observe a further delay of at least 1h. The reasonable sized, the limited number of blood 
samples around delayed Tmax may explain the difficulty to estimate Ka with food, and so Cmax.

Finally, the results of this population approach are not adding a lot to the general knowledge of NOMAC-
E2 pharmacokinetics in the target population. No effect of age (in the limited range 18 – 47 y) or race 
was identified but for this latter covariate, there is an obvious lack of data. The covariate BMI was the 
only covariate incorporated in the final model. However, its contribution is small since, compared to the 
typical median CL/F value of 26.8 l/h, we observed a 12%-increase in CL/F with low BMI and a 19.8%-
decrease in CL/F with high BMI. So, no dose adjustment is to be done based on BMI. 
Overall, the effects of age, weight, race, renal and/or liver insufficiency on NOMAC-E2 pharmacokinetics 
can be considered as correctly investigated, not forgetting the important  study in younger adolescents.  
Weight 
NOMAC pharmacokinetics were modeled with a 2-compartment model with first order absorption, a lag 
time on absorption and first order elimination. The volume of distribution (V2) was estimated to be 252 
L  with  a  clearance  (CL)  of  26.8  L·h-1.  Both  clearance  and  relative  bioavailability  were  found  to 
decrease  exponentially  with  BMI.  Combined  this  resulted  in  a  small  decrease  of  CL/F  with  increasing 
BMI. Although no effect of BMI on the volume of distribution was identified in the covariate analysis, a 
distribution phenomenon could also be a reason for the modest decrease in CL/F given the lipophilicity 
and high protein binding of NOMAC. Furthermore, no effects of age or race were identified.  
Elderly 
In  Trial  LUT  4-28-01  it  has  been  showed,  that  endogenous  E2  has  no  influence  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  NOMAC.  E2  status  does  not  influence  the  kinetics  of  NOMAC  but  the  opposite  is 
not  true.  NOMAC  via  suppressing  the  endogenous  E2  synthesis  and/or  by  inducing  17-beta-
hydroxysteroiddehydrogenase  has  significant  effect  on  the  kinetics  of  E2.  Increase  of  SHBG  (sex 
hormone binding globulin) level is a third contributing factor. 
Children 
An exploratory population pharmacokinetic analysis of NOMAC using physiology-based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK)  modelling  with  special  emphasis  on  effects  associated  with  age  and  BMI  in  post  menarche 
females (Trial INT00105057) was submitted. This analysis showed that no significant differences in the 
plasma  pharmacokinetics  of  NOMAC  after  repeated  oral  administration  in  post  menarche  females  or 
adolescents are expected in comparison to the female adult reference population. Moreover, the PBPK 
simulations  indicate  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  NOMAC  in  post-menarche  females  is  depending  on 
the BMI (i.e. (re)distribution) rather than the age. So the WB-PBPK modeling, confirms the expectation 
that no significant age dependence on the pharmacokinetics of NOMAC is expected in post-menarcheal 
adolescent females aged 12 to 17 years compared to adult females (18 to 50 years).  
In  the  study  report,  PBPK  models  have  been  generally  used  to  predict  the  pharmacokinetics  of  toxic 
chemicals.  One  can  also  understand  their  implementation  in  support  of  drug  development.  However, 
there is still a long way to go before  considering them as a cornerstone for drug approval since their 
practice remains confidential. By definition, a PBPK model requires a realistic description of the human 
physiology  so  that  the  model  structure  is  predetermined  and  almost  independent  of  the  drug  of 
interest.  Precisely,  the  main  criticism  of  this  approach  remains  the  risk  of inaccurate  prediction if  the 
underlying assumptions of the mechanistic equations are not met.  As requested by the PDCO, in order 
to  further  support  the  expectation  that  pharmacokinetic  data  will  be  similar,  a  single  dose 
pharmacokinetic trial with NOMAC-E2 in post-menarcheal adolescents and adults has been performed.  
The primary objective of trial 292008 was to compare the pharmacokinetics of NOMAC between female 
adolescents (aged 14-17) and female adults (aged 18-50) after single dose administration of NOMAC-
E2 while secondary objectives were to explore the pharmacokinetics of E2 and estrone, the safety and 
tolerability  of  NOMAC-E2  and,  if  possible,  to  identify  the  major  metabolites  of  NOMAC  in  plasma  and 
urine of the female adults.  
Study  292008  shows  that  there  is  less  than  30%  difference  in  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  NOMAC 
following  a  single  2.5  mg  dose  between  adolescent  and  adult  populations,  so  the  profiles  are 
considered similar. 
For E2, a substantial variability in E2 and E1 serum levels was observed. A lower total exposure to E2 
is  observed  (AUCtlast  until  129  h  after  dosing)  in  adolescents  as  compared  to  adults  (-  36%  for 
adolescents  versus  adults).  This  can  be  explained  by  the  single  dose  design  of  the  study,  i.e.  the 
women were not synchronized for their natural menstrual cycle, leading to fluctuating endogenous E2 
and  E1  levels.  Beyond  24  hours,  taking  also  the  short  half-life  of  E2 into  consideration  (3.6 ± 1.5 h), 
the relative larger endogenous contribution in adults might cause AUCtlast values to differ. 
Page 25/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore,  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  these  results  about  the  pharmacokinetics  of  E2  in  both 
groups,  in  the  absence  of  a  repeated  dose  study,  with  synchronisation  of  the  cycles  and  baseline 
correction for E2. 
The CHMP therefore agreed that no extrapolation of efficacy and safety results as found in the phase 
III  clinical  program  for  adults  can  be  made  to  the  post-menarcheal  adolescent  population.  Indeed, 
lower  E2  levels  were  observed  in  the  adolescent  population  aged  14-17  years  compared  to  an  adult 
population.  It  seems  difficult  in  that  context  to  also  extrapolate  pharmacokinetic,  efficacy  and  safety 
data observed in the 14-17 years to the 12-13 years age group.  Thus, the applicant’ proposal to only 
accept the following indication “Oral contraception” (Section 4.1.) and deleting all reference to “fertile 
women  including  post  menarcheal  adolescents  from  the  age  of  12  years”  has  been  endorsed  by  the 
CHMP. Information regarding the pediatric population in the respective sections of the SmPC has been 
agreed on by the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
 
In vitro 
In vitro studies showed that NOMAC is unlikely to affect the metabolism of co-administered drugs, as it 
has no direct or indirect cytochrome P450 inducing or inhibitory properties on CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5. 
 
In vivo 
Two drug interaction trials were performed with a higher dosed-NOMAC -E2 combination (3.75 mg-1.5 
mg)  in  post-menopausal  women  (Naemis®):  i)  trial  NOM-OEST  4-04  (Interaction  with  rifampicin);  ii) 
trial NOM-OEST 4-05 (Interaction with ketoconazole) 
Interaction  studies  with  a  metabolic  inducer  showed  that  rifampicin  interacts  with  the  NOMAC/E2 
combination,  as  it  is  the  case  with  other  estrogen-progestin  combinations.  Rifampicin  considerably 
accelerated NOMAC metabolism, causing a ten-fold decrease in the peak and a twenty-fold reduction of 
the  AUC.  Conversely,  estradiol  metabolism  was  slowed  down  and  the  peak,  which  occurs  earlier, 
increased by 2.6 while the AUC increased by 20 %. These issues  must be taken into account when a 
patient  is  under  treatment  with  an  enzymatic  inducer  such  as  rifampicin,  anticonvulsants,  or  anti-
infectives,  known  to  be  enzyme  inducers,  since  increased  NOMAC  metabolism  associated  with  delayed 
E2 metabolism could lead to an estrogen-progestin imbalance which would have clinical consequences. 
However, ketoconazole does not modify or only slightly modifies E2 metabolism. Its effect on NOMAC is 
more significant, in particular on Cmax. Nevertheless, the increase in the peak and AUC of NOMAC may 
not cause any clinical consequence on safety side since the safety margin is quite large.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) is a highly selective progestin derived from, and structurally similar to, 
the naturally occurring steroid hormone, progesterone. NOMAC is combined with 17-beta estradiol (E2). 
This estrogen is identical to the endogenous human E2 and is therefore classified as a natural estrogen. 
The  co-administration  of estrogen  results  in  a  more  stable  endometrium,  which  greatly reduces  cycle 
irregularities,  especially  when  a  pill-free  interval  is  cyclically  scheduled  to  allow  for  a  hormone 
withdrawal bleeding. In addition, estrogen adds to ovulation-inhibition. The main mechanism by which 
the  combination  of  NOMAC-E2  provides  contraceptive  effect  is  ovulation  inhibition.  Additional 
mechanisms  concern  the  induction  of  cervical  mucus  impenetrable  to  sperm  and  induction  of  an 
atrophic endometrium which is not suitable for nidation.  
The  progestagen  nomegestrol  acetate  (NOMAC)  and  the  estrogen  17  beta  estradiol  (E2)  are  well-
known  substances  of  which  pharmacological  properties  are  well  known  and  have  already  been 
extensively studied. Both substances already exist on the market associated together or not. However, 
the combination of NOMAC and 17 beta estradiol has never been used for contraception in women of 
childbearing potential. 
Page 26/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Five  dose  ranging  studies  have  been  performed  first  to  sustain  the  choice  of  the  selected  NOMAC 
optimal dose. The pharmacodynamic program for NOMAC comprises three Phase II and two Phase III 
studies  that  assessed  the  selection  of the  optimal NOMAC  dose  in  combination  with  17-beta  estradiol 
(96-ESC/NOM-1-RD  and  98-ESC/NOM-1-RD),  the  selection  of  the  optimal  therapeutic  regimen  (03-
ESC/NOM-1-RD),  and  lastly  the  ovulation  inhibitory  properties  that  were  assessed  during  6  cycles  of 
treatment in study 292003.  
Dose  ranging  studies  showed  that  NOMAC  inhibited  ovulation  at  daily  doses  of  1.25  or  more.  Dose 
dependent  effects  of  NOMAC  on  cervical  mucus  were  also  observed.  NOMAC  2.5  mg  was  selected  as 
compared to lower tested dosages as better results / effects were observed on ovulation inhibition. The 
incidence  of  bleeding  and  /  or  spotting  was,  however,  higher  with  NOMAC  2.5mg.  Lastly,  the  anti-
gonadotropic  effect  measured  by  LH  and  E2  blood  levels  was  also  stronger  with  the  NOMAC  2.5  mg 
dose  Thus,  NOMAC  had  a  strong  progestational  and  anti-estrogenic  effect  on  the  uterus  and 
significantly reduced the proliferation that occurs with estradiol alone. 
Effects  of  17-beta  estradiol.  The  estrogen  contained  in  the  combination  tablet  is  E2.  This  estrogen  is 
identified  to  the  endogenous  estragon  E2  and  therefore  is  classified  as  a  «natural»  estrogen.  The 
applicant  investigated  whether  the  addition  of  1.5mg  E2  to  NOMAC  offers  additional  PD  effects, 
especially  antigonadotropic  effects.  Compared  to  NOMAC  alone,  the  addition  of  1.5  mg  E2  leads  to 
higher  E2  plasma  levels,  reinforces  the  LH  inhibition  and  also  decreases  FSH  levels  (elevated  with 
NOMAC alone). Inhibition of ovulation is the major pharmacodynamic action of interest. NOMAC had an 
anti-gonadotropic  activity,  which  resulted  in  an  inhibition  of  spontaneous  ovulation  in  humans.  This 
effect  seems  to  be  dose  dependent.  An  ovulation  inhibition  effect  was  observed  with  a  2.5mg  NOMAC 
dose  when  combined  with  a  1.5  mg  E2  dose.  Thus,  NOMAC  2.5mg  seems  to  be  the  optimum 
combination dosage for ovulation inhibition. However, it remains unclear whether this estradiol dose is 
the  optimal/adequate  dose  for  contraception  and  bleeding  control. A  study  evaluating  the  combination 
of NOMAC 2.5 mg with different E2 doses (1mg, 1.5mg and 2mg) should have been considered.  
In animals the secondary pharmacological properties of NOMAC associated with E2 leads to an increase 
in  the  levels of  blood  glucose  and  insulin,  a  drop in  plasma  cholesterol  levels  (total  and  HDL)  and  an 
increase  in  plasma  triglycerides  and  glucose  clearance.  No  impact  on  glucose  tolerance  and  insulin 
sensitivity  was  seen  in  humans  during  a  6-month  trial  evaluating  the  effects  on  carbohydrate 
metabolism  compared  to  LNG-EE  (292004).  No  impact  of  NOMAC  associated  with  E2  on  coagulation 
has  been  detected  in  animals  and  humans.  NOMAC  shows  anti-androgenic  activity  but  not 
glucocorticoid  or  anti-glucocorticoid  activity  nor  mineralocorticoid  or  anti-mineralocorticoid  activity. 
Finally,  NOMAC  was  without  any  notable  activity  on  bone  parameters,  whether  given  as  single 
compound or in combination with E2.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence with the to-be-marketed formulation 
The bioequivalence between the to-be-marketed formulation TX127066 and subsequent manufacturing 
changes was identified as an issue during the assessment of the product. In study 29007 assessing the 
influence of the granulometry of NOMAC on the dissolution process of the tablet, six different batches 
were  used:  CB105  (coarse  particles),  CB106  (fine  particles),  CB107  (fine  particles),  CB108  (fine 
particles),  CB109  (micronized  particles)  and  CZ189  (coarse  particles).  This study  failed  to  establish  a 
relevant IVIVC-A level model.  
Missing  information  with  respect  to  the  effect  of  food  on  the  bioavailability  of  the  final  commercial 
formulation was also a concern identified by the CHMP. Moreover, the influence of reduced particle size 
of  NOMAC  regarding  the  bioavailability  of  the  tablet  when  administered  with  concomitant  food  was  a 
specific issue. 
It  was  demonstrated  that  NOMAC  particle  size  is  not  a  comprehensive  predictor  for  pharmacokinetic 
performance.  The  impact  of  the  particle  size  distribution  of  the  two  active  substances  on  the  content 
uniformity and dissolution was evaluated and appropriate specifications have been set.  
Regarding  the  bioequivalence  between  the  batches  used  in  clinical  trials  and  the  final  commercial 
batches,  the  Applicant  has  been  requested  to  state  how  many  participants  in  the  pivotal  efficacy 
studies 292001 (Europe) and 292002 (US) received tablets from batch CA057 and CZ189. If a relevant

number  of  patients  in  the  two  trials  received  tablets  from  batch  CA057,  it  could  be  considered  to 
calculate in this subgroup the PI for user failure and method failure in the population of women 18 to 
35  years  of  age  and  to  analyse  the  data  also  with  respect  to  bleeding  pattern  and  pattern  and 
frequency  of  adverse  events.  The  applicant  should  also  state  whether  and  how  many  participants  in 
other clinical trials received tablets from batch CA057. 
Since there is no accepted demonstration of predictive in vitro-in vivo correlation (cf. Study 292007), 
in  vitro  comparison  between  final  commercial  batch  CD078  and  previous  clinical  batches  are  not 
deemed  sufficient.  The  recommendation  of  no  restriction  regarding  drug  dosing  with  food  could  be 
challenged when considering the marked bio-inequivalence on Cmax between batch CD078 and batch 
CZ189  following  a  single  dose  at  fasting  state.  Regarding  the  influence  of  a  reduced  particle  size  of 
NOMAC  on  pharmacokinetic  parameters  when  administered  with  food,  no  further  clinical  or  in-vitro 
investigation  have  been  performed  by  the  Applicant.  Therefore,  as  requested  by  the  CHMP,  the 
Applicant  agrees  to  perform  as  a  Follow-Up  measure  an  in-vivo  study  to  study  the  effect  of 
concomitant food intake on bioavailability of NOMAC-E2, using both a commercial batch and the clinical 
batches (CA057 and CZ189). 
Lack of E2 dose selection study 
Regarding pharmacology the fact that no dose response has been performed for E2 was identified by 
the  CHMP  as  an  issue.  Indeed,  the  efficacy  of  1.5  mg/day  has  not  been  substantiated.  The  Applicant 
was asked to bring convincing arguments that 1.5mg E2 is well the optimal dose for the combination 
with  2.5mg  NOMAC.  Of  note,  whether  the  NOMAC  dose  has  been  investigated,  no  E2  dose  selection 
study has been performed; the E2 dose was selected only on the fact that this is the dose used in the 
already  HRT  preparation  Naemis.  It  remains  unclear  whether  this  estradiol  dose  in  combination  with 
NOMAC  is  the  optimal/adequate  dose  for  contraception  and  bleeding  control.  A  study  evaluating  the 
combination  of  NOMAC  2.5  mg  with  different  E2  doses  (1mg,  1.5mg  and  2mg)  should  have  been 
considered by the applicant.. 
This  issue  regarding  the  choice  of  a  1.5  mg/day  E2  dosage,  provides  adequate  estrogen  levels  for 
estrogen  replacement  therapy  and  prevention  of  osteoporosis  in  post-menopausal  women.  But  the 
target population of NOMAC-E2 is different, i.e. fertile women and the question whether 1.5 mg of E2 
could compensate the antiestrogenic effect of NOMAC in fertile women was identified as a concern by 
the  CHMP.  The  choice  of  the  1.5  mg  E2  dose  was  mainly  based  on  the  dose  used  for  HRT  in  post-
menopausal women.  In adult fertile women, the question whether 1.5 mg of E2 may compensate the 
anti-estrogenic  effect  of  NOMAC  remains  to  be  answered,  considering  the  strong  suppression  of 
endogenous  production.  Thus,  since  no  study  was  performed  to  optimize  the  dose  of  E2,  there  is  a 
theoretical inference where 1.5 mg exogenous E2 would generate circulating E2 levels close to what is 
observed  either  at  the  beginning  of  the  follicular  phase  or  the  end  of  the  luteal  phase.  However,  the 
lack of dose response study for E2 in adult fertile women could be acceptable, provided that the SmPC 
adequately  mentions 
the  bleeding  profile  of  NOMAC-E2  (i.e.  occurrence  of  breakthrough 
bleeding/spotting and absence of withdrawal bleeding) that reflects the estrogenic stimulation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
NOMAC-E2 (2,5 mg–1,5  mg) is able to inhibit ovulation. The inhibition appears consistent and seems 
to  be  reliable.  Additional  contraceptive  mechanisms  contribute  to  the  contraceptive  effect  namely 
changing  the  viscosity  of  cervical  mucus  and  thinning  the  endometrium.  The  first  mechanism  may 
hamper the penetration of sperm into the uterus cavity and the second one decreases the likelihood of 
implantation of the fertilized eggs. Ovulation after stopping NOMAC-E2 returns within at least 16 days 
after taking the last active tablet. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  selection  of  the  daily  dose  of  E2  (1,5  mg)  has  not  been  justified  neither  in 
this nor in the dose finding studies, the question can be raised whether this quantity of E2 given orally 
can compensate for the complex antiestrogenic effect of NOMAC when it is used for long-term periods, 
especially  in  adolescents.  There  are  no  PK/PD  or  clinical  data  available  on  this  segment  of  the  target 
population. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The  main  documentation  in  support  of  the  contraceptive  efficacy  includes  2  clinical  phase  III  studies 
(292001 and 292002) and 2 supportive studies (292003 and 292004). Studies 292001 and 292002 are 
considered  the  pivotal  studies  with  respect  to  the  contraceptive  effect  of  NOMAC/E2.  Studies  292003 
Page 28/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  292004  are  clinical  supportive  pharmacology  studies  as  contraceptive  efficacy  was  assessed  in 
these studies as secondary but not primary objective.

Methods 
The following major inclusion criteria had to be observed: sexually active women, at risk for pregnancy 
and  not  planning  to  use  condoms;  women  in  need  for  contraception  and  willing  to  use  an  oral 
contraceptive for 12 months (13 cycles); at least 18 but not older than 50 years of age at the time of 
screening;  body  mass  index  ≥  17  and  ≤  35  kg/m²;  good  physical  and  mental  health;  willing  to  give 
informed consent in writing. 
In  general,  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  representative  of  the  standard  population  used  for 
evaluation of contraception in healthy women of childbearing potential. However, some women in the 
class  age  45-50  could  have  completed  the  menopause  transition  and  thus  were  not  at  risk  of 
pregnancy. Otherwise, women with hypothalamic amenorrhoea due to a low body weight (17.1 kg/m² 
<  BMI  <  18.9  kg/m²)  have  a  low  probability  of  spontaneous  ovulation.  These  two  populations  of 
women were not excluded from these trials.  
Study Participants  
Healthy  female  volunteers  aged  between  18  and  50  years,  requesting  contraception,  without 
contraindications for combined OC use were screened. A total of 3233 subjects participated in the two 
pivotal  clinical  trials  (292001  and  292002)  providing  32781  cycles  or  2522  women  years.  The 
combined exposure to NOMAC-E2 for the restricted ITT group 18-35 years (main analysis population) 
was 2351 subjects generating 16396 cycles which is equivalent to 1261 women years. 
Treatments 
Subjects  received  either  a  COC  containing  2.5  mg  NOMAC  and  1.5  mg  E2  or  a  COC  containing  3mg 
DRSP  and  30µg  EE.  From  day  1  up  to  and  including  day  28  one  tablet  was  taken  orally  at 
approximately the same time every day. This was done for 13 consecutive 28-day cycles.  
In  PD  studies,  NOMAC-E2  sufficiently  inhibited  ovulation.  The  comparator  DRSP-EE  (3mg/30µg)  was 
chosen by the applicant as it has already been approved in numerous countries and is used worldwide. 
Similar mechanism of action (PD properties on ovulation inhibition) compared to NOMAC/E2.  
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  contraceptive  efficacy,  vaginal  bleeding  patterns  (cycle  control), 
general safety and acceptability of the NOMAC-E2 COC in a large group of women aged 18-50 years. 
The  secondary  objectives  of  these  studies  were  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  NOMAC-E2  COC  on 
satisfaction and health related quality of life, libido, acne, menstrual symptoms, and body weight and 
to explore the aforementioned characteristics of the NOMAC-E2 COC in comparison with the DRSP-EE 
COC.  As  optional  pharmacogenetic  component  the  study  objectives  included  collection  and  store  of 
blood samples for further anonymized pharmacogenetic assessment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary and secondary efficacy parameters and safety parameters are in line with what is required in 
the CHMP Note for Guidance on the clinical investigation for hormonal contraception. Four parameters 
were taken into account in the assessment of the efficacy of NOMAC-E2: 
1.- Contraceptive efficacy (Primary efficacy parameter) 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  this  trial  was  the  Pearl  Index  i.e.,  the  number  of  in-treatment 
pregnancies  per  100  woman  years  of  exposure  for  the  restricted  ITT  Analysis  Set  (excluding  cycles 
expected  not  to  be  at  risk  for  pregnancy)  in  the  age  class  of  ≤  35  years.  Two  definitions  for  in 
treatment  pregnancies  were  used  to  analyze  contraceptive  efficacy,  in  order  to  comply  with  requests 
from regulatory authorities: 
 
In-treatment pregnancies were pregnancies with an estimated date of conception from the day 
of first intake of trial medication up to and including the day of last (active or placebo) intake 
of trial medication extended with a maximum of 2 days => definition used in Europe. 
Page 35/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In-treatment pregnancies were pregnancies with an estimated date of conception from the day 
of first intake of trial medication up to and including the day of last (active or placebo) intake 
of trial medication extended with a period of 14 days => definition used in the USA. 
Secondary efficacy analyses were performed for the upper age class (> 35 years) and for the overall 
age  class.  Additional  analyses  were  performed  for  the  ITT  group  and  PP  group  for  both  age  classes 
separately and overall. 
Differences  between  the  treatment  groups  were  explored  for  the  ITT,  restricted  ITT  and  PP  analysis 
(and separately per age class) using an exact 95% CI for the ratio of the two Pearl Indices based on 
the Poisson distribution with associated exact test for equality of the two Pearl Indices. For all subjects 
in the ITT group, a time to pregnancy analysis was performed secondary to the Pearl Index analysis. 
This analysis was also performed for each age class separately. 
2.- Vaginal bleeding pattern (secondary efficacy parameters) 
Women  daily  recorded  bleeding  (including  bleeding  intensity)  throughout  the  treatment  phase  using 
electronic  diaries.  Electronic  diaries  were  used  for  daily  recording  of  vaginal  bleeding  events.  Each 
subject  was  asked  to  record  on  a  daily  basis  whether  vaginal  bleeding  was  present,  and  if  vaginal 
bleeding was present, indicate whether it was considered spotting, or bleeding. The subject was asked 
to document her vaginal bleeding up to and including one week after stopping treatment. 
3.- Cycle analysis 
Primary  vaginal  bleeding  pattern  included:  occurrence  of  breakthrough  bleeding/spotting;  absence  of 
withdrawal bleeding. 
Secondary vaginal bleeding parameters included: Occurrence of breakthrough bleeding; Occurrence of 
breakthrough  spotting;  Occurrence  of  early  withdrawal  bleeding;  Occurrence  of  continued  withdrawal 
bleeding;  Number  of  breakthrough  bleeding/spotting  days;  Number  of  withdrawal  bleeding/spotting 
days. 
4.- Cumulative amenorrhoea 
Cumulative amenorrhoea is summarized as the percentage of women who were amenorrheic in a given 
cycle  and  remained  so  throughout  the  end  of  the  trial  (Cycle  13).  Amenorrhoea  was  defined  as  the 
absence  of  bleeding  and/or  spotting  within  a  cycle,  which  is  in  line  with  the  definition  used  in  the 
reference period analysis. 
Sample size 
These  two  trials  were  designed  to  obtain  a  sufficient  number  of  evaluable  cycles  of  exposure  to  the 
NOMAC-E2 COC in fertile women to fulfill the Committee for medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
criterion on the precision of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the Pearl Index estimate with a 
power  of  at  least  80%.  Each  trial was  designed  to contribute  half  of  the  required  exposure.  In  Study 
292001,  a  total  of  1591  subjects  were  randomised  and  treated  with  NOMAC-E2  for  a  period  of  13 
cycles whereas there were 1666 subjects included in Study 292002. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed with an allocation ratio of 3:1 (NOMAC-E2: DRSP-EE) and was stratified 
by  age  class  (up  to  35  years,  more  than  35  years).  For  statistical  analysis  Pearl  Index  (CV),  Kaplan 
Meier estimates, CV (including Log-rank and Wilcoxon test) were used. 
The  clinical  trial  population  at  baseline  were  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment  groups  in  all 
clinical trials. 
Blinding (masking) 
These  two  clinical  trials  were  conducted  in  an  open-label  fashion,  as  the  differences  in  regimen 
between NOMAC-E2 and DRSP-EE (24/4 versus 21/7) would lead to obvious differences in the timing 
of withdrawal bleeding. Even if an open design has already been previously used in the development of 
other OCs.

Statistical methods 
The  statistical  methods  include  Pearl  Index  and  confidence  interval  (Poisson  distribution);  confidence 
interval (Poisson distribution) for the ratio of Pearl Indices with associated exact test for equality; time-
to-pregnancy  analysis  with  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  and  confidence  intervals  (including  Log-rank  and 
Wilcoxon  test);  Cycle  analysis  incidence  rates:  confidence  intervals  (binomial  method)  per  group  and 
confidence intervals (normal approximation) for the difference between the groups; frequency tables, 
descriptive statistics; reference period analysis: frequency tables, descriptive statistics. 
Other analyses related to efficacy:  
Patient reported outcome questionnaires (summary scores) by two-way analysis of variance methods; 
comparison  of  acne  rating  scales  by  Wilcoxon-type  test  stratified  by  age  class  and  baseline  values; 
frequency tables, and descriptive statistics. 
Results 
Recruitment 
For  the  clinical  trial  292001  the  study  duration  was  13  consecutive  28-day  cycles  for  each  subject, 
(May  2006  until  April  2008).  The  clinical  trial  292002  had  the  same  study  duration  as  Trial  292001 
(from June 2006 until July 2008). 
Conduct of the study 
Two amendments were adopted for studies 292001 and 292002.  
Amendment  1  concerned  several  sections  of  the  protocol  such  as  exclusion  criteria,  assignment  to 
treatment,  concomitant  medications,  contraceptive  efficacy,  post-treatment  evaluation,  secondary 
efficacy parameter. In particular, the definitions of pre- in and post treatment pregnancies used at the 
time  of  the  redaction  of  the  initial  protocol  were  different  from those  used  for  other  OCs.  In  order  to 
adequately  compare  the  Pearl  Index  with  other  OCs,  similar  definitions  were  used.  Results  are 
given/analysed with these modified definitions. Of note, amendment 1 was adopted in May 2006 at the 
beginning of patient enrollment in Study 292001 (after one month). This amendment was adopted in 
November 2006, 5 months after the beginning of Study 292002enrollment.  
Amendment 2 consisted in adding an optional pharmacogenetic assessment in both trials 292001 and 
292002  and  a  population  pharmacokinetic  assessment  in  trial  292002.  This  protocol  amendment  is 
considered  to  have  no  impact  on  already  included  subjects  and  on  efficacy  and  safety  results  of  the 
two trials. This pharmacogenetic assessment initially planned has not been performed. 
Baseline data 
An  analysis  of  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  (including  gynaecological  and  contraceptive 
history  and  socioeconomic  background)  revealed  that  subjects  were  mostly  comparable  between 
groups  in  each  trial  individually  (282001  and  292002).  Of  note,  no  statistical  test  was  performed  to 
compare results between groups which is usual for demographic characteristics.  
Baseline  characteristics  differ  between  Study  292001  and  292002  with  regards  to  race,  ethnicity, 
weight,  gynaecological  and  contraceptive  history  and  socioeconomic  background.  Women  included  in 
both studies belonged to the age class 18-50. No post-menarche adolescents of the age class 12-18, 
which  is  also  a  target  population  claimed  for  this  new  contraceptive  pill  have  been  included  in  both 
pivotal clinical studies. Population characteristics are also discussed in section Clinical Safety.  
Numbers analysed 
Table 5 shows the number of participants in each of the defined study population per treatment group 
and age class for the individual trials (Trials 292001, 292002, 292003, 292004) and the combined data 
of the two well-controlled trials (Trials 292001 and 292002) (Table 5). 
The data sets presented are as follows: 
All-Subjects-Randomized  (ASR),  All-Subjects-Treated  (AST),  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT),  restricted  ITT  and 
Per-Protocol (PP) (Table 5).

Outcomes and estimation 
Subject discontinuations 
In  each  trial,  discontinuations  due  to  AE/SAE  are  more  frequent  in  NOMAC-E2  groups  than  DRSP-EE 
groups.  In  the  NOMAC-E2  group,  the  most  frequent  reported  SOC  that  led  to  premature 
discontinuation  was  “psychiatric  disorders”  (5.9%),  followed  by  “reproductive  system  and  breast 
disorders”  (5.2%).  The  incidences  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  in  these  two  SOCs  are  lower  for 
DRSP-EE subjects (2.9% and 2.2%, respectively).  
When  comparing  trials  292001  and  292002,  the  total  number  of  subjects  who  discontinued 
prematurely  from  treatment  was  higher  in  Study  292002  compared  to  study  292001  (28.2%  of  the 
NOMAC-E2 subjects versus 23.4% of the DRSP-EE subjects for Study 292001; 41.1% of the NOMAC-
E2 subjects  versus 38.3% of the DRSP-EE subjects for Study 292002). These percentages are rather 
high although lower than the discontinuation rates planned/assumed in the sample size calculations. 
This discrepancy is due to a higher percentage of “withdrawal of informed consent” and “lost to follow 
up”  in  trial  292002  as  compared  to  trial  292001.  It  seems  that  women  in  trial  292002  were  less 
compliant than women in trial 292001. This is confirmed by the exclusion from the ITT group in Study 
292002 of 27 subjects due to the limited credibility of their electronic data while only 2 subjects were 
excluded in trial 292001. 
Contraceptive efficacy 
The table 6 below presents the efficacy analysis, i.e., the estimated Pearl Index (and 95% CI) for both

In the clinical trial performed with NOMAC-E2 in the European Union the following Pearl Indices for the 
age class 18-35 years were calculated: 
Method failure: 0.40 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 1.03) 
Method and user failure: 0.38 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 0.97) 
In the clinical trial performed with NOMAC-E2 in the United States the following Pearl Indices for the 
age class 18-35 years were calculated: 
Method failure: 1.22 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 2.18) 
Method and user failure: 1.16 (upper limit 95 % confidence interval 2.08) 
In the controlled comparative studies, NOMAC-E2 shows less withdrawal bleeding than the comparator 
and is in general of less intensity. Cumulative amenorrhea was observed in 25.7% of women at cycle 
13 compared to 1 % for the comparator. The “occurrence of the absence of withdrawal bleeding” was 
statistically  significantly  higher  with  NOMAC-E2  compared  to  DRSP-EE  for  all  cycles  and  tended  to 
increase over cycles while it was not the case in the DRSP-EE group. 
Regarding intracyclic bleeding, breakthrough bleeding and spotting decreased over time in the NOMAC-
E2  group  and  breakthrough  spotting  occurred  more  frequently  than  breakthrough  bleeding  in  both 
treatment groups. However, the number of breakthrough bleeding/spotting days was similar between 
the two treatment groups. Lastly, the number of withdrawal bleeding/spotting days was slightly lower 
in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  as  compared  to  the  DRSP-EE  group.  Overall,  the  total  number  of  days  with 
bleeding/spotting is less with NOMAC-E2.  
For the NOMAC-E2 group, the incidence of cumulative amenorrhoea increased steadily over time, from 
2.0%  in  Cycle  1  (i.e.,  amenorrheic  from  Cycle  1  through  Cycle  13)  up  to  9.0%  in  Cycle  9  (i.e., 
amenorrheic  from  Cycle  9  through  Cycle  13)  and  25.7%  in  Cycle  13.  For  the  DRSP-EE  group,  the 
incidence  of  cumulative  amenorrhoea  was  low  ≤1.0%).  The  occurrences  of  the  absence  of  withdrawal 
bleeding  were  statistically  significantly  higher  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  as  compared  to  the  DRSP-EE 
group for all cycles.

Ancillary analyses 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No  special  population  studies  have  been  conducted.  Patients  with  renal  insufficiency,  hepatic 
dysfunction and adrenal insufficiency were excluded from trials 292001 and 292002 due to the known 
antimineralocorticoid  activity  of  the  comparator  Drospirenone  (in  accordance  with  the  SmPC/Package 
insert of DRSP-EE). Therefore the information in these groups is limited.  
NOMAC-E2  is  contra  indicated  in  patients  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  or  acute  renal  failure  like 
drospirenone-containing products. For patients with hepatic insufficiency, the statement in section 4.3 
“presence  or  history  of  severe  hepatic  disease  as  long  as  liver  function  values  have  not  returned  to 
normal” is considered appropriate. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy  results  of  both  trials  292001  and  292002  have  been  combined  and  presented.  The  extent  of 
heterogeneity has not been determined with a statistical test.   
Supportive study(ies) 
Study  292003.  This  was  a  randomized,  open  label,  comparative,  six-cycle,  single  center  trial  to 
evaluate  the  effects  on  ovarian  function  of  NOMAC-E2  (2.5mg  NOMAC  /  1.5mg  E2;  24/4  regimen)  in 
comparison to DRSP-EE (3mg DRSP / 20µg EE; 21/7 regimen) in healthy female volunteers aged 18 to 
35 years. A total of 48 subjects were randomized, 32 subjects in the NOMAC-E2 group and 16 subjects 
in  the  DRSP-EE  group.  In  trial  292003  the  subjects  were  allocated  randomly  in  2:1  to  either  the 
NOMAC-E2 or DRSP-EL 
Study  292004.  This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  comparative,  six-cycle,  multi-center  trial  to 
evaluate  the  effects  on  haemostasis,  lipid  and  carbohydrate  metabolism  and  on  adrenal  and  thyroid 
function of NOMAC-E2 (24/4 regimen) in comparison to 150µg Levonorgestrel – 30µg ethinylestradiol 
(21/7  regimen)  in  healthy  female volunteers  aged 18  to  50  years.  The  duration  of  treatment  was  six 
cycles of 28 days. 
A total of 121 subjects were randomized, 60 subjects in the NOMAC-E2 group and 61 subjects in the 
LNG-EE group. The primary objective of this trial was to assess secondary pharmacological properties 
(effects on haemostasis, lipid, carbohydrate metabolism and adrenal and thyroid function) of NOMAC-
E2. As contraceptive efficacy was only a secondary objective, this trial is considered supportive for the 
evaluation  of  the  contraceptive  effect  of  NOMAC-E2.  In  trial  292004  the  allocation  ratio  was  1:1 
(randomly to NOMAC-E2 or to LNG-EE). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The following considerations have been evaluated during the assessment: 
Pearl Index calculation 
Several issues regarding the calculation of the Pearl Indexes were raised during the procedure, among 
them, the MAH was requested to further justify the difference of Pearl Index between the EU and the 
US  studies  particular,  recalculate  the  Overall  Pearl  Index  excluding  only  cycles  where  condoms  were 
used;  provide  justification  for  pooling  Pearl  Indexes  from  both  clinical  studies  and  finally  to  calculate 
Pearl Indexes for method failure. Values of Overall Pearl Indexes for NOMAC-E2 in the European study 
were in the range of PI that were already accepted for other OCs, i.e. below 1 (0.378 for age group 18-
35 years and 0.309 for age group 18-50 years). In the US Study, overall Pearl Indexes were however 
much  higher,  above  1.  All  Overall  Pearl  Indexes  for  NOMAC-E2  fulfill  the  criteria  of  the  NfG,  as  the 
difference  between  the  estimated  PI  and  the  upper  limit  of  the  CI  does  not  exceed  1.  Baseline 
characteristics  differ  between  Study  292001  and  292002  with  regards  to  race,  ethnicity,  weight, 
gynaecological and contraceptive history and socioeconomic background. The impact of the differences 
in baseline in demographics and baseline characteristics on estimated Pearl Index between both clinical 
studies 292001 and 292002 has been addressed by the CHMP during the assessment of the procedure. 
In  the  NOMAC-E2  project,  compliance to  trial  medication intake  was  primarily  based  on  the  response 
values entered by the subjects in the electronic diaries on a daily basis. The Drug Accountability (DACC) 
Page 40/52
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
form was only an additional limited source of information for the determination of compliance. On the 
DACC  form,  the  number  of  strips  dispensed  and  returned  was  recorded  at  each  visit.  Strips  were 
handed out for 3 or 4 cycles to the women. The women returned to the clinic after three or four cycles 
of use and the total number of tablets returned over this period (three or four cycles) was recorded on 
the DACC form at each visit. Therefore, compliance can also be determined from the DACC form, but 
this is less specific as compared to the diary data and in general mostly not cycle specific. Therefore, 
the  DACC  form  was  only  used  to  determine  the  overall  subject  compliance  over  the  whole  treatment 
period.  
The  most  conservative  approach  for  the  Pearl  Index calculation  of  method  failures  has  been  used  for 
the  exclusion  of  pregnancies  from  the  numerator  and  the  inclusion  of  exposure  in  the  denominator. 
This  approach  may  lead  to  a  potential  overestimation  of  pregnancies  in  the  numerator  and  an 
underestimation of exposure in the denominator and thus results in the most conservative estimation 
of the Pearl Index for method failure. Regarding the determination of the number of pregnancies due 
to method failure, it was investigated whether the date of conception fell into a period that the subject 
was  non-compliant  to  tablet  intake.  As  explained  above,  non-compliance  was  based  on  the  response 
values  entered  by  the  women  in  the  electronic  diary.  Non-compliance  to  tablet  intake  during  the 
scheduled active cycle period (days 1-24 for NOMAC-E2 and days 1-21 for DRSP-EE) was defined as 4 
or more days with forgotten tablets, or two or more consecutive days with forgotten tablets. According 
to the protocol, in case the date of conception fell into a non-compliant cycle based on the data from 
the  diary  with  the  definition  as  described  above,  pregnancies  are  only  excluded  if  non-compliance  is 
confirmed  by  the  data  on  the  DACC  form.  If  no  tablets  were  returned  in  the  period  in  which  the 
estimated  date  of  conception  fell,  the  pregnancy  was  kept  in  the  numerator.  Since  the  data  of  the 
DACC form is less specific as compared to the diary data, the addition of this check on the DACC form 
is  a  very  conservative  approach.  By  using  this  very  conservative  approach,  several  in-treatment 
pregnancies  with  an  estimated  date  of  conception  that  fell  into  a  period  that  the  subject  was  non-
compliant according to the diary, were still included in the calculation of Pearl Index for method failure 
because the noncompliance could not be confirmed by the data on the DACC form. 
The  denominator  of  the  method  failure  Pearl  Index,  non-compliance  was  only  based  on  the  response 
values entered by the women in the electronic diary. The additional check on the DACC form was not 
performed  for  the  denominator.  In  fact,  excluding  cycles  (already  known  as  non-compliant  based  on 
the  diary  data)  only  if  this  was  confirmed  by  the  DACC  form,  would  lead  to  a  substantial  number  of 
cycles  for  which  non-compliance  could  not  be  confirmed.  (It  is  also  known  for  clinical  trials  that  the 
number  of  returned  tablets  is  usually  underestimated.)  This  would  lead  to  a  bias  towards  higher 
exposure and thus an underestimation of the Pearl Index for method failure. 
The methodology used for method failure can be considered to be the most conservative approach, i.e. 
increasing the Pearl Index estimation. In conclusion, this method tends to increase the numerator and 
to decrease the denominator, and therefore may only have increased the ratio. 
Vaginal bleeding pattern  
In  the  two  clinical  comparative  studies,  NOMAC-E2  shows  less  “withdrawal  bleeding”  than  the 
comparator with in general less intensity. Cumulative amenorrhea was observed in 25.7% of women at 
cycle 13 compared to 1 % for the comparator. The “occurrence of the absence of withdrawal bleeding” 
was statistically significantly higher with NOMAC-E2 compared to DRSP-EE for all cycles and tended to 
increase over cycles while it was not the case in the DRSP-EE group.  
Regarding intracyclic bleeding, breakthrough bleeding and spotting decreased over time in the NOMAC-
E2  group  and  breakthrough  spotting  occurred  more  frequently  than  breakthrough  bleeding  in  both 
treatment groups. However, the number of breakthrough bleeding/spotting days was similar between 
the two treatment groups. Lastly, the number of withdrawal bleeding/spotting days was slightly lower 
in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  as  compared  to  the  DRSP-EE  group.  Overall,  the  total  number  of  days  with 
bleeding/spotting  is  less  with  NOMAC-E2  and  subjects  with  regular  withdrawal  bleedings  in  the  early 
cycles are likely to have also regular withdrawal bleedings in the later cycles, whereas the incidence of 
breakthrough  bleeding/spotting  tends  to  decrease  over  the  cycles.  As  requested  by  the  CHMP, 
additional  analyses  have  been  performed 
the  occurrence  of  breakthrough 
to 
bleeding/spotting  and  absence  of  withdrawal  bleeding  (primary  vaginal  bleeding  parameters  in  cycle 
analysis) in the subgroup of women with a regular withdrawal bleeding. In total, 1055 subjects (56.8%) 
did have a regular withdrawal bleeding, i.e. withdrawal bleeding in Cycles 2, 3 and 4. 
investigate 
For  the  subgroup  of  women  with  a  regular  withdrawal  bleeding  during  Cycles  2,  3  and  4,  the 
occurrence  of  breakthrough  bleeding/spotting  in  Cycles  5  to  13  was  very  similar  to  the  remainder 
population,  decreasing  over  Cycles  5  to  13  from  19.0%  to  14.0%  in  this  subgroup  versus  21.4%  to

15.7% in the remainder group. For the subgroup of women with a regular withdrawal bleeding during 
Cycles  2,  3  and  4,  the  occurrence  of  absence  of  withdrawal  bleeding  in  Cycles  5  to  12  was  lower  as 
compared to the remainder population increasing from 7.6% to 14.6% in this subgroup versus 51.2% 
to 61.9% in the remainder group.  
The high occurrence of absence of withdrawal bleeding indicates that the estrogenic stimulation is less 
than  that  of  other  COCs,  e.g.  LNG-EE  product  (in  Study  292005,  the  occurrence  of  absence  of 
withdrawal  bleeding  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  NOMAC-E2  group  compared  to  LNG-EE 
group for all cycles).  
In conclusion, this phenomenon clearly shows the dominance of the gestagenic effect of NOMAC-E2 in 
a  high  percentage  of  the  users.  Indeed,  the  bioavailability  of  E2  is  only  about  1%  from  NOMAC-E2. 
Therefore, for the NOMAC-E2 users whose endometrium is adequately stimulated with E2, no (or less) 
breakthrough  bleeding/spotting  occurred  and  they  had  regular  withdrawal  bleeding.  However  for  the 
remainder group the absence of withdrawal bleeding in cycles 5 to 12 were 51.2 % to 61.9 %. 
Clinicians  should  be  aware  of  the  bleeding  profile  with  NOMAC-E2  as  this  should  be  taken  into 
consideration when choosing an OC.  
Return to ovulation 
Return  of  ovulation  was  considered  as  an  important  secondary  efficacy  parameter  to  be  assessed  for 
OCs.  Overall,  return  to  ovulation  was  considered  adequate:  detected  in  the  first  cycle  after  the  last 
tablet intake in 78.6% (22/28) of NOMAC-E2 subjects and 75.0% (12/16) of DRSP-EE subjects. 
In conclusion applicant has appropriately addressed efficacy issues of NOMAC-E2 in the clinical part of 
dossier. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  NOMAC-E2  (in  daily  dose  of  2.5mg  NOMAC  +  1.5mg  E2)  in  respect  of  ovulation 
inhibition has been shown in the two pivotal studies. The exposure of the patients and also taking into 
account  the  exposure  of  cycles  and  woman  years  is  acceptable  for  calculating  the  Pearl  Index.  For 
NOMAC-E2  the  values  are  0.38  (EU)  and  1.16  (USA)  and  higher  for  DRSP-EE  1.16  (EU)  and  1.89 
(USA).. Breakthrough bleeding and spotting occurred more frequently in NOMAC-E2 group in the first 
cycles of the treatment but the incidence of these events slowly decreased in time. Less frequent and 
less  intense  withdrawal  bleeding  occurred  in  this  group  and  finally  a  significant  proportion  of  the 
subjects  had  permanent  amenorrhea.    Amenorrhea  developed  only  in  0.1%  of  the  participant  in  the 
DRSP-EE group.  
In conclusion it can be established that the contraceptive effect (ovulation inhibition) of NOMAC-E2 is 
at least equal to that of DRSP-EE, but the bleeding pattern and cycle control of NOMAC-E2 product is 
different. No clinical efficacy and safety data are available in adolescents under 18 years of age. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Data related to safety of NOMAC-E2 have been collected from 8 clinical trials in which NOMAC-E2 was 
used and administered in a 24/4 regimen. The trials were as follows: 292001, 292002, (13 cycle trials), 
292003, 292004 (6 cycle trials) and 02-ESC/NOM-1RD and 2RD (3 cycle trials). The data from these 6 
trials  were  pooled  for  a  main  integrated  analysis  for  general  safety.  Two  pivotal  phase  III  trials 
contribute about 95 % of the total number of NOMAC-E2 treated subjects which were included in the 
integrated safety data analysis. General safety was assessed as reported as adverse events or serious 
adverse  events  and  also  using  the  data  of  routine  laboratory  parameters  and  vital  signs.  In  addition 
specific  safety  data  were  collected  which  were  related  to  the  uterine  cervix  (cervical  mucus), 
endometrium  (wall  thickness  and  biopsy  results),  cardiac  safety  (effects  on  QTc),  haemostasis,  lipid 
and  carbohydrate metabolism, androgens, SHBG, adrenal and thyroid function and data on folic acid 
plasma  level.  3434  subjects  were  exposed  to  NOMAC-E2  for  a  total  of  33838  cycles  (2602  women 
years).  1105  subjects  were  exposed  to  the  comparator  drug  DRSP-EE  (3  mg  –  30 g). Data  of  Trials 
292001,  292002  (13-cycle  trials),  292003,  292004  (6-cycle  trials),  02-ESC/NOM-1-RD  and  02-
ESC/NOM-2-RD (3-cycle trials) were pooled to provide the integrated safety data set (ISDS).

Table 7 
Adverse events  
Clinical  safety  of  NOMAC-E2  was  adequately  documented.  The  adverse  events  reported  are  known  to 
be associated with the use of oestrogens and progestogens. However, the incidence of adverse events 
is higher with NOMAC-E2 than in the comparator group DRSP-EE, with special higher incidence of acne, 
weight  increase,  lack  of  withdrawal  bleeding,  breakthrough  bleeding/spotting  and  psychiatric  AEs.  In 
particular,  new  cases  of  acne  and  worsening  of  acne  developed  more  frequently  in  the  NOMAC-E2 
subjects that could preclude an extensive use in adolescents or young adults. 
Evaluation  of  endometrial  effects  in  general  showed  a  pattern  known  for  COCs.  Histopathology  of 
endometrial  biopsies  does  not  indicate  an  untoward  effect  of  NOMAC-E2  on  the  endometrium.  Other 
side  effects  such  as  breast  cancer,  cervical  dysplasia  should  be  followed  throughout  the 
Pharmacovigilance  surveillance  and  the  RMPs  as  they  are  considered  as  class  effect.  Adequate 
information as for other OCs has been proposed to be included in the SPC. 
”The  mean  exposure  to  NOMAC-E2  and  DRSP-EE  was  slightly  higher  in  Trial  292001  as  compared  to 
Trial 292002 which could be explained by a lower premature discontinuation rate in Trial 292001. The 
percentage of subjects with an AE was slightly higher in the NOMAC-E2 group (75.3%) as compared to 
DRSP-EE  (69.0%).  See  table  8  for  details.  Two  subjects  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  died  (0.1%),  both 
deaths  were  unrelated  to  trial  medication,  none  of  the  subjects  died  in  any  of  the  other  treatment 
groups. The percentage of subjects that experienced an SAE was low in the NOMAC-E2 group (1.8%) 
and  the  DRSP-EE  group  (1.4%).  The  overall  incidence  of  subjects  who  discontinued  NOMAC-E2 
treatment  due  to  an  AE  (17.1%)  was  higher  as  compared  to  the  incidence  in  the  DRSP-EE  group 
(10.1%). The percentage of subjects who reported an AE related to trial medication was higher in the 
NOMAC-E2 group (49.1%) as compared to the DRSP-EE group (37.3%). In total 387 subjects (11.3%) 
in the NOMAC-E2 group reported at least one AE with a severe intensity, and 112 subjects (10.1%) in 
the DRSP-EE group. 
Most frequently reported AEs 
In the NOMAC-E2 group, four AEs were reported with an incidence higher than or equal to 10% (acne, 
weight increased, headache and withdrawal bleeding irregular). Two other AEs were reported with an 
incidence between 5 and 10% in the NOMAC-E2 group (vs. DRSP-EE), i.e., ‘nasopharyngitis’ (6.7% vs. 
7.2%), and ‘cervical dysplasia’ (5.5% vs. 6.6%).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Carbohydrate metabolism.  
NOMAC-E2 did not induce changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (trial 292004). 
Adrenal and thyroid function. 
Trial  292004  (NOMAC-E2  slightly  increased  the  plasma  total  cortisol,  cortisol  binding  globulin  and 
thyroxine  binding  globulin)  but  the  extent  of  the  increase  was  less  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  as 
compared to LNG-EE group. 
Androgens 
Trial 292003 and trial 292004. The following androgen parameters were evaluated: free testosterone, 
total  testosterone,  DHT  (dihydrotestosterone),  androstenedione,  and  dehydroepiandrosterone.  The 
level of all androgens decreased from baseline in mean values at cycle 6 and it was somewhat smaller 
in the NOMAC-E2 group as compared to the DRSP-EE and LNG-EE groups. 
SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding globulin). 
SHBG was increased in all three treatment groups (288% median increase from baseline in DRSP-EE, 
44%  in  NOMAC-E2  and  22%  in  LNG-EE  group).  No  relevant  changes  were  found  in  folic  acid  level 
during NOMAC-E2 treatment. In summary NOMAC-E2 significantly reduced the plasma level of various 
androgenic  hormones  measured  in  the  clinical  trials,  but  less  than  with  DRSP-EE  and  LNG-EE,  and 
induced small increase in SHBG.  
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
The incidence of abnormal vital signs was low. NOMAC-E2 was associated with an increase in the body 
weight  from  baseline  to  the  last  measurement  with  median  changes  of  1kg  and  DRSP-EE  0.2kg.  The 
relative increase of least 7% in body weight was observed for 15.8%  of the subjects in the NOMAC-E2 
group  and  11.0%  of  the  subjects  in  the  DRSP-EE  group.  A  trend  for  body  weight  gain  was  observed 
over one year of treatment. 
Cervical smears 
Cervical  smears  were  taken  in  trials  292001  and  292002.  Clinically  relevant  shifts  could  be  detected 
from normal cervical smear result at screening to an abnormal cervical smear result, which considered 
to be mild, moderate or severe dysplasia. 
Page 44/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Measurement  was  observed  in  106  subjects,  4.6%  in  NOMAC-E2  group  and  37  subjects  (4.8%)  in 
DRSP-EE  group.  Severe  dysplasia  was  found  only  for  two  subjects,  1  subject  (1%)  0.1%  in  the 
NOMAC-E2 group and also 1 subject in DRSP-EE group (0.1%). It should be noted that a background 
incidence  for  cervical  dysplasia  was  found  to  be  6.1%  in  this  trial  population.  Dysplasia  was  an 
exclusion criterion. It means that all subjects had a normal cervical smear at the start of the treatment.  
Cervical smears were taken only in two clinical trials (292001 and 292002) at the screening and at the 
end of the cycle 13.  
Results of the cervical smear assessment are presented by assessment at baseline, after cycle 13 and 
last measurement during the in-treatment period along with the corresponding shifts. Here it should be 
mentioned that dysplasia was an exclusion criterion or these subjects were excluded later from the trial. 
Clinically relevant shift to mild dysplasia were observed for 95 subjects (4.1%) in the NOMAC-E2 group 
and  31  subjects  (4.0%)  in  the  DRSP-EE  group.  Clinically  relevant  shifts  to  moderate  dysplasia  was 
observed for 9 subjects (0.4%) in the NOMAC-E2 group and 5 subjects (0.6%) in the DRSP-EE group 
and  shift  to  severe  dysplasia  was  found  for  two  subjects  (0.1%)  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  and  one 
subject  (0.1%)  in  DRSP-EE  group.  The  incidence  of  cervical  dysplasia  as  an  adverse  event  was 
reported  for  NOMAC-E2  and  DRSP-EE  groups  as  5.8%  and  6.7%  respectively.  According  to  the 
Applicant  the  cervical  dysplasia  was  evenly  reported  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  Applicant 
mentioned  some  confounding  factors  which  might  have  impact  on  the  cervical  smear  findings  and 
concluded  that  the  incidence  of  cervical  dysplasia  does  not  give  reason  for  concern  in  view  of  the 
background  incidence  in  this  population  and  regression  to  mean  phenomenon  was  induced  by  the 
exclusion of the cervical dysplasia at screening. 
Effects on endometrium 
107  subjects  participated  in  the  endometrial  biopsy  substudy  (85  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  and  22  in 
DRSP-EE group) but only 42 subjects provided both baseline and cycle 13 samples. The majority of the 
endometrial samples were classified as secretory at baseline of which 12 were classified as other, 5 as 
secretory  and  2  as  normally  proliferative  at  the  cycle  13  assessment.  13  samples  were  classified  as 
other  both  at  baseline  and  cycle  13.  2  samples  were  classified  as  normal  proliferative  at  baseline  of 
which 1 was classified as normally proliferative and 1 as other at cycle 13. The results of the cycle 13 
biopsies  were  classified  as  other  in  31  out  of  42  samples.  11  samples  were  reported  normally 
proliferative  or  secretory  at  the  cycle  13  assessment.  Histopatology  of  endometrial  biopsies  and 
ultrasound measurements of the endometrial thickness did not indicate an untoward effect of NOMAC-
E2 on the endometrium.  
into  account 
Bone mineral density 
When considering the impact the NOMAC-E2 prolonged use on the bone mineral density, it should be 
that  nomegestrol  acetate  has  definite  progesterone-receptor  mediated 
taken 
antiestrogenic  effect.  This  consists  of  different  factors  –  suppressing  the  FSH  secretion,  suppressing 
the  follicular  sensitivity  to  FSH  stimulation  and  a  consequence–  decrease  estrogenic  endogenous 
estradiol production and nomegestrol acetate may also decrease the number of estrogenic receptors in 
the  target  organs.  The  issue  to  which  extent  can  the  exogenous  estradiol  compensate  for  the  loss  of 
endogenous  E2  production  was  discussed  by  the  CHMP  during  the  assessment  of  this  procedure.  No 
clinically relevant effect on bone mineral density and no statistically significant difference in the effect 
on  bone  mineral  density  between  NOMAC-E2  and  the  LNG-EE  was  observed  in  women  aged  21-35 
years  and  treated  for  26  cycles  (study  292005).  These  results  cannot  be  referred  directly  to 
adolescents. 
QTc elevations 
Trial 292011 showed that therapeutic doses of NOMAC-E2 are not associated with QTc prolongation. It 
was randomised, double blind treatment with moxifloxacine as a reference product to demonstrate the 
sensitivity of the trial. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Data related to use of NOMAC-E2 during pregnancy are limited but they are indicating that there are 
no  adverse  effects  of  NOMAC-E2  on  the  foetus  or  neonate.  NOMAC-E2  is  not  recommended  during 
lactation  because  it  may  reduce  the  quantity  and  the  composition  of  breast  milk.  Small  amounts  of 
contraceptive steroids can be excreted with milk. 
Overdose 
There are no reports on serious effects of overdose.

Vital signs, physical findings 
Vital signs (body weight, diastolic and systolic blood pressure) were determined throughout the clinical 
trials. The percentage of participants who have abnormal systolic or diastolic blood pressure was small 
in both groups (less than 2.4% for increases and decreases).  
A small increase in body weight from baseline to last measurement could be observed in both NOMAC-
E2 (1kg) and DRSP-EE group (0.2kg). A relative increase (at least 7% in body weight) was estimated 
during  the  treatment  period  for  16%  of  the  subjects  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  and  for  11%  of  the 
subjects in DRSP-EE group.  
Physical gynaecological breast examinations 
In the well-controlled trials 292001 and 292002 and in the clinical pharmacology and PK trials did not 
find clinically relevant alterations. 
Acne 
Shift  analyses  on  acne  severity  performed  at  baseline  and  at  each  visit  suggests  an  overall  neutral 
effect on acne. Doctors were obliged to report a worsening or new occurrence of acne as an AE. 
Safety in special populations 
Paediatric population 
In  order  to  further  support  the  expectation  that  pharmacokinetic  data  will  be  similar,  a  single  dose 
pharmacokinetic  trial  with  NOMAC-E2 in  post-menarcheal  adolescents  and  adults was  performed.  The 
pharmacokinetics  of  nomegestrol  acetate  (primary  objective)  after  single  oral  dosing  of  Zoely  in 
healthy postmenarcheal female adolescents and adult subjects were similar. However after single oral 
dosing,  for  estradiol  component  (secondary  objective),  the  exposure  was  36%  lower  in  adolescents 
versus  adult  subjects.  The  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  is  unknown  in  the  absence  of  repeated 
dose  data.  Bone  mineral  density  is  a  major  problem  in  young  female,  especially  in  adolescent  girls 
aged 12 to 14 or 15 years old. 
Age 18-50 Subjects 
The  incidence  of  ‘acne’  was  higher  in  subjects  of  the  younger  and  middle  age  subgroups  (n=280 
[20.0%],  and  n=269  [18.1%]),  respectively)  as  compared  to  the  subjects  in  the  older  age  subgroup 
(n=71 [12.9%]). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Association between age and lipid and haemostasis parameters 
In  study  292004  the  very  low  correlation  coefficients  and  the  spurious  significant  findings  did  not 
suggest  any  relevant  associations  of  neither  lipid  nor  haemostasis  parameter  changes  within  the 
NOMAC-E2  group  with  factor  age.  However  this  study  is  too  short  (only  6  Cycles)  to  give  definitive 
conclusion.  
Association between adverse events and body weight/BMI 
The results showed that the incidences of ‘acne’ (16.3 to 19.6%), ‘weight increased’  (10.0 to 13.6%), 
and  ‘withdrawal  bleeding  irregular‘  (9.3  to  13.6%)  tended  to  increase  slightly  with  body  weight 
category. 
Association between adverse experiences and race 
The results indicated that the incidences of ‘acne’, ‘weight increase’ and ‘withdrawal bleeding irregular’ 
were  higher  in  Asian  subjects  as  compared  to  white  and  Black/African  Americans.  The  incidences  of 
‘headache’  and  ‘nasopharyngitis’  were  less  frequently  reported  by  Black/African  Americans  as 
compared to white and Asian subjects. The median extent of exposure of subjects categorized as Asian, 
white and ‘Other’ was similar (13.0 cycles), but the median exposure of Black/African Americans was 
markedly less (5.5 cycles).The number of Asian subjects is low. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the 3434 NOMAC-E2 treated subjects and 1105 DRSP-EE treated subjects, 1143 subjects (33.3%) 
and  336  subjects  (30.4%),  respectively,  discontinued  treatment  prematurely.  The  percentage  of 
subjects  who  discontinued  treatment  prematurely  was  higher  in  Trial  292002  (40.7%  in  NOMAC-E2 
group and 37.9% in DRSP-EE group) as compared to Trial 292001 (28.2% in the NOMAC-E2 group and 
23.4% in the DRSP-EE group). 
Page 46/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  percentage  of  premature  discontinuations  due  to  (S)AE  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  (17.1%)  was 
higher as compared to the DRSP-EE group (10.1%). The percentage of premature discontinuations due 
to ‘unacceptable vaginal bleeding’ in the NOMAC-E2 group was 3.7 % and 1.3 % in the DRSP-EE group. 
(127 subjects in the NOMAC-E2 and 14 subjects in the DRSP-EE group of studies 292001 and 292002). 
‘Unacceptable vaginal bleeding’ is not a preferred term. 
Discontinuation by SOC and PT 
Psychiatric disorders was the most frequent reported SOC in the NOMAC-E2 group in which AEs were 
reported that resulted in premature discontinuation was. A total of 5.9% of the subjects reported AEs 
in this SOC as a reason for discontinuation from NOMAC-E2. 
In the SOC ‘Psychiatric disorders’, the most frequent reported AEs leading to discontinuation (NOMAC-
E2  vs.  DRSP-EE,  all  causalities)  were  ‘libido  decreased’  (2.0%  vs.  1.0%),  ‘mood  altered’  (0.8%  vs. 
0.4%), ‘depression’ (0.8% vs. 0.4%), ‘depressed mood’ (0.7% vs. 0.2%), and ‘loss of libido’ (0.7% vs. 
0.1%).  
Reproductive  system  and  breast  disorder  was  the  second  most  frequent  reported  SOC  in  which  AEs 
were  reported  that  resulted  in  premature  discontinuation  for  the  NOMAC-E2  group  was.  In  total  178 
subjects (5.2%) reported AEs in this SOC as a reason for discontinuation. 
In  SOC  ‘Reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders’,  the  most  frequent  reported  AEs  (NOMAC-E2  vs. 
DRSP-EE,  all  causalities)  were  ‘metrorrhagia’  (1.4%  vs.  0.8%),  and  ‘withdrawal  bleeding  irregular’ 
(1.3% vs. 0%). 
Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (3.0%  vs.  0.7%)  In  the  SOC  ‘Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue 
disorders’ the most frequent reported AE (NOMAC-E2 vs. DRSP-EE) was ‘acne’ (2.5% vs. 0.2%) 
Nervous system disorders’ (1.9% vs. 2.1%) In the SOC ‘Nervous system disorders’ the most frequent 
reported AE (NOMAC-E2 vs. DRSP-EE) was ‘headache’ (1.0% vs. 1.2%). 
Investigations’ (1.9% vs. 1.1%) In the SOC ‘Investigations’ the most frequent reported AE (NOMAC-E2 
vs. DRSP-EE) was ‘weight increased’ (1.6% vs. 0.9%). 
Post marketing experience 
Available postmarketing data for NOMAC-E2 is not applicable to the indication prevention of pregnancy. 
NOMAC alone (5 mg tablets; Lutenyl®) has been studied for use in menstrual disorders. 
NOMAC-E2 (3.75 mg-1.5 mg tablets; Naemis®) has been studied for hormone replacement therapy in 
post-menopausal women and has been marketed in Europe since 2003.  
In  conclusion  population  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  is  different.  The  safety  profile  defined  in  these 
populations  is  not  exactly  the  same.  However  it  is  possible  to  have  a  synthetic  approach  and  it  is 
possible  to  define  for  NOMAC-E2  a  safety  profile.  In  many  specific  points  (more  frequently  AEs 
reported,  discontinuations)  the  safety  profile  is  less  favourable  than  the  safety  profile  of  comparator 
drug.  This  fact  is  being  reflected  in  SmPC  and  also  be  included  in  RMP.  In  contrast  biological 
parameters suggest interesting pharmacological properties. However the small number of patients and 
the duration of exposure are too limited to adequately quantify the risk of rare events such as venous 
thromboembolism in particular. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  adverse  event  profile  of  NOMAC/E2  appears  worse  compared  with  the  comparator  used  in  Phase 
III trials with more discontinuations due to AEs and higher frequencies of several AEs e.g. acne, weight 
increase, lack of withdrawal bleeding, irregular bleeding and also psychiatric AEs. Furthermore, signs of 
adverse liver effects have been noted both in nonclinical repeated dose toxicity and in clinical studies 
(requiring hospitalization in a number of cases).  
Based  on  the  provided  data,  acne,  weight  gain,  lack  of  withdrawal  bleeding,  irregular  bleeding  and 
psychiatric AEs cannot be considered as emergent safety concerns for this new contraceptive pill even 
if  higher  rates  were  observed  compared  to  DRSP-EE.  However,  the  safety  profile  of  NOMAC-E2  is 
adequately  reflected  in  sections  of  the  SmPC  (sections  4.8.  and  5.1).  The  differences  observed 
between  NOMAC-E2  and  comparative  pill  containing  DRSP-EE  for  acne,  weight  gain,  and  bleeding 
profile have been added in section 5.1.

Regarding Liver function, nonclinical data do not contain any signals that NOMAC-E2 may be associated 
with drug-induced liver injury. Bridging repeated dose toxicity studies have shown toxic effects which 
were consistent with the amplification of the hormonal activity which is predominantly estrogenic. No 
additional  pre-clinical  studies  were  necessary.  In  addition,  cholelithiasis  with  or  without  cholecystis, 
considered  as  a  class  effect,  is  mentioned  in  section  4.4.;  it  has  also  been  included  in  section  4.8. 
(Undesirable effects). 
Bone Mineral Density (BMD) constitutes a specific point of interest in younger subjects, in the age class 
12-17 years. The results of Trial 292005 were submitted by the applicant during the assessment of the 
procedure.  The  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  compare  the  effects  of  NOMAC-E2  on  BMD  with 
the  effects  of  a  monophasic  COC  containing  LNG-EE.  NOMAC-E2  (2/5  mg/1.5  mg)  had  no  clinically 
relevant effect on bone mineral density and there was no statistically significant difference in the effect 
on bone mineral density between NOMAC-E2 and the LNG-EE in women aged 21-35 years and treated 
for 26 cycles. However, the population of women aged 21-35 years cannot be compared to the post-
menarcheal adolescent. Indeed, for women aged 21-35 years the peak bone mass is already reached 
and the bone turnover is limited. Therefore, it is not surprising to find no differences in BMD between 
NOMAC-E2  users  and  LNG-EE  users.  On  the  contrary,  in  adolescents,  the  peak  bone  mass  is  not 
reached and bone turnover is maximum. Moreover, based on the data from literature, the association 
between the  use of hormonal contraception and bone mineral density is still controversial. Therefore, 
the  question  remains  open  whether  NOMAC-E2  prevents  or  not  young  women  from  obtaining  peak 
bone mass and whether to reach peak bone mass is related to increase risk of osteoporosis later in life. 
This  issue  will  be  closely  monitored  by  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities.    It  is  acknowledged  that 
the collection of bone mineral density will not be possible within a PASS study given the observational 
nature of this study.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
It can be established that the participants generally tolerated well the daily use of NOMAC-E2. 
Its AE profile is similar to that of DRSP with some exception. Higher incidences were observed in acne, 
“weight increased” and “abnormal withdrawal bleeding” and in the incidence of hepatobiliary disorders 
in NOMAC group as compared to DRSP-EE. 
The  incidence  of  AE-s  in  %,  and  also  the  frequency  of  premature  discontinuation  due  to  primarily  to 
AE-s  was  higher  in  NOMAC-E2  groups  than  in  the  DRSP-EE  groups.  It  can  probably  explained  by  the 
higher  incidence  of  acne,  libido  decrease,  with  increased  abnormal  withdrawal  bleeding  and  
amenorrhea. metrorrhagia. The number of SAE was small in both the NOMAC-E2 and in the DRSP-EE 
groups. 
No  DVT  occurred  in  the  NOMAC-E2  group  and  only  one  case  in  the  DRSP-EE  group.  However,  all 
women considered to be at risk of thromboembolic events were excluded from the trials. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant  show  that  the  package  meets  the  criteria  for  readability  as  set  out  in  the  Guideline  on  the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
The  readability  test  of  the  package  leaflet  of  nomegestrol  acetate  and  estradiol  (2.5  mg/1.5mg) 
consisted  of  two  parts;  the  first  test  round  consisted  of  ten  face-to-face  interviews.  Based  on  the 
results  gathered,  a  small  number  of  amendments  were  made  to  the  leaflet.  Subsequently,  another 
series  of  ten  face-to-face  interviews was  carried  out  (second  test  round).  In  total,  16  questions  were 
used to assess the readability of the leaflet: 15 questions relating to traceability and comprehensibility 
and one additional question assessing traceability and applicability. Taking into account the results, the 
leaflet  was  written  in  a  way  that  most  potential  users  were  able  to  trace,  comprehend  and  apply  the 
information given in the resulting leaflet.  
2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
The  contraceptive  effect  of  new  contraceptive  pill  NOMAC-E2  can  be  considered  demonstrated  in  an 
adult population. Sufficient inhibition of ovulation has been shown with NOMAC-E2, as documented in a 
sufficient number of volunteers. Effects on other efficacy parameters such as endometrial, cervix and 
vaginal  epithelium,  and  antigonadotropic  effect  have  also  been  adequately  addressed.  Two  open, 
randomised, comparative, long term Phase III clinical studies (Study 292001 performed in Europe and 
Study  292002  performed  in  the  USA)  have  been  conducted  to  support  the  evaluation  of  the 
contraceptive  effect  of  NOMAC-E2  in  adults.  Values  of  Overall  Pearl  Indexes  for  NOMAC-E2  in  the 
European study were in the range of PI that were already accepted for other oral contraceptives, i.e. 
below  1  (0.378  for  age  group  18-35  years  and  0.309  for  age  group  18-50  years).  In  the  US  Study, 
Overall Pearl Indexes were however significantly higher, above 1.  
Page 50/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP was of the opinion that Pearl Indexes obtained in the EU 292001 study and in the US study 
292002 is mentioned separately in the SmPC.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Uncertainties on Pearl Index for method Failure 
The  values  of  overall  Pearl  Indexes  for  NOMAC-E2  in  the  European  study  were  in  the  range  below  1 
(0.378  for  age  group  18-35  years  and  0.309  for  age  group  18-50  years)  however  in  the  US  Study, 
overall  Pearl  Indexes  were  above  1.  The  Applicant  clarified  why  non-compliance  to  tablet  intake  was 
based on days with diary entry ‘tablet not taken’ and not on the Drug Accountability form. Indeed, the 
same method for determination of non-compliance should have been used at the numerator and at the 
denominator.  
Uncertainties of the use of NOMAC-E2 in the age class 12-18 years 
A single dose PK study was submitted to sustain the use of NOMAC-E2 in this age class, as requested 
by the PDCO. However, in this study, lower E2 levels were observed in the adolescent population aged 
14-17  years  compared  to  an  adult  population.  The  estradiol  level  is  an  important  parameter  to  be 
considered in  adolescents,  as  many  physiological  processes  depend  on  proper  estrogens  supply 
(development of bones, sexual organs, sexual appearance). Therefore, no extrapolation of efficacy and 
safety results as found in the phase III clinical program for adults can be made to the post-menarcheal 
adolescent  population.  Thus,  an  extension  of  use  in  this  age  class  cannot  be  endorsed  by  the  CHMP. 
Uncertainties  have  been  included  in  Section  4.4:  it  is  unknown  whether  the  amount  of  estradiol  in 
NOMAC-E2  is  sufficient  to  maintain  adequate  levels  of  estradiol  in  adolescents,  especially  for  bone 
mass  accrual  (with  cross  reference  to  section  5.2).  The  age  range  is  not  be  included  in  the  claimed 
indication. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC reflect the available data in adolescents. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  NOMAC-E2  was  sufficiently  documented.  Both  phase  III  studies  included  a 
sufficient  number  of  women  with  sufficient  duration  of  exposure.  No  unexpected  adverse  events 
emerged with the use of NOMAC-E2. The adverse events reported are known to be associated with the 
use  of  oestrogens  and  progestagens.  However,  higher  incidence  of  some  side  effects  such  as  acne, 
weight increase, lack of withdrawal bleeding, breakthrough bleeding/spotting and psychiatric AEs were 
observed  with  NOMC-E2  compared  to  DRSP-EE.  These  adverse  events  have  been  adequately 
addressed in the Product information (SmPC and PIL). In addition, the side effects will be adequately 
followed up in the RMP, either throughout routine pharmacovigilance or specific follow up in the PASS 
study. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Bone Mineral Density 
Based on the data from literature, the association between the use of hormonal contraception and BMD 
is  still  controversial.  Results  of  clinical  Trial  292005  show  that  NOMAC-E2  (2/5  mg/1.5  mg)  had  no 
clinically  relevant  effect  on  BMD  and  there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  effect  on 
BMD between NOMAC-E2 and the LNG-EE in women aged  21-35 years and treated for  26 cycles. For 
NOMAC-E2, the PK study failed to demonstrate similar AUC 0-tlast for estradiol in adolescents versus 
adults. The  estradiol  level  is  an  important  parameter  to  be  considered in  adolescents,  as  many 
physiological  processes  depend  on  proper  estrogens  supply.  In  particular,  it  is  still  controversial  how 
combined contraceptive pills influence the bone mass accrual.  
As  for  all  OCs,  uncertainties  remain  of  the  effect  of  NOMAC-E2  on  bone  formation  in  the  youngest 
population (adolescents). Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been modified to reflect this uncertainty.  This 
issue is part of the important missing information “safety in post-menarcheal adolescents” and will be 
monitored by routine pharmacovigilance.  
  Uncertainties regarding additional claimed Pharmacodynamic properties 
The  PD  properties  concerning  hepatic  effects,  and  lower  impact  on  SHBG  levels  and  haemostasis 
parameters due to the use of 17ß-estradiol instead of ethinylestradiol have been identified as issues. A 
Page 51/52
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
planned large comparative post-marketing safety surveillance study that will be conducted to assess the 
VTE risk of NOMAC-E2 compared to other COCs in a non-selected target population is the only way to 
reliably assess the impact of 17ß-estradiol instead of ethinylestradiol on VTE risk. This is addressed as a 
specific measure in the Risk Management Plan. 
Benefit-risk balance 
NOMAC  is  a  highly  selective  progestin  derived  from  the  naturally  occurring  steroid  hormone, 
progesterone.  E2  is  identical  to  the  endogenous  human  E2  and  is  therefore  classified  as  a  natural 
estrogen.  Based  on  the  data,  there  are  no  unresolved  safety  issues;  missing  information  will  be 
addressed by post marketing studies. Clarifications regarding pearl index calculations diagnostic value 
have been adequately addressed by the applicant and overall safety reports including the EU-RMP and 
Pharmacovigilance systems have been updated. The benefit-risk balance is favourable for NOMAC-E2.  
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In  summary  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Zoely  for  the  claimed  indication  is  considered  positive. 
Questions  remain  regarding  its  safety  in  adolescent  population,  but  these  issues  are  addressed  by 
appropriate  labelling.  For  all  identified  and  potential  risks  a  Post-authorisation  Registry  study  is 
requested. The aim of this PASS is to better characterise and compare the risk of (short and long term) 
use of NOMAC-E2 with marketed combined oral contraceptives. 
2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion  that  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were 
needed  to  investigate  further  some  of  the  safety  concerns,  but  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation 
activities were required beyond those included in the product information.  
2.8.3.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CHMP is of the opinion that study, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan 
and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered significant. 
2.9.  Recommendation 
Normal opinion 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the risk-
benefit balance of Zoely in the following indication: 
“oral contraception” 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.  
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  of  studies  subject  to  the  agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

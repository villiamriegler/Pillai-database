1.  Information on the procedure 
Yondelis is an anti-cancer medicinal product with two indications:  
1. treatment of patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, after failure of anthracyclines and 
ifosfamide, or who are unsuited to receive these agents;  
2. in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), Yondelis is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. 
After the indication in ovarian cancer was authorised in the EU, trial OVC-3006 was started. It was a 
randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of trabectedin in 
combination with PLD in patients with advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer who had received two 
previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, compared to PLD alone and with overall survival (OS) 
as primary endpoint. 
Following a review of results of a second interim analysis for futility, the Independent data Monitoring 
Committee recommended discontinuation of the study due to lack of survival superiority in the 
trabectedin in combination with PLD arm over PLD alone arm. The study failed to achieve both the 
primary endpoint of OS and the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). 
On 21 February 2020 the European Commission therefore triggered a procedure under Article 20 of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and requested the CHMP to assess study 3006 and its impact on the 
benefit-risk balance of Yondelis and to issue a recommendation on whether the relevant marketing 
authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Yondelis (trabectedin) is a tris tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid originally isolated from the marine 
ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata. It exerts its action by binding to the N2 position of guanine in the 
minor groove of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), unlike other DNA-binding agents that bind to the major 
groove. In contrast to other DNA-binding cytotoxic agents, which are either equally or more effective 
in cells containing defects of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, 
trabectedin is more effective in cells with an intact NER pathway. Additionally, trabectedin has been 
proposed to have unique modulatory effects on the tumours microenvironment that has been 
attributed to its effect on tumour-associated macrophages and histiocytes. 
The marketing authorisation for Yondelis was first issued on 17 September 2007 for the soft tissue 
sarcoma indication. The ovarian cancer indication was authorised in 2009 based mainly on study OVA-
301, a randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
trabectedin in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in 645 patients with relapsed 
ovarian cancer. The trial showed superiority of trabectedin with PLD compared to PLD alone in terms of 
progression-free survival (PFS, primary endpoint): 21% risk reduction for disease progression 
(HR=0.79, CI: 0.65-0.96, p=0.02)-. Also, overall response rates were higher with trabectedin 
combined with PLD (27.6% vs. 18.8% with PLD alone). Results for overall survival were compatible 
with a risk reduction for death with a 95% CI 0.72-1.02, but without significance. On the basis of this 
study, the following indication was granted: “Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin (PLD) is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian 
cancer”. 
No additional studies on the ovarian cancer indication were requested of the MAH.

The full clinical study report for study 2012-004808-34 (OVC-3006), hereafter study 3006, was 
provided for assessment. 
2.2.1.  Data on efficacy 
Study 3006 
This was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+DOXIL as a third-line chemotherapy in subjects with advanced-
relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

-  Arm A: Day 1 of a 21-day cycle (DOXIL 30 mg/m2 administered over approximately 90 minutes 
[q3wk;  90-min],  followed  by  trabectedin  1.1  mg/m2  administered  over  approximately  3h 
[q3wk; 3-h], via central venous access) Subjects assigned to Arm A were pretreated with 20 mg 
of  dexamethasone  IV,  or  an  equivalent  IV  corticosteroid,  approximately  30  minutes  prior  to 
initiation  of  infusion  of  DOXIL  on  Day  1  of  each  treatment  cycle,  to  reduce  the  incidence  of 
transaminase elevations related to trabectedin 
-  Arm B: Day 1 of a 28-day cycle (DOXIL 50 mg/m2 over approximately 90 minutes per package 
insert [q4wk; 90-min]).  
Treatment was to be continued until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment 
toxicity, or until 2 cycles after assessment of a complete response (CR). 
• 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  OS  after  treatment  with  trabectedin+DOXIL  combination 
therapy to that observed after treatment with DOXIL monotherapy for subjects with advanced-relapsed 
epithelial  ovarian,  primary  peritoneal,  or  fallopian  tube  cancer  who  had  received  2  previous  lines  of 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate PFS. 
To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR). 
To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of trabectedin using a sparse sampling 
scheme in the trabectedin+DOXIL treatment group. 
To evaluate the safety of the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy and DOXIL monotherapy. 
Exploratory Objectives 
• 
• 
To conduct pharmacogenomic evaluations of OS, PFS and other endpoints in subjects with and 
without mutations in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. 
To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/470721/2020 
Page 6/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypothesis: Trabectedin in combination with DOXIL will improve OS compared with DOXIL 
monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial 
ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: OS 
The primary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time between randomization and death from any 
cause. Secondary endpoints were PFS (defined as the time between the date of randomization and the 
date of disease progression or death), and ORR (defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR 
or partial response [PR]). The analysis of the primary endpoint, OS, was to be conducted after at least 
514 events (deaths) were observed or up to the clinical cutoff date. 
Secondary endpoints: 
• 
PFS 
•  ORR 
• 
PK 
•  Safety 
Secondary efficacy endpoints of PFS and ORR were to be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in  Solid  Tumors  (RECIST,  Version  1.1).  Scheduled  assessments  of  disease  status  were  planned  to  be 
performed within 30 days before randomization, every 8 weeks (±5 days) after randomization for the 
first  4  assessments,  and  then  every  12  weeks  (±5  days)  thereafter.  Disease  assessments,  including 
assessments for subjects who discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression, were 
to  be  performed  until  disease  progression  was  radiographically  confirmed,  the  start  of  subsequent 
anticancer  therapy,  withdrawal  of  subject  consent,  or  the  clinical  cutoff  date  (18  January  2018).  For 
subjects who discontinued study treatment, documentation of all subsequent anticancer therapy, survival 
status, and safety evaluations as outlined in the Time and Events Schedule of the protocol (Appendix 1) 
was required. Survival status was recorded at least every 8 weeks for the first 2 years after the treatment 
termination visit and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter. Clearly defined primary and secondary 
outcome measures and, when applicable, any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements 
(e.g., multiple observations, training of assessors, central/independent reviews). 
• 
Sample size 
It was assumed that OS would follow an exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate. Assuming 
a median OS of 16 months for the active control group (DOXIL monotherapy), a planned sample size of 
approximately 670 subjects was expected to provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.78 (16 months vs. 
20.5 months, corresponding to a 28% improvement in median OS) at a 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 
and  an  enrollment duration  of  approximately  52  months  (13  subjects/month enrollment) over  a  total 
study  duration  of  64  months  to  obtain  the  required 514  events.  The  OS  endpoint  incorporated  group 
sequential  design  by  including  1  interim  analysis  and  1  final  analysis  using  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries as implemented by Lan-DeMets α-spending method.

• 
Randomisation 
At randomization, subjects were stratified by 4 criteria:  
1)  the time from the last dose of first-line platinum therapy to disease progression (6 months to 
12 months vs. >12 months to 24 months vs. >24 months),  
2)  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score (0 vs. 1),  
3)  BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation), and  
4)  prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes).  
Subjects were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy 
arm (Arm A) or to the DOXIL monotherapy arm (Arm B). 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.  
• 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Hypotheses for Trial Objectives 
Overall survival was compared between treatment arms using an unstratified one-sided log-rank test. 
The trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy was to be declared better than DOXIL monotherapy if the 
OS was better with a p-value less than or equal to the significance level as specified by the α-spending 
function. The overall 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 was to be spread over 1 interim efficacy and 1 
final OS analyses, when approximately 308 and 514 death events were to be seen. Operating 
characteristics for these boundaries are presented in the following table. 
Table 1 Study 3006 - Stopping Boundaries for Overall Survival (Study ET743-OVC-3006) 
Interim Futility Analysis 
A non-binding futility analysis for OS was implemented after observing 33% (170 events) of the total 
number of required 514 events per request by the IDMC. The study was to be considered futile if the 
estimated HR from the Cox proportional-hazard model was equal to or greater than 0.95. After the 
futility analysis at 33% of the total number of OS events, on 26 June 2017, the IDMC requested one 
more futility analysis at 45% (232 events) of the total number of required 514 death events. The study 
was to be considered futile if the estimated HR from Cox proportional-hazard model was equal to or 
greater than 0.93. The second futility analysis was conducted, and the results were reviewed by the 
IDMC on 15 December 2017, wherein the HR for OS was 0.962, crossing the previously agreed upon 
threshold for futility of 0.93. The IDMC recommended discontinuing the study due to (1) futility of the 
primary analysis on OS and (2) excessive risk based on imbalance of adverse events not in favour of 
Yondelis+PLD.

Page 8/49 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim Efficacy Analysis 
The interim efficacy analysis was planned for this study after observing 60% (308 events) of the total 
number of required (514) events. Following the review of the study data by the IDMC in the second 
futility analysis, the IDMC recommended discontinuing the study. The planned interim analysis was, 
therefore, not performed. 
Efficacy 
Primary Endpoint 
OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. Subjects who 
die, regardless of the cause of death, were to be considered to have had an event. Subjects who were 
still being treated, who were lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study, or who had withdrawn 
consent from the study were to be censored at the last available date where the subject was known to 
be alive.  
Overall survival was compared between both treatment arms by the unstratified, 2-sided, log-rank 
test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of functions of OS for each 
treatment arm. The number of events, subjects censored, the estimate of medians and 95% CI for the 
medians were to be presented. Six-month and 1-year survival rates were to be calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Unstratified log-rank test was to be used as the primary analysis for treatment 
comparison Unstratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to obtain the HR and 95% CI. 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint using the stratified log-rank test were to be performed.  
Secondary Endpoints 
Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
disease progression or death. Subjects who progressed or died were to be considered to have had an 
event, except if the event occurred after the start of subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer, in which 
case the subject was to be censored at the time of the last tumour assessment (prior to or on the first 
day of the first subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer). Subjects who did not progress or die (i.e., lost 
to follow-up, or receiving treatment without documented disease progression, or started subsequent 
therapy for ovarian cancer and still alive) were to be censored at the date of the last tumour 
assessment (prior to or on the first day of the first subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer). 
Progression-free survival was compared between both treatment arms using the unstratified log-rank 
test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution function of PFS for each 
treatment arm. The number of events, subjects censored, the estimate of medians and 95% CIs were 
to be presented. Six-month and 1-year progression-free rates were to be calculated using the Kaplan-
Meier product limit method. The unstratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to obtain the HR 
and it’s 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint using the stratified log-rank test were to 
be performed. 
The best overall response was to be summarized per treatment arm in a frequency table with 
categories: CR, PR, stable disease, progressive disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE). The response 
rate was evaluated using the Fisher’s exact test. 
In case an imbalance in baseline prognostic factors was observed for OS or PFS, especially PFI, a Cox 
proportional hazards model will also be used to compare the 2 treatment arms. The following baseline 
information was to include covariates: baseline ECOG (0 vs. 1), PFI (as continuous), BRCA 1/2 status 
(mutation vs. no mutation), prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes), and any imbalanced factors. From the 
Cox proportional hazards regression, HRs and 95% CIs were to be estimated for treatment and for the 
prognostic factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/470721/2020 
Page 9/49 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses were to be carried out to assess if the treatment effect was consistent across 
clinically relevant subgroups. The planned subgroup analysis included analysis by age (<65, ≥65), PFI 
(6 to 12 months vs. >12 to 24 months vs. >24 months), ECOG performance status score (0 vs. 1), 
BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation) and prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes). 
Symmetry Analysis of Tumour Assessment Schedules 
Tumour assessments were to be performed every 8 weeks. Timing of assessments in both treatment 
groups was to be presented side by side with boxplots. 
2.2.1.2.  Results  
• 
Participant flow  
576 subjects were randomized, 289 subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 287 subjects in the 
DOXIL arm. Eight subjects did not receive study drug (3 subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 5 
subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy arm) due to worsening of health status (5 subjects) or withdrawal 
of subject consent (3 subjects). The remaining 568 subjects received at least 1 dose of study 
medication (286 subjects received trabectedin+DOXIL and 282 received DOXIL alone (Table 2). 
Table 2 Subject Disposition; All Randomized Subjects (Study ET743-OVC-3006) 
Disease progression was the most common reason (46.5% of subjects) for the permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment regardless of treatment arm. Other reasons for the discontinuation 
of study treatment included AEs (17.4%), withdrawal of consent (15.3%), physician decision (5.8%), 
CR (2.8%), and death (1.2%). The incidence of discontinuation due to disease progression was lower 
in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm (39.2%) compared with the DOXIL monotherapy arm (53.9%). 
Incidences of discontinuation due to AEs and CRs were higher in the in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm 
(24.1% and 3.8%, respectively) than in the DOXIL monotherapy arm (10.6% and 1.8%, respectively) 
(Table 3). 
27 (9.4%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy arm and 35 (12.4%) subjects in the 
DOXIL monotherapy arm discontinued study treatment due to ‘Other’; the predominant reason was 
study termination.

• 
Conduct of the study 
Changes to Planned Analyses 
Patient reported outcome analysis were not performed due to the lack of efficacy per the futility. 
Changes in Conduct 
There were 6 amendments to the original protocol dated 19 December 2012. The following key changes 
were identified in each amendment: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  first  amendment  (25  March  2013)  clearly  identified  the  selected  subject  population. 
Specifically, progression of disease had to occur ≥9 months from the first dose in subjects treated 
with DOXIL-containing regimen as a second-line therapy. 
The second amendment (29 August 2013) extended the use of contraceptives from 3 months to 
6  months  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug,  changed  the  creatinine  clearance  rate  from  ≥40 
mL/min/1.73  m2  to  ≥60  mL/min/1.73  m2  as  a  part  of  subject  inclusion  criteria,  and  added  a 
prohibition regarding subjects receiving a yellow fever vaccine. 
The  third  amendment  (26  August  2015)  added  to  and  revised  study  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria  to  allow  greater  flexibility  in  demonstrating  eligibility  based  on  response  to  previous 
therapy. 
The  fourth  amendment  (17  December  2015)  enhanced  cardiac-safety  monitoring.  Additional 
LVEF evaluations were scheduled at pre-specified times throughout the treatment period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/470721/2020 
Page 11/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The fifth amendment (18 March 2016) was initiated to clarify the timing of LVEF assessments 
for subjects experiencing a significant decline in LVEF including assessments during the follow-
up period. 
The sixth amendment (09 January 2018) was initiated in response to an IDMC recommendation 
to discontinue the study based on the results of a futility analysis of OS, in which the pre-specified 
futility threshold was crossed. 
Note: Following Protocol Amendment 6, study data collection for adverse events (AEs) (except for serious 
adverse  events  [SAEs]),  laboratory  tests,  cardiovascular  monitoring,  vital  signs,  and  physical 
examinations were to cease when subjects on study treatment completed the treatment termination visit 
assessments  as  specified  in  the  Time  and  Events  Schedule  of  the  protocol    or  by  18  January  2018, 
whichever occurred first. For subjects who continued treatment with single-agent DOXIL, as per the local 
standard of care, only SAEs were reported to the sponsor.  
Protocol deviations 
Forty (13.8%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 22 (7.7%) subjects in the DOXIL 
monotherapy arm had a major protocol deviation. Twelve (2.1%) subjects were not withdrawn from 
study per protocol specified criteria and 7 (1.2%) subjects each did not meet protocol inclusion or 
exclusion criteria or received the wrong treatment (including the incorrect rate of infusion or the 
incorrect dose) (Table 4). Forty-four (7.6%) subjects had “Other” as the reported protocol deviation, 
and the deviations were largely related to endpoint assessments. 
Three (0.5%) subjects met criteria for protocol violations. In the trabectedin+DOXIL arm, 2 (0.7%) 
subjects had inclusion criteria violations (i.e., did not meet predefined protocol limits for screening 
hematologic or liver function test results) and 1 of these subjects also had an exclusion criterion 
violation (i.e., the subject received an excluded therapy within 3 weeks of the first study treatment). 
In the DOXIL arm, 1 (0.2%) subject had an inclusion criteria violation (i.e., informed consent was not 
signed prior to the optional pharmacogenomic blood sample collection) (Table 5).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis – Overall Survival 
Unstratified Analysis 
The unstratified final analysis of OS was conducted at the 18 January 2018 cut-off. At that time, there 
were 266 deaths in the study; 134 (46.4%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 132 (46.0%) 
subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy arm. The median OS for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm was 23.82 
months and 22.21 months for the DOXIL arm. 
The HR was 0.925 (95% CI: 0.727, 1.177; p=0.5236) (Table 9), indicating no significant difference in 
OS between treatment arms. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS is presented in Figure 2.

Table 10 presents an analysis of OS stratified by the time from the last dose of first-line platinum 
therapy to disease progression, ECOG performance status score, BRCA 1/2 mutation status, and prior 
DOXIL therapy (the pre-specified stratification factors). The stratification analysis is consistent with the 
unstratified analysis of OS.

therapy to first disease progression after first-line therapy, ECOG performance status score, BRCA 1/2 
mutation status, and prior DOXIL therapy (the pre-specified stratification factors). The stratification 
analysis is consistent with the unstratified analysis of PFS.

Symmetry of Tumour Assessments 
Tumour assessments for the first 4 evaluations were conducted every 8 weeks after randomization and 
then every 12 weeks until disease progression, the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal 
of subject consent, or the clinical cut-off date. Figure 14 shows the first 12 tumour assessments. The 
timing of assessments for both treatment groups was consistent with the schedule specified in the 
protocol.

Objective Response Rate 
The objective response rate (CR or PR as best responses) was 46.0% for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm 
and 35.9% for the DOXIL arm. The odds ratio was 1.523 (95% CI: 1.075; 2.158; p= 0.0142) 
favouring the trabectedin+DOXIL treatment arm (Table 13).

2.2.2.  Discussion on efficacy 
Study 3006 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study that compared the efficacy and 
safety of trabectedin+DOXIL in women with recurrent ovarian cancer after failure of second-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The study included women with advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian 
tube cancer, ECOG 0-1. The primary objective of the study was to compare the OS after treatment 
with trabectedin+doxorubicin vs doxorubicin monotherapy.  Secondary objectives were PFS, ORR, PK 
and safety.  
The study sponsor assumed that 670 patients would be needed to provide 80% power to show a HR = 
0.78 at alpha =5%. Patients were randomized 1:1 using four clinically meaningful stratification factors: 
1) the time from the last dose of first-line platinum therapy to disease progression (6 months to 12 
months vs. >12 months to 24 months vs. >24 months), 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status grade (0 vs. 1), 3) BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation), and 4) 
prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes).  
Overall, the baseline demographic and disease characteristics are well-balanced. The majority of the 
patients were white, relatively young women (<65 years), mean age of 60-61. The majority had 
papillary/serous histology, and locally advanced disease (pelvis and abdomen), and had prior surgery. 
About 27% of the patients had BRAC 1/2 mutated disease. Only a minority had received prior 
doxorubicin.    
It should be noted that study participants were required to be platinum sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) 
following their first platinum-containing regimen and have a complete or partial response to a second 
line platinum-based chemotherapy (without PFI restrictions), meaning that these patients could be 
either platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) or platinum-resistant (PFI < 6 months) following their 
second platinum-containing regimen. A post hoc analysis determined that 42% of enrolled subjects 
were platinum-resistant (PFI < 6 months) following their last platinum-containing regimen. 
The study sponsor conducted, at the request of the IDMC, one non-binding unplanned interim futility 
analyses for OS after 170 events corresponding to 33% of event. The IDMC requested an additional 
futility analysis at 45% of events. This analysis showed a HR=0.962, which crossed the pre-specified 
boundary for futility of 0.93. The study was subsequently discontinued. The stratified analysis of OS of 
all randomized patients showed a HR=0.942 (0.739, 1.202), p=0.9629. PFS showed a HR=0.934 
(0.760, 1.146), p=0.3545.  
The study had an exploratory endpoint; OS as function of BRCA 1/2 mutation. The results of this 
analysis showed that OS was statistically significantly prolonged, HR=0.542 (0.327, 0.901), p=0.0165. 
Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed that patients who had a platinum-free interval (PFI) of 6-
12 months from last dose of first-line therapy had a HR=0.69 (0.48, 1.01). However, considering that 
the study failed to achieve its primary endpoint and that these were exploratory endpoints not 
adjusted for multiplicity, no conclusions can be drawn from these findings.    
Overall the observed data cannot be used for testing the statistical hypothesis related to the 
hypothesis in the study protocol (i.e. Yondelis + PLD will improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy 
in the treatment of subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary 
peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy). 
Furthermore, the data are deemed to lack the strength and level of evidence that would have been 
obtained had the study been completed as planned.

EMA/470721/2020

In light of the above, data from Study 3006 do not permit to conclude on the effects of Yondelis + PLD 
in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.

Summaries of TEAEs and other safety data are based on 576 subjects (289 in the trabectedin+DOXIL

2.2.3.4.  Laboratory findings 
During the study, 194 (68.3%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 112 (39.9%) subjects in the 
DOXIL arm developed Grade 3-4 hematological laboratory values during the study. The most common 
Grade 3-4 hematological laboratory abnormalities were neutrophil count abnormalities and white blood 
cell  (WBC)  count  abnormalities.  Across  all  hematologic  parameters  (hemoglobin  levels,  neutrophil 
counts, platelet counts, and WBC counts) Grade 3-4 abnormalities occurred at higher incidences (>5% 
difference) in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm compared to the DOXIL monotherapy arm. 
More  subjects  in  the  trabectedin+DOXIL  arm  (169  subjects  [59.5%])  reported  with  a  Grade  3-4 
chemistry  laboratory  abnormality  compared  with  the  DOXIL  arm  (50  subjects  [17.8%]).  This  was 
primarily due to an increased number of subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm that were reported with 
Grade 3 laboratory values for ALT (45.1%) and AST (12.3%). Generally, there was a higher frequency 
grade shifts to Grade 3 or 4 in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm compared with the DOXIL arm. The most 
common laboratory tests demonstrating this were neutrophil count, platelet count, ALT, and AST.

2.2.4.  Discussion on safety  
The  combination  of  trabectidin+doxorubicin  is  already  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Thus, the safety profile of trabectedin is already well-known, 
but mainly based on patients in first relapse (study 301). The population studied in study 3006 have 2 
relapses and thus is more pre-treated.   
Common AEs were related to the GI tract (nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, 
liver  toxicity,  etc.),  general  disorders  (fatigue,  pyrexia,  asthenia,  etc.),  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorder  (neutropenia,  anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia,  etc.),  skin  reactions  (palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, alopecia, etc.), metabolism and nutrition disorder (decreased appetite), 
respiratory (dyspnoea, cough, oropharyngeal pain, etc), infections, hypertension. 
Approximately 85% of patients in the trabectedin+doxorubicin experienced a Grade 3-4 AE compared to 
63.8% in the control arm. The greatest difference is seen in terms of Grade 4 AEs, 44.1% vs. 10.3%. 
Looking at SOCs a clear difference is seen in “blood and lymphatic system disorder”, 56.6% vs 27.7%, 
and  “investigations”  (neutropenia,  leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  etc.)  51.7%  vs.  10.6%.  Other 
differences, however, to a lesser extent were also seen in terms of metabolism, respiratory, and vascular 
Grade 3-4 AEs in favour of the doxorubicin monotherapy arm. 
There were significantly fewer Grade 3-4 AEs in terms of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the 
trabectedin+doxorubicin  arm  compared  to  doxorubicin  alone,  3.8%  vs.  14.5%,  which  is  somewhat 
puzzling, because trabectedin is add-on to doxorubicin.  
With regards to deaths, there was a slight increase in “death within 60 days of initiation of study drug” 
in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm, 2.4% vs. 1.4%, and in “death within 30 days from the last dose”, 
3.5%  vs.  2.1%.  AEs  leading  to  death  was  10  (3.5%)  vs.  5  (1.8%)  in  favour  of  the  doxorubicin 
monotherapy arm.  
A doubling of SAEs is seen in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm, 41.3% vs 20.6%. A similar pattern as 
with Grade 3-4 AEs is also observed.  
Patients in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm discontinued to a higher degree compared with the control 
arm, 93 (32.5%) vs. 46 (16.3%). The main reason being “investigations” (ALT/AST increase, etc.) and 
“blood and lymphatic disorders” (anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia).  
As expected, dose-reductions had to be made in half of the patients in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm 
compared to one third in the control arm, 152 (53.1%) vs. 103 (36.5%). Main reason for dose-reductions 
Assessment report  
EMA/470721/2020 
Page 44/49 
 
 
 
 
 
were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ALT/AST increase, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, 
palmar-plantar erythordysaesthesia syndrome, etc.   
Overall, the safety profile appears worsened in the third line setting compared to the second line setting 
based on the observed differences between the combination arm and the control arm in terms of rates 
of SAEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, AEs leading to dose reductions and AEs leading to discontinuations. This is not 
unexpected  when  comparing  a  combination  treatment  with  monotherapy  in  more  heavily  pretreated 
patients.  Overall  the  safety  profile  of  the  combination  of  trabectedin  and  PLD  in  this  study  appears 
consistent with the already known safety profile for this combination. 
The CHMP noted and endorsed the PRAC request in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003001/201909 for the MAH to 
submit a variation to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with pooled data from the ovarian cancer phase 3 
clinical studies. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Yondelis + PLD) is indicated for the 
treatment of patient relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Study ET743-OVA-301 (Study 301), a 
randomised phase 3 study of 672 patients who received either trabectedin (1.1 mg/m2) and PLD 
(30 mg/m2) every 3 weeks or PLD (50 mg/m2) every 4 weeks, was the basis for this approval. In this 
study, patients had been previously treated for ovarian carcinoma (80% previously received taxanes) 
but had only 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and had experienced either recurrence or 
progression after more than 6 months from the beginning (first dose) of the platinum-based 
chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. The study included patients with platinum-resistant disease 
(platinum-free interval from the end of platinum treatment less than 6 months) and patients with 
platinum-sensitive disease (platinum-free interval from the end of platinum treatment ≥6 months) who 
were not expected to benefit from or who were ineligible for or who were not willing to receive 
retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was PFS and patients were 
stratified based on platinum sensitive vs. platinum resistant.  
Subsequently Janssen conducted study ET743-OVC-3006 (Study 3006). No EU scientific advice had 
been sought for study 3006. This study was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+PLD as a third-line chemotherapy in 
subjects with advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Study 
participants were required to be platinum sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) following their first platinum-
containing regimen and have a complete or partial response to a second line platinum-based 
chemotherapy (without PFI restrictions) meaning that these patients could be either platinum-sensitive 
(PFI ≥ 6 months) or platinum-resistant (PFI < 6 months) following their second platinum-containing 
regimen. Women were allocated randomly 1:1 to Yondelis + PLD or PLD alone with randomization 
stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), PFI following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (6 to 12 months, 
>12 to 24 months, >24 months), BRCA1/2 germline status (mutation vs. no mutation), and use of 
prior PLD (yes vs. no). The primary objective of the study was to compare OS after treatment with 
Yondelis + PLD vs. PLD monotherapy.  Secondary objectives were PFS, ORR, PK and safety. One non-
binding interim futility analysis for OS was conducted after 170 events corresponding to 33% of the 
pre-specified number of events required for the final analysis (514 events). Following the data review 
at this first interim analysis, the IDMC requested an additional futility analysis at 45% of events 
(232 events); this analysis was not planned in the protocol. It showed a HR=0.96 for OS, which 
crossed the boundary of 0.93 for futility of the study to show that Yondelis + PLD would improve OS 
compared with PLD monotherapy. The study was subsequently discontinued after the IDMC concluded 
to recommend discontinuation of the trial for 2 main reasons: a) futility of the primary analysis (OS) 
and b) excessive risk based on imbalance of AE not in favour of the experimental regimen arm.

The observed data cannot be used for testing the statistical hypothesis related to the hypothesis in the 
study protocol (i.e. Yondelis + PLD will improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy in the treatment 
of subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or 
fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy), and the 
observed data are deemed to lack the strength and level of evidence that would have been obtained 
had the study been completed as planned. 
Moreover, differences between the two trials (Study 301 and study 3006) hinder an appropriate 
comparison of populations and outcomes. The main difference is with regards to the number of prior 
lines of therapy. Study 301 included patients previously treated with one line of platinum-based 
chemotherapy, while study 3006 included patients failing a second-line platinum-containing 
chemotherapy). Furthermore, a post hoc analysis determined that 42% of subjects enrolled in study 
3006 were platinum-resistant (PFI < 6 months) following their last platinum-containing regimen while 
Yondelis is only approved in patients with platinum sensitive disease. 
With respect to outcomes for primary endpoints, Study 301 found a difference in terms of median PFS 
of 1.5 months with Yondelis+PLD, whereas Study 3006 was powered to detect a difference in median 
OS of 4.5 months.  
The MAH argued that post-hoc analyses of Study 3006 showed a trend towards improved PFS 
combined with a significant improvement in ORR among the subset of patients who were platinum-
sensitive following their last line of platinum-containing therapy. However, as discussed previously, the 
study failed to meet its primary objective, to evaluate Yondelis with the assumption that Yondelis + 
PLD will improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy. Only if study 3006 had been completed as 
planned and was positive for OS, the submitted ad hoc comparison of study 301 and 3006 (data not 
shown) might have been considered for the post-hoc defined subgroup of patients in Study 3006 with 
platinum-sensitive disease after their last line of platinum-containing therapy; however, limitations of 
comparisons across trials in different patient populations still would have been a high concern.  
Even though BRCA and PFI were stratification factors, OS and PFS as a function of BRCA status or of 
PFI were exploratory endpoints and were not adjusted for multiplicity. As a consequence of the 
methodological shortcomings, the results for these endpoints and in subgroups defined by these 
factors are much more likely to be spurious in magnitude and direction and cannot be used for 
regulatory decision-making.  
In light of the above, data from Study 3006 do not permit to conclude on the effects of Yondelis + PLD 
in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. 
With regards to safety, there was a difference between the two treatment arms in study 3006 in terms 
of number of AEs, severity and seriousness. Approximately 85% of patients in the Yondelis + PLD 
experienced a Grade 3-4 AE compared to 63.8% in the control arm. The greatest difference is seen in 
terms of Grade 4 AEs, 44.1% vs. 10.3%. Looking at SOCs a clear difference is seen in “blood and 
lymphatic system disorder”, 56.6% vs. 27.7%, and “investigations” (neutropenia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, etc.) 51.7% vs. 10.6%. However, there were significantly fewer Grade 3-4 AEs in 
terms of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the Yondelis + PLD arm compared to doxorubicin 
alone, 3.8% vs. 14.5%, which is somewhat puzzling, because trabectedin is given in study 3006 as 
add-on treatment to doxorubicin.  
There were slightly more deaths in the Yondelis + PLD arm with regards to “death within 60 days of 
initiation of study drug” in the Yondelis + PLD arm and in “death within 30 days from the last dose”. 
AEs leading to death was 10 (3.5%) vs. 5 (1.8%) in favour of the doxorubicin monotherapy arm.

Patients in the Yondelis + PLD arm discontinued treatment to a much higher degree compared with the 
control arm and as expected dose-reductions had to be made in half of the patients in the Yondelis + 
PLD arm compared to one third in the control arm.  
Overall, the number of SAEs was considerably higher (41.3% in the combination arm vs 20.6% in PLD 
arm) and a considerable difference in overall rate of Grade 3-4 AEs was observed (85% in the 
combination arm vs 63.8% in the control arm). This is not unexpected when comparing a combination 
treatment with monotherapy in patients who have already received several lines of treatment.  
The CHMP noted and endorsed the PRAC request in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003001/201909 for the MAH 
to submit a variation to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with pooled data from the ovarian cancer 
phase 3 clinical studies.   
Yondelis has been authorised in combination with PLD based on a positive trial rendering a favourable 
benefit-risk balance in patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (study 301). The new 
study 3006 failed to provide evidence against the statistical hypothesis that OS is the same with 
Yondelis + PLD and PLD. In addition, results of study 3006 also do not provide a level and strength of 
clinical evidence that would allow to conclude there are no clinically relevant favourable effects of 
Yondelis + PLD in terms of OS and PFS in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.  
The positive benefit-risk balance established for the ovarian cancer indication on the basis of the well-
conducted phase III trial 301, showing favourable effects of Yondelis + PLD in terms of PFS in patients 
with a relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, therefore remains unchanged.  
Furthermore, the CHMP recommended that the marketing authorisation of this product should be 
varied so that section 5.1 of the SmPC reflects the results from Study 3006.  
The CHMP noted from responses submitted by the marketing authorisation during this review that 
there are two ongoing investigator-sponsored studies (NCT03690739 and NCT03164980), in active 
recruitment phase, which are investigating the use of trabectedin + doxorubicin in patients with 
recurrent ovarian cancer. The MAH is requested to submit the final results of these studies when they 
become available. 
4.  Amendments to the product information 
The CHMP considered that amendments to section 5.1 of the SmPC were necessary to include a 
summary of the results from study 3006. The agreed amendments are as follows (new text in bold): 
The Yondelis+PLD combination in relapsed ovarian cancer also was evaluated in study 
ET743-OVC-3006, a phase 3 study in which women with ovarian cancer after failure of a 
second platinum-containing regimen were randomized to Yondelis (1.1 mg/m2) and PLD (30 
mg/m2) every 3 weeks or PLD (50 mg/m2) every 4 weeks. Study participants were required 
to be platinum sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) following their first platinum-containing regimen 
and have a complete or partial response to a second line platinum-based chemotherapy 
(without PFI restrictions) meaning that these patients could be either platinum-sensitive 
(PFI ≥ 6 months) or platinum-resistant (PFI < 6 months) following their second platinum-
containing regimen. A post hoc analysis determined that 42% of enrolled subjects were 
platinum-resistant (PFI < 6 months) following their last platinum-containing regimen. 
The primary endpoint of study ET743-OVC-3006 was OS and secondary endpoints included 
PFS and ORR. The study was sized to enrol approximately 670 patients in order to observe 
514 deaths to detect a HR of 0.78 for OS with 80% power given a two-sided significance 
level of 0.05 spread across two planned analyses on OS, at interim (60% or 308/514 
deaths) and final analysis (514 deaths). Two early unscheduled futility analyses were 
performed at the request of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Following 
the second futility analysis performed at 45% of planned events (232/514 deaths), the 
Assessment report

Page 47/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IDMC recommended discontinuing the study due to (1) futility of the primary analysis on OS 
and (2) excessive risk based on imbalance of adverse events not in favour of Yondelis+PLD. 
At early termination of the study, 9% (52/572 treated) of subjects stopped treatment, 45% 
(260/576 randomized) stopped follow-up, and 54% (310/576 randomized) were censored 
from OS assessment, precluding reliable estimates of PFS and OS endpoints. 
5.  Grounds for Opinion 
Whereas, 
• 
• 
• 
The Committee considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for 
Yondelis; 
The Committee reviewed the clinical study report on study ET743-OVC-3006, a phase 3, 
randomized, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
trabectedin in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as a third-line chemotherapy 
in patients with advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or Fallopian tube 
cancer. 
The Committee noted that following a first unplanned interim futility analysis, the Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for study 3006 requested an additional futility analysis at 
45% of events (232 events). This analysis, which was not planned in the protocol, led to an 
IDMC recommendation to discontinue the trial for futility of the primary endpoint (OS) and 
excessive risk based on imbalance of adverse events not in favour of the experimental arm, 
after which the sponsor prematurely terminated study 3006.  
• 
The Committee further noted that there are differences between study 3006 and study 301 
(pivotal study for the authorisation of the ovarian cancer indication) in terms of number of 
prior lines of therapy, platinum sensitivity status and primary endpoint hampering an 
appropriate comparison of populations and outcomes. These differences between studies 
hinder an appropriate comparison of populations and outcomes. 
•  Overall, the Committee considered that data from the prematurely terminated study 3006 do 
not provide the level and strength of clinical evidence necessary to conclude on the absence of 
favourable effects in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients. 
• 
• 
• 
The Committee noted that overall, in study 3006, the safety profile of Yondelis +PLD appears 
consistent with the known safety profile for this combination. While patients in the Yondelis + 
PLD arm of the study experienced more adverse events than those in the PLD arm, this is not 
unexpected when comparing a combination treatment with monotherapy.   
The Committee therefore concluded that the positive benefit-risk balance of Yondelis in the 
ovarian cancer indication, that was established on the basis of the well-conducted phase III 
trial 301 showing favourable effects of Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal 
doxorubicin in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed platinum-
sensitive ovarian cancer, remains unchanged. 
The Committee recommended that study 3006 be reflected in section 5.1 of the summary of 
product characteristics.  
In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of Yondelis remains 
favourable subject to the agreed amendments to the product information.

The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations for Yondelis.

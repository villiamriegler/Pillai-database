Furthermore, by finalisation of this category 1 study 
program, removal of the additional monitoring statement 
and the black triangle from the product information is 
warranted. Annex II of the product information should also 
be updated to remove this condition.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding the PASS

simultaneously be at higher risk of bleeding and

treatment should be weighed against risk for bleeding in 
patients with active cancer dependent on tumour location, 
antineoplastic therapy and stage of disease.  Tumours 
located in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract have 
been associated with an increased risk of bleeding during 
rivaroxaban therapy. In patients with malignant neoplasms 
at high risk of bleeding, the use of rivaroxaban is 
contraindicated. For more information, please refer to the

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC following the submission 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC following the 
submission of a prospective, single-arm, non-
interventional, open-label cohort study was 
conducted to investigate the safety and effectiveness 
in a real-world setting, XANTUS (SN 15914), for 
strengths 15 mg film-coated tablets, 20 mg film-
coated tablets.  
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC following the 
submission a prospective, non-interventional, open-
label cohort study was conducted in patient with 
acute DVT to investigate the safety and effectiveness 
in a real-world setting, XALIA (SN 15915), for 
strengths 15 mg film-coated tablets, 20 mg film-
coated tablets, and treatment initiation pack. 
In addition the EU-RMP is updated (version 9.1) to 
include information from the completed PASS 
observational studies XANTUS and XALIA. 
Additionally the final CSRs of X-TRA (SN 16320, 
phase IIIb) and VENTURE-AF (SN 15694, phase IIIb) 
were also included in the RMP. 
Furthermore there is a minor editorial change in the 
list of representatives in the package leaflets of 15 
mg film-coated tablets, 20 mg film-coated tablets, 
10 mg film-coated tablets, 2.5 mg film-coated 
of a prospective, single-arm, non-interventional, open-label 
cohort study was conducted to investigate the safety and 
effectiveness in clinical practice, XANTUS (SN 15914). 
6,785 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation were 
enrolled for prevention of stroke and non-central nervous 
system (CNS) systemic embolism in clinical practice. The 
mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores were both 2.0 in 
XANTUS, compared to a mean CHADS2 and HAS-BLED 
score of 3.5 and 2.8 in ROCKET AF, respectively. Major 
bleeding occurred in 2.1 per 100 patient years. Fatal 
haemorrhage was reported in 0.2 per 100 patient years 
and intracranial haemorrhage in 0.4 per 100 patient years. 
Stroke or non-CNS systemic embolism was recorded in 0.8 
per 100 patient years. These observations in clinical 
practice are consistent with the established safety profile in 
this indication. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC following the submission 
a prospective, non-interventional, open-label cohort study 
was conducted in patient with acute DVT to investigate the 
safety and effectiveness in clinical practice, XALIA (SN 
15915). 5,142 patients with acute DVT were enrolled to 
investigate the long-term safety of rivaroxaban compared 
with standard-of-care anticoagulation therapy in clinical 
practice. Rates of major bleeding, recurrent VTE and all-
cause mortality for rivaroxaban were 0.7%, 1.4% and

0.5%, respectively. There were differences in patient 
baseline characteristics including age, cancer and renal 
impairment. A pre-specified propensity score stratified 
analysis was used to adjust for measured baseline 
differences but residual confounding may, in spite of this, 
influence the results. Adjusted hazard ratios comparing 
rivaroxaban and standard-of-care for major bleeding, 
recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality were 0.77 (95% CI 
0.40   1.50), 0.91 (95% CI 0.54   1.54) and 0.51 (95% CI 
0.24   1.07), respectively. These results in clinical practice 
are consistent with the established safety profile in this 
indication.

However, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low 
anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. Please

As requested by the PRAC, inclusion of new drug-drug 
interaction data in section 4.4 in patients with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment concomitantly 
treated with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor  is introduced for 
the higher strenghts of Xarelto (15 and 20 mg). A minor 
update is introduced in the 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg. 
Furthermore, the MAH introduced amendment of existing 
wording on CYP3A4 inducers in section 4.5 of the SmPC as 
requested by the CHMP and addition of Allergic Oedema 
and Angioedema in section 4.8.  
Introduction of updated PK data in Section 5.2 related to

Based on a consensus paper and data from the MAH's 
Annex II and Package Leaflet

clinical and safety databases, the MAH proposed to include 
Update of section 4.4 of the Summary of Product 
Charateristics (SmPC) to include information on 
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding by using gastroprotective 
co-medication.  
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC based on 
information from clinical trials. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated 
accordingly. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the 
Product Information in line with the current version 
of the SmPC guideline/QRD templates and also 
information on precautionary measures to reduce the risk 
of gastrointestinal bleeding by using gastroprotective co-
medication in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The PL has been 
updated accordingly. 
Based on the information provided by the completed and 
ongoing trials and the mode of action of rivaroxaban, a 
revision of section 4.8 of the SmPC was considered 
necessary to reflect the most recent knowledge on this 
product. Furthermore, the observed frequency of some of 
the adverse reactions has been changed based on the 
compiled clinical study data. 
Changes in frequency of some ADRs have been made as 
well as the inclusion of the new ADRs pseudoaneurysm 
formation following percutaneous intervention,

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem Statement 
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and seventh most common cancer overall. 
In 2012, approximately 528,000 new cervical cancer cases were diagnosed globally. Cervical cancer 
accounted for 7.5% of all female cancer deaths with approximately 266,000 deaths; the majority (87%) 
of these deaths occurs in developing countries (Globocan, 2012). In the European Union (EU), the crude 
incidence of cervical cancer is 13.2/100,000 and the crude mortality rate is 5.9/100,000 women/year. 
The majority of invasive cervical cancers (70%) are caused by persistent infections with human 
papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 or 18. This has led to the development of vaccines against HPV16 and 18. 
The Féderation Internationale de Gynécologie et d’Obstétrique (FIGO) classified cervical cancer staging 
(stage I−IV) based on clinical examination including tumour size (IA,B), vaginal or parametrial 
involvement (stage IIA−IIIB), bladder or rectum extension (stage IVA), and distant metastases (stage 
IVB). Advanced stage disease is usually characterized by large central pelvic tumours which are necrotic 
and often the cause of significant bleeding as well as the involvement of adjacent pelvic organs (vagina, 
bladder, rectum, ureters). The mainstay of primary treatment for advanced disease (stage II−IV) is 
combination radiation therapy and radiation-sensitizing platinum-based chemotherapy (ESMO Clinical 
Practice Guideline, 2012). 
Up to 50% of patients with advanced disease will have one or more recurrences, which are generally 
considered incurable, particularly if distant metastases, have developed; chemotherapy is usually 
recommended for these patients. In patients who present with distant metastasis (stage IVB), 
chemotherapy treatment is essentially palliative, and although the optimal regimen for chemotherapy 
has not been defined, cisplatin combination therapy is considered the standard of care (ESMO Clinical 
Practice Guideline, 2012). Carboplatin or non-platinum regimens (e.g., paclitaxel or topotecan) are 
options for patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin (Colombo et al. 2012). 
About the product 
Avastin contains bevacizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody which bind to vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and thereby inhibits 
the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt 1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial 
cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF regresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises 
remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the formation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting 
tumour growth. 
Avastin was initially authorised in the EU on 12 January 2005 for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma 
of the colon or rectum in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. It is currently approved 
in combination with other medicines to treat metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC), 
metastatic breast cancer (mBC), Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced and/or metastatic renal 
cell cancer (mRCC), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer (see SmPC section 
4.1 for full detailed indications). 
As part of the present variation, the applicant applied for the following indication: 
Bevacizumab, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or paclitaxel and topotecan is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. 
The final indication approved by the CHMP is as follows: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 7/68 
 
 
 
 
Bevacizumab, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in 
patients who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see SmPC Section 5.1). 
The recommended dose of Avastin is 15 mg/kg of body weight given once every 3 weeks as an 
intravenous infusion. It is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying 
disease or until unacceptable toxicity (see SmPC section 5.1). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH did not submit an ERA since bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody (protein), and is therefore 
exempt from the need for an ERA. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In support of this application the MAH provided data from study GOG-0240 which is a randomised, 
open-label, multicentre Phase III trial of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin plus 
paclitaxel versus the non-platinum doublet, topotecan plus paclitaxel) in women with persistent, 
recurrent, or stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix. 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
GOG-0240 
Study GOG-0240 (also known by Study ML01230) was a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter 
study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab 
compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with persistent, recurrent, or stage IVB carcinoma of the 
cervix. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study enrolled patients (women aged ≥ 18 years) with persistent, recurrent or Stage IVB carcinoma 
of the cervix with measurable disease, a GOG PS 0 vs.1, no prior chemotherapy other than with radiation, 
and  no  prior  therapy  with  bevacizumab  or  other  VEGF  inhibitors  or  VEGF  receptor–targeted  agents. 
Further details on inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below: 
Inclusion criteria: 
•  Patients had primary persistent, recurrent, or stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous 
carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix that was not amenable to curative treatment with surgery 
and/or radiation therapy. 
•  All patients had measurable disease. Measurable disease was defined as at least one lesion that could 
be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion had 
to be ≥ 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain X-ray, CT, and 
MRI,  or  ≥  10  mm  when  measured  by  spiral  CT.  Biopsy  confirmation  was  required  if  the  lesion(s) 
measured < 30 mm or if the treating physician determined it was clinically indicated. Patients had to 
have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by RECIST. 
This lesion was to be the one that was biopsied if one was performed. Tumours within a previously 
irradiated  field  were  designated  as  “non-target”  lesions  unless  progression  was  documented  or  a 
biopsy was obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized to receive one of the following four treatment regimens: 
• Regimen I: Cisplatin plus paclitaxel without bevacizumab 
At the discretion of the investigator, patients received one of 3 options: paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 IV over 24 
hours on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on Day 2 every 3 weeks (q3w); or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 
3 hours on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on Day 2 (q3w); or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours on 
Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 (q3w). The schedule was entered on the case report form (CRF) 
and remained constant for the duration of therapy. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 11/68 
 
 
 
 
• Regimen II: Cisplatin plus paclitaxel with bevacizumab 
At the discretion of the investigator, patients received one of 3 options: paclitaxel 135 mg/ m2 IV over 24 
hours on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/ m2 IV on Day 2 plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on Day 2 (q3w); or 
paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 IV over 3 hours on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on Day 2 plus bevacizumab 15 
mg/kg IV on Day 2 (q3w); or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours on Day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV 
on Day 1 and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on Day 1  (q3w). The schedule was  entered on the CRF and 
remained constant for the duration of therapy. 
• Regimen III: Topotecan plus paclitaxel without bevacizumab 
Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours on Day 1 and Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on Days 
1-3 (q3w). 
• Regimen IV: Topotecan plus paclitaxel with bevacizumab 
Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours on Day 1 and Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on Days 
1-3 plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV on Day 1 (q3w). 
The  patient’s  weight  at  screening  was  used  to  determine  the  bevacizumab  dose  to  be  used  for  the 
duration  of  the  study.  If  a  patient’s  weight  changed  by  ≥10%  during  the  course  of  the  study,  the 
bevacizumab dose was recalculated. 
In  all  treatment  regimens,  cycles  were  repeated  every  3  weeks,  and  patients  continued  on-study 
treatment  until  disease  progression  or  unacceptable  toxicities  prohibited  further  therapy.  If  patients 
experienced a complete response (CR) on study they could receive an additional 2–3 cycles of therapy at 
their physician’s discretion and then discontinue study therapy. Patients were followed until death, and 
even if the patient was taken off protocol therapy, all therapies and toxicities were reported on GOG forms 
until progression was documented. 
The following dose modifications were permitted for components of chemotherapy in cases of tolerability 
or toxicity, although once a dose was reduced, no dose re-escalation was allowed: 
• Cisplatin at an initial dose of 50 mg/m2 was reduced to 37.5 mg/m2, and then, if required, to 25 mg/m2. 
• Paclitaxel at an initial dose of 135 mg/m2 (24-hour infusion schedule) was reduced to 110 mg/ m2, and 
then, if required, to 90 mg/m2. 
• Paclitaxel at an initial dose of 175 mg/m2 (3-hour infusion schedule) was reduced to 140 mg/m2, and 
then, if required, to 105 mg/m2. 
• Topotecan at an initial dose of 0.75 mg/m2 was reduced to 0.6 mg/m2, and then, if required, to 0.45 
mg/m2. 
If a patient was unable to proceed with therapy despite two dose reductions as outlined, the patient was 
removed from the study. 
The design of the study is presented in the Figure 1.

Figure 1: GOG-0240 Study design 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of Study GOG-0240 were: 
• To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves OS in patients with persistent, 
recurrent, or stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix. 
• To determine if the regimen of paclitaxel and topotecan (non-platinum) improves OS in comparison to 
the standard cisplatin and paclitaxel regimen in patients with persistent, recurrent, or stage IVB of the 
cervix. 
• To determine and compare the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) as assessed by CTCAE 
version 3.0 for the regimens administered in this study. 
The secondary objectives included the estimation and comparison of the progression-free survival (PFS) 
and the proportion of tumour responses of patients treated with the regimens investigated on this study 
(reported herein using the GOG RECIST criteria). In addition, a secondary objective was to determine 
whether the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy, or the substitution of cisplatin with topotecan 
improves  the  health  related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  as  measured  by  the  FACT-Cx  TOI  and  produces 
favourable  toxicity  profiles  (with  a  particular  focus  on  peripheral  neuropathy  as  measured  by  the 
FACT/GOGNtx4 subscale and pain as measured by the BPI single item). 
Finally exploratory endpoints included prognostic markers for predictive modelling the impact of smoking 
on prognosis and the rates of patients remaining stable, improving, or worsening as measured by the 
FACT-Cx TOI, the FACT/GOG-Ntx4, and BPI single-item (responder analyses).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization until 
death from any cause. For patients who had not died by the time of analysis, data were censored as of the 
last contact date at which the patient was known to be alive. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Progression free survival (PFS): defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. 
Objective  response  rate  (ORR):  defined  as  the  percentage  of  patients  who  had  objective  response. 
Objective response was defined as a complete or partial overall response determined on two consecutive 
investigator  assessments  ≥  4  weeks  apart  in  patients  with  measurable  disease  at  baseline.  Patients 
without a post-baseline tumour assessment were considered non-responders. 
ORR was assessed based on the investigator assessment using the GOG RECIST v1.0 criteria. There was 
no centrally, blinded review. 
Quality of Life: HRQoL was measured by the FACT-Cx TOI. Measures selected included the FACT-Cx, the 
4 sensory items of the FACT/GOG-Ntx4, and the “worst pain” single item from the BPI Short Form. 
The  FACT-Cx  is  the  FACT-G  (version  4)  plus  a  cervix  cancer-specific  subscale.  The  primary  HRQoL 
analysis used the Trial Outcomes Index (FACT-Cx TOI) which is a summary score of the items of the 
physical well-being, functional well-being, and of the cervix cancer subscales. 
The  FACT/GOG-Ntx  is  the  FACT-G  plus  an  11-item  subscale  evaluating  the  symptoms  and  concerns 
associated  with  chemotherapy-induced  neuropathy.  The  FACT/GOGNtx4  was  included  to  assess  the 
neurotoxicity that may result from the cisplatin-paclitaxel regimen. 
The BPI is a 23-item, self-report instrument designed to assess pain in cancer and other diseases. HRQoL 
was collected at five timepoints: baseline, prior to Cycle 2 (3 weeks after Cycle 1), prior to Cycle 5 (12 
weeks after Cycle 1), 6 months post-Cycle 1, and 9 months post-Cycle 1. All HRQoL forms were to be 
completed during protocol-based office visits (i.e., no mailed forms were used). 
Sample size 
The two primary hypotheses to be tested were whether the addition of bevacizumab improves survival 
and whether combining paclitaxel with topotecan instead of cisplatin improves survival. The study was 
designed to detect a 30% reduction in death associated with addition of either factor, corresponding to a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7. In order to detect such a difference with 90% power (under the assumption of 
no interaction), it was required that at least 346 deaths were observed in the two levels for the factor 
being tested. 
The total planned patient accrual was up to 450 patients.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was 
stratified by the following criteria: disease stage (persistent/recurrent vs. Stage IVB), performance status 
(0 vs. 1) and prior platinum therapy (yes vs. no).

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The two primary hypotheses to be tested were whether the addition of bevacizumab (Factor A) improves 
survival  and  whether  combining  paclitaxel  with  topotecan  instead  of  cisplatin  (Factor  B)  improves 
survival.  
Table 2: Relationship between Factor A and B marginal survival functions used to assess hypothesis 
testing 
Factor A was employed to investigate the effects of bevacizumab. Factor B was employed to investigate 
the regimen utilizing topotecan instead of cisplatin. The control arm was the administration of cisplatin 
and paclitaxel. Level I was considered to be the “non-experimental” level for each factor whereas Level II 
was  the  “experimental”  level  of  each  factor.  The  marginal  survival  of  patients  without  bevacizumab 
treatment, Snobev (t), was obtained by combining the patients who received the regimens across the first 
row. Likewise, an estimate of the marginal survival of patients who received bevacizumab treatment, Sbev 
(t), was obtained by combining the patients who received the regimens across the second row. 
In the protocol, two efficacy analyses were initially planned for this study, an interim analysis at the time 
when  173  deaths  had  been  observed  in  the  entire  study  and  a  final  analysis  when  346  deaths  were 
observed in the two levels for the factor being tested. To assess the null hypothesis of H01: Sbev (t) = 
Snobev (t), a one-sided stratified log-rank test was conducted at an overall 2.5% level of significance, using 
the spending function α(t*) = αt2 provided by Lan and DeMets (i.e., α = 0.025; z-scores are 2.498 at the 
interim [t = 0.5] and 2.018 at the final analysis [t = 1], corresponding to alpha spending of 0.00625 and 
0.01875). The log-rank test was stratified on the prognostic factors listed in above Section Randomisation 
and the treatment levels for Factor B. A similar analysis was conducted to test H02: Scis + tax (t) = Stop + 
tax(t), using a one-sided stratified log-rank test with an overall 2.5% level of significance, using the same 
alpha spending function. 
The primary analysis of OS assumed no treatment interaction between chemotherapy and bevacizumab 
treatment. For each of the hypotheses, the comparison of OS between treatment arms was based on a 
two-sided stratified log-rank test at the 5% level of significance. The stratification factors were disease 
stage (persistent/recurrent vs. stage IVB), Performance Status (0 vs. 1), prior platinum therapy (yes vs. 
no),  and  the  level  of  the  other  treatment  assignment  (experimental  vs.  reference).  Results  from  an 
unstratified log-rank test were also presented. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate median 
OS for both treatment arms, and the 95% confidence intervals (Cis) for median OS were computed using 
Greenwood’s  formula.  Kaplan-Meier  curves  were  constructed  to  provide  a  visual  depiction  of  the 
difference  between  the  treatment  arms.  Estimates  of  the  treatment  effect  were  expressed  as  hazard

ratios (HRs) with use of a stratified Cox model with the same stratification variables used in the stratified 
log-rank test, including the 95% CIs. The unstratified HR was also presented. 
A test for interaction between bevacizumab and chemotherapy treatment was conducted at the 10% level 
of significance against a two-sided alternative with a score test for interaction using a Cox proportional 
hazards model.  
To  further  investigate  the  similarity  of  the  two  chemotherapy  regimens,  the  ratio  of  the  HRs  was 
computed by comparing Cis+Pac+Bv group with Top+Pac+Bv group. The parameter estimates for the log 
HRs were taken from the stratified Cox regression models. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  using  an  O’Brien  Fleming  boundary;  this  more  conservative 
approach  allowed  comparison  with  the  protocol-specified  alpha  spending  function.  Additionally,  the 
significance level was adjusted to allow for the two primary hypotheses by applying a 2.5% two-sided 
alpha to the bevacizumab versus no bevacizumab comparison. 
Additional Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
Time to Censoring for Overall Survival: Kaplan-Meier curves of time to censoring were constructed to 
visually inspect any differences in follow-up between treatment arms. 
Multivariate Cox Regression Models for Overall Survival: OS was also analyzed using a multivariate Cox 
regression model adjusted for treatment and the baseline prognostic factors that might be associated 
with OS. No covariate selection process was applied; all covariates were included in the model, regardless 
of statistical significance. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  using  an  O’Brien  Fleming  boundary;  this  more  conservative 
approach  allowed  comparison  with  the  protocol-specified  alpha  spending  function.  Additionally,  the 
significance level was adjusted for the two primary hypotheses by applying a 2.5% alpha (2-sided) to the 
bevacizumab versus no bevacizumab comparison.

prognostic  factors  that  might  be  associated  with  OS.  No  covariate  selection  process  was  applied;  all

To evaluate the robustness of the treatment effect observed in the primary efficacy analysis, subgroup 
analyses  were  performed,  with  the  subgroups  defined  by  demographic  and  baseline  prognostic 
characteristics. The following demographic and baseline characteristics were considered: age ( < 50, 50 
− 65, > 65 years), race (White, non-White), baseline Performance Status (0, 1), smoking status (never, 
previous, 
current),

recurrence within the field previously treated by radiation therapy (yes, no). 
Descriptive summaries of OS were produced for each level of the categorical variables listed above for 
each treatment arm. These descriptive summaries consisted of the Kaplan-Meier estimates of median 
time to event and the unstratified HR and its 95% CI. 
Adjustment for Covariates 
The  analyses  of  the  time-to-event  endpoints,  including  OS  and  PFS,  were  adjusted  for  the  three 
stratification factors at randomization: disease stage (persistent/recurrent vs. stage IVB), Performance 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 16/68 
 
 
 
 
Status (0 vs. 1), prior platinum therapy (yes vs. no), and the level of the other treatment assignment 
(experimental vs. reference). Specifically, the Cox proportional hazard regression model included the four 
covariates  except  when  the  results  were  generated  for  each  of  the  4  treatment  arms.  The  stratified 
analysis provided an estimation of the HR taking into account the possible confounding effects from the 
stratification factors. 
OS was also analyzed using a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for treatment and the baseline 
prognostic  factors  that  might  be  associated  with  OS.  No  covariate  selection  process  was  applied;  all 
covariates were included in the model, regardless of statistical significance. 
Handling of Dropout or Missing Data 
For OS, data for patients who were lost to follow-up were analyzed as censored observations on the date 
of  last  contact.  For  PFS,  data  for  patients  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  were  analyzed  as  censored 
observations on the date of the last tumor assessment or if no post-randomization tumor assessment is 
available, at the date of randomization. For objective response, patients without a post-baseline tumor 
assessment were considered non-responders. 
For HRQoL, each item in the FACT-Cx TOI and FACT/GOG-Ntx4 subscale were scored using a 5-point scale 
(0= not at all; 1 =  a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3  =  quite a bit; 4 = very much). Within an individual 
assessment, in order to address whether one or more items were not answered, a subscale score was 
computed as long as more than 50% of subscale items were answered. A subscale score S i with Ni items 
was calculated as: Where δij was equal to 1 when the jth item had a valid response, otherwise it was equal 
to  0  and  sij  was  the  response  score  of  the  jth  item.  The  total  FACT-Cx  TOI  score  was  the  sum  of  the 
subscale scores if at least 80% of FACT-Cx TOI items provided valid answers. 
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
A  DSMB  was  established  to  independently  evaluate  the  safety  of  the  patients  participating  in  Study 
GOG-0240, which was designed, conducted, monitored, and analyzed by the GOG. The DSMB and DMC 
also met to review the results of the efficacy interim analysis. 
Two efficacy analyses were performed. A first efficacy analysis, with a data cut-off in February 2012, 
occurred as pre-specified in the protocol when approximately 50% of the events (deaths) required for full 
information had been observed. A second efficacy analysis, with a data cut-off of 12 December 2012 was 
conducted at the request of the DSMB. This efficacy analysis, which was not pre-specified in the protocol, 
included 78% of the death events required for full information and is considered the final analysis.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was activated and dated 10 March 2009. The protocol for Study GOG-0240 was 
amended 8 times on the following dates and in addition to minor clarifications, corrections, or editorial 
changes to the protocol and ICF documents, the following were included: 
• 24 September 2009 
- Only minor clarification corrections to the protocol and ICF were added. 
• 1 July 2010 
- For translational research, collection of archival tumour tissue was added. 
- The appendix pertaining to the smoking questionnaire was deleted as it was available through SEDES. 
Reference to the smoking questionnaire stated that mandatory submission via SEDES was to occur. 
-  The  CAEPR  for  bevacizumab  was  updated  to  version  2.1,  which  now  included  frequency  data  (the 
previous version did not have categories for Likely, Less Likely, or Rare but Serious). 
- The addition that patients who experienced a CR may have received an additional 2-3 cycles of therapy 
at their physician’s discretion before discontinuing study therapy. 
• 22 December 2010  
- Appendix VI, International Participation (Spain), was added, with information that PMB/NCI would not 
supply bevacizumab to GEICO sites. 
- Updates to provide current information for IRB approval submissions to CTSU were included. 
- Updates to provide current information for AdEERS expedited reports were included. 
• 4 April 2011 
- The following information was added to the procedures for AdEERS monitoring: AML/MDS events must 
be reported via AdEERS (in addition to routine AE reporting mechanisms). In NCI CTCAE v3.0, the event 
could be reported as: “Secondary malignancy-Other (specify)”. 
• 17 August 2011 
- For reports through AdEERS, CTCAE v3.0 was to be used through 30 September 2011, and thereafter, 
CTCAE v4.0 was to be used. Sites were to report on the GOG CRFs using CTCAE v3.0. 
• 26 October 2011 
-  For  translational  research,  regarding  the  quick  scan  summary  of  the  specimen  requirements  for 
GOG-0240, the information for WB02, WB03, and WB04 submissions was deleted. The requirement for 
Forms SP-WB02-0240, SPWB03- 0240, and SP-WB04-0240 were deleted. 
• 6 December 2011 
- The IND number was changed from 7921 to 113912. 
- The CAEPR list for bevacizumab was updated to Version 2.2, October 21, 2011. 
-  The  Agent  Specific  Adverse  Event  List  (ASAEL)  was  renamed  the  Specific  Protocol  Exceptions  to 
Expedited Reporting (SPEER), and included updates and changes to Added New Risk, Increase in Risk 
Attribution, Decrease in Risk Attribution, and Provided Further Clarification, as well as modification of 
SPEER reporting requirements.

• 25 May 2012 
-  The  addition  of  the  “Interim  Analysis  Report”  and  conclusions  of  this  analysis  were  included  in  the 
protocol. The GOG’s DSMB reviewed the results and concluded: 
- Topotecan was not a superior substitute for cisplatin with paclitaxel chemotherapy by OS in this group 
of  patients  and  recommended  that  information  be  communicated  to  the  physicians  and  patients 
participating in the study. The OS analysis did not indicate that the topotecan regimens performed worse 
than the cisplatin regimens. Given these results, patients who were receiving therapy with any of the four 
arms  of  GOG-0240  could  remain  on  their  current  treatment  assignment  unless  progression  or 
unacceptable  toxicity  developed.  As  the  protocol  was  closed  to  accrual,  no  treatment  changes  were 
incorporated. 
-  The  results  concerning  the  topotecan  regimens  in  the  GOG-0240  protocol  were  independent  of  the 
tolerability and efficacy of anti-angiogenesis therapy using bevacizumab in this study population and the 
study remained open awaiting results for the bevacizumab question.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No dose-finding studies were submitted. In study GOG-0240, the dose of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 
3 weeks (q3w) was selected as earlier evidence from Study GOG-0227C with bevacizumab monotherapy 
dosed at 15 mg/kg IV q3w in patients with recurrent cervical cancer demonstrated that bevacizumab was 
well tolerated and active. Furthermore, previous clinical trial experience in the metastatic cervical cancer 
setting demonstrated clinical activity and acceptable safety when bevacizumab was dosed at 15 mg/kg IV 
q3w in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. A dose of bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks 
(q2w) or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV q3w, which is equivalent to a dose of 5 mg/kg/week, is the most 
commonly  used  dose  of  bevacizumab  that  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  and  safe  when  added  to 
chemotherapy regimens in solid tumours.  
Cisplatin  plus  paclitaxel  (Cis+Pac)  or  topotecan  plus  paclitaxel  (Top+Pac)  were  selected  as 
chemotherapeutic combination partners since earlier studies provided evidence of higher response rates 
and longer duration of remission in advanced disease. Doses of chemotherapy were used in accordance 
with previous published studies and in accordance with approved labelling information. At the discretion 
of the investigator, patients received one of 2 options for their paclitaxel dosing regimen (paclitaxel 135 
mg/m2 IV over 24 hours or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours). Both doses of paclitaxel are considered 
equivalent; no evidence of a difference between short and long infusions in terms of OS, PFS, and tumour 
response was noted in a meta-analysis by the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group, and in most cases 
a  greater  proportion  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  toxicity  occurred  in  the  24-hour  infusion  group 
compared with the 3-hour group. 
Study  GOG-0240  was  designed  to  test  both  the  relative  efficacy  and  safety  of  two  chemotherapy 
combinations  (i.e.  cisplatin-paclitaxel  versus  topotecan-paclitaxel)  that  have  never  been  directly 
compared  in  this  setting,  and  the  potential  additional  effect  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  these  two 
combinations.  The  study  was  generally  well-conducted  and  enrolled  452  patients  (women  aged  ≥18 
years) with persistent, recurrent or Stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix with measurable disease, a GOG PS 
0 vs.1, no prior chemotherapy other than with radiation and no prior anti-VEGF drug (see SmPC section 
5.1). 
The baseline characteristics were well-balanced, however, only few patients were over 65 years. Also, the 
majority of the patients had squamous cell carcinoma, persistent/recurrent disease, 1-2 metastatic sites, 
lymph node involvement, and more than 6 months of platinum free interval.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 41/68 
 
 
 
 
The comparison of chemotherapy + bevacizumab vs. chemotherapy is acknowledged. The comparison of 
topotecan + paclitaxel + bevacizumab vs. cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab is relevant and supported. 
Topotecan is an option for patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin, e.g. due to acquired drug resistance 
making platinum-based therapies less effective or due to unacceptable adverse events profile. The study 
design (2 x 2 factorial design) was pre-specified in the protocol and only powered for the pooled analysis. 
The factorial study design has shown to be very valuable for large mortality trials. More importantly, this 
study  design  depends  on  the  assumption  that  there  is  no  interaction  between  bevacizumab  and  the 
chemotherapy backbones. The HRs for bevacizumab vs. no bevacizumab and topotecan vs. cisplatin are 
considered comparable. There is no indication of any interaction. 
The dose of bevacizumab, cisplatin, topotecan and paclitaxel all reflect current standards. The primary 
objective of the study was to demonstrate superiority with regard to OS. PFS and Overall Response were 
secondary endpoints. These secondary endpoints were assessed based only on investigator assessment 
using  the  GOG  RECIST  v1.0  criteria.  Health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  was  also  assessed  using 
various scales. Interpretation of these secondary endpoints is hampered by the open-label nature of the 
study and the lack of a central, blinded review.   
There were in general few protocol amendments and violations. 
Regarding  the  release  of  results  from  the  second  interim  analysis  by  the  DSMB  to  both  patients  and 
investigators approximately 8-9 months before the data cut-off date, there seems to be no solid evidence 
for any operational bias. After this analysis it was communicated to both patients enrolled into the trial 
and all investigators that the topotecan-containing regimens were not superior to the cisplatin-containing 
regimens. No data on the potential additional effect of bevacizumab to either combination was released at 
that  time.  In  addition,  although  the  numbers  were  small,  reasons  for  treatment  discontinuation  were 
comparable between the different treatment arms, and more or less comparable between the first Interim 
Analysis and the final analyses (data not shown).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  endpoint  of  this  study  is  OS,  which  is  considered  a  robust  and  hard  endpoint.  The  main 
analysis shows a HR=0.74 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.94; p=0.0132), with a difference in median OS of 3.9 months 
(12.9 months vs. 16.8 months) in favour of chemotherapy + bevacizumab. This improvement is larger 
than the findings from the OS analysis by backbone regimen (i.e. cisplatin + paclitaxel vs. topotecan + 
paclitaxel),  which  indicated  that  adding  bevacizumab  to  either  regimen  leads  to  a  non-statistically 
significant increase in OS of 3-3.2 months. The follow-up OS analyses were in line with the primary OS 
analyses  (cut-off  12  December  2012),  and  provided  evidence  that  the  effect  of  bevacizumab  is 
maintained when late events are taken into consideration. 
The  fact  that  adding  bevacizumab  results  in  a  slightly  lower  median  OS  increase  in  the  analysis  by 
treatment arm compared with the pooled analysis (approximately 1 month) is mainly caused by the lower 
median OS of the topotecan containing regimens versus the cisplatin regimens. The topotecan containing 
regimens performed slightly worse compared with the cisplatin containing regimens (-2.2 months OS 
difference),  though  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  These  findings  may  trigger 
reservations against the pooling of the data, but this is not justified when taking the totality of data and 
evidence into consideration. Furthermore, the HRs in the individual chemotherapy arms were in line with 
the overall estimate.  
Although a numerical difference in favour of cisplatin was observed in the OS analysis by chemotherapy, 
the number of responders was comparable between cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab and topotecan 
+ paclitaxel + bevacizumab (ORR-analysis). Therefore, it is concluded that the combination of topotecan 
+ paclitaxel + bevacizumab is a valuable alternative for patients that cannot be treated with cisplatin (see 
SmPC section 4.1). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 42/68 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, ORR results are not in line with the OS results that were slightly more favourable in the 
cisplatin-arms (+/- bevacizumab) compared with the topotecan-arms (+/- bevacizumab) (see above). 
However, there are clear indications that the addition of bevacizumab to the topotecan + paclitaxel arm 
and the addition of bevacizumab to the cisplatin + paclitaxel arm resulted in rather similar benefits in 
ORR, PFS and OS. 
The results of the OS subgroup analysis were in general consistent with the overall estimate although 
patients with squamous cell carcinoma seemed to have a better effect of bevacizumab compared with 
patients  with  adenocarcinoma  and  adenosquamous  carcinoma.  However,  there  is  great  uncertainty 
related to these data, which is reflected in the wide CIs. The subgroup analysis was of exploratory nature, 
the numbers were small and the issue of multiplicity was not controlled in this setting. Therefore, there is 
at present no convincing statistical evidence for any different responses to systemic therapy in patients 
with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on histological subgroups. 
The PFS results support OS and there seems to be no deterioration of QoL by the addition of bevacizumab 
to chemotherapy.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study GOG-0240 provides evidence for the effect of bevacizumab + chemotherapy in the treatment 
of  patients  with  persistent,  recurrent,  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  cervix.  An  increase  in  median 
survival  of    3.9  months  is  considered  clinically  relevant.  OS  by  chemotherapy  did  not  show  any 
statistically significant result, but a numerical difference in favour of cisplatin was observed. However, the 
number of responders was comparable between cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab and topotecan + 
paclitaxel + bevacizumab arms. Therefore, it is concluded that the combination of topotecan + paclitaxel 
+  bevacizumab is  a  valuable  alternative  for  patients  that  cannot  be  treated with  cisplatin  (see  SmPC 
section 4.1).  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
For the safety analyses, the clinical cut-off date for this report was 12 December 2012, with a database 
lock of 17 October 2013. The safety analyses were based on the safety population. The denominator used 
in the analyses was based on the treatment actually received by the patient rather than the treatment to 
which patients were randomized. From the randomized population, 12 patients did not receive any 
treatment, and 2 patients randomized to the bevacizumab arm did not receive any bevacizumab, so were 
part the chemotherapy alone arm for the safety analyses. The primary safety analyses were conducted to 
evaluate the safety of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in comparison to chemotherapy alone. Additional 
analyses were performed to examine the safety of platinum vs. non-platinum treatment groups and by 
trial treatment arms. 
Patient exposure 
Chemotherapy + Bevacizumab exposure 
The overall median duration of exposure (i.e., duration based on the start date of the first component and 
the last date of protocol therapy from the treatment completion form) was 17.9 weeks in the Chemo alone 
group  and  20.7  weeks  in  the  Chemo+Bv  group  (Table  20).  The  median  duration  of  exposure  of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 43/68 
 
 
 
 
bevacizumab  was  17.6  weeks  in  the  Chemo+Bv  group,  and  the  median  durations  of  the  individual 
chemotherapy components were comparable between the Chemo alone and Chemo+Bv groups or slightly 
longer in the Chemo+Bv group.

Table 23: Overall Safety by Trial Treatment 
The  most  common  (i.e.,  an  incidence  of  ≥  50%)  AEs  of  any  grade  in  any  treatment  group  were  AEs 
typically associated with components of the chemotherapy and included nausea, constipation, fatigue, 
peripheral sensory neuropathy, and alopecia. For chemo vs. chemo+Bv the frequencies of all these listed 
AEs were observed in the similar range. Analysed by chemotherapy backbone (Cis vs. Top regimens; e.g. 
Cis+Pac±Bv vs. Top+Pac±Bv), nausea, constipation and fatigue were observed at a higher frequency in 
the Cis regimen, except for peripheral sensory neuropathy which was observed in a similar frequency, 
and alopecia had a higher incidence in the Top-regimen. 
Diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  vomiting,  oedema  peripheral,  headache,  pain  conditions  (back  pain, 
arthralgia,  pain  in  extremity),  decreased  appetite,  hyperglycaemia,  hypomagnesaemia,  dyspnoea, 
weight decreased, urinary tract infection, insomnia and hypertension were also among the most common 
AEs of any grade (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients in any treatment group), which are shown in Table 24.  
The  body  systems  in  which  patients  most  frequently  reported  at  least  one  AE  were  gastrointestinal 
disorders,  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  nervous  system  disorders,  skin  and 
subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders,  and  metabolism  and 
nutrition disorders. 
Hypertension  (all  grades)  occurred  in  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  bevacizumab-containing 
group (Chemo alone: 6% vs. Chemo + Bv: 29%), and analysed with regard to chemotherapy backbone, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

hypertension (all grades) was reported more often in the Cis-regimen than in the Top-regimen (Cis+Pac 
± Bv: 21% vs. Top+Pac± Bv: 14%).

arms (Cis + Pac + Bv: 78.0%; Top + Pac + Bv: 73.4%) compared to the Chemo alone treatment arms 
(Cis + Pac: 58.8%; Top + Pac: 55.6%).  
The most frequently reported Grade ≥ 3 AEs (≥ 5% in either treatment group) are shown in Table 26, of 
which abdominal pain and fatigue were overall the most frequently reported.  
The most frequent of Grade ≥ 3 AEs (≥ 10% in either treatment arm, by trial treatment) reported in 
patients  were  abdominal  pain,  nausea,  fatigue,  urinary  tract  infection,  hypokalaemia,  hypertension, 
thrombosis, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  
The Grade ≥ 3 AEs with a difference of ≥ 2% between treatment groups showing the greatest difference 
in  incidence  were  hypertension  (Chemo  alone:  0.5%  vs.  Chemo+Bv:  11.5%),  thrombosis  (2.7%  vs. 
8.3%), infection (1.8% vs. 6.4%), fatigue (9.9% vs. 14.2%), and pelvic pain (1.4% vs. 5.5%). Other 
Grade ≥ 3 AE with a ≥ 2% higher incidence in the Bv arm compared to the chemo alone arm were: 
abdominal pain (9.9% vs 11.9%), diarrhoea (2.7% vs 5.5%), anal fistula (- vs 3.7%), proctalgia (- vs 
2.8%)  (these  two  latter  are  observed  in  the  Bv  group  only),  urinary  tract  infection  (6.3%  vs  8.3%), 
cellulitis (0.5% vs 3.2%), hypokalaemia (4.5% vs 7.3%), hyponatremia (1.4% vs 3.7%), dehydration 
(0.5% vs 4.1%), neutropenia (4.1% vs 7.8%), lymphopenia (3.2% vs 6.0%) and back pain (3.2% vs 
5.5%). 
The incidences of Grade ≥ 3 pelvic pain, dyspnoea, hypertension, and thrombosis were higher (≥ 5%) in 
the Cis+Pac+Bv arm compared with the Cis+Pac arm, and the incidence of nausea was higher in Cis+Pac 
arm  compared  with  the  Cis+Pac+Bv  arm.  In  contrast,  the  incidences  of  Grade  ≥  3  abdominal  pain, 
infection, dehydration, fatigue, and hypertension were higher ( ≥ 5%) in the Top+Pac+Bv arm compared 
with Top+Pac arm, and no AE had a higher incidence in the Top+Pac arm compared with the Top+Pac+Bv 
arm (data not shown).

Grade 5 Adverse Events 
Five  patients  (2.3%)  in  the  Chemo  alone  group  and  9  patients  (4.1%)  in  the  Chemo  +  Bv  group 
experienced Grade 5 AEs.  
Among patients in the Chemo alone group (all in Top+Pac), 5 patients experienced Grade 5 AEs: 
- 
Top+Pac: death, epistaxis, lung disorder, febrile neutropenia and pelvic infection. 
In  the  Chemo  +  Bv  group,  9  patients  experienced  a  total  of  11  Grade  5  AEs:  5 patients  were  in  the 
Top + Pac + Bv arm and 4 patients in the Cis + Pac + Bv arm:  
- 
Top+Pac+BV: one patient (neutropenia and cellulitis), one patient (neutropenia and pneumonia), 
one patient each large intestine perforation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sudden death. 
Neutropenia was the only Grade 5 AE reported in more than 1 patient. 
-  Cis+Pac+BV: multi-organ failure, disease progression, ileal perforation, and dyspnoea.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Adverse events that were previously seen to have a higher incidence during bevacizumab treatment were 
subject to a separate analysis.  
These AESIs were: Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) any grade, Bleeding (Grade ≥ 3), Congestive 
heart failure (CHF)/left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (Grade ≥ 3), Febrile neutropenia (Grade ≥ 
3),  Fistula/abscess  [non-GI  (any  grade)],  Gastrointestinal  perforation,  including  fistula/abscess  (any 
grade), Hypertension (Grade ≥ 3), Proteinuria (Grade ≥ 3), Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome  (RPLS)  or  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES)  (any  grade),  Venous 
thromboembolic event (VTE; Grade ≥ 3) and Wound healing complications (Grade ≥ 3). 
The following AESIs were observed at higher incidences in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared 
with the corresponding chemotherapy alone arms:  Grade ≥ 3 hypertension, any grade GI perforation, 
Grade ≥ 3  VTEs,  Grade ≥ 3  bleeding,  any  grade  fistula/abscess  (non-GI),  Grade ≥ 3  proteinuria,  and 
Grade ≥ 3 wound healing complication.  
Bleeding  (≥grade  3),  gastrointestinal  perforations,  hypertension  (≥grade  3)  and  venous  thrombotic 
events (grade ≥3)  were more frequently observed in the cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab (5.5%, 
11%, 12.8% and 12.8%, respectively) and topotecan + paclitaxel + bevacizumab (8.3%, 9.2%, 10.1% 
and  3.7%,  respectively)  arms,  compared  with  cisplatin  +  paclitaxel  (4.4%,  0.9%,  0.9%  and  4.4%, 
respectively) and topotecan + paclitaxel arms (4.6%, 0%, 0% and 1.9%, respectively). 
The  incidence  of  GI  perforations  (mostly  GI  vaginal  fistulae  such  as  rectovaginal  fistulae)  in 
bevacizumab-treated  patients  was  higher  than  that  seen  in  clinical  trials  of  bevacizumab  to  date.  In 
addition, further to the MAH medical review and reclassification of PE cases to VTEs, the Grade ≥ 3 VTE 
rate was higher than previously observed in bevacizumab-treated patients. 
Bevacizumab has a well-known safety profile, which includes hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing 
complications,  mucocutanous  bleeding,  ATEs,  VTEs,  GI-perforations  and  fistula.  These  adverse  drug 
reactions  were  also  observed  in  study  GOG-0240.  Overall,  there  were  more  AEs  in  the  chemo  + 
bevacizumab arm as expected. However, the majority of the AEs are manageable.  
Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs) 
ATEs of any grade were reported in 7 patients (3.2%) in the Chemo alone group and 5 patients (2.3%) in 
the Chemo + Bv group. Grade 4 acute myocardial infarction was reported in 1 patient in the Chemo alone

group. ATEs of any grade were reported in similar proportions between the Top + Pac and Top + Pac + Bv 
arms and in more patients in the Cis + Pac arm compared with the Cis + Pac + Bv arm.  
Medical review of embolism events in AdEERS reports, and the comments recorded in CRFs, revealed that 
all Grade 4 emboli were pulmonary emboli. With the pulmonary emboli re-categorized as Grade ≥ 3 VTEs, 
only one ATE (acute myocardial infarction) was reported, which occurred in the Chemo alone group ( Cis 
+ Pac arm). 
Bleeding (Grade ≥3) 
A total of 10 patients (4.5%) in the Chemo alone group and 15 patients (6.9%) in the Chemo + Bv group 
experienced Grade ≥ 3 bleeding events. These were reported in similar proportions in the Cis+Pac (5 pts) 
and Cis+Pac+Bv (6 pts) arms and in more patients in the Top+Pac+Bv arm (9 pts) compared with the Top 
+ Pac arm (5 pts). 
The  most  frequently  reported  bleeding  events  included  haemorrhage  urinary  tract  (Chemo  alone: 
3 patients vs. Chemo + Bv: 5 patients), rectal haemorrhage (Chemo alone: 3 patients vs. Chemo + Bv: 
3 patients), and vaginal hemorrhage (Chemo alone: 1 patient vs. Chemo + Bv: 5 patients). In the Chemo 
alone group, 1 patient each experienced ureteric haemorrhage and GI anastomotic leak. Upon medical 
review, it was determined that a rectovaginal fistula was reported as a GI anastomotic leak, and this 
patient was therefore also assigned to the GI perforation category.  
More patients in the Top + Pac + Bv arm developed urinary tract haemorrhage compared with the Top + 
Pac arm, and more patients in the Cis + Pac + Bv arm developed vaginal haemorrhage compared with the 
Cis + Pac arm. 
Across  both  treatment  groups,  the  majority  of  patients  (22  of  25)  who  experienced  a  bleeding  event 
experienced Grade 3 events. Two patients, both of whom were in the Chemo + Bv group experienced 
Grade  4  events;  one  patient  (in  Cis+Pac+Bv)  developed  a  vaginal  haemorrhage  and  one  patient  (in 
Top+Pac+Bv) developed an upper GI haemorrhage. One patient in the Chemo alone group (Top+Pac) 
experienced a Grade 5 epistaxis event. 
Congestive Heart Failure/Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (Grade ≥3)  
No patient in either the Chemo alone or Chemo + Bv groups experienced CHF/LVSD. 
Febrile Neutropenia (Grade ≥3) 
A similar proportion of patients in the Chemo alone (5.9%) and Chemo + Bv (5.5%) groups experienced 
Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia events. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia  events were reported in 9 patients 
(4.1%) in the Chemo alone group and 12 patients  (5.5%) in the Chemo + Bv group. With regards to 
Cisplatin; in more patients in the Cis + Pac arm compared with the Cis + Pac + Bv arm (7 vs. 3) and for 
Topotecan: in more patients in the Top + Pac + Bv  arm compared with the Top + Pac arm (9 vs. 6) 
experienced Grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia events.  
The majority (22 of 25) of patients experienced Grade 3 febrile neutropenia. Three patients (1.4%) in the 
Chemo alone group, (i.e. 2 patients in the Cis + Pac arm and 1 patient in the Top + Pac arm) experienced 
Grade  4  febrile  neutropenia  events.  In  the  Top  +  Pac  arm,  1  patient  experienced  a  Grade  5  febrile 
neutropenia event.  
Fistula or Abscess (Non-Gastrointestinal)  
A total of 5 patients (2.3%) in the Chemo alone group and 9 patients (4.1%) in the Chemo + Bv group 
experienced fistula or abscess (primarily reported as non-GI) events of any grade and were reported in 
similar numbers of patients in the Cis+Pac and Cis+Pac+Bv arms (4 in each arm), and more patients in 
the Top+Pac+Bv arm compared with the Top+Pac arm (5 vs. 1). 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 54/68 
 
 
 
 
Fistula and abscess (primarily reported as non-GI) events were further defined following medical review. 
Medical review of the non-GI fistula and abscess events identified 2 out of 5 events in the Chemo alone 
group, and 5 out of 9 events (3 reported as vaginal, 1 reported as enterovaginal, and 1 reported as vesical 
fistula) in the Chemo + Bv group as GI vaginal fistulae (i.e., fistulae between any part of the GI tract, such 
as the anus, ileum, rectum, or colon, and vagina).. 
The majority of patients (10 of 14) experienced vaginal fistula AEs. Medical review of the events reported 
as vaginal fistula, female genital tract fistulae or vesical fistulae revealed 7 out of 14 involved vagina and 
GI tract. 
Two patients had Grade 2 events (1 each in the Cis+Pac arm and the Top+Pac+Bv arm). A total of 7 
patients had Grade 3 vaginal fistula events, of which 3 were reported in patients in the Cis+Pac arm, 3 
were reported in patients in the Cis + Pac + Bv arm, and 1 was reported in 1 patient in the Top + Pac + 
Bv arm. One patient in the Top + Pac + Bv arm experienced a Grade 4 vaginal fistula event. 
One patient in the Top + Pac arm and 1 patient in the Top + Pac + Bv arm developed female genital tract 
fistula events, both of which were Grade 3. Two patients experienced vesical fistula events; 1 patient in 
the Cis + Pac+Bv arm had a Grade 2 event and 1 patient in the Top + Pac + Bv arm had a Grade 3 event. 
Gastrointestinal Perforation 
GI perforation events of any grade were reported more frequently in patients in the Chemo + Bv group 
(22 patients; 10.1%) compared with the Chemo alone group (1 patient; 0.5%). One patient in the Chemo 
alone group experienced a Grade 3 GI anastomotic leak. 
Total Events Including GI-Vaginal Fistulae 
GI Perforation Events 
in  the  chemotherapy 
Of  22  patients  (10.1%)  with  GI  perforation  SMQ  defined  events 
(Chemo) + bevacizumab (Bv) group, 15 patients (7.0%) had GI-vaginal fistulae (see Table 27).  In the 
Chemo  alone  group,  one  patient  (0.5%)  had  a  GI  perforation  SMQ  defined  event;  this  event  was  a 
GI-vaginal fistula.

Non-Gastrointestinal Abscess/Fistula 
Of 9 patients (4.1%) with abscess/fistulae in the Chemo + Bv group, 5 patients (2.2%) had GI-vaginal 
fistulae and 4 patients (1.8%) had abscess/fistulae that did not involve the GI tract.  In the Chemo alone 
group, 5 patients (2.3%) had abscess/fistulae, of which 2 patients (0.9%) had GI-vaginal fistulae and 
3 patients had abscess/fistulae that did not involve the GI tract (1.4%). 
Total GI-Vaginal Fistulae 
Summing  the  GI-vaginal  fistulae  reported  in  both  the  GI  perforation  SMQ  category  (i.e.,  rectovaginal 
fistulae, ileo-recto-vaginal or entero-vaginal fistula, and recto-vaginal-vesical fistula in Table 27) and the 
abscess/fistula AEGT category (i.e., recto- or entero-vaginal fistulae) and counting the three events that

were included in both categories only once, the incidences of GI-vaginal fistulae were 8.3% (18/218) in 
the Chemo + Bv group and 0.9% (2/222) in the Chemo alone group. 
Events Excluding GI-Vaginal Fistulae 
GI Perforation Events 
In the Chemo + Bv group, 7 patients (3.2%) had GI perforation SMQ defined events that involved only the 
GI tract (5 intestinal or rectal perforation; 1 peritonitis; 1 rectal fistula), and in the Chemo alone group, 
no patient had a GI perforation SMQ defined event that involved only the GI tract. 
Non-Gastrointestinal Abscess/Fistula 
In the Chemo + Bv group, 4 patients (1.8%) had abscess/fistulae that did not involve the GI tract, all of 
which  were  vaginal  or  vesicovaginal  fistulae,  and  in  the  Chemo  alone  group,  3  patients  (1.4%)  had 
abscess/fistulae that did not involve the GI tract, all of which were vaginal or vesicovaginal fistulae. 
In  conclusion,  when  comparing  chemotherapy  (Chemo)  alone  versus  chemotherapy + bevacizumab 
(Chemo + Bv),  the  incidences  of  GI  perforation  SMQ  (excluding  GI-vaginal  fistula)  events  are  0%  vs. 
3.2%,  GI-vaginal  fistulae  0.9%  vs.  8.3%,  and  non-GI  fistula  (excluding  GI-vaginal  fistula)  1.4%  vs. 
1.8%.  
GI perforation events by chemo arm 
With  regard  to  trial  treatment  (individual  treatment  arms),  GI  perforation  events  of  any  grade  were 
reported  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  Cis+Pac+Bv  (11.0%)  and  Top+Pac+Bv  (9.2%)  arms; 
1 patient (0.9%) in the Cis+Pac arm and no patient in the Top+Pac arm developed GI perforation events. 
In the Cis + Pac arm, 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 GI anastomotic leak. 
Across bevacizumab-containing treatment arms, the majority of patients (13 of 23) developed anal fistula 
events. Grade 1 or 2 events were experienced by 2 patients in the Cis+Pac+Bv arm and 3 patients in the 
Top+Pac+Bv arm. Grade 3 events occurred in 5 patients in the Cis+Pac+Bv arm and 3 patients in the 
Top+Pac+Bv arm. 
One  patient  in  the  Cis+Pac+Bv  arm  and  1  patient  in  the  Top+Pac+Bv  arm  developed  Grade  3  ileal 
fistulas. Two patients both in the Cis+Pac+Bv arm experienced Grade 3 rectal perforation events. 
In the Top+Pac+Bv arm, 1 patient developed Grade 3 colonic fistula, and 1 patient developed Grade 3 
peritonitis.  In  the  Cis+Pac+Bv  arm,  1  patient  experienced  a  Grade  3  small  intestinal  perforation.  No 
patient in any treatment arm experienced Grade 4 GI perforation events. 
There were 2 Grade 5 events; 1 patient in the Cis+Pac+Bv arm developed an ileal perforation and 1 
patient in the Top+Pac+Bv arm developed a large intestine perforation. 
After medical review, as previously mentioned, only the following AE terms (fistula [i.e., anal, ileal, and 
colonic]  and  anastomotic  leak)  were  found  to  have  a  different  underlying  medical  condition.  GI 
Perforation standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ), non-GI fistula and abscess, ATE and VTE adverse event 
group terms (AEGTs) were medically reviewed in more detail because of the different clinical significance 
of GI perforation compared to rectovaginal fistula and of pulmonary emboli compared to ATE events. 
Summary of prior cancer treatment for cervical cancer 
A summary of prior cancer treatment for cervical cancer, by bevacizumab treatment, for patients who 
developed GI perforations, GI-vaginal fistulae, and non-GI fistulae was provided. 
The proportion of patients with or without prior radiation therapy was balanced across Chemo alone and 
Chemo + Bv groups.  All patients who developed GI perforation or GI-vaginal fistula had prior radiation.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 56/68 
 
 
 
 
 
The rates of GI perforation in patients with prior radiation were 0% and 4.1% in the Chemo alone group 
and Chemo + Bv group, respectively.  The rates of GI-vaginal fistula in patients with prior radiation were 
1.1% and 10.5% in the Chemo alone group and Chemo + Bv group, respectively.  There were no patients 
without  prior  radiation  therapy,  either  in  the  Chemo  alone  group  or  the  Chemo + Bv  group,  who 
developed GI perforation or GI-vaginal fistula. 
For those patients with prior radiation therapy, the rates of non-GI fistula were the same (1.7%) in the 
Chemo alone group and Chemo + Bv group.  For those patients without prior radiation therapy, the rates 
of non-GI fistula were 0% and 2.2% in the Chemo alone group and Chemo + Bv group, respectively. 
The rates of GI perforation in the Chemo + Bv group were 2.6% vs. 3.6% in patients with recurrence 
within  the  field  of  prior  radiation  and  outside  the  field  of  prior  radiation,  respectively.    As  mentioned 
above, there was no GI perforation event in patients who did not have prior radiation or bevacizumab 
treatment. 
The rates of non-GI fistula in the Chemo alone group were 3.2% vs. 0% in patients with recurrence within 
the field of prior radiation and outside the field of prior radiation, respectively.  The rates of non-GI fistula 
in the Chemo + Bv group were 0% vs. 2.9% in patients with recurrence within the field of prior radiation 
and outside the field of prior radiation, respectively.  
The rates of GI-vaginal fistula in the Chemo alone group were 1.1% vs. 0.8% in patients with recurrence 
within  the  field  of  prior  radiation  and  outside  the  field  of  prior  radiation,  respectively.    The  rate  of 
GI-vaginal fistula in the Chemo + Bv group was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of prior 
radiation (16.7%) compared with patients with recurrence outside the field of prior radiation (3.6%).  The 
rate  in  patients  with  recurrence  within  the  field  of  prior  radiation  was  also  higher  in  the 
bevacizumab-treated patients compared with the Chemo alone treated patients (16.7% Chemo + Bv vs. 
1.1% Chemo alone).  
Hypertension (Grade ≥3) 
Grade ≥ 3 hypertension AEs were reported in more patients in the Chemo + Bv group (11.5%) – and in 
a similar proportion of patients in the Cis + Pac + Bv (12.8%) and Top + Pac + Bv (10.1%) -  arms 
compared with the Chemo alone group (0.5%). One patient in the Chemo alone (Cis + Pac arm) group 
developed Grade 3 hypertension. All events were Grade 3 hypertension events. No patient in the Chemo 
+ Bv group discontinued treatment because of hypertension. 
Proteinuria (Grade ≥3) 
Grade  ≥  3  proteinuria  events  were  reported  in  4  patients  (1.8%) in  the  Chemo+Bv  group  –  i.e.  in  3 
patients (2.8%) in the Cis + Pac + Bv arm and 1 patient (0.9%) in the Top + Pac + Bv arm. All incidences 
of proteinuria were Grade 3. No patient in the either chemo alone (Cis + Pac or Top + Pac arms) group 
experienced proteinuria events. 
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome or Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy 
Syndrome (RPLS or PRES) 
No  patient  in  any  treatment  arm  experienced  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome.  Neither 
PRES nor RPLS are AE terms available in NCI CTCAE v.3. Therefore, no patient in either the Chemo alone 
or Chemo+Bv groups could be reported as PRES/RPLS. Medical review of 1 patient in the Chemo + Bv 
group (Cis + Pac + Bv arm) with symptomatic leukoencephalopathy who experienced Grade 4 confusional 
state and Grade 3 seizure revealed MRI findings consistent with PRES/RPLS.

Venous Thromboembolic Event (Grade ≥3) 
Grade ≥ 3 VTEs were reported in more patients in the Chemo + Bv group (8.3%) compared with the 
Chemo alone group (3.2%). Among the four treatment arms, there were unequally distributed as a higher 
proportion  of  patients  in  the  Cis+Pac+Bv  arm  (12.8%)  compared  with  the  Cis +  Pac  arm  (4.4%), 
Top+Pac+Bv arm (3.7%) or the Top+Pac arm (1.9%). 
All thrombosis events were Grade 3. One patient in the Chemo alone group (Cis+Pac arm) had a reported 
Grade 4 pulmonary embolism (PE).  No patient experienced a Grade 5 VTE. 
A  medical  review  of  Grade  ≥  3  VTEs  was  performed.  After  medical  review,  11  cases  of  pulmonary 
embolism that were reported as emboli (unqualified) and initially classified under the ATE category were 
reclassified in the (Grade ≥ 3) VTE category. 
Wound Healing Complications or Dehiscence (Grade ≥3)  
Grade ≥ 3 wound healing complication events were reported in 2 patients (0.9%) in the Chemo + Bv 
group (both patients were in the Top + Pac + Bv cohort) and no patient in the Chemo alone group. The 
2 patients were both in the Top + Pac + Bv arm and experienced Grade 3 wound complication events. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
A total of 81 patients (36.5%) in the Chemo alone group and 111 patients (50.9%) in the Chemo+Bv 
group experienced SAEs. Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in ≥ 5% of patients in either treatment 
arm are shown in Table 28.

Deaths 
As of the clinical cut-off date (12 December 2012), a total of 145 patients (65.3%) in the Chemo alone 
group and 135 patients (61.9%) in the Chemo+Bv group had died. The majority of deaths were due to 
cervical  cancer,  with  comparable  frequencies  in  both  the  Chemo  alone  group  (58.6%)  and  in  the 
Chemo+Bv group (54.6 %). 
A summary of the primary cause of death in these patients by trial treatment is provided in Table 29.

Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015

The total number of patients who died from a cause different from “due to this disease” was very similar 
between the Chemo alone group and Chemo + Bv group:  15 (6.8%) vs. 16 (7.3%).  A higher percentage 
of patients died more than 90 days after the last dose of study treatment in the Chemo alone group (4.1% 
in the Chemo alone group vs. 2.8% in the Chemo + Bv group) and a higher percentage died  ≤ 90 days 
after the last dose of study treatment in the Chemo + Bv group (2.7% in the Chemo alone group vs. 4.6% 
in the Chemo + Bv group), although the percentages are very small.  Among patients who died more than 
90 days after the last dose of study treatment, the most frequent reason was “unknown” (5 
[2.3%] patients in the Chemo alone group vs. 3 [1.4%] in the Chemo + Bv group).  Among patients who 
died ≤ 90 days after the last dose of study treatment, the most frequent reason for death was “due to 
other cause” for patients in the Chemo alone group (4 [1.8%] patients) and “due to protocol treatment” 
for patients in the Chemo + Bv group (4 [1.8%] patients).  
The total number of patients who died from a cause different from “due to this disease” was very similar 
between the two chemotherapy backbones:  15 (6.7%) in the Cis + Pac +/- Bev group and 16 (7.4%) in 
the Top + Pac +/- Bev group.  A higher percentage of patients died more than 90 days after the last dose 
of study treatment in the Cis + Pac +/- Bev group (9 [4.0%] patients in the Cis + Pac +/- Bev group vs. 
6 [2.8%] in the Top + Pac +/- Bev group) and ≤90 days after the last dose of study treatment in the 
Top + Pac +/- Bev group (6 [2.7%] patients in the Cis + Pac +/- Bev group vs. 10 [4.6%] in the Top + Pac 
+/- Bev group), although the percentages are very small. 
In the trial-treatment-arm comparison, the total number of patients who died from a cause different from 
“due to this disease” was very small and ranged from 6 patients in the Cis + Pac arm to 9 patients in both 
the Cis + Pac + Bv and Top + Pac arms.  A higher percentage of deaths in each treatment arm occurred 
> 90 days after the last study treatment except in the Top + Pac + Bv arm ( > 90 days: 4 [3.5%] in 
Cis + Pac, 5 [4.6%] in both the Cis + Pac + Bv and Top + Pac arms, and 1 [0.9%] in the Top + Pac + Bv 
arm).  The number of patients who died ≤ 90 days after the last dose of study treatment from a cause 
different from “due to this disease” were 2 [1.8%] in the Cis + Pac arm, 4 [3.7%] in both the 
Cis + Pac + Bv and Top + Pac arms, and 6 [5.5%] in the Top + Pac + Bv arm 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  tests  related  to  AEs  included  haemoglobin,  peripheral  ANC/granulocytes  count,  peripheral 
platelet count, and peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count. Nearly all patients experienced a Grade 1−4 
laboratory test result for a test related to AEs, with similar incidences between bevacizumab treatment 
groups (Chemo alone: 95.0% vs. Chemo + Bv: 95.9%). 
Across both treatment groups, fewer patients experienced Grade 1 or 2 abnormal laboratory test results 
for tests related to AEs, and the majority of patients with abnormal laboratory test results for tests related

to AEs experienced Grade 3 abnormal test results (Chemo alone: 37.4% vs. Chemo + Bv: 36.2%) or 
Grade 4 (Chemo alone: 26.6% vs. Chemo + Bv: 39.9%) events. 
The incidences of Grade 1 or 2 laboratory test results for tests related to AEs were comparable between 
treatment groups. The incidences of worst grade (Grade 2−4) laboratory parameters during the study 
were  comparable  between  the  Chemo  alone  and  Chemo  +  Bv  groups  for  the  laboratory  parameters 
granulocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, and WBC. 
Clinically significant findings in vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety were 
reported as AEs.  
Safety in special populations 
Adverse Events by Age Group  
Adverse events by age were evaluated using the following age groups: < 65 years and ≥ 65 years. The 
majority of patients were aged < 65 years (Chemo alone: 200 of 222 patients [90.1%] vs. Chemo + Bv: 
199  of  218  patients  [91.3%]),  with  fewer  patients  aged  ≥  65  (Chemo  alone:  22  patients  [9.9%]  vs. 
Chemo + Bv: 19 patients [8.7%]). 
AEs reported with higher incidences in both treatment groups in patients aged ≥ 65 years compared to 
patients aged < 65 years include the following; dyspnoea; blood creatinine; neutropenia; palpitations; 
hypomagnesaemia; dehydration; hyperkalaemia and muscular weakness. 
Adverse Events by Race 
The majority of patients in Study GOG-0240 (safety population) were White, with 177 (79.7%) White and 
45 (20.3%) non-White patients in the  Chemo alone treatment group and 164 (75.2%) White and 54 
(24.8%) non-White patients in the Chemo + Bv treatment group.  
AEs reported with higher incidences in both treatment groups in Non-white versus White patients include 
the  following;  increased  blood  alkaline  phosphatase;  hyperkalaemia;  metabolic  disorder;  peripheral 
motor neuropathy; muscular weakness and hyperhidrosis. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There is no new information specific to bevacizumab with regard to interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Forty patients (18.0%) in the Chemo + Bv group and 56 patients (25.7%) in the Chemo alone group 
experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment regimen. The most frequent body systems 
reported  in  patients  who  discontinued  were  nervous  system  disorders  and  general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions.  
The  AEs  with  the  highest  number  of  patients  who  discontinued  study  treatment  were  neuropathy 
peripheral (Chemo alone: 4% (9 pts) vs. Chemo + bevacizumab: 3% (6 pts)) and unevaluable event (2% 
(4 pts) vs. 4% (9 pts)), drug hypersensitivity [3% (6 pts) vs. <1% (1 patient)] and peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (3 pts in each group). No patient in the Chemo + bevacizumab group discontinued treatment 
because of hypertension.  
33% in the cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm discontinued treatment compared to 18.3% in the 
topotecan + paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm.

Post marketing experience 
The post–marketing experience with bevacizumab is collected on the basis of safety data contained in ten 
previously scheduled Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). The total number of patients exposed to 
bevacizumab in the post marketing setting from the International Birth Date (IBD) up to 9 January 2014 
is estimated to be approximately 1,558,181 patients across indications. 
The  majority  of  the  known  off-label  use  of  bevacizumab  involves  intravitreal  administration  for  the 
treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Safety concerns associated with this off-label use 
are  primarily  related  to  bevacizumab  injection  into  the  eye,  which  is  not  an  approved  method  of 
administration  for  this  product.  Systemic  events  have  also  been  observed  with  this  route  of 
administration. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse events by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy+bevacizumab 
There were more adverse events (AEs) in the chemotherapy+bevacizumab treatment arm, which is not 
unexpected. Conversely, there were more deaths in the chemotherapy alone treatment arm.  
The most common AEs were those related to chemotherapy in general, e.g. fatigue. However, there was 
an excess of hyperglycaemia, hypomagnesia, hyponatraemia, fatigue, epistaxis, decreased weight, 
infections, neutropenia, pain,  GI perforations (including perforations/fistulae to the vagina and anus) and 
hypertension in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab arm. There were one Grade 3 and one Grade 4 
hypomagnesaemia in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab group. In general, hypomagnesaemia were 
more common in the cisplatin arms. With regard to hyperglycaemia, there were 5 Grade 3 AEs in the 
chemotherapy alone group vs. 9 Grade 3 AEs in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab group. There was no 
Grade 4 or 5 AE. No meaningful difference can be detected between the cisplatin and topotecan arms. 
Hyperglycaemia is a well-known risk that is already reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
The frequency of fistula is considerable higher in study GOG-0240 than what has been observed in 
previous trials with bevacizumab.  When comparing chemotherapy (Chemo) alone versus chemotherapy 
+/- bevacizumab (Chemo +/- Bv), the incidences of GI perforation SMQ (excluding GI vaginal fistula) 
events were 0% vs. 3.2%, GI vaginal fistulae 0.9% vs. 8.3%, and non-GI vaginal, vesical, or female 
genital tract fistulae 1.4% vs. 1.8%. As currently reflected in the SmPC, patients may be at an increased 
risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation when treated with bevacizumab. Patients treated 
for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab are also at increased risk of 
gastrointestinal-vaginal fistulae (see SmPC sections 4.4. and 4.8).  
The only predictor is previous radiation therapy.  Prior radiation is a risk factor for the development of 
GI-vaginal fistulae and GI perforation and all patients who developed GI perforation or GI-vaginal fistulae 
had a history of prior pelvic radiation (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). The frequency of GI-vaginal 
fistulae in the group treated with chemotherapy + bevacizumab was higher in patients with recurrence 
within the field of prior radiation (16.7%) compared with patients with recurrence outside the field of prior 
radiation (3.6%). The corresponding frequencies in the control group receiving chemotherapy alone were 
1.1% vs. 0.8%, respectively. Recurrence of cancer within the field of prior radiation is an additional 
important risk factor for the development of GI-vaginal fistulae (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients 
who develop GI-vaginal fistulae may also have bowel obstructions and require surgical intervention as 
well as diverting ostomies (see SmPC section 4.8).  
There are more Grade 5 AEs in the chemo+bev arm, where some of the events are probably related to the 
treatment. However, the events are well-known are reflected in the current SmPC. Having the severity of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 62/68 
 
 
 
 
the disease in mind and that these events are well-known, well-characterised and often manageable, 
there is no reason for any major concern.   
More AESI occurred in the chemo + bev arm. There were more events of bleeding in the chemo + bev 
arm, but no clear pattern can be observed except for vaginal haemorrhage. Grade 3-5 bleeding reactions 
have been reported in up to 8.3% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and 
topotecan compared with up to 4.6% of patients treated with paclitaxel and topotecan (see section 4.8). 
More non-GI fistula were observed in the chemo+bev arm and none of the events were Grade 5 (see 
SmPC section 4.8).  
The most striking difference is seen with regard to gastrointestinal perforations, where 4 patients in the 
chemo + bev arm experienced Grade 5 AEs. The majority of the GI perforations were anal fistula. There 
were more VTEs in the chemo + bev arm, and it seems as if the risk of thromboembolic events is higher 
in the cis + pac + bev arm. Grade 3-5 venous thromboembolic events have been reported in up to 15.6% 
of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared with up to 
7.0% of patients treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated for persistent, recurrent, or 
metastatic cervical cancer with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin may be at 
increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (See SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Grade 3-5 infections were reported in up to 24% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination 
with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 13% of patients treated with paclitaxel and topotecan. 
Cellulitis, lymphopenia, proctalgia, back pain, pelvic pain and weight decreased were reported in higher 
frequencies in study GOG-0240 in the chemo + bevacizumab arm vs the chemo arm. Therefore, these 
have been included as adverse drug reactions in the SmPC with their respective frequencies. In addition, 
the frequencies of abdominal pain and fistula have been updated in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Adverse events by chemotherapy arm 
Looking at data by chemotherapy arm, there seems to be slightly more infections in the top + pac +/- bev 
group, which is expected, as infections and neutropenia are very common AEs in patients treated with 
topotecan. In the cis + pac +/- bev arm there seems to be more gastrointestinal disorder, hypokalaemia 
and vascular disorders. Again, this pattern is also recognisable.  
Only 5 of the Grade 5 AEs occurred in the top + pac + bev arm, while all 4 Grade 5 AEs in the cisplatin 
group were observed in the cis + pac + bev arm. In conclusion, topotecan seems to offers a valuable 
treatment option for patients that cannot be treated with cisplatin, e.g. due to acquired drug resistance 
making platinum-based therapies less effective or due to unacceptable AEs profile. 
The safety analysis by trial treatment revealed that there are slightly more SAEs and deaths in the in top 
+ pac + bev arm. However, on the other hand, there are more discontinuations in the cis + pac + bev 
arm. There seems to be more cases of gastrointestinal disorders, vascular disorders (primarily 
hypertension and thrombosis) and pain (pelvic pain) in the cis + pac + bev arm, while there are slightly 
more cases of infection in the top + pac + bev arm. The combination of cisplatin + paclitaxel and 
bevacizumab results in the increased risk of thromboembolic events (see above and SmPC section 4.8). 
There is an increased risk of infections, when bevacizumab is combined with topotecan+paclitaxel (see 
above and SmPC section 4.8). 
Overall, there were more deaths in the chemo alone arm and the majority of deaths were related to the 
disease. Exploratory analyses of non-PD related deaths ≤ 90 days and >90 days after the last dose of 
study treatment, showed no substantial differences in non-PD related deaths when looking at data by 
bevacizumab treatment, by chemotherapy backbone and by trial treatment. The numbers were in general 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 63/68 
 
 
 
 
low and prevent any reasonable conclusion, but there is no indication of any long-term differences in 
non-PD deaths.  
In the evaluation of data based on age and race, an increased number of deaths in non-white was 
observed, but the subgroup analysis of OS showed no significant difference between white and non-white. 
The proportion of non-PD related deaths and Grade 5 AEs were not higher in the non-white patients 
treated with bev+chemo compared to non-white patients treated with chemo alone. Furthermore, there 
seems to be some differences in baseline characteristics between white and non-white that could explain 
the difference: Non-white patients were more likely to be black and have PS=1, which both are indicative 
of a poorer prognosis. 
Finally, more patients in the chemo + bev discontinued treatment (18% vs 26%) compared to the chemo 
alone arm. However, the overall discontinuation rates are considered reasonable and acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the safety results of chemo + bevacizumab and chemo alone are as they can be expected. 
However, GI perforation (including vaginal fistulae), Grade ≥3 VTE and Grade ≥3 bleeding rates in 
patients treated with bevacizumab were higher than those observed in clinical trials of bevacizumab to 
date.  
Overall, the level of discontinuation is considered acceptable in all treatment arms, where the two 
topotecan arms perform better. The comparison of cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab and topotecan + 
paclitaxel + bevacizumab revealed some differences with regards to safety/AEs, but all were 
manageable. Thus, topotecan is considered an option for patients that cannot be treated with cisplatin.   
Based on the safety data from study GOG-0240, the following new adverse drug reactions have been 
included in section 4.8 of the SmPC: cellulitis, lymphopenia, back pain, pelvic pain, weight decreased, and 
proctalgia. In addition the frequencies of abdominal pain and fistula have been updated to very common 
and common respectively. 
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The RMP has been updated to reflect the new indication. No significant changes were made to the sections 
on safety concerns and pharmacovigilance plan. The routine risk minimisation measures have been 
updated to reflect the new warnings and safety data presented in the SmPC.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 17.0 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that due to the 
concerns identified with this application, the risk management plan cannot be agreed at this stage.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, the existing warnings with regard to gastrointestinal perforations, fistulae, venous 
thromboembolism and infections have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Study GOG-0240 showed that the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy resulted in a statistically and 
clinically relevant difference with regard to the primary endpoint of OS. The primary analysis showed a 
HR=0.74 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.94; p=0.0132), with a difference in median OS of 3.9 months (12.9 months vs. 
16.8 months) in favour of chemotherapy + bevacizumab (i.e. cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab and 
topotecan + paclitaxel + bevacizumab arms combined).  
The effect was confirmed by a similar difference in median PFS. The pooled PFS analysis showed a 
statistically significant increase in PFS with a HR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.81; log-rank p-value <0.0001) 
in patients treated with chemotherapy + bevacizumab. The observed improvement in the median time to 
progression or death was 2.3 months: 8.3 months in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab group versus 6.0 
months in the chemotherapy alone group. 
In the pooled analysis, ORR was significantly higher (p=0.0117) in the chemotherapy + bevacizumab 
group (45.4%) compared with the chemotherapy alone group (33.8%). 
In addition, HRQoL data did not indicate any major deterioration of QoL by adding bevacizumab to 
chemotherapy.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
PFS and ORR data were only based on non-blinded investigator assessments, but these endpoints were 
secondary. 
Release of the second interim analysis report by the DSMB to investigators and patients approximately 
8-9 months before the data cut-off date in December 2012 may have introduced an operational bias in 
the study, but there is no evidence to substantiate this concern. In this report, it was namely concluded 
that topotecan was not a superior substitute for cisplatin with paclitaxel chemotherapy by OS. 
It is noted that patients with squamous cell carcinoma seems to have a better effect of bevacizumab 
compared with patients with adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma. However, the subgroup 
analysis  was  exploratory  of  nature,  the  numbers  were  small  and  the  issue  of  multiplicity  was  not 
controlled in this setting. Therefore no conclusion can be drawn based on this date. In addition, the results 
of the OS subgroup analysis were in general consistent with the overall estimate.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Bevacizumab has a well-known safety profile, which includes hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing 
complications,  mucocutanous  bleeding,  ATEs,  VTEs,  GI-perforations  and  fistula.  These  adverse  drug 
reactions  were  also  observed  in  study  GOG-0240.  Overall,  there  were  more  AEs  in  the  chemo  + 
bevacizumab arm as expected. However, the majority of the AEs are manageable.  
There were more VTEs in the chemo + bevacizumab arm, and it seems as if the risk of thromboembolic 
events was higher in the cisplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm, while there were slightly more cases 
of  infections  in  the  topotecan  +  paclitaxel  +  bevacizumab  arm.  Also,  of  the  AEs  of  special  interest, 
bleeding  (≥grade  3),  gastrointestinal  perforations,  hypertension  (≥grade  3)  and  venous  thrombotic 
events  (grade  ≥3)    were  more  frequently  observed  in  the  cisplatin  +  paclitaxel  +  bevacizumab  and 
topotecan  +  paclitaxel  +  bevacizumab  arms,  compared  with  cisplatin  +  paclitaxel  and  topotecan  + 
paclitaxel arms. 
When comparing the two cisplatin containing regimens, the SAEs with a higher incidence (difference ≥ 
5%) in the bevacizumab arm were: thrombosis, infection, anal fistula and fatigue. 
For the two topotecan regimens, the SAEs with a higher incidence (difference ≥ 5%) in the bevacizumab 
arm arms were: fatigue, nausea, dehydration, and anal fistula.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
With regard to excess risk of death observed in non-white patient, the subgroup analysis of OS did not 
show any significant difference between white and non-white. There is considerable uncertainty related to 
these data and no conclusion can be made at this stage. In addition, there seems to be some differences 
in baseline characteristics between white and non-white that could explain the difference. 
There were more deaths in the chemo alone arm and the majority of deaths were related to the disease. 
Exploratory  analyses  of  non-PD  related  deaths  ≤  90  days  and  >90  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study 
treatment showed no substantial differences in non-PD related deaths. The numbers were in general low 
and prevent any reasonable conclusion, but there is no indication of any long-term differences in non-PD 
deaths. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In a patient population with persistent, recurrent or stage IVB disease,  which is associated with poor 
outcome, the treatment difference observed in terms of OS in the chemo + bevacizumab arm is clinically 
relevant and important. This finding is supported by sensitivity analysis and PFS data. 
In the chemo + bevacizumab arm no detrimental effect could be seen with regard to HRQoL, which is an 
important  aspect  to  consider  in  this  late-stage  disease,  where  current  treatment  options  could  be 
perceived as palliative.   
The  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  also  led  to  slightly  more  thromboembolic  events  and 
fistulae (vaginal), but these are not considered to outweigh the difference seen in median survival. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/205694/2015  
Page 66/68 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  based  on  the  results  form  study  GOG-0240  it  is  concluded  that  chemo  +  bevacizumab  is 
considered superior to chemotherapy alone, and the benefit-risk balance is positive. An improvement of 
OS with 3.9 months is important in this patient population which have not had such clinically significant 
result for almost a decade.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of 
patients with persistent, recurrent or stage IVB cervical cancer is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Patients with persistent, recurrent or stage IVB disease have a very poor outcome and treatment is often 
palliative. Chemotherapy, though essentially palliative, is usually recommended for these patients, and 
although the optimal regimen for chemotherapy has not been defined, cisplatin combination therapy is 
considered the standard of care. Results from a more recent study suggested that cisplatin plus paclitaxel 
was the preferred regimen in this setting and possibly superior to topotecan plus cisplatin combination in 
terms of OS, PFS and ORR (Monk et al. 2009; Cella et al. 2010). Based on these findings, the cisplatin plus 
paclitaxel combination is now considered as the preferred regimen in recent treatment guidelines (ESMO 
Clinical Practice Guideline, 2012), but there is still a clear need for more effective and better tolerable 
treatment options in this setting.  
In light of this, a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death of 26% (HR of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 
0.94) of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy with a corresponding improvement in median OS of 3.9 
months is considered clinically relevant. Open-label studies have their limitations, and with regard to PFS, 
where  there  was  no  independent  review  of  data,  the  importance  of  this  endpoint  is  considered  to  be 
limited and the results are only seen as supportive. However, there is no evidence of any operational bias 
with regard to the PFS data. The same can be claimed with regard to HRQoL, but most importantly no 
detrimental effect was observed. 
The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy leads to more thromboembolic events in the cisplatin + 
paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm and infections in the topotecan + paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm. 
Furthermore, GI perforation (including vaginal fistulae), Grade ≥3 VTE and Grade ≥3 bleeding rates in 
patients treated with bevacizumab were higher than those seen in clinical trials of bevacizumab to date. 
However, these events did not have a negative impact on OS and can be managed in the clinical setting.

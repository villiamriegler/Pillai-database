2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion 
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2021 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing tisagenlecleucel was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing that a high proportion of 
relapsed/refractory patients achieve durable complete responses; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.9 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, the 
sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing tisagenlecleucel will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data that demonstrate sustained complete responses in a 
high proportion of heavily pre-treated relapsed/refractory patients who have failed several 
approved therapies. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular 
center B cells consisting of a mixture of centrocytes (small to medium-sized cleaved cells) and 
centroblasts (large non-cleaved cells), mixed with non-malignant cells such as T-cells, follicular 
dendritic cells, and macrophages (Smith et al., 2013; Xerri et al., 2016). The WHO classification has 
adopted a grading from 1-3, where grade 3 has been subdivided into grade 3a, in which centrocytes 
are present, and grade 3b, in which there are sheets of centroblasts (Ott et al., 2002). The clinical 
aggressiveness of FL increases with increasing numbers of centroblasts, and subsequently grades. FL 
grade 1-3a comprises the most prevalent indolent (low-grade) lymphoma subtype of NHL. FL grade 3b 
is categorized with other FLs but is at an intermediate stage of large cell transformation and is typically 
treated as an aggressive (high-grade) lymphoma. 
The aetiology of FL is still poorly understood. It has been suggested that age, gender, and ethnicity 
may affect a person’s likelihood of developing FL. The incidence of the disease increases with age; 
although in principle FL may occur at any age, it is extremely rare in children and adolescents. The 
median age at diagnosis of FL is around 60-65 years. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000054173 
Page 4/17 
 
 
 
 
 
FL involves lymph nodes, but also spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and Waldeyer ring. 
Involvement of non-haematopoietic extra-nodal sites, such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or soft 
tissue are uncommon but may occur in a setting of widespread nodal disease. FL may occasionally be 
primary in extra-nodal sites, including skin, GI tract, particularly the duodenum, ocular adnexa, breast, 
and testis. 
Patients with FL generally present with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, with waxing and waning 
symptoms present for years. Only around 10% of the patients have localized disease at diagnosis and 
less than 20% present with B symptoms (fever, night sweats and weight loss) and elevated serum 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Most patients therefore have widespread disease at diagnosis, 
including peripheral and central (abdominal and thoracic) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The 
bone marrow is involved in 40-70% of the cases (Swerdlow et al., 2017; Freedman, 2020). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Kymriah is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy” falls within 
the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of follicular lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk (B/R) assessment of the 
CAT/CHMP (see EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Patients with advanced stage FL disease may experience B symptoms and suffer from unexplained 
fatigue/asthenia, local effects of lymphadenopathy such as abdominal pain, chest pain, cough or 
dyspnoea, or symptoms of bone marrow failure leading to cytopenia. Other symptoms depend on the 
location of the lymphoma (e.g., GI bleeding due to GI lymphomas, superior vena cava syndrome due 
to vein compression, renal failure due to ureter compression, and rarely spinal cord compression). 
Particularly patients with relapsed disease may have reduced quality of life. 
Although the life expectancy has improved due to recent therapeutic advances, FL patients frequently 
relapse and become progressively more refractory to subsequent lines of therapy. Advanced-stage FL 
is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy, although patients often have good responses 
to treatment and might live for many years. The survival outcome worsens significantly as the patients 
progress through multiple lines of therapy and most patients eventually die of progressive lymphoma 
and its complications (Link et al., 2019). Furthermore, histologic transformation to high-grade NHLs 
that are clinically more aggressive with a poor outcome is relatively common in patients with FL, 
occurring at a rate of approximately 2-3% per year (Kridel et al., 2016; Freedman, 2018). 
No changes have occurred in the chronically debilitating and life-threatening nature of the condition 
since the orphan designation. FL remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating, mainly due to 
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation into 
aggressive lymphoma. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has not provided an updated prevalence estimate indicating that the prevalence hasn’t 
changed since the orphan designation in 2021 and referred to the epidemiology report used then. 
In the epidemiology report, the sponsor discussed thoroughly both the limitations and strengths of the 
different methods used for the prevalence estimates which were presented. The prevalence of FL 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000054173 
Page 5/17 
 
 
 
 
 
ranged from 2.40 (10-year prevalence; Globocan 2020) to 4.92 (20-year partial prevalence; ECIS 
2020) per 10,000 for the limited-duration prevalence estimates, while the complete prevalence (ECIS 
2020; UK HMRN) was estimated to be 4.56 per 10,000 people. 
The sponsor stated in the epidemiological report that FL accounts for about 11-19% of all prevalent 
NHL cases in the 4 largest EU member states plus UK (EU4 [France, Germany, Italy, and Spain] and 
UK) and 20-25% in the US (Dulac et al., 2013). The sponsor further concluded that the maximum 
proportion of incident FL cases among all incident NHL cases in the European Community is 
approximately 20%. This proportion was obtained from the upper range of proportions of incident 
cases reported in the published literature, where the proportion of FL among all NHL ranged from 
16.3% in Italy (Luminari et al., 2007) to 21.9% in Sweden and France (Ekberg et al., 2020; Le 
Guyader-Peyrou et al., 2016). This proportion of FL within all NHL cases was then used for the indirect 
estimate of the complete prevalence. The assumption proposed by the sponsor on a FL proportion of 
20% among all NHL cases in the European Community could be considered acceptable based on 
current knowledge of the COMP. 
They also discussed the observed variability of median survival time reported for FL in population-
based studies conducted in various European countries and regions. The sponsor acknowledged that 
the OS of patients with FL has improved over the last 25 years and suggested that the improvement 
may be a result of the sequential application of effective therapies, including rituximab, and better 
supportive care (Anderson et al., 1998; Karmali et al., 2018; Salles, 2007; Tan et al., 2013). The 
reported median OS in the literature studied ranged from around 6 years to 13 years (Dandoit et al., 
2015; Krol et al., 2003). In another study conducted in selected Spanish hospitals, the median OS for 
FL was approximately 19 years (Provencio et al., 2017). The latter source, which reported survival of 
FL patients in a Spanish population, reflects survival of FL from a more recent period from 1980-2013 
and is considered more contemporary than some of the other sources found. However, the patient 
population included in this study had only FL grades 1-3a since patients with grade 3b were excluded. 
In addition, these patients appeared to be rather young with a mean age at diagnosis of 58 years. 
Consequently, the median OS of 19.25 years reported in this study could be considered to represent 
the upper range of the survival for FL patients in the European population. 
The sponsor did not consider any of the proposed prevalence estimates to be more accurate than the 
others for the current prevalence of FL in Europe. Instead, the sponsor highlighted that the different 
nature of the supplementary information used for the calculations, despite use of the same starting 
information, may contribute to the differences in the estimates presented, contrary to what would be 
expected if the prevalence estimates were calculated using information from only one source and by 
use of identical methods. This argument was supported. 
Although both the complete and the 20-year prevalence estimates presented for FL are close to the 
established orphan designation threshold, the estimates are still below the upper limit of 5 cases per 
10,000 people. Hence, based on the data provided, the COMP accepted that the condition currently is 
not affecting more than 5 in 10,000 people in the European Community. 
The COMP concluded that the upper conservative estimate of approximately 4.9 per 10,000 people in 
the European community remains acceptable.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor provided a list of medicinal products approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with 
relapsed FL and their approved therapeutic indications. Several therapies are authorised both centrally 
and nationally in the EU for treatment of adult patients with FL, NHL, and lymphomas. These medicines 
include rituximab (MabThera), obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), idelalisib (Zydelig), 
duvelisib (Copiktra), yttrium-90 [90Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), pixantrone 
(Pixuvri), bendamustine chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, 
interferon-alpha-2a/b, prednisolone, and vincristine. Other treatment options also exist, such as 
radiotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or allogenic SCT. 
Patients with newly diagnosed FL are generally treated with an anti-CD20 antibody in monotherapy, 
rituximab (R) or obinutuzumab (G), or an anti-CD20-containing regimen (e.g., G/R-B, G/R-CHOP, and 
G/R-CVP). Available treatment options for relapsed or refractory (r/r) FL patients depends on the 
patient’s health, age, stage of disease and the duration of response to prior therapy. The most recent 
ESMO guidelines for newly diagnosed and relapsed FL describe the current standard of care (SOC) for 
these patients (Dreyling, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 298-308). According to the guidelines, therapy 
should be initiated only upon the development of symptoms. The clinical treatment guideline identifies 
two types of FL populations that are offered two different treatment algorithms depending on their 
tumour burden, being either low (Figure 1) or high (Figure 3).

The disease lacks curative options, and although treatments are available, most patients eventually 
relapse or become refractory to their treatment. 
This indication extension of Kymriah is intended to include treatment of adult patients with r/r FL after 
two or more lines of systemic therapy. An overview of medicinal products authorised for the treatment 
of relapsed FL in the EU and whether they are considered satisfactory methods of treatment relevant 
for a discussion on the significant benefit of tisagenlecleucel (hereinafter referred to as tisa-cel) in FL is 
presented in the table below.

* Patients with histological grade 3b FL were excluded from the pivotal study for the indication extension of Kymriah 
to FL (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0044). Since grade 3b FL biologically is more closely related to DLBCL 
than to the other forms of FL, these patients are often treated as an aggressive lymphoma such as DLBCL, for 
which Kymriah is already indicated. The CAT/CHMP therefore concluded during the assessment of the type II 
variation that the product should be intended for FL without any grade-relevant restrictions, since an extrapolation 
of the positive B/R balance of Kymriah observed in the studied FL grade 1-3a and DLBCL populations to patients 
with FL grade 3b can be considered acceptable. The label of Kymriah is thus for all grades of FL. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor is targeting a patient population for which treatment options exist but for which they 
consider that their product will be of significant benefit. Thesponsor did not seek protocol assistance to 
agree on the approach for the justification of significant benefit. 
The primary data supporting the efficacy of tisa-cel in the proposed extension of indication to include 
treatment of adult patients with r/r FL are obtained from an ongoing (but not recruiting), open-label, 
multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study CTL019E2202 (ELARA; hereafter referred to as study E2202). 
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tisa-cel in adults with r/r FL. Eligible 
patients (≥18 years) had r/r FL grade 1-3a after at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including an anti-
CD20-directed therapy and an alkylating agent, or had failed prior ASCT. Patients with histological 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

grade 3b FL were excluded from the study. Tisa-cel was administered as a single IV infusion with a 
recommended dose range of 0.6-6.0×108 anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)+ T-cells. 
The primary endpoint of study E2202 is complete response rate (CRR) as assessed by central review 
per Lugano 2014 classification response criteria (Cheson, J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32(27): 3059-68). The 
analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted based on the efficacy analysis set (EAS), which 
contained all patients who have received tisa-cel and had measurable disease at baseline per IRC. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and 
progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review committee (IRC), overall survival (OS), and 
patient reported outcomes (PROs). Data were reported from an extended follow-up analysis with a 
data cut-off (DCO) date of 03-aug-2021. 
The sponsor argued that data from the pivotal study (N=98/97 for the ITT/mITT) demonstrated a 
remarkably higher CRR and ORR with tisa-cel compared to non-CAR-T cell therapies currently indicated 
for treatment of r/r FL patients in the third- or later line setting. The sponsor provided real-world data 
(RWD) from the ReCORD and Flatiron databases to contextualise the clinical outcomes in study E2202. 
The efficacy of a single tisa-cel infusion was observed with a CRR of 69.1% (95% CI: 58.9, 78.1) in the 
infused patients with FL grade 1-3a compared to a reported CRR value within the range of 1-38% for 
existing methods of treatment for the target patient population. The median DOR was not reached in 
study E2202 at the last DCO, supporting a sustained response in the treated FL patients. The 
estimated probability of remaining in response for 9 months was 87.0% (95% CI: 75.6, 93.3) for 
patients who achieved a best response of CR and 76.2% (95% CI: 64.9, 84.3) for all responding 
patients. The sponsor thinks that this compares favourably to the 18-30% they report from currently 
approved therapies specifically indicated in the third- or later line setting. Moreover, subgroup analyses 
showed that the CRRs to tisa-cel in various demographic and prognostic subgroups were consistent 
with that observed in the overall study population, including groups of high-risk FL patients such as 
those who experienced disease progression within 24 months from the start of front-line systemic 
therapy (36/61; 59.0% [95% CI: 45.7, 71.4]), those who were double-refractory to 2 lines of 
therapies (43/65; 66.2% [53.4, 77.4]), and patients with a high FLIPI score (36/57; 63.2% [95% CI: 
49.3, 75.6]). The CRR values ranged from 40.0% to 87.9% in all subgroups analysed. 
Two indirect comparisons using individual patients-level data from ReCORD (N=143/99) and Flatiron 
(N=98/88) were conducted to provide comparative, contextual evidence to the clinical efficacy of tisa-
cel reported from study E2202 based on the current SOC. The data collection period in Flatiron and for 
a subgroup analysis of the ReCORD data was from 2014-2020 to match with the introduction of the 
new Lugano response criteria as well as the EU approval of Zydelig (idelalisib). The results from the 
indirect comparisons of the effectiveness as reported in the two RWD sources on patients with r/r FL 
compared to the efficacy as reported in study E2202 is presented in the table below.

The interpretation of the RWD was complicated by the fact that it was not possible to fully emulate the 
inclusion criteria in the pivotal study E2202. The patient populations were therefore similar but not 
identical. Important prognostic values were lacking and could not be adjusted for in the analyses. 
Response assessments were also lacking in the RWD sets, necessitating changes to the endpoint 
definition (ReCORD), or further exclusion of patient that otherwise would qualify (Flatiron). This results 
in considerable uncertainty when used to contextualise the efficacy data. However, although the 
validity of the endpoint assessment for response in the retrospective analysis of electronic health 
records could not be verified, the observed large difference to tisagenlecleucel was reassuring. The 
RWE presented therefore suggested a clinically meaningful benefit for patients with r/r FL treated with 
tisa-cel juxtaposed to existing SOC regimens used in the third- and later lines setting. 
The sponsor concluded that the data from study E2202 and the supportive data sets were sufficient to 
demonstrate a significant benefit of tisa-cel based on improved efficacy over currently available non-
CAR-T cell therapies for the treatment of adult patients with r/r FL after two or more lines of therapy. 
It is agreed that the data provided indicate an improvement in CRR and ORR in patients treated with 
tisa-cel compared to the reported outcomes for all the SOC regimens investigated in the two RWD sets 
for the treatment of r/r FL in the third- and later lines setting. 
Indirect comparison to Zevalin 
Zevalin (ibritumomab tiuxetan) is a murine anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is conjugated 
to the radioisotope yttrium-90. Data from clinical trials and RWD were submitted by the sponsor to 
contextualize the claim for significant benefit based on improved efficacy of Kymriah over Zevalin in 
the third- and later lines setting for the target FL population. The sponsor emphasised that only data in 
the EU approved indication for the treatment of patients with r/r FL, including patients with rituximab-
refractory FL were considered relevant for contextualizing the benefit of Kymriah over Zevalin. 
Six clinical trials (106-01 to 106-06) and a pooled analysis based on four clinical trials of Zevalin were 
identified as potentially useful clinical evidence (Zevalin Scientific discussion 2006; Emmanouilides et 
al., 2009). Information on the six trials and pooled analysis with Zevalin are summarized in Table 2.

The rational for selecting the relevant available clinical data from Zevalin relative to Kymriah from 
study E2202 for assessing efficacy was based on the following key criteria: 
• 
• 
Third- and later lines FL (number of prior regimens to be similar to study E2202). In study E2202, 
the median number of previous regimens is 4 (range: 2-13). 
Previous exposure to anti-CD20 mAb and most of the studied patients needed to be refractory to 
anti-CD20 mAb. In study E2202, 100% of the patients had prior exposure to anti-CD20 mAb and 
87% of the patients were refractory to anti-CD20 mAb. 
After the assessment of patient population and data availability from the six Zevalin trials and the 
pooled analysis, study 106-06 (Witzig et al., 2002a) was deemed the most relevant trial to 
contextualize the benefit between Kymriah to Zevalin. The validity of this cross-trial comparison is 
considered highly uncertain in view of the large differences in SOC and response criteria between the 
two study periods. 
The baseline characteristics of the two clinical studies E2202 and 106-06 are provided in Table 3. In 
general, the study populations from these two studies are similar though the patients in study E2202 
were likely with poorer diagnosis based on FLIPI score, bulky disease, and extra-nodal disease sites.

The efficacy outcomes of these two studies E2202 and 106-06 are shown in Table 3. The primary 
efficacy endpoint of study E2202 is CRR. Based on the results reported from study E2202 at a median 
follow up of 21 months (DCO: 03-aug-2021), the CRR of Kymriah was substantially higher (> 4 times 
higher) than that reported for Zevalin in study 106-06 and the lower bound of the 95% CI for CRR of

tisa-cel (58%) was more than two times higher than the upper bound of the 95% CI for Zevalin 
(27%). The lower bound of the 95% CI for ORR of tisa-cel (77%) was also higher than the ORR of 
Zevalin (74%). In addition, the response associated with Kymriah was more durable than Zevalin as 
measured by DOR (median 6.4 months for Zevalin and not reached for tisa-cel after 12 months of 
minimum follow-up for all patients). Higher and more durable responses were also noted in improved 
PFS estimates with tisa-cel (median 6.8 months for Zevalin and 30.7 months for tisa-cel).

Real-world evidence 
The RWE of Zevalin in the third- and later lines setting for the target FL population was limited. This 
may reflect the limited use of Zevalin in this patient population. Two RWD data sources were 
consulted, specifically Record-FL (Europe) and Flatiron (US). The results are summarized below: 
Data from Record-FL 
A total of 12 patients out of 187 patients in ReCORD (sites in mainly EU) had been identified as having 
received Zevalin either as single agent or in combination with other medicinal products in the third- or 
later lines of therapy. Of them, 5 patients received Zevalin in monotherapy: 3 in the 3rd line (with 1 
CR and 2 partial responses [PRs] achieved as best overall response), 1 patient in the 4th line (with 
progressive disease [PD]), and 1 patient in 5th line treatment (with PR). 
Data from Flatiron 
A total of 2 patients out of 98 patients in Flatiron (all US patients) were identified, both receiving 
Zevalin as 3rd line therapy. Both patients were PDs. 
Real-world data in literature 
The literature of RWD for Zevalin in the third- and later lines FL patients who had rituximab-refractory 
disease is limited. For example: 
• 
• 
Jurczak and colleagues (2007) reported real-world experience of Zevalin in 12 r/r FL patients (>2 
lines of treatment with prior rituximab exposure) from three Poland centers. 
Tsukamoto and colleagues (2018) reported real-world experience of Zevalin in 8 r/r FL patients 
(>2 lines of treatment) from Gunma University Hospital. No information on prior rituximab 
exposure was reported. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000054173 
Page 15/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Leahy and Turner (2011) reported a single-institution experience of Zevalin in Australia. Out of 142 
patients, 66% (94/142) with FL, 46% (65/142) with 2 or more prior therapies, and 56% (80/142) 
with prior rituximab exposure (no information on rituximab-refractory status). However, no data of 
baseline characteristics and efficacy outcome were reported for the target FL population (r/r FL in 
3rd line or more with rituximab exposure). Study reported worse outcomes for later line patients 
(4th line versus earlier line: CR+CRu 33% vs. 45-55%) and patients with rituximab exposure (with 
exposure versus no exposure: CR+CRu 38% vs. 67%). 
As the sample sizes were small and information on baseline characteristics were limited in these RWD 
studies, the results were considered unlikely to provide meaningful information to contextualize the 
effectiveness of Kymriah over Zevalin. 
The sponsor concluded that the overall clinical evidence available strongly supports significant benefit 
based on improved efficacy of Kymriah over Zevalin in the third- and later lines setting for the target 
r/r FL population. The COMP concluded that they could recommend the maintenance of the orphan 
designation.

4.  COMP position adopted on 13 April 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of follicular lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.9 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Kymriah may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has provided clinical data which 
demonstrated compelling complete response rates of Kymriah compared to Zevalin in patients with 
relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma in the third- and later lines setting who had previously 
been treated with anti-CD20-directed therapy  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kymriah, tisagenlecleucel for 
treatment of Follicular lymphoma (EU/3/21/2464) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

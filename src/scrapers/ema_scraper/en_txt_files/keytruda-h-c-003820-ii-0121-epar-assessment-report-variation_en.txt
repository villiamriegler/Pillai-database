2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world, with an estimated global incidence 
of 2.2 million in 2020 and an associated 1.8 million deaths. In Europe, age standardized incidence 
rates (per 100.000) vary between 33.3 - 49 in male, and between 11.6 - 26.8 in female, while age 
standardized mortality rates vary between 26.9 – 32.7 in male, and between 20.1 - 23.8 in female.1 
NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers, the most common histological subtypes 
being adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma2.  
At the time of diagnosis, approximately 19% of patients with NSCLC have localized disease (Stage I), 
22% have locally advanced or regional disease (Stages II and III), and 55% have metastatic disease 
(Stage IV). Stage is a main prognostic factor. According to stage, 5-years relative survival ranges 
between 61.2% in localized, 33.5% in regional, and 7% in distant disease 3. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH’s sought indication is: “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of 
adults with Stage IB (T2a ≥ 4 cm), II or IIIA non-small cell lung carcinoma who have undergone 
complete resection.” 
Risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Global statistics estimate that 15% of lung cancers in men and 53% in women are not attributable to 
smoking. To date, there are no specific recommendation for screening for lung cancer.4 
Biologic features 
Molecular characteristics 
Histological diagnosis of NSCLC is crucial to many treatment decisions and should be as exact and 
detailed as the samples and available technology allow. After morphological diagnosis, the next 
consideration is therapy-predictive biomarker testing. Several molecular drivers for oncogene addiction 
represent strong predictive biomarkers and excellent therapeutic targets. They are generally mutually 
exclusive of each other. The vast majority of oncogene-addicted lung cancers are adenocarcinomas.

Patients, in general, tend to be younger, female gender and East Asian ethnicity. To date, relevant 
biomarkers for NSCLC are EGFR mutations, rearrangements involving the ALK and ROS1 genes, BRAF 
V600E mutations, NTRK1 fusion, HER2 and MET exon 14 mutations and fusion genes involving RET5. 
To date, the only approved targeted treatment in the EU in the adjuvant setting is osimertinib (see 
section “management” below).   
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Update to AJCC Staging Guidelines 
Study KEYNOTE-091 was initiated in 2015. The study enrolled participants who had Stages IB (T2a≥4 
cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC under the AJCC 7th edition. The tumour stage was also used as a stratification 
factor. During the conduct of the study in January 2017, a major update to staging guidelines was 
provided with the release of the 8th edition of the UICC/IASLC and was implemented clinically in 
January 2018. In order to maintain consistency in participant eligibility and stratification, use of the 
AJCC 7th edition staging system was continued throughout the study. 
The key feature of this update was changes in determination of the T (primary tumour) component of 
the staging system, which led to migration in certain overall stages6. For example, some participants 
enrolled in KEYNOTE-091 with Stage IB (T2a>4 cm) in the 7th edition would be considered to have 
Stage IIA (T2b) in 8th edition. Participants with Stage IB (T2a =4 cm) in the 7th edition would remain 
Stage IB (T2a) in the 8th edition. Additionally, some participants with Stage IIIA [T (2–3) N2] under 
the 7th edition would become Stage IIIB [T (3-4) N2] under the 8th edition.  
In summary, KEYNOTE-091 enrolled participants with Stages IB (T2a ≥ 4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC under 
the AJCC 7th edition. This is equivalent to Stage IB (T2a = 4 cm) through IIIB [(T3-4 (>7cm), N2] 
under the AJCC 8th edition.

Management 
In early-stage NSCLC, both prognosis and the treatment strategy, particularly with regards to surgical 
intervention and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, are dependent on disease stage 7. The cornerstone 
of treatment of potentially resectable lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumour, which includes 
lobectomy, pneumonectomy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection/sampling depending on the extent 
of the disease and the cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient6, 8. The management of lymph nodes 
during surgery is mainly dictated by the staging requirements for guaranteed “R0 resection” status6. 
For those who are not willing to accept the risks, or are at very high risk, curative RT should be 
offered, either SABR or hypofractionated high-dose RT6. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy with up to 4 cycles of a platinum-based doublet has been utilized to reduce 
the risk of disease recurrence. The most frequently studied regimen is cisplatin–vinorelbine. According 
to ESMO guidelines, adjuvant ChT should be offered to patients with resected stage II and III NSCLC 
and can be considered in patients with resected stage IB disease and a primary tumour > 4 cm. Pre-
existing comorbidity, time from surgery and postoperative recovery need to be taken into account in 
this decision taken in a multidisciplinary tumour board6. Meta-analyses have shown an absolute OS 
and DFS benefit at 5 years of approximately 5% with adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC 9. 
ESMO guidelines underline that in view of the equivalence of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy 
for OS, the consistent results and broad evidence base support adjuvant chemotherapy as the timing 
of choice6. 
For patients with actionable EGFR tumour mutations, results from the Phase 3 ADAURA study showed 
that osimertinib improved DFS in patients with Stage IB-IIIA (AJCC 7th ed) NSCLC as compared to 
placebo10. In the EU, Tagrisso was approved in May 2021 for the adjuvant treatment after complete 
tumour resection in adult patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC whose tumours have EGFR exon 19 
deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations13. The subsequent final analysis of ADAURA study, 
at median follow-up of about 60 months, demonstrated also statistical significant improvement in OS: 
in patients with stage II to IIIA disease, the 5-year OS was 85% (95% CI, 79 to 89) in the osimertinib 
group and 73% (95% CI, 66 to 78) in the placebo group (overall HR 0.49; 95.03% CI, 0.33 to 0.73; 
P<0.001). In the overall population (stage IB to IIIA disease) the 5-year OS was 88% (95% CI, 83 to 
91) in the osimertinib group and 78% (95% CI, 73 to 82) in the placebo group (overall HR for death, 
0.49; 95.03% CI, 0.34 to 0.70; P<0.001) 11. 
Checkpoint inhibitors have proven clinical benefits in advanced lung cancer. A recent study 
IMpower010 evaluating the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (every 3 weeks for 16 cycles) 
demonstrated improvement in DFS compared with best supportive care when given as adjuvant 
therapy following surgery and chemotherapy in participants with Stage II-IIIA (AJCC 7th ed) NSCLC12. 
At data cutoff of 21 January 2021, median follow-up was 32.2 months in the ITT population. In 
hierarchical testing, atezolizumab showed statistically significant DFS benefit vs BSC in the PD-L1 TC 
≥1% (SP263 assay) Stage II-IIIA (median DFS not reached versus 35.3 months, HR 0.66, 95% CI 
0.50-0.88, p=0.0039) and in all randomized Stage II-IIIA populations (median DFS 42.3 versus 35.3

months, (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.96, p=0.0205); on the contrary the significance boundary was not 
crossed for DFS in the ITT population that included stage IB (≥4 cm) disease (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-
0.99, p=0.04)14, 13. OS data were immature and not formally tested. IMpower010 study did not show a 
consistent benefit in DFS by PD-L1 subgroups: PD-L1 TC <1% (HR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.31) (about 
45% of the population), 1-49% (HR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.26), PD-L1 TC≥50% (HR 0.43; 95%CI: 
0·27–0·68)14. In the EU, Tecentriq was approved in June 2022 for patients whose tumours express PD-
L1 TC ≥50%, with the following indication: “Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated as adjuvant 
treatment following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with 
NSCLC with a high risk of recurrence whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on ≥ 50% of tumour cells 
(TC) and who do not have EGFR mutant or ALK
positive NSCLC (see section 5.1 for selection criteria)” 
14. Recent updated data from IMpower010 showed improved OS for adjuvant atezolizumab with HR of 
0.43 in the PD-L1 TC ≥50%15 
-
The immune-checkpoint inhibitors were also explored in the neoadjuvant NSCLC setting. In the open-
label, phase 3 CheckMate 816 trial, patients with stage IB (≥4cm) to IIIA (AJCC 7th ed) resectable 
NSCLC were randomized to receive nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy or platinum-based 
chemotherapy alone, followed by resection. The primary end points were event-free survival and 
pathological complete response by blinded independent review. At the prespecified interim analysis 1 
of (minimum follow-up, 21 months; median follow-up, 29.5 months) the median EFS was 31.6 months 
(95%CI, 30.2 to NR) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.0 to 26.7) with 
chemotherapy alone (HR 0.63; 97.38% CI, 0.43 to 0.91; P=0.005). The percentage of patients with a 
pathological complete response at the final analysis for pCR was 24% (95% CI, 18 to 31) and 2.2% 
(95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6), respectively. 16 Based on this study, Opdivo in combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapy was approved in the EU in June 2023 for the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable 
NSCLC at high risk of recurrence in adult patients whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥1%17. 
In addition, the strategy including both neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment (i.e. perioperative) 
regimens for early-stage NSCLC with anti-PD(L)1 drugs is currently under investigation, although none 
is approved to date. KEYNOTE-671 study evaluated, in 786 participants with resectable stage II, IIIA, 
or IIIB (N2 stage) NSCLC, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo plus 4 cycles of cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 13 cycles. The 
first IA, with a median follow-up of 25.2 months, showed statistically significant improvement in EFS 
(HR for progression, recurrence, or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.72; P<0.001; EFS at 24 months 
62.4% vs 40.6%). A major pathological response occurred in 30.2% vs 11% and a pathological 
complete response occurred in 18.1% and 4% of patients in the experimental vs control arm, 
respectively18. The double-blind phase III study AEGEAN assessing neoadjuvant durvalumab + 
chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant durvalumab in patients with resectable NSCLC (stage 
II-IIIB[N2]; AJCC 8th ed) was reported to have met its primary endpoints of pCR (17.2% vs 4.3%)

after a median EFS follow-up of 11.7 months19. 
An unmet need for introducing tolerable treatments in earlier stages of disease in order to provide the 
best chance of survival by decreasing the risk of recurrence is recognised.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is humanized mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction 
between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This blockade enhances functional activity of the 
target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and, ultimately, immune rejection. The antibody 
potentiates existing immune responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not nonspecifically 
activate T cells. 
Keytruda was granted first approval by the European Commission on 17-JUL-2015 for patients with 
advanced melanoma. At the time of submission, in the EU, Keytruda is currently approved as 
monotherapy and in combination with other agents in adults in several tumor types: melanoma, 
NSCLC, HNSCC, TNBC, RCC, cHL, urothelial carcinoma, esophageal cancer, gastric or gastro-
oesophageal junction adnocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, MSI-H selected tumor types (colorectal 
cancer, gastric, biliary and small intestine cancer). In the pediatric setting, it is approved in 3 years 
and older cHL and in 12 years and older melanoma. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
EU CHMP scientific advice was obtained on the clinical development program for adjuvant NSCLC 
(EMEA/H/SA/2437/7/2014/II). The CHMP generally agreed to the overall study design for study 
KEYNOTE-091, patient population, DFS as primary endpoint, and the choice of placebo as a 
comparator.  
The patient population was considered rather heterogeneous, and subgroup analyses according to 
stratification/minimisation factors are expected. The impact on the final indication of any potential 
contrasting results will be a matter of assessment at time of evaluation. This is true not only for PD-L1 
expression levels (a factor already taken into account for the main statistical analysis), but for other 
important factors (e.g. stage, histology, nature of background adjuvant treatment). 
The CHMP suggested a minimum enrolment for each subgroup to at least allow meaningful analysis of 
trends. In this respect, a larger study with more stringent hypotheses should be considered. The CHMP 
also noted that study maturity will progress differently across prognostic subgroups. Further, the 
Applicant was advised to consider limiting the number of patients with stage IB disease (A cap of 35% 
to stage IB subgroup was implemented).   
According to the CHMP, taking into account the size of the planned study and the significant number of 
patients harbouring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements expected, the Applicant should consider 
genotyping the tumours of all patients to enable future exploratory analysis in different specific 
subgroups of patients defined by these aberrations (this was not implemented). 
The CHMP commented that the second interim analysis (for efficacy) may limit the feasibility of a final 
powerful analysis if enrolment is not achieved, which conditions the acceptability of this interim 
analysis. Study maturity will progress differently across prognostic subgroups. This is true for the

interim efficacy analysis with an overrepresentation of patients with early progressive disease and 
limited relevance in patients with relatively late progression and good prognosis. For the final analysis, 
any conclusion on cure rates that could be obtained by discussion on the terminal plateau should 
incorporate all subgroups, including those with less mature observation. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Keytruda is a protein and is therefore exempt from the ERA requirements. This is compliant with the 
current Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pembrolizumab PK disposition has been characterized via pooled population PK analyses using serum 
concentration-time data contributed from subjects across various clinical studies using a time-
dependent PK (TDPK) model. The PK reference dataset for monotherapy includes all available PK data 
from subjects enrolled on KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, and KEYNOTE-
024, with an overall sample size of 2993. This serves as the PK reference analysis to support 
descriptions of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in the EU SmPC. 
Within this Application, the MAH proposes an extension of indication for “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy 
for the adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage IB (T2a≥4 cm), II, or IIIA non-small cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) who have undergone complete resection.” 
The focus of the clinical pharmacology data submitted with this application is on the integrated 
immunogenicity assessment from studies KEYNOTE-054 and KEYNOTE-091, to characterize the 
immunogenicity profile of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting in patients with completely resected 
lymph node-positive stage III melanoma or completely resected stages IB, II, or IIIA NSCLC, 
respectively. 
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (6.0 L; coefficient of variation [CV]: 20%). As expected for an antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); 
this decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) 
for the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic data submitted within this EoI 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy in the non-adjuvant 
setting is based on a sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low 
observed rates of total treatment ADA across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) as well 
as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or 
safety. The low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumour type and no 
clinically meaningful consequences have been observed in the subjects with a positive immunogenicity 
reading.  
The incidence of ADA has not been impacted by the presence of another small molecule or 
chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023

However, as immunogenicity has not been characterized in the adjuvant setting, it was agreed to 
assess the immunogenicity of pembrolizumab in this setting in studies KEYNOTE-054 (most recent ADA 
sample of 2 October 2017) and KEYNOTE-091 (most recent ADA sample of 2 June 2021). 
KEYNOTE-054 / EORTC-1325-MG is a phase 3 trial with pembrolizumab monotherapy administration 
(MK-3475, 200 mg Q3W) as adjuvant treatment in participants with completely resected lymph node-
positive stage III melanoma. KEYNOTE-091/EORTC-1416-LCG is a phase 3 trial with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy administration (MK-3475, 200 mg Q3W) as adjuvant treatment in participants with 
completely resected stages IB, II, or IIIA NSCLC. 
IMMUNOGENICITY DATA and EVALUATION 
ADA samples were available from 1067 participants. A subset of the participants was not assessable 
for drug induced immunogenicity analysis, because only a pre-treatment ADA sample was available 
(N=10). The remaining 1057 participants were assessable for drug-induced immunogenicity analysis. 
An overview of the participants included in the analysis is summarized in Table 1. 
Table 1: Overview of participants included in the immunogenicity analysis after pembrolizumab 
adjuvant treatment (200 mg pembrolizumab Q3W) in participants with completely resected lymph 
node-positive stage III melanoma (KEYNOTE-054/ EORTC-1325-MG) or completely resected early stage 
NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091/EORTC-1416-LCG) 
The overall immunogenicity was defined as the proportion of treatment emergent positive participants 
to the total number of evaluable participants (treatment emergent positive, non-treatment emergent 
positive and negative immunogenicity status). 
Table 2 presents an overview of the immunogenicity status of all assessable participants:

(KEYNOTE-054/ EORTC-1325-MG) or completely resected early stage NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091/EORTC-
1416-LCG) 
Out of the 1057 participants included in the immunogenicity assessment, 4 participants were 
inconclusive, resulting in 1053 evaluable participants. The observed incidence of treatment emergent 
ADA in evaluable participants with completely resected lymph-node positive stage III melanoma or 
completely resected early-stage NSCLC and completion of standard adjuvant therapy is 2.8% (30 out 
of 1053), based on 30 participants with treatment emergent positive status, 12 participants with non-
treatment emergent positive status and 1011 with negative immunogenicity status.  
None of the 30 treatment-emergent positive participants had antibodies with neutralizing capacity. 
IMPACT OF ANTI-DRUG ANTIBODIES ON EXPOSURE 
The effect of ADA on pembrolizumab levels, for the participants with ADA positive samples, is 
compared with the participants treated with the same regimen that only have ADA negative samples. 
For the ADA positive participants, the pembrolizumab exposure was comparable with the exposures 
observed for the negative participants treated with the same regimen [Figure 1] and [Figure 2].

Bioanalytical methods 
KEYNOTE-091 bioanalytical report for ADA and nAB 
The samples were assayed for anti-pembrolizumab antibodies presence using a validated 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay on the Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. 
Bioanalysis of pembrolizumab ADA was carried out using the standard 3-tiered assay approach that 
consisted of screening (Tier 1), confirmation (Tier 2) and antibody titer assessment (Tier 3). Only Tier 
2 confirmed ADA positive samples were moved to Tier 3 and reported with a titer value and a 
neutralizing antibody (nAB) result. 
The DTL for the ADA assay, executed at the vendor PPD, is 124 µg/mL. 
ADA: Human serum samples were analysed for the presence of MK-3475 antibodies in support of 
Protocol Number MK-3475-091. This interim report covers the analysis of samples received through 22 
September 2021 and analysed in runs 1RFWC through 142RFWC. 
Five thousand eight hundred seventy-four (5874) original and six thousand thirty-six (6036) replicate 
human serum samples were received frozen and in good condition. Project samples were analysed 
according to the bioanalytical plan and Method ICDIM 201 V 1.01, entitled “An

which was validated under Project Code “RCZO2.” 
Analysis of human serum samples began on 27 September 2016 and was completed on 22 December 
2021. Sample results for 2821 samples were provided. Forty-eight samples screened potentially 
positive for anti-MK-3475 antibodies. Twenty-four out of the 48 samples that screened potentially 
positive for anti-MK-3475 antibodies were confirmed positive.  
Reassayed samples for this project were provided and listed with reasons for reanalysis. All sample 
analysis runs conducted for this study were showed. Data for the positive and negative controls used 
for run acceptance and data for the confirmatory positive controls used for run acceptance were also 
provided. 
nAB: Human serum samples were analysed to detect anti-MK-3475 neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in 
support of Protocol Number MK-3475-091. This interim report covers sample analysis through 06 
January 2022. The samples were analysed in runs 1RFWD through 10RFWD. 
Five thousand eight hundred seventy-four (5874) original and six thousand thirty-six (6036) replicate 
human serum samples were received frozen and in good condition between 17 February 2016 and 22 
September 2021. These samples were first tested in the electrochemiluminescent immunoassay for the 
detection of anti-MK-3475 antibodies. All samples from project RFWC which confirmed positive in the 
ADA immunoassay were analysed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Sample analysis was 
conducted under Project Code “RFWD” using Method ICDIM 202 V 2.01, entitled “An ECL Method for 
the Detection of Anti-MK-3475 Neutralizing Antibodies in Human Serum,” which was validated under 
Project Code “RFRI2.” During the course of analysis, the method was manually modified to give the 
ability to use the Avidien for reagent transfers, effective 09 December 2021. 
Analysis of human serum samples took place in ten runs beginning on 18 December 2018 and ending 
on 06 January 2022. The submitted report contains NAb results from a total of 24 ADA-positive 
samples. Four samples were positive for the presence of anti-MK-3475 neutralizing antibodies. Sample 
analysis runs sample results and data for positive and negative controls used for run acceptance were 
provided. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  immunogenicity  profile  of  pembrolizumab  was  previously  not  well  characterized  in  the  adjuvant 
setting.  The  MAH  has  provided  a  comprehensive  immunogenicity  assessment  including  data  of 
pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W as adjuvant treatment from KEYNOTE-091 and KEYNOTE-054. 
All the ADA samples, and the actual time after first dose and time after last dose, from ADA positive 
participants were provided for both studies. 
The integrated immunogenicity incidence rate for pembrolizumab monotherapy as adjuvant treatment 
in participants with completely resected stages IB (T2a≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC in KEYNOTE-091 and 
in participants with completely resected, lymph node-positive, stage III melanoma in KEYNOTE-054 is 
2.8% (30 out of 1053 evaluable subjects). In particular, the immunogenicity rate observed in each study 
population was 3.4% (17 out of 495) for KEYNOTE-054 and 2.3% (13 out of 558) for KEYNOTE-091. 
This  is  similar  to  the  historical  incidence  rate  of  treatment  emergent  positive  subjects  reported  for 
monotherapy at 2.1% (27 out of 1289 evaluable subjects; range 1.4 to 3.8%). 
Overall,  this  immunogenicity  analysis  shows  that  the  ADA  incidence  rates  for  pembrolizumab  in  the 
adjuvant  setting  are  similar  to  ADA  incidence  rates  for  pembrolizumab  in  the  metastatic  and  locally 
advanced settings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 19/116 
 
 
 
The impact of ADA on pembrolizumab PK profiles indicate that pembrolizumab exposures in ADA positive 
participants do not differ from pembrolizumab exposures in ADA negative participants. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The ADA incidence rates for pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting are similar to ADA incidence rates 
for pembrolizumab in the metastatic and locally advanced settings. 
Treatment-emergent  ADA  status  in  KEYNOTE-091  and  KEYNOTE-054  is  not  found  to  affect 
pembrolizumab exposures, excluding a possible effect on safety and efficacy. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data in this submission is based on Interim analysis 2 (IA2, data cutoff of 20-SEP-2021) 
of KEYNOTE-091, a phase 3 randomized triple blind clinical trial which evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of pembrolizumab versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in participants with Stage IB (T2a ≥4 
cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC, as defined by the AJCC 7th edition, who have undergone complete resection 
with or without standard adjuvant chemotherapy. The results of the Interim analysis 3 (IA3, data 
cutoff of 24-JAN-2023) were also submitted during the procedure per CHMP’s request. 
KEYNOTE-091 is an Intergroup Trial, jointly conducted with ETOP in different countries of EU and third 
countries. Merck was the Sponsor in all participating countries. The EORTC was the coordinating group 
in this trial and centrally managed trial design and activation, data collection and quality control of 
data, statistical analysis and publication.

PD-L1 assay testing 
PD-L1 22C3 testing for KEYNOTE-091 was conducted at a central laboratory (Q2 Solutions). The PD-L1 
22C3 pharmDx kit (investigational use only, IUO) was used. The IUO version and the CE-marked in-
vitro diagnostic (IVD) version of the PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit are identical from a reagent perspective 
and protocol perspective, and IFU closely worded. Training and testing of the pathologists were 
conducted by Agilent to ensure accuracy of these stained slides scored at both the TPS ≥1% and the 
TPS ≥50% cut-offs. An assay validation including sensitivity and precision was then successfully 
conducted at Q2 Solutions, specificity was not repeated.

contrast-enhanced chest and upper abdomen CT scan; contrast-enhanced brain CT scan or MRI only if 
clinically indicated (new evidence of headache or neurologic symptoms). Patients who receive 
treatment beyond 1 year from randomization (to compensate for missed or delayed doses), should 
have imaging performed every 12 weeks until discontinuation of treatment and then will follow the 
ESMO guidelines.

Endpoint definitions:  
DFS: DFS is calculated as the time from randomization to either the date of disease recurrence or the 
date of death (whatever the cause). The date of first documented disease recurrence (if applicable) will 
be used as the date of event. Patients alive with no evidence of disease recurrence at the time of their 
last visit are censored at the time of the last examination. Recurrence of disease can be a loco-regional 
recurrence, a distant (metastatic) recurrence or a second primary. NSCLC and secondary malignancies 
were considered to be events. 
Recurrence is defined as the first day when the RECIST version 1.1 criteria for disease recurrence are 
met. The first date when recurrence was observed is taken into account regardless of the method of 
assessment (imaging and/or pathology). 
OS: OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, whatever the 
cause. The follow-up of patients still alive will be censored at the moment of last visit/contact. 
LCSS: LCSS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death (due to lung cancer 
specifically). (LCSS was not analyzed at IA2 according to the SAP).

Sample size 
The study was designed with dual-primary endpoints (DFS in the whole population and DFS in the PD-
L1 strong positive sub-population). Based on the data from ECOG 1505 study, median DFS in the 
placebo arm was assumed to be equal to 42 months and median OS approximately 86 months. 
Assumptions and the testing strategy were: 
-  Overall, an improvement of 14 months in median DFS (from 42 months to 56 months) or 
equivalent to HR = 0.75 was aimed for the whole population. Improvements of 34.4 and 18 
months in median DFS (from 42 months to 76.4 and 60 months) or equivalent to HR=0.55 and 0.7 
are the effects targeted in PD-L1 strong positive and PD-L1 positive subgroups, respectively. 
- 
- 
The HRs for OS between the experimental and control arms are 0.6, 0.7 and 0.765, for PD-L1 
strong positive, PD-L1 positive and the whole population, respectively. 
It is assumed that approximately 28% of participants are PD-L1 strong positive and approximately 
61% are PD-L1 positive. The enrolment duration was expected to be 52 months, with a yearly 
drop-out rate of 2.5% and 1% for DFS and OS, respectively. 
Two interim analyses (IAs) and one final analysis (FA) for DFS were planned. At the time of each DFS 
analysis, OS analysis was to be performed as well. There are three additional analyses for OS alone 
after DFS FA. 
Approximately 1180 participants were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the experimental arm and 
the control arm. For DFS, based on a target number of ~551 events at FA, the study has ~86% power 
at alpha=1.25% (one-sided) and ~92% power at alpha=2.5% (one-sided) for the whole population. 
Amendment on Sample Size Calculation 
In the initial protocol, sample size was based on the data from Radiant study, where median DFS was 
approximately 48 months in the placebo arm. The study is designed with primary/co-primary 
endpoints: DFS in the whole population and DFS in the PD-L1 strong positive subgroup. It was 
expected:  
- 
- 
an improvement of 13.5 months in median DFS (from 48 months to 61.5 months) or equivalent to 
HR = 0.78 in the whole population 
An improvement of 39.3 months in median DFS (from 48 months to 87.3 months) or equivalent to 
HR=0.55 in the PD-L1 strong positive population  
It was assumed that around 15% of DFS events at the final analysis were to be in the PD-L1 strong 
positive population (based on the available limited epidemiology data). Taking into account a dropout 
rate of 2.5% per year due to loss to follow up, enrollment and total study durations are assumed to be 
87 and 100 months based on a total of 640 disease free survival events and a sample size of 1380 
randomized patients were required. 
In the second amendment, assumption for sample size calculation has been changed. Based on the 
data from ECOG 1505 study, median DFS was approximately 42 months in the placebo arm. Moreover, 
it was expected:  
- 
- 
an improvement of 14 months in median DFS (from 42 months to 56 months) or equivalent to HR 
= 0.75 is aimed for the whole population; 
an improvement of 34.4 and 18 months in median DFS (from 42 months to 76.4 and 60 months) 
in PD-L1 strong positive and positive patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 26/116 
 
 
 
It was assumed that around 30% of patients were PD-L1 strongly positive and 60% PD-L1 positive. 
With this design, a sample size of 1080 patients was required for the whole population to achieve 83% 
power for DFS under the assigned alpha at final analysis. 
Randomisation 
All participants entered have been centrally registered at the EORTC Headquarters. Patient 
randomization in a 1:1 ratio has been performed automatically in the Interactive Voice Response 
System (IVRS). IVRS assign to each patient a treatment dynamically, based on the other patients 
randomized in the study and the stratification factors. 
The Pocock and Simon Minimization with Biased-coin Assignment methodology has been utilized to 
perform participant randomization for this study. Per suggestion of the ICH E9 statistical guidelines, 
the algorithm has been modified to incorporate a random allocation component in order to ensure 15% 
of completely random assignments.  
Stratification factors were:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
stage (IB vs II vs IIIA),  
adjuvant chemotherapy (no adjuvant chemotherapy versus adjuvant chemotherapy) 
PD-L1 status: negative (TPS=0%) versus weak positive (TPS = 1- 49%) versus strong positive 
(TPS≥50%)  
region (Western Europe versus Eastern Europe versus Rest of the world versus Asia).  
Minimization algorithm was separately applied for each PD-L1 status, to ensure an optimal balance of 
treatment arms within each PD-L1 level. Treatment allocation was blinded.  
The proportion of patients with stage IB has been closely monitored by the study steering committee 
to ensure that this proportion does not exceed 35% of the study population.  
Blinding (masking) 
This is a triple blind study. The patient, the investigator and study team at site, the EORTC 
Headquarters study team, the Sponsor and CRO remained blinded to treatment allocation up to the 
database lock for the final analysis of the primary/dual-primary endpoints. Only an on-site pharmacist 
and limited CRO personnel remained unblinded to treatment assignment. 
The unblinded Statistician, an independent Statistician at the EORTC Headquarters not involved in the 
conduct of the trial and the Pharmacovigilance Physician wrote the unblinded interim/safety report for 
the IDMC. 
Statistical methods 
Multiplicity  
The family-wise error rate for DFS and OS hypotheses was strongly controlled at the overall one-sided 
α = 0.0125. The alpha was initially equally split to test DFS in the overall study population and in the 
TPS ≥50% subgroup. If the null hypothesis for DFS was rejected in the TPS ≥50% subgroup, its alpha 
would be fully reallocated to DFS testing in the TPS ≥1% subgroup. Hypotheses for OS in the overall 
study population and in the TPS ≥50% subgroup were to be tested once DFS in the overall study

population was rejected. The Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function with gamma = -4 was used to 
control the type I error in the interim/final analysis for each DFS and OS endpoint.  
Figure 4: Multiplicity Graph for Alpha Re-allocation Strategy 
Interim analysis 
Two interim analyses (IAs) and one final analysis (FA) for DFS were planned in the study. At the time 
of each DFS analysis, OS analysis was to be performed as well. There were three additional analyses 
for OS alone after DFS FA.  
Table 3: Interim and final analyses for DFS: number of events, p-values boundaries and power 
All DFS analyses are DFS event-driven. Beyond the final analysis of DFS, all OS analyses are OS event-
driven.

The primary analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (DFS, OS and LCSS) were to be 
performed on all randomized patients according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle. 
Estimates of the median DFS, OS and LCSS were obtained by the Kaplan Meier technique. The 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the median were calculated using the reflected CI method. Estimates of 
hazard ratios and their 95% CI were obtained by Cox regression.  
For the primary DFS analysis, the date of first documented disease recurrence (if applicable) was used 
as the date of event. If a randomized participant is not disease free at baseline, the date of 
randomization was used as the date of event. Participants alive with no evidence of disease recurrence 
at the time of their last visit are censored at the time of the last disease assessment.

Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses are planned to compare DFS and OS by treatment arm in the stratification factors. 
In addition, subgroup analyses by histology, smoking status, sex, age, baseline ECOG performance 
status, race, geographic region, and EGFR mutation status were also planned.  
Exploratory analyses 
The key exploratory endpoint is Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The global health/QoL scale 
was be used as primary outcome of interest for this study. A difference of 10 points on the 100-point 
QLQ-C30 scale either within a patient or between the two arms was considered as clinically relevant. 
The standard deviation of this scale is approximately 20 points. With the 2-sided alpha set at 5% and a 
power of 80% to detect a difference of 10 points (effect size of 0.5), a minimum of 128 patients (64 
per treatment arm) is required. For an effect size of 0.75 (difference of 15 points), 56 patients (28 per 
treatment arm) are required.

Details of the exact reason for “patient’s refusal” and “other reasons” were not collected for most 
participants. Most common reasons collected for “patient’s refusal” were logistic/travel, did not want to 
receive placebo or AE’s following adjuvant chemotherapy, while for “other reasons” were AEs following 
surgery, lab values and treatment with exclusionary concomitant medications. Overall, no concern is 
raised over the representativeness of the randomized population.

Recruitment 
First participant first visit was on 10-NOV-2015, last patient was randomized on 06-MAY-2020. Study 
is ongoing. Patients were screened and enrolled across 206 study sites in 29 countries. 
At the data cut-off date of IA2 (20-SEP-2021), all patients had had either completed or discontinued 
treatment. The minimum follow-up time from the last patient randomized to the data cutoff date of IA2 
was 16.5 months. The follow-up time off-treatment (i.e., time from the date of last dose of treatment 
to the data cutoff date) across the arms had a median of 26.0 months (26.8 vs 25.5 months in the 
pembrolizumab arm and in the placebo arm, respectively. The median follow-up time was 32.4 months 
(range: 0.6 – 68). 
At the data cut-off date of IA3 (24-JAN-2023), the median follow-up was 46.7 months (range: 0.6 - 
84.2).

Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were classified as per the ICH E3 classification of protocol deviations as important 
(those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key study data or that may significantly 
affect a participant’s rights, safety, or well-being) or not important. Important protocol deviations were 
further classified as either clinically important (deviations that may compromise critical data analyses 
pertaining to primary efficacy and/or safety endpoints or the participant’s safety) or not clinically 
important. 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 175 participants overall (see table below):

Table 10: Summary of important protocol deviation (in the ITT population) 
Part of this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Important and not important 
protocol deviations associated with the pandemic were reported for 225 participants overall, similarly 
in both treatment arms (18.8% vs 19.4% of patients in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, 
respectively). None of the important protocol deviations associated with the pandemic were considered 
to be clinically important.  
No participant’s data were excluded from analyses due to an important protocol deviation. No 
important protocol deviations were classified as a serious GCP compliance issue.

No additional assessment of EGFR status was planned in KEYNOTE-091 study. 
Prior adjuvant chemotherapy 
Approximately 86% of participants in both arms received adjuvant chemotherapy. Of the 14% who did 
not receive adjuvant chemotherapy 32.3% were Stage IB, 54.5% were Stage II, and 13.2% were 
Stage IIIA. A higher proportion of participants who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy were ≥65 
years old (74.9% vs. 48.9%; median age 64 vs 71 without and with chemo, respectively), had Stage 
IB disease (32.3% vs. 11.4%), and had squamous cell histology (44.9% vs. 33.8%) compared with 
those who received adjuvant chemotherapy.

Subsequent antineoplastic therapies 
Fewer participants initiated subsequent antineoplastic therapies in the pembrolizumab group than the 
placebo group (14.6% vs 21.0%). Similarly, fewer participants initiated subsequent immunotherapies 
in the pembrolizumab group than the placebo group (2.5% vs 10.4%). The most commonly prescribed 
(>2%) subsequent antineoplastic agents in pembrolizumab arm were carboplatin/pemetrexed (3.2%) 
and carboplatin/paclitaxel (2.4%). In placebo-treated participants, the most commonly prescribed 
subsequent antineoplastic agents were pembrolizumab (5.3%), pemetrexed (2.6%), and atezolizumab 
(2.6%) (data related to IA2).

Numbers analysed 
1955 patients were screened, and a total of 1177 participants were randomized in KEYNOTE-091 and 
included in the ITT population (590 in the pembrolizumab group, 587 in the placebo group). 333 
patients presented with PD-L1 expression ≥50%, of which 168 randomized to pembrolizumab and 165 
to placebo. 712 patients had PD-L1≥1%, 357 in pembrolizumab and 355 in placebo arm. 1161 patients 
were included in the PRO FAS population.

1. For overall population, analysis is based on multivariate Cox regression model with treatment adjusted by the following 
covariates: stage (IB vs. II vs. IIIA), PD-L1 status (>=50% vs. 1-49% vs. <1%), adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), region 
(Western Europe vs. Eastern Europe vs. Rest of World vs. Asia), histology (squamous vs. non-squamous), and smoking status 
(never vs. former/current). For subgroups, analysis is based on Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate. 2. If a 
subgroup variable has two levels and one level of the subgroup meets any criteria below, then this subgroup variable will not be 
displayed: (1) if the number of participants in a category of a subgroup variable is less than 50, (2) the number of events in a 
category of a subgroup variable is zero in one treatment arm, (3) the number of events in a category of a subgroup variable is less 
than 5 in the pooled arms. Database Cutoff Date: 20SEP2021

Sensitivity analyses 
Several prespecified sensitivity analyses for DFS were conducted in the overall study population and in 
the PD L1 TPS ≥50% and TPS ≥1% subgroups. Results in each sensitivity analysis were consistent with 
the primary analysis.

c Two-sided p-value for testing. H0: difference in % = 0 versus H1: difference in % ≠ 0. 
Improved is defined as a 10-point or more increase in score (in the positive direction) at any time during the trial and confirmed by 
a 10-point or more increase in score at the next consecutive visit. 
Stable is defined as a 10-point or more increase (in the positive direction) or less than 10-point change in score (in the positive or 
negative direction) from baseline and confirmed by a less than 10-point change in score at the next consecutive visit; OR a less than 
10-point change in score and a 10-point or more increase in score at the next consecutive visit. 
Improved + stable is defined as the composite of the improved and stable. 
Deteriorated is defined as a ≥10-point deterioration in score from baseline at any time during the trial when the criteria for 
improved or stable is not met. 
Unconfirmed is defined as when the criteria for improved or stable with confirmation or deterioration is not met. 
No assessment is defined as participants who do not have baseline or post-baseline assessments available.

RESULTS AT INTERIM ANALYSIS 3 
Results from the 3rd efficacy interim analysis with a data cutoff date of 24-Jan-2023, which is the final 
DFS analysis per protocol, are presented below. DFS in the overall study population was not tested 
since the study already met the success criterion at IA2. At IA3, neither DFS in participants with TPS 
≥50% nor OS were statistically significant. OS will continue to be tested at the next analysis (IA4).

RESULTS IN THE POPULATION WITH ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY  
By inclusion criteria, adjuvant chemotherapy was not mandatory but considered for patients with stage 
IB (T ≥ 4 cm) and strongly recommended for stage II and IIIA, and was administered according to 
national and local guidelines. Adjuvant chemotherapy yes/no was a stratification factor. Overall, 86% 
of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy before pembrolizumab/placebo, this percentage was 
overall similar across subgroup by PD-L1 expression, and balanced between treatment arms. 
All results below are based on the IA3.

 a For overall population and all subgroups, analysis is based on multivariate Cox regression model with treatment adjusted by the 
following covariates: stage (IB vs. II vs. IIIA), PD-L1 status (≥50% vs. 1-49% vs. <1%), region (Western Europe vs. Eastern 
Europe vs. Rest of World vs. Asia), histology (squamous vs. non-squamous), and smoking status (never vs. former/current).

 If the number of participants in a category of a subgroup variable is less than 50 (except EGFR mutation status), or the number of 
events in a category of a subgroup variable is zero in one treatment arm, or the number of events in a category of a subgroup 
variable is less than 5 in the pooled arms, the subgroup analysis will not be performed for this category of the subgroup variable.

 a For overall population and all subgroups, analysis is based on multivariate Cox regression model with treatment adjusted by 
the following covariates: stage (IB vs. II vs. IIIA), PD-L1 status (≥50% vs. 1-49% vs. <1%), region (Western Europe vs. 
Eastern Europe vs. Rest of World vs. Asia), histology (squamous vs. non-squamous), and smoking status (never vs. 
former/current).

Secondary analysis – DFS, PD-L1 TPS ≥1% 
DFS in the TPS ≥1% subgroup was prespecified but could not be formally tested because the 
protocol multiplicity strategy requires a statistically significant DFS in the TPS ≥50% 
subgroup to be demonstrated first, which was not showed at IA2. 
Secondary analysis – OS, overall study population 
The OS in the overall study population was prespecified; given DFS was statistically 
significant in the overall study population, OS in the overall study population was formally 
tested with the multiplicity-adjusted p-value.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH for Keytruda initially sought the following extension of indication: “KEYTRUDA as 
monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with Stage IB (T2a ≥ 4 cm), II or IIIA 
non-small cell lung carcinoma who have undergone complete resection.” During the procedure, the 
MAH updated the requested indication to “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant 
treatment of adults with non-small cell lung carcinoma who are at high risk of recurrence following 
complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy (for selection criteria, see section 5.1)”.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study is KEYNOTE-091/PEARLS study (EORTC-1416/ETOP-8-15), a randomized, phase 3 
trial testing adjuvant pembrolizumab after primary surgical resection (R0) of NSCLC, and adjuvant 
chemotherapy if indicated. Patients were eligible regardless of the mutational profile of the tumour or 
histology, as well as regardless of PD-L1 status, which was assessed centrally as TPS score with IHC 
22C3 antibody (IUO). Tumours were to be stage IB with T≥4 cm, II-IIIA NSCLC according to AJCC 
staging 7th in place at the time of study start (2015). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not mandatory but 
recommended according to guidelines. Overall, the inclusion/exclusion criteria are detailed and well 
define the population under study.  
Patients received 18 cycles every 3 weeks of pembrolizumab/placebo (i.e. one year of treatment). 
Baseline imaging was performed to confirm no evidence of disease, and imaging assessment was 
continued initially every 12 weeks during treatment. This is considered acceptable.   
Dual primary endpoints were DFS in the ITT and in the strongly PD-L1 positive (TPS≥50%) populations, 
as assessed by investigator. 
Sample size calculation and power for DFS and OS endpoints was correctly conducted. Randomization 
was well conducted and stratified by stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, PD-L1 status and regions, which 
are considered appropriate, although it is unclear why histology (squamous vs non-squamous) was not 
used as stratification factor. The study was conducted in triple blind, with the exception of the 
pharmacist, which is considered acceptable. The statistical methods were generally adequate and well 
described.  
Overall, the study appears well conducted. Collaterally, a problem in data transfer from EORTC to 
sponsor due to the incompatible date formatting were found, although related only to the protocol 
deviations’ data listing and it’s reassuring that the MAH confirmed that this problem did not affect any 
other dataset, with no impact on any analysis results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MAH initially submitted the results of the interim analysis 2 (data cut-off 20 Sept 2021). A total of 
1177 patients were randomized (590 in the pembrolizumab group and 587 in the placebo group).  
It should be noted that less patients in the pembrolizumab group were able to complete the treatment 
as planned as compared to placebo (51.7% vs 65.6%), with higher rate of treatment discontinuation, 
the main reason being progressive disease in the placebo arm (12.4% vs 21.9%), and study drug 
toxicity in the pembrolizumab arm (19.8% vs 3.8%). Regarding the latter, the AEs leading to 
pembrolizumab discontinuation were however in line with pembrolizumab’s known safety profile, and 
the incidence of discontinuations due to drug-related AEs was similar in the KEYNOTE-091 safety 
dataset and the reference dataset for pembrolizumab in an adjuvant setting (see also Clinical safety 
section), as well as also with other anti-PD(L)1 agents in the same adjuvant NSCLC setting 
(IMpower010 ~18%20). 
At the IA2, median FU was 32.4 months (range 0.6, 68). All patients had either completed 1 year of 
treatment or discontinued treatment. The minimum follow-up time of the last patient randomized to 
the data cut-off date of IA2 was 16.5 months (at least 6 months after completion of 1 year of 
treatment), which is of importance in an adjuvant setting.  
In the ITT and in the PD-L1 TPS≥50% populations (including approximately 30% of patients), baseline 
characteristics are consistent, and balanced between treatment arms. A slight difference is however

noted in histology distribution in the ITT (squamous histology 32.5 vs 38.2%), more marked in some 
PD-L1 subgroup. It would have been preferred if  KEYNOTE-091 was stratified by histology. In 
addition, due to the unknown EGFR mutational status in 57% of the enrolled population, any analysis 
on EGFR mutated NSCLC is speculative at present. The MAH confirmed that no further biomarker 
analysis of EGFR status is planned in this study. In line with the SA, the CHMP considered the patient 
population to be heterogeneous, and noted that the impact on the final indication of any potential 
contrasting results will be a matter of assessment at time of evaluation.  
At the interim analysis 2, statistical significance was reached for DFS in the overall population. With 
36% and 44% of DFS event in pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively, DFS HR was 0.76, 95% 
CI: 0.63, 0.91; p=0.00143, median DFS 53.6 vs 42 months, DFS rate at month 12 78.7% vs 71.6%. 
With the results of IA2, the CHMP concluded that it was not yet possible to assess the cure rate (if any 
in NSCLC) in the context of an adjuvant setting (see also EMA anticancer guideline 21). The tendence of 
DFS KM curves to converge was considered not particularly reassuring, although curves were hardly 
interpretable after month 16 due to high rate of censoring, thus not able to support the assumption of 
an increased cure rate for pembrolizumab. It might be expected that generally most of the recurrence 
will occur within 5 years after NSCLC resection. It was acknowledged that the largest difference of 
events rates between both treatment arms was due to a lower event rate of distant metastasis in the 
pembrolizumab arm (11.5% vs 17.2%). However, a higher rate of death as first DFS event was 
observed in the pembrolizumab arm (27 vs 12). Of those, 11 vs 5 were deaths related to treatment 
emergent AEs, and 4 vs 0 was due to treatment-related AEs. The MAH’s explanation that participants 
receiving placebo have more chances of disease recurrence or new malignancy as the first event can 
be followed. The possibility for fatal treatment-related events with pembrolizumab, also in an adjuvant 
setting, can occur and should be considered. It is reassuring that the overall total number of deaths in 
the pembrolizumab group was however lower than that observed in the placebo group (98 [16.6%] vs 
111 [18.9%]). 
Contrary to ITT, DFS in the subgroup with higher PD-L1 expression TPS≥50% (dual primary endpoint) 
was not statistically significant at IA2 (HR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.57, 1.18; p=0.13639). The lack of 
statistical success in the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% subpopulation, with better results in lower PD-L1 expressors 
1-49% (DFS HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.48, 0.92) were unexpected, as of limited biological plausibility and 
inconsistent with respect to accumulating evidence for immunotherapy. It cannot be excluded that 
imbalances in histology distribution in the ITT (squamous histology 32.5 vs 38.2%), more marked in 
some PD-L1 subgroup, had a role in the unexpected results of this study. No convincing explanation to 
this observation was provided. This was noted.  
OS was also not considered very helpful in taking any decision based on IA2: OS HR was 0.87 (95%CI 
0.67, 1.15) in the ITT population, and 0.92 (95%CI 0.52, 1.62) in the high PD-L1 expressor subgroup, 
with overlapping KM curves in both populations, yet of difficult interpretation due to low number of 
events and high censoring from month 18 onwards. No further support can be expected from other 
intermediate endpoints (e.g. DMFS or DFS2), as the MAH confirmed that those data have not been 
collected.  
In order to clarify the unexpected results in the PD-L1 subgroups, the MAH was requested to discuss 
also the PD-L1 assay: based on the information provided, no concern was raised about PD-L1 
determination.  
Based on the IA2 results, the CHMP concluded that biological plausibility and external validity of the 
DFS data according to PD-L1 expression were put into question and uncertainties on KEYNOTE-091 
results prevented to grant an unrestricted indication. Further, although in the overall population OS HR 
point estimate was <1 with KM curves almost overlapping, OS data was considered immature to draw 
21 EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.6 Guideline on the clinical evaluation of anticancer medicinal products. 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023

any conclusions. As such, it was decided to wait for more mature data of IA3 (i.e. final DFS analysis 
and more mature OS) for any regulatory decision, to alleviate those uncertainties and to allow more 
confidence on the ITT results as well as possibly on subgroups, especially given the adjuvant setting.  
Patients reported outcomes were assessed as an exploratory endpoint. The global health status/quality 
of life score of the EORTC QLQ-30 did not show meaningful change with pembrolizumab as compared 
to placebo.  
The CHMP raised concern over the results in the population having squamous histology (35%), as no 
benefit from the use of pembrolizumab over placebo was suggested in DFS (HR 1.08, 95%CI 0.77, 
1.50) or in OS (HR 1.09, 95%CI 0.70, 1.71), while benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab seemed driven 
by non-squamous histology. The lack of stratification by histology was considered an issue: baseline 
characteristics by histology showed some differences as compared to the ITT population, such as more 
males, fewer never smokers and fewer EGFR mutated (all expected) and less PD-L1 negative, as well 
as some differences within the squamous histology between treatment arms such as age and ECOG 
performance status (in favour of the pembrolizumab arm) and disease stage. According to the MAH, 
DFS result in the squamous histology was driven by the TPS ≥50% population (HR 1.86, 95% CI: 
0.92, 3.77), which was not expected and may be due, in part, to the better-than-expected DFS in 
participants receiving placebo in this population.  
At IA2, subgroup analysis by EGFR status showed in the ITT population benefit of pembrolizumab over 
placebo regardless of EGFR expression but higher in known EGFR mutated tumours. Although 
treatment arms were overall balanced in EGFR mutated patients, data were of difficult interpretation as 
EGFR mutational status was unknown for about 60% of study participants. Data in ALK positive 
disease were far more limited, with only 14 participants with ALK rearrangement (7 in each arm), as 
ALK mutation status was unknown in 64% of participants. To conclude, overall data may suggest an 
activity of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting regardless of EGFR mutation. For ALK positive 
disease, no conclusion can be drawn.  
To date, targeted therapy is approved and indicated in EGFR mutated NSCLC tumours in the adjuvant 
setting, although this was not the case when the study started. The clinical relevance of adjuvant 
pembrolizumab in mutated tumours is unclear, especially when the changed treatment landscape is 
considered. It would have been preferred if further biomarker analysis of EGFR status in KEYNOTE-091 
was planned by the MAH. The IA3 data confirmed however a numerically favourable trend in DFS (HR 
0.44, 95%CI 0.22, 0.87) and OS (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.13, 0.98) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC, 
acknowledging the large confidence intervals due to the small sample size. Therefore, no reason is 
found to explicitly exclude EGFR mutated tumours from the adjuvant indication. The information that 
testing for genomic tumour aberrations/oncogenic drivers was not mandatory for enrolment, as well as 
the number of patients with EGFR positive/negative/undetermined status have been included in the 
SmPC section 5.1. 
Patients who did not receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy did not show apparent benefit for adjuvant 
treatment with pembrolizumab as compared to placebo. Acknowledging that this subgroup was a 
minority (84 vs 83, approximately 15% of the ITT population), adjuvant chemotherapy was a 
stratification factor, thus strengthening the data. No imbalances are observed with regard to prior 
adjuvant chemotherapy among study arms, received by approximately 86% of participants in both 
treatment arms. The most common agents used were cisplatin/vinorelbine, carboplatin/vinorelbine, 
and carboplatin/paclitaxel. The median duration of exposure to prior adjuvant chemotherapy and 
median number of cycles (4) was similar in both treatment groups. Patients who did not receive 
adjuvant chemotherapy were older (although ECOG was similar), slightly more Asian, with lower 
disease stage, and more squamous histology. Overall, about 14% of patients with stage II disease and 
approximately 6% of patients with stage IIIA did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. It might be 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 71/116 
 
 
 
reasonable to assume that the investigator’s choice of avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy had been 
based on differences in baseline characteristics that are likely not fully reportable.  
In the population of participants who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, at IA2 DFS HR was 1.21 
(95% CI: 0.73, 2.03), contrary to patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.73, 95%CI 
0.60, 0.89). When broken down by PD-L1 subgroups, results in patients not receiving prior adjuvant 
chemotherapy should be interpreted with caution due to small numbers. The MAH did not elaborate on 
any possible explanation for the observed lack of effect in patients who did not receive adjuvant 
treatment, and it was unclear how to interpret such data, acknowledging the limited number of 
patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment.  
Stage (according to AJCC 7th ed) was a stratification factor. Overall, a trend toward more limited 
benefit in the higher stage (IIIA) was observed, which seems counterintuitive. However, maturity 
progresses differently across prognostic subgroups, and there are still fewer events in the IB stage for 
a conclusive assessment. 
The assessment of IA2 results did not allow the CHMP to conclude a positive benefit/risk of one year of 
adjuvant pembrolizumab vs placebo in a broad population, or to restrict the indication to best 
performing subgroup(s) with reasonable degree of confidence. As a result, more mature results were 
requested, corresponding to the pre-planned IA3 data (i.e. final analysis for DFS).  
The IA3 results (data cut-off date 24-Jan-2023) provided by the MAH, included patients with a median 
FU of 46.7 months, approximately 13 months longer compared with IA2; the minimum follow-up of the 
last patient randomized was 32 months i.e. about 1.7 year after the end of 1-year adjuvant treatment.  
DFS in the overall population was updated (but not statistically tested, as already significant at IA2) 
(HR 0.81; 95%CI 0.68-0.96; 45% vs 51% of DFS events). Although HR point estimate was slightly 
worse than IA2 (from 0.76 to 0.81), confidence interval was still below the unity. DFS in TPS≥50% 
was tested at IA3 but again did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.59-1.16), as well 
as OS in the overall population (HR 0.87; 95%CI 0.69-1.10; p=0.118; 23% vs 27% of OS events) and 
in the TPS≥50% (HR 0.93; 95%CI 0.57-1.50 p=0.38). It can be concluded that results are overall 
consistent with IA2 data.  
Also, the results of the DFS subgroup analyses at IA3 are consistent with IA2, with no subgroup driving 
the results. Most of the subgroups have confidence interval crossing 1, with HR point estimate >1 in 
squamous disease, no prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and stage IB.  
With the submission of IA3 data, the MAH decided to seek a more limited indication by excluding 
patients who have not received previous adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The MAH has justified the 
new proposal as IA2 and IA3 data were consistent, because limiting the population to those patients 
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, the DFS HR point estimates for all subgroups were <1. Baseline 
characteristics of the newly proposed population treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (85% of the 
overall population) are balanced between treatment arms, being “adjuvant chemotherapy yes/no” a 
stratification factor. At IA3, the results in the population with adjuvant chemotherapy are numerically 
more favourable as compared to the ITT:  
- DFS HR 0.76 (95%CI 0.64, 0.91), 44% vs 52 % events, medians 54 vs 40 months, DFS rate at 24 
months 67% vs 59%. KM curves open after month 6 and remain separated with apparently constant 
distance.  
- OS HR 0.79 (95%CI 0.62, 1.01), 22% vs 27% events, medians NR in either arm, pembrolizumab 
curve is marginally higher than placebo after 12 months but uninterpretable after month 36.  
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 72/116 
 
 
 
In the population treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, DFS HR point estimates for subgroups are all 
<1, although the same trend seen in the ITT is generally observed, e.g. worse outcome in PD-L1≥50% 
than in PD-L1<50%, and worse estimates in squamous histology rather than in the non-squamous. 
Regarding subgroups analysis for OS, HR point estimates for subgroups are all <1, with the exception 
of patients over 75 years. No subgroups appear to drive the results.    
While it is agreed that the subgroup of patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy showed 
negative DFS trend (HR 1.16; 95%CI 0.73, 1.84), biological plausibility of the choice of this patient 
population is not discussed and not clear. External evidence may however support the proposed 
population, as adjuvant Tecentriq in NSCLC was approved after adjuvant chemotherapy only, although 
the replication of findings is not fully evaluable as study IMpower010 enrolled only patients who have 
received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, differently from KEYNOTE-091. From a statistical perspective, 
however, adjuvant chemotherapy yes/no was a stratification factor, and pre-specified subgroup 
analyses, which strengthened the result.  
Uncertainty remains in terms of OS maturity. The MAH will submit updated OS data as part of the 
imposed PAES (see Annex II). In addition, the MAH will submit data on treatment post-progression, 
and particularly on the uptake and activity of anti-PD(L)1 in patients previously treated with adjuvant 
pembrolizumab. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
KEYNOTE-091 study showed, at the IA2, statistically significant improvement in DFS for 
pembrolizumab over placebo when used for one year duration as adjuvant treatment after complete 
NSCLC resection in the ITT population. The results of the more mature IA3 confirmed IA2 data, 
providing reassurance that the benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab can be maintained with longer 
follow-up.  
The indication was restricted to patients who have been treated with prior adjuvant chemotherapy 
excluding a (small) subgroup of patients not receiving prior adjuvant chemotherapy in whom DFS 
detriment cannot be excluded. The overall results in the population after adjuvant chemotherapy 
suggest a relevant DFS benefit and positive OS trend for pembrolizumab vs placebo. In addition, this 
population will be aligned with indications of other medicines from the same class approved in the 
adjuvant NSCLC setting. 
Uncertainty remains in terms of OS maturity. The MAH will submit updated OS data as part of the 
imposed PAES (see Annex II). In addition, the MAH will submit data on treatment post-progression, 
and particularly on the uptake and activity of anti-PD(L)1 in patients previously treated with adjuvant 
pembrolizumab.  
The following measure is considered necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): in order to further characterise the efficacy of Keytruda for 
the adjuvant treatment of adults with non-small cell lung carcinoma who are at high risk of recurrence, 
the MAH should submit the results of the final OS analysis of study KEYNOTE-091. The MAH should 
submit updated data on treatment post-progression, and particularly on the uptake and activity of 
anti-PD(L)1 in patients previously treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
General safety profile 
Pembrolizumab is most commonly associated with immune related adverse reactions. Most of these, 
including severe reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of 
pembrolizumab.  
When used as monotherapy, the most frequent adverse reactions with pembrolizumab were 
fatigue (30%) and diarrhoea (22%). The majority of adverse reactions reported for monotherapy were 
of Grades 1 or 2 severity. The most serious adverse reactions were immune-related adverse reactions 
and severe infusion-related reactions. The incidences of immune-related adverse reactions were 36.9% 
all Grades and 8.7% for Grades 3-5 for monotherapy in the adjuvant setting and 24.5% all Grades 
and 6.3% for Grades 3-5 in the metastatic setting. 
Safety Datasets used in the present submission 
Safety results for pembrolizumab are presented for the following 4 datasets: 
-  KEYNOTE-091 Pembrolizumab Dataset (N=580): Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), Stage II, or Stage 
IIIA NSCLC who participated in KEYNOTE-091 treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. 
-  KEYNOTE-091 Placebo Dataset (N=581): Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), Stage II, or Stage IIIA 
NSCLC who participated in KEYNOTE-091 treated with placebo.  
-  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD [EU] (N=6185): The 6185 pembrolizumab-treated 
participants from the RSD consists of 2076 participants with advanced melanoma and 2022 
participants with NSCLC (with pembrolizumab used as first-line treatment). In addition, this 
dataset includes participants with cHL, urothelial cancer, CRC, HNSCC. This dataset represents 
the established safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy. 
-  Cumulative Reference Safety Dataset (N=10,997): Participants from the Safety Dataset, 
the RSD, and participants treated with pembrolizumab in the studies listed in the footnotes of 
the data tables in this document and the ISS comprise the Cumulative Running Safety Dataset. 
NOTE: safety data of KEYNOTE-091 are presented at IA2 (data cutoff 20-SEP-2021), unless noted 
otherwise. 
Patient exposure 
KEYNOTE-091 is an ongoing study. As of the data cutoff on 20-SEP-2021, n=1161 participants had 
received at least one dose of study treatment, including 580 in the pembrolizumab group and 581 in 
the placebo group. No participants were still receiving treatment. Thus, drug exposure was not 
changed at IA3 (data cut-off 24-Jan-2023). Pembrolizumab/placebo was given for up to 1 year.  
The following table shows a summary on drug exposure.

Myocarditis, 1 Myocardial infarction, 1 Myocardial ischaemia, and other cardiac generic conditions). 
Two other patients died by sepsis and other 2 by pulmonary infections. 
Assessment report

The MAH considered 4 participants (in pembrolizumab arm) to have died due to drug-related AEs: 
myocarditis and cardiogenic shock in 1 participant; myocarditis and septic shock in 1 participant; and 
pneumonia and sudden death each in 1 participant.  
Patient was with a history including (but not limited to) Sleep apnoea syndrome, Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. From Days 40 to 46 and Days 56 to 63 (after pembrolizumab start), the 
participant experienced 2 separate events of lower respiratory tract infection (Grade 2), treated with 
antibiotics and corticosteroids. On Day 68 the participant had dyspnea and orthopnea and was 
hospitalized with the diagnosis respiratory tract infection (Grade 3) with bilateral interstitial pattern at 
the x-ray. On Day 74 a fibrobronchoscopy showed acute inflammation and infection by 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.  
On Day 83 a CT showed an unspecified infiltrate and the participant was readmitted to the hospital 
with increased dyspnea and fever. Lab test showed increased WBC and neutrophils. On Day 88 
pembrolizumab was discontinued in response to respiratory infection (last dose on Day 64). On Day 91 
the participant died due to respiratory tract infection. The investigator considered respiratory tract 
infection not related to pembrolizumab. 
Patient was with a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who developed myocardial ischemia 
at Day 121 (after pembrolizumab start) after a total of 5 doses of pembrolizumab. The patient also 
developed pericardial effusion, at the same time, and the microbiological analysis revealed that the 
fluid was positive for Staphylococcus spp. The participant died due to myocardial ischemia on Day 121. 
The investigator considered myocardial ischemia not related to pembrolizumab. 
Patient, according to the MAH, developed hypothyroidism. The table with his lab tests is shown below. 
The diagnosis of hypothyroidism was on day 43 and the start of treatment with thyroid hormone was 
on day 53. The patient died by sudden death after chest pain (no further information available).

NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091 / EORTC-1416-LCG) is 2.8% (30 out of 1053 evaluable participants). The 
historical incidence rate reported after pembrolizumab monotherapy is 2.1% (27 out of 1289 evaluable 
participants) (see next table). Overall, treatment-emergent ADA status in KEYNOTE-091 and 
KEYNOTE-054 is not found to affect pembrolizumab exposures. Without any impact on exposures, ADA 
status is not expected to impact on safety and efficacy.

Pregnancy and lactation 
There were no reports of pregnancy in KEYNOTE-091. 
Pembrolizumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the foetus. It is not known whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs 
and IgG antibodies are secreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, 
and other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG 
antibody. The IgG antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 
enzymes, other enzymes, or transporters involved in drug elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI 
studies have been performed. No preclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to assess the 
propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or perpetrator of pharmacokinetic DDIs. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. 
However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate 
potential side effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was 
assessed as part of the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship was observed between 
prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Nevertheless, given the study 
design, exclusion criteria, and immunomodulatory mechanism of action, the use of systemic 
Assessment report

Page 99/116 
 
 
 
 
 
corticosteroids (at doses greater than physiologic replacement), or other immunosuppressants before 
the start of pembrolizumab treatment, is not recommended. However, systemic corticosteroids, or 
other immunosuppressants, can be used during pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related 
adverse reactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The proportions of participants who discontinued study medication due to a drug-related AE were 
higher in the KEYNOTE-091 Pembrolizumab Dataset than in the RSD. The higher incidence of 
discontinuation of study medication due to drug-related AEs may be explained by the approximately 2-
fold longer duration of exposure in the KEYNOTE-091 Pembrolizumab Dataset compared with the RSD. 
The number of patients who discontinued the drug due to AEs was higher in pembrolizumab than 
placebo (19.8% vs 5.9%) and also compared to the RSD (13.5%). Most, in both arms pembrolizumab 
and placebo, discontinued due to a drug-related AE (16.9% vs 3.4%). Those who discontinued due to 
a SAE were more frequent in pembrolizumab (8.4% vs 2.4%). 
The most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥5 participants) leading to treatment discontinuation in 
the KEYNOTE-091 Pembrolizumab Dataset were pneumonitis, diarrhoea, colitis, and hypothyroidism. 
Pneumonitis was reported in 3.6% of participants in the KEYNOTE-091 Pembrolizumab Dataset 
compared with 1.7% in the RSD. Diarrhoea was observed in 1.2% of participants in the KEYNOTE-091 
Pembrolizumab Dataset compared with 0.2% in the RSD. Colitis was observed with a similar frequency 
in the KEYNOTE-091 Pembrolizumab Dataset and RSD.

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period  04-Sep-2020  through  03-Sep-2021,  specifically  Appendix  20.3  (Numbers  of  Adverse  Drug 
Reactions by Preferred Term from Postauthorization Sources). 
There are no records of any pembrolizumab registration being revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons 
in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  known  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  is  mainly  characterised  by  immune-related  adverse 
reactions, most of which resolved after appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of pembrolizumab. 
When used as monotherapy, the most frequent known ADRs with pembrolizumab were fatigue (30%) 
and diarrhoea (22%). The majority of ADRs reported were of Grades 1 or 2 severity. The most serious 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 102/116 
 
 
 
 
adverse reactions were immune-related ADRs and severe infusion-related reactions. The incidences of 
immune-related  ADRs  were 36.9%  for  all  Grades  and 8.7%  for  Grades 3-5  for  monotherapy  in  the 
adjuvant setting, and 24.5% for all Grades and 6.3% for Grades 3-5 in the metastatic setting. 
The data analysed in the present procedure come mainly from the study KEYNOTE-091 on patients 
affected by Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), Stage II, or Stage IIIA NSCLC, randomised to one of the two arms: 
1) pembrolizumab (n=580, treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab monotherapy); 2) placebo (n=581). 
For comparison with the currently known safety profile, data from the pembrolizumab monotherapy 
RSD (n=6185, mainly patients with advanced melanoma or with NSCLC in first-line setting). A 
comparison versus the pooled pembrolizumab arms from other adjuvant settings has also been 
performed. 
For the present study, the median of exposure to pembrolizumab was similar to placebo (11.7 vs 11.8 
months), whereas the mean was markedly lower for pembrolizumab than placebo (8.7 vs 10.0 
months). Also, the patients with exposure >6 months and >9 months were lower in pembrolizumab 
than in placebo (68.4% vs 81.2% and 60.9% vs 74.2%, respectively). All these data are consistent 
with higher discontinuation rate in pembrolizumab compared to placebo. 
At baseline, more patients in the pembrolizumab arm had an ECOG status of 0 compared to placebo 
(64.7% vs 58.3%). In the RDS the number of patients with ECOG 0 was lower (47.6%). 
Adverse events 
Overall distribution: out of 580 patients in each arm, those with at least one AE were 
(pembrolizumab vs placebo) 95.9% vs 91.0%. More AEs were adjudicated as drug-related in 
pembrolizumab compared to placebo (75.2% vs 52.5%) but in line with RSD (70.6%). Many more 
grade 3-5 AEs were considered as drug-related in pembrolizumab compared to placebo (15.2% vs 
4.3%), again in line with RSD. A similar trend was observed with serious drug-related AEs. More 
patients discontinued the drug in pembrolizumab than in placebo (19.8% vs 5.9%) or in RSD (13.5%): 
the figure compared to RSD could be explained by a better clinical/general condition of patients 
enrolled in the present study compared to the average RSD patient and, thus, to a higher probability 
that every deviation from this wellness condition is attributed to the drug (instead that to the disease). 
Patients who discontinued the treatment due to drug-related AEs were many more in pembrolizumab 
than in placebo (16.9% vs 3.4%) or in RSD (7.2%). 
The most frequently reported AEs (incidence >15%) were weight increased, pruritus, 
hypothyroidism, arthralgia, diarrhoea, and fatigue (but weight increased was lower compared to 
placebo). Pruritus was more common in pembrolizumab (21.6% vs 12.7%) but in line with RSD 
(18.0%). Hypothyroidism was much more frequent in pembrolizumab than in placebo (20.7% vs 
4.6%) and RSD (11.3%); a similar pattern was observed for Hyperthyroidism: more frequent in 
pembrolizumab than placebo (10.7% vs 2.9%) or RSD (4.2). The higher frequency compared to RSD is 
probably due to the lower exposure occurred in this latter dataset. Arthralgia was slightly more 
frequent with pembrolizumab but in line with RSD. Overall, the AEs were similar to what observed for 
the adjuvant-setting database (with the notable exception of deaths, see below). 
Drug-related AEs: Hypothyroidism was the most frequent drug-related AE (pembrolizumab vs 
placebo: 19.7% vs 3.3%; RSD: 9.8%). A similar pattern was observed for drug-related 
hyperthyroidism (9.3% vs 3.7%). Pruritus was considered related to treatment more often in 
pembrolizumab than placebo (17.9% vs 10.3%) but with a similar proportion compared to RSD. A 
similar pattern was observed for diarrhoea. Rush was also more frequently related to treatment in 
pembrolizumab vs placebo (manually calculated adding related PTs: 12.6% vs 5.1%). Pneumonitis 
related to drug in pembrolizumab were more than twice as many as in placebo (5.7% vs 2.1%).

Grade 3-5 AEs: the number of subjects experiencing at least one grade 3-5 AE was higher with 
pembrolizumab compared to placebo (34.1% vs 25.8%) but lower compared to RSD (48.2%), as 
somewhat expected because of the more severe clinical conditions of patients in the latter dataset. The 
AEs which showed the biggest differences of prevalence between pembrolizumab and placebo were 
pneumonia/pneumonitis (3.3% vs 1.9%; RSD: 5.5%) and diarrhoea (1.2% vs 0.3%). It is noteworthy 
that hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which were two frequent AEs, are not listed among the most 
frequent grade 3-5 AEs (just 1 case for each AE is reported). However, grade 3-5 hypocortisolism (that 
can be a life-threatening endocrine condition) was observed only in pembrolizumab (n=5, 0.9% vs 
n=0).  
AEOSIs (immune-related events and infusion-related reactions): the number of patients with at least 
one AEOSI was higher in pembrolizumab than placebo (39.0% vs 12.9%) or RSD (25.5%). A similar 
pattern is observed for drug-related AEOSI (36.9% vs 9.1%; RSD: 22.1%). Also, when adjusted for 
the exposure, the incidence of AEOSI was higher in pembrolizumab compared to the RSD, probably 
because many of these events require some time to develop fully and to become clinically evident: 
thus, the shorter exposure of the RSD could have been insufficient for many of these events to 
emerge, resulting in a lower incidence in the RSD. 
Hypothyroidism was much more frequent in pembrolizumab than in placebo (20.7% vs 4.6%) or in 
RSD (11.3%). Hyperthyroidism, too, was much more frequent with pembrolizumab than placebo 
(10.7% vs 2.9%) or RSD (4.2%). Adrenal insufficiency was observed only in pembrolizumab (n=10, 
1.7%): it has been reassigned a frequency of “Common” at the 4.8 section of the SmPC; the frequency 
in the RSD was 0.8%. Hypophysitis was only observed in patients in pembrolizumab (n=7, 1.2%) and 
no cases were registered with placebo; the frequency in the RSD was 0.6%. 
Hepatitis was more common in pembrolizumab than placebo (n=10, 1.7% vs n=4, 0.7%) and than 
RSD (1.0%). Myocarditis was more frequent in pembrolizumab compared to placebo (n=5, 0.9% vs 
n=1, 0.2%) and to RSD (n=7, 0.1%). Whilst the lower incidence of many immune-mediated AEs in the 
RSD can be attributed to a lower exposure in that dataset, the difference observed for myocarditis in 
pembrolizumab vs RSD (0.9% vs 0.1%) seems higher compared to other immune-related AEs (such as 
hepatitis). Immune-mediated myocarditis is a known AE associated to anti-PD-L1 therapies. It is 
difficult to assess the relationship between the cases of myocarditis observed in the study and the 
treatment because of the concomitant complications observed in some patients (such as sepsis). 
However, since the known causal relationship, it is not possible to exclude pembrolizumab as causal 
factor of these cases. 
The most frequent SAEs (pembrolizumab vs placebo) were: pneumonia (2.2% vs 1.5%), pneumonitis 
(2.1% vs 0.7%), diarrhoea (1.2% vs 0.2%); the prevalence of these three AEs was not higher than 
what observed in the RSD. Pulmonary embolism was observed only in the pembrolizumab group (n=3, 
0.5%) and none in the placebo (but the prevalence in the RSD was higher: 1.2%); however, only 3 
subjects were involved, and therefore it is not possible to establish firmly whether embolism was 
related to the IMP or it was by chance. In general, SAEs were in line to what already known from the 
RSD, and the frequency was similar or lower in the current pembrolizumab arm compared to RSD. 
Patients who died for AEs were almost double with pembrolizumab compared to placebo (1.9% vs 
1.0%) but less than RSD (5.2%). Moreover, it must be kept in mind that the current setting is 
adjuvant therapy and, therefore, patients had ECOG status 0 or 1 (i.e. they were in relatively good 
general clinical conditions as compared to the metastatic setting). Compared to other approved 
adjuvant settings, there were more patients with fatal AEs in the current pembrolizumab arm than in 
the pooled pembrolizumab arms of the other adjuvant settings, n=11 (1.9%) vs n=4 (0.3%), and the 
cases considered drug-related were 4 (0.7%) vs 0. Therefore, at first glance a higher number of 
patients died in the pembrolizumab arm of the current trial compared to the other studies in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 104/116 
 
 
 
adjuvant setting. However, when all the deaths in the current trial are considered (both those due to 
AEs and those counted as outcome events for efficacy evaluation) the number of patients who died in 
the pembrolizumab arm is lower compared to placebo (98, 16.6% vs 111, 18.9%). Therefore, an 
overall lower mortality has been registered in the pembrolizumab arm of the current study. 
One patient with hyperthyroidism (high FT4, low TSH) was erroneously treated with thyroid hormone 
therapy. The patient died by sudden death, after chest pain, the day after the finding of a FT4 value 
more than 3 times higher than the upper normal value. The cause of death could be related to 
myocardial ischemia, for which a condition of hyperthyroidism is a known risk factor. However, from 
the data available it has not been possible to gather more information. 
Regarding the laboratory findings, a grade 3-4 ALT increase was observed in more patients in 
pembrolizumab than placebo (3.3% vs 0.5%) but in line with RSD. Similar findings were seen for AST 
and bilirubin. Grade 3-4 Hypokalaemia was more frequent in pembrolizumab than placebo (1.9% vs 
0.3%) but less than RSD. The other main laboratory findings were overall similar between the two 
arms and to the RSD. 
Discontinuation of the IMP was higher with pembrolizumab compared to placebo and to the RSD. The 
latter finding can be due to the shorter exposure in the RSD. The most frequent cause of 
discontinuation was Pneumonitis: (pembrolizumab vs placebo) n=21 (3.6%) vs n=4 (0.7); 
pneumonitis is a well-known ADR to pembrolizumab. This cause was also more frequent in the 
pembrolizumab arm of the current study compared to the RSD (1.7%). Other AEs which caused 
discontinuation were Diarrhoea (1.2% vs 0.3%), Colitis (0.9% vs 0.2%), Hypothyroidism (0.9% vs 0). 
Autoimmune hepatitis was also more frequent in pembrolizumab than placebo (n=5, 0.9% vs n=0). 
The most frequent cause of treatment interruption was Hypothyroidism which was more frequent in 
pembrolizumab than in placebo (3.4% vs 0.2%) and RSD. Again, the difference with the RSD could be 
due to a shorter exposure in the latter dataset. Other AEs leading to interruption were Diarrhoea 
(3.3% vs 1.0%) and pneumonitis (3.1% vs 1.5%). Other AEs with a high difference in frequency 
between the two arms were Arthralgia (2.8% vs 0.5%), Colitis (1.4% vs 0), Hyperthyroidism (1.2% vs 
0), Rash (1.2% vs 0), Adrenal insufficiency (n=3, 0.5% vs 0): the latter event is not frequent but, 
since it is a possible life-threatening condition, deserves particular attention.  
The MAH position that food and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure to pembrolizumab, since 
it is an IgG antibody, is shared. In the same way, drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and 
other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of pembrolizumab. 
The ADA incidence rate in the present study was lower or comparable to what observed in a similar 
setting (adjuvant treatment of melanoma): 2.3% vs 3.4% respectively. The historical incidence rate of 
treatment emergent positive subjects reported for monotherapy is 2.1%, that is similar to what 
observed in the present study.  
Relevant figures in section 4.8 of the SmPC were updated to incorporate safety data from this 
submission. More specifically, the incidences of immune-mediated adverse reactions for 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy was updated to 37% all Grades and 9% for Grades 3-5 for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant setting and 25% all Grades and 6% for Grades 3-5 in the 
metastatic setting; In patients with NSCLC, pneumonitis occurred in 206 (6.1%), including Grade 2, 3, 
4 or 5 cases in 92 (2.7%), 56 (1.7%), 16 (0.5%) and 9 (0.3%), respectively; In patients with  
melanoma, NSCLC and RCC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant setting 
(n=2,060), the incidence of hyperthyroidism was updated to 11.0%, the majority of which were 
Grade 1 or 2. In patients with melanoma, NSCLC and RCC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
the adjuvant setting (n=2,060), the incidence of hypothyroidism was updated to 18.5%, the majority 
of which were Grade 1 or 2.

Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on safety 
Regarding the age, on average, the number of AEs, drug-related AEs and grade 3-5 AEs in the 
pembrolizumab arm in patients >65 years was similar to that of patient <65 years, except for SAEs 
and discontinuation which were slightly more frequent in the category >65 years. This pattern seems 
slightly different than that observed in the RSD where also the overall number of AEs, drug-related AEs 
and grade 3-5 AEs was higher in the >65 years. The frequency of AEs seems to increase with age in 
patients >65 years, but the number of patients >85 years is very limited, and no conclusions can be 
gathered on this age group. In the range 75-84 years (about 50-60 patients in each arm in the current 
study) in the pembrolizumab arm, the number of AEs was not higher compared to the corresponding 
RSD age category, except for discontinuations due to AEs that were more frequent in the current 
pembrolizumab arm (but the small number of subjects prevents any further evaluation). 
When analysed by gender, the overall number of patients with at least one AE in pembrolizumab arm 
was similar between male and female. However, more male patients had grade 3-5 AEs compared to 
female (36.3% vs 29.6%); but when only drug-related AEs are considered, these were similar between 
the two categories. A similar pattern can also be observed for SAEs. AEs with fatal outcome were more 
frequent in male vs female (n=10, 2.5% vs n=1, 0.5%) but the same happened in the placebo group 
(1.3% vs 0.5%), whereas in the RSD dataset this difference is much lower (5.5% vs 4.5%). However, 
it seems that male participants had more baseline risk factors than female participants (such as age, 
smoking history and pre-existing medical conditions) potentially leading to a worse outcome.   
There are some differences observed in the frequency of AEs according to the race (divided into white, 
other and not applicable). For instance, patients who discontinued the drug due to AEs were more 
frequent in the white group than in the other group (21.7% vs 12.0%); however, the groups were 
unbalanced as to numerosity (442 vs 117 subjects enrolled, in pembrolizumab arm, in each category 
respectively) and in the RSD the differences were much less noticeable.  
When patients with AEs were analysed by geographical regions, the number of patients in 
pembrolizumab arm with grade 3-5 AEs was higher in EU than in non-EU (37.9% vs 26.6%); a similar 
pattern is observed in the placebo arm but not in RSD where the distribution was similar. Drug-related 
grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs and discontinuation due to AEs were all more frequent in EU compared to non-EU, 
in both arms (pembrolizumab and placebo), whereas they had similar frequency in the RSD. It should 
be noted that the two groups (i.e. EU and non-EU) of the current study were of different size (388 vs 
192 respectively). The EU patients seemed to have more risk factors at baseline compared to non-EU 
(slightly higher age, more smokers). This could have given EU patients a worse outcome. 
When analysed by ECOG status there were no relevant differences between patients with ECOG status 
0 and 1 in the pembrolizumab arm: the differences, if any, were small, in the expected direction 
(possible slightly higher frequency of AEs in ECOG 1), and in line with what observed in the placebo 
arm and in the RSD.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab is mainly characterised by immune-related adverse reactions. In 
the current study, overall, the number of AEs was higher in pembrolizumab compared to placebo but in 
line with the RSD. However, discontinuations due to AEs and the frequency of AEOSI (such as 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) were higher in pembrolizumab than RSD (but exposure was 
longer in the present study). The AEs most frequently reported were pruritus, hypothyroidism, 
arthralgia, diarrhoea, and fatigue. Death due to AEs was more commonly observed in pembrolizumab 
than placebo, and was slightly higher when compared to the pooled pembrolizumab arms from other 
adjuvant settings. Overall, no new particular safety concerns have arisen from the data submitted in 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 106/116 
 
 
 
the current procedure, and the safety profile could be acceptable. However, considering the adjuvant 
setting and, thus, the relatively good clinical general condition of these patients, the observed higher 
mortality compared to placebo, and the higher discontinuation and higher AEOSI rate compared to 
RSD, will have to be taken into account in the definition of the B/R ratio (see 3.7.2).

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC as well as annex 
II.D have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: There 
are two limited modifications and no other proposed changes to the content of the package leaflet; in 
particular the key messages for the safe use of the medicinal product are not impacted. Furthermore, 
the design, layout and format of the package leaflet will not be affected by the proposed revisions.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final indication is “KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults 
with non-small cell lung carcinoma who are at high risk of recurrence following complete resection and 
platinum-based chemotherapy (for selection criteria, see section 5.1)”. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Platinum-based doublets is the mainstay of the systemic adjuvant treatment for resected NSCLC. 
Standard combinations are cisplatin and vinorelbine, but other combinations are commonly used in the 
clinical practice (etoposide, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, taxane)22,23. Regarding immunotherapy, 
atezolizumab was approved for the adjuvant treatment of NSCLC after resection and platinum-based 
chemotherapy at high risk of recurrence and PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TC) ≥50% and who do 
not have EGFR mutant or ALK
positive NSCLC24. In mutated NSCLC, osimertinib was approved for the 
adjuvant treatment of stage IB-IIIA NSCLC limited to tumors with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 
(L858R) substitution mutations25. 
-
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-091 (PEARLS study/EORTC-1416/ETOP-8-15) is a randomized Phase 3 trial with 
pembrolizumab versus placebo for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Stage 
IB (T2a ≥ 4 cm), II or IIIA (AJCC 7th ed) after complete resection and completion of standard 
adjuvant chemotherapy (administered when recommended). The trial randomized 1170 patients 1:1 to 
receive pembrolizumab or placebo (triple blinded). Dual primary endpoints of the study were DFS in 
the ITT and in the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% subgroup. The MAH submitted the IA2 analysis (data cutoff of 20-
SEP-2021), at a median follow-up of duration for participants of 33.3 months for the pembrolizumab 
group and 31.9 months for the placebo group. All patients have either discontinued or completed 1 
year of adjuvant treatment. Results of the pre-specified IA3 analysis (data cut-off 24 Jan 2023) were 
also submitted during the procedure. At IA3, median follow-up was 46.7 months (approximately 13 
months longer as compared to IA2).   
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
In KEYNOTE-091 study, most of the population (86%, 506 vs 504 patients) received prior adjuvant 
chemotherapy which was a stratification factor and was balanced between treatment arms. At IA3, 
the results in the population with adjuvant chemotherapy are numerically more favourable as 
compared to the ITT, showing relevant DFS benefit maintained with longer follow up [DFS HR 0.76 
(95%CI 0.64, 0.91), 44% vs 52 % events, medians 54 vs 40 months, DFS rate at 24 months 67%

vs 59%], and numerical positive OS trend [OS HR 0.79 (95%CI 0.62, 1.01), 22% vs 27% events, 
medians NR in either arm]. In this population, DFS HR point estimates for subgroups are all <1, as 
well as for OS (with the exception of patients over 75 years). No subgroups appear to drive the 
results. 
• 
IA3 data confirmed numerically favourable trends in DFS (HR 0.44, 95%CI 0.22, 0.87) and OS (HR 
0.35, 95%CI 0.13, 0.98) in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC, acknowledging the large 
confidence intervals due to the small sample size. Therefore, patients with EGFR mutated tumours 
are not explicitly excluded from the adjuvant indication.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  OS in the ITT and in the PD-L1 TPS ≥50% population did not reach statistical significance neither 
at IA2 nor at IA3, and could not formally be tested in PD-L1 TPS ≥1% (IA3 OS in all patients: HR 
0.87, 95%CI 0.69, 1.10, p=0.11792, 23% vs 27% OS event; OS in TPS ≥50%: HR 0.93, 95%CI 
0.57, 1.50, p= 0.3778, 20% vs 21% OS events). The MAH will submit the final OS analysis which 
will further characterise the efficacy of Keytruda in the intended indication (see Annex II). 
•  Some uncertainty remains in terms of the efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of adults with NSCLC, 
specifically on data on treatment post-progression, and particularly on the uptake and activity of 
anti-PD(L)1 in patients previously treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab. The MAH is expected to 
submit these data as part of a PAES (see Annex II). 
• 
The population was not stratified for EGFR/ALK alterations, and the mutational status is unknown 
in about 60% of the overall population. The low number of positive patients is described in section 
5.1 of the SmPC to highlight the limited data available. No further analysis of EGFR is planned in 
this study. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  weight  increased,  pruritus,  hypothyroidism,  arthralgia, 
diarrhoea, and fatigue. The number of subjects experiencing at least one grade 3-5 AE was higher 
with pembrolizumab compared to placebo but lower compared to RSD. The AEs which showed the 
greatest 
differences 
of 
prevalence 
between 
pembrolizumab 
and 
placebo  were 
pneumonia/pneumonitis  (3.3%  vs  1.9%;  RSD:  5.5%)  and  diarrhoea  (1.2%  vs  0.3%).  Grade  3-5 
hypocortisolism was observed only in pembrolizumab (5 cases, 0.9%).  
•  AEs  of  special  interest  were  mainly  immune-related  events  and  infusion-related  reactions:  the 
number of patients with at least one AEOSI was higher in pembrolizumab than placebo (39.0% vs 
12.9%) or RSD (25.5%). A similar pattern is observed for drug-related AEOSI. Even when adjusted 
for  the  exposure,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI  was  higher  in  pembrolizumab  compared  to  the  RSD. 
Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were more frequent in pembrolizumab than both placebo and 
RSD.  Adrenal  insufficiency  was  observed  in  10  patients  with  pembrolizumab  vs  0  in  placebo. 
Hypophysitis  was  only  observed  in  patients  in  pembrolizumab  (n=7,  1.2%).  Hepatitis  and 
myocarditis were more common in pembrolizumab than placebo or RSD. 
• 
The  most  frequent  SAEs  (pembrolizumab  vs  placebo)  were:  pneumonia  (2.2%  vs  1.5%), 
pneumonitis  (2.1%  vs  0.7%),  diarrhoea  (1.2%  vs  0.2%);  the  prevalence  of  these  three  AEs  was 
similar  (or  lower)  to  what  observed  in  the  RSD.  Pulmonary  embolism  was  observed  only  in  the 
pembrolizumab group (n=3, 0.5%) vs none in the placebo (but lower frequency compared to RSD). 
Assessment report  
EMA/451876/2023  
Page 111/116 
 
 
 
In general, SAEs were in line to what already known from the RSD, and the frequency was similar 
or lower in the current pembrolizumab arm compared to RSD. 
Patients who died were almost double  with pembrolizumab compared to placebo (1.9% vs 1.0%) 
but  less  than  RSD  (5.2%).  However,  it  must  be  taken  into  account  that  RSD  patients  were,  on 
average, affected by more advanced disease. Fatal AEs considered as related were more frequent in 
pembrolizumab  than  placebo  but  similar  to  RSD.  Also,  when  compared  to  pembrolizumab  in  the 
other approved adjuvant settings, a higher number of fatal AEs were recorded (n=11, 1.9% vs n=4 
0.3%). 
The  safety  profile  was  similar  in  patients  >65  years  and  <65  years,  except  for  SAEs  and 
discontinuation which were slightly more frequent in >65 years.  
• 
• 
•  AEs with fatal outcome were more frequent in male vs female (n=10, 2.5% vs n=1, 0.5%) but the 
same happened in the placebo group (1.3% vs 0.5%). It seems that male patients had more risk 
factors at baseline (age, smoking).

The number of patients in pembrolizumab arm with grade 3-5 AEs was higher in EU than in non-EU 
(37.9% vs 26.6%) and the same was observed in the placebo arm. A similar trend was observed 
for drug-related grade 3-5 AEs, for SAEs and for discontinuation due to AEs. It seems that EU 
patients had more risk factors at baseline (age, smoking).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
KEYNOTE-091 showed at the IA2 a statistically significant improvement in DFS for one year of 
adjuvant pembrolizumab vs placebo in the overall population of patients with resected Stage IB (T2a≥
4cm), II and IIIA (AJCC 7th ed) NSCLC in KEYNOTE-091 study. The results of IA3 (i.e. final DFS 
analysis) were consistent with IA2, reassuring on the stability of the benefit of pembrolizumab over 
placebo in the overall population with more mature data and longer follow-up (including relevant 
observation time after stopping treatment given the adjuvant setting), but showing also unclear less

favourable trends in some subgroups (for patients with squamous histology, PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% and 
patients without prior adjuvant chemotherapy). The indication in patients with NSCLC at high risk of 
recurrence [Stage IB (T2a≥4 cm), II, or IIIA, as defined by the AJCC 7th edition] following complete 
resection of the lung tumour AND adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy is based on numerically 
more favourable results in the population who have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy as 
compared to the ITT, suggesting relevant DFS benefit and positive OS trend (with no current 
suggestion of detriment) for pembrolizumab vs placebo. In the population treated with prior adjuvant 
chemotherapy, DFS HR point estimates for subgroups are all <1, with no subgroups driving the 
results. Although the retrospective exclusion of patients without adjuvant chemotherapy subgroup can 
at least not be regarded as optimal as the MAH failed to provide a clear rationale, it is important that 
adjuvant treatment (received or not) had been a stratification factor and as such the subgroup analysis 
was pre-specified. The MAH will submit updated OS data as part of the imposed PAES (see Annex II). 
In addition, the MAH will submit data on treatment post-progression, and particularly on the uptake 
and activity of anti-PD(L)1 in patients previously treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab. 
Overall, the safety profile in the current setting is similar to what is already known for pembrolizumab 
in general and pembrolizumab as adjuvant treatment. Higher discontinuations and higher AEOSI rate 
have been observed compared to the RSD; however, the exposure in the current study was longer 
than that in RSD, potentially explaining this finding. Discontinuations due to AEs was also overall 
similar to other studies using pembrolizumab or other anti-PD(L)1 agents with an adjuvant aim. While 
more fatal AEs were observed compared to patients receiving placebo and compared to the 
pembrolizumab in other approved adjuvant settings, when all the deaths (due to AEs and outcome 
events for efficacy evaluation) are counted, the number of patients who died in the pembrolizumab 
arm is lower compared to placebo. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Adjuvant 1-year therapy with pembrolizumab resulted in an improved benefit over placebo that can be 
considered to outweigh the toxicities of the treatment in the indication of patients with high risk of 
recurrence [Stage IB (T2a≥4cm), II and IIIA, per AJCC 7th ed] NSCLC following resection and prior 
adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda is positive in the adjuvant treatment of patients with high risk of 
recurrence [Stage IB (T2a≥4cm), II and IIIA, per AJCC 7th ed] NSCLC following resection and prior 
adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy, in accordance 
with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EC) No 357/2014, (a) an initial efficacy assessment that is 
based on surrogate endpoints, which requires verification of the impact of the intervention on clinical 
outcome or disease progression or confirmation of previous efficacy assumptions: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): in order to further characterise the efficacy of Keytruda for 
the adjuvant treatment of adults with non-small cell lung carcinoma who are at high risk of recurrence, 
the MAH should submit the results of the final OS analysis of study KEYNOTE-091. The MAH should

submit updated data on treatment post-progression, and particularly on the uptake and activity of 
anti-PD(L)1 in patients previously treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab.

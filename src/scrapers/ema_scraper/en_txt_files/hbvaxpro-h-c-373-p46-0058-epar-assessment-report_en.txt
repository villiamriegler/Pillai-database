1.  Introduction 
On 31 July 2015, the MAH submitted final clinical study report (CSR) of a paediatric study for 
HBVAXPRO, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of post-authorisation measures (i.e. FUM 089, FUM 100, FUM 
100.1) originating from HEXAVAC. 
• 
• 
• 
In FUM 089 (assessment of HXV01C study): assessment led to conclusions that the MAH 
should make efforts to measure boostability at the 10-year checkpoint after priming, as 
especially in this age the risk of Hepatitis B infection increases 
In FUM 100, the MAH commits to address this recommendation with a new immunogenicity 
study (HXV02C) 
In FUM 100.1, the MAH provided the HXV02C concept sheet, which has been endorsed by 
the CHMP. 
Since the Marketing Authorization of HEXAVAC was withdrawn on 28 June 2012, the FUM 100 of 
HEXAVAC has been transferred on the HBVAXPRO licence. 
In order to fulfil the Commitment as well as the article 46 regulation, the MAH provides the final 
CSR of the HXV02C study. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Clinical aspects 
2.1.1.  Clinical study 
HXV02C 
An open-label, controlled, multi-centre study of the immunogenicity and safety of a challenge dose 
of HBVAXPRO®5 μg to explore the anamnestic immune response in healthy children vaccinated  
10 years ago with a primary series (3 doses) of either HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-HEXA 
The study was conducted between 22 January 2014 and 18 December 2014 in 8 centers in Italy. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives were to describe the percentage of subjects with an anti-HBs concentration 
>=10 mIU/mL, one month after a challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg given at least 10 years 
later, in subjects vaccinated with 3 doses of HEXAVAC® as infants or 3 doses of INFANRIX®-HEXA 
as infants. 
Secondary objectives were to describe in subjects vaccinated with HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-
HEXA as infants and challenged with a dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg given at least 10 years later, (1) 
the level of anti-HBs antibody before and one month after a challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg, 
(2) the level of anti-HBs antibody before and one month after a challenge dose of HBVAXPRO®  
5 μg, by subsets of subjects defined according to the pre-challenge anti-HBs concentration  
(<10 mIU/mL and >=10 mIU/mL), (3) the safety profile of HBVAXPRO® 5μg. 
The primary and secondary objectives were descriptive, thus no formal statistical hypothesis was 
tested. 
Study design 
This study was an open-label, controlled, multicentre study in two cohorts defined on vaccination 
history, a 3-doses primary series of either HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-HEXA given at about 3, 5 
and 11 months of life during routine practice.

A maximum of 750 healthy preadolescents (12 to 13 years of age) were planned to be enrolled in 
the study (approximately 375 in each cohort). The recruitment in each cohort was stopped, when it 
was ascertained that 112 subjects were vaccinated in each subset of subjects defined as anti-HBs 
concentration <10 mIU/mL and >=10 mIU/mL at inclusion. For this purpose, the number of 
subjects with an anti-HBs concentration <10 mIU/mL and >=10 mIU/mL at inclusion were 
monitored during the recruitment period. 
At the time of enrolment, subjects had to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria. The Informed Consent Form was signed by the parent(s) or legal representative and 
investigator and a signed Assent form was signed by the child before the first study procedure. 
Collection of medical history and vaccination history (hexavalent primary vaccination documented 
by trade name and dates of vaccination) and physical examination were conducted at Day 0 for all 
subjects. 
A baseline number was assigned to each subject. 
Blood Sampling had to be drawn from all subjects at the following time intervals: 
•  Blood Sample 1 (BL01) prior to the challenge dose administration, at the time of Visit 1. 
•  Blood Sample 2 (BL02) between Day 21 and Day 35 following to the challenge dose 
administration, at the time of Visit 2. 
HBVAXPRO® 5μg was administered by intra muscular route in the deltoid region. 
Timeframe for the vaccinations and blood samples is summarized in Table 9.1 
Immunogenicity assays were performed after Visit 1 and Visit 2 by laboratory staff who were 
blinded for the vaccines (HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-HEXA). 
The following serology tests were performed: 
- Anti-HBs was measured before the HBVAXPRO® 5μg challenge dose (BL01) and at 21 days to 35 
days following the HBVAXPRO® 5μg challenge dose (BL02) by MEIA –AxSYM® AUSAB. 
- Hepatitis B core antibody (Anti-HBc) was measured at 21 days to 35 days following the 
HBVAXPRO® 5μg challenge dose (BL02) by MEIA – AxSYM® CORE. 
- In serum found with anti-HBc positive, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV 
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) were additionally tested by MEIA – AxSYM® HBsAg (V2) and Real-
Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) – Cobas TaqMan® HBV, respectively. 
All subjects were kept under medical surveillance for at least 20 minutes post-vaccination to collect 
all immediate adverse events. For safety follow-up, the subjects' parents or legal representatives 
received a Diary Card (DC) at Visit 1 and were informed on how to complete it from Visit 1 to Visit 
2 following the challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5μg. On the DC, the subjects’parents or legal 
representatives recorded the subjects' body temperature, the injection site and systemic reactions 
and unsolicited adverse events as described in Protocol.

All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events assessed as related to the study vaccine 
which persisted at the time of the last visit of the concerned subjects were to be followed up by the 
investigators until their complete disappearance (resolution) or stabilization. 
The maximum duration of the follow-up for a subject was 35 days post-challenge dose. 
After receipt of the subject's serology results concerning the post-challenge sample (BL02) by the 
investigator, children with an anti-HBs concentration <10 mIU/mL and with anti-HBc test negative 
were handled in accordance with the local standard practice of vaccination (ref. Piano Nazionale 
Prevenzione Vaccinale 2012-2014, Ministero della Salute) and under the participating investigator's 
responsibility. 
Study population 
The main criteria for inclusion included healthy child of either gender, vaccinated with 3 doses of 
HEXAVAC® or 3 doses of INFANRIX®-HEXA as infant (documented vaccination history), the third 
dose of HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-HEXA being administered at least 10 years prior to the 
challenge dose and no more than 3 doses of any Hepatitis B containing vaccine either alone or in 
any combination; no history of clinical diagnosis of infection due to Hepatitis B; no history or 
current close contact with known carriers of Hepatitis B virus; no known haematological, malignant 
or immunological disorder; no known sensitivity and/or allergy to any component of the study 
vaccine; no immunosuppressive condition or treatment or autoimmune disorder; no history of 
febrile illness in the past 3 days prior to the challenge dose; no high dose systemic corticosteroids 
(i.e. >=1 mg/day/kg prednisone equivalent administered orally or parenterally) given >=14 days 
in the 30 days prior to the challenge dose (inhaled, nasal or topical corticosteroids were not 
considered as systemic treatment); no receipt of inactivated vaccine in the past 14 days or live 
vaccine in the past 28 days; subject not pregnant; no participation to another clinical study during 
the present study period. 
Treatments 
During the course of the study, all children received 1 dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg at Visit 1 (Day 0), 
via intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
the percentage of subjects with anti-HBs concentrations >=10 mIU/mL measured 1 month 
(21 to 35 days) after the challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg 
Secondary endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with anti-HBs concentrations >=10 mIU/mL measured before 
the challenge dose, 
The geometric mean of anti-HBs concentrations (i.e. GMC) measured before and 1 month 
after the challenge dose, 
The geometric mean of individual anti-HBs concentration ratios (i.e. GMCR) from before to 
1 month after the challenge dose. 
From Day 0 to Day 4, the percentage of subjects with solicited injection-site adverse 
reactions (erythema, swelling and pain) and the percentage of subjects with pyrexia 
defined as body temperature >=38.0°C, 
From Day 0 to Day 14, the percentage of subjects with unsolicited injection-site adverse 
reactions and the percentage of subjects with unsolicited systemic adverse events, 
From the challenge dose to the last visit, the percentage of subjects with serious adverse 
events. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary immunogenicity analysis was performed on a Per Protocol Set (PPS): the one-month 
post-challenge percentage of subjects with anti-HBs concentrations >=10 mIU/mL was calculated 
within each cohort (HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-HEXA), together with their two-sided 95% CI.

Page 5/13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The same analysis as above was also performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) as a supportive 
analysis 
A descriptive statistical analysis was also performed for secondary immunogenicity objectives: 
•  Within each cohort, the pre-challenge percentages of subjects with an anti-HBs >=10 
mIU/mL were calculated together with their two-sided 95% CI 
•  Within each cohort and within each subset of subjects (i.e. pre-challenge anti-HBs <10 
mIU/mL and >=10 mIU/mL): 
o  The pre- and post-challenge GMC were calculated together with their two-sided 
95% CI 
o  The GMCR from pre- to post-challenge dose was calculated together with their two-
sided 95% CI. 
•  Within each subset of subjects with a pre-challenge anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL, the one month 
post-challenge percentages of subjects with an anti-HBs >=10 mIU/mL were calculated 
together with their two-sided 95% CI 
With a sample size of 100 evaluable subjects in each subset, the half width of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval was not expected to exceed 8%. 
Safety summaries were provided for each cohort and overall for the Safety Analysis Set in term of 
incidence, intensity, seriousness and causal relationship to HBVAXPRO® 5 μg for systemic adverse 
events. Systemic adverse events were analyzed according to the investigator’s relationship 
evaluation (vaccine-related or -unrelated). Injection-site adverse reactions were considered to be 
related to study vaccine. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 751 subjects were enrolled: 409 were included in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 342 in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (Table 10.1). All enrolled subjects received the challenge dose of 
HBVAXPRO® 5 μg. 
In total, 749 subjects (99.7%) completed the study: 408 subjects (99.8%) of the HEXAVAC® 
cohort and 341 subjects (99.7%) of the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. 
Table 10.1. Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 2 subjects (0.3 %) were withdrawn from the study after screening, but prior to vaccine 
administration. One subject did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria any longer (the subject 
received an inactivated vaccine in the 14 days prior to challenge dose) and one subject refused 
blood sampling.

Overall, 19 subjects (2.5%) presented at least one protocol deviation or other reason leading to 
the exclusion from the PPS: 13 subjects (3.2%) in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 6 subjects (1.8%) in 
the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (Table 10.3).

Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. 
Overall, the gender distribution was 44.1% of boys and 55.9% of girls, the mean (+/- SD) age 
when the challenge dose was administered was 11.9 (+/-0.5) years, mean weight was 44.8 (+/-
11.0) kg, and mean height was 151 (+/-9) cm. 
Overall, the median time interval between the last hexavalent vaccine dose and the challenge dose 
was 10.9 years (range 10.0; 12.3): 11.0 years (range 10.0;12.3) in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 
10.8 years (10.0;12.2) in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. 
Efficacy results 
Primary immunogenicity analysis 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) consisted of 732 subjects (97.5%): 396 subjects (96.8%) in the 
HEXAVAC® cohort and 336 subjects (98.2%) in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. 
One month after the challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg, 83.6% of subjects in HEXAVAC® cohort 
and 96.4% in INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort had anti-HBs concentration >= 10 mIU/mL (Table 11.4, 
PPS, N=732).

Comparable results were observed on the Full Analysis Set. 
Secondary immunogenicity analyses (in PPS) 
Before the challenge dose, 23.9% [95%CI: 19.7, 28.4] of subjects in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 
69.0% [95%CI: 63.8, 74.0] in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort had an anti-HBs concentration >=10 
mIU/mL. 
One month after the challenge dose the percentage of subjects with an anti-HBs >=10 mIU/mL, for 
the specific subset of subjects with a pre-challenge anti-HBs concentration <10 mIU/mL, was 
78.7% [95%CI: 73.6, 83.2] in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 88.5% [95%CI: 80.7, 93.9] in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. 
Table 11.6 (PPS, N=732) summarized the GMC and GMCR by subsets of subjects defined according 
to their pre-challenge anti-HBs concentration (<10 mIU/mL and >=10 mIU/mL): the pre-challenge 
GMC, the post-challenge GMC and the post/pre-challenge GMCR of anti-HBs concentrations were 
higher in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort, compared to the HEXAVAC® cohort.

Comparable results were observed in the Full Analysis Set. 
The weighted estimates of GMC and percentages of subjects with an anti-HBs >=10 mIU/mL one 
month after the challenge dose were also calculated (Table 11.8). 
When the same weight was given to each subset of subjects, defined as pre-challenge anti-HBs 
concentration <10 mIU/mL and >=10 mIU/mL, the post-challenge anti-HBs GMCs were also higher 
in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort, compared to the HEXAVAC® cohort. 
The weighted percentage of subjects with an anti-HBs >=10 mIU/mL one month after the 
challenge dose was 89.3% in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 94.2% in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. 
Additional information on immunogenicity results 
At Visit 2, all BL02 were tested for anti-HBc to detect any diagnosis of hepatitis B viral infection. If 
the serum was found anti-HBc positive, HBs antigen and HBV DNA were also tested. 
Among 749 subjects who had a BL02 tested for anti-HBc, 10 subjects (1.3%) were positive one 
month after receiving the challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5μg: 6 subjects (1.5%) in HEXAVAC®

cohort and 4 subjects (1.2%) in INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. All of them were found negative for 
HBsAg and for HBV DNA in the post-challenge blood sample. 
This positive anti-HBc serology was confirmed for all 10 subjects by duplicate test performed as per 
manufacturing method. 
Among these 10 subjects: 
- 3 subjects had anti-HBs concentration > 10 mIU/mL before and after the challenge dose: 1 in the 
HEXAVAC® cohort (Subject 14500, 18,4 mIU/mL and 3395 mIU/mL respectively) and 2 in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (subject 10212, 17.5 mIU/mL and 2194 mIU/mL and subject 10394, 
92.6 mIU/mL and 25720 mIU/mL respectively). 
- 5 subjects had anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL before the challenge dose and >= 10 mIU/mL after the 
challenge dose at BL02: 3 in HEXAVAC® cohort (Subject 10982, 864.4 mIU/mL ; Subject 12673, 
11.6 mIU/mL ; Subject 14227, 203.2 mIU/mL) and 2 in INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (subject 10078, 
857.9 mIU/mL and Subject 10174, 2063 mIU/mL). 
- 2 subjects in HEXAVAC® cohort had anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL before and after the 
challenge dose. 
Safety results 
The overall safety of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg on the Safety Analysis Set is presented in Table 12.2. 
In total, 751 subjects received HBVAXPRO® 5 μg, 409 previously vaccinated with HEXAVAC® and 
342 previously vaccinated with INFANRIX®-HEXA. However, one subject in the INFANRIX®-HEXA 
cohort was lost to follow-up shortly after the injection and no safety data was available. The Safety 
Analysis Set therefore consisted of 750 subjects. 
Overall, 346 subjects (46.1%) reported at least one injection-site adverse reaction or one systemic 
adverse event from Day 0 to Day 14 after the challenge dose of HBVAXPRO® 5 μg: 181 subjects 
(44.3%) in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 165 subjects (48.4%) in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort.

From Day 0 to Day 14, 305 subjects (40.7%) reported at least one injection-site adverse reaction 
in both cohorts: 159 subjects (38.9%) in the HEXAVAC® cohort, and 146 subjects (42.8%) in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. All of injection-site adverse reactions were solicited and occurred 
between Day 0 and Day 4, except for 2 subjects who reported unsolicited injection-site adverse 
reactions between Day 0 an Day 14: one subject in the HEXAVAC® cohort reported one injection-
site bruising and one injection-site swelling and one subject in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort 
reported one injection-site swelling. Most of the injection-site adverse reactions were pain at 
injection site (39.3%) and the other solicited injection-site adverse reactions were erythema and 
swelling reported by 2.4% and 3.5% of total subjects respectively. In the HEXAVAC® cohort, the 
subjects presented fewer solicited injection-site adverse reactions (total: 38.9%, erythema: 1.7%, 
swelling 1.5% and pain 38.1%) compared to the subjects in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (total: 
42.5%, erythema: 3.2%, swelling: 5.9%, pain: 40.8% subjects). Most injection-site adverse 
reactions were of mild intensity or with a size <2.5 cm. Five subjects (0.7% of the overall 
population) presented injection-site reactions of severe intensity (injection-site pain, injection-site 
bruising and injection-site swelling). 
Between Day 0 and Day 14, 88 subjects (11.7%) reported at least one systemic adverse event in 
both cohorts: 43 subjects (10.5%) in the HEXAVAC® cohort, and 45 subjects (13.2%) in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. In all subjects, the only solicited systemic adverse event from D0 to D4 
was pyrexia (i.e. body temperature >=38°C) reported by 6 subjects (0.8%) in both cohorts: one 
subject (0.2%) in the HEXAVAC® cohort (not vaccine-related) and 5 subjects (1.5%) in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (vaccine-related for 2 subjects [0.6%]). Most of systemic adverse events 
(11.6%) were unsolicited and reported by 43 subjects (10.5%) in the HEXAVAC® cohort and by 44 
subjects (12.9%) in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. Unsolicited systemic adverse events were 
headache (3.6%), oral pharyngeal pain (1.6%), nasopharyngitis (0.9%) and vomiting (0.7%). 
Between Day 0 and Day 14, vaccine-related systemic adverse events were reported by 1.9% of 
subjects after HBVAXPRO® (1.5% in the HEXAVAC cohort and 2.3% in the INFANRIX®-HEXA 
cohort). 
Three systemic adverse events started after Day 14 in the HEXAVAC® cohort, none of which were 
vaccine-related. 
From Day 0 to Visit 2, two subjects (0.3%) reported two serious adverse events: one (0.2%) in the 
HEXAVAC® cohort reported a Schwannoma of the left thigh and one (0.3%) in the INFANRIX®-
HEXA cohort reported a multiple sclerosis. None of them were considered by the investigator to be 
related to HBVAXPRO® 5 μg. 
None subject was withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. 
2.1.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The main aim of Study HXV02C was to evaluate the immune response to a challenge dose of 
Hepatitis B vaccine at Year 10 checkpoint, in healthy children fully vaccinated with HEXAVAC® or 
INFANRIX®-HEXA during their infancy with a 3-dose primary series. The study design resembles 
previous HXV01C study, which was conducted in similar setting and methodology, except that it 
was designed to evaluate the immune response to a challenge dose of Hepatitis B vaccine at Year 5 
checkpoint. 
The 10-year persistence of antibody at protective levels of >= 10 mIU/mL was more prevalent in 
subjects of INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (69.0%) than that in HEXAVAC® cohort (23.9%). Similarly, 
the pre-challenge GMCs were also lower in the HEXAVAC® cohort (7.7 mIU/ml) than in 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort (26.8 mIU/ml). These observations were consistent with previous studies 
and not unexpected. 
Consistently, the booster effect observed at Year 10 checkpoint was also lower in subjects of the 
HEXAVAC® cohort compared to those in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort: the percentage of subjects 
mounting an secondary antibody response at anti-HBs concentration >=10 mIU/mL was 83.6% in 
the HEXAVAC® cohort and 96.4% in the INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort. This corresponds to 16.4% of 
subjects in HEXAVAC® cohort and 3.6% of subjects in INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort with no 
anamnestic immune response being detected, when measured one months after the challenge 
dose; the GMC were 191.9 mIU/ml in the HEXAVAC® cohort and 1823.8 mIU/ml in the 
INFANRIX®-HEXA cohort.

It is noteworthy that similar booster effects of HBVAXPRO 5 mg, both at seroprotection rate and at 
GMC were at checkpoint of Year 5, in healthy children fully vaccinated either with 3 doses of 
HEXAVAC® or 3 doses of INFANRIX®-HEXA as infants (Study HXV01C). Thus, results of Study 
HXV02C may suggest that a proportion of children fully vaccinated with HEXAVAC® as infants 
might start loss of immunological memory. In fact, and in support of this assumption, there was 
increased proportion (21.3%) of subjects in HEXAVAC® cohort with pre-challenge anti-HBs titer 
<10 mIU/mL did not respond to challenge dose given 10 years after primary series of vaccination, 
when compared to Year 5 checkpoint (13% in total for both HBVAXPRO booster and Engerix B 
booster). However, due to the unavailability of serology results in study subjects directly after 
completion of 3 doses primary series or the residual levels of anti-HBs at enrolment in HXV02C, 
direct comparison of booster response results should be exercised with caution. 
In study HXV02C, benign breakthrough infections, characterized by isolated anti-HBc positivity 
without the development of HBsAg carriage, have occurred in 10 subjects (1.3%). Since these 
vaccines were born of HBsAg negative mothers, they very likely acquired infection after 
vaccination. It is noteworthy that 2 out of the 10 subjects (both from HEXAVAC® cohort) had 
undetectable anti-HBs before the challenge dose and did not respond to challenge dose (anti-HBs 
concentration <10mIU/mL one month after the challenge dose). The detection of anti-HBc alone in 
the absence of clinical diseases in such subjects may be the consequence of: 1) false positive test 
result; 2) occult infection with presence of HBV DNA below the detection limit of the current 
commercially available assays; 3) resolved natural infection with loss of anti-HBs. Although the 
long-term protection mechanism is largely unknown, this last point is in line with the assumption 
that is supported by a recent study (reference 1) in HBV endemic region that, the lack of a 
secondary response to a booster dose does not necessarily imply a lack of protection. 
Furthermore, the fact of nearly even split in subjects with anti-HBc between HEXAVAC and 
INFANRIX-HEXA cohorts also argues against an increased risk for Hepatitis B infection for HEXAVAC 
subjects on the basis of anti-HBs levels. 
No death or vaccine-related serious adverse event was reported during the study. No subject was 
withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. Thus, the challenge dose of HBVAXPRO 5 μg 
was well-tolerated. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The immunological memory after priming either with HEXAVAC® or INFANRIX®-HEXA during 
infancy has been demonstrated for a period of 10 years in over 80% of children. Despite the 
absence of anamnestic immune response to a challenge dose was seen in a proportion of subjects, 
no evidence of clinical hepatitis B disease and no increased risk for chronic hepatitis B infection 
were observed in this study. Therefore, children who were fully vaccinated in infancy and did not 
respond to a challenge dose of HBVAXPRO 5 µg at Year 10 appear still to be protected from chronic 
hepatitis B infection. 
The immunological data and other information support long-term protection offered by HEXAVAC® 
or INFANRIX®-HEXA during routine vaccination program. Open question remains whether and 
when the clinical breakthrough hepatitis B disease will occur in adolescents fully vaccinated as 
infants, but identification of this timeframe in low hepatitis B endemic regions appears challenging, 
and requires large surveillance studies. 
The HEXAVAC® has been withdrawn from the Market in 2012. The results of this HXV02C study 
are useful to support the validity of HBVAXPRO product information, without requiring SPC update. 
In conclusion, this PAM can be closed. No further regulatory action is required.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II and PL 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
RXULTI in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
RXULTI (brexpiprazole) is removed from the additional

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

years of authorisation. Therefore, the statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and 
that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle, is removed from the summary of product 
characteristics and the package leaflet. 
A few minor changes were also made to the PI to bring it in 
line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline 
and other relevant guideline(s).

Based on the Company Core Data Sheet of

SmPC, Annex 
Considering all available data, the CHMP agrees that the 
brexpiprazole, update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
II and PL 
cases reported are suggestive of the possibility to develop 
add information regarding Impulse-control disorders 
and section 4.8 to add the adverse reactions 
‘Gambling disorder’, ‘Impulsive behaviour’, ‘Binge 
eating’, ‘Compulsive shopping’ and ‘Compulsive 
sexual behaviour’ with a frequency ‘unknown’. The 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to clarify 
the wording regarding the posology in ‘Patients 
taking strong CYP3A4 inducers’ in SmPC section 4.2 
as requested by EMA, and to perform additional 
editorials and minor changes throughout the Product 
Information. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
impulse control disorders (ICDs) especially if brexpiprazole 
is co-administered with other medications, used off label, 
or in patients with co-morbidities. Brexpiprazole 
mechanism of action and its similarities with aripiprazole, 
despite not being alone sufficient to establish a causal 
relationship between ICDs and brexpiprazole use, are also 
suggestive of the possibility to develop gambling and other 
impulse control disorders. Accordingly, section 4.4 of the 
SmPC is updated to add information regarding Impulse-
control disorders and section 4.8 to add the adverse 
reactions ‘Gambling disorder’, ‘Impulsive behaviour’, ‘Binge 
eating’, ‘Compulsive shopping’ and ‘Compulsive sexual 
behaviour’ with a frequency ‘unknown’. The Package Leaflet 
(PL) is updated accordingly.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2017 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing Poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), 
.alpha.-hydro-.omega.-hydroxy-,15,15'-diester with N-acetyl-L-isoleucyl-L-cysteinyl-L-valyl-1-
methyl-L-tryptophyl-L-glutaminyl-L-.alpha.-aspartyl-L-tryptophylglycyl-L-alanyl-L-histidyl-L-
arginyl-L-cysteinyl-L-threonyl-2-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]acetyl-N6-carboxy-L-lysinamide cyclic 
(2.fwdarw.12)-(disulfide); where two identical synthetic peptide domains are covalently linked at 
the ends of the polyethylene glycol chain was considered justified based on preliminary clinical 
data showing improvement of parameters of haemolysis; 
• 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the complications of chronic 
haemolysis, such as abdominal pain, infection, cytopenia, and kidney malfunction, and due to 
occurrence of thrombosis and haemorrhage in different organs. Vascular complications in the 
central nervous system are the most common cause of death; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare haematological disorder. It is a clonal 
haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disease that presents with haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis and 
smooth muscle dystonias, as well as bone marrow failure in some cases.  
Patients with PNH have clonal blood cells with defective surface expression of various GPI-anchored 
proteins. GPI is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum from phosphatidylinositol through the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000051430 
Page 4/12 
 
 
 
 
 
sequential additions of monosaccharide molecules and other components via 11 reaction steps. 
Nascent GPI-anchored proteins undergo several remodelling reactions in the endoplasmic reticulum 
and the Golgi apparatus during transport to the cell surface. At the cell surface, the GPI-anchored 
proteins are primarily localized to microdomains that are rich in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol, 
termed lipid rafts. In PNH-affected cells, the first step in GPI biosynthesis is defective; as a result, PNH 
cells have defective surface expression of various GPI-anchored proteins. (Hill et al, Nat Rev Dis 
Primers. 2017 May 18;3:17028.  doi: 10.1038/nrdp.2017.28.)   
PNH cells carry a loss-of-function mutation in PIGA. PNH-linked PIGA mutations are somatic mutations, 
as patients with PNH can harbour blood cells with normal levels of GPI-anchored proteins. PIGA is 
located on Xp22.2. The X chromosome localization explains why one somatic PIGA mutation can be 
sufficient to cause GPI deficiency in most patients with PNH, as only one allele is functional in both 
men and women. The main consequences of clonal expansion of PIGA-mutant HSCs are intravascular 
haemolysis and thrombosis; bone marrow failure can develop independently and extravascular 
haemolysis only manifests under eculizumab therapy. 
Anaemia in PNH is often multifactorial and can result from a combination of haemolysis and bone 
marrow failure. Abdominal pain, back pain, oesophageal spasm, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and 
erectile dysfunction are common manifestations associated with haemolytic PNH and are often a direct 
consequence of intravascular haemolysis and the release of free haemoglobin. Disabling fatigue is a 
common feature of PNH and can be disproportionate to the degree of anaemia. Fatigue is often most 
intense during a haemolytic attack but is usually present at all times. Episodes of jaundice and 
haemoglobinuria are reported by almost 50% of patients. Patients with PNH have an increased risk of 
chronic kidney disease as a result of long-term intravascular haemolysis. Renal tubular damage can 
occur from microvascular thrombosis, accumulation of iron deposits or both. Mild-to-moderate 
pulmonary hypertension has also been reported, but the association between chronic kidney disease 
and clinically significant pulmonary hypertension is still controversial. 
The COMP continues to designate PNH as an orphan condition. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Aspaveli is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who are anaemic after treatment with a C5 inhibitor for 
at least 3 months” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria”  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by a positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition continues to be chronically debilitating and is associated with higher mortality in patients 
who do not respond to eculizumab treatment. 
Thrombosis is the most common cause of mortality in PNH (accounting for almost 50% of deaths 
before complement inhibition therapy was introduced). Anaemia in PNH is often multifactorial and can 
result from a combination of haemolysis and bone marrow failure. Disabling fatigue is a common 
feature of PNH and can be disproportionate to the degree of anaemia. It is associated with smooth 
muscle dystonia. Abdominal pain, back pain, oesophageal spasm, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and 
erectile dysfunction are common manifestations associated with haemolytic PNH and are often a direct 
consequence of intravascular haemolysis and the release of free haemoglobin. Fatigue is often most

intense during a haemolytic attack but is usually present at all times. Episodes of jaundice and 
haemoglobinuria are reported by almost 50% of patients. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided a prevalence estimate using a very limited number of publications as well as 
a reference to Orphanet which is not recommended in the current guidance. 
Table 1 
On the basis of these references the sponsor concluded that the  prevalence was between 0.005 and 
0.1 per 10,000.  
The COMP requested that the sponsor provide a more thorough prevalence calculation. In the revised 
calculation the sponsor reviewed the literature and reported on two European reports which were 
published after the Orphan Designation maintenance report was submitted in December 2020. The 
first; Hansen et al. (2020) was based on data from the Danish National Patient Register during the 
period 1977-2016. In this study, the reported prevalence proportion of PNH in Denmark in 2015 was 
0.104/10,000 persons. The second; a study by Richards et al. (2021) was based on data from the 
Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) including patients referred for screening with a 
wide range of clinical indications including PNH. Prevalence estimates concerned patients with 
detectable PNH clones in the peripheral blood. This publications estimate was 0.381/10,000 persons. 
These two European studies provide more recent evidence that PNH is a very rare condition in the EU. 
The fairly large difference in estimates from these two studies can be explained largely by differences 
in definitions of PNH and methods of data ascertainment. 
The sponsor concluded that by using a conservative approach with a very wide definition of PNH, the 
prevalence is estimated to be around 0.4/10,000 persons, which the COMP agreed with. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Currently the two products authorised for this condition are eculizumab and ravulizumab which are C5 
inhibitors. The only curative treatment for PNH is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000051430

allogeneic donors. Recent articles have highlighted some of the challenges faced with the treatment of 
this condition. Notably the issue of the two different forms of classical and PNH associated with aplastic 
anaemia have been described (Devalet et al 2015, European Journal of Haematology 95 (190–198). 
Some of the limitations of the use of eculizumab are discussed in a recent article by Lucio Luzatto in 
2016 (F1000Research 2016, 5(F1000 Faculty Rev):209 Last updated: 23 FEB 2016). In this article he 
presents in diagrammatic form some of the limitations to the use of eculizumab (please see figure 1). 
Figure 1.   
Since the introduction of eculizumab therapy, patients with PNH can live a relatively normal lifespan 
and patients with haemolytic PNH receiving eculizumab have a more favourable prognosis than 
patients with a more profound bone marrow failure component, such as aplastic anaemia. The reason 
for this difference is that eculizumab does not treat the underlying production deficit in the bone 
marrow. (Hill et al 2017) 
For completeness, the approved indications of eculizumab and ravulizumab, as reflected in the 
respective summaries of product characteristics, are as follows:  
"Soliris is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of:- Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH). Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1)"; and 
"Ultomiris is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH): - in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity. - in 
patients who are clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 
months (see section 5.1)". 
It bears recalling that the approved indication for Aspaveli is: “Aspaveli is indicated in the treatment of 
adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who are anaemic after treatment with 
a C5 inhibitor for at least 3 months”.  
The COMP considered that eculizumab and ravulizumab are satisfactory methods of treatments as the 
target patient populations of these products (in what concerns paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH)) overlap with the target patient population for which Aspaveli is intended. For both C5 inhibitors 
it is expected that a duration up to 6 months would be needed to achieve a full treatment effect. 
Aspaveli can be started already after 3 months of treatment, and there is no recommendation to stop 
treatment with eculizumab or ravulizumab at that time. Therefore, there is a full overlap with the 
patient population for the approved treatments eculizumab and ravulizumab.

Significant benefit 
During the development of pegcetaloplan, Apellis asked a specific question about maintenance of 
significant benefit in their 2017 protocol assistance procedure (EMEA/H/SA/3633/1/2017/PA/SME/III). 
COMP provided feedback that the sponsor's preliminary clinical data showed that their product 
improved haemoglobin levels in patients in whom haemolysis was not controlled by the currently 
authorised treatment for the condition. The COMP agreed that a positive outcome would support the 
significant benefit based on a clinically relevant advantage for the patients affected by the condition. 
Although C5 inhibition controls intravascular haemolysis (IVH), it does not prevent extravascular 
haemolysis (EVH) due to C3 fragment deposition on PNH RBCs, but instead increases it, leading to 
further haemolysis (Risitano et al. 2009; Risitano et al. 2019). The presence of low haemoglobin (Hb) 
levels, elevated reticulocyte counts, elevated bilirubin levels, continued need for transfusions despite 
C5 inhibition and relatively well-controlled LDH levels, and persistent patient-reported fatigue are 
indicators of ongoing disease activity.  
There is a significant medical need for an alternative treatment option in patients with PNH which 
addresses EVH due to C3 fragment deposition on PNH red blood cells (RBCs).  
Pegcetacoplan is a complement C3 inhibitor that addresses both the IVH and EVH of PNH by providing 
upstream inhibition of the complement cascade. Although eculizumab and ravulizumab share a similar 
mechanism of action, the structure and mechanism of action of pegcetacoplan is different from these 2 
therapies. It binds to human C3 and C3b, resulting in proximal inhibition of the complement cascade 
and control of both IVH and EVH, leading to additional clinical outcomes to currently used C5 inhibitors 
in patients with PNH. 
To support significant benefit the sponsor has provided clinical data from their Phase III study. Study 
APL2-302 is a Phase 3, prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label, active comparator-controlled 
study. The objective of this study was to confirm the treatment efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan 
monotherapy for the treatment of PNH in subjects aged ≥18 years who were receiving eculizumab 
therapy but continued to have Hb levels <10.5 g/dL. 
In particular, the comparative efficacy on the anaemia aspect of the condition which is not addressed 
adequately through the treatment with currently approved C5 inhibitors was presented. The primary 
endpoint analysis measured change from baseline (CFB) to Week 16 in Hb level. The between 
treatment group comparison was performed using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. 
The difference between pegcetacoplan and eculizumab mean Hb CFB to Week 16 was calculated along 
with its 2-sided 95% CI and associated P value from the MMRM model. Sensitivity and supportive 
analyses of the primary endpoint were also performed. 
For the analyses of key secondary endpoints, non-inferiority was concluded if the appropriate limit of 
the 95% 2-sided CI indicated that pegcetacoplan was non inferior to eculizumab by the defined 
noninferiority margin (NIM) for each endpoint. The key secondary endpoints were tested in a 
hierarchical manner after statistical significance was reached for the primary endpoint. 
All censoring was due to intercurrent events (ICE). Considerations for ICE were (1) any subject who 
received a transfusion, discontinued study treatment, or withdrew from the study, and (2) for any 
subject who received a transfusion or withdrew from the study, all subsequent values were set to 
missing for the following measurements: Hb value, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) level, bilirubin level, haptoglobin level, FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy)-Fatigue score, Linear Analog Scale Assessment (LASA) score, and Quality of Life 
Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ C30) score.

In Study APL2-302, pegcetacoplan demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
differences from eculizumab in efficacy outcomes in PNH patients with anaemia. 
The comparative effectiveness of pegcetacoplan vs ravulizumab in PNH patients was analysed using 
Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) analysis. After specifying eculizumab treatment as the 
anchor, MAIC results show that relative to ravulizumab, pegcetacoplan is associated with statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvements across the majority of endpoints related to Hb: 
transfusion avoidance, transfusion requirements, IVH, fatigue, and quality of life, suggesting potential 
improved benefits of switching to pegcetacoplan (instead of ravulizumab) among patients previously 
treated with eculizumab. Despite the limitations of the MAIC analysis, the clinical and haematological 
endpoints examined in this MAIC are important indicators of underlying IVH and EVH. These results 
suggest that C3 inhibition by pegcetacoplan results in broader inhibition of complement system 
activation in comparison with the C5-complement inhibitor ravulizumab. This is expected because the 
mechanism of action of ravulizumab, which is also a C5 inhibitor, is almost identical to that of 
eculizumab. Accordingly, these data conclude significant benefit of pegcetacoplan for PNH patients 
previously treated with either eculizumab or ravulizumab.  
The results show clinically important benefits of pegcetacoplan in patients not adequately controlled by 
eculizumab and ravulizumab, in improved Hb levels and a reduction in transfusion after 16 weeks of 
treatment. This supports the basis of significant benefit for the purpose of maintenance of the orphan 
designation.  
4.  COMP position adopted on 05 November 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 0.4 in 
10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the complications of chronic 
haemolysis, such as abdominal pain, cytopenias, and kidney malfunction, and due to occurrence of 
thrombosis and haemorrhage in various organs. Vascular complications in the central nervous 
system are the most common cause of death; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Aspaveli may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. Aspaveli demonstrated statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful increase in haemoglobin levels and reduced the need for transfusions as 
compared to the currently authorised products. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Aspaveli (pegcetacoplan), 
poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), .alpha.-hydro-.omega.-hydroxy-,15,15'-diester with N-acetyl-L-isoleucyl-L-

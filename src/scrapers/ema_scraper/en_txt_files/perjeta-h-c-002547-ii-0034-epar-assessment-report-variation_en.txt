benefit for Perjeta in comparison with existing therapies (Appendix 1) 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pertuzumab  (rhuMab  2C4,  Perjeta)  is  a  recombinant,  humanized  immunoglobulin  (Ig)G1κ  monoclonal 
antibody, which targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as c-erbB-2), a 
transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. By binding to the subdomain 2 epitope of 
the extracellular domain of HER2, it prevents heterodimerization of HER2 with other members of the HER 
family  (HER1,  HER3  and  HER4),  and  as  a  result,  ligand-activated  downstream  signalling  is  blocked  by 
pertuzumab.  Pertuzumab is also capable of activating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.   
Perjeta was first granted  marketing authorization in the United States (US) on 08 June 2012 and in the 
European  Union  (EU)  on  04  March  2013,  for  use  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  (Herceptin)  and 
docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The approval was based on data 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 6/120 
  
  
 
from the pivotal Phase III study, WO20698/TOC4129g (CLEOPATRA), which showed compelling evidence of 
clinical  benefit  in  patients  with  HER2-positive  MBC,  with  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant 
increase  in  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  and  overall  survival  (OS).  In  addition,  supportive  data  was 
submitted from more than 15 other clinical studies of Perjeta.   
A Type II variation was subsequently submitted in the EU on 15 August 2014 seeking an extension of the 
indication to include use of Perjeta in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with HER2-positive early breast 
cancer  (EBC),  based  on  the  results  from  two  randomized  Phase  II  studies  WO20697  (NEOSPHERE)  and 
BO22280  (TRYPHAENA).    Results  of  the  pivotal  NEOSPHERE  study  in  patients  with  HER2-positive 
inflammatory, locally advanced or EBC showed that the addition of Perjeta to standard neoadjuvant therapy 
with Herceptin and docetaxel resulted in a significantly higher rate of pathological complete response (pCR) 
compared to either Perjeta or Herceptin alone in combination with docetaxel, with little additional toxicity 
(Gianni et al, 2012). TRYPHAENA, designed as a cardiac tolerability study, evaluated Perjeta and Herceptin 
in combination with clinically established anthracycline- and non-anthracycline-based regimens; pCR was a 
secondary  endpoint.  The  pCR  rates  reported  in  this  study  compared  favorably  with  published  data.  The 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending the use of 
Perjeta in the neoadjuvant setting and this was followed by an EU Commission Decision on 28 July 2015 for 
the following indication:  
Use in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with 
HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. 
Perjeta  has  been  approved  in  more  than  100 countries  worldwide  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
HER2-positive  MBC,  and  in  more  than  80  countries  for  the  neoadjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with 
HER2-positive EBC.   
The purpose of this Type II variation is to seek approval for the use of Perjeta in the adjuvant treatment of 
patients  with  HER2-positive  EBC,  and  to  reflect  in  the  PI  the  results  of  the  study  agreed  as  Annex  IID 
obligation to the approval for the neoadjuvant indication of Perjeta granted on 28 July 2015.  
This application is based on the primary analysis of efficacy and safety data from the pivotal (confirmatory) 
Phase III study, BIG 4-11/BO25126/TOC4939g (hereafter referred to as ″APHINITY″).  This is a randomized 
multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  comparing  Perjeta  plus  Herceptin  plus  standard 
chemotherapy (Ptz+H+Chemo) versus placebo plus Herceptin plus standard chemotherapy (Pla+H+Chemo) 
as adjuvant therapy in patients with operable HER2-positive EBC.  The Applicant considers that the efficacy 
and  safety  data  from  APHINITY  submitted  with  this  Type  II  variation  support  a  positive  benefit-risk 
assessment in a population with a high unmet medical need.   APHINTY showed that the addition of 1 year 
(up to 18 cycles) of Perjeta to standard Herceptin and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting demonstrated 
a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in a setting 
with curative intent.  Based on these results, the Applicant now proposes the following revised wording of the 
indication.   
Early Breast Cancer 
Perjeta is indicated for use in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in:  
• 
the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer at high risk of 
recurrence (see section 5.1) 
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer 
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 
women worldwide. An estimated 1.7 million new breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2012 (25% of all 
cancers in women) and there were 521,900 deaths (Ferlay et al, 2015; DeSantis et al, 2015). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 7/120 
  
  
The HER2 receptor has emerged as an important target for the treatment of breast cancer. HER2 is involved 
in  regulating  cell  growth,  survival,  and  differentiation  (Sundaresan  et  al,  1999).  Amplification  and/or 
overexpression of HER2 occurs in around 15% − 20% of breast cancers (Wolff et al, 2007; Chia et al, 2008; 
Ross et al, 2009) and is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, higher rates of recurrence, and 
increased mortality (Borg et al, 1990; Ross et al, 1998; Menard et al, 2001; Brown et al, 2008; Curigliano et 
al, 2009; Ross et al, 2009).   
Current Treatment of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer 
Approval of Herceptin for adjuvant use was based on data generated from four large studies, which showed 
that adjuvant Herceptin reduces the (relative) risk of relapse by about 50% and the risk of death by about 
30% in patients with HER2-positive EBC (HERA/BO16348 [Piccart-Gebhart et al, 2005]; NSABP B-31 and 
NCCTG  N9831  [Romond  et  al,  2005];  BCIRG  006  [Slamon  et  al,  2009]).  Additional  studies  have  been 
conducted in patients with HER2-positive EBC, in which adjuvant treatment with Herceptin-based therapy 
was the control arm therapy, notably the BO20906 (BETH) and ALTTO studies (Report No.1056851 [clinical 
cut-off  date:  30 June  2013];  Piccart-Gebhart  et  al.  2016).  These  studies  showed  similar  high  rates  of 
disease-free survival (DFS) as seen in the HERA, BCIRG006, NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies.   
Perjeta also targets HER2 and when combined with Herceptin provides a more complete blockade of the 
HER2 pathway and greater anti-cancer activity. Perjeta in combination with Herceptin + Chemotherapy has 
now become the recommended standard of care in MBC and for neoadjuvant use in patients with high risk 
EBC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (NCCN Guidelines, Version 1.2017 [Gradishar et al, 2017]; European 
Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] guidelines [Senkus et al, 2015]). Apart from Herceptin and Perjeta, 
trastuzumab emtansine (ado-trastuzumab emtansine, T-DM1; Kadcyla) and lapatinib (Tykerb; Tyverb) 
are  HER2-targeted  agents  currently  approved  in  many  countries  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
HER2-positive MBC. However, neither is approved for adjuvant use in patients with EBC. In addition, results 
have been reported from a study with the investigational agent, neratinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), in the 
extended adjuvant EBC setting after completion of one year of adjuvant Herceptin (ExteNET study; Chan et 
al,  2016).  In  this  study,  extended  adjuvant  treatment  with  12  months  of  neratinib  in  patients  who  had 
previously received adjuvant Herceptin and chemotherapy, improved the 2-year IDFS rate. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Proteins and peptides are exempted 
from the need to provide an ERA, because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Neither Perjeta as finished product (420 mg concentrate for solution for infusion) including its excipients, 
poses a significant risk to the environment. 
Thus, in accordance  with the "Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use" (EMEA, 2006), the justification presented by the MAH for the not providing an ERA in the context 
of the current extension of indication, is acceptable.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
All clinical trials carried out outside the European Union meet the ethical requirements of the EU Clinical Trial 
Directive [2001/20/EC]. 
The Application is based on the APHINITY study (pivotal study). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
For the present application, the following analyses have been presented: 
• 
PK data from the APHINITY study 
•  Comparison of PK data from APHINITY with the developed popPK model for pertuzumab 
•  Comparisons  of  observed  pertuzumab  and  trastuzumab  data  from  APHINITY  with  data  from 
previous studies and indications 
•  A DDI assessment 
•  Results of an exploratory E-R analysis 
PK data from the APHINITY study 
A  total  of  72  patients  consented  to  participate  in  the  global  PK  sub-study,  of  whom  38  patients  were 
randomized  to  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  and  34  patients  were  randomized  to  Pla+H+Chemo.  The  blood 
sample collection time points were Cycle 1 pre- and post-infusion, Cycle 2 pre-infusion, Cycle 10 pre- and 
post-infusion,  and  Cycle  15  pre-  and  post-infusion.  There  were  36  PK  evaluable  patients  from  the 
Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 34 PK evaluable patients from the Pla+H+Chemo arm, defined as a patient who had 
received at least one active pertuzumab and/or trastuzumab treatment and  had at least one PK  sample 
collected. Thirty-five patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm contributed pertuzumab PK samples to the PopPK 
analysis. Summary statistics of serum pertuzumab peak and trough concentrations are summarized in the 
table below: 
Table 1 Summery of Pertuzumab Pharmacokinetic Paramerters 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 9/120 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Following IV administrations of a pertuzumab 840-mg loading dose and subsequent 420-mg maintenance 
doses,  every  3  weeks,  the  mean  observed  trough  concentrations  increased  over  time  and  the  mean 
observed  peak  concentrations  remained  roughly  equivalent  over  time.  In  this  study,  serum  pertuzumab 
exposure reached steady-state by Cycle 10. However, due to the sparse sampling design of the study, the 
onset  of  steady-state  could  not  be  assessed.  The  PK  data  in  patients  with  HER2-positive  EBC  was 
comparable to PK data observed in patients with HER2-positive MBC.  
Observed pertuzumab peak and trough serum concentrations at Cycles 1, 10, and 15 from APHINITY were 
compared with observed pertuzumab peak and trough serum concentrations at Cycles 3, 9, and 15 in the 
previous MBC trial CLEOPATRA, to assess the impact of disease stage on pertuzumab PK.  
Table 2 Pertuzumab Serum Cmin and Cmax (in the presence of Trastuzumab and/or Chemotherapy 
in Patients with EBC and MBC 
Pharmacokinetic interaction  
Of the 72 patients who participated in the global PK sub-study, 70 patients received at least one dose of 
trastuzumab (36 in Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 34 in Pla+H+Chemo arm). The blood sample collection time 
points were Cycle 1 pre- and post-infusion, Cycle 2 pre-infusion, Cycle 10 pre- and post-infusion, and Cycle 
15 pre- and post-infusion.  
In order to evaluate the impact of pertuzumab on trastuzumab Cmin or Cmax when the two antibodies 
were administered concurrently in combination with an EBC chemotherapy regimen, the exposures of the 
two drugs are summarised below:

Figure 1 Serum Cmin and Cmax of Trastuzumab with or without Pertuzumab 
Steady-state concentrations of trastuzumab from patients in the APHINITY study were compared with data 
from  a  previous  study  of  adjuvant  trastuzumab  in  patients  with  EBC.  After  confirming  a  lack  of  PK  DDI 
between pertuzumab and trastuzumab in APHINITY as summarized above, trastuzumab PK data from both 
arms  of  the  APHINITY  study  were  compared  with  historical  observed  PK  data  from  the  Study  BO16348 
(HERA). The HERA study was a pivotal, randomized Phase III study in which patients were treated with 1 
year of adjuvant trastuzumab monotherapy or placebo after completion of standard adjuvant chemotherapy 
(Report  No.  1066908).  Patients  also  received  adjuvant  hormonal  therapy  if  clinically  indicated,  after 
completion of chemotherapy. The table below shows comparable observed trastuzumab Cmin and Cmax 
between APHINITY and HERA at similar cycles.  
Table 4 Summery of Serum Cmin and Cmax of Trastuzumab (in the Presence of Chemotherapy and 
Pertuzumab or Placebo) in Two EBS Studies 
These findings further support a lack of impact of pertuzumab on trastuzumab PK. 
Following IV administrations of a trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading dose and subsequent 6 mg/kg maintenance 
doses,  every  3  weeks,  the  mean  observed  trough  concentrations  increased  over  time  and  the  mean 
observed peak concentrations remained roughly equivalent over time. In this study, serum trastuzumab 
exposure reached steady-state by Cycle 10. However, due to the sparse sampling design of the study, the 
onset of steady-state could not be assessed. Trastuzumab PK data was comparable to prior observations in 
patients with HER2-positive EBC.

Since all patients in the APHINITY study received concurrent pertuzumab and trastuzumab, the potential 
effect of trastuzumab on the PK of pertuzumab could not be assessed using data from the APHINITY 
study alone. Instead, it was assessed by comparing the observed pertuzumab concentrations in APHINITY 
with the popPK model predictions. In contrast to the APHINITY study, the majority of the PK data (>95%) 
used  to  build  the  popPK  model  came  from  patients  treated  with  pertuzumab  without  concomitant 
trastuzumab. Additionally, patients in 7 of the 12 studies in the popPK model were treated with pertuzumab 
as monotherapy (without concomitant chemotherapy or targeted therapies).  
Observed  pertuzumab  data  from  APHINITY  were  compared  to  the  observed  pertuzumab  data  from  the 
previous MBC trial CLEOPATRA, table below: 
Table 5 Summery of Serum Cmin and Cmax of Pertuzumab (in the Presence of Trastuzumab +/- 
Chemotherapy) in Patients with EBC and MBC 
Serum Cmin and Cmax in APHINITY (Cycles 1, 10, and 15) are comparable to PK data from the CLEOPATRA 
study (Cycles 3, 9, and 15). 
Paclitaxel and carboplatin  
For patients in the anthracycline cohort receiving Ptz+H with paclitaxel, a total of 18 blood samples of 5 mL 
each were needed for PK evaluation and these were collected over a period of 15 cycles (21 days/cycle). For 
patients in the non-anthracycline cohort receiving Ptz+H with docetaxel and carboplatin, a total of 20 blood 
samples of 5 mL each were needed for PK evaluation and these were collected over a period of 15 cycles (21 
days/cycle). For paclitaxel, blood samples were collected during Cycle 1 only at pre-infusion, and 3, 5, and 
24 hours after the start of infusion. For carboplatin, blood samples were collected during Cycle 1 only at 
pre-infusion, end-of-infusion, and 1, 2, 4, and 5 hours after the end-of-infusion. 
The potential effect of pertuzumab on the PK of paclitaxel and carboplatin was assessed by comparing the 
arithmetic  means  of  the  carboplatin  or  paclitaxel  plasma  Cmax  and  AUClast  in  Cycle  1  between  the 
Ptz+H+Chemo and Pla+H+Chemo treatment arms. Paclitaxel and paclitaxel metabolite PK parameters and 
90%  CI  of  the  geometric  mean  ratios  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  and  Pla+H+Chemo  treatment  arms  are 
summarized below:

Pertuzumab

The 90% CI of the mean ratio of PK parameters were wide and most probably affected by the variability in 
PK parameters and the low statistical power associated with the small sample sizes of the treatment groups. 
The results suggest that there is no impact of pertuzumab on the PK of paclitaxel, as expected since there is 
no  apparent  mechanistic  basis  for  a  PK  DDI  between  these  agents.  The  6-alpha-hydroxy  metabolite  of 
paclitaxel was also measured in the global PK substudy and there were detectable levels at 3 and 5 hours 
post-dose.  The  Cmax  of  the  paclitaxel  metabolite  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  and  Pla+H+Chemo  arms  was 
compared and the mean ratio (90% CI) was 0.882 (0.587-1.33), supporting that in addition to no impact of 
pertuzumab on the PK of paclitaxel, there is no impact on paclitaxel’s 6-alpha-hydroxy metabolite.  
Carboplatin  PK  parameters  and  90%  CIs  of  the  geometric  mean  ratios  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  and 
Pla+H+Chemo treatment arms are showed below: 
Table 7 Summery of Carboplatin PK Parameters (in the Presence of Trastuzumab) with 
Pertuzumab or without Pertuzumab (Placebo) 
Similar to paclitaxel, the 90% CI of the mean ratio of PK parameters were wide and most probably affected 
by the variability in PK parameters and the low statistical power associated with the small sample sizes of the 
treatment groups. The results suggest that there is no impact of pertuzumab on the PK of carboplatin, as 
expected since there is no apparent mechanistic basis for a PK DDI between these agents.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Perjeta  is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  that  specifically  targets  the  extracellular 
dimerization domain (subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2), and 
thereby, blocks ligand-dependent heterodimerisation of HER2 with other HER  family members, including 
EGFR, HER3 and HER4. As a result, Perjeta inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signalling through two major 
signal pathways, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition 
of these signalling pathways can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, Perjeta 
mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The Global PK Substudy included 72 patients of whom 38 were in the Ptz+H+chemo treatment arm and 35 
contributed pertuzumab concentration data for the PopPK analysis as detailed below: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 13/120 
  
  
 
 
Table 8 Summery of Pertuzumab PK Sampling and Patients Included in the Global PK Substudy 
Pertuzumab data was completely removed for 3 patients: Patient 2093020006 did not have any recorded 
pertuzumab data (no pertuzumab doses or observations), Patient 2099570001 had non-plausible PK data, 
and Patient 2469040007 had blank time records for the pertuzumab observations.  
A PK model previously developed for pertuzumab based on a large database of patients with solid tumors, 
including  MBC,  was  subjected  to  external  validation  to  examine  whether  it  is  appropriate  for  patients 
included in the APHINITY study.  
The previously developed PopPK model was built on data from 5 Phase I/Ib studies, 6 Phase II studies, and 
1 pivotal Phase III study. In contrast to the current study, the majority of the data (>95%) used to build the 
PopPK model was based on pertuzumab without concomitant trastuzumab treatment. Additionally, 7 of the 
12  studies  in  the  PopPK  model  investigated  pertuzumab  as  monotherapy  (without  concomitant 
chemotherapy or targeted therapies).  
Pertuzumab PK was described by a two-compartment linear model with a clearance (CL), central volume of 
distribution (Vc), and terminal elimination half life (t1/2) of 0.235 L/ day, 3.11 L, and 18 days, respectively. 
LBW  and  baseline  serum  albumin  (ALBU)  were  identified  as  statistically  significant  covariates  inuencing 
pertuzumab PK. 
The PopPK analysis was carried out using NONMEM (Version 7.3, ICON Development Solutions, Elicott City, 
MD,  USA).  The  NONMEM  installation  was  validated  according  to  qPharmetra  information  system  and 
information technology (ISIT) Policies. Post-processing of NONMEM  analysis results was carried out in  R 
version 3.2.2. Estimation of individual PK parameters was carried out using first order conditional estimation 
with Interaction (FOCE-I). 
Pertuzumab PK results from patients in APHINITY were compared with those predicted from the pertuzumab 
popPK  model  that  was  developed  using  data  from  481  patients  in  12  clinical  studies.  The  observed 
pertuzumab  peak  and  trough  serum  concentrations  (black  circles)  from  the  APHINITY  patients  and  the 
covariate-adjusted, model-predicted median serum concentrations for the population (green line) and the 
5th through 95th percentiles (green shaded area; 95% prediction interval) are showed in the figure below: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 14/120 
  
  
 
Figure 2 Observed versus Model-Simulated Pertuzumab Peak and Trough Concentrations in 
APHINITY 
Overall,  the  popPK  model  predicted  the  observed  serum  concentrations  of  pertuzumab  reasonably  well 
across cycles after correcting for baseline differences in weight and albumin concentrations. A slight increase 
in observed pertuzumab concentrations (minimum concentration [Cmin]) was seen in later cycles although 
the majority of the observed pertuzumab concentrations were within the 95% prediction interval. 
According to the MAH, the ability of the popPK model to predict the pertuzumab serum concentrations in the 
APHINITY study suggests that trastuzumab does not affect pertuzumab PK. These results are consistent with 
previous results from the CLEOPATRA and NEOSPHERE studies, which showed no impact of trastuzumab on 
pertuzumab PK. 
Graphical assessment of the match between observed and model predicted pertuzumab concentrations, as 
well as conditional weighted residuals, suggested an adequate fit of the model to the data, although trends 
can be seen for low pertuzumab population predictions. Diagnostic plots of observed data vs. population 
prediction (PRED) and individual prediction (IPRED)  were examined for adequate fit. Plots of conditional 
weighted residual (CWRES) versus PRED and versus time (time after last dose as well as time after first 
dose) are reported below:

Exposure-response Analysis 
To generate individual pertuzumab exposure for patients in the Ptz+H+chemo treatment arm of the Global 
PK Substudy, a simulation dataset was constructed based on estimated individual parameters for the PopPK 
model.  For  all  patients  with  at  least  one  available  valid  concentration  measurement  of  pertuzumab, 
predictions of Cmax;ss, Cmin;ss and AUCss were derived. The simulation dataset consisted of a loading dose 
and  3  maintenance  doses.  The  loading  dose,  including  infusion  duration,  was  taken  from  the  NONMEM 
dataset for each patient in the Ptz+H+chemo treatment arm in the Global PK Substudy, thereafter, 3 doses 
of  420  mg  pertuzumab  were  administered  using  a  30  minute  infusion  with  3  weeks  dosing  interval. 
Individual predictions of concentration at the end of infusion (Cmax;ss) and before next dose (Cmin;ss) 
were generated following the third maintenance dose for all patients.  
The efficacy endpoint in the exposure-efficacy analysis was the primary study endpoint, IDFS, defined as the 
time from randomization until the date of first occurrence of one of the following events: ipsilateral invasive 
breast  tumor  recurrence,  ipsilateral  local-regional  invasive  breast  cancer  recurrence,  distant  recurrence, 
contralateral invasive breast cancer, or death attributable to any cause. Patients who had not had an event 
at the time of data analysis were censored at the date they were last known to be event free. The primary 
exposure metrics used in the exposure-efficacy analysis were individual predicted Cmin;ss and AUCss.  
A total of 35 patients in the Ptz+H+chemo arm  with predicted AUCss and  Cmin;ss were included in the 
exposure-efficacy analysis.

(Ptz+H+chemo Treated Patients 
Selection of adverse events (AEs) to be included in the safety-exposure analysis was based on the APHINITY 
data (overall safety population). AEs were considered if there was a difference of ≥5% in the incidence of 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs between the Ptz+H+chemo and Pla+H+chemo arms. Furthermore, to be considered for the 
analysis, pertuzumab PK data was required for 5-10 patients experiencing the AE, and “Any Grade ≥ 3 AE" 
(incidence 64.25% in the Ptz+H+chemo arm and 57.3% in the Pla+H+chemo arm) and Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
(incidence 9.9% in th Ptz+H+chemo arm and 3.7% in the Pla+H+chemo arm) met these criteria.

According  to  the  MAH,  the  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  (any  AE)  was  similar  in  the  Pla+H+chemo  and 
Ptz+H+chemo-treated patients in the Global PK Substudy and the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was similar in 
high and low pertuzumab exposure groups (10% difference but a difference of only 1 patient in two groups). 
The  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  diarrhea  was  more  frequent  in  Ptz+H+chemo-treated  patients  than  in 
Pla+H+chemo-treated patients but the occurrence of Grade ≥3 diarrhea does not increase with increasing 
pertuzumab  exposure.  It  should  be  noted  that  grouping  of  patients  based  on  AUCss  or  Cmax;ss  was 
identical, i.e. all patients with AUCss above the median also had a Cmax;ss above the median. Hence, results 
are identical for Cmax;ss and AUCss. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
New PK data and analyses from Study BO25126 (APHINITY/BIG 4-11/TOC 4939G) have been submitted to 
support  extension  of  the  Perjeta  indication  to  include  its  use  in  combination  with  Herceptin  and 
chemotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive EBC.  
Comparing pertuzumab peak and trough serum concentrations at Cycles 1, 10, and 15 between EBC patients 
(APHINITY study) and MBC patients (CLEOPATRA study), it has been observed that, after the first cycles, 
pertuzumab mean Cmax value was slightly higher in EBC patients. This is not considerate clinically relevant, 
therefore, tumour burden not seems to affect the PK profile. 
Results  from  the  pertuzumab  popPK  model  suggest  that  trastuzumab  does  not  affect  pertuzumab  PK. 
Diagnostic plots of observed data vs. population prediction (PRED) and individual prediction (IPRED) as well 
as plots of conditional weighted residual (CWRES) versus PRED and versus time show some uncertainties in 
the model performance. Observed data vs. individual prediction plot results in the best fit and the VPC show 
a  good  fit  of  the  data.  A  systematic  lack  of  fit  can  be  excluded,  even  if  information  derived  from  the 
developed pop PK can be considered only supportive. 
Findings and analyses presented support a lack of DDI between pertuzumab and trastuzumab. No dosage 
adjustment is needed also for paclitaxel and carboplatin. 
The exposure-efficacy analysis showed that higher exposure to pertuzumab, namely higher mean AUCss 
and Cmin values, were not associated with low number of IDFS events. MAH’s conclusion on exposure-safety 
relationship are supported: no relationship is suggested from available data. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on PK data from the Global PK Substudy (APHINITY study), no dose adjustment is needed either for 
pertuzumab,  paclitaxel  or  carboplatin  when  administered  in  combination  with  trastuzumab.  Overall,  the 
clinical pharmacology data support the proposed variation application. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
An  exposure-response  analysis  was  performed  based  on  a  PopPK  model.  The  efficacy  endpoint  in  the 
exposure-efficacy analysis was the primary study endpoint, IDFS, defined as the time from randomization 
until the date of first occurrence of one of the following events: ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, 
ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral invasive breast 
cancer, or death attributable to any cause. Patients who had not had an event at the time of data analysis 
were censored at the date they were last known to be event free. The primary exposure metrics used in the

exposure-efficacy  analysis  were  individual  predicted  Cmin;ss  and  AUCss.  Results  showed  that  higher 
exposure to pertuzumab was not associated with low number of IDFS events 
The  safety-exposure  analysis  was  based  on  the  APHINITY  data  (overall  safety  population).  AEs  were 
considered if there was a difference of ≥5% in the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs between the Ptz+H+chemo 
and Pla+H+chemo arms. No relationship is suggested from available data.

2.4.2.  Main study 
The APHINITY study 
The  APHINITY  study:  Phase  III,  prospective,  two-arm  randomized,  multicenter,  multinational, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer who have 
had their primary tumor excised.  
Methods 
Study design 
The  APHINITY  study  is  an  ongoing,  Phase  III,  prospective,  two-arm  randomized,  multicenter, 
multinational,  double-blinded,  placebo-controlled  study  in  patients  with  HER2-positive  primary  breast 
cancer who have had their primary tumor excised.  
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  compare  invasive  disease-free  survival  (IDFS)  in  patients  with 
HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) randomized to adjuvant treatment with Perjeta plus Herceptin and 
chemotherapy (Ptz+H+Chemo) or placebo plus Herceptin and chemotherapy (Pla+H+Chemo).  
The  primary  tumour  had  to  be  confirmed  as  HER2-positive  by  a  central  pathology  laboratory  prior  to 
enrollment. For each individual patient, the Investigator in consultation with the patient selected one of the 
standard  anthracycline-based  or  non-anthracycline-based  regimen  defined  in  the  protocol  before 
randomization.  
A total of 4805 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms. One patient was 
excluded from all analyses due to unreliable data, resulting in a total of 4804 patients being included in 
efficacy analyses and the following treatment allocations: 
Perjeta plus Herceptin and chemotherapy (Ptz+H+Chemo) (2400 randomized patients): 
-  Herceptin: loading dose of intravenous (IV) 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg IV every three weeks 
(q3w) 
- 
Perjeta: loading dose of 840 mg/kg IV, followed by 420 mg/kg IV q3w  
Placebo plus Herceptin and chemotherapy (Pla+H+Chemo) (2404 randomized patients): 
-  Herceptin: loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV, followed by 6 mg/kg IV q3w 
- 
Placebo: IV infusion q3w 
Patients  were  stratified  according  to  nodal  status,  type  of  standard  adjuvant  chemotherapy  regimen 
(anthracycline-based versus non-anthracycline-based), hormone receptor status, geographical region and 
protocol version (Protocol A versus Protocol Version B). Protocol version (A versus B) was introduced as a 
stratification factor at the time of the first protocol amendment (Version B, dated 20 November 2012).  
Randomized  HER2-targeted  treatment  (Herceptin  plus  Perjeta  OR  Herceptin  plus  placebo)  had  to  start 
concurrently with the taxane component of chemotherapy. All patients were required to have a screening

left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)   ≥ 55%  prior  to  randomization.  Patients  receiving  anthracyclines 
were  required  to  have  an  LVEF  of  ≥ 50%  after  completion  of  anthracyclines  and  prior  to  commencing 
HER2-targeted treatment. HER2-targeted treatment was administered for a total of up to 52 weeks (i.e., 18 
cycles within 1 year).

Treatments 
The Perjeta dosing regimen used in APHINITY (i.e., 840 mg intravenous (IV) loading dose, followed by a 
maintenance dose of 420 mg IV every 3 weeks [q3w]) is the approved Perjeta dosing regimen for patients 
with HER2-positive MBC and for the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with locally advanced, inflammatory 
and EBC. Perjeta/placebo was administered for a total of 52 weeks plus a window of 3 days (i.e., maximum 
of 18 cycles within 1 year). 
Herceptin  was  administered  IV  as  an  8  mg/kg  loading  dose  followed  by  6  mg/kg  q3w.  This  regimen  is 
licensed in many countries for Herceptin in the adjuvant breast cancer setting. Herceptin was administered 
for a total of 52 weeks, plus a window of 3 days (i.e., maximum of 18 cycles within 1 year). 
The  anthracycline-based  and  non-anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  regimens  were  based  on  published 
data, clinical guidelines, and routine clinical practice, see table 12.  
Table 12 Protocol Approved Chemotherapy Regimens (Investigators’ Choice) 
All study treatments were given intravenously. 
For all regimens, the maximum allowed cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 360 mg/m2 and of epirubicin 
was 720 mg/m2.

radiotherapy and hormone therapy policies for APHINITY trial patients at their site.  
In the responses to the LOQ, radiotherapy  use  was analyzed according to surgery type (mastectomy or 
breast  conserving  surgery  [BCS])  and  according  to  nodal  status,  as  these  are  two  key  factors  which 
determine  the  need  for  adjuvant  radiotherapy.  Finally,  radiotherapy  use  has  also  been  compared  by 
geographic region.

Therapy and Central Hormone Receptor Positive Cohort (ITT Population) 
Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary objective/endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  IDFS  (Invasive  Disease-Free  Survival),  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomization to the first occurrence of one of the following events: 
- 
- 
Ipsilateral  invasive  breast  tumor  recurrence  (i.e.,  an  invasive  breast  cancer  involving  the  same 
breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion) 
Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer in the 
axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast) 
-  Distant recurrence (i.e., evidence of breast cancer in any anatomic site – other than the two above 
mentioned  sites—that  was  either  histologically  confirmed  or  clinically  diagnosed  as  recurrent 
invasive breast cancer) 
-  Death attributable to any cause including breast cancer, non-breast cancer, or unknown cause (but 
cause of death was specified if at all possible)

- 
Contralateral invasive breast cancer 
All second primary non-breast cancers and in situ carcinomas (including DCIS and LCIS) and non-melanoma 
skin cancer were excluded as an event in this endpoint. If a patient experienced an event on the same day 
as randomization their time from randomization to event was set as 1 day. Patients who did not have an 
event at the time of data analysis were censored at the date they were last known to be alive and event-free. 
Note: this definition of IDFS (which excludes second primary non-breast cancers as events) is not the same 
as IDFS defined by Hudis et al. (2007) (which includes second primary non-breast cancers as events).  
Secondary objectives/endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included IDFS-including second primary non-breast cancer (IDFS-SPNBC), 
disease-free  survival  (DFS),  overall  survival  (OS),  recurrence-free  interval  (RFI),  and  distant 
recurrence-free interval (DRFI). 
- 
IDFS-SPNBC,  was  defined  in  the  same  way  as  IDFS  but  including  second  primary  non-breast 
invasive cancer as an event (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers and in situ carcinoma 
of any site). This definition of IDFS is often the primary endpoint for breast cancer adjuvant therapy 
trials since i) it can be difficult to distinguish second primaries from breast cancer metastasis and ii) 
second cancers may be treatment related. 
-  DFS  was  defined  as  the  time  between  randomization  and  the  date  of  the  first  occurrence  of  an 
invasive  disease-free  survival  event  including  second  primary  non-breast  cancer  events  or 
contralateral or ipsilateral DCIS. Patients who did not have an event at the time of data analysis 
were censored at the date last known to be alive and event free. 
-  OS was defined as the time from randomization to death attributable to any cause.  Patients who 
were alive (including lost to follow-up) at the time of the analysis were censored at the last known 
alive date.   
- 
RFI was defined as the time between randomization and the date of local, regional or distant breast 
cancer recurrence. Patients who did not have a recurrence event at the time of data analysis were 
censored at the date last known to be alive or at date of death. 
-  DRFI  was  defined  as  the  time  between  randomization  and  the  date  of  distant  breast  cancer 
recurrence. Patients who did not have a distant recurrence event at the time of data analysis were 
censored at the date last known to be alive or at date of death. DRFI was included since distant 
recurrence was anticipated to account for the majority of first disease recurrence events based on 
previous published trials. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
An  assessment  of  breast  cancer-free  interval  (BCFI)  was  also  performed.  BCFI  was  defined  as  the  time 
between  randomization  and  the  date  of  local,  regional  or  distant  breast  cancer  recurrence,  invasive 
contralateral breast cancer or DCIS (contralateral or ipsilateral). Patients who did not have a recurrence 
event at the time of data analysis were censored at the date when they were last known to be alive or at their 
date of death. 
HRQoL was defined as symptoms of therapy, patient functioning, and global health status and assessed by 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR23, and  EQ-5D questionnaires. Patients were to  complete patient-reported 
outcome (PRO) measures until recurrence or until 36 months after randomization, regardless of whether the 
patient completed study treatment or not. The timing of the chemotherapy PRO assessment was tailored to 
the patient’s treatment regimen to ensure that PROs were assessed at key time points, namely the end of 
anthracycline  treatment  (only  in  patients  receiving  an  anthracycline-based  regimen),  the  end  of  taxane 
therapy (all patients), and the end of HER2-targeted treatment (all patients). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 28/120 
  
  
Assessment of disease 
Physical examinations were performed at screening, during the HER2-targeted treatment period (every 3 
months at a minimum) and at the end of treatment safety follow-up visit. Thereafter, physical examinations 
were performed at least every 3 months in Year 2 after the start of treatment, every 6 months during Year 
3-5, and annually during Year 6-10. 
A  mammogram  or  breast  magnetic  resonance  image  (MRI)  and  chest  X-ray/computed  tomography 
(CT)/MRI/positron emission tomography (PET) had to be completed within 6 months prior to randomization. 
Bone scan and liver imaging was performed at screening if clinically indicated to exclude metastatic disease.  
Mammograms  or  breast  MRIs  were  repeated  at  yearly  intervals,  as  per  routine  clinical  practice.  All 
mammograms/breast MRIs were bilateral, unless the patient had had a mastectomy. After the screening 
period, chest X-rays/CT/MRI/PET, bone scan, and liver imaging were only performed if clinically indicated. 
Additional  assessments  could  be  performed  at  any  time,  if  clinically  indicated  (for  suspected  disease 
recurrence).   
Patients who had disease recurrence at any time were followed for survival and new relapse events, annually 
(starting 1 year after the first relapse) until Year 10 after randomization of the last patient. Post-recurrence 
anticancer-related therapies were also collected. 
Confirmation of Disease Recurrence 
The diagnosis of a first breast cancer recurrence or second primary cancer was made only when clinical, 
radiological and laboratory findings met specific ‘acceptable’ criteria as defined in the protocol. In cases of 
diagnostic  doubt  (e.g.,  ill-defined,  palpable  mass  in  an  irradiated  breast),  histological  or  cytological 
confirmation  of  recurrence  was  to  be  obtained  whenever  possible.  If  a  patient  developed  a  suspected 
recurrence that led to death before relapse was confirmed, efforts were made to obtain an autopsy report. 
The earliest date of diagnosis of recurrent disease was recorded, based on clinical, radiological, histological 
or cytological evidence. The date of recurrence of disease was the date of the first diagnosis of a lesion (i.e., 
an objective finding), not the date of occurrence of  the first symptom. Recurrent disease included local, 
regional, distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer (see Table below). The following events were 
not  considered  recurrent  disease  as  per  protocol:  ipsilateral  and  contralateral  lobular  carcinoma  in  situ 
(LCIS); ipsilateral and contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); carcinoma in situ of the cervix; and 
basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 
Second primary non-breast malignancies had to be confirmed histologically and were reportable as SAEs 
throughout  the  study.  Myelodysplastic  syndrome  was  not  considered  a  progression  event  but  had  to  be 
reported as an SAE.

Sample size 
It is assumed that the true HR is 0.75. In order to have 80% power to identify a statistically significant 
difference on a 2-sided 5% significance level, approximately 379 IDFS events are required. 
A total of 3806 patients was initially planned assuming a 10% drop-out rate. 
During the enrollment phase, it was observed that the monthly recruitment rate was more than 50% higher 
than expected an, the proportion of patients with node-negative disease was nearly twice that expected 
based on the BCIRG 006 study, resulting in a population inconsistent with the protocol assumptions upon 
which the protocol design was based. Hence, the protocol was amended to cap recruitment of patients with 
node-negative  disease,  the  total  planned  sample  size  was  increased  to  4800  patients,  and  statistical 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 30/120 
  
  
 
 
assumptions were adjusted accordingly. The decision to amend the protocol and changes to the sample size 
were  made  on  the  basis  of  overall  recruitment  rates  into  the  study,  without  unblinding  of  any  study 
personnel.  
Original  protocol  (Version  A  dated  28  June  2011)  recruitment  rate  and  event  rate  assumptions  were  as 
follows: 
– It was foreseen when the protocol was designed that the study would enroll a similar population to the 
adjuvant Herceptin trial BCIRG 006 (Slamon et al, 2006; Slamon et al, 2009). Therefore, based on the data 
from that trial, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of IDFS at 3 years for the Herceptin control group for this study 
was estimated to be 88%, regardless of the chemotherapy regimen (with annual decreases in Kaplan–Meier 
estimates of 2% during the first year after randomization, 5% during Years 2 and 3, and 2% during Year 4 
and  beyond).    Based  on  this  and  a  projected  monthly  accrual  rate  of  0.29  patients  at  700  sites,  it  was 
estimated that with 3806 patients, enrolled in approximately 27 months, 379 IDFS events would occur at 
around 55 months. 
The  following  revised  sample  size  assumptions  became  applicable  with  Protocol  Version  B  (dated  20 
November 2012): 
–  The  annual  decrease  in  Kaplan–Meier  estimates  of  the  IDFS  function  in  the  Herceptin  control  group 
(regardless  of  the  chemotherapy  regimen)  was  anticipated  to  be  1.9%  during  the  first  year  after 
randomization, 4.5% during Year 2, 4.4% during Year 3, and 1.8% during Year 4 and beyond. Therefore, the 
Kaplan–Meier estimate of IDFS at 3 years for the Herceptin control group was 89.2%. These assumptions 
were  based  on  5-year  follow  up  data  from  BCIRG  006.  Under  the  alternative  hypothesis  and  with  the 
assumption that IDFS for both groups was exponentially distributed, the magnitude of treatment effect in 
terms of increase in IDFS at 3 years was 2.6%, meaning a Kaplan-Meier estimate of IDFS at 3 years for the 
Perjeta group of 91.8%. The smallest estimated difference detectable at a 5%, 2 sided significance level was 
HR= 0.818, under which the magnitude of treatment effect would be 1.9%. Under these assumptions, it was 
planned that 4800 patients would be enrolled over an estimated 25 months, and assuming a 10% drop-out 
rate, the 379 IDFS events required for the primary analysis would occur at 46 months. 
Randomisation 
A total of 4805 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms using a web-based 
randomization system. Patients were stratified according to nodal status (0 positive nodes and tumour ≤ 
1cm,  0  positive  nodes  and  tumour  >  1  cm,  1-3  positive  nodes,  ≥ 4  positive  nodes),  type  of  standard 
adjuvant chemotherapy regimen (anthracycline-based versus non-anthracycline-based), hormone receptor 
status  (ER  and  PgR  negative,  ER  and/or  PgR  positive),  geographical  region  (USA,  Canada/Western 
Europe/Australia-New-Zealand/South Africa) and protocol version (Protocol A versus Protocol Version B). 
Protocol  version  (A  versus  B)  was  introduced  as  a  stratification  factor  at  the  time  of  the  first  protocol 
amendment (Version B, dated 20 November 2012).  
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Pertuzumab and placebo were both given as IV. The 
formulation of the placebo pertuzumab was equivalent to pertuzumab but without the active agent.  
Unblinding  should  only  be  considered  if  deemed  essential.  For  instance,  the  sponsor  will  not  routinely 
unblind the investigator in case of for SAEs. Unblinding for ongoing safety monitoring is performed through 
an independent data-coordinating centre. All entities directly involved in the study will remain blinded until 
the final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint.

Statistical methods 
Analysis strategy:  
The  primary  analysis  takes  place  after  379  IDFS  events  have  occurred.  If  the  result  of  the  analysis  is 
statistically  significant,  then  secondary  endpoints  are  tested  in  the  following  hierarchical  order: 
IDFS-SPNBC, DFS, and OS. The secondary endpoints RFI and DRFI will be tested but not included in the 
multiplicity adjustment.  
The  primary  analysis  after  379  IDFS  events  is  the  first  interim  analysis  for  OS.  In  addition,  two  interim 
analyses will be performed approximately 4-5 years, and 7-8 years, after last patient was randomized. The 
final  OS  analysis  will  be  performed  when  640  OS  events  have  occurred.  Thus,  there  are  in  total  4  OS 
analyses. The overall alpha-level for these analyses will be controlled at 0.05 according to O’Brien-Fleming 
Lan-DeMets.   
Table 19 Planned OS Analysis Timings 
If the OS analyses are stopped early for efficacy, safety follow-up will still continue until approximately 10 
years after randomization of the last patient.  
At the time of each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th OS analysis, exploratory analyses of IDFS for the ITT population 
and in key demographic subgroups will also be performed.  
Endpoints:  
The primary endpoint as well as all secondary and exploratory endpoints are time-to-event endpoints, which 
are defined as the time from randomization to first occurrence of the relevant event.   
Analysis populations: 
ITT:    All  randomized  subjects.  Analysed  as  randomized.  All  efficacy  analyses  will  be  based  on  the  ITT 
population. 
Safety  Population:  All  randomized  subjects  who  have  received  any  amount  of  study  drug.  Analysed  as 
treated.  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population.  
Missing data handling:  
For the time-to-event analyses, patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date when they 
were last known to be alive and event-free. Randomized patients with no post-baseline data will be censored 
at the day of randomization plus 1 day. Other ways of censoring will be explored in the sensitivity analyses 
for the primary endpoint.  
Primary endpoint: 
Statistical analysis of primary endpoint:  
The  primary  endpoint,  IDFS,  defined  as  time  from  randomization  to  first  occurrence  of  either  ipsilateral 
invasive  breast  tumor  recurrence,  ipsilateral  local-regional  invasive  breast  cancer  recurrence,  distant 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

recurrence,  death,  or  contralateral invasive  breast  cancer,  will  be  compared  between  the  two treatment 
groups using the stratified log-rank test. The stratification factors are the same as the ones used in the 
randomization, apart from geographical region, which is not included. The Kaplan-Meier plot of the IDFS 
rates will be presented, and so will the hazard ratios estimated from the stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
Sensitivity analyses:  
Two  types  of  sensitivity  analyses  are  planned.  First  descriptive  analyses  to  assess  whether  there  are 
imbalances in number of assessments or in follow-up time between the two treatment arms. Then analyses 
to assess the robustness of the primary endpoint with respect to the impact of imbalances. The specific 
descriptive analyses are: 
1.  Kaplan-Meier plot of time to censoring 
2.  Number of assessments per treatment group    
3.  Reason for withdrawal 
4.  Time between event and previous assessment  
The analysis to assess robustness, all using the ITT population and the same analysis method as the primary 
analysis, unless otherwise stated, are: 
1.  Censoring patients when they begin a new anti-cancer therapy 
2.  Considered start of new anti-cancer therapy as event 
3.  Censoring patients who withdraw from the protocol-specified assessments 
4.  Considering events to have occurred at the planned assessment date for patients who have missed 
this date but relapsed or died later 
5.  Considering patients who withdraw due to toxicity as having an event one day after they were last 
known to be event free 
6.  Considering patients with incomplete follow-up according to the protocol-defined schedule as having 
an event one day after the tie they were event free  
7.  The primary analysis but without stratification 
8.  Including actual chemotherapy regimen as stratification factor instead of planned chemotherapy 
regimen  
9.  Including stratification factors reported in the IxRS system instead of the ones reported in the eCRF 
Statistical  analysis  of  secondary  endpoints:  analysed  in  analogy  with  the  primary  endpoint.  Similar 
sensitivity analyses are also planned.  
Statistical analysis of exploratory endpoints: analysed in analogy with the primary endpoint.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total of  6263  patients  were  screened  for  the  study.  Patient  enrollment  took  place  over  a  period  of  22 
months, from 08 November 2011 (first patient in) to 31 August 2013 (last patient in), in 548 centers from 
42 countries. Of the patients screened, 4805 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two 
treatment arms (2400 patients to the Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 2405 patients to the Pla+H+Chemo arm); see

Figure  10.  The  most  common  cause  of  screen  failure  was  lack  of  confirmation  of  HER2-positivity  by  the 
central laboratory, which accounted for approximately half of the screen failures. 
Figure 10 Disposition of Patients 
Of the randomized patients, 22 in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 13 in the Pla+H+Chemo did not receive any 
study treatment. In the majority of cases, in both treatment arms, the reason for not receiving any study 
treatment  was  the  patient’s  decision  to  withdraw  from  the  study.  Of  the  4805  patients  randomized,  14 
patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 24 patients in the Pla+H+Chemo arm received at least one dose of 
non-randomized  treatment  in  error.  The  14  patients  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  received  only  1  cycle  of 
placebo in error and, therefore, remain in the pertuzumab arm for safety analyses. However, the 24 patients 
in the Pla+H+Chemo arm who received at least 1 dose of pertuzumab are included in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm 
for safety analyses.

Table 20 Patient Disposition during Treatment Period by Treatment Regimen (Randomized 
Patients) 
At the time of clinical cut-off, 2368 patients (98.7%) in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm had entered the follow-up 
period, and 370 (15.4% of randomized patients) had subsequently discontinued from follow-up. Similarly, in 
the Pla+H+Chemo treatment arm 2381 patients (99.0%) had entered the follow-up period and 399 (16.6%) 
had subsequently discontinued. The main reasons for discontinuing during the follow-up period were 
withdrawal by patient (6.8% of patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm vs. 6.2% in the Pla+H+Chemo arm) and 
recurrence of disease (5.5% of patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm vs. 7.1% in the Pla+H+Chemo arm).

Recruitment 
Patient enrollment took place over a period of 22 months, from 08 November 2011 (first patient in) to 31 
August 2013 (last patient in), in 548 centers from 42 countries. The top recruiting countries were the United 
States (US), France and Germany, each recruiting more than 450 patients. Only three countries (Argentina, 
El Salvador, and Slovenia) recruited less than 10 patients. Individual centers recruited between 1 and 94 
patients. The top recruiting individual centers were in China (94 patients), South Korea (59 patients) and 
Poland (51 patients).

Conduct of the study 
There were three amendments to the study protocol. A summary of the protocol amendments, including the 
rationale and key changes, is provided in Table 22. Version A dated 28 June 2011 was the original protocol.

Summary of Protocol Amendments (Cont.) 
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were reported in relation to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and on study procedures 
and assessments. Approximately 28% of patients in each treatment arm had at least one major protocol 
deviation reported, with a similar incidence observed in the two treatment arms, regardless of the protocol 
deviation category (Table 23). The most common deviations were: time interval between definitive surgery 
for breast cancer and randomization outside protocol-specified criteria; inability to start treatment within 1 
week  of  randomization  (an  inclusion  criterion);  completion  of  all  necessary  baseline  laboratory  and 
radiographic investigations prior to randomization (an inclusion criterion); and abnormal laboratory results 
immediately prior to randomization (an exclusion criterion). 
Of  note,  one  major  protocol  deviation  led to  a  patient  being  excluded  from both  the  efficacy  and  safety 
analysis  populations.  This  patient  (Patient  2508480020)  was  excluded  after  she  had  completed  study 
treatment because she was found to have used some false personal information when consenting to the

study. The patient did this in an attempt to use her sister’s medical insurance (as she did not have medical 
insurance herself). This patient does not appear in Table 23 and no safety or efficacy data from this patient 
are included in this report, as they are considered unreliable.  
Two patients were randomized despite the presence of metastatic disease at baseline. Patient 2324810007 
did  not  start  study  treatment  and  Patient  2470700009  completed  study  treatment.  For  both  patients,  a 
decision  was  made  not  to  consider  them  as  having  an  IDFS  event  in  the  primary  analysis.  For  all  other 
efficacy endpoints, except for overall survival, the patient was censored at the date of randomization. A 
listing of patients with protocol deviations was also provided, but is not shown here.

Table 25 Randomization Stratification Factors by Treatment Regimen, ITT population Protocol: 
BIG 4-11/BO25126/TOC4939G  
Pathological characteristics of primary tumour 
The  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  patients’  breast  cancer  history.  The  majority  of 
patients had primary tumours that were at least 2 cm in diameter. Most patients (91% of patients in either 
treatment  arm)  had  tumours  that  were  HER2  3+  based  on  immunohistochemistry  and  Grade  2  or  3, 
histologically. 
Breast Cancer Surgery 
The majority of patients underwent mastectomy (53.3% vs. 55.2%). The majority of patients underwent 
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), with a median of 2 sentinel lymph nodes examined. The majority of 
patients underwent axillary dissection with a median of 15 lymph nodes examined. There were no apparent 
imbalances in lymph node surgery between treatment arms. 
Previous and Concurrent Diseases Other than Primary Breast Cancer 
The  treatment  arms  were  comparable  with  respect  to  the  proportion  of  patients  with  previous 
disorders/conditions other than breast cancer (26.8% vs. 27.9%). Infections and Infestations (6.3% vs. 
7.0%)  and  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (3.6%  vs  3.6%)  were  the  most  common  classes  of  previous 
disorders/conditions, and the incidence was similar in the two treatment arms. 
Twenty-eight patients (1.2%) vs 24 patients (1.0%) reported previous Cardiac Disorders, most commonly, 
palpitations  (8  patients  [0.3%]  vs.  2  [<0.1%]),  supraventricular  tachycardia  (2  patients  [<0.1%]  vs.  4 
[0.2%]) and myocardial infarction (2 patients [<0.1%] vs. 3 [0.1%]). All other cardiac disorders (preferred 
term) occurred in 2 or less patients.

Around 67% of patients in each treatment arm reported concurrent disorders/conditions other than breast 
cancer at baseline and there were no notable differences between the treatment arms. The most frequently 
reported  class  of  concurrent  disorders/conditions  was  vascular  disorders  (594  patients  [24.8%]  vs.  605 
[25.2%]), in particular, hypertension (523 patients [21.8%] vs. 513 [21.3%]). 
The frequency of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and/or hyperlipidemia (that are commonly 
accepted risk factors for cardiovascular disease,) was similar in the two treatment arms.

Concurrent treatments 
Adjuvant Radiotherapy 
The majority of patients in both treatment arms (72.8% vs. 72.2%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. Of 
these patients, around half received radiation to the right side and the other half to the left side (as would be 
expected). About 20% of patients received radiotherapy to the left chest wall (Table 27).

Adjuvant Hormone Therapy 
The great majority of patients with central hormone receptor-positive disease received adjuvant hormone 
therapy (1317/1508 [87.3%] vs. 1330/1551 [85.8%]; Table 28).

Numbers analysed 
Randomized Population— Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
The  primary  analysis  population  for  all  efficacy  endpoints  was  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population.  All 
randomized patients were included in the ITT population. Patients were grouped according to the treatment 
assigned at randomization. Patients who received any amount of study medication (chemotherapy, Perjeta/ 
placebo, or Herceptin) were included in the safety population. Patients were analysed as treated: patients 
who received at least one full or partial dose of Perjeta were included in the Perjeta arm; all other treated 
patients were included in the control arm.

Secondary endpoints 
As required by the SAP, since the result for the primary endpoint, IDFS, showed statistical significance, key 
secondary endpoints were tested sequentially at an overall two-sided significance level of 5% by use of a 
hierarchical testing procedure in the following order:   
1.  IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer (IDFS-SPNBC)  
2.  DFS 
3.  OS. 
RFI and DRFI were tested but not included in the multiplicity adjustment.

Results of sensitivity analyses 
Primary endpoint: 
For the patients who were censored (7.1% in Ptz+H+Chemo versus 8.7% in Pla+H+Chemo), the median 
time  to  censoring  was  45.4  months/45.5  months  for  patients  treated  with  Ptz+H+Chemo  respectively 
Pla+H+Chemo,  i.e.  there  was  no  indication  of  a  difference  in  follow-up  time,  which  is  also  seen  in  the 
Kaplan-Meier  time  of  time  to  censoring.  The  hazard  ratio  for  time  to  censoring  was  1.02  (0.96;  1.08).  
Moreover, the number of assessments appeared to be balanced between the two groups, as was the mean 
and median time from the previous assessment to the IDFS event.    
The analysis of time to censoring showed very similar median times to censoring in the two treatment arms.

Also, the number of assessments that could detect recurrence was balanced between the two arms (mean 
[SD]: 14.75 [4.04] vs. 14.79 [3.71]).

Patient-reported outcomes 
Timing of the chemotherapy PRO assessment was tailored to the patient’s treatment regimen, namely the 
end  of  anthracycline  treatment  (only  in  patients  receiving  an  anthracycline-based  regimen),  the  end  of 
taxane therapy (all patients), and the end of HER2-targeted treatment (all patients). Note that in the PRO 
outputs,  while  the  time  point  denoted  as  “Week  13”  corresponds  to  the  end  of  taxane  treatment  in  all 
patients, the actual time of this assessment depends on the type of chemotherapy. For patients receiving 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy,  the  actual  time  point  was  Week  10  or  Week  13  of  HER2-targeted 
treatment (depending on the chemotherapy regimen given). For patients receiving non-anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy (i.e., the Ptz + TCH regimen), this was Week 19 of HER2-targeted treatment.  
For the analyses of function, treatment-related symptoms, and global health status/HRQoL, as assessed by 
the scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR23 questionnaires, a difference of ≥10 points from the 
baseline score within a treatment arm is considered a clinically meaningful change. 
Key results from PRO analyses are provided below. 
•  Completion rates for all questionnaires were consistently high throughout the study (>85.0%). 
• 
Patients  experienced  a  clinically  considerable  decline  in  physical  function  (Figure  16)  and  global 
health  status  (Figure  17)  during  chemotherapy  (Week  13)  similarly  in  both  treatment  arms; 
thereafter,  scores  improved  and  returned  to  baseline  levels  during  HER2-targeted  treatment. 
Patients’ ability to conduct daily activities, as assessed by role function (Figure 18), was maintained 
in both arms over the course of study treatment. 
•  Diarrhea symptoms scores as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 were highest (i.e., worst) at the end of 
taxane treatment (Week 13) in both arms (Figure 19). The scores in both arms remained elevated 
during  the  HER2-targeted  treatment  period,  but  the  difference  from  baseline  was  clinically 
considerable  (≥  10  points)  only  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  at  the  end  of  taxane  and  during  the 
HER2-targeted  treatment  period.  Symptoms  of  fatigue,  dyspnea,  body  image,  and  systemic 
chemotherapy side effects clinically significantly deteriorated at the end of taxane treatment (Week

13) in both arms. Appetite loss showed a clinically considerable deterioration at the end of taxane 
treatment in the pertuzumab arm only. Of the patients reporting hair loss (only ~300 in each arm), 
a  clinically  considerable  deterioration  was  observed  in  patients’  upset  by  hair  loss  at  the  end  of 
taxane treatment and during HER2-targeted treatment in both arms. Around 300 patients in each 
arm recorded sexual activity. Amongst these patients, the decline in sexual enjoyment scores was 
clinically considerable for both arms at the end of taxane treatment, but only in the pertuzumab arm 
during  HER2-targeted  treatment  (after  cessation  of  chemotherapy).  Differences  in  all  other 
symptom scores were not clinically considerable.  
•  No clinically considerable differences in patient-reported treatment-related symptoms, all function 
scales,  or  global  health  status  were  observed  in  either  arm  after  cessation  of  HER2-targeted 
treatment. All returned to or remained at baseline levels during the follow-up period (Months 18, 24, 
and 36).   
• 
There were no major differences (≥ 5 percentage points) between treatment arms in the five EQ-5D 
domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Nodal status 
Patients with node-positive disease (a pre-defined subgroup) showed statistically significant benefit with 
Ptz+H+Chemo  treatment  with  IDFS  event-free  rates  of  91.99%  vs.  90.15%  at  3 years  (HR 0.77,  95%CI 
0.62,  0.96)  (KM  curve  below).  These  results  indicate  a  23%  reduction  in  risk  of  recurrence  or  death  in 
patients randomized to Ptz+H+Chemo; the event-free rates at  were 89.88% vs. 86.68%, respectively. 
In comparison, the estimated HR for IDFS for the node-negative subgroup (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.68, 1.86) did 
not show evidence of treatment benefit at this time; nor did the subgroup of patients with node-negative 
disease and a tumour > 1cm in diameter (i.e., a subset of the node-negative subgroup; HR 1.23, 95%CI 
0.72, 2.10).

Hormone receptor status 
Central hormone receptor status is another pre-specified factor of particular interest. Improved IDFS was 
observed in patients irrespective of hormone receptor status (see Forest plot). The benefit of adding Perjeta 
to  trastuzumab  and  chemotherapy  was  not  significantly  dependent  on  hormone  receptor  status,  i.e.  for 
patients with hormone receptor-negative disease the results were HR 0.76 (95%CI 0.56, 1.04) (KM curve 
below), and for patients with hormone receptor-positive disease the results showed HR 0.86 (95%CI 0.66,

HER2 subgroups 
Exploratory  analyses  were  carried  out  to  assess  potential  relationships  between  different  levels  of 
HER2-overexpression and improvements in IDFS with the addition of Perjeta to H+Chemo in the adjuvant 
setting. These subgroups were not specified in the SAP, but were documented in a separate, more detailed 
data analysis plan, finalized prior to database lock.

Table 40 
In  order  to  explore  the  potential  relationship  between  HER2-related  tumor  heterogeneity  and  the  IDFS 
hazard ratio, subgroups were defined by levels of HER2 protein overexpression, using the two main IHC 
categories (IHC2+ and IHC3+) and the percentage of cells staining positive for HER2 (using pragmatic cut 
offs of 80%, 30%, and 10%). It is important to note that the great majority of patients had IHC3+ disease; 
only 8.2% of patients in the study had IHC2+ disease, and there were only 33 IDFS events in this subgroup.

Table 41 
Similar  analyses  were  performed  based  on  HER2  gene  amplification.  Subgroups  were  defined  using  the 
HER2 FISH ratio (i.e., the number of HER2 gene copies relative to the number of signals for CEP17) with 
subgroups based on a pragmatic cutoff of 4.0 (<4.0 or ≥4.0) and by quartiles of the HER2 FISH ratio. Again, 
the majority of patients had a HER2 FISH ratio ≥4.0 with only 25.6% of patients in the subgroup with a HER2 
FISH ratio <4.0 (and 111 events in that subgroup).  
Considering HER2 protein levels, a lower HR (suggesting greater benefit) was observed for patients with 
IHC3+ disease (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62, 0.95) than for patients with IHC2+ disease (HR 1.25, 95%CI 0.63, 
2.49). Similarly, a lower HR (suggesting greater benefit) was observed for patients with greater HER2 gene 
amplification in their tumor indicated by a FISH ratio ≥4 (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.57, 0.93) compared with a FISH 
ratio <4.0 (HR 1.10, 95%CI 0.76, 1.60).

Due to the immaturity of the OS analysis, which was based on only 80 (3.3%) deaths in the Ptz+H+Chemo 
arm and 89 (3.7%) deaths in the Pla+H+Chemo arm, representing 26% of the target events for the final OS 
analysis, no conclusions on the exploratory analyses of OS within subgroups can be drawn.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Perjeta  is  already  authorised  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for  use  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  and 
docetaxel in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), who have not received previous 
anti-HER2  therapy  or  chemotherapy  for  their  metastatic  disease,  and  for  use  in  combination  with 
trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2 -positive, locally 
advanced, inflammatory, or early stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. 
The proposed new indication (as finally agreed to be restricted) is: 
Early Breast Cancer 
Perjeta is indicated for use in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in:  
• 
the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer at high risk of 
recurrence (see section 5.1) 
The proposed dose of Perjeta is unchanged. 
The efficacy of adding Perjeta to standard chemotherapy and trastuzumab is supported by the APHINITY 
study (pivotal study).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
To support the efficacy of Perjeta in the sought indication, the MAH submitted results from one single study 
(APHINITY).  The  APHINITY  study  is  an  ongoing  phase  III,  prospective,  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter, two-arm clinical study in HER2-positive operable early breast cancer. The 
eligibility criteria were generally appropriate, although the number of possible chemotherapy regimens could 
have been more limited to reduce bias. Patients were randomized 1:1 to standard chemotherapy 6-8 cycles 
(investigator’s choice) plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab or placebo (2400 patients to the Ptz+H+Chemo 
arm  and  2405  patients  to  the  Pla+H+chemo  arm)  from  08  November  2011  to  31  August  2013). 
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab or placebo was given IV 3-weekly for 52 weeks. 
The method for randomization is considered adequate. Both nodal status and hormone receptor status are 
prognostic factors for the primary endpoint, hence the stratification according to these factors is supported. 
The  two  different  adjuvant  chemotherapy  regimens  corresponds  to  potentially  different  time  points  for 
initiation  of  targeted  treatment  relative  to  surgery,  stratification  according  to  adjuvant  chemotherapy 
regimen is supported. 
The study population defined by the inclusion- and exclusion criteria is generally endorsed, as it resembles 
the patient population, who should receive adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab according to the ESMO 
guideline. However, due to the relatively high risk of recurrence in the HER2-positive population, even in 
node-negative  patients  with  tumours  <1  cm,  ESMO  recommends  to  consider  anti-HER2  treatment, 
particularly in case of ER-negative disease. According to the inclusion criteria of the APHINITY trial, some of 
these patients are excluded, e.g. patients with tumor size less than 0.5 cm, probably for the purpose of 
including patients with higher risk of relapse. Since it is considered not to have a significant impact on the 
trial results, it is acceptable that patients were excluded by this criterion. 
Additionally, subjects with prior malignancies within 5 years and previous chemotherapy/anti-HER2 therapy 
were excluded. This is endorsed, as it ensures a homogenous population with no late effects of previous 
cancer treatment or increased risk of recurrence or death. 
It is noted, however, that following the observation that the proportion of node-negative disease patients 
enrolled  in  the  first  year  was  nearly  twice  that  expected,  the  study  was  amended  and  the  inclusion  of 
patients with node-negative was stopped in order to have a population consistent with Study BCIRG 006, 
upon  which  assumptions  of  the  APHINITY  Study  were  based.    The  MAH  acknowledges  that  stopping 
recruitment of node-negative patients into the study have resulted in a patient population that may not be 
entirely representative of all patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, but this choice was driven by 
the intention to have a population similar to BCIRG006 study, and focusing on node-positive patients that 
were at a higher risk of relapse and in a greater need of more effective treatments. Moreover, for these 
patients  the  assumptions  were  based  on  a  more  robust  evidence  and  a  stronger  treatment  effect  was 
expected. In light of the new proposed indication, this approach is no longer an issue. Adjuvant radiotherapy 
and/or  endocrine  therapy  was  started  after  the  end  of  chemotherapy  and  in  accordance  with  protocol 
recommendations. 
The  rather  small  imbalances  recorded in  the  use  of  adjuvant  radiotherapy  and  endocrine  therapy  in  the 
APHINITY study across geographical regions are not considered to pose any major biases on the efficacy 
results of the study. 
 A total of 4 analyses of OS are planned. The first and the last of these are event driven, but for the second 
and  third  interim  analysis,  the  Applicant  has  provided  the  requested  details  regarding  the  timing  of  the 
analyses. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  invasive  disease-free  survival  (IDFS).  Secondary  endpoints  included  IDFS 
excluding  second  non-breast  malignancies  (IDFS-SPNBC);  disease-free  survival  (DFS);  overall  survival 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 63/120 
  
  
(OS);  recurrence-free  survival  (RFI);  distant  recurrence-free  interval  (DRFI);  safety  and  quality  of  life 
(QOL). The chosen endpoints were assessed clinically relevant and appropriate for an adjuvant breast cancer 
trial.  
The study had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio 0.75 for IDFS with an alpha 5% (two-sided) significance 
level. A total enrolment of 3806 patients was initially planned (Protocol A). Patients were initially stratified 
according  to  nodal  status,  adjuvant  chemotherapy  regimen,  hormone  receptor  status,  and  geographical 
region.  A sample size reassessment was done after approximately 1900 patients had been recruited at a 
pace more than 50% higher than expected (September 2012); the sample size was increased from 3806 to 
4800 patients (Protocol B), and on the basis of available data, the period of enrolment was reduced from 27 
to 25 months and the expected time for observing 379 events was estimated to be at 46 months instead of 
55 months from the date the last patient was randomized.  
Analysis of IDFS stratified according to the original randomization factors of adjuvant chemotherapy, nodal 
status, central hormone receptor status and geographical region was consistent with the primary result. 
Major protocol deviations were balanced between arms, and are not expected to have impacted the results. 
The analysis methods for the time to event endpoints are appropriate, and a series of relevant sensitivity 
analyses investigating potential for bias due to potential imbalance in assessments and follow-up time, as 
well as the robustness of the primary analysis are planned. Requested details have been provided regarding 
the  start  of  new  anti-cancer  therapy  and  there  are  no  considerable  impact  on  the  study  outcome.    The 
Applicant have clarified that 15.5% (n = 372) of patients in the Perjeta arm vs. 12.6% (n = 304) of patients 
in  the  placebo  arm  discontinued  Perjeta/placebo.  There  are  no  meaningful  imbalances  between  the  two 
arms, safety being the most common reason for premature discontinuation. 
More than 99% of patients in each arm were female, with only 11 male patients enrolled in the study. A 
quarter of the patients were recruited after protocol amendment B. In order to assess the impact of the 
changes  introduced  with  Protocol  B,  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  summarised  by  Protocol 
Version  were  to  be  provided,  as  planned.  Apart  from  a  higher  prevalence  of  Asian  patients  due  to  the 
differential  timings  in  the  approval  of  clinical  trial  application,  all  other  differences  (e.g.  higher  rate  of 
mastectomy, larger tumor size) are expected based on the decision to enroll only node-positive patients. 
The difference in 3-year IDFS appears to be driven by node-positive patients.  
Patients received both adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy according to standard practice, and 
these may differ between sites, especially the radiotherapy standard practice may vary according to local 
practices  and  available  equipment.  The  available  endocrine  therapies  are  quite  uniform  in  their  efficacy 
profiles and it is therefore less problematic if there are differences in the use and sequence of e.g. aromatase 
inhibitors,  but  the  duration  of  the  adjuvant  therapy  matters.  As  adjuvant  radiotherapy  and  endocrine 
therapy  prevent  both  local  and  distant  recurrences,  these  variations  may  present  important  biases.  The 
Applicant has provided additional information about this and after a thorough review, it is agreed that the 
rather small imbalances recorded in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy in the APHINITY 
study across geographical regions are not considered to pose any major biases on the efficacy results of the 
study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint at the time of primary analysis with 4 years of follow-up. Treatment 
with  pertuzumab  plus  trastuzumab  and  standard  chemotherapy  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in IDFS, corresponding to a 19% reduction in the risk of recurrence or death, as compared to 
placebo  plus  trastuzumab  and  standard  chemotherapy  (HR  0.81,  95%CI  0.66;  1.00,  p=0.0446)  in  the 
adjuvant setting of early breast cancer. The K-M IDFS curves tend to overlap up to 2 years. Estimates of 
IDFS event-free rates at 3 years were 94.06% vs. 93.24% in the Ptz+H+Chemo vs. Pla+H+ Chemo arms, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 64/120 
  
  
respectively, and at 4 years were 92.28% vs. 90.58%, suggesting a sustained benefit over time after the 
end of treatment (1-year duration). At this point in time 171 patients (7.1%) in the pertuzumab arm versus 
210 patients (8.7%) in the placebo arm have had an event. Of these patients, 112 patients (4.7%) vs. 139 
patients  (5.8%)  had  a  distant  recurrence  as  the  most  frequent  IDFS  event.  This  reflects  the  fact  that 
adjuvant treatment of breast cancer is aimed at preventing incurable distant recurrences and these results 
show that local recurrence is not the major issue with this disease. Most of the distant metastases were 
located in the CNS, lung, and liver. Hence, a reduction of risk of invasive disease can often be translated into 
a clinically relevant prevention of incurable disease, only amendable for palliative treatment and ultimately 
resulting  in  death.  Therefore,  considering  the  low  number  of  events  so  far,  the  results  are  considered 
clinically meaningful. Moreover, the efficacy of the addition of pertuzumab is expected to be consistent and 
may be even improved over time as more events occur, because the adding of pertuzumab have shown 
convincing improvement of efficacy in the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. 
Another issue is the known increased risk of CNS disease in the HER2-positive population, as submitted data 
show that the incidence of CNS metastases was similar in the two treatment arms (1.8% vs. 1.9%), and 
although  numbers  are  small,  this  may  reflect  poor CNS  penetration  of  the  adjuvant  treatment  including 
pertuzumab. To our knowledge, there are no conclusive data regarding the efficacy of pertuzumab in the 
CNS and therefore the activity is expected to be similar to that of trastuzumab in terms of its limited ability 
to cross the blood-brain barrier.  The Applicant provided further knowledge on the CNS efficacy of Perjeta, 
as requested. It is agreed that it may be difficult, and maybe not possible, to distinguish between the efficacy 
of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, when given concomitantly. It is considered encouraging that uptake of 
pertuzumab in CNS metastases have been observed by PET/CT in a study by Ulaner et al. 2017, however, an 
actual treatment benefit has not yet sufficiently been shown. It is agreed that the suggested additional 5 
years of follow-up time in the APHINITY study will provide valuable information on this subject, including the 
Applicant’s hypothesis that Perjeta may delay time to CNS metastases. 
The  key  secondary  endpoints  were  invasive  disease-free  survival  including  second  non-breast 
malignancies (IDFS-SPNBC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results for IDFS-SPNBC 
was similar to IDFS, and showed a clinically meaningful and statistical difference favouring the pertuzumab 
arm (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68; 0.99, p=0.0430). DFS also showed a significant benefit with the addition of 
pertuzumab (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67; 0.98, p=0.0327). Overall survival data was immature. As patients with 
recurrent disease have several treatment options, the overall survival is not expected to be affected before 
the time of the final analysis (10 years after last patient randomized), occurring in the year 2023. Moreover, 
it is not considered an issue with regard to the B/R assessment of the present application. Having in mind, 
that in the HERA trial of adjuvant trastuzumab, OS was not statistically significant until 8 years had passed, 
the submitted results are considered acceptable and as could be expected at this point in time. Importanty, 
the available data on OS and other endpoints did not raise any concerns.  
The exploratory  endpoints  were recurrence-free interval (RFI), distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), 
and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI). RFI showed a clinically significant improvement (HR 0.79, 95% CI 
0.63; 0.99, p=0.0430) as well as BCFI (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62; 0.96, p=0.0186). The DRFI did not show a 
statistically  significant  difference  between  the  arms,  probably  due  to  too  few  events  (5%  vs.  6%, 
respectively).  
Patient-reported  outcome showed a considerable decline in physical function and global health status 
during chemotherapy and the incidence was similar in both treatment arms. This is considered to be due to 
the known toxicity profile of chemotherapy and is considered confirmed by the fact that scores improved and 
returned  to  baseline  levels  after  chemotherapy  had  ended  and  patients  only  received  HER2-targeted 
treatment. Diarrhoea is a known treatment-related adverse effect of both pertuzumab and taxanes, so the 
increased incidence of diarrhoea and the effect on PRO was expectable and does seem to be manageable in 
the short period of time when both therapies were given concomitantly (9 weeks). Overall, it is considered 
encouraging that all patients returned to or remained at baseline levels during the follow-up period (Months 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018

18,  24,  and  36)  according  to  the  patient-reported  treatment-related  symptoms,  all  function  scales,  and 
global health status.  
All sensitivity analyses were in favour of the pertuzumab arm, but only some were statistically significant. 
Many of the sensitivity analyses investigated the effect of stratification with results almost identical to the 
primary analysis. In addition, the effect of discontinuation, withdrawal, and start of new anti-cancer therapy 
were  investigated  in  the  sensitivity  analyses.  As  new  anti-cancer  therapy  was  broadly  defined,  and  the 
reasons have been clarified sufficiently by the Applicant, the previous issues regarding this has now been 
resolved.  
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint IDFS, however, they were not powered to 
detect  a  statistically  significant  effect  and  was  considered  exploratory  by  the  Applicant.  Patients  with 
node-positive disease (n=3005) have a high risk of recurrence and not surprisingly, there were a markedly 
greater benefit in this subgroup (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62; 0.96). This may reflect that these high-risk patients 
get a recurrence earlier in time than other subgroups, and results show a higher number of events in this 
subgroup (12% vs 9%). Patients with node-negative disease (n=1799) have a low risk of recurrence and 
results for this subgroup was not statistically significant (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68; 1.86), however, less than 
4%  of  the  patients  have  had  an  event  and  the  confidence  intervals  are  wide. This  reflects  the  low  risk, 
although it is expected that over time, this group will probably also obtain significant benefit. As HR-positive 
disease recur later in time compared to other subgroups, this is what may be reflected by this analysis. 
Hormone  receptor-negative  patients is another high-risk subgroup (n=1722) and appeared to have a 
benefit  from  the  addition  of  pertuzumab,  however,  the  differences  were  not  significant  because  the 
confidence intervals were very wide and included 1. The number of events was 11% vs 8%, respectively, 
indicating immaturity of data. However, it is important to note that in the HERA trial, as well as in BCIRG 006 
trial,  based  on  which  the  assumptions  were  made,  the  benefit  from  the  addition  of  trastuzumab  was 
observed regardless of nodal status. Due to rate of accrual much higher than expected, and subsequent to 
the  amendments  introduced  to  the  study  design  (stop  of  the  enrolment  of  node-negative  subjects,  and 
increase of the sample size based on the inclusion of solely node-positive subjects), the target number of 
events for the primary IDFS analysis was expected to be reached earlier than initially planned. However, in 
practice it took longer to reach 379 events than estimated under both protocol A and protocol B. This is 
especially relevant for the subset of patients at lower risk of recurrence, such as node-negative patients, 
whose representativeness was also artificially reduced, and that experienced relatively few events compared 
to  node-positive  patients.  Despite  the  stop  of  the  enrolment  of  node-negative  patients,  introduced  with 
protocol amendment of 20 November 2012 (i.e. 12 months after first patient enrolled), the median follow-up 
in the node-negative subgroup (48.3 months) was only slightly longer than the overall population (45.4 
months), and the node-positive subgroup (44.5 months), and events were observed only in 3.5% of the 
patients in this subset of patients, with a rate of recurrences in node-positive subjects (10.3%) that was 
almost three times the one observed in node-negative patients.  
In conclusion, the results observed in the overall population could appear to be driven by the node-positive 
subgroup that has been artificially increased with protocol amendment. It cannot be excluded that with a 
longer follow-up, a benefit could be shown also for node-negative patients, but this is not self-evident. Even 
though exploratory analyses of treatment by subgroup interaction effects did not indicate heterogeneity of 
treatment effect, and there are no biological explanation for assuming a lower activity of pertuzumab in 
node-negative  patients,  based  on  the  available  data  and  the  observed  low-risk  of  recurrence  in  this 
subgroup  treated  with  standard  of  care  chemotherapy  +  trastuzumab,  the  need  and  the  benefit  of  dual 
anti-HER2 regimen in node-negative subjects may nevertheless be questioned. The Applicant restricted the 
initially  proposed  indication  to  adult  patients  with  HER2-positive  early  breast  cancer  "at  high  risk  of 
recurrence",  i.e.  to  the  protocol  pre-defined  subgroups  of  node-positive  or  hormone-receptor  negative 
patients, as the current results are clinically significant at this point in time due to higher risk of recurrence 
and therefore more events in these subgroups. A reference to section 5.1 was added, with the subgroup

analyses, and a clarification that high-risk patients were defined as those with node-positive or hormone 
receptor-negative disease.  
The  rather  small  imbalances  recorded in  the  use  of  adjuvant  radiotherapy  and  endocrine  therapy  in  the 
APHINITY study across geographical regions are not considered to pose any major biases on the efficacy 
results of the study. 
The Applicant proposed to extend the follow-up time by additional 5 years, because it is considered that 
within this time frame clinically relevant information could be provided. It is considered that the extended 
follow-up will be very informative both with regard to the number of relapses over time (especially in the 
CNS) and the extent of late toxicity from the adjuvant treatment. 
The data regarding HER2 protein expression levels should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample 
size, the nature of an exploratory analysis, and because the analysis was not adjusted for other prognostic 
factors such as nodal status. However, it is noted that HER2 protein expression levels could be a clinically 
relevant factor, and the subgroup analysis may become relevant the time of the final analysis. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results from the primary analysis of the APHINITY study, the efficacy of adding pertuzumab to 
standard chemotherapy and trastuzumab is not considered demonstrated in the ITT population. The study 
treatment reduced the risk of relapse or death by 19%, and as the majority of the observed relapses were 
distant, this translates into prevention of incurable disease, only amendable for palliative treatment and 
ultimately  resulting  in  death.  However,  the  borderline  statistically  significant  benefit  was  not  considered 
supported by all secondary endpoints and sensitivity analyses, and seems to be mainly driven by the highest 
risk  subgroups.  Hence,  the  efficacy  of  adding  pertuzumab  to  standard  chemotherapy  is  considered 
demonstrated  in  the  high-risk  subgroups  of  patients  with  node-positive  or  hormone-receptor-negative 
disease, where the efficacy has been significantly demonstrated to a clinically relevant extent. In addition, it 
is  considered  that  results  in  the  adjuvant  setting  may  improve  over  time  as  more  events  occur,  in  the 
context of pertuzumab’s established efficacy in the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting of breast cancer.  
In conclusion, efficacy has been demonstrated in the indication of high-risk patients with node-positive or 
hormone receptor-negative disease. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  Ptz+H+Chemo  in  the  APHINITY  study  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile of Perjeta in combination with trastuzumab and standard chemotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic 
or inoperable breast cancer, and no new or unexpected toxicities were reported. The frequency and nature 
of AEs reported were as expected for this study population, and for the treatment regimens being assessed. 
The overall incidence of primary cardiac events was < 1% of patients in both arms. 
Patient exposure 
In total, the APHINITY study provides safety data on 2364 patients exposed to Perjeta plus trastuzumab and 
standard  chemotherapy  (Ptz+H+Chemo)  in  the  adjuvant  setting.  Safety  data  have  previously  been 
submitted for more than 2000 patients treated with Perjeta alone or in combination with a range of Herceptin 
and/or chemotherapy regimens in registration-directed and supporting clinical trials in the neoadjuvant and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 67/120 
  
  
metastatic settings. In addition, it is estimated that more than 160,000 patients have received Perjeta in 
routine  clinical  practice  based  on  marketing  data,  and  includes  those  treated in  the  EBC  and  metastatic 
breast cancer setting. 
Patients  were  further  categorized  according  to  chemotherapy  regimen  received  (anthracycline-based  or 
non-anthracycline-based): 
• 
Ptz+H+Chemo (safety population, n=2364) 
o  Ptz+H+anthracycline: N=1834  
o  Ptz+H+non-anthracycline: N=528 
• 
Pla+H+Chemo (safety population, n=2405) 
o  Pla+H+anthracycline: N=1894 
o  Pla+H+non-anthracycline: N=510 
Note  that  a  total  of  2362  patients  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  were  categorized  as  receiving  an 
anthracycline-based regimen (1834 patients) or a non-anthracycline-based regimen (528 patients) but the 
number of patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo safety population was 2364 (a difference of 2 patients). Similarly, 
a  total  of  2404  patients  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo  arm  were  categorized  as  receiving  an  anthracycline-based 
regimen (1894 patients) or a non-anthracycline-based regimen (510 patients), but the number of patients 
in the Pla+H+Chemo safety population was 2405 (a difference of one patient). The reason for the difference 
is  because  a  total  of  three  patients  did  not  receive  any  carboplatin.  To  be  categorized  as  receiving  a 
non-anthracycline-based regimen, patients had to have received at least one dose of carboplatin, and have 
no exposure to anthracyclines. Patients who only received a taxane (regardless of whether they received 
Perjeta, placebo or Herceptin) could not be assigned to either the non-anthracycline or the anthracycline 
cohorts.  
At the time of the clinical cut-off for the primary analysis (19 December 2016), 2028 patients (84.5%) in the 
Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  and  2100  patients  (87.4%)  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo  arm  had  completed  treatment.  The 
remaining patients (372 [15.5%] in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 304 [12.6%] in the Pla+H+Chemo arm) did 
not complete, or never started, Perjeta or placebo treatment. 
Overall, the median duration of study treatment (64 weeks), as well as targeted treatment (55 weeks), was 
the same in both treatment arms (Table 42). Note that the duration of treatment includes 28 days after the 
last dose of study medication representing the timing of the end of study treatment visit and the reporting 
period for adverse events during the treatment period.

Adverse events leading to death 
The same proportion of patients in each treatment arm died during the study due to AEs, 18 patients (0.8%) 
vs.  20  patients  (0.8%).A  total  of  39  SAEs  in  38  patients  resulted  in  death,  of  which  two  (one  in  each 
treatment arm) were considered related to study treatment by the investigator, as summarized below (see 
also Table 47): 
• 
Patient 2438280008 (Ptz+H+Chemo): this 58-year old woman died of a malignant tongue neoplasm 
on Study Day 685. The onset of this event and the fatal outcome occurred during the post-treatment 
phase of the study. The SAE was assessed by the investigator as related to HER2-targeted therapy 
because the patient had no other apparent predisposing factors for this malignancy. 
• 
Patient 2314490002 (Pla+H+Chemo): a 58-year old woman who died suddenly of cardiac failure. She 
received four cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide, and radiotherapy to the left 
chest wall from Study Day 201 to Study Day 240. She experienced Grade 3 (NYHA III) cardiac failure 
starting approximately 2 months after completing placebo and Herceptin but recovered. This event 
was  reported  as  an  SAE  of  cardiac  failure  but  did  not  meet  the  LVEF  criteria  for  a  primary  or 
secondary cardiac event. The patient died suddenly of cardiac failure on Study Day 1373 (during the 
post-treatment phase of the study). The fatal SAE was assessed by the investigator as related to 
HER2-targeted  therapy,  and  unrelated  to  chemotherapy.  However,  the  investigator  commented, 
“cardiogenic  shock  with  sudden  cardiac  death  (known  chemotherapy 
induced  dilated 
cardiomyopathy)”.

Other serious adverse events 
The incidence of SAEs was higher in the pertuzumab arm. A total of 692 patients (29.3%) in the pertuzumab 
arm experienced 1073 SAEs, and 585 patients (24.3%) in the placebo arm experienced 883 SAEs (Table 
48).   
SAEs were reported most frequently in the following SOCs:   
• 
• 
• 
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:  11.0% vs. 10.5%. 
Infections and Infestations: 6.8% vs. 5.8%. 
Gastrointestinal disorders:  5.2% vs. 3.3%.

Table 49 Summary of Cardiac Events (Safety Population) 
A total of 25 patients met the criteria for a primary cardiac event: 17 patients (0.7%) vs. 8 patients (0.3%) 
(Table 49). Heart failure (NYHA III or IV) with an LVEF decline was reported in 15 patients (0.6%) versus 
7 patients  (0.3%).  Cardiac  death  (death  with  a  definite  or  probable  cardiac  cause)  was  reported  in 
4 patients: 2 patients (< 0.1%) vs. 2 patients (< 0.1%).   
All cardiac deaths occurred in patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. One cardiac death, 
which occurred in the placebo arm, was assessed by the investigator as related to HER2-targeted therapy. 
Cardiac deaths are presented below: 
Ptz+H+Chemo arm 
Patient 2323350003 experienced two primary cardiac events (one fatal) but no preceding asymptomatic or 
mildly symptomatic LVEF decline. This 77 year old woman had pre-existing hypertension and mitral valve 
disease.  She  received  three  cycles  of  fluorouracil  (500  mg/m2),  epirubicin  (100  mg/m2)  and 
cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2), and radiotherapy to the left breast and supraclavicular area (Study Day 
134 to 172). She experienced heart failure on Study Day 186, which resulted in permanent discontinuation 
of HER2-targeted therapy. She subsequently died on Study Day 1334 (during the post-treatment phase of 
the  study)  due  to  worsening  mitral  value  disease.  The  fatal  SAE  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
unrelated to HER2-targeted therapy, and related to the patient’s medical history of mitral value disease.   
Patient 2316620009: This 80 year old woman died from cardiogenic shock on Study Day 453.  The patient 
received four cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), and radiotherapy to the 
left breast, left supraclavicular area, left axilla and left tumor bed (from Study Day 209 to 273). Treatment 
with HER2-targeted therapy and paclitaxel was permanently discontinued due to the physician’s decision, 
with the last doses administered on Study Day 107 and Study Day 121, respectively. The fatal SAE was 
assessed by the investigator as unrelated to HER2-targeted therapy, and related to the patient’s medical 
history of mammary cancer. However, on an unspecified date, the patient’s electrocardiogram was noted to 
show acute elevation of myocardial infarction in the region of the rear wall. 
Pla+H+Chemo arm: 
Patient  2314490002:  This  58-year  old  woman  received  four  cycles  of  epirubicin  (90 mg/m2)  and 
cyclophosphamide,  and  radiotherapy  to  the left  chest  wall  from  Study  Day  201  to  Study  Day  240.    She 
experienced Grade 3 (NYHA III) cardiac failure starting approximately 2 months after completing placebo

and Herceptin but recovered. This event was reported as an SAE of cardiac failure but did not meet the LVEF 
criteria for a primary or secondary cardiac event. The patient died suddenly of cardiac failure on Study Day 
1373 (during the post-treatment phase of the study). The fatal SAE was assessed by the investigator as 
related to HER2-targeted therapy, and unrelated to chemotherapy. However, the investigator commented, 
“cardiogenic shock with sudden cardiac death (known chemotherapy induced dilated cardiomyopathy)”. 
Patient 2324510001: This 66-year old woman died of acute myocardial infarction on Study Day 1636 (during 
the post-treatment phase of the study). The patient completed HER2-targeted therapy on Study Day 442 
(18 cycles). Additionally, the patient received four cycles of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide, 
and radiotherapy to the left breast from Study Day 220 to Study Day 255. The fatal SAE was assessed by the 
investigator as unrelated to HER2-targeted therapy. 
Timing of primary cardiac events 
Almost  all  of  the  primary  cardiac  events  (16/17  events  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm,  and  7/8 events  in  the 
Pla+H+Chemo arm) were reported during the first 2 years from randomization. Two events were reported > 2 
years from randomization: one event in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm was reported approximately 3.5 years after 
randomization,  and  one  event  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo  arm  was  reported  approximately  4.5  years  after 
randomization. 
Importantly, of the 25 primary cardiac events that occurred during the APHINTY study, one occurred during 
the anthracycline treatment phase (before commencement of HER2-targeted therapy). This patient (Patient 
2327600002) was randomized to the Ptz+H+Chemo arm but since she was unable to start Perjeta treatment 
due  to  the  cardiac  event,  she  was  analyzed  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo  arm.  All  of  the  other  patients  who 
experienced primary cardiac events were analyzed in the treatment arm to which they were randomized.

j This patient was randomized to the Ptz + H + Chemo arm, but was analyzed for safety in the Pla + H + Chemo arm because the patient 
developed an acute myocardial infarction with associated LVEF decline (meeting the criteria for a primary cardiac event) during the 
anthracycline period and was withdrawn from treatment prior to receiving Perjeta. 
Updated data with cut-off date 15 may 2017 
Overall, a total of 25 patients met the criteria for a primary cardiac event: 17 patients in the pertuzumab arm 
and 8 patients in the Placebo arm. At the time of primary data cutoff (19 December 2016), 2 patients in each 
arm  had  experienced  a  fatal  cardiac  event.  Of  the  remaining  15  patients  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  and  6 
patients in the Placebo arm, 7 and 4 patients, respectively, had achieved LVEF recovery (defined as two 
consecutive LVEFs ≥50%). No additional patients had experienced a primary cardiac event and there was no 
change in the recovery rates, compared to the primary data cutoff. Therefore, 8 patients remained in the 
pertuzumab arm and 2 patients in the Placebo arm who had not died or recovered at the time of the most 
recent data cutoff (15 May 2017). Of these 8 patients, no further data is expected for 4 patients: 2 patients 
have died due to second primary cancers (Patients 23163000030 and 2316340006) and 2 have completely

withdrawn from the study (Patients 2326560005 and 2372890028). Further follow-up data may become 
available  for  4  patients  (Patients  2392330008,  2326770011,  2333880002  and  2312870022)  in  the 
pertuzumab arm. Of these 4 patients, an additional LVEF assessment (53%) has been reported for Patient 
2392330008, which meets the criteria for acute recovery. Of the 2 remaining patients in the Placebo arm 
who had not recovered at the most recent data cutoff, further follow-up data may become available for one 
patient (Patient 2439730008). The other patient (Patient 2327600002) has withdrawn from the study and 
no further follow-up data will be received. 
Table 51 Recovery from Cardiac Events (Safety Population) 
Risk factors for primary cardiac events 
Pre-defined baseline characteristics considered to be possible risk factors for a primary cardiac event were 
evaluated  in  the  individual  patients  who  developed  a  primary  cardiac  event,  and  included  anthracycline 
exposure, trastuzumab exposure, radiation exposure, age, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension 
and other cardiac conditions or medication. All of the patients who developed a primary cardiac event had at 
least one of these potential risk factors. Most patients had received anthracyclines or radiotherapy or both. 
Only one patient (Patient 2372890028) had not received prior anthracyclines or chest radiotherapy. The 
other identified risk factors in this particular patient were smoking history and coronary artery disease. 
Anthracycline exposure 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 79/120 
  
  
 
 
Table 52 Cardiac Safety Summary by Chemotherapy Regimen 
Most of the primary cardiac events were reported in patients who received anthracycline-based treatment 
(Table 52): 
• 
• 
Of  the  17  patients  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  who  experienced  a  primary  cardiac  event,  15  patients 
received 
anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy 
(88.2%), 
and 
2 patients 
received 
non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (11.8%). 
Of the 8 patients in the Pla+H+Chemo arm who experienced a primary cardiac event, 7 patients received 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  (87.5%),  and  1 patient  received  non-anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy (12.5%). 
The  great  majority  of  patients  who  received  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  did  not  experience  a 
primary cardiac event (0.8% vs. 0.4%). Although anthracycline exposure appears to be a clear risk factor for 
a primary cardiac event, the incidence of primary cardiac events was not much greater in absolute terms 
than that observed in patients treated with non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (0.4% vs. 0.2%). 
Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic LVEF declines 
Eight patients experienced both a primary cardiac event and an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic LVEF 
decline, i.e., an event that would have been counted as a secondary cardiac event had the patient not also 
experienced a primary cardiac event: 6 patients (0.3%] in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm vs. 2 patients (<0.1%] in 
the Pla+H+Chemo arm. In 5 of these 8 patients (4 patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm vs. 1 patient in the 
Pla+H+Chemo arm), the significant LVEF decline occurred prior to the primary cardiac event. The remaining 
3 patients had no such event preceding the primary cardiac event (2 patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm and 
1 patient in the Pla+H+Chemo arm).   
Secondary cardiac events 
A secondary cardiac event was defined as: 
•  Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (NYHA Class II) significant drop in LVEF defined as an absolute 
decrease of at least 10 EF points from baseline AND to below 50%, confirmed by a second LVEF 
assessment within approximately three weeks of the first significant LVEF assessment or confirmed 
by the CAB. 
A total of 131 patients experienced a secondary cardiac event (see Table 52: 64 patients (2.7%) vs. 67 
patients (2.8%). 
• 
97 patients were identified automatically from LVEF assessments: 50 patients (2.1%) vs. 47 patients 
(2.0%).

• 
34 patients were identified by the CAB: 14 patients (0.6%) vs. 20 patients (0.8%).

•  Acute myocardial infarction 
•  Severe rhythm disturbances requiring treatment

The  most  frequently  reported  severe  rhythm  disturbances  requiring  treatment  included  tachycardia  (12 
patients  [0.5%]  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  vs.  14 patients  [0.6%]  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo),  atrial  fibrillation 
(8 patients [0.3%] vs. 10 patients [0.4%], respectively), syncope (9 patients [0.4%] vs. 3 patients [0.1%], 
respectively), and palpitations (6 patients [0.3%] vs. 8 patients [0.3%], respectively). The majority of the 
severe rhythm disturbances requiring treatment occurred in patients treated with an anthracycline-based 
regimen.

The incidence of all syncope events regardless of requirement for treatment showed a very small difference 
between arms, even smaller for  ≥ Grade 3. Of the patients requiring treatment for syncope, for the majority 
of  patients  (8  out  of  9  patients)  in  the  pertuzumab  arm,  the  syncopal  event  appeared  to  have  been 
associated  with  intravascular  volume  depletion  (diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting,  dehydration,  hypotension 
and/or anaemia), and occurred during concomitant chemotherapy. None of the syncope events requiring 
treatment led to study therapy withdrawal.Withdrawal of any study medication due to other cardiac events 
occurred  in  9  patients  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  (0.4%)  vs.  8 patients  [0.3%]  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo  arm. 
These  figures  include  3  patients  who  withdrew  from  study  medication  before  commencement  of 
HER2-targeted therapy. Withdrawal of Ptz/Pla due to other cardiac events occurred in 5 patients in each 
arm, mainly due to myocardial infarction (2 patients in each arm).  
Changes in LVEF 
Patients had to have an LVEF of at least 55% (measured by ECHO [preferred] or MUGA scan) to enter the 
study. At baseline, the mean LVEF was 65.2% in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm, and 65.3% in the Pla+H+Chemo 
arm. Table 56 summarizes the worst on-study LVEF measurements. The worst on-study LVEF was a mean of 
7.5% lower than baseline in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm, and 7.6% lower than baseline in the Pla+H+Chemo arm.   
LVEF drops to <40% during the study occurred in 34 patients (1.4%) vs. 32 patients (1.3%). The majority 
of these patients were treated with an anthracycline-based regimen (27 vs. 30 patients). The remaining 
patients (7 vs. 2 patients) received a non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimen.   
A  total  of  133  patients  (5.7%)  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  experienced  at  least  one  significant  LVEF  drop 
(defined  as  a  drop  in  LVEF  of  at  least  10  EF  points  from  baseline  and  to  below  50%)  during  the  study 
compared with 165 patients (7.0%) in Pla+H+Chemo arm.

In both treatment arms, the majority of diarrhea events (all Grades) that started during targeted treatment 
(63.7% vs. 66.2% of events) occurred in the first 3 cycles of treatment. Less than 10% of patients in either 
treatment arm experienced diarrhea from Cycle 4 onwards, and <3% of patients from Cycle 7 onwards. The 
majority of Grade ≥ 3 events of diarrhea that started during targeted treatment also occurred in the first 
three cycles of treatment (84.4% of Grade ≥ 3 events vs. 84.1% of Grade ≥ 3 events).   
The median time from first targeted treatment to onset of a diarrhea event was 7 days vs. 10 days. On 
average, events of diarrhea lasted longer in the pertuzumab arm, median 8 days vs. median 6 days; the 
median duration of the longest event was 35 days vs. 13 days.   
The median time from first targeted treatment to onset of Grade ≥3 diarrhea was 8 days in both treatment 
arms. On average, Grade ≥3 diarrhea events lasted longer in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm (median 20 days vs. 
median 8 days); the median duration of the longest event was 22 days vs. 8 days.

The  highest  incidence  of  diarrhea  was  reported  during  the  TTTC  (taxane  treatment)  period  (61.4%  of 
patients vs. 33.8% of patients, respectively), with a decrease observed upon chemotherapy cessation in the 
PCTT (pertuzumab treatment) period (18.1% vs. 9.2% of patients, respectively). During the anthracycline 
period, diarrhea was reported in 16.1% vs. 14.7% of patients. The highest incidence of Grade ≥3 diarrhea 
was  also  reported  during  the  TTTC  period  (8.4%  vs.  2.5%  of  patients,  respectively),  followed  by  the 
anthracycline  period  (1.2%  vs.  1.3%,  respectively),  and  the  PCTT  period  (0.5%  vs.  0.2%  of  patients, 
respectively). 
For patients who experienced diarrhea, guidance per the study protocol and Perjeta label recommended 
early intervention with loperamide as well as fluid and electrolyte replacement. For the treatment of diarrhea 
AEs,  loperamide  was  administered  to  842 patients  (35.6%)  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm,  and  356  patients 
(14.8%) in the Pla+H+Chemo arm.

Infusion-related reactions (IRR) 
Overall, IRRs were experienced in 1293 patients (54.7%) vs. 1199 patients (51.3%). Grade 1−2 IRRs were 
reported in 53.1% vs 50.1% of the patients and grade ≥ 3 events were reported in 65 patients (2.7%) vs. 49 
patients  (2.1%);  there  were  no  fatal  events.  The  most  common  (≥5%)  IRRs  starting  on  the  day  of 
Perjeta/placebo infusion were fatigue (218 patients [9.2%] vs. 194 patients [8.3%], respectively), followed 
by  arthralgia  (182 patients  [7.7%]  vs.  213  patients  [9.1%]),  hot  flush  (157  patients  [6.6%]  vs. 
148 patients [6.3%]), myalgia (120 patients [5.1%] vs. 144 patients [6.2%]), and dysgeusia (119 patients 
[5.0%] vs. 100 patients [4.3%]). 
In Cycle 1, the incidence of IRRs (all Grades) starting on the day of Perjeta/placebo infusion was similar 
between  the  treatment  arms  (495  patients  [20.9%]  vs.  420  patients  [18.0%]).  Grade ≥  3  events  were

reported  in  1.2%  vs.  0.7%.  In  Cycle  2,  the  incidence  of  IRRs  (all  Grades)  starting  on  the  day  of 
Perjeta/placebo infusion was lower and also similar between the treatment arms, 13.3% vs. 12.6%. Grade 
≥ 3 events were reported in 0.3% vs. 0.4% of the patients, respectively. Serious IRR events were reported 
in 3 patients (0.1%) in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm, and 1 patient (< 0.1%) in the Pla+H+Chemo arm.   
Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity 
The most common events were hypersensitivity (3.4% vs. 2.9%) followed by drug hypersensitivity (1.3% 
vs. 0.5%).  The majority of events were Grade 1 or  2 in severity. Grade ≥ 3 events were reported in 18 
patients (0.8%) vs. 17 patients (0.7%); there were no fatal events. The highest incidence of anaphylaxis 
and hypersensitivity AEs was reported during the TTTC period, i.e. hypersensitivity (62 patients [2.6%] vs. 
50 patients [2.1%]), followed by drug hypersensitivity (22 patients [0.9%] vs. 8 patients [0.3%]).   
Serious events were reported in 15 patients (0.6%) vs. 8 patients (0.3%) and most frequently reported was 
hypersensitivity (11 patients [0.5%] vs. 3 patients [0.1%]).

Mucositis 
The most frequently reported events were stomatitis (28.4% vs. 23.8%), mucosal inflammation (23.4% vs. 
18.6%),  pharyngitis  (4.2%  vs.  3.5%),  and  mouth  ulceration  (2.9%  vs.  3.1%).  Grade  ≥  3  events  were 
reported in 115 patients (4.9%) vs. 55 patients (2.3%). None of the events had a fatal outcome. 
AEs  of  mucositis  were  more  frequently  reported  during  the  TTTC  period  (stomatitis:  17.3%  vs.  13.1%; 
mucosal  inflammation:  14.8%  vs.  10.9%),  followed  by  the  anthracycline  treatment  period  (stomatitis: 
17.3%  vs.  15.9%;  mucosal  inflammation:  13.1%  vs.  11.0%,  respectively).  During  the  PCTT  period  the 
incidence of stomatitis had fallen to approximately 2% in each arm. In the post-treatment follow-up period, 
only one event of stomatitis was reported in the placebo arm. 
Mucositis AEs which led to withdrawal from any study treatment included stomatitis (6 patients [0.3%] vs. 
1 patient  (<0.1%)),  followed  by  mucosal  inflammation  (2 patients  [<0.1%]  vs.  1 patients  [<0.1%]. 
Stomatitis led to withdrawal from Perjeta in 2 patients (<0.1%) in the pertuzumab arm only.   
The most frequently reported mucositis SAEs were gastroenteritis (8 patients [0.3%] vs. 3 patient [0.1%]), 
stomatitis (7 patients [0.3%] vs. 1 patient [<0.1%], respectively), and mucosal inflammation (4 patients 
[0.2%] vs. 1 patient [<0.1%], respectively). None of the SAEs resulted in death.

Pregnancies 
Up to the primary clinical cutoff date, 33 pregnancies were reported in 29 patients (19 pregnancies reported 
in 16 patients in the pertuzumab arm, and 14 pregnancies reported in 13 patients in the placebo arm). One 
pregnancy occurred during study treatment, and 32 pregnancies occurred during the post-treatment period 
(of these, 4 occurred within 7 months [210 days] of the last dose of study medication). Five pregnancies 
resulted in spontaneous abortions, and 4 pregnancies ended with therapeutic abortions. Nine pregnancies 
were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cutoff,  and  15  pregnancies  resulted  in  live  births.  Of  the  5 
pregnancies  that  occurred  during  or  within  7  months  of  the  last  dose  of  study  medication,  two  were

terminated, two resulted in healthy live singleton births, and one resulted in premature delivery of twins who 
subsequently died. Of the 15 live births, 5 were premature – two of these were twin births.  No reports of 
pre-natal or post-natal complications attributable to Perjeta or Herceptin were received. The incidence of 
premature  delivery  (5/20  [23.8%])  was  higher  than  expected  based  on  the  general  population 
(approximately 8% [NHS Choices 2017]), and there was also a relatively high incidence of spontaneous 
abortion  (5/20  [23.8%],  expected  rate  15-20%  [FDA  Guidance  2014]).  However,  there  was  no  major 
difference in incidence between treatment arms. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
A total of 340 patients (14.4%) vs. 368 patients (15.3%) had hepatic-related AEs. The most commonly 
reported  PTs  were  ALT  increased  (9.3%  vs.  10.1%,  respectively)  and  AST  increased  (6.1%  vs.  6.7%, 
respectively). The majority of these reported events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity; Grade ≥3 events of ALT 
increased was reported in 0.9% vs. 1.0% of patients respectively and AST increased was reported in 12 
patients (0.5%) in each arm.

Hy’s Law Definition of Drug-Induced Liver Injury 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 89/120 
  
  
 
For this study, potential cases of drug-induced liver injury were detected using the following criteria for Hy’s 
law, as defined in the Data Analysis Plan (DAP): AST and/or ALT > 3 x baseline and total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN 
at the same visit/date. Hy’s Law criteria for drug-induced liver injury require there to be no alternative cause 
for hepatic dysfunction (such as coexistent liver disease) or confounding factors such as administration of a 
known hepatotoxic agent. In the APHINITY study, all patients were scheduled to receive other potentially 
hepatotoxic agents (notably anthracyclines and/or taxanes) so only laboratory criteria were used. 
Five patients fulfilled the liver enzyme criteria for Hy’s Law according to these laboratory criteria (3 patients 
vs. 2 patients). 
All  5  patients  had  confounding  factors,  as  summarized  below,  and  in  none  of  the  patients  was  Perjeta 
considered a likely causal factor. 
With regard to the patients in the experimental arm, in one case (Patient 2316340014) the event occurred 
203  days  after  last  dose  of  study  treatment  and  the  patient  was  receiving  concomitant  treatment  with 
glatiramer  acetate  for  multiple  sclerosis.  In  Patient  2332850008  Grade  3  drug-induced  hepatitis  was 
assessed  as  unrelated  to  Perjeta,  Herceptin  and  paclitaxel,  and  related  to  simvastatin  which  was  a 
concomitant medication at study entry. The patient’s ALT and AST returned to normal despite continued 
treatment with Perjeta, Herceptin and paclitaxel. Patient 2351340011 was identified as having laboratory 
test results meeting the DAP-defined Hy’s Law criteria. The narrative relating to this patient (who does not 
appear in the listing of liver laboratory test results meeting Hy’s Law) is included below: 
• 
Patient 2351340011: this 53-year old woman started treatment with docetaxel, carboplatin, Perjeta 
and Herceptin on Study Day 1 (Cycle 1). On Study Day 6, she was found to have a raised AST of 112 
U/L (3.6 x ULN), ALT of 83 U/L (2.4 x ULN), alkaline phosphatase of 341 U/L (3.3 x ULN), and 
bilirubin of 82.08 umol/L (3.9 x ULN; Grade 3). On Study Day 9, a bone marrow biopsy was 
conducted and a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made. The investigator 
assessed this as related to pre-existing/underlying disease (unspecified). Treatment with Perjeta, 
Herceptin, docetaxel and carboplatin was permanently discontinued. By Week 4 (Study Day 38), 
only the alkaline phosphatase remained elevated at 142 U/L (1.4 x ULN). This returned to the 
normal range by Study Day 61. The patient went on to receive non-study adjuvant treatment with 
etoposide from Study Day 11 to Study Day 20 (one cycle), paclitaxel from Study Day 63 to Study 
Day 141 (12 cycles), and trastuzumab from Study Day 42 to Study Day 463 (28 cycles). 
Adverse events starting during a Perjeta/placebo infusion 
Overall, AEs started during a Perjeta/placebo infusion more frequently in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm compared to 
the Pla+H+Chemo arm (240 patients [10.2%] vs. 181 patients [7.8%], respectively). The majority of AEs 
reported  were  Grade  1 or  2  in  severity  (9.6%  vs.  7.3%).  However,  19  patients  (0.8%)  and  14 patients 
(0.6%) experienced Grade ≥3 events, respectively. No fatal events were reported.   
AEs  started  more  frequently  during  the  first  Perjeta  infusion  than  during  the  first  placebo  infusion 
(139 patients  [5.9%]  vs.  71 patients  [3.0%]).  The  majority  of  AEs  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  (129 
patients [5.5%] vs. 68 patients [2.9%]). 
The frequency of AEs that started during a second Perjeta infusion was similar to the frequency during the 
second placebo infusion (2.2% vs. 1.8%).   
Adverse events during Anthracycline treatment 
As  per  protocol,  HER2-targeted  therapy  did  not  commence  until  completion  of  anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy. Thus, during the anthracycline treatment period, patients in the Ptz+H+Chemo arm received 
exactly the same treatment (chemotherapy only) as patients in the Pla+H+Chemo arm.

EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 90/120 
  
  
Of the 95,985 AEs reported during the APHINITY study, 28.7% of AEs were reported in the Ptz+H+Chemo 
arm versus 31.7% of AEs in the Pla+H+Chemo arm during the anthracycline treatment period. 
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  experienced  at  least  one  AE  during  the  anthracycline  treatment  period. 
During the anthracycline treatment period, a similar proportion of patients experienced Grade  ≥ 3 AEs in 
both arms (39.0% vs. 39.5%). The majority of Grade  ≥ 3 AEs were in the Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders SOC (neutropenia: 13.1% vs. 12.7%). 
Adverse events during targeted therapy + taxane (TTTC) period 
Of the 95,985 AEs reported during the APHINITY study, 45.5% of AEs were reported in the Ptz+H+Chemo 
arm versus 43.6% of AEs in the Pla+H+Chemo arm during the TTTC period. 
The  most  common  AEs  (≥10%  of  patients)  reported  during  the  TTTC  period  were  diarrhea  (61.4%  vs. 
33.8%),  nausea  (24.4%  vs.  21.0%),  fatigue  (24.2%  vs.  20.7%),  anemia  (18.4%  vs.  14.0%),  myalgia 
(18.1% vs. 21.5%), arthralgia (13.3% vs. 17.8%), dysgeusia (17.3% vs. 13.4%), stomatitis (17.3% vs. 
13.1%),  rash  (15.9%  vs.  13.2%),  vomiting  (15.7%  vs.  11.6%),  epistaxis  (15.0%  vs.  11.3%),  alopecia 
(14.6%  vs.  15.3%),  mucosal  inflammation  (14.8%  vs.  10.9%),  decreased  appetite  (13.8%  vs.  8.9%), 
peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (13.4%  vs.  13.7%),  neutropenia  (11.5%  vs.  11.3%),  oedema  peripheral 
(11.0%  vs.  13.1%),  pyrexia  (12.2%  vs.  11.4%),  neuropathy  peripheral  (11.7%  vs.  11.8%),  asthenia 
(11.5% vs. 11.1%), and constipation (10.4% vs. 13.8%). 
During the TTTC period, a higher proportion of patients experienced Grade  ≥ 3 AEs (42.0% vs. 33.5%), and 
the Grade  ≥ 3 AEs commonly reported were febrile neutropenia (7.7% vs. 6.9%), neutropenia (7.1% vs. 
7.4%), anaemia (5.2% vs. 3.2%), and diarrhea (8.4% vs. 2.5%).   
Adverse events during the post-chemotherapy targeted therapy (PCTT) period 
Of the 95,985 AEs reported during the APHINITY study, 25.5% of AEs were reported in the Ptz+H+Chemo 
arm versus 24.6% of AEs in the Pla+H+Chemo arm during the PCTT period. 
The most common AEs (≥10%) reported were diarrhea (18.1% vs. 9.2%), arthralgia (15.3% vs. 16.5%), 
and pruritus (10.0% vs. 5.8%). 
A similar proportion of patients experienced Grade  ≥ 3 AEs (13.0% vs. 11.1%), most frequently ejection 
fraction decreased (1.4% vs. 1.1%), hypertension (0.8% vs. 0.7%), neutropenia (0.5% vs. 0.4%), diarrhea 
(0.5% vs. 0.2%), and neutrophil count decreased (0.4% vs. 0.2%). The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea 
events was 0.5% vs. 0.2% during the period of targeted treatment alone.   
The proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE that led to the withdrawal of Perjeta or placebo 
during  the  PCTT  period  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  arms  (125 patients  [5.3%]  vs.  110  patients 
[4.6%]).

Shifts from baseline in haematological parameters 
At baseline, patients’ laboratory values were generally within normal ranges for all laboratory parameters 
tested  (as  required  by  the  protocol).  Shifts  from  baseline  were  most  common  with  hematological 
parameters, in particular, hemoglobin and leukocytes. Table 68 summarizes the number of patients whose 
hematology values worsened during treatment, shifting to Grade ≥ 3.

Vital signs and other observations 
Performance status 
The majority of patients’ ECOG status remained unchanged during treatment. The proportion of patients 
whose ECOG status worsened at any time point during treatment was 818 patients [34.6%] vs. 751 patients 
[31.2%].  At  the  end  of  treatment,  the  ECOG  performance  status  was  worse  than  at  baseline  in  a  small 
proportion  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms:  319  patients  (13.5%)  and  261 patients  (10.9%), 
respectively.  
Vital signs 
Based on a manual review of the data, there were no major differences between the treatment arms in any 
vital sign parameters (Blood pressure, heart rate, and weight).

•  Gastrointestinal Disorders, mainly attributable to diarrhea (20 patients [0.8%] vs. 2 patients [<0.1%], 
respectively). 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  at  least  one  AE  that  led  to  the  withdrawal  of  any  study 
medication  was  similar  between  the  arms  (309  patients  [13.1%]  vs.  277  patients  [11.5%], 
respectively).The most common AEs were in the following SOCs: 
•  Nervous  System  Disorders  (63  patients  [2.7%]  vs.  54  patients  [2.2%]),  mainly  attributable  to 
peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (17  patients  [0.7%]  vs.  21  patients  [0.9%],  respectively),  and 
neuropathy peripheral (19 patients [0.8%] vs. 18 patients [0.7%], respectively). 
•  Gastrointestinal Disorders (59 patients [2.5%] vs. 21 patients [0.9%]), mainly attributable to diarrhea 
(38 patients [1.6%] vs. 7 patients [0.3%], respectively). 
•

A total of 723 patients (30.6%) vs. 632 patients (26.3%) experienced an AE leading to a dose modification 
of Perjeta or placebo (i.e., dose interruption or dose delay). The SOCs were as follows: 
•  Blood and Lymphatic Systems Disorders: 204 patients (8.6%) compared to 196 patients (8.1%), 
mainly attributable to neutropenia (123 patients [5.2%] vs. 109 patients [4.5%]). 
• 
Investigations:  186  patients  (7.9%)  compared  to  187 patients  (7.8%),  mainly  attributable  to 
neutrophil  count  decreased  (72  patients  [3.0%]  vs.  59  patients  [2.5%]),  and  ejection  fraction 
decreased (50 patients [2.1%] vs. 50 patients [2.1%]). 
•  Gastrointestinal  Disorders:  109  patients  (4.6%)  compared  to  45 patients  (1.9%),  mainly 
attributable to diarrhea (69 patients [2.9%] vs. 18 patients [0.7%]). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  any  study  drug  modifications  (i.e.,  including  dose  interruptions,  dose 
delays, and dose reductions) were1217 patients (51.5%) vs. 1064 patients (44.2%). The higher incidence 
was mainly due to neutropenia (230 patients [9.7%] vs. 209 patients [8.7%]).

Additional SOCs were: 
• 
Investigations:  288  patients  (12.2%)  compared  to  297 patients  (12.3%),  the  higher  incidence 
mainly attributable to neutrophil count decreased (121 patients [5.1%] vs. 116 patients [4.8%]). 
•  Gastrointestinal  Disorders:  315  patients  (13.3%)  compared  to  160  patients  (6.7%),  the  higher

Post marketing experience 
As  of  30  March  2017  (the  Data  Lock  Point  [DLP]  for  the  Perjeta  EU  License  renewal),  an  estimated 
cumulative total of 160,282 patients have received Perjeta in the marketing experience.  
In line with ICH-E2D guideline, for marketed medicinal products, spontaneously reported AEs usually imply 
at least a suspicion of causality by the reporter and are considered to be suspected adverse reactions for 
regulatory reporting purposes. A summary of the SOCs under which AEs were most frequently reported from 
post-authorization sources, is presented in Table 75.

The cumulative post-marketing data is consistent with the data submitted in previous Periodic Benefit-Risk 
Evaluation Reports (PBRERs), including the data that became available since the last Perjeta PBRER was 
submitted (Report 1069305 [reporting period 8 December 2015 to 7 June 2016]). No new safety concerns 
were identified.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  APHINITY  study  included  patients  with  operable  HER2-positive  early  breast  cancer,  and  the  study 
provides safety data on 2364 patients exposed to Perjeta plus trastuzumab and standard chemotherapy 
(Ptz+H+Chemo) in the adjuvant setting. In addition, safety data have previously been submitted for more 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 105/120 
  
  
 
than  2000  patients  treated  with  Perjeta  alone  or  in  combination  with  a  range  of  trastuzumab  and/or 
chemotherapy  regimens  in  registration-directed  and  supporting  clinical  trials  in  the  neoadjuvant  and 
metastatic settings. Due to the relatively short follow-up, follow-up safety data from the APHINITY study will 
allow to further characterise the safety profile.. 
At the time of the clinical cut-off for the primary analysis (19 December 2016), 2028 patients (84.5%) in the 
pertuzumab  arm  and  2100  patients  (87.4%)  in  the  Placebo  arm  had  completed  treatment.  Thereof  372 
[15.5%] and 304 [12.6%], respectively, did not complete, or never started, Perjeta or placebo treatment. 
The median duration of study treatment was 64 weeks (targeted treatment 55 weeks), which was the same 
in  both  treatment  arms.  The  median  cumulative  dose  of  pertuzumab  received  by  patients  in  the 
Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  was  7980  mg  (range:  420-9660  mg).  The  median  follow-up  is  approximately  45 
months. The Applicant has prolonged the follow-up time by additional 5 years, and the obtained knowledge 
will be very informative both with regard to the number of relapses over time (especially in the CNS) and the 
extent of late toxicity from the adjuvant treatment given in the APHINITY trial.  
In the pertuzumab arm, the incidence of any treatment-emergent AE was 99.9%, and the incidence of 
any grade ≥ 3 AE was 64.2%. The most common AEs were diarrhea (71.2% vs. 45.2%), nausea (69.0% vs. 
65.5%), alopecia (66.7% vs. 66.9%), fatigue (48.8% vs. 44.3%), vomiting (32.5% vs. 30.5%), arthralgia 
(28.7% vs. 32.5%), and constipation (28.9% vs. 31.6%). Overall, most of the common adverse effects are 
assessed to be chemotherapy toxicities, as they are similar between the treatment arms. 
The incidence of grade ≥3 AEs was overall higher in the pertuzumab arm (1518 patients [64.2%] vs. 1379 
patients [57.3%], respectively), and consisted mainly of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia, as 
well as diarrhea, and neutrophil count decreased. The higher incidence in the pertuzumab arm was mainly 
driven by diarrhea (9.8% vs. 3.7% in the placebo arm) was significant as >grade 3 diarrhoea translate into 
more  than  7  stools  per  day  and  hospitalization  as  indicated.  It  was  evident  that  the  adverse  event  of 
diarrhoea was earlier onset, worse in grade, and had longer duration in the pertuzumab arm. Even though 
reasonable measures were taken, such as early intervention with loperamide as well as fluid and electrolyte 
replacement, it is noted that the median duration of diarrhea was 8 days vs 6 days between the arms and 
that  the  event  was  coupled  especially  to  the  administration  of  docetaxel.  In  addition,  loperamide  was 
administered  to  more  than  double  as  many  patients  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  (35.6%  vs  14.8%).  The 
Applicant has sufficiently changed the SmPC to be more informative on the risk of diarrhea during taxane 
chemotherapy and in elderly patients, and proposed reasonable management and handling of this safety 
issue. 
A higher incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed among Perjeta-treated Asian patients compared with 
other  races  in  the  APHINITY  trial  (15.9%  of  Perjeta-treated  patients  and  9.9%  of  placebo-treated 
patients).The number of deaths due to AEs were comparable between the treatment arms. 
The most frequent treatment-related SAEs excluding diarrhoea were cardiac events. A total of 25 patients 
had a primary cardiac event: 17 patients (0.7%) vs. 8 patients (0.3%). Heart failure (NYHA III or IV) with 
an LVEF decline was reported in 15 patients (0.6%) vs. 7 patients (0.3%). The timing of the primary cardiac 
events was mostly within 2 years, reversible and the number of events was relatively small, so overall the 
rate is considered acceptable and expectable. Most of the cardiac events occurred in patients who received 
anthracycline-based  treatment.  In  particular,  all  cardiac  deaths  occurred  in  patients  who  received 
anthracycline-based  chemotherapy.  Radiotherapy  on  chest  wall,  smoking  history,  and  coronary  artery 
disease were other identified risk factors. All these factors are already well known to increase the risk of 
cardiac events with anti-HER2 therapies. At the time of data cut-off, LVEF recovery was achieved only in 
7/15 patients (46.7%) experiencing a non-fatal primary cardiac event in the Pertuzumab arm versus 4/6 
patients  (66.7%)  in  the  placebo  arm  of  patients  experiencing  a  non-fatal  primary  cardiac  event  in  that 
treatment arm). The median time to LVEF recovery was much longer in the pertuzumab arm (27.0 weeks, 
range 3.1-52.4 weeks) compared to the placebo arm (16.3 weeks, range 11.0-30.1 weeks).   The updated 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 106/120 
  
  
incidence  for  recovery  by  the  new  data  cut-off  15  May  2017  was  8/15  (53.3%)  and  4/7  (57.1%)  for 
pertuzumab and placebo respectively. As no further data can be expected from the majority of the remaining 
patients,  due  to  2  deaths  and  several  patient  withdrawals  from  study,  it  may  be  concluded  that 
approximately 50% of the patients will recover from a primary cardiac event within a reasonable timeframe. 
The majority of patients who experienced a secondary cardiac event, experienced the event in the first 
year after randomization (48 patients [75.0%] vs. 51 patients [76.1%]). LVEF recovery was achieved in 
79.4%  vs.  80.6%  and  the  median  time  to  acute  recovery  was  comparable  between  treatment  arms.  
Therefore, secondary cardiac events were considered rare and within an acceptable range considering the 
study treatments toxicity profiles. However, it is important to get more long-term safety data regarding 
cardiac safety (see RMP). 
Other relevant AEs included rash or similar skin adverse events; leukopenia and neutropenia, including 
febrile  neutropenia,  and  infusion-related  reactions.  These  adverse  events  were  manageable  and 
considered primarily related to chemotherapy. 
Patients with at least one AE in both treatment arms was also comparable across age groups <40 years, 
40-64  years,  and  ≥65  years.  In  addition,  the  safety  profile  in  patients  regarding  nodal  status  and 
hormone-receptor  status  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  the  overall  patient  population.  The  number  of 
patients aged 75 years or older was quite small (56 patients [1.2%]), and the MAH decided not to include as 
a separate group in the analyses to investigate the safety profile of study treatment by age.  Requested data 
from the Applicant show that diarrhea, vomiting, anaemia, decreased appetite and weight decreased were 
higher in this age-group compared to all patients.  
The most common AE’s that led to withdrawal of Perjeta or placebo were EF decreased, cardiac failure, and 
diarrhea.  Generally,  the  incidences  were  small  (<3%)  and  the  toxicities  were  well  known  and  within  an 
acceptable range. The most common AE’s that led to withdrawal of any study medication were peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy,  neuropathy  peripheral,  diarrhea,  EF  decreased,  and  cardiac  failure.  The  peripheral 
neuropathy is a known adverse event to taxanes and the events were few, so this is of no major concern. 
More patients stopped any treatment due to diarrhea, which was expected due to pertuzumab’ s and the 
taxanes  toxicity  profiles,  however  the  number  is  considered  within  an  acceptable  range,  and  mostly  a 
problem while both pertuzumab and taxanes were given concomitantly, which is only for approximately 9-12 
weeks.  The  incidences  of  decreased  EF  and  cardiac  failures  are  within  the  known  range  with  these 
treatments,  and  although  double  as  many  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  cardiac  failure  in  the 
pertuzumab arm, the overall incidence is low (1.2% vs 0.6%). 
The AE’s that led to a dose modification of Perjeta or placebo were mainly neutropenia, neutrophil count 
decreased,  EF  decreased,  and  diarrhea.  Dose  modifications  were  more  common  in  the  pertuzumab  arm 
(30.6% vs. 26.3%). The AEs that led to any study medication modifications were mainly neutrophil count 
decreased and diarrhea, and were overall more common in the pertuzumab arm (51.5% vs. 44.2%).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The addition of pertuzumab to standard chemotherapy is well-tolerated, but is associated with increased 
incidence  of  diarrhea,  cardiac  events,  mucositis,  and  infusion-related  reactions.  Especially,  the  risk  of 
primary cardiac events tended to increase, particularly heart failure, apparently with a lower chance and 
longer time to recovery.  However, in the updated set the chance of recovery appeared similar. Diarrhoea 
was  observed  much  more  frequently  with  Perjeta,  and  was  among  the  main  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
withdrawal  or  dose  modifications.  Most  toxicities  appear  manageable  and  related  to  chemotherapy, 
however,  it  is  evident  that  many  of  the  toxicities  are  more  pronounced  in  elderly  patients,  and  this  is 
reflected in the SmPC. The high frequency and severity of diarrhoea related to Perjeta, are likely to affect 
quality of life.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable.   
3.   Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This extension of indication is for the use of Perjeta in the adjuvant setting, in combination with trastuzumab 
and chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory, 
or early stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients  with  early  breast  cancer  are  treated  with  6-8  cycles  of  chemotherapy  in  addition  to  1  year  of 
trastuzumab. 
Despite the current available adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and trastuzumab), up to 1 in 4 women with 
HER2-positive early breast cancer will experience recurrence or death within 10 − 11 years of diagnosis. As 
the median age of patients presenting with HER2-positive breast cancer is in the mid-50s, around five years 
younger than the general breast cancer population, the median loss of life-years per patient is around two 
decades for patients dying of HER2-positive breast cancer. 
Of the patients diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, approximately 67% initially present 
with early disease and subsequently relapse, while the remaining patients present with metastases at first 
diagnosis (“de novo” metastatic breast cancer) (Yardley et al, 2014). Patients who relapse with metastatic 
or  unresectable  disease  are  generally  incurable,  whereas  the  few  patients  with  resectable  loco-regional 
recurrence may still be cured with salvage therapy. In the case of metastatic disease, life expectancy is a 
median OS of 56.5 months (Swain et al, 2015), so more than 50% of the patients die within 5 years.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 113/120 
  
  
 
 
 
There is an unmet medical need for reducing the risk of frequent relapses, despite current available adjuvant 
treatments, and thereby decrease the risk of early death for the majority of the patients who relapse. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal and only study in this application is the APHINITY study. The APHINITY study is an ongoing, 
randomized, double-blind, two-arm, phase III study of adjuvant trastuzumab and standard chemotherapy 
plus  Perjeta  or  placebo,  in  patients  with  primary  operable  breast  cancer.  For  each  patient,  investigators 
chose  from  pre-specified  adjuvant  chemotherapy  regimens,  including  standard  anthracycline-and/or 
taxane-based chemotherapy. In total, 4804 patients were randomized 1:1 to Perjeta plus trastuzumab and 
standard  chemotherapy  (Ptz+H+Chemo)  or  placebo  plus  trastuzumab  and  standard  chemotherapy 
(Pla+H+Chemo) in the adjuvant setting from 08 November 2011 to 31 August 2013. 
The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) and secondary endpoints included 
IDFS-including second primary non-breast cancer (IDFS-SPNBC), disease-free survival (DFS), overall 
survial (OS), recurrence-free interval (RFI), and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). Exploratory 
endpoints included breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), and patient-reported outcomes. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met its primary endpoint at the time of primary analysis. A statistically relevant improvement in 
IDFS, corresponding to a 19% reduction in the risk of recurrence or death, HR 0.81 (95%CI 0.66; 1.00, 
p=0.446)  was  demonstrated.  The  K-M  IDFS  curves  tend  to  overlap  up  to  2  years.  Estimates  of  IDFS 
event-free  rates  at  3  years  were  94.06%  vs.  93.24%  in  the  pertuzumab  arm  vs.  the  placebo  arm, 
respectively, and at 4 years were 92.28% vs. 90.58%, suggesting a sustained benefit over time after the 
end of treatment (1-year duration). As expected, distant recurrence was the most frequent IDFS event. 
Key  secondary  endpoints  were  invasive  disease-free  survival  excluding  second  non-breast  malignancies 
(IDFS-SPNBC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results for IDFS-SPNBC was similar 
to  IDFS,  and  also  showed  a  statistical  difference  favouring  the  pertuzumab  arm.  DFS  also  showed  a 
significant benefit with the addition of pertuzumab.  
Overall survival data was immature, with only 3.3% and 3.7% events in each arm.  
The exploratory endpoints were recurrence-free interval (RFI), distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), and 
breast  cancer-free  interval  (BCFI).  RFI  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  as  well  as  BCFI, 
however DRFI was not different between the arms, probably due to too few events at the present time (5% 
vs. 6%, respectively). 
Patients with node-positive disease showed statistically significant benefit with Ptz+H+Chemo treatment with 
IDFS event-free rates of 91.99% vs. 90.15% at 3 years (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62, 0.96) (KM curve below). 
These  results  indicate  a  23%  reduction  in  risk  of  recurrence  or  death  in  patients  randomized  to 
Ptz+H+Chemo; the event-free rates at 4 years were  89.88% vs. 86.68%, respectively. For patients with 
hormone  receptor-negative  disease  the  results  were  HR  0.76  (95%CI  0.56,  1.04).  At  4 years,  the  IDFS 
event-free rates for this subgroup were 90.96% vs. 88.67%, respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The results from the primary analysis of the APHINITY study were after only 4 years of follow-up and this is 
a relatively short time for an adjuvant study of early breast cancer.  Consistently, there were rather few 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/366182/2018 
Page 114/120 
  
  
events at this point in time, as 171 patients (7.1%) in the pertuzumab arm and 210 patients (8.7%) in the 
placebo arm have had an IDFS event so far. Especially, limited conclusions can be drawn regarding OS and 
many of the secondary endpoints due to the low number of events so far. This is, however, expected, and is 
not considered an issue with regard to the B/R assessment of the present application. Furthermore, based on 
the available data there was no reason to expect a detrimental effect in the long term. Further data are 
expected. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The addition of pertuzumab to standard chemotherapy is associated with increased incidence of diarrhea, 
cardiac events, mucositis, and infusion-related reactions. Among the most common treatment-emergent 
AEs, the highest difference between the two arms was observed for diarrhea (71.2% vs. 45.2%, grade ≥ 3 
9.8% vs 3.7%). This is reflected in the results of PROs, showing an imbalance between the two arms only for 
diarrhoea, with a clinically meaningful worsening observed in the experimental arm that persisted until the 
end of treatment. Most toxicities appear manageable and related to chemotherapy, however, it is evident 
that many of the toxicities are more pronounced in elderly patients, and this is now reflected in the SmPC. 
The most common AE’s that led to withdrawal of Perjeta or placebo were EF decreased, cardiac failure, and 
diarrhoea. Generally, the incidences were small (<3%) and the toxicities were well known with the given 
therapies. The most common AE’s that led to withdrawal of any study medication were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, neuropathy peripheral, diarrhoea, EF decreased, and cardiac failure. The peripheral neuropathy 
is a known adverse event to taxanes and the events were few. More patients stopped any treatment due to 
diarrhoea, which was expected due to the toxicity profile of pertuzumab and taxane. Heart failure (NYHA III 
or IV) with LVEF decline of at least 10 Ejection Fraction points from baseline AND to below 50% was reported 
in  15  patients  in  the  Ptz+H+Chemo  arm  (0.6%)  versus  7 patients  in  the  Pla+H+Chemo  arm  (0.3%).  The 
incidences  of  decreased  EF  and  cardiac  failures  are  within  the  known  range  with  these  treatments,  and 
although double as many patients discontinued treatment due to cardiac failure in the pertuzumab arm, the 
overall incidence was low (1.2% vs 0.6%). 
The AE’s that led to a dose modification of Perjeta or placebo were mainly neutropenia, neutrophil count 
decreased, EF decreased, and diarrhoea. Dose modifications were more common in the pertuzumab arm 
(30.6% vs. 26.3%). The AEs that led to any study medication modifications were mainly neutrophil count 
decreased and diarrhoea, and were overall more common in the pertuzumab arm (51.5% vs. 44.2%).   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The median follow-up time in the submitted primary analysis is 4 years, so there are no long-term safety 
data. Perjeta has been used for longer periods in the metastatic setting, but due to the median survival time 
in  this  patient  group,  there  are  no  long-term  data  from  this  population.  In  the  neoadjuvant  setting, 
pertuzumab  has  been  used  for  18-24  weeks  prior  to  operation,  but  this  is  a  shorter  time  than  what  is 
applicable  for  this  application  i.e.  exposure  of  approximately  1  year.  Long-term  follow-up  is  considered 
especially  relevant  regarding  cardiac  toxicity,  in  order  to  allow  a  better  assessment  of  the  long-term 
outcome (see RMP). Currently, available data show apparent longer time to recovery with Perjeta compared 
to placebo. Regarding the long-term outcome of cardiac toxicity, the Applicant will also assess this at the 
time of the next planned IA.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The target population of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer still have an unmet medical need, 
since the risk of recurrence is high with available adjuvant treatment, as up to 1 in 4 women will experience 
recurrence or death within 10 − 11 years of diagnosis. Because the median age of patients presenting with 
HER2-positive breast cancer is in the mid-50s, around five years younger than the general breast cancer 
population,  the  median  loss  of  life-years  per  patient  is  around  two  decades  for  patients  dying  of 
HER2-positive  breast  cancer.  In  the  case  of  metastatic  disease,  life  expectancy  is  a  median  OS  of  56.5 
months, so more than 50% of the patients die within 5 years. 
Whereas the availability of a new treatment option to be added to the present therapeutic armamentarium 
in  the  adjuvant  setting  is  considered  clinically  relevant,  as  a  proportion  of  patients  still  relapses,  the 
magnitude of benefit is not considered outstanding in the ITT population; however, the treatment effect 
seems to be sustained over time (4 years observation period), which is encouraging considering that OS 
data,  as  expected,  are  largely  immature.  Importantly,  the  treatment  effect  seems  to  be  driven  by  the 
subgroup  of  patients  with  node-positive  disease,  who  represent  also  the  largest  proportion  of  recruited 
patients.  
It cannot be excluded that with a longer follow-up, a benefit could be shown also for node-negative patients, 
but this is for the time being not self-evident. 
Conversely, the efficacy outcome of a 19% reduction in recurrence or death (IDFS HR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.66; 
1.00),  p=0.0446)  is  comparable  with  the  improved  efficacy  outcomes  in  other  adjuvant  breast  cancer 
studies, such as docetaxel (HR 0.72); epirubicin (HR~0.77); exemestane (HR 0.68); letrozole (HR 0.81) and 
anastrozole (HR 0.87). In addition, it is noted that the control arm of the APHINITY study performed better 
than anticipated, which is in line with other recent adjuvant breast cancer trials (BETH, ALTTO), and may be 
due to better staging and treatment over the years. 
Results from 11 years of follow up shows an improvement of adding trastuzumab compared to observation 
was within the same range (HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.68; 0.86) (Cameron et al. Lancet 2017). 
The safety profile does not raise major concerns. The unfavourable effect of most significance is the high 
incidence of diarrhoea (71.2%), with an incidence of more than grade 3 of 9.8% in the pertuzumab arm. 
Although  no  fatal  events,  diarrhoea  led  to  dose  modifications  and  discontinuations,  however,  within  an 
acceptable range. The event was more pronounced and affected PRO during chemotherapy. 
Other  common  toxicities  that  may  affect  quality  of  life,  such  as  nausea,  alopecia,  fatigue,  vomiting, 
mucositis,  neutropenia  and  anaemia  were  almost  exclusively  related  to  the  chemotherapy  treatment, 
although mucositis seem worsened by pertuzumab. There were also an increased number of infusion-related

reactions, but this is known with pertuzumab and manageable. However, a slight increase in the incidence 
of heart failure (NYHA III or IV) with LVEF decline of at least 10 Ejection Fraction points from baseline AND 
to below 50% associated with Perjeta is noted, together with tendency to a lower rate of recovery from the 
event, and a much longer median time to LVEF recovery.  
Deaths due to AEs were uncommon and no imbalances were observed. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer have a quite good prognosis thanks to development 
of  good  treatments  over  the  last  decades.  Thus,  the  results  seen  in  the  APHINITY  study  reflects  this 
situation.  Nonetheless,  there  is  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two  arms  in  the  ITT 
population,  reflecting  a  risk  reduction  of  19%  for  relapse  or  death  in  the  target  population.  However, 
available data do not allow to conclude for a positive B/R in the overall population at this point in time. It is 
considered that benefit is clearly shown in the  high-risk population therefore supporting an indication of 
adjuvant Perjeta in the high-risk subgroups of HR-negative, node-positive patients. 
The risks of adding pertuzumab to standard chemotherapy are most importantly diarrhoea and increased 
cardiotoxicity.  Other  common  unfavourable  effects  are  manageable  and  affect  PRO  primarily  during 
chemotherapy. 
Therefore, the B/R balance in the finally agreed restricted indication is considered favourable. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Perjeta in the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer 
at high risk of recurrence is established to be positive.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
There  are  approximately  33  million  people  worldwide  living  with  HIV-1.  HIV-1  infection  remains  is  a 
life-threatening disease in infected persons who do not receive adequate treatment sufficiently early in 
the  course  of  the  infection  and/or  are  infected  with  virus  that  is  resistant  to  anti-retroviral  agents  of 
several classes such that an adequate treatment regimen cannot be constructed from approved agents.  
Therapeutic  strategies  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  disease  have  been  significantly  advanced  by  the 
availability  of  highly  active  antiretroviral  (ARV)  therapy  (HAART).  The  introduction  of  HAART  was 
associated with a dramatic decrease in AIDS-related mortality and morbidity in the US and Europe. The 
goal of ARV therapy for HIV-1 infection is to delay disease progression and prolong survival by achieving 
maximal and durable suppression of HIV-1 replication. In treatment naïve subjects who have not acquired 
multi-resistant virus de novo, suppression of HIV RNA to < 50 copies/ml has been achieved in ~80% of 
subjects in clinical studies.  
Current treatment guidelines suggest that initial therapy for ARV treatment-naive HIV-1 infected patients 
should consist of 2 NRTIs/NtRTIs and either an NNRTI—usually efavirenz—a boosted protease inhibitor 
(PI) or the integrase inhibitor (INSTI) raltegravir (RAL).  
•  NNRTIs are widely used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection but are associated with safety and 
tolerability concerns such as hepatotoxicity, central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, rash and/or 
the risk of teratogenicity.  
•  Advantages of PI-based regimens include excellent anti-viral activity, a relatively high barrier for 
development of drug resistance (i.e. requires multiple mutations) and sparing treatment with 
NNRTIs. However, PIs have the potential for multiple drug interactions and may be associated with 
metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. In addition, they 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 9/147 
 
  
  
require co-administration of low-dose RTV to boost exposure through inhibition of CYP3A-mediated 
metabolism. The use of RTV as a pharmacoenhancer of PIs adds to the pill burden. 
•  RAL is currently the only INSTI approved for use in adults. It requires twice-daily dosing but it has a 
better tolerability profile compared to efavirenz and a relatively limited potential for 
drug-drug-interactions.   
In the EU the single treatment regimens (STR) marketed suitable for treatment-naïve subjects are Atripla 
(emtricitabine [FTC], tenofovir [TDF], efavirenz [EFV]) and Eviplera (FTC/TDF plus the NNRTI rilpivirine) 
which was recently approved. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
The applicant has developed a fixed drug combination tablet containing three ARVs (FTC/TDF and 
elvitegravir [EVG; an INSTI]) plus a new pharmacoenhancer cobicistat (COBI), which modifies the PK 
profile of EVG.  
It is proposed that this once daily FDC will provide a useful alternative to existing STRs for the following 
reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
It does not include a NNRTI, which may have treatment-limiting tolerability issues 
It avoids use of EFV, which is classed as a teratogen so limiting use in women of childbearing potential 
It is the first STR to combine an INSTI with an NRTI backbone  
It provides an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate boosted PIs 
It provides a simplified treatment regimen 
Initial proposed indication for use: 
Stribild is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) 
infection in adults aged 18 years and over who are antiretroviral treatment-naïve or who have no known 
mutations associated with resistance to the individual components of Stribild. 
The demonstration of the benefit of the combination elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) in HIV-1 infection is based on Week 48 safety and efficacy analysis 
from 2 randomised, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 studies in treatment-naïve adults (see section 5.1). 
Proposed posology: 
The recommended dose of Stribild is one tablet, taken orally, once daily with food.  
Since the Stribild contains two active substances that are already approved (alone and as part of three 
approved FDCs) where applicable the individual assessment reports have concentrated on data for the 
two new components rather than repeating all the information of relevance that has already been fully 
assessed and reviewed (pre- and post-approval) by the CHMP. This report reflects this approach.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Stribild is a fixed dose combination containing two new active substances not previously authorised in the 
EU -elvitegravir and cobicistat- and two known active substances – emtricitabine and tenofovir. 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets, containing 150 mg of elvitegravir, 150 mg of 
cobicistat, 200 mg of emtricitabine, and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (equivalent to 300 mg of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate or 136 mg of tenofovir). The composition is described in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in bottles as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Elvitegravir 
Elvitegravir appears as a white to pale yellow crystalline non-hygroscopic powder, sparingly soluble in 
methanol and ethanol and practically insoluble in water and aqueous solutions at pH 2.0 to 8.3. The 
chemical name of elvitegravir is 
6-(3-Chloro-2-fluorobenzyl)-1-[(2S)-1-hydroxy-3-methylbutan-2-yl]-7-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroqui
noline-3-carboxylic acid, corresponding to the structural formula below: 
OOHH
NN
OO
HH 33CC
OOHH
OO OO
FF
CCll
The molecular formula is C 23H23ClFNO5 and its relative molecular mass 447.9 g/mol. Its pKa is 6.6 and 
the distribution coefficient LogD 4.5 (at pH 6.8). Elvitegravir exhibits polymorphism and appears in three 
polymorphs. The most thermodynamically stable polymorphic form has been determined and the 
crystallisation process is designed to consistently deliver this form.  It contains a single asymmetric centre 
at C-11. The absolute configuration was established by single crystal X-ray crystallography and has been 
determined to be of “S” configuration.  
Manufacture 
Elvitegravir is manufactured in six well defined synthetic steps using commercially available starting 
materials. Three sites are involved in the manufacture of elvitegravir. The route of synthesis has been 
described in sufficient detail and adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented. Information about the formation, presence, origin and fate of impurities during manufacture 
has been satisfactorily discussed. 
Representative batch analysis data provided for all 3 proposed manufacturing sites produced with the 
proposed synthetic route show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly.

impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), 
polymorphic form ( DSC-Ph. Eur.) and Particle size (laser light scattering). 
Impurities, including genotoxic impurities, have been evaluated and qualified where necessary. The 
proposed limits are found to be acceptable from a safety point of view and therefore they are considered 
justified.  
A microbial limit test for the drug substance is not required in accordance with ICH Q6A because the latter 
steps of the active substance manufacturing process conducted in aqueous organic solvent mixtures and 
are expected to limit microbial content. In addition, confirmatory testing demonstrated that elvitegravir is 
moderately to completely inhibitory to microbial growth. Furthermore, data presented in the dossier 
indicate that no significant bioburden is present.  
The analytical methods have been well described and validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) and are suitable 
to control the quality of the active substance.  
Batch analysis data on 23 pilot and commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured by all 
three proposed manufacturers have been provided. All 3 sites have manufactured commercial scale 
batches. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
manufacturing process regardless of the manufacturing site. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been conducted for four commercial scale batches from the first manufacturer  and 
one batch from the second under ICH long term (25°C±2°C /60±5% RH) and accelerated conditions 
(40°C±2°C / 75%±5% RH) in the proposed packaging. Results were submitted for up 60 months at long 
term conditions and for up to 9 months at accelerated conditions. 
Long term and accelerated stability samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurity content, and 
water content. The enantiomeric purity and polymorphic form were tested annually during the long term 
studies. Enantiomeric purity was determined for 1 batch, at the beginning and end of the accelerated 
study and polymorphic form was tested at the end of the accelerated study. The analytical methods used 
are stability indicating. 
All parameters remained within the specification limits under both conditions over the duration of study 
for all four batches. The data show no discernible trends for assay, total impurity content, individual 
specified impurities, degradation products or any other tested parameter.   
In addition, a photostability study of elvitegravir has been assessed as per the ICH Q1B Guideline on one 
batch from the second manufacturer. No significant difference was observed between the control sample 
and exposed sample in appearance, assay, impurity content, polymorphic form and enantiomeric purity. 
The data indicate that elvitegravir is not sensitive to light.  
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active substance 
is packed in the proposed packaging materials is acceptable. 
Cobicistat  
The active substance cobicistat is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat appears as a white to pale 
yellow, very hygroscopic amorphous solid, soluble in 0.1N HCl pH 1.9, sparingly soluble at pH 4.5, 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 12/147 
 
  
  
 
practically insoluble in water and at pH 6.8-8.2, freely soluble in methanol. The chemical name of 
cobicistat is 1,3-Thiazol-5-ylmethyl [(2R,5R)-5-{[(2S)-2-[(methyl{[2-(propan-2-yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl] 
methyl}carbamoyl)amino]-4-(morpholin-4-yl)butanoyl]amino}-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate, 
corresponding to the structural formula below: 
The molecular formula is C 40H53N7O5S2 and its relative molecular mass 776.0 g/mol. It shows three pKa; 
1.8 (thiazole group), 2.5 (alkylthiazole group) and 6.4 (morpholino group). The partition coefficient LogP 
is 4.3 (at pH 8.5 buffer). No crystal forms have been found. It has three chiral centres and is produced as 
a single isomer. The stereochemical configuration is defined through the synthetic process and the use of 
starting material with suitable chirality. Appropriate specifications for these starting materials ensure 
consistent quality during manufacture of cobicistat. 
Cobicistat is an amorphous solid with a low glass transition temperature of 35 ºC. Because of the low 
glass transition temperature, cobicistat under ambient conditions undergoes moisture and temperature 
induced phase transition from a foam into a rubber-like material. To increase physical stability of 
cobicistat it is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is a white to pale yellow amorphous 
powder and as cobicistat is also hygroscopic as determined by dynamic vapor sorption at room 
temperature. The relatively higher water uptake of cobicistat on silicon dioxide compared to cobicistat is 
due to the hygroscopic nature of the silicon dioxide carrier. Importantly however and contrary to 
cobicistat itself, moisture uptake of cobicistat on silicon dioxide is reversible and therefore cobicistat is 
isolated by adsorption on silicon dioxide to provide a stable solid form, which is suitable for further 
finished product manufacture. 
Manufacture 
Three sites are involved in the manufacture of the active substance with one of them involved only in the 
manufacture of an intermediate. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is manufactured in four well defined 
synthetic steps. Details about possible reprocessing have been provided. The route of synthesis has been 
described in sufficient detail and adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented. Because the actual loading value of cobicistat on silicon dioxide is subject to manufacturing 
variability, a target loading with an appropriate range was adopted to ensure a robust down-stream 
manufacturing process. 
Both sites have manufactured commercial scale batches of cobicistat on silicon dioxide and many 
smaller scale batches during the development of the product. The first site has made 9 large scale 
batches and the second has made 7 large scale batches. Batch analysis data show that the active 
substance produced by both manufacturers is of similar quality and can be manufactured reproducibly.

Specification 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification 
(cobicistat: IR, HPLC, UV, silicon dioxide: chemical reaction), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and heavy metals (Ph. Eur.).  
No crystal forms have been identified and since the drug substance is produced as an amorphous solid 
adsorbed onto silicon dioxide, a test for polymorphism is not required as per ICH Q6A. 
Cobicistat genotoxic potential has been evaluated in accordance with the recommendations in ICH Q3A. 
All the identidied impurities are of low concern for genotoxicity, and therefore no further qualification 
studies were considered necessary. The proposed test and limits are acceptable.  
A microbial limit test for the drug substance is not required in accordance with ICH Q6A because the latter 
steps of the active substance manufacturing process are non-aqueous and been shown to limit microbial 
content. In addition data presented on several batches during development indicate no significant 
bioburden is present.  
All in-house analytical methods have been validated according to ICH Q2A principles. 
Batch analysis data for 9 representative large scale batches from the first site and 7 representative large 
scale batches from the second manufacturer have been provided. In addition data for (smaller) batches 
used during development were also provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm 
consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Two pilot scale and one production scale batch from the first manufacturer and on one full scale batch 
from the second manufacturer packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in 
accordance with the ICH Q1A (R2) Guideline under long-term conditions at 5 °C for up to 36 months and 
accelerated at 25 °C/60% RH for up to 36 months. Appearance, water content, assay, impurities and 
chiral purity have been monitored. The analytical methods used are stability indicating. All 
physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide remained within the specification acceptance 
limits following 36 months of long-term storage at 5 °C and no apparent trend has been observed. A 
statistical analysis performed for assay, total impurities and the major chiral impurity also demonstrate 
that there is little change over time. The physicochemical attributes of cobicistat on silicon dioxide 
remained also within the specification acceptance limits following 36 months of storage at 25 °C/60% RH. 
Furthermore, three of the above batches were also tested under 30 °C/75% RH for up to 12 months to 
evaluate the stability of cobicistat on silicon dioxide at elevated temperatures that may be encountered 
during shipping and handling. The duration of temperature and humidity excursions is limited to 3 
months. 
In addition, a photostability study was conducted on cobicistat on silicon dioxide according to ICH Q1B 
Guideline. The results showed no significant change in appearance, assay, and impurity content following 
exposure to light. The data indicate that cobicistat on silicon dioxide is not sensitive to light.  
Based on the presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active substance 
is packed in the proposed packaging materials is acceptable. 
Emtricitabine 
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in 
methanol and water. The chemical name of emtricitabine is 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 14/147 
 
  
  
4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2S,5R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]-1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one, 
corresponding to the structural formula below: 
The molecular formula is C 8H10FN3O3S and its relative molecular mass 247.24 g/mol. Its pKa is 2.65 and 
the partition coefficient LogP is -0.43. it has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. 
Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can exist; cis-(-)-FTC and cis-(+)-FTC, trans-(-)-FTC and 
trans-(+)-FTC. The synthetic route has been chosen to be stereoselective for the formation of the desired 
cis-(-) enantiomer, emtricitabine. Three polymorphs of emtricitabine have been observed. However, the 
most stable thermodynamically form at room temperature, is consistently produced. 
Manufacture 
Emtricitabine is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and followed 
by two options comprising either by one or two extra steps. The synthesis was described in sufficient 
detail.  The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the 
formation of the desired emtricitabine enantiomer. Four manufacturing sites are involved. Adequate 
in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been 
shown to consistently produce emtricitabine that meets the required quality standards. 
Batch analysis data is provided on 18 commercial scale batches produced with the proposed synthetic 
route from all proposed manufacturers. The data show that the active substance can be manufactured 
reproducibly by all proposed manufacturers. 
Specification 
Emtricitabine specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), 
Clarity of Solution (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), Residue On Ignition (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC) and 
particle size (Laser Light Scattering). Analytical methods have been validated in accordance with ICH 
guidelines. The testing and the proposed limits applied, conform to current ICH guidlines and are 
acceptable from a toxicological and clinical perspective. 
Extended testing during development has demonstrated that only a single polymorphic form results from 
the synthetic process of emtricitabine. Therefore as per ICH Q6A, testing at release is not necessary. 
Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and therefore as per ICH Q6 indicate 
that microbial testing of the drug substance is not required. 
Batch analysis data on 13 commercial scale and 5 pilot scale batches of the active substance from all 
proposed manufacturers were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm 
consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013

Stability 
Ten commercial scale and five pilot scale batches of emtricitabine manufactured using by both synthetic 
routes and by all four manufacturers packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in 
accordance with the ICH Q1A (R2) Guideline under long-term conditions at 25 ºC/60% RH for up to 36 
months.  Of the above batches, eight commercial scale and five pilot batches were put under accelerated 
at 40 ºC/75%RH for up to 6 months. In addition another three batches were put under intermediate 30 
ºC/65%RH conditions for up to 12 months. Samples are tested for appearance, impurities and 
degradation products, water content and for enantiomeric purity by validated stability indicating 
methods.  Stability data for emtricitabine manufactured by both synthetic routes were comparable. All 
tested parameters remained within the specification limits throughout the tested period for all three 
stability conditions. In one isolated batch one degradation product exceeded the specification limit at the 
last time point (36 months). The same degradation product, is observed in emtricitabine stored at 
accelerated storage. Four batches exceeded the specification limit at 6 months. These data indicate that 
emtricitabine should not be exposed to elevated temperatures for extended periods of time but poses no 
quality issue for the active substance.  
A photostability study was conducted on one batch of emtricitabine. The results showed no significant 
changes in appearance, purity, and impurity content and indicate that emtricitabine is not sensitive to 
light. 
Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active substance 
is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable. 
Tenofovir  
The fumarate salt of the disoproxil prodrug of tenofovir is used. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir 
DF) appears as a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in water and 
phosphate buffer pH 3.6, soluble in 0.1 N HCl, methanol and ethanol. 
The  chemical  name  of  tenofovir  is  9-[(R)-2-[[Bis[(isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy]methoxy]-phosphinyl] 
methoxy]propyl]adenine fumarate (1:1), corresponding to the structural formula below: 
The molecular formula of tenofovir DF is C23H34N5O14P and its relative molecular mass 635.52 g/mol; the 
molecular formula of tenofovir is C9H14N5O4P and its relative molecular mass 287.21 g/mol. Its pKa is 
3.75 and the partition coefficient LogP is -1.25. It has one chiral centre at C-11 (the C-2 position of the 
propyl side-chain) and is produced as the R-enantiomer. Two crystal forms of tenofovir DF have been 
observed. The second crystal form is metastable and rapidly converts to the more stable predominant 
form in water. However, both forms have identical aqueous solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate. They 
can be distinguished by either DSC or XRD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 16/147 
 
  
  
 
Manufacture 
The synthetic process for tenofovir DF consists of four well defined steps. The synthetic process results in 
the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the formation of the desired tenofovir DF 
R-enantiomer from a commercially available optically active starting material.  The synthetic route is 
described in sufficient detail.  The active substance is manufactured by four manufacturing sites. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been 
shown able to consistently produce tenofovir DF that meets the required quality standards. 
Batch analysis data is provided on 15 representative commercial scale batches produced with the 
proposed synthetic route from all proposed manufacturers. The data show that the active substance can 
be manufactured reproducibly by all proposed manufacturers. 
Specification 
Tenofovir DF specification includes tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (tenofovir : IR, 
HPLC, fumaric acid: HPLC), clarity of solution (visual), water content (Ph. Eur.), enantiomeric purity 
(chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), fumaric acid content (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC) polymorphic form (DSC) and particle size (Laser Light Scattering). Analytical 
methods have been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Tenofovir DF is not amenable to analysis 
by sulfated ash / residue on ignition due to the variability caused in the testing by the phosphate group.  
As no inorganic catalysts are used in the synthesis, a visual test for clarity of solution is included to ensure 
that no foreign matter is present. Development data demonstrated the absence of indicator organisms 
and therefore as per ICH Q6 indicate that microbial testing of the drug substance is not required. The 
proposed testing and limits conform to current ICH guidelines and are acceptable from a toxicological and 
clinical perspective. 
Batch analysis data on 15 representative commercial scale batches produced with the proposed synthetic 
route from all proposed manufacturers have been presented. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three batches from each proposed manufacturing site were placed on long-term stability studies at 5 °C 
for up to 36 months, and a minimum of one batch from each of the sites was placed on accelerated 
stability at 25 °C/60% RH for six months in the proposed packaging.  An additional three batches from a 
fourth manufacturer not intended for registrations have been studied as above. Appearance, assay 
impurities and degradation, enantiomeric purity, water content and polymorphic form were tested using 
specific, stability-indicating methods. 
No apparent change in the tested parameters neither any trend was observed for the twelve commercial 
batches of tenofovir DF after 36 months of storage at 5 °C and after accelerated storage at 25 °C/60% RH 
for 6 months. 
A photostability study was conducted on one lot of drug substance exposed directly to light in accordance 
with ICH Q1B guideline. The photostability samples are analysed for appearance, purity, impurity and 
degradation product profile, enantiomeric purity and water content.  The results from these studies 
indicate that tenofovir DF is not sensitive to light as no significant changes in physicochemical properties 
were observed. 
Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage when the active substance 
is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Stribild is an immediate-release tablet containing elvitegravir 150 mg (EVG), cobicistat 150 mg (COBI), 
emtricitabine 200 mg (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg (equivalent to 245 mg of 
tenofovir disoproxil). The fixed-dose combination product containing in a solid oral dosage form was 
designed in order to provide patient dosing convenience of a single tablet. The degradation pathways of 
the active substances, their biopharmaceutical performance and the size of the unit dose were also 
considered for the choice of dosage form for the fixed-dose combination product.  
Prototype formulation matrices were evaluated and the results led to the selection of the current 
quantitative composition. Additionally, the physical separation of EVG and COBI from FTC and TDF using 
bilayer technology was chosen to reduce potential physicochemical interaction between them. The 
physical and chemical compatibility between the active substances used in the same layer have been 
established. Other approaches were also tried but the bilayer tablets proved the most successful from 
pharmaceutical and manufacture viewpoint. The polymorphism that EVG, FTC and TDF exhibit has been 
considered during the development. COBI is used adsorbed on silicon dioxide because unlike COBI in itself 
the moisture uptake for COBI on silicon dioxide is reversible, whereas COBI that has been exposed to high 
humidity undergoes deliquescence and becomes a rubber-like material that is difficult to process and 
which does not revert back to its original state. The isolation of COBI on a solid carrier (silicon dioxide) 
resulted in a switch from an organic solvent COBI solution used in the manufacture of the finished product 
to a solid COBI on silicon dioxide form. This change allowed the streamlining of the product manufacturing 
process. As a result of the change, the composition was modified by adjusting the excipients. A pivotal 
bioequivalence study was performed to evaluate the formulation and process change for the incorporation 
of the new COBI on silicon dioxide form which indicated that the Phase 3 intended commercial formulation 
(bilayer tablet, COBI on silicon dioxide), was bioequivalent to the formulation used in the Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 studies. 
The degradation pathways for all the active substances have been studied and considered in the 
formulation design and development. For the further optimisation of the formulation, previous experience 
with the two known active substances (FTC and TDF) was taken into account together with new 
experimental information about the two new substances. 
All the excipients used in Stribild formulation are commonly used and meet the standards defined in the 
current Ph. Eur. monographs, except for the silicon dioxide and the coating material. Both these are 
tested according to in-house standards, which are based on compendial requirements.   
A discriminatory dissolution method has been developed. The interference of the four active substances 
and their degradation products/ impurities has been considered during the development and validation of 
the analytical methods. 
The product manufacture has been designed to allow for the range of loading levels of COBI on silicon 
dioxide. Silicon Dioxide has specific use in this formulation apart from typical use as a glidant and it is 
used to adjust for the variability of COBI loading level on silicon dioxide. 
The proposed commercial formulation and manufacturing process were optimised to identify the critical 
process parameters, critical quality attributes, and to define the manufacturing operating ranges. Design 
of experiments was used to establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and normal acceptable ranges 
(NORs) operating ranges. PARs and NORs for the elvitegravir tablet compression, and film-coating 
processes have also been established.  Moving inside the PARs would be acceptable without regulatory 
post approval change assessment. However, it is reminded that in case of excursion of one process 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 18/147 
 
  
  
parameter out of its normal operating range, but within the proven acceptable range, the other process 
parameters should be maintained at their target/ normal operating value.  
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in the manufacture of Stribild tablets are of human or animal origin. Only 
lactose is obtained from cow’s milk fit for human use. Appropriate BSE/TSE declarations from the 
manufacturers of excipients have been provided. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process for the tablets involves preparation of two separate blends, granulation 
tableting and film coating steps.The process optimization studies were conducted on the granulation 
process tablet compression and film-coating processes.  
The process, which is considered a “non-standard”, is well described, the critical steps have been 
identified, suitable in-process controls have been set and holding times for intermediates have been 
established.  
The robustness of the manufacture has been demonstrated by successful process validation of 3 
representative batches at the lower end for the proposed batch size range. Process validation will be 
completed at the high end of the batch size range according to an agreed protocol. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance (visual examination), 
identification (HPLC and TLC), assay (UPLC), uniformity of dosage unit (Ph. Eur.), degradation products 
(UPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.) and dissolution (Ph. Eur.). 
The drug product is not tested for microbial purity, because the active substances inhibit microbial growth 
and sufficient data has been provided in this respect as required by the relevant Ph. Eur. monograph. 
Appropriate dissolution acceptance criteria for each of the active ingredients in the tablets were 
determined by evaluating development and clinical batches produced during manufacturing. 
Analytical procedures have been validated according to ICH Q2A guidelines.  
Batch analysis results are submitted for 4 commercial scale and 4 smaller batches used throughout 
development. The batch analysis data are within the set specification limits and show that the Stribild 
tablets can be manufactured reproducibly. 
Stability of the product 
Four commercial scale and one smaller batch in the proposed packaging were placed on stability 
according to ICH guidelines under the following conditions: long term 25°C ±2°C / 60% ±5% RH, 
intermediate 30°C ±2°C / 75% ±5%RH and accelerated 40°C ±2°C / 75% ±5% RH. Results were 
provided for up to 36 months in long term and intermediate conditions and for 6 months in accelerated.  
The drug product remained within the acceptance limits of the specification for appearance, strength, 
degradation product content, dissolution, and water content following 36 months of long-term storage.  
Analytical methods used were validated and stability indicating. No elvitegravir-related degradation 
products were observed. The degradation products observed for the other three substances were as 
expected and were within the limits for the 36 month period. The stability profile in intermediate 
conditions was comparable to the long term.  
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 19/147 
 
  
  
 
There was no significant change in the dissolution profiles upon storage for elvitegravir, cobicistat, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir DF. The water content also remained within the limits and no change in 
product appearance was observed for all four primary stability lots. 
Under accelerated conditions no significant changes were observed on all the stability attributes after six 
months including dissolution, water content and degradation products.  
Photostability of the tablets has been assessed per the ICH Q1B, Guideline. The assay and degradation 
product content were not significantly different between the light and dark control samples. No changes 
in appearance, dissolution, and water content were observed following exposure to light. The results of 
the study indicate that Stribild tablets are not sensitive to light. 
Additional stress studies under extreme temperature and humidity conditions were performed at 
50 °C/ambient humidity and at 25°C/80% RH for six weeks. To assess in-use stability, the tablets were 
also stored in open containers at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH for six weeks.  The stability data 
acquired at the long-term storage conditions remained within the specified acceptance criteria and 
supported the proposed shelf-life. 
The overall stability results support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Stribild is a complex formulation containing four different active substances.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of each of the active substances has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner.  
Development of the drug product has presented a number of challenges arising from the particular 
characteristics of the individual active substances and most importantly the need to ensure a physically 
and chemically stable form of cobicistat and to avoid interactions between the four drug substances. 
The choice of formulation, of excipients and the manufacturing process has been extensively justified. 
The degradation pathways of the four active substances have been sufficiently studied and taken into 
account in the design of the finished product. Possible interference during analysis testing has been also 
addressed. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory 
and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non-clinical toxicology program has been previously undertaken in support of the 
registration of FTC and TDF. For EVG and COBI, the toxicology package included repeated-dose oral 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 20/147 
 
  
  
 
toxicity studies in mice (up to 13 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks), dogs (up to 39 weeks), in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity studies; 2-year oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats; and a full developmental and 
reproductive toxicity program.  
The pivotal toxicology and the majority of the safety pharmacology studies conducted by the applicant 
were reported to be GLP compliant. The safety studies that were not conducted to GLP were conducted to 
an appropriate scientific standard. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of cobicistat (COBI) is inhibition of human CYP3A enzymes, 
whereby the IC50 value for inhibition of human hepatic microsomal midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity is 
0.15 μM. The inhibition of CYP3A enzymes in human hepatocytes was time-dependent and co-factor 
(NADPH)-dependent). Elvitegravir (EVG) inhibited DNA strand-transfer with an IC50 value of 8.8 nM and 
inhibited laboratory strains and various clinical isolates of HIV-1 with an EC50 of 0.38 nM. Emtricitabine 
(FTC) is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is converted in vivo to 
tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Both FTC 
and tenofovir act as inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies 
Elvitegravir did not inhibit the activity of human topoisomerase I and II enzymes, cellular enzymes that 
display analogous activities to the viral integrase activity. The previously approved anti-virals, FTC and 
TDF had a high selectivity for HIV reverse transcriptase and were very weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA 
polymerases α, β, δ, ε, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. 
Elvitegravir, COBI, FTC, and TDF demonstrated low cytotoxicity in a variety of human cell types. 
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors carry a class labelling for mitochondrial toxicity; however, 
both FTC and TDF have shown a low potential for mitochondrial toxicity in long term toxicity studies. The 
potential for mitochondrial toxicity of EVG was considered low based on assessment of the mitochondrial 
DNA levels in HepG2 liver cells and the potential for mitochondrial toxicity by COBI is also considered to 
be low. As EVG and COBI are not anticipated to significantly increase the exposure of FTC and TDF, the 
potential for mitochondrial toxicity with the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDFD combination is low. 
Elvitegravir, FTC, and TDF exhibited no pharmacologically significant affinity at the secondary targets 
tested, while significant binding to the hCav1.2 L-type calcium channel (IC50 6 µM), hERG potassium 
channel (IC50 1.8 µM), and the hNav1.5 sodium channel site-2 (IC50 86.5 µM) was observed with COBI. 
The effective concentrations for binding to these targets were ≥20-fold higher than that proposed in 
humans following administration of COBI at 150 mg (assuming 6.3% unbound drug). 
Safety Pharmacology Programme 
EVG, FTC, and TDF had little effect on vital organ systems in safety pharmacology studies. Cobicistat 
showed the potential to decrease LV function and prolong the PR interval in the isolated rabbit heart at 
concentrations approximately 11-fold higher than those observed clinically; these effects are likely due to 
the observed interaction with cardiac calcium channels. No significant changes in ECG parameters or LV 
function were observed clinically; hence, the potential of COBI to decrease LV function and prolong PR is 
considered to be low. Given the favourable safety pharmacology profiles of EVG, FTC, and TDF, 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 21/147 
 
  
  
combination of these 3 agents with COBI is not expected to exacerbate the potential for minor 
cardiovascular effects with COBI.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A series of method validation, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetic drug 
interaction studies have been conducted. Modest to high absorption was observed in animals following 
oral administration of EVG, COBI, FTC and TDF. Studies in the dog demonstrated that generally 
comparable exposures for each of the 4 components can be achieved through co-formulation, relative to 
co-administration of the individual clinical formulations. With respect to the new active substances, EVG 
showed moderate oral bioavailability in the rat and dog (with values similar in fasted and non-fasted 
animals), while the bioavailability of COBI was moderate in the rat and low in the dog in monkey (due to 
high first pass metabolism in these species). 
Following oral administration, all 4 components were widely distributed and it was noted that for both EVG 
and COBI, drug-related material was largely excluded from the brain and the eye. Although plasma 
protein binding of EVG is high, the binding is very low for FTC and TFV, and moderate for COBI; hence, 
interactions via binding displacement are not anticipated. An in vivo study whereby [14C]EVG was 
co-administered with RTV, revealed no change in the tissue distribution of EVG, and no increase in CNS 
penetration of EVG. Hence, the potential for drug interactions, within the 4 drug combination, that would 
affect drug distribution is considered to be low. 
Elvitegravir is largely eliminated by oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (the major route) and by 
glucuronidation (minor route) by UGT1A1 and 1A3. When administered with a CYP3A inhibitor, such as 
COBI, oxidative metabolism is blocked and the resulting bioavailability and half-life of EVG are compatible 
with once-daily dosing. In the rat and dog, M1 (GS-9202, p-hydroxylated- EVG) was identified as the 
most abundant metabolite, followed by M4 (GS-9200, EVG acyl glucuronide) and M7 (JTP-74488, M1 
glucuronide); however the parent compound, EVG was the most abundant component circulating in 
plasma. 
Cobicistat is a potent time-dependent and co-factor-dependent inhibitor of human CYP3A enzymes, in 
contrast to its effect in non-clinical species, whereby the clearance of COBI is high due to a lack of 
self-inhibition of metabolism. The primary routes of metabolism of COBI are oxidation by CYP3A (major) 
and CYP2D6 (minor) enzymes and COBI was extensively metabolized in all species examined, including 
humans. The parent compound, COBI was the major component in plasma. Metabolites M21, M26, and 
M31 were identified in mouse, rat, dog, and human samples in vitro, and were later identified in the 
excreta from these species. M31 [GS-9612 (oxidation of isopropylthiazole), E3], was identified as the 
most abundant metabolite in the mouse, rat, and dog. One other primary metabolite, M39, was also 
identified in all species in vivo. Other metabolites arise from secondary metabolism, due to combinations 
of these primary pathways, and from other minor primary metabolites. There were no unique or major 
(> 10%) human metabolites. 
The intended pharmacokinetic drug interaction of inhibition of the CYP3A dependent metabolism of EVG 
by COBI has been studied extensively in vitro and in humans in vivo. In the rat, following 
co-administration with COBI at 30 mg/kg/day, exposures to EVG (AUC) were increased in males (when 
compared to that observed when EVG was administered alone) on Day 1. The effect was less pronounced 
in females due to the lower contribution of CYP3A to EVG metabolism. 
Non-clinical and clinical data suggest that COBI is a relatively selective inhibitor and has a low potential to 
be an inducer in man. The metabolites of COBI are weaker inhibitors of CYP3A compared to COBI and due 
to their low systemic concentrations should not contribute to the primary pharmacodynamic effect of 
CYP3A inhibition. Neither FTC nor TDF interact with drug metabolizing enzymes as substrates, inhibitors, 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 22/147 
 
  
  
or inducers and that suggests that metabolic drug interactions between these agents and EVG or COBI are 
unlikely. 
EVG and COBI were identified as inhibitors of OATP1B1 (IC50 value 3.5 μM) and OATP1B3 (IC50 values 
1.88 μM), and were subsequently identified as substrates of the hepatic transporters in vitro. The data 
presented do not suggest significant clinical implications with respect to the exposures of the Stribild 
components. However, when the two agents were co-administered with the OATP substrate, 
rosuvastatin, modest increase in rosuvastatin exposure was observed. 
Emtricitabine did not undergo extensive first pass or systemic metabolism, and was eliminated primarily 
by renal excretion of unchanged drug. The total body clearance of FTC exceeded the glomerular filtration 
rate, suggesting the drug is actively secreted by renal tubules into the urine. Renal excretion was the 
primary systemic route of elimination of TFV in all non-clinical species tested. Since FTC and TFV are 
almost exclusively eliminated by renal excretion, while very little EVG or COBI is excreted in the urine; it 
is considered that the potential for interactions between the compounds during excretion is low. 
Cobicistat and EVG are weak inhibitors of intestinal efflux transporters; however, high concentrations of 
COBI in the intestinal lumen, which are achievable briefly during absorption, may inhibit P-gp and result 
in a modest increase in TFV exposure (as seen with RTV-boosted protease inhibitors and Stribild). 
Cobicistat inhibits the renal efflux transporter, novel organic cation transporter 1 (OCTN1; IC50 2.49 μM) 
at concentrations that are within range of the total C max (1.57 µM). Cobicistat is also an in vitro inhibitor 
of the renal transporters, OCT2 (IC50 14.4 μM) and MATE1 (IC50 1.87 μM), which have been shown to 
transport creatinine and are thought to play a role in the active secretion of creatinine by the kidney (in 
addition to the majority of creatinine which is renally excreted by passive glomerular filtration). In a 
subsequent study EVG was also shown to inhibit OCT2 (IC50 >20 μM) and MATE1 (IC50 2 μM). Inhibition 
of OCT2 and/or MATE1, and thus inhibition of active secretion of creatinine by the kidney, provides a 
plausible mechanistic explanation for the reduction in creatinine clearance seen during COBI dosing, in 
the absence of changes of true GFR. It was noted that Stribild did not have a more pronounced effect on 
MATE1 than COBI alone. 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, the effects on additional 
transporter systems have been performed. A detailed overview of the potential pharmacokinetic 
interactions between the constituents suggests that aside from the interactions listed previously, the 
potential for clinically relevant interactions at the level of CYP enzymes or any of the remaining 
transporter systems are low. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity studies conducted using the oral route with EVG didn’t induce mortality in animals even at 
very high doses (up to 2000 mg/kg). Emesis was described in dogs after oral administration that wasn’t 
observed after IV injection. Hypoactivity was described in mice receiving 300 mg/kg COBI PO. No signs of 
toxicity were described with FTC in rats at doses up to 4000 mg/kg PO. Renal toxicity since 90 mg/kg was 
observed in dogs treated with TDF. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeated-dose studies demonstrate that EVG is well tolerated for up to 6 months in the rat and 9 
months in the dog at doses producing systemic exposure levels in animals 2.3- to 36-fold greater than 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 23/147 
 
  
  
those in patients treated with the recommended clinical dose. No adverse target-organ toxicity was 
observed in single- or repeated-dose studies with EVG. 
Treatment-related effects included changes in cecum weights, dilation of the cecum, and the presence of 
lipid vacuoles in the lamina propria of the upper small intestines of rats and dogs. In these species, 
changes in the cecum were not accompanied by any histological changes or gastrointestinal (GI) adverse 
events. Similar changes in the cecum have been reported with antibacterial quinolones which affect the 
GI microflora. Elvitegravir has a quinolone moiety and was confirmed to have antibacterial activity in the 
reverse mutation assay. Although the activity was much weaker than that of the antibacterial quinolones, 
the changes in the cecum were considered to be due to the anti-bacterial activity of high local 
concentrations of EVG in the GI tract. 
The incidence and severity of lipid vacuoles in the upper small intestines did not increase with repeated 
dosing of EVG, which was questioned by the CHMP as the 13-week rat study suggested otherwise. 
However, it was evident that there was no evidence of toxicity or any adverse tissue reactions associated 
with these vacuoles. The vacuolization is considered related to the high local EVG concentrations to which 
the GI epithelium was exposed. These effects were not considered adverse and in most cases, these 
minor effects were slowly reversible after a recovery period. It is noted that this finding occurs at 
exposures similar and in excess to those observed clinically. However, in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity 
study there were no notable findings in the upper small intestine, further suggesting that the presence of 
the vacuoles was not adverse or of toxicological significance. 
Target organs identified for COBI were the liver (mouse, rat, and dog) and thyroid (rat). Slight, 
non-adverse hematological changes were noted in rats and slight clinical chemistry changes were 
observed in mice, rats, and dogs, with urinalysis changes noted primarily at high doses in rats and dogs. 
In rats, the thyroid changes are considered rodent-specific, secondary to microsomal enzyme induction 
and thyroid hormone imbalance, and it is unlikely that COBI presents a risk to the human thyroid. Liver 
changes in mice, rats, and dogs included microsomal enzyme induction, increased weights, and 
hepatocellular hypertrophy and/or vacuolation. All effects appeared to be completely reversible after a 1- 
or 3-month recovery period and were considered to be adaptive responses. Urinalysis changes (higher 
urine volume, lower urine specific gravity, increases in electrolyte excretion) showed no progression after 
long term dosing, were not associated with remarkable serum chemistry or histopathological correlates, 
and were reversible. Other potential toxicities related to COBI that were observed in non-clinical studies 
include PR interval prolongation in the 4-week dog toxicity study and decreases in left ventricular (LV) 
function in isolated rabbit hearts. 
Combination toxicity studies of COBI with EVG did not result in unexpected or additive toxicity.  
For the currently authorised compounds: emtricitabine has an established clinical safety profile with no 
significant toxicities observed. The only toxicity observed in chronic animal studies with FTC was mild, 
reversible anaemia in mice and minor decreases in erythrocyte counts/increases in mean corpuscular 
haemoglobin in monkeys at large multiples of clinical exposure (137-fold in mice; 21-fold in monkeys); 
therefore, these haematological findings are not considered relevant to clinical use and in theory, should 
not cause an overlapping toxicity with COBI that produced minimal decreases (< 10%) in red blood cell 
parameters in rats at the maximum doses tested.  
For tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the principal target organs of toxicity following oral 
administration were the kidney (karyomegaly, tubular degeneration), bone, and GI tract (in rodents). 
These correlate with the known clinical toxicities of TDF (renal and bone toxicity). It is noted that 
cobicistat was associated with urinalysis and urine chemistry changes (increased urine volume; 
decreased urine specific gravity; increased electrolyte excretions) at high doses in rats and dogs. 
However, these changes showed no progression after long-term dosing, were reversible, were not 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 24/147 
 
  
  
associated with remarkable clinical chemistry changes, including serum creatinine and BUN, and were 
without morphological evidence of kidney damage.  
GI toxicity is dose limiting in rodents for TDF, and was due to high local concentrations. For EVG, changes 
in the cecum and upper small intestine in rats and dogs were due to high local concentrations and were 
not considered adverse. It is noted that in some instances, erosion of the stomach has been reported 
following repeated administration of COBI. However, these findings were not observed in the pivotal 
studies or in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies; hence the potential for additive effects on the 
gastrointestinal tract is considered to be low. 
Cobicistat, EVG, and FTC have not shown any potential for bone toxicity in chronic rat and dog toxicity 
studies; thus the non-clinical data do not predict any exacerbation of any TDF effects on bone. 
Genotoxicity 
Of the 4 compounds, only TDF was genotoxic (mouse lymphoma cell assay and UDS assay). Although EVG 
showed an equivocal effect in an in vitro chromosome aberration study, it was negative in 2 in vivo 
micronucleus studies and is unlikely to have the potential to induce chromosome aberrations in vivo. The 
combination of FTC and TDF in a mouse lymphoma cell assay did not exacerbate the genotoxic potential 
of TDF. Given the findings presented, the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF combination is should not alter the 
genotoxicity profile of the individual agents.  
Carcinogenicity 
Elvitegravir, FTC and TDF have all demonstrated low carcinogenic potential in conventional 2-year 
studies. COBI was not genotoxic and in the mouse, COBI was not carcinogenic at exposures that were 
7-to 16-fold higher than those observed clinically. In the rat, following repeated oral administration for a 
minimum of 97 weeks at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/day (males) and 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (females), 
COBI caused an increased incidence of combined thyroid follicular cell adenoma and carcinomas at 
exposures (AUC) that were lower than that observed clinically. It is acknowledged that the thyroid and 
liver changes are considered adaptive changes, secondary to hepatic microsomal enzyme induction due 
to activation of PXR. Given that this extent of activation of PXR and CYP3A does not occur at clinically 
relevant concentrations in humans, COBI is not considered to pose a carcinogenic risk in man. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Elvitegravir, COBI, FTC, and TDF were not teratogenic reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. 
However, TDF reduced the viability index and weight of pups in peri and –post natal toxicity studies at 
maternally toxic doses. In addition, cobicistat at 125 mg/kg/day increased in post implantation loss and 
decreased foetal weights also at maternally toxic doses.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has conducted a full environmental risk assessment and the results are summarised in the 
tables below.  
For the adsorption-desorption study, the Kd and K OC values for EVG exceed the trigger values. Hence the 
applicant has agreed to progress to Phase IIb of the assessment. An environmental risk assessment for 
the terrestrial compartment including an OECD 307, OECD 216, OECD 208, OECD 207 and a Collembolan 
reproduction test (ISO 11267) will be performed by the applicant. During the studies performed to 
evaluate transformation in aquatic sediment systems, as sediment shifting of the drug substance (which 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 25/147 
 
  
  
is a new active substance) was demonstrated (sediment shifting > 10%) with both EVG and COBI, the 
effects on sediment organisms will be investigated further. In addition, the Applicant has agreed to 
conduct a tailored environmental risk assessment for tenofovir, including an adsorption/desorption study 
(OECD 106), transformation studies in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308) and an Early-Life Stage 
Toxicity Test (OECD 210). Transformation products ≥10% will be fully characterized. These additional 
studies will be provided by Q2 2015.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed by Q2 2015: 
•  Update the environmental risk assessment to clarify the effects of EVG on the terrestrial 
compartment, the effects of EVG and COBI on sediment dwelling organisms, the transformation 
products of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and the effects of tenofovir on the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction package for the anti-viral agents 
EVG, FTC and TDF are considered adequate and is further discussed in clinical pharmacology. No serious 
concerns rise from the studies on secondary pharmacodynamic effects. The safety pharmacology data 
support the effective and safe use of these 4 agents together in combination for treatment of HIV-1.

PK data showed that generally comparable exposures for each of the 4 components can be achieved 
through co-formulation and that the potential for drug interactions, within the 4 drug combination, that 
would affect drug distribution is considered to be low.  
Elvitegravir is largely eliminated by oxidative metabolism by CYP3A (the major route) and by 
glucuronidation (minor route) by UGT1A1 and 1A3. Cobicistat is a potent time-dependent and 
co-factor-dependent inhibitor of human CYP3A enzymes, in contrast to its effect in non-clinical species, 
whereby the clearance of COBI is high due to a lack of self-inhibition of metabolism. The primary routes 
of metabolism of COBI are oxidation by CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) enzymes. The 
pharmacokinetic drug interaction of inhibition of the CYP3A dependent metabolism of EVG by COBI is the 
intended effect of COBI. COBI is a relatively selective inhibitor of CYP3A and has a low potential to be an 
inducer in man. The potential for interactions between the compounds during excretion is considered to 
be low. Cobicistat and EVG are weak inhibitors of intestinal efflux transporters. Cobicistat also inhibits the 
renal efflux transporter, novel organic cation transporter 1 (OCTN1) at concentrations that are within 
range of the total Cmax. Cobicistat is also an in vitro inhibitor of the renal transporters, OCT2 and MATE1. 
Inhibition of OCT2 and/or MATE1, and thus inhibition of active secretion of creatinine by the kidney, 
provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for the reduction in creatinine clearance seen during COBI 
dosing, in the absence of changes of true GFR.  When EVG and COBI were co-administered with an OATP 
substrate, rosuvastatin, modest increase in rosuvastatin exposure was observed.  
Aside from the identified potential interactions, the potential for clinically relevant interactions at the level 
of CYP enzymes or any of the remaining transporter systems is considered to be low. In addition, as 
indicated in the Risk Management Plan, further studies to confirm the potential for inhibition of UGT 
enzymes are being performed by the Applicant and the results are to be provided to the CHMP. The 
potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between the constituents and other concomitant medicinal 
products is summarized in Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
No adverse target-organ toxicity was observed in single- or repeated-dose studies with EVG. The 
observed EVG treatment-related effects of changes in cecum weights, dilation of the cecum, and the 
presence of lipid vacuoles were found not to be of toxicological significance.  
Target organs identified for COBI were the liver (mouse, rat, and dog) and thyroid (rat). The thyroid 
changes In rats were considered rodent-specific, and it is unlikely that COBI presents a risk to the human 
thyroid. Liver changes in mice, rats, and dogs appeared to be completely reversible after a 1- or 3-month 
recovery period and were considered to be adaptive responses. Other potential toxicities related to COBI 
that were observed in non-clinical studies include PR interval prolongation in the 4-week dog toxicity 
study and decreases in left ventricular (LV) function in isolated rabbit hearts. 
Potential toxicities related to COBI observed in the non-clinical studies (decreases in LV function, 
urinalysis and urine chemistry changes, immunosuppressive effects [lower anti-KLH IgG antibody titers] 
in female rats, and adaptive liver and thyroid changes), have not been observed in Phase 1 and 2 clinical 
studies conducted to date with COBI or with the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF STR. Cobicistat has the potential to 
prolong the PR interval; a modest, dosing-related increase in PR interval observed in the thorough QT 
study which was not considered to be clinically significant. 
For the currently authorised compounds: emtricitabine has an established clinical safety profile with no 
significant toxicities observed. For tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the principal target organs of 
toxicity following oral administration were the kidney (karyomegaly, tubular degeneration), bone, and GI 
tract (in rodents). These correlate with the known clinical toxicities of TDF (renal and bone toxicity). 
It has been suggested that there is little potential for exacerbation of the observed toxicity, when all 4 
components of Stribild are co-administered, as the components do not appear to have overlapping 
toxicity profiles.

Although, the non-clinical data presented do not currently suggest a potential for exaggerated renal 
toxicity with Stribild, COBI and EVG is associated with inhibition of human renal transporters OCT2, MRP4, 
and MATE2-K (COBI only). Moreover there is evidence of increased renal toxicity with Stribild in man. 
Preliminary data suggest that FTC, COBI and EVG do not affect the cytotoxicity of TFV in renal proximal 
tubule cells and that COBI has no effect on TFV accumulation in isolated renal cortical tissue. In line with 
the Risk Management plan, the Applicant is in the process of conducting additional studies in order to 
elucidate the mechanism for the renal toxicity observed with the 4 components of Stribild. 
The CHMP noted that EVG possesses a quinolone moiety within its structure and consequently possesses 
some antibiotic properties as demonstrated in the Ames test. It is unlikely that the antibacterial 
properties of EVG would have a major impact on the risk-benefit for Stribild. However, the Applicant has 
been recommended to conduct additional studies to determine the EVG MIC for a number of common 
bacteria in the human gut and assess MICs in light of its estimated intra-colonic concentrations. The 
interpretation of the results will need to be measured against the lack of evidence that any effect of EVG 
on gut flora that may occur has any clinical consequences. 
Given the findings presented, the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF combination is should not alter the genotoxicity 
profile of the individual agents. Elvitegravir, FTC and TDF have all demonstrated low carcinogenic 
potential in conventional 2-year studies and COBI is not considered to pose a carcinogenic risk in man. 
Although, the potential for the EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF combination to have additive effects on the foetus is 
considered to be low, the observed effects on foetal weight and viability are captured within Section 5.3 
of the SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, there are no major objections on the non-clinical aspects to the approval of this application. The 
outstanding issues are minor and do not preclude recommendation for granting a Marketing 
Authorisation. 
The CHMP considers the following non-clinical measures necessary post-authorisation, which are included 
in the Risk Management Plan: 
• 
In vitro studies to assess the potential for EVG to inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 (by Q2 2013). 
•  Studies to investigate the possible mechanisms that could lead to an additive or synergistic toxic 
effect of COBI + TDF on renal tubular function and/or a decrease in the aGFR during Stribild therapy 
(by Q3 2013) 
In addition the CHMP recommends the Applicant to conduct the following measures post-authorisation to 
elucidate potential concerns regarding the antibacterial properties and regarding the environmental risk 
assessment: 
•  Additional studies to investigate the effects of EVG on aerobic and anaerobic species found in the gut 
and to compare these with estimated intra-colonic concentrations of EVG (recommended by Q1 
2014).  
•  An updated environmental risk assessment which clarifies the effects of EVG on the terrestrial 
compartment, the effects of EVG and COBI on sediment dwelling organisms, the transformation 
products of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and the effects of tenofovir on the environment 
(recommended by Q2 2015).

During the procedure the applicant completed an additional DDI study between TDF and COBI 
(GS-US-216-0134) and data were reported from two studies ongoing at the time of submission as 
follows: 
Table 6.   
•  Stribild is presented for use as a bilayer tablet – one layer contains EVG/COBI and one FTC/TDF.  
• 
The EVG/COBI layer was developed in accordance with the planned standalone tablet formulations 
and involved changes over time. In study GS-US-236-0101 COBI 150 mg administered as part of 
Stribild was found to boost EVG exposure to levels similar to those obtained with EVG/r. This 
formulation was used in the Phase 2 study GS-US-236-0104. 
•  Subsequently the isolation of COBI on a solid carrier resulted in a switch from an ethanolic solution to 
a solid form (i.e. COBI on silicon dioxide) in the manufacturing process. Study GS-US-236-0110 
compared this proposed commercial formulation (used in Phase 3 studies GS-US-236-0102 
and -0103) with the original formulation.  
Elvitegravir 
The  bioanalytical  method  involved  SPE  from  human  plasma  and  LC-MS/MS  with  positive  ionisation. 
Initially, calibration curves ranged from 1 (LLQ) to 1000 ng/mL. The fully validated bioanalytical method 
gave calibration curves from 20-10,000 ng/mL. A similar assay method applied to urine samples gave 
calibration curves that ranged from 32.5 (LLQ) to 1300 ng/mL.

COBI 
The method involved SPE followed by LC-MS/MS with positive ionisation. Initial calibration ranged from 5 
(LLQ) to 1000 or 2500 ng/mL. In a later version the range was 10-5000 ng/mL. The range for GS-8374 
was 20-10000 ng/mL and for GS-9612 was 5-2500 ng/mL while that for GS-341842 and GS-342006 was 
5-5000 ng/mL.  
Bioavailability 
EVG 
XAX1-1 evaluated single unboosted doses from 100 mg to 800 mg (using 50 mg or 200 mg tablets) in 
fasted Japanese males. Cmax and AUCinf of EVG and M4 increased in a less than dose-proportional manner 
with dose proportionality constants β of 0.723 and 0.789, respectively, and 95% CIs for both parameters 
that did not include 1. The plasma exposures (AUCinf) of M4 were < 10% of EVG. XAX1-2 was of similar 
design but evaluated 50 - 400 mg doses as 50 mg solid dispersion tablets the EVG dose proportionality 
constant β was 1.043 for Cmax and 1.103 for AUCinf. Plasma exposures (AUCinf) of M4 were < 10% of EVG 
across all doses. 
GS-US-183-0102 evaluated the PK of EVG 100 mg (2 x 50 mg) BID without (Days 1-10) and with ritonavir 
(RTV) 100 mg BID (Days 11-20) when taken in the fed state. Without RTV the EVG steady-state mean 
AUCtau was ~ 20% lower vs. a single dose (AUCinf), indicating modest auto-induction of its metabolism. 
With RTV there was a significant increase in systemic exposures with high trough concentrations, greater 
than predicted steady-state AUC and a longer median elimination half-life (T1/2) (9.5 vs.  3.5 hours). The 
applicant concluded that administration with RTV improved oral bioavailability due to decreased first-pass 
metabolism and reduced systemic clearance.  
A further study (GS-US-183-0113) evaluated co-administration of RTV doses from 20-200 mg once daily 
with 125 mg EVG once daily for 10 days with dosing in the fed state. Midazolam (MDZ) 1 mg intravenous 
was also given in the afternoon on day 1, 11 and 21. RTV resulted in increases in Cmax, AUCtau and Ctau of 
EVG  that  were  less  than  RTV-dose  proportional.  The  apparent  clearance  of  EVG  decreased  and  t1/2 
increased  as  the  RTV  dose  increased  with  a  plateau  around  100  mg  suggesting  that  near  maximal 
inhibition of CYP3A was attained at 50 -100 mg RTV. 
Plasma levels of GS-9202 (M1) and 1′-OH MDZ were BLLQ at most time points. GS-9200 (M4) was < 10% 
of the corresponding EVG exposures with a ratio that was unaffected by the RTV dose. Most subjects had 
no measurable M4 by 12 h post-dose. The applicant concluded that increasing doses of RTV did not affect 
the formation or elimination of M4 such that linear PK was maintained. 
There were greater than dose proportional increases in RTV Cmax, AUCtau and  Ctau. The dose-response 
curve ED50 for hepatic CYP3A4 (as assessed using intravenous MDZ) was 12.2 mg. 
COBI 
GS-US-216-0101 (50 - 200 mg) and GS-US-216-0113 (300 - 400 mg), each with administration in the 
fed state, showed that the bioavailability of COBI increased with dose before reaching a plateau ≥ 200 mg 
and  also  increased  with  multiple  vs.  single  dose  administrations.  The  data  were  consistent  with  its 
metabolic auto-inhibition properties.  
In  GS-US-216-0101  peak  COBI  concentrations  were  mostly  observed  ~  4  to  4.5  hours  post-dose. 
Increases in COBI AUCinf were ~ 6.8-fold and ~ 5.1-fold, respectively, for doubling of doses from 50 to 
100 mg and from 100 to 200 mg.

Table 7.   
In GS-US-216-0113 on dosing at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily for 7 days (with 100 mg tablets) COBI 
exhibited nonlinear PK with respect to time and dose. Single-dose escalation from 300 to 400 mg resulted 
in  statistically  significant  decreases  in  CL/F  and  corresponding  increases  in  AUC  and  Cmax,  without 
changes in T1/2. Comparison of 300 mg data revealed a large decrease in CL/F and increases in T1/2, 
AUC and Cmax with multiple doses, indicative of changes in COBI bioavailability, systemic clearance or 
both with time. 
EVG plus COBI 
Cohort 2 of GS-US-216-0116 (see below) received multiple dosing as follows: 
• 
• 
Treatment C: EVG 150 mg + COBI 150 mg F2 every morning for 10 consecutive days 
Treatment D: EVG 150 mg + RTV 100 mg every morning for 10 consecutive days 
Bioequivalence was shown for EVG when boosted with the F2 COBI tablet (EVG/COBI) vs. EVG/rtv. 
Bioequivalence 
EVG 
GS-US-183-0140 compared the 125 mg tablet used in the Phase II EVG study (GS-US-183-0105) with 
the  150  mg  F2  tablet  intended  for  commercial  use  that  was  administered in  the  Phase  III  EVG  study 
(GS-US-183-0145). Each formulation was administered with 100 mg RTV every morning within 5 minutes 
of a meal for 10 days. The results met the BE criteria (AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau). The comparisons of rtv 
exposures also fell within the bounds of 80% to 125%.

Table 8.  Single- and Multiple Dose (Once Daily) PK of EVG Administered as EVG/r Using the Phase 2 
(125 mg) or Phase 3 (150 mg Formulations in Healthy Subjects) 
AUC and Cmax were comparable between single-dose (AUCinf) and multiple-dose (AUCtau) administration of 
EVG/r, indicating substantial inhibition of EVG metabolism/first-pass by RTV. Elvitegravir C24 was ~ 26% 
higher following multiple-dose administration (349 vs. 440 ng/mL), consistent with the development of 
mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A by RTV and consequent reduction in EVG systemic clearance as well 
as progression to steady-state conditions. 
COBI 
GS-US-216-0116 compared the Phase III formulation (150 mg F2) with the Phase II version (F1 150 mg) 
after dosing Cohort 1 for 10 days. The 90% CIs around the GMRs for COBI AUC tau, Ctau, and Cmax showed 
bioequivalence  between  the  formulations.  Bioequivalence  was  also  shown  for  MDZ  and  1-OH  MDZ 
exposures, indicating comparable inhibition of CYP3A by the two COBI formulations.  
Stribild 
GS-US-236-0101 evaluated the relative bioavailability of tablets containing EVG 150 mg, FTC 200 mg, 
TDF 300 mg plus COBI at either 100 mg or 150 mg vs. EVG/rtv 150/100 mg and vs. FTC 200 mg + TDF 
300 mg. All dosing was once daily in the fed state for 10 days. The table below summarises the results.  
•  EVG with COBI 100 mg was bioequivalent to EVG/r as assessed by EVG AUCtau and Cmax but 37% 
lower as assessed by Ctau estimate  
•  EVG exposure was modestly higher for Stribild containing COBI 150 mg vs. 100 mg such that the 
upper bound of the 90% CI of AUCtau exceeded the criteria by 1%. EVG trough concentrations (Ctau) 
were 9% higher than with EVG/r when the COBI dose was 150 mg, resulting in high IQ95 values 
(Ctrough/IC95 [protein-binding adjusted]).  
• 
The AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau values for COBI increased in a greater than proportional manner to dose. 
The COBI metabolite GS-341842 (E5) was undetectable at most time points while the GS-342006 
(E1) metabolite was present at very low concentrations (< 1.5% of parent exposure by AUC) 
following administration of the Stribild. Mean plasma exposure (AUC) of GS-364751 (E3) was < 3% 
of COBI exposure at the 150 mg dose.

Table 9.   
• 
Tenofovir AUCtau met the bioequivalence criterion. The TFV Cmax and Ctau were slightly higher after 
administration of the Stribild vs. FTC + TDF but comparable with TFV exposures reported when TDF 
was co-administered with a PI/r. Higher TFV exposures with Stribild were attributed to the effect of 
COBI on P-glycoprotein (Pgp or MDR1) transporter in the gut. Emtricitabine AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau 
were modestly higher with Stribild.  
GS-US-236-0110 compared Stribild F2 used in Phase III and intended for the market with the F1 tablet 
used in the Phase 2 study GS-US-236-0104. The F2 tablet is 15% smaller in size and employs the updated 
mode of manufacture of COBI. The third group received FTC 200 mg + TDF 300 mg co-administered (not 
Truvada). Dosing was daily for 10 days within 5 minutes of a meal. 
•  EVG and COBI exposures showed bioequivalence between formulations. 
•  Emtricitabine exposure was bioequivalent when administered as a component of the F2 relative to 
administration of FTC + TDF.

• 
TFV exposures were higher (26% for AUC; there was no change in t1/2) with the F2 relative to 
administration of FTC + TDF but the applicant considered that exposures were clinically comparable 
between Stribild and Truvada.

The applicant concluded that exposures to the components of the F2 formulation were appropriate and 
this (intended commercial) formulation was used in Phase 3 studies (GS-US-236-0102 and -0103). 
Influence of food 
Stribild 
GS-US-236-0105 evaluated the effect of food (fasted, light and high-fat meal) when the F1 tablet (EVG 
150 mg, COBI 150 mg, FTC 200 mg, TDF 300 mg) was administered once daily for 15 days.

•  COBI AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax met bioequivalence criteria for light meal vs. fasted conditions. There 
were decreases from 17% to 27% with a high-calorie/high-fat meal vs. the fasted state or vs. a light 
meal but the differences were not considered to affect the ability of COBI to boost EVG exposure.  
• 
The maximum increases in EVG exposure vs. fasted state (AUCinf 87%, AUClast 91% and Cmax 56%) 
were seen following a high-calorie/high-fat meal. Modest increases in EVG exposure (AUCinf 34%, 
AUClast 36%, and Cmax 22%) occurred with a light meal vs. fasted state.  
•  Emtricitabine PK was not affected by food. 
• 
The AUC TFV increased by about 23-25% in the fed state regardless of the type of meal. Cmax 
increased by 20% after a light meal vs. fasted administration but this was not observed after a high 
fat/high calorie meal. 
Table 11.   
Excretion 
EVG 
In  the  mass  balance  study  (GS-US-183-0126),  using  RTV  (100  mg)-boosted  [14C]EVG  (50  mg  total 
dose) in the fed state, the T1/2 of the administered radioactivity from pooled plasma samples was similar 
to that observed for EVG (9.64 vs. 9.59 hours). The combined faecal and urinary recovery accounted for 
101% of the administered radioactive dose, which was almost all in faeces. The radioactivity in faeces was 
mainly  due  to  EVG  and  GS-9202.  The  applicant  considered  that  EVG  in  faeces  (30.8%)  was  likely  a 
combination of unabsorbed drug, biliary secretion of EVG itself and biliary secretion of GS-9200 converted 
back to EVG by the β-glucuronidases in the intestinal microflora. Renal elimination accounted for 6.7% of 
the administered dose, mostly as the glucuronide of EVG or its hydroxylation products (M7, M19, and 
M20).  
COBI 
In the mass balance study GS-US-216-0111 after a 150 mg dose of [14C]COBI on day 7 following 150 mg 
daily  for  6  days,  86.2%  of  the  dose  was  recovered in  faeces,  consistent  with  hepatobiliary  excretion, 
primarily as parent drug or metabolites M21 (GS-9454 or E1) or M31 (GS-9612, or E3). In most subjects, 
plasma radioactivity was undetectable beyond 32 h. COBI was the major species in the faeces (27%), 
followed  by  the  oxidative  metabolites  -  E3  (14%;  hydroxylation  of  isopropyl  thiazole)  and  E1  (5.5%; 
carbamate cleavage) – and others in trace amounts. Only 8.2% of the administered dose was recovered

in  urine,  primarily  as  unchanged  parent  drug  and  with  low  levels  of  metabolites  M21  and  M31.  COBI 
displayed  both  dose-  and  time-dependent  changes  in  apparent  clearance  (CL/F),  consistent  with  the 
properties of a mechanism-based inhibitor.  
In GS-US-126-0101 COBI exhibited nonlinear PK with respect to dose and time. Single-dose escalation 
from 50 mg to 100 mg and from 100 mg to 200 mg resulted in dramatic decreases in COBI CL/F. Similarly, 
apparent clearance of COBI at steady state (CLss/F) was reduced with increasing dose levels (ratios were 
33.49% and 42.48%, respectively). Lower apparent clearances were observed following multiple doses at 
all dose levels. Ratios (single vs. multiple doses) were 312%, 219% and 199% for 50, 100 and 200 mg 
doses, respectively. 
Metabolism 
EVG 
In  the  mass  balance  study  with  EVG/rtv  (as  described  above)  the  predominant  circulating  species  in 
plasma was EVG (~ 94% of radioactivity). All observed metabolites, including several minor metabolites, 
constituted  <  10%  relative  systemic  exposure  (AUCtau)  to  EVG.  In-vitro  studies  indicated  that 
biotransformation  of  EVG  is  primarily  via  CYP-mediated  aromatic  and  aliphatic  hydroxylation  and/or 
primary  or  secondary  glucuronidation.  Following  unboosted  administration  there  are  two  primary 
metabolites (essentially virologically inactive):  
M1 (GS-9202) is produced by CYP3A4 and its formation is almost completely inhibited by RTV or 
COBI (typically BLLQ 20 ng/mL) 
M4 (GS-9200) is produced by UGT1A1/3, which becomes the predominant route of metabolism in 
the  boosted  state.  The  AUCtau  of  GS-9200  (M4)  is  typically  <  10%  of  that  for  EVG  and  is 
unaffected by boosting.

COBI 
In the mass balance study COBI represented 98.6% of the circulating radioactivity in plasma. In-vitro 
studies showed that COBI is extensively metabolised via CYP3A (major) and CYP2D6 (minor) mediated 
oxidation, with no evidence of direct Phase 2 metabolism. Primary metabolites include isopropyl oxidation 
(M31, GS-9612), cleavage at the N-methylurea (M26, GS-341842), cleavage  of the carbamate (M21, 
GS-9454) and cleavage and deethylation of the morpholine (M39). CYP3A can catalyse all reactions, while 
CYP2D6  contributes  to  the  generation  of  M31.  Mean  plasma  exposures  of  M31  were  <  3%  of  COBI 
exposure (AUC) after a single 150 mg dose or multiple doses of Stribild. 
Distribution 
EVG 
In equilibrium dialysis studies EVG was ~98% to 99% bound to human plasma proteins regardless of 
concentration, with preferential binding to albumin over AAG. In GS-US-183-0126 the blood-to-plasma 
ratio of total 14C-radioactivity was time-independent and ~ 0.73, indicating that EVG and its metabolites 
are predominantly distributed to plasma relative to the cellular components of the blood.   
COBI 
In equilibrium dialysis studies COBI was ~97% to 98% bound to human plasma proteins regardless of 
concentration. When [14C] COBI (150 mg COBI dose) was administered on the last day of a multiple-dose 
period (150 mg once daily for 6 days) in healthy subjects (GS-US-216-0111) the blood-to-plasma ratio of 
total 14C-radioactivity was time-independent and ~ 0.5, indicating that COBI is excluded from the cellular 
components of the blood.

Elimination 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
EVG 
Likely due to solubility-limited dissolution, doubling the dose from 125 mg F2 to 250 mg resulted in a ~ 
40% increase in mean EVG trough concentrations. Administration of EVG/r 300/100 mg in HIV-1 infected 
subjects gave ~ 17% increase in EVG trough concentrations vs. 150/100 mg. 
COBI 
COBI  exhibits  non-linear  increases  in  systemic  exposure  following  single-dose  (164-fold  higher  AUCinf 
over an 8-fold dose range) and multiple-dose administration (47-fold higher AUCtau over a 6-fold dose 
range). Also, COBI exhibits dose and time dependent changes in CL/F. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The CV% values were comparable between the Stribild F1 and F2 formulations and were mostly in the 
range 20-30% for AUC and Cmax. In GS-US-236-0105 using the F1 formulation the CV% values for AUC 
and Cmax EVG were generally smaller after administration in the fed vs. fasting state and smallest on 
dosing with the high fat and high calorie meal. This trend in CV% was not observed or was small and 
inconsistent for COBI, FTC and TFV. The mean %CV values after multiple-dose administration of Stribild 
are shown below for HIV-1 infected subjects and healthy subjects.

Note the derivation of parameters for HIV-infected subjects and the additional data for COBI as described 
in footnotes. The applicant concluded that inter-subject variability (% CV) for EVG AUC, Cmax and Ctau, 
and  for  the  AUC  and  Cmax  for  the  other  three  active  substances  (COBI,  FTC  and  TFV)  following 
administration of Stribild or COBI was comparable between HIV-1 infected subjects and healthy subjects. 
The  variability  in  FTC  and  TFV  exposures  following  administration  of  TVD  (fed)  or  ATR  (fasted)  were 
comparable to those observed following Stribild administration and to those reported for FTC and TDF. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Intensive  sampling  data  were  obtained  with  Stribild  in  Phase  2  (GS-US-236-0104)  and  Phase  3 
(GS-US-236-0102, GS-US-236-0103) studies and sparse sampling data were obtained in Phase 3 studies. 
In the population PK analysis the COBI-boosted EVG exposure parameters were analysed across studies 
and  compared  between  healthy  subjects  and  HIV-infected  subjects  treated  in  Phase  2  and  3  studies. 
Based on actual data the applicant considered that EVG exposures were comparable across studies in 
HIV-infected subjects who received Stribild. 
Table 13.   
A two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption rate constant and absorption lag time provided 
a good description of EVG PK in healthy subjects and HIV infected patients. The EVG AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau 
were comparable between HIV-1 infected subjects and healthy subjects.

Table 14.   
In HIV-1 infected subjects treated with Stribild COBI exposures were comparable across studies. 
Table 15.   
In addition, targeted plasma trough concentrations of COBI were assessed throughout 48 weeks of dosing 
in GS-US-236-0104 and GS-US-236-0103. In the Phase 3 study the means were mostly in the range 
40-70% but the CV% estimates around these trough values were very large. The cross-study comparison 
between  HIV-1  infected  subjects  (Phase  2  and  3  studies)  and  healthy  subjects  (GS-US-236-0110) 
following multiple-dose administration of Stribild showed that COBI AUCtau and Cmax were ~ 25% lower 
while Tmax and T1/2 were comparable in HIV-1 infected subjects compared with healthy subjects. The 
applicant stated that the reasons for the observed differences are unclear. 
In  the  population  PK  analyses  for  EVG,  COBI  exposure  was  not  associated  with  differences  in  EVG 
exposure at the 150 mg dose.  
Treatment with Stribild gave exposures to FTC and TFV in HIV-infected subjects that were considered to 
be comparable with those observed in healthy subjects in GS-US-236-0110. Mean TFV exposures upon 
multiple-dose administration of Stribild were higher (25%–30%) compared with historical data for TDF. 
This was attributed to the inhibitory effect of COBI on Pgp (MDR1)-mediated secretory (efflux) transport 
of TDF in the intestine (see further below). The relative increases in TFV exposure were in the range of 
values observed when TDF is co-administered with a PI/r, such as LPV/r, DRV/r and ATV/r with increases 
in TFV exposure of 32%, ~ 22% and ~37%, respectively.

Impaired renal function 
GS-US-216-0124 evaluated the PK of EVG and COBI in subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 
mL/min) not on dialysis vs. matched controls (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min). The actual mean eGFRCG values at 
baseline  were  23.5  mL/min  and  97.2  mL/min.  EVG  150  mg  and  COBI  150  mg  were  co-administered 
(using 150 mg tablets of each) once daily in the fed state for 7 days. 
EVG AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau were modestly lower (by 25%, 33% and 31%, respectively) in subjects with 
severe renal impairment vs. controls. However, it was also noted that EVG exposure on Day 7 among 
subjects  with  normal  renal  function  was  substantially  higher  than  in  previous  clinical  studies  with 
EVG/COBI  co-administered  at  these  doses.  The  applicant  considered  that  the  differences  were  not 
clinically relevant. The EVG mean (SD) % free fraction on Day 7 was 1.42 (0.17) in the renally impaired 
subjects and 1.16 (0.16) in the matched controls.  
COBI AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau were modestly higher (by 25%, 22% and 13%, respectively) in subjects with 
severe renal impairment but the applicant considered that the differences were not clinically relevant. The 
COBI mean (SD) % free fraction on Day 7 was 2.47 (0.62) in the renally impaired subjects and 2.49 
(0.29) in the matched controls. 
On Day 7 of co-administration eGFRCG was 10.5% lower vs. baseline among subjects with severe renal 
impairment  and  8.4%  lower  among  controls.  Similar  results  were  obtained  were  obtained  using 
eGFRMDRD.  Values  returned  to  baseline  levels  by  Day  14.  The  decreases  in  eGFR  were  attributed  to 
inhibition of proximal tubular secretion of creatinine by COBI (see also GS-US-126-0121 below).  
Impaired hepatic function 
GS-US-183-0133 evaluated the PK of EVG and COBI in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CPT 
B; actual scores were 7-9) and healthy controls. EVG 150 mg and COBI 150 mg were co-administered 
(using 150 mg tablets of each) once daily in the fed state for 10 days followed by an 11-day follow-up. 
Mean creatinine clearance was estimated at 98.7 ml/min and 116.8 ml/min in respective groups.  
The steady-state AUCtau, Ctau and Cmax of EVG were 35%, 80% and 41% higher, respectively, in subjects 
with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  but  the  applicant  considered  the  differences  were  not  clinically 
relevant. The mean (SD) % free fraction EVG was 1.15 (0.14) in the control group and 1.22 (0.23) in the 
CPT B group, indicating the lack of effect of hepatic impairment on EVG protein binding.  
The AUCtau and Cmax of COBI were generally comparable in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment 
relative to normal matched control subjects. Ctau was higher (GLSM 208%) in the presence of moderate 
hepatic impairment. The mean (SD) % free fraction COBI was 2.71 [0.56] in the control group and 3.23 
[0.63] in the CPT B group. 
Interactions 
In vitro data – including data added during the procedure 
EVG 
•  EVG showed no detectable inhibition of human hepatic microsomal CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 activity and only weak inhibition of CYP3A.  
• 
• 
The effect of EVG on the activities of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 showed no detectable inhibition of either 
enzyme (IC50 > 25 μM).  
The K m value for glucuronidation of EVG (to M4, GS 9200) by human hepatic microsomal fraction is 21 
μM. The Ki value for inhibition of UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 is expected to match this. Formal 
determination of EVG inhibition of UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 and the assessment of the potential for 
inhibition of UGT2B7 is ongoing.

• 
Formation of GS-9200 (M4) was extensively inhibited by ATV, a selective UGT1A1 inhibitor. 
•  At clinically relevant concentrations EVG is a weak inducer of CYP3A activity. This effect is countered 
by COBI and so it is unlikely to cause DDIs due to induction of other CYPs. 
•  EVG plasma exposures are maximally boosted by COBI. No further increases in EVG exposures are 
anticipated in the presence of other CYP3A inhibitors.  
•  EVG showed modest transport by Pgp with <3-fold increase in the efflux ratio in Pgp over-expressing 
cells vs. wild type cells. The EVG efflux ratio decreased in the presence of the Pgp inhibitor cyclosporin 
A (CsA; 10 μM). Co-administration with inhibitors or inducers of MDR1 is not expected to affect EVG 
plasma levels. 
•  EVG showed modest transport by BCRP with <3-fold increase in the efflux ratio in BCRP 
over-expressing cells vs. wild type cells. The EVG efflux ratio decreased in the presence of the BCRP 
inhibitor Ko134 (10 μM). 
•  EVG showed weak dose-dependent inhibition of Pgp (IC50 = 70 μM) and BCRP (IC50 = 89 μM). 
Inhibition constants for EVG and COBI suggest the potential for modest intestinal DDIs to occur 
during the absorption process when co-administered with Pgp and BCRP substrates and no potential 
for inhibition once in the systemic circulation. 
• 
The rate of EVG uptake in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transfected cells increased by 3.8 and 2.1 fold, 
respectively, vs. wild-type cells. Rates of uptake of EVG decreased in the presence of the OATP 
inhibitor rifampicin. 
•  EVG is a weak inhibitor of human OATP1B1 and an inhibitor of human OATP1B3 (IC50 0.44 μM).  
•  EVG did not influence MRP2-mediated oestradiol 17β-glucuronide transport at 20 μM. 
•  EVG showed weak inhibition of OCT2 (31% inhibition at 20 µM) and inhibited MATE1 with an IC50 of 
2.0 μM.  
•  EVG did not markedly inhibit OAT1, OAT3 or MRP4 at the highest concentrations tested (IC50 > 20 
μM). In light of the PK of EVG, inhibition of OAT1 and OAT3 would not be expected to be important but 
an effect on MRP4 could be relevant.  
•  EVG showed weak or no inhibition of OCT1 and BSEP.  
•  Chelating of EVG via binding to pharmacophore binding can occur with high concentrations of divalent 
and trivalent cations, as found in some antacid preparations. 
COBI 
•  COBI is expected to substantially increase exposure to drugs whose bioavailability and elimination are 
affected by CYP3A enzymes. COBI is a more specific CYP3A inhibitor than ritonavir. 
•  COBI is expected to weakly-modestly increase exposures of substrates of CYP2D6. 
•  CYP3A inducers are expected to lower COBI (and consequently EVG) exposure while strong inhibitors 
of CYP3A enzymes may increase COBI exposures. 
•  Neither recombinant human CYP2B6 nor CYP2C8 metabolised COBI to a significant extent 
•  COBI shows high intestinal permeability primarily via passive transcellular diffusion and does not 
undergo active efflux (secretory) transport. 
•  COBI was found to be a substrate for Pgp based on observations of increased efflux ratios in Pgp 
over-expressing cells and decreased efflux in the presence of CsA.  
•  Based on increased efflux ratio in BCRP over-expressing cells and decrease in efflux ratio in the 
presence of Ko134, COBI was found to be a substrate for BCRP.

•  COBI is a weak inhibitor of Pgp and BCRP (IC50 values of 36 μM and 59 μM).  Inhibition constants 
suggest the potential for modest intestinal DDIs to occur during the absorption process when 
co-administered with Pgp and BCRP substrates and no potential for inhibition once in the systemic 
circulation. High concentrations of COBI in the intestinal lumen during absorption can increase 
systemic TFV exposure due to inhibition of Pgp-dependent efflux of TDF. 
•  COBI is transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The rate of COBI uptake in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
transfected cells increased by 14.6 and 5.3 fold, respectively, vs. wild-type cells. Rates of uptake of 
COBI decreased in the presence of the OATP inhibitor rifampicin.  
•  COBI is expected to weakly-modestly increase exposures of OATP1B1/3 substrates.  
•  COBI was shown to not inhibit transport of model substrates by OAT1 and OAT3 at up to 100 μM and 
to weakly inhibit MRP4 (IC50 20.7 μM). 
•  COBI IC50 values for OCT2 and MATE1 were 14.4 and 1.87 µM, respectively. COBI is expected to 
weakly-modestly increase exposures of substrates of MATE1. For example, inhibition of cationic 
transporters by COBI may cause slight increases in circulating FTC levels by partially inhibiting the 
active tubular secretion component of its renal clearance. 
•  COBI inhibited OCT1 and BSEP with calculated IC50 values of 14.7 and 6.5 μM, respectively. RTV 
inhibited BSEP with IC50 of 1.8 μM and reached 49% of inhibition of OCT1 at 20 μM. COBI inhibition 
constants for OCT1 and BSEP were in excess of the total Cmax (1.4 μM; not taking into account protein 
binding) observed with STB. 
•  COBI exerted weak inhibition of MRP2 (IC50 >71 µm). 
Additional data come from the next 3 studies. 
The  active  tubular  secretion  of  TFV  is  mediated  by  a  low  affinity  and  high  capacity  anionic  transport 
pathway including OAT1, OAT3 and MRP4. The following studies provided relevant results: 
PC-236-2008 assessed the effect of COBI vs. RTV on the active transport of TFV by OAT1 (SLC22A6) and 
OAT3 (SLC22A8) expressed in basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubules. COBI up to 15 μM showed 
no inhibitory effect on the active transport of TFV mediated by two genetic variants of OAT1 while RTV 
showed weak inhibition (10% and 30% inhibition at 5 and 15 μM). The OAT3-mediated transport of TFV 
was more sensitive to inhibition by COBI and RTV with IC50 values of 6.6 and 4.8 μM, respectively. These 
inhibitory effects occurred only at concentrations exceeding human Cmax so COBI has a low potential to 
affect the active renal tubular uptake of tenofovir or other OAT1 and OAT3 substrates in vivo. 
PC-236-2009 assessed the potential for COBI to affect the MRP4-mediated cellular efflux of TFV vs. RTV. 
In the absence of serum, COBI and RTV inhibited TFV efflux by MRP4 with IC50 values of 8 and 12 μM, 
respectively, while adding 10% bovine serum significantly reduced the effects  (45% and 19% inhibition 
at 20 μM, respectively). No effects on MRP4 were observed in 100% human serum at concentrations far 
exceeding Cmax so COBI and RTV were considered weak inhibitors of MRP4. 
PC-236-2007 assessed the effect of COBI vs. RTV on the accumulation of TFV in fresh human renal cortex 
tissue. Tissue slices were incubated with 1.2 μM TFV and increasing concentrations of COBI and RTV (1.5, 
5 and 15 μM). At 15 μM COBI (substantially above Cmax) the TFV uptake was reduced by approximately 
20% following incubation for 60 minutes. RTV 5 and 15 μM concentrations reduced the TFV accumulation 
by 38% and 43%, respectively, but showed minimal effects at the clinically relevant concentration of 1.5 
μM. 
FTC and TFV (note TFV and not TDF) 
• 
TFV and FTC were not found to be substrates for Pgp (< 2-fold increase in efflux ratios in Pgp 
over-expressing cells and no effect of CsA). 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
TFV and FTC were not substrates for BCRP (< 2-fold increase in efflux ratio and no observed decrease 
in efflux in the presence of Ko134). 
FTC and TFV showed no dose-dependent inhibition of Pgp and BCRP. 
FTC did not influence MRP2-mediated oestradiol 17β-glucuronide transport at 100 μM. TFV did not 
inhibit MRP2 and the effect of TDF is under evaluation. 
FTC and TFV showed ≤ 20% inhibition of OCT2 and MATE1 at the highest tested concentrations (100 
and 300 µM, respectively). 
FTC did not show marked dose dependent inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 up to 100 μM. TFV 
showed weak dose dependent inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (37% and 32%, respectively, at 
100 μM).  
•  Combined results suggest the potential for Stribild to modestly increase co-administered OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3 substrates due to net inhibition of these transporters (see also the EVG and COBI 
results above). 
• 
FTC and TFV showed weak or no inhibition of OCT1 and BSEP.  
In vivo 
The applicant performed a large number of DDI studies with each of EVG and COBI, a limited number with 
EVG/COBI  and  one  with  Stribild.  Many  of  these  studies  involved  co-administration  of  EVG  with,  or 
evaluated  the  effects  of  COBI  on,  other  HIV  agents  so  the  findings  are  not  directly  relevant  to  this 
application for Stribild since it will not be given with additional ARVs. However, some of the findings have 
implications for other agents handled by similar mechanisms that could require co-administration with 
Stribild and the main results are provided in the clinical assessment report.  
Data from other DDI studies that are of interest were as follows: 
EVG 
•  GS-US-183-0119 evaluated the effects of administering EVG/rtv 50/100 mg after food but also 2 or 
4 h before or after Mg/Al-containing antacid and at 2 h after 40 mg omeprazole under steady state 
conditions. Dosing EVG/rtv with a 4 h interval before/after antacid and at 2 h after a dose of 
omeprazole there was no significant affect on EVG exposures. Use of a 2 h interval with respect to 
antacid gave 90% CI around ratios that did not span zero in any case but the applicant concluded that 
a 2 h interval would be satisfactory. Co-administration of omeprazole with EVG/r did not affect the PK 
of EVG. RTV PK was not affected by antacid or omeprazole.

Table 17.   
•  GS-US-183-0125 evaluated co-administration of EVG/rtv 300/100 mg once daily with rifabutin 150 
mg every other day, using a rifabutin 300 mg every other day control group.

EVG/r and 150 mg rifabutin resulted in equivalent exposures vs. EVG/rtv alone and 300 mg rifabutin alone 
but 25-O-desacetyl rifabutin AUC0−48, Cmax and Ctau increased by 9.5-, 5.4- and 19.4-fold, respectively, 
on  co-administration.  The  total  antimycobacterial  activity  (calculated  from  total  µM  rifabutin  plus 
25-O-desacetyl rifabutin) was increased by 50% during co-administration. RTV AUCtau was not affected by 
rifabutin but Cmax and Ctau were increased by ~ 21% and ~ 13%, respectively. 
•  GS-US-183-0146 assessed co-administration of EVG/rtv 150/100 mg once daily with ketoconazole 
(KTZ) 200 mg twice daily. Midazolam 5 mg orally was also administered pre-dosing, with EVG/rtv 
alone and at the end of co-administration. KTZ resulted in increases in EVG concentrations as shown 
below. There was also a decrease in the M4:EVG AUCtau ratio on concurrent administration with KTZ. 
The applicant considered the effects reflected inhibition of UGT1A1 by KTZ. 
Table 19.   
Co-administration  of  MDZ  and  EVG/r  resulted  in  increased  MDZ  AUCinf,  Cmax  and  Clast  with  slight 
additional increases in AUCinf and Clast when KTZ was added. Co-administration with EVG/r resulted in 
significant decreases in 1′-OH MDZ exposure but there were increases on addition of KTZ. 
COBI 
GS-US-216-0134 was reported during the procedure, at which time it was ongoing. This is a randomized, 
open-label, single-centre, multiple-dose, crossover study to evaluate the PK and safety of COBI (150 mg; 
A)  and  TFV  (300  mg  TDF;  C)  following  multiple-dose  administrations  of  each  agent  given  alone  or 
together (B) once daily for 7 days in healthy adult subjects. All dosing was after a standard meal. An 
interim report presented preliminary results after all subjects completed 2 dosing regimens over 19 days 
and 7 days of follow up. Two-thirds of the 46 treated subjects were male and 45 completed study drug. 
COBI exposures were unaffected by co-administration of TDF and the mean plasma profiles were almost 
super-imposable.

Consistent with the known inhibitory effect of COBI on Pgp-mediated intestinal efflux of TDF, the TFV Cmax 
and secondarily the AUC were higher (51% for Cmax and 23% for AUCtau) upon single- or multiple-dose 
administration of COBI+TDF vs. TDF alone.  
This finding was consistent with previous data with Stribild where TFV Cmax and AUCtau were 50% and 26% 
higher vs. TDF alone (GS-US-236-0110). However, the TFV exposures on co-administration with COBI 
were in the range of historical data for TDF when dosed with other Pgp-inhibitors, including RPV, RTV or 
PI/r (ATV, DRV and LPV).

Table 22.  GS-US-216-0134: Statistical Comparison of Single- and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetic 
Parameters for Test Versus Reference Treatments (Tenofovir PK Analysis Set). 
Following multiple-dose administrations the renal clearance of TFV was slightly lower with COBI+TDF vs. 
TDF  alone.  This  was  driven  by  similar  urinary  recoveries  of  TFV  in  the  urine  but  higher  AUC  values. 
Assessment  of  urinary  recovery  with  multiple  doses  of  study  drug  is  confounded,  as  the  absolute 
absorption and elimination of a dose of study drug is not assessed. 
Table 23.  GS-US-216-0134: Summary Statistics for Urinary Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Tenofovir 
PK analysis set). 
The TFV plasma concentration-time terminal phase profiles were parallel between the two treatments and 
accordingly, TFV T1/2 estimates were similar between treatments for both the single- and multiple-dose 
comparisons of COBI+TDF vs. TDF alone. The applicant concluded that the interaction between COBI and 
TDF is at the intestinal level and that COBI does not affect the elimination of TFV. In the DDI study of COBI 
and  the  Pgp  substrate  digoxin  the  Cmax  of  digoxin  was  increased  ~40%,  which  is  comparable  to  the 
change observed in TFV Cmax described above. In addition, in-vitro transport studies have confirmed that 
TDF is a substrate of intestinal Pgp and undergoes secretory transport and COBI is a Pgp inhibitor at 
concentrations observed in the intestine during absorption. Moreover, in-vitro data demonstrate minimal 
to no effect of COBI on renal transporters involved in TFV excretion in the urine. 
Grade 1 serum creatinine abnormalities occurred in 2 subjects during co-administration and in one during 
COBI. Grade 1 urine protein abnormalities occurred in 1 subject during the COBI treatment phase and 1 
subject  during  the  TDF  treatment  phase.  No  graded  abnormalities  in  phosphorus  or  urine  glucose 
occurred. The median baseline value for serum creatinine was 0.9 mg/dL during COBI+TDF, COBI, and 
TDF treatment phases, and slight increases (0.1 mg/dL) were seen as early as Day 2 of COBI+TDF and 
COBI  alone.  The  median  baseline  eGFRCG  values  were  between  110  and  120  mL/min.  Decreases  in 
eGFRCG were seen as early as Day 2 of COBI+TDF (median change at post-dose Day 2 of -10.5 mL/min) 
and COBI (median change at post-dose Day 2 of -9.0 mL/min) with improvements observed after dosing 
was discontinued. In the TDF treatment phase smaller decreases occurred. 
Related to this study, the applicant explored the possible reasons for the increased plasma levels of TFV 
when give with COBI as follows: 
TDF (but not TFV) is a substrate for Pgp. Inhibition of intestinal Pgp results in modest changes in TFV 
exposure when given with inhibitors or inducers of Pgp, including RTV, COBI and RPV. The basis for drug

interactions between RTV-boosted HIV-1 PIs and TDF has been ascribed to inhibition of Pgp-mediated 
intestinal efflux of TDF. The data are consistent with the interaction between COBI and TDF having the 
same basis. The magnitude of increase in TFV exposure when administered with COBI is comparable to 
that observed with other Pgp inhibitors, such as RTV and RPV. Additionally, there was no change in TFV 
plasma half-life when it was given as a component of the Stribild vs. TDF alone, which is consistent with 
an effect on bioavailability and not on systemic clearance. 
Tenofovir DF is not considered to be transported by MRP2 or BCRP so it is not affected by inhibition of 
these transporters or by any pharmacogenomics-driven effects on their functionality. The COBI IC50 for 
inhibition of MRP2 is 71 µM. COBI is not considered to inhibit renal MRP2 since the ratio for Cmax/IC50 is 
0.02 (i.e. 1.5 µM / 71 µM), which is well below the 0.1 threshold for interaction potential. However, COBI 
could inhibit intestinal MRP2 at concentrations theoretically achievable in the intestinal lumen following a 
150 mg oral dose.  
The participation of transporters in the renal excretion of TFV has been well-characterized in vitro and 
involves uptake by OAT1 and OAT3 and efflux by MRP4. COBI showed no inhibition of OAT1 and OAT3 
(IC50  values  exceeded  100  µM).  Based  on  a  COBI  IC50  for  MRP4  transport  of  20.7 µM  and  plasma 
unbound Cmax of 90 nM this level of inhibition is not considered to be pharmacologically relevant. EVG did 
not markedly inhibit OAT1, OAT3 or MRP4 at the highest concentrations tested (IC50 > 20 μM).   
GS-US-216-0112 was designed to evaluate the effects of COBI on CYP2D6 and 2B6 and on Pgp. Subjects 
were enrolled into one of 3 cohorts to receive the following oral treatments in the fed state: 
Cohort 1 (CYP2D6) 
A: Desipramine 50 mg as a single dose in the morning 
B: COBI 150 mg once daily for 10 days + desipramine 50 mg on the 10th day 
Cohort 2 (Pgp)   
C: Digoxin 0.5 mg as a single dose in the morning 
D: COBI 150 mg once daily for 10 days + digoxin 0.5 mg on the 10th day 
Cohort 3 (CYP2B6) 
E: EFV 600 mg as a single dose in the morning 
F: COBI 150 mg once daily for 10 days + EFV 600 mg on the 10th day 
Co-administration  of  desipramine  with  COBI  resulted  in  increases  in  desipramine  Cmax,  AUCinf  and 
AUC0−last. Digoxin Cmax and AUC0−last increased but AUCinf remained unchanged with co-administration. 
EFV Cmax decreased but AUC0−last/inf remained unchanged with co-administration.

Table 24.   
Co-administration of COBI and desipramine resulted in CYP2D6 inhibition (58% and 65% increases in 
AUC0−last and AUCinf, respectively, and 24% increase in Cmax). A small reduction in the Cmax of EFV was 
observed upon co-administration with COBI. In addition, the applicant considered that co-administration 
with digoxin may have resulted in transient inhibition of gut Pgp as evidenced by an increase in digoxin 
Cmax. These changes were not considered to require dose modifications or to necessitate additional DDI 
studies with substrates of CYP2D6, CYP2B6 or Pgp. 
In GS-US-216-0101 MDZ 5 mg (oral syrup) was administered orally on Days 0 and 14.

Table 25.   
COBI  200  mg  and  RTV  100  mg  exhibited  similar  inhibition  of  MDZ  CL/F  (−94.8%  and  –95.6%, 
respectively) and gave 19.2- and 22.5-fold increases in MDZ AUC (vs. MDZ alone). The lower COBI dose 
(100 mg) achieved slightly less inhibition of MDZ CL/F (−92.7% vs. MDZ alone). 
EVG + COBI 
GS-US-216-0120 evaluated co-administration of EVG/COBI 150/150 mg with omeprazole or famotidine 
over 8 days using different timings of administrations. Omeprazole and famotidine did not affect PK EVG 
or COBI when dosing was separated by 12 h. When omeprazole was given 2 h before EVG/COBI there was 
no appreciable effect on PK COBI. Plasma levels of EVG increased slightly with 90% CI for Cmax and Ctau 
that exceeded the upper limit but the AUC ratio was 110 [102, 119]. GS-US-216-0122 then evaluated 
EVG/COBI  150/150  mg  co-administered  with  famotidine  40  mg  once  daily  and  showed  no  significant 
effects on PK EVG or COBI.  
GS-US-216-0123 evaluated once daily dosing of EVG/COBI as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
EVG/COBI 150/150 mg with/without a single dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg. Rosuvastatin did not 
affect PK EVG. 
EVG/COBI 85/150 with/without ATV 300 mg vs. ATV/rtv 300/100 mg. Co-administration with ATV 
did not affect the EVG AUCtau while Cmax was modestly lower (~ 15%) and Ctau was higher than 
observed with EVG/COBI 150/150 mg alone (see also GS-US-183-0106) 
EVG/COBI 150/150 mg with/without rifabutin 150 mg every other day vs. rifabutin 300 mg once 
daily  taken  alone.  On  co-administration  the  EVG  Cmax  was  unchanged  but  the  AUCtau  was 
modestly (~ 20%) lower and Ctau markedly (~ 63%) lower vs. EVG/COBI given alone.  
•  COBI exposures were generally comparable across treatments, but substantially lower at 18 and 
24 h following co-administration with rifabutin with a lower t1/2. 
• 
The  RTV  AUCtau  and  Cmax  values  (10,947  ng•h/mL  and  2191  ng/mL,  respectively)  were 
comparable to values observed with ATV/r dosing in GS-US-183-0106 and GS-US-183-0108. 
•  Rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC were greater (89% and 38%, respectively) following EVG/co plus ROS 
administration, but the overall concentration-time profile (and t1/2) was similar relative to ROS 
dosing alone. The applicant considered that this interaction did not require dose adjustment.

• 
The ATV AUCtau was lower (10-12%) when given with EVG/COBI vs. ATV/rtv. Cmax was ~ 21-24% 
lower and Ctau was ~ 20-35% lower, although Ctau was well above the DHHS recommended target 
(140 ng/mL) in all subjects. 
The AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau rifabutin were comparable between the EVG/COBI + rifabutin 150 mg dose 
and 300 mg given alone. The median T½ was 11.7 h when rifabutin was given alone but was 28.6 h 
following concomitant administration.   
Co-administration  with  EVG/COBI  resulted  in  large  increases  in  AUCtau,  Cmax  and  Ctau  of 
25-O-desacetylrifabutin  vs.  rifabutin  alone.  [The  AUCtau  of  25-O-desacetylrifabutin  after 
administration alone was doubled for the comparison because of the different dosing frequencies]. 
The applicant estimated that antimycobacterial activity was  unaffected by co-administration (ratio 
120.9 [107, 136]).

GS-US-216-0125 was provided during the procedure. It evaluated the drug interaction potential between 
once-daily  EVG/co  and  methadone  or  buprenorphine/naloxone  (BUP/NLX).  Eligible  subjects  were 
assigned to a cohort based on their chronic regimen for opioid use (i.e. Cohort 1–methadone; Cohort 2- 
BUP/NLX) and received their dose with and without EVG 150 mg + COBI 150 mg once daily in the morning 
with a light meal.

R-methadone plasma concentrations were slightly higher following co-administration with EVG/co while 
S-methadone  plasma  concentrations  were  more  closely  comparable  across  treatments.  However,  the 
90% CI around the GLSMs for R- and S-forms fell within 80, 125% for both AUC and Cmax. 
Table 27.  GS-US-216-0125: Statistical Comparison of Methadone Pharmacokinetic Parameters for 
Test Versus Reference Treatments (Analysis Set: Methadone PK). 
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by COBI would not be expected to significantly influence methadone exposures and 
the  comparable  exposures  of  both  methadone  enantiomers  observed  in  the  presence  or  absence  of 
EVG/co confirm there is no inductive effect on CYP2B6 and/or CYP2C19. The totality of the data indicates 
the lack of effect on methadone PK and/or PD by EVG/co. 
The primary comparison for BUP was co-administration vs. dosing alone, with each subject serving as 
their own control. BUP exposures were higher following co-administration with EVG/co. BUP T1/2 could 
not be reliably estimated due to limited sampling duration relative to the T1/2 of 24-42 h).  
Plasma concentrations of norBUP were also higher following co-administration with EVG/co while Tmax 
values  were  comparable.  The  norBUP  T1/2  could  not  be  reliably  estimated  due  to  limited  sampling 
duration relative to the T1/2 of norBUP (~44 hours).

Table 29.  GS-US-216-0125: Statistical Comparison of norBUP Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Test 
Versus Reference Treatments (Analysis Set: norBUP PK). 
NLX plasma concentrations were slightly higher when given as BUP/NLX alone vs. co-administration with 
EVG/co. Consistent with the short T1/2, plasma concentrations of NLX in both treatments were BLQ at 24 
hours post-dose. 
Table 30.  GS-US-216-0125: Statistical Comparison of NLX Parameters for Test Versus Reference 
Treatments (Analysis Set: NLX PK). 
Inhibition of CYP3A4 by COBI gave a modest increase in the BUP and norBUP (~2% as potent as parent 
compound), which is in line with the change expected when CYP3A does not have a predominant role in 
drug elimination. The BUP and norBUP exposures observed following BUP/NLX administration alone were 
in the range of historical data.  
The  reasons  for  the  decrease  in  NLX  exposures,  which  show  intersubject  variability,  are  unclear.  The 
range of NLX exposures across both treatments were comparable with those reported on dosing with 
BUP/NLX alone or in combination with ARVs. The totality of the data indicates there is no clinically relevant 
influence  of  EVG/co  administration  on  the  PK  or  PD  of  BUP/NLX.  This  is  consistent  with  previous 
ARV-opioid  DDI  studies  where  a  modest  change  in  drug  levels  is  not  accompanied  by  a  measurable 
change in pharmacodynamic endpoint (BUP/NLX + RTV resulted in a 57% and 33% increase AUC for BUP 
and norBUP, respectively, versus BUP/NLX alone, with no change in PD).  
EVG plasma concentrations were comparable on co-administration with each opioid and were in the range 
of  historical  data  with  EVG/co  or  Stribild  (mean  [%CV]  EVG  AUCtau:  18,695.8  [35.1]  ng*h/mL 
GS-US-216-0123; and 22,485.9 [26.7] ng*h/mL GS-US-236-0110). 
COBI PK parameters were also comparable between treatments and in the range of historical data with 
EVG/co or Stribild (mean [%CV] COBI AUCtau: 10,389.4 [38.6] ng*h/mL GS-US-216-0123; and 11,288.2 
[28.5] ng*h/mL GS-US-236-0110). 
Opioid PD was assessed using the standardized tests SOWS, OOWS, COWS, and OOAS daily prior to the 
morning dosing. The resulting scores observed were minimal in all treatments relative to the overall test 
score range. The clinical significance and relevance of the change from baseline in PD scores and the 
resulting conclusions on PD-related changes was primarily based on investigator assessments of patients 
and associated clinical judgement, including the individual signs and symptoms that contributed to the 
total  score.  Accordingly,  the  values  present  a  descriptive  summary  of  the  PD  scores,  which  indicate 
Assessment report

minimal to no change in these values upon co-administration of opioids with EVG/co vs. opioid dosing 
alone. In each Cohort these data indicate no meaningful changes in the opioid pharmacodynamics and a 
lack of relevant withdrawal and overdose symptoms. No subjects experienced withdrawal or overdose 
symptoms. 
Stribild 
GS-US-236-0106 was conducted with Stribild and an oral contraceptive containing norgestimate and 
ethinyl oestradiol (0.025 mg). Co-administration was for 9 days in subjects at least in the second dosing 
cycle and resulted in creases in norelgestromin AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau but decreases in ethinyl oestradiol 
AUCtau and Ctau. EVG and COBI levels were in the expected range. 
Serum  progesterone  remained  unchanged  while  FSH  decreased  to  a  similar  extent  and  LH  showed  a 
larger decrease on co-administration. The applicant concluded that doses of < 0.25 mg ethinyl oestradiol 
should not be used in conjunction with Stribild. 
GS-US-236-0120 was provided during the procedure. This was an open-label study to evaluate the PK of 
COBI-boosted EVG administered as Stribild before and after treatment with Atripla (ATR) in 32 healthy 
subjects. A subpopulation of 8 healthy subjects had a genetic polymorphism in CYP2B6 associated with 
decreased CYP2B6 metabolic activity and reduced efavirenz (EFV) clearance. Eligible subjects received 
the following: 
-  Period 1: Stribild once daily (Days 1-7) within 5 minutes of completion of a standard meal 
-  Period 2: ATR once daily (Days 15-28) in the fasting state 
-  Period 3: Stribild once daily (Days 29-62) within 5 minutes of completion of a standard meal 
There was a 7-day washout between Periods 1 and 2 but not between Periods 2 and 3. 
EVG and COBI reference exposures (Day 7) were similar to those reported from previous studies with 
Stribild (GS-US-236-0101 and GS-US-236-0110).  
Following administration of Stribild after switching from treatment with ATR, EVG exposures for 29 PK 
evaluable subjects were lower with 90% CI around GLSMs that fell outside of 70% to 143% at 1 (D35) 
and 2 weeks (D42) post-switch vs. Day 7 pre-switch.

The data from the CYP2B6 poor metabolizers were used to evaluate the effect on EVG and COBI of the 
higher  levels  of  EFV  that  occurred  at  the  time  of  switching  from  ATR  to  Stribild.  These  CYP2B6  poor 
metabolizers displayed lower EVG exposures (AUCtau) at Day 7 but the difference was even greater at 1 
and 2 weeks post-switch (39% and 29% lower, respectively) compared with non-poor metabolizers.

All  subjects  (including  the  CYP2B6  poor  metabolizers)  had  EVG  trough  concentrations  above  the 
protein-binding adjusted IC95 (44.5 ng/mL) at 2 weeks post-switch. Percentages of all 29 subjects below 
the IC95 at 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 days post-switch were 48%, 31%, 17%, 10% and 10%, respectively. In the 
subset  of  CYP2B6  poor  metabolizers  the  percentages  below  the  IC95  at  3,  5,  7,  10  and  12  days 
post-switch were 100%, 86%, 57%, 43% and 43%, respectively.  
The mean EVG trough concentration for all 29 subjects was ~3-fold and ~5-fold greater than the IC95 at 
1 week and 2 weeks post-switch, respectively, and 7 to 8-fold above the IC95 at 5 weeks post-switch.  
Exposures (AUCtau) of GS-9200, the glucuronidated metabolite of EVG, were higher (46.64% and 37.03% 
on Days 35 and 42, respectively, vs. Day 7) post-switch. Concentrations of the primary hydroxylated 
metabolite GS-9202 were BLLQ.  
The GLSM ratio of COBI exposure parameters (AUCtau and Cmax) and 90% CIs were within 70% to 143% 
by  1  week  post-switch  vs.  reference  levels  on  Day  7.  The  COBI  Ctau  was  35%  lower  at  2  weeks

The  applicant’s  conclusions  from  this  study  (note  they  are  based  on  the  applicant’s  pre-defined 
acceptance criteria of 90% CI within 70-143%) were as follows: 
-  At 1 and 2 weeks after switching from ATR to Stribild the mean EVG exposures for all subjects were 
lower, which is likely due to induction of CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 by EFV. 
-  CYP2B6 poor metabolizers displayed lower EVG AUCtau at 1 and 2 weeks post-switch (39% and 29% 
lower, respectively), compared with nonpoor metabolizers.  
-  All subjects had EVG trough concentrations > protein-binding adjusted IC95 (44.5 ng/mL) at 2 weeks 
post-switch.  Percentages  below  the  IC95  at  3  and  12  days  post-switch  were  48%  and  10%, 
respectively. Mean EVG trough concentration increased from ~3-fold and ~5-fold greater than the 
IC95  at  1  week  and  2  weeks  post-switch,  respectively,  to  7  to  8-fold  above  the  IC95  at  5  weeks 
post-switch.  
-  The  AUCtau  of  GS-9200  was  higher  (46.64%  and  37.03%  on  Days  35  and  42,  respectively) 
post-switch. 
-  CYP2B6  poor  metabolizers  displayed  higher  EFV  AUCtau  and  Cmax  as  compared  with  nonpoor 
metabolizers (125% and  91% higher, respectively). The EFV trough concentration was above the 
MEC (1000 ng/mL) for 3 days post-switch and above the protein-binding adjusted IC90 (10 ng/mL) 
through 3 weeks post-switch.  
-  Post-switch COBI exposures were comparable except that Ctau was lower (GMR on Day 42: 65.02 
[57.52, 73.50]). 
- 
FTC and TFV were comparable when Stribild was given before and after ATR. 
Overall,  the  study  subject  population,  including  a  limited  numbers  of  CYP2B6  poor  metabolizers, 
displayed  exposures  of  EFV  and/or  EVG  in  a  range  associated  with  antiviral  activity  through  5  weeks 
post-switch from ATR to Stribild.

Comment on pharmacokinetics 
The applicant conducted a comprehensive investigation of the PK of the two new active substances (EVG 
and COBI) contained in Stribild when administered alone, together and as part of the Stribild film-coated 
tablet. The PK data obtained with the F1 and F2 Stribild tablets were relatively limited but are critically 
important.  There  are  data  from  HIV-infected  subjects  enrolled  into  Phase  2  and  3  studies  and 
comparisons with data obtained in healthy subjects.  
EVG showed auto-induction of metabolism when administered without RTV or COBI. With 100 mg RTV or 
with 150 mg COBI there appeared to be maximal inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. The large 
increase in exposure to EVG on co-administration with RTV was attributed to improved oral bioavailability 
due  to  decreased  first  pass  metabolism  and  to  reduced  systemic  clearance.  The  formation  of  the  M4 
glucuronide metabolite was not affected by RTV or COBI. On co-administration with RTV 100 mg the EVG 
125 mg tablet was bioequivalent to the 150 mg final formulation (F2) tablet. Stribild incorporates 150 mg 
F2 EVG.  
The EVG C24 was ~ 26% higher following multiple-dose administration of the F2 formulation (349 vs. 440 
ng/mL),  consistent  with  the  development  of  mechanism-based  inhibition  of  CYP3A  by  RTV  and 
consequent reduction in EVG systemic clearance as well as progression to steady-state conditions. 
The bioavailability of COBI increased with dose and with multiple vs. single dose administrations. The 
greater  than  dose-proportional  increases  in  AUC  were  consistent  with  its  metabolic  auto-inhibition 
properties. The large decreases in CL/F and increases in T1/2, AUC and Cmax with multiple doses were 
considered to reflect changes in COBI bioavailability, systemic clearance or both with time. The F1 and F2 
formulations were bioequivalent. Stribild incorporates 150 mg F2 COBI, reflecting the data obtained in 
GS-US-236-0101 in which Stribild containing COBI 150 mg gave a slightly higher EVG plasma exposure 
(AUC and trough) vs. COBI 100 mg.     
Based on the food effect study GS-US-236-0105, Stribild was administered with food in Phase 2/3 studies 
to achieve desired exposures of EVG that maintain high inhibitory quotient. The SmPC also recommends 
administration with food (unspecified). It is pertinent to note the different effects of a high fat/kcal meal 
compared to a light meal on EVG, COBI and TFV in GS-US-326-0105. The exact dosing conditions in the 
Phase 2/3 studies are not known. 
Data from healthy subjects and from HIV-infected subjects have demonstrated that plasma exposures to 
TFV and FTC when TDF and FTC are given with COBI are higher compared to FTC + TDF co-administration 
and to TDF given alone. The applicant demonstrated that the data were comparable with TFV exposure 
when TDF was co-administered with a PI/r in prior studies and attributed the higher TFV exposures to the 
effect  of  COBI  on  handling  of  TDF  by  Pgp  (MDR1)  in  the  gut.  Additional  transporter  studies  were 
performed to demonstrate that neither COBI nor EVG is likely to have an important effect on the three 
transporters that are involved in the renal elimination of TFV. 
COBI  administration  is  associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  estimated  CLcr  due  to  inhibition  of  tubular 
secretion of creatinine via its effect on MATE1.  
Stribild will not be used in severe renal impairment because the dose-interval adjustment that is required 
for FTC and TDF in patients with CLcr < 50 mL/min cannot be achieved with the FDC. Stribild has not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
Given the results of the DDI studies (e.g. EVG/rtv 200/100 mg plus ATV/rtv 300/100 mg) it is possible 
that EVG levels could be affected by UGT1A1/1A3 polymorphisms. A PK study of EVG in subjects with 
UGT1A1*28/*28  genotype  administered  STB  to  obtain  information  on  EVG  exposure  in  patients  with 
UGT1A1 polymorphism associated with decreased activity of UGT1A1 is included in the RMP and expected 
by Q2 2015. 
Based  on  the  DDI  profile  of  EVG  and  COBI  the  applicant  has  concluded  that  Stribild  must  not  be 
co-administered  with  drugs  with  narrow  therapeutic  ranges  that  are  highly  dependent  on  CYP3A  for 
clearance  and  for  which  elevated  plasma  concentrations  are  associated  with  severe  and/or 
life-threatening events. In addition, Stribild should not be given with potent CYP3A inducers, as these 
could decrease plasma levels of COBI, and hence reduce EVG plasma concentrations with the attendant 
risk of a clinically important negative effect on efficacy.

In GS-US0216-0112 the digoxin Cmax and AUC0−last increased but AUCinf remained unchanged when 0.5 
mg  was  given  on  day  10  of  COBI  150  mg  daily  compared  with  0.5  mg  digoxin  alone.  The  applicant 
considered that although COBI is regarded as a weak inhibitor of Pgp it is highly soluble so it may achieve 
transient inhibition of gut Pgp during its absorption and increase digoxin Cmax without having a marked 
effect  on  its  AUC.  If  this  finding  is  extrapolated  to  other  orally  administered  Pgp  substrates  then  the 
concern would be for co-administration with those agents for which the pharmacodynamic effect and/or 
the safety profile are in some way influenced by Cmax.  
The additional data provided from GS-US-236-0120 raise a real potential that prolonged sub-efficacious 
EVG levels could occur at least in CYP2B6 poor metabolizers if they are switched from ATR to Stribild, 
which may occur reasonably often in routine use. 
The  applicant’s  conclusion  regarding  the  most  likely  explanation  for  the  effect  of  Stribild  on  ethinyl 
oestradiol being mediated by CYP2C9 induction is plausible. It is expected that the effect of Stribild on 
CYP2C9 would be comparable to that of RTV when it is used to boost PIs.  
The SmPC carries several contraindications for use with other medicinal products along with warnings and 
an extensive Section 4.5 of the SmPC. There are also several additional studies of relevance to drug-drug 
interaction potential ongoing or planned/requested, which are reflected in the RMP.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
EVG specifically inhibits HIV-1 integrase strand-transfer activity and the integration of viral DNA into host 
cell chromosomal DNA in cell culture. 
COBI is a structural analogue of RTV but it is devoid of anti-HIV activity (HIV protease IC50 > 30 μM; vs. 
0.6 nM for ritonavir). The role of COBI in the Stribild is to enhance the PK profile of EVG by means of its 
ability to inhibit CYP3A4 and so prevent conversion of EVG to its major metabolite (M1). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
EVG 
•  EVG inhibited DNA strand-transfer with an IC50 value of 8.8 nM. It inhibited laboratory strains and 
various clinical isolates (wild-type and NRTI, NNRTI, and PI drug-resistant strains) of HIV-1 with an 
EC50 of 0.38 nM (range, 0.02 to 1.3 nM) in human PBMCs. Activity was shown against multiple 
subtypes (Group M: A, B, C, D, E, F, G and Group O) of HIV-1 and against HIV-2. 
• 
• 
• 
The EC95 value in the presence of HSA and AAG was 100 nM (44.8 ng/mL) in HIV-1 infected human 
PBMC cultures, representing an 80-fold loss in antiviral activity. 
In-vitro ARV combination studies showed additive to synergistic interactions with the NRTIs FTC and 
TFV (as well as others tested), with NNRTIs (EFV, nevirapine and etravirine) and with a range of PIs. 
In-vitro assays with T-20, RAL and maraviroc also demonstrated additive to synergistic interactions. 
The in-vitro ARV activity of EVG was not altered by the presence of COBI.  
•  Combination of EVG, TFV and FTC was synergistic.  
•  EVG selected for 3 primary resistance mutations in HIV-1 integrase - T66I/A/K, E92Q/G or Q148R – 
in vitro. These confer 15-, 36- and 109-fold reduced susceptibility, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 65/147 
 
  
  
•  Additional secondary IN mutations selected by EVG were H51Y, F121Y, S147G, S153Y, E157Q and 
R263K. These mutations further decreased susceptibility to EVG when they occurred in addition to 
T66I or E92Q mutations. 
•  Elvitegravir did not inhibit replication of HBV or HCV in vitro.  
• 
• 
There were no measurable changes in the content of mtDNA and therefore the potential for 
mitochondrial toxicity is considered low. 
In MT-2 cells the M4 (GS-9200) and M1 (GS-9202) metabolites showed HIV-1 antiviral activity that 
was 6.7- and 9.3-fold lower than EVG. Other experiments also showed that the M1 and M4 
metabolites are markedly less active (M1: 5- to 18-fold and M4: 10- to 38-fold in antiviral activity 
assays) than EVG. From these data and the low plasma levels observed on co-administration with 
COBI M1 and M4 are not considered to contribute to the antiviral activity of EVG. GS-9200 and 
GS-9202 selected EVG-associated resistance mutations and have similar resistance profiles as EVG.  
Stribild 
•  Anti-HIV activity of EVG + FTC + TFV and these with a 25 µM COBI overlay showed synergy. The 
anti-HIV-1 activity of EVG with FTC, TFV and FTC+TFV was found to be additive to synergistic in 
multiple in-vitro assay systems. In-vitro combination studies showed that EVG, FTC and TFV have 
additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity with NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs, enfuvirtide, maraviroc and RAL. 
In an integrated analysis of 1479 ARV-naive subjects receiving the Stribild in the three pivotal studies 
(GS-US-236-0104,  -0102 and  -0103)  resistance  analyses  were  performed  for  HIV-1  isolated  from  53 
subjects (27 in the Stribild group) who were virological failures or had > 400 copies/mL at Week 48 or 
when discontinued. There were 13/749 (1.7%) in the Stribild group with virus that had developed primary 
(INSTI-R) or NRTI resistance (NRTI-R) mutations and phenotypic resistance to one or more components 
of the Stribild. 
Important findings in the Stribild group were: 
• 
The most common mutations were T66I, E92Q, Q148R and N155H in the IN gene and RT M184V/I, 
with or without K65R, in the RT gene. Secondary IN mutations that developed in a single case in 
addition to a primary INSTI mutation were H51Y, L68V, G140C, S153A and E157Q.  
•  Within the Stribild group, viruses that developed genotypic resistance to EVG (n = 11) showed a 
mean of 67-fold reduced susceptibility vs. wild-type. All viruses that developed resistance to EVG also 
showed reduced susceptibility to RAL (mean 7.9-fold). 
• 
In addition, 27/749 subjects had viruses with the K103N substitution in RT at baseline but none 
developed resistance to a component of the Stribild. The presence of K103N at baseline did not 
predispose subjects to failure on the Stribild or ATV/r + TVD. 
•  Additional analyses found no impact of HIV-1 subtype on response or development of resistance.  
•  Subjects with viruses that developed mutations had a trend for higher baseline viral load and lower 
CD4 cell counts than the overall study population. 
•  A trend for lower replication capacity was found in viruses that developed resistance to a component 
of the Stribild compared to baseline. 
• 
In the ATR group, 18 viruses were analysed for resistance development (18 of 375 subjects, 4.8%). 
Eight subjects (8 of 375 subjects, 2.1%) in the ATR group developed RT resistance to one or more 
components of ATR and most commonly consisted of K103N with or without M184V/I and K65R.

Secondary pharmacology 
QTc and other cardiac studies 
GS-US-183-0128 evaluated the effect of steady-state ritonavir-boosted EVG plasma levels on QTc using 
a two-part parallel study design because of the numbers of days (10) needed to achieve steady state. All 
treatments  were  administered  orally  under  fed  conditions. In  Part  1  the  subjects  received  placebo  or 
moxifloxacin 400 mg as a single dose in the morning on Day 1. In Part 2 the subjects received EVG/rtv 
125/100 mg on Days 6−15 or EVG/rtv 250/ 100 mg on Days 6−15 or placebo on these days. 
Moxifloxacin showed the expected positive control effect with a difference in QTcF vs. placebo that was 
generally between 5 and 10 ms and with an upper limit of the 90% CI > 10 ms at multiple time points. For 
the  QTcF  change  from  baseline  in  Part  2  of  the  study  the  upper  limits  of  the  2-sided  90%  CI  for  the 
difference in LSMs (EVG/r vs. placebo) were all < 10 ms. Actual differences in LSMs were < 5 ms at all 
time points for both EVG/r groups. Consistent results were obtained from similar analyses conducted for 
QTcB, QTcI and QTcN. The categorical analyses were unremarkable. The linear correlations between QTcF, 
QTcB, QTcN and QTcI and plasma concentrations of EVG and GS-9200 were very weak. 
GS-US-216-0107 was a cross-over study that evaluated the effect of 250 mg and 400 mg COBI, each 
administered once in the fed state on QTc, vs. placebo and moxifloxacin 400 mg at weekly intervals. The 
plasma levels of COBI actually achieved exceeded the predicted values. Assay sensitivity was established 
based on the differences between controls. COBI did not show prolongation of the QTcF interval. The 
upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CIs were < 10 ms at all time points after dosing with similar findings 
applied to QTcN and QTcI and a single instance of QTcB at 10.1 ms at 12 hours at the supra-therapeutic 
dose. Categorical analyses of QT data were unremarkable. There was a modest increase in PR interval 
between 3 and 5 h post-dose. The largest baseline-adjusted treatment mean difference in PR interval 
between  the  therapeutic  or  supra-therapeutic  doses  and  placebo  was  +9.6  ms  and  +20.2  ms, 
respectively, both at 3.5 hours after dosing. In all but 5 subjects the absolute PR interval was ≤ 210 ms. 
As  part  of  the  COBI  bioequivalence  study  GS-US-216-0116  (see  2.1.3  for  details)  ECGs  and 
echocardiograms  were  obtained  from  Cohort  1  subjects  at  baseline  and  once  between  days  14-19  of 
dosing at 150 mg COBI daily at 3.5-6 h post-dose. All subjects had normal absolute PR (< 210 msec) and 
QTcF (< 450 msec) intervals. The ECHO assessments showed that the three measures of left ventricular 
function were normal. Nonparametric comparisons of the mean change from baseline showed an increase 
in  left  ventricular  end-systolic  volume  (3.72  mL,  p  =  0.017)  that  was  not  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant. 
Renal effect studies 
GS-US-126-0121  was  conducted  following  Phase  II  studies  with  COBI  in  which  decreases  in  eGFR 
calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault method (eGFRCG) occurred within the first few weeks of dosing.  The 
study evaluated the effect of COBI and RTV in normal function or mild/moderate renal impairment based 
on eGFRCG and MDRD, CLiohexol (actual GFR; aGFR) and measured GFR (mGFR) using 24-hour urinary 
output and serum creatinine concentration.  
In Cohort 1 parallel groups of healthy subjects were randomised (1:1:1) to receive one of the following for 
7 days once daily after a standardised meal: 
• COBI: COBI 150 mg + RTV 100 mg placebo (Treatment 1) 
• RTV: RTV 100 mg + COBI 150 mg placebo (Treatment 2) 
• Placebo: COBI 150 mg placebo + RTV 100 mg placebo (Treatment 3) 
In  Cohort  2  subjects  with  mild/moderate  renal  impairment  (eGFRCG  50−79  mL/min  at  screening) 
received COBI 150 mg dosed as above. On day 7 higher COBI exposures (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau) were 
observed in Cohort 2 subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 67/147 
 
  
  
Table 37.   
Serum creatinine-based GFR estimations were statistically significantly decreased (p < 0.05) on Day 7 of 
COBI administration in both cohorts but not at Day 14. There were no statistically significant changes in 
eGFR on Day 7 of RTV or placebo or on Day 14 in the placebo group but there was a statistically significant 
increase in eGFR on Day 14 in subjects who had received RTV. Similar results were obtained both for 
eGFRMDRD and mGFR. 
Table 38.   
In contrast, the aGFR was unchanged from baseline at Day 7 and 14 in the COBI, RTV or placebo groups. 
Consistent with these results, there were also no statistically significant changes from baseline at Day 7 
or Day 14 in cysGFR, calculated using clearance of the endogenous serum protein cystatin C.  
Whereas a statistically significant reversible decrease from baseline in eGFR was observed at Day 7 in 
Cohort 1 subjects who had received COBI compared with placebo the aGFR was unchanged.  
The  applicant  concluded  that  the  higher  plasma  exposures  in  subjects  with  mild/moderate  renal 
impairment suggested reduced COBI clearance, with or without a change in bioavailability. Changes in 
eGFR values determined using serum creatinine but without changes in aGFR determined using iohexol or 
cystatin C indicated that COBI inhibits proximal tubular secretion of creatinine and does not affect the true 
GFR. 
GS-US-236-0130 was requested, completed and reported during the procedure. This was a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, parallel design study in healthy adult subjects. The study

examines the effect of 5 treatments (COBI, TDF, COBI+TDF, Stribild and placebo when given once daily 
for 30 days in the fed state at the proposed or approved doses on renal function. Subjects were then 
followed for a further 30 days to document the reversibility of any effects observed. Demographics and 
baseline renal parameters were generally similar between groups.  
Table 39.  GS-US-236-0130: Renal Baseline Characteristics (Safety Analysis Set). 
Mean  plasma  concentrations  of  COBI  when  given  alone  were  similar  to  those  for  subjects  receiving 
COBI+TDF and slightly lower vs. dosing with Stribild. These observations were consistent with data from 
studies in which COBI was given alone or as a component of Stribild.

Mean  plasma  concentrations  of  TFV  in  the  COBI+TDF  and  Stribild  groups  on  Days  15  and  30  were 
modestly  higher  vs.  TDF  alone,  consistent  with  GS-US-216-0134  and  GS-US-236-0110.  No  relevant 
differences in the median Tmax or T½ of TFV were observed between these treatments.

EVG PK parameters were similar on Day 15 and Day 30 in the Stribild group and consistent with historical 
data  (GS-US-236-0110).  The  FTC  concentration-time  profile  following  administration  of  Stribild  was 
consistent with historical data (GS-US-236-0110). 
The GLSM ratios and associated 90% CIs for each comparison of aGFR for test treatments vs. placebo 
were within 80% to 125% on Days 15, 30, 40 and 60 but the 90% CI did not span 100% for any of the 
comparisons between STB and placebo.

In addition, the comparisons within each treatment group for change vs. the group baseline indicated that 
only in the STB group was there a clear effect of treatment on aGFR (next table). The data demonstrated 
the  differences  between  groups  for  the  D0  GLSM  values,  which  underlines  the  importance  of  this 
additional analysis for interpreting the data shown above. 
The table shows that the  baseline aGFR GLSM was  actually nearest to the placebo group for the STB 
subjects. In the STB group the comparisons of on-treatment and post-treatment values vs. baseline gave 
90% CI that all fell below 100% and this was observed at all time points. The only other group in which 
this occurred was COBI (at D15 and at D40). In contrast, for TDF alone there was no perceptible change 
from D0 during the study and for COBI + TDF the only notable change was at D15.

The comparisons between active groups showed that only for STB vs. either COBI or TDF alone did the 
90% CI not span 100% and this occurred only at D30. 
Note that this table did not compare STB with COBI + TDF; however, this comparison is further addressed

To further evaluate the findings the applicant also compared aGFR between STB relative to TDF+COBI . 
The GLSM ratios and 90% CIs were within 80% to 125% and on this basis the applicant concluded that 
EVG does not alter renal function.

versus COBI+TDF (PD Analysis Set).

125% at these time points for each of the four active treatments vs. placebo (see the first table below for 
change in renal plasma flow vs. placebo).  
In the second table below the change in renal plasma flow from D0 is shown within each group. These 
comparisons demonstrate that even in the placebo group there was some variability in the GLSM over 
time, which complicates interpretation of the data. Nevertheless, it was only in the COBI group at Day 40 
and in the COBI + TDF and STB groups at D30 and D40 that the 90% CI fell below 100%.

There  were  the  expected  increases  in  serum  creatinine  and  the  associated  decreases  in  eGFRCG  and

relevant changes were observed. Based on local laboratory data, Grade 1 hypophosphataemia occurred in 
3 subjects (1 subject in each of the TDF, Stribild and placebo groups) and Grade 2 hypophosphataemia 
occurred in 1 subject in the TDF group.  No graded proteinuria or glycosuria abnormalities occurred in any 
treatment group.

values fitted well to a simple Emax (maximum PD effect) model with an EC50 value at 14.4 ng/mL and an

Emax of 2.32 log10 copies/mL reduction from baseline. The estimated inhibitory quotient (IQ), calculated 
as the observed mean Ctau divided by the protein binding-adjusted in vitro IC50 of 7.17 ng/mL, was 5.9, 
6.7  and  18.8  at  400  mg  twice  daily,  800  mg  twice  daily  and  50  mg  +  RTV  once  daily,  respectively.

(45 ng/mL; 100 nM) for the entire dosing interval.

In  the  Stribild  Phase  3  studies  the  PK-PD  analyses  of  the  EVG  exposure-efficacy  relationship  were 
performed using EVG population PK modelling and rates for HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL level using Pure 
Virological Response (PVR) by Week 48. The PVR was chosen as the primary PD endpoint because it was 
considered to represent an assessment of virological response unaffected by non-virological factors (e.g. 
discontinuation for various reasons) that would define subjects as virological failures in some composite 
primary endpoints such as TLOVR or the snapshot analysis.

Virological response was uniformly high across the categories EVG Ctrough by all approaches with no trends 
in exposure-response relationship observed. The applicant considered that the results were consistent 
with  the  data-driven  dose  selection  of  EVG  150  mg  for  the  Stribild,  which  provided  exposures 
corresponding  to  Emax  and  mean  and  overall  Ctrough  values  that  exceeded  by  ~  10-fold  the  protein 
binding-adjusted IC95 (45 ng/mL). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The in-vitro activity of EVG has been adequately investigated.  
The EVG dose-escalation studies of selection of resistance-associated mutations were of different 
methodologies. However, they indicated that T66I could be selected by passage 7 whereas E92Q 
emerged at passage 30. Using the viral breakthrough method Viruses with IN resistance mutations were 
observed at EVG concentrations corresponding to 10-fold the EC50 (T66I/T) and 40- and 80-fold the 
EC50 (Q148R). Viruses with emergent IN resistance mutations were also observed for RAL at 
concentrations corresponding to 5-fold the EC50 (N155H) and 40-fold the EC50 (Q148K).  
There is incomplete cross-resistance between EVG and RAL. For example, viruses carrying only T66I 
remained susceptible to RAL whereas viruses carrying N155H and Q148K each showed resistance to RAL 
and EVG. However, 11 isolates from subjects who received the Stribild in clinical studies and developed 
genotypic resistance to EVG (n = 11) showed a mean of 67-fold reduced susceptibility vs. wild-type and 
all of these viruses showed reduced susceptibility to RAL (mean 7.9-fold). 
The results of the in-vitro studies and the data regarding isolates obtained during the clinical studies with 
Stribild suggested that the genetic barrier to resistance of EVG is relatively low, as is that of RAL. 
The potential for EVG to contribute to the overall antiviral effect of Stribild was supported by the EVG 
monotherapy study in which EVG/rtv 50/100 achieved comparable viral suppression over 10 days to that 
of 400 mg and 800 mg EVG BID (~2 log drop). Elvitegravir trough concentrations at these doses also 
exceeded the protein binding-adjusted in vitro IC95 (45 ng/mL; 100 nM) for the entire dosing interval. 
The Stribild data showed that 150 mg EVG (plus 150 mg COBI) provided uniform rates of PVF across the 
trough concentration quantiles, supporting the sufficiency of the EVG/COBI doses.  
The TQT studies with each of EVG/rtv (up to 250/100 mg) and COBI 250 mg delivered supra-therapeutic 
exposures compared to anticipated plasma levels achieved with Stribild and did not suggest clinically 
important effects on QTc. In addition, COBI did not appear to have an important effect on left ventricular 
function.

In the first study of the effect of COBI on renal function (GS-US-216-0121) plasma COBI levels were 
higher in those with mild to moderate renal impairment vs. controls and comparable to those observed in 
subjects with severe renal impairment in GS-US-216-0124. Taking into account the effects on eGFR but 
lack of effect on aGFR (and cysGFR) it appears that COBI inhibits the proximal tubular secretion of 
creatinine via inhibition of MATE1.   
GS-US-236-0130 showed that aGFR decreased with each active treatment vs. placebo and the difference 
persisted post-treatment. The data indicated consistently that the largest decreases occurred with Stribild 
and on Day 30 the comparisons for Stribild vs. each of TDF and COBI alone gave 90% CI that did not span 
100. At Day 30 the PAH CLrenal was lower with each active treatment vs. placebo and the 90% CI barely 
spanned 100%. The comparisons within treatments for change in renal plasma flow from baseline point 
to the most marked effect in the COBI + TDF and the STB groups.  
The reason for the apparent greater effect of STB than any of the other groups is not clear. Given the 
variability observed in aGFR and renal plasma flow it is not impossible that the observations could have 
arisen by chance in this parallel group study but the consistent effect within the STB group makes this 
unlikely. Also, there is no known reason why STB might have a greater effect on aGFR than TDF + COBI. 
The CHMP concluded that an effect cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, it is not possible to conclude 
whether the actual effects observed are potentially clinically relevant. Please see further discussion on 
clinical safety on this issue. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted are considered satisfactory.  
For detailed discussion regarding renal toxicity of Stribild compared to tenofovir + COBI and additional 
pharmacovigilance activities see section on clinical safety. 
In order to further characterise the PK profile of STB, the following measure will be performed by the 
applicant, as detailed in the Risk Management Plan.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The critical efficacy data for the FDC are derived from two Phase 3 studies (GS-US-236-102 and 103) 
conducted in ARV naïve subjects. These followed initial results from a Phase 2 study (GS-US-236-0104).

EVG/r compared with RAL each administered with a background regimen in 
HIV-1 infected, ARV treatment-experienced adults. 
GS-US-183-0105 was a dose-finding study that assessed the non-inferiority 
of EVG/r relative to an RTV-boosted comparative PI (CPI/r). 
GS-US-183-0130 was a Phase 2 study of the safety of 
EVG/r administered in combination with other ARV agents for the treatment of 
HIV-1 infected subjects. 
GS-US-216-0105 is an ongoing Phase 2 study of COBI-boosted ATV (ATV/co) 
compared to ATV/r in combination with TVD in HIV-1 infected ARV 
treatment-naive adults. 
GS-US-236-0101 evaluated the relative bioavailability of EVG boosted with 
different doses of COBI, FTC, and TFV when administered as the Stribild. 
In addition, the following studies with Stribild were ongoing at the time of submission: 
Table 54.  On-going studies 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
There were no clinical dose-finding studies with Stribild itself. However, a preliminary study of the safety 
and efficacy of the selected doses for the Stribild was conducted (GS-US-236-0104), as described below. 
This study employed the F1 tablet formulation. 
The  applicant  states  that  the  dose  of  EVG  (150  mg)  was  selected  based  on  the  PK/PD  study 
GS-US-183-0101,  the  Phase  2  study  in  heavily  treatment-experienced  HIV-1  infected  subjects 
GS-US-183-0105  and  study  GS-US-183-0140,  which  established  bioequivalence  between  the  125  mg 
tablet used GS-US-183-0105 and the 150 mg F2 tablet intended for commercial use. 
The applicant states that the dose of COBI (150 mg) was selected based on GS-US-216-0101, which 
described  the  pharmacokinetics  of  COBI  50,  100  and  200  mg  doses,  and  GS-US-236-0101,  which 
evaluated the relative bioavailability of tablets containing EVG 150 mg, FTC 200 mg, TDF 300 mg plus 
COBI at either 100 mg or 150 mg vs. EVG/r 150/100 mg and vs. FTC 200 mg + TDF 300 mg 
Administration of Stribild with food in treatment naïve subjects would be expected to provide at least 
comparable antiviral activity of FTC and TFV as would be obtained using Truvada or Emtriva + Viread.  
GS-US-236-0104  provided  preliminary  data  on  the  antiviral  effect  of  the  selected  doses  of  the 
components  of  the  F1  Stribild  tablet  in  treatment-naïve  subjects  when  compared  to  Atripla  in  a  2:1 
randomisation ratio. Stribild tablets were taken once daily with food. Atripla was taken once daily on an 
empty stomach and at bedtime. The primary endpoint was proportion with < 50 copies/ml at week 24 and 
the  results  were  considered  to  support  the  selection  of  Stribild  component  doses  with  rates  at  <  50 
copies/ml in excess of 80% regardless of the method of data analysis.

Methods 
The  two  Phase  III  studies  with  Stribild  (GS-US-236-0102  and  GS-US-236-0103)  generally  followed 
comparable designs except as stated. The study outlines are shown below:

Study Participants  
The critical inclusion criteria required: 
• 
Plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5000 copies/mL 
•  No prior use of any approved or investigational antiretroviral drug for any length of time 
•  Screening HIV-1 genotype report must have shown sensitivity to FTC, TDF, and EFV HIV-1 (genotype 
[reverse transcriptase and protease] was assessed at screening). 
•  Normal ECG 
•  Adequate renal function: CG formula GFR ≥ 70 mL/min  
•  AST and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN 
• 
Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or normal direct bilirubin 
•  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm3; platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3; haemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL 
•  Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN (or if amylase > 5 × ULN, serum lipase was to be ≤ 5 × ULN) 
•  Use of highly effective contraception 
HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations were assessed using the COBAS Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test (Version 
1.5).  At  screening,  the  protease/reverse  transcriptase  (PR/RT)  genotype  was  assessed  using  the 
GeneSeq™  assay  (Monogram  Biosciences,  South  San  Francisco,  CA).  This  assay  also  determined  the 
HIV-1 subtype.  
Post-baseline resistance analyses included PR/RT and integrase (IN) genotyping and phenotyping. The 
PhenoSense GT™ (PhenoSense IN) and GeneSeq IN assays (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, 
CA) were used for this purpose. Samples with successful PhenoSense GT results for PR/RT but with IN 
assay failure were retested for the IN genotype using the GenoSure assay (LabCorp Center for Molecular 
Biology and Pathology, Research Triangle Park, NC). Integrase testing was also conducted at baseline for 
those subjects in the resistance analysis population (RAP).  
Randomisation 
Randomisation was by IVRS in a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to screening HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100.000 or 
> 100,000 copies/ml.  
Treatments 
In both studies the Stribild or its matching placebo tablet was administered orally as one tablet once daily 
with food and at approximately the same time each day.  
• 
In GS-US-236-0102 Atripla or its matching placebo tablet was administered orally as one tablet once 
daily taken on an empty stomach prior to bedtime and at approximately the same time each day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013

• 
In GS-US-236-0103 all treatment (active or placebo for each of Stribild, atazanavir [ATV], ritonavir 
[rtv] and Truvada [TVD]) was taken once daily with food at approximately the same time each day. 
Blinding (masking) 
The studies were planned to be of double-blind and double-dummy design up to Week 96. After week 96 
until  unblinding  of  the  database  the  subjects  continue  on  assigned  therapy.  There  are  then  roll-over 
studies in which subjects are offered open label Stribild. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of each study was as follows: 
To evaluate the efficacy of the Stribild [EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF] vs. a comparative regimen in HIV-1 infected, 
antiretroviral  treatment-naïve  adult  subjects,  as  determined  by  the  achievement  of  HIV-1  RNA  <  50 
copies/mL at Week 48. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48, 
as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
- 
- 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  HIV-1  RNA  <  50  copies/mL  at  Week  96,  as  defined  by  the 
snapshot analysis algorithm 
The achievement and maintenance of confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Weeks 48 
and 96, as defined by TLOVR 
Sample size/ Statistical methods 
A total sample size of 700 subjects randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 2 groups (350 subjects per group) had at 
least  95%  power  to  establish  non-inferiority  with  respect  to  the  response  rate  of  HIV-1  RNA  <  50 
copies/mL at Week 48 between the two treatment groups, as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis. For 
sample size and power computation, it was assumed that both treatment groups had a response rate of 
0.795 (based on study GS-01-934), a non-inferiority margin of 0.12 and a 1-sided, 0.025 significance 
level. Calculations were made using the software package nQuery Advisor, Version 6.0. 
Analysis populations for efficacy analyses were defined as follows: 
Randomised Analysis Set 
Included all randomised subjects (added for analysis in the SAP).  
Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set 
The ITT analysis set included all randomised who received at least 1 dose of study drug. This was the 
primary analysis set for efficacy analyses.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set 
The PP analysis set included all randomised who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had no major 
protocol violation (including violation of major entry criteria).  
There were two interim IDMC analyses performed at Weeks 12 and 24.  The sponsor did not have a prior 
intent to ask the IDMC to consider early termination of the study even if there was early evidence of 
favourable efficacy. Since there was no intent to stop the study early, the Haybittle procedure was used 
as a stopping rule. An alpha penalty of 0.001 was applied for each interim analysis performed by the IDMC. 
Therefore, for the primary endpoint analysis, a 95.2% CI (corresponding to an alpha level of 0.048) was 
constructed to preserve the overall alpha level of 0.05. As such, the primary analysis CI is described as a 
95% CI. 
The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL])-weighted difference in 
the response rate (P1 – P2) and its 95% CI were calculated based on stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel 
(MH) proportion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 83/147 
 
  
  
The  Stribild  was  to  be  considered  non-inferior  to  the  comparative  regimen  if  the  lower  bound  of  the 
2-sided 95% CI of the difference in the response rate (Stribild – ATR) was > −12%. If non-inferiority was 
established, the same 95% CI used to evaluate non-inferiority was used to evaluate superiority using the 
ITT analysis set. Thus, superiority of Stribild over comparator was established if the lower bound of the 
95%  CI  was  greater  than  0.  The  baseline  HIV-1  RNA  stratum  (≤  100,000  copies/mL  or  >  100,000 
copies/mL)-weighted, 2-sided CMH test was used to assess superiority as a supportive analysis. 
A secondary analysis based on the PP analysis set was to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis. 
Subjects excluded from the PP analysis set were determined before database lock. In addition, a series of 
sensitivity analyses were performed using the ITT analysis set.  
Results  
GS-US-236-0102 
Participant flow 
This study enrolled subjects at 97 US sites and 5 sites in Puerto Rico. Up to the data cut-off date 10.6% 
in the Stribild group and 13.1% in the Atripla group had discontinued study drug while 8.3% and 10.2% 
had discontinued from the study, the most common reasons being AEs and LTFU in both groups. 
Figure 9.  GS-US-236-0102: Disposition of Study Subjects 
Baseline data 
In general the baseline subject and disease characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. 
The majority of subjects were white males aged between 30-40 years. About one third had > 100,000 
copies/ml  at  baseline  with  mean  and  median  values  ~  4.7  log10  copies/ml.  Most  subjects  had  HIV-1 
subtype B (98%) while only 3 had subtype C, 2 had AE, 2 had AG and single subjects had A, A1 and 
“complex” mixtures of subtypes. Just under half had < 350 CD4 cells/µl and > 80% were asymptomatic. 
Few (< 5%) were co-infected with HBV or HCV.

Adherence to active study drug, as measured by pill count, was comparable (median 98.0% per group) 
between groups and 75% had an adherence rate of ≥ 95%. 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary analysis at Week 48 non-inferiority was demonstrated for Stribild vs. Atripla.  
Table 56.  GS-US-236-0102: Virologic Outcome at Week 48 (HIV-1 RNA Cutoff at 50 copies/mL, 
Snapshot Analysis, ITT Analysis Set). 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the PP analysis set although actual success rates were higher 
(94.9% and 96.0% had < 50 copies/ml; 95% CI -4.4%, 2.4%). Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in 
the  analysis  based  on  TLOVR  at  week  48  with  responder  rates  of  85.9%  vs.  83.2%  (95%  CI  -2.6%, 
8.1%). 
Pure virological failure (PVF; HIV-1 cut-off at 50 copies/mL and premature study drug discontinuation by 
Week 48) occurred in 10.9% (38/348) in the Stribild group and 13.4% (47/352) in the Atripla group. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint showed: 
•  After excluding study drug discontinuations not related to virological response and including all HIV-1 
RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set) the success rates were 89.7% in the Stribild group 
and 86.8% in the Atripla group (95% CI: −1.9% to 7.8%). 
• 
Including study drug discontinuations not related to virological response as successes and all HIV-1 
RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT set) the rates were 89.9% vs. 87.2% (95% CI: −2.0% to 
7.5%). 
•  Odds ratios were 1.35 (95% CI: 0.88 to 2.07) for baseline HIV-1 RNA level and 1.36 (95% CI: 0.89 
to 2.09) for region, indicating that the treatment effect was not confounded by these factors. 
A  higher  percentage  in  the  Atripla  group  (8%)  was  never  suppressed  vs.  the  Stribild  group  (4%). 
Convergence  of  the  KM  curves  began  to  occur  after  Week  12  and  similar  percentages  had  loss  of 
virological response in each treatment group by Week 48 (14% Stribild vs. 17% Atripla; p = 0.65).

In each of the M = F analysis and M = E analysis, the percentages with HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL 
were comparable between treatments and the lower bound of the 95% CI fell within -4%. 
Table 57.   GS-US-236-0102: Number and Percentage of Subjects with Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL at Week 48 (ITT Analysis Set). 
In the corresponding analyses in the PP analysis set the percentages with < 50 copies/mL were higher 
than in the ITT analysis set but similar trends were observed. 
Mean decreases from baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels were greater in the Stribild group through Week 8 and 
then comparable between treatments at all subsequent time points. Mean increases from baseline in CD4 
cell counts were numerically higher in the Stribild group at all time points.  
Subgroup  analyses  (see  diagram  below)  revealed  high  and  generally  comparable  rates  of  virological 
success between treatments with point estimates that mostly favoured the Stribild group. In subjects 
with HIV RNA > 100,000 copies/ml at baseline the success rates were 83.9% for Stribild and 81.9% for 
Atripla (95% CI -7.6%, 11.6%).

There were 31 virological failures (14 Stribild) that were included in the Resistance Analysis Population.  
In the Stribild group 8/14 subjects had virus that showed emergent resistance to a study drug. Seven of 
these 8 viruses had the EVG resistance mutations IN E92Q alone or with H51Y, T66I, L68V, Q148R and/or 
N155H. All eight viruses developed RT M184V/I and phenotypic resistance to FTC and 3 developed K65R. 
The  other  6/14  lacked  emergent  resistance  mutations  in  IN  or  RT  and  remained  phenotypically 
susceptible to all drugs in the regimen. In addition, there was no development of primary PI-R mutations. 
The viruses that developed genotypic resistance to EVG showed a mean of 61-fold reduced susceptibility 
compared to wild-type. The biological cut-off for EVG is 2.5-fold in the PhenoSense assay, and all subjects 
with ≥ 2.5-fold change in susceptibility to EVG had primary EVG resistance mutations. Viruses resistant to 
EVG also showed reduced susceptibility to RAL. 
In the Atripla group 8/17 subjects had viruses that showed emergent resistance to a study drug. Seven 
of these 8 viruses developed the EFV resistance mutation RT K103N alone or with other known NNRTI 
resistance mutations (V90I, K101E, V108I, Y188F/H/L, G190A and/or M230L). One developed K101E/K 
alone but did not show reduced susceptibility to EFV, possibly due to the mixture with wild type. Two with 
K103N also developed K65R and M184V and phenotypic resistance to FTC. The other 9/17 viruses lacked 
emergent  resistance  mutations  and  remained  phenotypically  susceptible  to  all  drugs  in  the  regimen. 
There was also no development of primary PI-R mutations. 
GS-US-236-0103 
Participant flow  
There were 715 subjects randomised across 146 sites in 16 countries. A large proportion came from N. 
America, including sites that participated in study 0102; other sites were located in Europe, Australia and 
Thailand.  At  the  data  cut-off  9.3%  in  the  Stribild  group  and  11.3%  in  the  comparative  group  had 
discontinued study drug while 6.2% and 8.7% had discontinued study, mostly due to AEs and LTFU.

Conduct of the study 
A  routine  GCP  inspection  was  conducted,  involving  three  study  sites  in  GS-US-236-0103.  Overall, 
compliance with ICH GCP and European and National legislation was considered satisfactory at all three 
sites.  
Baseline data 
In general the baseline subject and disease characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. 
The  majority  of  subjects  were  white  males  aged  between  30-40  years.  About  40%  had  >  100,000 
copies/ml  at  baseline  with  mean  and  median  values  ~  4.8  log10  copies/ml.  Most  subjects  had  HIV-1 
subtype B (91%) while 11 had subtype C, 16 had AE, 13 had AG, 5 had A1, 5 had G, < 5 had others and 
9  had  “complex”  mixtures  of  subtypes.  About  one  half  had  <  350  CD4  cells/µl  and  >  80%  were 
asymptomatic. Few (< 5%) were co-infected with HBV or HCV. Adherence to study drug was comparable 
between treatments at ~ 98.5%. Most subjects had an adherence rate of ≥ 95% (73.3% in the Stribild 
group and 78.0% in the comparative group). 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary analysis at Week 48 non-inferiority was demonstrated for the Stribild vs. comparator (see 
below). In addition, 5.4% per group had virological failure while 5.1% (18/353) in the Stribild group and 
7.9%  (28/355)  in  the  comparator  group  had  no  virological  data  in  the  Week  48  analysis  window. 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the PP analysis set although actual success rates were higher. 
Non-inferiority was also demonstrated in the analysis based on TLVOR with rates of 86.1% vs. 84.8% 
(95% CI -3.6, 6.8). Pure virological failure (PVF; HIV-1 cut-off at 50 copies/mL and premature study drug 
discontinuation by Week 48) occurred in 10.2% (36/353) in the Stribild group and 11.0% (39/355) in the 
comparator. 
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint showed: 
•  After excluding study drug discontinuations not related to virological response and including all HIV-1 
RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set) the success rates were 91.0% in the Stribild group 
and 89.0% in the comparator group (95% CI: −2.3% to 6.7%). 
• 
• 
Including study drug discontinuations not related to virological response as successes and all HIV-1 
RNA data for late discontinuation (ITT analysis set) the rates were 91.2% vs. 89.3% (95% CI: −2.3% 
to 6.5%). 
In the third sensitivity analysis Odds ratios were 1.33 (95% CI: 0.84 to 2.12) for baseline HIV-1 RNA 
level and 1.35 (95% CI: 0.84 to 2.15) for region, indicating that the treatment effect for the primary 
endpoint was not confounded by these factors.

Table 58.  GS-US-236-0103: Virologic Outcome at Week 48 (HIV-1 RNA Cutoff at 50 copies/mL, 
Snapshot Analysis) (ITT Analysis Set). 
At  Week  48,  5.4%  (19/353)  in  the  Stribild  group  and  4.2%  (15/355)  in  the  comparator  group  had 
confirmed viral rebound (12 vs. 8 subjects) or never achieved viral suppression (7 per group) through 
Week 48 and were considered non-responders. Similar percentages had loss of virological response in 
each treatment group by Week 48 (16% Stribild vs. 17% comparator; p = 0.48). 
In each of the M = F analysis and M = E analysis, the percentages with HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL 
were  comparable  between  treatments  and  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  fell  within  -3%.  In  the 
corresponding analyses in the PP analysis set the percentages with < 50 copies/mL were higher than in 
the ITT analysis set but similar trends were observed.

<50 copies/ML at Week 48 (ITT Analysis Set). 
Mean decreases from baseline in HIV-1 RNA levels were greater in the Stribild group through Weeks 2-12 
and then comparable between treatments at all subsequent time points. Mean increases from baseline in 
CD4 cell counts were comparable between treatments at all time points.  
Subgroup  analyses  (see  diagram  below)  revealed  high  and  generally  comparable  rates  of  virological 
success between the treatment groups. Point estimates mostly favoured the Stribild except that within 
the  subgroup  of  female  subjects  (n  =  68)  the  difference  in  response  rate  (−1.2%)  favoured  the

comparator and the relatively small number of subjects contributed to the wide CI (95% CI: −20.6% to 
18.3%).

Week 48 (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, Snapshot Analysis) (ITT Analysis Set). 
Homogeneity tests performed for the primary endpoint did not show a significant difference in treatment 
effects between subgroups 
There were 20 virological failures (12 Stribild) that were included in the Resistance Analysis Population. 
In the Stribild group 5/12 subjects had virus that showed emergent resistance to a study drug. Four of 
these 5 viruses had emergent IN resistance mutations including Q148R, N155H or a complex mixture of 
T661,  E92Q  and  N155H  and  phenotypic  resistance  to  EVG.  Four  viruses  developed  RT  M184V/I  and 
phenotypic resistance to FTC and one developed K65R. Six lacked emergent resistance mutations in IN or 
RT and remained phenotypically susceptible to all drugs in the regimen and three of these cases showed 
re-suppression to < 50 copies/ml without a change in regimen. The viruses that developed genotypic 
resistance to EVG showed a mean of 78-fold reduced susceptibility compared to wild-type. All subjects 
with ≥ 2.5-fold change in susceptibility to EVG had primary EVG resistance mutations. Viruses resistant to 
EVG also showed reduced susceptibility to RAL. 
In the ATV/rtv group no subjects had viruses that showed emergent resistance to a study drug. There was 
also no development of primary NNRTI mutations. 
Longer-term data from Phase 3 studies 
During the procedure the applicant reported on analyses performed when all subjects had completed 96 
weeks of treatment (or had discontinued) in the two Phase 3 studies (GS-US-236-0102 and 0103). While 
the critical efficacy data are summarised below the CSRs will be submitted in a later procedure.

•  At Week 96 in GS-US-236-0102, 84.2% in the Stribild group and 81.5% in the ATR group had < 50 
copies/mL (ITT, snapshot analysis). The difference in the percentage with virological success was 
2.7% (95% CI: −2.9% to 8.3%).  
•  Corresponding data from GS-US-236-0103 showed rates of 83.3% for Stribild vs. 82.3% for 
ATV/r+TVD (difference 1.1%; 95% CI: −4.5% to 6.7%). 
•  At Week 96 in GS-US-236-0102, the mean (SD) increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were 295 
(213.3) cells/μL in the Stribild group and 273 (189.7) cells/μL in the ATR group. The difference in LSM 
was 22 (95% CI: −10 to 54).  
•  At Week 96 in GS-US-236-0103, the mean (SD) increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were 256 
(167.1) cells/μL in the Stribild group and 261 (188.0) cells/μL in the ATV/r+TVD group. The difference 
in LSM was −8 (95% CI: −35 to 19). In both studies, CD4 cell counts continued to increase from Week 
48 to Week 96.

Study GS-US-236-0103 is a Phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, 
randomized, active-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of the QUAD STR 
versus a ATV/r+TVD regimen in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adult 
subjects. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups: 
Treatment Group 1: STR of EVG 150 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg (QUAD) 
once daily + placebos to match RTV 100 mg, ATV 300 mg, and TVD (FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 
mg) once daily 
Treatment Group 2: RTV 100 mg, ATV 300 mg, and TVD (FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg) once 
daily + placebo to match STR containing EVG 150 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 
mg (QUAD) once daily 
A total of 700 subjects were planned to be enrolled into this study (350 subjects in 
eachtreatment group). 
Randomization was stratified based on HIV-1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or> 100,000 
copies/mL) at screening. HIV-1 genotype (reverse transcriptase and protease) was 
assessed at screening. Laboratory analyses (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), HIV-1 
RNA levels, CD4 cell count, and complete or symptom-directed physical examinations were 
performed at screening, baseline (Day 1), and all subsequent study visits. Adverse events 
(AEs) and concomitant medications were assessed at each visit. During the double-blind 
treatment period, study visits occurred at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48, and 
then will occur every 12 weeks through Week 96. 
After Week 96, subjects will continue to take their blinded study drug and attend visits every 
12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded. At the unblinding visit, subjects will be 
given the option to participate in an open-label rollover study to receive the QUAD STR until 
it becomes commercially available or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate its 
development. 
Subjects who complete the study through the unblinding visit and do not wish to participate 
in the open-label rollover study will be required to return to the clinic 30 days after the 
completion of study drugs for a 30-day follow-up visit.

GS-US-183-0145 - This study enrolled ARV-experienced but INI-naïve subjects with ≥ 1000 copies/mL 
and with viruses showing resistance to (IAS-USA) 2 or more classes of ARVs and/or at least 6 months 
experience with 2 or more different classes of ARVs. Randomisation was to EVG/rtv or raltegravir (RAL) 
and was stratified by ≤ 100,000 copies/mL or > 100,000 copies/mL and according to the class of the 
second agent (NRTI vs. other classes). The primary analysis was at Week 48. 
Figure 13.  GS-US-183-0145: Study Schema 
The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was based on an assumed TLOVR response rate of 74%, derived 
by review of recent RAL and etravirine studies in treatment-experienced subjects. The study met the 
pre-defined criteria for concluding non-inferiority at Week 48, as summarised below. In the PP analysis 
using the TLOVR approach the proportions reaching < 50 copies/ml were 74.5% for EVG vs. 73.2% for 
RAL  (95%  CI  -5.9,  8.6).  Very  similar  results  were  obtained  with  the  snapshot  analysis  in  the  PP 
population. 
Table 63.  GS-US-183-0145: Key Treatment Outcomes (ITT Analysis Set). 
GS-US-216-0105 - Phase 2 study.. This study showed that ATV/co+TVD was non-inferior to ATV/r+TVD 
based  on  the  FDA-defined  snapshot  analysis  (85.2%  vs.  of  87.4%  with  virological  success  in  the  ITT 
analysis set). The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-weighted difference in the percentages of subjects with 
virological  success  was  −2.2%  (95%  CI:  −7.4%  to  3.0%)  and  ATV/co+TVD  was  determined  to  be 
non-inferior to ATV/r+TVD. CD4 counts showed comparable mean increases between treatments at all 
time  points.  At  Week  48,  the  mean  (SD)  increases  from  baseline  were  213  (151.0)  cells/μL  in  the 
ATV/co+TVD group and 219 (150.4) cells/μL in the ATV/r+TVD group. The difference in LSM was  −5 
(95% CI: −28 to 18).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Building on virological response rates at < 50 copies/ml to the F1 Stribild tablet in the Phase 2 study, the 
applicant  conducted  two  Phase  3  studies  with  the  F2  Stribild  tablet  that  used  different  comparative 
regimens (see study specific sections below regarding the comparators). The design of these studies, with 
a primary analysis  at week 48, is in line with CHMP guidance on clinical development programmes in 
ART-naive populations.  
While Stribild was to be dosed with food, Atripla was taken in the evening without food and TVD+ATV/rtv 
were to be taken with food. These dosing conditions reflect the SmPCs. 
The two studies involved a range of countries but the majority of subjects were enrolled in N. America and 
the baseline characteristics of the two study populations were mostly closely comparable. It should be 
noted that subjects were to have eGFR at least 70 ml/min and that many concomitant medications were 
precluded in accordance with known and predicted DDIs. There was no limit set on baseline CD4 count. 
Poor (<70% at any visit) adherence to treatment (based on pill counts) was the commonest protocol 
deviation.,  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
• 
• 
The virological response rates at < 50 copies/ml at week 48 (FDA snapshot analysis) were 87.6% vs. 
84.1% for Stribild vs. Atripla and 89.5% vs. 86.8% for Stribild vs. ATV/r+TVD. The lower bound of the 
95% CI was well within the pre-defined margin (-12%). Actual 95% CIs were (-1.6%, 8.8%) and 
(-1.9%, 7.8%). A range of sensitivity analyses, including a TLOVR analysis, showed consistently 
comparable response rates for Stribild vs. comparators. The actual response rates were in the range 
~84% to ~98% depending on the analysis and the study population.  
The analyses according to baseline characteristics did not show any disadvantages for Stribild, 
including groups with >100,000 copies/ml and CD4 counts < 350/mm3. 
•  Decreases in viral load were closely comparable between treatments in both studies.  
• 
Increments in CD4 counts up to week 48 were higher in the Stribild group in 0102 and comparable 
between treatments in 0103. 
These  analyses  support  a  conclusion  that  Stribild  is  at  least  as  effective  as  the  selected  comparative 
regimens. Some further observations on the evidence of efficacy in the two Phase III studies include: 
Selection of comparative regimens 
Since the applicant provides two non-inferiority studies the selection of the comparative agents is a 
critical factor for the validity of the findings and analyses. 
GS-US-236-0102  
Stribild was compared to Atripla in previously ARV-naïve subjects. This use of Atripla contrasts with the 
EU SmPC, which restricts use to subjects who have already achieved virological suppression on another 
regimen. The reasons for the EU-worded approval (vs. that elsewhere in the world) can be found in the 
Atripla EPAR) . However, in light of the very specific EU approval, the validity of the comparison between 
Stribild and Atripla in one of the two pivotal efficacy studies merits some further re-examination. 
Since doubts were raised from the EU approval of Atripla regarding the possible adequacy of Atripla when 
used to treat previously ARV-naïve subjects it seems relevant to examine the response rates documented 
in study 0102 with other studies in ARV naïve populations. 
Perhaps one of the most relevant comparisons is with the raltegravir study vs. efavirenz (P021) in which 
both agents were administered with Truvada taken with food (i.e. TFV plasma levels would be expected 
to be higher vs. those achieved with the same regimen administered as Atripla). The study population was

not identical to that in GS-US-236-0102 in that it comprised ~80% males but a mix mainly of white and 
Hispanic races and ~20% had non-clade B virus. Just over 50% had > 100,000 copies/ml and also just 
over 50% had CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3 while ~ 10% had < 50 cells/mm3 at baseline. Using the NC=F 
approach 86% RAL and 82% EFV subjects had < 50 copies/ml at week 48. The OF analysis gave rates of 
92%  vs.  89%.  In  the  various  subgroups  rates  for  achieving  <  50  copies/ml  fell  somewhere  between 
85-95% in both groups. Increments in CD4 counts were 189 and 163 in RAL and EFV groups, respectively. 
Response rates in the ARV-naïve are also available from the darunavir study C211, which compared once 
daily dosing vs. Kaletra, both administered in conjunction with Truvada. The study population was again 
slightly different (e.g. 70% male, 60% clade B, 35% with > 100,000 copies/ml and near to 60% with CD4 
counts > 200 cells/mm3). At week 48 rates for < 50 copies/mL were ~ 85% for darunavir and 79% for 
Kaletra (TLOVR). In the snapshot analysis rates  were ~84% and 78%. For observed data rates were 
around 90% per group. 
A third example to note is the rilpivirine study C209 in which rilpivirine was compared with EFV, both 
administered with FTC/TDF. The study population was about 75% male, 60% white and ~70% had clade 
B  virus.  Just  under  half  had  >100,000copies/ml  and  >  60%  had  CD4  counts  >  200  cells/mm3.  The 
primary analysis in ITT subjects used the TLOVR algorithm and showed rates for <50 copies/ml at week 
48 of 83% in each treatment group with rates of 82% for both in the snapshot analysis. 
Making comparisons across studies must be viewed with considerable caution. Nevertheless, taking into 
account the results mentioned above the CHMP finds no reason to dismiss the conclusion of Stribild vs. 
Atripla solely on the basis that use of Atripla from the outset is not approved in the EU.    
GS-US-236-0103  
The combination of ATV/rtv plus Truvada is not one of the favourite starting regimens in the EU. Opinions 
vary  regarding  the  use  of  a  boosted  PI  plus  2  NRTIs  as  initial  therapy  and  some  guidelines  suggest 
reserving this combination for those in whom 2 NRTIs plus one NNRTI is not appropriate for some reason. 
Nevertheless,  ATV/rtv  is  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  in  ARV-naïve  subjects  and  CHMP  has  accepted 
comparisons of test regimens vs. boosted PI-containing regimens to support use in the ARV-naïve. In 
study 0138 ATV/rtv was compared with Kaletra, each administered with Truvada, to ARV-naïve subjects. 
Rates for <50 copies/ml at week 48 were 78% and 76%, respectively.  
Selection of virus with RAMs 
In a pooled analysis of antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving Stribild in Phase 3 studies GS US 236 0102 
and GS US 236 0103, as of week 48, the development of 1 or more primary elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or 
tenofovir resistance-associated substitutions was observed in the HIV 1 from 13 of the 25 patients with 
evaluable  genotypic  data  from  paired  baseline  and  Stribild  treatment  failure  isolates  (1.9%,  13/701 
patients.  The available data showed that not all failures were associated with acquisition of RAMs. In the 
Stribild group the resistance analysis strongly pointed to co-selection of virus containing IN mutations 
along with resistance to FTC, with or without TFV. These results may reflect a relatively low genetic barrier 
to resistance to EVG. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data for Stribild support its use in ARV-naïve subjects or in subjects infected with virus that 
has no known RAMs for any of EVG, FTC or TFV. 
The outstanding issues are minor and do not preclude recommendation for granting a Marketing 
Authorisation. 
The CHMP considers the following clinical measures necessary post-authorisation, which are included in 
the Risk Management Plan: 
•  Clinical study of STB in HIV-1 infected women (GS-US-236-0128) including information on BMD in 
HIV-1 infected women from a subset of subjects from Study GS US 236 0128 in which DEXA scans will 
be performed with up to 96 weeks of STB therapy   (Week 48 report by Q4 2016 and final results by 
Q4 2017).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The following evaluation focuses on the safety data, updated during the procedure, for each of EVG and 
COBI and for Stribild in Phase 2 and 3 studies in HIV-infected subjects. Details of AEs are provided only 
for the Stribild studies.  
. 
EVG - The principal safety data came from the week 96 analysis of GS-US-183-0145 in ARV 
treatment-experienced subjects. Supportive data come from GS-US-183-0105 and GS-US-183-0130. 
Table 64.  GS-US-183-0145, 0105, and 0130: Summary of Treatment Groups and Exposures. 
COBI - The principal safety data came from the Phase 2 and 3 studies as follows:

Stribild - The principal data came from Phase 2 and 3 studies GS-US-236-0102, 0103 and 0104. 
This safety update was provided during the procedure following CHMP request. The principal sources of 
this update are from at least 96 weeks of the 2 phase III studies for Stribild  with numbers as follows:

Analysis Set). 
Adverse events 
For most TEAEs the important data were included in the initial study reports up to at least Week 48, which 
can be summarised as follows: 
Table 67.  GS-US-236-0102, 0103, 0104: Overall Summary of Adverse Events (Safety Analysis Set). 
Specific and important updates on these initial data are covered in the sections that follow. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 102/147 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In the week 48 analyses the most frequently reported TEAEs are shown in the table below. Rates were 
lower in the Stribild group for dizziness, somnolence, abnormal dreams, insomnia and rash but higher in 
the Stribild group for nausea.  The minority of TEAEs were of Grade 3 or 4. 
Table 68.  GS-US-236-0102, 0103, 0104: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported for at Least 
5% of Subjects in Any Treatment Group (Safety Analysis Set).  
A lower percentage of subjects in the Stribild group compared with the Atripla or ATV/r + TVD groups 
reported any TEAE considered related to study drug by the investigator (Stribild 45.8%, 343 subjects; 
ATR 66.7%, 250 subjects; ATV/r+TVD 57.2%, 203 subjects). 
In the two Phase 3 studies the specific comparisons between the Stribild and comparator groups are also 
of note rather than the pooled Stribild comparisons shown above. In GS-US-236-0102 the safety profiles 
of the Stribild and Atripla regimens were very closely comparable with the exception of the differences 
imposed  by  the  efavirenz-associated  TEAEs.  The  Stribild  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of 
gastrointestinal TEAEs and these were more likely to be of severe intensity.

Subjects in Either Treatment Group (Safety Analysis Set). 
In  GS-US-236-0103 TEAE  reporting rates were mostly comparable or lower in the Stribild group. The 
same observations broadly applied to rates for Grade 3 or 4 and drug-related TEAEs.

Subjects in Either Treatment Group (Safety Analysis Set). 
Rates of TEAEs of interest are shown in the next table below.  
Renal events  
As shown in the table, the number of renal AEs of interest increased from 6 to 12 (and from 5 to 11 in the 
Stribild group) between the cut-off for the initial application dossier and that for the Stribild safety update. 
While no additional subjects had renal findings consistent with the applicant’s initial or later revised (more 
inclusive)  pre-specified  criteria  for  PRT  vs.  the  initial  dossier  the  actual  nature  of  these  renal  AEs  of 
interest merits further scrutiny.

Table 71.   
The safety update clarified that in the two Phase 3 studies there were 16 subjects (2.3%) in the Stribild 
group who had a renal SAE, discontinued study drug due a renal AE and/or had a pre-specified renal AE 
of interest. One subject (0.3%) in the ATR group (shown in the table above) had a pre-specified renal AE 
of interest. There were also two subjects (0.6%) in the ATV/r+TVD group who discontinued study drug 
due to renal AEs but did not have a renal AE of interest.  The summary of these events by event category 
is as follows: 
•  One subject (0.1%) in the Stribild group had an SAE of renal failure 
• 
• 
Ten subjects (1.4%) in the Stribild group discontinued study drug due to renal events (blood 
creatinine increased for 4 subjects, renal failure for 3 subjects, acute renal failure for 1 subject, 
Fanconi syndrome acquired for 1 subject and GFR abnormal for 1 subject) 
Two subjects (0.6%) in the ATV/r+TVD group discontinued study drug due to renal events (creatinine 
renal clearance decreased for 1 subject and toxic nephropathy for 1 subject). 
•  Renal AEs of interest were reported for 11 subjects (1.6%) in the Stribild group and for 1 subject 
(0.3%) in the ATR group (p = 0.071 for Stribild vs. ATR; p = 0.020). 
• 
• 
• 
In the Stribild group, the renal AEs of interest reported were renal failure (8 subjects), acute renal 
failure (2 subjects), and Fanconi syndrome acquired (1 subject).  
The renal AE of interest reported for a subject in the ATR group was renal failure. 
For 4 subjects (0.6%) in the Stribild group, the renal AEs and laboratory findings were consistent with 
PRT. Two of the 4 subjects had eGFR < 70 mL/min at screening or baseline. Each of these subjects 
discontinued study drug due to renal AEs. While laboratory findings in all of these subjects with 
evidence of PRT improved after discontinuation they did not necessarily return to baseline and/or fall 
within normal ranges at the last documented measurement.

These  four  subjects  attended  scheduled  visits  for  determination  of  reversibility.  Serum  creatinine 
returned  to  within  approximately  25%  of  the  baseline  level  in  all  4  subjects  at  2  consecutive  visits 
post-discontinuation, during which time 3 initiated RPV or a PI/r. The fourth subject withdrew consent and 
no further follow-up data are available.

with Renal Events Consistent with PRT who Received STB. 
Hypophosphataemia  returned  to  baseline  post-discontinuation  in  the  single  subject  that  had  this 
abnormality. 
More  detailed  individual  summary  figures  for  these  4  STB  subjects  who  had  evidence  of  PRT  and 
discontinued showed that two subjects continued to have variable proteinuria after discontinuing STB. 
Only one subject showed early and marked abnormalities in creatinine, proteinuria and glycosuria.  
There were also six subjects in the COBI Phase 3 study who developed PRT while taking ATV/co + TVD. 
For  the  most  part,  and  where  data  are  available,  these  subjects  did  trend  towards  improvement  or 
resolution of the findings over time. 
For the other 12/16 subjects in the Stribild group who had a renal SAE, discontinued study drug due a 
renal AE and/or had a pre-specified renal AE of interest. 6/12 subjects had AEs reported as renal failure, 
increased serum creatinine or decreased GFR that were associated with proteinuria. 
The relationship between TFV and COBI PK and effects on renal parameters was explored. Subjects in the 
Phase 2 and 3 STB studies (n = 419) were classified according to < 0.4 mg/dL or ≥ 0.4 mg/dL change in 
serum creatinine, with or without at least 1 grade-level increases in renal tubular markers. The analysis 
showed  a  similar  range  of  TFV  and  COBI  AUC,  Cmax  and  Cmin  across  these  categories,  indicating  the 
absence of exposure-driven trends in parameters. 
In a further exploration, the applicant tabulated subjects with confirmed laboratory abnormalities (see 
the footnotes), which included the four subjects considered to meet the applicant’s PRT criteria. 
As shown in the next table six STB (0.9%) and 5 ATV/r+TVD (1.4%) subjects (but no ATR subjects) had 
confirmed increases from baseline in serum creatinine and a ≥ 1 grade-level increase from baseline in one 
renal tubular marker, which was proteinuria in all subjects. Four of the 6 STB subjects did not have PRT 
and 3 of them continued study drug. Not all had concurrent abnormalities.  
Of the 5 subjects in the ATV/r+TVD group, 4 subjects continued study drug but 0663-7308 discontinued 
due to a renal AE as reported previously. None had findings consistent with PRT and all 5 subjects had at 
least one renal risk factor.

Table 73.  GS-US-236-0102 and GS-US-236-0103: Percentage of Subjects by the Number of 
Confirmed Renal Laboratory Abnormalities (Safety Analysis Set). 
Three STB subjects and one ATR subject had confirmed increase from baseline in serum creatinine and ≥ 
1 grade-level increase from baseline in two or more renal tubular markers (none on ATV/r+TVD). Two of 
the 3 in the STB group had findings consistent with PRT as previously described. The other subject did not 
have  PRT  and  was  continuing  study  drug  with  confirmed  hypophosphataemia,  proteinuria  (≥  1 
grade-level  increases  from  baseline)  and  serum  creatinine  increase  (≥  0.4  mg/dL)  at  different  times 
during the study. Maximum serum creatinine was 1.64 mg/dL at Week 60 but dropped to 1.13 mg/dL at 
Week 96. The proteinuria was pre-existing (+1 to +2 at baseline) and hypophosphataemia was based on 
2.8 mg/dL at baseline, 2.6-3.8 mg/dL at Week 20 through Week 96 and was improved at the next visit.  
One STB subject and one ATV/r+TVD subject had ≥ 1 grade-level increase from baseline in proteinuria 
and hypophosphataemia without a confirmed increase from baseline in serum creatinine. The STB subject 
had  confirmed  hypophosphataemia  and  proteinuria  (≥  1  grade-level  increase  from  baseline) 
non-concurrently. There was an unconfirmed increase in serum creatinine (1.40 mg/dL; eGFRCG 89.41 
mL/min)  at  Week  16  only.  Hypophosphataemia  and  proteinuria  improved  at  sequential  visits  while 
continuing study drug.  
Rates for confirmed increases in serum creatinine (using the applicant’s criteria to differentiate COBI and 
RTV-associated effects from other treatment effects) were STB 4.1%, ATV/r+TVD 3.1% and ATR 2.6%.

Table 74.   
The changes in serum creatinine from Week 4 onwards were minimal (≤ 0.04 mg/dL) and similar between 
treatment groups. 
At Week 48 treatment-emergent proteinuria was reported for 38.6% STB, 24.1% ATV/r+TVD and 28.8% 
ATR  subjects.  Differences  between  groups  were  still  apparent  at  Week  96  (STB  46.2%;  ATV/r+TVD 
36.6%; ATR 37.6%). However, the incremental incidence of treatment-emergent proteinuria (new onset 
or worsening grading relative to baseline) from Week 48 to Week 96 in the STB group was 7.6% vs. 
ATV/r+TVD 12.5% and ATR 8.8%). In addition, the cumulative rates of confirmed increases in proteinuria 
through Week 96 were similar between groups (STB 11.8%; ATV/r+TVD 10.4%; ATR 7.7%).  
Treatment-emergent proteinuria that persisted for more than 2 consecutive visits occurred in STB 5.1%, 
ATV/r+TVD 3.7% and ATR 1.7%. There were similar findings for the analysis by the presence (≥ +1) or 
absence (negative or trace) of proteinuria at baseline. 
Percentages of subjects with new or worsening proteinuria in each visit window were higher in the STB 
group than in the comparator groups in visit windows from Week 24 to Week 60. Rates were generally 
similar between treatments in other visit windows. Percentages in each visit window after Week 48 did not 
increase  progressively.  The  applicant  considered  that  STB  does  not  increase  the  risk  of  persistent 
proteinuria over time compared to ATV/r+TVD or ATR.

Bone fracture events  
The majority of the reported fractures occurred due to traumatic injury. Non-traumatic fractures were 
reported for one subject in each group in GS-US-236-0103. 
Rash events 
In  the  Stribild  studies  percentages  that  reported  any  rash  AE  based  on  a  pre-specified  analysis  were 
17.5%  in  the  Stribild  group  [131  subjects],  27.7%  Atripla  [104  subjects]  and  18%  [64  subjects] 
ATV/r+TVD.  No rash SAEs were reported in the Stribild group and only one led to drug discontinuation. 
ECG effects 
• 
• 
In GS-US-236-0102 there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline for ECG parameters and 
no notable differences between treatment groups in percentages with ECG abnormalities. 
In GS-US-236-0103 there were no notable differences between treatment groups in percentages with 
ECG abnormalities. Two subjects in the Stribild group developed clinically significant abnormal ECGs 
by Week 48 that concerned atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia.   
Serious adverse event and deaths 
In the pooled Phase 2/3 studies there were 6 treatment-emergent deaths, all were considered not related 
to the medication– one in the Stribild group (0.1%; a case of suicide), two in the Atripla group (0.5%; 
hanging  and  metastatic  carcinoma)  and  3  ATV/r  +  TVD  subjects  (0.8%;  septic  shock,  P.  carinii 
pneumonia and cardiopulmonary arrest).  
In the original MAA, the frequencies of SAEs were Stribild 9.6% (67 subjects), ATR 6.8% (24 subjects) 
and ATV/r+TVD 8.7% (31 subjects). By the time of the safety update the rates had increased to 12.8%, 
9.4% and 14.1%, respectively. Cellulitis was the only individual SAE reported in at least 1% of subjects 
in any treatment group (Stribild 1.0%, 7 subjects; ATR 0 subjects; ATV/r+TVD 0.6%, 2 subjects).  
The rates of SAEs considered related to study drug by the investigator were low and comparable between 
groups (Stribild 0.7%, 5 subjects; ATR 2.0%, 7 subjects; ATV/r+TVD 0.6%, 2 subjects). No individual 
SAE considered related was reported for more than one subject in any treatment group (table below).

Table 75.   
A  possible  excess  of  observed  NHL/Hodgkin  cases  was  observed  across  the  EVG  and  Stribild  studies. 
Cases  observed  in  Stribild  recipients  include  one  case  of  Burkitt’s  lymphoma  in  study  103  (Day  342, 
patient 1021-7348) and a case of lymphoma in study 102 (Day 80, patient 0315-6335; reported to be a 
large  cell  lymphoma).  In  addition,  B-cell  lymphoma  was  reported  in  2  subjects  (2.8%)  in  the  EVG/r 
20/100-mg  group  in  the  EVG  dose-finding  study  GS-US-183-0105.  The  applicant  provided  a  detailed 
report  of  all  NHL/Hodgkin  cases  observed  during  the  EVG  and  Stribild  development  programmes  and 
compared rates with those documented in other settings. It was concluded that there is no clear signal for 
an association between EVG and risk of lymphoma  
Laboratory findings 
The  frequencies  of  Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities  in  the  original  MAA  were  Stribild  16.6% 
(116/699), ATR 23.4% (82/351) and ATV/r+TVD 67.9% (239/352). The rates at the time of the safety 
update  were  Stribild  20.9%  (146/699),  ATR  30.2%  (106/351)  and  ATV/r+TVD  75.6%  (266/352).  In 
particular, changes from baseline in serum creatinine and eGFRCG and changes from baseline in BMD 
remained stable from Week 48 to 96. The table below summarises the data.

Abnormalities Reported for at Lease 1% of Subjects in Any Treatment Group (Safety Analysis Set). 
However, virtually all subjects had grade 1 laboratory abnormalities. The majority of the abnormalities 
reported were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and the supplementary tables provide the following data: 
Table 77.   
Assessment report

Therefore the data showed an excess of raised serum creatinine with Stribild and also showed a higher 
rate of proteinuria but there was no excess of hypophosphataemia or glycosuria. 
The supplementary tables also showed the correlation between serum creatinine increases and the other 
three parameters for the three treatments. It is important to appreciate the footnotes, which explains why 
the  numbers  (e.g.  total  with  proteinuria  in  this  table  refers  only  to  those  few  with  at  least  a 2-grade 
increase from baseline) are so different vs. those shown above for any grade proteinuria. Hence the table 
does not show the correlation between occurrence of any abnormalities in these parameters and rates of 
co-existence of these abnormalities.  
Table 78.   
Increases in serum creatinine in the Stribild group were noted from Week 2, when the median change 
from baseline was 0.09 mg/dL, after which values generally stabilised so that the median change from 
baseline at Week 48 was 0.13 mg/dL. The pattern of change in the ATV/r+TVD group was comparable but 
the median changes from baseline were 0.05 mg/dL and 0.08 mg/dL at Weeks 2 and 48 while there were 
no notable changes from baseline in the Atripla group.  
A higher percentage in the Stribild vs. other groups had Grade 1 serum creatinine abnormalities reported 
(Stribild 6.4%, 48 subjects; Atripla 0.8%, 3 subjects; ATV/r+TVD 4.0%, 14 subjects) but rates for Grade 
2 abnormalities were 0.3% in each group. One in the Stribild group had a Grade 3 increase on Day 16 and 
was discontinued after which renal laboratory abnormalities improved to baseline levels. There were no 
Grade 4 values.

Figure 18.  GS-US-236-0102, 0103, 0104: Median (Q1, Q3) of Change from Baseline in Serum Creatine 
(Safety Analysis Set). 
A corresponding modest decrease in median eGFRCG was observed in the Stribild group. Baseline median 
was 114.2 mL/min and the median change from baseline at Week 48 was -13.5 mL/min. Decreases in 
eGFRCG were seen from Week 2 with only minimal additional change thereafter. In the ATV/r+TVD group 
the  baseline  median  was  114.7  mL/min  and  the  median  change  from  baseline  at  Week  48  was  −9.5 
mL/min. Corresponding values in the Atripla group were 114.4 mL/min and −3.0 mL/min.

Figure 19.  GS-US-236-0102, 0103, 0104: Median (Q1, Q3) of Change from Baseline in Estimated 
GFRCG (Safety Analysis Set). 
The results for eGFRMDRD were consistent with those observed for eGFRCG. Consistent with the findings 
in GS-US-216-0121 that COBI appeared to inhibit proximal tubular secretion of creatinine but did not 
alter aGFR the cysGFR showed modest increases in all treatment groups. 
A summary of liver enzyme abnormalities and a summary of liver-related laboratory test results relative 
to the ULN did not suggest an excess risk in the Stribild group vs. the comparators. Elevations of AST or 
ALT to > 3 times the ULN along with elevations in total bilirubin to > 2 times the ULN were reported for a 
lower percentage of subjects in the Stribild group (0.3%, 2 subjects; ATV/r+TVD 4.0%, 14 subjects [ATR 
0 subjects]). One of the 2 in the Stribild group had a history of alcohol abuse and the other had hepatitis 
C infection reported during the study. 
Mean  increases  from  baseline  through  Week  48  in  fasting  total  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol  and  HDL 
cholesterol were significantly lower for the Stribild group vs. Atripla. Mean increases up to Week 48 in 
fasting triglycerides were lower in the Stribild vs. ATV/r+TVD group. 
In GS-US-236-0104 there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median values for TSH, T3 
or T4 in either group during the randomised phase. There were small decreases in median values for IgG 
and IgM in both groups but these remained in the normal range.  
Bone  mineral  density  was  assessed  using  DEXA  scans  in  a  subset  of  subjects  at  selected  sites  in 
GS-US-236-0103. There were numerically smaller mean percentage decreases from baseline in BMD at 
the lumbar spine and hip in the Stribild group compared with the ATV/r+TVD group (changes at Week 48: 
spine -2.63% vs. -3.33%; hip -3.06% vs. -3.88%). 
Safety in special populations 
The pooled Stribild Phase II/III safety analysis showed the following: 
Sex - comparable percentages of male and female subjects in each group reported at least one TEAE. 
Since relatively few females were enrolled no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 116/147 
 
  
  
 
 
Age - comparable percentages of subjects aged < 40 or ≥ 40 years of age in each group reported at least 
one TEAE.  
Race - comparable percentages of white and non-white subjects in each group reported at least one TEAE. 
No differences between white and non-white subjects were apparent in the pattern of TEAEs reported. 
Co-infection with HBV or HCV – very few HIV-1 infected subjects were co-infected with HBV (1.8%, 26 
subjects) or HCV (4.1%, 60 subjects). The hepatic adverse reaction profile in subjects co-infected 
with HBV or HCV who received Stribild was consistent with underlying hepatitis infection. As expected 
in this subject population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general 
HIV-1 infected population. 
Renal Impairment - GS-US-216-0124 
TEAEs were reported for 6/13 with severe renal impairment and 6/11 matched controls but only increased 
blood creatinine (2/13 with pre-existing impairment) was reported in more than one subject. All AEs were 
Grade 1 (mild) and no subject discontinued due to a TEAE.  
Hepatic Impairment - GS-US-183-0133 
Five of 10 controls and 4/10 with moderate hepatic impairment experienced a treatment-emergent AE 
during the study but only headache (in 2) occurred in > 1 subject. All TEAEs were assessed as Grade 1 or 
2  in  severity.  Three  with  impairment  had  Grade  2  laboratory  abnormalities  and  three  had  Grade  3 
treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities but none was reported as a TEAE. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
In the original MAA, the frequencies of discontinuation due to AEs were Stribild 3.7% (26), ATR 5.1% (18) 
and  ATV/r+TVD  5.1%  (18).  By  the  time  of  the  safety  update  the  rates  were  4.6%,  6.8%  and  5.9%, 
respectively. Study drug discontinuation due to renal AEs increased from 6 to 10 subjects in the Stribild 
group and from 1 to 2 subjects in the ATV/r+TVD group. No individual AE that resulted in study drug 
discontinuation  was  reported  in  more  than  1%  of  subjects  in  the  Stribild  group.  In  the  ATR  group, 
depression resulted in study drug discontinuation for 1.1% (4 subjects) while in the ATV/r+TVD group 
1.1% (4 subjects) discontinued due to ocular icterus and the same number due to nausea. Most of the AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall the rates of TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs in the Phase III studies were mostly comparable or 
lower for Stribild vs. either comparative regimen, except in certain cases as described below. 
EVG and Stribild data suggest a particular association with diarrhoea, including Grades 2-4, and also with 
nausea. For example, rates were higher for EVG vs. RAL in study GS-US-183-0145 and higher for Stribild 
vs. Atripla (although not vs. ATV/rtv+TVD). Rates of vomiting were generally comparable although 
addition of Stribild to oral contraceptive in the DDI study was associated with increases in rates of 
vomiting as well as nausea. 
In the comparison with ATV/r+TVD the Stribild was associated with slightly higher rates of abnormal 
dreams, insomnia, depression and headache. Headache was more common with Stribild than with Atripla.  
Renal effects 
Renal effects driven by tenofovir were thoroughly discussed and further analyses/data were requested to 
the applicant as described below. 
Initially, the data of most concern regarding renal injury came from GS-US-236-0102 in which there were 
5 Stribild subjects with renal events of interest including four reported to have renal failure (one was 
Grade 3; two discontinued) and one subject with Grade 3 Fanconi syndrome (discontinued). Four of the 
five (including the case of Fanconi syndrome) had evidence of proximal renal tubular injury. There were 
three other subjects with increased creatinine in the Stribild group in this study (two discontinued) and all 
three had evidence of proximal renal tubular injury. 
During the procedure: 
•  Updated data from the two STB Phase 3 studies showed that 12 subjects had a renal AE of interest 
including 11 who received STB (1.6%) and one who received ATR (0.3%) but none in the ATV/r+TVD 
group. The renal AEs of interest in SBD subjects were renal failure (8 subjects), acute renal failure (2 
subjects) and Fanconi syndrome acquired (1 subject).  
• 
• 
• 
In addition, the safety update clarified that in the two Phase 3 studies there were 16 STB subjects 
(2.3%) who had a renal SAE, discontinued study drug due a renal AE and/or had a pre-specified renal 
AE of interest. These 16 include the 11 mentioned above. One subject (0.3%; as above) in the ATR 
group had a pre-specified renal AE of interest and two subjects (0.6%) in the ATV/r+TVD group 
discontinued study drug due to renal AEs but did not have a renal AE of interest.  
For 4/16 subjects (0.6% of STB Phase 3 safety population) the renal AEs and laboratory findings were 
consistent with the applicant’s definition of PRT. Two had eGFR < 70 mL/min at screening or baseline. 
Each of these subjects discontinued study drug due to renal AEs. For the other 12/16 subjects the 
findings did not meet the applicant’s definition of PRT but 6 did have renal failure, decrease in GFR 
and/or increase in serum creatinine that was accompanied by proteinuria.  
The summary of laboratory findings reflected the effect of COBI on serum creatinine but almost all 
cases in the STB group were Grade 1 and there was no excess of higher grade increases.  
•  At Week 48 treatment-emergent proteinuria was reported for 38.6% STB, 24.1% ATV/r+TVD and 
28.8% ATR subjects. Rates at Week 96 were STB 46.2%, ATV/r+TVD 36.6% and ATR 37.6%. 
However, the incremental incidence of treatment-emergent proteinuria (new onset or worsening 
grading relative to baseline) from Week 48 to Week 96 in the STB group was 7.6% vs. ATV/r+TVD 
12.5% and ATR 8.8%. In addition, the cumulative rates of confirmed increases in proteinuria through 
Week 96 (i.e. observed at 2 consecutive visits) were similar between groups (STB 11.8%; ATV/r+TVD 
10.4%; ATR 7.7%).  
• 
There was no overall excess of hypophosphataemia or glycosuria for STB vs. the comparators. 
Further updates showed the following:  
• 
The  applicant  searched  the  database  for  any  possible  additional  cases  of  PRT  by  applying  slightly 
different (more inclusive) criteria and did not identify further cases vs. those reported above.  
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 119/147 
 
  
  
 
•  On  the  basis  of  the  tabulation  of  confirmed  abnormalities,  the  rates  were  not  higher  for  STB  vs. 
ATV/r+TVD. These laboratory data for confirmed abnormalities contrasts with the AE data reported 
above, which clearly showed an excess of STB subjects who had a renal SAE, discontinued study drug 
due a renal AE and/or had a pre-specified renal AE of interest in these double-blind studies.    
•  Rates for confirmed increases in serum creatinine were STB 4.1%, ATV/r+TVD 3.1% and ATR 2.6%. 
Rates  for  confirmed proteinuria  that  persisted  for more  than  2  consecutive  visits  were  STB  5.1%, 
ATV/r+TVD 3.7% and ATR 1.7%. 
• 
• 
The assessment of reversibility of changes in renal parameters refers mainly to 4 subjects with PRT 
who discontinued STB in GS-US-236-0102. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects with evidence 
of proximal tubulopathy improved without clinical consequence upon discontinuation of Stribild, but 
did not completely resolve in all subjects.  
In  the  STB  safety  update  it  was  reported  that  study  drug  discontinuation  due  to  renal  TEAEs  had 
increased from 6 to 10 subjects in the STB group and from 1 to 2 subjects in the ATV/r+TVD group 
with no change in the ATV/co group.  
The  CHMP  requested  the  study  GS-US-236-0130  to  examine  the  effect  of  5  treatments  (COBI,  TDF, 
COBI+TDF,  Stribild  and  placebo  when  given  once  daily  for  30  days  followed  for  a  further  30  days  to 
document the reversibility of any effects observed. Day 60 data from this study showed that STB had the 
greatest  effect  on  aGFR  and  the  follow-up  data  indicate  that  the  90%  CI  around  the  comparison  vs. 
placebo did not span 100% after 30 days off treatment. The comparisons within treatments for change in 
renal plasma flow from baseline point to the most marked effect in the COBI + TDF and the STB groups. 
The reason for the apparent greater effect of STB is not clear. Given the variability observed in aGFR and 
renal plasma flow it is not impossible that the observations could have arisen by chance in this parallel 
group study. Also, there is no known reason why STB might have a greater effect on aGFR than TDF + 
COBI.  
Currently there is no known mechanism by which COBI may have a causative role in PRT. Non-clinical 
data suggest that FTC, COBI and EVG do not affect the cytotoxicity of TFV in renal proximal tubule cells 
and that COBI has no effect on TFV accumulation in isolated renal cortical tissue.  In-vitro experiments 
were completed in cultured primary human renal proximal tubule cells (RPTECs) to assess the cytotoxicity 
of  TFV  alone  and  in  the  presence  of  STB  components.  The  results  generated  with  cells  from  two 
independent donors indicated low cytotoxicity of TFV (CC50 > 4,000 μM) that was not affected by COBI, 
EVG,  or  FTC  at  pharmacologically  relevant  concentrations.  Since  it  is  known  that  RPTECs  may 
down-regulate some of the active renal transport functions due to de-differentiation process triggered by 
their in vitro culturing, the applicant has also initiated studies in HEK-293 cells co-transfected with OAT1 
and  MRP4,  the  two  key  transporters  responsible  for  the  active  tubular  secretion  of  TFV.  Preliminary 
experiments confirmed the functionality of both transporters following co-transfection and the applicant 
will proceed to optimize cytotoxicity measurement in the HEK-293 cell culture model. The studies will 
continue with the assessment of the effect of individual STB components on the cytotoxicity of TFV (see 
additional pharmacovigilance activities). 
From  the  above  it  can  be  concluded  that  there  are  currently  inadequate  data  to  determine  whether 
co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal 
adverse reactions compared with regimens that include tenofovir disoproxil fumarate without cobicistat. 
The CHMP requested a SAG consultation to have the views of additional experts on this issue (see below). 
Following consideration of the SAG recommendations, the CHMP concluded that the renal effects of STB 
can be addressed via adequate advice in the SmPC that will allow early identification of patients at risk of 
developing STB-related renal toxicity. Therefore, the SmPC was amended as follows: 
• 
• 
Inclusion of a recommendation not to institute TDF-containing regimens in subjects who have 
been discontinued from Stribild due to renal toxicity (section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Inclusion of a recommendation that patients with any known risk factors for renal impairment and 
any who develop a confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥  26.5 µmmol/l should receive more 
intensive monitoring of renal safety (section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 120/147 
 
  
  
• 
Inclusion of a recommendation that not only eGFR but also the presence of glycosuria and/or 
proteinuria should be documented before commencing Stribild (section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Furthermore,  a  paragraph  was  introduced  recommending  that  Stribild  is  not  initiated  in  patients  with 
creatinine clearance < 90 mL/min unless, after review of the available treatment options, it is considered 
that Stribild is the preferred treatment for the individual patient.  Additionally, a recommendation was 
introduced  concerning  the  discontinuation  of  Stribild  in  patients  with  creatinine  clearance  that  falls 
to < 70 mL/min while on treatment unless it is considered that the potential benefit of this combination of 
antiretroviral agents for the individual patient outweighs the possible risks of continuing with therapy 
(sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPc). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing when 
individual  components  used  with  other  antiretrovirals  have  been  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics. 
The  RMP  was  updated  to  include  the  request  for  further  studies  (see  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities) as recommended by the additional expert consultation. 
Additional expert consultation 
During a meeting of the HIV / viral diseases SAG on 6 February 2013 experts were convened to address 
questions raised by the CHMP related to renal toxicity of Stribild. 
Based on the data available at present, there was a consensus from the group that there was no firm 
evidence pointing to an increased risk of PRT with Stribild or with COBI + TDF versus other 
TDF-containing products. More extensive and longer term exposure to Striblid and or COBI associated to 
TDF should be requested in the ‘real life situation’ to better assess characteristics and risk factors for renal 
toxicity. 
Given the uncertainties related to the results of study 0130 (in healthy subjects) the experts 
recommended by consensus that the applicant should be requested to conduct a comparative study in 
HIV-infected subjects to further evaluate the possible relevance of the data generated by study 130 and 
suggested a study design for CHMP’s consideration. 
In addition, some experts expressed interest in understanding the mechanism of the potential renal effect 
of Stribild and TDF + COBI on aGFR and encouraged the applicant to investigate it. 
Given uncertainties on reversibility of renal effects, the experts recommended the applicant gather 
additional information on this point. 
Overall the SAG considers the risks can be managed via appropriate advice in the SmPC and 
recommended the inclusion of further comments on the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The safety conclusions are further discussed in the context of the overall benefit-risk 
balance. 
In order to further characterise the safety profile of STB, the following measures will be performed by the 
applicant, as detailed in the Risk Management Plan. 
•  Drug utilization study for STB (information on the effectiveness of the renal risk minimization 
measures for STB, factors potentially associated with the risk of proximal renal tubulopathy, and the 
reversibility of proximal renal tubulopathy) (Protocol synopsis by May 2013)

Statements in Section 4.2 of STB SmPC: 
Renal impairment: Stribild should not be initiated in patients with creatinine 
clearance below 70 mL/min (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). See section 4.4 
regarding initiation of Stribild in patients with creatinine clearance below 90 
mL/min.   
Stribild should be discontinued if creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL/min 
during treatment with Stribild as dose interval adjustment is required for 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and this cannot be achieved 
with the fixed-dose combination tablet (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). See section 
4.4 regarding patients with creatinine clearance that falls below 70 mL/min 
while on treatment with Stribild. 
Contraindication in Section 4.3 of STB SmPC: 
Patients who have previously discontinued treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate due to renal toxicity, with or without reversal of the effects 
post-discontinuation. 
Warnings in Section 4.4 of STB SmPC: 
Effects on renal function: Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by 
the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular 
secretion.  Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, 
hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) 
have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see section 
4.8). 
There are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of 
renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that include tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate without cobicistat.

Proposed Risk Minimization Activities (Routine and Additional) 
Patients who have previously discontinued treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate due to renal toxicity, with or without reversal of the effects 
post-discontinuation, should not be treated with Stribild (see section 4.3). 
Before initiating treatment with Stribild: Creatinine clearance should be 
calculated and urine glucose and urine protein should be determined in all 
patients. Stribild should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance < 
70 mL/min. It is recommended that Stribild is not initiated in patients with 
creatinine clearance < 90 mL/min unless, after review of the available 
treatment options, it is considered that Stribild is the preferred treatment for 
the individual patient.  
During treatment with Stribild: Creatinine clearance, serum phosphate, urine 
glucose and urine protein should be monitored every four weeks during the first 
year and then every three months during Stribild therapy.  In patients at risk for 
renal impairment consideration should be given to more frequent monitoring of 
renal function. 
Cobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest 
increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance (see 
section 4.8). Patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine 
of greater than 26.5 µmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) from baseline should be closely 
monitored for renal safety. 
If serum phosphate is < 0.48 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or creatinine clearance is 
decreased to < 70 mL/min renal function should be re-evaluated within one 
week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine 
glucose concentrations (see section 4.8). It is recommended that Stribild is 
discontinued in patients with creatinine clearance that falls to < 70 mL/min 
while on treatment unless it is considered that the potential benefit of this 
combination of antiretroviral agents for the individual patient outweighs the 
possible risks of continuing with therapy.   
Stribild should be discontinued in patients with confirmed creatinine clearance 
that falls to < 50 mL/min (since the required dose interval adjustments are not 
possible using this fixed dose combination tablet) or with decreases in serum 
phosphate to < 0.32 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Concomitant use with nephrotoxic medicinal products: Use of Stribild should be 
avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic medicinal product, e.g 
aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine,

vancomycin, cidofovir or interlekin-2 (also called aldesleukin) (see section 4.5).  
If concomitant use of Stribild and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal 
function must be monitored weekly. 
Bone effects: Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may 
be associated with proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8).  If bone 
abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. 
Statements in Section 4.5 of the STB SmPC: 
Renally eliminated medicinal products: Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are 
primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of Stribild with medicinal 
products that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. 
cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or 
the co-administered medicinal products. 
Use of Stribild should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic 
medicinal product.  Some examples include, but are not limited to, 
aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, 
vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (also called aldesleukin). 
Statements and Adverse Reactions in Section 4.8 of the STB SmPC: 
Summary of the safety profile 
In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, rare events of renal 
impairment, renal failure and proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi 
syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing 
to fractures) have been reported.  Monitoring of renal function is recommended 
for patients receiving Stribild (see section 4.4).

1 This adverse reaction was not observed in the Phase 3 clinical studies for 
Stribild but identified from clinical studies or post marketing experience for 
emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when used with other 
antiretrovirals. 
3 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal 
tubulopathy. It is not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate in the absence of this condition. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal impairment: In the clinical studies of Stribild over 48 weeks (n = 701), 6 
(0.9%) subjects in the Stribild group and 1 (0.3%) subject in the 
ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) plus fixed-dose combination of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) group discontinued 
study drug due to a renal adverse reaction.  The types of renal adverse 
reactions seen with Stribild were consistent with previous experience with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Four (0.6%) of the subjects who received Stribild 
developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular 
dysfunction leading to discontinuation of Stribild.  Two of the four subjects had 
renal impairment (i.e. estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min) at 
baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects with evidence of proximal 
tubulopathy improved without clinical consequence upon discontinuation of 
Stribild, but did not completely resolve in all subjects (see section 4.4). 
The cobicistat component of Stribild has been shown to decrease estimated 
creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without 
affecting renal glomerular function.  In studies GS-US-236-0102 and 
GS-US-236-0103, decreases in estimated creatinine clearance occurred early in 
treatment with Stribild, after which they stabilised.  The mean change in 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Cockcroft-Gault method after 48 
weeks of treatment was -13.9 ± 14.9 mL/min for Stribild, -1.6 ± 16.5 mL/min 
for EFV/FTC/TDF, and -9.3 ± 15.8 mL/min for ATV/r+FTC/TDF.

Bone effects: In the Phase 3 study GS-US-236-0103, mean percentage 
decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to week 48 in the 
Stribild group (n = 54) were comparable to the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir 
(ATV/r) plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) group (n = 
66) at the lumbar spine (-2.6% versus -3.3%, respectively) and at the hip 
(-3.1% versus -3.9%, respectively).  In the Phase 3 studies GS-US-236-0102 
and GS-US-236-0103, bone fractures occurred in 9 subjects (1.3%) in the 
Stribild group, 6 subjects (1.7%) in the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) group, and 6 subjects (1.7%) in the 
ATV/r+FTC/TDF  group.  
In a 144-week controlled clinical study that compared tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in 
antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases in BMD of the hip and spine were 
observed in both treatment groups.  Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in 
bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate treatment group at 144 weeks.  Decreases in BMD of hip 
were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks.  However, there was no 
increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities 
over 144 weeks. 
Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated 
with proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8).  If bone abnormalities are 
suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained.

Boxed warning in Section 4.4 of STB SmPC: 
Lactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatic steatosis, has 
been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues.  Early symptoms 
(symptomatic hyperlactataemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, 
vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight 
loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/or deep breathing) or neurological 
symptoms (including motor weakness).  Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and 
may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure or renal failure.  Lactic acidosis 
generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment. 
Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued in the setting of 
symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive 
hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels. 
Caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any 
patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other 
known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain 
medicinal products and alcohol).  Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and 
treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk. 
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely.

Precautionary statements in Section 4.4 of STB SmPC: 
Lipodystrophy: CART has been associated with the redistribution of body fat 
(lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.  The long-term consequences of these events 
are currently unknown.  Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.  A 
connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors and 
lipoatrophy and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been 
hypothesised.  A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with 
individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer 
duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.  
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat 
redistribution.  Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting 
serum lipids and blood glucose.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically 
appropriate (see section 4.8). 
Tenofovir is structurally related to nucleoside analogues hence the risk of 
lipodystrophy cannot be excluded.  However, 144-week clinical data from 
antiretroviral-naïve patients indicate that the risk of lipodystrophy was lower 
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate than with stavudine when administered with 
lamivudine and efavirenz.

cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in newborns/infants.  
Therefore Stribild should not be used during breast-feeding. 
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that HIV 
infected women do not breast-feed their infants under any circumstances.

Statements in Section 4.2 of STB SmPC: 
Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment of Stribild is required in patients with 
mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic 
impairment. Stribild has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Therefore, Stribild is not recommended for 
use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Statements in Section 4.4 of STB SmPC: 
Liver disease: The safety and efficacy of Stribild have not been established in 
patients with significant underlying liver disorders.  The pharmacokinetics of 
emtricitabine have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.  The 
pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, cobicistat and tenofovir have been studied in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Stribild has not been studied in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). No dose 
adjustment of Stribild is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or 
moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, 
have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART) and should be monitored according to standard 
practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.

Co-administration of Stribild with medicinal products that are primarily 
metabolised by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3 may result in increased plasma concentrations of those products, 
which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions 
(see Concomitant use contraindicated and section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Stribild with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may 
decrease the clearance of cobicistat, resulting in increased cobicistat plasma 
concentrations. 
Elvitegravir is a modest inducer and may have the potential to induce CYP2C9 
and/or inducible UGT enzymes; as such it may decrease the plasma 
concentration of substrates of these enzymes. 
Concomitant use contraindicated: Co-administration of Stribild and some 
medicinal products that induce CYP3A such as St. John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin may 
result in significantly decreased cobicistat and elvitegravir plasma 
concentrations, which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development 
of resistance (see section 4.3).

Co-administration of Stribild 
and rifabutin is not 
recommended.  If the 
combination is needed, the 
recommended dose of 
rifabutin is 150 mg 3 times 
per week on set days (for 
example 
Monday-Wednesday-Friday). 
Increased monitoring for 
rifabutin-associated adverse 
reactions including 
neutropenia and uveitis is 
warranted due to an 
expected increase in 
exposure to 
desacetyl-rifabutin.  Further 
dose reduction of rifabutin 
has not been studied.  It 
should be kept in mind that a 
twice weekly dose of 150 mg 
may not provide an optimal 
exposure to rifabutin thus 
leading to a risk of rifamycin 
resistance and a treatment 
failure. 
Co-administration with 
Stribild is not recommended.

Pharmacovigilance plans 
The below pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance are needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns: 
Table 81.  Pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the routine pharmacovigilance 
Description 
PAM 1: PK study of EVG in subjects with UGT1A1*28/*28 genotype administered 
STB (information on EVG exposure in patients with UGT1A1 polymorphism 
associated with decreased activity of UGT1A1) (Long-term safety) 
PAM 2: Drug utilization study for STB (information on the effectiveness of the renal 
risk minimization measures for STB, factors potentially associated with the risk of 
proximal renal tubulopathy, and the reversibility of proximal renal tubulopathy). 
As part of this study to specifically seek out data in subjects with any of HBV or HCV 
co-infection, subjects of African heritage, low CD4 counts at ARV initiation, use of 
concomitant medications with nephrotoxic potential and any other factors that might 
potentially affect the risk of developing PRT. 
Where available from patient records, information on specific markers of tubular 
damage (e.g. urinary alpha- and/or beta-microglobulin, neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL]) and markers of glomerular damage (e.g. 
microalbuminuria) will be reported. 
(Renal toxicity) 
PAM 3: Clinical study of STB, a TDF-containing regimen without COBI, and a regimen 
without TDF or COBI in HIV-1 infected ARV treatment-naive patients to be conducted 
after an assessment of feasibility, and upon agreement on the study design with the 
CHMP (information on renal function and markers of renal tubular function) 
(Renal toxicity) 
PAM 4: Conduct of further studies to investigate the possible mechanism(s) that 
could lead to an additive or synergistic toxic effect of COBI + TDF on renal tubular 
function and/or a decrease in the aGFR during Stribild therapy: In vitro studies of the 
individual STB components on the cytotoxicity of TFV in HEK-293 cells co-transfected 
with OAT1 and MRP4 
PAM 5: In vitro studies to assess the potential for EVG to inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3 
and UGT2B7 (Drug-drug interactions) 
PAM 6: Clinical study of STB in HIV-1 infected women (GS-US-236-0128) 
(information on BMD in HIV-1 infected women from a subset of subjects from Study 
GS US 236 0128 in which DEXA scans will be performed with up to 96 weeks of STB

Risk minimisation measures 
The CHMP considers that the following additional risk minimisation measures are necessary for the safe 
and effective use of the product: 
•  Educational material for healthcare professionals to address the risk of renal toxicity 
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The beneficial virological effects of Stribild are clearly demonstrated in two pivotal phase III randomized 
trials, comparing Stribild to Atripla and to the combination of ATZ/rtv plus Truvada, in HIV-1 infected 
adults without known mutations associated with resistance to the 3 antiretrovirals in Stribild. Both studies 
demonstrated non-inferiority of Stribild compared to the other regimens; at 48 weeks follow-up, the 
overall response rate (< 50 copies/mL) was 87.5% and 84.1% for Stribild and Atripla respectively (study 
-102) and 89.5% and 86.8% for Stribild and ATZ/rtv plus Truvada respectively (study -103). 
Stribild exerts comparable antiviral effects, with associated increments in CD4 counts, vs. each of Atripla 
and ATV/rtv+TVD. While Atripla is not approved in the EU for use from the outset in ARV-naïve subjects 
and while ATV/rtv+TVD is not a favoured primary regimen, the actual virological response rates observed 
with Stribild and the comparators in the primary and sensitivity analyses compare very well with many 
other studies in the ARV-naïve. 
Stribild is the first FDC including a INSTI to be taken once a day approved for use in adults. This provides 
a simplified treatment regimen. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
When assessing the possible benefits of the Stribild in ARV-naïve subjects (or in those with virus lacking 
any known RAMs for any of the three anti-HIV agents) the possible implications of initiating a regimen 
that incorporates two NRTIs with an integrase inhibitor must be considered. Since Stribild represents a 
complete treatment regimen, subjects who adhere to the once daily dosing regimen with food are 
automatically adherent to a triple combination regimen. This should also reduce the risk of selecting for 
virus resistant to one or more actives compared to regimens consisting of more than one formulation. 
However, omitting to take Stribild daily leaves the subject with intermittent periods without any anti-HIV 
agent. Results on development of resistance (pointed to co-selection of virus containing IN mutations 
along with resistance to FTC, with or without TFV) may reflect a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance 
to EVG. Therefore, failure of adherence enhances the risk of selecting for virus co-resistant to EVG, FTC 
and TFV, with additional implications for sequential use of RAL and 3TC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 143/147 
 
  
  
 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
There is a known risk of adverse renal effects associated with TDF. The types of renal adverse reactions 
observed with Stribild were consistent with previous experience with tenofovir. However, there are 
currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 
cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens that include 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate without cobicistat. The apparent risk requires a careful appraisal before 
initiating treatment in light of the fact that other therapeutic alternative are available. There is also a need 
for careful monitoring of patients during therapy and detailed recommendations regarding pre- and 
on-treament monitoring of renal function as well as stopping treatment. The SmPC includes this 
information. 
The data also indicate that rates of TEAEs including diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abnormal dreams, 
insomnia and depression may be more frequent with Stribild vs. Atripla or vs. ATV/rtv+TVD.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Estimation of the actual risk of Stribild-associated renal injury and its reversibility after discontinuation 
requires further clinical experience in terms of numbers and duration of exposure. The observed effects of 
Stribild on aGFR and renal plasma flow cannot be dismissed. The additional pharmacovigilance activities 
will allow to collect further data on these aspects. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy of the Stribild must be carefully weighed against the risk of renal injury in ARV-naïve 
subjects. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The beneficial virological effects of Stribild are clearly demonstrated. The CHMP considers that provided 
patients are adequately screened pre-treatment for suitability to receive Stribild and are monitored on 
treatment for any evidence of renal toxicity as reflected in the SmPC the anti-viral efficacy of Stribild 
outweighs the risk of renal injury.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Stribild in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) 
infection in adults aged 18 years and over who are antiretroviral treatment-naïve or are infected with 
HIV 1 without known mutations associated with resistance to the three antiretroviral agents in Stribild 
(see section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1) is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Stribild renal educational brochure, including a creatinine clearance slide ruler. 
The MAH must agree the content and format of the medical educational pack with the national competent 
authority in each Member State prior to its distribution in their territory.  
The Stribild renal educational brochure shall contain the following key safety messages: 
1.  That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV infected patients associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Stribild.  
Assessment report  
EMA/332263/2013 
Page 145/147 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  That patients who have previously discontinued treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate due 
to renal toxicity should not be treated with Stribild. 
3.  That patients should have creatinine clearance calculated and urine glucose and urine protein 
determined prior to initiating Stribild therapy. 
4.  That Stribild should not be initiated in patients with creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min. 
5.  That it is recommended that Stribild is not initiated in patients with creatinine clearance 
< 90 mL/min unless, after review of the available treatment options, it is considered that Stribild 
is the preferred treatment for the individual patient. 
6.  The importance of regular monitoring of creatinine clearance, serum phosphate, urine glucose 
and urine protein during Stribild therapy. 
7.  The recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence of 
additional risk factors for renal impairment. 
8.  That cobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in 
serum creatinine and modest declines in creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular 
function. 
9.  That patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 26.5 
µmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety. 
10. That if serum phosphate is < 0.48 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or creatinine clearance decreases during 
therapy to < 70 mL/min then renal function should be re-evaluated within one week.  
11.  That it is recommended that Stribild is discontinued in patients with creatinine clearance that 
falls to < 70 mL/min while on treatment unless it is considered that the potential benefit of this 
combination of antiretroviral agents for the individual patient outweighs the possible risks of 
continuing with therapy. 
12. That if creatinine clearance is confirmed as < 50 mL/min or serum phosphate decreases to 
< 0.32 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) then Stribild should be discontinued. 
13. That use of Stribild should be avoided with concomitant or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal 
products. If Stribild is used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely 
monitored according to the recommended schedule .

Based on the review of the first periodic safety update 
with the CHMP’s request in the assessment of 
Periodic Safety update Report PSUR 01, in order to 
include safety data related to drug interaction 
between pravastatin and fusidic acid leading to an 
increased risk of rhabdomyolysis; and of section 4.8 
of the SmPC to include the adverse reactions “skin 
rash” and “peripheral polyneuropathy”.  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article

Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
report (PSUR), the CHMP recommended an update of 
section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order to include 
safety data related to drug interaction between pravastatin 
and fusidic acid leading to an increased risk of 
rhabdomyolysis, and inclusion of the adverse reaction “skin 
rash” and “peripheral polyneuropathy”. The Package Leaflet 
was updated accordingly.

This type II variation concerns the update of section 
19/07/2012 
30/08/2012 
SmPC and PL 
Based on the publication of a meta-analysis that HMGCoA 
4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to include a specific wording 
reductase inhibitors (statins) may increase the risk of new 
regarding the risk of new onset of diabetes. The 
amendment follows the publication of a meta-
analysis which reported that therapy with HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors (statins) overall was associated 
with a slightly increased risk for the development of 
new onset diabetes and its assessment by the 
Pharmacovigilance Working Party 
(CMDh/PhVWP/042/2012, January 2012, Rev1 March 
2012). 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
IA/0006 
B.II.b.4.a - Change in the batch size (including batch 
17/08/2012 
n/a 
size ranges) of the finished product - Up to 10-fold 
onset diabetes (NOD) in patients already at risk of 
developing the disease was raised recently. The 
Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) conducted a 
review of this risk based on all available data and 
concluded that, despite a clear positive risk-benefit balance 
as to the reduction of major cardiovascular events, HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of NOD. 
However this risk appears to be predominantly in patients 
already at increased risk of developing diabetes, i.e. 
patients with raised fasting blood glucose at baseline, a 
history of hypertension, raised triglycerides and raised body 
mass index at baseline. An association of statin therapy 
with diabetes mellitus has been agreed and included as a 
class effect in all statins.  
Since Pravafenix contains pravastatin, the wording agreed 
by the PhVWP (Doc.Ref.: CMDh/PhVWP/042/2012, January 
2012, Rev1 March 2012) and relevant for pravastatin is 
implemented for in the Product information of Pravafenix.

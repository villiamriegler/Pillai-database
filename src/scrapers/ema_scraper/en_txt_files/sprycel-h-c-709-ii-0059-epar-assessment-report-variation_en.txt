2.  Scientific discussion 
Problem statement 
The  European  Commission  granted  a  Marketing  Authorization  for  Sprycel  in  November  2006  for  the 
following indications: 
For the treatment of adult patients with: 
newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the 
chronic phase.  
chronic,  accelerated  or  blast  phase  CML  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy  including 
imatinib. 
Ph+  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  and  lymphoid  blast  CML  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to 
prior therapy. 
For the treatment of paediatric patients with: 
newly  diagnosed  Ph+ CML  in  chronic  phase  (Ph+ CML-CP)  or  Ph+ CML-CP  resistant  or  intolerant  to 
prior therapy including imatinib. 
The  scope  of  this  variation  is  the  extension  of  indication  of  dasatinib  in  combination  with 
chemotherapyfor the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. 
Disease or condition 
The  proposed  indication  is  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  in 
combination with chemotherapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
The annual incidence of ALL in childhood is approximately 9 to 10 cases per 100,000, with 3% to 5% 
of  cases  being  Ph+  ALL.  ALL  is  the  most  common  form  of  cancer  during  childhood,  affecting  about 
2500 children annually in Europe [1]. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Paediatric  ALL  is  a  biologically  heterogeneous  cancer  with  multiple  genetically  defined  subtypes.  The 
disease  is  characterized  by  the  accumulation  of  malignant  lymphoblasts  in  the  marrow  or  in  various 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 7/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extramedullary  sites,  frequently  accompanied  by  suppression  of  normal  hematopoiesis.  The  presence 
of the Philadelphia chromosome resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 
22  that  creates  the  BCR-ABL  fusion  protein,  defines a  well-known  subtype  of ALL  which  is  associated 
with a poorer prognosis. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with ALL may present with a variety of hematologic derangements ranging from pancytopenia 
to hyperleukocytosis. The symptoms of ALL develop rapidly and are indicative of a reduced production 
of  functional  blood  cells  and  bone  marrow  metaplasia,  thus  including  fever,  pain,  increased  risk  of 
infections,  increased  tendency  to  bleed  and  signs  indicative  of  anaemia, including  pallor,  tachycardia, 
fatigue, and headache. 
Management 
The  standard  of  care  for  newly-diagnosed  children  and  adolescents  with  Ph+  ALL  varies  somewhat 
among  the  paediatric  cooperative  groups.  Before  the  development  of  ABL  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(TKIs), there was no consensus on the optimal treatment of Ph+ ALL.  
In  EU,  imatinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed 
Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (Ph+  ALL)  integrated  with 
chemotherapy. 
The  survival  rate  among  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL  still lags  behind  most other  cytogenetic  subgroups  in 
paediatric  ALL.  Until  recently,  HSCT  in  first  complete  remission  offered  the best  opportunity  for long-
term EFS for children with Ph+ ALL, with an improvement in disease free survival of up to 65% and OS 
72%.  This  strategy  is  limited  by  the  availability  of  a  suitably  matched  donor,  by  the  risk  of  post-
transplant–related  morbidity  and  mortality  and  by  relapses  after  HSCT,  particularly  in  those  who  are 
MRD positive prior to transplantation. Paediatric patients with no suitable donor for HSCT have an even 
more critical unmet need for disease management. 
About the product 
Dasatinib  inhibits  the  activity  of  the  BCR  ABL  kinase  and  SRC  family  kinases  along  with  a  number  of 
other selected oncogenic kinases including c KIT, ephrin (EPH) receptor kinases, and PDGFβ receptor. 
Dasatinib is a potent, subnanomolar inhibitor of the BCR ABL kinase with potency at concentration of 
0.6  0.8  nM.  It  binds  to  both  the  inactive  and  active  conformations  of  the  BCR  ABL  enzyme  (SmPC, 
section 5.1). 
In  vitro,  dasatinib  is  active  in  leukaemic  cell  lines  representing  variants  of  imatinib  sensitive  and 
resistant  disease.  These  non-clinical  studies  show  that  dasatinib  can  overcome  imatinib  resistance 
resulting  from  BCR  ABL  overexpression,  BCR  ABL  kinase  domain  mutations,  activation  of  alternate 
signalling  pathways  involving  the  SRC  family  kinases  (LYN,  HCK),  and  multidrug  resistance  gene 
overexpression.  Additionally,  dasatinib  inhibits  SRC  family  kinases  at  subnanomolar  concentrations 
(SmPC, section 5.1). 
In vivo, in separate experiments using murine models of CML, dasatinib prevented the progression of 
chronic  CML  to  blast  phase  and  prolonged  the  survival  of  mice  bearing  patient  derived  CML  cell  lines 
grown at various sites, including the central nervous system (SmPC, section 5.1).

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication:  
SPRYCEL  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  in 
combination with chemotherapy. 
The CHMP adopted this indication without changes. 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.2.  Discussion and Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The justification provided by the MAH for not performing environmental risk assessment studies was 
considered acceptable. The addition of the paediatric population to the currently approved indications 
is not expected to significantly increase the use of dasatinib on the EU market. Therefore, it is unlikely 
that dasatinib will pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

There  are  two  dasatinib  formulations  for  use  in  paediatric  patients:  (1)  film-coated  tablets  and  (2) 
powder for oral suspension (PFOS) for use in paediatric patients who cannot swallow or choose not to 
take  the  tablets.  Dasatinib  film-coated  tablets  are  available  in  strengths  of  20,  50,  70,  80,  100,  and 
140 mg and dasatinib PFOS is a powdered drug product, which, when constituted with water, provides 
a suspension at a dasatinib concentration of 10 mg/mL.  
A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed and used to describe the clinical 
behaviours (BE, food effect, and particle size effect) of dasatinib PFOS and tablet in paediatric patients. 
Body surface area (BSA)-normalized dosing was evaluated in paediatric clinical trials. Additionally, WT-
tiered dosing was evaluated using PPK model-based simulations. 
Dose-response  (D-R)  and  exposure-response  (E-R)  relationships  were  characterized  in  paediatric 
patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CP-CML from the Phase 2 study CA180226.  
Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib tablet in paediatric patients 
Non-compartmental  analysis  (NCA)  PK  analysis  of  dasatinib  tablet  formulation  was  performed  using 
data collected in 72 paediatric subjects age ≥ 1 year old with relapsed or refractory leukemia or solid 
tumors  (CA180018  and  CA180038).  The  investigated  once-daily  (QD)  and  twice-daily  (BID)  doses 
ranged  from  60  to  120  mg/m2  and  50  to  110  mg/m2,  respectively.  The  dasatinib  tablet  was  rapidly 
absorbed  with  a  mean  time  of  maximum  observed  concentration  (Tmax)  between  0.5  and  6  hours. 
Mean half-life (T-HALF) ranged from 2 to 5 hours across all dose levels and age groups. Similar to that 
observed  in  adults,  high  inter-subject  variability  was  observed  in  the  PK  parameters  of  paediatric 
subjects,  with  coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  of  maximum  concentration  (Cmax)  and  area  under  the 
concentration-time  curve  from  time  zero  to  infinity  (AUC[INF])  greater  than  50%  for  the  60-mg/m2 
tablet. Dasatinib PK showed dose proportionality with a dose-related increase in exposure observed in 
this  paediatric  population.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  dasatinib  PK  between  children  and 
adolescents.  The  geometric  means  of  dose-normalized  (DN)  dasatinib  Cmax,  area  under  the 
concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC[0-T]), and 
AUC(INF) were similar between children and adolescents across dose levels. 
Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib powder for oral suspension in adult and paediatric patients 
Dasatinib  PFOS  was  developed  as  an  age-appropriate  formulation  for  paediatric  patients  who  cannot 
swallow  the  tablet  formulation.  Study  CA180352  compared  the  PK  of  dasatinib  PFOS  to  the  intact 
tablet formulation in 77 healthy adult subjects. Results showed that the exposure (by AUC[INF]) with 
PFOS was approximately 19% less than that obtained with intact tablets in healthy adults treated with 
a dose of 60 mg/m2. On the basis of these results, a PFOS dose of 72 mg/m2 was selected to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, and PK of dasatinib in paediatric patients age ≥ 1 year old with newly diagnosed 
CP-CML (Cohort 3b of CA180226). This dose was selected to match exposure for the selected Phase 2 
dose of intact tablet at 60 mg/m2. 
The  concentration  data  from  the  PFOS  cohort  of  Study  CA180226  (Cohort  3)  was  pooled  with  data 
from  the  Phase  1  studies  for  a  population  pharmacokinetic  (PPK)  analysis  (694  observed 
concentrations  from  104  paediatric  subjects).  The  analysis  characterized  the  PK  of  dasatinib  in 
paediatric subjects by a linear 2-compartment model with first-order absorption, similar to that of the 
PK model in adult CML subjects. Both the apparent clearance (CL/F) and central volume of distribution 
(VC/F) increased with increasing body weight (WT) in paediatric subjects. The analysis showed that the 
bioavailability of PFOS was approximately 40% lower than that of tablet in paediatric patients, and as a 
result of the low bioavailability, the exposure of PFOS (as measured by time-averaged concentration at 
steady state [Cavgss]) at 72 mg/m2 was approximately 30% lower than that of the tablet at 60 mg/m2 
in paediatric subjects newly diagnosed with CP-CML.

Drug-Drug Interactions 
Dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans, and CYP3A4 plays a major role in its metabolism. 
When  a  single  morning  dose  of  dasatinib  was  administered  in  adults  following  8  days  of  continuous 
evening administration of 600 mg of rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, the  mean Cmax and AUC of 
dasatinib were decreased by 81% and 82%, respectively. Substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity may 
decrease metabolism and increase concentrations of dasatinib. A 20-mg dasatinib QD co-administered 
with 200 mg of ketoconazole twice daily in adults increased the dasatinib Cmax and AUC by four- and 
five-fold, respectively.  
Dasatinib is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor and has little potential to induce CYP3A4. Single-dose data from a 
study  in  adults  indicate  that  the  mean  Cmax  and  AUC  of  simvastatin,  a  CYP3A4  substrate,  were 
increased  by  37%  and  20%,  respectively,  when  simvastatin  was  administered  in  combination  with  a 
single 100-mg dose of dasatinib.  
The list of co-administered chemotherapy agents is provided in Table 5 together with their categories 
as CYP3A4 substrate, inducer or inhibitor.

Dasatinib exposure comparison in paediatric patients by disease status (AP/BP-CML/ALL/AML and  CP-
CML) 
Dasatinib  plasma  concentration  data  were  collected  in  paediatric  leukaemia  patients  in  the  Phase  1 
Study  CA180018.  CA180018  was  an  open-label,  dose-escalation  (3+3  design,  intra-subject  dose 
escalation) study in children and adolescents/adults, ≥ 1 to < 21 years of age, who were treated with 
dasatinib  orally  60,  80,  100  and  120  mg/m2  QD  until  refractory  disease  progression,  intolerable 
toxicity, or patient/physician preference. 
Plasma PK data were available for 53 subjects, including 15 with CP-CML, 3 with advanced phases CML 
(2 in accelerated phase and 1 in lymphoid blast phase), 12 with Ph+ ALL, and 23 with Ph- ALL or AML.

To support bridging of the dose recommendation from paediatric CP-CML to Ph+  ALL, an assessment 
was done by comparing the exposure by disease status (ie, CP-CML vs Ph+ ALL).  
The  exposure  metrics  (Cavg,  Cmin  and  Cmax)  were  normalized  by  the  mg/m2  dose  for  comparison. 
Body  weight  was  shown  to  have  effect  on  dasatinib  PK  in  paediatric  patients.  Normalization  was 
performed  using  the  nominal  mg/m2  dose  in  order  to  account  for  potential  difference  of  body  size 
between the 2 disease groups (CP-CML and advanced phases CML/Ph+ ALL).  
The results are presented in Figure 1.

Dose Selection and Justification in Paediatric Subjects with Ph+ ALL 
The recommended dose for paediatric patients with Ph+ ALL is identical to the dose recommended for 
CP-CML, ie, a WT-tiered dosing recommended as presented in Table 6.

Table 6 Comparability of Predicted Dasatinib Exposure at Recommended WT-Tiered Doses to 
Tablet 60 mg/m2 
•  Dose selection and justification for tablet 
Dasatinib 60-mg/m2 tablet was tested in the Phase 2 study CA180372 in paediatric Ph+ ALL subjects. 
The study was designed when the optimal schedule was being explored in adults, which showed that 
the QD schedule had similar overall efficacy and improved safety as compared with the BID schedule in 
adults. Once-daily dosing in the paediatric population was, therefore, selected over the BID dosing 
schedule. 
In a Phase 1 dose-escalation study (CA180018) of dasatinib in children and adolescents with relapsed 
or refractory leukemia, treatment responses were seen in Ph+ patients who received single-agent 
dasatinib 60 or 80 mg/m2. No maximum tolerated dose was identified up to doses of 120 mg/m2 daily. 
Rates of both major cytogenic response (MCyR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) among 17 
paediatric patients with advanced phase CML/Ph+ ALL (stratum 2/3) were 50% and 77.7% with 60 
mg/m2 and 80 mg/ m2 QD, respectively. The proportion of subjects in this stratum with drug-related 
SAEs was 25% and 33% in the 60 and 80 mg/m2 cohorts, respectively. Based on these data and 
preliminary COG AALL0622 data which showed that 60 mg/m2 QD can be safely combined with 
chemotherapy, the 60 mg/m2 QD dose was selected for further testing in the Phase 2 study CA180372. 
The benefit-risk profile at the tablet dose of 60 mg/m2 in paediatric Ph+ ALL was further characterized 
in the Phase 2 study CA180372. The 3-year binomial EFS rate with dasatinib plus chemotherapy was 
66.0% (90% CI: 57.7, 73.7), which was superior compared to chemotherapy alone in AIEOP-BFM 
2000 (49.2% [90% CI: 38.0, 60.4]), and non-inferior (90% CI: -3.3, 17.2) compared to continuous 
imatinib plus chemotherapy in the Amended EsPhALL Trial (59.1% [90% CI: 51.8, 66.2]). The safety 
profile of dasatinib treatment in paediatric subjects with treatment-naive Ph+ ALL indicated that daily 
dasatinib dosing was well-tolerated and safe. No new safety signals were observed. The most common 
dasatinib-related AEs were anemia (28.3%), neutropenia (24.5%), and febrile neutropenia (23.6%), 
which were consistent with the known safety profile of dasatinib. 
The tablet is available in the strength of 20, 50, 70, 80 and 100 mg. A WT-tiered dosing in paediatric 
patients was selected to produce similar summary steady-state exposures to target exposures of the

60-mg/m2 tablet QD. The dosing was evaluated by simulating dasatinib exposures for each WT tier 
using the developed paediatric PPK model (5-120 kg with every 5-kg increment) under various dosing 
scenarios, taking into account the available tablet dosing strengths. The difference of exposure 
measures produced by the selected WT-tiered dosing was less than 20% from the reference exposure 
for all WT tiers.  
The WT-tiered dosing is also recommended for paediatric Ph+ ALL based on the same set of 
simulations, which is supported by the following: 
1) There were no marked disease-related differences in the PK parameters of dasatinib, both in adults 
and in paediatrics. Figure 3 shows the distribution of PPK model estimated dasatinib clearance by 
paediatric disease status.  
Figure 3 PPK model-estimated individual clearance, by disease status 
2) The same reference dose of tablet 60 mg/m2 has been showed in Study CA180226 to be safe and 
efficacious in paediatric CP-CML patients, as well as in Study CA180372 with a favorable benefit-risk 
profile when co-administered with chemotherapy in paediatric Ph+ ALL patients. 
3) Dasatinib PK is unlikely to be changed when it is co-administered with chemotherapy in treating 
paediatric Ph+ ALL. 
The previously conducted PPK model based simulation can, therefore, be applied to recommending 
WT-tiered dosing in paediatric Ph+ ALL, by matching the same reference exposure of the 60 mg/m2 
tablet. 
•  Dose selection and justification for PFOS in paediatric patients newly diagnosed with Ph+ ALL 
The use of the PFOS formulation was introduced into Study CA180372 in order to provide dosing 
flexibility for the very young children (as young as 1 year old) enrolled who experienced difficulty with 
the tablet formulation (whole or dispersed). 
In procedure EMEA/H/C/000709/X/0056/G, a bioequivalence study was submitted (CA180352) to 
compare the ratio and extent of absorption of dasatinib between 100 mg dasatinib PFOS and 2 x 50 
mg dasatinib tablet as reference (Table 7).

a 
AUC(INF) could not be determined in 3 subjects (10052, 10057, and 10060) after receiving Treatment A. 
Results showed that the PFOS and the dispersed tablet were not bioequivalent to the reference tablet 
formulation. The exposure (by AUC[INF]) for PFOS was found to be approximately 19% less than that 
with intact tablets in healthy adults. These results suggested a dose increase of 20% may be needed 
when using the PFOS formulation to potentially match the exposure of the tablet formulation in adults.  
There were no safety data available at that time on the impact of such a dose increase on Ph+ ALL 
paediatric patients, who were being treated with chemotherapy. The PFOS dose was not increased to 
72 mg/m2 until further safety evidence was available. 
PFOS dose of 72 mg/m2 was further studied in paediatric subjects with treatment-naïve CP-CML in 
Study CA180226. The PK, efficacy, and safety of PFOS 72 mg/m2 provided the basis for dose 
recommendation of paediatric CP-CML patients. The result of this trial suggested that a dose of 
dasatinib PFOS 72 mg/m2 may not be sufficient to achieve a comparable exposure level to that from a 
60 mg/m2 tablet in CML paediatric patients, and that an increase to 90 mg/m2 may be needed. A PBPK 
model indicated the mechanism that likely drives reduced bioavailability for suspension treatments 
relative to tablets is inherent to the in vivo gastric behaviour of the two different dosage forms (shorter 
gastric transit for suspensions) and not likely related to the formulation composition. Safety data from 
Study CA180226 showed that the PFOS dose could safely be increased from 60 mg/m2 to 72 mg/m2. 
Since the PK of dasatinib was assessed to be independent of disease state (ie, CML or ALL) and given 
the safety data already accumulated in Ph+ ALL population with dasatinib 60 mg/m2 tablet combined 
with chemotherapy, it was determined that a dose increase of PFOS to at least 72 mg/m2 in Ph+ ALL 
paediatric patients would be safe. However, the PFOS dose was not increased to 72 mg/m2 because 
study enrollment had closed and the treatment for the remaining subjects was near to completion. 
Therefore, PFOS continued to be offered at 60 mg/m2 in Study CA180372. 
The dasatinib PFOS dose recommendation for paediatric Ph+ ALL is identical to the dose 
recommendation for CP-CML. In Study CA180372, 24 subjects received at least 1 dose of the PFOS, 
and 8 out of the 24 were administered this formulation exclusively.  
Specifically, the previous PPK model was developed using data from multiple studies including data 
from Ph+ ALL paediatric subjects. Given the PK similarity between disease statuses, the PPK model 
inference was expected to apply to Ph+ ALL as well. The model identified ~40% lower bioavailability of 
PFOS, which was reflected in the WT-tiered dosing table by a fixed ratio between PFOS and tablet 
doses in each WT tier.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 20/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dasatinib was tolerated at tablet doses up to 120 mg/m2 and showed a safety profile that was 
manageable in paediatric subjects with leukemia. Exposure resulting from the WT-tiered dosing of 
PFOS was expected to be similar to tablet 60 mg/m2 and, therefore, within the established safety 
margin. 
The effect of GI toxicity on the PK of dasatinib  
In  order  to  quantitatively assess  the  effect  of  GI  toxicity  on dasatinib  absorption,  sensitivity  analyses 
were  performed  using  a  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  model.  The  steps  of  the 
analyses are illustrated in Figure 4.

Study CA180204, included a safety phase (dose finding phase) dedicated to a stepwise incorporation of 
dasatinib into the backbone chemotherapy as used in COG study AALL0031 – which included imatinib. 
Study CA180204 was an open-label, multi-center, single-arm Phase 2 study in children and young 
adults with newly diagnosed ALL (see description of the study under section ‘‘Supportive study’’). 
Figure 5 Diagram of Safety Phase 
Subjects included in this phase received dasatinib discontinuously in 2-week periods followed by 1 to 2 
weeks off. A tolerable level of 60 mg/m2 was established, enrolment into the safety phase was stopped 
and the efficacy phase of the trial opened with dasatinib administered continuously. Patients in this 
trial are later reviewed and referred to the discontinuous and (part of the) continuous tablet group. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Two clinical studies have been conducted in paediatric subjects with Ph+ ALL where dasatinib has been 
co-administered with chemotherapy. Most patients have been treated with tablets. Out of 106 subjects 
in  study  CA180372,  24  received  at  least  one  PFOS  dose  and  8  subjects  were  treated  with  PFOS 
exclusively.  
Dasatinib  is  primarily  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  however  most  chemotherapeutic  agents  used  for  Ph+ 
ALL  are  not  inhibitors  or  inducers  of  CYP3A4  and  no  change  in  PK  is  expected  when  dasatinib  is  co-
administered with chemotherapy.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 22/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant use of dexamethasone, a weak CYP3A4 inducer, with dasatinib is allowed; dasatinib AUC 
is  predicted  to  decrease  approximately  25%  with  concomitant  use  of  dexamethasone,  which  is  not 
likely to be clinically meaningful (SmPC, section 4.5). 
A BE study in healthy adults concluded that the bioavailability of PFOS was approximately 19 % lower 
compared  to  tablets  and  therefore  a  dose  of  72  mg/m2  PFOS  was  expected  to  be  comparable  to  the 
tablet dose of 60 mg/m2 and used in the CP-CML studies. However, the PFOS dose of 60 mg/m2 was 
not increased in the Ph+ ALL study CA 180372 as enrolment was completed. In study CA180372, out 
of  106  subjects,  24  received  at  least  one  PFOS  dose  and  only  8  subjects  were  treated  with  PFOS  
exclusively.  
Dasatinib exposure measures appeared to be consistent across disease type (CP-CML and Ph+-ALL) for 
both adult and paediatric subjects, though PK data from paediatric Ph+ ALL subjects are limited. Pop 
PK  analysis  in  paediatric  subjects  has  showed  that  the  bioavailability  of  PFOS  is  even  lower  in 
paediatric subjects. The analysis showed that the bioavailability of PFOS was approximately 40% lower 
than that of tablet in paediatric patients. This is expected to be due to faster gastric transit time of the 
formulation. The importance of an oral solution is acknowledged. Paediatric subjects treated also with 
chemotherapy may have difficulties swallowing tablets and will have a high need for an alternative oral 
formulation. However, no clinical data are available to support the proposed dose and no PK data are 
available  from  paediatric  Ph+  ALL  patients  treated  only  or  partly  with  PFOS.  With  the  use  of  a  PBPK 
model the applicant has adequately justified the proposed PFOS dose.  
The  MAH  has  not  planned  to  conduct  a  “window”  study  with  the  PFOS  dose  90  mg/m2  in  Ph-positive 
paediatric  ALL.  A  PBPK  model  has  been  used  to  justify  the  proposed  PFOS  dose.  The  results  showed 
that  dasatinib  exposure  is  likely  to  increase  modestly  for  both  tablet  and  PFOS  with  GI  toxicity 
(including change in gastric transit time and small intestinal transit time, inflammation related change 
in  permeability,  and  variations  of  gastric  pH  values).  The  modest  increase  in  exposure  is  not 
considered  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  especially  no  impact  on  clinical  efficacy  due  to  GI  toxicity  is 
expected.  Even  though  the  model  has  some  limitations,  it  is  acknowledged  that  PK  should  not  be 
further  explored  in  the  rare  and  vulnerable  target  population  of  this  application.  The  presented 
simulations  and  justifications  for  a  bridging  strategy  between  CP-CML  and  Ph+-ALL  are  considered 
adequate.  
For CP-CML a PFOS dose of 90 mg/m2 has been proposed and endorsed by CHMP, but bioequivalence 
will  be  investigated  in  a  PK  window  study  in  CP-CML  conducted  post-approval.  As  the  PK,  including 
bioavailability, of dasatinib appear to be comparable across disease status, the PFOS dose used in CP-
CML has also been endorsed for the Ph+ ALL indication. The MAH is committed to provide the results 
of this PK-window study post-approval. In relation to this it needs to stressed that although (based on 
the  mechanistic  understanding,  the  analysis  of  efficacy  versus  GI  toxicity,  formulation  and  patient 
populations, and the analysis of PK in the different patient populations) the PBPK model is considered 
to provide reassuring data on the extrapolation of PK across the patient populations, the PBPK model is 
not  fully  validated.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  MAH  to  confirm  (post-approval)  that  post-approval 
analysis  will  be  conducted  to  demonstrate  that  the  PBPK  model  adequately  captures  the  effects  of 
chemotherapy on absorption in line with the existing guideline on Reporting and Qualification of PBPK 
models.  . 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of dasatinib has been investigated to a reasonable extent in the paediatric 
population in ALL. The PK of dasatinib appears to be similar in paediatric patients with CP-CML and

Treatments 
Dasatinib  was  orally  delivered  as  a  tablet,  as  a  dispersed  tablet,  or  as  a  suspension  from  a  powder 
(PFOS)  at  a  dose  of  60  mg/m2  daily.  For  children  and  adolescents  capable  of  swallowing  tablets,  the 
existing  tablets  in  strengths  of  5  mg,  20  mg,  and  50  mg  were  given  to  cover  the  anticipated  dose 
range.  If  necessary  for  administration  in  young  children  not  able to  swallow  tablets, dasatinib  tablets 
were allowed to be dispersed in 100% preservative-free juice (ie, orange or apple juice or lemonade). 
The PFOS bottle was constituted with 77 mL purified water or sterile water for injection to give a total 
volume of 99 mL with a 10 mg/mL suspension. Dasatinib PFOS (offered at the same dose as the tablet 
[60 mg/m2]) was developed for paediatric patients who are unable to swallow the tablet.  
This  study  utilized  the  standard  Associazione  Italiana  di  Ematologia  Paediatrica  -  Berlin-Frankfurt-
Muenster  (AIEOP  BFM)  ALL  2000  chemotherapeutic  protocol.  Chemotherapy  was  obtained  by  the 
investigating  site’s  standard  prescribing  procedures  according  to  country  availability  and  specific 
regulatory  requirements.  The  chemotherapy  regimen  used  in  study  CA180372  was  the  same  as  the 
chemotherapy regimen used in European Intergroup Study on Post-induction Treatment of Philadelphia 
Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (EsPhALL) and AIEOP BFM ALL 2000 trials.

Table 9 Non-investigational Products - Study CA180372 
The components of treatment were divided into successive blocks as follows: 
Phase I - For all subjects: 
• 
• 
Induction  IA  (4  -  5  weeks):  During  the  first  2  weeks,  the  subjects  received  frontline  ALL 
induction  chemotherapy  outside  the  protocol.  They  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  started  to 
receive dasatinib when Ph+ status was confirmed via cytogenetics, FISH, or PCR prior to Day 
15. 
Induction IB (dasatinib continued) (28 days, 4 weeks) 
•  Recovery period (dasatinib continued, no chemotherapy given) (2 - 4 weeks) 
• 
Three successive consolidation blocks (HR1, HR2, and HR3) of 21 days each, 3 weeks each 
•  Recovery period (dasatinib continued, no chemotherapy given) (14 days, 2 weeks) 
Phase IIa - For the subjects who do not meet the criteria for HSCT: 
•  Re-induction Block 1, including phase IIa and IIb (63 days, 9 weeks) 
• 
Interim  maintenance  (29  days,  4  weeks).  Subjects  with  CNS3  disease  at  diagnosis  received 
cranial irradiation during the Interim Maintenance period. 
•  Re-induction Block 2 (63 days, 9 weeks) 
Assessment report

•  Continuation therapy (62 weeks) 
Phase IIb - For the subjects who met the criteria for HSCT: 
•  Subjects who met pre-defined criteria at specific time points in treatment received a HSCT and 
had the option to receive 12 additional months of post-HSCT dasatinib (not mandatory).

Objectives  
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  3-year  efficacy  based  on  event  free  survival 
(EFS) of dasatinib plus chemotherapy with external historical controls. 
Secondary objectives included the estimation of the below: 
• 
• 
The safety and feasibility of dasatinib added to standard chemotherapy 
The EFS of dasatinib plus chemotherapy (including 3 and 5-year rates) 
•  Complete  remission  rates  (<  5%  blasts  in  bone  marrow  and  no  peripheral  blasts)  at  end  of 
induction compared with AIEOP BFM 2000 and the amended EsPhALL trials 
• 
The difference in 3-year EFS rate with the 3-year EFS rate of available historical controls such 
as the COG AALL0031 study 
•  Minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  quantification  (defined  by  PCR  detection  of  clone-specific 
immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements) using three methods 
•  BCR-ABL mutation status at baseline and time of disease progression or relapse 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 27/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory objectives included the assessment of the following: 
•  Disease-free survival (DFS) 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
•  Growth and development and bone mineral content 
• 
Prognostic value of MRD on EFS 
•  Correlation  between  the  3  methods  of  assessing  MRD:  real-time  qPCR  for  clone  specific 
immunoglobulin  and  T-cell  receptor  gene  rearrangements,  real-time  qPCR  for  BCR-ABL 
transcripts, and multiparameter flow cytometry 
•  Rates of HSCT and safety of post-HSCT dasatinib 
Outcomes/Endpoints 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the 3-year binomial EFS rate. EFS was defined 
as the time from the starting date of dasatinib (upon confirmation that ALL is Ph+ ALL) until an 
event.  In  the  primary  analysis,  the  3-year  EFS  response  rate  was  defined  as  the  number  of 
subjects  without  event  after  3  years  since  the  start  of  dasatinib  divided  by  the  number  of 
treated subjects. Events for EFS are defined as any first one of the following: lack of complete 
response  in  bone  marrow;  relapse  at  any  site;  development  of  second  malignant  neoplasm; 
death from any cause. 
Secondary endpoints: 
• 
EFS defined as the time from the starting date of dasatinib (upon confirmation that ALL is Ph+ 
ALL) until an event. 
The EFS endpoint is also considered for secondary/sensitivity analyses, including: 
1.  HSCT considered as an event if the subject discontinues 
2.  Lost to follow-up considered as an event (at the date of last contact) 
3.  Induction failures considered as an event at time 0 
4.  Stratified subgroup analysis of 3-year EFS rates for HSCT status looking at 3 groups: subjects 
who  had  HSCT,  subjects  who  were  eligible  to  have  HSCT  but  did  not,  and  subjects  who  were 
ineligible for HSCT. 
5.  Using  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  EFS  probabilities  (for  overall  EFS  estimation  including  the  3-
year and 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates) 
6.  Stratified by high versus low/standard risk  
7.  Comparing 3-year EFS with results in COG AALL0031 (with alignment of EFS definition) 
Historical Control Studies 
•  Complete  Remission  Rate  (CRR)  defined  as  <  5%  lymphoblasts  in  the  bone  marrow  (ie,  M1 
bone marrow) and CSF with no evidence of other extra medullary disease. 
•  Minimal  Residual  Disease  (MRD):  The  MRD  levels  are  the  proportion  of  leukemic  cells  in  a 
sample  at  a  specific  time point.  The  method  of  reference  is  the  quantitative  PCR  detection  of 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 28/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clone-specific immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements (Ig/TCR). The limit of 
detection of this assay will be approximately  10-4 - 10-5 or 0.01% - 0.001%. 
• 
PCR  for  BCR-ABL  defined  as  a  ratio  of  BCR-ABL  transcripts  compared  to  a  control  gene  (eg 
ABL) with log reduction compared to baseline.  
•  BCR-ABL mutation defined as the presence of a detectable amino acid substitution in the ABL 
kinase domain. 
Exploratory endpoints: 
• 
EFS by MRD level and concordance between assessment methods. 
•  Disease-free  survival  (DFS)  defined  as  the  time  of  first  day  of  complete  response  (M1  bone 
marrow)  until  relapse  at  any  site,  development  of  a  second  malignant  neoplasm,  or  death 
without  relapse.  The  definition  of  relapse  used  for  DFS  is  the  same  as  for  EFS.  Subjects  who 
neither  relapse  nor  die  or  who  are  lost  to  follow-up  will  be  censored  on  the  date  of  their  last 
assessment.  Subjects  who  undergo  HSCT  would  not  be  considered  as  having  an  event,  and 
would continue to be followed. 
•  Overall  survival  defined  as  time  from  the  first  day  of  dasatinib  treatment  until  the  time  of 
death.  Subjects  who  have  not  died  or  who  are  lost  to  follow-up  will  be  censored  on  the  last 
date the subject is known to be alive. 
Sample size 
The sample size and power calculations incorporated the following assumptions: 
•  3-year  EFS  rate  of  chemotherapy  alone  in  AIEOP-BFM  was  52%  (41  event  free  out  of  79 
subjects) 
•  3-year  EFS  rate  of  continuous  imatinib  plus  chemotherapy  (amended  EsPhALL  trial)  will  be 
78%  (70  event  free  out  of  90)  (assumes  the  same  rate  as  3-year  EFS  rate  of  continuous 
imatinib plus chemotherapy in COG AALL0031) 
•  3-year EFS rate of continuous dasatinib plus chemotherapy will be 88% (absolute improvement 
of 10% over imatinib plus chemotherapy) 
•  A non-inferiority margin of 5% (corresponding to approximately 1/4 of the effect size of 18% 
anticipated in the amended EsPhALL trial over the chemotherapy-only historical control) 
•  One-sided type I error rate of 0.05  
Based on the above assumptions, this study required 75 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint, 
including at least 20 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint in each of the following age ranges: 1 
to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years. This sample size yielded 100% power to detect a true difference 
of  36%  in  3-year  EFS  of  dasatinib  plus  chemotherapy  (AIEOP  BFM  2000)  over  chemotherapy  alone 
(AIEOP-BFM 2000). 
For  non-inferiority  testing against  imatinib  plus  chemotherapy  75  subjects  would  yield  83%  power  to 
reject 
the  null  hypothesis  and  declare  non-inferiority  of  dasatinib/chemotherapy  and 
imatinib/chemotherapy (EsPhALL). 
Under  the  same  assumptions,  a  sample  size  of  75  subjects  would  yield  54%  power  to  detect  a  true 
difference  of  10%  in  3-year  EFS  between  dasatinib/chemotherapy  over  imatinib  /chemotherapy 
(EsPhALL). 
Assessment report

It was assumed that the rate of subjects discontinuing study participation prior to reaching 3 years of 
follow-up from the start of dasatinib without having an event, might potentially reach 20%. Additional 
15  subjects  were  to  be  treated  in  order  to  assure  robustness  of  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety 
analysis  results.  The  planned  number  of  subjects  to  be  treated  was  between  75  and  90.  Under  the 
assumption  of  treating 90  subjects,  the  power  for the  non-inferiority  analysis  would  be  85%,  and  for 
the final superiority analysis the power would be 56%. 
Randomisation 
The study was a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
General Methods 
Analyses  and  summaries  were,  except  where  indicated  otherwise,  based  on  the  whole  target  study 
population, as well as on the following sub-populations: 
o  Subjects treated with dasatinib tablets only (identified in table presentations as tablet 
only), 
o  Subjects who at any time received dasatinib in the PFOS formulation (identified in table 
presentations as PFOS used) 
Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  all treated  subjects  and  mainly  consisted  of response  rates,  Kaplan-
Meier  plots  for time to  event  variables,  and  3-year  and  5-year  EFS  and  DFS  rates.  The  subjects  who 
were enrolled in this study (CA180372) were considered Cohort 1 and the external historical controls 
AIEOP-BFM 2000 and Amended EsPhALL were considered Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, respectively. 
Primary endpoint analyses were performed in hierarchical order as follows: 
•  Superiority of cohort 1 over cohort 2 
•  Non-inferiority of cohort 1 to cohort 3 
•  Superiority of cohort 1 over cohort 3 
The  differences  in  3-year  EFS  rates  were  computed  using  binomial  proportions  of  subjects  who  were 
free  of  events  at  3  years  over  all  treated  subjects.  Subjects  lost  to  follow-up  at  any  time  without  an 
event  were  considered  event  free  in  the  primary  analysis.  Event  rates  were  provided  with  exact  2-
sided  90%  Clopper-Pearson  CI’s.  Differences  in  event  rates  were  tested  at  the  0.05  1-sided 
significance  level  using  a  Pearson  χ2  test.  Non-inferiority  testing  against  the  study  treatment  in  the 
amended  EsPhALL  trial  were  carried  out  using  the  corresponding  2-sided  90%  CI  for  the  treatment 
difference  (3-year  EFS  rate  in  dasatinib+chemo  minus  3-year  EFS  rate  in  imatinib+chemo)  and 
comparing  the  lower  confidence  limit  to  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  -5%.  Next  to  performing  the 
above  analyses  on  all  treated  subjects,  the  same  analyses  were  performed  on  subjects  with

uncontested Ph+ ALL diagnosis, meaning that any subject that was considered during treatment not to 
have Ph+ ALL was excluded.

Clinically  relevant  protocol  deviations  were  significant  protocol  deviations  that  were  prespecified, 
programmable, and defined as events that may have had considerable impact on the outcome of the 
study or interpretation of the results of the study.  
Overall, there were 42 clinically relevant protocol deviations reported in 40 subjects: 40 deviations due 
to use of concomitant medications with potential to prolong QTc, and 2 deviations due to subjects with 
blast-phase CML who were misclassified with Ph+ ALL. Inclusion of these 2 subjects in analysis did not 
impact  interpretability  of  study  results.  Most  of  the  deviations  (30  subjects)  were  subjects  who 
received  short-term  prophylactic  antibiotics  with  a  macrolide  and/or  pentamidine.  Other  prohibited 
medications included droperidol, methadone, haloperidol, domepridone and chlorpromazine.

Ancillary analyses 
Subjects who received dasatinib PFOS exclusively 
Of the 24 subjects in the PFOS group (received at least 1 dose of PFOS), 8 (7.54%) subjects received 
PFOS  exclusively.  At  the  time  of  DBL,  5  of  them  were  alive  with  no  relapse,  2  had  a  bone  marrow 
relapse  and  were  alive  after  receiving  subsequent  therapy.  One  subject  had  a  positive  MRD  and 
underwent  a  HSCT,  reinitiated  dasatinib  until  Month  5  post-transplantation;  3  months  after 
discontinuing  dasatinib,  the  patient  relapsed  and  died  2.5  months  later.  Hence,  the  OS  rate  was  7/8 
(87.5%) and EFS rate was 5/8 (62.5%). 
•  Updated 3-year data, PFOS (only) vs. PFOS (once) 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 3-year DFS of dasatinib plus chemotherapy treatment in the 8 patients 
who received PFOS exclusively was 62.5% (95% CI: 22.9, 86.1). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 3-year 
DFS of dasatinib plus chemotherapy treatment in the patients who received both PFOS and tablets was 
68.8% (95% CI: 40.5, 85.6).

Supportive study  
Study CA180204  
Study  CA180204  was  an  open-label,  multi-center,  single-arm  Phase  II  study  in  62  paediatric  and 
young adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. A total of 55 paediatric subjects were treated (35 
in the discontinuous dasatinib group and 20 in the continuous dasatinib group; 3 non-eligible subjects 
were  excluded  from  the  efficacy  analysis).  A  total  of  33  (60%)  paediatric  subjects  completed  study 
treatment. The most common reason in paediatric subjects in the combined cohorts for not completing 
study treatment was bone marrow transplant (N = 13, 23.6%). Two paediatric subjects were reported 
to  have  disease  progression  during  the  study.  Reasons  for  not  continuing  in  the  study  included: 
enrolment  onto  another  COG  study  with  therapeutic  intent  (9.1%),  death  (12.7%),  and  3  (5.5%) 
subjects  considered  ineligible  after  having  started  treatment.  A  summary  of  key  demographic 
characteristics of study CA180204 is presented in Table 29. 
Table 29 Summary of Key Demographic Characteristics-Study CA180204 
The  median  duration  of  dasatinib  therapy  from  first  through  last  dasatinib  dose  date  was  31.31 
months. 
Subjects  were  categorized  by  risk:  Standard  Risk  was  defined  as  M1  (bone  marrow  status  of  <  5% 
lymphoblasts/complete response in bone marrow) with MRD < 1% at end Induction and MRD < 0.01% 
at end Consolidation Block 2; High Risk was defined as MRD ≥ 1% at end Induction or MRD ≥ 0.01% 
at end Consolidation Block 2. Any Risk is both groups combined. 
A summary of efficacy results in Study CA180204 is presented in Table 30.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This  application  is  based  on  two  studies.  The  main  study  CA180372  is  a  Phase  2,  open-label,  multi-
center  single-arm,  historically-controlled  study  in  children  and  adolescents  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+ 
ALL.  Included  patients  were  given  continuous  dasatinib  added  to  a  Ph+  ALL  chemotherapy  regimen, 
based  on  regimens  from  the  AIEOP-BFM  ALL  2000  study  and  the  amended  EsPhALL.  The  primary 
objective was to compare the 3-year EFS of dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy with external 
historical controls.  
The  supportive  study  CA180204  was  a  Phase  2,  open-label,  multi-center,  single-arm  study  including 
children  and  young  adults  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  ALL  to  be  treated  also  with  dasatinib  60  mg/m2 
daily  by  oral  tablet.  Study  CA180204  was  based  on  a  different  chemotherapy  backbone  therapy  than 
that  used  in  CA180372,  and  the  number  of  subjects  in  study  CA180204  who  received  dasatinib 
continuously was limited to 20 subjects. This study was terminated early due to the opening of the main 
study.  
The  clinical  studies  were  performed  with  few  amendments,  withdrawals  or  lost  to  follow-up. 
Introduction of an oral suspension of medication for the ALL, otherwise only available as tablet and not 
for  parenteral  use,  will  definitely  meet  an  unmet  medical  need  in  children.  Likewise,  this  PFOS  may 
also  be  of  interest  in  some  adult  patients,  who  may  have  difficulties  swallowing  tablets  for  various 
reasons.  
The clinical development program for dasatinib in paediatric ALL includes single-arm studies. Imatinib 
was  the  first  TKI  to  be  developed  and  therefore  also  the  first  introduced  as  targeted  therapy  in 
childhood leukemia. The trials included randomization of chemotherapy to treatment with and without 
imatinib  and  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  the  combination  therapy.  The  design  of  the  main  and 
supportive  studies introducing  dasatinib  were  single-arm  studies  because  activity  of  dasatinib  against 
Ph+  ALL  in  adults  and  of  imatinib  against  Ph+  ALL  in  children  has  been  established  and  hence 
comparing the activity of dasatinib in combination to chemotherapy alone is acceptable. However, the 
review  and  interpretation  of  previous  advice  is  accepted.  It  is  noticed  that  in  the  introduction  of 
imatinib in paediatric ALL, trials did include a randomization in subgroups between chemotherapy plus 
imatinib versus chemotherapy alone but were amended to all patients receiving imatinib shortly after 
favourable results of other paediatric trials with imatinib became known [2]. 
The  patient  population  included  in  the  dasatinib  clinical  studies  are  representative  for  paediatric  Ph+ 
ALL,  with  very  few  patients  below the  age  of  7,  and  the  majority  up  to the  age  of  18.  Patients  often 
present  severe  leucocytosis  and  two  T-ALL  were  included.  Some  more  characteristics  may  influence 
the prognosis, and treatment progress in all acute leukaemia therapy has emphasized the importance 
of the cytogenetic aberrations. The secondary genetic abnormalities have not been included in previous 
advice,  nor  have  data  been  collected  later,  e.g.  from  conventional  chromosome  analysis,  which  it  is 
anticipated  have  been  performed  in  many  patients,  because  the  banding  technique  is  a  standard 
analysis.  The  importance  of  secondary  clonal  aberrations  was  known  before  2005  [3],  but  it  is 
accepted that the information was not collected and consequently not included in the interpretation of 
results of dasatinib in paediatric ALL. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  Performance  status  is  not  commented  in  reviews  on  paediatric  ALL  (Ph-positive  and  -negative), 
but the symptoms involves fever, recurrent infections, organomegaly, bleeding, weight loss, bone pain 
etc  [7].  The  PS  is  not  mentioned  in  the  criteria  for  the  EsPhALL  study,  which  states  that  the  patient 
should  be  eligible  for  the  current  local  prospective  therapeutic  study  of  childhood  ALL  (link: 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 50/80 
 
 
 
 
 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00287105).  However,  only  1  subject  out  of  109  screened 
patients in study CA180372 was excluded due to an active infection. 
In study CA180372, the 3-year binomial EFS rate with dasatinib plus chemotherapy was 66.0% (90% 
CI:  57.7,  73.7)  compared  to  49.2%  (90%  CI:  38.0,  60.4)  observed  with  chemotherapy  alone  in 
AIEOP-BFM  2000  and  to  59.1%  (90%  CI:  51.8,  66.2)  observed  with  continuous  imatinib  plus 
chemotherapy in the amended EsPhALL trial in all treated subjects.  
Regarding the secondary endpoints, the OS rate was 91.5% (95% CI: 84.2 - 95.5) at 3 years and the 
CR was 93.4% (99/106) after consolidation chemotherapy. The results of 3-year DFS are in the same 
range to results obtained with imatinib.  
The  inferior  CR  rate  at  the  end  of  Induction  IA  vs  AIEOP-BFM  2000  and  the  Amended  EsPhALL  trial 
showed  a  relevant  flaw  in  the  CA180372  study  design  and  conduct,  as  patients  undergoing  the  CR 
assessment not in the last day of Induction IA, as determined, but on the following day, just prior to 
start  Induction  IB,  were  not  recognised,  as  per  protocol  criteria,  to  be  in  CR.  However,  the  CR  data 
with one day extension is clinically acceptable, as that extra day is not expected to significantly change 
the  patient’s  CR  status  and  allows  for  the inclusion of  CR  cases  excluded  for lack  of  information.  The 
CR analyses results with one extra day are in line with historical trials, including AIEOP-BFM 2000 and 
Amended EsPhALL. 
Not  all  patients  were  assessed  for  MRD-negativity  by  Ig/TCR  PCR  technique,  mainly  due  to  poor 
baseline  samples,  e.g.  no  clones  identified,  no  reliable  targets,  primers  failed  to  amplify  target, 
inadequate volume of BM at DX, etc. The MRD negativity rate assessed by Ig/TCR rearrangement was 
71.7% by the end of consolidation in all treated patients. When this rate was based on the 85 patients 
with evaluable Ig/TCR assessments, the estimate was 89.4%. The MRD-negativity rates at the end of 
induction and consolidation as measured by flow cytometry were 66.0% and 84.0%, respectively. 
The results of the oral suspension, which may be very valuable in the treatment of young children – or 
perhaps  adult  patients  with  Ph+  ALL  for  reasons  like  mucositis,  swallowing  disturbances  and  more  – 
are presented in 24 patients, who all had the PFOS at least once. Eight patients are characterized as 
treated exclusively by PFOS. The OS rate was 7/8 (87.5%) and EFS rate at 3 years was 5/8 (62.5%). 
The  relapse  and  survival  rates  in  the  PFOS  subgroup  of  subjects  are  consistent  with  the  overall 
population. It may be anticipated that children may use PFOS and tablets intermittently. Updated data 
for PFOS (only) and PFOS (once) treated patients are restricted by low numbers, as expected, but are 
comparable  demographically,  and  seems  to  show  similar  results  and  clinically  meaningful  on  the 
endpoint DFS, EFS and OS.  
The  study-design  did  not  include  previously  imatinib-treated  children,  and  the  experience  in  the 
molecular  biological  details  in  such  patients  is  also  limited.  However,  it  appears  that  eight  of  nine 
samples from imatinib-treated patients in the COGAALL0031 trial showed no BCR-ABL1 kinase domain 
mutation, only one presenting an acquired mutation [9].  
It is a concern if long-term outcome is reduced by insufficient dosing, even if the initial effect may still 
be  high  response  rates  and  encouraging  results.  Acute  leukaemia  may  in  most  cases  be  sensitive  to 
treatment,  and  it  is  important  to  maintain  the  efficacy  by  the  successive  therapies.  The  results 
obtained  in  the  main  single  arm  study  must  be  assessed  in  the  context  of  the  data  from  historical 
controls. Induction of deeper remissions are obtained more rapidly by dasatinib in CML than obtained 
by imatinib [10]. A survival advantage has not been demonstrated clearly in CML by any TKI, but the 
disease  biology  in  the  acute  leukaemia  is  different,  and  a  more  rapid  and  deep  remission  may  be 
valuable  for  survival.  The  efficacy  results  on  dasatinib  treatment  are  interpreted  as  a  contribution  to 
Assessment report

reduce  the  need  for  HSCT  as  second-line  treatment  in  paediatric  Ph+  ALL.  This  implication  is  very 
encouraging due to risks for fatal outcome or morbidity by HSCT.  
In  the  supportive  study  CA180204,  the  3-year  EFS  rate  was  80.8%  (95%  CI:  70.2,  91.4)  in  the  52 
paediatric  patients  considered  evaluable  for  efficacy  and  68.4%  (95%  CI:  48.3,  88.6)  in  the  19 
subjects on continuous dasatinib. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The main study CA180372 showed a clinically relevant effect in terms of the 3-year binomial EFS rate 
compared to historical controls treated without dasatinib by the same combination chemotherapy 
backbone. This was supported by improvements on all relevant secondary endpoints. 
Therefore, clinically relevant efficacy of dasatinib in combination with chemotherapy in newly 
diagnosed Ph+ ALL was demonstrated in the paediatric population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Dasatinib was combined with 2 different multi-agent chemotherapeutic “backbone” regimens to treat a 
total  of  161  paediatric  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL:  the  COG  AALL0031  treatment  regimen  in  Study 
CA180204,  and  the  Associazione  Italiana  di  Ematologia  Paediatrica  -  Berlin-Frankfurt-  Muenster 
(AIEOP-BFM) ALL 2000 regimen in Study CA180372. In Study CA180204, the COG AALL0031 regimen 
was combined with dasatinib treatment as a “discontinuous” regimen (ie, 2-week periods of dasatinib 
treatment  followed  by 1  to  2  weeks  off)  in the  first  cohort  and  a  “continuous”  regimen in  the  second 
cohort.  Study  CA180372  also  used  the  dasatinib  powder  for  oral  suspension  (PFOS)  formulation  for 
subjects who could not swallow tablets. 
Subject  disposition,  exposure,  adverse  events  (AEs),  and  AEs  of  special  interest  (AEOSIs)  were 
analyzed  from  paediatric  subject  data  pooled  from  Studies  CA180204  and  CA180372  and  are 
presented by the following categories of dasatinib treatment: 
•  Discontinuous dasatinib: N = 35 (exclusively from CA180204) 
•  Continuous dasatinib tablet only: N = 102 (20 from CA180204, and 82 from CA180372) 
•  Continuous dasatinib: N = 126 (20 from CA180204, and 106 from CA180372) 
•  All treated subjects: N = 161 (55 from CA180204, and 106 from CA180372)

Deaths 
•  Study CA180372 
As  of  the  26  July  2017  DBL,  15  (14.2%)  treated  subjects  died,  with  most  on-study  deaths  occurring 
post HR3 (12 subjects, 11.3%). No deaths were considered related to dasatinib.  
Table 42 Summary of Deaths - All Treated Subjects 
•  Study CA180204 
Among all treated paediatric subjects in Study CA180204 (N = 55), 7 (12.7%) deaths were reported, 
including 3 (8.6%) in Cohort 1 (N = 35) and 4 (20.0%) in Cohort 2 (N =20). No death was reported 
within 30 days of the last dose of treatment, and none was related to dasatinib treatment. Overall, 2 
deaths  were  due  to  disease  progression,  and  the  remaining  5  were  due  to  ‘other  cause’:  cardiac 
failure,  acute  critical  upper  airway  obstruction,  MLL-rearranged  therapy-related  acute  myeloid 
leukemia, injuries resulting from being hit by a school bus, and infection due to complication of graft 
vs host disease following HSCT.

In  Study  CA180372,  AEs  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  were  reported  in  7  (6.6%)  out  of  106 
subjects. All subjects who discontinued treatment took dasatinib tablet only, and no subject who took 
dasatinib PFOS at least once discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019

Grade 3-5 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 4 (3.8%) out of 106 subjects and 
included  Grade  4  enteritis,  Grade  5  fungal  sepsis,  Grade  3  lung  infection,  and  Grade  3 
thrombocytopenia. 
Dasatinib-related AEs leading to discontinuation 
Dasatinib-related  AEs  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  occurred  in  2  (1.9%)  subjects:  1  subject 
with  a  Grade  1  AE  of  drug  hypersensitivity,  and  1  subject  with  a  Grade  3  AE  of  thrombocytopenia. 
These  2  subjects  took  dasatinib  tablet  only,  and  no  subjects  who  took  dasatinib  PFOS  at  least  once 
discontinued due to a dasatinib-related AE. 
Study CA180204 
In  CA180204,  ‘action  taken’  regarding  study  drug  was  not  collected  as  part  of  AE  reporting,  and 
therefore no summaries of AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were generated. Based on 
investigator  reports  after  database  lock,  2  subjects  were  identified  with  on-treatment  toxicities  or 
complications leading to discontinuation of treatment: 1 subject with persistent QTc prolonged, and 1 
subject with methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy. 
Post marketing experience 
Dasatinib  was  first  approved  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  who  are  resistant  or 
intolerant to imatinib on 28 June 2006 by the US FDA. Dasatinib was subsequently approved in other 
countries  and is  marketed  worldwide  for  these  indications in  over 60 international  countries  including 
the EU, Japan, and Canada: 
•  Dasatinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  chronic,  accelerated,  or  myeloid  or 
lymphoid blast phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
•  Dasatinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to 
prior therapy.  
•  Dasatinib  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  Ph+  CML  in 
chronic phase. 
As reported in Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report No. 5 (28-Jun-2016 through 27-Jun-2017), the 
cumulative  number  of  patients  exposed  to  dasatinib  from  28-Jun-2006  through  31-Mar-2017  is 
estimated  to  be  63,960,  and  the  cumulative  exposure  is  estimated  to  be  127,690  patient-years.13 
Cumulatively,  of  the  approximately  6,773  subjects  assigned  to  treatment  (ie,  assigned  to  treatment 
with  the  investigational  medicinal  product,  active  comparator,  and/or  placebo  control)  in  BMS-
sponsored clinical trials, approximately 5,389 subjects have been exposed to dasatinib. Approximately 
1,214  total  subjects  have  been  exposed  to  dasatinib  under  Expanded  Access  Programs  (EAPs; 
CA180325).  Cumulatively,  3,300  subjects  have  been  exposed  to  dasatinib  while  participating  in  an 
ISR/ISTs  supported  by  BMS.  Therefore,  in  total,  approximately  9,903  subjects  have  been  exposed to 
dasatinib from 04-Nov-2003 through 27-Jun-2017. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of dasatinib has been characterised in CML patients and appears similar in Ph+ALL in adults 
and  overall  in  paediatric  ALL.  The  safety  results  reported  in  the  main  and  supportive  study  did  not 
reveal any new concern in combination with poly-chemotherapy backbone.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 70/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dasatinib’s  characteristic  effect  of  effusions  in  pleura  or  pericardium,  observed  as  a  dose-dependent 
adverse  event  in  adult  CML,  was  not  observed  in  the  discontinued  treatment  or  PFOS  (used)  group, 
and  in  all  grades  in  5.9%  in  the  tablet  (only)  group.  Considering  the  complexity  of  the  disease  and 
treatment  this  result  is  acceptable.  Pleural  effusions  were  not  observed  in  childhood  CML  treatment. 
The incidence of pleural (or pericardial) effusions is not expected to be underestimated as the clinical 
monitoring of patients was very thorough.   
There  were  two  studies  in  a  total  of  161  paediatric  patients  with  Ph+  ALL  in  which  Sprycel  was 
administered  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  In  Study  1,  of  55  paediatric  patients,  35  received 
Sprycel  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  on  a  discontinuous  dosing  regimen  (two  weeks  on 
treatment  followed  by  one  to  two  weeks  off)  and  20  received    Sprycel  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy on a continuous dosing regimen. In Study 2, 106 paediatric patients received Sprycel in 
combination  with  chemotherapy  on  a  continuous  dosing  regimen.  Among  the 126  Ph+  ALL  paediatric 
patients  treated  with  Sprycel  on  a  continuous  dosing  regimen,  the  median  duration  of  therapy  was 
23.6 months (range 1.4 to 33 months) (SmPC, section 4.8). 
Adverse  reactions  reported  in  the  two  paediatric  studies  in  which  Sprycel  was  administered  in 
combination with chemotherapy were consistent with the known safety profile of Sprycel in adults, and 
expected  effects  of  chemotherapy.  Of  the  126  Ph+  ALL  paediatric  patients  on  a  continuous  dosing 
regimen, 2 (1.6%) experienced adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation(SmPC, section 
4.8). 
The  adverse  events  were less  frequently  reported in  the  group  of  patients  treated by  “discontinuous” 
dasatinib,  compared  to  the  continuous  (tablet  only)  group.  This  is  in  line  with  a  dose  relation,  which 
therefore add uncertainty to interpretation of results obtained in the group of PFOS (used, n=24) and 
PFOS  (exclusively,  n  =  8)  group,  because  the  bioavailability  is  estimated  to  be  19%  less  by  the  60 
mg/m2 dose with PFOS. A new analysis showed a similar exposure distribution between disease types 
in  both  adult  and  paediatric  patients.  In  addition,  the  results  showed  that  the  intestinal  permeability 
did not change between chronic and acute leukaemia (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).   
Dasatinib  treatment  of  paediatric  ALL-patients  appears  to  have  limited  clinically  significant  impact  on 
growth  and  development,  but  it  is  difficult  to  draw  definitive  conclusions  due  to  the  concomitant 
treatment of dose-intense combination chemotherapy and without a longer follow-up period.  
The adherence to treatment was not optimal, with 25-30% of patients receiving less than 18 dasatinib 
doses  /  month.  The  risk  for  interaction  with  concomitant  medication  and  simultaneous  AEs  e.g. 
mucositis may be partly responsible..  
Cardiac  events  had  an  impact  on  clinically  relevant  protocol  deviations  reported  in  40  subjects:  40 
deviations  due  to  use  of  concomitant  medications  with  potential  to  prolong  QTc,  and  two  deviations 
due  to  subjects  with  blast-phase  CML  who  were  misclassified  with  Ph+  ALL.  Inclusion  of  these  two 
subjects in analysis did not impact interpretability of study results. Most of the deviations (30 subjects) 
were subjects who received short-term prophylactic antibiotics with a macrolide, pentamidine or other 
prohibited  medications,  which  included  droperidol,  methadone,  haloperidol,  domepridone  and 
chlorpromazine.  The  use  of  the  prohibited  concomitant  therapy  did  not  impact  the  efficacy  of  the 
treatment with dasatinib plus chemotherapy; none of these subjects had a QTc >450msec.  
The  adverse  events  affect  mainly  bone-marrow  function,  skin  and  mucosa  -  in  particular  in  the 
gastrointestinal  tract,  manifested  as  vomiting  and  diarrhoea.  Sepsis  and  infections  may  be  a 
consequence  of  neutropenia  and  barrier  defect,  because  contagious  infections  rarely  are  observed  in 
leukaemia  patients.  In  addition,  all  may  be  serious  in  grade,  and  in  a  few  cases  lead  to  treatment 
discontinuation. The number of all-causality related AEs leading to discontinuation was 8.5% (grade 3-
Assessment report

5 was 4.9%) in the tablet (only) group, and 2.4 % (1.2 % grade 3-5) were interpreted as dasatinib-
related.  No  discontinuation  were  registered  due  to  AE,  all  causality  or  dasatinib-related  in  the  PFOS 
(once) group in the main study.  
As  of  last  data-base  lock,  15  (14.2%)  treated  subjects  died.  Twelve  of  15  while  on-study  deaths 
occurring post HR3. No deaths were considered related to dasatinib. Nine (8.5%) subjects who were in 
CCR died and 5 (4.7%) subjects died less than 30 days after discontinuation from dasatinib treatment. 
Of the 11 deaths reported in the category of “Other,” 9 deaths were attributed primarily to infections. 
However,  for  a  more  meaningful  comparison,  the  paediatric  Ph+  ALL  population  was  compared  with 
the adult Ph+ ALL population and with  the paediatric population studied for the CP-CML indication.   
It is acknowledged that even focusing the analyses in the Ph+ ALL population, the setting is different 
between  children  and  adults.  In  the  paediatric  population  dasatinib  was  used  in  association  with 
chemotherapy  and  in  the  adult  population  it  was  used  as  monotherapy  in  patients  with  resistance  or 
intolerance to prior therapies. In the heavily pretreated adult population, the overall safety profile was 
influenced  by  the  advanced  stage  of  the  disease  and  the  use  of  prior  therapies.  In  the  paediatric 
population  it  was  influenced  by  the  concomitant  use  of  chemotherapy.  Dasatinib’s  safety  profile  is 
notably consistent across these groups, being in general more favourable in the paediatric population, 
namely  with  less  pleural  effusion  and  peripheral  edema.  There  is  some  more abdominal pain  (maybe 
related to age groups) and much more febrile neutropenia (in probable relation with the ALL backbone 
chemotherapy  treatment).  Nevertheless,  in  general,  the  safety  profile  of  dasatinib  in  the  paediatric 
Ph+ ALL study population was comparable to that in the adult trials. 
The adverse events observed in treatment of acute leukaemia may be related. It is also noted in tables 
of  AEOSI  and  SAE  that  patients  may  have  more  than  one  event  within  a  class.  A  trend  has  been 
observed  towards  more  frequent  SAEs  in  the  age-group  12-18  years  compared  to  the  youngest 
patients, below the age of 7 years.  
In  paediatric  patients  with  Ph+  ALL  treated  with  dasatinib  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  CBCs 
should be performed prior to the start of each block of chemotherapy and as clinically indicated. During 
the  consolidation  blocks  of  chemotherapy,  CBCs  should  be  performed  every  2  days  until  recovery 
(SmPC, section 4.4).  
In paediatric trials of Sprycel in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL paediatric 
patients  after  a  maximum  of  2  years  of  treatment,  treatment-related  adverse  events  associated  with 
bone growth and development were reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. This case was a Grade 1 osteopenia 
(SmPC, section 4.4). 
In  the  paediatric  ALL  studies,  the  rates  of  laboratory  abnormalities  were  consistent  with  the  known 
profile for laboratory parameters in adults, within the context of an acute leukaemia patient receiving a 
background chemotherapy regimen (SmPC, section 4.8). 
The introduction of the oral suspension, PFOS, in ALL will be a great treatment advantage in order to 
dispense the medication to a young child. Results on safety were pooled with tablet treated patients, 
and do not indicate specific safety issues or adverse events.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Sprycel administered in combination with chemotherapy in paediatric patients with 
Ph+ ALL was consistent with the known safety profile of Sprycel in adults and the expected effects of 
chemotherapy, with the exception of a lower pleural effusion rate in paediatric patients as compared to 
adults.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication is as follows: 
Sprycel is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in 
combination with chemotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) integrated with 
chemotherapy. 
The survival rate among subjects with Ph+ ALL still lags behind most other cytogenetic subgroups in 
paediatric ALL. Until recently, HSCT in first complete remission offered the best opportunity for long-
term EFS for children with Ph+ ALL, with an improvement in disease free survival of up to 65% and OS 
72%. This strategy is limited by the availability of a suitably matched donor, by the risk of post-
transplant–related morbidity and mortality and by relapses after HSCT, particularly in those who are 
MRD positive prior to transplantation. Paediatric patients with no suitable donor for HSCT have an even 
more critical unmet need for disease management. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Sprycel for the paediatric ALL indication was primarily supported by data from a 
Phase II, open-label, multi-centre, single-arm, historically-controlled study of dasatinib added to 
standard chemotherapy in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome positive 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Study CA180372). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study CA180372 the 3-year binomial EFS rate with dasatinib plus chemotherapy was 66.0% (90% 
CI:  57.7,  73.7).  As  an  indirect  comparison,  to  the  EFS  rate  was  49.2%  (90%  CI:  38.0,  60.4)  with 
chemotherapy alone in AIEOP-BFM 2000 and to 59.1% (90% CI: 51.8, 66.2) with continuous imatinib 
plus chemotherapy in the amended EsPhALL trial in all treated subjects.  
Regarding the secondary endpoints, the OS rate was 91.5% (95% CI: 84.2 - 95.5) at 3 years and the 
CR  was  93.4%  (99/106)  after  consolidation  chemotherapy.  In  addition,  the  MRD  negativity  rate 
assessed  by  Ig/TCR  rearrangement  was  71.7%  by  the  end  of  consolidation  in  all  treated  patients. 
When  this  rate  was  based  on  the  85  patients  with  evaluable  Ig/TCR  assessments,  the  estimate  was 
89.4%.  The  MRD-negativity  rates  at  the  end  of  induction  and  consolidation  as  measured  by  flow 
cytometry were 66.0% and 84.0%, respectively. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 75/80 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  supportive  study  CA180204,  the  3-year  EFS  rate  was  80.8%  (95%  CI:  70.2,  91.4)  in  the  52 
paediatric  patients  considered  evaluable  for  efficacy  and  68.4%  (95%  CI:  48.3,  88.6)  in  the  19 
subjects on continuous dasatinib. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
For CP-CML a PFOS dose of 90 mg/m2 has been proposed and endorsed by CHMP, but bioequivalence 
will  be  investigated  in  a  PK  window  study  in  CP-CML  conducted  post-approval.  As  the  PK,  including 
bioavailability, of dasatinib appear to be comparable across disease status, the PFOS dose used in CP-
CML has also been endorsed for the Ph+ ALL indication. The MAH was committed to provide the results 
of this PK-window study post-approval. In relation to this it needs to stressed that although (based on 
the  mechanistic  understanding,  the  analysis  of  efficacy  versus  GI  toxicity,  formulation  and  patient 
populations, and the analysis of PK in the different patient populations) the PBPK model is considered 
to provide reassuring data on the extrapolation of PK across the patient populations, the PBPK model is 
not  fully  validated.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  MAH  to  confirm  (post-approval)  that  the  post-
approval  analysis  will  be  conducted  to  demonstrate  that  the  PBPK  model  adequately  captures  the 
effects of chemotherapy on absorption in line with the existing guideline on Reporting and Qualification 
of PBPK models.. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Dasatinib-related AEs were reported in 86.3% and 72.2% had grade 3-4 AEs in the studied population.  
No new concerns were observed. Similar manifestations are observed treating ALL paediatric patients 
with PFOS.  
The  pattern  of  AEs  are  similar  to  treatment  by  dasatinib  in  paediatric  and  adult  CML  and  adult  ALL, 
dominated by all grade myelosuppression, mucositis / gastrointestinal manifestations and infections – 
but not any particular microbiological agent.  
The pattern of SAEs in general follows the same manifestations. The AEs and  SAEs are recognized in 
this  patient  population  and  manageable,  and  the  pattern  also  reflects  the  lack  of  co-morbidity  in  the 
paediatric patient population.   
No deaths have been related to dasatinib treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In study CA180372 the 3-year binomial EFS rate with dasatinib plus chemotherapy was 66.0% (90% 
CI:  57.7,  73.7).  As  an  indirect  comparison,  to  the  EFS  rate  was  49.2%  (90%  CI:  38.0,  60.4)  with 
chemotherapy alone in AIEOP-BFM 2000 and to 59.1% (90% CI: 51.8, 66.2) with continuous imatinib 
plus chemotherapy in the amended EsPhALL trial in all treated subjects.  
Further,  the  safety  profile  of  dasatinib  is  acceptable,  manifestations  manageable  and  without  new 
concerns.  Pleural  effusions  were  unusual,  no  pericardial  effusions  were  reported,  and  likewise  very 
serious  potential  complications  like  cerebral  haemorrhage,  pulmonary  oedema  or  pulmonary 
hypertension was not observed.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinically  meaningful  results  have  been  observed  with  the  use  of  dasatinib  combination  with 
chemotherapy in the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL which outweighs 
the ADRs that are considered manageable, despite the combination with intensive chemotherapy.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Sprycel is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include a paediatric indication for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia for Sprycel; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC are updated.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the product information. 
The RMP version 16.1 has also been submitted. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in 
accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) ) provided for 
under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/3851/2019  
Page 78/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0042/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Sprycel is not similar to Xaluprine, Blincyto, Iglusig and 
Besponsa within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include a paediatric indication for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia for Sprycel; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC are updated.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the product information. 
The RMP version 16.1 has also been submitted.

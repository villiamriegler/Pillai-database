3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Dapagliflozin has been approved in Europe since November 2012. Dapagliflozin is indicated in adults from 
age 18 years with T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control, either as 
monotherapy in patients for whom use of metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, or as add-on 
therapy to other glucose lowering medicinal products including insulin.  
The purpose of this application is to fulfil the requirement pursuant to Regulation EC No 1901/2006 for a 
Paediatric Investigation Plan as agreed by the Paediatric Development Committee and adopted by the 
European Medicines Agency, and to seek the extension of the indication for dapagliflozin in T2DM to 
include treatment of children aged 10 years and above.  
The current application is supported by data from two clinical studies: 
•  Study D1690C00016 (MB102091): “A Randomized, Multi-center, Parallel Group, Single-dose, 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Study of Dapagliflozin in Children and Adolescents Aged 
10 to 17 Years with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” 
•  Study D1690C00017 (MB102138): “A 24-Week, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel 
Group, Phase 3 Trial with a 28-Week Long-Term Safety Extension Period Evaluating the Safety 
and Efficacy of Dapagliflozin 10 mg in T2DM Patients Aged 10 to 24 Years” 
Study D1690C00017 was designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin 
versus placebo for the treatment of patients with paediatric onset T2DM. Paediatric T2DM is more 
prevalent in populations with low socioeconomic and educational status.  
3.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The proposed extension of the indication in T2DM is: 
“Forxiga/ Edistride is indicated in adults and children aged 10 years and above for the treatment of 
insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise  
• 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance.  
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.” 
Epidemiology 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, and the main driver is the increased 
prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Childhood T2DM is still relatively rare in Europe, with a 
prevalence of approximately 2.5 per 100 thousand. 
Biologic features 
As in adults, T2DM in children is characterised by hyperglycaemia driven by insulin resistance and relative 
insulin deficiency. The physiologic insulin resistance associated with pubertal development may 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 8/76 
 
 
 
 
 
exacerbate glucose dysregulation in susceptible children. Insulin secretion is more impaired in 
adolescents (approximately 85% reduction) as compared to adults (approximately 50% reduction) at the 
time of diagnosis of T2DM. Thus, the deterioration in insulin secretion appears to be more rapid in 
adolescents than in adults. 
Clinical presentation and prognosis 
Developing T2DM at a younger age is associated with a considerably higher risk of long-term 
cardiovascular disease compared with those who develop T2DM in the middle age. The rapid deterioration 
in glucose regulation in children as compared with adults may contribute to the greater risk for micro- 
and macrovascular complications in children with T2DM as they develop into adults. 
Management 
Management of T2DM in children involves lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic glucose-lowering 
treatment is often necessary and includes metformin or insulin or a combination of both. Recently, a 
GPL1-RA (liraglutide) has been approved for the use in children aged 10 or older. 
There is a need for additional effective, well tolerated and easily administered treatments to achieve and 
maintain target HbA1c levels as early as possible in children with T2DM. 
3.1.2.  About the product 
Dapagliflozin is a highly potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of SGLT2, the major transporter 
responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. Its mechanism of action results in the direct and insulin-
independent urinary excretion of glucose and osmotic diuresis.  
3.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development programme supporting the use of dapagliflozin in paediatric patients with T2DM 
includes 2 completed studies: 
Study D1690C00016 (MB102091): “A Randomized, Multi-center, Parallel Group, Single-dose, 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Study of Dapagliflozin in Children and Adolescents Aged 10 to 
17 Years with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” 
Study D1690C00017 (MB102138): “A 24-Week, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, 
Phase 3 Trial with a 28-Week Long-Term Safety Extension Period Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of 
Dapagliflozin 10 mg in T2DM Patients Aged 10 to 24 Years” 
As stated by the applicant, the following guidelines were referred to in the design of the clinical 
programme:  
• 
• 
EMA Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment or Prevention of 
Diabetes Mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00) (European Medicines Agency, London, UK, 2012).

(EMA/129698/2012) 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 9/76 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant sought scientific advice from the EMA CHMP on study design and utilizing a partial 
extrapolation model to overcome recruitment difficulties in the pivotal paediatric Phase 3 clinical study 
D1690C00017 (Procedure No: EMEA/H/SA/1012/1/FU/1/2014/PED/II, dated 23 October 2014). 
The final study design was accepted by the EMA in Procedure No: EMA/PDCO/602571/2019: EMEA-
000694-PIP01-09-M08. Overall, the EMA/CHMP considered that the size of the pivotal study, as justified 
by the partial extrapolation modelling, could well be sufficient to draw conclusions about benefit-risk in 
children aged 10 years and above, given the similar disease pathophysiology in the paediatric and adult 
T2DM populations and the well-known mechanism of action of dapagliflozin with its low risk of off-target 
effects. 
3.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the applicant, the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as 
defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical 
principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal 
Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). 
On 12 March 2021, the MAH was informed that an investigator at one site had been indicted for fraud 
while serving as an investigator for a different sponsor between September 2013 and May 2016. Two 
patients were enrolled into the study D1690C00017 placebo group at this site in July 2016. No 
irregularities have been detected at this site during the conduct of study D1690C00017. However, within 
the principles of GCP, the MAH has exercised caution and has performed sensitivity analyses in which 
data from this site were retrospectively excluded. An addendum to the CSR has been provided. An initial 
sensitivity analysis showed that the study conclusions are not affected by removing these data from the 
analysis. 
3.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
In view of the inclusion of patients aged 10-18 the results of the previously conducted reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies, in particular the juvenile toxicity studies are of special interest. The 
previously submitted and assessed data from the EPAR is presented below. 
3.2.2.  Toxicology 
Reproduction toxicity (Pre- and postnatal development and juvenile toxicity) 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function  
In the pre- and post-natal study in rats there was an increased incidence and/or severity of renal pelvic 
dilation, in absence of maternal toxicity. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 1 mg/kg, representing 
an AUC 19x clinical exposure.  
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) were dosed and/or further evaluated  
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 10/76 
 
 
 
 
 
Juvenile rats (21/sex/group) were dosed once daily with dapagliflozin from postnatal day (PND) 21 until 
PND 90 at 0, 1, 15 or 75 mg/kg.  
Renal pelvic and tubular dilatations were reported at all dose levels; pup exposures at the lowest dose 
tested were ≥ 15 times the maximum recommended human dose. These findings were associated with 
dose-related increases in kidney weight and macroscopic kidney enlargement observed at all doses. The 
renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile animals did not fully reverse within the 
approximate 1-month recovery period. The persistent renal findings might be due to the reduced ability 
of the developing rat kidney to handle dapagliflozin-increased urine volumes. The primary target organs 
at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg/day (mean AUC on PND 83 ≥ 6.97 μg*h/ml) were the kidney and adrenal gland. The 
findings unique to juvenile animals suggest a decreased capacity in juveniles to mount compensatory 
metabolic responses to dapagliflozin’s pharmacology. The findings in the juvenile rat toxicity study are in 
line with the findings in the pre- and post-natal toxicity study. 
In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, there were findings on renal pelvic dilatation in the 
offspring in absence of maternal toxicity. Similar findings were seen in a juvenile toxicity study in rats. 
The Applicant argued that these effects are due to a reduced ability of the developing rat kidney to handle 
dapagliflozin-increased urine volumes. Although there was a reasonable exposure margin at the 
developmental NOAEL in the pre- and postnatal study (19x clinical exposure), these effects are reflected 
in the SmPC. 
3.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No new data for the environmental risk assessment were included with this application. The Applicant 
submitted a justification of the absence of an updated ERA. Previously, the predicted environmental 
concentration (PEC) in surface water was calculated using the default market penetration factor (0.01). 
The inclusion of patients aged 10-18 years for the indication previously approved will thus not change the 
PEC or the previously determined ratios or conclusions.  
The PEC/PNEC ratio for microorganisms was <0.1. The PEC/PNEC ratios for groundwater and surface 
water were <1. These risk quotients indicate that dapagliflozin is unlikely to present a risk to 
microorganism or the aquatic and groundwater environments. The PEC/PNEC ratio for sediment was <1, 
indicating that dapagliflozin is unlikely to present a risk to sediment dwelling organisms. 
Considering the above data, dapagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
3.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of dapagliflozin were thoroughly evaluated during the original approval procedure 
for Edistride/ Forxiga. No new non-clinical studies were submitted in support of the present application. 
This is however acceptable. 
In view of the inclusion of patients aged 10-18 the results of the previously conducted reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies, in particular the juvenile toxicity studies are of special interest. 
The Applicant provided a statement that the existing nonclinical data for dapagliflozin supports the use in 
paediatric patients down to 10 years of age. No further discussion on how the results from the juvenile 
toxicity study relate to the indication in adolescents was provided. This is acceptable for the current 
application since children younger than 10 years old are not included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 11/76 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections from a non-clinical point of view concerning the application to the extension of 
the indication to include patients aged 10 years and older. 
The new/extended target population does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure 
further to the use of dapagliflozin.  
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
The current application is supported by data from two clinical studies: 
•  Study D1690C00016 (MB102091): “A Randomized, Multi-center, Parallel Group, Single-dose, 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Study of Dapagliflozin in Children and Adolescents Aged 
10 to 17 Years With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” 
•  Study D1690C00017 (MB102138): “A 24-Week, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel 
Group, Phase 3 Trial with a 28-Week Long-Term Safety Extension Period Evaluating the Safety 
and Efficacy of Dapagliflozin 10 mg in T2DM Patients Aged 10 to 24 Years” 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the WSA. 
The WSA has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
3.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two clinical studies were conducted that evaluated the PD and/or PK characteristics of dapagliflozin in 
T2DM paediatric populations. Study D1690C00016 (MB102091) was a Phase 1, single-dose, randomised, 
open-label study of 3 doses of dapagliflozin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg) in children and adolescents aged 10 to 
17 years and with T2DM. The study included 24 randomised patients. In addition, sparse PK samples 
were collected from the Phase 3 study D1690C00017 (MB102138) in T2DM patients aged 10 to 24 years. 
Study D1690C00016 (MB102091) showed that dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed following oral 
administration, with maximum concentrations achieved within 1.5 hours after administration. Mean 
terminal elimination half-life ranged from 10 to 14 hours across the studied dose range (2.5, 5, and 10 
mg). Systemic exposure to dapagliflozin appeared to be dose proportional following single oral doses of 
2.5 to 10 mg.  
Observed PK data comparison 
No apparent differences between dapagliflozin plasma concentrations normalised to 10 mg were observed 
between D1690C00017, adult T2DM patients and healthy subjects (Figure 5).

Population PK analysis 
Objective 
The analysis presented in this report does not include a full popPK model development due to the 
sparseness of the dapagliflozin concentrations in D1690C00017. Instead, the previously established 
popPK model for dapagliflozin in healthy subjects, adult and paediatric patients with T2DM (AstraZeneca 
2015) was used to assess 
1.  whether this model could accurately describe the dapagliflozin concentrations at steady state in 
paediatric T2DM subjects 
2.  whether the exposure is similar in different patient populations, such as the T2GO study, 
paediatric and adult T2DM subjects. 
Dataset 
The popPK model was based on dapagliflozin plasma concentrations from one phase III trial 
D1690C00017 in subjects aged 10-24 years with T2DM, one phase I study in children and adolescents 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 13/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aged 10 to 18 years with T2DM D1690C00016 (MB102091), and data from a previous T2DM submission. 
In total, 8347 dapagliflozin plasma concentrations from 1311 subjects were used in the analysis. 
For D1690C00017, 20.6% of the PK samples were below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) and were 
excluded (table below). All pre-dose samples (46, 32.6%) had missing dosing information. To assess 
these data, a dosing interval of 24 h was assumed and imputed. 
Final model 
The model was a two-compartment model with first-order elimination and first-order absorption. Addition 
of the D1690C00017 data in patients aged 10-24 had minor impact on the fixed-effects parameter 
estimates, which was expected due to the low number of observations in relation to the T2DM 
submission. The residual variability for D1690C00017 was estimated together with the D1690C00016 
(MB102091), which increased the residual variability (variance) from 0.2471 to 0.356. CL/F was 23.4 L/h, 
which is very close to the previous estimate in paediatric T2DM patients, adult T2DM patients and healthy 
subjects (23 L/h). The PK parameter estimates are presented in Table 5.

The prediction-corrected visual predictive checks stratified on study are shown in Figure 6, indicated that 
the model could adequately describe the data. Although the median of the observed data is in the upper 
range, potentially due to the relatively large fraction of BLQ concentrations in the study.

WSA conclusion popPK analysis 
Model-predicted AUC normalised to 10 mg was similar between studies D1690C00017 (MB102138), 
D1690C00016 (MB102091) and adult T2DM patients. Small and not clinically meaningful differences may 
have been due to slightly higher eGFR in paediatric patients. 
3.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Following administration of a single oral dose of 2.5 to 10 mg of dapagliflozin to paediatric patients with 
T2DM, the 24-hour UGE increased in a dose-related manner. The FPG concentration was lower for 
dapagliflozin panels 2.5, 5, and 10 mg on Day 2 versus pre-dose on Day 1. The population-based 
exposure-response analysis was performed to compare the paediatric and adult T2DM populations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 17/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Integrated data from 3 clinical studies: 1 paediatric study in T2DM patients (MB102091) and 2 studies 
performed in adults with T2DM (MB102003 and MB102025) was used. Data from a total of 83 patients 
were analysed (20 paediatrics and 63 adults), which had AUC24 and 24h-UGE data available and were 
collected following single dose of dapagliflozin. A sigmoidal Emax model accurately described the 
relationship between dapagliflozin exposure (AUC24) and response (24-hour UGE) after a single dose in 
adult and paediatric patients with T2DM. Baseline eGFR, FPG and gender were identified as covariates 
that have a significant impact on dapagliflozin Emax in both patient populations. Patients with a higher 
baseline eGFR and FPG are expected to have a greater UGE effect, and females are expected to have a 
lower UGE effect, compared with male patients. The effect of sex on dapagliflozin efficacy was previously 
observed when FPG was used as a PD endpoint. However, it was not considered to be clinically 
meaningful, and no dose adjustment was recommended. Paediatric and adult T2DM patients had similar 
exposure-response relationship following single doses of dapagliflozin after accounting for differences in 
covariates. 
3.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Efficacy and safety were studied in the paediatric phase 3 trial here (see clinical sections below), and the 
D1690C00017 study was not designed as an extrapolation of efficacy and safety from adults to paediatric 
population based on PK.  
However, there are questions regarding efficacy in the D1690C00017 study. With PK/PD relationship 
considered similar between adults and paediatric patients a similar PK profile and exposure for paediatric 
patients 10-17 years compared to adults would provide reassurance on the adequacy of efficacy and the 
chosen dose in 10-17 years-old patients. 
The applicant concludes that PK of dapagliflozin was not meaningfully different between the paediatric 
and adult patients and that small and not clinically meaningful differences may have been due to slightly 
higher eGFR in paediatric patients. The applicant supported their conclusion with a popPK analysis. 
The observed data plot supports that exposure profile is similar with data overlapping. The popPK does 
not describe variability in healthy subject adequately. Some slight model misspecification can also be 
seen for both adult patients and the paediatric patients from the D1690C00017 study, but the model is 
generally able to predict the median. The D1690C00017 study included paediatric patients and young 
adults. Stratified pcVPCs on age (i.e., 10-13, 14-17 and 18-25 years for the D1690C00017) study were 
provided in the 2nd round and are deemed satisfactory. Overall, the popPK analysis support a PK bridge 
(extrapolation of efficacy from adults to paediatric patients).  
In the box plots derived from the popPK model, exposures are largely overlapping. Low body weight 
patients have slightly higher exposure. Lower age patients have slightly lower exposure, potentially due 
to higher eGFR. The current popPK analysis provides support that the 10 mg dose is adequate in 10–17 
years old patients.   
The exposure-response analysis did not include the phase 3 trial data.  Paediatric and adult T2DM 
patients had similar exposure-response relationship following single doses of dapagliflozin after 
accounting for differences in covariates. This would support a PK bridge strategy extrapolating efficacy 
from adults to paediatric patients.  
3.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant concludes that exposure of dapagliflozin was not meaningfully different between the 
paediatric and adult patients and this is agreed with. Similar exposure for paediatric patients 10-17 years 
compared to adults allows for extrapolation of efficacy from adult to paediatric patients.

3.4.  Clinical efficacy 
3.4.1.  Main study - D1690C00017 (MB102138) 
Title of Study 
A 24-Week, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Phase 3 Trial with a 28-Week Long-
Term Safety Extension Period Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Dapagliflozin 10 mg in T2DM Patients 
Aged 10 to 24 Years 
Methods 
This was a prospective, multicentre, 24-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study (ST 
period) with a 28-week open-label active treatment extension (LT period), which included patients ≥10 
years and < 25 years of age, with confirmed diagnosis of T2DM, who were being treated with diet and 
exercise and a stable dose of metformin IR or XR, or a stable dose of insulin for a minimum, or a stable 
combination of metformin and insulin. 
Consented patients meeting screening criteria entered a 4-week placebo lead-in period. Patients were 
instructed to follow a diet and exercise programme (in accordance with the ADA or similar national 
guidelines) for the duration of the study. Patients were to maintain their baseline types of diabetic 
therapy throughout the study. The study design is shown in Figure 1. 
Recruitment (randomisation) of patients ≥ 18 and < 25 years old was limited to be less than 40% of 
patients. Recruitment (randomisation) of patients ≥ 10 and ≤ 15 years old was to include at least 20% of 
patients. 
After the lead-in period, at least 66 patients with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 11% at screening who met all the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were planned to be randomised 1:1 to receive oral 
dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo in a double-blind manner. After completion of the 24-week double-blind 
ST treatment period, patients were eligible to enter a 28-week open-label LT safety extension period for 
safety monitoring. All patients received open-label dapagliflozin 10 mg for the duration of the LT period. 
This was followed by a 4-week post-treatment safety follow-up period, during which patients did not 
receive study drug, and ended at the completion of a phone visit performed to assess AEs and 
medications. 
Patients who permanently discontinued study drug before the end of the study treatment period entered 
a non-treatment, follow-up phase, in which patients followed their visit schedules with modified 
assessments until study completion. Discontinued patients were not replaced. 
Glycaemic rescue was permitted in the study. Rescued patients were to continue treatment on study 
drug.

a.  Eight weeks: sulfonylureas, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, metiglinide, oral or injectable 
incretins or incretin mimetics or other diabetic medications not otherwise specified 
b.  Sixteen weeks: thiazolidinediones 
c.  Any previous history or current use of an SGLT2 inhibitor, including dapagliflozin 
5.  Initiation or discontinuation of prescription or non-prescription weight loss drugs within 8 weeks

study. 
Medical history and concurrent diseases 
6.  History of unstable or rapidly progressive renal disease 
7.  History of unresolved vesico-ureteral reflux 
Treatments 
Study drug was either dapagliflozin or matching placebo: 
Dapagliflozin: Film-coated tablets containing placebo matching dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
Placebo: Film-coated tablets containing placebo matching dapagliflozin 10 mg.  
Background medication 
Patients were expected to be on background medication of metformin (IR or XR) and/or insulin.  
Rescue medication 
During the course of the trial, patients may have required the addition of open-label rescue medication to 
their blinded treatment regimen in order to treat ongoing hyperglycaemia. Insulin was initiated or up-
titrated for glycaemic rescue. Rescue medication was not provided by the Sponsor in this study. 
Prespecified rescue criteria (Table 1) were established during the treatment period, starting at Day 1, and 
up to the Week 52 visit, to determine eligibility for open-label rescue medication. For patients on baseline 
insulin, persistently increased doses of insulin 20% or more above baseline dose, despite advice and 
counsel to keep the insulin dose stable, could be considered another potential manifestation of poor 
glycaemic control, and were to be evaluated for rescue. Any permanent changes in dose of basal insulin 
were to be made after evaluation of rescue criteria, including both SMBG and central laboratory FPG 
values.

Objectives 
The primary and secondary efficacy objectives and their associated endpoints for the initial double-blind, 
24-week treatment period are summarised in Table 2. 
The primary objective was to compare the mean change from baseline in HbA1c achieved with 
dapagliflozin against the mean achieved with placebo after 24 weeks of double-blind add-on treatment in 
patients aged 10 to less than 25 years with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control on diet and 
exercise with metformin or insulin ± metformin. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and secondary efficacy objectives were assessed at Week 24, but also exploratively at 
Week 52, to assess the long-term trend of glycaemic control with dapagliflozin.

Sample size 
Given the anticipated challenges to recruitment with this population, a partial extrapolation from adult 
data was used to better inform the sample size determination. Simulation was used to estimate the 
difference versus placebo for the Week 24 change from baseline in HbA1c, and was -0.78% for 
dapagliflozin. Based on an estimated treatment difference of 0.78% and assuming a SD of 0.9% for 
change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24, a sample size of 25 per treatment group would provide 85% 
statistical power to demonstrate the superiority of dapagliflozin to placebo (where superiority was defined 
as a difference in placebo-corrected mean HbA1c at 24 weeks indicating improvement that is statistically 
significant) at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%. To ensure that at least 50 patients would have Week 24 
assessments while on treatment, at least 66 patients (33 patients per treatment group) were planned to 
be randomised (Protocol Amendment 3). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 blinded treatment groups by the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomisation was stratified by gender, age (< 18 vs. ≥ 18 years and ≤ 15 years vs. > 15 to < 18 
years) and baseline medication (metformin alone vs. insulin ± metformin). 
Blinding 
Methods used to ensure blinding included 
- 
- 
- 
Investigational product was labelled using a unique material kit ID, which is linked to the 
randomization code. 
The IWRS assigned the bottle of study material to be dispensed to each patient. 
The study had a double-blind design, wherein each patient received either the active drug or 
matching placebo, being both active drug and placebo tablets identical and presented in identical 
packaging to ensure blinding of the medication. 
Statistical methods 
A database lock of the 24-week data occurred on 02 April 2020 and the data were unblinded. A review of 
the results revealed that some relevant protocol deviations related to treatment compliance had not been 
correctly captured. Therefore, the 24-week ST database was unlocked on 08 May 2020 to correct the 
protocol deviations and subsequently re-locked on 11 May 2020. The updates were made only on the 
system that holds the protocol deviations, whereas the Week 24 data in the clinical data management 
system were not unlocked for this update. The final database lock was on 18 May 2020. 
A comprehensive SAP was prepared prior to first patient randomised and any subsequent amendments 
were documented, with final amendments completed prior to the 24-week database lock. 
Analysis sets 
The Full analysis subjects data set (FAS) consisted of all patients who were randomised and assigned to a 
treatment group through the IXRS. This data set was used for efficacy analysis. Whenever using the FAS, 
patients are presented in the treatment group to which they were randomised. 
The Per protocol (PP) subjects data set was a subset of the FAS, with all data points collected after 
relevant protocol deviations were excluded from the data set. This data set was used for sensitivity

analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint when > 10% of patients in either treatment group had relevant 
protocol deviations that led to complete exclusion from efficacy analyses. Whenever using the PP subjects 
data set, the patients are presented using the randomised treatment group. 
Efficacy analysis methods 
The main research hypothesis was: dapagliflozin results in a greater mean reduction from baseline in 
HbA1c compared with placebo after 24 weeks of double-blind add-on treatment in patients aged ≥ 10 to 
< 25 years with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise with metformin or 
insulin ± metformin. 
The primary analysis of the primary variable was based on a MMRM, as described in the SAP, including all 
scheduled time points following randomisation up to and including Week 24. This model included patients 
in the FAS (see Section 9.8.2.3) who had a baseline measurement and at least one post-baseline 
measurement. The primary analysis only included measurements prior to the administration of rescue 
medication or permanent discontinuation from study drug. Point estimates and 95% CIs for the least 
square mean change in HbA1c for each treatment group, as well as the difference in the estimated mean 
change between the dapagliflozin treatment group and placebo, were calculated. The p-value of the 
difference in Week 24 estimates between dapagliflozin and placebo was presented. 
Sensitivity analyses 
To assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis for the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 
24, additional sensitivity analyses were carried out using the following approaches: 
•  A longitudinal repeated measures analysis, similar to the primary analysis, but using all 
available data, ie, regardless of rescue therapy initiation or discontinuation from the study 
drug. 
• 
If at least 10 percent of patients in either treatment group had relevant protocol 
deviations leading to complete data exclusion from the ST period, then a longitudinal 
repeated measures analysis similar to the primary analysis were to be performed using 
the Per Protocol Subjects Data Set.  
•  Multiple imputation based on “copy to reference” method were to be performed. This 
method included all subjects from the FAS. 
•  Tipping point analysis including all subjects from the FAS. All the observations were to be 
included regardless of rescue therapy initiation or permanent discontinuation from study 
drug. 
•  ANCOVA analysis including all subjects from the FAS who have a baseline assessment. 
Week 24 observations were to be imputed using LOCF or BOCF methodology as 
appropriate. 
Post hoc analyses were performed which repeated the primary efficacy analysis after excluding a single 
change from baseline value from HbA1c analyses that corresponded to the Week 16 assessment from one 
patient. 
Type I error control 
The family-wise Type I error level related to the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints was controlled 
at the 2-sided 0.05 level by using a hierarchical closed testing procedure. 
For comparison of dapagliflozin versus placebo, if the primary variable was significant, the statistical tests 
for the secondary efficacy endpoints were to be performed in the following order; the change from 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021

baseline in FPG at Week 24; the percentage of patients who required glycaemic rescue medication or who 
permanently discontinued treatment due to lack of glycaemic control over 24 weeks of double-blind 
treatment period; the percentage of patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% who achieved HbA1c level < 7% 
at Week 24. 
For exploratory endpoints no multiplicity procedure was used, and no claims were to be made. Although 
all patients received open-label dapagliflozin during the LT period, results are presented by randomised 
treatment assigned.

Figure 2: Patient Disposition (Full Analysis Subjects Set) 
All randomised patients received study drug, and 82.1% (32/39) and 75.8% (25/33) patients in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, remained on study drug throughout the ST period. It is 
noted that 1 patient in the dapagliflozin group and 2 patients in the placebo group discontinued study 
drug during the ST period, but entered the LT period. 
There were no imbalances between treatments with regards to permanent discontinuations from study 
drug or withdrawal from study that were considered to have a potential influence on the results or their 
interpretation.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted from 22 June 2016 (first patient enrolled) to 06 Apr 2020 (last patient last visit) 
in Hungary, Israel, Mexico, Romania, Russia, United Kingdom and US. A total of 168 patients (with 13 re-
screened patients) were enrolled and 72 were randomised: 39 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 33 
patients in the placebo group. 
By region, 32 (44.4%) patients were randomised in North America (US), 24 (33.3%) patients in Europe 
(including Israel with 13 patients, 9 in Russia, and 2 in Hungary), and 16 (22.2%) patients in Latin 
America (Mexico). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Three important amendments were made to the original study protocol. 
Amendment made before the start of patient recruitment: 
1.  Protocol Amendment 01 (15 January 2016) was made to incorporate new safety information 
related to DKA. 
Amendments made after the start of patient recruitment: 
2.  With Protocol Amendment 02 (13 February 2017), the protocol was amended to reflect the end of 
Bristol-Myers Squibb’s role in the study as of 31 December 2016. The duration of the screening 
period was extended, and details relating to the masking of spot urine glucose, the study weeks 
relating to lack of glycaemic control criteria for initiation of rescue medication, and the use of 
third-party vendors for lost to follow-up patients were clarified. 
3.  With Protocol Amendment 03 (20 September 2017), the number of patients randomised in the 
study was increased to ensure that at least 50 patients would complete the 24-week double-blind 
ST period on study drug and the Week 24 assessment.

•  Change from baseline in HbA1c (%) at 
Week 24 - Tipping-point analysis regardless 
of rescue medication initiation or 
discontinuation from study drug (FAS) 
Protocol deviations 
Of the 72 patients who received randomised treatment, 16.7% (12/72) of patients had at least one 
relevant deviation during the ST period, which led to complete data exclusion from the analyses based on 
the PP subjects set: 12.8% (5/39) of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 21.2% (7/33) of patients in 
the placebo group. The most common reason for complete exclusion was low treatment compliance (< 
80%): 12.8% (5/39) of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 18.2% (6/33) patients in the placebo 
group. In the placebo group, 1/33 patients (3.0%) had a relevant deviation leading to complete exclusion 
for not satisfying the target population baseline anti-hyperglycaemic therapy requirement. 
During the 56-week study, important protocol deviations were reported in 95.8% (69/72) of patients: 
94.9% (37/39) of patients in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group and 97.0% (32/33) in the 
placebo/dapagliflozin group. The most common protocol deviation categories were again safety 
assessment (91.7% [66/72]) followed by study drug (38.9% [28/72]) and informed consent (37.5% 
[27/72])

Upon review of the data after unblinding of the 24-week data, one patient in the dapagliflozin group was 
found with a severe protocol deviation and should have been assigned to discontinuation from study drug, 
which would have resulted in an omission of a single change from baseline value from the primary 
analysis. The primary efficacy analysis was repeated post hoc with the exclusion of the single post-
baseline (Week 16) HbA1c value for this patient. According to the narrative, the patient had been off 
study drug for at least 6 weeks, although treatment compliance is unknown because the patient did not 
return the tablet bottles. A pre-dose PK sample at week 16 showed a non-detectable level of 
dapagliflozin, confirming that the patient was off study drug at the visit.  
Treatment compliance 
Overall mean (SD) compliance during the ST period was 94.03% (17.34) and median compliance was 
98.85%, ranging from 4.2% to 140.0%. The majority of the patients (83.3% [60/72]) had compliance 
between 80% and 120%, and this percentage was higher for dapagliflozin (87.2% [34/39] of patients) 
than for placebo (78.8% [26/33] of patients). 
Relevant protocol deviations of low treatment compliance (< 80%) that resulted in complete exclusion 
from the PP efficacy analysis were reported in 15.3% (11/72) of patients (see above). 
Overall mean (SD) compliance during the ST + LT periods was 91.89% (17.25) and median compliance 
was 97.35%, ranging from 4.2% to 140.0%. The majority of the patients (77.8% [56/72]) had 
compliance between 80% and 120%, and this was higher among patients who received 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin during the ST + LT periods (82.1% [32/39] of patients) than among those who 
received placebo/dapagliflozin (72.7% [24/33] of patients). 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics 
The demographic characteristics of study patients are summarised in Table 4. Overall mean age was 16.1 
years (ranging from 11 to 24 years), with the majority (73.6%) of patients being 10 to 17 years of age. 
There were more female (59.7%) than male patients (40.3%).  
Overall, there were more patients from the non-Europe regions (44.4% from North America and 22.2% 
from Latin America) than from the Europe region (33.3%), and the proportion of patients from the 
Europe region was higher in the dapagliflozin group (41.0%) than in the placebo group (24.2%).

Patient characteristics 
The baseline patient characteristics are summarised in Table 5. Mean measured baseline BMI was 32.38 
kg/m2, and most patients (62.5%) had a baseline BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Mean standardised baseline BMI (z-
score) was 1.756, with the majority of patients (62.5%) assessed as obese according to the 2000 CDC 
growth charts. 
Clinical data for the 9 patients with low BMI (< 25 mg/kg2) were reviewed by the Medical Monitors for 
confirmation of correct diagnosis of T2DM.

Disease characteristics 
Diabetes-related characteristics are summarised in Table 6. Mean duration of T2DM at screening was 3.12 
(0.2 – 12 years). In the majority of patients (59.7%), the duration was < 3 years.  
HbA1c at screening was between 6.5% and 11% in all randomised patients, with a mean value of 8.06%. 
At baseline 9.7% of patients had HbA1c values < 6.5% and 2.8% patients had HbA1c values 11%. The 
majority of patients (61.1%) had baseline HbA1c values < 8%, and the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.90%. 
FPG at screening was ≤14.2 mmol/L (≤255 mg/dL) in all randomised patients, with a mean value of 8.23 
mmol/L. At baseline 8.3% of patients had FPG values > 14.2 mmol/L. Mean baseline FPG was 8.94 
mmol/L.

Background diabetic medication was metformin alone for the majority of patients (51.4%), followed by 
insulin + metformin (31.9% of patients). The proportion of patients with metformin alone was lower in 
the dapagliflozin group (43.6%) compared with the placebo group (60.6%), whereas the proportion of 
patients with insulin + metformin was higher in the dapagliflozin group (38.5%) compared with the 
placebo group (24.2%). Insulin alone was the background diabetic medication in 16.7% of patients 
overall, with a similar percentage in the treatment groups.

Concomitant medication 
Concomitant medications during the ST period are summarised in Table 8. The treatment groups were 
well balanced regarding the use of current medications, which were reported for all patients in the treated 
subjects set. Apart from metformin and insulins and analogues, that are described below, the most 
common current medications were vitamin D and analogues (19.4% [14/72] of patients).

Concomitant insulin and non-insulin diabetic medication use at randomisation are summarised in Table 9 
and Table 10, respectively.  
The number of patients with concomitant insulin treatment was higher in the dapagliflozin group (56.4% 
[22/39] of patients) compared with the placebo group (42.4% [14/33] of patients). Overall, the most 
commonly used insulin was long-acting insulins (33.3% [24/72] of patients) followed by rapid-acting 
insulin (29.2% [21/72] of patients). Rapid-acting insulin was more commonly used in the dapagliflozin 
group (35.9% [14/39] of patients) than in the placebo group (21.2% [7/33] of patients); no remarkable 
differences between the treatment groups were observed in the use of long-acting insulin. 
The use of background metformin was balanced between the treatment groups.

Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets and the number of patients in each analysis set are summarised in Table 11. All 
decisions on the inclusion or exclusion of patients from analyses were to be made while the data were still 
blinded before database lock. However, corrections on protocol deviations that impacted the PP subjects 
set were made after unblinding. A total of 72 patients were randomised and received at least one dose of 
study drug and were, therefore, included in the FAS and in the treated subjects set: 39 patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 33 patients in the placebo group. 
In total, 60 (83.3%) patients were included in the PP subjects set: 34 (87.2%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin group and 26 (78.8%) patients in the placebo group; reasons for exclusion were relevant 
protocol deviations. 
Of the 39 patients treated with dapagliflozin, 35 were included in the PK data set, and the 4 patients that 
were excluded did not contribute at least one PK sample (3 patients discontinued the study before Week 
16 and 1 patient missed the Week 16 visit and discontinued before Week 24).

[a] An individual subject could have been excluded for more than 1 reason. The Full analysis subjects set 
will consist of all randomized subjects randomized by IXRS.  
The Per Protocol subjects set will be a subset of the Full analysis subjects set, excluding subjects with 
relevant protocol deviations that lead to a complete exclusion.  
The Treated subjects set will consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication 
during the treatment period.  
The pharmacokinetic analysis set will include all patients who received a dapagliflozin dose and have 
collected at least 1 PK sample. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 
A summary of the change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 is presented in Table 12. A line plot of the 
adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c over the ST period for each treatment is displayed in 
Figure 3.  
At Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline (LS mean) in HbA1c was -0.25% and 0.50% in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, resulting in a difference of -0.75% (SE 0.45; 95% CI -
1.65 to 0.15)

Figure 3 shows the adjusted mean HbA1c values for each treatment with time. The difference in HbA1c 
was present at 4 weeks and was sustained through Week 24. Values after rescue medication initiation or 
premature treatment discontinuation were excluded. The separation from placebo was maintained during 
this period but the 95% CI became wider over time.

The proportion of patients who required glycaemic rescue or permanent treatment discontinuation due to 
lack of glycaemic control over the 24 weeks of double-blind add-on treatment was numerically smaller in 
the dapagliflozin group (5.1% [2/39] of patients) compared with placebo (9.1% [3/33] of patients), and 
was quantified in their difference (difference in proportion -3.96%; 95% CI -20.11 to 9.62) 
Patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% who achieved HbA1c level < 7% at Week 24 
The proportion of patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% who achieved HbA1c level < 7% at Week 24 was 
larger in the dapagliflozin group (25.0% [7/28] of patients) than that in the placebo group (4.2% [1/24] 
of patients), and was quantified in their difference (difference in proportion 20.83%; 95% CI 0.50 to 
41.11; nominal p value = 0.056). Despite the low number of patients, the proportion of patients with 
baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% achieving HbA1c < 7% at Week 24 was 5 times higher with dapagliflozin than 
placebo. 
Exploratory variables 
Change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 
A summary of the change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 is presented in Table 16. A line plot of the 
adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c during the 52-week ST + LT period is displayed in Figure 
5. 
An increase from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment was observed in the both 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups (adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 52 (LS mean) 0.25% and 0.38%, respectively).

A summary of the change from baseline in FPG at Week 52 is presented in Table 17. A line plot of the 
adjusted mean change from baseline in FPG during the ST + LT periods is displayed in Figure 6. 
An increase from baseline in FPG after 52 weeks of treatment was observed in both 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups (adjusted mean changes from baseline to 
Week 52 (LS mean) 0.25% and 1.06%, respectively).

The proportion of patients who required glycaemic rescue or permanent treatment discontinuation due to 
lack of glycaemic control over the ST + LT periods were similar for the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin groups (adjusted proportion 21.32% and 22.67%; odds ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.28 to

At Week 52, the proportion of patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% who achieved HbA1c level < 7% was 
17.9% (5/28) among patients who received dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin during the 52-week ST +LT period, 
compared with 0/24 among those who received placebo/dapagliflozin (Table 27). 
When the analysis was performed independently of baseline HbA1c values, the proportion of patients who 
achieved HbA1c level < 7% at Week 52 was greater for those who received dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin 
during the ST +LT period (35.9% [14/39]) than for those who received placebo/dapagliflozin (9.1% 
[3/33]).

Notes 
3.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study D1690C00017 was a prospective, multicentre, 24-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
randomised study (ST period) with a 28-week open-label active treatment extension (LT period). This 
pivotal Phase 3 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in children with 
T2DM and to test the hypothesis that treatment with dapagliflozin results in a greater mean reduction 
from baseline in HbA1c compared with placebo. 
A single dose of 10 mg (the approved dose for adults in the EU) was selected on the basis of the PK/PD 
study D1690C00016 (MB102091) results.  
The study patients were children and young adults aged 10 to 24 years and with a confirmed diagnosis of 
T2DM. According to the applicant, young adults aged 18 to 24 years were included due to recruitment 
challenges in the target population (although the number of patients was limited to less than 40% of 
patients, to ensure that the study population would adequately represent the target population).

Background treatment included diet and exercise as well as a stable dose of metformin, insulin or a 
combination of both for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to screening.  
The overall design of the study as well as the study duration were adequate. The selection of patients was 
adequate, in order to recruit a representative study population. The exclusion criteria included 
concomitant medications and conditions that might have rendered the interpretation of data difficult. 
Other exclusion criteria were in place to for the safety of the patients. Of note, previous or concomitant 
use of SGLT-2 inhibitors was prohibited, whereas previous use of thiazolidinediones and GLP-1 RA was 
allowed, after a washout period. 
Dapagliflozin was given in accordance with the recommendations in the SmPC for Forxiga/ Edistride. 
Rescue medication (addition or up-titration of insulin regime) was allowed, according to prespecified 
rescue criteria.  
The primary objective was to compare the mean change from baseline in HbA1c achieved with 
dapagliflozin against the mean achieved with placebo after 24 weeks of double-blind add-on treatment in 
patients aged 10 to less than 25 years with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control on diet and 
exercise with metformin or insulin ± metformin.  
Secondary endpoints included FPG, the percentage of patients requiring rescue treatment and the 
percentage of patients with baseline HbA1c > 7% who achieve a HbA1c level < 7%.  
The primary and secondary efficacy objectives were assessed at Week 24, but also exploratively at Week 
52, to assess the long-term trend of glycaemic control with dapagliflozin.  
Primary and secondary endpoints were adequate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 168 patients (with 13 re-screened patients) were enrolled in 7 countries and 72 were 
randomised: 39 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 33 patients in the placebo group (24 (33.3%) 
patients in Europe). Demographics and patient characteristics were generally balanced between study 
groups. Most patients (62.5%) were obese, with an average baseline BMI of 32.38 kg/m2. There was a 
high spread of the body weight data but the MAH has provided additional analyses that indicate that the 
outcome is not affected by body weight. 
The disease-related characteristics at screening were representative of the paediatric and young adult 
population of patients with T2DM in clinical practice. Mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.90%, with 13% of 
patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6% in the placebo group having an HbA1c of < 6.5%. The mean 
FPG was 8.94 mmol/L at baseline. Baseline eGFR was similar between groups. 
Overall, the number of patients with concomitant insulin treatment was higher in the dapagliflozin group 
(56.4% [22/39] of patients) compared with the placebo group (42.4% [14/33] of patients). The 
combination of metformin and insulin at baseline was more frequent in the dapagliflozin group (38.5%) 
vs placebo (24.2) whereas metformin alone was more frequent in the placebo group (60% vs 44% 
dapagliflozin). Mean doses of metformin and/or insulin were similar between study groups. 
Compliance was high (>90%) and similar between study groups during both the randomized and the 
safety follow-up phase.  
The study did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint, although there was a numerical difference 
favouring dapagliflozin. At Week 24, the adjusted mean change from baseline (LS mean) in HbA1c was -
0.25% and 0.50% in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, resulting in a difference of -
0.75% (SE 0.45; 95% CI -1.65 to 0.15).

Five pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed. Among those, the multiple imputation based on 
“copy to reference” method and the tipping point analysis do not rely on the MAR assumption. Those are 
considered most relevant. 
The post-hoc analysis performed with one single patient excluded cannot be accepted since this was 
performed after unblinding and with full knowledge of results on both individual and group level. 
None of the secondary endpoints at week 24 were statistically significant. A numerical reduction from 
baseline in mean FPG was observed in the dapagliflozin group compared with a numerical increase in the 
placebo group. The difference was more pronounce after 4 weeks as compared to week 24, where the 
FPG in the dapagliflozin group had returned to baseline values. The proportion of patients who required 
glycaemic rescue or permanent treatment discontinuation due to lack of glycaemic control over the 24 
weeks of double-blind add-on treatment was numerically smaller in the dapagliflozin group (5.1% [2/39] 
of patients) compared with placebo (9.1% [3/33] of patients). The proportion of patients with baseline 
HbA1c ≥ 7% achieving HbA1c < 7% at Week 24 was higher with dapagliflozin than placebo (25.0% 
[7/28] dapagliflozin vs 4.2% [1/24] placebo). 
The mean difference in HbA1c between study groups (dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin) decreased at week 52, as compared to Week 24. A decrease from baseline in 
HbA1c and FPG after 52 weeks of treatment was observed in both dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin groups. The proportion of patients who required glycaemic rescue or permanent 
treatment discontinuation due to lack of glycaemic control over the ST + LT periods were similar for the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups. Along the course of the whole study (ST+LT 
period) fewer patients achieved an HbA1c < 7% among those switched from placebo to dapagliflozin as 
compared to patients who were treated with dapagliflozin throughout the whole study. 
A numerical improvement in dapagliflozin-treated patients over placebo in HbA1c was consistent across 
race, sex, baseline HbA1c, and background medication subgroups. A subgroup analysis by the age groups 
10-18 years and >18 years for the primary endpoint was provided. The analysis show that the outcome 
was in favour in both age groups, however interpretation has to be made with caution due to the small 
size of the study. 
3.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The effect of dapagliflozin on the primary endpoint (mean change from baseline in HbA1c vs placebo) was 
not statistically significant, although there was a numerical difference favouring dapagliflozin. The study 
also failed to meet the secondary objectives. Thus, the findings are uncertain and cannot fully confirm or 
support the PK/PD data available. However, the study does not contradict the extrapolation model and 
the totality of data points in favour of effect of dapagliflozin. 
3.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin has been well established in adults with T2DM as well as patient with 
HFrEF and CKD. 
In paediatric T2DM patients, safety and tolerability data from 2 clinical studies support this submission: 
the pivotal paediatric study (MB102138 /D1690C00017) in children aged 10 to 17 years (and young 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 52/76 
 
 
 
 
 
adults aged 18 to 24 years) with T2DM, with a 24-week randomised, placebo-controlled part and a 28-
week open-label safety extension during which all patients received dapagliflozin. 
The applicant has also presented supportive safety data from the Phase 1 PK/PD single-dose study in 
children aged 10 to 17 years and with T2DM (D1690C00016 (MB102091)). As no relevant safety finding 
arouse from this single dose study, the clinical safety assessment is mainly based on the pivotal 
paediatric study D1690C00017 (MB102138). 
Patient exposure 
Overall, 90 paediatric T2DM patients were exposed to at least 1 dose of dapagliflozin, of whom 24 
patients were exposed to 1 dose of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
study D1690C00016 (MB102091), and 66 patients were exposed to at least 1 dose of 10 mg in study 
D1690C00017 (MB102138) (including 39 patients in the dapagliflozin group during the ST period and 27 
patients in the placebo/dapagliflozin group in the LT period). 
Of the 72 randomised patients, 34 (87.2%) and 27 (81.8%) patients completed the ST period in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, and 60 (83.3%) patients entered the LT period, including 
33 (84.6%) patients who had previously received dapagliflozin and 27 (81.8%) patients who had 
previously received placebo. 
Exposure During the 24-week Double-blind Period 
All 72 randomised patients received at least 1 dose of study drug during the 24-week double-blind ST 
treatment period and were included in the treated subjects set. The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 
longer in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group (156.0 days [37.7] and 141.3 days 
[55.3], respectively); median exposure was 168 days in both treatment groups (Table 20). The duration 
of exposure was 16.7 and 12.8 patient-years in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively.

Exposure During the 52-week Short-term Plus Long-term Period 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group was 308.4 (107.8) days, with 
a total duration of exposure of 32.9 patient-years. 
In the placebo/dapagliflozin group, in which patients switched from double-blind placebo to open-label 
dapagliflozin during the open-label (LT) period, the mean (SD) duration of exposure to dapagliflozin was 
188.1 (40.6) days, with a total duration of exposure of 12.9 patient-years. Overall, the duration of 
exposure to dapagliflozin 10 mg was 45.8 patient-years, which is considered as adequate for the 
evaluation of safety during the ST + LT treatment period in this study.  
Of the 30 patients treated with dapagliflozin for the entire 52-week duration of the study (ie, 24-week 
randomised treatment + 28 week-open-label, uncontrolled treatment period), 29 patients were exposed 
for > 350 days. Of the 27 patients randomised to placebo and (subsequently) treated with dapagliflozin 
for the 28 week-open-label, uncontrolled treatment period, 24 patients were exposed for at least 351 
days. 
Adverse events 
Overall adverse events during the 24-week double-blind period 
Overall AEs during the 24-week double-blind treatment period regardless rescue medication are

patients reported at least 1 AE, whereas only 1 (2.6%) patient had an AE leading to discontinuation of 
study drug (occurring during the 24-week double-blind treatment period). Two [5.1%]) patients reported 
an SAE (1 during the 24-week double-blind period, and 1 during the 28-week open-label period), and 
none of these were considered related to study drug by the investigator.  
Among the 33 patients randomised to placebo during the 24-week double-blind period and were switched 
to dapagliflozin treatment for the 28-week open-label period, 23 patients (69.7%) reported at least 1 AE 
and 3 patients (9.1%) reported an SAE over the entire course of the study. None of the reported SAEs 
was considered related to the study drug by the investigator. 
No SAEs of hypoglycaemia or DKA and no deaths were reported during the study.

Common Adverse Events 
Adverse events during the 24-week double-blind period 
The most common AEs (reported by > 5% of patients) during the 24-week double-blind period are 
presented in Table 23.  
In the dapagliflozin group, the most common AEs were headache, nasopharyngitis, and vitamin D 
deficiency (10.3%); nausea and oropharyngeal pain (7.7%); and cough, diarrhoea, viral gastroenteritis, 
hypertension, streptococcal pharyngitis, sinus congestion, urinary tract infection, vomiting, and increased 
weight (5.1%). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache and hyperglycaemia (9.1%); 
and diarrhoea, hypertriglyceridaemia, and toothache (6.1%).  
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, the majority of the reported AEs occurred prior to 
rescue medication initiation: 66.7% (26/39) of patients reported 65 AEs in the dapagliflozin group and 
54.5% (18/33) of patients reported 60 AEs in the placebo group.  
Among the most common AEs according to the known safety profile of dapagliflozin in adults, only urinary 
tract infections were reported as a common AE (> 5% of patients) in this study, with a similar incidence 
in both treatment groups (5.1% and 3.0% in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively).

Adverse events during the 52-week short-term plus long-term period 
The most common AEs (> 5% of patients) during the 52-week ST + LT treatment period are presented in 
Table 24. In the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group, the most common AEs were headache, 
nasopharyngitis, and vitamin D deficiency (12.8% [5/39] of patients); oropharyngeal pain (10.3% [4/39] 
of patients); nausea and urinary tract infection (7.7% [3/39] of patients); and back pain, cough, 
diarrhoea, dyslipidaemia, fatigue, fungal infection, viral gastroenteritis, hypertension, pain in extremity, 
streptococcal pharyngitis, rash, sinus congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, and weight 
increased (5.1% [2/39] of patients).  
The most common AEs in the placebo/dapagliflozin group were headache and hyperglycaemia (12.1% 
[4/33] of patients); hypertriglyceridaemia (9.1% [3/33] of patients); and cough, diarrhoea, 
microalbuminuria, toothache, and pharyngotonsillitis (6.1% [2/33] of patients).

All AEs of vitamin D deficiency were mild and considered not related to the study drug by the 
Investigator. It is noted that vitamin D deficiency was reported as a medical history condition in 15 
patients (20.5% [8/39] of patients in the dapagliflozin group and 21.2% [7/33] of patients in the placebo 
group; most of whom had concomitant treatment with vitamin D/analogues during the study, and none of 
them had an AE of vitamin D deficiency or decrease during the study. 
During the 52-week ST + LT treatment period prior to rescue medication, the majority of the reported 
AEs occurred prior to rescue medication initiation: 71.8% (28/39) of patients reported 92 AEs in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group and 66.7% (22/33) of patients had 87 AEs in the placebo/dapagliflozin 
group.

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Hepatic Adverse Events 
Hepatic AEs were reported in 2 patients during study D1690C00017: 1 patient in the dapagliflozin group 
had an AE of increased AST during the double-blind ST period (although no AST values were reported as 
marked laboratory abnormality during the study), and 1 patient in the placebo/dapagliflozin group had an 
AE of increased ALT during the LT period. None of these events was identified as a potential liver-injury 
case 
Diabetic Ketoacidosis Events 
No events of DKA were reported in study D1690C00017.  
Overall, 35 and 27 patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, had at least one self-
monitored blood ketone measurement during the study. Ketone values > 0.6 mmol/L were observed in 
4 (10.3%) and 2 (6.1%) patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, from Week 1 to 
Week 4; 5 (12.8%) and 1 (3.0%) patient after Week 4 to Week 24; 4 (10.3%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group after Week 24 to Week 28; and by 2 (5.1%) and 3 (9.1%) patients in 
the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively, after Week 28 to Week 52. 
Elevations in ketone measurements > 3.8 mmol/L were rare (1 [2.6%] patient in the dapagliflozin group 
in the period after Week 4 to Week 24). None of the elevated values resulted in a confirmed adjudicated 
DKA event. 
Hypoglycaemic Events 
•  Hypoglycaemic events during the 24-week double-blind period 
Hypoglycaemic events according to ADA/ISPAD classifications during the 24-week double-blind treatment 
period regardless of rescue medication initiation are summarised in Table 25. The ISPAD classification 
assesses events in patients with age < 18 years. 
A higher percentage of patients in the dapagliflozin group experienced hypoglycaemic events compared 
with placebo by ADA classification (11 [28.2%] patients in the dapagliflozin group and 6 [18.2%] patients 
in the placebo group) and by ISPAD classification (8 [27.6%] patients and 2 [8.3%] patients, 
respectively) during the 24-week double-blind period.  
Most patients had asymptomatic hypoglycaemia by ADA classification (20.5% and 12.1%, respectively), 
and mild/moderate hypoglycaemia by ISPAD classification (27.6% and 4.2%). Severe hypoglycaemia was 
reported in 2 patients in the dapagliflozin group during the 24-week double-blind treatment period. These 
patients were receiving insulin and metformin as background diabetic medication and had dietary 
indiscretion as contributing factors. None of the hypoglycaemic events was reported as SAE (Table 25) or 
led to discontinuation of study drug.

During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, the majority of hypoglycaemic events occurred in 
patients on insulin medication and/or following insulin as the study medication used for glycaemic rescue, 
including the 2 patients with severe hypoglycaemia. Overall hypoglycaemic events in patients on insulin 
medication and/or following glycaemic rescue medication were reported in 20.5% (8/39) and 15.2% 
(5/33) of patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, by ADA classification, and in 
17.2% (5/29) and 8.3% (2/24), respectively, by ISPAD classification.  
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, the majority of hypoglycaemic events occurred prior 
to rescue medication initiation, including the 2 patients with severe hypoglycaemia. Overall 
hypoglycaemic events prior to rescue medication initiation were reported in 25.6% (10/39) and 18.2% 
(6/33) of patients in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, by ADA classification, and by 
ISPAD classification in 24.1% (7/29) and 8.3% (2/24), respectively, during the 24-week double-blind 
period.

Hypoglycaemic events according to ADA/ISPAD classifications during the 52-week ST + LT treatment 
period regardless of rescue medication initiation are summarised in Table 26. 
The percentage of patients with hypoglycaemic events during the 52-week ST + LT treatment period was 
33.3% (13/39) and 27.6% (9/33) by ADA classification in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively, and 34.5% (10/29) and 20.8% (5/24) by ISPAD classification.  
Most patients had asymptomatic hypoglycaemia by ADA classification (25.6% [10/39] and 21.2% [7/33], 
respectively), and mild/moderate hypoglycaemia (34.5% [10/29] and 16.7% [4/24] by ISPAD 
classification). During the LT treatment period, severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 1 additional patient 
by ADA and ISPAD in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group and 1 additional patient in the 
placebo/dapagliflozin group by ADA. The patient in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group was on 
background metformin and insulin as antidiabetic medication and no contributing factors were reported. 
The patient in the dapagliflozin/placebo group had metformin as background diabetic medication and no 
reported contributing factors. 
None of the hypoglycaemic events was reported as SAE or led to discontinuation of study drug. 
During the 52-week ST + LT treatment period for patients on insulin medication and/or following 
glycaemic rescue medication, the majority of hypoglycaemic events occurred in patients on insulin 
medication and/or following glycaemic rescue medication, including the 3 patients with severe 
hypoglycaemia. Overall hypoglycaemic events, excluding events of hypoglycaemia after rescue 
medication initiation, were reported in 25.6% (10/39) and 15.2% (5/33) of patients in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively, by ADA classification, and by 
ISPAD classification in 24.1% (7/29) and 8.3% (2/24), respectively, during the 52-week ST + LT period. 
During the 52-week ST + LT treatment period, patients on insulin medication and/or following 
administration of insulin for glycaemic rescue experienced the majority of hypoglycaemic events occurring 
during the 52-week ST + LT treatment period. Events in patients on background insulin as an antidiabetic 
medication or rescued with insulin included the 3 patients with severe hypoglycaemia. Overall, 
hypoglycaemia, excluding events after rescue medication initiation, was reported in 28.2% (11/39) and 
27.3% (9/33) of patients in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively, 
by ADA classification, and by ISPAD classification in 27.6% (8/29) and 20.8% (5/24), respectively, during

Deaths 
No deaths were reported in studies D1690C00016 (MB102091) or D1690C00017 (MB102138) 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in the haematology 
parameters, except for slight mean increases in haematocrit and haemoglobin with dapagliflozin. 
The majority of patients had baseline haematocrit and haemoglobin values within normal paediatric 
reference ranges and remained within those ranges over time. There were no individual clinically 
important abnormalities in the haematology parameters. 
Clinical Chemistry 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in any of the clinical 
chemistry parameters. The majority of patients had baseline values within normal paediatric reference 
ranges for the clinical chemistry parameters and remained within those ranges over time.  
Elevations in ALT or AST accompanied by elevations in total bilirubin  
No patients had ALT ≥ 3 × ULN or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN. 
Marked laboratory abnormalities 
During the 24-week double-blind period, the following marked laboratory abnormalities were observed in 
liver function tests: 
•  ALT ≥ 3 × ULN: 3/37 (8.1%) patients in the dapagliflozin group and 1/30 (3.3%) patients in the 
placebo group. For 1 of these patients in the dapagliflozin group, ALT values returned to within the 
normal range, and for the other 3 patients, values were high at baseline and remained high through 
Week 52.

• 
Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN: 2/30 (6.9%) patients in the placebo group. For 1 of these patients, 
values returned to normal and for the other, values remained high through the end of study. 
During the LT period, an additional patient in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group reported ALT 
≥ 3 × ULN. 
The following marked laboratory abnormalities occurred prior to rescue medication initiation: 
•  ALT ≥ 3 × ULN: 3/39 (7.7%) patients in the dapagliflozin group  
• 
Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN: 2/33 (6.7%) patients in the placebo group 
Urine analysis 
The majority of patients had an albumin/creatinine ratio < 3.4 mg/mmol at baseline (82.1% [32/39] in 
the dapagliflozin group and 83.9% [26/31] in the placebo group), and few shifts were observed during 
the study, with no differences between the treatment groups. 
Pregnancy 
One pregnancy was reported during study D1690C00017 in the placebo group, with a positive test result 
at Week 16 that led to discontinuation of study drug. The pregnancy outcome was spontaneous abortion, 
reported as an SAE. 
Growth and Maturation Markers 
In study D1690C00017, no clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were 
observed in any of the growth and maturation markers, and no impact of treatment was observed in the 
growth and maturation markers. 
Particularly, no clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in 25-
hydroxyvitamin D: mean baseline value for the treated population were 48.20 nmol/L in the dapagliflozin 
group and 47.90 nmol/L in the placebo group; at Week 24, mean change from baseline was -0.15 and 
2.25 nmol/L, respectively; and at Week 52, 2.28 and -0.02 nmol/L in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively.  
Bone Biomarkers in Study 
In study D1690C00017, no clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were 
observed in the bone biomarkers, and no impact of treatment was observed in the bone biomarkers. 
In the treated population, mean baseline bone specific alkaline phosphatase values were 28.41 and 33.98 
µg/L in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. At Week 24, mean change from baseline in 
bone specific alkaline phosphatase were -2.78 and -3.29 µg/L, respectively; and at Week 52 were -4.16 
and -6.07 µg/L in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively. Mean 
baseline osteocalcin values were 34.79 and 33.48 µg/L in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 
respectively. At Week 24, mean change from baseline in osteocalcin were -1.75 and 0.52 µg/L, 
respectively; and at Week 52 were -8.37 and -1.11 µg/L in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively. 
Tanner Staging 
In study D1690C00017, a normal progression of sexual maturation was observed over time, as assessed 
by the change from baseline in the percentages of patients at each Tanner stage.

Vital Signs 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in heart rate or blood 
pressure. In particular, mean baseline systolic blood pressure was 119.4 and 118.2 mmHg in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. At Week 24, mean change from baseline in systolic blood 
pressure were -0.3 and 1.6 mmHg, respectively; and at Week 52 were 1.4 and -1.8 mmHg in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively. 
A mild increase in measured height was observed over the course of the study, which was similar in both 
treatment groups. When adjusted for age and sex, no changes from baseline in standardised height (z-
score) were observed at Week 24 (mean change from baseline of 0.014 and -0.029 in the dapagliflozin 
and placebo groups, respectively) or Week 52 (mean change from baseline of 0.013 and -0.012 in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively). Similarly, no notable impact of 
treatment was observed over the course of the study in weight or BMI. The change from baseline in 
standardised weight (z-score) at Week 24 were -0.074 and -0.121 in the dapagliflozin and placebo 
groups, respectively, and at Week 52 were -0.215 and -0.192 in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and 
placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively. The change from baseline in standardised BMI (z-score) at 
Week 24 were -0.077 and -0.113 in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, and at Week 52 
were -0.239 and -0.191 in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively. 
Electrocardiograms 
The majority of patients had a normal ECG at baseline (90.6% [29/32] in the dapagliflozin group and 
76.0% [19/25] in the placebo group), and at Week 24 (90.6% [29/32] and 88.0% [22/25], respectively). 
Similar results were observed at Week 52 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
In study D1690C00017, no remarkable differences by subgroup were observed in the incidence of AEs 
during the ST period or during the 52-week ST + LT treatment period regardless rescue medication. An 
overview of AEs during the 24-week double-blind treatment period and 52-week ST + LT safety follow-up 
period is presented by age, sex, and race regardless of rescue medication initiation in the study report. 
No remarkable differences by subgroup were observed in the incidence of AEs. 
Extrinsic Factors 
In study D1690C00017, no remarkable differences by subgroup were observed in the incidence of AEs by 
diabetic background medication during the 24-week double-blind treatment period or during the 52-week 
ST + LT treatment period regardless of rescue medication. The use of insulin in conjunction with 
dapagliflozin increase the frequency of hypoglycaemia. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study D1690C00017, one AE that led to discontinuation of study drug was reported during the 24-
week double-blind treatment ST period: 1 event of fungal infection (reported as vaginal yeast infection) in 
1 (2.6%) patient in the dapagliflozin group. The AE was considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator. An additional patient was reported as having discontinued study drug due to AE during the 
ST period, but this AE (hyperglycaemia) had a start date during the lead-in period before the first dose of 
study drug. There were no additional reports of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug during the 
(open-label) LT period.

Post marketing experience 
Dapagliflozin was first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in Australia on 05 October 2012 and 
it is currently approved in over 90 countries. Dapagliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
for the treatment of diabetes in adults with T2DM and in the EU and Japan also as an oral adjunct 
treatment to insulin in adults with T1DM.  
The annual dapagliflozin PBRER with data lock 04 October 2019, included approximately 7926295 patient-
years of post-marketing exposure (cumulative until 30 September 2019). At the data lock of the 
dapagliflozin PBRER (04 October 2019), there was no new information to alter the overall positive benefit-
risk profile for dapagliflozin in the approved indications. 
3.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin has been well established in adults with T2DM as well as patient with 
HFrEF and CKD. In paediatric T2DM patients, safety and tolerability data from the pivotal paediatric study 
D1690C00017 (MB102138) in children aged 10 to 24 years support this submission. The Phase 1 PK/PD 
single-dose study D1690C00016 (MB102091) in children aged 10 to 17 years provides supportive safety 
data but no relevant safety findings. 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group was 308.4 (107.8) days, with 
a total duration of exposure of 32.9 patient-years. Few patients have been exposed > 350 days 
(29 patients). Thus, there is a lack of long-term safety data in the paediatric population. 
There were no SAEs of hypoglycaemia or DKA and no deaths in either treatment group during the ST 
treatment period. Few patients reported SAEs (1 dapagliflozin vs 2 placebo) or had AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug (1 dapagliflozin vs 0 placebo). None of the reported SAEs was considered 
related to the study drug by the investigator. 
The number and intensity of AE did not differ significantly between treatment groups during the placebo 
controlled 24 weeks and up to 52 weeks (placebo-controlled and safety follow-up). 
The most common AEs in the dapagliflozin group were headache, nasopharyngitis and vitamin D 
deficiency (10,3%). The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (9.1%) and 
hyperglycaemia, diarrhoea, hypertriglyceridemia and toothache (6.1%). Among the most common AEs 
according to the known safety profile of dapagliflozin in adults, only urinary tract infections were reported 
as a common AE (> 5% of patients) in this study, with a similar incidence in both treatment groups 
(5.1% and 3.0% in placebo).   
No clinically significant differences between study groups in terms of AE were seen up to 52 weeks. All 
AEs of vitamin D deficiency were mild and considered not related to the study drug. Urinary tract 
infections were more common in the dapagliflozin group (3 (7.7%) vs 1 (3.0%) in placebo).  
Elevated ketone measurements were reported during the study in the dapagliflozin group, although 
without clinical relevance. This is in line the known mechanism of action of dapagliflozin and the safety 
profile in adults. None of the elevated values resulted in a confirmed adjudicated DKA event (including a 
case of >3.8 mmol/L (1 patient [2.6%]). 
A higher percentage of patients in the dapagliflozin group experienced hypoglycaemic events compared 
with placebo during the placebo-controlled phase, both according to the ADA criteria (11 [28.2%] 
dapagliflozin group vs 6 [18.2%] in placebo) and by ISPAD classification (up to 18 yo) (8 [27.6%] 
dapagliflozin vs [8.3%] placebo). As expected, these differences fade away during the 52-week ST + LT 
treatment period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 67/76 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 2 patients in the dapagliflozin group during the 24-week double-
blind treatment period. These patients were receiving insulin and metformin and had dietary indiscretion 
as contributing factors. During the LT treatment period, severe hypoglycaemia was reported in 1 
additional patient in the dapagliflozin / dapagliflozin group and 1 additional patient in the placebo/ 
dapagliflozin. The patient in the dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin group was on background metformin and 
insulin as antidiabetic medication and no contributing factors were reported. The patient in the 
dapagliflozin/placebo group had metformin as background diabetic medication and no reported 
contributing factors. 
Thus, the reporting of hypoglycaemias was rather high, but it should be noted that a large proportion of 
the patients were on concomitant insulin treatment. The reporting rates are in line with the rates reported 
in adults concomitantly treated with dapagliflozin and insulin. The risk of hypoglycaemia with concomitant 
use of insulin is already reflected in the SmPC of dapagliflozin. 
No imbalance between study groups was seen concerning SAE. No deaths were reported during the 
study. 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in the haematology 
and clinical chemistry tests. Few cases of increased liver enzymes were reported and none of them were 
considered as clinically significant and were not deemed to require further follow up. 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were neither observed in any of the 
growth and maturation markers (in particular 25-hydroxyvitamin D), nor in bone biomarkers (bone 
specific ALP, osteocalcin). Likewise, a normal progression of sexual maturation was observed over the 
course of the study. 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in heart rate or blood 
pressure. In both treatment groups, a mild increase in measured height was observed over the course of 
the study, as expected.  
In contrast to what has been observed in adults, no notable impact of treatment was observed over the 
course of the study in weight or BMI, neither at 25 nor 52 weeks.  
One patient in the dapagliflozin group discontinued study drug due to fungal infection during the placebo-
controlled period (deemed as drug-related by investigator).  
As the current application concerns the extension of the indication to include patients aged 10-18 years 
whereas the pivotal study included patients aged 10-24 years of age, the MAH has provided the available 
safety data for the age group 10-18 years separately. No differences in the safety profile compared to 
adults is observed but the data is limited. 
Pre-clinical data has previously pointed towards a concern on kidney related AEs due to the observation 
of dilated kidney pelvis in juvenile animal models due to increased urine volume output secondary to 
glucosuria. As discussed by the MAH, the pre-clinical findings are not relevant for the proposed target 
population (patients aged 10-18 years), since in humans the kidney is fully matured by the age of 2 
years. The safety data provided in this application did not observe any imbalances in kidney related AEs, 
nor any signs of decreased kidney function or other urologic AEs.  
3.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin has been well established in adults with T2DM as well as patient with 
HFrEF and CKD. Although exposure data is very limited in the paediatric population, add-on treatment 
with dapagliflozin 10 mg to metformin or insulin ± metformin for up to 52 weeks seems to be well

tolerated in patients aged 10 to 24 years with T2DM. No cases of DKA were reported during the study, 
even though several cases of ketosis without further clinical consequences were reported.  
No new safety concerns were identified in children and young adults from 10 up to 24 years-of-age as 
compared with the established safety profile in adults with T2DM. However, long-term safety data beyond 
52 weeks is lacking. In order to address the long-term safety in the paediatric population (aged 10 years 
and above) receiving dapagliflozin, the week 104 safety follow-up for ongoing study D1680C00019 has 
been included in the RMP as a Category 3 PASS study.

5.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to include 
information  on  the  use  of  dapagliflozin  in  paediatric  patients.  The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  is  updated 
accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
5.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/622203/2021 
Page 71/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The package leaflet recently underwent readability testing in new indication application (WS-1737) to add 
an indication for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The 
package leaflet passed the readability test. With this variation, only minor updates are proposed to the 
package leaflet.  
This is considered acceptable. 
6.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed extension of the indication in T2DM is: 
“Forxiga/ Edistride is indicated in adults and children aged 10 years and above for the treatment of 
insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise  
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance.  
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.” 
The incidence of T2DM in children is increasing worldwide, and the main driver is the increased 
prevalence and degree of childhood obesity. Childhood T2DM is still relatively rare in Europe, with a 
prevalence of approximately 2.5 per 100 thousand. 
Developing T2DM at a younger age is associated with a considerably higher risk of long-term 
cardiovascular disease compared with those who develop T2DM in the middle age. The rapid deterioration 
in glucose regulation in children as compared with adults may contribute to the greater risk for micro- 
and macrovascular complications in children with T2DM as they develop into adults. 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Management of T2DM in children involves lifestyle modifications. Pharmacologic glucose-lowering 
treatment is often necessary and includes metformin or insulin or a combination of both. Recently, a 
GPL1-RA (liraglutide) has been approved for the use in children aged 10 or older. 
There is a need for additional effective, well tolerated and easily administered treatments to achieve and 
maintain target HbA1c levels as early as possible in children with T2DM. 
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study D1690C00017 was a prospective, multicentre, 24-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
randomised study (ST period) with a 28-week open-label active treatment extension (LT period), which 
included patients ≥10 years and < 25 years of age, with confirmed diagnosis of T2DM, who were being 
treated with diet and exercise and a stable dose of metformin, insulin or a combination of both. 
The study patients were children and young adults aged 10 to 24 years and with a confirmed diagnosis of 
T2DM. Young adults aged 18 to 24 years were included due to recruitment challenges in the target 
population (although the number of patients was limited to less than 40% of patients, to ensure that the 
study population would adequately represent the target population). Background treatment included diet

and exercise as well as a stable dose of metformin, insulin or a combination of both for a minimum of 8 
weeks prior to screening. 
The primary objective was to compare the mean change from baseline in HbA1c achieved with 
dapagliflozin against the mean achieved with placebo after 24 weeks of double-blind add-on treatment in 
patients aged 10 to less than 25 years with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control on diet and 
exercise with metformin or insulin ± metformin.  
Secondary endpoints included FPG, the percentage of patients requiring rescue treatment and the 
percentage of patients with baseline HbA1c > 7% who achieve a HbA1c level < 7%.  
The primary and secondary efficacy objectives were assessed at Week 24, but also exploratively at Week 
52, to assess the long-term trend of glycaemic control with dapagliflozin. 
A total of 168 patients (with 13 re-screened patients) were enrolled in 7 countries and 72 were 
randomised: 39 patients in the dapagliflozin group and 33 patients in the placebo group (24 (33.3%) 
patients in Europe). 
Demographics and patient characteristics were generally balanced between study groups. Most patients 
(62.5%) were obese, with an average baseline BMI of 32.38 kg/m2. The disease-related characteristics at 
screening were representative of the paediatric and young adult population of patients with T2DM in 
clinical practice.  
6.2.  Favourable effects 
Favourable effects 
Treatment with dapagliflozin led to point estimate of adjusted mean change from baseline (LS mean) in 
HbA1c of -0.25% and +0.50% in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively at week 24, resulting 
in a treatment difference of -0.75% (95% CI -1.65, 0.15). Thus, dapagliflozin was not superior to placebo 
and therefore, the study did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. However, the numerical difference 
favoured dapagliflozin.  
A numerical reduction from baseline mean FPG was observed in the dapagliflozin group compared with a 
numerical increase in the placebo group.  
The proportion of patients who required glycaemic rescue or permanent treatment discontinuation due to 
lack of glycaemic control was numerically smaller in the dapagliflozin group (5.1% [2/39] of patients) 
compared with placebo (9.1% [3/33] of patients). 
The proportion of patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% achieving HbA1c < 7% at Week 24 was higher with 
dapagliflozin than placebo (25.0% [7/28] dapagliflozin vs 4.2% [1/24] placebo).  
A numerical improvement in dapagliflozin-treated patients over placebo in HbA1c was consistent across 
race, sex, baseline HbA1c, and background medication subgroups. 
The popPK analysis is considered adequate to describe the PK in paediatric patients. The dapagliflozin 
exposure in children 10-17 years is similar to the exposure in adults. This supports that the same dose as 
adults (10 mg) is adequate also for paediatric patients aged of 10-17 years old.  
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study did not meet the primary nor any of the secondary endpoints, as the difference was not 
statistically significant. The limited size of the study, conditioned by the difficulties in recruiting patients,

and the wide variability of the baseline characteristics, may have influence the results of the statistical 
analysis. However, the study does not contradict the extrapolation model and the totality of data points in 
favour of an effect of dapagliflozin. 
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of dapagliflozin has been well established in adults with T2DM as well as patient with 
HFrEF and CKD. In paediatric T2DM patients, safety and tolerability data comes mainly from the pivotal 
paediatric study D1690C00017 in children aged 10 to 17 years. 
A higher percentage of patients in the dapagliflozin group experienced hypoglycaemic events compared 
with placebo during the placebo-controlled phase, both according to the ADA criteria (11 [28.2%] 
dapagliflozin group vs 6 [18.2%] in placebo) and by ISPAD classification (up to 18 yo) (8 [27.6%] 
dapagliflozin vs [8.3%] placebo). No SAE of hypoglycaemia were reported. The majority of 
hypoglycaemias were reported in patients on concomitant treatment with insulin. 
Elevated ketone values > 0.6 mmol/L were observed in 4 (10.3%) and 2 (6.1%) patients in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, from Week 1 to Week 4; 5 (12.8%) and 1 (3.0%) patients 
after Week 4 to Week 24, but no cases of adjudicated DKA were reported. 
AEs of vitamin D deficiency were observed in 5 (12.8%) and 2 (6.1%) patients in the dapagliflozin and 
placebo groups, respectively. All AEs of vitamin D deficiency were mild and considered not related to the 
study drug.  
Urinary tract infections were more common in the dapagliflozin group (3 (7.7%) vs 1 (3.0%) in placebo) 
No clinically meaningful mean changes over the course of the study were observed in any of the growth 
and maturation markers (in particular 25-hydroxyvitamin D), as well as bone biomarkers (bone specific 
ALP, osteocalcin). Likewise, a normal progression of sexual maturation was observed over the course of 
the study.  
The change from baseline in standardised weight (z-score) at Week 24 were -0.074 and -0.121 in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, and at Week 52 were -0.215 and -0.192 in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively.  
The change from baseline in standardised BMI (z-score) at Week 24 were -0.077 and -0.113 in the 
dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively, and at Week 52 were -0.239 and -0.191 in the 
dapagliflozin/dapagliflozin and placebo/dapagliflozin groups, respectively. 
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The current safety database in the target population includes 90 paediatric T2DM patients exposed to at 
least 1 dose of dapagliflozin, of whom 24 patients were exposed to single doses in the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study D1690C00016 (MB102091), and 66 patients who were exposed 
to at least 1 dose of 10 mg in study D1690C00017 (MB102138) (including 39 patients in the dapagliflozin 
group during the ST period and 27 patients in the placebo/dapagliflozin group in the LT period). Thus, the 
safety data set is very limited. Further follow-up of long-term safety in the paediatric population is 
deemed necessary and the RMP has been updated accordingly to include the ongoing study D1680C00019 
as a Category 3 study.

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
T2DM in children is still relatively rare in Europe but is increasing due to increasing childhood obesity. The 
progression of the disease is more rapid in children than in adults and developing T2DM at a younger age 
is associated with a considerably higher risk of long-term cardiovascular disease compared with those 
who develop T2DM in the middle age.  
Treatment options are limited in children as currently only metformin insulin and one GLP-1RA product 
are approved for the use in paediatric patients.

In study D1690C00017 the treatment difference between dapagliflozin and placebo in reduction of HbA1c 
was 0.75%, but since neither the primary nor the secondary endpoints reached statistical significance, 
the data are not robust enough to support on its own the proposed paediatric indication. The lack of 
statistical significance may partly be due to the variability observed in baseline characteristics in the 
study population. It may also be due to an underpowered study due to higher-than-expected variability. 
The SA given by the CHMP in 2014 states that limited clinical data in combination with PK/PD data could 
support an extension of the indication. The popPK analysis is considered adequate to describe the PK in 
paediatric patients. The dapagliflozin exposure in children 10-17 years is similar to the exposure in adults. 
This supports that the same dose as adults (10 mg) is adequate also for paediatric patients aged of 10-17 
years old.  
The MAH has justified that there are no significant differences between the paediatric and adult T2DM 
patients with regards to disease characteristics and pathophysiology, which supports an approval in the 
paediatric population granted based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults to the paediatric patients in 
view of similar systemic exposure and PK/PD relationship of dapagliflozin. 
Thus, the approval of the paediatric indication in this application relies on extrapolation of efficacy data 
from adults to children as well as supportive data from the clinical study since the totality of data points is 
in favour of dapagliflozin and does not contradict the extrapolation model. 
In contrast to what has been observed in adults, no notable impact of treatment was observed over the 
course of the study in weight or BMI, neither at 24 nor 52 weeks. 
The safety database in the paediatric patients is limited both in terms of number of patients exposed as 
well as the exposure time. The data provided generally support a similar safety profile for dapagliflozin in 
paediatric patients as the one known from extensive use of dapagliflozin in adult patients even though 
there was an imbalance in hypoglycaemias. However, long-term safety in the paediatric population needs 
to be followed and an ongoing paediatric study is included in the RMP to address this concern. 
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant glucose lowering effect of dapagliflozin in children aged 10 years and above is 
expected based on extrapolation of results from adults and supportive data from a clinical trial. The 
popPK analysis is considered adequate to describe the PK in paediatric patients and indicates a similar 
exposure in paediatric patients to the exposure in adults. This supports that the same dose as adults (10 
mg) is adequate also for paediatric patients aged of 10-17 years old. This effect is considered to outweigh 
the risks related to dapagliflozin. Therefore, the benefit/risk balance of dapagliflozin in the treatment of 
paediatric patients aged 10 years and above is considered positive. 
6.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
6.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of dapagliflozin in the treatment of paediatric patients aged 10 years and above is 
positive.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for rotigotine, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Analyses of cases of diarrhoea suggested a chronological relationship and, therefore, the MAH was 
requested to conduct a Safety signal assessment report considering ‘Diarrhoea’ as a potential safety 
observation in the next PSUR. Nevertheless, the MAH has already conducted the SSAR and the signal was 
confirmed. The review seems to support the existence of a possible causal association between the 
exposure to rotigotine and the occurrence of diarrhea, based on the data from the cases in the safety 
database. Saturation of a biological system versus an idiosyncratic process is the likely potential 
mechanism by which rotigotine could cause diarrhea. Therefore, the MAH submitted, within this procedure, 
an updated product information to include the adverse reaction “diarrhoea” under SmPC section 4.8 and 
Package Leaflet section 4, with a frequency “not known”.  
Based on the above information, the PRAC considers that an updated of the product information to include 
the adverse reaction “diarrhoea” with a frequency not known was necessary.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for rotigotine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing rotigotine is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

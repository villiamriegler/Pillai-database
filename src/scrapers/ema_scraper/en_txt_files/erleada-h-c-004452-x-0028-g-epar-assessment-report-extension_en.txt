2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Apalutamide is currently commercially available as a film-coated (FC) tablet at a strength of 60 mg. The 
recommended clinical dose of apalutamide is 240 mg (i.e. 4×60 mg FC tablets) administered once daily 
with or without food.  
To reduce the pill burden for patients and enhance compliance a new FC tablet with higher dose strength 
of 240 mg per tablet has been developed with the goal to lower the pill number from 4 tablets per day 
(based on the approved 60 mg tablet) to 1 tablet per day. 
The purpose of this submission is to extend the current Marketing Authorisation (MA) to add a new 
immediate release oral FC tablet containing 240 mg of apalutamide. The proposed clinical use for the 240 
mg film-coated tablet is for the same indications as the one approved for the 60 mg film-coated tablet. 
The lower tablet strength (i.e., 60 mg) will remain registered and available to allow dose reduction as per 
the guidance provided in the product label. 
2.2.  About the product 
Apalutamide is an orally administered selective androgen receptor (AR) that binds directly to the ligand 
binding domain of the AR. Apalutamide prevents AR nuclear translocation, inhibits DNA binding, impedes 
AR mediated transcription, and lacks androgen receptor agonist activity.  
Erleada is approved for the treatment of adult patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. 
The recommended dose is 240 mg (one 240 mg tablet) as an oral single daily dose. 
Multiple 240 mg tablet formulations were developed for clinical evaluation. Formulation G043 was selected 
to be tested in a pivotal bioequivalence trial.   
The following two clinical studies support the new FC tablet formulation: 
•  Study 56021927PCR1027, a formulation selection study which investigated the relative Bioavailability 
(BA) of 240 mg FC tablet formulations compared with the current commercial FC tablets (G023) under 
fasting conditions.  
Based on relative BA Study 56021927PCR1027, formulation G043 was selected for further evaluation 
in  pivotal  Bioequivalence  (BE)  Study  56021927PCR1028.  Study  56021927PCR1027  Part  2  was 
conducted to evaluate the relative BA of apalutamide using the 240 mg FC tablet formulation G043 with 
the intention to aid in the establishment of clinically relevant controls for the proposed commercial drug 
product.  
•  Study 56021927PCR1028 was conducted to evaluate the BE for the new tablet formulation (G043) 
compared with the current commercial 60 mg tablet formulation (G023). In the same study, the BA of 
the new tablet formulation (G043) when administered under fed or fasting conditions was also 
evaluated. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Erleada  (apalutamide,  60mg  film-coated  tablets)  was  initially  approved  in  the  EU  in  adult  men  for  the 
treatment  of  non-metastatic  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer  (nmCRPC)  who  are  at  high  risk  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/317740/2023 
Page 8/39 
 
 
developing metastatic disease on 14 January 2019 and was subsequently approved for the treatment of 
metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) on 27 January 2020.  
This  extension  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  concerns  the  addition  of  a  new  strength  ((240  mg)  film-
coated tablets) for Erleada. The clinical development program, based on two clinical studies, support the 
new FC tablet formulation (see 2.2. for the details of the clinical studies). 
Scientific advice 
The  Applicant  received  scientific  advice  on  the  development  of  apalutamide  for  the  treatment  of  non-
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer from the CHMP on 23/06/2022 (EMA/SA/0000083639). The 
scientific advice pertained to the following quality aspects: 
• The proposed dissolution method to support a line extension application of the 240 mg drug product. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The line extension application concerns the introduction of an additional higher strength of 240 mg to the 
already authorised 60 mg film-coated tablet. 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  an  immediate  release  film-coated  tablet  containing  240  mg  of 
apalutamide as the active substance.  
Other ingredients are: 
 -Tablet core: colloidal anhydrous silica, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose acetate succinate, 
magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose (silicified) 
-Film coating: glycerol monocaprylocaprate, iron oxide black (E172), polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide 
(E171), macrogol poly (vinyl alcohol) grafted copolymer 
The product is available either in transparent PVC-PCTFE film blister with an aluminium push-through foil  
sealed inside a child resistant wallet pack, or white HDPE bottle with child-resistant polypropylene closure 
and induction seal liner containing 2 grams of silica gel desiccant, as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
There are no changes in the active substance (AS) part other than the presentation of the risk 
assessment report on the presence of nitrosamines in the AS under Section 3.2.S.3.2 Impurities. The 
same active substance used for the currently authorised Erleada 60 mg film coated tablet strength is used 
for the new strength 240 mg strength. The outcome of the risk assessment is that there is no risk of 
presence of nitrosamines in apalutamide AS. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is oval shaped, bluish grey to grey film-coated 10 mm width and 21 mm length for 
oral administration, debossed with “E240” on one side and contains 240 mg of apalutamide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/317740/2023 
Page 9/39 
 
 
 
The approved 60 mg strength is oblong shaped, greenish film-coated tablet of 9 mm width x 17 mm length 
for oral administration. The tablet is debossed with “AR 60” on one side and contains 60 mg of apalutamide. 
Therefore, both strengths can be differentiated by colour, shape and debossing. 
The composition of the 240 mg strength is similar to the 60 mg film-coated  tablet  but does not contain 
cellulose microcrystalline.  
The tablet is made from an intermediate which delivers 240 mg of apalutamide per tablet.  
The  AS  is  a  BCS  class  2  (insoluble  in  aqueous  media)  compound  according  to  the  biopharmaceutical 
classification system. The applicant has used enabling technology to improve the bioavailability; this was 
studied during the formulation of Erleada 60 mg tablet. The Applicant refers to the manufacturing process 
development  of  the  intermediate  of  the  60  mg  film-coated  tablet  and  only  the  development  of  the 
downstream process of the 240 mg film-coated tablet is described; this is acceptable. 
The  excipients  used  in  the  proposed  commercial  formulation  are  commonly  used  excipients  and  have 
detailed  monographs  in  relevant  pharmacopoeias  (USP/NF  and  Ph.  Eur.).  The  coating  powder  is  a  non-
compendial excipient; however, its components comply with relevant pharmacopoeias. 
Multiple 240 mg film-coated tablet formulations were developed using enabling technology, as used for the 
commercial 60 mg tablet (G023).  
The  formulations  were  tested  in  a  human  bioavailability  trial  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  and  the 
relative bioavailability compared with 4 tablets of the reference 60 mg reference formulation (G023). Based 
on  the  result  of  this  in  vivo  study,  the  240  mg  formulation  G043  was  selected  to  be  tested  in  a  pivotal 
bioequivalence  trial.  The  pivotal  bioequivalence  study  demonstrated  that  the  proposed  240  mg  G043 
formulation  is  bioequivalent  to  the  already  authorised  60  mg  formulation  (G023)  under  fasted  and  fed 
conditions. 
The dissolution method used for the quality control of the drug product was based on the method for the 
60 mg strength and has been demonstrated to be sufficiently discriminatory. Sink conditions are not met 
for the selected medium, but it is justified because the medium needs to be below sink conditions to achieve 
a sufficiently slow dissolution profile. The use of a surfactant and the amount is also justified. 
The compatibility of the finished product with soft foods and liquids to be administered to the patient, i.e. 
studies orange juice, green tea, yoghourt and applesauce has been sufficiently discussed. The tablet was 
first dispersed in a small amount of water (10 mL) and then mixed with these liquids and soft foods. The 
compatibility was assessed by different testings and the results were in compliance with the specifications. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC contains the information about how to take the product with non-fizzy beverage 
or soft food, in line with the results presented in Module 3. 
The  compatibility  of  the  dispersed  finished  product  with  nasogastric  tubes  of  polyurethane,  silicone  and 
polyvinylchloride was also tested. The tablets were dispersed using water (10 mL) in a 20 mL syringe and 
then  the  content  is  passed  through  the  nasogastric  tubes.  The  compatibility  was  assessed  by  different 
testings and the results were in compliance with the specifications. Also no adsorption of drug product was 
observed on the tube and the prepared dose was freely flowing from the tube while dosing. Section 6.6 of 
the SmPC contains the information to administer the product through a nasogastric feeding tube, in line 
with the results presented in Module 3. 
The  manufacturing  process  development  from  the  intermediate  to  the  final  film-coated  tablet  was 
presented. The quality target product profile (QTPP) for the finished product was defined as an immediate 
release oral film-coated tablet, containing 240 mg of apalutamide, which is bioequivalent to the commercial 
60 mg FC tablet (G023) on an equivalent dose basis. The finished product should have a sufficiently low 
level  of  impurities  and  microbial  burden,  complying  with  the  ICH  requirements,  and  must  meet  its 
specifications over a shelf life of minimum 24 months when packaged in blisters or bottles. The QTTP was 
Assessment report  
EMA/317740/2023 
Page 10/39 
 
 
linked  with  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  that  could  impact  the  quality  of  the  product.  A  number  of 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were also defined for the process steps. 
The container closure system is either transparent PVC-PCTFE film blister with an aluminium push-through 
foil  sealed  inside  a  child-resistant  wallet  pack,  or  white  HDPE  bottle  with  child-resistant  polypropylene 
closure and induction seal liner containing 2 grams of silica gel desiccant.  
Specifications for both containers were presented along with a confirmation that they comply with current 
EU Regulation. The child resistant features of both containers comply with ISO 8317. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
All relevant sites involved in the finished product manufacturing have valid manufacturing authorisations 
and/or valid GMP certificates. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  multistep  process  comprising  preparation  of  intermediate,  pre-blending, 
granulation, post granulation blending and lubrication, film-coating and packaging. 
A detailed step by step description of the manufacturing process has been provided as well as tables with 
information  on  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  and  noncritical  process  parameters  (nCPPs)  with 
operating targets and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) per step. The in process controls are acceptable. 
No design space is claimed. The proposed bulk holding time for film-coated tablets, manufactured at the 
proposed manufacturing site is supported by sufficient stability data.  
The  manufacturing  process  is  validated  and  the  process  validation  summary  report  has  been  provided. 
Three  consecutive  commercial  scale  finished  product  validation  batches  have  been  produced  at  the 
commercial facility. Each batch has been tested appropriately throughout the manufacturing process and 
has  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  consistently  produces  finished  product  meeting  the 
proposed specifications.  
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance  (visual),  identification  (UV,  UHPLC),  assay  (UHPLC),  chromatographic  purity  (UHPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur. -UHPLC), solid state (NIR), water content (KF, 
NIR), and microbial purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification includes the relevant parameters for this type of products (immediate release 
coated tablets). Characterisation, mutagenicity, and toxicological qualification information for the specified 
degradation  product  and  synthesis  impurity  has  been  presented  and  appropriate  limits  are  set  in  the 
specification. The limit for unspecified degradation products has been set in accordance with ICH Q3B and, 
therefore it is also acceptable as is the limit proposed for total impurities. A test for solid state is included 
in the product´s specification and supported by the batch analysis results and the stability data.  
An elemental impurities (EIs) risk assessment was performed on the FP. It can be concluded that none of 
the  elemental  impurities  assessed  are  expected  to  exceed  their  corresponding  control  thresholds  in  the 
finished  product.  Therefore,  the  manufacturing  process  and  analytical  controls  in  place  are  considered 
adequate to assure that the levels of the elemental impurities from various sources in the finished product 
do not exceed the 30% threshold levels of the permitted levels for daily exposure. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the 
CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/317740/2023

human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/409815/2020)  and  the  “European  Medicines  Regulatory  Network 
approach  for  the  implementation  of  the  CHMP  Opinion  pursuant  to  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  Nº 
726/2004  for  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicines  (EMA/425645/2020).  Based  on  the  risk 
assessment conducted, no risk for presence of, or formation of, nitrosamines is identified for apalutamide 
240 mg film-coated tablet. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated. The same reference standards 
and materials used for the testing of apalutamide AS are used for the testing of the finished product. the 
information regarding the reference standards is satisfactory. 
All batches used in the clinical trials described in this dossier are presented in this section, including 60 mg 
apalutamide batches, which were used as a reference. 
Batch analysis results for 10 batches of the 240 mg strength used throughout development were 
presented. All results comply well with the proposed specifications and are consisted also with the 60 mg 
tablets, suggesting that the process is well controlled and FP with a consistent quality profile is obtained. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from six commercial scale batches (G043) manufactured at the commercial manufacturing 
site stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25 ºC/60 % RH and 30 ºC/75 %RH), and for 
6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75 % RH), according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Three of the stability batches were packaged in the proposed HDPE bottles and three in the proposed blister. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, dissolution, water content, solid and 
microbiological  purity.  The  analytical  procedures  used  were  the  same  as  for  release  and  are  stability 
indicating. 
In addition, two G043 batches manufactured at the development site using aged intermediate batches have 
been placed on stability under the same ICH storage conditions mentioned above. The intermediate was 
studied on stability under various storage conditions for 12 months and the quality remains as initial. Aged 
intermediate batches, stored for 12 months at 30 °C/75% RH (end-to-end stability) were processed into 
finished product. The finished product produced from the aged intermediate meets the specifications upon 
storage under long term and accelerated conditions. It is thus justified to calculate the expiry date of the 
finished product from the date that the intermediate is mixed with the tablet excipients.  
Forced  degradation studies under stress conditions  were performed to test  the effects of thermal acidic, 
thermal alkaline, oxidative, neutral, dry heat, humid heat, light (ICH Q1B) and metal ions. 
The product was stable under acidic, alkaline, neutral, metal ion, dry heat, humid heat and ICH 1QB 
photolytic conditions, and prone to minor degradation under oxidative conditions. These studies were also 
to demonstrate that the UHPLC test method for assay and impurities control is stability indicating. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without special the storage conditions 
but with the recommendation to “store in original package to protect from moisture”, as stated in the SmPC 
(sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used for the manufacture of the finished product is of human or animal origin.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information for the active substance remains the same as for the authorised 60 mg film coated tablets. 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  finished  product  has  been  presented  in  a 
satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  pharmadynamics,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  studies  have  been  submitted  for  this  application. 
Apalutamide  is  already  used  in  existing  marketed  products  and  no  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure  is  anticipated,  since  calculations  for  Predicted  Environmental  Concentration  and  risk 
characterization  ratios  that  were  based  on  worst-case  scenarios  of  the  EU  population  that  received 
apalutamide. 
Considering the above data, apalutamide should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC 
in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
Based on the environmental risk assessment, no adverse environmental effects are anticipated as a 
consequence of the use of apalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer as indicated in the SmPC. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to an approval of this line extension from a nonclinical point of view.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
The apalutamide drug substance is classified as BCS Class 2. 
The current commercially available formulation of apalutamide is an immediate release oral film-coated 
(FC) tablet (G023) containing 60 mg of apalutamide drug substance. This formulation is produced using 
enabling technology. 
Multiple 240 mg FC tablet formulations were developed for clinical evaluation. An enabling technology was 
selected to address the limited solubility of the drug substance and to increase the BA. 
Formulation G043 was selected to be tested in a pivotal bioequivalence trial. As the proposed formulation 
(G043) is not proportional to that of the existing strength (G023), bioequivalence needs to be demonstrated 
between 1 x 240 mg strength and 4 x 60 mg strength. In addition, as the formulation is different, the food 
effect may also be different since the food effect is not only drug dependent but may also be product or 
formulation dependent. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
The applicant has submitted 3 bioanalytical methods: 11, 25 (partial validation) and 32 (partial 
validation). 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Plasma concentration data has been analysed in both studies with non-compartmental approach to estimate 
the PK parameters of interest. The protocol of study 56021927PCR1027 did not define the method for the 
calculation of AUC, however this was stated in the Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan. The CSR identifies 
that AUC was estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule when explaining the abbreviation of AUC0-72h. In the 
protocol of study 56021927PCR10278 the linear trapezoidal rule is pre-defined.    
The PK analysis was conducted in both studies with Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Certara L.P., Princeton, NJ, 
US). 
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
The 240 mg biopharmaceutic development program consisted of the initial relative BA study (PCR1027 
Part 1) to select the final 240 mg FC tablet formulation, the formal BE study under fasting conditions

(PCR1028 Part 1), and relative BA to demonstrate lack of food effect (PCR1028 Part 2). Additionally, 
the relative BA of the selected tablet was further evaluated in PCR1027 Part 2. 
Protocol Number: 56021927PCR1027, Phase 1 
A Single-Dose, Open-label, Randomized, 2-Part, 2-way Crossover Study to Assess the Relative 
Bioavailability of New Apalutamide Tablet Formulation with Respect to the Current Commercial 
Apalutamide Tablet Formulation in Healthy Male Participants. 
Primary Objectives 
Part 1: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and relative bioavailability of new apalutamide tablet 
formulation compared to the current commercial apalutamide tablet formulation in healthy male 
participants under fasted conditions at a single dose of 240 mg. 
Part 2: To evaluate the PK and relative bioavailability of new apalutamide tablet formulations being 
manufactured with a modified process compared to an apalutamide tablet formulation from Part 1 when 
administered in healthy male participants under fasted conditions at a single dose of 240 mg. 
Secondary Objective 
To assess the safety profile of apalutamide following a single dose administration as a new tablet 
formulation and as the current commercial tablet formulation. 
Study design  
The study was conducted as a randomized, open-label, 2- part, 2-period, 2-way crossover, single centre, 
Phase 1 study. A single dose of 240 mg apalutamide was administered for each treatment period in a 2-
way crossover pattern under fasted conditions in healthy male participants. 
There was a minimum washout of 6 weeks in between the 2 periods as planned.

The  planned  sample  size  was  68  male  participants  (approximately,  28  participants  in  Part  1  and  40 
participants  in  Part  2),  although  48  male  participants  were  analysed  (28  participants  in  Part  1  and  20 
participants  in  Part  2).  Of  the  48  participants  enrolled,  46  participants  completed  the  study  and  2 
participants terminated study participation prematurely. 
The participants were randomized to treatment sequences (AC, CA) and were treated as follows:  
- Six participants randomized to Treatment Sequence AC were administered Treatment A on Period 1 Day 
1 and Treatment C on Period 2 Day 1. One participant randomized to Treatment Sequence AC who was 
administered  Treatment  A  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  on  Period  1  Day  1  due  to  a  failed  urine  drug 
screen for cotinine and was not administered Treatment C on Period 2 Day 1. 
- Seven participants randomized to Treatment Sequence CA were administered Treatment C on Period 1 
Day 1 and Treatment A on Period 2 Day 1. 
Analytical methods 
Plasma samples of apalutamide (JNJ-56021927) and metabolite JNJ-56142060 were analysed using a 
validated bioanalytical method using liquid chromatography for separation and tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for detection (25). This method is supported by the following method validation 
reports: 25; 11. 
Plasma concentrations of apalutamide and metabolite JNJ-56142060 were determined within the range of 
quantitation of 0.00500 to 5.00 µg/mL for apalutamide and metabolite JNJ-56142060. 
Incurred sample reproducibility was performed in 120/1316 (9.1%) of the study samples. 100% of the 
ISR results were within acceptance criteria for JNJ˗56021927 and 97.5% of the ISR results were within 
acceptance criteria for JNJ˗56142060. 
The maximum frozen storage for study samples was 61 days. Samples and calibration/QC samples were 
analyzed within proven frozen stability of 630 days at ˗70°C. 
The samples (1316) were received on the 20 and 26 November 2020 as well as on the 08 December 2021 
frozen at -70ºC. 
The blank and zero samples of each run were used to assess selectivity (signal-to-noise ratio). 
Assessment report  
EMA/317740/2023

All study samples from a subject were initially analyzed in the same analytical run. The calibrators were 
0.00500 (LLOQ), 0.0100, 0.0250, 0.100, 0.250, 1.00, 2.50, 4.00, and 5.00 (ULOQ) μg/mL for both 
analytes and the QC samples were 0.0150, 0.300, 1.50 and 3.75 μg/mL for both analytes, up to run ID 
12; 0.0150, 0.300, 2.40 and 3.75 μg/mL for both analytes, as of run ID 13. 
No dilution was validated. When study samples were diluted, overcurve QC samples (diluted 2˗fold at 
7.50 μg/mL) were analyzed in 6˗fold in the analytical runs concerned, applying the same method of 
dilution as used for the study samples. 
In each run containing a calibration curve, 3 zero plasma samples were analyzed directly following the 
sample at the highest calibration level and all QC samples at the highest level to discard the existence of 
carry-over in the equipment. The analyte response in all zero samples had to be <20.0% of the response 
(peak area) found in the sample at the LLOQ level analyzed in the same run. 
The response of the internal standard had to be between 30% and 170% of the mean of the internal 
standard area of each analytical run. The internal standard response was evaluated in each run containing 
study samples. No samples were repeated for inadequate internal standard response. 
The total number of samples selected for the assessment of incurred sample reproducibility was 120. For 
each reproducibility result, the relative difference from the original result was calculated. For at least 2/3 
of the samples, the absolute relative difference had to be ≤20.0%. 
One sample was reanalyzed because the original result was out of range (>5.00 μg/mL) for 
JNJ˗56021927, and because not enough internal standard working solution was added for JNJ˗56142060. 
Inadvertently, the sample was initially reanalyzed undiluted. Reanalysis was repeated after 2˗fold dilution. 
Run ID 2 was rejected for both analytes and completely reanalyzed in run ID 5, run ID 3 was rejected for 
JNJ˗56021927 and completely reanalyzed in run ID 6, and run ID 4 was rejected and completely 
reanalyzed in run ID 9. 
No samples were reanalyzed for non-analytical reasons, and no reintegrations were carried out. 
Chromatograms of the first 5.0% of the study samples, including blank, zero, calibration and QC samples 
of the involved analytical runs were shown. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The primary PK parameters of interest for the statistical analysis were Cmax and AUC0-72h of apalutamide 
after dosing. 
PK parameters were calculated with a non-compartmental analysis with Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Certara 
L.P., Princeton, NJ, US). 
Statistical methods 
The 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of Test formulation over the Reference formulation were 
calculated for ln-transformed Cmax and AUC0-72 by ANOVA using Mixed-procedure.  
Results 
The mean plasma concentration-time curves for apalutamide treatment C (test G043) vs reference G023 
(treatment A) part 1 are shown in Figure 1.

Part 1: All 14 participants were included in descriptive statistics for Treatment A and 13 participants were 
included in descriptive statistics for Treatment C. One participant in Treatment C Period 2 discontinued 
due to failed urine drug screening. 
Pre-dose plasma PK concentrations were observed for 19 participants in period 2 for respective treatments 
for analyte apalutamide. These pre-dose concentrations were below 5% of Cmax in period 2. Hence these 
participants were included for PK and inferential statistical evaluations. 
Pre-dose plasma PK concentrations were observed for 25 participants in period 2 for respective treatments 
for analyte JNJ-56142060. These pre-dose concentrations were above 5% of Cmax except for 3 participants

This was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, single-center, 2-part Phase 1 study in healthy male 
participants. Each part consisted of 2-sequence, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-way crossover design. A single-
dose of 240 mg apalutamide was administered orally in each treatment period. Part 1 assessed the 
bioequivalence of a new apalutamide film-coated tablet formulation relative to the current commercial 
apalutamide film-coated tablet formulation under fasted conditions and Part 2 assessed the food effect of 
a new 240 mg apalutamide film-coated tablet when administered with or without food. 
Table 3. Randomization scheme 
Hypothesis: 
Part 1: The apalutamide component of a new apalutamide 240 mg film-coated tablet formulation is 
bioequivalent with respect to the current commercial 60 mg film-coated tablet formulation when 
administered at the same dose under fasted conditions as determined by the GMR for Cmax and AUC0-72 
(test/reference) and their corresponding 90% CIs being contained within the 80.00% to 125.00% criteria 
for bioequivalence. 
Part 2: This was an estimation study to provide the precision of the point estimates for bioavailability (as 
assessed by the GMR for Cmax and AUC0-72) between fed and fasted conditions and no formal hypothesis 
was tested. 
A minimum washout period of 7 weeks or a maximum of 8 weeks separated the dose administrations in 
the 2 treatment periods. The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant was 
approximately 12 weeks (including screening, open-label treatment phase, and EOS/EW assessments).

In Part 1: 
- Five (6.8%) participants terminated study participation prematurely due to COVID-19 related AEs (3 
[8.1%] participants randomized to Treatment Sequence AB post administration of Treatment A and 2 
[5.4%] participants randomized to Treatment Sequence BA post administration of Treatment B). 
- One (1.4%) participant (1 [2.7%] participant randomized to Treatment Sequence AB) was terminated 
prematurely due to an TEAE of hypercholesterolaemia post administration of Treatment A. 
- One (1.4%) participant (1 [2.7%] participants randomized to Treatment Sequence AB terminated study 
participation prematurely due to withdrawal by the participant post administration of both Treatment A 
and Treatment B. 
- Three (4.1%) participants (none randomized to Treatment Sequence AB and 3 [8.1%] participants 
randomized to Treatment Sequence BA) terminated study participation prematurely due to other reasons 
(1 participant discontinued on Day 1 of Period 2 due to positive COVID-19 result post administration of 
both Treatment A and Treatment B; 1 participant was withdrawn from the study on Period 2 Day -1 due 
to a failed urine drug screen for cocaine prior to administration of Treatment A in Period 2; and 1 
participant was withdrawn from the study on Period 2 Day -1 due to a positive urine drug screen for 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) prior to administration of Treatment A in Period 2). 
In part 2: 
Study participation was terminated prematurely in 1 (4.8%) participant (1 [9.1%] participant randomized 
to Treatment Sequence CD) post administration of Treatment C in Period 1 due to a positive urine drug 
screen result for cannabinoids 
Analytical methods 
Plasma samples of apalutamide (JNJ-56021927) were analyzed using a validated bioanalytical method 
using liquid chromatography for separation and tandem mass spectrometry for analysis (25). This method 
is supported by the following method validation reports: 25 / 11. 
Plasma concentrations of apalutamide were determined using lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.005 
μg/mL. The range of quantitation was 0.005 to 5.00 μg/mL for apalutamide. 
The in-study validation or study sample analysis is submitted as an appendix to the CSR where the 
Compliance and/or Drug Concentration Data should be submitted instead of in its location in section 
5.3.1.4. 
Incurred sample reproducibility was performed in 180/2527 (7.1%) of the study samples, and 99.4% of 
the ISR results were within acceptance criteria. 
The maximum frozen storage for study samples was 97 days. Samples and calibration/QC samples were 
analyzed within proven frozen stability of 630 days at ˗70°C. 
The samples (2527) were received on the 31 Jan 2022, 7 and 15 Fed 2022 frozen at -70ºC. 
The blank and zero samples of each run were used to assess selectivity (signal-to-noise ratio). 
All study samples from a subject were initially analyzed in the same analytical run. The calibrators were 
0.00500 (LLOQ), 0.0100, 0.0250, 0.100, 0.250, 1.00, 2.50, 4.00, and 5.00 (ULOQ) μg/mLand the QC 
samples 0.0150, 0.300, 2.40 and 3.75 μg/mL. No diluted QC samples were included because no samples 
required dilution. 
In each run containing a calibration curve, 3 zero plasma samples were analyzed directly following the 
sample at the highest calibration level and all QC samples at the highest level to discard the existence of 
carry-over in the equipment. The analyte response in all zero samples had to be <20.0% of the response 
Assessment report

Page 24/39 
 
 
(peak area) found in the sample at the LLOQ level analyzed in the same run. In run ID 5, the response of 
the first zero sample following the fourth QC sample at the highest level exceeded 20.0% of the LLOQ. 
Evaluation as per procedure PRA˗QMS˗00662 [12] by the Project Manager showed that this did not affect 
the results of the study samples. In run ID 10, the JNJ˗56021927 response in multiple carry-over zero 
samples was >20.0% of its response at the LLOQ level. This was investigated. See IUR number 
2022˗NL˗0069 in Section 6.3.1. Run ID 10 was rejected and all samples in the run were reanalyzed. 
The response of the internal standard had to be between 30% and 170% of the mean of the internal 
standard area of each analytical run. The internal standard response was evaluated in each run containing 
study samples. No samples were repeated for inadequate internal standard response. 
The total number of samples selected for the assessment of incurred sample reproducibility was 180. For 
each reproducibility result, the relative difference from the original result was calculated. For at least 2/3 
of the samples, the absolute relative difference had to be ≤20.0%. 
Fifteen samples were reanalyzed because of a preparation error. Run ID 10 was rejected and the samples 
were reanalyzed in run IDs 17 and 18. No samples were reanalyzed for non-analytical reasons and no 
reintegrations were carried out. 
No samples were reanalyzed for non-analytical reasons and no reintegrations were carried out. 
Chromatograms of the first 20.0% of the study samples, plus the contingent chromatograms of ISR 
analysis of these study samples, including test, blank, zero, calibration and QC samples of the involved 
analytical runs are submitted. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The primary PK parameters of interest for the statistical analysis were Cmax and AUC0-72h of apalutamide 
after dosing. 
PK parameters were calculated with a non-compartmental analysis with Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Certara 
L.P., Princeton, NJ, US). AUC was calculated according to the linear trapezoidal rule as pre-defined in the 
protocol. 
Two AUC values were excluded from the statistical analysis of Part 1 because the sample at 72 h was 
missing and the primary PK parameter cannot be calculated. 
Statistical methods 
Part 1: 
A linear mixed effect model that included treatment, period, and treatment sequence as fixed effects, and 
participant as a random effect, was applied to estimate the least squares means and intra-participant 
variance. Using these estimated least squares means and intra-participant variance, the point estimate 
and 90% CIs for the difference in means on a log scale between tests and reference were constructed. 
The limits of the CIs were retransformed using antilogarithms to obtain 90% CIs for the GMRs of Cmax and 
AUC0-72h of the following pairs of treatments: Treatment B (Test) versus Treatment A (Reference). 
Part 2: 
A linear mixed effect model that included treatment, period, and treatment sequence as fixed effects, and 
participant as a random effect, was applied to construct the 90% CI for the GMR of the PK parameters 
between D and C.

Part 1: All 14 participants were included in descriptive statistics for Treatment A and 13 participants were 
included in descriptive statistics for Treatment C. One participant in Treatment C Period 2 discontinued 
due to failed urine drug screening. 
Pre-dose plasma PK concentrations were observed for 19 participants in period 2 for respective 
treatments for analyte apalutamide. These pre-dose concentrations were below 5% of Cmax in period 2. 
Hence these participants were included for PK and inferential statistical evaluations. 
Pre-dose plasma PK concentrations were observed for 25 participants in period 2 for respective 
treatments for analyte JNJ-56142060. These pre-dose concentrations were above 5% of Cmax except for 
3 participants (below 5% of Cmax). Participants with pre-dose above 5% of Cmax were excluded from 
calculation of descriptive statistics. 
Part 2: 19 participants were included in descriptive statistics for Treatment C and all 20 participants were 
included in descriptive statistics for Treatment D. One participant in Treatment C Period 2 discontinued 
due to due to AE. 
Pre-dose plasma PK concentrations were observed for 25 participants in Period 2 for respective 
treatments for analyte apalutamide. These pre-dose concentrations were below or equal to 5% of Cmax in 
period 2. Hence these participants were included for PK and inferential statistical evaluations. 
Pre-dose plasma PK concentrations were observed for 19 participants in Period 2 for respective

Protocol deviations: 
Major protocol deviations reported during Part 1 of the study were: 
- Physical examination was not conducted in 1 participant randomized to Treatment Sequence BA on 
Period 2 Day 4. 
- One participant randomized to Treatment Sequence BA was withdrawn from the study due to a failed 
urine drug screen for cocaine on Period 2 Day -1. The site staff conducted only Period 2 Day -1

procedures and following withdrawal did not complete the procedures for early termination that included 
ECG, full physical examination (only brief PE was performed), and TSH/testosterone labs. Although the 
site staff contacted the participant to return to the clinic to complete missed procedures, the participant 
refused to return as the compensation offered was not enough for him to return to the site. 
- One participant randomized to Treatment Sequence BA was withdrawn from the study due to a failed 
urine drug screen for THC on Period 2 Day -1. The site staff conducted only Period 2 Day -1 procedures 
and following withdrawal did not complete the procedures for early termination that included ECG, full 
physical examination (only brief PE was performed), and TSH/testosterone labs. Although the site staff 
contacted the participant to return to the clinic to complete missed procedures, the participant did not 
respond to the certified letter and was deemed lost to follow-up. 
No major protocol deviations were reported during Part 2 of the study. 
Pharmacokinetic conclusion on study 56021927PCR1028: 
Part 1 (Bioequivalence): Formulation G043 versus G023 under Fasted Conditions 
- Treatment B (G043) is bioequivalent to Treatment A (G023). The 90% CI of the GMR of Cmax and 
AUC0-72h fell completely within the BE limits of 80.00%-125.00%. 
Part 2 (Food Effect): Fed versus Fasted for Formulation G043 
- Treatment D (G043-Fed) is comparable to Treatment C (G043-Fasted). The 90% CI of the GMR of Cmax 
and AUC0-72h fell completely within the limits of 80.00%-125.00%. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The biopharmaceutic development program for the new 240 mg strength consisted of the initial 
bioavailability (BA) study (56021927PCR1027 Part 1) to select the final (240 mg) film-coated tablet 
formulation, the formal bioequivalence (BE) study performed under fasting conditions 
(56021927PCR1028 Part 1), and the relative BA study to demonstrate lack of food effect 
(56021927PCR1028 Part 2). Additionally, the relative BA of the selected tablet with a modified process 
was further evaluated in study 56021927PCR1027 Part 2. 
The study (56021927PCR1027) to assess the systemic exposure of the new tablet formulation (test 
G043) vs. the reference one (i.e. G023 - the currently commercial 60 mg FC tablet) in healthy male 
participants, is considered adequate. The statistical analysis is acceptable (i.e. based on log-
transformation and conventional ANOVA factors considered: treatment, sequence, period and subject 
(sequence)). The PROC MIXED method reports the same results as PROC GLM since missing data has 
been excluded and the designs can be considered as 2x2 designs. The G043 formulation was selected for 
further development based on favourable exposure profiles, formulation composition, and manufacturing 
process. This is acceptable.  
Study 56021927PCR1028 was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, single-center, 2-part Phase 1 study 
in healthy male participants. Each part consisted of 2-sequence, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-way crossover 
design. A single-dose of 240 mg apalutamide was administered orally in each treatment period. As 
outlined above, Part 1 was a bioequivalence study to confirm that the new 240 mg strength is equivalent 
to 4 tablets of the current 60 mg strength (under fasted conditions) and Part 2 was a food effect study to 
confirm that the food effect is negligible and bioequivalence is shown between the fasted and fed state. 
The employed design is overall considered adequate for the two PK objectives. The mean and individual 
plots of parent concentrations versus time have been submitted within the CSR. Truncation of AUC at 72 
h is considered sufficiently representative of extent of absorption for drugs with long half-life. As in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/317740/2023 
Page 29/39 
 
 
PCR1027 study, the statistical analysis is considered acceptable (i.e. based on log-transformation and 
conventional ANOVA factors considered: treatment, sequence, period and subject (sequence)). The PROC 
MIXED method reports the same results as PROC GLM since missing data has been excluded and the 
designs can be considered as 2x2 designs.  Based on the results from study PCR1028 the new 240 mg 
strength can be considered bioequivalent to 4 tablets of 60 mg administered simultaneously. Further, the 
bioavailability of the new strength formulation is not affected by the concomitant intake of food and can 
be taken irrespective of meals, like the currently marketed strength. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a clinical pharmacology point of view, the application is acceptable and the new 240 mg strength 
can be considered bioequivalent to 4 tablets of 60 mg administered simultaneously. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No new efficacy data have been provided as part of this submission. This is acceptable. The clinical 
information supports the use of the proposed 240 mg film-coated tablets formulation in the same 
indications as the 60 mg film-coated tablets. 
2.6.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Safety data is provided from 48 participants randomized in the relative bioavailability study 
56021927PCR1027 and from 74 + 21 subjects in the bioequivalence study 56021927PCR1028. Both 
studies included healthy male participants that received single doses of apalutamide. 
2.6.6.2.  Adverse events 
Most of the reported AEs were of mild grade. The number of subjects experiencing at least one AE in 
study 56021927PCR1027 was 11 (22.9%) subjects and in study 56021927PCR1028 was 18 (24.3%) and 
4 (19.0%) subjects in Parts 1 and 2, respectively. 
Three grade 3 TEAEs were reported in study 56021927PCR1028 (two in part 1, one with treatment A and 
one with treatment B; and an additional one in part 2 with treatment D). All the three were reported as 
resolved. No higher grade AEs were reported. 
2.6.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No subject in either study reported a fatal or serious AE.  
2.6.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Overall, no clinically relevant mean changes from baseline over time were observed in any of the 
haematology and chemistry parameters in studies 56021927PCR1027 and 56021927PCR1028. No 
clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, physical examinations, or ECG parameters were reported 
during any of the two studies

Not applicable. 
2.6.6.6.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One participant was assessed with a Grade 1 TEAE of symptomatic COVID-19 in study 56021927PCR1027 
that led to the discontinuation of the study intervention. In part 1 of study 56021927PCR1028 6 subjects 
(4 in Treatment A and 2 in Treatment B) were assessed with TEAEs that led to discontinuation. Only one 
(Grade 1 hypercholesterolemia) was considered drug related. The other 5 were four Grade 1 
asymptomatic COVID-19 and one Grade 2 symptomatic COVID-19. No subjects experienced TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation in part 2 of study 56021927PCR1028.  
2.6.6.7.  Post marketing experience 
No new data on safety have been reported. 
2.6.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of the apalutamide 240 mg FC tablet is considered to be in line with that of the 
currently available 60 mg tablet. No new safety concerns have been identified. Of note, there were no 
changes to safety concerns, PhV plan and RMM resulting from the clinical development of the 240mg 
tablet. 
From a general safety perspective, the informative value of data coming from single-dose administrations 
in healthy individuals is limited. From a comparative perspective there is no trend suggesting a different 
safety or tolerability profile when the proposed new strength vs. four tablets of the currently marketed 
strength are given. This is expected since bioequivalence has been demonstrated.  
2.6.8.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
AE data observed in studies 56021927PCR1027 and 56021927PCR1028 were consistent with the known 
safety profile for apalutamide. No new safety concerns have been identified.  
Taking into account that bioequivalence has been shown, the safety profile of the proposed strength can 
be assumed to be equivalent to that of the existing 60 mg strength.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the immediate labelling (blister foil) has been submitted by the 
applicant and has been found acceptable, in line with the one granted for Erleada 60 mg film-coated 
tablets at the time of MAA, for the following reasons: 
The product will be marketed as film-coated tablets supplied in blisters sealed in a wallet card. The 
company requested to omit printing certain of the minimum particulars on the blister foil as patients will 
not be able to see it since it will be completely sealed in an inner wallet. The inner wallet will contain all 
the required minimum particulars for the primary packaging and will be translated in all languages. 
It was considered acceptable to print the minimum particulars on the blister foil as follows: invented 
name, INN, strength, EXP/Lot. The only particulars that would need translation on the blister foil are the 
INN, EXP and Lot, and it was agreed to have these particulars in English only, in line with the exemption 
granted for Erleada 60 mg film-coated tablets.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption above will however be translated in all languages in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on the EMA website, but the printed materials will only be in English as 
agreed. 
2.9.2.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. Indeed, the user 
consultation complies with the requirements and recommendations of articles 59(3) and 61(1) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC).  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The bioequivalence study 56021927PCR1028 together with the bioavailability study 56021927PCR1027 
form the pivotal basis as phase I, single-dose, open-label, randomized studies conducted in healthy 
males. The study design is considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of the 240mg tablet. 
Choice of dose, sampling points and overall sampling times were adequate. The analytical methods were 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied are adequate. 
The 240 mg tablet met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the 4x60mg 
tablet. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-
72 and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00%-125.00%. 
Bioequivalence of the two tablets was demonstrated. 
The benefit/risk ratio of the 240mg tablet can be considered comparable to the 4x60mg tablet. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Erleada 240 mg film-coated tablets is positive subject to the conditions 
stated in the ‘Recommendations’ section.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, bioavailability, bioequivalence and safety, the CHMP 
considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Erleada 240 mg film-coated tablets is favourable 
in the following indication(s): 
• 
• 
adult men for the treatment of non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (NM CRPC) 
who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (see section 5.1). 
in adult men for the treatment of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in 
combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Erleada subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
In addition, CHMP did recommend the variation(s) to the terms of the marketing authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

of the new Erleada film-coated tablet strength, 240 mg. 
The PL for Erleada 60 mg is proposed to be updated to ensure consistency. The RMP version 6.1 
has also been submitted. 
In addition, few minor revisions are proposed to the SmPC for Erleada 60 mg, to align the SmPC 
proposed for the 240 mg strength: 
- SmPC Section 3: Correction of the tablets size 
- SmPC Section 4.2: Further details on the method of administration 
- SmPC Section 4.8: Correction in line with the SmPC Guideline 
- SmPC Sections 5.1 and 5.2 : Orthographic corrections 
- SmPC Section 6.5 : Further details on the description of the current packaging have been added, 
this change does not result from a change to the container 
- SmPC Section 6.6 : The title of the section has been aligned with QRD template. 
The revised annexes I, IIIA, IIIB and A are included in the annexes to this opinion

Summary of Risk Management Plan for Efficib
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Efficib. The RMP details 
important risks of Efficib, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Efficib's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Efficib’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Efficib should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Efficib should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Efficib’s RMP.

I.A
The Medicine and What It Is Used For
p
Efficib is authorised for treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct 
to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their 
maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already being treated with the 
combination of sitagliptin and metformin.  
r
p
o
Efficib is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as 
an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated 
dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea.
v
Efficib is indicated as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a 
PPARγ agonist.
d
e
Efficib is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to 
diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose of insulin and 
metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
Refer to SmPC for the full indication.
It contains sitagliptin phosphate and metformin hydrochloride as the active substances and it 
is given by oral route of administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Efficib’s benefits can be found in Efficib’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the
medicine’s webpage:

I.B
Risks Associated with The Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise The Risks 
Important risks of Efficib, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Efficib's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
A
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
p
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
p
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
r
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken 
as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
o
v
If important information that may affect the safe use of Efficib is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.

I.B.1
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
d
Important risks of Efficib are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Efficib. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Efficib  has  been  marketed  for  11  years  since  2007  with  over  25  million  patient-years  of 
treatment. The safety profile has been well-characterised during that time and adverse reactions 
that have been reported from clinical trials, non-interventional studies and post-approval safety 
surveillance analysis are included in the SmPC. There are no studies planned or warranted to 
further characterise any identified or potential risk that would alter the established risk-benefit 
profile for Efficib. There are no additional important safety concerns for  which prospective 
additional risk management is to be planned.
A
In conclusion, continued spontaneous safety surveillance and use of a lactic acidosis 
questionnaire as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities will be sufficient to monitor 
the safety profile and labeling will provide sufficient routine risk minimisation.

Risk factors and risk groups
Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due 
to metformin accumulation during treatment with sitagliptin/metformin FDC; 
when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases.

The most common risk factor is renal insufficiency.  Lactic acidosis may occur

Safety Population; P082) there was no significant difference between treatment 
groups in the incidence of pancreatic malignancies, however, the clinical trials 
were not specifically designed to fully investigate pancreatic cancer as a safety 
concern.  
Risk factors and risk groups
The risk of pancreatic cancer was significant for type 2 diabetes patients 
(adjusted HR 1.80 (95% Cl: 1.52, 2.14)), thus 80% increase in the risk of 
pancreatic cancer. In addition, the risk was significant among patients with 
increasing age, history of chronic pancreatitis and tobacco use. Patients with 
chronic pancreatitis and T2DM  with the adjusted HR was 12.12 (95% Cl: 6.02, 
24.40), they were 12 times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. The effect 
A
of T2DM and chronic pancreatitis on pancreatic cancer risk was at least 
additive after adjusting for known risk factors. Incidence was highest in patients

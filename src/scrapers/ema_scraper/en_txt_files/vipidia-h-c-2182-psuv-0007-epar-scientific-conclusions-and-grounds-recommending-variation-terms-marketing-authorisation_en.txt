Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Vipidia, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
An analysis of 22 cases of erythema mulitforme reported as serious adverse events for alogliptin 
containing medicinal products indicated that a relationship between the event and alogliptin seems 
likely since there were 7 serious cases without confounding factors, and 16 of the 22 serious cases 
reported a positive dechallenge. Furthermore, exfoliative skin reactions are known for dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors. 
Exfoliative skin disorders in general, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), are already listed in 
section 4.8 of the SmPCs of Incresync, Vipdomet and Vipidia. However, since erythema multiforme 
differs in clinical pattern and aetiology from SJS, the MAH is requested to add “erythema multiforme” 
to the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPCs. Furthermore, the wording on hypersensitivity in section 
4.4 should be adapted. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding erythema multiforme, the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by 
the PRAC and recommended changes to the SmPC and package leaflet accordingly. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Vipidia, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance alogliptin is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

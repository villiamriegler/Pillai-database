Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Doptelet in the approved indication remains favourable and 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. Minor changes are 
implemented in the PI in line with the latest QRD template. 
The product is being removed from the additional 
monitoring list and therefore the statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and 
that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle, is also being removed from the summary of 
product characteristics and the package leaflet.

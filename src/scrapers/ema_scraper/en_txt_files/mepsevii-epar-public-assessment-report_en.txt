1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Ultragenyx Germany GmbH submitted on 30 March 2017 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Mepsevii, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 
April 2016.  
Mepsevii was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/973 on 21 March 2012 in the 
following condition: Treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome). 
The applicant applied for the following indication “Mepsevii is indicated for the treatment of 
Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII; Sly syndrome) for patients of all ages”. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Mepsevii as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s 
website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0202/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0202/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VII is a progressively debilitating and life-threatening disease that is 
caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MPS VII (also known as Sly syndrome) is an ultra-rare disease with an estimated prevalence < 
1/1,000,000 (Orphanet 2016), and for which the applicant estimates that there are less than 100 
living patients worldwide. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficiency 
of one of the enzymes involved in the stepwise degradation of complex carbohydrates known as 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that include dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), heparan 
sulfate (HS) and keratan sulfate (KS). 
In MPS VII, the disease is caused by a deficiency in beta-glucuronidase (GUS), resulting in 
accumulation of GAGs in the lysosomes and subsequent tissue damage, dysfunction and failure of 
organs and systems throughout the body and ultimately death. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Clinical presentation may occur at birth with hydrops foetalis, or not until adolescence or adulthood 
with skeletal disease and other manifestations. MPS VII symptoms can include a variety of common 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 8/87 
 
 
 
 
 
MPS disease manifestations such as abnormal coarsened facies, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular 
complications, hepatosplenomegaly, joint stiffness, short stature, cognitive impairment, and the 
MPS skeletal disease known as dysostosis multiplex.  
The presence, severity and progression of these symptoms in MPS VII patients are highly variable. 
Most MPS VII patients die before the second or third decade of life due to complicating medical 
problems although death may also occur in the first year of life due to hydrops foetalis (Montano et 
al. 2016). 
The  diagnosis  of  MPS  VII  may  be  confirmed  by  a  thorough  clinical  evaluation  that  includes  a 
detailed patient history and specialized tests that measure the level of GUS activity in blood or skin 
cells.  Molecular  genetic  testing  for  mutations  in  the  GUSB  gene  is  available  to  confirm  the 
diagnosis.  Prenatal  diagnosis  is  possible  through  amniocentesis  or  chorionic  villus  sampling  to 
measure GUS activity or molecular genetic testing for GUSB gene mutations. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Limited  results  from  7  patients  (Islam  et  al.,  1996;  Yamada  et  al.,  1998;  Montaño  et  al.,  2016) 
suggest that HSCT can delay or even prevent further neurological complications, but has little to no 
effect on the skeletal disease unless it is performed in an early stage. 
Currently there is no specific treatment available for MPS VII. Treatment is limited to symptomatic 
relief and supportive care. Bone deformities and hernias may require surgical correction. Ocular 
and cardiovascular abnormalities may also be treated surgically. Genetic counselling is 
recommended for people with MPS VII and their families. 
About the product 
Vestronidase alfa is a recombinant form of human GUS and is intended to provide exogenous GUS 
enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes. Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the 
oligosaccharide chains allow binding of the enzyme to cell surface receptors, leading to cellular 
internalization of the enzyme, targeting to lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated 
GAGs in affected tissues. 
The initially claimed indication for Mepsevii was for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII 
(MPS VII; Sly syndrome) for patients of all ages. 
During the evaluation, the applicant amended the proposed indication to patients of all ages with 
Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPSVII; Sly syndrome) for the treatment of non-neurological 
manifestations of the disease. 
The recommended dose of Mepsevii is 4 mg/kg of body weight administered by intravenous 
infusion every two weeks. To minimize the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, a non-sedating 
antihistamine with or without an antipyretic medicinal product should be administered 30-60 
minutes prior to the start of the infusion. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 June 2012 in relation to non-clinical 
and clinical aspects including the size of the required clinical trial and the selection of appropriate 
endpoints to evaluate the product in these conditions. The applicant followed the advice received 
from the CHMP. 
The application was submitted as a full application according to Article 8(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. The applicant requested an exceptional circumstances status. 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 9/87 
 
 
 
 
•  Exceptional circumstances 
The Applicant considered that the grounds for marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances apply to Mespsevii according to Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726 /2004 and 
to Part II.6 of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC and provided justification based on the inability to 
provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of indication.  
Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VII is an orphan condition, with an estimated prevalence of 
approximately < 1/1,000,000, and Mepsevii (also referred to as UX003 in this report, recombinant 
human beta-glucuronidase) received orphan medicinal product designation in 2012 for the 
treatment of MPS VII (EU/3/12/973).  
At present, there are no orphan medicinal products marketed in the EU for the treatment of MPS 
VII. 
The applicant noted that the presence, severity and progression of symptoms in MPS VII patients 
are highly variable, which in addition to its extreme rarity, made the clinical development program 
of Mepsevii uniquely challenging.  
Given the very small heterogeneous patient population, a single Phase 3 study, was designed as a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Blind-Start, single crossover study of UX003 that 
incorporated several innovative elements to make efficient and safe use of a small number of 
subjects and leverage the extensive existing data and lessons learned from previously approved 
ERTs. The novel study design addressed the development challenges associated with extremely 
rare and life-threatening diseases by allowing all subjects to be assessed for efficacy on active 
treatment, while still retaining some evaluation objectivity through the use of a placebo control 
run-in period.  
Due to the rarity of MPS VII, eligibility criteria could not be applied to assure that subjects were 
able to perform all the clinical assessments or meet certain levels of disease severity, and therefore 
essentially all comers had to be enrolled in the study, unlike prior MPS Phase 3 studies with 
selected populations. Consequently, the study population had highly variable disease 
manifestations and various physical and/or cognitive limitations. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product,  also  referred  to  as  drug  product  (DP)  by  the  applicant,  is  presented  as  a 
concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  2  mg/ml  of  vestronidase  alfa  as  active  substance. 
Other ingredients are: sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, histidine, polysorbate 20 and water for 
injections. The product is available in a colourless glass vial (Ph. Eur. Type I) with a rubber stopper 
with fluoro-resin coating and an aluminium over seal with a plastic flip-off cap. Each  vial contains 
an extractable volume of 5.0 ml. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Vestronidase  alfa  is  a  recombinant  human  beta-glucuronidase  (rhGUS)  glycoprotein  enzyme 
produced in a genetically engineered stable Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. The protein is 
expressed  as  a  651  amino  acid  precursor  with  an  N-terminal  signal  sequence  of  22  amino  acids, 
which is cleaved intracellularly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 10/87 
 
 
 
The  translated  protein  is  post-translationally  modified  by  glycosylation.  The  glycans  of  rhGUS 
contain  mannose  6-phosphate  (M6P),  which  is  required  for  target  cell  uptake  and  internalization 
into the lysosome by the cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), also known 
as M6P/IGF2 receptor. 
The secreted mature enzyme intracellularly forms a homotetramer after glycosylation. Each rhGUS 
monomer consists of 629 amino acids; the calculated isotope average molecular mass of each non-
glycosylated peptide chain is 72,562 Dalton.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Rentschler Biopharma SE, Laupheim Germany (Rentschler) is the site responsible manufactureand 
batch release  of the active substance.  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  active  substance,  vestronidase  alfa,  has  been  adequately 
described.  The  main  steps  are  upstream  processing,  comprising  cell  culture  in  fed  batch  mode, 
followed  by  harvest  using  depth  filtration,  and  downstream  processing  comprising  recovery, 
purification  by  four  chromatography  steps,  a  low  pH  virus  inactivation  step,  cation  exchange 
chromatography,  viral  filtration    and  a  final  ultra-diafiltration  and  formulation  of  bulk  active 
substance. A batch numbering system has been defined for all manufacturing steps. 
In  response  to  a  Major  Objection  (MO1)  requesting  the  control  strategy  to  be  sufficiently 
substantiated by process evaluation data especially for the downstream process, the description of 
the  manufacturing  process,  critical  steps,  and  associated  process  development  was  extensively 
updated  during  the  procedure  with  newly  introduced  controls.  The  control  strategy  is  considered 
appropriate; parameters, critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical in-process controls (IPCs), 
and associated ranges (normal operating ranges and/or proven acceptance ranges) are sufficiently 
supported. The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with 
acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity, adventitious agents and endotoxin, are 
described  for  each  step.  Actions  taken  if  limits  are  exceeded  are  specified.  The  active  substance 
manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Vestronidase alfa is stored in sterilised bags equipped with filling and outlet ports. Tests carried out 
demonstrate that the bag meets Ph. Eur. 3.1.7 requirements. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient  information  on  raw  materials  used  in  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has 
been  submitted.  The  history  and  details  of  cell  line  establishment  are  provided,  including  the 
construction of the expression plasmid, clonal selection and isolation of the production clone. A two 
tiered cell banking system is used. Cell banks preparation are appropriately described and consist 
of  a  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB),  a  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  and  end  of  production  cells  (EPC). 
Sufficient information is provided regarding testing of the MCB, WCB and release of future WCBs. 
Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit of cell age. The limit for in 
vitro cell age has been calculated. A stability program for the MCB has been provided. Compendial 
raw  materials  are  tested  in  accordance  with  the  corresponding  monograph,  while  specifications 
(including  test  methods)  for  non-compendial  raw  materials  are  presented.  No  human  or  animal 
derived  materials  are  used  in  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  and  acceptable 
documents  have  been  provided  for  raw  materials  of  biological  origin  used  in  the  establishment  of 
cell banks.

Process validation 
The  manufacturing  process  of  vestronidase  alfa  active  substance  has  been  validated  adequately. 
Consistency  in  production  has  been  shown  on  three  full  scale  batches  manufactured  using  the 
proposed  commercial  process.  All  acceptance  criteria  for  the  critical  operational  parameters  and 
likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled, demonstrating that the purification 
process  consistently  produces  vestronidase  alfa  active  substance  of  reproducible  quality  that 
complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria.  
Manufacturing process development 
Several  important  changes  have  been  introduced  during  the  development  of  the  manufacturing 
process. As the active substance used in the non-clinical studies was not derived from the proposed 
WCB, upon request, data for batches used in non-clinical studies have been provided and indicate 
that these batches represent a worst case of the commercial product, as they contain higher levels 
of impurities.  
Characterisation 
The vestronidase alfa active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and 
biological  state-of-the-art  methods.  The  analytical  results  are  consistent  with  the  proposed 
structure.  Process-related  and  product-related  impurities  have  been  characterised.  The  impurities 
are controlled in routine, either at release or during production. The specified impurities have been 
present in product used in clinical studies. In addition, forced degradation studies were performed. 
Upon  request,  to  resolve  MO2,  raised  to  highlight  the  incompleteness  of  the  characterisation 
exercise  and  the  scarcity  of  the  critical  quality  attributes  identified,  the  characterisation  of 
vestronidase  alfa  was  extended  with  additional  data  on  homotetramer  structure  and  charge 
variants  and  additional  explanations  on  peptide  mapping,  N-linked  glycosylation  and  cellular 
uptake;  additionally  some  product-related  impurities  were  re-classified  from non-critical  to  critical 
quality  attributes  in  the  course  of  the  procedure.  As  a  consequence,  sections  3.2.S.4  (Control  of 
Drug  substance),  3.2.S.5  (Reference  Standard)  and  3.2.S.7  (Stability)  have  been  updated 
accordingly.  The  enzymatic  activity  and  cellular  uptake  of  vestronidase  alfa  is  measured  using  an 
artificial  substrate  4-methylumbelliferyl-glucuronide  (4-MUG),  which  is  cleaved  into  fluorescent  4-
methylumbelliferone  (4-MU)  and  glucuronic  acid  by  vestronidase  alfa  enzyme.  The  amount  of 
cleaved 4-MU, and thus the corresponding activity of vestronidase alfa, is subsequently quantified 
using fluorometric determination. 
Specification 
Vestronidase alfa specification contains the tests for appearance and description, identity, content, 
activity/potency, purity and impurities, endotoxins, bioburden, polysorbate 20 content, pH and 
osmolality. Most of the methods used in characterization studies to determine the purity/impurity 
profile of the finished product Mepsevii  as well as activity and content  are included in the 
specification of the active substance.  
Potency is measured by two methods. As described under Characterisation, the enzymatic activity 
is  measured  by  quantifying  cleaved  4-MU.  The  bioassay  uptake  method  measures  the  enzymatic 
activity of rhGUS after internalisation.  
The Applicant is recommended to develop a new method.to control charge heterogeneity. Although 
the specification of the active substance is considered sufficient at for the authorisation of the 
product, it is expected that based on manufacturing experience, the acceptance criteria for several 
parameters should be revised.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. However, several recommendations 
have been given related to the analytical methods. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications 
and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference standards 
A one-tier reference standard has been established for the control of the commercial vestronidase 
alfa active substance and finished product. The current reference standard was qualified by release 
tests and characterisation tests. During the course of the procedure, the qualification protocol for 
future reference standards was withdrawn as it was considered as not sufficient to ensure a batch-
to-batch consistency. The applicant has proposed to submit a revised protocol, including both 
release and additional characterization testing, in a post-approval variation. This has been 
accepted. The stability program for the current and future reference standards, to confirm the 
shelf-life, has been updated by tightening the acceptance criteria of several parameters and by 
including additional parameters. 
Stability 
A shelf life at a long-term storage condition, protected from light, is proposed for the the active 
substance. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life when stored refrigerated in the proposed container. 
Real time, real condition stability data on three batches of active substance from a manufacturing 
process representative of the commercial process under long term storage conditions and under 
accelerated conditions according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The container used for the 
stability studies is representative of the active substance storage container closure systemwith 
regards to the material of construction. 
During the review, the acceptance limits have been adjusted to justified levels. The applicant is 
recommended to inform the EMA immediately if trends or out of specification results are obtained 
for bioassay uptake during the stability program for commercial batches. The forced degradation 
study showed the active substance is degraded under light exposure. Therefore a photostability 
study was requested on the finished product in vials and in-use conditions. In conclusion, the 
stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Vestronidase alfa finished product (Mepsevii) is a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 2 
mg/ml of vestronidase alfa active substance. The excipients used in the finished product 
formulation are: sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, histidine (all chemical stabilisers) and 
polysorbate 20 (physical stabiliser) in water for injection. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The development of the finished product 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 13/87 
 
 
 
is reflected by the description of the development of the formulated bulk active substance (see 
active substance). During development, the excipients have been demonstrated compatible with 
vestronidase alfa and suitable for their intended functions.  
Each vial is filled to a target volume of 5.4 ml, which allows the withdrawal of 5.0 ml of deliverable 
volume containing 10 mg of vestronidase alfa. There are no overages in the formulation of the 
finished product. Prior to administration, the finished product is diluted with preservative free 
sterile saline solution for injection (0.9%). The diluent is not supplied with the finished product. 
The content of 10 mg per vial is not suitable for the dosing regimen of 4 mg/Kg every other week, 
especially for children and adults. As an example, a 20 Kg patient would receive a total of 8 vials 
per administration, and a 70 Kg patient 28 vials. However, taking into consideration that the 
product will be administered at clinical infusion sites familiar with MPS ERT therapies, and that MPS 
VII is an ultra-rare disease, the development of another presentation with a larger volume of 
concentrate per vial is not currently requested. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Rentschler  Biopharma  SE  (Rentschler),  Laupheim,  Germany  is  responsible  for  manufacture  of  the 
finished product. Manufacture of the finished product comprises six process steps: equilibration of 
stored active substance to room temperature; formulation; sterile filtration, filling and stoppering, 
capping and visual inspection.  
Description  of  the  manufacturing  process  including  where  materials  enter  the  process,  the 
operational  parameters  and  critical  parameters  of  the  process  inputs  and  the  performance 
parameters  of  the  process  outputs  for  each  step,  are  provided.  The  process  performance 
qualification was performed by process validation upon three finished product batches covering the 
proposed batch size range manufactured using the commercial process. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate. 
Container closure system  
The primary packaging is colourless glass vial (Ph. Eur. Type I) with a rubber stopper with a fluoro-
resin coating, and an aluminium over seal with a plastic flip-off cap. The material complies with Ph. 
Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The suitability of the container-
closure components has been demonstrated. However, the leachable study will be available in the 
future.  One  of  the  extractables  is  above  the  PDE  in  infants  and  should  therefore  be  controlled  in 
each batch if the PDE is exceeded in the leachable study. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  and  description,  identity,  content 
activity/potency, purity and impurities, safety, excipients and general tests. 
As  required  by  ICH  Q3D  a  risk  assessment  was  used  to  evaluate  the  finished  product 
manufacturing process, beginning with final ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) and all stages of the 
finished product, where relevant equipment, consumables, packaging materials, raw materials and 
utilities were considered. The finished product manufacturing process has no impact on the product 
related impurity profiles.  
Justification of specification 
Upon  request,  a  number  of  acceptance  criteria  were  tightened  or  justification  for  the  proposed 
criterion was improved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 14/87 
 
 
 
Analytical methods 
The  methods  used  for  testing  active  substance  are  also  applicable  to  the  finished  product. 
Analytical procedures that are specific to testing the finished product attributes are the compendial 
methods  for  testing  visible  and  sub-visible  particles,  extractable  volume,  sterility  and  container 
closure  integrity.  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-
compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analyses 
Batch  analysis  data  from  a  umber  of  finished  product  batches,  manufactured  from  a  number  of 
active  substance  batches,  including  a  number  of  batches  manufactured  using  the  proposed 
commercial  process  and  scale,  were  presented.  The  results  are  within  the  specifications  and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials  
The  reference  standard  used  to  test  the  finished  product  is  the  same  as  that  used  for  testing 
vestronidase alfa active substance. 
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 30 months in the refrigerator (2°C – 8°C), stored 
in the original package in order to protect from light, as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Real  time/real  condition  stability  data  of  four  primary  stability  batches  using  active  substance 
manufactured  at  the  commercial  scale  of  finished  product  and  under  accelerated  conditions 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  vestronidase  alfa  finished  product 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing.  
No  significant  changes  have  been  observed  during  long  term  storage  conditions  for  the  quality 
attributes. Accelerated stability data show insignificant or no change for most quality attributes. A 
photostability  study  was  conducted  as  part  of  the  forced  degradation  study.  The  summary  of 
product characteristics (SmPC) was updated to include the statement “Store in the original package 
in order to protect from light” in Section 6.4 special precautions for storage. 
After  dilution:  Chemical  and  physical  in-use  stability  has  been  demonstrated  for  up  to  36  hours 
under refrigeration at 2°C – 8°C followed by up to 6 hours at room temperature up to a maximum 
of 25°C. 
From a microbiological safety point of view, the diluted product should be used immediately. If not 
used  immediately,  in-use  storage  times  and  conditions  prior  to  use  are  the  responsibility  of  the 
user, but should normally not be longer than 36 hours at 2°C – 8°C followed by up to 6 hours at 
room temperature up to a maximum of 25°C. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal 
products in the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product 
The applicant has sufficiently substantiated their conclusion that the material derived from the 
development and commercial process are comparable.  
Adventitious agents 
The  only  animal  derived materials  from  TSE-relevant  species  used late in  the  development of  the 
cell  banks  is  provided  with  an  EDQM  certificate  of  suitability  and  is  sourced  from  a  geographical 
location  with  a  negligible  TSE/BSE  risk.  No  other  animal-derived  materials  are  used  in  the 
manufacture  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  manufacturing  processes.  Additional 
media  components,  are  manufactured  without  use  of  animal-derived  materials.  None  of  the 
excipients are of animal or human origin. 
The  packaging  material  component  used  throughout  the  process  contain  stearates  and/or  other 
additives  derived  from  bovine  tallow.  These  tallow  derivatives  have  been  processed  at 
temperatures and pressures that are consistent with the requirements of EMA/410/01 rev 3 “Note 
for  guidance  on  minimizing  the  risk  of  transmitting animal  spongiform  encephalopathy  agents  via 
human  and  veterinary  medicinal  products”  and  the  European  Pharmacopoeia.  Tallow  derivatives 
manufactured according to these conditions are unlikely to present any TSE risk and shall therefore 
be  considered  compliant  with  EMA/410/01  rev  3.  A  manufacturer’s  statement  on  BSE/TSE  risk  is 
provided and is deemed acceptable. 
In general, the viral safety of vestronidase alfa is well addressed. The cells banks were assayed for 
adventitious  and  endogenous  agents  according  to  ICHQA5  guideline.  No  viral  particles  were 
observed other than retroviral-like particles normally seen in the MCB and EPC cell types. 
An  assessment  was  conducted  for  all  raw  materials  used  in  the  development  of  cell  lines.  Virus 
validation studies have been performed to meet the CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline. Global reduction 
factors were satisfactory regarding the virus removal/inactivation for enveloped viruses as well as 
for non-enveloped viruses.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During  the  review  two  MOs  were  raised;  the  first  MO  was  related  to  the  control  strategy  which 
needed  to  be  sufficiently  substantiated  by  the  process  evaluation,  especially  with  regard  to 
selection  of  parameters/CPPs/critical  IPCs,  and  associated  ranges  (NORs  and/or  PARs).  MO2  was 
related  to  the  characterisation  exercise  and  its  incompleteness.  Upon  request,  the  applicant 
extensively  improved  the  active  substance  dossier  sections  on  characterisation,  manufacturing 
process,  and  control  strategy  (including  specifications/release  testing),  comparability  during 
development,  and  the  cell  banking  system.  However,  several  recommendations  on  reviewing  the 
active substance methods and limits, when additional experience is gained, have been agreed with 
the  applicant.  The  information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance 
and  finished  product  is  now  considered  satisfactory.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Module  3  of  the  CTD  of  Mepsevii  is  now  of  reasonable  quality;  however,  eight  recommendations 
have been identified and agreed with the applicant.

2.2.4.1.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
UX003 is a recombinant protein developed as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for MPS VII. 
Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the oligosaccharide chains allow binding of the enzyme to 
cell surface receptors, leading to cellular internalization of the enzyme, targeting to lysosomes and 
subsequent catabolism of accumulated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in affected tissues. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The applicant submitted one in vitro study, and one in vivo primary pharmacodynamic (PD) study 
to confirm the pharmacological effect of UX003 in the MPS VII mouse model. The nonclinical 
pharmacology of recombinant GUS, including recombinant mouse (rm-GUS) and multiple 
recombinant human versions of GUS (rh-GUS) was further supported by published in vitro and in 
vivo studies in murine models of MPS VII.  
Three GLP safety pharmacology studies were conducted to assess potential effects on the central 
nervous system (CNS), and on cardiovascular (CV) and respiratory parameters. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
The kinetics of UX003 transport (internalization) into β-glucuronidase-deficient fibroblasts were 
investigated in the presence of M6P, which functioned as a competitive inhibitor of the extracellular 
receptor. Uptake increased rapidly with increasing UX003 enzyme concentration and achieved a 
saturated level of uptake consistent with receptor-mediated uptake. The overall concentration of 
enzyme giving half-maximal uptake (Kuptake) determined from different UX003 lots was 
approximately 0.8 – 1.8 nM.  
Half-life of UX003 in MPS VII fibroblasts (study UGNX-013) 
Human MPS VII fibroblasts were incubated with UX003 at 1, 2 or 4 µg/ml for 19-22h. After a 
recovery period, to allow for the enzyme to be delivered to the lysosomes, cells were harvested at 
various time points between 2-42 days, and the half-life of GUS enzymatic activity was measured 
in fibroblast extracts (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Half-life of UX003 in human MPS VII fibroblasts 
In vivo studies 
A naturally occurring mouse model for MPS VII, has morphologic, genetic, and biochemical 
characteristics that closely mimic those of human MPS VII. Progressive lysosomal GAG storage in 
MPS VII mice affects all organs, including the brain, eye, skeleton, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, 
skin, and circulating granulocytes. In order to confer immune tolerance to human GUS and allow 
longer-term preclinical trials in MPS VII mice, a transgenic mouse model (MPS VII/E540ATG) was 
developed by Sly et al (2001), retaining the clinical, morphological, biochemical and 
histopathological characteristics of the original MPS VII (gusmps/gusmps) mouse but being 
immunologically tolerant to human GUS (by expressing an inactive version of the rhGUS cDNA). 
This has allowed for studies with up to 13 weeks treatment with rhGUS, without the confounding 
occurrence of immune responses. 
Studies conducted with rmGUS and different versions of rhGUS, including UX003 are summarized 
in Table 1, and a selection of these are further described below.

UX003 primary pharmacodynamic bio-distribution study to confirm relationship between 
uGAG and tissue pathology (Study UX003-PC001) 
Male and female transgenic MPS VII/E540ATG mice received UX003 by IV injection once weekly for 
up to 8 consecutive weeks at doses of 0 (vehicle control), 0.1, 0.25, 1, 4, or 20 mg/kg. A recovery 
group at the 4 mg/kg dose level remained on study for a 1-week non-treatment recovery 
evaluation.  
Rh-GUS activity in tissues 
UX003 levels, measured as GUS activity, were found in a variety of tissues. In the majority of 
tissue samples collected approximately 48 hours following the final dose in Week 8, a dose-
dependent increase in tissue levels of UX003 was observed (see also Section 2.3.3 of this report 
under Distribution).  
At 20 mg/kg/week, the highest levels of activity were noted in the liver (~900 U/mg), spleen 
(~600 U/mg), and adrenal gland (~400 U/mg); the lowest levels were noted in brain tissue (~0.7 
U/mg). Tissue activity levels in animals that received UX003 at 4 mg/kg were maintained following 
the 1-week recovery period. Low levels of activity were reported in serum, heart, brain, and 
prostate of the control group animals suggesting that some endogenous GUS production capability 
remains in this mouse strain.

Vacuolization was not observed in tissue samples examined from the adrenal gland, epididymis, 
quadriceps muscle, or prostate in control or UX003-treated MPS VII/E540ATg mice. In tissues with 
vacuolization, treatment with UX003 appeared to result in a dose-dependent reduction in cytoplasmic 
vacuolization in most tissues and tissue elements (Figure 3).

Rh-GUS leads to enzyme activity and reduced lysosomal storage in the brain and other tissues 
(Vogler et al. 2005, CRL 20022037-1, 20022037-2) 
Adult MPS VII/E540ATG mice were treated with IV bolus rh-GUS using once weekly or every-other-
day schedules for up to 13 weeks. The brain from mice receiving 4 mg/kg rh-GUS weekly for 13 
weeks contained, on average, 1.38% of wild-type GUS activity 7 days after the last of 13 weekly 
doses. This group also showed clearance in meninges, parietal neocortical and hippocampal 
neurons and glia, in addition to liver, kidney, and urine. The mice treated with 20 mg/kg once 
weekly for 4 weeks, had even higher enzyme levels in brain, with an average of 2.5% of wild-type 
activity, as well as decreased neuronal, glial, and meningeal storage. No change was observed in 
hippocampal neurons. The brains of mice treated with up to 5 mg/kg once weekly for 3 weeks, had 
much lower levels of enzyme and only moderate reduction in meningeal storage with no change in 
neocortical or hippocampal neurons. Thus, the increased enzyme levels and reduction in lysosomal 
storage in brain correlated with both dose and duration of treatment. 
The pathology slides from this study were available and obtained by the applicant for a blinded re-
evaluation (study reports CRL 20022037-1 and 20022037-2, Figure 5).

MPS VII/E540ATG mice 
rmGUS distributes to multiple tissues and reduces lysosomal storage (Sands et al. 1994) 
MPS VII mice received either six weekly IV injections of rmGUS beginning at birth or a single IV 
injection at 5 weeks of age. One week following the single and sixth weekly injection, rmGUS was 
detected in the liver, spleen, kidney and brain. Tissue activity levels following the sixth weekly 
injection were 28% (liver), 3-5% (spleen), 3-5% (kidney), and 7% (brain) of normal. Tissue 
activity levels following the single injection were 35% (liver), 3-5% (spleen), 3-5% (kidney), and 
1% (brain) of normal. Enzyme activity was undetectable in control MPS VII mice and no detectable 
increase in activity was seen in the tissues of normal mice, with the exception of the brain.  
Clinically, MPS VII mice treated from birth with six weekly enzyme injections were difficult to 
distinguish from normal 6-week old mice; they had nearly normal body weights and reduced facial 
dysmorphism. However, mice receiving only a single enzyme injection at 5 weeks of age were 
phenotypically identical one week later to untreated MPS VII mice of the same age.  
rmGUS prolongs survival and improves growth (Vogler et al. 1996) 
MPS VII mice received six weekly IV bolus injections of rmGUS beginning at birth. Four untreated 
mice were used as controls. Following six weekly IV bolus injections of rmGUS, GUS activity was 
demonstrable for at least 14 days in the fixed tissue macrophage system. The subsequent 
disappearance of GUS activity and the compensatory rebound in elevations of alpha-galactosidase 
and beta-hexosaminidase correlated with the appearance of lysosomal storage in the fixed tissue 
macrophage system.

EMA/480950/2018 
Page 24/87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By 29 days after the last enzyme injection, lysosomal storage material in bone was not different 
from that seen in untreated MPS VII mice. By 85 days, the fixed tissue macrophage system, 
meninges, and brain glia had also accumulated storage comparable to that seen in untreated 
controls. One year after treatment, lysosomal storage was similar to that of untreated MPS VII 
mice in all sites except cortical neurons, where there was still a slight reduction.  
Mice treated for 6 weeks lived longer, were larger, and had milder facial and skeletal deformities 
than untreated MPS VII mice. Although phenotypically still distinguishable as MPS VII mice, these 
long-term survivors were more alert with a more normal gait and coat texture. Their body weight 
was 93.2% of normal, and bone lengths were 91.5% of normal 1 year after discontinuation of 
treatment. In comparison, adult untreated MPS VII animals up to 218 days of age have body 
weights 1.2% of normal and bone length 85.2% of normal. Both body weight and bone length were 
markedly improved in treated MPS VII mice as compared to adult untreated MPS VII mice (p < 
0.01 for body weight; p < 0.025 for bone length).Although bone accumulated lysosomal storage to 
the same extent as in untreated MPS VII mice by 29 days after the last injection, the short course 
of therapy markedly improved bone growth, and morphologic evidence of dysplasia was reduced 
for as long as the 1 year time point.  
rmGUS leads to improvements in phenotype, behaviour and auditory function (O’Connor et al. 
1998) 
Following six doses of treatment with rmGUS (28,000 U; 7 μg), the MPS VII phenotype, 
characterized by dwarfism and flattened facial profile, did not develop to the same extent in treated 
mice as compared to untreated mice. The treated MPS VII mouse was larger, the bone lengths 
were greater, and the facial dysmorphism was less severe than in the untreated MPS VII mouse. 
The more normal phenotype was still apparent at the end of the study when the mice were ~12 
weeks of age. 
MPS VII mice treated with enzyme from birth had histological evidence of reduced lysosomal 
storage in many tissues, including neurons of the brain. Lysosomal distension and storage material 
was reduced or absent in neocortical neurons in treated MPS VII mice when compared with 
untreated MPS VII mice 
The reduced lysosomal storage in the brain was associated with improved mental function as 
measured by improved spatial leaning in the Morris Water Maze test. Although lysosomal storage 
material was not completely eliminated from the CNS after enzyme replacement therapy, 
lysosomal storage was reduced in neocortical neurons of treated MPS VII mice. 
Mice with MPS VII have severe histopathologic abnormalities in the ear, associated with a profound 
hearing loss. In treated MPS VII mice there was a substantial improvement in auditory function 
after treatment and a corresponding improvement in the histopathology of the ear (reduced 
malformations of the ossicles, less middle ear inflammation and mucosa thickening, thinner 
tympanic membranes), when compared with the untreated MPS VII mice.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were submitted as in accordance with the ICH S7A 
Guideline, Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals, the product is a recombinant 
form of a naturally occurring human protein, and its mechanism and site of action (degradation of 
GAGs of dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate in  cellular lysosomes) does not 
suggest any effect or risk that is unrelated to its therapeutic target.

Safety pharmacology programme 
The core battery of GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies was conducted with UX003, in 
accordance with ICH S7A. These studies consisted of an evaluation of respiratory effects in SD rats, 
and an evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular (CV) system effects as part 
of a GLP single-dose toxicity study in SD rats and a GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys, respectively. The studies are summarised in Table 2, and are further described below.

No pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies were submitted as the applicant considered that the 
product as an enzyme replacement therapy will not interact with the pharmacodynamics of other 
drugs. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Characterization of the pharmacokinetic properties of IV administered UX003 was determined as 
part of the toxicokinetics (TK) assessments in the single-dose combined toxicity and CNS safety 
pharmacology GLP study in rats (UX003-PC002) and the 26-week combined GLP repeat-dose 
toxicity and CV safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkeys (UX003-PC003). Limited TK 
sampling was also performed in the IV developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies, 
UX003-PC007 and UX003-PC008 in rats and UX003-PC006 and UX003-PC009 in rabbits. The PK 
and tissue distribution profile of UX003 in male rats was assessed further in a non-GLP single-dose 
study (UX003-PC005).  
Additional nonclinical PK and bio-distribution information on rm- and rhGUS is summarized below 
based on several publications. 
Absorption  
Single dose PK in SD rats (study UX003-PC002, GLP)  
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered single iv infusions of UX003 at 0 (vehicle control), 6 
and 20 mg/kg for 2 hours via pre-implanted catheter.  Serum samples for toxicokinetic analysis 
were collected prior to dose and various time points post dose on Day 1.  
Peak GUS activity was reached at 2.03 hours post start-of-infusion for the treated groups. GUS 
activity exposure (AUC[0-t] and Cmax) was dose proportional for females and slightly greater than 
dose proportional for males between 6 and 20 mg/kg. Exposure was slightly lower in females when 
compared to males. 
Single dose PK in male SD rats (study UX003-PC005, non-GLP) 
Rats received ~2 mg/kg of either UX003 or a research grade lot of rhGUS via iv infusion for 2 
hours. Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-dose and pot-infusion start 
and end.  
Although Tmax was similar for both groups, the mean Cmax for animals dosed with UX003 was 
approximately 3-4-fold higher than the mean Cmax for GUS 43/44. This 3-4-fold difference was also 
evident in the mean exposure (measured by AUC) between the two groups. The mean half-life was 
similar (about 1 hour) between animals dosed with UX003 or GUS 43/44.  
Repeat-dose PK in a 26-week toxicity study in juvenile monkeys (study UX003-PC003, GLP) 
Monkeys (1.5-2 years of age) were administered UX003 (at 0 (vehicle, control), 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg 
every other week by IV infusion every other week for 2 hours via catheter for 26 weeks.  
The 10-fold dose increase between 2 and 20 mg/kg,  resulted in an AUC(0-t) increase up to 99.6-
fold and Cmax increase up to 64-fold. GUS activity doubled between Day 1 and Day 169 except for 
females from the 2 mg/kg group where exposure remained relatively unchanged. Accumulation 
ratios for GUS activity ranged from 0.856 to 2.23 for AUC(0-t). There were no notable sex-related 
differences in GUS activity exposure except at 2 mg/kg on Day 169 where exposure was 
approximately 40% lower in females than males. Female/male ratios ranged from 0.580 to 1.52 for 
Cmax and from 0.548 to 1.67 for AUC(0-t).

In total 16 of 32 animals (2/10 control, 4/6 at 2 mg/kg, 4/6 at 6 mg/kg, and 6/10 at 20 mg/kg) 
screened positive for ADAs at one or more time points during the study. However, 6 of these 
animals screened positive for ADA prior to dosing.  
Distribution 
Bio-distribution Study in MPS VII mice (UX003-PC001) 
In the majority of tissue samples collected approximately 48 hours following the final dose in Week 
8, a dose-dependent increase in tissue levels of UX003 was observed (Table 3). 
Table 3: rh-GUS enzyme activity in MPS VII mice after ERT for 8 weeks with UX003 48 hours 
following the final dose-Study UX003-PC001 
Tissue activity levels (see also Section 2.3.2 under Primary pharmacodynamic studies) in animals 
that received UX003 at 4 mg/kg were maintained following the 1-week recovery period. Low levels 
of activity were reported in serum, heart, brain, and prostate of the control group animals. 
Tissue distribution of UX003 in male SD rats after administration via a single two-hour intravenous 
infusion (study UX003-PC005) 
At approximately 24 hours following dosing of 0 (saline, control) or 2 mg/kg UX003 or rh-GUS  to 
male rats, tissue samples from brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and heart were collected. Tissue 
extracts were prepared and assayed for GUS activity and protein. The level of GUS in rats infused 
with UX003 and rh-GUS was higher than the saline infused rats in most tissues. Highest levels of 
GUS were seen in the liver, spleen and kidney.  
Published bio-distribution studies with recombinant GUS in MPS VII mice models 
Sands et al. 1994 
MPS VII mice received rm-GUS as a single IV injection of 28,000 U at 5 weeks of age, or as six 
weekly IV injections of 28,000 U beginning at birth. One week following the single and sixth weekly 
injection rmGUS activity was detected in the liver, spleen, kidney and brain. MPS VII mice that 
received a single injection had 35% (liver), 3-5% (spleen), 3-5% (kidney) and 1% (brain) of 
normal GUS levels.  
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018

Vogler et al. 1993 
The tissue distribution of rh-GUS was evaluated in newborn MPS VII mice following a single IV 
administration of 3.5 mg/kg (28,000 units). One hour after dosing, GUS levels were equal to or 
greater than normal in every organ evaluated with exception of the brain, where 31% normal 
activity was present. Enzyme was detectable histochemically in the major sites of pathology for 
MPS VII including bone, brain, heart and fixed tissue macrophages. The half-life of rhGUS in 
various organs was 1.5 to 4.5 days. 
Vogler et al. 2005 
Adult MPS VII/E540ATG mice were treated with rh-GUS at varying dose schedules with IV doses up 
to 20 mg/kg. The activity of rh-GUS was measured in tissues 7 days after the last injection. Dose 
dependent enzyme levels were seen in brain, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, bone, muscle and eye 1 
week after the last injection. 
Grubb et al. 2008a 
MPS VII mice were administered rh-GUS via tail vein with enzyme at dose of 4 mg/kg, and the 
activity of rh-GUS was measured in tissues 48 hours after the injection. Enzyme activity was 
detected in brain, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, lung, muscle, bone and eye at levels ranging from 
1.4 % to 482% of the levels seen in the wild-type mice. 
Sly et al. 2006 
The activity of rh-GUS in a variety of tissues from MPS VII/E540ATG mice was assessed following 
treatment with rh-GUS at doses of 0.4, 1.5 or 6.4 mg/kg . Twenty-four hours after a single bolus 
IV infusion, dose-dependent levels of GUS activity were detected in the brain, liver, spleen, heart, 
kidney, lung, muscle and bone.  
Placental transfer - single dose study with rhGUS in mouse (Grubb et al. 2008b) 
The PK profiles of rh-GUS and a chimeric rh-GUS-Fc fusion protein were evaluated following IV 
injection of 3-5 mg/kg into pregnant MPS VII mice.  When rh-GUS was infused into MR+/+ mice, it 
was cleared from the plasma with a t1/2 of 1.7 min. The clearance was slower in the MR-/- mouse 
(t1/2 19 min). The clearance of GUS-Fc (a fusion protein of GUS with the Fc receptor of an 
immunoglobulin) was substantially slower than that of GUS in both the MR+/+and MR-/- mice (t1/2 = 
36 and 72 min, respectively).  
The transplacental transfer of plasma GUS activity following IV administration of GUS or GUS-Fc, or 
PerT-GUS (periodate-treated rh-GUS which cannot be taken into the cell by the mannose receptor 
or mannose-6-phospate receptor) to MPS VII MR+/+ and MR-/- mice was also evaluated in this 
study. Both MR+/+ and MR-/- pregnant females, which were infused with GUS-Fc, produced MPS VII-
/- pups that contained high levels of GUS activity in plasma. By contrast, plasma GUS levels of pups 
from mothers infused with untagged GUS were not above the low residual levels seen in MPS VII-/- 
pups of mothers who received buffer only.  
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies were performed, as in accordance with ICH S6 (R1) guidance, the expected 
consequence of metabolism of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals is the degradation to small 
peptides and individual amino acids.  
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018

Excretion 
No excretion or mass balance studies were submitted, as due to the large molecular size (~332 
kDa homotetramer) of the product, the applicant considered that is unlikely to be renally excreted. 
The end products (amino acids) from its catabolism would be expected to be incorporated into the 
endogenous cellular amino acid pool with a portion of it being excreted. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No PK drug interaction studies were performed, as the product is a recombinant form of a naturally 
occurring human enzyme which is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, and therefore no 
P450 mediated drug-drug interactions are anticipated. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology of UX003 was characterized in a single dose toxicity study SD rats, a 26-
week chronic toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, in an 8-week (with 1-week recovery) 
bio-distribution study in MPS VII/E540ATG mice, and in reproductive toxicity studies in SD rats and 
NZW rabbits. 
Single dose toxicity 
The results from the single-dose toxicity, toxicokinetic and CNS safety pharmacology study in SD 
rats (study UX003-PC002 are described in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 of this report. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
26-week toxicity, toxicology and cardiovascular safety study of UX003 by intravenous infusion 
administration in young cynomolgus monkeys with a 4-week recovery period (study UX003-PC003, 
GLP) 
Animals were also evaluated for clinical observations, ECG, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmic observations, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis and gross necropsy. 
Histopathological evaluation was only performed on the control and high dose groups. 
There were no toxicologically significant findings related to the administration of UX003 in clinical 
observations, food consumption, body weights, veterinary physical examinations and physiological 
measurements. There were no effects of UX003 on haematology, coagulation and urinalysis 
parameters measured during the 26-week study. Effects were limited to mild, transient increase in 
bilirubin in females on Day 4, which were reversible and not considered adverse. There were no 
target organ toxicities identified at the dose levels tested. All dosing formulations tested were 
within acceptance criteria, and enzyme activity results indicated that the enzyme was active after 
the formulation process.  
Repeat dose toxicity data was also investigated in the bio-distribution study to confirm relationship 
between uGAG and tissue pathology (study UX003-PC001). 
Unscheduled deaths occurred in both control and UX003-treated animals (2/6, 1/6, 0/6, 1/6, 1/12 
and 3/6 animals at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 1, 4 and 20 mg/kg/week, respectively). The cause of death in the 
control animals was not determined but may be associated with the age of the animals, the MPS 
VII disease and/or extensive animal handling while on study. In the UX003 treatment groups, all 
mortalities observed at doses ≥1 mg/kg occurred post dose administration in Week 3. The cause of 
deaths in the treated animals was not determined.   
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 30/87 
 
 
 
No significant adverse clinical observations related to UX003 were noted during the study. There 
were no apparent adverse changes in the serum chemistry parameters evaluated.  
The histologic findings included irregular thickening of the heart valve(s) noted in all untreated, 
control group animals with valves present. This finding was also noted in some of the UX003-
treated animals, but generally with reduced severity as compared to the control animals suggesting 
the finding was already present prior to the initiation of treatment. Other findings such as minimal 
to mild inflammation of the liver and eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia of the lung were considered 
to be background or incidental lesions not associated with UX003. 
Published Repeat-Dose Studies in the MPS VII Mouse Model for 3 and 13 Weeks (non-GLP) 
Repeat-dose studies with rh-GUS and rm-GUS have been conducted in MPSVII/ E540ATG mice to 
assess biodistribution, lysosomal clearance and efficacy (Vogler et al. 1996, 1999, 2005). None of 
the studies were conducted as formal GLP toxicology studies.  
In order to confirm the absence of significant pathologic findings in MPS VII tolerant mice, a 
blinded reassessment of all available histological slides from Vogler et al. (2005, see also Section 
2.3.2).  
Histopathological observations, such as inflammation, were uncommon, minimal in severity, and 
considered to be unrelated to treatment with rh-GUS. No histopathologic findings attributable to 
rh-GUS treatment were observed following treatment at weekly IV doses up to 5 mg/kg for 3 
weeks or 4 mg/kg for 13 weeks.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity testing was not conducted, as it is a recombinant form of a naturally occurring human 
protein, whose mechanism and site of action (degradation of GAGs in cellular lysosomes) does not 
suggest any genotoxic risk. Being a large protein, the applicant considered that product is not 
expected to enter the nucleus, interact with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or chromosomes. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with UX003 based on a number of factors as cited in 
ICH S1A “Guideline on the Need for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals”. Per ICH S1A 
Guidelines, “carcinogenicity studies are not generally needed for endogenous substances given 
essentially as replacement therapy (i.e., physiological levels), particularly where there is previous 
clinical experience with similar products. The product belongs to a class of pharmaceuticals, ERTs, 
where there is previous clinical experience. Furthermore, UX003 is recombinant human GUS, which 
endogenously exists in the body; therefore it is not expected to be carcinogenic.

In the Combined Fertility and Embryo Fetal Development Toxicity of UX003 in Rats (study UX003-
PC008), fertility, mating performance, outcome (pregnancy), sperm parameters (motility, count 
and morphology) and male organ weights were unaffected by treatment with UX003. Overall, no 
treatment related differences in litter viability were detected. The percent pre- and post-
implantation loss, were similar across groups. Average number of corpora lutea, live, total implants 
and non-live (resorptions) was similar across groups. The average range for resorptions was ~0.3-
0.7 and no dead foetuses were observed in any of the litters. The percent of live foetuses ranged 
from 95-99%. No statistical significance difference was seen between the UX003 treated groups 
and control group in litter viability data. 
Average litter weights were similar across all groups. No evidence of developmental anomalies or 
malformations, as determined by foetal evaluations (gross external evaluation including litter 
weights, cephalic, visceral or skeletal examinations). Skeletal variations included misshapen 
(dumbbell, bipartite) centra in the controls and incomplete ossification of the skull (14%) and/or 
wavy ribs (9%) in the high dose foetuses. Observations noted in both the skull and rib were 
significantly above the concurrent control but similar to that seen in control fetuses in a historical 
control study (11% and 8%, respectively).  
In the dose-range finding Study with UX003 in Pregnant Rats (study UX003-PC007) UX003 did not 
produce any maternal toxicity, and no significant differences in maternal food consumption, body 
weight, body weight gain, uterus weights and foetal body weights were seen between the treated 
and control groups. Gross external examinations of the foetuses were unremarkable. Total body 
weight corrected for uterus weight was similar across groups. 
Overall, no treatment-related differences in litter viability were detected. The average number of 
corpora lutea, live and total implants was similar across groups, although the number of live 
implants was slightly higher in the treated groups. No dead foetuses were observed, and number of

resorptions was similar across groups. Average foetal weights were similar across all groups and no 
gross external abnormalities were noted in any of the foetuses. Eleven of the 20 dams had a 
positive response for ADA prior to treatment initiation on GD 6.  
In the actual study, these pre-study ADA positives were randomly distributed across the groups (2-
3/group), including controls. However, animals which had a positive response on GD 6 remained 
positive on GD 21. All rats in the UX003 treated groups (2, 6 and 20 mg/kg groups) were ADA 
positive by GD 21 and the magnitude of the response was greater on GD 21 compared to their 
response on GD 6. In addition, litters from the UX003 treated dams also displayed a highly positive 
ADA response. The levels seen in the litters were likely due to maternal antibody transfer to the 
foetus. A positive ADA response was also seen in the control dams (Vehicle alone or Vehicle + 
DHP) on GD 6; however, the response was not magnified on GD 21, nor was the response of their 
litters elevated in the same manner as the litters from the UX003 treated dams.  
In the dose-range finding study with UX003 in pregnant rabbits (study UX003-PC006) serum levels 
of UX003 (GUS) on GD 29 were higher than endogenous levels seen prior to treatment initiation on 
GD 6 in all groups including the controls. GUS levels in foetal blood were lower than endogenous 
levels seen prior to treatment on gestation day 6 in the dams. This was suggestive of no exposure 
of the foetus to UX003 on GD 29.  
Some dams had a positive response for ADA prior to treatment initiation on GD 6. These were 
randomly distributed across the groups, including controls. Animals which had a positive response 
on GD 6 remained positive on GD 29; however, a dose related-increase was seen in the dose given 
6 and 20 mg/kg on gestation day 29. A positive ADA response was also seen in the litters from 
dams treated with 6 and 20 mg/kg treated groups.  
No adverse treatment-related clinical signs were noted in any of the dams during the study, and no 
evidence of a hypersensitivity reaction was noted in any of the dams. No obvious treatment-related 
difference in litter viability was seen between the dams treated with 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg of UX003 as 
the number of corpora lutea, implants and average litter size was similar in the treated and control 
groups. Pre- and post-implantation loss were similar across groups and unaffected by treatment. 
Gross external anomalies were unremarkable and all foetuses were normal. Foetal examinations 
failed to reveal any treatment-related effects, and mean litter body weights of the treated groups 
were comparable to controls; as such UX003 did not adversely impact foetal growth. 
In the embryo-foetal development toxicity of UX003 in rabbits (UX003-PC009), no adverse 
treatment-related clinical signs were noted in any of the does during the study, and no evidence of 
a hypersensitivity reaction was noted in any of the doses. No treatment related differences were 
observed in litter viability, pre- and post-implantation loss, average number of corpora lutea, total 
implants, live foetuses or litter viability. Litter (average foetal) body weights were similar across 
groups and unaffected by treatment with UX003.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data are presented in Section 2.3.3.  Additional TK data were collected through the 
reproduction toxicity studies. 
Repeat-dose PK in a combined iv fertility and developmental toxicity study in SD rats (study 
UX003-PC008, GLP) 
Animals were administered UX003 at 0 (vehicle control), 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg/dose via intravenous 
infusion for 30 minutes. All male rats were dosed for 6 weeks. Female rats were dosed once a week 
for 2 weeks prior mating and every third day during pregnancy.

Systemic exposure of UX003 after weekly IV infusion were substantially greater than dose 
proportional in male and female rats (Table 5). 
Repeat-dose PK in an embryo-foetal development study in NZW rabbits (study UX003-PC009, GLP) 
Pregnant rabbits were administered UX003 at 0 (vehicle control), 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg on GD 6, 9, 12, 
15 and 18 by iv infusion for 30 minutes. Blood for TK and ADA was collected prior to treatment 
initiation and periodically during the study as well as on GD 29 from the does and litters (pooled 
foetal blood). TK parameters at gestation day 18 are presented in Table 5.  
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated nonclinical local tolerance studies for UX003 were conducted. However, no gross or 
histopathological abnormalities attributed to UX003 were observed at the IV infusion sites in the 
single dose rat toxicity study or the 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus 
monkeys (UX003-PC002 and UX003-PC003, respectively).  
In the single dose rat study (UX003-PC002), minimal or mild, chronic inflammation, endothelial 
hyperplasia, and/or thrombosis were observed at the administration site (jugular vein) of some 
control and UX003-dosed animals which were attributed to the presence of the indwelling jugular 
catheter.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The levels of Rh-GUS activity observed in the different tissues in the primary PD study conducted 
by the applicant were comparable to that observed in the prior (Vogler et al. 2005) study, for the 
same dose levels.  
In the same study, a substantial, dose-related and consistent reduction of serum and urinary GAG 
in UX003-treated mice was demonstrated. Treatment with UX003 also resulted in a dose-
dependent reduction in cytoplasmic vacuolization in most tissues. This reduction started at the 
lowest dose tested in well-perfused tissues, including tissue macrophages or endothelium. Less 
well-perfused tissues, such as the renal tubules, connective tissues, or neurons, required higher 
doses of UX003 to reduce storage. The effect on the brain neurons indicates that small amounts of 
rh-GUS may cross the blood-brain barrier as has been suggested in the past  (Vogler et al. 2005). 
Other tissues such as heart valvular and epicardial stromal cells may be considered partially 
resistant to treatment.  It should be noted, however, that there also appears to be reduced 
cytoplasmic vacuolization in these tissues as well 
The reduction in urinary GAG corresponded to a reduction in several tissue pathology scores. In 
tissues such as kidney tubular epithelium, bone osteocytes, bone surface lining cells, and heart 
normal pathology was achieved only when urinary GAG levels are reduced by 50% or more. Thus 
far, all subjects treated with the intended therapeutic dose of 4 mg/kg every other week have 
achieved at least a 50% sustained reduction in urinary GAG. 
IV bolus injection of a fixed-dose of rm-GUS initiated at birth have shown reduced pathological 
evidence of disease and prevented some of the learning, memory, and hearing deficits in the MPS 
VII mouse (Sands et al. 1994, Vogler et al. 1996, O'Connor et al. 1998), but only if treatment  
begun before or during the second week of life. After that age, no therapeutic effect was seen in 
the neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the CNS.  
Similarly, results from Sands et al. 1994 and Vogler et al.1996, have shown the importance of 
early treatment with GUS in order to achieve GAG degradation in the rapidly growing skeleton 
which could have an impact on bone development. 
Vogler et al 2005, have shown that reduction of lysosomal storage in the brain is related to dose 
and duration of treatment. Slides from this study were available and re-evaluated by the applicant. 
This analysis showed that treatment with rh-GUS resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in 
lysosomal storage in the majority of tissues, including CNS (neurons, glial cells, cerebellar 
perivascular cells and meningeal cells). Finally, O’Connor et al. 1998, provided evidence to suggest 
that that some of the learning, memory, and hearing deficits can be prevented in MPS VII mice if 
enzyme replacement therapy is initiated early in life. 
The  non-clinical  safety  pharmacology  of  IV  administered  UX003  has  been  characterized  in  GLP  in 
vivo  studies,  conducted  at  dose  levels  up  to  20  mg/kg  in  the  SD  rat  (single  dose)  and  in  the 
juvenile  cynomolgus  monkey  (combined  26-week  repeat  dose  toxicity/TK/CV  study).  No  UX003-
related  effects  were  seen  on  the  respiratory  system  (study  UX003-PC004)  or  the  CNS  (evaluated 
by  FOB  endpoints  in  study  UX003-PC002)  in  SD  rats,  or  on  cardiovascular  parameters  in 
cynomolgus monkeys (study UX003-PC003).  
No  pharmacodynamics  drug  interaction  studies  were  performed,  and  this  was  considered

Pharmacokinetics 
In the pivotal reproductive toxicity study in rats (study UX003-PC008), the systemic exposures of 
UX003 after weekly IV infusion were substantially greater than dose proportional in male and 
female rats. Overall, the estimated clearance (CL) decreased when the dose increased, 
independently of sex. Mean serum UX003 half-life (t1/2) in males was inversely related to dose on 
Day 22 (Dose 4), ranging from 5.15 to 0.362 hours at 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose, respectively. 
Female rats showed a more modest range of serum t1/2 values from 1.01 to 0.516 hours (non-
gestational) or from 4.77 to 3.5 hours (gestational).  
Serum levels of UX003 were substantially reduced at end of dosing in high-dose pregnant females, 
attributed  to  the  development  of  ADA.  However,  while  ADA  was  confirmed  present  in  both  males 
and  females,  similar  reduction  in  serum  UX003  levels  were  not  seen  in  males  or  non-pregnant 
females. The mid- and high-dose males appeared to achieve a similar Cmax levels at the beginning 
and  end  of  the  study  (Day  1  and  Day  29,  respectively).  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  pregnant 
females  were  dosed  for  a  longer  period  and  a  higher  dosing  frequency  than  the  males  and  non-
pregnant  females.  This  might  lead  to  higher  ADA  titres  in  pregnant  females  at  gd18,  than  in  the 
males at dosing day (D29) and non-pregnant females (D15), leading to reduced exposure levels.  
The systemic exposure of UX003 in gestational rabbits was greater than dose proportional. There 
was little or no change in mean Cmax (same as EOI concentration) on GD 9, 12 and 15 across all 
UX003 dose groups; however, individual low and mid-dose animals had variable reductions in Cmax 
on GD 12 and/or 15, with GD 18 mean concentrations at EOI reduced by roughly 70% at the low 
dose. At the mid-dose, mean Cmax was reduced by roughly 20% on GD 18 versus GD 15, and at the 
high dose, only 1 of 3 animals had a lower Cmax (roughly 65%) on GD 18 compared to GD 15. The 
presence of ADA in adult (and fetal) samples in UX003-treated animals on GD 18 and 29 
(terminal), suggest a likely impact of ADA on exposure on GD 18, most notably at the low dose. 
Enzyme  activity  levels  were  dose-related  following  repeated  dosing  for  8  weeks,  and  enzyme 
activity levels remained above vehicle control levels one week after end of dosing. In most tissues 
the enzyme activity levels at end of recovery were  reduced relative to the activity level at end of 
treatment (34-88%), however, in some tissues the activity levels were increased (104-142%). 
Even though placental transfer of UX033 has not been studied, Grubb et.al have shown that trans-
placental transfer of rhGUS is limited in MPS VII mice. 
As  per  ICH  S6  (R1)  guidance,  the  expected  metabolism of  biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals 
is the degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that 
classical biotransformation studies were not necessary for UX003. 
Because  of  the  large  molecular  size,  UX003  is  unlikely  to  be  renally  excreted.  The  end  products 
(amino acids) of its catabolism are expected to be incorporated into the endogenous cellular amino 
acid pool. Therefore the absence of excretion or mass balance studies was considered acceptable. 
Finally  as  UX003  represents  a  recombinant  form  of  a  naturally  occurring  human  enzyme  no  P450 
mediated drug-drug interactions are anticipated.

Toxicology 
No significant adverse clinical observations related to UX003 were noted in any of the toxicology 
studies. This is consistent with published repeat-dose studies with recombinant mouse and human 
GUS.  
Intravenous infusion of UX003 every 2 weeks for 26 weeks at dose levels up to 20 mg/kg was well 
tolerated by juvenile cynomolgus monkeys.  
Unscheduled deaths were observed in the primary pharmacodynamic study (Study UX003-PC001). 
Cause of death was not determined in the animals receiving UX003 but may be due to test article-
related immune responses to UX003 despite immune toleration. Immune allergic reactions are 
expected and commonly observed in ERT studies in animal models. 
No major findings were reported in the combined fertility and embryo fetal development toxicity of 
UX003 in rats. Litter viability was unaffected by treatment with UX003 at doses up to 20 
mg/kg/day and there was no evidence of UX003-related developmental anomalies or 
malformations, as determined by foetal evaluations (gross external evaluation including litter 
weights).The higher incidence of incomplete ossification of the skull and wavy ribs in the animals 
treated with the highest dose of UX003 were not considered adverse since such variants are known 
to occur in control/untreated animals, are reversible and were not associated with any condition or 
pattern that would be indicative of frank malformations or teratogenesis. However, as the applicant 
did not submit a Developmental and Perinatal/Postnatal Reproduction Study as stipulated in ICH S6 
(R1) guidance, the conduct of such a study in rats is recommended to detect any potential effects 
of Mepsevii in offspring development. 
Similarly, no findings were reported in the dose-range finding studies with UX003 in pregnant rats 
and rabbits, other than a high number of ADA positive responses prior to treatment. This high rate 
of false positives may be related to the assay cut point that was used. However, the applicant 
provided a validation report which demonstrated that the assay was robust and may be used to 
reliably compare pre- and post-treatment results to interpret, as an initial screen, whether anti-
rhGUS antibodies may have developed in rabbits or rats treated with the therapeutic. 
UX003 is a large protein molecule which is not expected to cross the nuclear or mitochondrial 
membrane and interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. Furthermore, is a 
recombinant form of the naturally occurring human GU with a mechanism of action that does not 
suggest any genotoxic or carcinogenic risks. Therefore the lack of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
studies with UX003 was considered acceptable. 
In accordance with Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Product for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), the applicant did not submit any environmental 
risk assessment studies as UX003 is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of vestronidase alfa have 
been adequately characterised from a non-clinical perspective. A Developmental and 
Perinatal/Postnatal Reproduction study in rats is recommended to further characterise the potential 
reproductive toxicity effect of vestronidase alfa in line with the ICH S6 (R1) guidance.

Paediatric population 
In the ongoing open-label Phase 2 study UX003-CL203,  MPS VII patients of less than 5 years old, 
received 4 mg/kg vestronidase alfa by slow infusion (4h). Due to the young age of the study 
participants, the blood sampling scheme for this study only included 2 samples to be taken post-
end of infusion, and thus only Cmax, tmax and AUC0-t are reported. Pharmacokinetics were 
evaluated at week 0 and 24 and the results are shown in Table 8.

after logarithmic transformation of values (data not shown). The allometric scalars for vestronidase 
alfa clearance and volume were estimated to be 0.33 (90% CI: 0.094 – 0.57) and 0.36 (90% CI: 
0.078 – 0.64), respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were submitted, as the applicant considered that the 
product as an enzyme replacement therapy would not interact with other drugs. 
Antibodies 
In Study UX003-CL301, 5 of the 12 subjects in the study had no or negligible titers (≤1:40). In 
six subjects, the formation of antibodies was treatment emergent (no pre-existing ADA) and one 
subject had pre-existing background antibodies. Of the seven ADA positive subjects, two had low 
to moderate ADA titer (<1:5,000) and five had moderate titers (>1:5,000). Subjects tested ADA 
positive after 8 to 16 weeks of treatment with vestronidase alfa and their titers peaked between 8 
and 40 weeks of treatment. 
Neutralizing activity (NAb) was detected in five of the ADA positive subjects in the in vitro cell-
based assay at one or more time points. A comparison of vestronidase alfa clearance and 
disposition subjects who tested positive for neutralizing anti-UX003 antibody (NAb) at any time 
point in the treatment course, and those who tested negative for Nab is shown in Figure 11. 
Figure 11. Box plots comparing clearance (Cl) and disposition half-life (t1/2) in subjects tested 
positive or negative for neutralizing anti-drug antibody 
In Study UX003-CL201, the two subjects developed anti-rhGUS antibodies and were treatment 
emergent (no pre-existing ADAs) and there was no pattern of dose-dependency.  
One subject developed ADAs following 8 weeks of treatment and the peak titer (1:10,240) was 
reached at week 60. The ADA titer reduced to 1:40 at the last two assessed time points, weeks 96 
and 108. Neutralizing antibody activity was only detected at a single time point (week 72) when 
the subject was receiving 2 mg/kg vestronidase alfa QOW.

The other subject developed ADAs following approximately 22 weeks of treatment with the highest 
titer reached (1:5,120) at the week 36 and 60 time points. ADA titer was reduced to 1:80 at the 
last assessed time point, week 120. No neutralizing antibody activity was detected for this subject. 
There was no correlation between the percent change in uGAG and ADA titer with either subject 
(data not shown). 
One subject included in the study did not have a confirmed positive titer at any assessment. 
In Study UX003-CL203, antibodies specific for rhGUS were detected in 2 of the 4 subjects. The 
anti-rhGUS antibodies were negative in the neutralizing activity assay for all subjects and at all 
time points tested.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Vestronidase alfa is a recombinant form of human GUS and is intended to provide exogenous beta-
glucuronidase for uptake into cellular lysosomes. Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the 
oligosaccharide chains allow binding of the enzyme to cell surface receptors, leading to cellular 
internalization of the enzyme, targeting to lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated 
GAGs in affected tissues.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A summary of the effect of vestronidase alfa treatment on uGAG (DS) levels across the 3 clinical 
studies is presented in Table 9.

Dose response 
In study UX003-CL201, dose levels of 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 4 mg/kg QOW were evaluated. 
Vestronidase alfa serum exposures increased with increasing doses, and exceeded the 
concentrations required for tissue uptake starting from 1 mg/kg QOW and considered to have 
reached the point of saturation at 4 mg/kg QOW with observed mean Cmax and time-averaged 
concentrations of vestronidase alfa at many-fold of Kuptake. The vestronidase alfa PD biomarker, 
the change in uGAG dermantan sulfate (UGAG DS), showed rapid, sustained and apparently dose-
dependent reduction from baseline (Figure 13).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Vestronidase alfa (UX003) is a recombinant form of the human enzyme beta-glucuronidase and is 
to be administered once every 2 weeks at a dose of 4 mg/kg.  After repeated dosing of 4 mg/kg 
every other week, the maximal serum concentration (Cmax) was 20.0 ± 8.1 µg/mL. 
In MPS VII patients, after end of infusion, vestronidase alfa serum concentrations fell rapidly, 
followed by a mean elimination half-life of about was 2.6 ± 0.6 hours (range: 0.9 to 3.6 hours).

Clearance was 0.079 ± 0.045 l/h/kg. Decrease in clearance after multiple dosing is expected to be 
the result of saturation of uptake into lysosomes and elimination. The lack of specific excretion 
studies to investigate the elimination of vestronidase alfa was considered acceptable as it is a 
protein which is expected to be degraded similarly as the endogenous enzyme to smaller proteins 
and amino acids. 
The mean vestronidase alfa Vss in patients receiving 4 mg/kg/qow ranged from 0.03 - 0.19 l/kg, 
indicating that vestronidase alfa is not distributed beyond the plasma and extracellular water 
volumes. Plasma protein binding studies were considered not applicable for vestronidase alfa, as it 
is a protein and not expected to significantly interact with plasma proteins. 
Descriptive pharmacokinetic data from doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg/qow in a limited number of 
patients indicate a more or less dose proportional pharmacokinetics at steady state. Inter-
individual variability in clearance was about 20 - 35%. 
Vestronidase alfa showed time independent pharmacokinetics. 
After multiple dosing, no effect of gender and race on the clearance and Vdss of vestronidase alfa 
was observed. Limited data suggest that vestronidase alfa serum clearance decrease less than 
proportionally with decreasing body weight, but the serum levels of vestronidase alfa are still well 
above the saturation levels of the estimated Kuptake value of 0.3 μg/ml, and therefore there is no 
expected impact in the younger age group.  
No data were submitted regarding evaluation of pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment. This was considered acceptable considering that vestronidase alfa is a protein and 
therefore no clinically relevant effect of renal or hepatic impairment is expected. 
Across the 3 clinical studies, approximately half of the subjects developed ADAs on vestronidase 
alfa therapy, approximately half of whom further developed NAb at some time points, but not 
consistently over time. Antibody titers were generally low to moderate and not associated with an 
impact on the levels of uGAG. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were not performed for vestronidase alfa. Vestronidase 
alfa is a protein and pharmacokinetic interactions with co-administered drugs subject to 
cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism are unlikely to occur. 
Pharmacodynamics 
All 19 treated subjects in the studies with evaluable PD data achieved at least a 50% sustained 
reduction in uGAG with continuous administration of vestronidase alfa at the proposed commercial 
dose of 4 mg/kg QOW. This reduction was achieved regardless of disease severity or baseline 
uGAG. Maintenance of uGAG reduction is dependent on ongoing rhGUS treatment effect and is not 
a result of prior depletion of uGAG stores. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The available pharmacokinetic data even though limited are considered sufficient, given the type of 
product and limited use of the pharmacokinetics of this product to predict efficacy and safety. 
A sustained pharmacodynamic effect of vestronidase alfa in reducing baseline uGAG in MPS VII 
patients has been demonstrated.

The Initial Treatment Period was referred to as a 12-week period in the protocol though exposure 
to vestronidase alfa was 14 weeks; the dosing schedule for this 14-week period was accurately 
reflected in all versions of the protocol. 
b
 Duration of treatment is the number of weeks from the first dose through the last dose + 2 
weeks (e.g., Initial Treatment Period dose administration occurs every other week (QOW) at Week 
0 through Week 12; therefore, duration of treatment is 14 weeks). 
c 
Dosing was IV QOW throughout the study. 
Five (5) subjects were planned and 3 were ultimately enrolled in this study due to limited patient 
availability. 
Inclusion criteria included: Confirmed diagnosis of MPS VII based on leukocyte or fibroblast 
glucuronidase enzyme assay or genetic testing confirming diagnosis; elevated uGAG excretion at a 
minimum of 2-fold over the mean normal for age.  
Exclusion criteria included: Subjects who had undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell 
transplant or had any degree of detectable chimaerism with donor cells; any known 
hypersensitivity to rhGUS or its excipients that, in the judgment of the Investigator, placed the 
subject at increased risk for adverse effects. 
The primary efficacy variable was total uGAG excretion normalized to urinary creatinine 
concentration. The secondary efficacy variables included 6MWT, 3MSCT, pulmonary function testing 
(spirometry) (FVC, FEV1, and MVV), PGI-C scale, visual acuity, hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiac 
ventricular mass (echocardiogram).  
Five major protocol deviations were reported in the study. Three were reported under “Treatment 
Compliance”, and one each was categorized as “Other” or “Procedure Not Done”. All major protocol 
deviations were reported after the forced-titration period of the study. 
MPS VII was diagnosed based on enzyme activity level in leukocytes for all 3 subjects; genetic 
testing was not performed. Other than symptomatic care, no subject had been treated for MPS VII 
prior to the study and no subject had a family history of MPS VII.

All three subjects had manifestations of MPS VII in their medical history. Prior medications reported 
were limited.  
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
There was a rapid reduction in uGAG excretion (DS and CS) in all three subjects after treatment 
initiation at 2 mg/kg QOW. Dose-responsive changes in DS and CS were observed during the 
Forced-dose titration Period with mean of 42.18% reduction in DS at 1 mg/kg QOW, 61.76% 
reduction at 4 mg/kg QOW, and 52.4% reduction at 2 mg/kg QOW. The mean CS excretion was 
reduced by 47.7% at 1 mg/kg QOW, 58.97% reduction at 4 mg/kg QOW, and 54.76% reduction at 
2 mg/kg QOW. 
The changes in levels of DC excretion per subject over time are presented in Figure 14.

DS = dermatan sulphate; Note: One Subject (shown in orange diamond) completed dosing through Week 118 
with an incomplete dose at Week 86 (2.5% completion) and with missed doses at Weeks 88, 90, and 92. The 
2nd Subject  (shown in grey circle) completed dosing through Week 132 with missed doses at Weeks 74, 96, 
118, and 122. The 3rd Subject  (shown in light pink square) completed dosing through Week 124 with missed 
doses at Weeks 112 and 116. 
Secondary endpoints 
Six minute walking test 
 One subject walked 285 m (35.9% predicted based on age and sex) at baseline. Variable results 
and several missed assessments were seen between Weeks 6 and 96. An improvement of 105 m 
from baseline was reported at Week 120 (distance walked = 390 m; 49.6% predicted)but this was 
likely due to additional medicial procedure  performed over the same time.  
Pulmonary Function  
At baseline and throughout the study, only one subject was able to complete pulmonary function 
testing, showing an improved pulmonary function on vestronidase alfa treatment with 21% 
increase in FVC and 36% increase in MVV from baseline to Week 120. There was no appreciable 
change in FEV. The other two subjects were not able to follow testing instructions due to age and 
cognitive impairment.  
Other secondary endpoints

A reduction in liver size to normal was seen in the two subjects with baseline hepatomegaly.   
Modest improvement was seen in fine motor function on the BOT-2 assessment for one subject. 
Two subjects reported improvement on the MPS HAQ Self-care and Mobility composites, and the 
majority of domains. Improvement in the Caregiver Assistance score was also reported for these 
two subjects. 
All three subjects were reported to have more endurance/less fatigue on the PGI-C.

Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the following: 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 51/87 
 
 
 
 
•  Efficacy of vestronidase alfa in MPS VII subjects as determined by the percent reduction of 
uGAG excretion after 24 weeks of treatment relative to the pre-treatment baseline. 
Secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate: 
•  Safety and tolerability following up to 48 weeks of vestronidase alfa exposure 
•  Efficacy of vestronidase alfa in MPS VII subjects as measured by a multi-domain clinical 
responder index following 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa exposure 
•  Efficacy following 24 weeks of treatment as determined by the proportion of subjects 
achieving a positive individualized clinical response (ICR) outcome 
•  Clinical effects including pulmonary function, walking distance, shoulder flexion, fine motor 
function, and gross motor function following 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa exposure 
Other objectives of the study were to evaluate the following changes after 24 weeks of treatment 
from the last measurement before crossover: 
•  Measures of lysosomal storage including GAG substrate serum levels and 
hepatosplenomegaly 
•  Measures of other clinical and functional outcomes 
•  Physician and subject or parent/caregiver global assessment of change and impact on 
activities of daily living 
•  Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy analysis tested the mean percent change in uGAG DS excretion over 24 weeks 
of treatment for significant reduction from the pre-treatment baseline (defined as the average of all 
assessments prior to beginning UX003 treatment).  
This primary assessment was supported by multiple secondary and tertiary variables. This included 
a novel MDRI which was intended to capture the aggregate benefit or decline across multiple 
domains of clinical function: 6MWT, FVC, shoulder range of motion, visual acuity, and BOT-2 fine 
motor and gross motor function.   
For each MDRI domain, a minimally important difference (MID) was established based on data for 
other related diseases (Table 11). To compute the MDRI, changes over time (e.g. from before 
treatment to 24 weeks after treatment) in each domain variable were scored based on the MID. An 
improvement or decline equal to or greater than the MID was scored either a +1 or -1 respectively, 
and a change less than the MID was scored as a zero. The integration of benefit occurred by 
summing the responses, positive, negative or zero, across all domain variables to derive the 
subject-specific MDRI score. If a subject was unable to reliably or safely perform a particular 
assessment, that domain was scored as 0 for that subject.

The Pediatric Quality of Life Multidimensional Fatigue Scale (PedsQL-Multidimensional Fatigue 
Scale) was administered to evaluate treatment-related changes in fatigue. A change of 10 points of 
total score was considered an MID. 
For each subject, an Individualized Clinical Response Endpoint (ICR) was determined as a single 
clinical measure with the highest impact on the individual subject was selected by the investigator 
from possible clinical endpoints based on the specific concerns of the subject, parents, and 
caregivers that were reported during the Clinical Problem Evaluation. The percent of patients 
achieving a response in their pre-specified ICR after 24 weeks of treatment with UX003 was 
calculated. 
Sample size 
Based on modelling of the Blind Start design, and given prior information on the degree of 
reduction, the expected sample size of 12 subjects provides an 88% chance of rejecting the 
hypothesis of no change from baseline in the uGAG excretion when the true mean change is equal 
in magnitude to the standard deviation of change. 
These 12 subjects with MPS VII were planned, enrolled, and treated in the study. All enrolled 
subjects completed the study and were analysed. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to Groups A, B, C, or D and assigned to a treatment 
sequence group via an Interactive Web Randomization System (IWRS). There was no stratification. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted as a randomized, blind start, single crossover, placebo-controlled study. 
Blinded conditions were established so that neither the sponsor (with the exception of a single 
dedicated person who was responsible for managing study treatment assignment), nor subject, nor 
site personnel involved in study conduct knew the group to which the subjects were randomized.

Statistical methods 
Statistical tests were 2-sided at the alpha=0.05 significance level. All p-values were presented as 
nominal p-values. Continuous variables were summarized with means, standard deviations, 
medians, minimums, and maximums. Categorical variables were summarized by counts and by 
percentages of subjects in corresponding categories.  
The primary analysis method applied for percent reduction ([(uGAG- Baseline uGAG)/Baseline 
uGAG] x100) from baseline uGAG used a general estimating equation (GEE) model (Hanley et al. 
2003), at 24 weeks of treatment. In general, baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to 
or on the date of initiation of treatment with vestronidase alfa. For uGAG, baseline was defined as 
the average of all assessments prior to or on the date of initiation of treatment with vestronidase 
alfa (excluding screening visit). 
The model for percent change from baseline of uGAG included baseline and the post UX003 
initiation time points as a categorical variable. The covariance structure within subjects was 
assumed to be exchangeable.  
In general, missing data was treated as missing unless otherwise specified. When a change from 
baseline was assessed, only subjects with a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement 
were included in the analysis. Using the GEE approach to analysis, missing data were not be 
replaced; all available data were used and the model parameters are simultaneously estimated 
using all of the observed data. Descriptive summary statistics were provided where the GEE 
procedure could not be performed because of the limitation of available sample sizes.  
GEE modelling was the primary analysis method for all repeated measures endpoints. All the key 
secondary endpoints are measured every 8 weeks throughout the study (week 0 to week 48). The 
last assessment for each patient prior to or on the date of UX003 treatment initiation will be used 
as baseline. 
The multi-domain responder index, the main secondary endpoint was tested first at the 0.05 level. 
No adjustment for multiplicity was performed to the rest of the secondary endpoints due to the 
small size of this study. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 12 subjects were enrolled and completed the 48-week study. There were no deaths or 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and no withdrawals from study. 
Recruitment 
Study Start: 02 Dec 2014  
Study Finish: 04 May 2016  
Conduct of the study 
There were ten major protocol deviations reported in the study, including two of each categorized 
as “procedure not done” or “treatment compliance” and the remaining six categorized as “other”, 
including five study entry criteria waivers. These patients did not meet the inclusion criterion #2, 
which required elevated uGAG excretion at a minimum of 3-fold over the mean normal for age. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 54/87 
 
 
 
 
 
rationale for granting these waivers was based on the accumulating scientific information on the 
accuracy of the method used during the screening phase of the study.  
Back-up screening samples from the five subjects granted waivers in the UX003-CL301, were re-
tested using the more precise LC-MS/MS method that was developed after the study had enrolled 
the patents (and validated for use in assessing the primary endpoint of the study) This assay 
confirmed all five subjects had substantially elevated uGAG DS and uGAG (CS) levels 14- to 22-fold 
and 10- to 27-fold over the normal range for their age, respectively, thereby confirming that the 
DMB assay may not be reliable for the MPS VII patient population.

All 12 subjects had abnormalities in their medical history. The SOCs that were reported in more 
than 50% of subjects were: Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (91.7%); nervous 
system disorders (83.3%); cardiac disorders (75.0%); congenital, familial, and genetic disorders 
(75.0%); general disorders and administration site conditions (75.0%); infections and infestations 
(75.0%); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (75.0%); hepatobiliary disorders 
(66.7%); skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (66.7%); investigations (58.3%); surgical and 
medical procedures (58.3%); and gastrointestinal disorders (50.0%). Skeletal deformities were 
present in nearly all subjects and included kyphoscoliosis, hip and knee dysplasia, short stature, 
pectus carinatum, odontoid hypoplasia, cervical spinal stenosis, genu valgum, claw hand, painful 
gait, joint and bone pain, frequent orthopaedic surgeries and restricted mobility. Four subjects 
used a wheelchair or walking aid more than 50% of the time. 
Notably nearly all subjects had cognitive disabilities manifesting as developmental delay, language 
delay and intellectual impairment which affected their abilities to complete certain clinical 
assessments. More than a quarter of subjects had cardiac valve disorders at Baseline: aortic valve 
incompetence and aortic valve sclerosis at 25% each; mitral valve incompetence (33%); and mitral 
valve stenosis (25%). 
Because of the rarity of the disease, selection criteria for subjects able to do all the Clinical 
outcome assessments or meeting certain disease level targets could not be applied and essentially, 
all comers had to be enrolled in the study. Therefore, the subjects enrolled in the study had highly 
variable disease manifestations and various physical and/or cognitive limitations. As expected, 
there were a number of non-assessable clinical outcomes at Baseline for some subjects: 6MWT

(three subjects that could not walk); FVC (nine subjects too young or cognitively impaired to 
perform this complex test); BOT-2 fine motor (one subject); BOT-2 gross motor (five subjects); 
visual acuity (five subjects could not understand the eye chart test).  
A total of eight subjects (66.7%) had a history of prior medication use. The highest reported use 
was in the anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic class of medications (such as naproxen [three 
subjects, 25%]). The other classes of medications were: anti-epileptics, medications for obstructive 
airway diseases, muscle relaxants, nasal preparations, and other respiratory system products. 
Numbers analysed 
The efficacy analyses were based on the full analysis set. Safety analyses were based on the safety 
analysis set. The full analysis set was defined as all subjects who were randomized (ITT 
population), and received at least 1 dose of study drug or placebo. The safety analysis set was 
defined as all subjects who were randomized and receive at least 1 dose of study drug or placebo. 
All 12 (100%) subjects who were enrolled in the study were included in both efficacy and safety 
analyses sets. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Overall, a rapid, marked, and sustained reduction in uGAG DS was observed at treatment week 24 
(Figure 16).  
Figure 16. Percent Change from Baseline in uGAG DS Excretion at vestronidase alfa Treatment 
Week 24 (by LC-MS/MS, GEE) in Study UX003-CL301 
At Week 2, the percentage reduction LS means (SE) was -54.30% (2.813%) and statistically 
significant (p<0.0001). From Week 4 through Week 22, uGAG DS excretion showed a LS means 
percentage change from baseline of at least -60.0% (p<0.0001 at each treatment week). 
Individual uGAG DS response (% change from baseline) 
The individual subject uGAG DS response to vestronidase alfa treatment is displayed in as percent 
change from Baseline for each subject (Figure 17). At Baseline, the levels of uGAG DS were 27.5 
(SD=7.74) fold above the upper limit of normal. At vestronidase alfa Treatment Week 24, the 
levels of uGAG DS were 9.95 (SD=1.69) fold above the upper limit of normal.

Of note, during the placebo dosing period, one subject in group D was accidently dosed with active 
treatment instead of placebo on one occasion at study week 18 (6 weeks prior to planned first 
vestronidase alfa dose). The subject’s uGAG levels were rapidly reduced upon active treatment 
(indicated by the arrow in Figure 17). The levels returned once resuming placebo again; after 
crossover to the active treatment period, uGAG levels were consistently reduced. 
Additional Analyses of uGAG 
uGAG Responder Analysis (LC-MS/MS-DS) 
The proportion of responders i.e. subjects with ≥ 50% decrease in uGAG excretion (μg/mg 
creatinine)) during the first 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa treatment was assessed. All 12 subjects 
(100%) reached at least a 50% reduction from Baseline in uGAG DS sometime during the first 24 
weeks of vestronidase alfa treatment (95% CI, 0.718, 1.000) 
The percentage change from Study Week 0 in uGAG DS by study week is provided in Table 13.

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
MDRI 
Treatment response as assessed by MDRI at vestronidase alfa Treatment Week 24 was positive 
with a mean score (±SD) improvement of +0.5 (±0.8) domains (t-test p=0.0527. Of the 12 
subjects, six had a MDRI score of +1 or more. Five subjects had a score of 0 (indicating no 
change), indicative of no worsening of this progressive disease (Figure 17). One subject with -1 
MDRI score had an acute viral illness on (blinded) vestronidase alfa Treatment Week 24 visit.

When any domains are missing for MDRI at vestronidase alfa Treatment Week 24, the MDRI domain at 
vestronidase alfa Treatment Week 32, if it exists, is used for imputation. If the MDRI domain at vestronidase 
alfa Treatment Week 32 is missing, then the MDRI domain at vestronidase alfa Treatment Week 16, if available, 
is used. The missing values are counted as 0 to calculate MDRI total score uGAG responders are subjects who 
ever reached >= 50% reduction from baseline in uGAG excretion during the first 24 weeks of vestronidase alfa 
treatment. 
Not assessable at Baseline: defined as when the subjects could not perform the test at Baseline visit (prior to 
vestronidase alfa treatment) due to the disease and/or age/cognition. Missing (post baseline): When a subject 
had baseline evaluation but the domain score at treatment week 24 was missing and could not be imputed. 
Week 24 was the pre-specified assessment visit for the MDRI; however, an additional analysis was 
performed examining subjects with clinically important changes in 1 or more domains at any time 
point during treatment (Table 14).

Post-hoc Analyses of a Modified MDRI Including the Fatigue Score 
The original proposal for the MDRI included fatigue as a key measure that could be assessed in a 
variety of MPS VII subjects, both severely and mildly affected. To evaluate the inclusion of fatigue 
in the MDRI as originally planned, a post-hoc analysis on a modified MDRI at vestronidase alfa 
Treatment Week 24 was performed (Table 16).

Supportive studies 
Study UX003-CL203 
UX003-CL203 is an ongoing open-label, Multicentre, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and 
efficacy of vestronidase alfa in paediatric MPS VII subjects. The results from an interim analysis are 
presented (13 July 2017 data cut off).  
The pre-specified primary endpoint was the mean percent change in uGAG excretion from baseline 
at Week 48. Available data for the primary efficacy variable are presented as the percent change in 
uGAG excretion from baseline by subject and time point.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Overall  the  population  studied  encompasses  23  patients  with  12  included  in  the  pivotal  phase  3 
study  (UX003-CL301).  All  12  patients  enrolled  in  the  pivotal  study  had  comorbidities  and 
complications  in  their  medical  history,  as  would  be  expected  in  this  chronic  multi-systemic 
progressive  disease.  Nearly  all  patients  included  in  the  various  studies  had  cognitive  disabilities 
manifesting as developmental delay, language delay and intellectual impairment.  
Supportive data are provided by the dose finding study (UX003-CL201) and Study UX003-CL203, 
an ongoing open-label study of vestronidase alfa in paediatric MPSVII patients less than 5 years 
old. To date, 8 paediatric patients have been included.  
Based  on  the  medical  history  adult  patients  appeared  to  be  mildly  affected  by  the  disease,  in 
contrast to some of the paediatric patients enrolled. The age of diagnosis and the age at enrolment 
for  these  patients  also  suggest  that  the  disease  presentation  and  severity  within  the  included 
patient population is heterogeneous. 
Notably in  study  UX003-CL201,  2  of  3 patients  had  hydrops  fetalis,  in  study  UX003-CL203  2 of  8 
patients had hydrops fetalis and in study UX003-CL301 two of 12 patients had hydrops fetalis. In 
study  CL301  these  two  patients  were  diagnosed  MSPVII  around  age  10  years,  indicating  that 
hydrops fetalis as such is not predictable for disease severity, in line with the conclusions drawn by 
Montaño et al., 2016.  
Given the rarity of the disease the number of patients included in the clinical development 
programme is considered acceptable. 
The pivotal study, UX003-CL301 was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, blind start, 
single-crossover Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of vestronidase alfa in MPS VII 
subjects aged 5 to 25 years. All patients from study UX003-CL301 all have been transitioned to the 
open-label long-term follow-up study UX003-CL202. 
Subjects  were  randomized  to  one  of  4 groups,  each  representing  a  different  treatment  sequence, 
and crossed over to vestronidase alfa at different predefined time points in a blinded manner. The 
blind start, within patient design makes efficient use of the small number of patients. The placebo-
control provides a valid comparator, even if treatment with placebo was only for a limited period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 65/87 
 
 
 
 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  reduction  of  uGAG  excretion  after  24  weeks  compared  to  baseline 
whilst the secondary endpoint was a multi-domain responder index which aggregated the benefit or 
decline  across  multiple  domains  of  clinical  function.  Six  domains  were  planned:  6MWT,  FVC, 
shoulder  range  of  motion,  visual  acuity,  and  BOT-2  fine  motor  and  gross  motor  function.  A 
minimally  important  clinical  difference  (MID)  was  determined  for  these  endpoints,  using  available 
information  from  other  diseases  settings.  An  additional  domain  was  used  post-hoc  to  evaluate 
treatment-related changes in fatigue.  
The 6MWT has been used as an efficacy endpoint in all MPS pivotal clinical trials and formed the 
basis of approval for 4 ERTs in the EU (Wraith et al., 2004, Muenzer et al., 2006, Harmatz et al., 
2006, Hendriksz et al., 2015). Of note, the inclusion criteria in those studies ensured that enrolled 
patients could walk a minimum distance at baseline. The applicant selected  the change from 
baseline in 6MWT for the most recently approved MPS ERT, elosulfase alfa, for MPS IVA as a basis 
for establishing the MID of 23 m in Study UX003-CL301. Due to rarity of the disease, enrolment 
was not restricted to patients who could walk a certain distance, and also included another MID 
criterion of a minimum 10% improvement in 6MWT for added rigor because 23 m would be a 
relatively small improvement in a patient who walks well, for example over 500 meters, at 
baseline. 
For FVC, clinically relevant improvements in pulmonary function have been reported on the basis of 
changes in percentage predicted FVC (FVC% pred) across a wide range of diseases. Studies 
measuring bronchodilator response in asymptomatic adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) report improvement in percentage predicted FVC% pred in the range of 4% to 
9.6% (Toren et al., 2017, Tan et al., 2012). In a study of patients with Duchenne’s Muscular 
Dystrophy (DMD), a 4.1% difference in FVC% pred with idebenone compared to placebo was 
significant (p = 0.004). 
On the basis of the consistent range of 4% to 10% reported in the literature the applicant used a 
5% absolute change in FVC% pred as the MID, along with a 10% relative change from baseline 
because of the anticipated broad range in baseline pulmonary function in this heterogeneous 
population.  
The MID for shoulder flexion of 20 degree change of passive shoulder range of motion (ROM) was 
established on the basis of clinical results from other MPS ERT clinical studies (Wraith et al., 2004, 
Harmatz et al., 2006, Clarke et al., 2009).  
The MID for visual acuity of 3 lines, corrected, in both eyes is consistent with literature reports of 
clinically significant changes in visual acuity in studies of ophthalmological treatments (Reeves et 
al., 1993, Arch-Ophthalmol 1999). If corrected visual acuity was not obtained at baseline, changes 
were assessed based on the uncorrected visual acuity. 
Changes in fatigue were assessed by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL)-
Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, which has been widely used in various paediatric patient 
populations including chronic debilitating illnesses. An interventional study in paediatric cancer 
patients reported a significant change from baseline in fatigue total score of 9.2 after 1 year (Keats 
et al., 2008). Due to the lack of available data in MPS VII, the applicant defined a change from 
baseline of 10 in fatigue total score as the MID in Study UX003-CL301.  
Considering the rarity and heterogeneity of the disease the CHMP considered the selection of 
endpoints and the MIDs as determined by the applicant acceptable to evaluate the efficacy of 
vestronidase alfa as an enzyme replacement therapy in MPS VII. Moreover, the CHMP also 
considered that use of the MDRI was appropriate as it could have been expected that not all 
subjects would be able to perform all tests and thus using a responder analysis could potentially 
capture measurable meaningful responses to treatment within the short duration of a clinical trial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 66/87 
 
 
 
However, the CHMP noted that evaluation of the effect of treatment on fatigue in this setting is 
very challenging and therefore the clinical relevance of the reported changes in fatigue is very 
difficult to interpret (see also Additional Expert Consultation).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  dose  finding  study  (UX003-CL201)  a  total  of  three  subjects  were  enrolled.  For  dermatan 
sulfate (DS), the mean reduction from baseline for the 3 subjects was 61.76% at the highest dose 
of  4  mg/kg  QOW,  compared  with  a  42.18%  and  52.40%  reduction  at  the  1  and  2  mg/kg  QOW 
doses, respectively. These data support the results of the pre-clinical studies and the choice of the 
4mg/kg QOW dosing regimen. 
In the pivotal study, at baseline, the levels of uGAG DS were 27.5 (SD=7.74) fold above the upper 
limit of normal. At Week 24, the levels of uGAG DS were 9.95 (SD=1.69) fold above the upper limit 
of  normal.  This  clear  and  consistent  (over  all  patients)  effect  demonstrates  the  pharmacological 
action  of  vestronidase  alfa.  Additional  analysis  (uGAG  Responder  Analysis  and  Parallel  Group 
Analysis of uGAG Reduction) support this conclusion. 
The  mean  (±  SE)  improvement  of  the  6MWT  was  20.8  ±  16.75  m  (p=0.2137).  The  patient 
population  as  a  whole  did  not  reach  the  MID of  23 meters.  Further  analysis  showed  that of the  6 
patients  with  available  6MWT  results,  4  showed  an  improvement  over  the  defined  MID  with  2 
patients reporting a stabilisation of the 6MWT after 72+ weeks of treatment in study UX003-CL202. 
For  FVC%pred  only  information  on  2  patients  was  available.  No  conclusions  can  be  drawn  for  the 
respiratory endpoint. 
Shoulder flexion showed little to no change (at 24 weeks mean reduction in flexibility was -6.5 
(4.86) degrees) because most subjects had no appreciable joint restriction at baseline and all 
subjects had at least 110 degrees of mobility. This is in contrast to other MPS disorders in which 
limited range of motion is a frequent clinical problem. In the MPS I Phase 3 study without selection 
for joint disease, about half the subjects had < 90 degrees of shoulder flexion at baseline versus 
normal 160 degrees and only those with < 90 degrees contributed to the demonstration of efficacy 
in reducing joint stiffness/mobility (Wraith et al., 2004). 
Four subjects showed at least a 2 line improvement on the Snellen eye chart in one or both eyes. 
Only  one  patient  reached  the  MID  (applicant  defined)  of  3  lines.  One  patient  reported  a 
deterioration of 2 lines. No clear and consistent clinical relevant change can be observed. 
For the BOT-2 related analysis each scale score showed a minimal mean change from baseline. No 
clear and consistent clinical relevant change can be observed. 
A  nominal  increment  of  the  Fatigue  Total  Score  is  seen  for  a  number  of  patients.  Given  the 
difficulties  in  assessing  fatigue  especially  in  a  condition  like  MPS  VII,  the  clinical  significance  of 
these results remains unclear. 
Based on the defined MID of the 12 subjects, six had a multi-domain responder index (MDRI) score 
of +1 or more. Five subjects had a score of zero (indicating no change). One subject had a score of 
-1  at  the  Week  24  visit.  As  about  32%  of  the  results  are  missing  any  analysis  is  seriously 
hampered, described in more detail below. The results suggest that patients in general experience 
an  increased  stiffness  of  the  shoulders.  For  the  other  endpoints  no  consisted  beneficial  or 
detrimental  effect  can  be  observed.  Further  no  patient  can  be  identified  with  beneficial  effects  on 
all evaluated domains.  
The  interpretation  of  the  MDRI  responder  analysis  is  very  complicated,  due  to  the  combination  of 
the limited information on the natural course of the disease, the within patient variation during the 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 67/87 
 
 
 
placebo period, the heterogeneity of effect between the patients, and the large number of missing 
values (23 out of 72 assessments could not be evaluated) and the imputation method used. If any 
domains were missing at treatment week 24 the value of week 32 – if existing – was used. If this 
measurement was also missing the value at week 16 was used. The fact that patients missed the 
moment of evaluation could lead to a selection of more positive measurements, due to the fact that 
the patient was unable to perform the measurement at the moment when the visit was missed.  
In  addition,  the  protocol  describes  that  “If  a  subject  is  unable  to  reliably  or  safely  perform  a 
particular assessment, that domain will be scored as 0 for that subject”, assuming no deterioration 
for this subject over time. This seems to be done for 3 patients (when the subject had a baseline 
measurement, but the 24 weeks post baseline value was not available and could not be imputed). 
Given the progressive nature of the disease it is unclear whether no change is the best assumption 
for patients that are unable to perform the measurement. However, with this small total number of 
patients, actual results are sensitive to this alternative (more conservative) imputation across 25% 
of the patients.  
In  addition,  the  6  domains  of  the  MDRI  show  considerable  variation  over  time,  also  within  the 
placebo  period  of  one  patient,  so  this  variation  cannot  be  attributable  to  any  treatment  effect.  In 
contrast to a parallel clinical trial, the blind-start crossover design does not allow for a comparison 
with placebo over the full duration of the trial. The general pattern shows variability between and 
within  patients,  with  the  overall  average  pattern  stable  over  time  (fine  motor  skills  (BOT-2  fine), 
visual  acuity,  and  6MWT).  In  most  cases  this  average  stability  includes  the  placebo  period;  there 
are  some  patients that  did  show  more  clear improvement  compared  to  their own  placebo pattern 
(e.g., 2 patients in 6MWT, 1 (out of 5) in BOT-2 Gross motor). FVC and shoulder flexion data are 
considered not relevant; hence these are not discussed by here.  
Overall, the data suggest that patients remained stable throughout 48 weeks treatment. Due to the 
open label setting and the limited number of patients no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
The  positive  individualized  clinical  response  (ICR)  was  defined  as  the  single  clinical  measure  with 
the highest impact on the individual subject as chosen by the subject. In this group of 12 patients 
6MWT was chosen as ICR by 7 patients, 4 chose fatigue and 1 patient chose the BOT-2 fine score. 
Of the 7 patients choosing the 6MWT, 3 reported an improvement over the applicant’s defined MID, 
none  of  the  7  patients  reported  deterioration.  Of  the  patients  with  fatigue  chosen  as  ICR,  1 
deteriorated and the remaining 3 did not report any change. The patients with the BOT-2 fine score 
as ICR did not report a clinical relevant effect.  
Based  on  the  evaluated  clinical  endpoints  in  the  clinical  studies  with  vestronidase  alfa,  it  can  be 
concluded  -  that  in  most  patients  (11/12)  in  the  pivotal  study  a  positive  trend  towards 
improvement  of  part  of  the  disease  symptoms  or  at  least  stabilisation  can  be  observed.  Both 
stabilisation and improvement of disease symptoms are to be considered beneficial for the patient. 
The clinical relevance of these effects remains to be established.  
In the adult patients the treatment effect may not be as obvious as observed in paediatric patients. 
Adult  patients  may  have  built  up  more  irreversible  damage  (i.e.  skeletal  problems)  which  may 
hamper  demonstrating  a  clear  beneficial  effect,  on  the  other  hand  the  adult  patients  may  have 
milder disease problems, and thus less improvement is to be gained. Similar for paediatric patients 
for instance growth, and increased in lung capacity, may impact the observed results as well. 
To  make  the  physicians  (and  patient/caretaker)  more  aware,  the  applicant  included  an  additional 
warning in SmPC section 4.4 to reflect that the administration of vestronidase alfa does not affect 
the irreversible complications (such as skeletal deformities).  
Further  due  to  the  fact  that  not  all  patients  respond  with  a  clinical  relevant  improvement  the 
applicant  included  a  warning  in  SmPC  section  4.4  stating  that  “the  effects  of  treatment  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 68/87 
 
 
 
vestronidase  alfa  should  be  periodically  evaluated  and  discontinuation  of  treatment  should  be 
considered in cases where clear benefits (including stabilisation of disease manifestations)  are  not 
observed.”  
The  CHMP  considering  the  totality  of  the  data  and  the  comments  raised  by  the  Ad-Hoc  Expert 
Advisory  Group  concluded  that  the  population  that  could  be  treated  with  vestronidase  alfa  should 
include patients of all ages. The CHMP noted that available data indicate that patients most likely to 
benefit the most are younger patients. Therefore, it is important that treatment is initiated as early 
as possible in patients in order to prevent damage from prolonged accumulation of polysaccharides 
in the various tissues. 
Additional expert consultation 
An Ad-Hoc Expert Advisory Group was asked to provide their view on the following issues: 
Question 1 
How do you judge the clinical relevance of the observed effects of vestronidase alfa on 
the pharmacodynamic and functional outcomes in patients with MPS VII? 
The  expert  group  highlighted  the  difficulties  in  ascertaining  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed 
effects  with  vestronidase  alfa,  given  that  the  natural  history  of  the  diseases  is  not  well 
characterised. In light of this as well as the slowly progressive course of the disease, the duration 
of the submitted trials limits the possibility to observe the effect of treatment on clinical outcomes.  
The  group  however  acknowledged  the  difficulties  in investigating  this  condition  given  the  rarity of 
the disease, the wide range of clinical symptoms and the variability in disease severity. In addition, 
the Group noted that a number of patients included in the trials were not able to perform some of 
the  required  tests  to  evaluate  functional  outcomes  which  further  restricts  the  ability  to  evaluate 
clinical relevance of the treatment effect.  
The  group  agreed  that  the  submitted  results  demonstrate  a  clear  pharmacodynamic  effect 
(reduction in urinary accumulation of substrate (GAGs) in patients who had received vestronidase 
alfa. For an enzyme replacement therapy such an effect would be a prerequisite even though not 
sufficient on its own to confirm a clinical benefit. Given the difficulties in evaluating this condition, 
the group considered that it would be difficult to expect at this stage any additional data to provide 
further evidence of a positive treatment effect.  
The group finally highlighted that even though fatigue is a very relevant variable for many patients 
including  those  with  MPS  VII,  interpretation  of  results  for  this  symptom  is  very  difficult  in  this 
condition due to the lack of validated tools to objectively measure the pharmacodynamic effect on 
fatigue. 
Question 2 
Can  the  expected  clinical  benefits  of  vestronidase  alfa  be  extrapolated  to  patients  with 
MPS VII, not included in the clinical trial programme? For instance, can the experts give 
their  views  on  the  role  of  vestronidase  alfa  in  the  most  severe  manifestations  i.e. 
patients  with  hydrops  fetalis,  hepatosplenomegaly  and  lung  aplasia,  asymptomatic 
patients or those with very mild symptoms or late onset of disease? 
The  group  noted  that  in  addition  to  the  difficulties  in  demonstrating  a  clinical  relevant  treatment 
effect in MPS VII summarised in the response to Question 1, an additional limitation was the age of 
patients  included  in  study  UX003-CL301  (median  age:  14  years).  The  group  considered  that  it 
would be reasonable to expect that a more pronounced clinical effect could have been observed if 
patients  had  initiated  treatment  earlier  in  life.  Therefore,  the  group  advised  that  it  would  be 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 69/87 
 
 
 
important not to place an age restriction to the patients that would be eligible for treatment as this 
could exclude patients with a high potential to benefit from vestronidase alfa.  
The  group  also  noted  that  despite  the  lack  of  data  on  patients  with  hydrops  faetalis,  there  is  no 
reason to expect that the benefits of vestronidase alfa could not be extrapolated to these patients. 
The  group  expressed  some  concerns  over  the  need  to  treat  patients  with  very  mild  symptoms  or 
later onset of disease. These patients may have restricted disease, such as neurological or skeletal 
symptoms,  which  are  not  responsive  to  treatment.  Initiation  of  treatment  would  thus  have  to  be 
carefully considered by the treating physician on the basis of potentially reversible symptoms, with 
appropriate stopping criteria to be defined before treatment start. Treatment solely on the basis of 
the presence of fatigue should not be encouraged. 
Question 3 
Within the different phenotypes of Sly disease, are there any patients you would expect 
not  to  benefit  from  vestronidase  alfa  treatment?  Are  there  any  disease  related  or 
prognostic factors that can be helpful to decide which patients should be treated or not 
treated? 
As mentioned above, available data on the natural history of the disease are limited and there are 
no  prognostic  factors  which  could  help  determine  which  patients  should  be  treated  or  excluded 
from treatment.  
The  data  available  from  the  submitted  trials  also  do  not  allow  for  identification  of  patients  that 
would not benefit from treatment, again with the restriction that neurological or skeletal symptoms 
cannot be reversed by treatment.  
Question 4 
Given the rarity of the disease and the limited data available, further information in the 
post-marketing  setting,  most  likely  in  the  form  of  a  registry,  would  be  important. What 
would  be  the  most  relevant  efficacy  and  safety  outcome  data  for  a  disease  registry  to 
further evaluate the effects of vestronidase alfa? 
The  expert  group  emphasised  the  need  for  a  disease  registry,  which  could  help  to  collect  further 
information  in  this  very  rare  condition.  The  experts  considered that  such  a  registry  should  ideally 
be  under  the  governance  of  physicians  with  experience  in  treating  patients  with  MPS.  In  addition 
the  experts  highlighted  that  given  the  lack  of  knowledge  in  this  condition  it  would  be  of  great 
importance  if  data  collected  in  this  registry  could  be  available  to  clinicians  or  academics  with  a 
research interest in MPS to enhance the understanding of the disease. 
In terms of data collection, the experts considered that it would be important to collect information 
on all proposed domains in the studies, including height, weight and growth in children as well as 
neutralising  antibodies,  GAGs  and  their  potential  impact  on  clinical  efficacy  and  safety.  For  the 
purpose of biochemical markers and antibodies, an international biobank linked to the clinical data 
in the registry was suggested. It would also be important to measure respiratory function and that 
this  should  include  outcomes  for  both  restrictive  and  obstructive  lung  function.  The  experts  also 
noted that given the wide spread of affected system organs it would be important to capture in the 
registry complications of the disease such as hospitalisations and surgical interventions. 
Finally,  the  group  advised  that  due  to  the  limited  number  of  available  patients,  data  collection  in 
this  registry  should  be  aligned  worldwide  as  much  as  possible  despite  the  possibly  different 
regulatory requirements in different regions.

Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set 
on the clinical efficacy of Mepsevii under normal conditions of use could not be considered 
comprehensive as the clinical significance of the numerical improvements observed for a number of 
clinical endpoints following Mepsevii treatment cannot be established. Moreover, due to the 
heterogeneous nature of the disease, with various physical and cognitive limitations, not all clinical 
outcome tests could be performed by every subject which further hinders the evaluation of the 
reported effects of treatment. 
The CHMP noted that it is not feasible to generate a comprehensive data set due to the rarity of the 
disease and the variability in clinical symptoms and severity of the condition which means that 
there is no disease specific validated clinically relevant endpoint. Moreover, due to the slowly 
progressing nature of the disease it is reasonable to expect that in order to demonstrate 
statistically compelling effects, clinical trials of longer duration would be required. Such placebo-
controlled trials are not considered feasible due to ethical considerations.  
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances should be granted subject to a specific obligation, the Mucopolysaccharidosis VII 
Disease Monitoring Program.  This is a global, prospective, multi-centre, longitudinal study which 
will enable to further characterise MPS VII disease presentation and progression over time in 
patients and evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of treatment with Mepsevii.  Data 
collection from this study will also enable further characterisation of longitudinal change in 
biomarkers, clinical assessments, and patient/caregiver reported outcome measures, and other 
possible predictors of MPS VII disease progression and mortality. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clear pharmacodynamic effect (in urinary accumulation of glycosaminoglycans) has been 
demonstrated for vestronidase alfa from the data submitted in patients with MPS VII. For the 
clinical endpoints available, a trend of numerical improvement was seen for some of the clinical 
endpoints evaluated which could suggest stabilisation of the condition of the patients included in 
the trials. Considering that disease progression is slow, the true magnitude of the treatment effect 
will probably require a treatment over longer periods of time than the conducted studies.   
Therefore, it was concluded that vestronidase alfa is an effective treatment option for patients with 
MPS VII. 
However, the CHMP considered that the available data set on the clinical efficacy was not 
comprehensive and that the specific obligation would be necessary to generate additional efficacy 
data in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances: 
• 
The Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII Disease Monitoring Program, to evaluate long term 
effectiveness of treatment and the long-term safety profile of Mepsevii 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 23 patients are included in the safety database from the for the UX003 clinical 
development program comprising of four clinical studies including: two completed clinical studies, 
UX003-CL301 (N=12) and UX003-CL201 (N=3), and two ongoing clinical studies, UX003-CL202 
(data lock point (DLP: 12 June 2017, N=10) and UX003-CL203 (DLP: 23 May 2017, N=8). All

subjects from UX003-CL202 were rolled over from UX003-CL30l, however, subjects are counted 
only once in the cumulative analysis. 
The cumulative analysis therefore includes 23 unique subjects treated with UX003 for a duration of 
up to 132 weeks as of the DLP.  
Adverse events 
95.7% of patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during vestronidase 
alfa treatment.  Most reported TEAE for the combined studies were: cough (47.8%), vomiting 
(47.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (43.5%), infusion site extravasation (34.8%), rash 
(30.4%), diarrhoea (30.4%) and pyrexia (30.4%). 
The most common adverse reactions from 4 clinical trials in patients treated with Mepsevii were 
anaphylactoid reaction (13%), urticaria (13%), infusion site swelling (13%), infusion site 
extravasation (8.7%), pruritus (8.7%), diarrhoea (8.7%) and rash (8.7%).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in any of the vestronidase alfa clinical studies. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Eight patients experienced SAEs across all clinical trials (Table 18). No SAE term was reported by 
more  than  1 subject  across  any  clinical  study  and  no  subject  discontinued  treatment  or  withdrew 
from the study due to an SAE.

 All subjects in Study UX003-CL202 rolled over from Study UX003-CL301 
Most of the reported SAEs were considered related to complications of MPS VII. Four SAEs were 
assessed as related to UX003 and are described below: 
In Study UX003-CL301, there was one SAE of anaphylactoid reaction that occurred after 
inadvertent bolus infusion of the enzyme during the first hour of the infusion assessed as related to 
UX003 by the investigator and Applicant. The event resolved and the infusion was re-initiated that 
day without recurrence of symptoms; the infusion was completed. 
In UX003-CL202, one subject experienced SAEs of bronchospasm and urticaria during UX003 
administration assessed as related to UX003 by the investigator and Applicant. Infusion was 
interrupted and events resolved following treatment with antihistamine (clemastine) and 
salbutamol. 
In the UX003-CL203 study, an SAE of febrile convulsion was assessed as related to UX003 by the 
investigator and Applicantthat occurred three days after diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) 
vaccination. The event resolved and subject continued on treatment 
Adverse Events of Hypersensitivity 
There  have  been  two  reports  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  in  two  different  subjects,  both  in  study 
UX003-CL301.  One  subject  experienced  a  Grade  3  treatment-related  anaphylactoid  reaction 
following a too rapid (bolus) infusion during the first hour of vestronidase alfa treatment. The event 
resolved  and  the  infusion  was  re-initiated  that  day  without  recurrence  of  symptoms;  the  infusion 
was  completed.  The  subject  received  subsequent  infusions  without  recurrent  symptoms  and 
completed the study. 
The second subject experienced a Grade 1 treatment-related anaphylactoid reaction during the first 
dose of vestronidase alfa. The subject’s symptoms included temperature 37.3 °C and diaphoresis. 
No  treatment  was  given  and  the  subject  resumed  vestronidase  alfa  treatment  with  no  further 
complications.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  did  not  recur  with  subsequent  infusions  and  the  subject 
completed the study. 
Overall,  across  the  clinical  development  program,  there  were  only  two  reported  events  of 
hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid reaction) in 453 infusions (0.4%, including partial infusions). 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018

Infusion-associated Reactions 
Infusion-associated  reactions  (IARs)  were  defined  as  AEs  occurring  from  the  onset  of  the  study 
treatment  infusion  up  to  four hours  following  the  end  of  infusion,  regardless  of  the  Investigator’s 
causality assessment.  
In  study  UX003-CL301,  two  out  of  9  (22.2%)  subjects  experienced  two  IARs  (infusion  site 
discomfort,  body  temperature  increased)  while  on  placebo  treatment.  Eight  subjects  experienced 
ten IARs during vestronidase alfa treatment, which mostly involved problems with the IV catheter 
(infusion  site  extravasation,  infusion  site  swelling,  and  peripheral  swelling).  The  majority  of  IARs 
reported  were  assessed  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  with  one  Grade  3  treatment-related 
anaphylactoid  reaction  secondary  to  an  infusion  rate  error.  Observed  IAR  symptoms  included 
respiratory distress, fever, diaphoresis, infusion site swelling and infiltration, pruritus, and ataxia.  
All  12  reported  IARs  resolved  with  9  resulting  in  drug  treatment  interruption  and  3  requiring  no 
treatment  intervention.  None  of  the  subjects  discontinued  study  treatment  or  discontinued  from 
study participation as a result of an IAR. 
In  the  Ongoing  Open-label  Under  5  Years  of  Age  Phase 2  Study  UX003-CL203,  one  subject 
experienced  IARs  of  Grade  1  abdominal  pain  and  diarrhoea  on  Study  Day  281,  which 
recovered/resolved without action.  
Anti-drug antibodies 
Sixteen  out  of  23  patients  (70%)  from  4  clinical  trials  developed  anti-recombinant  human  beta-
glucuronidase  (rhGUS)  antibodies  (ADA),  nine  of  whom  further  developed  neutralizing  antibodies 
(NAb) on at least one occasion, but not consistently over time. 
The  median  CL  was  slightly  higher  for  patients  who  tested  NAb  positive  at  anytime  during  Study 
UX003-CL301 (0.0816 and 0.0603 l/hr/kg for NAb positive and negative, respectively). The median 
t 1/2 was 2.48 hr for the patients who tested NAb positive at anytime during the study compared to 
2.94 hr for those patients who never tested NAb positive.  
No  general  trend  or  relationship  was  observed  between  vestronidase  alfa  CL  and  total  antibody 
titre. Similarly, no general association was observed between total antibody titre and vestronidase 
alfa t 1/2. 
In  Study  UX003-CL201,  only  one  patient  tested  positive  for  neutralizing  anti-drug  antibody  (NAb) 
during the study. The positive NAb was reported at Week 72, 36 weeks after the last PK data were 
available for this patient. 
No patient tested NAb positive at any time in Study UX003-203. 
Spinal/Cervical Cord Compression 
Three of 23 subjects experienced events of spinal/cervical column compression in the clinical 
development programme. One subject developed lower extremity paresis following inguinal hernia 
repair, and subsequently developed quadriplegia following spinal cord decompression surgery 
assessed as unrelated to treatment. Two other subjects developed spinal/cervical column stenosis 
without severe complications assessed as unrelated to treatment but rather a complication of MPS 
VII.   
Febrile Convulsion  
One patient experienced a febrile convulsion during treatment at the week 66, within 3 days of 
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccination. The infusion was stopped, the patient received 
anticonvulsants, antipyretics and antibiotics, and the febrile convulsion resolved. The patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 74/87 
 
 
 
 
subsequently was re-challenged without recurrence and continued treatment. This event was 
assessed as possibly related to treatment due to the temporal association with the infusion.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology  
No  clinically  significant  changes  were  observed  in  haematology  laboratory  values  in  any  of  the 
clinical studies. 
Chemistry 
The majority of chemistry laboratory values in the clinical studies with vestronidase alfa were not 
considered  to  be  clinically  significant;  however,  two  subjects  were  found  to  have  abnormal  liver 
function  tests  (one  case  of  elevations  in  serum  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  alkaline 
phosphatase  (ALP),  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  and  Gamma-Glutamyl  Transferase  (GGT), 
and  one  case  of  elevated  ALT).  In  both  subjects,  no  AEs  were  reported  in  association  with  the 
elevations  in  liver  function  tests  and  there  was  no  treatment  interruption  or  medical  intervention 
required. 
Four  TEAEs  were  reported  in  association  with  observed  abnormal  chemistry  laboratory  values 
(increases in ALP, ALT and GGT) in study UX003-CL203. No treatment interruptions were required 
for these TEAEs. 
Vital Signs 
No clinically significant changes were observed in vital signs in any subject exposed to vestronidase 
alfa.  
The  subject  who  experienced  an  anaphylactoid  reaction  secondary  to  an  accidentally  high  (bolus) 
infusion  rate  became  diaphoretic  with  perioral  cyanosis  and  oxygen  saturation  dropped  to  82% 
during  the  event.  The  event  resolved  and  the  subject  received  subsequent  treatment  without 
further complications. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The overall potential of drug interactions for vestronidase alfa is low, and therefore no specific in 
vitro drug interaction studies were submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects discontinued from study drug or withdrew due to an AE. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database is quite limited and includes data from 23 patients. Given the rarity of MPS VII 
this was considered acceptable, and additional information is expected to be collected from the 
MPS VII Disease Monitoring Program that the applicant will establish.  
Most adverse event reported (≥20% reported) were respiratory infections, cough, vomiting, 
infusion site extravasation, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, rash and arthralgia. The observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 75/87 
 
 
 
 
treatment adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity. There were no deaths during 
the studies.  
In total, 12 infusion-associated reactions (IARs were reported in the clinical studies. Ten of those 
were reported in eight patients in study in study UX003-CL301. In the same study, 2 of the 9 
patients in the placebo group also reported IARs. Nine of the IARs resolved with drug treatment 
disruption. No IARs were reported in UX003-CL201, and in study UX003 CL203 one patient 
reported an IAR.  
Two patients experienced anaphylactoid reaction (one reported as grade 3). In the patient with 
grade 3 anaphylactoid reaction the adverse event was thought to be related to rapid infusion in the 
first hour, this reversed when the treatment was interrupted and emergency medication was 
provided. Other related adverse reactions were pruritus, local infusion site reactions such as 
infusion site extravasation and infusion site swelling, diarrhoea, rash, and rash popular. None of 
the patients discontinued study treatment or discontinued from study participation as a result of an 
IAR. 
The product information includes a warning on hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and 
that appropriate medical support should be readily available when vestronidase alfa is 
administered. In addition, premedication with non-sedating antihistamines with or without 
antipyretics to be administered 30-60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion is recommended. 
Finally the importance of administration according to the recommended infusion rate schedule is 
highlighted, and that the infusion should be stopped immediately if severe hypersensitivity 
reactions occur, and appropriate treatment initiated.   
In the pivotal study 6 patients were positive for NAbs. Only one of these patients had two 
consecutive positive outcomes for NAbs (at week 40 and week 46). Three patients from the other 
studies also developed NAbs. Based on the available pharmacokinetic data there seems to be a 
minor effect of NAbs on t1/2. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown.  
Overall, the analysis of the patients with NAbs did not indicate an apparent clinical impact in the 
measured outcomes, the applicant is expected to follow up and submit more data on the NAb 
status of the patients in the Disease Monitoring Program study. Immunogenicity is included in the 
RMP as an important potential risk, and further information will be collected through this Disease 
Monitoring Program that the applicant will perform. 
Spinal /cervical cord compression is one of the expected complications of MPS VII that may be 
observed at clinical presentation and progression. During enzyme replacement therapy, spinal cord 
injury can occur due to improved neck and spine mobility. Therefore, spinal /cervical cord 
compression has been included in the RMP as a potential risk and patients with MPS VII receiving 
Mepsevii should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression or neck 
instability including neck or back pain, weakness of limbs, changes in reflexes or urinary and faecal 
incontinence. Appropriate clinical treatment should be immediately sought. 
No clinically significant changes were observed in haematology and chemistry laboratory values in 
any of the clinical studies. 
Safety in pregnancy and lactation as well as the safety of the product in patients with hepatic or 
renal impairment has not been characterised, as relevant patients were not included in the 
submitted studies. These issues have been included in the RMP as missing information, as well as 
long term use and will be addressed through the planned Disease Monitoring Program. 
No drug-drug interaction studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable considering that 
vestronidase alfa is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and unlikely to be involved 
in drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to CYP inhibition or induction. Furthermore, vestronidase alfa 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 76/87 
 
 
 
is not a cytokine or cytokine modulator, and therefore has a low potential to act as a perpetrator in 
DDIs by altering the expression of CYPs and/or certain transporters. 
Additional expert consultations 
See discussion on clinical efficacy. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set 
on the clinical safety of Mepsevii under normal conditions of use could not be considered 
comprehensive due to the small size of the clinical trials and the limited duration of follow-up for a 
life-long condition with highly variable clinical manifestations and disease progression rates.  
The CHMP acknowledged that the rarity of the disease and ethical considerations prevent the 
conduct of bigger and longer duration controlled trials.  
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances should be granted subject to the specific obligation, of implementing the 
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII Disease Monitoring Program to evaluate the long term safety 
profile of Mepsevii and in particular with regards to the important identified an potential risks 
associated with vestronidase alfa use.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity of MPS VII, the overall safety 
profile of vestronidase alfa is considered acceptable. The main safety concerns identified are of 
infusion associated reactions, immunogenicity and Spinal/Cervical Cord Compression which are 
addressed adequately through appropriate routine risk minimisation measures.  
The CHMP considers the specific obligation is necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances:

•  Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration  
•  Section 4.4 Special warning and precautions for use 
•  Section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) of the SmPC 
contains precautionary text reflecting the current knowledge 
concerning spinal/cervical cord compression. 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the SmPC contains text 
reflecting the results of anti-drug antibody development and no 
definitive correlation between anti-drug antibodies and urinary 
glycoaminoglycans (uGAGs).

Use during pregnancy and 
lactation 
Section 4.6 (Fertility, pregnancy and lactation) of the SmPC states 
that it is preferable to avoid the use of Mepsevii during pregnancy, 
unless clearly necessary. A decision on whether to 
continue/discontinue with Mepsevii should be made taking into 
account the potential benefit of Mepsevii to the mother and breast-
feeding to the infant.  
Safety concern 5 
Use in patients with

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are 
set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 15.11.2017. The new EURD list entry 
will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that vestronidase alfa has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers vestronidase alfa to be a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemption 
A request of translation exemption of the vial label in accordance with the third subparagraph of 
Article 63(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found 
acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group agreed to this request (vial label in English only) on the basis of the prevalence of 
the disease (i.e. less than 25 living patients have been identified in the EU to date), thus qualifying 
this disease as ultra-rare. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however 
be translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the 
printed materials will only be translated in the language as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Mepsevii (vestronidase alfa) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as:  
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It is approved under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8), DIR Art (22)] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification 
of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MPS VII, also known as Sly Syndrome, is an inherited metabolic disorder, caused by an enzyme 
deficiency in the processing of the GAGs dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS), and 
chondroitin 6 sulfate (CS).  
Patients  with  MPS  VII  may  experience  joint  stiffness,  short  stature,  an  enlarged  spleen  and  liver 
and heart / lung complications. MPS VII also causes a characteristic facial appearance and can lead 
to  a  progressive  skeletal  dysplasia.  Hearing  loss,  cataracts  and  clouding  of  the  corneas  are  also 
symptoms of patients with MPS VII. In more severe cases, there may be developmental delay. MPS 
VII has a high rate of neonatal non-immune hydrops fetalis, which is associated with high perinatal 
mortality rates. 
The disease is considered progressive with most of the disease manifestations occurring as a result 
of accumulation of GAGs. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  current  treatment  of  MPS  VII  is  symptomatic  and  supportive.  Bone  deformities  and  hernias 
may  require  orthopaedic  correction.  Ocular  and  cardiovascular  abnormalities  may  also  be  treated 
surgically.  Limited  data  on  patients  treated  with  hematopoietic  stem  cell  therapy  (HSCT)  are 
reported  in  literature,  which  have  suggested  that  HSCT  can  slow  down  or  even  prevent  further 
neurological  complications,  but  has  little  to  no  effect  on  the  skeletal  deformities  unless  it  is 
performed in an early stage. 
Therefore,  there  is  a  clear  unmet  medical  need  in  this  condition  for  which  there  is  currently  no 
authorised medicinal product. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
UX003-CL301  was  a  multicentre,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  blinded  start,  single-crossover 
phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of vestronidase alfa in MPS VII patients (diagnosed 
based on enzyme assay or genetic evaluation) aged 5 to 25 years. Patients whom had undergone a 
successful  bone  marrow  or  stem  cell  transplant  or  had  any  degree  of  detectable  chimaerism  with 
donor  cells  were  excluded.  Twelve  (12)  patients  were  included  in  the  study.  During  the  blinded 
period  of  the  study,  12  subjects  were  randomized  1:1:1:1  to  one  of  four  treatment  sequence 
groups  (Group  A,  B,  C  or  D;  3  subjects  per  group)  to  either  start  treatment  with  4  mg/kg 
vestronidase  alfa  (Group  A),  or  placebo  and  cross  over  to  4  mg/kg  vestronidase  alfa  at  different 
pre-defined  time  points  (Group  B  after  8  weeks,  Group  C  after  16  weeks  and  Group  D  after  24 
weeks).  Subjects  were  dosed  every  other  week  (QOW)  through  Week  46.  All  groups  received  a 
minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with 4 mg/kg vestronidase alfa QOW.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  percent  reduction  of  uGAG  excretion  after  24  weeks  compared  to  baseline  was  the  primary 
endpoint with various secondary, clinical endpoints (6MWT, FVC (%pred), visual acuity, BOT-2 and 
fatigue) and their combined analysis.  
After 24 weeks of treatment with vestronidase alfa, a significant reduction in uGAG (DS) excretion 
was achieved with a LS mean (±SE) percentage change of -64.82% (±2.468%) (p<0.0001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 82/87 
 
 
 
Treatment  response  as  assessed  by  multi-domain  responder  index  (MDRI)  at  Week  24  showed  a 
mean score (±SD) improvement of +0.5 domains (±0.8) (compared to placebo p=0.0016). Of the 
12  patients,  six  had  a  MDRI  score  of  +1  or  more.  Five  patients  had  a  score  of  0  (indicating  no 
change), indicative of no worsening of this progressive disease. One patient reported with -1 MDRI 
score. 
Seven  patients  had  at  least  two  post-baseline  6MWT  results,  six  of  whom  had  6MWT  results  at 
Treatment Week 24. Three of these six (50%) met the pre-defined MID (≥23 m and ≥10% change 
from baseline) at Treatment Week 24 and had significant and sustained walking improvements of 
65 meters, 80 meters and 83 meters. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Evaluation of the clinical relevance of the observed effects is difficult, as the data on natural history 
are very scarce and the evolution of the pathology is not well understood. However, it is generally 
accepted that this is a slowly progressive disease and therefore the duration of the study might not 
be long enough to allow full evaluation of the treatment effect.  
In the studies submitted by the Applicant no patient with neonatal non-immunologic hydrops fetalis 
is included.  
In  order  to  make  a  responder  analysis  possible  the  Applicant  defined  a  MID  for  each  secondary 
endpoint.  When  possible  the  MID  is  based  on  literature  including  other  MPS  diseases  otherwise 
results from non-MPS diseases are used. This approach results in a broad range of possible values 
for the various MICD. The chosen MICD all fall within the found range.  
The individualized clinical response (ICR) is chosen by the patient as the clinical endpoint with the 
highest impact on the QoL for this patient. As the choice might be unrealistic the use of the ICR is 
limited.  
The mean results observed for the various clinical endpoints do not reach clinical relevance as they 
do not reach the pre-defined MID or were practical not available (FVC%pred). On an individual basis 
no consistent improvement could be observed during the treatment period for either endpoint.  
The results are also difficult to interpret, as the numbers of patients analysed are limited, and most 
patients were not able to perform all the required tests 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most  adverse  event  reported  (≥20%  reported)  were  respiratory  infections,  cough,  vomiting, 
infusion site extravasation, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, rash and arthralgia. 
In study UX003-CL301 eight of 12 patients reported infusion-associated reactions (IARs) (66.7%), 
2  of  9  patients  in  the  placebo  groups  also  reported  IARs.  Nine  of  the  IARs  resolved  with  drug 
treatment disruption. Two patients experienced anaphylactoid reaction (one reported as grade 3). 
In  the  patient  with  grade  3  anaphylactoid  reaction  due  to  rapid  infusion  in  the  first  hour,  this 
reversed when the treatment was interrupted and emergency medication was provided. 
In the pivotal study 6 of 12 patients were positive for NAbs. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall size of the database is limited due to the rarity of the condition. The lack of a 
comparative historical data precludes an evaluation comparing the natural time course of the 
disease using SOC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/480950/2018 
Page 83/87 
 
 
 
The analysis of the patients with NAbs did not indicate an apparent clinical impact in the measured 
outcomes, however the potential effect of Nabs cannot be determined at this stage and will require 
further characterisation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A  clear  and  consistent  pharmacodynamic  effect  is  demonstrated  by  the  decrease  in  uGAG.  This 
strongly  suggests  a  decrease  in  accumulated  substance  which  may  lead  to  a  deceleration  of  the 
organ damage. These results are consistent with what has been observed with other ERTs.  
After  24  weeks  of  vestronidase  alfa  treatment  some  small  improvement  was  observed  for  the 
secondary  functional  and  clinical  endpoints  (MDRI)  in  some  patients.  Overall,  in  most  of  the 
patients at an individual level a small numerical improvement or stabilisation was observed in one 
or more of the secondary functional and clinical endpoints. The experts from the AHEG agreed that 
the  limited  duration  of  the  trial  limits  the  possibility  of  observing  the  true  magnitude  of  the 
treatment effect but acknowledged the importance of demonstrating a pharmacodynamic effect in 
the context of an enzyme replacement therapy. 
Limited  safety  data  only  23  patients  are  available.  The  observed  treatment  adverse  events  were 
mild, and in line with the experience from other ERT.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  vestronidase  alfa  in  MPS  VII  patients  has  been  clearly 
demonstrated.  The  exact  clinical  relevance  of  this  pharmacodynamic  action  remains  to  be 
Assessment report

established.  Some  beneficial  findings  (as  compared  to  placebo  were  observed  in  the  secondary, 
clinical  endpoints  were  observed.  Long-term  (72+  weeks)  comparison  with  baseline  showed 
stabilisation/improvement  for  a  portion  of  the  endpoints  and  patients.  Given  the  progressive 
character of the disease a stabilisation of the disease burden can be considered a beneficial clinical 
effect.  
Neonates with hydrops fetalis (considered to represent the most severe form of the condition), or 
patients  with  milder  forms  of  MPS  VII  with  diagnosis  established  in  early  adulthood  were  not 
included in the study. However, the treatment effect in these groups of patients can be expected to 
be  comparable  with  that  of  the  overall  population  included  in  the  studies.  This  assumption  was 
endorsed by the AHEG (see Additional expert consultation).  
As  expected  and  in  line  with  other  ERTs,  vestronidase  alfa  does  not  cross  the  blood-brain-barrier 
therefore  no  direct  effect  on  neurological  manifestations  can  be  expected.  Hence,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  the  indication  should  be  restricted  to  the  treatment  of  non-neurological 
manifestations of MPS VII.  
Limited  safety  data  is  available.  The  main  safety  concern  pertains  to  anaphylactoid  and  infusion 
associated reactions with clear recommendations for managing such adverse effects in the product 
information.  Although  the  overall  safety  profile  of  vestronidase  alfa  does  not  raise  any  particular 
concerns, the long-term effect of treatment on safety in MPS VII patients will be further evaluated 
in the MPS VII Disease Monitoring Program. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to 
provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the 
applied for indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to 
provide comprehensive evidence,  but also that in the present state of scientific knowledge, 
comprehensive information cannot be provided. Therefore, recommending a marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Mepsevii is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Mepsevii is favourable in the following indication: 
treatment of non-neurological manifestations of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII; Sly 
syndrome). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions:

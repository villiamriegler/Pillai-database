2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
2.1.1.  Problem statement
Disease or condition
Therapeutic indication
HyQvia is approved for the following indications, as listed in the HyQvia SmPC. Replacement therapy in 
adults, and children and adolescents (0-18 years) in:
•
Primary immunodeficiency syndromes with impaired antibody production (primary 
immunodeficiency disease, PID), 
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/432236/2020
Page 5/24
 
 
As well as in SID including,
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL), in whom prophylactic antibiotics have failed or are contra-indicated.
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent bacterial infections in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.
• Hypogammaglobulinaemia in patients pre- and post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT).
Claimed Indication
HyQvia can be used as replacement therapy in SID in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent 
infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF: failure to 
mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide and polypeptide antigen 
vaccines) or serum IgG level of <4 g/l).
Rationale
HyQvia’s safety and efficacy in PID have been established based on relevant clinical data (biological, 
pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data). A marketing authorization for these indications as well as for 
specific SIDs was granted throughout the EU in 2013. These SIDs, as listed in the guideline on core SmPC 
for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 rev. 3 
dated 2018) in effect, already encompassed a major part of the SID patient population. HyQvia produces 
a similar reduction in the number of serious bacterial infections to that seen with other immunoglobulin 
products thus, the key elements required for alignment of its SID indication are considered sufficient.
Medical Significance
SIDs are more frequent than primary immune deficiencies, and are not genetic in nature but are caused 
by external factors, such as certain haematological cancers as leukemia, CLL, MM, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), certain chronic illnesses such as diabetes, the absence of a spleen, 
malnutrition, or immunosuppressive medication or HSCT/chemotherapy (Chinen and Shearer, 20101).
Clinical Symptoms and Diagnostic Criteria
SIDs (Chinen and Shearer, 2010) are clinically manifested by an increased frequency or complications of 
common infections and sporadically by the occurrence of opportunistic infections. They have a wide 
spectrum of presentation, depending on the extent of offending external conditions and on host 
susceptibility. If a specific SID is suspected clinically, testing should focus on the underlying condition 
(e.g., diabetes, HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia).
Etiology, Incidence and Prevalence
SID is relatively common, and worldwide the most prevalent causes include malnutrition and advancing 
age. The etiologies of SID can be loosely grouped into those caused by the related abnormalities of 
general health, underlying disease, barrier integrity or iatrogenic influences, e.g. immunosuppressive 
treatment. Issues with general health that result in SID include malnutrition, advancing age, smoking and 
alcohol. Underlying diseases that cause SID include hematological malignancies such as chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, 
splenectomy/hyposplenism and some infections (e.g. HIV, Philip Bright P. and Richter A., 20172).

When evaluating a patient with increased frequency or severity of infections suggesting 
immunodeficiency, it should be considered that SIDs are far more common than PID. A detailed clinical 
history might uncover the condition affecting the immune system and exposure to harsh environmental 
conditions. The specific immune defects and clinical presentation in SIDs are usually affecting both the 
innate and the adaptive immunity. The immune impairment generally improves with the resolution of the 
primary condition (Chinen and Shearer, 20101).
2.1.2.  About the product
HyQvia (10% human normal immunoglobulin with recombinant human hyaluronidase [rHuPH20]) for 
subcutaneous (SC) administration, subsequently referred to as HyQvia, is currently licensed in the 
European Union (EU) for replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID) and a number 
of secondary immunodeficiencies (SIDs) including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, post-
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. HyQvia is a facilitated SC immunoglobin (facilitated IGSC) due to 
the rHuPH20 component. The immunoglobulin part of HyQvia (IGI 10% solution) is identical to the 
product KIOVIG, which is a licensed intravenous IGI 10% (IGIV) in Europe. Both products have the same 
manufacturing process. The main differences between KIOVIG and HyQvia are the route of administration 
(IV vs SC) and the administration of rHuPH20 before SC infusion of the IGI 10% component. rHuPH20 
increases the tissue dispersion and absorption of IGI 10% and facilitates increased flow rates and 
volumes of SC delivery compared with SC administration without rHuPH20. With rHuPH20 as a facilitator 
for absorption, IGI 10% in HyQvia is more than 90% bioavailable (at least 10-20% higher than other 
IGSC products), providing nearly equivalent systemic exposure to IGIV. The HyQvia clinical development 
program (
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/432236/2020
Page 7/24
 
 
Table 1) includes 4 completed studies investigating the safety, tolerability efficacy, and pharmacokinetics 
of IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 treatment in pediatric, adolescent and/or adult subjects with PID (Studies 
160602, 160603, 160902 and 161101). The Market Authorisation Holder (MAH) also conducted a study to 
investigate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and efficacy of IGI 10% given IV and SC without rHuPH20 
to obtain comparative data in subjects with PID (Study 160601). In addition, 2 studies were conducted to 
assess safety, tolerability, effectiveness, infusion pressure, and flow rates of IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 in 
healthy volunteers (Studies 161001 and 170901).

In the EU, HyQvia was approved for the indications of the Core SmPC through a centralized procedure 
(registration number EU/1/13/840/001-005). The European Commission granted a marketing 
authorization valid throughout the EU on 16th May 2013.
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice
Two revised EU guidelines for intravenous immunoglobulins came into effect in January 2019:
• Guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWF/94038/ 2007 Rev 5; Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), 2018).
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/432236/2020
Page 9/24
 
 
• Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Normal Immunoglobulin for Intravenous 
Administration, 28 June 2018 (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 3, CHMP, 2018)
The revised guidelines include a rewording of the SID indication for IGIV to extrapolate the indication to 
all SIDs if the efficacy in PID is established. These guidelines only apply to IGIV. However, it has been 
demonstrated that Igs are effective independent of the mode of administration and both IGIV and IGSC 
(including facilitated IGSC) can treat subjects with diseases such as SID.
In September 2019, the MAH sought scientific advice from the (CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/1170/4/2019/II) 
regarding the update of the Product information (PI) for HyQvia for its compliance and harmonization with 
the changes introduced in the two aforementioned guidelines, specifically, the change to the definition of 
SIDs. In November 2019, the CHMP provided a favorable opinion on the proposed rewording of the 
HyQvia indication. The main changes comprise a revision of the definition of SID and a clarification of 
dose adjustment based on patient’s body weight and addition of a recommended dose and dosing 
regimen for SIDs.
With this application, the MAH intends to align the wording for the already approved SID indications in 
the HyQvia SmPC with the wording of the Guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for 
intravenous administration. An analysis of the existing literature and summary of confirmatory data on 
the efficacy of HyQvia are provided to support the alignment of the SID indication. In addition, dose 
justifications and adjustments have been made according to the Guideline on core SmPC for human 
normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IGIV). Based on the CHMP advice provided for 
HyQvia, the MAH proposes an update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) affecting Section 
4.1 “Therapeutic Indications” and Section 4.2 “Posology and Method of Administration” as well as of 
Section 1 of the Patient Leaflet "What HyQvia is used for".
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
Under the current application for a Type II variation to reword and expand the definition of secondary 
immunodeficiencies in the Patient Information, the MAH is waiving an ERA report per the guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). Considering that HyQvia contains a naturally occurring protein as the 
active pharmaceutical ingredient, HyQvia is not expected to pose a risk to the environment and the 
absence of ERA studies is considered justified.
2.2.2.  Conclusion of the non-clinical aspects
No new non-clinical data have been submitted and the pre-clinical section 5.3 of the SmPC remains 
unchanged. This is considered acceptable by CHMP.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/432236/2020
Page 10/24
 
 
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Pharmacodynamics
The following changes or additions are made to dosing recommendations in the proposed revised SmPC 
based on new recommendations provided in Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 (CHMP, 2018) and 
in alignment with the KIOVIG SmPC:
• Addition: Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients.
• Addition: Specific dosing regimen for secondary immunodeficiencies: the recommended dose is 0.2-0.4 
g/kg every three to four weeks.
• Addition: IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of 
infection. Dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an 
increase may be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when 
the patient remains infection free.
Primary and secondary pharmacology
A total of 4 studies were previously completed with HyQvia in subjects with PID (studies 160602 and 
160603,160902 and 161101) (Wasserman et al., 2016a3, Wasserman et al., 2016b4, Wasserman et al., 
20125). As a guideline, the proposed recommended starting dose of rHuPH20-facilitated SC administered 
IGI 10% is 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight (BW) per month preceded by a minimum of 75 U of rHuPH20 
per gram IgG, infused at 3- or 4-week intervals. For patients previously on IV IgG replacement therapy, 
administration should start at the same dose and frequency; for patients previously on regular SC 
replacement therapy, the initial monthly IgG dose should be the same as for SC treatment, but adjusted 
to 3- or 4-week intervals. HyQvia was shown to have nearly equivalent total systemic exposure as 
represented by the area under the curve (AUC) as well as trough levels of serum IgG as compared to 
IGIV based on results from clinical studies 160602 and 160603, wherein IGI 10% was administered either 
SC at 108% of IV dose with rHuPH20 (HyQvia) or IV without rHuPH20 (KIOVIG) in subjects with PID. In 
the phase 3 Study 160603, the geometric mean ratio (SC/IV) of AUC over a dosing interval (AUC0-τ) for 
IgG was found to be 93.3%, with a 90% confidence interval (CI) of 91.4% to 95.2%. The median peak 
concentration (Cmax) of serum IgG was lower after HyQvia than after IV infusion (15.5 g/L vs 21.9 g/L) 
while the median time to reach Cmax was longer (Tmax: 5.0 vs 0.1 days).
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
No new pharmacological data was submitted. 
The proposed dosing is aligned with the KIOVIG posology for the treatment of secondary 
immunodeficiencies and with the Guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007(CHMP, 2018). Based on the 
proven bioequivalence for HyQvia to Kiovig regarding the exposure (AUC0-t in pivotal trial 160603), this

is considered acceptable by CHMP and in accordance with the output from the Scientific Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/1170/4/2019/II). 
The following dosing recommendations are added in SmPC Section 4.2:
-
-
Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients.
For secondary immunodeficiencies, the recommended dose is 0.2-0.4 g/kg every three to four 
weeks. IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of 
infection. Dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, 
an increase may be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be 
considered when the patient remains infection free.
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
HyQvia exhibited nearly complete bioavailability and similar steady-state trough levels of serum IgG to 
KIOVIG. Thus, HyQvia is considered by CHMP a comparable treatment option to KIOVIG.
The revised dosing recommendations are appropriate and agreed by CHMP.
2.4.  Clinical efficacy
2.4.1.  Main study
Clinical Studies of IGI 10% with and without rHuPH20 in Subjects with PID Serious Acute 
Bacterial Infections
The rate of validated acute serious bacterial infections per subject-year during IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 
treatment was the primary efficacy endpoint in Studies 160603 and extension Study 160902 
(Wasserman et al., 2016b, Wasserman et al., 2012). They were among the key variables in Study 
161101. The rate of validated serious acute bacterial infections per subject-year was 0.025 (upper limit 
of 99% CI: 0.046) during IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 treatment in Study 160603, 0.020 (upper limit of 
99% CI: 0.045) during IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 treatment in Study 160902, and 0 (upper limit of 99% 
CI: 0.471) in Study 161101. Thus, in all studies, the rates were well below 1.0 validated acute serious 
bacterial infections/subject/year, the threshold specified as providing substantial evidence of efficacy by 
the relevant regulatory guidelines (CHMPe, 2018, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2008). These 
rates are comparable to the rate observed for SC administered IGI 10% alone in Study 160601 (rate: 
0.067 upper limit of 99% CI: 0.134) (Wasserman et al., 20116) and IV administered IGI 10% (upper limit 
of 95% CI: 0 to 0.060) (Church et al., 20067). These results demonstrate that IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 
treatment provides comparable protection from serious acute bacterial infections to SC administered IGI 
10% alone or to IV-administered IGI 10%.

All Infections
The rates of all infections per subject-year were determined in Studies 160601, 160602 and 160603 
and results were integrated across the studies. In Study 160601, subjects received IGI 10% IV in Study 
part 1 and IGI 10% SC in Study Part 2 and Part 3 and in the Study Extension. Comparative data were 
obtained on the pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy of IGI 10% given IV and SC without rHuPH20. 
A subset of 31 subjects who participated in Study 160601 also participated in Study 160603.
Study 160603, consisted of 2 study epochs: in Study Epoch 1 subjects received IV treatment with IGI 
10%, and in Study Epoch 2 IGI 10% was infused SC after administration of rHuPH20 at 3- or 4-week 
treatment intervals. In Study 160602, subjects received IGSC 10% with rHuPH20. This study was not 
designed to determine the efficacy of IGI 10% treatment. Infections were reported as adverse
events (AEs) and the number and types of infections were determined.
It should be noted that in Studies 160601 and 160603, the period of IV exposure to IGI 10% was 
substantially shorter than for IGI 10% administered SC with or without rHuPH20. The point estimates 
were 3.02 infections/subject/year (95% CI: 2.56 to 3.54) for HyQvia, 4.00 (95% CI: 3.13 to 5.02) for IGI 
10% administered SC alone and 4.42 (95% CI: 3.52 to 5.47), for IGI 10% administered IV (HyQvia).
Under IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 treatment in Study 160902, the rate of infections per subject-year was 
2.86 (95% CI: 2.36 to 3.43). In an integrated analysis the overall annual rate of infections while on IGSC 
10% and rHuPH20 treatment in Study 160603 and in the extension Study 160902 was 2.99 (95% 
CI: 2.60 to 3.42) (Wasserman et al., 2016b). In Study 161101, the rate of all infections per year while 
on IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 was 2.45 (95% CI: 1.55-3.66).
The pooled results confirm that the rate of infections during IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 treatment was as 
low as during IGI 10% treatment administered IV or SC without rHuPH20.
Efficacy of IGSC Products in Subjects with SID from published data
Published data on the response to Ig replacement with IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 in subjects with SID 
indicate that IGSC 10% with rHuPH20 is effective in decreasing the incidence of infections in subjects 
with SID. In a single-center retrospective analysis of 33 subjects with SID who receive IGSC 10% and 
rHuPH20 as replacement therapy, 7 episodes of infection were reported in 6 subjects during HyQvia 
treatment. IgG trough levels were below 600 mg/dl at the time of infection in all 6 subjects. After Ig dose
adjustment to increase IgG trough levels, no new infection occurred (Dimou et al., 20188). Furthermore, 
efficacy of IGSC replacement therapy in subjects with SID was also reported with a IGSC 20% product in 
a randomized but not blinded study. A statistically lower number of infections were reported in the 24 
subjects treated with IGSC 20% in comparison with the 22 subjects in the control group who did not 
receive Ig replacement therapy (Vacca et al., 20189).
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
According to results of Studies 160603, 160902 and 161101 efficacy of SCIg/fSCIg compared with 
IVIg was proven in adult and paediatric PID patients. The rates of validated acute serious bacterial 
infections per subject-year were significantly below the threshold specified as providing substantial 
evidence of efficacy. Regarding the rates of all infections, HyQvia provided a significant clinical benefit

across all conducted studies, too. As to PID, a comparable protection from serious bacterial infections and 
general infections is acknowledged by CHMP. As already pointed out in the EMA Scientific Advice, the 
provided literature has shortcomings as to the analysed numbers of patients suffering from SID. 
However, as the indication hypogammaglobulinaemia caused by oncological diseases or HSCT was 
already included in the SmPC and thereby encompasses a major part of the SID patient population, the 
proposed rewording of the HyQvia indication is acceptable to the CHMP.
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The revised guideline on core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/2007 Rev. 5) includes a rewording of the SID indication for IVIg. Even if this 
guideline applies to IVIg, it has been demonstrated that Igs are effective independent of the mode of 
administration, and both IVIg and SCIg/fSCIg are effective in treating subjects with SID. The 
extrapolation of the indication to all SIDs is endorsed by CHMP since the efficacy in PID is established. 
Moreover, the beneficial effects of SCIg/fSCIg are substantiated by the provided literature. 
The proposed rewording of the HyQvia indication is thus agreed by CHMP:
HyQvia can be used as replacement therapy in SID in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent 
infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF: failure to 
mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide and polypeptide antigen 
vaccines) or serum IgG level of <4 g/l.
2.5.  Clinical safety
Safety of IGSC products in Subjects with PID
Related Serious Adverse Events
No related serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 5 studies evaluating different modes of 
administration of IGI 10% (IV, SC with/without rHuPH20) in paediatric, adolescent and adult subjects 
with PID. Two related SAEs were reported, in Study 170901 Part 4: in one healthy volunteer after 
receiving IGSC 10% with formulation buffer control and in another healthy volunteer who had been 
administered IGSC 10% with rHuPh20. These events were instances of hemolytic anemia that were 
assessed by the investigator as possibly being related to the investigational products, with an alternative 
etiology of viral infection. Asymptomatic hemolysis and significantly decreased hemoglobin were assessed 
by a number of parameters in Studies 160603, 160902, and 161101 including direct Coomb’s test, 
haptoglobin, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), urinary hemosiderin, and reticulocyte count, and no confirmed 
or suspected cases were reported. No other significant safety concerns were raised regarding IGSC 10% 
and rHuPH20 administered to subjects with PID or healthy volunteers.
Related Non-Serious Adverse Events
The nature of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was similar for IGSC 10% treatment with and without 
rHuPH20 in Studies 160601 and 160603; the most commonly reported reactions included infusion site 
pain, headache, and infusion site erythema.
• In subjects who received IGSC 10% and rHuPH20, ADRs that occurred at rates of >0.05 per infusion in 
any study were: infusion site pain, infusion site erythema, infusion site swelling, injection site pruritus, 
headache, infusion site pruritus, nausea, infusion site discoloration, infusion site induration, injection site 
pain, injection site discoloration, and skin discoloration.
Extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/432236/2020
Page 14/24
 
 
• In subjects who received IGIV 10%, ADRs that occurred at rates of >0.05 per infusion were: headache, 
urticaria, vomiting, chills, pain, peripheral edema, and back pain.
• ADRs to IGSC 10% alone were palpitations, infusion site pain, infusion site pruritus, infusion site 
swelling, infusion site induration, infusion site discoloration, injection site discoloration, injection site pain, 
and leucopenia, occurring at rates of >0.05 per infusion (CSR 160601 Table 14.3.2-15). In Study 
160902, the only related AE that occurred at a rate per infusion >0.05 during long-term treatment with 
IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 was infusion site pain. 
In Study 161101, the most common AEs related to IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 were infusion site pain, 
infusion site erythema, infusion site swelling, infusion site pruritus, local swelling, pyrexia and headache. 
Thus, in line with published data, SC infusions of IGI 10% with or without rHuPH20 were more frequently 
associated with local ADRs than IV infusions of IGI 10%, but were
associated with a lower rate of systemic ADRs (Church et al., 20067, Gardulf, 200710, Gardulf et al., 
199511, Gustafson et al., 200812).
Safety of IGSC Products in Subjects with SID from published data
Clinical post-marketing experience with IGSC 10% and rHuPH20 has recently been reported from a 
retrospective single-center analysis in 33 subjects with SIDs due to hematological malignancies who were 
treated with HyQvia (Dimou et al., 20188). The incidence of AEs deemed as related to HyQvia by the 
investigator was low (9%) in this study and all ADRs were assessed as mild (grade 1).
Adverse reactions were also local in nature and mild in most subjects in the IGI SC 20% group in a 
prospective, controlled, randomized but not blinded study in subjects with multiple myeloma and 
secondary hypogammaglobulinemia randomly assigned to treatment with a IGSC 20% product (Arm A, n 
= 24) or to the control group (no Ig treatment, Arm B, n = 22). For 3/24 subjects randomized to IGSC 
20% treatment, grade 3/4 ADRs were reported (2 instances of pain and inflammatory reaction at the site 
of injection and one extensive allergic skin reaction), that required treatment discontinuation
(Vacca et al., 20189). 
Safety of rHuPH20
Fifteen (15) of the 83 subjects exposed to HyQvia in studies 160603 and 160902 developed at least a 
single positive titer (≥1:160) of antibodies capable of binding to rHuPH20. In all subjects, titers declined 
to baseline, or titers seen in PH20 naïve subjects/normal population despite continued exposure to 
HyQvia Based upon data available to date, the incidence of treatment emergent rHuPH20-reactive
binding antibodies was low and neutralizing antibodies have not been observed in any subjects. There has 
been no evidence of a lack of treatment effect when rHuPH20-reactive binding antibodies have been 
detected. In all subjects, antibody titers decreased despite continued treatment. In addition, no clinical 
signs or symptoms have been associated with positive rHuPH20-reactive binding antibody titers. No 
investigations (clinical or nonclinical) have implicated rHuPH20-reactive binding antibodies as causal
factors for any adverse clinical event.

Thus, based on clinical evidences the safety profile of subjects who developed antibodies to rHuPH20 is 
comparable to the safety profile of subjects with negative titer with regard to the nature and rate of AEs 
observed during the entire exposure to HyQvia.
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
The nature of ADRs was similar for IGSC 10% treatment with and without rHuPH20 in patiens with PID in 
Studies 160601 and 160603; the most commonly reported reactions included infusion site pain, 
headache, and infusion site erythema. In line with published data, SC infusions of IGI 10% with or 
without rHuPH20 in patients with PID were more frequently associated with local ADRs than IV infusions 
of IGI 10%, but were associated with a lower rate of systemic ADRs (Church et al., 20067, Gardulf, 
200710, Gardulf et al., 199511, Gustafson et al., 200812). In addition, published data support the safety of 
IGSC as replacement therapy in subjects with SID.
No new safety concerns arose during the post-marketing period. Therefore, both IVIg and SCIg/fSCIg are 
safe in treating subjects with SID. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
The use of HyQvia in patients with SID is agreed by CHMP from a safety perspective.
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

2.7.  Update of the Product information
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly.
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 10.1, which 
were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.
The conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product are also 
updated to include the ongoing non-interventional post-authorisation safety study on the long-term safety 
of HyQvia in subjects treated with HyQvia. This study was missing from Annex II whereas it is a Category 
1 study in the RMP.

2.7.1.  User consultation
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
HyQvia’s safety and efficacy in PID have been established based on relevant clinical data (biological, 
pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data). HyQvia is already authorised for these indications as well as 
for specific SIDs. HyQvia produces a similar reduction in the number of serious bacterial infections to that 
seen with other immunoglobulin products.
Therefore, taking into consideration that HyQvia was shown to be safe and efficacious in paediatric and 
adult patients with PID, the final clinical manifestations for PID and SID result in severe infections due to 
hypogammaglobulinaemia requiring replacement therapy and that the IGSC core SmPC wording already 
emcompassed a major part of the SID patient population (CLL, MM and HSCT with 
hypogammablobulinaemia), a favourable risk-benefit profile of HyQvia has been demonstrated to extend 
the indication of SID as defined in the latest core SmPC for IGIV (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/ 2007 Rev 5; 
CHMP, 2018).
Therefore, the therapeutic indication in SmPC Section 4.1 and dosing recommendation SmPC Section 4.2 
are updated in accordance with the applicable core SmPC for IGIV (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/ 2007 Rev 5; 
CHMP, 2018). This is considered adequate by CHMP to provide the prescriber with sufficient information 
to enable optimal safety with regards to HyQvia’s administration. 
3.1.  Conclusions
The overall B/R of HyQvia is positive.
4.  Recommendations
Outcome

Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. As a consequence, 
Sections 1, 2, 3, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 5.2 and 6.5 of the SmPC, labelling and package leaflet are updated.
The conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product are also 
updated to include the ongoing non-interventional post-authorisation safety study on the long-term safety 
of HyQvia in subjects treated with HyQvia, which is a Category 1 study in the agreed RMP.
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
Amendments to the marketing authorisation
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended.

means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the ‘data subject’). 
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by 
reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online 
identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural or social identity of that natural person.
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that the 
personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional 
information (e.g. key-coded data). 
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass for 
instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.”

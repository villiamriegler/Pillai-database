Based upon the data that have become available since the

granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Qutenza remains 
positive, however the Committee requested an additional 
five year renewal on the basis of the following 
pharmacovigilance grounds: several safety concerns which 
could impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product 
require further evaluation or close monitoring including 
bradycardia, chest pain, application site reactions, second 
degree burns, off label use, accidental exposure; further 
important safety data are expected from on-going post-
authorisation studies.

with post-marketing experience, indicated that in some 
patients, lidocaine pre-treatment can be either avoided or 
substituted with oral tramadol with no impact on the patch 
tolerance and therefore the treatment efficacy. Section 4.2 
of the SmPC was updated to allow the treating physician to 
adapt the care of the patient accordingly. In addition the

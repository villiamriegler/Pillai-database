2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2011 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
polycythaemia vera (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made; 
the condition is life-threatening and seriously debilitating due to thromboembolic and haemorrhagic 
events, progression to myelofibrosis and leukaemogenic transformation; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that pegylated proline-interferon alpha-2b may be 
of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. This appears justified with regards to a 
clinically relevant advantage based on the potential to reduce pathological JAK2 positive clones 
which was supported by preliminary clinical data. Moreover, the product has potential to improve 
safety aspects compared to the current treatments, based on the expected lack of neoplastic 
potential vis a vis the existing authorised treatments.   
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Polycythemia vera (PV) is currently classified by the WHO classification system under 
myeloproliferative neoplasms. Diagnosis requires the presence of a JAK2 mutation, in addition to 
documentation of increased hemoglobin/hematocrit (>16.5 g/dl 49% for males and >16 g/dl 48% for 
females) (Arber et al. Blood. 2016 May 19;127(20):2391-405). Bone marrow morphologic assessment 
is encouraged. Clinical features in PV include mild-to-moderate degree of splenomegaly, mild-to-
moderate degree of constitutional symptoms, including fatigue and pruritus, symptoms of 
hyperviscosity, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, microvascular symptoms (e.g., headaches, 
lightheadedness, visual disturbances, atypical chest pain, erythromelalgia, paresthesia), thrombotic 
and bleeding complications, and risk of leukemic transformation or fibrotic progression (Tefferi et al, 
Blood Cancer J. 2018 Jan; 8(1): 3.). 
The proposed therapeutic indication in the MAA is “Treatment of polycythaemia vera in adults without 
symptomatic splenomegaly”. The proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the designated 
orphan condition which is broadly worded as “treatment of polycythemia vera”.     
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the positive CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition is justified.

EMA/47444/2019 
Page 4/7 
 
 
 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The applicant has not identified any change in the seriousness of the proposed condition.  
Polycythemia vera is still considered a severely debilitating and life-threatening condition due to 
thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events, progression to myelofibrosis and leukaemic transformation 
as well as a significantly reduced relative survival compared to the general population. 
It can be acknowledged that the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to 
splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus, symptoms of hyperviscosity, 
leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, microvascular symptoms (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, visual 
disturbances, atypical chest pain, erythromelalgia, paresthesia), thrombotic and bleeding 
complications, and risk of leukemic transformation or fibrotic progression (Tefferi et al, Blood Cancer J. 
2018 Jan; 8(1): 3.). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has not identified a change in the prevalence of the proposed condition and proposes, 
after a review of relevant literature, a 3 per 10,000 estimate. 
This is based on literature (e.g. Brochnann et al, Clin Epidemiol 9: 141–150 and the orphanet report of 
June 2017) and cancer registries from the Nordic countries. The sponsor argues that the incidence of 
the disease has remained stable over long period of times in Sweden, (between 1970 and 2015). 
The conclusion can be considered acceptable. Indeed, NORDCAN (accessed 30/10/2018) gives a 
combined full-point prevalence figure for all myeloproliferative disorders – thereby also including ET 
and PMF - of approximately 4.5/10,000 in 2015 (4.1 for males, 4.8 for females). This is in line with the 
conclusion of the applicant which was considered acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At the time of granting of the orphan designation in 2011, hydroxyurea and busulfan (and pipobroman) 
had been approved as first line treatment of PV. Since then, Jakavi (ruxolitinib) was authorised as 
second line treatment of PV in 2015. 
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has published guidelines on Philadelphia 
Chromosome-Negative Chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (Vannucchi et al.  Ann Oncol (2015) 26 
(suppl 5): v85-v99). As per these guidelines, the therapeutic algorithm for high risk patients (>60 
years and/or with a history of a vascular event) includes IFN-α (off label) or hydroxyurea as 
cytoreductive treatment as well as anticoagulation therapy. For second line, IFN-α, HU, ruxolitinib, or 
participation in trials are discussed. 
Moreover, with reference to the revised management recommendations from European Leukemia Net 
(Barbui et al, 2018 Leukaemia 32, 1057-1069), cytoreduction is strongly recommended in high-risk 
cases, i.e., older than 60 years, or those with a previous thrombotic event. Treatment with either 
hydroxyurea or rIFNα is the first-line cytoreductive therapy at any age,  the former with a cautious 
approach  in young patients.

Significant benefit 
The applicant argues a clinically relevant advantage versus hydroxyurea based on improved efficacy 
and improved safety claims.  
Improved efficacy is argued on the basis of the extension study at 24 months. The following points are 
reiterated: 
•  Complete haematological response: 70.5% vs 49.3% (RR 1.42 [1.09 to 1.87]; p=0.0101) 
•  Complete haematological response & improvement in disease burden: 49.5% vs 36.6% (RR 1.34 
[0.93 to 1.92]; p=0.1183) 
•  Maintenance of haematological response: 43.2% vs 18.4% (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.93; 
p=0.0015)  
• 
Trend analysis for the haematological response: ropegIFN alfa-2b showed an improvement in the 
slopes (positive slope using log-binomial regression: Mean, 0.013; 95% CI, 0.000 to 0.025) and 
response rate ratio estimates (calculation of response ratios (RR): Mean, 1.039; 95% CI, 1.000 to 
1.078, p=0.0015) while control treated patients showed a statistical significant decrease in 
haematological response rate (negative slope and a RR of 1.017 (0.991 to 1.044), p=0.2079) 
•  Molecular Response: 69.2% vs 28.6% (RR 2.13 [1.26 to 3.59]; p=0.0046) 
•  Decrease in mean JAK2V617F allelic burden: 18.2% vs 34.3% (p<0.01) 
• 
JAK2V617 change from baseline:  -24.4% vs -10.4% (p<0.01) 
The sponsor also includes an argument of improved safety, but this is not quantified nor examined in 
the context of the broader safety profile. It is argued that the overall safety profile was consistent with 
class effects of other interferons used (interferon alfa-2a and 2b), and that during AOP’s clinical 
development, no leukaemogenic transformations have been observed in ropegIFN alfa-2b treated 
patients, whereas two acute leukaemia were observed in the control arm (i.e. HU-treated patients). 
The Committee considered that an improved safety argument would require further elaboration.

Moreover,  the other arguments discussed above have to be interpreted with caution taking into 
consideration that to establish non-inferiority, post-hoc modifications were introduced in the primary 
endpoint and non-inferiority margin.  It was also pointed out that a non-inferiority conclusion by itself 
would not suffice to justify significant benefit. 
A list of issues was raised to the applicant. 
4.  COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit 
Significant benefit is argued on the basis of improved efficacy and safety versus hydroxyurea. The 
sponsor is requested to further elaborate on the issue taking into consideration the following points: 
• 
• 
• 
Provide a discussion versus all authorised counterparts, indicated for the updated indication as 
discussed with the CHMP; 
Further elaborate on the issue of improved efficacy versus hydroxyurea, taking into consideration 
that to establish non-inferiority, post-hoc modifications were introduced in the primary endpoint 
and non-inferiority margin; 
Further elaborate on the argument of improved safety, in the context of the broader safety profile 
of the proposed product and the comparator(s);

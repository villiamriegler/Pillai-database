are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

“A pre-planned final OS analysis was performed after at 
least 78 deaths occurred. The minimum follow-up was 45.0 
months. The OS results at final analysis reached statistical 
significance. A significantly longer OS was observed in 
patients in the E-Pd arm compared to patients in the Pd 
arm (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.93; p value 0.0217).”

CA204004 and the final OS analysis was pre-planned to 
occur after at least 427 deaths. The final OS analysis was 
performed after 212 deaths in the 
Elotuzumab/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (E Ld) arm and 
225 deaths in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone (Ld) arm. 
The minimum follow up was 70.6 months (clinical cut-off 
date of 03-Oct-2018). A statistically significant advantage 
in OS was observed in patients in the E Ld arm compared 
to patients in the Ld arm. The median OS in the E Ld arm 
was 48.30 months compared with 39.62 months in the Ld 
arm. Patients in the E Ld arm had an 18% reduction in the 
risk of death compared with those in the Ld arm (HR = 
0.82; 95.4% CI: 0.68, 1.00; p value = 0.0408).

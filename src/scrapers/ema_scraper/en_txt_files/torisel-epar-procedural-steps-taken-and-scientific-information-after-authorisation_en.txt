are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the CHMP in responses to PSUR 6. The MAH has also

updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
temsirolimus and medicinal products that are P-
glycoprotein substrates are currently reflected in the 
product information of Torisel. The effect of P-gp inhibition 
by temsirolimus has not been investigated in a clinical

data from a phase 1 study of combined lenalidomide (dose 
of 25 mg) and temsirolimus (dose of 20 mg) seemed to

support the in vitro findings and suggested an increased 
risk of adverse events. Hence, the product information of 
Torisel has been updated to reflect this information. When 
temsirolimus is co administered with medications which are 
P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, vincristine, colchicine, 
dabigatran, lenalidomide, and paclitaxel) close monitoring 
for adverse events related to the co-administered drugs 
should be observed.  
The CHMP considered the changes to the product 
information do not affect the current benefit-risk balance of 
Torisel which continues to be positive.

opinion of the CHMP further to the concerns raised 
during a Good Clinical Practice inspection on the 
conduct of bio-analytical studies by the Cetero 
Research facilities (Houston, USA), to assess the 
impact thereof on the risk-benefit balance of Torisel

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the data that have become available since the

granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
and PL 
considers that the risk-benefit balance of Torisel for the 
first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) who have at least three of six 
prognostic risk factors and for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell 
Page 12/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lymphoma (MCL) remains positive but considers that its 
safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following 
reasons: 
• 
The MAH should provide the results of an ongoing 
post-marketing study in Mantle Cell Lymphoma to address 
whether similar efficacy can be achieved with a less toxic 
dose regimen.  
• 
The MAH should continue to closely monitor and 
address several safety concerns in the next PSURs, 
including incidence and frequency of interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) evaluating in particular ILD in Japanese and 
East Asiatic populations, fatal respiratory events, cardiac 
events, cases observed in children, off-label use, safety in 
children and cases of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Torisel, the 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

patients with mantle cell lymphoma with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. 
In an open-label, dose-escalation phase I study in 110 
subjects with advanced malignancies and either normal or 
impaired hepatic function, concentrations of temsirolimus 
and its metabolite sirolimus were increased in patients with 
elevated AST or bilirubin levels. Assessment of AST and 
bilirubin levels is recommended before initiation of 
temsirolimus and periodically after. 
An increased rate of fatal events was observed in patients 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The fatal 
events included those due to progression of disease; 
however a causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
Based on the phase I study, no dose adjustment of 
temsirolimus is recommended for renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) patients with baseline platelet counts   100x109/l 
and mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin up 
to 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN] with any 
abnormality of AST, or as defined by Child-Pugh Class A or

(total bilirubin > 3 times ULN with any abnormality of AST, 
or as defined by Child-Pugh Class C), the recommended 
dose for patients who have baseline platelets   100 x 109/l

In a phase 1/2 safety and exploratory efficacy study, 71 
patients (59 patients, aged from 1 to 17 years, and 12 
patients, aged from 18 to 21 years) received temsirolimus 
as a 60-minute IV infusion once weekly in three-week

advanced recurrent/refractory solid tumours received 
temsirolimus at doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 to 150 
mg/m2. In part 2, 45 patients aged from 1 to 17 years with 
recurrent/relapsed rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, or 
high grade glioma were administered temsirolimus at a 
weekly dose of 75 mg/m2. Adverse events were generally 
similar to those observed in adults. 
Temsirolimus was found to be ineffective in paediatric 
patients with neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and 
high-grade glioma (n = 52). For subjects with 
neuroblastoma, the objective response rate was 5.3% 
(95% CI: 0.1%, 26.0%). After 12 weeks of treatment, no 
response was observed in subjects with rhabdomyosarcoma 
or high-grade glioma. None of the 3 cohorts met the 
criterion for advancing to the second stage of the Simon 2 
stage design. 
The adverse reactions reported by the highest percentage 
of patients were haematologic (anaemia, leukopaenia, 
neutropaenia, and thrombocytopaenia), metabolic 
(hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipaemia, hyperglycaemia, 
increase of serum aspartate amino transferase [AST] and 
serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] plasma levels), and 
digestive (mucositis, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting).

rhabdomyolysis. As a consequence, the term 
"rhabdomyolysis" has been added as an adverse reaction 
under post-marketing experience to SmPC section 4.8.

images and an Advisory Board review of cases of ILD from 
study 3066K1-2217-AP (a phase 2 open-label study of 
temsirolimus in patients with advanced RCC) were also 
conducted. There have been cases of non-specific 
interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal reports, occurring in 
patients who received weekly intravenous TORISEL. Some 
patients were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms with 
pneumonitis detected on computed tomography scan or 
chest radiograph. It is recommended that patients undergo 
baseline radiographic assessment by lung computed 
tomography scan or chest radiograph prior to the initiation 
of TORISEL therapy. Periodical follow-up assessments may 
be considered. It is recommended that patients be followed 
closely for occurrence of clinical respiratory symptoms. and 
patients should be advised to report promptly any new or 
worsening respiratory symptoms. If clinically significant 
respiratory symptoms develop, consider withholding 
TORISEL administration until after recovery of symptoms 
and improvement of radiographic findings related to 
pneumonitis. Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and/or 
antibiotics may be considered.

Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (including some life-
threatening and rare fatal reactions), including and not 
limited to flushing, chest pain, dyspnoea, hypotension, 
apnoea, loss of consciousness, hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis, have been associated with the administration 
of temsirolimus. These reactions can occur very early in the 
first infusion, but may also occur with subsequent 
infusions. Patients should be monitored early during the 
infusion and appropriate supportive care should be 
available. Temsirolimus infusion should be interrupted in all 
patients with severe infusion reactions and appropriate 
medical therapy administered. A benefit-risk assessment 
should be done prior to the continuation of temsirolimus 
therapy in patients with severe or life-threatening 
reactions. 
If a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the 
Torisel infusion, despite the premedication, the infusion 
must be stopped and the patient observed for at least 30 to

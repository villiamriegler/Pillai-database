Product Characteristics. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add 
drug-drug interaction information with midazolam, 
dabigatran, rosuvastatin and warfarin, based on 
studies ID-078-125 and ID-078-126. Study ID-078-
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

125 is a single-centre, open-label, three-period, 
fixed-sequence design study to investigate the effect 
of daridorexant on the pharmacokinetics of 
dabigatran and rosuvastatin in healthy male 
subjects, while study ID-078-126 is a single-centre, 
open-label study to investigate the effect of single- 
and multiple-dose daridorexant on the 
pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its metabolite 1-
hydroxymidazolam, and the effect of single-dose 
daridorexant on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy male 
subjects. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce a minor editorial change to the PI.

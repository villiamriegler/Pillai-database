2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  is  a  chronic,  immune-mediated  disease  of  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
characterised by inflammation,  demyelination, and  axonal/neuronal destruction,  ultimately  leading  to  severe 
disability. MS is the most common autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the CNS, affecting approximately 2.3 
million individuals worldwide. MS typically affects young adults (mean age at onset 30 years), and women are 
affected more often than men. 
Reflecting  the  current  understanding  of  MS,  the  disease course  of  MS  can  be  grouped  into  2 corresponding 
main MS categories:  
• 
• 
relapsing  MS:  clinically  isolated  syndrome  (CIS),  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS),  active 
secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). 
progressive MS: secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(PPMS). 
At  the  time  of  their  first  MS  diagnosis,  80%  to  85%  of  adult  patients  present  with  RRMS,  characterised by 
recurrent acute exacerbations (relapses) of neurological dysfunction  followed by  a variable state  of complete 
or  incomplete  recovery. Most  patients  with  RRMS  may  progress  to  SPMS,  which  is  a  stage  of  the  disease 
characterized  by  continuous  worsening  of  disability  with  or  without  superimposed  relapses.  Up  to  15%  of 
patients clinically present with a disease course referred to as PPMS, which is characterised by accumulation of 
disability since the beginning of the disease.  
The indication for Kesimpta (ofatumumab) is: 
Kesimpta is indicated for the treatment  of adult patients  with  relapsing forms of multiple  sclerosis (RMS) with 
active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1). 
The recommended dosing regimen is administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection with initial  dosing at weeks 
0, 1 and 2, followed by subsequent monthly dosing, starting at week 4. 
Despite the availability of several disease modifying therapies (DMT) for the treatment  of RMS, there remains 
the  medical  need for  efficacious and  safe therapies that  are convenient  to  administer  and  easy to  do  safety 
monitoring in clinical use, to reduce the  burden of long-term accrual of disability.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MS  is the  most  common autoimmune  demyelinating disorder of the  CNS,  affecting approximately 2.3  million 
individuals worldwide.  
Globally, the estimated median annual incidence MS in 2013 was 4.0 per 100000 (ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 per 
100,000  [interquartile  range])  according  to  estimates  from  the  Multiple  Sclerosis  International  Federation 
(MSIF, 2013).  On a regional level, Europe had the highest estimated median annual incidence in 2013 (5.5 per 
100,000),  followed by Asia (3.0  per 100,000),  Africa (1.0  per 100,000),  and the Americas (0.6  per 100,000). 
Countries reporting the highest estimated median annual incidence of MS included Canada (13.4 per 100,000), 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 8/138 
 
 
 
Latvia (11.6  per 100,000), and Czech Republic (11.0 per 100,000). Its prevalence rate varies between regions, 
ranging from more than 100 per 100,000 in Northern and Central Europe to 50 per 100,000 in Southern Europe. 
MS typically affects young adults (mean age at onset 30 years), and women are affected more often than men 
(median estimated female/male ratio is 2.1). Regionally, the average age of onset is 29.2 years in Europe. The 
age-standardized (standardized to 2013  European population) prevalence per 100,000  by different ethnicities 
was 180, 74  and 29  for the White,  Black and South Asian populations,  respectively. 
Globally,  there  were  18,932  deaths  (95%  CI  16,577  to  21,033)  attributed  to  MS  in  2016.  The  global  age 
standardized death rates decreased significantly from 1990 to 2016 (change -11.5% (95%CI -35.4% to -4.7%) 
(GBD  2016  Multiple  Sclerosis  Collaborators).  In  2016,  the  pooled  crude  mortality  rate  was  9.78  per  1000 
person-years (95% CI 6.81-14.02).  Pooled all-cause standardized mortality rate (SMR) per 1000 person-years 
was 2.80 (95% CI 2.74-2.87),  2.56 (95% CI 2.47-2.66)  in males and 3.06 (95% CI 2.97-3.17)  in females. The 
overall mortality rates in population based French and US MS cohorts were 3.7 and 8.9 per 1000 person-years, 
respectively. In an administrative database from Manitoba  province in  Canada, the  relative risk (RR) of death 
in the MS population was 3 times higher at age 39 years and younger (RR 3.65; 95%  CI: 3.48–3.83)  and ages 
40 to 59 years (RR 2.88; 95% CI: 2.81–2.95)  and 2 times higher at age 80 and older (RR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.79–
1.80).  The majority of studies report that  60 to 70% of deaths occurring in MS patients  are attributable  to the 
disease itself or its complications. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The  aetiology  of  MS  remains  unknown.  Generally,  it  is  assumed  that  MS  is  mediated  by  some  kind  of 
autoimmune process that  is triggered by an infection  which, superimposed on a genetic predisposition. 
The  immune-mediated  damage  in  MS  involves  both  T-cells  and  B-cells,  which  play  important  roles  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  MS.  Specifically,  it  has  been  shown  that  B-cells  are  factors  contributing  to  the  immune-
mediated histopathology in  MS. B-cells are present in  the chronic plaques, areas of demyelination, and in  the 
cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. As B-cells have essential functions  in regulating the immune response, they 
may contribute  to disease pathogenesis by 
o 
(Self-)antigen presentation, serving as cellular adjuvants for CD4+ T-cell activation 
o  Regulating  T-cell  function  and  inflammation  via cytokine production,  i.e.  instructing  encephalitogenic 
T-cells  
o  Producing autoantibodies 
While  very  few  B-cells  infiltrate  the  healthy  CNS,  their  number  increases  during  inflammation.  Increasing 
evidence suggests  that  B-cells settling  the  CNS  during  inflammation  mature  outside  the  CNS,  in  secondary 
lymphoid  organs,  and  that  T-cell  clones  attacking  brain  structures  are  instructed  in  the  periphery  by 
autoreactive  B-cells.  Consequently,  the  depletion  of  B-cells  in  lymphatic  tissues  is  an  efficacious  treatment 
approach in  MS.  Further,  anti-CD20  monoclonal antibodies  that  permit  SC  administration  may offer  a  more 
efficient targeting  of  B-cells residing in  the lymphatic  circulatory system. The depletion  of brain parenchymal 
and meningeal B-cells may be an additional factor for the mode of action.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
MS  is  an  acquired idiopathic,  inflammatory  demyelinating disorder of  the  CNS  in  which  the  myelin sheath  is 
disrupted due to genetic and environmental factors.  There are no markers specific for MS diagnosis. Diagnosis 
mainly  depends  on  the  medical  history  and  neurological  examination.  The  attacks  are  defined  as  new 
neurological deficits lasting  more than 24  hours, that can be associated with  an anatomical localization, in the 
absence of fever or any infection.  Usually the neurological deficit develops subacutely over 2 to 4  weeks, and 
it  usually  resolves completely  or  partially  over 6  to  8  weeks, either  spontaneously, or  after  treatment  with 
corticosteroids. Different clinical and pathological subtypes of MS have been identified. In about 80–85%  of the 
patients there are attacks (relapses), and complete or partial remissions following them, whereas in 10–15%, 
there  is  a  slow  progressive  course  without  any  relapses.  Inflammatory  demyelinating  magnetic  resonance 
imaging (MRI) findings  suggestive of MS in  patients who has never experienced a relapse, but had an MRI for 
other  reasons,  named  as  radiological  isolated  syndrome.  Since  there  are  no  clinical  signs  or  symptoms 
associated with  MS,  this group  is not  included to  the  subtypes of MS. On  the  other hand, patients  presenting 
with  isolated optic neuritis, spinal cord involvement, or brainstem syndrome, and/or hemispheric involvement, 
with  findings resembling MS plaques on MRI, are called to have CIS which is considered the first attack of MS. 
Lublin  et  al.  grouped  the  clinical  patterns  in  1996  as  RRMS,  relapsing  progressive  MS,  SPMS,  and  PPMS. 
Moreover, in 2013,  active and non-active forms were added: 
1.  CIS 
2.  RRMS: Active and non-active RRMS 
3.  Progressive MS:  Active  progressive, active  non-progressive, non-active  progressive, non-active  non-
progressive (stable) subtypes were described. 
Within  ten  years more  than  50%  of  patients  who  suffer from  a  relapsing-remitting  form  eventually develop 
sustained disability  with  or without  superimposed relapses; this  form is called the  SPMS. The term “relapsing 
MS (RMS)” applies to those affected patients either with  a RRMS or SPMS with superimposed relapses. Patients 
with  relapsing  MS,  in  spite  of  suffering  from  different  MS  forms,  constitute  a  common  target  for  current 
treatment options. There are no clear criteria that  mark the transition  from RRMS to SPMS. 
The diagnostic criteria MS, first developed in the 1950s, have since undergone several revisions, all focused on 
three main requirements for a diagnosis of MS: 1) Objective clinical evidence of CNS involvement. 2) Evidence 
of lesions disseminated in time and space. 3) Exclusion of other conditions that  could better explain the clinical 
and paraclinical findings. Before the  widespread use of  MR imaging,  the criteria for dissemination in  time and 
space  were fulfilled  by  two  attacks  involving  different  parts  of  the  CNS  and  clinical  evidence  of  two  lesions 
separated in  time, or one attack with  additional  paraclinical evidence of another lesion. In 2001,  McDonald et 
al  fully  integrated  the  use  of  MRI  into  the  diagnostic  schema  as  an  alternative  to  clinical  evidence  for 
dissemination  in  time  and  space,  allowing  an  earlier diagnosis of  MS.  The  McDonald  criteria  were revised in 
2005,  2010 and 2017,  building on new evidence for the  role of MRI.  
2.1.5.  Management 
The  current  therapeutic  approach  involves  symptomatic  treatment,  treatment  of  acute  relapses, and  DMT. 
Symptomatic treatment refers to  all therapies applied to improve symptoms and complications caused by the 
disease. More specific treatments are those that intend to interfere with the pathophysiology of MS e.g. facilitate 
remyelination or axonal conductivity. The standard of care for acute relapses is methylprednisolone intravenous 
(IV) Methylprednisolone shortens the duration of a relapse but has no influence on its  sequelae. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 10/138 
 
 
 
DMT  aim  to  modify  the  course  of  the  disease  mainly  by  suppressing  or  modulating  the  immune  responses 
involved  in  MS  pathogenesis.  Biologicals (therapeutic  proteins,  monoclonal  antibodies)  and  small  molecules 
have been approved for use in this therapeutic context. These therapies aim to prevent relapses and ultimately 
intend  to  decrease  the  rate  of  accumulation  of  disability.  Due  to  the  risks  (identified  or  potential)  of 
opportunistic  infections, malignancies, and other systemic adverse drug reactions, several of these treatment 
options  are considered as second-line options i.e.  treatment is  restricted to patients  with  rapidly evolving MS 
or those who  had a suboptimal response to prior therapies. 
It  is  often  recommended that  patients  should  be  able  to  take  a  DMT  as  early as  they  are  diagnosed.  Two 
conceptually different treatment approaches have emerged: 
-  The  ’escalation  approach’ advocates the  first  line  use  of  moderately effective DMTs  (i.e.  classical  first-line 
therapies, e.g. interferons and glatiramer acetate) and a later escalation to  high-efficacy therapies only if new 
disease activity breaks through, i.e. relapses or new lesions as shown by MRI. 
- The ‘highly effective treatment early approach’ advocates initiation of high efficacy therapies early on (as first 
line  therapy). Treatment-related risks are weighed  against  the  expected occurrence of brain  damage caused 
by the disease. 
Several DMTs/DMT classes are currently available and approved for use in RMS, which vary in their mechanism 
of action, efficacy, safety, mode of administration and ease of use. Treatments included in these DMT classes, 
listed  in alphabetical order, are: Alemtuzumab; Beta-interferons; Cladribine; Dimethyl fumarate; Fingolimod; 
Glatiramer acetate; Mitoxantrone; Natalizumab; Ocrelizumab; Ozanimod; Siponimod; Teriflunomide. 
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against proteins expressed by B-cells, e.g. anti-CD20 antibodies, such 
as  ocrelizumab  and  rituximab,  are  high-efficacy  therapies  offering  the  same  high  efficacy  as  other  highly 
efficacious DMTs, including  (but not limited to) mAbs like natalizumab and alemtuzumab, but at the same time 
show a better safety profile. 
Ocrelizumab was the  first mAb targeting B-cells approved for the treatment of relapsing (and PP) forms of MS. 
Ocrelizumab is dosed via the IV route. 
About the product 
Kesimpta (ofatumumab) is a recombinant fully human type 1 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb, which specifically 
targets a unique composite epitope on the CD20 molecule expressed on B-cells. The binding of ofatumumab to 
CD20 induces B-cell lysis primarily through  complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and, to a lesser extent, 
by  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  Direct triggering  of  B-cell  death  /  apoptosis  as  a 
third mode of action is less relevant for ofatumumab. 
Ofatumumab  mode of action 
Ofatumumab  specifically recognizes a unique  conformational epitope  encompassing both  the  large and small 
extracellular loops on the  human  CD20 molecule, which allows ofatumumab  binding very close to  the  plasma 
membrane. This  composite epitope  is  separate from  the  epitopes on  the  large loop  of  CD20  that  other  anti-
CD20 mAbs bind (e.g. rituximab and ocrelizumab). 
CD20 is  expressed on late pre-B-cells, mature  B-cells, and  memory B-cells, while not  expressed on lymphoid 
stem or plasma cells. The binding  of ofatumumab to CD20 induces B-cell lysis primarily through CDC and, to a

lesser extent,  by ADCC. Direct triggering of B-cell death /  apoptosis as a third  mode of action  is less relevant 
for ofatumumab.  Due to the  broad expression of  CD20 on various B-cell subsets, the  CD20-dependent  mode 
of action of ofatumumab can induce very pronounced and sustained depletion of B-cells in both,  experimental 
animals and humans. 
The  mode of  action  of  ofatumumab  is  similar  to  rituximab  and  ocrelizumab. No  relevant  difference in  ADCC 
activity of ofatumumab compared to ocrelizumab was observed, while it was higher than rituximab. In contrast, 
CDC-dependent  B-cell lysis  induced  by  ofatumumab  was  more active  than  rituximab  and  ocrelizumab.  CDC 
occurs when  the  complement factor  C1q  binds  to  the  complement binding  region of  the  Fc  part  of  the  anti-
CD20 antibody and triggers a cascade of events that results in the formation of the membrane attack complex, 
a  pore  in  the  plasma  membrane  that  contains  the  downstream  complement  factors  C5  to  C9.  These  pores 
enable the  inflow  of water  into  the  cell, finally  resulting in  cell  lysis. In contrast  to  ocrelizumab or rituximab, 
the  binding  epitope  of  ofatumumab  close  to  the  plasma  membrane  may  enable  Fc-mediated  complement 
binding  to  occur  in  close  proximity  to  the  cell  surface, contributing  to  a  more  efficacious  CDC  initiated  by 
ofatumumab. In addition,  B-cell binding  studies showed a lower off-rate (i.e. dissociation rate of the antibody 
from the  CD20 receptor) for ofatumumab in comparison to rituximab, which  is of functional  importance. 
In conclusion, nonclinical data indicate that ofatumumab might have higher potency in CDC induction in primary 
human B-cells when compared with  ocrelizumab and rituximab. 
Route of administration 
It  has  been  shown  that  biopharmaceuticals  with  a  high  molecular  weight,  such  as  mAbs,  exhibit  limited 
transport  into  the  blood  capillaries  when  administered  SC  and  enter  the  systemic  circulation  via  an  indirect 
route  through  the lymphatics.  In a  human CD20  transgenic mouse model,  SC administration  of ofatumumab 
resulted in  more direct  access to  lymph nodes as compared to  IV administration of  the drug.  In addition,  the 
SC administration of an anti-CD20 antibody (in  contrast to its IV administration)  significantly decreased T-cell 
infiltration  in  the  brain  in  a  chronic  MS  mouse  model.  In  summary,  these  results  suggest  that  the  SC 
administration  could  be  more  effective  than  the  IV  administration  of  anti-CD20  antibodies.  However, 
ocrelizumab and rituximab are both administered IV.   
The direct access to lymphatic system, a primary location of MS pathology and a target  for MS therapies, may 
contribute to  the lower dose selection for ofatumumab to achieve clinical efficacy, with  a corresponding better 
tolerability avoiding some infusion/injection related events observed with higher doses of ofatumumab.  
In  addition,  SC  administration  of  therapeutic  proteins,  compared  to  IV  administration,  might  offer  more 
flexibility and convenience for patients depending on lifestyle preferences.   
In summary, both  the  CD20-binding  epitope of  ofatumumab and  its  SC route of  administration  lead to  a low 
required dose, which allows SC administration  in a small volume (20  mg in 0.4 ml). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ofatumumab,  the  active  substance  in  Kesimpta,  is  a  fully  human  anti-CD20  IgG1k  monoclonal  antibody 
expressed in a recombinant murine NS0  cell line. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 12/138 
 
 
 
Kesimpta is presented in  a solution  for SC injection  in a  single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) or single-use pre-
filled pen (PFP) (Sensoready). Each PFS or PFP contains 20 mg ofatumumab in 0.4 mL solution.  
Kesimpta is formulated with  L-arginine, sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80, disodium 
edetate dihydrate, hydrochloride acid, and water for injections (WFI).   
Kesimpta  is available in  unit  packs containing  1  PFS  or 1  PFP  and  in  multipacks  containing  3  (3  packs of  1) 
PFSs or PFPs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that belongs to the IgG1k isotype subclass, with 
a  standard  antibody  molecule  composition  of  two  heavy  and  two  light  chains.  Both  heavy  chains  contain 
oligosaccharide chains linked to  the  protein backbone at  Asn302.  The theoretical molecular mass is 146  kDa, 
calculated  from  the  amino  acid  composition  deduced  from  the  DNA  sequence.  Ofatumumab  recognises  an 
epitope on two extracellular loops of the human CD20 molecule expressed on B cells. CD20 is involved in B cell 
activation,  regulation of B  cell growth,  and transmembrane flux. Binding  of Ofatumumab  to  CD20 induces B-
cell  lysis. The B  cell depleting  activity  of  Ofatumumab is  thought  to  be primarily mediated  by CDC and,  to  a 
lesser extent, by ADCC.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the  manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacture and testing of the active substance are performed at Lonza Biologics Inc., 101 International Drive, 
Portsmouth, NH  03801,  United  States, except for potency testing,  which is performed at Novartis Pharma AG, 
Basel, Switzerland. Cell banks are stored at two locations. EU  GMP compliance was confirmed for all sites. 
The  manufacturing  process is  standard  for  a  monoclonal  antibody.  It  consists  of  a  fed-batch  upstream  cell 
culture process and a downstream purification process.  
The cell culture process involves the propagation of recombinant NS0 cells expressing the ofatumumab protein 
from a  working cell bank  (WCB) vial through  inoculation  of  bioreactors of  gradually increasing size up  to  the 
final fed-batch production bioreactor. 
The harvest procedure involves clarification by centrifugation followed by filtration.  The clarified supernatant is 
processed for further clarification and bioburden reduction by continuous filtration.   
The  downstream  purification  process  consists  of  several  chromatographic  steps,  ultrafitration,  diafiltration, 
virus inactivation  and filtration, followed by filling  and freezing steps. 
In-process  controls  (IPCs)  and  main  process parameters  have  been  defined,  including  their  corresponding 
acceptance limits/acceptable ranges. Hold times are applied for the cell culture process and for the purification 
process. Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been defined.  
In the ofatumumab process, reprocessing is supported.

Control of materials 
Raw materials. 
The only raw materials of biological or recombinant origin used for the manufacture of the active substance are 
foetal bovine serum (FBS), used for cryopreservation of the master cell bank (MCB), and recombinant Protein 
A, used for the affinity chromatography step of the  purification process. The FBS is accompanied by a Ph. Eur. 
CEP for TSE safety. The Protein A is expressed in E. coli, fermented in an animal-material free medium.  
All components of cell culture media, supplements and feeds are described. All raw materials of non-compendial 
quality are tested according to in-house specifications, which  are provided.  
Source, history, and generation of the cell substrate 
The parental  NS0 cell  line was  sourced from ECACC (European Collection  of Authenticated  Cell Cultures)  and 
used to develop the expressing cell line. A parental WCB derived from a parental MCB was used for transfection 
of the expression vector. 
The production cell banks, post-production cell banks (PPCBs) and bulk harvests derived from the parental cell 
bank have been comprehensively tested for the absence of adventitious and endogenous agents, using both in 
vivo and in vitro assays. No adventitious agents were detected, with the exception of A- and C-type endogenous 
retrovirus-like particles (RVLP). The presence of RVLP in many rodent cell lines is well known and of no concern. 
No infectious retroviruses were detected in the parental cell banks.  
The  variable  sequences of  the  heavy  chain  (VH)  and  light  chain  (VL)  for  ofatumumab  were  amplified  from 
subcloned  hybridoma  cells  expressing  human  anti-CD20  IgG.  The  hybridoma  clones  were  generated  by 
immunisation  of  a human  immunoglobulin  transgenic mouse  strain with  CD20  antigen  from transfected  NS0 
cells, followed by fusion  of isolated the  splenocytes with  a myeloma cell  line. The variable gene regions were 
assembled with  the  constant  heavy and  light  chain  regions  into  a  double-gene  expression vector.  The  DNA 
sequence of the variable regions was verified by sequencing in both  forward and reverse orientation.  
The expression vector was used for transfection of cells from the NS0 cell line. Lead clones were selected based 
on  productivity  and  growth.  The  final  lead  cell  line  was  subjected  to  capillary  aided  single  cell  cloning  and 
following adaptation  of the  clones to  chemically defined animal component free medium, a clone was selected 
as lead cell line. 
Cell banking system, characterisation and testing 
A MCB and WCBs derived from it  have been generated. The MCB can be used to  generate additional WCBs, as 
needed. PPCBs have been generated as well, one was used for determination of limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA).  
The cell banks have been tested according to ICH Q5A, Q5B, and Q5E guidelines, including analysis for species 
identity,  adventitious  and  endogenous  agents,  cell  line  homogeneity  through  determination  of  productivity, 
growth  characteristics, and  product  quality,  and  genetic  characterisation at  both  DNA  and  mRNA  level. The 
characterisation of the cell banks is in line with  current guidelines and considered adequate. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
IPCs  have  been  defined  for  each  step  of  the  manufacturing  process.  Their  corresponding  action  limits  or 
acceptance criteria are considered appropriate. Critical steps are identified in the manufacturing process.

Process validation 
Cell culture process 
Commercial scale  batches  have  been  included  in  the  process  validation  studies  for  the  cell  culture  process. 
During process validation defined process parameters and IPCs were monitored. Overall, the  approach taken 
for  validation  of  the  cell  culture  process  is  considered  acceptable  and  in  line  with  current  guidelines.  The 
acceptable ranges and control  limits  were met  for all validation  runs. All  batches met  the  acceptance criteria 
for absence of adventitious agents of both viral and non-viral nature (testing performed at pre-harvest). Control 
limits  for  ongoing  process  verification  have  been  established.  After  purification,  all  batches  met  the  active 
substance specifications valid at the time of testing. Overall, the approach taken for validation of the cell culture 
process is considered acceptable and in line with  current guidelines.  
Purification process 
Commercial scale batches have been included in the process validation studies for the purification process. All 
batches  were also  used  for validation  of  the  cell  culture  process.  During process validation,  defined  process 
parameters  and  IPCs  were  monitored.  The  protein  purification  process  has  been  validated  for  consistent 
manufacturing performance, removal of product- and process related impurities, and sanitary processing. The 
acceptable ranges  and  control  limits  were met  for all  three  validation  runs,  including  in-process  acceptance 
criteria established  for microbial control.  Yields were observed to  be consistent  from batch  to  batch.  Product 
quality  was determined in  terms of  purity,  percentage of  monomers vs aggregates, and  charged variants for 
the  complete  purification  process. All  results  complied  with  the  specification  valid  at  the  time  of  testing  and 
indicated consistency of the product quality throughout  the purification  process. 
Efficient  and consistent  removal of  process-related impurities, to  levels which  are generally below LOQ,  have 
been demonstrated. 
Overall, the  approach taken for  validation of  the  protein  purification  process is considered acceptable and  in 
line with  current guidelines. 
Additional process validation studies 
In addition, the following  process validation studies were performed:  
Re-use  of  chromatographic  resin  and  ultrafiltration  membranes.  Resin  and  membrane  lifetimes  were 
determined from concurrent process validation at commercial scale, supported by small scale studies. 
Storage conditions were validated and demonstrated to be efficacious in  terms of microbial control.  
All hold times  were validated for potential  impact on the  biochemical quality and microbial control (bioburden 
and endotoxin) of the  active substance.  
Validation  of reprocessing at  individual  steps  demonstrate that  the  claimed reprocessing at  these steps  does 
not have any detectable impact on the product quality. 
All  consumables  and  equipment  used,  which  could  potentially  leach  chemical  substances  into  the  active 
substance were subjected to a risk assessment for leachables and extractables. Furthermore, the primary active 
substance packaging material was evaluated for extractables. The results obtained demonstrate that the single-
use items and the  primary packaging material are safe for their intended  use, with  respect to  leachables.

Manufacturing process development   
Process development 
During development four different  processes have been applied for the  manufacture of the  active substance, 
Process A,  B, C,  and D (commercial process). Only Process C  and D material  has been used for clinical  trials 
for the  indication  proposed for this  marketing authorisation  application,  while  Process A and  B were used for 
the  previous oncological  indication  only  (Arzerra (EMA/H/C/00131,  marketing  authorisation  withdrawn).  The 
changes introduced between Process C and Process D involved a site transfer, a process scale up, introduction 
of  a  WCB,  introduction  of  stirred  tank  bioreactors for  expansion  of  inoculum  for  the  production  bioreactor, 
removal of a step, and a change of the formulation buffer. Post-process validation changes of Process D involved 
additional sampling points for bioburden and endotoxin, and process optimisations.  
Comparability studies 
Comparability  studies  have  been  performed,  involving  comparison  of  release  data  and  extended 
characterisation. Overall, the  results provided support comparability of process C and D material.  
Process evaluation. 
Prior to  the start  of the  process evaluation studies  for Process D,  a process risk assessment (based on a gap 
analysis  methodology)  was  used  to  assess  the  process-  and  product-related  risks  of  the  active  substance 
manufacturing process and to identify the process parameters which should be further investigated by process 
evaluation  studies,  based  on  their  assessed  potential  impact  on  the  critical  quality  attributes  (CQA).  The 
approach taken for process evaluation is  considered appropriate and sufficient and the  conclusions drawn are 
supported by the  results obtained. 
The Applicant has applied QbD principles during process development. 
Control strategy 
The control strategy for the active substance is based on the following control elements: design control, process 
control, raw material control, in-process testing,  process development/process evaluation, process validation, 
release testing, and stability testing. CQAs have been ranked according to their assessed criticality, and relevant 
control  elements for  the  individual CQAs have been  selected accordingly. Overall, the  justifications  given for 
the selection of control elements made and the  overall control strategy in place is considered appropriate and 
capable of ensuring consistent manufacture of the active substance of the intended  quality.  
Characterisation  
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
Physico-chemical characterisation 
The physico-chemical characteristics of ofatumumab has been characterised using a panel of different methods. 
Biochemical attributes  such as primary structure, higher order structures (secondary, tertiary and quaternary 
structure),  carbohydrate  structure,  heterogeneity  (i.e.  by  size  and  charge),  and  other  attributes  were 
determined. 
It was confirmed that ofatumumab had the expected primary structure with  100% sequence coverage, as well 
as  the  expected  masses  in  intact  and  reduced/alkylated  forms.  Ofatumumab  contains  the  expected  IgG1 
disulfide bond linkages. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 16/138 
 
 
 
Structural  analyses of  ofatumumab  active  substance  show  that  ofatumumab  had  the  expected higher  order 
structures.  
Ofatumumab  batches had consistent  N-glycan  distribution,  and the  expected N-glycosylation for  an antibody 
produced in NS0  cells. No  O-glycosylation sites were detected.  
Charge heterogeneity was evaluated and showed similar amounts of charge variants. The isoelectric point (pI) 
of ofatumumab was determined. 
Size variants of ofatumumab were assessed and all tested samples had low and similar amounts of size variants. 
In  conclusion,  the  results  from all  applied analytical  techniques  showed that  ofatumumab  has  the  expected 
physico-chemical properties consistent with  a typical IgG1 molecule. 
Biological characterisation 
Biological  activity/potency  of  ofatumumab  was  characterised  using  several  assays. Potency  of  the  samples 
tested was determined and expressed as relative potency. Relative potency was calculated using a parallel line 
assay according to Ph. Eur. 5.3.   
Ofatumumab  binding  to  cells endogenously expressing human  CD20  was  analysed based competitive  target 
binding  assay.  Potency  values  obtained  for  batches  tested  as  relative  target  binding  versus  the  primary 
reference substance were similar. 
The ability of ofatumumab to induce CDC, the primary mode of action, was determined using a functional assay 
with  target cells. Obtained potency values were well within relative potency limits; no difference was observed 
between the active substance batches tested.  
The  ability  of  ofatumumab  to  induce  ADCC  was  determined  using  a  functional  assay  with  target  cells  and 
effector cells.  In  addition,  a surrogate  ADCC assay format  was  applied.  With  both  ADCC assay formats,  the 
obtained relative potency values showed only minor differences between batches tested. 
The  ability  of  ofatumumab  to  induce  antibody  dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP)  was  assessed 
qualitatively, using  a functional  assay with  target  and effector cells. In addition,  a surrogate ADCP assay was 
applied. With both  ADCP assay formats, no differences were observed between the batches tested.   
C1q binding of ofatumumab was similar between the batches tested and the primary reference standard. 
The binding kinetics and relative affinity of the ofatumumab samples to FcγRIa, FcγRIIaHR, FcγRIIaLR, FcγRIIb, 
FcgRIIIaF158,  FcgRIIIaV158,  FcγRIIIb  and  FcRn  were  analysed.  Binding  kinetics  and  affinity  were  similar 
between the tested samples. 
In conclusion, the  analysed ofatumumab batches showed similar biological activity  characteristics with  an  Fc-
effector  function  profile  as  expected  for  the  IgG1κ  isotype.  Overall,  the  assays  used  for  biological 
characterisation  are  considered  appropriate and  addressing  all  relevant  attributes  and  effector  functions  of 
Ofatumumab.  
Impurities 
Forced degradation studies 
In  order  to  understand  the  product-  and  process-related  variants  and  impurities,  the  impurity  profile  of 
ofatumumab active substance was investigated. Forced degradation studies were executed to  understand the 
degradation pathways  and to  confirm the  suitability  of the  selected stability-indicating  methods for  detecting

product-related  variants or impurities.  The  degradation products  were subjected  to  characterisation, using  a 
panel  of  orthogonal  methods  for  detection  of  product-related  impurities.  Potential  impact  on  potency  was 
determined.  
Potency assays demonstrated sensitivity for thermal, basic, oxidative, and light stress. 
Identification and characterisation of product-related substances/impurities: 
Identification and characterisation of product-related substances/impurities was performed.  
Overall,  the  stress  conditions  and  methods  applied  for  characterisation  of  product-related  impurities  are 
considered appropriate and the characterisation of the impurities obtained is considered sufficient. 
Specification 
The release specification for the  active substance includes  control identity, purity  and impurities, potency and 
other general tests. The test panel is acceptable and in line with  the requirements of ICH Q6B.  
Overall, the  release specifications are considered acceptable and the  selected methods  are found  appropriate 
and fit for purpose.  
Analytical procedures  
Reference to Ph. Eur. for compendial methods and brief, but adequate descriptions of non-compendial methods 
applied for release testing have been provided.   
Validation  protocols  and  results  have  been  provided.  All  non-compendial  methods  have  been  validated 
according to  ICH  Q2.  Bioburden and  endotoxin testing  are conducted and  validated according to  Ph.  Eur.  All 
acceptance criteria were met. The analytical methods have been adequately validated. The analytical methods 
chosen to monitor the ofatumumab active substance have been demonstrated to be suitable for their intended 
purpose. 
Batch  analysis 
Batch release data have been provided for batches manufactured at full scale Process D at Lonza Porthsmouth, 
US.  All  batch  release  results  are  compliant  with  the  acceptance  criteria  valid  at  the  time  of  testing, 
demonstrating  that  the  proposed  commercial  Process D  is  able  to  consistently  deliver  ofatumumab  active 
substance of the  intended quality.  
Reference  standard 
The  quality  of  ofatumumab  active  substance  and  finished  product  is  monitored  by  a  two-tiered  reference 
standard  approach  with  a  PRS  and  a  working  reference  standard  (WRS).  Both  reference standards  were 
manufactured using commercial Process D. The qualification  of reference standards included testing  according 
to  the active substance release test  specification, in  addition  to a  comprehensive characterisation. All release 
and stability data met the acceptance criteria in place at  the time of testing.  
Based on the additional characterisation, comparability was demonstrated.  
The system for qualification and retesting of the reference standards for Ofatumumab is considered appropriate 
and the primary and working reference standards are considered fit for purpose. 
In order to  ensure continuity  of the reference standards over time, a new PRS or WRS is only released on the 
basis of specific criteria which have been defined. This is acceptable.

Container closure  
The ofatumumab bulk active substance is filled into  bags. 
The contact  layer is  compliant with  Ph.Eur..  Compliance with  “EC regulation  no. 10/2011  on plastic  materials 
and articles intended  to come into contact  with food” has also been confirmed. 
The choice of packaging material for the active substance is considered justified, based on the physical/chemical 
properties of the active substance, and the fact that the active substance is an aqueous solution.  The proposed 
container is for routine storage and is therefore used in the stability studies, supporting the  proposed shelf-life 
and storage of ofatumumab bulk active substance.   
Stability 
Active substance batches, manufactured according to Process D at commercial scale, were tested in registration 
stability studies under the following storage conditions: long-term storage conditions, two different accelerated 
storage conditions,  intermediate storage conditions, and stressed storage conditions. The registration stability 
studies are all completed and data throughout  the entire duration of the studies have been provided. 
In addition, a freeze/thaw stability  study and a photostability  study were performed.  
Follow-up  stability  studies  are  ongoing,  including  at  least  one  batch  annually  from  each  year,  where 
ofatumumab active substance is manufactured. 
The stability  studies  are conducted in  line  with  current  guidelines. The  analytical methods applied  have been 
shown  to  be  stability  indicating  based  on  forced  degradation  studies  and  stability  studies  performed under 
stressed storage conditions, including light  exposure. 
All stability results from studies under long-term, accelerated, and following freeze/thaw cycles, complied with 
the acceptance criteria in place at the  time of testing. 
A sufficient number of commercially manufactured active substance batches have been included in the stability 
studies. The batches tested during stability were stored in the primary packaging material intended for routine 
storage of ofatumumab active substance. 
The proposed shelf life is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Description of the  finished product 
The finished product is a sterile single-use, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to slightly 
brownish-yellow solution  for injection, containing  20  mg ofatumumab in  0.4  mL solution  (concentration  of 50 
mg/mL). Ofatumumab is formulated with the following excipients: arginine, sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium 
chloride, polysorbate 80,  disodium edetate, hydrochloric acid 25% and water for injections. The excipients are 
all of pharmacopoeial grade and selected for their suitability for SC administration. There are no novel excipients 
or excipients of human or animal origin. 
The  primary  container  closure  for  ofatumumab  finished  product  is  a  syringe  (type  I  glass)  with  two 
presentations:  a  PFS  assembled  with  a  plunger  rod  and  a  needle  safety  device  (NSD)  and  a  PFP  (Pen) 
corresponding to the syringe assembled in an auto-injector (AI). 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 19/138 
 
 
 
The syringe assembled with  NSD (PFS-NSD)  is  packaged in  a  blister,  and then  placed in  a  carton box,  while 
the syringe assembled in an AI (PFS-AI) is placed directly in a carton box. The carton boxes are provided with 
a tamper evident feature. 
Pharmaceutical  development 
A  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  used  in  the  development  of  the  finished  product,  outlining  the 
intended  product  performance. The  QTPP covers the  active  ingredient,  mechanism of  action,  administration, 
dosage  form  and  strength,  packaging  material,  finished  product  shelf-life,  patient  convenience,  compendial 
requirements and impurities. The chosen QTPP is considered adequate to address the clinical needs. 
Critical quality attributes  and control strategy 
The  CQAs have been  assessed and  based on  their  criticality  they were  divided into  categories, and  relevant 
control  elements  for  each  individual  CQA  have  been  selected  accordingly.  CQAs  have  been  assigned  for 
ofatumumab. 
The  control  strategy  for  the  finished  product  is  based  on  the  criticality  assessment of  the  identified  quality 
attributes  and  applies  to  the  finished  product  and  its  manufacturing  process, including  release and  stability 
testing.  The  control  strategy  is  based  on  design  control,  process  control,  raw  material  control,  in-process 
testing,  process development/process evaluation, process validation, release testing, and stability  testing.  
The justifications  for the  selected control  elements and the  overall control strategy  is considered appropriate 
and it ensures a consistent manufacture resulting in ofatumumab finished product of the desired quality. 
Formulation development 
Originally ofatumumab was developed for oncology treatment under the name Arzerra (see above). The initially 
developed formulation,  with  a different  antibody concentration,  and presented in  a vial. Clinical  development 
for a MS indication  was initiated  later. During development the formulation was changed. 
Additionally, as ofatumumab is to be delivered SC, a change in  primary packaging from vial to PFS was made. 
The Applicant has applied QbD principles during the  formulation development. Formulation robustness studies 
were performed to  assess the impact  of composition  variations on the  CQAs of the  product  and the  intended 
commercial presentation of  ofatumumab finished  product.  The proposed commercial formulation is  therefore 
considered robust.  
Physicochemical and biological properties 
The  key physicochemical and  biological parameters of the  finished  product  have been identified.  The  chosen 
formulation  adequately  accommodates  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the  active  substance.  The 
physicochemical  and  biological  parameters  have  all  been  adequately  described,  and  they  are  adequately 
controlled during release and shelf-life.  
Manufacturing  process development 
Standard aseptic  processing techniques  are used for  the  manufacturing  of  the  finished product.  The  process 
involves standard pharmaceutical operations including sterile filtration  and aseptic filling which  are performed 
according to  pharmacopoeial and current GMP requirements.

Comparability  studies  were  performed  during  development  of  the  manufacturing  process.  The  studies 
demonstrate that the changes made during development do not have an impact on the quality attributes of the 
finished product;  the different presentations of ofatumumab  finished product, and a  change in  manufacturing 
site for ofatumumab finished product resulted in comparable finished products. 
The  final  commercial  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  was  developed  and  evaluated  by  the 
Applicant. Batches have been manufactured at Novartis in Switzerland with normal operating range (NOR) and 
proven acceptable range (PAR) of the process parameters were established during process development. 
Process  development  studies  have  been  performed  to  support  the  proposed  process  parameters.  Detailed 
descriptions  of  the  studies  have  been  provided  in  the  dossier,  and  a  summary  has  been  included  in  this  
assessment report. The development studies demonstrate that  the proposed NORs and PARs are appropriate. 
Container closure 
The  container  closure  system  selected  for  Kesimpta  (see  above)  is  considered  suitable.  It  consists  of  the 
following components: a sterile, single-use syringe (glass syringe barrel (type I glass) with  staked needle and 
a plunger rubber stopper) and a rigid needle shield (RNS) as the primary packaging components. It  has been 
demonstrated that there is no sorption to the components of the primary container closure.  
The  syringe is assembled with  two  different  medical devices (secondary packaging) -  a  needle safety device 
(NSD)  and  an  auto-injector  (AI). When  assembled, the  PFS-NSD  and  PFS-AI are packed in  outer secondary 
packaging.  The  suitability  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  investigated.  The  components  of  the 
primary  container  closure  comply  with  either  pharmacopoeial  monographs  or  ISO  standards.  None  of  the 
components of the  medical devices (NSD and AI) are in contact  with the  finished product.  
The PFS was  subjected to extractables and leachables studies  in order to  investigate and determine the  level 
of  compounds being  extracted from  the  container  closure system components  under worst-case  and normal 
conditions. No  volatile, semi-volatile or non-volatile compounds, or elements, were detected in the  incubation 
extracts  of  the  selected  container  closure  system  in  concentrations  exceeding  the  Analytical  Evaluation 
Threshold (AET) corresponding to  the safety concern threshold (SCT).  
Suitability  for storage has  been demonstrated during  the  stability  testing  performed on the  finished  product. 
Suitability  for transportation  was  demonstrated by  a  shipping  verification  study.  The  analysis of  results  and 
summary of  the shipping  study have shown  that  the finished  product with  the stated  packaging and  shipping 
configurations is considered suitable for transportation when  tested according to applicable standards. 
For the device parts development activities were performed and demonstrate for the PFS-NSD and PFS-AI that 
the devices are safe and effective for the intended use by the  intended users.  
The  unassembled  PFS  as  well  as  the  auto-injector  are  medical  devices  and  comply  with  the  relevant 
requirements from the Medical Device Directive. 
Sufficient  information  is  provided  which  support  the  suitability  of  the  container  closure  system  to  ensure 
compatibility  with  ofatumumab  finished  product,  safety  of  contained  materials,  protection  of  the  finished 
product and dosage delivery.  
This data show that  the packaging materials and devices are compliant with  the test  requirements. 
In  accordance  with  the  sterilisation  guideline  (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015)  information  has  been 
provided.

Microbiological attributes 
Ofatumumab finished product is a sterile medication that  is supplied in  a single-dose PFS and is therefore not 
required to meet the antimicrobial effectiveness testing requirements. A container closure integrity test (CCIT) 
of containers is performed in order to monitor the  integrity and tightness of the primary packaging material. 
Compatibility 
During development of the product, compatibility with  the primary container closure system (i.e. glass syringe 
and plunger stoppers) was evaluated. Compatibility of ofatumumab finished product with the primary container 
was evaluated. The results of these studies demonstrated that ofatumumab finished product is compatible with 
the PFS intended for commercial manufacture. 
Compatibility with  manufacturing equipment was demonstrated during development studies. The compatibility 
is also confirmed during the stability studies. A leachables and extractables study was performed on the process 
contact  material.  No  volatiles,  semi-volatiles,  or  non-volatiles  were  detected  that  would  lead  to  parenteral 
intakes  exceeding  μg/day  threshold.  Additionally,  it  was  found  that  the  quality  of  Ofatumumab  was  not 
impacted by the  manufacturing process.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture   
Manufacturing and quality control testing of the finished product are performed by Novartis sites in Switzerland. 
Besides Novartis in Switzerland, several alternative secondary packaging sites in the  EU are used and listed in 
the  dossier.  EU  release testing  is  performed by  Novartis Pharma  GmbH,  Nuremberg,  Germany and  Novartis 
Farmacéutica SA, Barcelona Spain. EU  GMP compliance for all site has been confirmed. 
Description of process 
Ofatumumab  finished  product  is  manufactured  under  aseptic  conditions  and  is  considered  standard.  The 
manufacturing process consists  of the following  steps: manufacturing of the  excipient dilution  solution (EDS), 
active substance thawing,  manufacture of the  bulk  finished product  solution  and  manufacture of the  primary 
packaged product. After the  filling operation, ofatumumab finished product  in PFS is assembled into  either an 
auto-injector (AI), or assembled with a plunger rod, labelled and assembled with a needle safety device (NSD). 
The  PFS  in  AI  is  then  placed  in  a  cardboard box that  serves as secondary (outer)  packaging,  while  the  PFS 
assembled with  NSD  is  first  packaged within  a  blister  that  holds  the  syringe in  place, and  then  the  blister  is 
inserted into a cardboard box that serves as secondary (outer) packaging. The manufacturing process has been 
described in sufficient details in the  dossier. 
Critical process controls 
For  each operational step  during  manufacturing  of the  finished  product,  the  process parameters were tested 
and validated, and the required performance parameters were defined. The parameters were assessed as either 
critical,  key,  or  non-key.  In-process  controls  were  applied  for  several  of  the  manufacturing  steps  during 
manufacture.  Some  of  these  steps  were  evaluated  as  critical  steps.  The  proposed  critical  steps,  process 
parameters and  their  acceptance criteria  have  been  presented  and  are  considered adequate  to  control  the 
process leading to a product of consistent  quality.

Process validation 
The  manufacturing  process validation  covers the  entire  manufacturing  process. The  validation  studies  have 
been performed to demonstrate the suitability of the manufacturing conditions in order to guarantee consistent 
and reproducible quality  of the  final product at  the commercial manufacturing  site. Validation is  performed to 
demonstrate that the current validated procedures are acceptable.  
Production batches were used for validation of manufacturing process of ofatumumab finished product in PFS. 
All  batches fully met  the  quality  control release specifications as defined in  the  testing  monograph. Together 
with the IPC data and the additional testing it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is robust 
and consistently yields a product capable of meeting the pre-defined quality characteristics. 
During process validation the proposed hold times  for the manufacture of  ofatumumab finished product  were 
also validated. The results show that  the obtained hold times during the process validation were well within the 
limits. 
A summary of validation of assembling of the PFS with AI is included in the dossier. The results show that the 
manufacturing process of ofatumumab finished product is robust and consistently yields PFS in AI which meets 
the pre-determined quality characteristics.  
Product specification 
The release specification for the  finished product  includes control  identity,  purity and impurities,  potency and 
other general tests. The test panel is acceptable and in line with  the requirements of ICH Q6B. 
A justification of the specifications, including  test parameters, analytical methods and acceptance criteria, has 
been provided. Ofatumumab analytical specifications for active substance and  finished product  are aligned in 
order to  follow the  basic principles of  currently recognised standards of ICH guidelines as well as the  Ph. Eur. 
Monographs, and to ensure the quality of the product within  its  intended shelf life. 
Ofatumumab  finished  product  was  analysed  regarding  the  potential  elemental  impurities  of  concern  in 
accordance Ph.  Eur.  5.20  and  ICH  Q3D.  It  can be  concluded  that  the risk  and  the  impact  on  patient  safety 
associated with  the presence of elemental impurities in ofatumumab finished product is negligible. 
A risk evaluation concerning the potential  presence of nitrosamines in the finished product was performed. The 
risk evaluation  found  that  there  is  no  risk for  the  presence and/or  introduction  of nitrosamines  and/or  their 
formation  during  the  active  substance  manufacturing,  in  raw  materials,  in  excipients,  during  the  finished 
product manufacturing process, or in the packaging materials. This is acceptable. 
Analytical procedures  
The analytical methods chosen to monitor the ofatumumab finished product appearance, description, identity, 
purity, potency, quantity, microbiology and additional tests to control the finished product and container closure 
have  been  demonstrated  to  be  suitable  for  their  intended  purpose.  The  finished  product  specifications  will 
ensure the  product  quality  and  batch-to-batch  consistency  of ofatumumab  finished  product  throughout  shelf 
life.  
The analytical methods chosen to monitor the ofatumumab finished product assembled in an auto-injector have 
been demonstrated to be suitable for their  intended purpose.

Validation of analytical procedures 
Validation data has been provided for the methods used for release and stability testing. All acceptance criteria 
were met. The analytical methods have been adequately validated. 
Batch  analysis 
Batches of ofatumumab finished product in the primary packaging (PFS) have been subjected to batch analysis. 
Additionally, batches  were subjected to  additional analysis after assembling with  devices (PFS-NSD  and PFS-
AI). All the batches comply with  the  finished product release specifications, valid at the  time of batch release. 
The results demonstrate consistency between the batches during development, and uniformity of the product, 
indicating  that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Reference  standards 
The reference standards used for release and stability testing of ofatumumab finished product are the same as 
those used for the release and stability testing  of ofatumumab active substance.  
Container closure 
The  proposed container closure system  for Kesimpta  is  considered adequate (see section  on  Pharmaceutical 
development). 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for ofatumumab finished product PFS-NSD and PFS-AI is 24 months when stored at 5°C 
± 3°C,  protected from light. 
The  stability  studies  were designed in  accordance with  the  principles detailed  in  ICH  Q5C  and Q1A(R2).  The 
stability testing  covered those attributes from the proposed finished product specifications that are susceptible 
to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety and/or efficacy. The set of stability indicating  
methods applied provides assurance. The analytical methods used for testing of ofatumumab finished product 
during stability have been validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1), and they are stability  indicating. 
A sufficient number of commercially manufactured finished product batches have been included in the stability 
studies. 
For  all  the  stability  studies  performed on  ofatumumab  finished  product,  it  is  observed that  results  for  the 
batches, when stored at long term conditions (5 ± 3°C/ambient  RH) are all well within  the requirements set for 
long term storage conditions. 
Ofatumumab  batches  placed  on  stability  have  been  tested  at  accelerated  conditions  (25°C/60%  RH)  and 
stressed conditions (40°C/75%  RH). 
Photostability studies 
Photostability  studies  have been  performed in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ICH  Q1B  “Photostability 
Testing of New Active substances and Products”. Ofatumumab is susceptible to the applied light exposure and 
needs protection  from  light.  For  the  assembled product  in  the  secondary out  packaging, all  the  results  were 
within  specification limits.  
Stability program for transport and storage category assignment 
The Applicant has presented stability data. All results are within  specification limits. 
Assessment report

Overall, after review of  the  data  provided, the  proposed shelf  life  of  24  months  when  stored  at  5°C  ±  3°C  is 
acceptable.  The  statement  “do  not  freeze”  is  acceptable  based  on  the  recommendations  in  Guideline  on 
declaration of storage conditions (CPMP/QWP/609/96/Rev 2),  and the  claim “protect from light when stored in 
secondary packaging” is satisfactorily justified by the presented photostability  studies. 
Adventitious agents 
Raw materials – TSE 
No  raw  materials of animal-  or  human origin  are used  during  the  manufacture of  ofatumumab. During  early 
steps of the generation of the production cell line, animal-derived raw materials were used. A risk assessment 
has been conducted evaluating the risk of transmitting  TSE from these raw materials, considering the species 
and/or  geographical origin  and  the  manufacturing  process of  the  materials in  question.  Based on  the  above 
considerations, it  is concluded that  the risk of transmitting  infective TSE is negligible.  
Cell banks 
The MCB  and current WCB, and the  PPCB were tested  for absence of non-viral (mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi) 
and viral adventitious agents and endogenous retroviruses. The testing  was performed in accordance with ICH 
Q5A and verified the absence of adventitious agents and endogenous viruses, except for type A- and C- RVLP, 
known to be present in  the NS0 cell line. 
Bulk harvest 
Bulk harvest  is  tested  for the  absence of  mycoplasma and adventitious  viruses. Results  have been  provided 
from the  testing of active substance batches, verifying the absence of mycoplasma and viral contamination.  
Viral clearance studies 
The  viral  clearance  capacity  of  the  ofatumumab  active  substance  purification  process  (of  Process  D)  was 
evaluated by conducting viral clearance studies in accordance with  ICH Q5A. 
Conclusion 
Overall, the  risk of  contamination  with  adventitious  agents,  including  TSE,  mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi,  and 
viruses, is  considered well  contained  based  on  selection  of  safe raw  materials, demonstration  of  absence of 
adventitious  (and endogenous) agents in  cell banks, testing  at relevant stages of the  process, and  finally the 
substantial virus clearance capacity, demonstrated for the ofatumumab purification process. 
Overall, adventitious agents safety is considered acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with  existing 
guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, controlled and 
validated. The active substance is well characterised and appropriate specifications are set. The 
manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality  of 
the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. Adventitious agents safety 
including TSE have been sufficiently assured.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Kesimpta is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions  defined in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Physico-chemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Kesimpta is considered approvable from the  quality point of view.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary Pharmacodynamics in vitro 
Ofatumumab is  a fully  human monoclonal IgG1  antibody that  targets  a unique  conformational epitope of  the 
human CD20 molecule, which is expressed on B cells and a subset of CD3+ T cells. This epitope is apparently 
not  targeted by  other CD20 antibodies  such as  rituximab and ocrelizumab. Ofatumumab  binds to  residues in 
the large loop (distal from residues A170 and P172) and  the small extracellular loop of CD20. Ofatumumab is 
developed to be selective to the CD20 molecule and e.g. epitope mapping studies demonstrate mode of binding 
and  efficacy. Staining  in  tissue  cross reactivity studies  was highly  consistent  and  ofatumumab demonstrated 
tissue reactivity in  accordance with its target CD20 antigen specificity. 
Initially,  ofatumumab  was developed for B  cell lymphomas. However due  to  failing  to  penetrate  the  market, 
the product was withdrawn. In this  application, ofatumumab is targeting B cells in MS.  It should be mentioned 
that  targeting  MS  require  a  much  lower  human  dose,  namely  20  mg  SC  at  week  0,  1  and  2,  followed  by 
subsequent  monthly dosing,  starting  at  week 4.  In contrast,  the  dose for the  treatment  of B cell  lymphomas 
was 300-2000  mg per week by IV infusion. 
In in  vitro  primary pharmacology studies, ofatumumab  binds  to CD20-transfected  NS/0  cells but  not  to  their 
non-transfected counterparts. Binding to human B cells occurred with a concentration of a drug that gives half-
maximal response (EC50) of 287 ng/mL  and dissociation from CD20 was very slow with  a koff for ofatumumab 
F(ab’)2  fragments of 6.4 x 10-5 sec-1. 
The mode of action  of ofatumumab was characterised by a range of functional assays using  cell lines of B cell 
tumours and  normal human cells. Ofatumumab appears to  act preferentially through  CDC and partly  through 
ADCC. In the  ADCC assay (RD-2018-00361),  purified NK cells were used as effector cells and human primary 
B cells as target  cells. It  was shown that  after a 14-h incubation  of primary human B cells, the assay resulted 
in similar B cell death for ofatumumab and ocrelizumab, 22% and 28%, respectively and a moderate depletion 
for rituximab (13%). 
The  direct  2-h  CDC  assay  resulted  in  a  potent  depletion  of  primary  human  B  cells  when  treated  with 
ofatumumab (77.7%)  and only a slight depletion when treated with ocrelizumab (7.1%) or rituximab (12.8%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 26/138 
 
 
 
Ofatumumab-mediated CDC was shown  to  be less affected by complement  inhibitor  molecules such  as CD55 
and CD59 compared to rituximab-mediated CDC. 
The  delayed  CDC  demonstrated  a  long-lasting  effect  of  ofatumumab  with  54%  of  depletion  after  6  h  of 
treatment whereas ocrelizumab showed the same lack of activity as an irrelevant antibody, corelating with the 
slow koff of ofatumumab (RD-2018-00361). 
Overall, in vitro proof of concept appears to be established.  
Primary Pharmacodynamics in vivo 
Studies in mice bearing human B cell tumours provide evidence that ofatumumab inhibits B cell tumour growth, 
however these studies do not provide in vivo proof of concept in terms of MS as the  Applicant also states. 
Generally, monoclonal antibodies, administered via SC route, are absorbed via the lymphatic system, although 
several aspects are still  poorly understood (Richter &  Jacobsen, 2014). 
Nonclinical  studies  indicate  that  SC administration  targets  lymphatic  system and brain  to  a higher  degree as 
compared to  IV administration.  This  was  evident  in  experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)  mice 
(an animal model of MS, Migotto,  2019). 
This is of particular relevance since lymph nodes are the site where B cells and T cells interact with  each other 
where B  cells  present cognate  autoantigens  to  T  cell  clones. These  clones expand, migrate  to  the  brain  and 
inflict  damage (Jelcic et  al 2018). 
Two aspects were described by the Applicant depicting differences in the MoA of ofatumumab and ocrelizumab, 
and both B cell-killing agents trough different routes of administration (RoAs) and different doses. The data of 
dead human primary B cells percentage were provided in order to show that ofatumumab, in direct comparison 
to ocrelizumab and rituximab, not only induces complement-induced B cell death with  greater efficacy but also 
is  able  to  induce  strong  CDC  when  complement  addition  takes  place  several  hours  after  the  exposure  to 
ofatumumab. The Applicant credibly explained the superiority of ofatumumab SC RoA in contrast to the IV RoA. 
The discussion  was furthermore substantiated  by evidence collected by Torres et al  (2019)  and  Migotto  et  al 
(2019).  SC anti-CD20 Ab induces a significantly more effective decrease in T cell accumulation in  the brain of 
delayed-type  hypersensitivity  (DTH)  MS  mouse  model  and  accumulation  after  SC  the  injection  is  most 
prominent  in  the  draining  lymph  nodes.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  provided appropriate  data  to  suggest  the 
potent effect on annualized relapse rate (ARR) of low dose ofatumumab in RMS patients. 
A  Novartis  proprietary  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  was  performed  to  evaluate  mechanism  of  action  of 
ofatumumab at clinically relevant dose of 1 mg/kg SC thrice with 1 week in between doses. This was conducted 
by several means, e.g. monitoring  lymphocyte subsets by FACS and morphological and immune  cell changes, 
IMC  or IHC in  axillary lymph  nodes and blood samples, which  were collected at  various time  points  until  Day 
90.  At  Day 21,  IHC  revealed B  cell depletion in  the  perifollicular and  interfollicular area of axillary LNs,  while 
only  the  core of  the  germinal centre  was  depleted  of  CD20+CD21+  cells.  By  Day 62,  the  perifollicular  and 
interfollicular areas were abundantly infiltrated by CD21+ B cells and this distribution  returned to the  baseline 
cytoarchitecture by Day 90. It was concluded that  low dose SC ofatumumab potently depletes both B cells and 
CD20+ T cells but apparently spares marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the spleen and LN. It was further concluded 
that  the  different susceptibility of  B cell subtypes may be linked to the  bioavailability of the antibody  through 
the lymphatic system after SC injection or may be related to the phenotypic makeup in these specific anatomic 
regions. However, overall, reversible decrease in B cells in blood and lymphatic tissues was demonstrated as a 
result of SC administration of ofatumumab, see Figure 2.1.2.1.  Apparently, this study was not supported by PK

sampling,  which  could  have  provided important  quantitative  PK/PD  relationships  to  support  selection  of  the 
human dose.

SC ofatumumab. A: CD20+  B cells. B: CD3+CD20+  T cells. Data  are expressed as means plus/  minus 
standard error of the  mean (RD-2019-00021) 
Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
In  order  to  demonstrate  selectivity  and  species-specific  binding,  immunohistochemical  investigations  were 
performed in human and animal tissues. 
Human tissues alone (CD2008-01311,  GLP compliant) 
Cross reactivity of ofatumumab in human tissues were conducted by immunohistochemical investigations. 
Specific,  positive,  membrane  bound  staining  of  fluorescein  isothiocyanate  conjugated  ofatumumab  was 
recorded in  tissues  belonging  to  the  lymphoid  system, e.g.  lymphocytes of  the  lymph  node, spleen,  thymus 
and tonsil and also in the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue MALT of the small and large intestines. In addition, 
there was  positive membrane bound  staining  of lymphocytes scattered in the  subepithelial  tissues of at  least 
one donor of cervix, endometrium, kidney, prostate, parotid salivary gland, skin, stomach, ureter and urinary 
bladder. There was no staining in  the blood vessels, cerebrum, breast, eye, heart, Fallopian tube, liver, ovary, 
peripheral nerve, pancreas, parathyroid glands, pituitary gland, placenta, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, testis or 
thyroid gland. Ofatumumab demonstrates tissue reactivity that  is consistent with  its target antigen specificity. 
Staining  in  reproductive organs is  consistent with  physiological location of  B-lymphocytes and  does not  point 
to non-specific binding of ofatumumab to reproductive tissues. B-cells are relatively rare in the male and female 
reproductive organs (prostate: Hussein 2009,  uterus: Agostinis 2019).  B cell depletion in reproductive organs 
is not expected to impact reproductive function, lead to increased risk of malignancies or infections as indicated 
by available non-clinical and clinical data. 
Cross reactivity in rhesus, cynomolgus and human tissues (CD2008-001167,  not  GLP) 
Ofatumumab  was  shown  to  bind  to  tonsils  from humans  or  cynomolgus  monkeys and  to  lymph  nodes from 
rhesus monkey. Binding was found  in follicular structures.  Human and cynomolgus CD20 were found to differ 
only by one amino acid in the CD20-second extracellular loop. Binding studies in PBMCs resulted in EC50 values 
of 287, 97 and 139 ng/ml for human, rhesus and cynomolgus PBMCs, respectively. The study supports selecting 
rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys for safety studies. 
Other species (CD2008-01175,  not GLP) 
Assessment report

Ofatumumab was found  not to  cross-react with  cells in  splenic germinal centres from dog,  pig, rabbit,  mouse 
and  rat.  Alignment  of  human  and  monkey  CD20  sequences  with  those  of  mouse,  rat  and  dog  showed  low 
homology  (72  to  74%  homology).  Hence,  nonclinical  studies  in  these  species  appear not  to  be  meaningful, 
when ofatumumab is pharmacologically active in monkeys. 
Safety  Pharmacology 
In  alignment  with  ICH  S6,  safety  pharmacology evaluations were  performed as  part  of  repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. See Table 2.3.1.  hERG-testing was not  included, since ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody and not 
anticipated to elicit  any relevant effect on this ion channel. 
Cardiovascular parameters were monitored in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study. There were no significant 
differences between  baseline  or  between  doses  at  any  occasion.  The  Lead  II  trace  was  evaluated  and  the 
interval data (P-R, QRS and Q-T) and heart rate derived. Measurements were taken twice pre-dose and 30 min 
after completion of dosing and  24 h  after commencement of dosing on each day of dosing (i.e. Days 1, 8,  15 
and 22). A similar setup was performed in the 7 months study with 5 occasions up to Day 190. Again, no signal 
on cardiovascular parameters were observed. Blood pressure was not monitored.  Since the  other parameters 
did not  show any effect of ofatumumab, this  is not  a concern. There were no changes in any of the  urinalysis 
parameters that were considered to be related to treatment  with ofatumumab in the  two studies. 
CNS, renal and respiratory function  was evaluated in  the fertility study  of 13 weeks duration. Six cynomolgus 
monkeys/sex/group were administered control item (vehicle), 10 mg/kg weekly and 3 mg/kg bi-weekly, or 100 
mg/kg weekly and 20  mg/kg bi-weekly. The first  five doses of  test item  were administered weekly (on  study 
days  1,  8,  15,  22  and  29);  then,  doses  were  administered  bi-weekly  (every  other  week)  until  end  of  the 
treatment period (four doses, on study days 43, 57,  71 and 85). 
Respiratory rate  was observed in  non-anesthetized,  temporarily restrained animals once during  the  pre-dose 
phase  and  during  Weeks 1  and  13  of  the  dosing-phase  by  counting  respiratory phases  for  15  seconds  for 
calculation of respiratory frequency (respirations/minute). No change in respiration rate was considered related 
to treatment with  the  test item. 
Animals were observed pre-dose (-11) and on dosing days 2 and 88 for potential neurobehavioral effects using 
a  standard  observation  battery,  which  allowed  the  assessment  of  peripheral  and  central  nervous  systems 
activities.  Methods  were  a  modified  version  of  a  primary  observation test  described  by  Irwin  for  detecting 
neurological and behavioural changes in  mice (Irwin, 1968).  All observations indicated normal behaviour. 
Differences  in  urinalysis  parameters  were  present  between  controls  and  ofatumumab-treated  animals  or 
between pre-dose and dosing phase test results for individual animals. All were consistent with normal variation 
and considered incidental. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  studies  of  pharmacodynamic (PD)  drug  interactions have  been performed. This  is acceptable  considering 
the nature of the product. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of Analysis 
All bioanalytical methods of ofatumumab and antidrug antibodies (ADA) were based on ligand-binding assays. 
Different  platforms  and  approaches were used.  Apparently, bioanalytical  and  ADA methods  were developed 
Assessment report

and  adequately validated.  The Applicant  made  an  exhaustive list  of  studies  with  respective linked validation 
reports with  key validation parameters. Validation reports including analytical methods were submitted.   
The bioanalytical program of the repeat-dose toxicity studies was conducted according to guidelines applicable 
at  the  time  of  conduct  (2004  and  2009).  At  this  time,  incurred  sample  reproducibility  in  GLP  studies  and 
validation  of  bioanalytical  methods  to  be  conducted  under  GLP  compliance  was  not  a  requirement.  Quality 
Assurance statements  of the  repeat-dose toxicity  studies,  document  inspection  of  phases  in  connection  with 
bioanalysis,  such  as  Immunoassay, DMPK  QC  preparation  and  Sample  receipt.  Hence,  the  lack  of  incurred 
sample  reproducibility  testing  (ISR)  and  formal  GLP  compliance  of  the  bioanalytical  program  is  considered 
justified. 
It should be mentioned that  some studies were reported in  ng/mL while other is reported in µg/mL.  However, 
this is solved in  toxicokinetic reporting. 
Absorption 
No  systematic effort  was undertaken  by the  Applicant,  to  quantitatively  determine the  pharmacokinetic (PK) 
parameters describing the  target  mediated drug disposition  elimination  of ofatumumab  after a single dose of 
SC administration. Studies were using different designs of repeat-dosing. Since monkeys may develop antidrug 
antibodies against ofatumumab after approximately 2 weeks, these data may be unreliable. The large variability 
in  one  study  (SC vs IV)  and  N=1  in  the  other  study  (IV  low  doses) make the  data  difficult  to  interpret.  The 
clinical  bioequivalence study  also reveals that  exposure is highly  variable after  SC administration,  see Figure 
3.2.3.  Despite the  suboptimal characterisation of ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in naïve monkeys, it appears 
that  ofatumumab  follows  the  expected  PK  behaviour  of  an  IgG  antibody  in  the  monkey.  Ofatumumab  was 
slowly absorbed after SC administration with time for maximal exposure in the range of 48-120 h. Bioavailability 
was  40%  after  the  second  dose (Day 15)  of 20  mg/kg SC  and  75%  after  the  second  dose (Day  15)  of  100 
mg/kg SC compared to 100  mg/kg IV On Day 1, the bioavailability of 20 mg/kg was 85% (CD2007-01024). 
Toxicokinetics in  e.g.  the  7-month  general toxicity  study  (IV  infusion)  suffers from suboptimal  design  of  the 
study  for  PK  sampling and  development  of  antidrug  antibodies,  hence  PK parameters, as  the  Applicant  also 
states, are somewhat unreliable. Nevertheless, exposure was calculated, and plasma concentrations are much 
higher  than  will  ever  be  achieved  in  MS  patients.  Moreover,  Day  1  data  indicated  that  ofatumumab  PK 
resembled IgG in  the  monkey, see  Table 3.2.2.  Therefore, this  is  not  considered a  concern. There were  not 
observed any consistent  gender differences in  exposure. Exposure was  approximately proportional with  dose 
on Day 1 (between 20 and 100 mg/kg) indicating that at 20 mg/kg target mediated clearance (CL) is saturated 
already after the  first dose.

The  rationale  behind  calculation  of  safety  margins  is  understood,  i.e.  using  AUC0-t  at  steady  state  in  the 
maintenance  phase.  It  is  a  mean  to  be  able  to  directly  compare  exposure at  a  similar  place  in  the  dosing 
regimen between human and monkey exposure. However, the safety margin may not be calculated across the 
timeframe,  where  patients  are  exposed  the  most,  namely  just  after  the  loading  phase.  This  is  considered 
acceptable,  since the  safety  margins  are high  -  exemplified by  a  safety  margin  on  maximum  concentration 
(Cmax) of >2000 in the 7 month repeat-dose toxicity study, see Table 3.2.3.  The recommended dosing regimen 
in  MS  patients  is  20  mg  ofatumumab  administered by  SC  injection  with  initial  dosing  at  weeks  0,  1  and  2, 
followed  by  subsequent  monthly  dosing,  starting  at  week  4  as  used  in  the  bioequivalence study  see  Figure 
3.2.3.

Distribution 
No  conventional  distribution  studies  using  radiolabelled ofatumumab  was  conducted  (e.g.  protein  binding  or 
whole-body autoradiography). This  is  considered acceptable according to  ICHS6(R1).  However, ofatumumab 
potential  for  placental  transfer was  evaluated  in  studies  of  reproduction  toxicity.  In  study  CD2008-01523,  it 
was  shown  that  ofatumumab  was  transferred to  fetus  via umbilical  cord and  that  the  serum concentrations 
were  similar  between  fetus  and  umbilical  cord.  This  is  expected  for  IgG1,  which  is  the  most  efficiently 
transported immunoglobulin across placenta (via the neonatal FcRn receptor). Furthermore, in study 1670033, 
ofatumumab was  observed in  infants up  to  28  days after  the low  dose regimen and up  to  PND91 at  the  high 
dose regimen despite maternal animals were not  dosed after birth of the infant.  However, high  variability was 
observed due to  antidrug antibodies formed in maternal animals. 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies were performed on ofatumumab. Monoclonal antibodies are expected to be metabolised 
in the same manner as endogenous antibodies. This is acceptable according to ICHS6(R1).

Elimination 
Similar to metabolism, modes of excretion are anticipated to be similar to endogenous antibodies (proteolysis 
protected by Fc-Rn  receptor). Studies of excretion is therefore not necessary. 
Pharmacokinetic Drug interactions 
PK drug interactions are not expected for a selective monoclonal antibody. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose Toxicity 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed.  This  is  considered  acceptable,  since  ofatumumab  is 
indicated for low dose (as compared to the previous cancer indication) chronic treatment. 
Repeat-dose  Toxicity 
Three  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  presented.  One  study  using  both  SC  and  IV  administration 
serves as  a  bridging  study  to  the  4-weeks  and  7-months  repeat-dose  studies  using  IV  administration.  One 
study was using  cycled dosing imitating  dosing schedule in  CLL  indication. Two other  studies were presented. 
These served as dose-range finding studies and were not performed in compliance with  GLP. 
2-weeks SC and IV with  8 months recovery (CD2007-01024) 
The bridging study was performed GLP compliant with  a comprehensive audit program under the responsibility 
of GlaxoSmithKline. 
Ofatumumab was given on Day 1 and Day 15 to female cynomolgus monkeys (6/group at 20 or 100 mg/kg/dose 
ofatumumab given SC, 6/group at 100 mg/kg/dose ofatumumab given by IV infusion, 4/group at 0 mg/kg/dose 
given  SC). A  necropsy was  conducted  for half  the  animals  in  each group  on  Day 21;  the  remaining animals 
were necropsied following an approximate 33-week recovery period. 
The  main  finding  in  this  relatively short  study  was  the  depletion  of  CD20+  B  cells,  which  is  the  intended 
pharmacological effect.  See Table  4.2.2.  This  was  correlated by  a  similar  decrease in  CD40+  B  cells.  Both 
subsets increased during recovery, i.e. on Day 250,  absolute CD20+ cell numbers were approximately 0.5X of 
baseline levels at  100  mg/kg given SC  or 100  mg/kg  given IV. The rate  of recovery was dependent  on  dose 
and  route  of  administration  with  100  mg/kg  IV  providing  the  longest  time  to  recovery of  B  cell  counts  in 
peripheral blood illustrating  that  SC administration  does  not  provide 100%  bioavailability in  that  sense. This 
could  be different  if  looking for B  cells in  lymphatic  target  organ tissues.  However, this  was  not  done  in  this 
study.  Classical end points  of clinical  observations, body weights,  clinical  pathology, macro- and  microscopic 
observations did  not  reveal any  significant  findings.  The  highest  dose  was selected  as  No  observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL). This is agreed. Anti-ofatumumab antibodies, detected in 4 ofatumumab-treated monkeys, 
corresponded with  reduced ofatumumab  plasma concentrations and  accelerated B cell-recovery. On  Day 15, 
mean systemic exposure at 100 mg/kg/dose (based on AUC0-t and Cmax, respectively) was 274 mg x h/mL and 
1.51  mg/mL  (SC) or 392  mg x h/mL  and  3.27  mg/mL (IV infusion)  providing a safety margin of  at least  570 
on AUC0-t (Table 3.2.3).

4-weeks IV with 6  months recovery (CD2008/01520) 
This study was sponsored by Genmab and appeared fully GLP compliant. 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  toxicity  of  ofatumumab  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys following  4, 
weekly IV administrations  (i.e. Days 1,  8,  15  and 22)  and then  during  a 6-month  recovery period monitor B 
cell  recovery in  the  blood  and  lymph  nodes of  designated  animals. The  study  was  including  both  males and 
females with  3  in  each  of  the  main  study  groups  and  2  in  the  recovery groups  of  the  control,  20  and  100 
mg/kg/week dose groups. Apart from classical core end points,  humoral immune function was assessed using 
immunisation with KLH and lymph node biopsies were also taken for flow cytometry investigations at least once 
pretrial  from  all  animals  and  from  the  recovery animals  throughout  the  dosing  and  recovery periods.  On 
completion of the 2-week post dose observation period or 6month recovery period, as appropriate, the animals 
were sacrificed and subjected to a detailed necropsy. 
Organs/tissues were subjected to organ weight analysis and histological evaluation. Selected tissues were also 
stained and evaluated for immunohistochemistry investigations. 
For most  end-points,  there were no  difference between dose-groups. However, the  following findings  (I - III) 
were observed to be significantly different from control group. 
I:  Similar  to  study  CD2007-01024,  B  cell  count  was  reversibly reduced  in  both  peripheral blood  and  lymph 
nodes in  active dose-groups.  
II: For humoral immune function,  there was evidence of inhibition of specific KLH antibodies for the high  dose 
of 100 mg/kg/week.  
III: Histologically,  treatment with  ofatumumab at  dose levels of 20  and 100  mg/kg/week was associated with 
minimal  to  moderate germinal  centre  or  follicular  atrophy  in  the  mandibular  and  mesenteric  lymph  nodes, 
Peyer’s  patch  and  spleen  of  the  main  study  animals.  Recovery animals  showed  partial  recovery  to  these 
findings. 
The highest  dose was  selected as  NOAEL.  This is  agreed. A  strong anti-drug  antibody  (ADA) response with  a 
large degree of variation following administration of ofatumumab was detected in 3/12 animals in Group 2 (20 
mg/kg/day)  and  2/12  animals  in  Group  3  (100  mg/kg/day).  Exposure was,  nevertheless, overall high,  and 
provided safety margins to human exposure of >830, see Table 3.2.3.

7-months  IV with  6 months recovery (CD2008/01521) 
This study was also sponsored by Genmab and appeared fully GLP compliant. 
The objectives of this study were to assess the toxicity of ofatumumab in cynomolgus monkeys following 13 IV 
administrations over a 7-month  period (i.e. Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 78, 106, 134, 162 and 190) and 
a 6-month recovery period. Male and female cynomolgus monkeys were assigned to  3 dose groups (3 animals 
in the main study and 4 animals for recovery per group) in which ofatumumab was administered at dose levels 
of 0, 20 and 100 mg/kg/dose. This study design (e.g. weekly dosing in the initiating  phase, and once a month 
after  the  first  8  dose  administrations)  is  similar  to  the  treatment  schedule  of  MS,  however at  much  higher 
exposure/doses. End points  to be monitored were similar to study CD2008/01520. 
Probably  as  a  consequence  of  the  long  duration  of  this  study,  mortality  was  observed.  Mortality  was  not 
considered directly related to  the  treatment with  ofatumumab, but  more likely secondary to  i:  lethal immune 
reaction  to  the  human  protein  leading  to  anaemia  and/or  immune-complex  related  disease  or  ii:  higher 
susceptibility to common infections (e.g. C. jejuni) among cynomolgus monkeys. The observed mortalities are 
not considered clinically relevant, as they are already known risks of treatment with antibodies against B cells. 
Similar to other studies, B cell counts in peripheral blood and lymph nodes was completely depleted during the 
treatment  period and reversed to  normal during the  recovery period. The  duration of  cell depletion was  dose 
dependent  and produced a  rebound effect upon  its  recovery. Subsets  of B  cells were monitored  and showed 
that  some  subsets  were  more  resistant  to  depletion  than  others.  The  apparent  differentiated  depletion  of 
memory (small  fraction  –  less  efficient  depletion)  and  non-memory B  cells  (more abundant-  more  efficient 
depletion)  in  the  non-clinical  studies  appear  not  to  be  clinically  relevant,  since  in  patients  on  continuous 
treatment of ofatumumab both types of B cells were efficiently depleted and protected from relapse of MS.  
The  immunisation  of  animals  in  the  three  dose  groups  with  keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  (KLH)  resulted  in 
detectable immune  responses generated over the course of  the  study. A  dose dependent inhibitory  effect on 
the IgG humoral immune response was apparent at Day 18 in the 20  mg/kg dose group and 100  mg/kg dose 
group main study animals. This effect appeared not to be fully reversible in the recovery animals. 
As  expected  from  the  intended  pharmacological  effect, lymphoid  atrophy  in  submandibular  and  mesenteric 
lymph nodes, Peyer’s patch and spleen was observed. Other findings included thymic atrophy, extramedullary 
hematopoiesis in  the  liver,  inflammation  in  the  kidneys  and  perivascular inflammatory  cell  infiltration  in  the 
brain  and sciatic  nerve. For  one  Group 3  male  recovery animal, mild  thymic  atrophy  was  noted.  The animal 
also  had  mild  multifocal  interstitial  nephritis.  All  these  findings  were ascribed  to  a  progressive formation  of 
immune  complexes  leading  to  organ  inflammation  and  anemia.  This  conclusion  is  supported.  Mortality  was 
evenly  distributed  across  the  two-active  dose-groups.  NOAEL  was  set  to  the  highest  dose.  This  appears 
acceptable, since most of the adverse findings could be attributed to the pharmacology of ofatumumab, species 
specific infections, or the reaction to  treatment with  an antibody  from a different species (human). For  safety 
margins to clinically relevant exposure, see Table 3.2.3. 
Apparently, the  incidence of ADA was low  in this  study  except for one animal,  which  was found dead on  Day 
44 (probably due to general organ failure). The apparently inconsistent ADA response in monkeys treated with 
ofatumumab could  be due  to high  amount  of ofatumumab  in  ADA serum samples masking true  ADA positive 
results in  the  ADA assays. This  correlates with  the fact  that  in  only one female monkey, ADA was  confirmed. 
This  monkey most  likely died of  immune complex disease and also had  lower concentrations  of ofatumumab 
probably due to neutralising antidrug antibodies. More focused assays directed towards red blood cells namely 
the  Direct  Coomb’s test  and stripping  of  ofatumumab bound  to  red blood  cells  was more  in  correlation  with

findings  of  anaemia and  other  symptoms of immune  complex disease such as  vasculitis and  inflammation  in 
organs.   
Cycled dosing IV with  4 months  recovery (CD2008-01522) 
This study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline and appeared fully GLP compliant. 
The  objective of  this  study  was  to  aid the  assessment of  the  systemic  toxic  potential  of  ofatumumab  in  the 
cynomolgus monkey following  two cycles of IV administration,  each cycle consisting of two IV administrations 
(30  min  infusion)  of  ofatumumab  given two  weeks apart. Three groups  of  3  male and  3  female cynomolgus 
monkeys received ofatumumab at dose levels of 0,  20 or 100  mg/kg on Days 1, 15,  148 and 162. 
Anti-drug antibodies were detected in 15 out of 24  treated HuMax-CD20 animals (9 out of 12  at 20 mg/kg and 
6 out of 12 at  100 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetics may have been affected by the  presence of ADAs. 
The main finding in this study, apart from decrease in B cell counts, was low grade anaemia, which was probably 
the cause of some of the mortalities and adverse findings in the 7 months study. Several clinical chemistry and 
pathology findings  reflected low  grade anaemia, namely low  haemoglobin concentrations, erythrocyte counts 
and haematocrits and high reticulocytes, iron and total bilirubin. The increase in reticulocytes in the blood may 
suggest  marrow regeneration due to  a  loss of peripheral erythrocytes. These findings  were not  correlated to 
any histopathological  findings. 
Moreover, as in  the  7  months  study,  histopathological  examinations revealed germinal centre atrophy  in  the 
spleen and tonsils  as well as in mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes.  
The  mean  values  of  B  cell  depletion  showed  lower  numbers  and  increased  time  to  repletion  in  females as 
compared to  males are driven by 3/6  females in  the  cycled study  and 1/6  females in  the  chronic study.  The 
other  females showed  B  cell  data  similar  to  males.  This  could  be  interpreted  as  individual  female  animals 
showing  longer  ofatumumab  exposure  for  the  3  females  in  the  cycled  study  or  being  more  sensitive  to 
ofatumumab  than  others  for  the  one  female  in  the  chronic  study.  However, if  this  is  a  real effect,  it  is  not 
clinically relevant, as there are no clinically meaningful imbalances within  each of the  sub-groups of male and 
female patients on efficacy endpoints and AE profiles. 
The  highest  dose  was  considered  to  be  NOAEL.  This  is  supported.  See  Table  3.2.3.  for  safety  margin  on 
exposure. 
Toxicokinetics 
Ofatumumab in control and pretrial samples 
In study  CD2007-01024,  no ofatumumab  was detected above LOQ.  In  study  CD2008-01520,  CD2008-01522 
and  CD2008-01521,  a  few  samples from  control  group and  pretrial  samples in  the  active dose  groups  were 
positive for ofatumumab, however at very low  levels, not considered to elicit any pharmacological effect or to 
impact the conclusions of the studies. 
For discussion of toxicokinetics in general, See section 3.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics/Absorption. 
Genotoxicity 
According to guidelines, no studies of the genotoxic potential of ofatumumab were performed. This is justified, 
since  monoclonal  antibodies  are  not  expected  to  interact  with  DNA  and  ofatumumab  is  not  modified  with 
unnatural amino acids or linkers etc. 
Assessment report

Carcinogenicity 
Due  to  the  mechanism  of  action,  i.e.  immunosuppression,  tumour  promoting  effects  cannot  be  ruled  out. 
However, since ofatumumab is not pharmacologically active in rodents, conduct of conventional carcinogenicity 
studies  is  not  feasible.  A  justification  for  not  conducting  such  studies  were  given  by  a  weight  of  evidence 
approach. The justification is considered acceptable based on the following statements: 
i: At doses up to 100 mg/kg in monkeys for 7 months duration, there was no evidence of increased carcinogenic 
risk. 
ii: There are no identified concerns for genotoxic or carcinogenic potential  for ofatumumab. 
iii:  While certain  B cell subsets may play a role in  the complex immune surveillance environment, the weight 
of evidence in  the  literature  does not  suggest that  B cell  depletion plays  a driving  force in  tumour  formation 
and promotion. 
iiii:  Extensive  clinical  data  for similar  CD20  targeting  agents  already exists,  where rituximab  appears  to  not 
increase risk of malignance, however for ocrelizumab, the risk cannot be ruled out. 
Reproductive and developmental  toxicity 
Fertility  and early embryonic development 
The fertility study was sponsored by Novartis and conducted according to GLP (1670402). 
Groups of 6  animals/sex were given ofatumumab  at 10/3  mg/kg, and  100/20  mg/kg.  The initial  dose (10  or 
100  mg/kg) was given weekly for 5  weeks (on  Days 1,  8, 15,  22  and 29)  followed by a maintenance dose (3 
or  20  mg/kg)  given  once  every  2  weeks  (four  administrations,  on  Days  43,  57,  71  and  85).  A  further  6 
animals/sex were similarly dosed with  the  vehicle alone. Four animals/sex/group were necropsied on Day 92. 
The remaining animals were retained for a  further 8-week observation period, prior to  necropsy on  Day 148. 
Core  end  points  were  evaluated  as  well  as  safety  pharmacology end  points,  see  section  2.3.  Male  fertility 
endpoints  were the  results  of  testicular and  semen evaluation.  Female fertility  endpoints  were the  results of 
the  menstrual  cycle  monitoring  and  ovarian/uterine  maturation  stage.  The  only  noteworthy  findings  were 
expected pharmacological effects.  Immunophenotyping  revealed the  expected depletion  of  CD20+  cells  and 
immune-histochemistry  showed  depletion  of  CD20+  and  CD3+  cells in  lymphoid  tissues.  Only  the  low  dose 
showed  evidence of  recovery. Despite incidence of  ADAs in  a 5/12  animals in  the  low  dose  group leading  to 
lower  than  expected  decrease  in  B  cells  and  decreased  exposure,  the  conclusions  of  the  study  were  not 
impacted as this was not observed in the high dose group. No effects on fertility were noted. Hence the highest 
does was selected as NOAEL.  In terms of exposure, the safety margin to clinically relevant exposure (AUC) is 
at least 340, see Table 3.2.3. 
Embryofoetal development 
The  embryofoetal  development  study  was  sponsored  by  GlaxoSmithKline  and  conducted  according  to  GLP 
(CD2008-01523). 
Ofatumumab was administered IV (30 minutes)  to cynomolgus monkeys from day 20  to 50  of gestation at  0, 
20  or 100  mg/kg.  The animals received weekly administrations,  i.e. a  total  of 5  administrations.  The fetuses 
were delivered via  caesarean section  for  necropsy on  Day 100±1  of  gestation.  The  study  included  core end 
points for dams including lymphocytes subsets and ADAs. Litters were evaluated for implantations, resorptions, 
live  and  dead  fetuses,  fetal  weight,  sex,  splenic  lymphocyte  subset  counts,  placental  and  fetal  morphology 
(external visceral and skeletal), and selected organ weights  and histology.  Furthermore, fetal cord blood was

collected  for  ofatumumab  concentration  measurements,  anti-drug  antibody  analysis and  lymphocyte  subset 
counts. 
There was no impact on pregnancy outcomes and no findings of malformations or variations in litters. The only 
finding  was  a  dose-related decrease in  spleen weight,  however with  no  microscopic correlates. As  expected, 
depletion of B cells was observed in both  dams (blood) and litters (both  blood and spleen). 
Antibodies against ofatumumab was observed in a few dams and also in their litters as well. Both ofatumumab 
and  ADAs were  detected in  umbilical  cord samples  at  Day 100.  See Table 3.3.1.  This is  expected, since  IgG 
readily passes the placenta barrier. 
Table 4. Serum concentrations of ofatumumab in cord blood samples at GD100 (CD2008-01523) 
NOAEL was selected as the high dose of 100 mg/kg/week. This is supported. Safety margin to clinically relevant 
exposure was 1300,  see Table 3.2.3. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
The ePPND study was sponsored by Novartis and conducted according to GLP (1670402). 
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ofatumumab on pregnancy, parturition and lactation, 
and on pre- and postnatal  survival, growth and development of the F1  offspring for six months  when given by 
IV infusion  to  pregnant  monkeys from Gestation  Day (GD)  20  until  parturition.  The control  item  (vehicle) or 
ofatumumab  was  administered IV (30  min  infusion)  at  0,  10/3  mg/kg,  and  100/20  mg/kg  from  GD 20  until 
parturition (N=14).  The initial  dose (0, 10 or 100 mg/kg) was given weekly for 5 weeks (on GD 20, 27, 34, 41, 
and 48),  followed by a maintenance dose (0, 3  or 20  mg/kg) given once every 2  weeks from GD 62 onwards 
(on GD 62, 76, 90, 104, 118, 132, 146, and 160). After birth of the infants, ofatumumab treatment was stopped 
and the maternal animals and infants were kept for a 6-month observation period prior to necropsy on LD/PND 
180±1. 
Maternal  animals  were  evaluated  for  core  end  points.  Infants  were  evaluated  for  core  end  points  and 
neurobehavioral test battery, testing  of grip strength,  skeletal and bone mineral assessment as well as T-cell-
dependent antibody response (TDAR). 
There was no  mortality  directly attributed  to  ofatumumab.  However, one maternal animal  was euthanised  in 
moribund  condition  probably  due  to  severe  immune  reaction  towards  ofatumumab  and  3  infants  likewise 
probably due to infections, which  could be secondary to impaired immune defence system. 
In surviving infants,  the  only  difference from control  group on  core end  points  was the  expected decrease in 
CD20+  B cells.  ADAs were  present in  some monkeys especially in  the  low  dose. This  correlated with  normal 
levels of CD20+ B cells and low exposure of ofatumumab.

The  high  dose  differentiated  from the  low  dose and  control  group  on  immune-toxicological  parameters. IgG 
levels were reduced on PND 70, and reduced IgG and IgM was observed at PND 91 after the first KLH challenge. 
The low dose was comparable to the control group on these parameters. 
Overall,  exposure to  ofatumumab  during  gestation  caused  no  maternal  toxicity  and  no  adverse  effects  on 
pre/post-natal development. 
NOAEL  was determined as the  low dose based on the  mortality most likely due to impaired immune response 
in infants at the high dose. This is supported. Using maternal steady state exposure at the low dose at GD146, 
the  safety  margin  was  22  to  clinically  relevant  exposure  based  on  AUC0-t.  At  PND28,  the  mean  plasma 
concentration  was  1.15  µg/mL  in  infants  of  the  low  dose group  (NOAEL),  comparable to  clinical  Cmax of  1.4 
µg/mL. 
Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance was evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.  Apparently, ofatumumab was well tolerated 
in the nonclinical studies. 
Other  toxicity studies 
The submission of two studies of mechanistic character is appreciated. One study compared ofatumumab with 
another  clone  in  a  single  dose  in  vivo  study.  Both  clones  were  well  tolerated  and  showed  the  expected 
pharmacological effect. 
The other study was investigating biomarkers of the so-called cytokine release syndrome after single IV dosing 
of 25-100  mg/kg ofatumumab.  Activated complement components (C3b/c,  C4b/c),  cytokines (interleukin-6), 
thrombin-anti-thrombin  III complex and plasma-anti-plasma complex increased as a  sign of  cytokine release 
syndrome, however of  limited  severity. In  general, IV administration  to monkeys was associated with  a mild 
and transient increase in  circulating inflammatory and coagulation parameters without  clinical manifestations. 
Clinical  studies are not  reporting  any such  reactions; hence this  phenomenon appear to  be  of limited  clinical 
relevance for MS patients. 
Antigenicity 
An  ADA  response  against  ofatumumab  was  detected  in  approx.  40%  of  all  ofatumumab-treated  monkeys 
following  IV and  SC  dosing.  At  low  doses  of  ofatumumab,  the  presence of  ADAs led  to  decreased systemic 
ofatumumab exposure and a  subsequent abrogation  of the  pharmacological activity  in  some monkeys, along 
with  accelerated circulating B  cell recovery. Immunogenicity to ofatumumab  occasionally resulted in  immune 
complex-mediated hypersensitivity in  a few monkeys causing acute hypersensitivity reactions, a reduced RBC 
mass,  and/or  vascular/perivascular  inflammation  in  tissues.  Being  a  human  antibody,  ofatumumab  is 
considered  to  be  relatively  non-immunogenic  in  humans.  It  is  generally  accepted  that  the  immunogenic 
response in non-human primates is poorly predictive of the response in humans. 
In  the  chronic  study,  some of  the  Coomb’s  test  positive  animals also  showed perivascular inflammatory cell 
infiltration  in the  brain, sciatic nerve, and/or kidneys or vasculitis in the  brain and liver, further supporting an 
immunogenic response in these monkeys. Perivascular and/or vascular inflammation was shown to be the most 
common histologic change attributed  to immune complex disease. Some patients treated with ofatumumab in 
clinical  trials  showed  ADA response. However,  the  totality  of  the  clinical  observations data  from  the  clinical 
trials  and  previous  clinical  experience with  ofatumumab  in  oncology  settings  at  very  high  doses  of  2000 
mg/week did not  reveal any safety concern for the  risk of autoimmune conditions  or type III hypersensitivity

Page 39/138 
 
 
 
reactions in  the patients  with  ADA. The animal findings  are generally not  adequate to assess hypersensitivity 
reactions thus  it is considered appropriate to  review patients’ data.  
Immunotoxicity 
Immunosuppression  (B  cell  depletion)  is  the  pharmacological  effect  of  ofatumumab.  Therefore,  it  is  not 
surprising  that  adverse findings  regarding  immunosuppression  would  be  found  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies.  It  appears  that  adult  monkeys  were  not  overly  sensitive  to  the  immunosuppressive  effect  of 
ofatumumab,  although  a  few incidences  of fatal C.  jejuni infection  occurred. Whether  these  cases were as a 
result  of  treatment  or  incidental  remains  equivocal, since  they  occurred  only  in  active  dose-groups. In  the 
ePPND study, three infants were deemed lost due to fatal, non-specified, infections as deemed from macro and 
microscopic pathological evaluation. These deaths drove the selection of NOAEL  to the  low dose in this  study. 
It is  common knowledge that  antibodies targeting  CD20+ B cell will lead to  higher susceptibility to  infections. 
Upper respiratory tract infections were slightly higher (39.4%) in the ofatumumab treated patients as compared 
to  teriflunomide  (37.8%)  treated  patients  in  the  active  control  group.  However,  teriflunomide  is  also  an 
immunomodulatory  drug.  In  the  Phase  III  pivotal  clinical  studies,  51.6%  of  ofatumumab-treated  patients 
experienced at  least  one infection,  compared to  52.7%  of teriflunomide  treated  patients  (SmPC). The  SmPC 
provides warnings of infections  in  general, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)  and hepatitis  B 
(HBV) reactivation in section 4.4. It  should be mentioned that even if the duration of action of ofatumumab is 
long  lasting,  the  effect  is  eventually  reversible, and  the  depletion  of  B  cells  is  transient  and  will  recover if 
treatment  is stopped.  Moreover, nonclinical  evidence as  presented in  this  report,  suggest that  only  CD20+ B 
cells are targeted by ofatumumab, hence e.g. the population of NK-cell and T-cells and other immune defence 
systems should remain intact. 
Impurities 
No  further  nonclinical  studies  should  be  required  for  qualification  of  impurities.  It  appears  that  that  the 
immunogenic potential  of ofatumumab in monkeys (incidence of ADAs) have been reasonably stable over the 
years of nonclinical development. This can be seen as a result of a relatively stable purity of the product. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Considering  the  nature  of  ofatumumab  being  a  human  protein,  it  is  not  expected  to  be  stable  or  remain 
biologically  active  in  the  environment  and  it  is  unlikely  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  environment.    Moreover,  the 
excipients in the product are not expected to be of any risk either. The absence of any ERA studies is therefore 
acceptable, and in line with  the current guidance. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Ofatumumab is  a fully  human monoclonal IgG1  antibody that  targets  a unique  conformational epitope of  the 
human CD20  molecule, which  is expressed on B cells and  a subset of CD3+ T  cells. Binding to  human B cells 
was potent and the off-rate slow. Functional  in vitro proof of concept appears well-established.  
No  dedicated  nonclinical  in  vivo studies  were  presented  for  the  MS  indication,  however  PK/PD and  toxicity 
studies  in monkeys showed consistent  depletion of  B cells and mechanism of  action was  investigated by e.g. 
monitoring lymphocyte subsets by FACS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 40/138 
 
 
 
Furthermore,  a published  study  in  humanised mice  investigated the  distribution  and  efficacy of ofatumumab 
after IV and SC administration.   
Ofatumumab  showed  a  slightly  different  in  vitro  pharmacology  profile  compared  to  ocrelizumab.  In  direct 
comparison to ocrelizumab and rituximab, ofatumumab not only induces complement-induced B cell death with 
greater efficacy but  also  is  able to  induce  strong  CDC when  complement  addition  takes place  several hours 
after the exposure to ofatumumab.   
Cross reactivity studies showed that ofatumumab binds in the expected lymphoid tissues and organs in humans 
and monkeys,  
Safety  pharmacology  evaluation  of  potential  effects  on  cardiovascular,  respiratory  and  CNS  systems  was 
conducted in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. No significant  changes to control groups were observed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis and toxicokinetics was performed for all pivotal toxicity studies.  
Pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab appeared to be as expected for a human monoclonal antibody administered 
to  monkeys.  All  pivotal  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  using  IV  administration  in  support  of  a  previous 
indication  (CLL).  SC  administration  was  investigated  in  one  bridging  study  using  similar  dose  levels. 
Bioavailability  was  generally high,  although  variable  as  was  also  observed  in  a  clinical  bio-similarity  study 
comparing  a  prefilled  syringe  with  an  autoinjector.  Otherwise  toxicokinetics  appeared  sufficient  and  safety 
margins very high in support of the low dose of ofatumumab in treatment of MS. 
Ofatumumab is transferred from the mother to the  foetus via the umbilical cord. This was shown in the ePPND 
study  and is  expected for an IgG-type monoclonal antibody.  Ofatumumab  was detected in  infants  after  birth 
and the duration of exposure was dose-dependent. Hence, depletion of B cells can be expected in foetuses and 
infants of mothers in treatment with  ofatumumab. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Mechanisms of metabolism and elimination were not  investigated. This is acceptable considering the nature of 
the product. 
Toxicology 
Ofatumumab  was  in  general  well  tolerated  in  repeat-dose  toxicity.  However,  in  the  study  of  the  longest 
duration,  namely  the  7-months  study,  mortality  was  observed. Ofatumumab  was not  considered to  a  direct 
cause of mortality  and were within  the  frame of already known  risks of B  cell depletion  in  patients.  Mortality 
appeared to be due to lethal immune reaction to a human antibody or increased susceptibility to already known 
infections among cynomolgus monkeys.  
Macroscopic and microscopic findings were typically lymphoid  atrophy, which  is an  expected pharmacological 
effect. Inflammation in various organs and perivascular spaces appeared to be due to progressive formation of 
immune complexes. This is also a typical finding  in monkeys treated with  human antibodies. 
In  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  immune  cell  populations  were  monitored.  The  apparent  differentiated 
depletion of memory (small fraction – less efficient depletion) and non-memory B cells (more abundant-  more 
efficient depletion) in the non-clinical studies appear not to be clinically relevant, since in patients on continuous 
treatment  of  ofatumumab  both  types  of  B cells  were  efficiently depleted  and  protected  from  relapse of  MS. 
Abundance of CD8+ T cells were not impacted by ofatumumab treatment.  
Moreover, across studies, individual female monkeys appeared to have longer ofatumumab exposure or being 
more sensitive to ofatumumab effects than others. Clinical data suggest that this is not clinically relevant either.

A full reproductive and developmental toxicity program was presented. Ofatumumab did not show any adverse 
effects in terms of reproduction as such. However, in the ePPND study 3  infants died of unspecified infections 
in the high dose group. These deaths were considered secondary to the pharmacological effect of ofatumumab 
(impaired  immune  defence). The  high  dose  also showed  decreased T-cell-dependent  antibody  response and 
reduced response to  the  first  KLH  challenge. Therefore, NOAEL  was  set  to  the  low  dose. Maternal  exposure 
provided a safety margin of 22  to human clinical exposure. Infants of the low  dose showed exposure at levels 
similar to clinically relevant exposure. 
Ofatumumab was  moderately antigenic  in  the  monkeys, which  was expected. This  is not  generally predictive 
of antigenicity in the  clinical setting.   However, in the chronic study, some of the animals showed perivascular 
inflammatory  cell  infiltration  in  the  brain,  sciatic  nerve, and/or  kidneys or  vasculitis  in  the  brain  and  liver, 
further  supporting  an  immunogenic  response  in  these  monkeys.  Nonetheless,  the  totality  of  clinical 
observations has not revealed any safety concern for autoimmune or hypersensitivity reactions in patients with 
ADA. 
Ofatumumab  is  an  immunosuppressant (B  cell  depletion).  The  B cell  depletion  is  long  lasting  but  eventually 
reversible.  The  SmPC  provides  warnings  of  increased  risk  of  progressive  leukoencephalopathy  and  HBV 
reactivation. These warnings are included as class effects as cases have been observed in patients treated with 
other monoclonal antibodies targeting B cells.

From a non-clinical point of view, Kesimpta can be recommended for marketing authorisation. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
A routine EMA GCP inspection has been adopted, three sites have been selected for inspection: an investigator 
site in Poland, one in  Russia and the CRO ICON in  Ireland. 
Following up with the discussion with the inspectors, considering the current COVID-19 situation and the safety 
and travel restrictions, and the related impact on the deadline for the IIR a cancellation of the routine inspection 
has been recommended.

Analytical methods 
The  methods  for  the  determination  of  ofatumumab  in  human  plasma  have  been  validated.  Methods  for 
determination of anti-ofatumumab antibodies have been described and validated.  
•  Modelling 
The  PK  of  ofatumumab  in  patients  with  RMS  has  been  evaluated  based on  data  from  studies  OMS115102, 
OMS112831,  G2301,  G2302  and  G2102.  Both  conventional  non-compartmental  and  model-based  analyses 
were used. 
 Two PK/PD Modelling Reports are considered as the  main studies:  
1. Population pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab in relapsing multiple sclerosis patients.  
2.  Exploratory  analyses  of the  relationship between  ofatumumab  dose  regimen,  peripheral  blood 
CD19+ B-cell  count and MRI  lesions in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. 
The  Applicant  has  presented  PoP-PK (population  PK)/PD models  in  the  target  populations.  The  models  are 
overall presented, developed and validated in accordance with the existing the EMA Guideline on reporting the 
results of population pharmacokinetic analyses (Doc.ref. CHMP/EWP/185990/06,  June 2007).   
The  POP  PK  analysis  (Population  pharmacokinetics  of  ofatumumab  in  relapsing  multiple  sclerosis 
patients  Modelling  Report)  suggested  a  quasi-steady  state  approximation  of  the  target  mediated  drug-
disposition  model  with  two  PK  compartments  and  a  first  order process for  the  SC  administration.  After  the 
loading phase, ofatumumab concentrations decreased to a minimum  and then  increased to steady state after 
2 years (fig. 5-18 below). This was captured in the model by a time-dependent effect on the receptor synthesis 
rate. The covariates that were selected in the  final model (table  5-11 and 5-17  below) included weight  effects 
on the absorption rate, CL, intercompartmental CL, central volume, complex elimination rate constant and the 
baseline  receptor  synthesis  rate,  a  sex  effect  on  bioavailability,  an  AI  effect  on  complex  elimination  rate 
constant, and an IV formulation effect on baseline receptor synthesis rate. The covariates anti-drug antibodies, 
age, race and baseline B-cell count  were found not to be related to any of the PK parameters. 
Weight is the  covariate with the main effect on drug exposure.

The majority of  the  data came from patients  given the  phase 3  dosing regimen of  3 weekly loading doses of 
20 mg followed by 20 mg given every 4 weeks starting from day 28, corresponding to 1196 patients with 7874 
observed concentrations. Dose ranging information came from the IV study OMS115102 and the phase 2 study 
OMS112831.  While OMS112831  provided 650  observations from 219  patients  administered  doses between  3 
and 60 mg, 70.9%  of the observations were BLOQ. This meant that  most of the rich PK data with  dose ranging 
information came from study OMS115102, although at doses higher than are possibly relevant for RMS patients.  
Modelling  Report:  ”Exploratory analyses  of  the  relationship  between  ofatumumab  dose  regimen, 
peripheral  blood  CD19+  B-cell  count  and  MRI  lesions  in  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis 
patients”:  From the OMS112831  study data, the Applicant prospectively explored the performance of a novel 
phase 3 regimen in attaining  B-cell depletion (i.e., 20 mg loading on weeks 0, 1, and 2 followed by 20mg every 
four  weeks [Q4W]).  The  Applicant states  that  the  majority of  PK measurements were below  LLQ,  so  a  K-PD 
modelling approach with  a virtual  PK compartment was used  to perform a population  analysis of  B-cell count 
dynamics. The Applicant should further clarify and also justify the  use of a virtual PK compartment in regards 
of the validity of the  presented PD model. 
Presence of lesion activity at  screening was associated with  increased new  GdE cumulative lesion volumes by 
week 24 and related to the mean CD19+ B-cells count (from weeks 4 to 20). The largest reduction in the new 
GdE cumulative lesion volumes was observed when the  B-cell count was  ≤8 cells/μL. Based on these results, 
a B-cell count  of 8cells/μL was  proposed as a target level in order to achieve low new GdE  lesion counts and 
new GdE cumulative lesion volumes, which  is accepted.

Study OMS112831  (phase  2 study) 
This  study  provided seminal data  to  inform  on  the  optimal  dosage regimen  in  RRMS  that  was  utilized  in  the 
Phase III studies (see dose response study in section 3.2). 
Patients were randomized to one of the following  8 treatment arms: 
Table 6 
Trough  PK samples were collected at  every SC infusion  as well  as  at  Week 24.  PK parameters estimated for 
each of the  above dosage regimen were: Cmax, AUC0-t and Tmax. PD endpoints included B-cell depletion and 
repletion,  measured  by  CD19+  and  CD20+  cell  counts.  PK/PD  evaluations,  although  planned,  were  not 
performed due to  sparse PK samples. 
Due to relatively high  limit  of quantification  (100 ng/mL),  the  majority of PK samples were available from the 
60  mg every 4-week dosing group, which  included 58  patients.  Therefore, the PK analysis included data from 
this  group  in majority.  Available PK data  across the dosing  groups indicate  increasing plasma concentrations 
with  increasing doses (Figure  2-11, below).

Figure 5 
Considering the  lack of  PK data  concerning other  than  60  mg  Q4 doses  and the  scanty PK  parameters after 
administration of ofatumumab presented data do not allow for their direct reference to lower doses. However, 
PK data  after administration  of 3,  30  and  60  mg allowed the  characterisation of  the PK  across different  dose 
levels and the result from the study was included in the popPK analysis.  
Study 2301 and 2302 (phase  3 studies) 
Pivotal PK parameters like Cmax and AUC are not available for the chosen dosing regimen, as only trough values 
were  measured.  The  bioequivalence  study  (COMB157G2102),  provided  rich  PK  information  from  the  284 
participating  patients  and  combined  results  from  these studies  and  from two  phase  II studies  were  used  to 
develop a PKPD model.  
Ofatumumab  concentrations  were  observed  to  increase  during  the  loading  regimen,  and  exposure  was 
subsequently  maintained  at  a  concentration  level  sufficient  to  suppress  B-cells  (Table  2-1  and  Table  2-2, 
below).  In  study  OMS112831,  patients  were randomised to  8  treatment  arms. The  highest  dose was  60  mg 
ofatumumab  every  4th  week.  Due  to  relatively  high  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLQ)  of  100  ng/ml,  the 
majority of pk samples were available for this dose, and not for the  lower doses, and this  dose was therefore 
used for pk analysis. An accumulation ratio of 1.75  was demonstrated (12  week compared 24 week).  
Assessment report

Data from the  phase 3 studies  shows a median  ofatumumab concentration of  300-1100  ng/ml  from month  1 
to month  24 with  an accumulation factor of ~3 fold from month  3 (after the loading phase) to  month 24.  The 
accumulation  of  ofatumumab  is  considered  caused  by  a  reduced  degradation  of  ofatumumab  due  to  the 
depletion  of  B-cells.  The  plasma  concentration  of  ofatumumab  in  the  phase  3  studies  does  not  exceed the 
concentration, when ofatumumab is administered as 700  mg iv. There is no evidence of a higher frequency of 
adverse events in patients of low bodyweight (higher plasma concentration), and there is no temporal trend in 
adverse events (AE).

As a secondary objective, the Applicant evaluated whether administration of ofatumumab in the thigh  differed 
from administration  in the abdomen. No formal tests were performed. Based on figure 2-6 and table 2-5, high 
inter-subject  variability was demonstrated  for both  administration  routes and  administration  methods.  There 
was no clear tendency of differences in AUC or Cmax between administration routes and administration methods.

In the SmPC, the abdomen, thigh  and upper outer arm have been mentioned as administration sites. In the PK 
studies, the upper outer arm was not used as administration  site. However, in the phase 3 studies upper arm, 
thigh  and  abdomen were used  as injection  sites.  552  patients  (58.4 %  of  the  study  population)  had at  least 
one injection in the upper arm.  
Bioequivalence 
The Applicant evaluated bioequivalence between the PFS assembled with a needle safety device (NSD) used in 
the Phase III studies and PFS assembled in an autoinjector (AI) device for commercial use.  
The Applicant  used a  parallel design and  the  PK parameters were measured at  steady state.  This alternative 
approach  is  acceptable due  to  long  half-life  of  the  drug.  PK  parameters  (Cmax and  AUCtau)  were  measured 
between week 8 and week 12.   
Due to  high inter-subject variability and a parallel design, the  Applicant used a mixed scaling approach, which 
was discussed with  the FDA. Based on  this method,  the Applicant demonstrated bioequivalence between NSD 
and  AI.  The bioequivalence guideline  from  EMA  recommends a  similar approach  as  FDA  for  drugs  with  high 
intra-subject variability and is  also based on a cross-over design and not  a parallel design. High  intra-subject 
variability was especially seen in the  thigh group, who consisted of a low  number of patients.). 
The methodology is considered adequate and bioequivalence between NSD and AI is considered demonstrated.  
Distribution 
Serum ofatumumab PK parameters (Study OMS115102) following the first and second infusions of ofatumumab 
in both  Treatment Periods (Week 0-  24 and week 24- 48)  are summarized by treatment  and infusion in  Table 
2-8 and Table 2-9 (below), ranging from 2.15 to 2.74 L. The Applicant states that: in the two higher dose levels 
(300  and 700 mg) following  the second IV infusions, Vss were approximately 2.4  L for the 300  mg dose 2.2  L 
and 19 days for the 700 mg dose. Furthermore, in the final popPK model, Vp was fixed to 2.8 L as the Applicant 
states  that  this  value  has  been  reported  to  be  in  the  range  of  typical  values  for  the  peripheral  volume  of 
distribution.  In the 2-compartment popPK model central volume of distribution was estimated to 2.8 L and Vss 
was estimated to 5.6  
Table 10

Table 11 
In clinical studies with ofatumumab in other indications, the volume of distribution  at steady state ranged from 
1.7  to 8.1 L  across studies, dose levels, and infusion number, and the  expected Vd for a monoclonal antibody 
administered IV is approximately 5 L.  In study 5102, the AUC might  have been overestimated and thereby Vd 
underestimated, due  to  the  short time  interval  relative to the  long  t½  between  the  infusions,  which  explains 
the differences in Vd.  
Elimination 
Based on simulations using the popPK model, the elimination profiles in men and women dosed to steady-state 
and  following  withdrawal  of  treatment  showed an  approximate half-life  of  ofatumumab  of 14.9  days in  men 
and 17.1 days in women. 
Ofatumumab is eliminated through  a non-linear, target-mediated route as well as a target-independent route- 
mediated by non-specific endocytosis followed by intracellular catabolism. Higher  baseline B-cell count results 
in  greater  contribution  of  target-mediated  elimination  and  shorter  ofatumumab  half-life  at  the  start  of 
treatment.  Ofatumumab  dosing  leads  to  potent  depletion  of  B-cells  resulting  in  reduced overall  CL  at  later 
cycles. As  ofatumumab disposition  does  not  involve the  typical  P450-mediated  pathways  of  metabolism and 
excretion, no clinical or non-clinical ADME studies have been conducted.  
Excretion and  metabolism 
The  Applicant  states  that  as other  monoclonal  antibodies,  ofatumumab  is  expected to  be  degraded to  small 
peptides and amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. It is agreed that antibodies are cleared principally 
through protein degradation processes, and thus classic xenobiotics metabolism pathways do not contribute to 
the CL of ofatumumab.

Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Study OMS115102  was the first  study with  IV administration  of ofatumumab  to patients  with  RRMS,  with  the 
main purpose to evaluate the safety of ofatumumab. This study gave first evidence of profound B-cell depletion 
at relatively lower doses of ofatumumab in  the target population. 
The three dose cohorts were: 
Table 12 
Serum ofatumumab PK parameters following  the first and second infusions of ofatumumab in  both Treatment 
Periods are summarized by treatment and infusion in Table 2-8 and Table 2-9,  (above). 
Ofatumumab exhibited non-linear pharmacokinetics in doses below 100 mg. However, Cmax and AUC increased 
10-fold and 14-fold  when the  dose was increased from 100  mg to 700  mg. Hence, dose-proportionality in  the 
range 100  mg  -700  mg  ofatumumab  iv  was  not  demonstrated,  indicating  saturation  of  the  target-mediated 
elimination pathway in this  dose range.  
A lower dose of 20  mg SC monthly  is tested  in the  phase 3 studies  and proposed in  the  SmPC after a  3-time 
loading dose of 20 mg SC 
In  study  OMS115102,  higher  PK-parameters were  shown  after  the  second  infusion,  which  considered  to  be 
caused by a higher trough concentration before 2nd dose than 1st  dose (no ofatumumab administered). Thus, 
time dependency for the doses 100-700  mg was demonstrated.  
Furthermore, in study 2301  and 2302  an accumulation factor of ~3 was seen from month 3 to  month 24.  
Intra-  and inter-individual variability 
High  inter-subject  variability  was  shown  in  the  bioequivalence  study  (G2102)  time-wise  ranging  over 
approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude (fig 2-7 below). No  intrasubject variability analysis was conducted.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The PK studies were conducted in RRMS patients and in RMS patients. No PK studies were conducted in healthy 
volunteers. In the pop-PK modelling, data from the phase 3 studies were included. 
Special populations 
No  studies in  hepatic and  renal impaired patients  have been conducted. The  Applicant states  that  changes in 
renal or hepatic function are unlikely to affect the elimination of ofatumumab. This is agreed. 
•  Gender 
Based on the  popPK model, the  bioavailability was  estimated to  be lower  for women than  men  resulting in  a 
20% lower estimated AUC and Cmax at steady state for women compared with men of similar bodyweight. This 
difference is considered small and is furthermore outweighed by a higher exposure with lower bodyweight. No 
differences in dosing between gender is recommended in the SmPC, which is agreed. 
•  Race 
The Applicant found race not to  be a significant covariate in the models. It should although be noted that only 
112 out  of a total  of 1451  patient included in  the 5 studies were non-Caucasians.  
•  Weight 
Bodyweight was a significant covariate in the  popPK model with  a reduced exposure (AUC) of more than 50% 
in women above the 95% percentile bodyweight and an increased exposure of more than 50% in women below 
the  5%  percentile bodyweight compared with  women  with  the  median bodyweight  (65.5  kg).  Among men, a 
similar pattern was seen. 
Comparing a female patient of 60  kg with  a female patient of 100  kg and a male patient  of 60  kg with  a male 
patient  of  100  kg,  more  than  a  2-fold  higher  AUC  and  Cmax is  observed. For  the  more  extreme bodyweight 
values, the differences are even larger.

Figure 9 
The variability was extensive but no effect on efficacy and safety was observed due to the variability in exposure 
between the extreme values of bodyweight and a flat  dose is considered acceptable. . 
The impact of bodyweight  on PK is reflected in the SmPC, section 5.2. 
•  Elderly 
No studies in patients older than 56 years were conducted. Based on limited data available, no dose adjustment 
is considered necessary in elderly patients,  which is adequately reflected in  the SmPC.

•  Children 
No PK studies in children were performed. A PIP has been adopted. 
Interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. This is considered acceptable as monoclonal antibodies 
is degraded to small peptides and amino acids and are not metabolised by the cytochrome p450  system. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Ofatumumab is a  monoclonal antibody  that  binds CD20. CD20 is  a calcium channel protein expressed on late 
pre-B cells, mature -cells and memory B-cells. CD20 binding induces B-cell lysis primarily through complement-
dependent cytotoxicity, and, to a lesser extent,  by antibody-dependent T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. 
B-cell  count  is  used  as  the  PD  outcome  in  the  pharmacology programme, which  is  considered an  adequate 
marker of PD of ofatumumab. 
Primary pharmacology 
In  study  OMS115102,  in  which  high  IV  doses were used,  b-cell  depletion  was  seen after  2  weeks after  first 
dose (Fig  2.9 below).  B-cell depletion was seen for most of the subjects up to week 48 (fig 2-10  below) for all 
dose levels. The recovery started earlier for the lowest dose, however, only a few subjects had recovered after 
46 weeks post-dose. The median time to  recovery of B-cells is 24 weeks in the phase 3 studies.

Figure 11 
In Study G2102  the treatment  period consisted of an initial  loading phase (3  loading doses of 20  mg SC each 
on Days 1, 7 and 14) followed by a maintenance dose of 20 mg SC every 4 weeks, starting on Week 4. Depletion 
of b-cells was seen after the first injection and continued to decrease with subsequent injections. The proportion 
of patients that  were below the lower limit of normal (LLN)  of 80 cells /microliter after the three loading doses 
was 100%. The median b-cell count  was 1/microliter after the end of the loading regimen (week 4),  see fig 2-
8 below. The treatment regimen is considered to deplete b-cells adequately.

Figure 12 
Study OMS112831 
Depletion of B-cells was rapid and dose-dependent at lower doses.  
Studies G2301 and G2302 
In  pivotal studies,  clinical  activity  of  ofatumumab toward  B-cell  was shown.  The  loading  dose regimen of  20 
mg at  days 1,  7 and 14,  followed by maintenance regimen, every month administration  of 20  mg, resulted in 
rapid  and sustained  depletion  of  B-cell  in  major of  patients  from week  2  of  the  treatment.  Below LLN  B-cell 
level  (40  cells/µL)  was  observed  for  96%  of  patients  for  as  long  as  the  treatment  period  continued. 
Discontinuation  of  treatment  led  to  the  repletion  – (defined  as  valued above  LLN  or  baseline) of  B-cells.  At 
week 60,  repletion was 84.6%  and 97.4% for Asclepios I and II, respectively.  
In Phase II study OMS112831, depletion of B-cells below 32 cells/µL have no impact on lesions reduction. Main 
concern  arises  from  different  settings  of  B-cell  limits  which  were  used  for  division  of  patients  according 
ofatumumab response toward B-cell depletion. First,  the  Applicant confirmed the  target number of cells is ≤ 8 
cells/µL. However, the lower limit  for this study used for division of patients according to the number of B-cells 
after treatment  was LLN,  so 40 cells for 1 µL.  Further, for pooled data analysis from studies G2301 and G2301 
the cut-off  was 10  cells/µL. The use of the  ≤ 8  cells/µL as a target number was based upon  understanding the 
relationship between B-cell depletion and the  GdE T1 lesions volume. Lower B-cell count  were associated with 
lower  cumulative  GdE  T1  lesions  volumes,  not  lesion  count.  Additionally,  32  cells/µL  was  appropriate  for 
lowering  GdE  T1  volume  lesions from  week  4  to  12,  whereas  the  T1  volume  was  lower  between  12  and  24 
weeks of treatment when the B cells were 8 cells/µL.

Secondary pharmacology 
QTc  
No  dedicated  QTc  studies  were  performed.  Monoclonal  antibodies  are  not  likely  to  cause  QTc  interval 
prolongation,  and  no  QTc  prolongation  was  seen  in  the  pre-clinical  studies,  in  the  phase  3  studies  in  RMS 
patients  or  in  the  pre-clinical,  clinical  and  post-marketing  studies  in  oncology.  Hence,  ofatumumab  is  not 
considered to cause Qtc prolongation. According to ICH E14 Questions and Answers, R3, 2017 it  is acceptable 
that  no dedicated QTc studies have been conducted. 
As the teriflunomide is not considered as drug that  may cause QT interval prolongation of clinical significance, 
the  Applicant  was  asked  why  patient  with  a  QT  prolongation  in  history  was  excluded  from  the  study 
(OMS112831).  Study OMS112831  was  planned and executed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) with  a CSR effective 
date 15-Dec-2015. The Applicant informed that  the rationale for the individual inclusion / exclusion criteria are 
not  documented and  unknown  to  Novartis. In  the  Novartis Phase III studies,  this  exclusion criterion was  not 
applied. 
Antidrug antibodies 
In 24 out 1476 subjects, antidrug-antibodies were identified, Table 2-1 (below). Of those, 17 subjects had pre-
existing antidrug-antibodies  and 7  subjects had induced antidrug-antibodies.  Furthermore, in  10  subjects the 
analysis of antidrug-antibodies was inconclusive. In total, 20 samples were analysed for neutralising antibodies, 
and none  of those  were positive. The assay for evaluation of ADA in  study 5102  was  inconclusive due to  low 
drug tolerance. The assays for evaluation of ADA and NAb in  the  phase 3  studies are considered valid, hence 
the prevalence and incidence of antibodies in  the phase 3 studies are considered low.  
Table 13 
ADA titers and  PK 
Individual plasma concentrations were plotted for subjects in studies G2102, G2301 and G2302, and the course 
of ofatumumab  plasma concentrations  for subjects with  antidrug-antibodies  (ADAs) were  highlighted.    There 
was no clear tendency of a lower plasma concentration in subjects with positive antidrug-antibodies, although 
one  of  the  subjects  in  study  G2102  had  minimum  trough  concentrations  at  3  time  points.  No  neutralising 
antibodies were detected.

In  all  three  studies,  several  subjects  experienced  minimal  ofatumumab  plasma  concentrations.  As  no 
neutralising antibodies were detected, the low ofatumumab concentration in some of the patients is not due to 
NAb.

ADA and B-cell kinetics 
The  Applicant has  plotted  the  levels of  CD19+ B-cell  count  for study  G2102,  G2301  and  G2302.  There is  no 
tendency  that  subjects  with  anti-drug  antibodies  have  a  lower  depletion  of  B-cells.  However,  2.4  %  of  the 
patients do not experience a depletion in B-cells. Even though the B-cell depletion was incomplete, the efficacy 
was higher in the 23 patients  with insufficient  b-cell response compared with the teriflunomide group.  
The  course of  ADA overlaid on  B-cell  counts  in  Studies  G2102,  G2301  and  G2302  are  shown  in  Figure  2-4, 
Figure 2-5  and Figure  2-6. The plots  indicate no impact of positive and high  titers  of ADA on B-cell kinetics in 
patients with  RMS.

Relationship between  plasma concentration and  effect 
In the dose finding study, depletion of b-cells was associated with  dose – the higher dose, the greater depletion 
of b-cells. Simulation results suggested that the phase 3 regimen achieves and maintains target B-cell depletion 
in  nearly all  patients  within  4 to  8  weeks (fig.  5-11,  below). In  addition,  enabling  recovery of B-cells for  the 
median patient  within  40  weeks of a dosing halt.  Based on the  results, the  Applicant suggest the  lower 20mg 
Q4W maintenance dose.  
Depletion model simulations for phase 3 dose regimen selection: 
Simulations of the percentage of patients attaining the target B-cells depletion (≤8 cells/µL) for different doses 
and number of loading doses are shown in Table 5-8. Single doses of up to 60  mg achieved target depletion in 
66%  of  patients.  20mg  given 4  times  is  predicted  to  reach target  depletion  in  nearly  all  patients.  When  the 
Applicant  grouped three initial  20mg  loading doses into  a  single  60mg dose  and follow  up  with  an  additional 
20mg dose, then it was suggested that  nearly all (98%) patients  attaining target depletion.

Figure 20 
Across  the  phase  3  studies,  besides  the  loading  phase,  weak  correlation  between  serum  ofatumumab 
concentration and B-cells depletion has been found. When patients exhibited the lowest (observed in month 3) 
and  the  highest  (observed in  month  1)  serum  ofatumumab  concentration,  high  depletion  of  B-cells  seen  in 
above 96% of patients, independently upon ofatumumab level was noted.  
A simulation was performed to assess whether a lower dose of ofatumumab could have a potency to adequately 
decrease B-cell count.  The  result showed  that  median count  of  B-cell was similar  for both  the  20  mg and  10 
mg  maintenance  doses  (1.4  cells/μL  and  1.5  cells/μL,  respectively).  However,  the  proportion  of  patients 
reaching target B-cell depletion were lower with the  10 mg maintenance dose (10% of patients have above 10 
cell/µL in  10 mg maintenance dose compared to 5%  in simulated patients  after 20 mg of ofatumumab). Also, 
higher and variable count of B-cell after loading phase and higher B-cell count are associated with suboptimal 
efficacy (OMS112831-Figure  17). 
Baseline B-cell count  has no impact  on B-cell depletion.  Rapid and complete B-cell depletion was seen across 
the  studies  irrespective of  baseline  B-cell  count,  which  ranged  from  below  the  LLN  to  above 1000  cell/µL. 
Besides B-cell depletion, no influence of baseline B-cell count was seen on efficacy and safety after ofatumumab 
administration

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacology programme  included  three  phase  2  studies  and  two  phase 3  studies.  From  the  phase  2 
studies PK and  PD were evaluated and bioequivalence were assessed, and the  data from the phase 3  studies 
were included in the  population PK analysis.  
The PK of  ofatumumab in  patients with  RMS has been evaluated based on data  from 5  studies  (OMS115102, 
OMS112831,  G2301,  G2302  and  G2102).  Both  conventional  non-compartmental  and  model-based analyses 
were used. 
Methods to quantifyofatumumab, antidrug antibodies, and neutralizing antibodies were validated. Furthermore, 
the  assay for  quantification  of  ofatumumab  had  a LLQ  of  100  ng/ml,  hence the  ofatumumab  concentrations 
could not be measured for the majority of doses used in the dose-response study. For the highest dose (60 mg 
q4)  and  in  the  phase 3  study  (20  mg  q4)  there  was  an accumulation  ratio  of  1.75  to  3,  which  is  due  to  the 
depletion  of B-cells  and thereby  a lower  degradation of  ofatumumab.  The increased plasma concentration  is 
not considered a safety concern.  
The  multiple  dose  studies  showed  non-linear  pharmacokinetics. Hence,  ofatumumab Cmax increased 10-fold, 
and AUC increased 14-fold for a 7-fold increase in dose (from 100 mg to 700  mg). A lower dose of 20 mg was 
used  in  the  phase 3  studies,  where  ofatumumab  concentrations  were measured  as trough  values at  steady 
state.  
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the  PFS assembled with  a needle safety device (NSD) used in  the 
Phase III studies and  PFS assembled in  an autoinjector  (AI) device for commercial use.  The Applicant  states 
that  SC injection  can be in  the  thigh,  abdomen and  upper arm. No  bioequivalence studies were conducted  in 
order to  show whether  absorption differed between  injections sites. However, the Applicant  states that  in  the 
phase 3 studies upper arm, thigh and abdomen were used as injection sites. 552 patients (58.4 % of the study 
population) had at least one injection in the upper arm. Even though AUC and Cmax were not compared between 
injection  site,  the  depletion  of  B-cells  irrespective  of  injection  site  supports  that  ofatumumab  can  be 
administered in  the upper arm as well in  the thigh  and abdomen. 
A target-mediated drug-disposition  model was selected to  describe the ofatumumab concentration-time  data. 
The PK parameter estimates have been specified as follows: a CL estimate of 0.156  L/day, the central volume 
of distribution  estimated to 2.8 L, and the absorption rate constant estimated to 0.328 days -1, giving a steady 
state time to maximum concentration of 4-5 days post dose. 
The  inter-subject  variability  on  the  model  parameters  and  the  variability  in  the  concentration  data  within 
patients  described well the  variability observed between patients,  with  concentrations at steady state ranging 
over 1-1.5  orders of magnitude given the phase 3 dose regimen.  
Due  to  the  degradation  to  small  peptides  and  amino  acids,  no  impact  of  hepatic  insufficiency  or  renal 
impairment are expected. The Applicant furthermore states that data from Arzerra used in oncology shows that 
baseline creatinine  CL  is  not  associated with  inter-individual  variability in  ofatumumab  pharmacokinetics for 
CLcr values above 26ml/min, which  is accepted. 
The POP PK analysis (Population pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab in RMS patients Modelling Report) suggested 
a quasi-steady state  approximation of the  target mediated drug-disposition model with  two  PK compartments 
and  a  first  order  process  for  the  SC  administration.  After  the  loading  phase,  ofatumumab  concentrations 
decreased to a minimum and then  increased to  steady state after 2  years. This was captured in the  model by 
a time-dependent  effect  on the  receptor synthesis  rate. The  covariates that  were selected in  the  final model 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 65/138 
 
 
 
included weight effects on the absorption rate, CL, intercompartmental CL, central volume, complex elimination 
rate constant and the  baseline receptor synthesis rate, a sex effect on bioavailability, an AI effect on complex 
elimination rate constant, and an IV formulation effect on baseline receptor synthesis rate. The covariates anti-
drug antibodies, age, race and baseline B-cell count were found not to be related to any of the PK parameters. 
The majority of  the  data came from patients  given the  phase 3  dosing regimen of  3 weekly loading doses of 
20 mg followed by 20 mg given every 4 weeks starting from day 28, corresponding to 1196 patients with 7874 
observed concentrations. Dose ranging information came from the IV study OMS115102 and the phase 2 study 
OMS112831.  While OMS112831  provided 650  observations from 219  patients  administered  doses between  3 
and 60 mg, 70.9%  of the observations were BLOQ. This meant that  most of the rich PK data with  dose ranging 
information came from study OMS115102, although at doses higher than are possibly relevant for RMS patients. 
However, PK data after administration of 3, 30 and 60 mg allowed the characterisation of the PK across different 
dose levels and the result from study OMS115102  was included in the popPK analysis.  
The  population  PK  model  shows  that  bioavailability  for  women  is  20%  lower  than  for  men  of  similar  body 
weight,  which  is not  considered clinically relevant and no  dose adjustment  is  recommended in the  SmPC. On 
the other hand, body weight was a significant covariate in the population PK analysis. Hence, for women in the 
top  5%  or  lowest  5%  of  the  body weight  distribution,  a 50%  decrease or 50%  increase was shown.  Among 
men, a similar pattern was seen. The variability in exposure was extensive but no effect on efficacy and safety 
was observed between the extreme values of bodyweight, and a flat dose is considered acceptable.  
No  studies  in  patients  older than  56  years were conducted,  and  no  PK  studies  were conducted  in  paediatric 
subjects.  
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. This is considered acceptable as monoclonal antibodies 
is degraded to small peptides and amino acids and are not metabolised by the cytochrome p450  system.  
PD were assessed using three phase 2 studies and two phase 3  studies.  
In  study  OMS115102,  in  which  high  IV  doses were used,  b-cell  depletion  was  seen after  2  weeks after  first 
dose. B-cell depletion was seen for most of the subjects up to week 48. Recovery started earlier for the lowest 
dose, however, only a few  subjects had recovered after 46  weeks post-dose. The median time to  recovery of 
B-cells is  24  weeks in  the  phase  3  study  in  which  the  proposed dose has  been used.  This is  reflected in  the 
SmPC section 4.4. 
In study G2102, in which  the proposed dose of 20 mg q4 post loading was used, adequate depletion of b-cells 
was  seen  after  4  weeks.  Across the  phase  3  studies,  besides the  loading  phase,  weak correlation  between 
serum ofatumumab  concentration  and  B-cells depletion  has been  found.  When  patients  exhibited  the  lowest 
(observed in month 3) and the highest (observed in month 1) serum ofatumumab concentration, high depletion 
of B-cells seen in  above 96% of patients, independently upon ofatumumab level was noted.  
A simulation was performed to assess whether a lower dose of ofatumumab could have a potency to adequately 
decrease B-cell count.  The  result showed  that  median count  of  B-cell was similar  for both  the  20  mg and  10 
mg  maintenance  doses  (1.4  cells/μL  and  1.5  cells/μL,  respectively).  However,  the  proportion  of  patients 
reaching target B-cell depletion were lower with the  10 mg maintenance dose (10% of patients have above 10 
cell/µL in  10 mg maintenance dose compared to 5%  in simulated patients  after 20 mg of ofatumumab). Also, 
higher and variable count of B-cell after loading phase and higher B-cell count are associated with suboptimal 
efficacy (OMS112831-Figure  17). 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021

Baseline B-cell count  has no impact  on B-cell depletion.  Rapid and complete B-cell depletion was seen across 
the  studies  irrespective of  baseline  B-cell  count,  which  ranged  from  below  the  LLN  to  above 1000  cell/µL. 
Besides B-cell depletion, no influence of baseline B-cell count was seen on efficacy and safety after ofatumumab 
administration. 
No  dedicated  QT  study  was  conducted;  however, monoclonal antibodies  are not  likely to  cause  QTc interval 
prolongation,  and  no  QTc  prolongation  was  seen  in  the  pre-clinical  studies,  in  the  phase  3  studies  in  RMS 
patients  or  in  the  pre-clinical,  clinical  and  post-marketing  studies  in  oncology.  Hence,  ofatumumab  is  not 
considered  to  cause  QTc  prolongation,  and  it  is  considered  acceptable  that  no  dedicated  QTc  study  was 
conducted.  
Few  subjects  had developed antidrug  antibodies,  however, 17  subjects  had  pre-existing antidrug  antibodies, 
and 10 samples were inconclusive. The assay for evaluation of ADA in study 5102  was inconclusive due to low 
drug tolerance. The assays for evaluation of ADA and NAb in  the  phase 3  studies are considered valid, hence 
the prevalence and incidence of antibodies in the phase 3 studies are considered low. No neutralising antibodies 
were detected  in  the  phase 3  studies,  therefore the  lack of  B-cell depletion  in  several of  the  patients  in  the 
phase 3 studies is not  considered to  be caused by NAb. A tendency towards a lower effect in 23  patients with 
incomplete  B-cell response was  seen,  however, the  effect  was  higher  than  compared  with  the teriflunomide 
group. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, the clinical pharmacology programme describes adequately the pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab 
and the proposed dosing regimen: 20 mg weekly loading dose for 3 weeks followed by 20mg Q4W maintenance 
dose.  Ofatumumab  showed  adequate depletion  of  b-cells  using  the  proposed  dosing  regimen, however, the 
effect  was  higher  than  compared  with  the  teriflunomide  group.  In  conclusion,  the  clinical  pharmacology is 
considered acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The Phase III studies  COMB157G2301  (hereafter referred to  as Study  2301)  and  COMB157G2302  (hereafter 
referred to as Study 2302) are the key studies supporting the registration of ofatumumab 20 mg SC in patients 
with active RMS. Studies 2301 and 2302 had a flexible duration design: The treatment duration for an individual 
patient  was  variable and  based  on  when  the  End  of  Study  (EOS)  was  declared. EOS  was  declared for  both 
studies  simultaneously  based  on  an  analysis  of  blinded  data  and  a  projection  by  when  all  pre-specified 
conditions  would  be  met.  The  maximal  treatment  duration  for  an  individual  patient  was  30  study  months 
(approximately 2.5  years). The study-specific  data  cut-off  date  was  05-Jul-2019  for  Study  2301  and  10-Jul- 
2019  for Study 2302. 
Study COMB157G2399 is the open-label, single-arm, multi-center extension study enrolling patients completing 
other ofatumumab MS  clinical studies (including  studies 2301  and 2302).  The study will  be evaluating further 
long-term  safety,  tolerability  and  effectiveness  of  ofatumumab  in  patients  with  RMS.  Limited  data  were 
available at the time of submission and were therefore not included.

2.5.1.  Dose-selection study 
The  ofatumumab dose and  regimen for use  in  the  pivotal Phase III studies  was  determined based on  PK/PD 
modelling of data from the Phase II Study OMS112831, which  investigated different doses (3 mg, 30 mg, and 
60  mg)  and different dosing  intervals (Q12W  and  Q4W)  of ofatumumab SC  in patients  with  RRMS. Based on 
the results of the PK/PD modelling, the Applicant selected a loading dose regimen of 20 mg ofatumumab SC at 
Day 1, 7, and 14,  and a maintenance dose regimen of 20 mg every 4 weeks starting at  Week 4. 
Study  OMS112831  was  a Phase II,  randomized, multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study to  assess the MRI  efficacy, safety, and tolerability  of a range of ofatumumab doses administered SC in 
patients  with  RRMS.  The  study  consisted  of  4  phases:  Screening,  24-week  Treatment  (Weeks  0-12  were 
placebo-controlled; at  Week 12  placebo patients  received ofatumumab 3  mg (Table 2-2), 24-week Follow-up, 
and individualised follow-up every 12 weeks until  B-cell repletion. Patients could participate in a PK-sub-study 
if they signed a separate informed consent. 
The  study  met  the  primary  endpoint,  as  demonstrated  by  a  reduction  in  cumulative  new  Gd-enhancing  T1 
lesions for  all ofatumumab  groups  compared to  placebo following  12  weeks of  treatment.  There was  a rapid 
and dose-dependent reduction in  CD19 +B-cells. During Weeks 0-12, the  reduction in the cumulative number 
of  new  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions (primary  endpoint)  was  65%  for  all  ofatumumab  dose groups  compared to 
placebo.

Figure 21 
A clear dose-response relationship was not demonstrated. Thus, all doses tested (3 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg) in the 
MIRROR study (OMS112831)  led to the same (65%)  reduction in the cumulative number of new Gd-enhancing 
T1  lesions  compared  to  placebo.  A  slightly  higher  median  percentage  B-cell  reduction  from  baseline  was 
observed in the 30 mg group (89.32%)  as compared to the 3 mg group (77.93%)  at Week 24.  This led to  the 
assumption that a lower dose than 30 mg and higher dose than 3 mg would be sufficient to achieve the desired 
efficacy. Furthermore,  the  dose regimens of  60 mg  Q12W  and Q4W  were associated with  more AEs than  the 
lower dose regimens of 3  mg or 30  mg Q12W  between Week 0  and Week 12.  PK/PD modelling  based on  the 
study data suggested that  a loading regimen of 3 separate 20 mg injections of ofatumumab (at weeks 0, 1 and 
2) was required to attain a target depletion of ≤ 8 cells/μL in > 95%  of patients. Furthermore, an ofatumumab 
dose of 20  mg  appeared to  be sufficient to  either  maintain or  to further  deplete B-cells in  > 95%  of  patients 
with  previously depleted B-cell levels. Thus, this dosing regimen was selected for Phase III.

Treatments 
The studies included 2 treatment groups: 
•  Ofatumumab group: ofatumumab 20 mg SC injections on Days 1, 7, 14,  Week 4 (Study month 1) and 
every 4 weeks thereafter + teriflunomide-matching placebo capsule orally once daily. 
• 
Teriflunomide group: teriflunomide  14  mg capsule orally once daily +  ofatumumab matching  placebo 
injections on Days 1, 7, 14, Week 4 (Study month 1) and every 4 weeks thereafter. 
Ofatumumab  is  clear  to  opalescent,  colourless  to  pale  yellow,  essentially  particle-free  liquid  in  a  PFS. 
Ofatumumab  20  mg  PFS  for  SC  administration  was  supplied  to  the  Investigators.  The  matching  placebo  to 
ofatumumab PFS had the same appearance as the investigational drug. 
The  control  treatment,  teriflunomide  (Aubagio®)  14  mg  for  oral  administration  was  provided  as  over-
encapsulated  tablets  (either  a  hard  gelatine  capsule  or  a  vegetarian-based hydroxy propyl methyl  cellulose 
capsule  was  used,  referred  to  as  capsule  hereafter).  Teriflunomide-matching  placebo  capsule  (capsule 
containing  placebo-tablet)  had  the  same  appearance  as  the  active  comparator.  Teriflunomide  and 
teriflunomide-matching placebo capsules were provided in blisters.

Note:  Disability-related key-secondary objectives are reported separately in  a combined data  (meta-analysis) 
report. All other key secondary objectives are addressed separately based on data from each individual study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary endpoint  was  the  ARR,  which  was  defined as  the  number  of  confirmed  MS  relapses in  a  year. 
Relapses were confirmed based on the EDSS by the independent EDSS Rater. 
-  MS relapse definition: appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable 
or  improving  pre-existing  neurological  abnormality,  separated by  at  least  30  days  from  onset  of  a 
preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must have been present for at least 24 hours 
and occurred in the absence of fever (< 37.5°C) or known infection. 
-  Confirmation of MS relapse: the definition  of a confirmed MS relapse is one accompanied by a clinically 
relevant change in the EDSS performed by the Independent EDSS Rater, i.e. an increase of at least 0.5 
points  on the EDSS score, or an increase of 1 point  on two  functional scores (FSs) or 2 points  on one 
FS, excluding changes involving bowel/bladder or cerebral FS compared to the previous available rating 
(the last EDSS rating that did not  occur during a relapse).   
The primary analysis used a treatment policy strategy e.g. the Applicant compared the treatment effect in term 
of ARR between ofatumumab and teriflunomide regardless of treatment  discontinuation  or short treatment  to 
alleviate the symptoms of relapses. 
Key-secondary efficacy endpoints 
Disability  worsening (3-month  or 6-month confirmed) 
A  3mCDW  was  defined  as  an  increase  from  baseline  in  EDSS  sustained  for  at  least  3  months  (Table  9-6). 
Analogously, a  6mCDW is defined as an increase from baseline in EDSS sustained for at  least 6 months.  This 
means that  after a scheduled or unscheduled visit at which the patient  fulfils the disability worsening criterion, 
all EDSS assessments (scheduled or unscheduled) need to also fulfil the worsening criteria until the worsening 
(“the  event”) can be confirmed at  the first scheduled visit that  occurs 3-months  (or 6  months) after the onset 
of the worsening, or later.

Table 18 
Disability  improvement (6-month  confirmed) 
A  6mCDI is  defined as  a  decrease from  baseline EDSS sustained  for  at  least  6  months.  Censoring occurs  in 
patients who did  not experience a 6mCDI event in the study. 
Number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions per scan 
Comparison of the number of Gd-enhancing lesions per scan between ofatumumab 20 mg SC and teriflunomide 
14 mg p.o. 
Annualised rate of new or enlarging T2 lesions 
Comparison of the number  of new or enlarging  T2 lesions between ofatumumab  20 mg SC and teriflunomide 
14 mg p.o. 
Neurofilament light  chain 
NfL  is  hypothesised  to  be  a  putative  biomarker  to  indicate  treatment  response  and  to  predict  disability 
worsening in  patients  with  MS.  Comparison is  performed of  the  NfL  concentration  between  ofatumumab and 
20 mg SC teriflunomide 14  mg p.o. by Month  3. 
Superiority of  ofatumumab 20 mg  SC over teriflunomide 14 mg  p.o. was concluded if NfL  levels were already 
lower at Month  3 in patients treated with  ofatumumab compared with teriflunomide. 
Brain volume loss 
The BVL between ofatumumab 20 mg SC and teriflunomide 14  mg p.o. will  be compared. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised to receive either ofatumumab 20 mg sc injections once every 4 weeks (after 
initial  loading  regimen)  or  teriflunomide  14  mg  orally  once  daily.  The  randomisation  was  stratified  by 
geographical region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America and Australia, Asia Pacific, Latin America, 
Others)  and by  MS  subtype (RRMS,  SPMS)  to  ensure a balance between  covariates with  potential  impact  on 
Assessment report

the primary endpoint. All eligible subjects were randomised via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) by NIRT, 
using a block randomisation schedule (block size=4) by region. 
The  definition  of  region  could  be  modified  if  that  is  indicated  based  on  statistical  criteria  (e.g.,  non-
convergence). For  statistical  analysis where region is  adjusted in  the statistical  models, regions “Asia Pacific” 
and “Latin  America” were combined with  region “Other” due to small number of patients in  these 2 regions. 
No minimum number of SPMS patients  was defined. 
Study sites could only participate in one of the 2 studies to ensure independence of each study. 
Blinding (masking) 
A  double-dummy  design  was  used because  the  identity  of  the  study  drug  cannot  be  disguised,  as  the  drug 
products utilise different formulations. 
Patients,  Investigator staff,  persons performing the  assessments, and data  analysts would  remain blinded  to 
the identity  of the treatment  from the time of randomization until  database lock, using the following methods: 
(1)  Randomization data  kept  strictly  confidential  until  the  time  of  unblinding,  and  not  accessible by  anyone 
involved in the study with  the following exceptions: Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) members, Independent 
Statisticians and Independent Programmers. (2) The identity  of the treatments would be concealed by the use 
of  investigational  treatment  that  are  all  identical  in  packaging,  labelling,  schedule  of  administration, 
appearance, taste and odour. 
The  randomisation codes associated with  PK  samples were disclosed to  the  Bioanalysts  who  should keep PK 
and ADA results confidential until data base lock. 
The following measures were taken to protect the blinding of the Independent EDSS Rater (Rater): 
• 
Prohibited access to patients’ study data 
•  Separate binders of worksheets and CRF materials for Investigator and the Rater 
• 
Prohibited cross-over of Investigator and Rater 
•  Use  of  appropriate  clothing  by  patients  to  cover  potential  injection  sites  during  neurological 
examinations 
• 
Limited  interactions  between Rater  and  patient:  permitting  only a  minimum  required  to  perform the 
EDSS rating. 
Additionally,  potentially  unblinding  laboratory  parameters  (e.g.  B-cell  counts,  teriflunomide  plasma  level 
results) were not  to be communicated to the  Investigator or other study staff. 
Unblinding  would only occur in the case of patient  emergencies and at the conclusion of the core study. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy analyses were performed using the full analysis set (FAS),  which included all randomized patients 
according to the assigned treatment. The per-protocol set was used in supportive analysis. The use of the FAS 
Assessment report

for the primary analyses is endorsed. It is worth  noticing  that  the  statistical  models used for the  primary and 
key secondary endpoints included covariates. Some patients  had missing covariate values and therefore were 
excluded from the primary analyses (21 and 17 patients were excluded in study 2301 and 2302, respectively). 
This is not endorsed since it violates the ITT-principle. Imputation of missing covariate values would have been 
preferred in  order  to  include  all  subjects  in  the  analysis.  The  Applicant  performed supplementary  analyses 
where the  covariates with  missing  values were excluded from the  model and  thus  all patients  were included. 
These analyses had similar results to those corresponding to  the primary analyses.  
The primary endpoint  of both  studies  was the  ARR. The ARR was estimated  using  a negative binomial model 
with  log-link.  The  covariates of  the  model were  treatment  and  region, number  of  relapses in  previous year, 
baseline  EDSS,  baseline  number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  and  the  patient’s  age  at  baseline.  The  response 
variable was the number of confirmed relapses in the treatment epoch observed and the patient’s time in study 
was used as an offset variable. The variable region was redefined from that  originally planned due to  too few 
patients/relapses in some regions. This model assumes that  the relapse rate is constant within  patient. Patients 
who discontinued  the study contributed only with  the  observed time and it  was assumed that  the relapse rate 
for  those  patients  would  not  be  affected  by  treatment  discontinuation  (missing  at  random  assumption). 
Sensitivity analyses included the use of all relapses (confirmed and unconfirmed) and a tipping point  analysis. 
To further support the primary analyses, a Cox model comparing the time to the first relapse was implemented. 
In  order to  assess whether  the  relapse rate  could  change between  and  after  8  weeks (onset  period  of  both 
drugs), a piecewise negative binomial regression model was implemented. The model implemented to analyse 
the primary endpoint and the  supportive analyses are considered adequate. 
The number of Gd-lesions per MRI-scan and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions will be compared using 
a  negative  binomial  regression model  with  log-link.  The  total  number  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  and  the 
number of new or enlarging T2 lesions will be used as the response variable, and the natural log of the number 
of  MRI-scans  as  offset.  The  covariates of  the  model  are treatment  and  region,  and  age, and  number  of  Gd 
enhancing T1  lesions or volume of T2 lesions at  baseline. These models assume noninformative drop-out and 
constant intensity  of lesion formation over time.  
The  model  implemented  to  compare  the  number  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  between  ofatumumab  and 
teriflunomide is endorsed. Only scheduled MRI scans with  non-missing values for the number of Gd-enhancing 
T1 and T2 lesions were considered in the analysis. It is understood that most unscheduled MRI scans would be 
performed during the onset of a relapse.  
The  model  implemented  to  compare  the  number  of  new  or  enlarged  T2  lesions  between  ofatumumab  and 
teriflunomide is  endorsed. Only scheduled MRI scans with  non-missing values for T2  lesions were considered 
in the analysis.  
The  geometric  mean  of  NfL  concentration  of  the  two  treatment  arms  will  be  compared at  month  3  using  a 
mixed model for repeated measures. The response variable is the log-transformed values of the  NfL level. The 
model covariates are treatment,  region, visit,  age,  number of  Gd-enhancing  lesions at  baseline,  baseline T2 
lesion volume and the log-transformed NfL baseline value. The model will also include a treatment-by-timepoint 
interaction and an unstructured covariance matrix will be used. The model implemented to  compare the mean 
concentration of NfL  between ofatumumab and teriflunomide is endorsed. The model for the NfL concentration 
assumes missing at random.  
A random coefficients model will be used as main analysis for brain volume loss. The random coefficients model 
will  include  treatment,  region,  time,  number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  at  baseline,  baseline  T2  volume,  and 
normalized brain volume at baseline and treatment by time  interaction. The model will also contain  random a 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 76/138 
 
 
 
random  slope  and  a  random  intercept.    Under  the  assumption  of  linearity  of  the  percentage  brain  volume 
change  over time,  the  model corrects for  missing  values.  Overall, the  model  used  for  the  calculation  of  the 
difference in brain volume loss across treatment is agreed.  
The  disability endpoints  (3mCDP,  6mCDP and  6mCDI) were analysed using  a  Cox-model stratified  by  study. 
The variables of the model were treatment, region and baseline EDSS. Between study heterogeneity was tested 
using a Cox-model including a treatment-by-study interaction. Patients who did not experience an event during 
observation were censored. For 3mCDP and 6mCDP sensitivity analyses assuming that patients who discontinue 
the study due to “Lack of efficacy” had an event were performed in both arms or only on the ofatumumab arm. 
Several  supportive  analyses  were  also  planned.  The  statistical  methods  used  for  analysing  the  disability 
endpoints are overall agreed. It is not considered adequate to apply the non-informative censoring assumption 
in the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses were presented challenging this assumption and are endorsed. 
Type I error control 
Each study has one primary endpoint and several key secondary endpoints. Furthermore, some key secondary 
endpoints  will  be obtained  by pooling  both  studies.  The studies  were planned in  order to  allow for  pooling of 
the data in order to achieve reasonable power to detect a treatment effect in the disability endpoints. Planning 
of  the  analyses adds  credibility  to  the  results,  and  it  was  encouraged by  the  CHMP  as  mentioned  in  the  SA 
given in  2016  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/207022/2016).  There is  no established  methodological approach to  control 
for multiplicity in  a pooling set-up. 
Power calculation 
A negative binomial distribution of relapses was assumed for the primary analysis; this is a common assumption 
in MS. The demonstration of a relative reduction of the ARR in patients treated with ofatumumab (λofa=0.168) 
compared with  those treated with  teriflunomide  (λter=0.28)  by 40%  (λofa /  λter =0.6)  with  a power of  90% 
at a one-sided alpha-level of 0.025 in a study with 1.5 years follow-up and under the assumption of a dispersion 
parameter  κ=0.82  requires a  sample  size  of  322  completers  per  treatment  group  (644  completers for  the 
study).  Allowing for 20%  uninformative dropouts  equally distributed  across treatment  groups, a  total  sample 
size of 805  randomized patients  was required for the  study  to demonstrate superiority of ofatumumab  based 
on ARR. A sample size of 900 patients  per study (driven by the 3mCDW endpoint),  under otherwise the  same 
assumptions  as  before,  would  provide  approximately  95%  power  for  the  demonstration  of  superiority  of 
ofatumumab over teriflunomide at a one-sided alpha level of 0.000625  (=0.0252)  using  the pooled data from 
2  studies  of  identical  design.  The  formula  proposed  by  Keene  et  al  (2007)  was  used  for  the  sample  size 
calculation for the  primary endpoint.

Figure 22 
The Applicant  designed the strategy to  control for multiplicity  based on the  approach presented by Brezt and 
Xi in Commentary on “Statistics  at the FDA:  Reflection on the  Past Six Years” (Statistics  in Biopharmaceutical 
Research, 2019,  vol 11).  Briefly, Bretz and  Xi proposed that  if the  primary endpoint  within  study  is met  and 
the  studies are homogenous, a secondary endpoint  could  be tested by  pooling the  data from the  two  studies 
(see figure from Bretz et al.).  
According  to  Brezt  and  Xi,  this  testing  strategy  controls  the  FWER  at  level  α  =  0.025  for  each  trial,  the 
submission-wise  error rate  (SWER)  at  level  α2  =  0.000625  for  the  primary endpoint  across both  trials  and 
achieves independent substantiation  at the submission level.  
However, the Applicant’s testing  situation  is different from that  presented in Brezt and Xi. The Applicant aims 
also to control  for multiplicity  key secondary endpoints within  each study  in addition  to the  pooled endpoints. 
In  other  words,  the  Applicant  aims  to  control  for  multiplicity  in  3  different  branches  simultaneously  (key 
secondary endpoints within  study and key secondary endpoints across studies). It is not clear that the current 
strategy  effectively  controls  for  multiplicity  across  all  key  secondary  endpoints.  Similar  concerns  were 
mentioned by the PEI in the SA received in 2016 “The considerations of the Sponsor regarding multiple testing 
are considered correct if the  success of each of the null hypothesis H3, H4 and H6 is only given if both studies 
rejected the  corresponding null  hypothesis,  i.e.  if  only “super  hypotheses” are considered. As  this  is  not  the 
case, i.e. a hypothesis can be rejected in  each of the studies irrespective of the results of the other study, this

leads  to  a  successful claim  and  continued  testing  within  that  respective study…Hence  the  Sponsor does  not 
look at  a sequence  of “super  hypothesis”  but  independent  hypothesis  within  each  study.  The  considerations 
under the global null,  as presented by the Sponsor are in general not  relevant for the family wise error control 
(which must  hold under arbitrary situations).  Thus, control of the  type I error within  each study and over both 
studies is considered doubtful.” 
The Biostatistics working party (BSWP) was consulted on the issue during the assessment. The BSWP expressed 
the opinion that in principle, the approach to a pooled analysis is acceptable and although the testing procedure 
can  be  criticized,  type  I  error is  controlled  for  the  primary  endpoint  ARR  in  the  individual  studies  and  the 
disability endpoint can be assessed at the  significance level achieved in the pooled study data.

Screening epoch 
A total  of 1277  patients  were screened, of whom  350 patients  (27.4%)  discontinued Screening epoch prior to 
the  randomisation for the primary reasons shown in  Table 10-1.  The most common reasons for discontinuing  
the Screening epoch were screen failures (n=325,  25.5%)  related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

A total of 927 patients were randomised into the study; 465  patients to the ofatumumab treatment group and 
462  patients  to  the  teriflunomide treatment  group (Table 10-2).  A total  of 416  patients  (89.5%)  randomised 
to  ofatumumab  completed  the  Treatment  epoch  compared  with  376  patients  (81.4%)  randomised  to 
teriflunomide.  In  total,  129  patients  (13.9%)  discontinued  from  the  Treatment  epoch.  The  most  common 
reasons for discontinuation  in the Treatment epoch were patient/guardian decision (6.3%)  and adverse event 
(3.0%). A higher proportion of patients in the teriflunomide treatment group (17.5%) discontinued prematurely 
from  the  Treatment  epoch  as  compared to  the  ofatumumab  treatment  group  (10.3%).  The  difference was 
mainly  due  to  discontinuation  for  patient/guardian  decision  (9.1%  vs  3.4%)  in  the  teriflunomide  treatment 
group  vs  the  ofatumumab  treatment  group.  Overall,  163  patients  (17.6%)  discontinued  study  drug 
(ofatumumab  14%  patients,  teriflunomide  21.2%  patients).  The  3  most  common  reasons for  discontinuing 
Assessment report

study  drugs  were:  patient/guardian  decision  (ofatumumab  4.9%  patients,  teriflunomide  8.2%  patients),  AE 
(ofatumumab 5.2% patients, teriflunomide 5.0% patients) and physician decision (ofatumumab 2.2% patients, 
teriflunomide  6.5%  patients).  The  Applicant  subsequently  discussed  the  higher  discontinuation  rate  in  the 
teriflunomide  arm, especially in the  categories “patient/guardian  decision”  and  “physician decision”  including 
an  evaluation  of  patient  characteristics  (SPMS,  patients  with  confirmed  disease  worsening,  patients  with 
protocol deviations). No obvious pattern of patient characteristics in terms of the selected aspects was observed 
for those who discontinued study  due to patient/guardian decision or due to physician decision. Investigators' 
comments  would  often  indicate  perceived lack  of  efficacy as  the  reason  behind  'patient/guardian  decision'. 
However, this  would not necessarily imply an 'objective' lack of efficacy.

Baseline  data 
The  study  population  consisted  of  a  broad  RMS  patient  population  as  it  included  a  substantial  number  of 
treatment-naïve  patients  (373  patients  [40.2%]),  as well  as  patients  with  EDSS scores at  screening ranging 
from  0-5.5,  and  55  patients  (5.9%)  of  the  population  having  SPMS  at  study  entry.  Treatment  groups  were 
balanced with  respect to  baseline data such as age, gender, duration of MS, EDSS etc.

Numbers analysed 
In total, 927  (100%) randomised patients  were included in the FAS and safety set (SAF) populations.  The FAS 
and  SAF  populations  for  this  study  happened  to  have  100%  overlap  because  all  patients  were  treated  as 
intended and hence were identical. The PPS population  included all FAS patients  who were compliant  with  the 
study  protocol;  864  (93.2%)  patients  were  included  in  this  population.  For  analyses performed on  the  PPS, 
only efficacy data assessed during the  on-treatment period was included. The FAS was used for the  summary 
of demography and baseline characteristics as well as for all efficacy analyses. The SAF was used for all safety 
analyses.  The  PPS  was  used  for  the  supportive  analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable and  selected  key 
secondary  variables.  A  PK  analysis  set  was  not  defined:  PK  analysis  were  performed  on  the  subset  of 
ofatumumab patients from the FAS.

Patients  treated  with  ofatumumab  experienced  90  confirmed  relapses  in  769  patient-years  of  exposure, 
compared with  teriflunomide  patients who  experienced 177 confirmed relapses in 741  patient-years. Analysis 
of the ARR using  a negative binomial model for confirmed relapses demonstrated a significantly lower ARR for 
the ofatumumab treatment group compared to the teriflunomide treatment  group, with  ARR estimates of 0.11 
vs 0.22, respectively. This corresponded to a statistically significant reduction of 50.5% in ARR estimates (ARR 
ratio 0.495,  p<0.001). 
Table 24 
The  analysis  of  all  relapses  (confirmed  and  unconfirmed)  showed  that  patients  treated  with  ofatumumab 
experienced a total of 122 all relapses in 769 patient-years of exposure, compared with teriflunomide patients 
who  experienced a total  of 234  relapses in  741  patient-years. Analysis of the  ARR for all relapses (confirmed 
and unconfirmed) demonstrated a rate reduction of 49.7% in  the ofatumumab vs the  teriflunomide treatment 
group (ARR ratio 0.503,  p<0.001)  in the FAS. 
A sensitivity  analysis was performed to investigate the  potential  impact of  missing not-at  random (MNAR)  on 
ARR estimates  and  treatment  effects on  ARR. The  ARR analysis accounts  for  missing  data during  the  period 
after premature study discontinuation  using different MNAR  imputations.

Characteristics of MS relapses 
Patients  treated  with  ofatumumab  experienced  90  confirmed  relapses  in  769  patient-years  of  exposure, 
compared with teriflunomide patients who experienced 177 confirmed relapses in 741 patient-years. See table 
below  for  the  characteristics  of  such  relapses (note  that  for  a  patient  with  multiple  relapses only  the  worst 
relapse is described in the table). 
Patients treated with ofatumumab had fewer relapses of moderate and severe severity, fewer relapses leading 
to  the  hospitalization,  and  fewer  relapses  requiring  steroid  treatment  compared  with  patients  treated  with 
teriflunomide.

**Last scan in the double blind treatment epoch 
The mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions (relative to  baseline) analysed by visit  window were lower in 
the  ofatumumab  treatment  group  than  in  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  at  Month  12  (1.4  ofatumumab, 
5.9 teriflunomide) and Month  24 (1.6  ofatumumab, 7.7 teriflunomide) in the FAS. 
Neurofilament  light chain 
Ofatumumab 20 mg was superior to teriflunomide 14  mg in reducing the  NfL concentration in serum at Month 
3 (and at all subsequent assessments). At Month  3, the first post-baseline assessment of NfL concentrations in 
serum  in  the  ofatumumab  vs  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  demonstrated  a  relative  reduction  in  NfL 
concentration  by  7%.  A  further  relative reduction  in  NfL  concentration  by  27%  at  Month  12  and  by 23%  at 
Month  24 in the  ofatumumab vs teriflunomide treatment group was observed. 
Brain volume loss 
The  rate  of  brain  volume  loss  appeared  similar  or  slightly  larger  in  the  ofatumumab  treatment  group  as 
compared to the teriflunomide treatment group.

ofatumumab versus teriflunomide in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (ASCLEPIOS I) 
Study identifier 
COMB157G2301 (EudraCT no. 2015-005418-31) 
Design 
Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator-controlled, parallel-group, 
multi-center  study  with  variable treatment  duration  in  patients  with  relapsing multiple 
sclerosis (MS) 
Duration of main phase: 
The  Treatment  epoch  was  variable  for  each  patient. 
Individual patients  were treated  until  the  End  of  Study 
(EOS)  was  declared  or  for  a  maximum  of  30  study 
months. The EOS was declared when, based on blinded 
data,  sufficient  data  became  available  to  provide  the  
required power  for  the  statistical  tests  for  the  primary 
endpoint (ARR) and for key secondary endpoints related 
to disability worsening (3mCDW, 6mCDW).  
Note:  The  Safety  follow-up  epoch  of  the  study  is  still 
ongoing.

Screening epoch 
A total  of 1280  patients  were screened, of whom  325 patients  (25.4%)  discontinued Screening epoch prior to 
randomisation for the  primary reasons shown  in Table 10-1.  The most  common reasons for discontinuing  the 
Screening epoch were screen failures (n=306,  23.9%)  based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.

A total of 955 patients were randomised into the study; 481 patients to the ofatumumab group and 474 patients 
to the teriflunomide group (Table 10-2).  A total of 397 patients (82.5%) randomised to ofatumumab compared 
with  389 patients (82.1%)  randomised to teriflunomide completed the Treatment epoch. In total, 167 patients 
(17.5%)  discontinued  from  the  Treatment  epoch.  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  in  the 
Treatment epoch were patient/guardian decision (7.6%)  and AE (3.0%). A similar proportion of patients in the 
teriflunomide  treatment  group (17.7%)  discontinued prematurely from the  Treatment  epoch as compared to 
the  ofatumumab  treatment  group  (17.3%).  Overall,  198  patients  (20.7%)  discontinued  study  drug 
(ofatumumab  20%  patients,  teriflunomide  21.5%  patients).  The  3  most  common  reasons for  discontinuing 
study  drugs  were:  patient/guardian  decision  (ofatumumab  7.3%  patients,  teriflunomide  7.8%  patients),  AE

from  0-5.5,  and  53  patients  (5.5%)  of  the  population  having  SPMS  at  study  entry.  Treatment  groups  were 
balanced with  respect to  baseline data such as age, gender, duration of MS, EDSS etc.

Numbers analysed 
In  total,  955  (100%)  randomised patients  were  included  in  the  FAS  and  SAF populations.  The FAS  and  SAF 
populations for this  study happened to  have 100%  overlap because all patients  were treated as intended and 
hence were identical.

The PPS population included all FAS patients who were compliant with the study protocol; 893 (93.5%)  patients 
were included  in  this  population.  For  analyses performed on the  PPS, only  efficacy data assessed during  the 
on-treatment  period  was  included.  The  FAS  was  used  for  the  summary  of  demography  and  baseline 
characteristics as well as for all efficacy analyses. The SAF was used for all safety analyses. The PPS was used 
for the supportive analyses of the primary efficacy variable and selected key secondary variables. A PK analysis 
set was not defined: PK analysis were performed on the  subset of ofatumumab patients from the FAS. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results 
Patients  treated  with  ofatumumab  experienced  95  confirmed  relapses  in  768  patient-years  of  exposure, 
compared with  teriflunomide  patients who  experienced 198 confirmed relapses in 750  patient-years. Analysis 
of the ARR using  a negative binomial model for confirmed relapses demonstrated a significantly lower ARR for 
the ofatumumab treatment group compared to the teriflunomide treatment  group, with  ARR estimates of 0.10 
vs 0.25, respectively. This corresponded to a statistically significant reduction of 58.5% in ARR estimates (ARR 
ratio 0.415,  p<0.001). 
Primary analysis 
Table 36 
The  analysis  of  all  relapses  (confirmed  and  unconfirmed)  showed  that  patients  treated  with  ofatumumab 
experienced a  total  of  131  relapses in  768  patient-years  of  exposure, compared  with  teriflunomide  patients 
who  experienced a total  of 250  relapses in  750  patient-years. Analysis of the  ARR for all relapses (confirmed 
and unconfirmed) demonstrated a rate reduction of 54.6% in  the ofatumumab vs the  teriflunomide treatment 
group (ARR ratio 0.454,  p<0.001)  in the FAS. 
A sensitivity  analysis was performed to investigate the  potential  impact of  missing not-at  random (MNAR)  on 
ARR estimates  and  treatment  effects on  ARR. The  ARR analysis accounts  for  missing  data during  the  period 
after premature study discontinuation  using different MNAR  imputations.

Characteristics of MS relapses 
Patients  treated  with  ofatumumab  experienced  95  confirmed  relapses  in  768  patient-years  of  exposure, 
compared with teriflunomide patients who experienced 198 confirmed relapses in 750 patient-years. See table 
below  for  the  characteristics  of  such  relapses (note  that  for  a  patient  with  multiple  relapses only  the  worst 
relapse is described in the table). 
Patients  treated with  ofatumumab had  fewer relapses across all severity levels, fewer relapses leading to  the 
hospitalization,  and  fewer  relapses  requiring  steroid  treatment  compared  with  patients  treated  with 
teriflunomide.

enlarging T2 lesions per year between baseline and  EOS (0.64  vs 4.15)  by 84.5%.  The mean number of new 
or  enlarging T2  lesions per  year  between  baseline  and  Month  12  (0.94  vs  4.41),  and  between  baseline and 
Month  24 (0.72 vs 3.72) were reduced in the ofatumumab vs the teriflunomide treatment group by 78.6% and 
80.6%,  respectively.

The mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions (relative to  baseline) analysed by visit  window were lower in 
the  ofatumumab  treatment  group  than  in  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  at  Month  12  (1.2  ofatumumab, 
5.8 teriflunomide) and Month  24 (1.3  ofatumumab, 8.1 teriflunomide) in the FAS. 
Neurofilament  light chain 
Ofatumumab 20 mg was superior to teriflunomide 14  mg in reducing the  NfL concentration in serum at Month 
3 (and at all subsequent assessments). At Month  3, the first post-baseline assessment of NfL concentrations in 
serum  in  the  ofatumumab  vs  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  demonstrated  a  relative  reduction  in  NfL 
concentration  by 11%.  A further  relative reduction in  NfL  concentration by 26%  at Month  12  and by  24%  at 
Month  24 in the  ofatumumab vs teriflunomide treatment group was observed. 
Brain volume loss 
The  rate  of  brain  volume  loss  appeared  similar  or  slightly  larger  in  the  ofatumumab  treatment  group  as 
compared to the teriflunomide treatment group.

*Disability-related key secondary efficacy endpoints (i.e. 3mCDW, 6mCDW and 6mCDI) were analysed based on a pre-specified analysis 
of the combined data for the two studies COMB157G2301 and COMB157G2302. Results shown here are based on the analysis of the 
combined data. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses  and meta-analysis) 
A  meta-analysis  was  performed  combining  data  from  studies  2301  and  2302  with  the  primary  purpose  to 
evaluate the pre-defined disability-related key secondary study objectives. 
The key disability-related objectives were to evaluate if ofatumumab 20 mg SC every 4 weeks was superior to 
teriflunomide 14 mg p.o. once daily on the following efficacy measures: 
1.  Time to disability worsening as measured by 3mCDW on the EDSS 
2.  Time to disability worsening as measured by 6mCDW on EDSS 
3.  Time to disability improvement as measured by 6mCDI on EDSS

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Demonstration of the  clinical efficacy of ofatumumab 20  mg  SC vs. teriflunomide in  patients  with  active RMS 
was based on two randomised 1:1 double-blind double-dummy Phase III studies of identical design (2301 and 
2302). The treatment duration for an individual patient was variable. End of Study (EOS) was declared for both 
studies  simultaneously  based  on  an  analysis  of  blinded  data  and  a  projection  by  when  all  pre-specified 
conditions  would  be  met.  The  maximal  treatment  duration  for  an  individual  patient  was  30  study  months 
(approximately  2.5  years).  The  design  is  considered  acceptable  and  the  Sponsor  had  in  place  adequate 
measures to protect the blinding  of the  study. 
The studies were designed before the publication of the ICH E9 addendum. However, the Applicant defined the 
estimand’s  attributes  of  the  studies  to  facilitate  the  review  of  this  marketing  authorisation  application.  The 
Applicant  compared  the  treatment  effect  in  term  of  annualized  relapse  rate  between  ofatumumab  and 
teriflunomide regardless of treatment discontinuation  or short treatment to alleviate the symptoms of relapses. 
This estimand is considered of clinical relevance and is endorsed. 
The patient population consisted of adult patients with  RMS, activity as evidenced by relapses or MRI findings, 
and an EDSS score of 0-5.5.  The patient population  in clinical studies should be guiding  the future clinical use 
and indication  in SmPC, also in  line with  similar products. Both RRMS and 'active SPMS' patients  were eligible 
but  no minimum number of SPMS patients  was prespecified. The rationale for including  both RRMS and SPMS 
patients with no minimum number defined and assumption of similar treatment effect for 3mCDW and 6mCDW 
in all subgroups presents some challenges for the analyses and the interpretation of results. 
The choice of teriflunomide as active comparator is accepted and in accordance with  previous scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/1049/6/FU/1/2016/II).  The primary endpoint (ARR) for each study is considered relevant. As for 
the  key secondary endpoints  the  most  important  should have  been not  the  3mCDW but  the  6mCDW  as per 
guideline  and  multiple  scientific  advices  (e.g.  EMEA/H/SA/1049/6/FU/1/2016/II).  The  secondary  endpoints 
appear reasonable. 
The  studies  were  planned  in  order  to  allow  for  pooling  of  the  data  in  order  to  achieve reasonable power  to 
detect a treatment effect in the disability endpoints. Therefore, the sample size calculations are primarily driven 
by the  pooling  of  the  disability  endpoints.  Of note,  the  sample size  calculation  assumed the  same treatment 
effect in RRMS and SPMS for 3mCDW and 6mCDW  
The efficacy analyses were performed using the  FAS, which  included all randomized patients  according to  the 
assigned treatment.  This is endorsed. 
The statistical methods used to analyse the endpoints are overall considered adequate. The ARR was estimated 
using a negative binomial model with log-link. The covariates of the model were treatment and region, number 
of relapses in previous year, baseline EDSS, baseline number of Gd-enhancing lesions and the patient’s  age at 
baseline. The response variable was  the  number of  confirmed relapses in  the  treatment  epoch observed and 
the patient’s time in study was used as an offset variable. This model assumes that the relapse rate is constant 
within patient. Patients who discontinued the study contributed only with the observed time and it was assumed 
that the relapse rate for those patients would not  be affected by treatment discontinuation  (missing at random 
assumption).  The validity of the  assumption was not  discussed by the Applicant. However, several sensitivity 
and  supportive analyses were planned to  assess the  robustness  of the  results  and  departures from the  MAR 
assumption. The number of Gd-lesions and the number of new or enlarging T2 per MRI-scan will be compared 
Assessment report

using a negative binomial regression model with log-link.  The geometric mean of NfL concentration of the two 
treatment arms was compared at month 3 using a mixed model for repeated measures, which assumes missing 
at random. A random coefficients model was used in the main analysis for brain volume loss, which is agreed. 
The disability endpoints  (3mCDW, 6mCDW and 6mCDI) were analysed using a Cox-model stratified by study. 
The variables of the model were treatment, region and baseline EDSS. Between study heterogeneity was tested 
using a Cox-model including a treatment-by-study interaction. Patients who did not experience an event during 
observation were censored. It is not  considered adequate to  apply the non-informative censoring assumption 
in  the  primary  analysis.  However,  sensitivity  analyses  were  presented challenging  this  assumption  and  are 
endorsed. 
The  main  methodological  concern  regards  the  procedure  implemented  to  control  for  multiplicity  for  the 
secondary endpoints.  There is  no  established methodological approach to  control  for multiplicity  in  a pooling 
set-up.  While planning  of  the analyses adds credibility to  the  results, this  does not  guarantee that  the  type I 
error is overall controlled. The Applicant aims to control for multiplicity in 3  different branches simultaneously. 
If the  primary endpoint  within  study  is  met,  the  alpha would  be transferred to  the  secondary endpoints  in  a 
hierarchical fashion. If both primary endpoints were met, the pooled endpoints would be tested with significance 
level α -  α2. Type I error is controlled for the primary endpoint ARR in the individual studies and the disability 
endpoint can be assessed at the significance level achieved in the  pooled study data,  however it is not  clear if 
the current strategy effectively controls for multiplicity for other key secondary endpoints.  
As a note, aspects of the  clinical investigational plan  (inclusion of SPMS patients,  median treatment  duration, 
choice of 3mCDW  as most  important secondary endpoint,  and the  loading dose regimen) were questioned  in 
the 2016  scientific advice but no changes appear to have been subsequently implemented by the Applicant. 
The choice of the  final  dose for pivotal studies  is not  entirely clear. The dosing  regimen with  an initial  20  mg 
SC of  ofatumumab every week for a first  3  week, following  a  maintenance administration  of 20  mg SC from 
week 4 is based on study OMS112831.  Replacing 60 mg initial dose with  3 weekly doses of 20 mg was a result 
of  better  tolerability  profile  observed in  Phase  II  (with  doses  of  ofatumumab  below  30  mg).  20  mg  SC  is 
perceived as a dose regimen being  the lowest  to assure reliable and constant  B-cell depletion in  MS  patients. 
It  was also approved by  the EMA  before starting  Phase III studies.  The results of  the dose response analysis 
show that  the  cumulative dose of 60  mg ofatumumab administered over 12  weeks provided maximal benefit, 
with  no additional  suppression  of GdE  T1  lesions at  higher  cumulative doses.  The  OMS112831  study  did  not 
show significant differences in clinical efficacy e.g., between doses, even though the rate of depletion of B cells 
was different (e.g.,  for a 60  mg dose administered every 4  and 12  weeks). Also, the analysis after 24  weeks 
showed that  the efficacy of ofatumumab concerning the cumulative number of new GdET1 Lesions (Week 24) 
administered at 3 mg every 12 weeks, 30 mg every 12 weeks and 60 mg every 4 weeks is almost identical.  In 
addition,  the use of a lower maintenance dose, 10 mg, gives only a marginal reduction  in drug concentration, 
there are no data from the clinical trial on AAR and other efficacy parameters, and the modelling of CD19+ cell 
level reduction has been assumed to be equivalent to efficacy. In this context, the Applicant's explanations are 
not  entirely  convincing,  but  given  the  favourable  safety  profile  of  the  dose  used  in  the  G2301  and  G2302 
studies, the rationale regarding the use of the dose of 20 mg, can be accepted. 
Efficacy data  and additional analyses 
Both studies 2301 and 2302  met the primary endpoint with  clinically relevant ARR reductions of 50.5% (study 
2301)  and  58.5%  (study  2302),  respectively. Sensitivity  and  supportive  analyses  were consistent  with  the 
results of the primary analysis.

In  the combined  data  from studies  2301  and  2302  the  risk of  6mCDW  and  3mCDW  was reduced  by  32.5% 
(6mCDW) and 34.4% (3mCDW), respectively. 
Regarding the MRI endpoints,  ofatumumab reduced the  number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions by 97.5%  (study 
2301)  and 93.8%  (study  2302),  respectively. The number of new  or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced with  a 
rate reduction of 81.9%  (study 2301)  and 84.5% (study 2302),  respectively. 
No difference in the annual BVL was demonstrated. 
In  both  studies,  serum  NfL  concentrations  were  reduced  at  Month  3  and  in  all  subsequent  assessments. 
However,  although  interesting  from  a  scientific  point  of  view,  the  clinical  and  prognostic  relevance  of  NfL 
measurements remains uncertain. 
Subgroup analyses suggest larger effect size in young patients and in patients with  mild disease. No studies in 
patients  older  than  56  years  were  conducted.  Extrapolation  to  older  individuals  should  be  justified  as  also 
mentioned in the Clinical Pharmacology section. The point estimate for the SPMS subgroup was approximately 
similar to that  of RRMS although this  should be interpreted with  caution since the SPMS group was very small 
and 95% CI was extending beyond 1. 
Only one dose level was tested  in  Phase III. In the  Phase II MIRROR study (OMS112831)  all doses tested  (3 
mg, 30 mg, 60 mg) led to the same (65%) reduction in the cumulative number of new Gd-enhancing T1 lesions 
compared to  placebo, however, a dose-dependent increase in  efficacy was shown  after excluding the  initial  4 
weeks data. Although the mentioned studies have explored different doses of ofatumumab, the dose-response 
relationship has not been fully elucidated. 
At the Oral Explanation, the Applicant has presented analyses in patients with different baseline characteristics 
including analyses for newly diagnosed naïve patients and analyses based on time since last relapse.  
Newly diagnosed DMT naive patients were included in  the studies  as far as they fulfilled the  inclusion criteria, 
including  recent  evidence of  activity. In  newly diagnosed  patients  if active,  the  benefits seem comparable to 
the ones observed in the  overall population studied (see Table below).

For patients  with  less recent activity, the analyses presented (see below)  do not demonstrate a lower level of 
efficacy. 
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  at  least  75%  of  patients  had  a  relapse  within  the  prior  8.2  months  of 
enrollment in  the  Asclepios I and  II according to  the  subgroup analyses based on time  since last  relapse (Q4 
defined as  time>8.2  months  using  P75 of  the  distribution).  This  is  in  line  with  inclusion  criteria requiring  the 
documentation of at least one of the following: (i) 1 relapse during the previous 1 year OR (ii) 2 relapses during 
the  previous 2  years prior  to  Screening  OR  (ii)  a  positive  Gd-enhancing  MRI  scan  during  the  year  prior  to 
randomisation. Given the eligibility criteria, patients not meeting the “activity criterion” were not appropriately 
represented in the study. Hence, a conclusion on the magnitude of effect in patients not meeting the “activity” 
criterion cannot be drawn, but  the benefit is assumed to be smaller due to the lower counterfactual risk. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  (of  ofatumumab  20  mg  SC  vs.  teriflunomide)  on  relapses  in  active  RMS  was  demonstrated  in  two 
identical confirmatory studies of adequate design. The magnitude of the effect in a population not fulfilling the 
activity criteria at baseline has not  been demonstrated, but  it can be assumed to be smaller due to the smaller 
counterfactual risk.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient  exposure 
At  the  time  of  finalization  of  safety summary, 2499  patients  with  MS  have been  treated  in  blinded  or open-
label studies  in  the  ofatumumab MS  clinical  program, which  consists  of 2  ongoing  studies  (Study G1301  and 
Study G2399),  2 pivotal Phase-III studies (Study G2301 and Study G2302, Pool C2, n=1882) and 3 supportive 
Phase-II studies:  one  SC PK bioequivalence study  (Study  G2102),  one SC efficacy study  (Study  OMS112831 
or Pool C1),  one IV dose finding  study (Study  OMS115102  or Pool C0).  After exclusion of  patients in  ongoing 
studies  G1301  and  G2399,  1497  patients  remained  in  the  group  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
ofatumumab,  any  dose.  The  Applicant  has  excluded  safety  data  from  other  indications  (such  as  chronic 
lymphocytic  leukemia  (CLL),  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD), 
pemphigus vulgaris (PV)) in the analyses for this application. 
The primary source of safety data with ofatumumab 20 mg SC (Pool L2), in the RMS target population, consists 
of the  two pivotal Phase-III studies  (main SAF or Pool C2) with  supportive data from Phase-II bioequivalence 
study  with  autoinjector  and  prefilled  syringes  for  administration  (Study  G2102).  Number  of  all  MS  patients 
exposed to  20  mg SC formulation  of ofatumumab  in  the clinical  program is  1230  (94.4%  of  those are RRMS 
patients); with  946  patients from phase III pivotal studies (40.8 % of those are treatment  naïve patients) and 
284  from study G2102.  The approaches for pooling the  safety data in Pool C2 and Pool L2 are reasonable and 
appropriate.  In  main  SAF,  the  demographics  and  exposure are  adequately  described,  and  study  arms  are 
balanced  at  baseline  with 
regards 
to  age,  gender, 
race,  body  composition,  and 
“disease 
characteristics/predictors/treatments”.  The  safety  package  in  phase  III  studies  and  amount  of  exposure  to 
ofatumumab  20  mg  SC  dose  is  considered  adequate  for  characterization  of  the  short-term  safety  of 
ofatumumab 20 mg SC in  RMS patients.  
In small subset of patients who had a diagnosis of active SPMS at baseline, the patients were older (~45 years), 
had the  disease for longer (~10  years), were more disabled (mean EDSS>4.5), had a substantially higher T2 
lesion load on MRI (mean ~20  mm3),  and a higher proportion of patients  (>70%)  had previously received at 
least  one  other  DMT  before  entry  into  the  G2301  and  G2302  studies  compared  with  RRMS  patients.  Total 
exposure  (patient-years)  was  proportionately  higher  in  patients  with  RRMS  in  both  treatment  groups 
(ofatumumab,  1400.6  patient-years;  teriflunomide,  1321.7  patient  years)  compared  with  those  with  SPMS 
(ofatumumab, 86.1  patient years; teriflunomide, 76.1 patient  years). 
The  choice  of  active  comparator  in  main  SAF  is  acceptable  with  the  caveat  of  unblinding  risk  for  some 
patients/investigators due to injection-related AEs. However, the fact that teriflunomide has its own side effect 
profile as an immune-modulating agent and there are certain monitoring rules which  are both clearly reflected 
in  its  SmPC and  Risk Management Plan  (RMP), should  be kept in  mind  during  the evaluation of  safety profile 
for ofatumumab in  comparison to teriflunomide, especially in case of AEs/ serious AE (SAEs) which are similar 
between groups and have monitoring  or risk management measures specified in teriflunomide SmPC/RMP. 
Long-term  safety  data  have  been  collected  in  accordance  with  requirements  of  ICH  E1  guidance 
(CPMP/ICH/375/95).  In  main SAF,  832  patients  were exposed to  ofatumumab 20mg  SC over 48  weeks, and 
312  patients  were exposed over 96  weeks. In  this  pool, 85.9%  (813)  of patients  completed the  double-blind 
treatment epoch while 13.8% (131)  discontinued from the treatment epoch and 17% discontinued study drug. 
The number of patients  exposed for more than 1 year were sufficient. Further  long-term safety and tolerability 
data  in  patients  with  MS  will  be  available  after  receiving  results  of  the  ongoing  study  G2399  which  is  not 
included  in  this  submission.  Study  G2399  is  an  extension  study  which  enrolled patients  from Study  G2301, 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 117/138 
 
 
 
Study  G2302,  Study  G2102,  and Study  G1301  who  have transitioned  and  therefore have not  been followed 
further in  the  original studies.  A listing  of  SAEs available at  the time  of the  submission cut-off  date  (15-Nov-
2019)  is provided in the  appendix and includes  SAEs such as myocardial infarction,  acute heart failure, CIDP, 
acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, depression, suicide attempt,  emotional distress. 
Adverse events 
Overview of adverse events in main SAF  does not  signal an  imbalance between treatment  arms in number of 
AEs, despite a higher frequency noted in ofatumumab group for SAEs and AEs leading to drug discontinuation.  
However,  in  the  supportive  analyses  significantly  higher  number  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events 
(TEAEs),  SAEs, AEs  leading to  drug  discontinuation  is reported for  ofatumumab.  Specifically, in  Pool  C1,  the 
incidence  of  SAEs in  the  ofatumumab  group  was  3%,  no  SAEs  were  reported in  the  placebo  group,  and  all 
withdrawals from the study treatment (3 patients,  1%) were due to injection-related reactions with the 60-mg 
dose regimens. Therefore, phase III studies included  a loading dose of 20 mg given three times  weekly which 
was preferred over a loading dose of 60 mg given every 4 weeks due to more AEs/SAEs associated with 60 mg 
dose (in  particular post-injection  systemic reactions reported as SAEs on day 1).  
The  long-term  safety  profile  of  ofatumumab  in  clinical  use  for  MS  patients  with  proposed  dosing  regimen, 
loading  regimen  and  cumulative  exposure  is  unknown,  so  all  the  treatment  emergent  adverse events  are 
considered  to  be  potentially  clinically  important,  despite  the  small  number  of  patients  in  some  groups  in 
supplementary  analyses.  Despite  the  differences  of  patient  population  and  dosing  in  other  indications,  a 
summary of  studies  in  RA indication  did  not  reveal any  new  safety signals  compared to  Arzerra. In  RA,  the 
higher burden of infusion reactions and anaphylactic reactions is due to the mode of administration (IV), higher 
doses and the initial lack of a standardized and effective premedication regimen. The most frequently reported 
infection  AEs  are  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  urinary  tract  infection,  nasopharyngitis,  and  rhinitis. 
Neoplasms occurred in 0.2%  patients  (1 patient)  of the  ‘All’ OMB157  group and in  1.4% patients  (4 patients) 
of the placebo group. One patient of the OMB157 700-mg group was diagnosed with breast cancer (PT serious, 
grade 4)  3  months  after the  first  cycle of study  drug.  The incidence of  neutropenia events was  2.9%  overall 
and  none  in  300mg,  4,5%  in  700mg,  13%  in  1000/700mg  groups,  showing  a  dose  dependent  increase 
tendency.   
In  main  SAF  for  RMS,  the  most  frequently  reported  exposure adjusted  TEAEs  by  PT  were  injection-related 
reaction  (ofatumumab,  20.6%;  teriflunomide,  15.3%)  followed  by  nasopharyngitis  (ofatumumab,  18.0%; 
teriflunomide,  16.7%),  headache  (ofatumumab,  13.3%;  teriflunomide,  12.4%),  injection  site  reaction 
(ofatumumab,  10.9%;  teriflunomide, 5.6%)  and all  had OR >1.  Other  common TEAEs included  but  were not 
limited  to  urinary  tract  infection,  back  pain,  influenza,  blood  IgM  decreased,  arthralgia,  anxiety,  dizziness, 
insomnia,  pyrexia, oropharyngeal pain,  pharyngitis,  gastroenteritis,  rhinitis,  constipation,  vertigo,  muscular 
weakness, viral  upper respiratory tract  infection,  influenza  like  illness,  migraine, blood  creatinine  increased, 
cystitis. Exposure adjusted adverse event profile in pool C1 seems to be similar to  main analysis pool in terms 
of  most  frequently reported  AEs  but  also  has  similarities  with  Pool  C0  and  study  G2102  (the  studies  with  iv 
infusion and/or higher doses of ofatumumab and data not shown here).  
In active SPMS sub-group of main SAF, 8 (14.3%) patients in the ofatumumab group and 4 (7.7%) patients in 
the  teriflunomide group experienced at least one SAE. Overall percentage of patients  with  infections  in RRMS 
(OFA 463 (52.0%),  TER 473 (53.5%))  or active SPMS (OFA 25 (44.6%),  TER 20 (38.5%))  groups were similar 
between  two  treatment  arms,  with  a  possible  difference in  herpes viral  infections  (OFA  4  (7.1%)  vs  TER  1 
(1.9%))  which  were  more frequent  in  ofatumumab  group  in  the  overall results  (OFA  42  (4.7%)  vs TER  38 
Assessment report

(4.3%)).  In contrast to RRMS group (OFA 7 (0.8%),  TER 30 (3.4%)),  neutropenia events were more common 
with  ofatumumab and at a similar level to teriflunomide in active SPMS group (OFA 2 (3.6%),  TER 2 (3.8%)).
In  Pool L2,  which  consists  of only  ofatumumab  20mg SC treated  patients,  of the  953  patients  (77.5%)  who 
experienced AEs, 83 patients  (6.7%) experienced grade 3-4 AEs. The most frequently reported grade 3-4 AEs 
was  appendicitis  (8,  0.7%),  urinary tract  infection  (4,  0.3%),  decreased blood  immunoglobulin  M  (IgM)  (7, 
0.6%),  and  injection-related reaction  (3,  0.2%).  Other  grade 3-4  AEs occurring in  two  patients  each  (0.2%) 
were  back  pain,  cholecystitis,  depression, foot  fracture,  gastroenteritis,  influenza,  neutropenia,  pneumonia, 
and tibia  fracture. Limited  number of SAEs from ongoing  studies listed in  appendix also show similarities with 
some of grade 3-4  AEs reported above. 
It is noted  that some of the most frequently reported grade 3-4 AEs are in line with  the identified  or potential 
risks in Arzerra SmPC or RMP,  thus occurring even at much lower doses. All adverse events known for Arzerra 
and  available data  from  prior  clinical  studies  in  non-oncology  indications  (RA,  PV,  COPD),  were  taken  into 
consideration  when  evaluating  the  overall  safety  profile  of  ofatumumab  in  MS  patients.  Such  potentially 
important  risks from Arzerra include ‘Infusion  reactions, including  cytokine release syndrome’, ‘HBV  infection 
and  reactivation’, ‘Cardiovascular events’,  ‘Neutropenia’  ‘Cytopenia (excluding  neutropenia)’,  ‘Infections  with 
PML,  ‘Severe mucocutaneous  reactions’, ‘Effects  on  immunizations,  including  interactions  with  live vaccines’, 
‘Immunogenicity’. 
Adverse events  of special interest 
Analyses of  adverse events of  special interest  (AESI) revealed that  clinically  important  potential  events such 
as injection-related  reactions, upper respiratory tract  infections,  urinary infections,  herpes or  varicella-zoster 
infections,  or  suicidal  ideation/behaviour  were  more  common  in  the  ofatumumab  group  than  in  the  active 
comparator group. 
In line with  the  safety profile described for anti-CD20  mAbs, the  main safety issues with  ofatumumab are the 
risk  of  injection  related  reactions,  infections,  decreased  ability  to  mount  an  immune  response  to  live  or 
attenuated  vaccines, coupled with  the potential  for infection following  the administration  of live vaccines, and 
decreased IgM levels. Vaccines and immunoglobulin  levels are discussed later.  
Injection-related reactions  
Injection-related reactions with  ofatumumab  20  mg SC are “very common” AEs  in  SmPC and  an  “identified” 
risk in  RMP.  
Injection-related reactions are common with  the  first and second ofatumumab injection  and requires the  first 
injection of ofatumumab to be given under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They comprise systemic 
reactions (e.g. fever, other systemic symptoms, headache, chills,  myalgia, fatigue), 20.2%  and  injection-site 
reactions  (e.g.  erythema/redness, other  site  symptoms,  pain,  induration/swelling,  warmth,  itching),  10.8%. 
They appear to  be independent of the administered dose and may not be predicted on beforehand.  
Pre-treatment is  not  recommended. Steroids may reduce the  frequency of  fever, myalgia, chills,  and  nausea 
but conversely increase the occurrence of flushing, chest discomfort, hypertension, tachycardia and abdominal 
pain.  If  injection-related  reactions  occurred,  they  have  been  reported  to  be  manageable.  However,  in 
supplementary  pools  there  had  been  SAEs  such  as  cytokine  release  syndrome,  angioedema/urticaria  or 
injection related reaction (IRR) events leading to withdrawal with  higher doses than  20 mg SC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 119/138 
 
 
 
 
 
In  Study  G2102,  IRRs  appear  to  be  influenced  by site  of  administration.  However,  this  difference was  not 
confirmed in  phase III studies,  where there were no  differences in  occurrence of injection  systemic reactions 
at three sites (upper arm=13.3%,  thigh=16.4%,  abdomen=14.8%; Overall=14.4%). 
Infections (including opportunistic  infections) 
A  risk  of  infection,  including  opportunistic  infections,  is  associated  with  the  use  of  any  anti-CD20  biological 
product (including  ofatumumab) depleting B-cells and thereby lowering immunoglobulins.  
The overall proportion of patients  with  infections  was similar in  the  ofatumumab group and the  teriflunomide 
treatment group (teriflunomide SmPC includes a contraindication for use in patients with severe active infection 
until  resolution  and  warnings  on  this  topic).  The  most  commonly reported  infections  included  but  were  not 
limited to nasopharyngitis (18.0%),  upper respiratory tract infection (10.3%),  urinary tract infection (10.3%), 
and influenza (6.6%).  The occurrence of new or reactivated herpes infections, including ophthalmic infections, 
was increased in the ofatumumab group (46, 4.9% vs 39, 4.2% in the ofatumumab and teriflunomide groups). 
There  were  no  observed  cases  of  PML,  cryptococcal  infections,  reactivation  of  hepatitis  in  MS  studies  and 
following patients were excluded from clinical studies: history of PML;  risk of developing or having reactivation 
of hepatitis, syphilis or tuberculosis; impaired immune response including PML, hepatitis, syphilis, tuberculosis, 
acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome;  chronic  disease  of  the  immune  system  other  than  MS;  significantly 
impaired bone marrow function  or significant  anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia.  
“Serious infections,  including  opportunistic  infections  (e.g., PML,  HBV reactivation)” is  an  important  potential 
risk in RMP  and characterizes the  serious infections  related to decrease in  immunoglobulins and  lymphopenia 
or neutropenia. Furthermore,  appendicitis being reported in  1% of  the population  and more frequently in  the 
ofatumumab group was included in  this broadened important  potential risk of serious infections,  to be further 
characterised in Post Authorisation Safety Studies (PASS) and monitored and reported in the future PSURs. 
Malignancy or pre-malignant disorders 
There was not  an increased frequency of malignancy or pre-malignant  disorders with  ofatumumab compared 
to teriflunomide in the clinical trial experience with RMS patients. However, the time on the study and/or follow-
up was short with regards to the development of neoplasms and sustained depletion of B-cells might affect the 
immune  system´s ability to  detect  and eliminate  cancer cells thus  leading to  an  increased risk of  developing 
solid tumours. Since the risk of malignancy is known to be increased with use of some other agents that affect 
the immune system (e.g. malignancies including breast cancer is included in AEs for ocrelizumab or skin cancers 
with  sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators), the currently available data do not exclude that a similar risk apply 
to  longer-term treatment with  ofatumumab. The risk of malignancy is included  as an important  potential  risk 
in the RMP and active malignancies is included as a contraindication in SmPC. 
Serious adverse  events  and deaths 
No deaths were reported during treatment with  ofatumumab in main SAF or supplementary pools. 
The  total  number  of  patients  reporting  SAEs  in  Pool  C2  was  slightly  higher  in  the  ofatumumab  group 
(ofatumumab:  86,  9.1%;  teriflunomide:  74,  7.9%).  The most  frequently reported SAE  by SOC (incidences ≥ 
2%  of  patients)  in  both  treatment  groups  was  ‘infections  and  ‘infestations’  (ofatumumab:  24,  2.5%; 
teriflunomide: 17,  1.8%). The higher rate in the  ofatumumab group compared to teriflunomide was driven by 
appendicitis reported in 8 patients  (0.8%).   
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 120/138 
 
 
 
In  the  ofatumumab  group,  other  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  following  SOCs  (incidences  ≥ 1.0%):  ‘injury, 
poisoning  and  procedural  complications’  (ofatumumab:  13,  1.4%;  teriflunomide:  9,  1.0%),  ‘psychiatric 
disorders’ (ofatumumab, 10, 1.1%; teriflunomide, 2, 0.2%), and ‘neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(including  cysts and polyps)’ (ofatumumab: 9, 1.0%; teriflunomide: 4,  0.4%).   
Pulmonary sarcoidosis was reported in 2 patients  and grade-3 serious injection-related reaction was reported 
in one patient in the  ofatumumab group. 
The proportion  of patients  who  discontinued study  drug  due to  an SAE was  higher in  ofatumumab group  (11 
patients,  1.2%  in the  ofatumumab group  and 8 patients,  0.8%  in  the teriflunomide  group). Eight  patients  on 
ofatumumab, 0.8% and seven patients  on teriflunomide, 0.7%  experienced grade-4 SAEs. 
SAEs  in  the  supplementary  studies  were  similar  to  the  main  SAF  with  highest  frequency  of  SAEs  in 
injection/infusion  related reactions and  infections categories. High  frequency of SAEs reported after  initiation 
of  therapy  resulted  in  a  change  in  loading  regimen with  ofatumumab  to  current  regimen used  in  phase  III 
studies. In  Pool C1,  there were 3 additional  events to  be noted, all  in 60mg  dosing groups and each reported 
by 1 subject: cytokine release syndrome, cholelithiasis and hypokalaemia. 
Laboratory findings 
Cytopenia, including prolonged and late-onset neutropenia, have been reported during ofatumumab therapy in 
other indications  and  included in  Arzerra RMP  as identified  or potential  risks in the  form of  ‘Neutropenia’ and 
‘Cytopenia (excluding neutropenia)’. In ofatumumab group of main SAF, the  overall incidence of neutropenia-
related AEs was 1.0%  compared to 3.4% in teriflunomide group, the patients with  at least 2 consecutive post-
baseline worsening of grade ≥ 1 in neutrophil  or lymphocyte counts  were respectively 2.6%  (26 patients)  and 
1.5% (14 patients) in the ofatumumab group and 17.4% (162 patients) and 1.3% (12 patients) in teriflunomide 
group; despite close monitoring  and measures in place in  clinical trial  environment 8  patients  in ofatumumab 
group  (0.8%)  and  71  patients  (7.6%)  in  teriflunomide  group  reported any AE  term  from the  ‘infection’  SOC 
post-first-grade worsening of neutropenia and 8 patients  in ofatumumab group (0.8%)  and 6 patients (0.6%) 
in  teriflunomide  group  reported  any  AE  term  from  the  ‘infection’  SOC  post-first-grade  worsening  of 
lymphopenia; in the  ofatumumab group, 3 patients  reported SAE including  a neutropenic sepsis, and 1  grade 
3  AE  led  to  discontinuation.  In  the  Pool  L2,  overall  incidence  of  cytopenia-related  AEs  was  2.3%  with 
ofatumumab 20 mg SC Cytopenia including neutropenia is considered highly clinically relevant and is addressed 
in  RMP  as  a  potential  risk. The  physician is  recommended to  evaluate  the  patient’s  immune  status  prior  to 
initiating therapy and Ofatumumab must not be given to patients in a severely immunocompromised state (e.g. 
significant neutropenia or lymphopenia).  
In line  with  the  mechanism of action of  ofatumumab, B-cell depletion was  achieved after 1  week in  >75%  of 
the  patients  during the  initial  loading regimen of ofatumumab  (3 weekly 20  mg doses at Day 7,  Day 14,  and 
Day 21).  A  median time  to  B  cell  recovery of  24.6  weeks  post  treatment  discontinuation  is  predicted  which 
requires vigilance for infection for patients under risk throughout  this period. 
In the majority of patients,  IgM levels decreased. In Pool C2, in the  ofatumumab group, a decrease of 30.9% 
(-0.420  g/L)  in mean IgM values from baseline was experienced by Week 48 completers (824 patients) and a 
decrease of  38.8%  (-0.537  g/L)  was  experienced  by  Week  96  completers  (304  patients).  Treatment  with 
ofatumumab resulting in a decrease in IgM that  reached a value below 0.34 g/dL, more than 10% of LLN, was 
observed in 14.3% of patients, while a decrease of more than 30% or 50% of LLN was observed for respectively 
3.8% or 2.1% of patients. Decreased blood IgM was amongst the most frequently reported grade 3-4  AEs and 
was 
the  most 
frequently  reported  AE 
leading 
to  withdrawal  of  study  drug.  Immunoglobulin

decrease/abnormality was reported as AEs leading to  withdrawal  for 35  patients  in  Pool C2 (3.7%)  out  of  54 
patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs  (5.7%).  Additionally,  55  patients  (5.8%)  reported 
immunoglobulin decrease as AEs leading to treatment interruption (out of 9.1% of the patients in ofatumumab 
group who had treatment interruption  due to AEs). In Pool C2, in the ofatumumab group, a decrease of 4.3%  
(-0.435  g/L) in mean IgG values from baseline was experienced by Week 48 completers (824 patients) and an 
increase of 2.2% (+0.249  g/L) was experienced by Week 96  completers (304 patients). 
Vital  signs  in  which  patients  in  the  ofatumumab  group  experienced ≥ 5%  difference relative to  teriflunomide 
group were pulse rate <60  bpm (+6.0%)  and increase of ≥ 7% from baseline weight (+9.6%).   
Cardiovascular events are known as identified risk for Arzerra and other CD20-mAbs, including both acute IRRs 
and non-IRR related events. In the Pool C2, overall 26 patients  (2.7%) in ofatumumab group reported cardiac 
disorder  AE  compared  to  33  patients  (3.5%)  in  teriflunomide  group;  in  the  ofatumumab  group,  8  patients 
(0.8%)  reported  within  24  hours  of  injection  administration  whereas  19  patients  (2.0%)  beyond  24  hours 
reported cardiac disorder AEs compared to 12 patients (1.3)  within 24 hours of injection administration and 24 
patients (2.6%) beyond 24 hours reported cardiac disorder AEs in teriflunomide group. Tachycardia (6 patients, 
0.6%)  is the  only AE that  occurred within  24  hours of injection administration  and reported in more than one 
patient. The proportion of patients with AEs related to cardiac arrhythmia was 0.4% vs 0.5% in the ofatumumab 
and  teriflunomide  groups.  In  the  ofatumumab  group,  1  patient  (0.1%)  reported  an  AE  related  to  cardiac 
arrhythmia within  24  hours  of injection  administration  compared to  3  patients  (0.3%)  beyond 24  hours.  For 
the  patient  who reported an AE  in less than  24  hours in  the ofatumumab  group, a non-serious, and grade-2, 
atrioventricular block second degree occurred on Day 757. In Study G2102, one patient  reported a non-serious 
grad-1 sinus arrhythmia on Day 85,  within  24 hours of injection administration. 
Other 
laboratory  parameters  (not  discussed  above) 
including  clinical  chemistry,  urinalysis  and 
electrocardiogram did  not  show  any  consistent  abnormalities  or  clinically  relevant  differences compared  to 
active  control  group.  High  incidences  ( ≥   10%  of  patients  in  ofatumumab  group)  of  new  or  worsening 
biochemistry  abnormalities  were  high  serum  cholesterol,  high 
triglycerides,  high  ALT  (alanine 
aminotransferase), high AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and high  creatinine. 
Safety  in special populations 
Subgroups were evaluated for main  SAF. Patients  aged 18-55  years and mostly  Caucasians were included  in 
the studies, hence, the safety profile is not known for other age groups and races.  
The differences in safety profile across gender and previous treatment status could be expected due to different 
severity or stage of disease between these subgroups.  
Use of ofatumumab during pregnancy and lactation may increase the risk of B-cell depletion in utero, transient 
peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia in infants after birth and, hence, infections in the off-spring or 
unknown safety and efficacy profile of vaccinations in the new-born. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
should  use  effective contraception  while  treated  with  ofatumumab,  treatment  with  ofatumumab  should  be 
avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
It is unknown whether ofatumumab is excreted in human milk. In humans, excretion of IgG antibodies in milk 
occurs  during  the  first  few  days  after  birth,  which  is  decreasing  to  low  concentrations  soon  afterwards. 
Consequently,  a  risk  to  the  breastfed  child  cannot  be  excluded  during  this  short  period.  Afterwards, 
ofatumumab could be used during  breast-feeding if clinically needed. When treatment  has occurred up to  the 
last few months of pregnancy, breastfeeding can be started immediately after birth.   
Assessment report

There was no pattern of treatment differences between the sub-groups by region and status of financial interest.  
There  does not  appear  to  be  an  increased risk  for  hepatic  or  renal  safety,  or  drug  abuse  and  dependence, 
withdrawal and rebound with  ofatumumab in  the clinical trial experience with RMS patients in main SAF.   
Immunological events 
It  is  considered  that  development  of  clinically  significant  ADAs  is  not  a  current  concern  in  relation  to 
ofatumumab 20 mg Q4W according to  the results presented.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There  are no  known  clinically  significant  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products,  and  it  has  not  been  in 
evaluated in dedicated drug-drug interaction studies.  
Safety  and  effectiveness  of  vaccination  is  impacted  by  administration  of  ofatumumab  and  other  antiCD20 
antibodies.  Study  G2399  and  vaccination sub-study  are included  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance activity 
part of the proposed RMP to further characterize the risk of impaired immunization  response.   
Discontinuation due to AES 
AE’s leading to withdrawal  was reported for 54 patients  in main SAF (5.7%),  35 of whom (3.7%)  were due to 
immunoglobulin  levels. Pulmonary sarcoidosis (2  patients,  0.2%)  and  ALT  or  AST increase (1  patient  each) 
were  the  other  treatment  emergent  AEs  causing  drug  discontinuation  in  ofatumumab  group.  AEs  leading  to 
treatment interruption  was reported for 9.1%  (47 patients) of the patients  in ofatumumab group in main SAF. 
Besides  immunoglobulin  levels  (55  patients,  5.8%),  infections-infestations,  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, psychiatric disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, 
reproductive system and breast disorders were listed in TEAEs causing drug interruption in more than 2 patients 
for ofatumumab group. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  Applicant  has  excluded  safety  data  from  ongoing  studies  in  MS  and  studies  in  other  indications  in  the 
analyses for this application. The primary source of safety data in the MS target population consists of the two 
pivotal  Phase-III studies  (main  SAF  or  Pool  C2).  Supportive  data  from  phase  II  studies  in  MS  is  presented 
separately.  
Number  of all  MS patients  exposed to  20 mg  SC formulation  of ofatumumab  (forming Pool L2)  in  the  clinical 
program is 1230  (94.4%  of those  are RRMS patients);  with  946 patients  from phase III pivotal studies (40.8 
%  of  those  are treatment  naïve patients)  and  284  from  Phase II  bioequivalence study  (Study  G2102).  The 
safety  package in  phase III  studies  and  amount  of  exposure to  ofatumumab  20  mg  SC  dose  is  considered 
adequate for characterization of the short-term safety of ofatumumab 20 mg SC in active RMS patients.   
Long-term  safety  data  have  been  collected  in  accordance  with  requirements  of  ICH  E1  guidance 
(CPMP/ICH/375/95).  In  main SAF,  832  patients  were exposed to  ofatumumab  20mg  SC over 48  weeks, 312 
patients were exposed over 96 weeks and the number of patients exposed for more than 1 year were sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 123/138 
 
 
 
Further long-term safety and tolerability data in patients with  MS will be available after receiving results of the 
ongoing study G2399 which  is not included in this submission.  
Overview of adverse events in main SAF  does not  signal an  imbalance between treatment  arms in number of 
AEs  but  a  slightly  higher  frequency  noted  in  ofatumumab  group  for  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to  drug 
discontinuation.  However,  in  the  supportive  analyses higher  number  of  TEAEs,  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  drug 
discontinuation  is  reported  for  ofatumumab.  Therefore, phase  III studies  included  a  loading  dose of  20  mg 
given three times weekly which  was preferred over a loading dose of 60 mg given every 4 weeks due to  more 
AEs/SAEs associated with  60 mg dose (in particular post-injection systemic reactions reported as SAEs on day 
1). It is noted that some of the most frequently reported grade 3-4 AEs are in line with the identified or potential 
risks in Arzerra SmPC or RMP.  
In line with  the  safety profile described for anti-CD20  mAbs, the  main safety issues with  ofatumumab are the 
risk  of  injection  related  reactions,  infections,  decreased  ability  to  mount  an  immune  response  to  live  or 
attenuated  vaccines, coupled with  the potential  for infection following  the administration  of live vaccines, and 
decreased IgM levels.  
Analyses  of  AESI  revealed  that  clinically  important  potential  events  such  as  IRRs,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infections, urinary infections, herpes or varicella-zoster infections were more common in the ofatumumab group 
than in  the active comparator group. 
Injection-related  reactions  with  ofatumumab  20  mg  SC  are “very  common”  AEs  in  SmPC.  Injection-related 
reactions  are  common  with  the  first  and  second  ofatumumab  injection  and  requires  the  first  injection  of 
ofatumumab  to  be given  under the  guidance  of  a healthcare professional. They comprise systemic  reactions 
(e.g. fever, other systemic symptoms, headache, chills, myalgia, fatigue), 20.2%, and injection-site  reactions 
(e.g. erythema/redness, other site symptoms, pain, induration/swelling, warmth, itching), 10.8%. They appear 
to  be  independent  of  the  administered dose  and  may not  be  predicted on  beforehand.  Pre-treatment  is  not 
recommended. If occur, they are reported to be manageable in general, despite a small number of SAEs or IRR 
events leading to  withdrawal  in  MS studies.  Injection-related reactions appear to  be influenced  by method of 
administration  (AI or  PFS).  In  study G2102,  a significant  difference is  noted  in  the  incidence of  drug  related 
AEs  and  injection-related  reactions  between  the  AI-abdomen group  (43%  and  32%)  and  the  PFS-abdomen 
group (36.2% and 22.3%). 
A  risk  of  infection,  including  opportunistic  infections,  is  associated  with  the  use  of  any  anti-CD20  biological 
product  (including  ofatumumab)  depleting  B-cells  and  thereby  lowering  immunoglobulins.  The  overall 
proportion of patients  with  infections was similar in the  ofatumumab and the  teriflunomide treatment groups. 
Teriflunomide SmPC includes a contraindication for use in patients with  severe active infection until resolution 
and  warnings on  this  topic  and  ofatumumab SmPC is  updated  with  warnings  and  information in  sections  4.4 
and  4.8  and  a  contraindication  for  severe infection  until  resolution  is  implemented.  Active  malignancy  and 
patients  in  a  severely immunocompromised state  are added  as contraindications  in  ofatumumab  SmPC. The 
most commonly reported infections included but were not limited to nasopharyngitis (18.0%), upper respiratory 
tract  infection  (10.3%),  urinary  tract  infection  (10.3%),  and  influenza  (6.6%).  The  occurrence  of  new  or 
reactivated herpes  infections,  including  ophthalmic  infections,  was  increased in  the  ofatumumab  group (46, 
4.9%  vs  39,  4.2%  in  the  ofatumumab  and  teriflunomide  groups.  There  were  no  observed  cases  of  PML, 
cryptococcal infections, reactivation of hepatitis in MS studies (although these are included in warnings for this 
class and Arzerra) and patients at risk of immunocompromised status or infections were excluded from clinical 
studies.  “Serious  infections,  including  opportunistic  infections  (e.g.,  PML,  HBV  reactivation)”  is  an  important 
potential  risk  in  RMP  and  characterizes  the  serious  infections  related  to  decrease  in  immunoglobulins  and 
lymphopenia  or  neutropenia.  Furthermore,  appendicitis  being  reported  in  1%  of  the  population  and  more

frequently in the ofatumumab group was included in the  monitoring for this  important potential  risk of serious 
infections.  
No  deaths  were  reported  during  treatment  with  ofatumumab  in  main  SAF  or  supplementary  pools.  Most 
frequently reported SAE with  ofatumumab were ‘infections and ‘infestations’ (24, 2.5%), ‘injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications’  (13,  1.4%),  ‘psychiatric  disorders’ (10,  1.1%),  and  ‘neoplasms benign,  malignant 
and  unspecified  (including  cysts  and  polyps)’  (9,  1.0%).  The  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  study 
drug due to an SAE was possibly higher in ofatumumab group (ofatumumab: 11 patients, 1.2%; teriflunomide: 
8 patients,  0.8%).  
In  laboratory  parameters,  cytopenia  and  immunoglobulin  abnormalities  were  noted.  Cytopenia  including 
prolonged and  late-onset  neutropenia  are identified  or  potential  risks with  Arzerra. In  main  SAF,  the  overall 
incidence of neutropenia-related AEs was 1.0% with ofatumumab, the patients with at least 2 consecutive post-
baseline worsening of grade ≥ 1 in neutrophil  or lymphocyte counts  were respectively 2.6%  (26 patients)  and 
1.5%  (14 patients).  Despite close monitoring  and measures in place in clinical trial  environment, 8 patients  in 
each  group  (0.8%)  reported  any  AE  term  from  the  ‘infection’  SOC  post-first-grade  worsening,  3  patients 
reported SAE including  a neutropenic  sepsis, and  1 grade 3 AE led to  discontinuation.    In the Pool L2,  overall 
incidence of cytopenia-related AEs was 2.3%  with  ofatumumab  20  mg SC Cytopenia including  neutropenia is 
considered highly clinically relevant and is addressed in RMP as a potential risk. The physician is recommended 
to  evaluate  the  patient’s  immune  status  prior  to  initiating  therapy  and  Ofatumumab  must  not  be  given  to 
patients in  a severely immunocompromised state (e.g. significant  neutropenia or lymphopenia). 
In line  with  the  mechanism of action of  ofatumumab, B-cell depletion was  achieved after 1  week in  >75%  of 
the  patients  during the  initial  loading regimen of ofatumumab  (3 weekly 20  mg doses at Day 7,  Day 14,  and 
Day  21).  A  median  time  to  B  cell  recovery of  40  weeks  post  treatment  discontinuation  is  predicted  which 
requires vigilance for infection for patients under risk throughout  this period. 
In the majority of patients, mean IgM levels decreased with ofatumumab (30.9% decrease by Week 48, 38.8%  
decrease by Week 96). Treatment with  ofatumumab resulting in a decrease in IgM that reached a value below 
0.34  g/dL, more than 10%  of LLN,  was observed in 14.3%  of patients,  while a decrease of more than  30% or 
50%  of  LLN  was observed for respectively 3.8%  or 2.1%  of  patients.  Immunoglobulin  decrease/abnormality 
was amongst the most frequently reported grade 3 or 4  AEs and was the most frequently reported AE leading 
to  withdrawal of  study drug (3.7%)  or treatment  interruption  (5.8%).  Precaution for immunoglobulins will  be 
necessary with ofatumumab in clinical use.  
Safety  and  effectiveness  of  vaccination  is  impacted  by  administration  of  ofatumumab  and  other  antiCD20 
antibodies.  Use  of  ofatumumab  during  pregnancy  and  lactation  may  increase the  risk of  B-cell  depletion  in 
utero, transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia in infants  after birth and, hence, infections in 
the  off-spring or  unknown  safety and  efficacy profile of  vaccinations  in  the  new-born.  Therefore, women  of 
childbearing  potential  should  use  effective  contraception  while  treated  with  ofatumumab,  treatment  with 
ofatumumab  should  be  avoided during  pregnancy  unless  the  potential  benefit  to  the  mother  outweighs  the 
potential risk to the foetus.  
It  is  considered  that  development  of  clinically  significant  ADAs  is  not  a  current  concern  in  relation  to 
ofatumumab 20 mg Q4W according to  the results presented.   
At  the  Oral  Explanation,  the  Applicant  claimed  that  no  data  with  ofatumumab  in  studied  RMS  population 
supports  the  inclusion  of  the  contraindication  for  ‘Severe active  infection  until  resolution’.  However,  it  was 
unanimously concluded during the oral explanation and subsequent discussion that initiation of treatment with 
a medicine whose mechanisms of action is as for ofatumumab (immunosupressant through anti-CD20 mediated 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 125/138 
 
 
 
B  depletion)  should  not  be  considered  in  patients  with  severe  active  infection  until  resolution.  While  the 
argument that  most experts would already be aware of  this  is acknowledged, a  contraindication is  consistent 
with  this position,  as well as with  labels of related products and was included in section 4.3 of SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety package in phase III studies and amount  of exposure to ofatumumab 20 mg SC dose is considered 
adequate, with 946 patients treated with the target dose of ofatumumab in phase III and 832 patients for more 
than 48  weeks, for characterization of the  safety of ofatumumab 20  mg SC in active RMS patients. 
Ofatumumab causes prolonged B cell depletion primarily through CDC and, to a lesser extent, by ADCC. In line 
with  the  safety profile described for anti-CD20  mAbs, the  main safety issues with  ofatumumab  are the  risk of 
injection  related  reactions, infections,  decreased ability  to  mount  an  immune  response to  live  or  attenuated 
vaccines, coupled with  the  potential  for infection  following  the administration  of  live vaccines, and  decreased 
immunoglobulin  levels.  The  majority  of  these  events  were  manageable  although  they  were  amongst  most 
common  grade  3-4  AEs,  AEs  leading  to  treatment  interruptions  and  discontinuations.  Contraindication  for 
severe active infection until  resolution is included in  SmPC. 
In conclusion, ofatumumab 20 mg/Q4W SC appear to have a manageable safety profile for treatment of active 
RMS patients with  a 5.7% discontinuation  rate in phase III studies.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication for Kesimpta (ofatumumab) is: 
Kesimpta is indicated for the treatment  of adult patients  with  relapsing forms of multiple  sclerosis (RMS) with 
active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1),   
The  recommended dosing  regimen is  administered  by  SC  injection  with  initial  dosing  at  weeks 0,  1  and  2, 
followed by subsequent monthly dosing, starting  at week 4. 
MS  is  a  chronic,  immune-mediated  disease  of  the  CNS  characterised  by  inflammation,  demyelination,  and 
axonal/neuronal destruction,  ultimately  leading to  severe disability. Relapsing MS  includes CIS, RRMS,  active 
SPMS. At the time of their  first MS diagnosis, 80% to 85%  of adult patients  present with  RRMS, characterised 
by recurrent acute exacerbations (relapses) of neurological dysfunction followed by a variable state of complete 
or  incomplete  recovery. Most  patients  with  RRMS  may  progress  to  SPMS,  which  is  a  stage  of  the  disease 
characterized by continuous  worsening of disability with  or without  superimposed relapses. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current  therapeutic  approach involves symptomatic  treatment,  treatment  of acute  relapses, and  disease 
modifying  therapies.  The  standard  of  care  for  acute  relapses  is  methylprednisolone IV.  Methylprednisolone 
shortens the duration of a relapse but has no influence on its sequelae. DMTS aim to modify the  course of the 
disease  mainly  by  suppressing  or  modulating  the  immune  responses  involved  in  MS  pathogenesis.  These 
therapies  aim  to  prevent relapses  and  ultimately  intend  to  decrease the  rate  of  accumulation  of  disability. 
Several DMTs/DMT classes are currently available and approved for use in RMS, which vary in their mechanism 
of action, efficacy, safety, mode of administration and ease of use. Due to the risks (identified or potential) of 
opportunistic  infections, malignancies, and other systemic adverse drug reactions, several of these treatment 
options are considered as second-line options.  
mAbs  directed  against  proteins  expressed by  B-cells,  e.g.  anti-CD20  antibodies,  such  as  ocrelizumab  and 
rituximab, are high-efficacy therapies offering the same high efficacy as other highly efficacious DMTs, including 
(but not limited to) mAbs like natalizumab and alemtuzumab, but at the same time show a better safety profile. 
Despite the availability of several DMT for the treatment of RMS, there remains the medical need for efficacious 
and safe therapies that are convenient to administer and easy to do safety monitoring in clinical use, to reduce 
the burden of long-term accrual of disability.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Ofatumumab  20  mg  SC was  investigated  in  1882  RMS  patients  from  2  Phase  III randomized,  double-blind, 
double-dummy, active-comparator (teriflunomide)  controlled, parallel-group, multi-center  studies  of identical 
design  ([Study  G2301]  (ASCLEPIOS I)  and  [Study  G2302]  (ASCLEPIOS II)).  The  Phase  III studies  enrolled 
treatment naïve or previously treated, male or female patients, aged 18 to 55, with relapsing form of MS (RRMS 
or SPMS),  with  disease activity as  defined by Lublin  et al  2014,  and  an EDSS score of 0  to  5.5  at  screening. 
Patients had to  have active MS  defined by at least 1 relapse in  the year prior to  screening, 2 relapses in the 2 
years prior to screening, or a positive T1 Gd-enhancing MRI scan within  a year prior to randomization, and to 
be neurologically stable within  1 month  prior to  randomization. The  primary endpoint,  ARR, is  defined as the 
number of EDSS-confirmed MS relapses in a year. The treatment duration for an individual patient was flexible 
and  up to  30  study months  (approximately 2.5  years). The study-specific  data  cut-off  date  was  05-Jul-2019 
for Study G2301  and 10-Jul-2019  for Study G2302. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The population studied in the clinical efficacy package were adult patients with RMS with  active disease defined 
by clinical or imaging  features. Both naïve and previously treated patients  were included. Given the  eligibility 
criteria, patients not meeting the “activity criterion” were not appropriately represented in the studies. Hence, 
a conclusion  on the  magnitude  of effect  in these  patients  cannot be  drawn, but  the benefit  is  assumed to  be 
smaller due to the lower counterfactual risk.  
The  RMS  population  included  only  69  active  SPMS  patients  (no  specific  predefined  number  or  statistical 
analysis). The point  estimate for disability  related endpoints in  SPMS group showed a similar pattern to RRMS 
group, however too broad confidence intervals extended beyond 1.   
Studies were not individually powered for the analysis of 6mCDW; nevertheless, consistent trends in favour of 
ofatumumab were seen in both studies (reaching statistical significance in Study G2301). 
A  lack  of  B-cell  depletion  is  observed with  a  small  group  of  patients  (2.4  %)  and  long-term  consequences 
related to incomplete B-cell depletion in terms of efficacy are not  known. In a post  hoc analysis, the Applicant 
shows  that  the  number  of Gd-enhancing  T1 lesions  per scan and  the  number of  new  or enlarging  T2 lesions 
per year were higher  in  those  with  low  B-cell  depletion  compared with  those  with  sufficient  B-cell depletion, 
although still  lower than the teriflunomide treated patients.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
IRR include systemic (e.g. fever, headache, myalgia, chills, fatigue and flushing) and local site reactions (e.g. 
itching,  erythema, pain, oedema, pruritus and swelling),  and are very common with  ofatumumab SC reported 
at  higher  proportions than  with  matching  placebo injections  in  the  teriflunomide  treatment  group  (injection-
systemic reactions 20.2% vs 15.0%;  injection-site reactions 10.8%  vs 5.6%).   
Infections, including  opportunistic  infections,  are a  known safety concern based on  mechanism of action  and 
experience from other  anti-CD20  indications  and previous use of  ofatumumab in  other  indications.  The most 
commonly reported infections by PTs were nasopharyngitis (18.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.3%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 133/138 
 
 
 
urinary  tract  infection  (10.3%),  influenza  (6.6%),  and  others.  The  occurrence of  new  or reactivated  herpes 
infections, including  ophthalmic infections, was increased in  the ofatumumab group (46, 4.9%  vs 39, 4.2%  in 
the ofatumumab and teriflunomide groups. 
Patients  with  active  infection  are  not  necessarily  immunosuppressed/compromised  prior  to  starting  
ofatumumab  therapy but  they  will  be  under the  risk  of worsening  with  ofatumumab  therapy. Therefore, the 
administration of ofatumumab should be delayed until  a severe infection is resolved and a contraindication for 
‘Severe active infection until  resolution’ is included in the  SmPC. 
In the majority of patients,  IgM levels decreased. In Pool C2, in the  ofatumumab group, a decrease of 30.9% 
(-0.420  g/L)  in mean IgM values from baseline was experienced by Week 48 completers (824 patients) and a 
decrease of  38.8%  (-0.537  g/L)  was  experienced  by  Week  96  completers  (304  patients).  Treatment  with 
ofatumumab resulting in a decrease in IgM that  reached a value below 0.34 g/dL, more than 10% of LLN, was 
observed in 14.3% of patients, while a decrease of more than 30% or 50% of LLN was observed for respectively 
3.8% or 2.1% of patients. Decreased blood IgM was amongst the most frequently reported grade 3-4  AEs and 
was 
the  most 
frequently  reported  AE 
leading 
to  withdrawal  of  study  drug.  Immunoglobulin 
decrease/abnormality was reported as AEs leading to  withdrawal  for 35  patients  in  Pool C2 (3.7%)  out  of  54 
patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs  (5.7%).  Additionally,  55  patients  (5.8%)  reported 
immunoglobulin decrease as AEs leading to treatment interruption (out of 9.1% of the patients in ofatumumab 
group who had treatment interruption due to AEs). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
“Serious  infections,  including  opportunistic  infections  (e.g.,  PML,  HBV  reactivation)”,  “Malignancy”,  and 
“Impaired Immunization  Response, including  vaccination  of  newborns  after exposure in  utero”  are added  in 
RMP as potential  risks. From  previous use of Arzerra, IRRs, infections, decreased ability to mount an immune 
response  to  live  or  attenuated  vaccines,  decreased IgM  levels,  neutropenia,  and  malignant/pre-malignant 
disorders,  thus  most  of  above-mentioned  AEs,  were  observed.  It  is  uncertain  if  these  AEs  also  apply  to 
ofatumumab since  ofatumumab is dosed differently,  however, AEs known  for Arzerra should  be kept in  mind 
while evaluating the safety data from MS patients. 
IRRs  are  most  frequently  seen  in  relation  to  the  first  two  injections,  there  is  currently  no  proposed  pre-
treatment, thus,  the patients  need to remain in hospital /under observation during the initial  injections.  
Infections, including  opportunistic  infections,  are a  known safety concern based on  mechanism of action  and 
experience from other anti-CD20  indications and previous use of ofatumumab in other indications. There were 
no  observed cases of  PML  or reactivation of  hepatitis  in  MS studies,  but  these  are identified risks for  Arzerra 
and other anti-CD20 therapies. 
There was not  an increased frequency of malignancy or pre-malignant  disorders with  ofatumumab compared 
to teriflunomide in the clinical trial experience with RMS patients. However, the time on the study and/or follow-
up was short with regards to the development of neoplasms and sustained depletion of B-cells might affect the 
immune  system´s ability to  detect  and eliminate  cancer cells thus  leading to  an  increased risk of  developing 
solid tumours. 
The uncertainties above are considered acceptable and will be reduced by monitoring in the PSUR and in a 
PASS.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ofatumumab  significantly  decreased  the  risk  of  relapses  in  active  RMS  patients.  The  risk  reduction  was 
considerable and thus  considered clinically relevant. The ARR was less than half that  of the active comparator 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 135/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
teriflunomide.  The  effect on  relapses translated  into  a  reduction  in  risk  of worsening  of  disability  (6mCDW). 
The analyses presented showed that  time  to first 6mCDW was delayed to  a clinically meaningful extent.  All in 
all, the favourable effects of ofatumumab on active RMS patients are well-documented.  
In line with  the  safety profile described for anti-CD20  mAbs, the  main safety issues with  ofatumumab are the 
risk  of  injection  related  reactions,  infections,  decreased  ability  to  mount  an  immune  response  to  live  or 
attenuated  vaccines, coupled with  the potential  for infection following  the administration  of live vaccines, and 
decreased  immunoglobulin  levels.  These  concerns  are  serious  but  manageable  provided  that  the  product 
information provides relevant information to the prescriber/patient about the contraindications and precautions 
necessary to minimize risk. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant effect on relapses has been demonstrated in a study population consisting of mainly RRMS 
patients  and  a  smaller  number  of  SPMS  with  relapses.  However,  this  DMT  intends  to  modify  inflammatory 
activity  in  MS  and  it  is  considered that  relapses in  RRMS  and SPMS  have the  same underlying  inflammatory 
pathophysiology  and  therefore  efficacy  on  relapses  in  RRMS  patients  may  be  extrapolated  to  efficacy  on 
relapses in SPMS. Extrapolation of the effect on disability will not be considered appropriate as pathophysiology 
is different. In  this regard, the point  estimate for disability  related endpoints  in SPMS group showed a similar 
pattern to RRMS group, however too broad confidence intervals extended beyond 1. 
A  smaller magnitude  of  benefit  –  not  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  risks -  can  be  expected  in  patients  without 
activity  at  baseline.  This  consideration  is  relevant  for  patients  not  receiving  any  DMD  and  showing  no 
inflammatory activity.  
In fact, extensive discussions during  the assessment have been held about the  wording of the  indication. The 
Applicant focussed in particular on two patients’  populations: 
a. Patients who are newly diagnosed. 
b.  Patients  treated  with  a  different  DMT  who  decide  to  switch  from  the  current  DMT  due  to  lack  of 
efficacy, or safety or tolerability considerations 
To clarify the target population for ofatumumab with  more precision the Applicant has proposed to add “newly 
diagnosed  patients  and  patients  switching  from  their  current  treatment  due  to  lack  of  efficacy, or  safety or 
tolerability considerations” in the indication  statement in section 4.1  of the SmPC together with  the  requested 
“active disease” wording. The proposed indication  wording is “Kesimpta is indicated for the treatment  of adult 
patients with  RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1), including newly 
diagnosed  patients  and  patients  switching  from  their  current  treatment  due  to  lack  of  efficacy, or  safety or 
tolerability considerations.”  
a.  Given  the  current  practice  in  the  EU;  a  significant  number  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  would  fulfil  the 
“activity” phenotype criterion. Similarly, patients switching  their DMT due to lack of efficacy should be fulfilling 
the indication  with  activity criterion, thus  their inclusion in the  indication would be redundant. However, it has 
been  agreed  that  section  5.1  should  adequately  reflect  the  inclusion  criteria,  stating  that  newly  diagnosed 
patients were also included in the  studies. 
b.  It  is  acknowledged that  patients  treated  with  a  different DMT  who  decide to  switch  from the  current  DMT 
due  to  safety  or  tolerability  considerations  would  not  formally  fulfil  the  “activity”  criterion  at  the  time  of 
switching the DMT (otherwise, the switch would be due to efficacy failure). However, the fact that these patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/160608/2021 
Page 136/138 
 
 
 
 
are currently receiving a DMT for controlling the  MS inflammatory activity could be considered as a “proxy” of 
fulfilment of an “activity” criterion because it can be assumed that  (i) these patients needed to be active at the 
time the  first DMT was prescribed and (ii)  a patient whose inflammatory activity is adequately controlled by a 
DMT intended to control this activity might not be without.  Therefore, even if a conclusion on the magnitude of 
effect  in  patients  not  meeting  the  “activity”  criterion  cannot  be directly  drawn  from the  results  in  this  study 
population  (all  active  as per  eligibility  criteria),  it  could  be  agreed  that  patients  switching  from their  current 
DMT due to safety or tolerability considerations could have also a positive B/R. 
As per regards of the  wording  of  the indication  in section  4.1,  it  is  concluded that  it  should not  deviate from 
comparable products. 
The balance of benefits and risks is considered positive in adult patients with  RMS fulfilling the activity specifier. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kesimpta is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on  the CHMP  review of data on quality,  safety and  efficacy, the CHMP  considers by consensus that  the  
benefit-risk balance of Kesimpta is favourable in the following indication: 
Kesimpta is indicated for the treatment  of adult patients  with  relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with 
active disease defined by clinical or imaging features (see section 5.1)

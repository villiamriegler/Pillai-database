Within the current type II variation, the MAH is seeking an extension of indication for pembrolizumab, in 
combination with chemotherapy, to the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
carcinoma of the oesophagus or HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults, 
based on the results from an  analysis of the pivotal KEYNOTE-590 (KN590) trial.

3.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  oesophagus  or  HER-2  negative 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy, is indicated for the 
first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the 
oesophagus or HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults (see section 5.1)” 
Epidemiology  
In 2018, oesophageal cancer was the seventh most common cancer in terms of incidence (572,034 new 
cases) and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with 508,585 deaths. Over 77% of 
the new oesophageal cancer cases diagnosed worldwide occur in Asia, and incidence varies significantly 
between regions1. In most regions, including the US and Europe, males have a 2- to 3-fold higher 
incidence compared to females. In Western Europe, an estimated 13,938 new cases and 11,403 deaths 
are expected to occur in 20202. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Oesophageal cancers can be categorized into 2 main histological subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC). While SCC is the most common subtype of oesophageal cancer globally 
(84% of all cases) with the highest incidence rates in Eastern Asia and Eastern Africa, AC is the most 
common subtype in high-income countries, with the highest incidence rates in Northern Europe, North 
America, and Oceania3. SCC typically occurs in the proximal two-thirds of the oesophagus, whereas AC is 
found in the distal third of the oesophagus and at the EGJ. AC tumours of the EGJ are classified based on 
Siewert types4. Siewert type I tumours are adenocarcinomas whose epicenter is located 1 to 5 
centimeters proximally from the anatomical line of the cardia5. As regards risk factors, smoking and 
alcohol consumption have been associated with SCC in western countries, while AC generally occurs in 
patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux and a higher risk has been recognised for obese patients. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the prognosis for metastatic oesophageal cancer 
is generally poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 5%6. Treatment of advanced oesophageal cancer 
is largely palliative in intent.

Management 
For  previously  untreated  patients  with  locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the 
oesophagus,  NCCN  and  ESMO  guidelines  recommend  first-line  treatment  with  the  combination  of  a 
fluoropyrimidine (5-FU or capecitabine) with platinum agents (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, or carboplatin). Some 
of the first-line treatments recommended and/or used for oesophageal cancer are based on evidence that 
is extrapolated from data from either gastric or gastroesophageal junction trials7 8 9. 
Triplet regimens with the addition of anthracycline or taxanes can also be considered in fit patients, 
although controversy remains as regards their clinical advantage. Taxane and platinum combinations can 
be also considered. In SCC, cisplatin-based combinations showed increased response rate but no survival 
gain compared with monotherapy; overall, results with palliative chemotherapy are worse than for AC 
tumours 7 8 9. 
An overview on clinical efficacy of currently available treatments has been provided by the MAH in the

3.1.2.  About the product 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a humanized mAb IgG4/kappa isotype directed against PD-1. By blocking 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2, pembrolizumab enhances T cell lymphocyte activity 
with consequent stimulation of the immune-mediated anti-tumour activity. Pembrolizumab also 
modulates the level of IL-2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines. The antibody potentiates existing immune 
responses in the presence of antigen only; it does not non-specifically activate T cells. 
Pembrolizumab is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, 
urothelial cancer, and cHL. Pembrolizumab has been approved both as monotherapy and in combination 
with other agents.  
The scope of this variation is to include a new indication for Keytruda: in combination with chemotherapy, 
for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus or 
HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults. The proposed indication is supported 
by the results from a single pivotal study, the KEYNOTE-590 (KN590) trial. A Phase 3, randomized, double-
blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pembrolizumab  in 
combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) versus chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) as first line 
treatment in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous 
cell  carcinoma  of  the  oesophagus  or  advanced/metastatic  Siewert  type  1  adenocarcinoma  of  the 
gastroesophageal junction. A total of 700 patients were randomized to one of the two treatment arms. A 
dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W is recommended. 
The CHMP accepted the following indication: 
KEYTRUDA, in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy, is indicated for the 
first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the

PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 10. 
3.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice was obtained from the CHMP on 23 March 2017, with questions relating to the design 
elements of Study KN590, such as the study population, comparator, endpoints and statistical analysis 
plan.   
- As regards inclusion/exclusion criteria, the CHMP noted the exclusion of locally advanced carcinoma that 
is resectable or potentially curable by radiation therapy, as determined by local investigators; in this 
regard, it was advised to carefully select study centres with adequate expertise in the management of 
oesophageal cancer (i.e. high-volume centres with experienced surgeons and multidisciplinary teams as 
recommended by guidelines) since this is known to impact on patient’s clinical outcome. The Applicant did 
not comment on this aspect within the submitted application; however, information has been requested in 
view of the OS results as stratified by geographic region. 
- Although the chosen comparator was deemed adequate, it was suggested to consider the addition of a 
third treatment arm to test pembrolizumab monotherapy based on study KN180 results. The MAH did not 
follow the advice; however, the completed KN181 trial testing pembrolizumab in monotherapy for the 
same indication after prior systemic therapy has provided evidence for lack of benefit on clinical outcomes 
of the immunotherapeutic agent alone. 
- Among the proposed stratification factors, it was recommended to include PD-L1 status. The MAH did 
not follow the advice, however, clinical characteristics of patients as stratified by CPS cut-off levels (≥10 
and <10) showed balanced treatment arms and good representation of the two subgroups (CPS ≥10 and 
<10) within the overall population was achieved providing unbiased result analysis and data 
interpretation. 
- PFS as primary endpoint was considered acceptable if supported by a positive trend in OS. However, the 
CHMP highlighted that the magnitude of the effect in the overall population and in both biomarker 
positive and negative subgroups will be taken into account. In addition, to assess the overall clinical 
relevance of the results, the effect will also be considered in relation to the tolerability of the combination.   
- On the statistical aspects of the study design, the need for compelling statistical significance based on a 
single pivotal trial was highlighted in support of the pursued extension of indication, and if superiority in 
PFS could not be provided, the exclusion of detrimental effect of treatment on mortality either in the 
interim or final analysis was requested to be shown. 
3.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The assessment of 
KN590 data did not raise concern over GCP compliance leading to request for GCP inspection.   
3.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/331504/2021 
Page 11/126 
 
 
 
 
3.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from conducting 
Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients are not expected to pose a 
significant risk to the environment.  
3.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient, an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is 
considered acceptable. 
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

3.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pembrolizumab  PK  disposition  has  been  characterized  via  pooled  population  PK  analyses  using  serum 
concentration-time data contributed from subjects across various clinical studies using a time-dependent 
PK (TDPK) model. The PK reference dataset for monotherapy includes all available PK data from subjects 
enrolled in studies KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, KEYNOTE-010, and KEYNOTE-024, with 
an  overall  sample  size  of  2993.  This  serves  as  the  PK  reference  analysis  to  support  descriptions  of 
pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics in the USPI and EU SmPC. 
Within the current application, the MAH provided PK data from KEYNOTE-181 (a Phase III randomized open-
label study of single agent pembrolizumab vs. physicians’ choice of single agent docetaxel, paclitaxel, or 
irinotecan  in  subjects  with  advanced/metastatic  adenocarcinoma  and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the 
oesophagus  that  have  progressed  after  first-line  standard  therapy),  which  has  a  comparable  patient 
population as KEYNOTE-590. 
The  results  of  systemic  exposures  are  shown  by  tumour  histology  types,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and

Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (6.0 L; coefficient of variation [CV]: 20%). As expected for an antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); this 
decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) for the 
terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
A substantial characterization of the key clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity findings of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy has been provided in previous submissions. 
The updated clinical pharmacology results specific to this submission include: 
• PK data from subjects with advanced/metastatic squamous cancer and adenocarcinomas of the 
oesophagus (ESO) (KEYNOTE-181) 
• A comparison of KN181 observed PK data with reference model (TDPK) predicted PK. 
Pembrolizumab PK data from KEYNOTE-181 study 
PK samples with a 15 October 2018 visit cut-off date were measured for 318 subjects in KN181 ESO.  
Table 4: Overview of pembrolizumab included in KN181 PK analysis 
PK schedule in KN181 200 mg Q3W: Pre-dose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were

3.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pembrolizumab is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which 
are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Dose regimen selection 
Pembrolizumab is approved at a 2 mg/kg or 200 mg Q3W dosing regimen for multiple indications as 
monotherapy and in combination with small molecule or chemotherapy worldwide (e.g., melanoma, 
NSCLC, HNSCC, HL, UC, gastric cancer, MSI-H cancer, HCC and RCC). 
Pembrolizumab is also approved at 400 mg Q6W in the EU for monotherapy and combination therapies 
indications. 
A dosing regimen of 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q6W is recommended for pembrolizumab in the treatment 
of adult subjects with oesophageal cancer in combination with chemotherapy.  
PK/PD modelling  
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this extension of 
indication. 
Immunogenicity 
No new ADA data are provided in this submission. 
3.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results to support the extension of indication for Keytruda to include a new 
indication in oesophageal cancer are available from study KEYNOTE-181. 
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison was conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication in Oesophageal Cancer (ESO) and 
the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data 
(KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024).  
Based on the previous and current population PK analysis, the pembrolizumab PK profile is typical for a 
therapeutic mAb, with a low systemic clearance (0.25 L/day) and a low volume of distribution (6 L) at 
steady state, that is predicted to be achieved after approximately 16 weeks (for the intended dosing 
regimen of 200 mg Q3W). Elimination half-life (t1/2) is 22 days.  
Predose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing at 
Cycles 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 and every 4 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter. 
The observed concentrations in patients with advanced/metastatic squamous cell cancer and 
adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus treated with Pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W generally fall within the 
range of predicted concentrations, both after first dose and at steady state. 
The observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values at cycle 2 and cycle 8 are consistent with other 
globally approved studies in different cancer indications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/331504/2021 
Page 18/126 
 
 
 
 
The MAH did not provide any further PK data for the 1L oesophageal study KN590 (in combo with 
chemotherapy) but only PK data of the 2L supportive study KN181 (in mono). The existing 
immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a sufficiently 
large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total treatment ADA 
across different pembrolizumab regimens (1.4 – 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). 
This analysis has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in the USPI and 
in the EU SmPC. This low rate of immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumour type 
and no clinically meaningful consequences have been observed in the subjects with a positive 
immunogenicity reading. Based on the existing robust characterization of immunogenicity potential, 
alignment has been obtained with the US FDA and EMA that the current assessment of immunogenicity 
for pembrolizumab is adequate for non-adjuvant monotherapy settings. 
Following the above outlined agreements, the MAH provided PK data from KEYNOTE-181 to demonstrate 
that pembrolizumab PK/exposures in oesophageal carcinoma are consistent with the PK from other 
indications that are approved in the EU. 
3.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The observed concentration from study KN-181 falls within the 90% CI of the model predicted median 
concentration, independently of tumour histology (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma).  
3.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data in this submission are based on a single study (KEYNOTE-590).  
KEYNOTE-590 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multisite study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) 
versus chemotherapy (cisplatin with 5-FU) as 1L treatment in participants with locally advanced 
unresectable metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus or 
advanced/metastatic Siewert type 1 adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction.  
This submission is based on results from the IA for KEYNOTE-590 with a data cut-off date of 2 July 2020, 
which was after a minimum of 13 months of follow-up.

Treatments 
Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: 
• 
• 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 of each three-week cycle in combination with cisplatin 
80 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to six cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m2 
IV per day on Day 1 to Day 5 of each three-week cycle, or per local standard for 5-FU 
administration.

Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to six cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m2 IV per day on 
Day 1 to Day 5 of each three-week cycle, or per local standard for 5-FU administration. 
Treatment with pembrolizumab or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease 
progression or a maximum of 24 months. Patients randomised to pembrolizumab were permitted to 
continue beyond the first RECIST v1.1-defined disease progression if clinically stable until the first 
radiographic evidence of disease progression was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. 
Assessment of tumour status was performed every 9 weeks.

Sample size 
The sample size and power calculations for PFS and OS assumed the following: 
- PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 6 months for the control group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/331504/2021 
Page 22/126 
 
 
 
 
 
- OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 12 months for the control group. 
- Enrollment period of 22 months 
- An annual dropout rate of 5% for both PFS and OS 
The sample size and power calculations were performed using R (“gsDesign” package). 
The study was event-driven and originally planned to randomize approximately 700 subjects with 1:1 
ratio into the two treatment groups: Pembrolizumab + Chemo and Placebo + Chemo. 
One interim efficacy analysis was planned in this study, which is the main analysis for PFS, and an interim 
analysis for OS. A Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function was constructed to implement 
group sequential efficacy boundaries to control the Type I error for each OS hypothesis.  
In the following the sample size calculation for the two primary hypotheses are listed: 
1.  With  460  PFS  events,  there  was  62.2%  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.77 
(pembrolizumab vs. Placebo) at alpha = 0.002% (one-sided) in subjects with PD-L1 CPS 
>= 10, assuming PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 6 months in the 
control arm. In the scenario that the PFS hypothesis is rejected in ESCC, the PFS test has 
62.2% power to detect an HR of 0.7 at an α level of 0.002 in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥10. 
In the scenario that both of PFS hypotheses in ESCC and in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 are rejected, 
the PFS test has 76.8% power to detect an HR of 0.75 at an α level of 0.002 in all subjects. 
In the scenario that the PFS null hypotheses in all populations and all OS null hypotheses 
are rejected, the PFS test has 95.1% power to detect an HR of 0.75 at an α level of 0.025 
in all subjects. 
2.  With  233  OS  events  and  one  interim  analysis  at  approx.  86%  of  the  target  number  of 
events,  there  was  84.5%  power  to  detect  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.65  (pembrolizumab  vs. 
Placebo) at alpha = 0.012% (one-sided) in ESCC subjects with PD-L1 CPS >= 10, assuming 
OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 12 months in the control arm. Based 
on  a  target  number  of  455  events,  the  study  has  approximately  88.3%  power  at  FA  to 
detect an HR of 0.72 at an overall α level of 0.011 (1-sided) in ESCC subjects. 
In the scenario that the OS hypothesis is rejected in ESCC with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 but is not rejected in 
ESCC, the OS test has approximately 89.9% power at FA to detect an HR of 0.65 at an overall α level of 
0.006 (1-sided) in PD-L1 CPS ≥10. In the scenario that the OS hypothesis is rejected in ESCC but is not 
rejected in ESCC with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, the OS test has approximately 93.2% power at FA to detect an HR 
of 0.65 at an overall α level of 0.011 (1-sided) in PD-L1 CPS ≥10. In the scenario that the OS hypotheses 
in ESCC with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 and in ESCC are both rejected, the OS test has approximately 96.2% power 
at FA to detect an HR of 0.65 at an overall α level of 0.023 (1-sided) in PD-L1 CPS ≥10. In the scenario 
that OS hypotheses in ESCC with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, in ESCC, and in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 are all rejected, the OS 
test has approximately 94.2% power at FA to detect an HR of 0.75 at an overall α level of 0.023 (1-sided) 
in all subjects. In the scenario that OS hypotheses in all populations and all PFS null hypotheses are 
rejected, the OS test has approximately 94.6% power at FA to detect an HR of 0.75 at an overall α level 
of 0.025 (1-sided) in all subjects. 
For both primary endpoints the enrolment period was assumed to be 22 months, the annual dropout rate 
was 5%, and the prevalence of ESCC with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is 38%, PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is 51% (all subjects), 
and ESCC is 73%. 
Based on 749 subjects with at least 10 months of follow-up, the power of the ORR testing at the allocated 
α=0.025 is approximately 98.7% to detect a 15-percentage point difference between an underlying 35% 
response rate in the control arm and a 50% response rate in the experimental arm.

Randomisation 
Treatment randomization occurred centrally using an interactive voice response system / integrated web 
response system (IVRS/IWRS). There are 2 treatment arms. Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 
ratio to pembrolizumab + cisplatin + 5-FU (Arm 1) or placebo + cisplatin + 5-FU (Arm 2). 
Treatment randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
1. Geographic region (Asia versus Rest of World) 
2. Histology (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma) 
3. ECOG performance status (0 versus 1) 
After  global  cohort  was  recruited,  further  subjects  from  China  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  up  to  106 
subjects. This China Extension study was randomized in a 1:1 allocation with the same stratification factors 
as the global cohort. The randomization was implemented in IVRS. 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-blinding technique was used. Pembrolizumab or placebo treatment was blinded to the subject, 
study site personnel, and Sponsor personnel. 
Statistical methods 
Interim analysis  
One interim analysis was planned in addition to the final analysis for this study. For the interim and final 
analyses, all randomized subjects were included. Results of the interim analysis were reviewed by the 
DMC.

Multiplicity 
The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz to provide strong multiplicity control for 
multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. According to this approach, study hypotheses may be 
tested more than once, and when a particular null hypothesis is rejected, the alpha allocated to that 
hypothesis can be reallocated to other hypothesis tests. Figure below shows the initial 1-sided α allocation 
for each hypothesis in the ellipse representing the hypothesis. 
The weights for re-allocation from each hypothesis to the others are shown in the boxes on the lines 
connecting hypotheses. The boundaries provided in this section are calculated based on the estimated 
number of events at each analysis, and the actual boundaries will be determined from the actual number 
of events observed at the time of the analyses, using the spending functions specified.

Figure 4: Multiplicity Diagram for type I Error control 
The study will test PFS twice, at IA1 and at IA2. The initial alpha assigned to PFS in ESCC will be 0.002. If 
PFS hypothesis in ESCC subjects is rejected, the alpha will be reallocated to PFS in subjects with PD-L1 
CPS ≥10. If PFS hypothesis in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is also rejected, the alpha will be reallocated 
to PFS in all subjects. If all the OS null hypotheses are rejected, 0.99 of the initially allocated alpha i.e. 
0.023 to OS hypotheses will be reallocated to test the PFS hypothesis in all subjects. Thus, if the PFS null 
hypotheses in the ESCC and the PDL1 CPS ≥10 populations are rejected and the OS hypothesis in all 
subjects is not rejected the PFS null hypothesis in all subjects may be tested at α=0.002. If the PFS null 
hypotheses in the ESCC and the PDL1 CPS ≥10 populations are rejected and all the OS hypotheses are 
rejected, the PFS null hypothesis in all subjects may be tested at α=0.025. 
The following table shows the boundary properties for PFS in IA1 and IA2 for each of these α levels, as 
assuming the estimated numbers of events are analyzed. IA2 will be the final analysis for PFS. The PFS 
efficacy boundaries will be set using the Lan-DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien-
Fleming boundary. 
Note that the final row indicates the total power to reject the null hypothesis for PFS at each a level. Also, 
note that if the OS null hypothesis in all subjects is rejected at the final analysis, PFS in all subjects may 
be tested again with its updated bounds, considering the alpha reallocation from the OS hypothesis.

Table 9: Disposition of Subjects (ITT Population) 
271 of the 1020 screened patients (27%) were not randomized because eligibility criteria were not met. 
Most common reason was that diagnosis was not confirmed (n=51); however, also a relevant number of 
participants were screen failures because they did not have an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (n=47) or adequate organ 
functions (n=42) or had a condition that might confound study evaluations (n=34). Ten (10) patients were 
not enrolled due to a known history or being positive hepatitis B or C. 
A total of 9 of 749 randomized patients did not receive any study medication (n=3 in the pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy arm and n=6 in the chemotherapy arm).   
Subsequent therapy 
A similar proportion of patients, 43.5% and 47.8% of participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
and chemotherapy groups, respectively received new oncological medication, mostly chemotherapeutics. A 
low proportion of 32 patients received subsequent therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor in the chemotherapy 
arm (8.5%); however, also 21 patients received immunotherapy after pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
treatment (5.6%).  
Recruitment 
A total of 1020 participants were screened and 749 were randomized (pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy: 373; chemotherapy: 376) across 168 global study centres in 26 countries.

Table 10-Protocol amendments: 
COVID-19-related Changes to the Conduct of the Study 
There were no changes in the planned conduct of the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sponsor 
continued to follow its standard operating procedures (SOPs) for study conduct, monitoring, and oversight 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. A risk-based approach, consistent with recent Health Authority guidance 
on  conducting  clinical  studies  during  the  pandemic,  was  used  to  assess  and  mitigate  the  impact  of  the 
pandemic on study conduct in order to (1) assure the safety of study participants, study staff and health 
care providers, (2) maintain compliance with GCP principles, and (3) minimize risks to study data integrity. 
Contingency  measures  were  implemented  as  per  the  Sponsor’s  SOP  for  exception  and  deviation 
management and as appropriate for the country, region and individual study site. Exceptions and deviations 
from SOPs were documented. 
Clinical investigator study sites were advised to follow local and national guidance regarding the pandemic 
and  to  share  any  mitigation  plans  for  study  participant  management  with  the  IRB/EC  and  the  Sponsor. 
Study sites were also advised to remain in contact with study participants to monitor for safety concerns, 
help ensure participants adhered to their study intervention schedule, and to keep participants informed of 
changes to the study and other study activities.

Measures implemented by the Sponsor to manage key aspects of study conduct during the pandemic are 
summarized below (implementation date shown in parentheses). Not all measures were implemented at all 
study sites due to differences in local conditions and impact of the pandemic.

Missing participant study visits and/or data were queried as per the Sponsor’s standard processes. As per 
the  Sponsor’s  standard  process,  missing  procedures  and  study  visits  were  to  be  reported  as  protocol 
deviations  for  that  participant.  Procedures  and  study  visits  conducted  outside  protocol-defined  windows 
were also to be reported as protocol deviations. Participants with protocol deviations due to the pandemic

Important protocol deviations (“those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key trial data 
or  that  may  significantly  affect  a  participant’s  rights,  safety,  or  well-being”)  were  reported  for  60 
participants in this study (6%). None of the important protocol deviations were considered to be clinically 
important (“deviations that may compromise critical data analyses pertaining to primary efficacy and/or 
safety endpoints or the participant’s safety”).

Table 12: Summary of Important Protocol Deviations 
Prematurely Unblinding 
As of the data cut-off, there were 11 confirmed inadvertent unblinding events that were determined to not 
significantly  impact  the  study  blind,  validity  of  site’s  data,  or  reliability  of  study  results.  However,  there 
were 21 premature “emergency” unblinding events.  Emergency unblinding is done at the discretion of the 
investigator in situations where unblinded information is needed to provide proper medical management 
for  a  study  participant.  These  premature  unblinding  events  had  no  impact  on  the  data  analyses  per 
evaluation by the SQI process. Therefore, these participants were not excluded from the efficacy and safety 
analyses.

Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population defined as all randomized participants. A 
total of 749 participants were included in the primary efficacy population, which is the Global Study 
population defined as all participants randomized in the study. The Global Study population included 
participants enrolled in the Global Cohort (n=711) and the China Extension Study (n=38). China Cohort 
has a separate analysis not in scope for this CSR. 
Efficacy analyses were conducted in the populations identified as follows:

Outcomes and estimation 
At this interim analysis (i.e. final for PFS and interim for OS), efficacy analyses were performed on PFS, 
OS, ORR, DOR, and PRO. As of the data cut-off (02 July 2020), the median follow-up time for participants 
was 12.6 months (range: 0.1-33.6 months) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 9.8 
months (range: 0.1-33.6 months) in the chemotherapy group.

In patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10, the median OS was 11.4 months vs. 8.6 months with a HR of 0.6, and the 
12  months  OS  rates  was  48%  vs.  35%  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  [n=31]  and 
chemotherapy group [n=26], respectively.  
Median OS and 12 months OS rates are in favour of the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group for European 
patients with CPS≥10 (OS HR 0.60). No clinically meaningful benefit could be observed for the EU population 
with  CPS<10  (OS  HR  0.85,  median  OS  9.7  vs.  12.6  months,  12  month  OS  rates  48.3%  vs.  59.3%  for 
pembrolizumab+chemotherapy vs chemotherapy, respectively). 
The OS KM curves for European patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 and with PD-L1 CPS <10, are shown below:

In the EU subgroup the HR for OS 0.72 was in line with the results of the overall study population. However, 
despite limited numbers of EU participants, the benefit of pembrolizumab appears to be lower for patients 
with PD-L1 CPS <10 (OS HR 0.85, PFS HR 0.72) compared to CPS ≥10 (OS HR 0.6, PFS HR 0.48).  
A PFS benefit was observed (HR 0.55) across all EU participants. This appeared also more pronounced for 
patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 (PFS HR 0.48) compared to patients with CPS <10 (PFS HR 0.72). There were 
no  relevant  differences  between  histology  regarding  the  treatment  effect  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  EU 
population.

3.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In support of this application, data are presented from the pivotal KEYNOTE-590 (KN590) trial, an 
ongoing Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multisite study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) versus 
chemotherapy (cisplatin with 5-FU) alone as first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or 
metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus or HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in 
adults. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study design of KEYNOTE-590 study can be considered overall appropriate to support a MA in the 
sought indication, although several methodological aspects were raised.  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria define a study population characterised by relatively fit patients (ECOG 0-
1) with an advanced disease status (unresectable or metastatic tumours) and who were treatment-naïve. 
Overall, the study is representative of the population for which palliative chemotherapy is indicated as

front-line approach. Recruitment occurred in centres with adequate expertise in the management of 
oesophageal cancer, i.e. high-volume centres with experienced surgeons and multidisciplinary teams, as 
recommended by CHMP at the time of the provided Scientific Advice.  
EMA Scientific Advice on the design of KEYNOTE-590 was given on 23 March 2017. At that time, study 
KEYNOTE-180 in 3L+ oesophageal cancer was still ongoing and only preliminary results from the phase I 
trial KEYNOTE-028 in PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥1%) patients were available (n=23; ORR of 40% reported 
according to investigator assessment with responses observed only in GEP-positive patients). Based on 
these data, the CHMP recommended to wait for KEYNOTE-180 study results before starting recruitment of 
KEYNOTE-590, in order to make an informed decision on the definition of a biomarker as stratification 
factor and on the possible addition of a pembrolizumab monotherapy arm in the KN590 study design 
(possibly in a biomarker selected population).  
The MAH did not follow the advice to include PD-L1 status as a stratification factor. KN590 enrolment 
started before biomarker analyses from KN180 were available. However, it was required that subjects had 
to provide a tissue sample for biomarker analysis at enrolment.   
The MAH opted not to include a pembrolizumab monotherapy arm. KN028 ORR data as reported by an 
independent assessment from a database cut-off date as of 31 January 2018 were 18.2%. Available 
study outcomes from KN180 (ORR in CPS ≥10 population 13.8% and 21.5% in KN180 and KN181, 
respectively) further support that the omission of a monotherapy arm can be considered acceptable in the 
1L setting.  
Pembrolizumab was used at the 200 mg Q3W dose which was approved in both monotherapy and 
chemotherapy combined regimens across different indications; this is considered acceptable. The chosen 
comparator (cisplatin and 5-FU) is deemed adequate and in line with current clinical recommendations. 
Although being the most widely used chemotherapy combination, several other options are currently 
contemplated by clinical guidelines in the treatment of advanced oesophageal cancer. Oxaliplatin in 
combination with 5-FU or capecitabine are also recommended as preferred regimens in the current NCCN 
guideline and would be expected to be used in clinical practice. In addition, three drug regimens 
(including docetaxel or epirubicin) are recommended and used for medically fit patients. The broad 
indication (in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy) and the proposed 
extrapolation from the combination (cisplatin with 5-FU) are accepted as a large difference in the 
benefit/risk between different platinum compound would not be reasonably expected. Oxaliplatin is used 
as an alternative treatment option in relation to safety. A reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC is included 
in the indication (section 4,1) in order to reflect the drug regimens used in the study.     
The study recruited 749 patients with both histologies: squamous cell cancer (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma 
(AC) of the oesophagus. Enrolment of patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (EGJ) 
were  restricted  to  Siewert  I  tumours  (as  reflected  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC).  The  exclusion  of  HER-2 
positive EGJ AC patients is endorsed by the CHMP, as the standard treatment for these patients includes 
trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy. 
Stratification  factors  included  geographic  region  (Asia  versus  Rest  of  World),  tumour  histology 
(Adenocarcinoma  versus  Squamous  Cell  Carcinoma)  and  ECOG  performance  status  (0  versus  1).  PD-L1 
expression status was expected to be assessed by IHC, which is in line with routine clinical practice, and 
was quantified by means of the CPS score. Recruitment was not stratified by CPS, contrary to the Scientific 
Advice  provided  by  the  CHMP  that  underlined  a  generally  expected  variability  of  response  to  treatment 
based  on  PD-L1  status.  Among  primary  endpoints,  PD-L1-based  subgroup  analyses  were  conducted 
although restricted to the CPS≥10 stratum while the CPS<10 category was tested in a non pre-specified 
exploratory  analysis.  Comparison  between  treatment  arms  within  the  CPS≥10  and  its  complementary 
(CPS<10) subgroup showed balanced clinical and disease characteristics. The lack of stratification by PD-
L1 status is not cause of concern in the current application.

The assumptions made for median PFS (6 months) and median OS (12 months) in the control arm are in 
line with the available historical data of chemotherapy in 1L setting and support the sample size 
calculation. 
The original protocol was revised with 9 Amendments in total. Among the most relevant modifications, 
the change in biomarkers from GEP assayed in a central laboratory to PD-L1 tested in a local facility 
(Amendment n.02, 19-DEC-2017) based on recommendations from emerging data in KN180 trial showing 
a prevalence of PD-L1 in oesophageal cancer of approximately 45% using CPS ≥10, and the utility of this 
level of expression across a range of PD-L1 CPS cut points in identifying responders to pembrolizumab. 
The amendment was adopted relatively early (i.e. nine months after the original protocol); moreover, the 
study aimed at recruiting “all comers” and stratification was regardless of biomarkers. Therefore, this is 
not considered problematic in terms of data collection and analysis.  
In  the  original  protocol,  the  study  had  PFS  per  RECIST1.1  by  BICR  and  OS,  both  in  “all  comers”  (ITT 
population)  and  in  subjects  with  GEP-biomarker  positive  tumours  (later  changed  to  PD-L1  biomarker 
positive tumours; Amendment n.2), as dual primary endpoints. With Amendment n.8 (03-JAN-2020), the 
OS analysis within the ESCC tumour subtype, the ESCC tumour with CPS ≥10, and the PFS analysis in the 
ESCC population were implemented, driven by data analysed from study KN181. The study was considered 
to have met its primary objective if at least one of the above hypotheses was statistically significant. At the 
time of the amendment n. 8, recruitment was completed with a total of 749 subjects enrolled in a 1:1 ratio 
in the pembrolizumab and control arm. One of the two interim analysis (IA) originally planned was removed 
with  Amendment  9  (17-JUN-2020).  They  were  originally  planned  to  be  conducted  at  448  PFS  events  in 
patients with ESCC after approximately32 months (IA1), and at 487 PFS events in patients with ESCC after 
approx. 40 months (IA2). With amendment No. 9 these two interim analyses were combined to one analysis 
after 460 investigator-assessed PFS events in patients with ESCC after approx. 35 months. This change 
was justified by input from the FDA. 
The overall Type I error was controlled at 2.5% (1-sided), with 1.2% initially allocated to OS in ESCC with 
PD-L1 CPS ≥10, 1.1% to OS in ESCC, 0 to OS in PD-L1 CPS ≥10, 0 to OS in all subjects, 0.2% to PFS in 
ESCC, 0 to PFS in PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and 0 to PFS in all subjects.  
Finally, with Amendment n. 9 (17-JUN-2020), the MAH has also replaced the original BICR-based PFS 
analysis with Investigator-based analysis in view of a higher than expected discordance rate between 
Investigator and BICR response evaluation (26%). A sensitivity analysis testing PFS results based on 
BICR-assessment was in agreement with the Investigator-based results. Censoring of PFS-events led to 
less than expected PFS-events assessed by BICR. Sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess PFS and 
ORR as determined by BICR, which demonstrated overall similar results with these of investigator 
assessment and support the assumption that the B/R assessment is not seriously impacted by this 
change. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by BICR within the ITT population and by subgroup analysis. 
Given the differences in treatment effect on OS by geographic location, which did not emerge in the PFS 
assessment, it was questioned whether a different approach in PFS result analysis was possibly 
undertaken in Asia and Rest of World relatively to the centralised assessment. The higher than expected 
discordance rate observed in the overall population was generally consistent across Asia and ROW 
regions; no differences between areas were noted.  
Overall, statistical methods appeared not controversial. The rate of protocol deviations was similar in both 
arms and no concern is raised over possible impact of protocol deviations on efficacy results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The MAH presented the results of the interim analysis (i.e. final for PFS) of study KN-590 (data cut-off 
date of 02-JUL-2020) based on the ITT population, as defined by all randomized patients (i.e. a total of 
749 patients, 373 in pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, 376 in the chemotherapy arm), with a median 
Assessment report

follow-up of 12.6 months (range: 0.1-33.6 months) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 
9.8 months (range: 0.1-33.6 months) in the chemotherapy group. 
Baseline characteristics as well as demographics appear well balanced between treatment arms in the ITT 
population, although a higher prevalence of subjects aged ≥65 years populated the experimental arm 
(46.1% vs 39.9%); distribution of histology, region, ECOG score and PD-L1 expression were all similar 
between groups. Diversity in both geographical localization (Asia and Rest of World, 52.5% vs 47.5% 
respectively) and PD-L1 score (CPS≥10 vs <10, 51.1% vs 46.3% respectively with 1.5% not evaluable 
and 0.9% missing) was well represented. The study population was mainly composed of male participants 
(83.4% vs 16.6%), metastatic status was prevailing over unresectable tumours (91.2% vs 8.8%), and 
the majority of patients harboured squamous cell carcinoma histology (73.2% SCC vs 26.8% 
adenocarcinoma). However, the age distribution of the study population (with only 43.3% ≥ 65 years) is 
not considered representative and rather reflects the eligibility criteria only allowing patients in good 
performance status (ECOG PS 0 or 1) and with adequate organ function. Only a small proportion of 
patients was included with locally advanced/non-metastatic disease (n=66; 8.8%). Even though PD-L1 
status did not constitute a stratification factor, the distribution of clinical variables across the trial groups 
when analysed by CPS score (i.e. ESCC and PD-L1 CPS ≥10, PD-L1 positive tumours) as well as the 
assessment of baseline characteristics within the ESCC group showed a balanced diversity in treatment 
arms. 
51.1%  of  all  participants  had  tumours  that  expressed  PD-L1  CPS  ≥10.  This  proportion  was  balanced 
between treatment arms (49.9% vs. 52.4% for Pembro+Chemo vs. Chemo, respectively). In KEYNOTE-
590, the prevalence in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 was also generally similar between oesophageal squamous cell (52%) 
and adenocarcinoma (48%) .  
In participants with ESCC and PD-L1 CPS ≥10, pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy provided a 
statistically significant improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy alone (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.43, 
0.75; p<0.0001, which is below the p-value crossing boundary of 0.0067 for statistical significance) with 
a 5 month gain in median OS in the experimental arm relatively to control (13.9 months vs 8.8 months, 
respectively). A total of 215 events have occurred within this group at this stage, which accounts for a 
92.5% of the expected total events assumed at FA. Therefore, data can be considered mature. The 
subgroup analysis reveals consistency of results across patient pre-specified categories (age, sex, disease 
status, ECOG score), although a higher magnitude of effect was reached in Asia (OS HR:0.48; 95% CI: 
0.35, 0.67) compared to Rest of World (OS HR:0.79; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.28).  
Within the entire ESCC group regardless of PD-L1 score, the positive effect of pembrolizumab on OS was 
attenuated in magnitude but remains statistically significant compared to control (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 
0.60, 0.88; p<0.0006). Variability of response by geographic region (Asia HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.80; 
Rest of World HR:0.93; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.28) can be observed and a differential extent of benefit emerges 
also between sexes, the two geographic regions can be considered numerically adequate for statistical 
evaluation and well represented although two third of the total ESCC tumours were localised in Asia. 
As  part  of  exploratory  analyses,  the  MAH  presented  efficacy  data  in  the  adenocarcinoma  subtype.  As 
expected, the majority of cases were localised in Rest of World (83.6% vs 16.4% in Asia); this is the only 
notable difference in baseline characteristics compared to the ESCC participants. A survival advantage with 
pembrolizumab  was  observed  also  in  the  adenocarcinoma  group,  although  with  a  highest  degree  of 
variability  of  response  as  reflected  by  a  wider  CI  (HR:  0.74;  95%  CI:  0.54,  1.02;  p<0.0006  Overall, 
histology did not appear to be the most relevant  driver for a different treatment effect of pembrolizumab. 
Results for patients with ESCC and adenocarcinoma by PD-L1 status were provided. Interpretation of data 
is  hampered  by  the  limited  patient  numbers,  especially  in  the  smaller  subgroup  of  patients  with 
adenocarcinoma, the fact that these data represent a subgroup analysis of a subgroup and randomization 
was not stratified for both histology and PD-L1 expression status. OS results for patients with ESCC and 
Assessment report

CPS<10 indicated no benefit for the addition of pembrolizumab (OS HR 0.99). In the subgroup of patients 
with adenocarcinoma, OS data appear not reliable; the OS benefit for adenocarcinoma patients was more 
pronounced in the PD-L1 CPS <10 than their counterpart CPS ≥10 subpopulation (OS HR 0.66 vs. 0.83) 
which lacks biological plausibility and is not consistent with literature data for CPI in oesophageal-gastric 
adenocarcinoma; finally, by analysing the data with one Cox-proportional hazards model fitting two-way 
interactions  of  treatment  with  histology  and  PD-L1  status  instead  of  performing  subgroup  analyses,  the 
larger treatment effect for PD-L1 negative patients reverse to smaller treatment effects in comparison to 
PD-L1 positive patients. Although acknowledging that results of these models need to be interpreted with 
caution, as they were not pre-specified, the more powerful analysis is reasoned by the fact that all patients 
are included in this model fit and more covariates can be considered as confounders. The results of this 
model show homogeneous results in treatment effects for the PD-L1 negative population, meaning that for 
both histologies patients with CPS<10 have larger OS hazard ratios than patients with CPS≥10. This was 
also  in  line  with  results  for  PFS  and  ORR  that  showed  a  more  pronounced  treatment  effect  for 
adenocarcinoma patients with CPS≥10 compared to patients with CPS <10. 
The analysis of efficacy within the totality of PD-L1 positive tumours including both the squamous and 
adenocarcinoma subtype showed advantage of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs control in terms of 
OS (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.78; p<0.0001) with a 5 month gain in median OS in the experimental 
arm relative to control (13.5 months vs 9.4 months, respectively). However, results stratification by 
histology demonstrated a higher efficacy of pembrolizumab in the squamous histology (HR: 0.57; 95% 
CI: 0.43, 0.75) compared to adenocarcinoma (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.34); the geographic location 
impacted point estimates favouring Asia (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.67) over Rest of World (HR: 0.82; 
95% CI: 0.58, 1.16). Similarly to the observation reported for the ESCC group, Asia was the prevailing 
region within this group (63.3% vs 36.7% in Rest of World).  
Efficacy data in complementary CPS<10 tumours have been presented as exploratory analysis. CHMP had 
highlighted the necessity to account for biomarker status when planning stratification and analyses 
strategy and emphasised that “at the time of assessment, the magnitude of the effect in the overall 
population and in both biomarker positive and negative subgroups will be taken into account“ (procedure 
EMEA/H/SA/2437/19/2017/II). Within this category of patients, the CI of overall survival HR crossed 1 
(HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.10) and no gain in median OS was observed (10.5 vs 10.6 months). Overall, 
data confirm that response is PD-L1-dependent, as previously observed in other indications as well as in 
the oesophageal second line setting (KEYNOTE-181). Unlike the CPS≥10 population, in the CPS<10 group 
the effect of the combination pembrolizumab+chemotherapy was overall marginal compared to 
chemotherapy alone. The OS HR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.10). Median OS (10.5 vs 10.6 months) as 
well as OS rates at 12 and 18 months (differences 4.8% and 3.9%) were similar between the two 
treatment groups. Given the biological plausibility of a target-dependent response, the net advantage of 
pembrolizumab as add-on to chemotherapy does not appear convincing in this patient subgroup that 
represented a significant proportion (46%) of the ITT population.  
In the ITT population encompassing all histologies and PD-L1 status, pembrolizumab demonstrated 
superiority on OS relative to control (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.86; p<0.0001) with a 3 months gain in 
median OS (12.4 vs 9.8 months in control). With a total of 571 events reported at this IA, the trial 
reached 91% data maturity (627 events expected at FA). Among the pre-specified subgroup analysis, a 
different performance for pembrolizumab can be recognised by geographic location (Asia HR:0.64; 95% 
CI: 0.51, 0.81; Rest of World HR:0.83; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.05), while consistency has been shown across 
the remaining clinical categories. 
In comparing the baseline characteristics between Asia and Rest of World, it emerges a higher prevalence 
of male participants (90.1% vs 76.1%), squamous cell carcinoma (91.6% vs 52.8%) and tumours with CPS 
≥10 (53.4% vs 48.6%) in the former group. However, differences in magnitude of effect by geographic 
location persists in the individual analysis of the ESCC and CPS ≥10 subcategories. No differences emerged

between geographic area in terms of patient characteristics or study conduct or patient management that 
could possibly justify the observed better response to treatment in Asians; furthermore, no inadequacy in 
study recruitment emerged across study centres. In the European population, a non-statistically significant 
survival advantage of pembrolizumab over control can be observed (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.47, 1.10; p=ns); 
hence  a  favourable  trend  for  efficacy  can  be  concluded  upon,  although  the  limited  sample  size  is  not 
expected to provide statistical power. As for all participants, the benefit of pembrolizumab appears to be 
associated with PD-L1 expression. Median OS and 12 months OS rates are in favour of the chemotherapy 
group for European patients with CPS <10.  
The Investigator-Based PFS Analysis showed superiority of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy alone within the ESCC population (HR:0.65; 95% CI:0.54, 0.78; p<0.0001), PD-L1 
positive group (HR:0.51; 95% CI:0.41, 0.65; p<0.0001) and ITT population (HR:0.65; 95% CI:0.55, 
0.76; p<0.0001). Unlike OS, PFS results were consistent across all pre-specified patient categories, 
including geographic location. The BICR-based assessment was overall consistent with local analysis 
showing advantage of pembrolizumab over control in terms of PFS across the different patient groups, 
namely the ESCC population (HR:0.71; 95% CI:0.58, 0.87; p<0.0004), PD-L1 positive group (HR:0.60; 
95% CI:0.48, 0.75; p<0.0001) and ITT population (HR:0.67; 95% CI:0.56, 0.79; p<0.0001). Among the 
exploratory analyses, results in patients with CPS<10 showed no clinically meaningful advantage of 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01; p=0.02 with a 
gain of only 0.2 months in PFS median vs control). A beneficial effect was observed in adenocarcinoma 
patients (HR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.46,0.87; p=0.0019 and gain in 1.4 months in median PFS).  
Histology (AC vs ESCC) was one of the stratification factors. In participants with AC, baseline characteristics 
were  generally  similar  between  arms  and  consistent  with  the  all  comer  patient  population.  A  higher 
proportion of patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were ≥65 years of age (50.5% vs 
31.4%)  in  the  adenocarcinoma  population.  As  expected,  fewer  patients  with adenocarcinoma  were  from 
Asia (16.4%) compared with all participants (52.5%).   
For all comer patients, the treatment benefit of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy was similar for patients 
with adenocarcinoma and patients with squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus. 
Overall, patients appeared to benefit from the addition of pembrolizumab regardless of histology; however 
to enable a complete assessment of efficacy by PD-L1 expression status and histology, the MAH provided 
also PFS and ORR results for patients with ESCC and adenocarcinoma by PD-L1 status (CPS <10 and CPS 
≥10).  
PFS and ORR data indicate a trend towards a lower treatment effect in the PD-L1 negative population. 
Available study data with checkpoint inhibitors suggest a predictive value of PD-L1 expression status for 
gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma (Study ONO-4538-12: Opdivo in metastatic gastric cancer, KEYNOTE-
059: Keytruda in ≥3L gastric or GE junction carcinoma, KEYNOTE-061: Keytruda in 2L gastric cancer, study 
KEYNOTE-181: Keytruda in 2L oesophageal cancer, study KEYNOTE-062: Keytruda in 1L gastric cancer). 
The MAH provided analyses intended to disentangle the interaction effects of the Geographic Region, 
ESCC/AC patients, and PD-L1 positive/negative patients with the treatment effect.  
The results of the Cox regression analysis show that there is an interaction effect of treatment with PD-L1.  
The results (HR with 95% CIs by subgroup) of the following two models were provided: (i) A model fitting 
the main factors treatment arm, geographic region, tumour histology, and PD-L1 status together with two-
way interaction terms of treatment with one of the three remaining factors, and (ii) a model of treatment, 
PD-L1, histology, treatment*PDL1, Treatment * Histology, stratified by ECOG and geographic region.

Contrary to the subgroup analyses, patients with CPS≥10 show more beneficial effects from treatment than 
patients with CPS<10 for both histologies ESCC and adenocarcinoma (estimates for HR 0.86 and 0.87 for 
SCC and AC, respectively).The beneficial treatment effect for patients with CPS<10 could not be confirmed. 
Discordance between Investigator- and BICR-based assessment emerged in the evaluation of ORR. Within 
the ITT population, ORR (CR+PR) was judged similarly by Investigators (45% vs 29.3% in 
pembrolizumab and control arm, respectively) and centralised analysis (43.4% vs 29% in pembrolizumab 
and control arm, respectively). A sensitivity analysis testing PFS results based on BICR-assessment was 
in agreement with the Investigator-based results.   
Available data for patients ≥75 years (n=69; 9% of study population) suggest that these elderly patients 
do not derive a benefit by the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy (OS HR 0.98, PFS HR 0.93) in 
the overall study population. A total of 32 patients aged ≥ 75 years for PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 were enrolled in 
KEYNOTE 590 (18 in the pembrolizumab combination and 14 in the control). Taking also the considerably 
worse toxicity profile for patients ≥75 years into account, information about limited efficacy and safety data  
is included in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Overall, a trend towards a lower OS benefit was also observed for female subjects (OS HR 0.89 [0.59, 1.35] 
compared to male subjects (OS HR 0.7 [0.58, 0.84]. For female subjects whose tumours express CPS ≥10, 
OS HR was 0.67 (n=70; 95% CI 0.39, 1.17). Although conclusions are limited by even smaller numbers in 
this biomarker selected female subgroups, results are reassuring for female patients with CPS ≥10.  
The double blinded nature of the study vs placebo makes interpretation of PRO result unbiased. No 
differences were observed between treatment arms in the baseline global health status/QoL scores; also, 
changes from baseline in global health status/QoL scores evaluated at week 18 were similar between 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (LS mean: -1.74 points [95% CI: -4.24, 0.75]) and chemotherapy 
alone (LS means of -0.10 points (95% CI: -3.40, 3.20); the variation on this parameter at week 18 can 
be considered not clinically significant (<-10% cut-off). The OES-18 scores for Dysphagia, Pain and 
Reflux were all comparable between experimental and control arm. 
3.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In KEYNOTE-590, statistically significant OS, PFS and ORR results were demonstrated in the overall study 
population with oesophageal or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.  In patients whose tumours express 
PD-L1 CPS<10, although the experimental arm carried a numerical advantage in the OS and PFS HRs 
compared to the control group (0.86 and 0.80, respectively), no gain in median survivals was achieved 
with the combined therapy vs chemotherapy alone (10.5 vs 10.6 months for OS and 6.0 vs 6.1 months 
for PFS, in the experimental and control arm, respectively). A clinically meaningful benefit for the addition 
of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy could not be shown for subjects whose tumours express PD-L1 CPS 
<10. 
3.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) for the 
first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the 
oesophagus  and  gastroesophageal  junction  (Siewert  type  1)  is  from  the  ongoing  double-blind  placebo-
controlled  phase  3  study  KEYNOTE-590,  which  is  the  pivotal  for  this  application.  Safety  analyses  are

presented  by  treatment  group  (pembrolizumab/placebo  +  cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil),using  the  ASaT 
population (those who received at least 1 dose of study medication) as of the data cut-off of 02-JUL-2020.  
Adverse events (AEs) were coded using MedDRA Version 23.0 and reported according to NCI CTCAE Version 
4.03. 
In addition, the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy observed in KEYNOTE-
590 has been compared to the established safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy in all approved 
indications  (Reference  Safety  Dataset,  RSD)  and  in  participants  with  advanced/metastatic  oesophageal 
cancer in ≥2L (KEYNOTE-028 [Cohort A4], KEYNOTE-180, and KEYNOTE-181). The following 4 datasets are

 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the 
incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" not related to 
the drug are excluded.

Table 48: Subjects With Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) by Maximum Toxicity 
Grade (ASaT Population) (extract) 
Table 49: Summary of Outcome for Subjects With AEOSI (ASaT Population) (extract) 
Hypothyroidism: most AEOSI events for hypothyroidism were considered drug related (10.3%), were all 
Grade 1 or 2; at the time of data cut-off, 57.5% were not resolved, 12.5% were considered resolving and 
27.5% resolved. Only 1 out of 46 subjects with hypothyroidism received corticosteroids.  
Pneumonitis: pneumonitis occurred in 23 participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group 
(6.2%), and most of those events were considered drug related (5.9%). Almost half were grade 2 in 
severity (G1 0.8%, G2 3%, G3 1.9%, G4 0%, G5 0.5%). The median time to onset for the AEOSI 
pneumonitis in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
RSD was longer (149 vs 106 days) and lasted longer (median episode duration 216 vs 58 days). Most of 
the patients experiencing were treated with corticosteroids (78.3%), starting usually at high (≥40 
mg/day prednisone or equivalent) dose (68%). Events were mostly considered resolving (21.7%) or 
resolved (47.8%) at the time of data cut-off, while 21.7% were not resolved. 
In the 23 patients with pneumonitis in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, 3 (all G2) had prior 
thoracic radiation. In the 2 participants in the chemotherapy group who had pneumonitis, 1 (G1) had 
prior thoracic radiation. The small number of participants with pneumonitis who had prior thoracic 
radiation precludes clinically meaningful conclusions about the role of prior radiation in the events.

Hyperthyroidism: most AEOSI events for hyperthyroidism were considered drug related (5.4%), the 
majority were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and at the time of data cut-off, the majority (66.7%) were 
considered resolved. 
Laboratory findings 
In KEYNOTE-590 study, the most frequently reported (≥5%) laboratory abnormalities were similar in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and the chemotherapy group, and the majority were CTCAE 
Grade 1 to 2 toxicity. The largest between-treatment difference (>5%) in laboratory abnormalities (all 
grades) between the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with the chemotherapy were: ALT 
increased (23.2% vs 17.7%), calcium decreased (43.8% vs 37.6%), calcium increased (7.5% vs 12.6%), 
and phosphate decreased (36.9% vs 30.5%). There was 1 participant in each treatment arm of KN590 
who met the specified threshold of abnormal hepatic tests (i.e., AST or ALT ≥3x the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and total bilirubin ≥2x ULN and alkaline phosphatase <2× ULN).  
The following Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported with an incidence ≥5% and were 
higher (≥5% point difference) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD: Haemoglobin decreased (20.9% vs 6.4%), leukocytes decreased 
(20.9% vs 0.8%), lymphocytes decreased (22.3% vs 11.0%), neutrophils decreased (43.3% vs 1.9%), 
potassium decreased (11.9% vs 2.3%), and sodium decreased (19.2% vs 8.3%). Those are consistent 
with the established safety profiles of the chemotherapies. 
In the pool of patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, the proportion of 
patients who experienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 
33.0% for neutrophils decreased, 25.5% for lymphocytes decreased, 20.3% for haemoglobin decreased, 
19.3% for leucocytes decreased, 13.9% for sodium decreased, 10.8% for platelets decreased, 9.7% for 
phosphate decreased, 8.4% for potassium decreased, 7.6% for glucose increased, 3.9% for AST 
increased, 3.8% for potassium increased, 3.7% for calcium decreased, 3.6% for ALT increased, 3.1% for 
creatinine increased, 3.0% for albumin decreased, 2.2% for calcium increased, 1.6% for alkaline 
phosphatase increased, 1.2% for bilirubin increased, 0.8% for glucose decreased,  and 0.4% for sodium 
increased (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

Post marketing experience 
The  safety  profile of  pembrolizumab  was  summarized  in the  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  covering the 
period 04-SEP-2018 through 03-SEP-2019. No revocation or withdrawal of pembrolizumab registration for 
safety reasons has occurred in any country. Within the period reviewed, 3,776,415 dosage units were sold 
in  post-authorisation  setting  (cumulatively  7,684,671).  The  cumulative  post-marketing  exposure  of  the 
previous PSUR was approximately 99,173 patient-years of treatment with pembrolizumab. 
From  clinical  trials,  a  total  of  32,845  serious  adverse  events  were  reported  cumulatively.  From  post-
authorisation  sources,  a  total  of  53,255  adverse  reactions  were  reported  cumulatively  (36,092 
spontaneous;  17,163    solicited).  Of  these,  15,653  reactions  were  considered  non-serious  and  37,602 
reactions  were  classified  as  serious  (20,439  spontaneous;  17,163  solicited).  During  the  period  under

review, there were 8,569 serious spontaneous; 5,703 non-serious spontaneous and 6,139 serious solicited. 
The  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  reactions  during  the  period  under  review  are  malignant 
neoplasm  progression,  death  and  known  immune-related  adverse  reactions  such  as  colitis,  hepatitis, 
pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease, thyroid disorders and adrenal insufficiency. 
3.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data  from  the  primary  analysis  of  the  pivotal  study  KEYNOTE-590  (KN590)  with data  cut-off of  02-JUL-
2020 were submitted. 
The median duration of exposure to therapy was similar between the two arms of KN590 study (5.7 vs 5.1 
months). The median number of cycles of pembrolizumab in the experimental arm of KN590 were doubled 
compared to the oesophageal monotherapy dataset (8 vs 4), which can be explained by the more advanced 
setting of the studies included in the pooled dataset. Treatment with 5-FU may have continued beyond 6 
cycles per local standard up to 35 cycles: median number of 5-FU cycles were 6 in both arms of KN590, as 
this was balanced no impact on efficacy or safety results are expected.   
Regarding  the  summary  of  adverse  events,  no  major  relevant  differences  are  observed  between 
pembrolizumab + platinum/5-FU vs placebo + platinum-5-FU, also after adjusting for exposure. The noted 
exception is that more patients discontinued any drug due to drug-related AEs (19.5% vs 11.6%) and drug-
related  SAEs  (10.3%  vs  4.6%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  combination  arm,  and  a  small  difference  of  the 
discontinuation rate is maintained after exposure adjustment. In addition, the observed incidence of related 
SAEs  (31.6%  vs  26.2%)  and  drug-related  Grade  3-5  AEs  (71.9%  vs  67.6%)  was  higher  for  the 
pembrolizumab chemo combo, as well as few more deaths due to drug-related AEs were observed (9 vs 5 
deaths, i.e. 2.4% vs 1.4%).   
As expected, the toxicity in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm of KN590 study was worse compared 
to pembrolizumab monotherapy in the oesophageal dataset and in the RSD.  
To better contextualize KN590 safety data with respect to the overall toxicity of pembrolizumab given with 
chemotherapy, a pooled safety dataset representing the established safety profile for pembrolizumab plus 
platinum-based chemotherapy in currently EU approved indications was provided (KN-021, KN-189, KN-
407 and KN-048 studies). KN-590 appears to have a quite similar summary of adverse events, with the 
exception of a higher incidence of Grade 3-5 (85-9% vs 75%) and drug-related grade 3-5 AEs (71.9% vs 
57.4%). However, since a higher incidence is also noted in the placebo+chemotherapy arm of KN-590, this 
could be related to backbone chemotherapy and baseline disease.    
In  KN590  a  comparison  of  the  frequencies  of  the  most  common  AEs  by  treatment  group  showed  high 
incidences of nausea, anaemia, decreased appetite and constipation in both arms (>40%). Higher rates of 
fatigue,  WBC  count  decreased,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  rash,  hypothyroidism  and  pruritus  were 
observed  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  group  than  in  the  chemotherapy  group,  and  remained 
higher even after adjustment for exposure, with the exception of fatigue and neutrophil count decreased. 
Severe skin reactions and hypothyroidism are known AEOSI for pembrolizumab. The differences in safety 
profile observed between the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm of KN590 and the monotherapy datasets 
are consistent with the established safety profiles of the chemotherapies administered. 
Regarding drug-related AEs pembrolizumab + chemotherapy could be regarded as comparable to 
placebo+chemotherapy; differences (>3%) were detected for neutrophil count decreased and white blood 
cell count decreased toxicities with higher incidences in the pembrolizumab+chemotherapy arm; anaemia 
was reported with higher rates in the placebo+chemotherapy arm. When comparing the pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy KN590 Dataset with the monotherapy RSD, the rates for drug-related AEs were overall 
significantly higher, as expected.   
Assessment report  
EMA/331504/2021

In both arms, most of the AEs were Grade 3-5, with similar rate in both arms (85.9% vs 86.2%). Neutrophil 
count decreased, anemia, neutropenia and hyponatremia were the most common G3-5 AEs in both arms 
(≥10%).  Despite  the  higher  incidence  of  WBC  and  neutrophil  count  decrease  in  the  pembrolizumab  + 
chemotherapy  arm,  observed  also  after  adjustment  for  exposure,  rates  of  febrile  neutropenia  were 
comparable between the 2 groups (3.2% vs 4.1%). As expected, G3-5 AEs occurred more frequently when 
pembrolizumab was administered with chemotherapy than as a single agent (85.9% vs 48.1% in the RSD), 
and reflected the known safety profile of the cytotoxic agents and the underlying oesophageal disease. 
Drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs occurred also at similar rate in the two treatment arms (71.9% vs 67.6%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  Grade  3  to  5  AEs  in  both  treatment  arms  were  decreased 
neutrophil  count,  neutropenia  and  anaemia.  The  rate  of  drug-related  grade  3-5  febrile  neutropenia  was 
similar between arms (3% vs 3.8%), with one death due to febrile neutropenia in each arm. A total of 7 
cases (1.9%) of grade 3-5 drug-related pneumonitis occurred in the pembrolizumab combination arm, vs 
none in the control. This incidence is however similar to the pembrolizumab monotherapy safety datasets 
(1.3%) and therefore can be considered consistent with the known pembrolizumab safety profile. Compared 
to the monotherapy safety datasets, the overall incidence of drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs was substantially 
higher in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (71.9% vs 15.5% in the RSD).  
The overall incidence of SAEs was approximately 55% in both treatment groups of KN590 study, pneumonia 
being  the  most  common  SAE  in  both  arms  (10.3%  vs  8.6%);  although  at  higher  incidence  in  the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group, reassuringly no difference is observed when pneumonia is adjusted 
for exposure (15 vs 17.2 Events/100 person-year). Drug-related SAE by investigator also occurred at a 
similar incidence in the two arms (31.6% vs 26.2%), but were numerically higher compared to the RSD, 
which  seems  to  generally  reflect  the  course  of  the  chemotherapy  (cisplatin  and  5-fluorouracil)  and  the 
underlying disease.  
It  is  noted  that  incidence  of  acute  kidney  injury  SAE  was  almost  doubled  in  the  pembrolizumab  + 
chemotherapy group compared to the chemotherapy group of KN590 study (3% vs 1.6%), as well as Grade 
3-5 events (2.7% vs 1.9%), including one fatal grade 5 event (vs none in the SOC). Acute kidney injury 
lead  also  more  frequently  to  treatment  discontinuation  in  the  experimental  arm  (1.1%  vs  0.5%).  Acute 
kidney injury is reported as a common ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is considered sufficient at 
this stage based on the data provided. Narratives for the 13 cases (8 in the pembro combo and 5 in the 
control  arm  of  KN590)  of  acute  kidney  injury  were  reviewed,  all  (except  of  1  fatal  event  in  the 
pembrolizumab and chemotherapy arm) were Grade 2-3 and often resolved or resolving. All events were 
considered related to cisplatin. Incidences are too small and the difference in incidences between the control 
and the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm is not clear enough to allow any conclusions about potential 
additive effects of pembrolizumab on the known renal toxicities of cisplatin. 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death was not worse with the combination pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (28 vs 38 patients, 7.6% vs 10.3%). The most frequently 
reported AEs leading to death in the pembrolizumab combination arm were related to respiratory infections 
(pneumonia,  pneumonia  aspiration,  and  pulmonary  sepsis).  Pneumonia  was  the  most  common  cause  of 
death in the chemotherapy arm as well. The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death in the pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy group (7.6%) was higher than that of the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (5.3%), but 
similar to the oesophageal monotherapy dataset (8.5%); in this latter dataset, again respiratory infections 
(pneumonia  aspiration  and  pneumonia)  were  the  most  frequent  cause  of  death,  which  appeared  to  be 
related to the underlying oesophageal disease. 
Deaths considered drug-related by the investigator were 9 vs 5 (2.4% vs 1.4%) in the pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy vs chemotherapy arm of KN590 study. Although drug-related death has been observed at 
higher incidence in the experimental arm, such difference appears negligible after adjustment for exposure

(0.28 vs 0.20 event/100 person-month), which is reassuring. In most of the cases, it is difficult to clearly 
attribute the events to one or the other drug of the combination.  
The  most  common  AEOSI  categories  (≥5%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  were 
hypothyroidism,  pneumonitis,  and  hyperthyroidism,  having  similar  incidences  to  the  pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD. The majority of AEOSI reported in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group were mild 
to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). There were two cases of fatal AEOSI (pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease, 
vs 1 patient in the control arm who died due for pneumonitis).  
The rate of pneumonitis was 6.2% for the combination (vs 0.5% in the chemotherapy arm), higher than 
what was reported with pembrolizumab alone (5.2% in the oesophageal dataset and 4.5% in the RSD), 
which  were  also  more  severe.  The  exposure-adjusted  rate  of  pneumonitis  showed  a  similar  event  rate 
compared  to  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  oesophageal  dataset,  the  latter  slightly  higher  than  the 
monotherapy RSD, possibly related to the oesophageal localization of the disease than of the combination 
in itself. Due to the small number of patients with pneumonitis who had prior thoracic RT, it is not possible 
to draw meaningful conclusion about the role of prior thoracic RT in the risk of pneumonitis.  
No  new  safety  concerns  based  on  laboratory  abnormalities  were  reported  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus 
chemotherapy group, and differences observed between pembrolizumab combination and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy are consistent with the established safety profile of the chemotherapy drugs administered.  
While  the  incidence  of  AEs  (24.3%  vs  20%)  and  SAEs  (15.7%  vs  12.7%)  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation was higher in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm vs chemotherapy, the difference 
between arms is reduced when adjusted for exposure. Pneumonia, blood creatinine increase, pneumonitis 
and  acute  kidney  injury  were  the  most  common  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  in  the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group.    
Most  of  the  patients  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  group  had  treatment  interruption  of  any 
treatment  due  to  AEs  (70.8%  vs  65.4%),  and  almost  half  of  the  subjects  in  both  arms  interrupted  all 
treatment drugs.  
Safety profile by subgroups: The AE profile according to age in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group was generally similar between participants who were <65 years and ≥65 years, with the exception 
of discontinuation due to AE/SAE which occurred more frequently in the older age group, although the same 
trend is observed also in the chemotherapy arm.  
When safety is analysed by age groups (<65, 65-74, 75-84, 85+), in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
arm  an  increased  percentage  of  patients  who  experienced  Grade  3-5  AEs,  SAE,  death  due  to  AEs  and 
discontinuation in the 75-84 age group is observed compared to younger patients. The same trend is seen 
in the chemotherapy arm only for death due to drug-related AEs and treatment discontinuation. The toxicity 
of the pembrolizumab combination in patients aged 75-84 appears to be overall higher compared to the 
same age group of the chemotherapy arms (G3-5 AEs and drug-related AEs, SAE and drug-related SAE, 
death due to AE, discontinuation due to SAE and drug-related SAE, as well as slight increase in CNS and 
AE related to falling, CV and cerebrovascular events, infections).  
In KEYNOTE 590, patients aged ≥75 years reported higher incidences (>10% difference) of Grade 3 to 
5 AEs (84% vs. 75%), SAEs (78% vs. 50%), drug-related SAE (57% vs. 34%), deaths (27% vs. 13%), 
discontinuations due to SAEs (38% vs. 25%) and discontinuations due to drug-related SAEs (27% vs. 16%) 
in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared to the chemotherapy group. Even in exposure 
adjusted analyses higher event rates were reported for pneumonitis (23 vs. 0 events/100 person year), 
pneumonia (45 vs. 12 events), neutrophil count decreased (96 vs. 35 events), diarrhea (40 vs. 6 events), 
vomiting (18 vs. 6 events), hyponatremia (74 vs. 35 events) and hypophosphatemia (23 vs. 0 events). 
Higher events for exposure-adjusted SAEs in the combination arm were reported for example for the SOCs 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (57  vs.  17  events/100  person  year),  infections  and  infestations  (74  vs.  56

events), metabolism and nutrition disorders (51 vs. 12 events), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders  (62  vs.  17  events).  In  conclusion,  data  from  KN-590  study  showed  a  clear  trend  towards  an 
increased toxicity for patients aged ≥75 years thus raising concern over the tolerability of pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherapy combination in the elderly.  
This increased risk of AEs in the elderly should be considered in the context of an expected lower benefit 
with higher age (see clinical efficacy). The limited sample size is acknowledged, however as the median 
age  of  patients  with  oesophageal  cancer  is  approximately  68  years,  the  B/R  in  elderly  is  of  special 
importance. As a result, it is considered clinically relevant to inform physicians in the SmPC (leaving room 
to treat especially fit patients despite the nominal age).  
The tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in patients aged ≥ 75 was questioned also 
in  the  assessment  of  previously  approved  combinations  of  pembrolizumab  plus  platinum-based 
chemotherapy  in  HNSCC  and  NSCLC  (see  EPAR  var  II/60  and  II/65).  However,  the  limited  number  of 
subjects in this age category in KN590 as well as in previous clinical trials hampered definitive conclusion. 
A  pooled  safety  analysis  of  KN590  with  pivotal  studies  for  the  EU  approved  combo  indications  (KN021, 
KN189,  KN407  and  KN048)  included  128  vs  114  patients  75  years  and  older  in  the  pembrolizumab 
combination  vs  chemotherapy,  respectively,  representing  approximately  9%  of  the overall population.  A 
trend  toward  higher  incidence  of  overall  toxicity  by  class  of  age  is  observed  in  the  pembrolizumab 
combination  pooled  arm,  although  the  same  trend  is  present  also  in  the  chemotherapy  group.  When 
comparing each class of age (<65, 65-74, >=75) in both arms, overall a higher toxicity is evident with the 
addition of Keytruda to the combination. 
Acknowledging the limited number, no meaningful differences in the overall AE profile between male and 
female participants are observed. 
The  AE  profile  based  on  region  (EU  vs  Ex-EU)  did  not  show  relevant  differences,  although  with  the 
limitations of interpretability of the small sample size in the EU. 
3.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  combination  of  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  did  not  widely  worsen  the  overall  toxicity  of 
chemotherapy alone. The safety profile of the combination reflected the established safety profiles of the 
chemotherapy  administered  (cisplatin  and  5-Fluoruracil)  and  of  pembrolizumab  monotherapy.  Toxicities 
could be mainly attributed to the chemotherapy regimen and the underlying disease. AEOSI were similar 
to the established  safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy. Data from KEYNOTE-590 study showed 
a trend towards an increased toxicity for patients aged ≥75 years, thus raising concern over the tolerability 
of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy combination in the elderly. No new safety concerns were identified.

4.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
4.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  oesophagus  or  HER-2  negative  gastroesophageal  junction 
adenocarcinoma in adults.  
The  CHMP  adopted  an  extension  of  indication  for  KEYTRUDA,  in  combination  with  platinum  and 
fluoropyrimidine  based  chemotherapy,  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced 
unresectable  or  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  oesophagus  or  HER-2  negative  gastroesophageal  junction 
adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 10. 
4.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, the management of inoperable locally advanced and/or metastatic (stage IV) disease is palliative 
in intent, with different chemotherapy-based options being indicated as first-line option in fit patients. For 
HER-2 negative adenocarcinoma (AC) tumours, doublet combinations of platinum (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, or 
carboplatin)  and  fluoropyrimidines  (5-FU  or  capecitabine)  are  generally  used;  triplet  regimens  with  the 
addition of anthracycline or taxanes can also be considered, although controversy remains as regards their 
clinical advantage. In HER-2 positive AC tumours, trastuzumab in addition to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or 
cisplatin and capecitabine is indicated. In SCC, cisplatin-based combinations showed increased response 
rate  but  no  survival  gain compared  with  monotherapy;  overall,  results  with  palliative  chemotherapy  are 
worse than AC tumours (for references see section 3.1.1. ) 
4.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-590  is  an  ongoing,  Phase  3,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multisite  study  to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-FU) 
versus  chemotherapy  (cisplatin  with  5-FU)  as  1L  treatment  in  participants  with  locally  advanced 
unresectable  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  or  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  oesophagus  or 
advanced/metastatic Siewert type 1 adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction 
4.2.  Favourable effects 
In  participants  with  ESCC  and  PD-L1  CPS  ≥10,  pembrolizumab  as  add-on  to  chemotherapy  provided  a 
statistically significant improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy alone (HR:0.57; 95% CI: 0.43, 
0.75; p<0.0001) 
Within the entire ESCC group regardless of PD-L1 score, the positive effect of pembrolizumab on OS was 
attenuated in magnitude but remains statistically significant compared to control (HR:0.72; 95% CI: 0.60, 
0.88; p<0.0006). 
OS  analysis  in  the  adenocarcinoma  subtype  showed  superiority  of  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  vs 
control (HR:0.74; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.02; p<0.0006). 
Within the totality of PD-L1 positive tumours pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was more advantageous 
than control in terms of OS (HR:0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.78; p<0.0001). 
Within  the  ITT  population  encompassing  all  histologies  and  PD-L1  status,  pembrolizumab  demonstrated 
superiority  on  OS  relative  to  control  (HR:0.73;  95%  CI:  0.62,  0.86;  p<0.0001)  with  a  3  month  gain  in 
median OS (12.4 vs 9.8 months in control).

Investigator-Based Analysis showed superiority of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
alone  within  the  ESCC  population  (HR:0.65;  95%  CI:0.54,  0.78;  p<0.0001),  PD-L1  positive  group 
(HR:0.51; 95% CI:0.41, 0.65; p<0.0001) and ITT population (HR:0.65; 95% CI:0.55, 0.76; p<0.0001). 
Within  the  ITT  population,  ORR  (CR+PR)  was  judged  similarly  by  Investigators  (45%  vs  29.3%  in 
pembrolizumab and control arm, respectively) and centralised analysis (43.4% vs 29% in pembrolizumab 
and control arm, respectively). 
4.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
• 
The  benefit  in  the  overall  study  population  was  driven  by  the  biomarker  positive  subgroup.  No 
clinically  meaningful  benefit  was  observed  for  subjects  whose  tumours  express  PD-L1  CPS  <10 
(n=347). 
CPS <10: 
OS HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.68, 1.10) 
median OS 10.5 vs. 10.6 months 
PFS HR 0.8 (95% CI 0.64, 1.01) 
median PFS 6.2 vs. 6.0 months 
ORR difference 6.8% 
38.9% vs. 32.0% 
• 
Elderly patients ≥75 years do not derive an obvious benefit (n=69; OS HR 0.98, PFS HR 0.93) in 
the  overall  study  population.  Data  are  limited  in  patients  ≥ 75 years  for  pembrolizumab  in 
chemotherapy combination in patients with oesophageal carcinoma as reflected in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
4.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs (incidence ≥ 40%) in both arms were nausea, anemia, decreased appetite, fatigue 
and  constipation.  Higher  rates  of  fatigue,  WBC  count  decreased,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  rash, 
hypothyroidism  and  pruritus  were  observed  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  group  than  in  the 
chemotherapy  group,  and  remained  higher  even  after  adjustment  for  exposure,  with  the  exception  of 
fatigue and neutrophil count decreased. 
The rate of Grade 3 to 5 AEs in KEYNOTE-590 was similar in both arms (85.9% vs 86.2%). Neutrophil 
count  decreased,  anemia,  neutropenia  and  hyponatremia  were  the  most  common  G3-5  AEs  (incidence 
≥10%). Reassuringly, rates of febrile neutropenia were comparable between the 2 groups (3.2% vs 4.1%). 
The  overall  incidence of  SAEs was  approximately  55%  in both treatment  groups  of  KN590  study,  being 
pneumonia the most common SAE in both arms (10.3% vs 8.6%). The largest difference between treatment 
arms was noted for the SAE pneumonitis (3.2% vs 0%). 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death was 7.6% vs 10.3%. The most frequently reported AEs 
leading to death were related to respiratory infections in both arms of KN590 as well as in the oesophageal 
pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset, which is possibly related to the oesophageal site of the tumour. 
Drug-related deaths according to the investigator were 9 vs 5 (2.4% vs 1.4%), although such difference 
appears negligible after adjustment for exposure (0.28 vs 0.20 event/100 person-month) 
The incidence of AEOSI in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was 25.7%. The most common 
AEOSI  categories  (≥5%)  in  the  pembrolizumab  plus  chemotherapy  group  were  hypothyroidism, 
pneumonitis, and hyperthyroidism. Grade 3 to 5 AEOSI occurred in 7% of participants, including 2 fatal 
cases (pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease). 
Treatment discontinuation occurred in 24.3% vs 20% due to AEs and in 15.7% vs 12.7% due to SAEs 
in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm vs chemotherapy, respectively. The difference between arms

is  reduced  when  adjusted  for  exposure.  Pneumonia,  blood  creatinine  increase,  pneumonitis  and  acute 
kidney injury were the most common AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Data from KN-590 study showed a clear trend towards an increased toxicity for patients aged ≥75 years, 
thus  raising  concern  over the tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  +  chemotherapy  combination  in  the  elderly. 
This is also relevant in the context of an expected lower benefit with higher age (see clinical efficacy). The 
limited sample size is acknowledged, however as the median age of patients with oesophageal cancer is 
considered  to  be  68  years,  the  B/R  in  elderly  is  of  special  importance  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.1  of  the 
SmPC).

4.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
4.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The combination of pembrolizumab + cisplatin/5-fluorouracil provided a clinically and statistically significant 
advantage on primary and secondary outcomes over chemotherapy alone in the ITT population. However, 
these results were driven by the treatment effect of pembrolizumab in the biomarker positive subgroup and 
the observed benefit for subjects whose tumours express PD-L1 CPS <10, representing approximately half 
of the study population, cannot be regarded as clinically meaningful. 
The combination pembrolizumab + cisplatin/5-fluoruracil causes an increase in toxicity as the typical AE 
of checkpoint inhibition do not overlap with the toxicity of chemotherapy. As chemotherapy in itself is 
already rather toxic the increase toxicity by the combination is not reflected in simple metrics such as 
patients with SAE or higher grade AE. Nonetheless, higher toxicity rates were reported for nearly all 
categories in the pembrolizumab/chemo combination compared to the chemotherapy control or the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy reference data; however, no new safety concerns were identified. For 
elderly patients (≥75 years) increased toxicity is noted compared to chemotherapy alone.  
4.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Study KEYNOTE-590 demonstrated a clinically relevant advantage in OS, PFS and ORR of pembrolizumab 
in combination with cisplatin/5-fluoruracil compared to chemotherapy alone in the first line treatment of 
advanced/metastatic oesophageal cancer patients. However, the observed benefit in the large CPS<10 
subgroup is not considered to outweigh the increased toxicity that is associated with the add-on therapy. 
4.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Considerations regarding the benefit in the PD-L1 CPS<10 subgroup: 
The treatment benefit of pembrolizumab in the overall study population is driven by the subgroup of patients 
with high PD-L1 expression status. For participants whose tumours express PD-L1 CPS <10, the OS HR was 
0.86 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.10). Median OS (10.5 vs 10.6 months) as well as OS rates at 12 and 18 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/331504/2021 
Page 122/126 
 
 
 
 
 
(differences 4.8% and 3.9%) were similar between the two treatment groups. OS KM curves illustrate that 
the  OS  curve  of  the  combination  therapy  lies only  marginally  above the  chemotherapy  arm  and  a  small 
separation  is  shown  only  from  months  11  onwards.  Taken  together,  the  OS  curves  indicate  that  only 
uncertain or little survival advantage by the addition of pembrolizumab to the combination therapy. This is 
also reflected by the OS events: n=132 (75.4%) in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm compared to 
n=139 (80.8%) in the placebo + chemotherapy arm. The difference in ORR rate was 6.8% in the PD-L1 
<10 subgroup (difference in patient numbers with response n=13 for the 175 patients in the PD-L1 <10 
population). A clinically meaningful benefit could neither be shown regarding PFS (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.64, 
1.01) in the PD-L1 <10 subgroup; Median PFS is 6.2 vs 6.0 months, the difference in the PFS rate is 4% at 
12 and 18 months. For comparison, in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, the OS HR was 0.62, the PFS HR was 
0.51 and the difference in ORR was 24%.  
It is acknowledged that efficacy analyses in the PD-L1 CPS <10 population were not prespecified and PD-
L1 expression was not included as stratification factor. Nonetheless, biomarker negative patients represent 
nearly  half  of  the  study  population,  the  distribution  of  PD-L1  expression  status  was  balanced  between 
treatment arms and the difference in treatment effect in both biomarker subgroups is biologically plausible 
in view of the MoA and consistent considering the known predictive value based on previous study results 
in gastroesophageal cancer. The CHMP had highlighted the necessity to account for biomarker status when 
planning  stratification  and  analyses  strategy  and  emphasised  that  “at  the  time  of  assessment,  the 
magnitude of the effect in the overall population and in both biomarker positive and negative subgroups 
will be taken into account“ (procedure EMEA/H/SA/2437/19/2017/II). 
The overall evidence appears to suggest that indeed only very few patients would benefit from the addition 
of pembrolizumab to the already toxic chemotherapy combination. In this context, the rather vulnerable 
and  in  clinical  practise  mostly  elderly  patient  population  and  the  palliative  treatment  setting  should  be 
considered. Exposing all patients to the additional toxicity of pembrolizumab when only half of the patient 
population would be expected to benefit with a reasonable probability is not considered justified. The B/R 
would be judged differently in a situation, where the experimental therapy could be applied as an alternative 
treatment  and  with  a  possibly  different  safety  profile  providing  further  treatment  options  for  individual 
treatment decisions. 
To conclude, the add-on nature of the proposed treatment inevitably carries increased toxicity to patients, 
which are even more compelling in elderly people. Within the setting of a combined therapy, the 
uncertainties around the add-on efficacy is a critical aspect to conclude on a favourable B/R ratio. In this 
case, the uncertainties in efficacy relatively to increased toxicity, render the benefit/risk balance 
unfavourable in the CPS<10 group. 
4.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda in combination with platinum-and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for 
the 1L treatment of patients with advanced oesophageal or EGJ carcinoma is positive for the biomarker 
positive subgroup PD-L1 CPS≥10.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 20 May 2021 
Keytruda EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0097 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the following restricted new indication for Keytruda: in combination with platinum and 
fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced 
unresectable or metastatic carcinoma of the oesophagus or HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 10. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
Within the ITT population, encompassing patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression, the add on of 
pembrolizumab to chemotherapy demonstrated superiority on OS relative to chemotherapy alone 
(HR:0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.86; p<0.0001). Therefore, the pivotal trial for this application was positive on 
the primary endpoint in the all-comer population. 
In the subgroup of patients with CPS<10, the OS HR was 0.86 (95%CI 0.68-1.10). The size of this 
subgroup does not allow for an independent establishment of efficacy with statistical certainty. However, 
the reality of an effect is supported by a PFS HR of 0.8 (95%CI 0.64-1.01) and a modest increase in 
objective response rate. While the addition of Keytruda to chemotherapy does increase toxicity, this is 
considered moderate and manageable.  
Thus, a positive B/R has been demonstrated in the full study population. 
Given these circumstances, we do not support the decision to limit the indication to patients with a CPS 
score ≥10.

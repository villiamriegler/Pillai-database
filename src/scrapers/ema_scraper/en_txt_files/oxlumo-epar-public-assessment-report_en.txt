1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Alnylam Netherlands B.V. submitted on 31 March 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Oxlumo, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 March 2018. 
Oxlumo, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/16/1637 on 21 March 2016 in the 
following condition: treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. 
Oxlumo was granted eligibility to PRIME on 22 March 2018 in the following indication:  treatment of 
primary hyperoxaluria Type 1. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
• 
Primary hyperoxaluria Type 1 is a serious genetic condition resulting in end-stage renal disease 
for which there are no effective treatments other than organ transplantation and pyridoxine 
which could delay disease progression but only in a sub-set of affected patients.  
The mechanism of action of lumasiran provides strong biological plausibility as an effective 
treatment for the whole target population.  
•  Despite the limited data available data, both non-clinical and clinical consistently demonstrate 
a dramatic decrease in urinary oxalate levels. The results show 24-h urinary oxalate excretion 
close to normalisation at end of observation period in both cohorts of treated patients, meeting 
the definition of positive response reported with existing therapies. 
The applicant applied for the following indication the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) 
in all age groups. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0004/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-002079-PIP01-16-M01 was not yet 
completed as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Oxlumo as an orphan medicinal product in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 7/112 
 
 
 
 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/oxlumo. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance lumasiran contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for Oxlumo (lumasiran) is for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 
(PH1) in all age groups. 
PH1 is a rare, progressive, and potentially life-threatening, autosomal recessive inborn error of 
metabolism, resulting in increased endogenous hepatic production of oxalate, the key toxic metabolite 
responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. In addition to PH1, two other types of primary 
hyperoxaluria (PH) have been identified that result from different enzymatic defects; PH1 accounts for 
approximately 80% of PH cases and is the most clinically severe. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The incidence of PH1 is estimated to be approximately 1 in 120,000 live births, and the prevalence is 1 
to 3 per million in North America and Europe (Cochat and Rumsby 2013; Hopp et.al 2015; Hoppe 
2010). At the time of orphan designation in 2017 by the COMP, the decision was based on an 
estimated prevalence of 0.05 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). This was considered 
equivalent to a total of around 2,600 people (in the EEC region). The disease is more prevalent in 
areas with founder mutations and where consanguineous marriages are common, including the Middle 
East and Northern Africa.  PH1 usually presents as a paediatric disease, with symptoms first appearing 
before 6 years of age in more than half of patients. Underdiagnosis is likely common due to the broad 
phenotypic heterogeneity and known delays in diagnosing patients with PH1. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
PH1 results from a mutation of the AGXT (Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase) gene leading to low 
activity with a high variety of the type of underlying mutation, and consequently, also the clinical 
course of the disease. The reduced or absent AGT activity leads to inability to convert glyoxylate into 
glycine with the excess substrate then converted into oxalate, leading to a several fold increase in 
plasma and urine levels of oxalate. Figure 1 describes the state of a healthy person, the state of 
patients with PH1, and the proposed Mechanism of Action (MoA) of the compound: 
Figure 1: Normal metabolism, defect in PH1, and proposed Mechanism of action of lumasiran. 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 11/112 
 
 
 
 
 
The deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme AGT, leads to an accumulation of glyoxylate which is 
converted into oxalate. Hepatic oxalate overproduction, results in calcium crystal formation PH1 
frequently have renal stones, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure that may ultimately result in cardiac, 
ocular, dermal, and other systemic manifestations of the disease 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Hepatic oxalate overproduction, due to the deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme AGT is 
converted into oxalate and results in calcium crystal formation, leading to urolithiasis, 
nephrocalcinosis, renal impairment and end-stage renal disease, as well as systemic oxalosis with 
manifestations in bone (pain, anaemia, fractures), skin, blood vessels (calcification, pulmonary 
hypertension), heart (cardiac failure, arrhythmias), eyes, and nerves. 
Generally, three types of disease manifestation are described: 
An infantile-onset disease with early nephrocalcinosis and rapid progression to renal failure due to 
increased oxalate load and immature glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a disease type manifesting with 
recurrent kidney stones in adolescence or early adulthood associated with rapid deterioration of renal 
function, and a late-onset disease type  with only occasional kidney stone passages and, less 
commonly, ESRD as the first symptom in adulthood. 
In addition to these clinical presentations, some patients are diagnosed only after they have 
progressed to ESRD, undergone kidney transplantation, and rapidly developed oxalate deposition in 
the transplanted kidney. A minority of patients are identified through familial testing, as full siblings of 
patients with PH1 each have a 25% risk of also having the disease. Thus, siblings are often screened to 
detect subclinical or early disease. Regardless of disease manifestation, severity, or age of onset, the 
pathophysiology of PH1 is the same across the entire patient population. 
Published natural history data have shown that, in a cohort of 247 PH1 patients, 24% of patients were 
in ESRD by age 20 years, 57% by 40 years, and 88% by 60 years (Hopp et.al, 2015). 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is currently no licensed medicinal product available for the treatment of PH1. 
The current clinical standard of care uses the following treatments: 
- 
Hyperhydration and inhibitors of crystallization: 
Patients with preserved renal function are treated with hyperhydration and crystallization inhibitors 
order to slow the progression of disease and decrease the incidence of renal stones. The amount of 
fluid is usually high, and burdensome, especially in the paediatric age. Infants and younger children 
who are unable to comply may even require a gastrostomy or nasogastric tube for continuous day and 
night hyperhydration. The treatment with crystallization inhibitors is also not without problems, owing 
to the taste of these products. 
- 
Pyridoxine 
The treatment of pyridoxine (Vit. B6) is based on the fact that pyridoxine is a cofactor of alanine-
glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), potentially correcting the peroxisome to mitochondrion AGT 
mistargeting that is associated with some of the mutations in the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 
(AGXT) gene, which codifies for AGT. Hence, the treatment is only successful in a part of the patients, 
and the percentage (for successful treatment) as given by the applicant is 5 %.

- 
Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) and Transplantation (liver transplantation, or combined 
kidney and liver transplantation; LTx or combined LTx/KTx) 
Patients with deteriorating kidney function regularly require RRT or transplantation. Depending on the 
overall oxalate level a regular dialysis schedule (3x/week) is often not sufficient, and intensive RRT 
(6x/week with added peritoneal dialysis) is frequently needed. Some experts also recommend pre-
emptive (combined) transplantation therapy, reflecting the serious prognosis of the disease, once 
kidney function starts to deteriorate. The perioperative mortality in patients undergoing combined 
KTx/LTx has been estimated to be 17%. 
It is acknowledged that the current treatment approaches (e.g. hyperhydration and inhibitors of 
crystallization) may cause compliance problems, and/or a relevant reduction of quality of life and 
exposes patients to invasive procedures (gastrostomy and NG-tube placement). The treatment with 
pyridoxine also concerns only a minority of patients, and clean data on efficacy are not available. RRT 
and LTx (or LTx/KTx) are of course invasive procedures and reserved for those with end-stage disease. 
Pre-emptive transplantation exposes patients to a relevant operative risk and subsequent life-long 
immunosuppression. 
About the product 
Lumasiran is a double-stranded, small interfering RNA (siRNA) covalently linked to a triantennary N-
acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). Lumasiran uses the RNAi pathway to specifically target the 3’ 
untranslated region of HAO1 mRNA in the liver, thereby preventing the synthesis of the corresponding 
GO protein. Lumasiran is designed with the GalNAc moiety conjugated to the sense strand of the siRNA 
to enable selective delivery to the liver via uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). ASGPRs 
are expressed primarily and abundantly (0.5 to 1 million per cell) on the cell surface of hepatocytes 
and specifically bind to the glycoproteins with terminal galactose or GalNAc residues. 
Binding of the GalNAc ligand of lumasiran and ASGPR triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis of the 
ligand-receptor complex, resulting in release of the siRNA into the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte. ASGPR 
is subsequently recycled to the cell surface and is available for successive uptake of circulating GalNAc-
conjugated siRNA. The abundance of ASGPR expression on hepatocytes and the ability to mediate 
multiple rounds of uptake of GalNAc-conjugated siRNA into the hepatocytes makes this a high capacity 
system that is assumed to be non-saturable at exposures in the therapeutic range. ASGPR capacity is 
thought to be independent of age and hepatic function. 
Upon delivery to the liver, the double-stranded lumasiran siRNA is loaded into the cellular multiprotein 
enzyme cleavage complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytosol. Once 
loaded, the antisense strand (guide strand) of lumasiran binds to the complementary sequence in the 
HAO1 mRNA. Pairing of HAO1 mRNA with the antisense strand within the RISC/siRNA complex results 
in specific and highly efficient cleavage of the HAO1 mRNA, thereby preventing the synthesis of the 
corresponding GO protein, which in turn reduces – by reducing the target substrate of GO, glyoxylate – 
the production of oxalate in the liver. The underlying enzymatic defect (relating to AGT) is not targeted 
with the proposed treatment.

Lumasiran is the sodium salt of a chemically synthesised double-stranded oligonucleotide covalently 
linked to a ligand (referred to as L96) containing three N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues. The 
sense strand (A-131522) and the antisense strand (A-131532) contain 21 and 23 nucleotides, 
respectively.  
The molecular formula and molecular weight of lumasiran sodium are summarised in Table 2. 
Table 2: Active substance molecular formula and molecular weight 
The 3’-end of the sense strand is conjugated to the triantennary GalNAc moiety. The sense strand (A-
131522) contains two phosphorothioate linkages at the 5’ end. The antisense strand (A-131532) 
contains four phosphorothioate linkages - two at the 3’ end and two at the 5’ end. The 21 nucleotides 
of the sense strand hybridise with the complementary 21 nucleotides of the antisense strand, thus 
forming 21 nucleotide base pairs and a two-base overhang at the 3’-end of the antisense strand. The 
active substance structure is illustrated in Figure 2.

The active substance is a white to pale yellow powder.  It is hygroscopic in nature. It has solubility of 
NLT 387 mg/ml in water which is considered be “freely soluble”. 
The chemical structure of lumasiran sodium active substance was elucidated and characterised by a 
combination of orthogonal analytical techniques. Characterisation data are provided on lumasiran 
active substance and on the single strand (sense and antisense) intermediates. 
The structure elucidation data are acceptable to confirm the correct sequences of the single strand 
intermediates and the duplex structure of the lumasiran active substance.  
Lumasiran exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a number of chiral centres.  
All the pentose moieties of the nucleotides in the lumasiran active substance are in the naturally 
occurring D-ribose form. The chirality of the D-ribose is maintained during the synthesis of the 
modified conformation; RNA molecules adopt the classic A-form as demonstrated by the spectrum of 
Circular Dichroism. 
The phosphodiester (PO) linkages of double-stranded siRNAs require protection against cleavage by 
exonucleases. This is achieved by replacement of one of the non-bridging oxygen atoms in one or 
more PO linkages with sulfur. The resulting phosphorothioate group (PS) is chiral, with either Rp or Sp 
absolute configuration at the phosphorus atom. Thus, the solid-phase synthesis of PS modified 
oligonucleotides leads to a mixture of Rp/Sp isomers, which results in a population of diastereoisomers. 
The antisense strand contains four PS modifications, with two on the 5’end and two at the 3’end, 
resulting in the formation of sixteen (24=16) diastereomers. The sense strand contains two PS 
modification on the 5’end, corresponding to four (22=4) diastereomers.  
The applicant provided additional information on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of lumasiran. 
The 3D structure of the active substance as well as of the individual single strands is the result of the 
stereochemistry showed by the individual nucleic acid monomers, nucleosides and phosphoramidites as 
well as of the two chiral raw materials used in the synthesis and the reactions involved in the active 
substance synthesis. It has been demonstrated that overall the active substance synthesis produce 
consistently phosphorathioate diesters ratio.  
The circular dichroism spectra of lumasiran active substance indicates that exists in solution in an A-
form, as expected. The 3D structure of lumasiran active substance was also confirmed. Data shows 
consistency of the stereochemistry of the lumasiran active independently of the manufacturing site or 
scale of the synthesis, as expected from a solid-phase based synthesis. This consistency has also been 
demonstrated in both the sense and antisense strands produced with different scales. The information 
on the three-dimensional structure and stereochemistry of the active substance is considered 
adequate. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The lumasiran active substance is manufactured in seven main steps using well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
Step 1 to Step 5 consist of: the synthesis of the single-strand oligonucleotide by solid-phase 
phosphoramidite synthesis (Step 1), cleavage and deprotection (C&D) (Step 2), crude ultrafiltration 
(UF) (Step 3), purification by anion exchange chromatography (Step 4), and a final UF (Step 5).  
Each strand is individually purified and concentrated in Step 3 through Step 5. After the final UF, the 
two individual strands are annealed (Step 6) to form the duplex, which is then lyophilised and 
packaged in Step 7 to produce lumasiran sodium active substance.

Protected phosphoramidites are considered suitable starting materials for synthetic oligonucleotides. 
An appropriate justification for the classification of phosphoramidites as starting materials has been 
provided. Detailed information on the impurity profiles of the phosphoramidite starting materials has 
been provided. The proposed phosphoramidite specifications are acceptable. 
In summary, the selection of all starting materials has been carried out according to the principles of 
ICH Q11, i.e. they all have defined physical and chemical properties and structure; they are 
incorporated as a structural fragment into the structure of the lumasiran; they are purchased from 
commercial suppliers; and they are controlled with specifications to ensure lumasiran active substance 
quality. The selection of the starting materials is considered adequately justified taking into account 
also the manufacturing process which includes numerous cycles and purification steps, which ensure 
the proper purge of starting materials’ potential related and degradation impurities preventing their 
carry over to the single strand intermediates or even to the final lumasiran active substance. 
Impurities of starting materials have been identified and the proposed acceptance limits provided are 
considered acceptable. Suppliers of the starting materials are mentioned in the dossier. It has been 
confirmed that any addition of alternative suppliers for the starting materials will be made by the 
submission of a variation. 
A list of all reagents, solvents, and auxiliary materials used in the active substance manufacturing 
process, with relevant specifications, has been provided.  
A summary of the relevant quality attributes, their acceptance criteria, and location of controls for 
lumasiran active substance is provided. Process characterization activities to develop a control strategy 
for process performance qualification and commercial manufacturing have been sufficient described. 
Risk assessments were performed utilizing historical process understanding from the applicant’s 
manufacturing platform across multiple Alnylam products. Process parameter target set points, normal 
operating ranges (NOR) and proven acceptable ranges (PAR) were identified using design of 
experiments (DOE) and one factor at a time (OFAT) approaches. For individual unit operations, the 
desired outcomes from characterization studies were minimization of impurities and maximization of 
purity and yield.  
The critical process steps and associated critical process parameters (CPPs) for each unit operation and 
the non-critical process parameters of the manufacturing process are summarised, along with details 
of the criticality evaluation of process steps. The defined proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are 
acceptable and have been justified in the process development studies. The in-process tests performed 
at each step are described and the proposed limits are considered acceptable. In-process hold times 
have been sufficiently investigated. 
The quality of double-stranded oligonucleotides is pre-determined by the quality of the single strand 
precursors. Therefore, the control of these intermediates by adequate specifications is essential since 
some of the impurities can only be controlled at the level of the single strands.  
Identity by molecular weight and retention time, and more importantly, by sequencing is performed for 
the sense and antisense strand. Consequently, the sequence is proven also for the resulting duplex. 
Purity of the sense and the antisense strand is determined by two techniques, AX-HPLC and IPRP-
HPLC. The proposed tests on the single strands are acceptable. The specified impurities for the single 
strands are grouped based on their retention times and controlled within defined limits for each group. 
This is acceptable as it is commonly applied for synthetic oligonucleotide products.  
The single strand in-process control limits for sense and antisense strands are currently acceptable. 
The CHMP recommends (and applicant commits) to re-evaluate these limits post-approval when data 
from additional 10 commercial batches becomes available (REC1).

A three stage lifecycle approach is applied for process validation of the active substance manufacturing 
process. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Information on batch history has been provided in the dossier. All 
changes are described in detail and the influence on active substance quality has been in general 
sufficiently investigated and described.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
As per ICH Q3A guideline, impurities are classified into organic impurities, inorganic impurities and 
residual solvents. The organic impurities are further classified into process-related impurities and 
product-related impurities. 
Product-related oligonucleotide impurities are formed during the manufacturing process or during 
storage, including degradants. These impurities are controlled in the manufacturing process and at 
long term storage conditions by two orthogonal HPLC techniques (AX-HPLC and IPRP-HPLC) in the 
single strand intermediates and the final active substance. 
Typical impurities are deletion (shortmers) and addition (longmers) impurities, partially deprotected 
oligonucleotide chains that are not fully deprotected or improperly deprotected during manufacture, 
phosphodiester (P=O) impurities, where a phosphodiester replaces the thiophosphate (P=S) in the 
sense and antisense strands, impurities carried over from parent starting material impurities and in 
particular those associated with the triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) portion of the sense 
strand. 
In general, a good understanding of the impurity profile in the single strand intermediates and the final 
active substance has been demonstrated. Numerous impurities have been identified. Degradation 
pathways and the impact of annealing on degradation have been in general sufficiently investigated 
and discussed. Impurity monitoring is performed on impurities grouped by adjusted RRT ranges which 
is acceptable for synthetic oligonucleotides with an extremely complex impurity profile. The 
qualification of impurities has been sufficiently described. Process related organic impurities are low 
molecular weight organic impurities such as residual starting material, reagents and by-products from 
the manufacturing process. These impurities have been discussed and are considered removed due to 
extensive washing, chromatographic and ultrafiltration steps.  
There are genotoxic substances formed during the manufacture of both single strands. The evaluation 
of the presence of these genotoxic materials in the active substance is performed in accordance with 
the principles stipulated in the ICH M7 guideline. Residual solvents have been adequately addressed 
and batch analysis data have been provided. Inorganic impurities have been sufficiently addressed. 
The active substance is packaged in a gamma irradiated, high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with 
a polypropylene (PP) screw-top and a secondary foil laminate bag. The packaging materials complies 
with Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004, Regulation (EC) No. 2023/2006 (GMP) and EC Regulation (EC) 
No. 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity by duplex retention 
time (IPRP-HPLC-UV), identity by single strand MW (IPRP-HPLC ESI MS), identity by Tm 
(spectrophotometry), identity of single strands by sequence (MS-MS fragmentation), sodium content 
(flame AAS), purity (non-denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV), purity (denaturing AX-HPLC UV), purity 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020

(denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV), assay (UV absorption), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), elemental 
impurities (ICP-MS), acetonitrile (headspace GC-FID), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and bioburden 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The chosen specification attributes are appropriate. Three different purity methods are employed to 
control the purity of the duplex and impurities resulting from the single strands. The concept of 
grouping of impurities as proposed in the specification is acceptable. Identity of the single strands is 
determined by sequencing of the single strands as intermediates during the synthesis.  
The acceptance criteria in the active substance specification are acceptable. The CHMP recommends 
(and applicant commits) to re-evaluate the active substance acceptance criteria post-approval when 
data from additional 10 commercial batches becomes available (REC2). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from ten batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions (-20°C ± 5°C) and for 
up to six months under accelerated conditions (25°C ± 2°C / 60 ± 5%) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided.  
The quality attributes tested under the storage conditions were appearance, assay, water content, 
purity by non-denaturing IPRP HPLC, purity by denaturing AX HPLC and purity by denaturing IPRP 
HPLC. 
No negative trends have been observed at long term and accelerated conditions with the exception of 
two supportive batches where increased water content and results for total impurities above the 
specification limits have been observed at accelerated conditions. However, these supportive batches 
were by design manufactured with higher impurity levels. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed. The stress conditions studied were temperature, 
acid, base, oxidation and light. Similar degradation was observed. The stability-indicating properties of 
the three purity methods have been demonstrated. 
Based on the available data, a retest period for the active substance of 36 months when stored at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -20°C or below is acceptable.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 94.5 mg of lumasiran as the 
active substance. The product contains 100 mg/0.5 ml lumasiran sodium salt equivalent to 94.5 
mg/0.5 ml of lumasiran (i.e. 200 mg/ml lumasiran sodium equivalent to 189 mg/mL lumasiran).  
The finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, colorless to yellow solution intended for single use 
subcutaneous injection. It is supplied in a single-use Type I clear glass vial with a fluoropolymer-coated 
bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminum overseal with a flip-off button. Each vial contains 0.5 ml 
nominal volume of lumasiran solution (containing 94.5 mg of lumasiran). 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020

The finished product is a solution of the active substance in water for injection with a target pH of 7.0 
adjusted with sodium hydroxide or phosphoric acid in a vial. No further excipients are used. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
The pharmaceutical development followed a systematic approach whereby the formulation has been 
developed with respect to concentration to volume ratio, osmolality, viscosity (syringeability) and pH 
to accommodate subcutaneous application of the finished product. The quality target product profile 
(QTPP) was presented. The active substance quality attributes that may impact the finished product 
critical quality attributes were clearly identified. The formulation has been consistent throughout 
development from non-clinical through to the PPQ lots. 
The proposed fill volume has been sufficiently justified. The manufacturing process has also been 
systematically developed starting with clinical batches. Manufacturing process development followed a 
risk-based approach combined with process development studies. Critical and non-critical quality 
attributes are defined. The results form the basis for the overall control strategy. The manufacturing 
process parameters, associated targets, and NORs/PARs defined based on the development work have 
been defined in the dossier section P.3.3. 
The use of sterile filtration as the sterilization method for the finished product is justified with literature 
reference, i.e. that dry and steam heat have been demonstrated to impact the impurities profile of 
chemically modified RNA and that γ-irradiation has been shown to cause oxidative degradation in 
nucleotides. Furthermore, the applicant explains that temperatures required for thermal sterilisation 
exceed the melting temperature of siRNA duplex which would result in denaturation of the active 
substance. The applicant’s justification was accepted in line with the principles of the the EMA 
Guideline on the sterilisation of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary 
container (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015). 
As the product is proposed for use in children, the suitability of the formulation for use in children was 
addressed as part of the development, in accordance with the guideline on Pharmaceutical 
development of medicines for paediatric use (EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2). The information 
provided on injection volume, dosing accuracy and patient acceptability is considered acceptable from 
a quality point of view.   
The primary container closure system consists of a Type I clear glass vial with a gray bromobutyl 
rubber stopper containing a fluorinated polymer barrier film on the face/plug and a B2 silicone lubricity 
coating. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The suitability of the container 
closure system was evaluated with respect to protection, safety, and compatibility. Protection was 
demonstrated by container closure integrity testing. Furthermore, adsorption and delamination of the 
vials are not issues. Based on simulation test results a toxicological evaluation of the leachables from 
the container closure system has been presented. The used type I clear glass vial and the bromobutyl 
rubber stopper 4023/50 with fluoropolymer-coated contact surface are not considered to pose a safety 
risk. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product. 
Compatibility by in-use studies has been demonstrated for commercial 1 mL and 3 mL polycarbonate 
or polypropylene syringes and needles of bore sizes 21 G and 30 G. The respective syringe samples 
were stored at 25°C for 8 hours and at 2°C to 8°C for 48 hours. Purity testing by AX-HPLC UV and 
assay by UV spectrophotometry revealed no significant differences of the syringe samples to the 
control vials.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured and primary packaged at Vetter Pharma-Fertigung GmbH & Co. 
KG, Langenargen, Germany. The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: formulation, 
bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtration and aseptic filling. The process is considered to be a 
non-standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process is sufficiently described including process parameters with set-points, NORs 
and PARs as appropriate, as well as hold and processing times. The in-process controls (IPCs) are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Process validation 
data covers the proposed maximum batch size. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
To further guarantee microbiological safety of the finished product the applicant was requested to 
include requirements for microbial contamination and bacterial endotoxins in the specifications of all 
excipients. The applicant has adopted the requested change for water for injection specification and 
justified not including microbial testing for sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid. The justification is 
considered acceptable. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance 
(Ph. Eur.), identity by duplex retention time (IPRP-HPLC UV), identity by single strand molecular mass 
(IPRP-HPLC  MS),  purity  (IPRP-HPLC  UV,  non-denaturing),  assay  (UV  spectrophotometry),  purity  (AX-
HPLC  UV  denaturing),    purity  (IPRP-HPLC  UV,  denaturing),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  osmolality  (Ph.  Eur.), 
particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur), volume in container (Ph. 
Eur.) and container closure integrity (oxygen headspace). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. The analytical methods used have been adequately described 
and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding 
the reference standards used for and impurities testing has been presented. The reference standard 
used in the testing finished product is the same as that used for active substance. 
The proposed limits for impurities are acceptable. The CHMP recommends (and applicant commits) to 
re-evaluate and further tighten the finished product specification limits as applicable post-approval 
when data from additional 10 commercial batches are available (REC3).The potential presence of 
elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with 
the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Additional controls in the finished product specification 
are not necessary as the results are consistently below the control thresholds of 30% of the 
established PDEs. 
The applicant originally provided in the active substance documentation a brief statement that no risk 
of presence of N-nitrosamines impurities is considered in active substance or finished product. The 
arguments and justification provided were considered insufficient and resulted in a major objection to 
request a full risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities also in the finished  
product and applying the principles outlined in the notice “Information on nitrosamines for marketing 
authorisation holders (EMA/189634/2019)”. The applicant has submitted the requested risk 
assessment concerning nitrosamine impurities in both active substance and finished product concluding 
that no risk of the presence of N-nitrosamine impurities was identified in either. The response provided 
was considered acceptable and the major objection was resolved.

Batch analysis data are provided. All data meet the commercial acceptance criteria and demonstrate 
batch to batch consistency confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from ten batches of finished product stored for up to 48, 36 and 12 months respectively 
under long term conditions (2-8°C, 25°C/60%RH, 30°C/75%RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The finished 
product batches are representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Further results for supporting stability batches have been included, i.e. for two batches produced with 
exaggerated impurity profiles for use in nonclinical studies. An additional small-scale batch was used 
solely for thermal stress, cyclic stress and photostability studies. Results obtained during the 
assessment of thermal and cyclic stress also show resistance of the finished product to thermal 
degradation under the parameters studied (i.e., up to 14-days at 60°C and freeze-thaw cycling from -
20°C to 60°C with cumulative exposure periods of 12-days under each condition). Direct exposure of 
the finished product to an ICH Guideline Q1B 1x light exposure equivalent induced only minor change 
(<5%); further direct exposure to light (up to an 8x exposure equivalent), induced a concomitant 
decrease in purity as a function of increasing light exposure. 
The stability batches were tested in line with the shelf-life specifications The currently available 
stability results at long-term and at accelerated conditions show no obvious trends and are within 
specification limits, except for one batch stored at 40°C/75%RH where an out of specification (OOS) 
result for pH occurred. The test on pH gave results of 8.1 after 3 months, after 4 and 5 months the 
values found are both at pH 8.0. The specified limits for pH are 6.0-8.0. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and the storage conditions “Once 
the vial is opened, the medicinal product should be used immediately”, “Do not store above 30°C” and 
“Keep vial in the outer carton to protect from light” as presented in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
Post approval change management protocols 
Two post approval change management protocols (PACMP) are included to introduce an additional 
active substance manufacturer and an additional finished product manufacturer post approval. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. There is no risk of potential 
contamination with adventitious agents of viral or non-viral origin associated with the active substance 
or finished product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
A major objection raised requesting an updated risk assessment for possible nitrosamines impurities 
has been resolved (no risk for nitrosamines identified). Two post approval change management 
protocols (PACMP) are included to introduce an additional active substance manufacturer and an 
additional finished product manufacturer post approval. There are three quality recommendations to 
Assessment report

update single strand in-process control limits, active substance specifications and finished product 
specifications when further commercial batch data is available. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  To re-evaluate and tighten the single strand in-process control limits as applicable when data 
from additional 10 commercial batches are available. 
2.  To re-evaluate and tighten the active substance specification limits as applicable when data 
from additional 10 commercial batches are available. 
3.  To re-evaluate and tighten the finished product specification limits as applicable when data 
from additional 10 commercial batches are available. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of lumasiran were 
evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. According to the applicant, all pivotal 
studies were carried out in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
BIO15032: In Vitro Identification of HAO1-GalNAc Candidates in Support of Lead Selection 
for ALN-GO1 [Study BIO15032; non-GLP] 
Forty-nine candidate siRNAs targeting hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) were identified using custom 
bioinformatics tools complementary to the human HAO1 transcript as well as the ortholog mRNA 
sequences from cynomolgus monkey, mice, and rat. In vitro activity of these chemically modified 
siRNAs with triantennary GalNAc ligands conjugated to the 3' end of the sense strand was evaluated by

by transfection in primary Cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes (PCH) and determination of the extent of 
inhibition of HAO1 mRNA following transfection. 
In a second round, chemically modified analogues of 2 siRNAs identified in the first round were 
designed, synthesised and tested for inhibition of HAO1 mRNA. The chemical modifications introduced 
were expected to increase siRNA stability (and hence durability). The study resulted in identification of 
a siRNA (AD-65585) which was later termed lumasiran with an IC50 value for inhibition of HAO1 mRNA 
of 0.01 nM in primary monkey hepatocytes. 
In-vivo studies 
Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of ALN-65585 in Wild-Type Mice Following a Single 
Subcutaneous Injection [Study BIO15016; non-GLP] 
Lumasiran pharmacology was evaluated in female WT mice by quantifying liver HAO1 mRNA and 
serum glycolate levels. A single SC dose of lumasiran in female WT mice at doses between 0.1 and 10 
mg/kg bw resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of liver HAO1 mRNA with a dose of 10 mg/kg bw 
resulting in approximately 90% reduction (ED90on Day 10. The effective dose producing a 50% 
reduction (ED50) in HAO1 mRNA in the mouse was estimated to be 0.3 mg/kg bw. Serum glycolate 
levels increased in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum level approximately 4-fold above 
baseline levels at 3 mg/kg bw.  
Evaluation of ALN-65585 Duration in Wild-Type Mice Following a Single Subcutaneous 
Injection [Study BIO15022; non-GLP] 
A single dose of 3 mg/kg bw of lumasiran was administered SC to female WT mice. Animals were 
euthanised between Days 3 and 84, after which liver samples were obtained for evaluation of the 
duration of HAO1 reduction. A single SC dose of lumasiran in mice at 3 mg/kg bw resulted in ≥70% 
mRNA reduction for approximately 6 weeks, after which mRNA levels recovered towards baseline levels 
by 12 weeks post dose. 
Pharmacologic Evaluation of ALN-65585 in a Mouse Model of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type I 
Following a Single Subcutaneous Injection [Study BIO15028; non-GLP] 
Male alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase deficient mice (AGXT -/-) lacking liver AGXT mRNA and 
protein received a single SC dose of PBS or lumasiran. Urinary oxalate and glycolate levels showed

Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of ALN-65585 in Wild-Type Rats Following a Single 
Subcutaneous Injection [Study BIO15019; non-GLP] 
A single SC administration of PBS (control) or lumasiran at doses between 0.1, and 10 mg/kg bw to 
male WT Sprague Dawley rats resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of HAO1 mRNA (with doses ≥3 
mg/kg bw resulting in ED90 reduction. The ED50 for HAO1 in WT rats was estimated to be 0.3 mg/kg bw 
and the 0.1 mg/kg bw dose had minimal effect on HAO1 mRNA reduction. Serum glycolate levels 
increased in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum level approximately 8-fold above baseline 
after a single 10 mg/kg bw dose of lumasiran. 
Pharmacologic Evaluation of ALN-65585 in a Rat Model of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type I 
Following a Single Subcutaneous Injection [Study BIO15027; non-GLP] 
Sprague Dawley rats received weekly 1 mg/kg bw doses of AGXT siRNA in a lipid nanoparticle to 
decrease the levels of AGXT in the liver and mimic the genetic deficiency in patients with PH1. Liver 
HAO1 mRNA (obtained at sacrifice at Day 14) and 24-hour urinary oxalate were quantified to 
determine the degree of HAO1 reduction required for maximal oxalate reduction (Figure 4).

Pharmacologic Evaluation of ALN-65585 in a Rat Model of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type I 
Following Multiple Subcutaneous Injections [Study BIO15030; non-GLP] 
Male wild-type (Sprague Dawley) rats were injected on Day 0, 7, 14, and 21 IV with AGXT siRNA (AD-
63102) formulated in an AF-011 lipid nanoparticle and SC with lumasiran at doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 
mg/kg bw or PBS. 
Four weekly SC doses of lumasiran resulted in sustained urinary oxalate reductions in all dose groups. 
On Day 28, after repeat dosing of lumasiran, all groups showed ≥95% mRNA reduction and >85% 
urinary oxalate reduction.  
Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of AD-65585 Following Subcutaneous Injection of Male 
Cynomolgus Monkeys [Study BIO15029; non-GLP] 
Study animals received 6, once monthly doses of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Group 1), 8 once 
weekly (QW) doses of 0.25 or 1 mg/kg bw of lumasiran (Groups 2 and 3), 6 once monthly doses of 1, 
2, or 4 mg/kg bw of lumasiran (Groups 4, 5, and 6), or 4 once weekly doses of 2 mg/kg bw followed 
by 5 once monthly doses of 1 mg/kg bw of lumasiran (Group 7). 
HAO1 mRNA levels were quantified from liver biopsies. Glycolate levels were quantified in serum and 
urine, and oxalate levels were quantified in urine.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Mining of a public dbSNP database (Study BIO15020) demonstrated nearly 100% sequence 
conservation for the lumasiran target site in the overwhelming majority of humans whose HAO1 gene 
has been sequenced to date. 
In vitro analysis of mRNA reduction by lumasiran was conducted on the potential off-target transcripts 
identified from an in silico analysis comparing the sequence of only the antisense strand against the 
human transcriptome (Study BIO15033). Of the 14 transcripts with the greatest potential for off-target 
effects expression was not detected in Hep3B cells for three of these, consistent with the known lack of 
liver expression for these transcripts. Of the 11 transcripts that were expressed in these liver cells, no 
appreciable inhibition of 10 of these target genes was observed after transfection of lumasiran at 
concentrations up to 10 nM. The one potential off-target gene dimethylglycine dehydrogenase 
(DMGDH, NR104002) that did show modest inhibition at the highest concentration of lumasiran in 
these cells was then directly compared for potency to HAO1 inhibition in transfected COS-7 cells, a cell 
line that abundantly expresses both HAO1 and DMGDH. The results suggest there is a >1000-fold 
difference between the on-target reduction of HAO1 by lumasiran and the off-target reduction of any of 
the predicted off-target transcripts.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
Telemeterised male Cynomolgus monkeys were given SC injections of the control, 10 or 100 mg/kg bw 
of lumasiran on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in a parallel-dosing design GO1-GLP15-014.  
All animals survived until study termination and were returned to the stock colony on Day 25 of the 
dosing phase. No abnormal clinical observations were attributed to administration of lumasiran. At 
doses of 10 or 100 mg/kg bw, lumasiran had no effect on qualitative ECG findings, quantitative ECG or 
hemodynamic parameters, respiration rate, or body temperature following repeat dosing and the NOEL 
was ≥100 mg/kg bw, the highest dose tested.  
An in vitro human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay was not conducted based on the 
molecular size (approximately 16 kDa), physical chemical properties of lumasiran and negligible

distribution to the heart. This was confirmed with another GalNAc-conjugated RNAi duplex of similar 
size and structure to lumasiran. targeting a mRNA sequence unrelated to HAO1 (data not shown).  
Central nervous system 
CNS safety was investigated as part of repeated dose general toxicity studies GO1-GLP15-009 (8-
week) and GO1-GLP15-036 (36 weeks) in Cynomolgus monkeys. No lumasiran-associated neurological 
observations were noted up to the highest investigated doses of 100 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw in 
the 8- and 36-week repeat-dose GLP toxicity studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated studies to evaluate pharmacodynamic drug interactions were submitted as the potential 
for pharmacodynamic drug interactions with lumasiran in humans is expected to be low given that 
there are no other HAO1 suppressive agents or other agents that affect HAO1 production. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Absorption was investigated as non-GLP studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and in GLP-compliant 
toxicokinetic studies in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys (described in the toxicology section of this 
report). 
Non GLP-compliant studies in rats and monkeys. 
Study GO1-DSM15-022 
Plasma lumasiran levels were determined after single intravenous and subcutaneous and after multiple 
(once weekly for 8 weeks or once monthly for 3 month) subcutaneous administration in male and 
female rats by the LC-TOF-MS method.  
Following a single lumasiran dose of 5 mg/kg IV bolus administration in rats, the mean Cmax was 25.0 
μg/mL with a mean area under the concentration versus time curve from the time of dosing to the last 
measurable concentration (AUClast) value of 7.95 h*μg/mL. Elimination was rapid with an estimated t1/2 
of 0.4 hours. The mean total clearance (CL) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) values 
were 646 mL/h/kg and 332 mL/kg, respectively. The applicant comments that, this indicates a 
moderate distribution of lumasiran beyond the vasculature. For doses 1 to 10 mg/kg, plasma exposure 
of lumasiran (Cmax and AUC) increased approximately dose proportionally over the dose range 
evaluated. The apparent plasma t1/2 was consistent across subcutaneous doses (1.0 hour). 
Multiple-once weekly subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg for a total of 8 doses and 3 once-
monthly doses of 4 mg/kg were also investigated. There was no accumulation following once weekly or 
once monthly dosing and repeat-dose pharmacokinetics showed no time dependence. Mean plasma 
exposure and apparent t½ values for both schedules were similar to those observed after a single 
subcutaneous dose.

Study GO1-DSM15-020 
Plasma lumasiran levels were determined after single intravenous and subcutaneous and after multiple 
(once weekly for 8 weeks or once monthly for 3 month) subcutaneous administration in male and 
female cynomolgus monkeys by the LC-TOF-MS method.  
Following a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg, the mean Cmax was 134 μg/mL with a mean AUClast value of 
58.9 h*μg/mL. Elimination from systemic circulation was rapid with an estimated t½ of 0.6 hours. The 
mean CL and Vss values were 189 mL/h/kg and 163 mL/kg, respectively, suggesting moderate 
distribution of lumasiran beyond the vasculature.  
Following a single subcutaneous dose of lumasiran at 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg in monkeys, plasma tmax 
was achieved at approximately 2 hours. Plasma Cmax and AUClast values increased in an approximately 
dose-proportional manner across the dose range evaluated, with similar t1/2 values (approximately 3.5 
hours) across doses; an exception was the 1 mg/kg dose group where females showed an extended 
half-life (12 hours) due to 2 animals in the group with significant plasma levels noted at later time 
points. Plasma concentrations in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group were sparse with 2 animals having no 
detectable lumasiran at any time point. The remaining 4 animals had detectable lumasiran 
concentrations in only 1 to 3 time points creating a profile that is less robust than the 1, 5 or 10 mg/kg 
dose groups.  
Plasma concentrations of lumasiran were measured after multiple subcutaneous doses of 1 mg/kg 
(total of 8 once weekly doses) and 4 mg/kg (total of 3 once monthly doses). Overall, the dose 
normalised plasma pharmacokinetic profiles were similar in monkeys following single and multiple 
dosing indicating no time-dependent changes in the pharmacokinetic of lumasiran. Males had slightly 
higher AUClast and t½ values (<2-fold) after weekly dosing vs females; exposure and half-life values 
were equivalent between males and females after monthly dosing. There was minimal accumulation in 
plasma after multiple dosing. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of lumasiran in mouse, rat, monkey, and human plasma was measured using 
an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Study DSM19-021). The results are shown in Table

Distribution in rats by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (GO1-DSM18-038) 
10 mg/kg [14C] labeled lumasiran was administered subcutaneously to male non-pigmented (SD) rats 
and distribution and pharmacokinetic parameters in the different tissues were investigated by 
quantitative whole-body autoradiography. 
The greatest exposure was observed for the dose site, followed by the liver and the kidney. 
Substantially lower concentrations of lumasiran were observed in almost every other tissue, including 
adrenal, heart, lung, spleen, thyroid, thymus, pancreas, small intestine, and testes. Central nervous 
system tissues had negligible exposure to radioactivity after SC administration of [14C]-lumasiran. 
Distribution in monkeys 
The distribution of lumasiran in monkey liver was evaluated after a single, or multiple once weekly or 
once monthly doses of lumasiran by subcutaneous administration (GO1 DSM15-020).

Metabolism 
In Vitro Metabolic Stability of Lumasiran in Serum and Liver S9 Fraction (Study BA15014) 
The stability of lumasiran was evaluated in pooled serum of mouse, rats monkey and human with and 
without human liver S9-fractions.  
No significant degradation (< 10% degradation) of lumasiran occurred in plasma of the species 
evaluated. In liver S9 fraction the anti- sense strand was stable to a similar degree, whereas the sense 
strand showed a slightly lower stability with a degradation from approximately 15 to 20 %.  
Metabolite Profiling of Lumasiran 
The metabolic patterns of lumasiran´s antisense and sense strands were investigated in samples from 
in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies (BA15014). In vitro metabolite profiles were generated after 
incubating lumasiran with plasma and liver S9 fractions from mouse, rat, monkey, and human. 
Plasma and liver samples were taken from pharmacokinetic studies in rats (GO1-DSM15-022), and 
monkeys (GO1-DSM15-020). Both species were dosed with 10 mg/kg lumasiran subcutaneously. 
Human plasma and urine samples were taken from the Phase 1 clinical study (ALN-GO1-001). 
Metabolism of the Antisense Strand 
The antisense strand of lumasiran was primarily metabolised to form the metabolite AS(N-1)3ʹ 
lumasiran. There were a total of 12 antisense strand metabolites identified in vivo across species that 
formed from sequential exonuclease activity on the 5ʹ and 3ʹ ends of the strand.  
The metabolite profiles of rat and monkey were comparable to the profiles obtained in vitro samples. 
The antisense strand was metabolised to a low extent to AS(N-1)3ʹ lumasiran. The plasma AUC of the 
metabolite was smaller than or equal to 10% of the full length antisense strand exposure in either the 
rat or monkey. 
In monkey liver, there was also a deaminated antisense strand metabolite (deaminated lumasiran) 
resulting in terminal adenosine to inosine conversion at the 3′ end. This was not detected as a 
circulating metabolite in rat or monkey and was not detected in liver S9 for any species. Both 
metabolites are not major circulating plasma components. 
In pooled human plasma and urine samples (taken from clinical study ALN-GO1-001) the antisense of 
lumasiran was equally metabolised to AS(N-1)3′ lumasiran and the exposure was smaller than 10% of 
full-length parent compound. 
Metabolism of Sense Strand 
In vitro and in vivo metabolite profiling in rat and monkey serum and plasma (BA15014) demonstrated 
that the sense strand of lumasiran was minimally metabolised and was stable due to the GalNAc group 
from the triantennary ligand at the 3ʹ-end, which protected the sense strand from the 3ʹ-end 
exonuclease metabolism until the loss of the sugar moieties.  
In vivo metabolite profiling of human pooled plasma and urine samples (BA15014) sampled for 24 
hours following a single 6 mg/kg subcutaneous administration of lumasiran demonstrated that the 
sense strand was minimally metabolised with the loss of one GalNAc. 
In Vitro Hepatocyte Metabolism 
Since a deaminated lumasiran was identified in monkey liver samples an in vitro human hepatocyte 
model (HepatoPac®) was used to determine if deaminated lumasiran is likely to be formed in human 
Assessment report

liver (Study G01-DSM19-022). The potential for age-dependent differences in ADME properties of 
lumasiran was also investigated using hepatocytes from 8 donors (aged 1 month to 48 years). 
The cells were preloaded for 24 hours with media spiked with lumasiran at 10 μg/mL.  
In this model, the metabolite AS(N-1)3' lumasiran was present at levels less than lumasiran whereas 
deaminated lumasiran was present at higher levels than parent after a 168-hour incubation period, 
suggesting that humans have the ability to form deaminated lumasiran. No correlation with ASGR level 
or function observed with age 
In Vitro CYP Inhibition 
In pooled human liver microsomes, lumasiran did not directly inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 at concentrations ranging from 0.6 nM to 614 μM (Study 319N-
1506A). Lumasiran showed inhibition of CYP2C8 with a calculated IC50 value of 461 μM, which is 
approximately 14000-fold above expected pharmacologic concentrations. Time-dependent inhibitory 
potential was also evaluated by preincubating liver microsomes with varying concentrations of 
lumasiran in the presence and in the absence of cofactor, NADPH. Lumasiran did not demonstrate any 
time-dependent inhibition towards any of the CYP isoforms evaluated.  
In Vitro CYP Phenotyping 
Lumasiran was incubated with individual recombinant cytochrome P450 (rCYP) enzymes rCYP1A2, 
rCYP2B6, rCYP2C8, rCYP2C9, rCYP2C19, rCYP2D6, rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5 to determine if CYPs 
contribute to the metabolism of lumasiran (Study 319N-1506B).  
The percentage of lumasiran remaining after 45 minutes was approximately 100% for all rCYPs tested 
in the presence of NADPH.  
In Vitro CYP Induction 
Lumasiran was not tested as an inducer of CYP enzymes in vitro. The applicant referred to published in 
vitro DDI data for siRNA GalNAc conjugate molecules that share similar physicochemical properties 
with lumasiran have been evaluated in vitro and were not inducers of major CYPs (Ramsden et al. 
2019). 
Excretion 
Renal excretion of lumasiran was evaluated in rats following a single subcutaneous dose of 5 mg/kg 
(Study GO1-DSM15-022). Renal clearance was 29 mL/h/kg in males and 17 mL/h/kg in females and 
accounted for <1% of the total systemic clearance, with the majority of clearance from circulation 
resulting from liver uptake. Only minimal amounts of total test article administered in rats were 
recovered in feces with most samples having no detectable lumasiran. 
The excretion of radiolabeled lumasiran was investigated after administration of a single subcutaneous 
dose (10 mg/kg) of [14C]-lumasiran to male intact and bile duct cannulated animals (Study GO1-
DSM18-038, Table 6).

Lumasiran concentrations in seminal fluid were evaluated in male NZW rabbit after single 
subcutaneous administration of 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. Samples were collected 8, 24, 72, and 216 
hours post dose. 
Very low levels of lumasiran were detected at all time points post-dose in both dose groups, with Cmax 
occurring at 8 hours post-dose. These values were less than 1% of the plasma Cmax when compared 
with plasma toxicokinetic levels observed in pregnant female rabbits that also received doses of 3 and 
30 mg/kg. 
GO1-DSM19-002 
The excretion of radiolabeled lumasiran were investigated after administration of a single subcutaneous 
dose (10 mg/kg) of [14C]-lumasiran to male monkeys.  
The mean cumulative recovery over 90 days was relatively low with 54.6%±8.12%. Approximately 
38% of the dose could be found in the urine, 8% in the feces, and 9% in the cage residue. Detectable 
levels of radioactivity were measured in the excreta of each animal daily through Day 90 but 
diminished appreciably after Day 2. The largest amount (~30%) was recovered in the first 24 hours.  
Measurable levels of radioactivity were observed in the kidney, and to a higher degree in the liver. The 
highest levels of radioactivity in the kidney and liver were measured at 24 hours post dose, with 
estimates of 0.33% and 54.7% of the total radioactive dose, respectively. The amount of the 
radioactive dose remaining in kidneys at 90 days post dose was minimal and consistent at ~0.04%. 
Radioactivity was still measurable at 90 days post dose in the liver, ranging from ~0.9% to 7.4%. 
Though the carcasses were not analyzed as part of this study, the excretion profile supports the 
likelihood that the remaining unrecovered radioactive dose was not retained in the carcass. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
A standard single-dose toxicity study with lumasiran was not submitted. 
Clinical observations were made following a single dose in the GLP in vivo rat erythrocyte micronucleus 
study (GO1-GLP15-016). In this study, rats were monitored for up to 48 hours after SC administration 
of a single dose of lumasiran. There were no deaths or adverse clinical signs observed. Lumasiran was 
well tolerated at up to 2000 mg/kg (the limit dose in this study).

Placental transfer 
Concomitantly with the studies on embryo-fetal development in rats and rabbits, placental, fetal liver 
and fetal tissue lumasiran concentrations were measured. Lumasiran was not detected in fetal tissue 
and liver samples. No lumasiran was detected in placentae of the low dose group and only in low 
concentrations in the higher dose groups of both species. 
Milk excretion 
No specific study to investigate the excretion of lumasiran into the milk of lactating animals was 
submitted. However, concomitant with the study on pre-postnatal development in rats lumasiran 
plasma concentrations were measured in suckling pups of lumasiran treated dams. Lumasiran plasma 
levels were found to be below the level of quantification indicating that lumasiran concentrations in 
milk are too low to show up in plasma of suckling pups. 
Juvenile toxicity 
In a pilot juvenile and toxicity study performed in rats from PND4 to PND33, injection site reactions, 
decreases in fibrinogen and microscopic findings in the kidneys were the main observations after 
weekly SC injections of lumasiran (GO1-GLP15-043). Similar effects were also observed in the 8-week 
repeat-dose study in rats, which were 4-5 weeks of age at start of treatment (GO1-GLP15-008). 
However, liver (increases in liver enzymes, hepatic necrosis) as well as kidney findings (microscopic 
changes) were much more pronounced in the older rats of the 8-week study although doses were in 
general lower. This was probably due to higher cumulative doses resulting from altogether 9 weekly 
doses in the older compared to 5 weekly doses in neonate/juvenile rats.

Plasma toxicokinetics showed no sex differences in exposure to lumasiran and no accumulation in the 
plasma of treated juvenile animals. Like in adult animals, liver exposure was much higher than kidney 
exposure. Increases in glycolate levels and decreases in HAO1 mRNA showed pharmacologic activity of 
lumasiran on PND32 after QW lumasiran treatment from PND 4 onwards in all dose groups. Concerning 
age and comparison to humans, a rat at PND 32 equals approximately a 6-8 year old child. Altogether, 
due to kidney findings, the NOAEL of the pilot juvenile toxicity study is at 30 mg/kg/week with 
exposure multiples of approximately 2 compared to human therapeutic exposures (based on monthly 
levels). 
Toxicokinetic data

c  HED was calculated using the nonclinical dose and dividing by the appropriate species allometric 
conversion factor (6.2 for rat and 3.1 for monkey) as outlined in the Guidance for Industry: 
Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult 
Healthy Volunteers (FDA, July 2005). 
Local tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies with lumasiran were submitted.  
The potential of dermal irritation at the SC injection sites and microscopic evaluation of the injection 
site tissue was investigated in all repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
In the repeat-dose GLP toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, transient, very slight erythema and 
transient, very slight to slight oedema were observed with once weekly SC administration of lumasiran. 
Dermal observations following once monthly SC administration to rats for 25 weeks appeared rather 
infrequently, were also present in control animals, and did not always correlate with the location of the 
SC injection; therefore, they were not considered adverse or lumasiran related. 
In the 36-week monkey study (GO1-GLP15-036), no lumasiran-related dermal irritation was observed. 
Microscopic findings at the injection site, cellular infiltrates, and/or inflammation were present in both 
rats and monkeys at all dose levels; increased incidence and severity of subcutis muscle degeneration 
(minimal to moderate) was seen in rats.

Other toxicity studies 
A non-GLP-compliant study (GO1-DSM16-048) was performed to investigate the effects of chronic 
renal impairment (via the 5/6-nephrectomised rat model) on PK, PD, and toxicity in male Sprague 
Dawley rats after a single SC dose of lumasiran. 
A single administration of 1 or 3 mg/kg lumasiran was not associated with any lumasiran-related 
effects on serum chemistry, body weights, organ weights, or macroscopic and microscopic findings in 
the liver and kidney in either sham surgery or nephrectomised animals. Nephrectomy did not 
substantially affect the extent of rat liver HAO1 mRNA reduction after a single 1-mg/kg SC injection of 
lumasiran. Renal impairment does not result in plasma exposure differences after administration of a 
single dose of lumasiran. Kidney concentrations were lower on Day 2 in nephrectomised rats compared 
with sham surgery animals. Comparing Day 2 with Day 14, these data suggest increased and 
prolonged lumasiran kidney concentrations and prolonged kidney residence in nephrectomised animals 
dosed with lumasiran compared with sham-operated animals. 
Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) was evaluated in rat and monkey plasma following weekly administration of 
lumasiran for 25 and 36 weeks, respectively. A low incidence, 3 out of 36 treated monkeys in the 36-
week repeat-dose toxicity study (GO1-GLP15-036) were confirmed to have a low titre of anti-lumasiran 
antibodies. Plasma exposure of lumasiran was not impacted and there were no toxicological findings 
attributed to the presence of ADAs in these animals. No ADAs were detected in treated rats. 
The impurity profiles of the drug substance batches used in the nonclinical toxicology studies were 
comparable to the impurity profiles of the material used in clinical investigations and that proposed for 
use in the marketed product. Additionally, a 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats (GO1-GLP19-
002) was conducted to generate toxicology data with lumasiran drug substance that contained 
potential commercial scale manufacture impurities that were not identified in previous toxicology lots. 
Toxicologic findings were injection site reactions, decreased body weight gain, changes in serum liver 
parameters, serum lipids, coagulation and haematology. These changes were similar to the findings 
made in the rat repeated-dose studies and do not identify new target organs of toxicity. The 
histological alterations observed in liver and kidney were also similar to the findings in the repeated-
dose studies. Thus, there is no hint that the commercial scale impurities cause toxicity beyond the 
effects of the active substance lumasiran.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of lumasiran were evaluated in a series of in vitro 
and in vivo non-clinical studies. Overall, the study program appears to be appropriate and complete. 
Pharmacology of lumasiran was demonstrated in WT mice, rats and monkeys and in an induced rat PH1 
model. 
In all animal models, single or repeat weekly or monthly subcutaneous administration of lumasiran 
primarily resulted in dose-dependent reductions of HAO1 mRNA, increases in serum glycolate levels 
and/or reductions in urinary oxalate.   
In WT mice, rats and monkeys, as the percent of HAO1 mRNA decreased, serum glycolate levels 
increased but in a nonlinear manner, such that substantial glycolate increases were not seen until 
approximately 70% to 80% reduction of HAO1 mRNA. These results are consistent with the expected 
enzymology of glycolate oxidase in WT animals, where enzyme levels should not be rate limiting in the 
conversion of substrate (glycolate) until they reach low levels.  
In the PH1-induced rat model, as the percent of HAO1 mRNA decreased, the amount of urinary oxalate 
decreased in a linear manner (HAO1 mRNA reduction to oxalate lowering) even at low levels of mRNA 
silencing. This is consistent with the expected enzymology of glycolate oxidase, where enzyme levels 
should be rate limiting in product (oxalate) formation at all levels. 
The applicant conducted a GLP-compliant cardiovascular safety study with determination of the 
respiration rate in telemetered conscious male Cynomolgus monkeys. No immediate or delayed effects 
on clinical observations, qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters, hemodynamic parameters, 
respiration rate, or body temperature were seen in this study and the NOEL was ≥100 mg/kg bw, the 
highest dose tested. The safety factor of about 20 between Cmax at the maximum recommended dose 
in humans and the exposure in this safety pharmacology study is considered acceptable. 
CNS safety was investigated as part of repeated dose general toxicity studies GO1-GLP15-009 and 
GO1-GLP15-036 in Cynomolgus monkeys. No lumasiran-associated neurological observations were 
noted but there is presently some discrepancy between the NOEL stated by the applicant and the 
dosing levels of the studies. 
Mining of a public dbSNP database revealed a low frequency of SNPs which strongly suggests that 
lumasiran would be efficacious in reducing HAO1 in people of all ethnic and geographical backgrounds. 
In vitro analysis of mRNA reduction by lumasiran was conducted on the potential off-target transcripts 
identified from an in silico analysis comparing the sequence of only the antisense strand against the 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 43/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
human transcriptome. The results suggest there is a >1000-fold difference between the on-target 
reduction of HAO1 by lumasiran and the off-target reduction of any of the predicted off-target 
transcripts, confirming the specificity of lumasiran for HAO1.  
Plasma PK profiles were characterized following multiple SC dosing regimens of lumasiran (8 weekly 
doses of 1 mg/kg and 3 monthly doses of 4 mg/kg in rats and monkeys). In both species, the multiple-
dose plasma PK data were consistent with single-dose plasma PK data. Due to the short half-life of 
lumasiran compared with dosing frequency, there was no accumulation in rat and minimal 
accumulation in monkey plasma following repeat once weekly or once monthly dosing at the PK doses 
tested. Overall, these PK properties of lumasiran in rats and monkeys indicate no time- or dose-
dependency following multiple SC doses. The TK properties of lumasiran were evaluated in mice, rats, 
rabbits, and monkeys to support the toxicological assessment. In general, there was little to no 
accumulation, no consistent sex related TK differences and the plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) 
increased either dose proportionally, or in some cases, increased slightly greater than dose 
proportionally across the dose range tested. 
The applicant also conducted a single-dose study in 5/6 nephrectomised rats to mimic the situation in 
patients suffering from renal insufficiency due to the underlying disease. No relevant differences to 
healthy animals were detected in respect to the PK, PD and toxicity parameters tested.  
Submitted studies show the preferred uptake of lumasiran into the target organ after subcutaneous 
administration. Several studies showed a good correlation between lumasiran administration and an 
increase in plasmatic glycolate concentration, the expected effect in healthy animals. The metabolism 
of lumasiran was primarily due to nucleoside cleavage by exo- or endonucleases. Investigations on DDI 
were limited to studies on inhibition. Further studies on DDI were not considered necessary with 
respect to the publication of Ramsden et al. 2019. Overall, the animal species involved in the non-
clinical study program are adequate from the perspective of pharmacokinetics. 
Consistent toxicology findings in the repeat-dose studies were histological changes in the liver. In the 
rat, these consisted of intracellular vacuoles in periportal cells containing lipid-like material as well as 
basophilic granules in Kupffer cells. Hepatocyte hypertrophy, mitosis and necrosis were also observed. 
Severity of the changes increased with increasing dose; effects were already seen at the lowest dose 
tested. The findings were partially reversible. These histological changes were accompanied by 
changes in serum liver parameters such as increased AST, ALP and GGT. Furthermore, there was 
consistent decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels, sometimes together with prolonged prothrombin time, 
and increase in serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). Lipid vacuoles in periportal cells, cell 
necrosis and regeneration (mitosis) indicate cytotoxicity. Cytotoxic effects could also be responsible for 
the observed decrease in fibrinogen since a known mechanism via activation of PPARα was ruled out.  
In monkeys, basophilic granules were observed in the Kupffer cells of the liver, and an increase in 
serum ALP. No other histological liver changes or serum chemistry alterations were observed in 
monkeys. 
According to the data presented, the lumasiran level in the liver is similar in rats and monkeys. The 
reason for this apparent difference in toxicity between species remains unclear. 
Mechanistic studies in the published literature have investigated lumasiran among other experimental 
siRNAs in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the described hepatic effects (Janas et al.2018) 
and several possible mechanisms of toxicity to hepatocytes have been postulated. These include 
binding to cellular proteins as e.g. observed with oligonucleotides containing a high amount of 
phosphorothioate linkages, disturbance of endogenous processes of RNAi involving microRNAs or off-
target knock-down of genes other than the desired one (HAO1 in the present case). As the underlying 
mechanism however is still unknown, these observations are described in the pre-clinical safety section 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 44/112 
 
 
 
of the SmPC which also states that the reason for the apparent rodent-specificity is not understood and 
the relevance for humans is unclear. In addition, hepatic effects have been included in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. Further information on the effect of lumasiran on the liver in humans will be 
collected through the ongoing trials but also though the planned long-term real-world safety study in 
patients with PH1.   
In the rat, kidney changes were also observed, consisting of basophilic granules in the tubular cells. In 
monkeys, vacuolated macrophages were observed in lymph nodes already at the lowest dose.  
Lumasiran is designed in such a way that it is selectively taken up through the binding of GalNAc by 
the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on the surface of liver cells, after which it becomes 
internalised. At higher doses, this uptake mechanism becomes saturated so that lumasiran then 
becomes excreted via kidney, leading to increasing tissue concentrations in this organ. Basophilic 
granules were observed in Kupffer cells in rats and monkeys and in renal tubular cells of rats. It is 
conceivable that the basophilic material represents lumasiran or some degradation products of it. 
Kupffer cells resemble macrophages and could therefore be involved in scavenging lumasiran.  
In the study of Janas et al. 2018, the basophilic granules in Kupffer and tubular kidney cells were also 
addressed as well as the finding of vacuolated macrophages in certain lymph nodes. The authors 
performed immunohistochemistry staining using an antibody directed against a common part of 
therapeutic siRNA like lumasiran. The results indicate that the basophilic granules in liver and Kidney 
as well as the vacuoles in the macrophages contain siRNA-related material. 
Lumasiran did not show any adverse effects on male and female fertility and pre- and post-natal 
development in rats. In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, skeletal abnormalities 
were observed, but at high exposure multiples relative to human therapeutic exposures. The NOAELs 
were approximately 20 to 70 times higher (based on monthly exposures). Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. The use of this medicinal 
product could be considered during pregnancy taking into account the expected health benefit for the 
woman and potential risks to the foetus. 
In pre- and postnatal development in rats lumasiran plasma concentrations were measured in suckling 
pups of lumasiran treated dams. Lumasiran plasma levels were found to be below the level of 
quantification. It is unknown whether lumasiran is excreted in human milk. 
A dose range finding toxicity study in neonate rats did not show increased sensitivity of the developing 
rat to either the toxicology or pharmacology of lumasiran at exposure multiples of 2 compared to 
human therapeutic exposures (based on monthly exposures). 
Lumasiran is not mutagenic or clastogenic and is not considered to have an immunostimulatory or 
immunotoxicity potential.  There were no findings in these studies or in any published studies 
investigating the suppression of GO that raise a pharmacologically based cause for concern regarding 
carcinogenic potential. However, it is recommended that the applicant further investigates the 
carcinogenic potential of lumasiran following the authorisation of the product. 
The applicant conducted a repeated-dose study in rats with a drug substance batch containing 
commercial scale impurities which were not present in the batches used for the other toxicology 
studies. The findings in this study were in line with the findings of the other repeated-dose rat studies.  
Lumasiran PEC-surface water value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Lumasiran is therefore not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No absolute bioavailability and human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies have been performed for lumasiran because of the long tissue half-life in liver and the 
consequent health hazard from prolonged exposure to radioactivity in healthy subjects. 
The PK of lumasiran has been evaluated in 4 submitted clinical studies (001, 002, 003 and 004). 
Preliminary data on PK of lumasiran from study 005 in 4 patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis 
were additionally submitted. 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis for plasma lumasiran concentrations was performed with data 
from a total of 99 subjects, 24 healthy adult volunteers (24.2%) and 75 PH1 patients (75.8%) from 
Studies 001, 002, 003, and 004. Model development revealed that lumasiran PK was best described by 
a 2-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption process from the SC injection site into

systemic circulation. Total plasma clearance was a sum of two elimination pathways: hepatic uptake 
clearance and renal clearance. The covariate effect of body weight on PK parameters was incorporated 
using fixed physiologically based allometric exponents. Renal clearance for lumasiran was fixed to the 
patient’s baseline renal function. Random effects were added to parameters hepatic clearance and 
absorption rate constant (Ka) to describe inter-individual variabilities. Inter-occasion variability was 
added on Ka to explain random PK differences observed over multiple occasions of PK sampling within 
a subject. Estimation of PK parameters was precise, goodness-of-fit plots did not reveal any model-
misspecification and the VPC showed that concentrations were adequately predicted. 
Absorption  
Absolute bioavailability of lumasiran following subcutaneous (SC) administration has not been 
determined in humans. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles of lumasiran in healthy volunteers 
after the administration of a single SC dose and in PH1 patients after initial and multiple administration 
of different doses in study 001B are presented in Figure 7, showing transient plasma exposures.

• 
Influence of food 
No studies were conducted to evaluate drug-food interactions because lumasiran is administered 
subcutaneously. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding was moderate to high (77 to 85%) at clinically relevant concentrations in 
plasma from adult healthy donors. 
No specific human distribution studies were conducted. Distribution was thus informed based on non-
clinical data (See Non-clinical section of this report).  
The lumasiran volume of distribution estimate following IV dosing in cynomolgus monkeys from 
nonclinical study GO1-DSM15-020 was used to determine the body weight based central volume of 
distribution (V2) for model building in the population PK analysis. The same relationship between 
volume of distribution and body weight was assumed in man. For a typical 70 kg adult, this yielded a 
population estimate for the apparent central volume of distribution (Vd/F) of 4.9 L (0.07 L/kg*body 
weight) for lumasiran.  
Elimination 
Lumasiran in plasma was below the Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLoQ) within 24 to 48 hours in most 
patients with PH1 (study 001B) (Figure 7). 
Following a single oral SC dose of lumasiran, elimination half –life in plasma was evaluable in only five 
adult healthy subjects where it ranged from 3.47 to 7.33 hours with a mean (%CV) of 5.91 (28.2%) 
hours (study 001A). Apparent total clearance (CL/F) in these subjects ranged from 23.1 to 44.1 L/h 
with a mean (%CV) of 30.7 (26.3%) L/h. 
In paediatric and adult patients with PH1 (≥6 years), half-life was more variable and ranged from 2.08 
to 10.9 hours with a mean (%CV) of 5.16 (55.5%) hours in study 001B (n=9) and similarly from 1.42 
to 10.3 hours with a mean of 4.89 (51.1%) hours in paediatric PH1 patients (<6 years) in study 004 
(n=11).  CL/F ranged lower from 10.9 to 34.1 L/h with a mean (CV%) of 20.9 (36.6%) L/h in study 
001B (and from 5.63 to 10.2 L/h with a mean (CV%) of 8.35 (19.9%) L/h in study 004.  
In the combined analysis of adult healthy subjects and paediatric and adult PH1 patients across 
studies, mean half-life (CV%) following a single SC dose of lumasiran was estimated 5.19 (47.0%) 
hours (n=57). And mean CL/F (CV%) was estimated as 17.3 L/h (60.7%). 
Comparable to these observed values, model-estimated t1/2 ranged from 3.7 to 8.8 hours and CL/F 
ranged from 4.6 to 32.4 L/h across body weight groups in the population PK analysis.

Based on non-clinical studies, the majority of lumasiran is taken up by the liver, the target organ of 
effect. PK/PD modelling predicted a lumasiran terminal half-life in human liver to be 66.9 days.  
• 
Excretion 
In humans, excretion of lumasiran into the bile and faeces was not determined. 
A mean of 17.4 to 25.8% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged lumasiran 
in healthy subjects over 24 hours (study 001A) (Table 16). 
Compared to healthy subjects, the mean fraction of administered lumasiran excreted in urine in 
patients with PH1 was lower. Mean Fe0-24 (%) ranged from 7.17 to 13.7% following single or multiple 
SC administration of lumasiran in study 001B. This difference was explained with the lower eGFR 
values in PH1 patients and was predicted not to influence the PK of lumasiran, since the majority of 
lumasiran is cleared from plasma by hepatic uptake.  
Metabolism 
The metabolism of lumasiran was investigated in vitro in human, mouse, rat and monkey serum and 
liver S9 fractions, and in vivo in rat and monkey plasma and liver samples obtained from nonclinical PK 
studies GO1-DSM15-022 and GO1-DSM15-020 and in vivo in human plasma and urine samples 
obtained from the single 6.0 mg/kg dose cohort (highest tested dose) in Study 001 (study BA15014). 
Lumasiran is metabolised primarily by nucleoside cleavage by exo- or endonucleases. While the sense 
strand is metabolised by sequential removal of GalNAc moieties and removal of the 3' nucleotide, the 
antisense (AS) strand is primarily metabolised to form AS(N-1)3ʹ lumasiran. This pharmacologically 
active metabolite was <10% of lumasiran in both plasma and urine in healthy subjects on lumasiran. A 
further deaminated metabolite pharmacologically equipotent to lumasiran may form in human liver, as 
observed in monkey liver, but was not detected in human plasma or urine. Lumasiran was not a 
substrate of CYP enzymes in vitro.   
The proposed biotransformation pathways of the lumasiran AS strand is presented in Figure 8.

humans

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the assessment of lumasiran pharmacokinetics (PK), dose proportionality analyses were exploratory 
in nature. While Cmax and AUC0-inf showed a linear increase, AUClast and AUC0-24 increased slightly  
Accumulation ratios were calculated using data from Studies 001B and 003 where patients received 
repeated doses of lumasiran. Across studies and dosing schedules, the mean and median accumulation 
ratio ranged from 0.86 to 1.29, confirming that lumasiran does not accumulate in plasma following 
repeated dosing, consistent with the short mean plasma half-life of 3 to 8 hours relative to monthly 
and once every 3 month dosing schedules evaluated in clinical studies. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
In the pooled PH1 population, 30, 30, and 11 subjects treated with lumasiran had normal renal 
function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min), and moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min), respectively, at baseline. There were no patients with severe 
renal impairment in the lumasiran clinical studies used in this comparison. 
Lumasiran Cmax values were available in 11 subjects with moderate renal impairment, while only 2 
moderate renal impairment patients contributed AUC values. This is because 9 of the 11 subjects were 
enrolled in Study 003 where AUC values could not be calculated. 
There was no trend in Cmax; a trend toward higher lumasiran AUC0-last values in patients with moderate 
renal impairment was noted however the small sample size for this analysis (n=2) did not allow to 
draw any robust conclusions.  
The population PK analysis, included 44 subjects (44.4%) with normal renal function, 44 subjects 
(44.4%) with mild renal impairment, and 11 subjects (11.1%) with moderate renal impairment at 
baseline.  
Renal clearance for lumasiran was fixed to the patient’s baseline renal function (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate [eGFR]*body surface area [BSA]/1.73).  In patients with normal renal function, the 
model estimated renal elimination to account for 20% of the CLP with 80% of administered lumasiran 
available for liver uptake. Renal impairment is predicted to result in lowering of urinary excretion of 
urine (<20%) leading to transiently higher circulating plasma concentrations and consequently a 
higher fraction available for liver uptake (>80%). 
In addition, lumasiran is being evaluated in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Study 005. 
Preliminary PK data from this study are summarised in Table 17.

Analysis Set, Study 005)

Impaired hepatic function 
To categorise hepatic function, NCI-ODWG liver dysfunction criteria as defined in the following were 
used: Normal: total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN; Mild: (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN) or 
(ULN < total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN); Moderate: 1.5 x ULN < total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN. 
According to this classification, in the pooled population of patients with PH1 treated with the 
recommended doses of lumasiran, 70 patients had normal hepatic function, 2 patients from the 
placebo arm of Study 003 had mild hepatic impairment; and one patient from Study 001 had moderate 
hepatic impairment.  Due to sparse sampling in Study 003, AUC data were not available for the 2 
patients with mild hepatic impairment 
Median steady-state plasma Cmax and AUC0-last values for lumasiran were comparable across hepatic 
function groups. 
Weight 
The influence of body weight on Cmax and AUC of lumasiran following treatment with the 
recommended dose across pre-defined weight groups is summarised in Figure 9.  
Figure 9. Comparison of lumasiran Cmax and AUC across studies by body weight group in PH1 subjects 
treated with phase 3 regimens of lumasiran (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set) 
Note: Assessment values were from Baseline/Day 1 visit. Cmax values in Study 003 were lumasiran plasma concentrations at 4 
hours post-dose (Baseline/Day 1). 
In the database included in the population PK analysis, body weight ranged from 6.2 to 110 kg, with 
median of 55.0 kg. Population PK analysis revealed that body weight had an impact on hepatic 
clearance and intercompartmental clearance, central and peripheral volume of distribution and ka. 
Absorption rate constant decreased with increasing body weight and the other parameters increased 
with increasing body weight, whereas body weight corrected clearance decreased with increasing body 
weight.

Age 
PK data from 26 adults aged ≥18 years and 47 adolescents and children aged <1 year to <18 years 
(overall age range: 4 months to 60 years) were available. No elderly patients were included in the 
development programme. 
The effect of age was evaluated by comparing lumasiran PK and PD in patients in predefined age 
categories (Figure 10). 
Figure 10: 
Comparison of lmasiran Cmax and AUC across studies by age in PH1 subjects treated 
with Phase 3 regimens of lumasiran (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set) 
Note: Assessment values were from Baseline/Day 1 visit. Cmax values in Study 003 were lumasiran plasma concentrations at 4 
hours postdose (Baseline/Day 1). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated in vivo DDI studies were submitted. 
Concomitant use of pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) 
Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is a current non-approved therapy to treat PH1. Pyridoxine is primarily 
metabolised in the liver, with the major metabolite being 4-pyridoxic acid, which is inactive and 
excreted in urine.  
Comparison of the PK of lumasiran in patients with and without concomitant pyridoxine using pooled 
data from Studies 001A, 001B, 003, and 004 revealed a slight tendency for increased lumasiran 
exposure with concomitant use of Vitamin B6. In the patients with concomitant use of Vitamin B6, 
median Cmax and AUC0-last of lumasiran was 623 ng/mL and 8270 h•ng/mL, compared to 486 ng/mL 
and 7140 h•ng/mL, respectively, without concomitant use of Vitamin B6.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamic 
The applicant has conducted as the main source of dose-finding and dose determination the studies 
001 and 002, which have been described above. In addition, dose-finding and dose-determination for 
the product was also based on an extensive PK (described in the previous section) and PK-PD 
modelling exercise.

Population PKPD modelling 
A PKPD model was developed to quantify the relationship between predicted human liver PK and 
pharmacodynamic response observed as plasma glycolate elevation in adult healthy volunteers and 
urinary oxalate reduction in PH1 patients ≥6 years of age. Clinical data available as of 20 March 2018 
were used in the development and validation of the PK/PD model. A total of 277 observed plasma 
glycolate measurements up to 17 months post dose were available at the time of model development.  
The population PK/PD model was used to simulate steady state urinary oxalate profiles at 1.0 to 6.0 
mg/kg dose levels following continuous qM or q3M SC administrations. Simulation results showed dose 
dependent oxalate reductions over the dose range studied, with diminishing additional effect predicted 
with higher doses consistent with an asymptotic rather than linear relationship. A 3.0 mg/kg q3M dose 
of lumasiran is predicted to suppress UOx to near normal levels with median predicted value of 0.44 
(90% PI: 0.32- 0.73) mMol/24-hour/1.73m2 at steady-state. Thus, quarterly doses of at least 3.0 
mg/kg are needed to reduce urinary oxalate levels to near or within normal. 
When more clinical data were available, two additional PKPD models were developed: a model for 24-
hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA in PH1 patients ≥6 years of age, and a model for spot urinary 
oxalate:creatinine ratio in PH1 patients across all ages from infants to adults including data from 
studies 001 Part B, Study 002, Study 003, and Study 004.   
For the first model, the significant covariates were the effect of eGFR on baseline 24-hour urinary 
oxalate corrected for BSA and baseline 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA on Imax. 
For the second model, significant parameter-covariate relationships were time-varying height and 
baseline eGFR for the baseline spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio and baseline spot urinary 
oxalate:creatinine ratio for Imax. 
Mechanism of action 
Lumasiran targets the 3’ untranslated region of HAO1 mRNA in the liver, thereby preventing the 
synthesis of the corresponding GO protein. Lumasiran is designed with a GalNAc moiety conjugated to 
the sense strand of the siRNA to enable selective delivery to the liver via uptake by the 
asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). ASGPRs are expressed primarily and abundantly (0.5 to 1 million 
per cell) on the cell surface of hepatocytes and specifically bind to the glycoproteins with terminal 
galactose or GalNAc residues. 
Binding of the GalNAc ligand of lumasiran and ASGPR triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis of the 
ligand-receptor complex, resulting in release of the siRNA into the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte. ASGPR 
is subsequently recycled to the cell surface and is available for successive uptake of circulating GalNAc-
conjugated siRNA.  
Upon delivery to the liver, the double-stranded lumasiran siRNA is loaded into the cellular multiprotein 
enzyme cleavage complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytosol. Once 
loaded, the antisense strand (guide strand) of lumasiran binds to the complementary sequence in the 
HAO1 mRNA. Pairing of HAO1 mRNA with the antisense strand within the RISC/siRNA complex results 
in cleavage of the HAO1 mRNA, thereby preventing the synthesis of the corresponding GO protein, 
which in turn reduces – by reducing the target substrate of GO, glyoxylate – the production of oxalate 
in the liver. The underlying enzymatic defect (relating to AGT) is not targeted with the proposed 
treatment.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PD in healthy volunteers: 
32 healthy volunteers were included in study 001A and the evaluation of the plasma glycolate levels 
showed a clear dose dependent increase over time, with a plateau being reached after about 6 weeks 
after the single dose administered with stable levels to the end of the administration period. No effects 
could be seen with the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg BW.  
PD in patients: 
This refers to the Part B of study 001 which was the MAD part of the study in PH1 patients with 
relatively preserved renal function (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] >45 
mL/min/1.73m2). 
In this trial, patients were randomised 3:1 to lumasiran or placebo into the dosing cohorts 1.0 mg/kg 
once monthly, 3.0 mg/kg once monthly, or 3.0 mg/kg once every 3 months, and all patients received 
the first dose of lumasiran on Day 1. Treatment was for a primary period of 85 days, with a switch of 
placebo-treated patients afterwards, and a prolonged observation period for all patients. Long-term 
observations were evaluated for an observation period of 197 day altogether.  
Results on the reduction of urinary oxalate from this study are summarised in Table 18. 
Table 18. 24-Hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA (mmol/24h/1.73m2) and percent change from 
baseline, Part B (Placebo Comparison Analysis Set [Day 1 to Day 85]) 
Results for the lumasiran-Treated Analysis Set (Day 1 to Day 197, Figure 11) were consistent with the 
placebo-comparison dataset, indicating maintenance of effect with repeat dosing. The overall mean 
percent reduction was greatest for the 3.0 mg/kg once monthly dose regimen compared to the 1.0 
mg/kg once monthly and the 3.0 mg/kg once every 3 months regimen at each time point from Day 29 
to Day 197, indicating a dose dependent response in 24-hour urinary oxalate levels to lumasiran.

Figure 11. Study 001: 24-hour urine oxalate corrected for BSA over time by dose cohort, Part B 
(Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set: Single-Blind Period) 
Reduction in 24-hour urine oxalate:creatinine ratio was evident by Day 29 in lumasiran-treated 
patients, while no change was observed in placebo-treated patients. A greater reduction in 24-hour 
urine oxalate:creatinine ratio was observed with 3 mg/kg qM compared to other dose cohorts at each 
time point. The reduction of 24-hour urine oxalate:creatinine ratios was sustained through Day 197, 
with some recovery observed for the 1 mg/kg qM and 3 mg/kg quarterly groups on Day 197. 
PH1 patients treated with lumasiran showed a decrease in plasma oxalate levels, consistent with the 
reduction in urine oxalate excretion. Patients treated with lumasiran had an overall mean percent 
reduction in plasma oxalate of 48.4% (n=15) at Day 57 and 44.0% (n=18) at Day 85. For patients 
initially treated with lumasiran, the reduction in plasma oxalate observed during the blinded treatment 
period, Day 1 to Day 85, was maintained through Day 113 for the 3 mg/kg q3M dose group. 
By Day 29, all patients in the lumasiran groups had an observable increase in 24-hour urine 
glycolate:creatinine ratios: 37.3%, 36.8% and 26.7% in the 1 mg/kg qM, 3 mg/kg qM and 3 mg/kg 
q3M groups, respectively. Patients in the 1 mg/kg qM group had the highest mean increase at Day 57 
(79.7%). All dose groups showed a sustained increase in 24-hour urinary glycolate:creatinine ratios 
through Day 85. 
Increases in spot urine glycolate:creatinine ratios were observed by Day 15, with continued increase 
over the dosing period that ranged from 16.8% (Day 15) to 208.3% (Day 57). In the placebo-treated 
patients, the glycolate:creatinine ratios remained relatively stable during the 85-day treatment period 
Plasma glycolate levels increased in patients treated with lumasiran. By Day 29, a mean increase in 
plasma glycolate of 23.6% and 33.0% was observed in the 1 mg/kg qM and 3 mg/kg qM groups, 
respectively. Data were not available for patients in the 3 mg/kg q3M group since plasma PK samples 
(which served in this study as samples for plasma glycolate analysis re-testing using a validated 
analysis [refer to Study 001 CSR addendum 1-erratum 1]) were not drawn for this cohort on Day 29. 
Overall, the magnitude of plasma glycolate increase was similar to that seen in urine and did not show 
a dose-response.

PD activity was also shown for the long-term treatment in Study 002. This is an ongoing Phase 2, 
Multicenter, Open-Label, Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Administration of ALN-GO1 in 
Patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1. Eligibility of patients was based on the previous treatment 
of patients in study 001 within 12 months of study completion of part 001B. The study duration was 
planned to be 54 months.  
Patients were to initiate dosing with SC lumasiran at the same dose and regimen as they received in 
Study 001B (1 mg/kg once monthly, 3 mg/kg once monthly, or 3 mg/kg once every 3 months). All 
patients were later switched to either 3.0 mg/kg QM, or 3.0 mg/kg q3M (reporting of the results 
therefore refer to two treatment groups only). The evaluation of the PD parameters was entirely 
descriptive. The endpoints used for the trial were similar to those of trial 001B. Baseline for the study 
was defined as the derived baseline value in Study 001B. 
All 20 patients from study 001B were included into the trial. The currently documented drug exposure 
for this study amounts to a median/mean of 10.4/11.2 months, respectively. Figure 12 shows the 
results for the percent change of 24-hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio. 
Figure 12. Mean percent change (±SEM) from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio by 
visit (Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set, Study 002) 
At baseline in Study 001B, the mean plasma oxalate concentration for all patients was 15.3 μmol/L. 
Consistent with the observations in 24-hour urinary oxalate, patients showed stable reductions in 
plasma oxalate levels during treatment in Study 002, with mean values that approached the lower 
detection limit of 5.55 μmol/L. The mean maximum percent reduction for all patients was 53.1% 
(range: 12.5 to 76.4%). 
Reductions were also observed in the spot urine oxalate:creatinine ratios during treatment in Study 
002 that were consistent in magnitude and durability with the reductions observed in 24-hour urinary 
oxalate:creatinine ratios. The highest mean percent reduction from baseline was observed at the 
Month 3 visit (74.8%) and levels were stable thereafter. 
Mean plasma glycolate levels were higher at the start of Study 002, due to persistence of the 
treatment effect from Study 001B. Levels increased after resuming treatment and then stabilised, at 
Assessment report

approximately 50% above baseline in Study 001B. Glycolate plasma levels were also monitored in 
other studies, but were partly considered to be markers of safety (see safety assessment). 
Plasma glycolate levels observed in patients enrolled in the lumasiran clinical trials are presented in 
Table 19. 
Table 19. Baseline and post-dose plasma glycolate levels from patients enrolled in studies 002, 003, 
004, and 005. Data are presented as median (IQR) observed levels (μmol/L) and median (IQR) 
percent change from baseline. 
Mean 24-hour urinary glycolate:creatinine ratios were increased compared to baseline in Study 001B 
and stable during treatment in Study 002. At the Month 3 visit, a single patient (003-001) treated with 
3.0 mg/kg once monthly had a markedly elevated 24-hour urinary glycolate:creatinine ratio of 4.410 
mmol/mmol, approximately 10 times the patient’s baseline level. The patient’s 24-hour urinary 
glycolate:creatinine ratios at subsequent visits at Months 6 and 9 were consistent with the means for 
all patients at these timepoints. 
Spot urine glycolate:creatinine ratios were increased compared to baseline in Study 001B, consistent 
with the increases observed in 24-hour urinary glycolate:creatinine ratios, and were then stable during 
treatment in Study 002. For patient 003-001, who had a marked elevation in 24-hour urinary 
glycolate:creatinine ratio at the Month 3 visit, the patient’s spot urine glycolate:creatinine ratio at 
Month 3 (0.820 mmol/mmol) was consistent with the mean level for all patients at this timepoint 
(0.715 mmol/mmol). 
No dedicated studies on secondary pharmacology were submitted. 
Anti-drug antibodies 
Immunogenicity assessment was conducted using data across lumasiran Studies 001A, 001B, 002, 
003, and 004. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in lumasiran-treated healthy subjects and 
patients was 6% with low ADA titers (1:50). The presence of ADA was transient and did not influence 
the PK and PD of lumasiran.

Dose selection for PH1 patients < 6 years of age 
In order to select an optimal lumasiran regimen for children less than 6 years old, the PKPD model was 
updated to extend the predictive capability of the model to include infants (at birth) up to adulthood. 
In the integrated PKPD model, the effect of body weight on lumasiran PKPD was estimated by 
simultaneously modeling PKPD data from monkeys (median weight 3.5 kg), healthy human adults 
(median weight 75 kg), and PH1 patients 6 years and above (median body weight 35 kg) using 
allometry.  
In the 0 to 1 years, 1 to 6 years, and 6 years old age category, the mean liver weights as a percentage 
of body weight were 3.5%, 2.9%, and 2.0%, respectively. Hence, liver concentrations of lumasiran are 
expected to be lower in children. In addition, elimination rate of lumasiran is expected to be faster in 
children compared to adults, based on the principle of allometry. Renal function matures to 50 and 
90% of adult levels by 3 and 12 months of age, respectively. Simulations on different dosing regimen 
were conducted (Figure 13). 
Figure 13. Suboptimal UOx suppression in <20 kg PH1 patients on dose regimen selected for ≥20 kg 
PH1 patients (3 mg/kg qMx3 Loading and 3 mg/kg q3M Maintenance) 
For children below 6 years, limited clinical data are available. A PKPD model for spot urinary oxalate 
values was developed. Based on this model, simulations were conducted to demonstrate the impact of 
the proposed lumasiran dosing regimens in different weight groups (Figures 14, 15).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
After SC administration, lumasiran is absorbed from the injection site into plasma with median Tmax 
ranging between 1.5 to 9 hours and is detectable in plasma up to 48 hours post dose. Lumasiran is 
rapidly cleared from the plasma with a half-life of 3 to 8 hours. While Cmax and AUC0-inf showed a 
linear increase, AUClast and AUC0-24 increased slightly more than proportional over the dose range 0.3 
mg/kg to 6.0 mg/kg. No accumulation of lumasiran in plasma was observed after repeated once 
monthly or once every 3 months (quarterly) dosing.  
Plasma protein binding was moderate to high (77 to 85%) at clinically relevant concentrations in 
plasma from adult healthy donors. The population estimate for the apparent central volume of 
distribution (Vd/F) of lumasiran was 4.9 L (0.07 L/kg) for a typical 70 kg adult. While the sense strand 
is metabolised by sequential removal of GalNAc moieties and removal of the 3' nucleotide, the 
antisense (AS) strand is primarily metabolised to form AS(N-1)3ʹ lumasiran. This pharmacologically 
active metabolite was <10% of lumasiran in both plasma and urine in healthy subjects on lumasiran. A 
further deaminated metabolite pharmacologically equipotent to lumasiran may form in human liver, as 
observed in monkey liver, but was not detected in human plasma or urine. Lumasiran was not a 
substrate of CYP enzymes in vitro. 
Renal clearance is a minor route of elimination of unchanged lumasiran from human plasma. The 
population PK model estimated that CLR accounted for <20% of the total clearance for lumasiran in 
patients with normal renal function (eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m2). In healthy subjects, a mean of 17.4 
to 25.8% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged lumasiran over 24 hours 
compared to 7.17 to 13.7% in patients with PH1. This difference was explained with the lower eGFR 
values in PH1 patients, and was not judged to influence the PK of lumasiran, with the majority of 
lumasiran cleared from plasma by hepatic uptake. 
The effect of intrinsic factors on PK of lumasiran was evaluated using pooled data from a Non-
compartmental analysis (NCA) and in the population PK analysis. In patients with renal impairment, 
median AUC0-last was 25% higher in patients with moderate renal impairment in NCA, however, due the 
very limited sample size, robust conclusion could not be reached. In the population PK analysis, 
simulations indicated that renal impairment has minimal impact (≤20%) on the predicted AUC and 
Cmax of lumasiran without the need for dose adjustment in renally impaired patients. Interim PK data 
in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis show 3- to 7-fold higher Cmax and 
2- to 3.5-fold AUC0-last increase relative to non-dialysis patients within the same body weight 
category in a preliminary comparison. Since the decline in plasma levels was similar as in patients 
without ESRD, it is expected that the increased plasma levels would not result in relevant extrahepatic 
distribution of the compound based on the molecular properties.  
Hepatic function classification of patients included in the development programme was based on the 
NCI-ODWG criteria which are not considered suitable to diagnose the presence and define the level of 
hepatic impairment. Thus, data in patients with hepatic impairment is considered missing. Limited 
pharmacokinetic data in patients with mild and transient elevations in total bilirubin (total bilirubin 
>1.0 to 1.5×ULN) showed comparable plasma exposure of lumasiran and similar pharmacodynamics 
as patients with normal hepatic function. Published literature reports have shown lower expression of 
the ASGPR in the liver, i.e. the receptors responsible for lumasiran uptake, in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Non-clinical data suggest that this may not influence liver uptake or pharmacodynamics at 
therapeutic doses. The clinical relevance of these data is, however, unknown and in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment there is a potential for decreased efficacy. Therefore, caution is 
warranted when treating these patients and efficacy should be carefully monitored as there is a 
potential for decreased efficacy.

Increased systemic exposure to lumasiran was detected also in the youngest patients below the age of 
1 year. Further, limited data are available in this age group. These patients should, therefore, be 
treated with caution.  
No elderly patients were included in the development programme. This was considered acceptable as 
although patients can be diagnosed with PH1 at any age, most individuals experience their first 
symptoms in early childhood.  
Available in vitro data, show that there is a low risk for CYP- related clinical PK interactions as 
substrate or inhibitor of CYPs at clinically relevant concentrations. Presently available in vitro data do 
not indicate a need for clinical DDI studies. 
Based on median AUC, lumasiran exposure appeared to be slightly increased with concomitant use of 
Vitamin B6, however substantial overlap in exposures was observed. The incidence of treatment-
emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) due to lumasiran was 6%. Presence of ADA did not appear to 
impact on the PK of lumasiran.  
PK /PD modelling data indicate that plasma PK is not a predictor of PD activity. Liver PK, on the other 
hand, appears to drive the pharmacological effect. 
The parameters chosen for the evaluation of the pharmacodynamic activity, namely urinary oxalate, 
plasma oxalate, urinary glycolate, and plasma glycolate were considered adequate as a means for 
assessing and documenting the PD activity of the compound. Of these, the glycolate related 
parameters are the only PD parameter that can also be used in healthy volunteers. The urinary oxalate 
related parameters were evaluated based on 24-hour urine collections (and normalised for body 
surface area), and with spot urine evaluations which were expressed as and related to the creatinine 
concentration in urine, in order to account for the dilution status of the urine measured. The chosen 
parameters are considered fully adequate to evaluate the PD activity of the compound.  
Submitted results show a clear response following lumasiran administration in the reduction of urinary 
oxalate excretion and plasma oxalate and the increase in glycolate. The monthly doses appear to 
induce a more rapid onset of effect, and finally greater absolute and relative difference to baseline and 
to placebo (for which no relevant changes were observed), as compared to the dose administered q3M. 
The 3 mg/kg monthly dose demonstrated overall somewhat larger effects than the 1 mg/kg dose. 
These comparisons however cannot be considered conclusive due to the low number of patients 
included in the placebo and the three-monthly dose groups.  
The long-term analysis revealed a clear maintenance of the effects seen during the initial dosing 
period, consistently favouring the 3 mg/kg monthly dose over the two other doses at least for the 24-
hour urine-based oxalate excretion data. However, it could also be demonstrated that the 3 monthly 
dosing was also able to maintain the effects observed initially, which was considered as a 
demonstration that the dosing interval could be appropriate for long-term treatment. 
Available data support the PD activity of the compound in the target population of patients from the 
age of 6 years.  
Patients from study 001 could enter a long-term open-label extension study (Study 002) after 
termination of study 001. No new patients were recruited for this study. This study is still ongoing at 
the time of submission and reported with an interim report. For this trial, the endpoints reported also 
include the similar PD endpoints reported in the trial 001, and include a comparison to baseline, which 
was defined as the baseline before inclusion into study 001. The planned study duration is 54 months, 
and this trial therefore will also provide data on the long-term safety and efficacy of lumasiran. 
In this trial, patients were initially receiving their last dose in trial 001, but patients receiving 1.0 mg 
kg monthly were later switched to the two 3.0 mg/kg doses (at 3 and 6 months). All patients were 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 64/112 
 
 
 
observed for at least 6 months in the submitted interim report and the mean/median exposure was 
11.1/10.4 months in total. The pharmacodynamic effects observed in this study were fully consistent 
with the results achieved in study 002, and a full maintenance of the effects with only minimal 
fluctuation could be demonstrated. 
Body weight-based dosing is recommended for lumasiran based on available clinical data and PK and 
PK/PD modelling. The latter has some deficiencies, as the correlation between plasma PK and liver PK 
was not evaluated and modelling assumptions were based on allometric scaling between species. 
Furthermore, the impact of immature organ function (liver and kidney) in the paediatric population 
were not fully considered. Nevertheless, the overall model was in good agreement with the spot 
urinary oxalate:creatinine ratios observed for this population.  
With regards to intrinsic factors such as age and body weight, in children, weight-normalised clearance 
was 1.8 to 2-fold higher in infants below 10 kg and 1.5-fold higher in children 10 to <20 kg compared 
to adults. Even though weight-normalised clearance was increased 1.5-fold in children between 10 and 
20 kg, a 2-fold higher dose is proposed for this body weight category. Tmax occurred earlier in 
younger children (with lower body weight) and elimination phase was faster. Overall, this resulted in a 
median observed exposure (AUC) that was higher in the lower body weight categories for the proposed 
loading doses. So, overall, with the proposed doses, exposure in children below 6 years (<20 kg) is 
expected to be slightly higher compared to adults. The applicant stated that slightly higher plasma 
concentrations in paediatric patients were needed in order to account for higher liver size relative to 
body weight in children, and rapid growth in body weight and liver size in addition to allometric scaling 
to account for faster clearance in paediatric liver. Lumasiran, at the proposed dosing regimen, is 
estimated to yield a spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio that approaches ULN by Month 3. Oxalate 
levels at Month 6 are expected to be similar to oxalate levels at Month 3, which would indicate that 
maximum lowering is achieved by Month 3 using a loading dose regimen and is subsequently 
maintained with the maintenance regimen. 
As there are only limited data, the potential effects of increased lumasiran exposure in the younger 
population will be further characterised in the ongoing study ALN-GO1-004 and the planned 
observational study ALN-GO1-007.  
The applicant did not submit secondary pharmacology studies. The lack of such studies was considered 
acceptable, as based on its PK and PD properties, no PD interaction with lumasiran is expected.  
Further extended long-term storage stability data still needs to be reported for plasma and urine 
samples that have not been analysed from study ALN-GO1-002. It is recommended that the applicant 
submits there results once stability sample testing is complete. 
Overall, it can be concluded that the documentation of the pharmacodynamics has adequately 
documented the activity of the compound adapted to the small numbers/rare disease prevalence, and 
that the trials conducted for the PK-PD programme formed an adequate basis for the further 
investigation of the compound.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of lumasiran in the target organ (liver) drives the long duration of PD effect. The 
majority of lumasiran is cleared from plasma by ASGPR-mediated hepatic uptake, with renal clearance 
contributing to a lesser extent.  
As lumasiran has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment, caution is required when 
treating patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment Tand efficacy should be monitored in 
these patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 65/112 
 
 
 
Increases in systemic exposures are expected in renal impairment and caution should be used when 
treating these patients. Weight-based subcutaneous dosing of lumasiran is being proposed based on 
observed data but also PK and PK/PD modelling.  
Data in children under the age of 6 years of age are still relatively limited, however, no safety concerns 
specific for the young paediatric population have been raised. Additional information in this population 
will be collected through the ongoing studies as described in the RMP.

Treatments 
Lumasiran was administered as a solution for injection that contains 189 mg/mL lumasiran (equivalent 
to 200 mg/mL of lumasiran sodium). Placebo was supplied as a sterile, preservative free normal saline 
0.9% solution. Study drug was administered SC based on total body weight. 
Body weight collected within 3 months prior to the study drug dose or the pre-dose weight collected on 
the study visit day or dosing day was used for dose calculations. 
During the DB Period (Day 1 through Month 6 assessments), patients received loading doses of 3.0 
mg/kg lumasiran or an equivalent volume of placebo once monthly for 3 doses (at the Day 1, Month 1, 
and Month 2 visits), followed by 1 maintenance dose of 3.0 mg/kg lumasiran or placebo administered 
at the Month 3 visit. All doses were SC injections. 
Starting at Month 6 (after the Month 6 assessments), all patients were to receive active drug in the 
Extension Period; however, to preserve the blind for the prior DB Period, treatments were: 
- 
- 
In patients randomised to placebo: loading doses of lumasiran 3.0 mg/kg once monthly for 3 
doses (at the Month 6, 7, and 8 visits). 
In patients randomised to lumasiran: maintenance dose at the Month 6 visit as well as placebo 
doses at the Month 7 and 8 visits. 
At Month 9 (after the Month 9 assessments), all patients received their first open-label maintenance 
dose of lumasiran.  
Objectives 
The Primary Objective of the trial was to evaluate the effect of lumasiran on percent reduction in 
urinary oxalate excretion.  
The secondary objectives were the characterisation of the effect of lumasiran on absolute levels of 
urinary oxalate excretion, the oxalate:creatinine ratios, and plasma oxalate, the effect of lumasiran on 
renal function, and to evaluate the long-term treatment effect of lumasiran.  
Exploratory objectives included the evaluation of quality of life, the changes (in the occurrence of) 
nephrocalcinosis and renal stones, and several PD and PK parameters.

Extension Period endpoint, which includes several individual endpoints: Change from baseline 
(percent and absolute) in: 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion, 24-hour urinary 
oxalate:creatinine ratios, and eGFR; and percentage of time that 24-hour urinary oxalate is ≤
1.5×ULN; all available Extension Period data are presented as of the cutoff date for this 
interim CSR. 
The exploratory endpoints comprised the following: Change in KDQOL for patients ≥18 years of age at 
screening, and the PedsQL (generic and ESRD modules) for patients <18 years of age at screening, the 
change in EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS; the change in rate of renal stone events, the change in 
nephrocalcinosis as assessed by renal ultrasound, the change in urinary and plasma glycolate, the 
change in urinary oxalate:creatinine ratios as assessed in random spot urine collections, the PK profile 
of lumasiran, the frequency of ADA, the change in patient resource use (eg, work/school attendance, 
visits to doctor/hospital), the change in patient experiences as evaluated by patient and caregiver 
experience surveys, and the frequency and seriousness of AEs. 
Sample size 
Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive lumasiran or placebo, respectively. Assuming a mean percent 
reduction from baseline to Month 6 in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA of 17% in the placebo 
arm and a standard deviation (SD) in both arms of 25%, 24 patients were calculated to provide 90% 
power to detect a treatment difference of 37% at a 2-sided 5% significance level (ie, 54% reduction in 
the lumasiran arm). To account for potential drop-outs, 30 patients were planned to be enrolled in the 
study. 
Randomisation 
Using an Interactive Response System (IRS), patients were randomised 2:1 to lumasiran or placebo. 
Randomization was stratified by mean urinary oxalate level (>1.70 versus ≤1.70 mmol/24hr/1.73m2) 
calculated using the values obtained from the first 2 valid baseline 24-hour urine collections.  
Each patient was uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient 
identification number. Upon signing the ICF, the patient was assigned a patient identification number 
by the IRS. The Investigator or his/her designee contacted the IRS to randomise the patient after 
confirming that the patient fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 
Blinding (masking) 
Because the drug product was different in colour and appearance to placebo (lumasiran: yellow, 
placebo: colourless), the site pharmacists were involved in ensuring the double-blind administration: 
All site pharmacists who prepared study drug during the blinded period of the study were to ensure 
that each syringe was covered in provided yellow transparent film in order to mask the identity of 
study drug. All other personnel of both sponsor and investigational sites remained blinded until final 
collection of the month 6 data.

Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) based Mixed-Effect 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. The outcome variable was percent change from baseline 
in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA (mmol/24hr/1.73m2) at Months 3, 4, 5, and 6. Analysis 
included fixed effects of treatment arm (lumasiran versus placebo) and scheduled visits (Months 3, 4, 
5, and 6), as well as continuous, fixed covariate of baseline 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA 
(mmol/24hr/1.73m2) level and patient as a random factor.. 
The primary comparison was the least squares (LS) mean treatment difference (lumasiran-placebo) in 
percent change from baseline of 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion from Months 3 to 6. This LS mean 
difference was presented along with corresponding standard errors of the mean (SEMs), 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), and p-value from the model. 
Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity to the estimated treatment effect 
by the assumption that the treatment effect reaches steady state at Month 3 and is maintained 
through Month 6: 
-  Sensitivity Analysis 1 estimates the treatment effect of the primary endpoint without assuming 
equal treatment effect from Month 3 through Month 6. The analysis adds the interaction of visit 
and treatment to the primary MMRM model, when Month 3 through Month 6 data are used. 
-  Sensitivity Analysis 2, similar to Sensitivity Analysis 1, estimates the treatment effect of the 
primary endpoint without assuming equal treatment effect from Month 3 through Month 6, but 
includes all post-baseline data (including percent change from baseline at Months 1 and 2). 
A gatekeeping testing strategy was implemented to control the overall type I error rate. The primary 
endpoint was compared between treatment arms at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. If statistically 
significant, then the secondary endpoints listed below were tested at the same level of 0.05 in the 
following hierarchical order: 
-  Absolute change in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA from baseline to Month 6 
-  Change in 24-hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio (value/ULN) from baseline to Month 6 
- 
- 
 Proportion of patients with 24-hour urinary oxalate level below 1.5xULN [ULN=0.46 
mmol/24h/1.73m2] at Month 6 
Proportion of patients with 24-hour urinary oxalate level below ULN [ULN=0.46 
mmol/24h/1.73m2] at Month 6. 
Only if the comparison was significant at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 was the next endpoint in 
the hierarchy formally tested; if a given comparison was not significant, the subsequent tests were to 
be performed, and the results summarised, but statistical significance was not to be inferred. 
Continuous endpoints will be analysed using an MMRM approach similar to the one described for the 
primary endpoint. For binary endpoints, odds ratio and the differences in proportions with 
corresponding 95% confidence will be summarised.

Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 13 December 2018 
Interim data cut-off date: 06 November 2019 (additional interim data cut-off date: 01 May 2020) 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 5 major protocol deviations were reported among 4 patients: 
-  One patient had 2 short pauses in pyridoxine use and therefore did not maintain a stable 
pyridoxine regimen for the first 12 months following the first dose of study drug (one pause 
was during the DB Period and one pause was during the Extension Period). 
-  24-hour urine sample did not meet validity criteria and procedure was not repeated as 
specified (1 patient; Month 3) or sample was not collected (1 patient; Month 4). 
- 
The appropriate ICF was not signed by the patient/guardian prior to performing study 
procedures (1 patient). The patient signed consent during a clinic visit but had completed a 24-
hour urine collection during screening beforehand. 
The original protocol was finalised on 09 July 2018. Since then, there have been 2 major protocol 
amendments. 
Protocol Amendment 1 (23 July 2018): The primary purpose for this protocol amendment was to 
provide additional clarification about the patient caregiver surveys specific to patients under the legal 
age of consent, and to make corrections to the open-label extension period Schedule of Assessments, 
which was missing the Month 27 visit in Year 2 (Study Day 757 ±14 days). 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 71/112 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol Amendment 2 (19 March 2019): The primary purpose of Amendment 2 was to broaden the 
patient population by allowing enrolment of patients with a glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 
m2 and to align clinical objectives and endpoints across the Phase 3 program. 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographic data and disease characteristics of the included patients in study are shown

 Numbers analysed 
The analysis sets were defined as follows 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomised patients who received any amount of study drug. Patients were 
analysed according to the treatment to which they were randomised. 
Safety Analysis Set: All patients who received any amount of study drug. Patients were analysed 
according to the treatment actually received. 
PK Analysis Set: All patients who received any amount of study drug and have at least 1 PK 
concentration measurement. 
All Lumasiran Treated Set: All patients who received any amount of lumasiran, including patients who 
took lumasiran during the DB Period and patients who initially took placebo during the DB Period and 
then switched to lumasiran during the Extension Period. 
Plasma Oxalate Analysis Set: All patients who received any amount of study drug and have a baseline 
plasma oxalate level ≥1.5×lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ). 
The FAS was the primary population used to evaluate efficacy for the primary, secondary, and 
exploratory endpoints during the DB Period. Safety was analysed using the Safety Analysis Set. 
The PK Set was used to evaluate the PK endpoints. 
The Plasma Oxalate Analysis Set was used to evaluate the plasma oxalate endpoints. 
The All Lumasiran Treated Set was used to summarise the long-term efficacy and safety of lumasiran; 
all available long-term data are presented as of the cut-off date for this CSR. 
The analysis sets are summarised in Table 22.

Continued treatment with lumasiran (lumasiran/lumasiran group) in the Extension Period led to 
maintenance of this reduction through Month 12, with a mean percent change (SEM) from baseline in 
24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA of -66.9% (3.1%) at Month 6 and -64.1% (3.3%) at Month 
12. Placebo crossover patients had a mean (SEM) percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary 
oxalate corrected for BSA of -6.8% (5.8%) at Month 6. At Month 12 (6 months of lumasiran 
treatment), the mean (SEM) percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for 
BSA was -57.3% (4.9%) relative to the first dose of lumasiran in the Extension Period. 
Results from the two sensitivity analyses (adding the interaction of visit and treatment to the primary 
model and including all post-baseline data) are shown in Tables 24 and 25.

An investigation for the unexpected increase in the urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio results in all 
patients at months 7 and 8, identified inadequate mixing of 24-hour urine creatinine samples at the 
laboratory by one analyst affecting a total of 65 24-hour urinary creatinine samples obtained in the 
extension period. Results of a sensitivity analysis conducted excluding these samples are presented in 
Figure 22.

Continued treatment with lumasiran (lumasiran/lumasiran group) in the Extension Period led to 
maintenance of this reduction through Month 12, with a mean (SEM) percent change from baseline in 
plasma oxalate of -36.9% (4.9%) at Month 6 and -35.0% (6.1%) at Month 12. 
Placebo crossover patients had a mean (SEM) percent change from baseline in plasma oxalate of 
12.4% (6.9%) at Month 6. At Month 12 (6 months of lumasiran treatment), the mean (SEM) percent 
change from baseline in plasma oxalate was -48.9% (5.1%) relative to the first dose of lumasiran in 
the Extension Period.

Nephrocalcinosis development 
Renal ultrasound findings for nephrocalcinosis were graded for each kidney, with a range of 0 to 3, 
with a higher grade indicating greater severity. For the overall change in grade relative to baseline, 
“improving” was defined as bilateral improvement or unilateral improvement and no change on the 
opposite side; “worsening” was defined as bilateral worsening or unilateral worsening and no change 
on the opposite side; and “indeterminate” was defined as unilateral improvement with worsening on 
the opposite side. Results for the Double-blind and extension phases of Study ALN-G01-003 are 
presented in Table 32.

Urinary and Plasma Oxalate as Measures of Clinical Benefit in the Treatment of Primary 
Hyperoxaluria Type 1 
In order to predict the clinical benefit of any given percentage reduction in hepatic oxalate production 
for PH1 patients with relatively preserved renal function, a 2-part analysis using published data was 
performed. In Part 1, the effect of reductions in hepatic oxalate production on UOx values in the PH1 
population without ESRD was modelled. In Part 2, the UOx distributions to ESRD outcomes was linked.  
Modelling Part 1  
Recently-published registry data describing 192 patients with PH1 who presented without ESRD and 
had 24-hour UOx measures available from their time of diagnosis (Zhao et.al, 2016) were used to 
model the clinical effect (i.e. progression to ESRD) of reduced hepatic oxalate production on UOx in 
patients with PH1 and relatively preserved renal function (eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73m2), (Figure 27).

reductions in urinary oxalate

The y-axis of the histogram represents the relative frequency of each oxalate value in the population. 
Dashed vertical lines indicate values of urinary oxalate excretion that are 0.46 mmol/24hr/1.73m2 
(ULN) and 2.4 mmol/24hr/1.73m2, the latter of which is associated with an increased risk of 
developing ESRD at 30 years (Figure 13). [Zhao et.al, 2016] 
Modelling Part 2  
Using extrapolation of data on renal survival generated for all types of PH in the RKSC registry (Zhao 
et.al, 2016), the number of patients who are prevented from developing ESRD at 30 years follow up 
given the simulated reductions in UOx that was modelled in Part 1 was estimated (Table 34).

reductions in urinary oxalate from baseline.

Supportive studies 
Study ALN-G01-004 (ILLUMINATE B) 
Study ILLUMINATE B is an ongoing Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Lumasiran in Infants and Young Children with Primary 
Hyperoxaluria Type 1. The study was initiated on 22 April 2019 and the most recent interim reports 
submitted has a data cut-off date of 30 June 2020. This study consists of 2 periods: a 6-month Primary 
Analysis Period followed by a Long-term Extension Period of 54 months. 
Enrolment in the study has been completed. 18 patients have completed the 6-month primary analysis 
period and entered into the Long-term Extension Period. No patients have discontinued treatment or 
withdrawn from the study. 
This study recruited patients aged at least 37 weeks estimated gestational age but less than 6 years of 
age, and a documented diagnosis of PH 1. Urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio had to be greater than the 
upper limit of normal based on age on at least 2 of 3 single-void collections during screening. Other 
inclusion criteria were resembling those of study 003, e.g. exclusion of relevant other disease, and 
intake of pyridoxine. 
The proposed primary endpoint is the percent change in urinary oxalate excretion from baseline to 
Month 6, Secondary endpoints include absolute change in urinary oxalate excretion from baseline,  the 
proportion of patients with urinary oxalate excretion ≤ the upper limit of normal (ULN) and ≤ 1.5 x ULN,  
absolute and percent change of oxalate in plasma,  plasma PK parameters of lumasiran, and the 
change from BL in eGFR. 
Ten of 18 enrolled patients (55.6%) were female and 16 were white (88.9%). Median age at consent 
was 50.1 months (range: 3 to 72 months); 2 patients were <1 year of age, 2 patients were 1 to < 2 
years of age and 14 patients were 2 to <6 years of age. Median body weight at first lumasiran dose 
was 14.5 kg (range: 6.2 to 24.3 kg); 3 patients weighed < 10 kg, 12 patients weighed 10 to<20 kg 
and 3 patients weighed ≥20 kg.  
Baseline spot urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio, plasma oxalate, and plasma glycolate were highest in 
patients who weighed<10 kg (n=3) and lower in the 10 to< 20 kg (n=12) and ≥20 kg (n=3) initial 
weight dose groups. 
The cumulative median duration of exposure (N=18) to lumasiran was 10.51 months (range: 5.6 to 
13.4 months) during the study. The mean number of doses received per patient was 6.8 (range: 5 to 
12 doses) and the cumulative number of doses administered was 122; no doses were missed

Study ALN-G01-005 (“Study 005”): 
Study 005 is an ongoing, multicenter, Phase 3, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, 
and PD of lumasiran in patients with PH1 who have advanced renal disease, as evident by eGFR ≤45 
ml/min/1.73m2 (or serum creatinine elevated for age, in patients <12 months of age). No study report 
has been submitted, but the results of the data collected so far were presented (Data cut-off point 20 
May 2020).  
The study comprises a 6-month primary analysis period and a long-term Extension Period of up to 54 
months and 2 cohorts: Cohort A - patients who do not yet require dialysis, and Cohort B - patients on 
haemodialysis. 
Initial results are available in 4 patients (Cohort B; 2 male and 2 female) with the mean age of 7.8 
(range: 3 to 16) years. The overall mean (SD) baseline plasma oxalate measured was 129.6 (32.1) 
μmol/L. Three patients have received 2 doses of lumasiran, and 1 patient has received 3 doses. 
Data showed a reduction in plasma oxalate ≥33% in 3 patients at Month 1, suggesting that lumasiran 
may be effective in the patients with severe renal impairment receiving haemodialysis.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
As discussed in the clinical pharmacology section of this report, the applicant did not conduct a 
dedicated dose-finding study, but the proposed dosing was determined from data from studies 001 and 
002, and an extensive modelling exercise.  
The pivotal study conducted within the programme was Study 003, which is a randomised double-blind 
trial with a 6 months double-blind treatment period, and a long-term open-label extension period 
which is ongoing at the time of submission and projected to last for 54 months for all patients 
included. The study included patients with an age from 6 and older with a confirmed diagnosis of PH 1 
and a 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion rate of more than 0.70 mml/24hr/1.73 m2. Patients taking 
Vitamin B-6 could be included if stable conditions could be assured. No requirements on other standard 
background treatments (e.g. hyperhydration) were imposed. The patients had to have a relatively 
preserved renal function with at least an eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening.  
Overall, the included patient population is acceptable for the claimed indication even though patients 
appear to represent the mild to moderate spectrum of the disease.  
This trial used similar endpoints to the preceding studies 001B and 002, based on urinary oxalate 
excretion parameters (change in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion corrected for BSA (both absolute 
and relative changes), change in 24-hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio; change in plasma oxalate, 
and change in eGFR. Additionally, categorical responder-type analyses were added with the proportion 
of patients achieving near normal (at or below 1.5xULN) or normal 24-hour urinary oxalate levels. 
The applicant did not follow the initial protocol assistance advice to rank the categorical evaluation of 
normal or near normal oxalate urinary excretion as primary, however the proposed ranking and 
subsequent control of the type I error was intended to assure the compliance with this request.  
The primary analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) based Mixed-Effect 
Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach, which included two sensitivity analyses with different co-
variates and time-points to be imputed. Relevant subgroups according to age, gender, race, and 
baseline urinary oxalate excretion, as well as history of stone events, vitamin B6 intake, and region 
were also pre-defined. 
The design of the trial is generally considered adequate and suitable to document the efficacy of 
lumasiran, even though the short duration of the placebo-controlled treatment phase does not allow to 
draw conclusions on longer term treatment effects. Additional data from this study are expected to 
better characterise the long-term effects of lumasiran (see efficacy data and additional analysis below). 
The lab-based biomarker endpoints are surrogate endpoints for the clinical outcomes events of 
interest, such as the development of renal function over time (including manifestation of ESRD), the 
occurrence of renal stone events, and the development of nephrocalcinosis, as well as in late stage of 
disease, the development of oxalosis of other organs with the consequent impairments of function 
(e.g. heart with heart failure). The use of these surrogate endpoints is supported by their high 
theoretical biological plausibility. In addition, the applicant provided a rationale for the choice of these 
endpoints, primarily based on literature reports on the prognostic value of urinary oxalate excretion in 
“renal survival” and development and occurrence of kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis (e.g. Zhao 
et.al, 2016; Hoppe et.al, 2015, Milliner, et.al, 2020). 
The applicant has also submitted interim results from an open-label study in children aged under 6 
years (study 004). This trial, similar to 003, also includes a 6 months primary analysis period, and a 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 90/112 
 
 
 
long-term extension period up to 54 months. Due to the open-label design of this study, only baseline 
comparisons are included. In addition, due to the young age of the study population only a sub-
population was able to provide 24-hour urine collections, which is considered acceptable.  
The primary evaluation is urinary oxalate excretion based on the % change in spot urine Urinary 
oxalate:creatinine Ratio. Additional endpoints reported for this interim report further comprised plasma 
oxalate, and eGFR changes. The dosing in the young children was a once monthly dose for 3 months 
similar to older children and adults, which was, however, higher in children with a BW of less than 20 
kg. From the fourth dose onwards, the small children were also treated with q3M doses in the weight 
band above 10 kg BW, with those above 20 kg receiving the adult dose of 3 mg/kg q3M, and those 
between 10 and 20 kg receiving 6 mg/kg q3M. The children in the weight band under 10 kg were 
further treated with a monthly dose of 3 mg/kg BW. The inclusion criteria determined that – apart from 
having a diagnosis of PH1, the patients would need to have an oxalate:creatinine ratio above the upper 
limit of normal.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 003 included 39 patients randomised 2:1 to active and placebo treatment. There were only two 
discontinuations of the trial medication during the study. Baseline demographic and disease 
characteristics data were comparable between the two treatment groups, with some variation in 
subgroups (e.g. according to age and region) owing to the small sample size. Based on the baseline 
disease characteristics, the population could be classified of being mildly to moderately affected by PH1 
at the time of inclusion, and only a 15-20% of the study population had eGFR below 60 
mL/min/1.73m2. There were 5 major protocol deviations during the trial, all of which were not 
considered to impact on the validity of the data reported. Due to the low number of discontinuations 
for this initial study period, the number of missing values was limited, and their way of imputation is 
not considered to be of decisive relevance with regard to overall results. 
The primary evaluation of the trial documented a highly significant percent reduction from baseline to 
month 6 in the 234-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA, which was about 65%, as compared to 11 
% for the placebo group. The sensitivity analyses were in accordance with the primary evaluation. 
Similar statistically significant differences were seen in the absolute changes of this parameter. 
Continued treatment with lumasiran (lumasiran/lumasiran group) in the extension period led to 
maintenance of this reduction through Month 12, with a mean percent change from baseline in 24-hour 
urinary oxalate corrected for BSA of 64.1% at Month 12. Similar to patients randomised to lumasiran, 
placebo crossover patients had a rapid and sustained decrease in the 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected 
for BSA, with declines seen at 1 month after starting lumasiran and a similar time course and 
magnitude of decrease as lumasiran patients in the DB Period. In these patients at Month 12 (6 
months of lumasiran treatment), the mean percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate 
corrected for BSA was -57.3% relative to the first dose of lumasiran in the extension period. 
The evaluation of the 24-hour urine oxalate:creatinine ratio also revealed a just over 60% relative 
decrease compared with an about 11% decrease in placebo. Plasma oxalate decreased by about 40% 
for active treatment and remained virtually unchanged in the placebo group. A review of the percent 
change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio at each visit during the extension 
period showed increases in the lumasiran/lumasiran group at Months 7 and 8, with subsequent 
decreases observed at Months 9 and 12. Placebo crossover patients also showed an increase in 24-
hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio at Month 7, 1 month after starting lumasiran treatment. An 
investigation was conducted into these unexpected results identified inadequate handling of 24-hour 
urine creatinine samples by an analyst. A sensitivity analysis excluding affected urine creatinine

samples showed a consistent decrease in the in 24-hour urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio, for the 
duration of the study following initiation of lumasiran treatment. 
The categorical evaluation of patients achieving a “near normal” or “normal” urinary oxalate excretion 
was 84% and 52% respectively in the lumasiran treated patients during the double-blind phase with 
no patients in the placebo group achieving the thresholds. The evaluation of the absolute change in 
plasma oxalate was also in favour of the active treatment group, and highly statistically significant. All 
the secondary endpoints mentioned were included in a hierarchical testing procedure, and due to the 
significant results in all endpoints, this did not have to be stopped at any point.  
Plasma glycolate levels increased in actively treated patients, reflecting the PD activity expected 
whereas only some fluctuations occurred in placebo patients. 
Inconclusive results were reported for the clinical endpoints such as eGFR changes, renal stone events, 
and the ultrasound-based evaluation of nephrocalcinosis in the DB period of the study, that could be 
explained with the short duration of this period. Analysis of the 1-year data on renal stone events in 
the placebo - lumasiran vs. lumasiran – lumasiran group in conjunction with the pre-treatment rates 
do, however, suggest some trends to improvement with respect to renal events findings on active 
treatment, when compared to placebo or to baseline. Similar support could be derived from the 
ultrasound-based evaluation of nephrocalcinosis. 
Additional supportive evidence for the surrogate efficacy parameters chosen in the prevention of 
clinical events can be derived from case reports of patients with liver transplant (Cochat et, al, 1989; 
Coulthard and Lodge 1993; Galanti and Contreras 2010), as well as from studies on patients 
responding to Vitamin B6 treatment (van Woerden et.al, 2003).  
Finally, the applicant developed a mathematical model, according to which treatment with lumasiran 
would over the course of 30 years prevent 17-22 ESRD events per 100 patients treated. However, it 
would be recommended to update this model once data from the recently initiated study 005 in 
patients with renal impairment become available.  
The applicant also presented the pre-planned sub-group analyses according to age, gender, race, 
Vitamin B6 intake, baseline urinary oxalate, baseline eGFR, history of stone events, and two different 
evlauations of the region (North America vs. RoW and Europe vs. RoW). All results for the primary 
evaluation of this subgroup analysis showed consistency with the main outcome, except in the 
subgroup of adolescents, which is highly likely due to the small number of patients included (1 and 5 in 
the two groups). The results of this subgroup analysis add further reassurance on the robustness of 
the overall results.  
Available data from study 004 suggest that similar effects as seen in older children and in adults can 
be achieved in the very young paediatric population.  
Lumasiran treatment in this study resulted in a consistent decrease of urinary oxalate excretion, as 
measured by the spot urine oxalate:creatinine ratio. The decrease was more pronounced in patients 
with higher baseline oxalate levels. The mean eGFR remained relatively stable during the trial. 
However, it is noted that the variability is very high in the included 14 patients. 
Secondary endpoints other than the eGFR exclude a deterioration in the clinical condition of these 
patients. However, it is acknowledged that beneficial effects on renal function are unlikely to become 
visible after a short-term treatment of 6 months. Similar to study 003 for the older population, the 
ultrasound-based assessment of nephrocalcinosis appears to indicate some improvement across the 
still limited observation period. 
Extrapolation of the adult data lends additional support for use of lumasiran in the young paediatric 
population as the pathophysiology of the disease, and the mechanism of action of lumasiran are the

same across the different age groups.  As similar treatment effect could be expected therefore for 
adults and paediatric patients. This is confirmed by comparing the parameters used for urinary oxalate 
excretion in studies 003 and 004, which indeed show a similar magnitude of effect. 
The CHMP noted however, that data remain limited particularly in the most vulnerable population of 
the age of less than 1 or even 2 years, which were represented with 2 and 4 patients respectively and 
more data are expected in this sub-population through the ongoing studies 004 and 005. 
The long-term effects of lumasiran treatment on clinical events cannot be adequately evaluated within 
the timeframe of this procedure. Open-label extensions of all studies that the applicant has initiated in 
this condition are ongoing, and will potentially be able to provide more comprehensive data on long-
term effects, However, as these data will be collected in a non-comparative fashion the CHMP has 
recommended that the applicant should further characterise the natural history of the diseases, using 
existing registries. Information from such a study with untreated (or SOC-treated) patient population 
could be used as an additional demonstration of the benefit of the lumasiran-treated patients in the 
ongoing studies.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, efficacy of lumasiran in patients with primary hypeoxaluria type 1 has been demonstrated. 
Results from study 003 demonstrate strong and consistently statistically significant effects on the 
surrogate parameters chosen and show that oxalate production and excretion can be normalised in 
large percentage of treated patients. These results in conjunction with the high biological plausibility 
that this will translate to an improvement in clinically relevant events in the long run, and the positive 
trends in the clinical events observed, is considered a sufficient proof of efficacy. 
The observed results in the 18 patients treated for at least 6 months in study 004, further supports the 
use of lumasiran in all age groups.  
Additional data are expected from ongoing studies which will provide information on the long-term 
treatment effect and in the younger paediatric population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
In total, 105 subjects, including 81 patients with PH1 and 24 healthy volunteers are included in the 
lumasiran safety database. This includes 4 patients with terminal renal insufficiency from the 005 study 
(data cut-off point 14 May 2020) and the last 2 enrolled patients form study 004 that at the time of 
data cut-off had completed the 2-month visit but are not included in the pooled data-set.  
Seventy-five patients with PH1, including 54 paediatric patients are included in the overall pooled 
analysis with data cut-off dates of 30 January, 14 February and 09 March 2020 for studies 002, 003 
and 004, respectively. Thirty-nine patients provided placebo-controlled data (26 on lumasiran and 13 
on placebo) in study 003 and all of these completed the DB phase at the time of data cut-off.  
Information provided in this section refers to this overall pooled safety population of 75 patients unless 
otherwise stated. The extent of exposure for overall pooled experience is presented in Table 38.

Adverse events 
Overall, frequency of AEs observed in the placebo-controlled setting was higher on lumasiran as 
compared to placebo (102 in 84.6% patients vs. 18 AEs in 69.2% patients), with clearly more patients 
on lumasiran having drug-related AEs (42.3% of patients with 33.3% AEs vs. 7.7% of patients with 
5.6% AEs). Average number of AEs per patient in the patients with at least 1 AE was higher on 
lumasiran than on placebo (4.6 vs. 3 AEs per patient). Two patients stopped treatment due to an AE 
on lumasiran treatment, including 1 drug-related AE that was subsequently updated to not related by 
the Investigator.   
In the pooled data analyses majority of the patients (77.3%) reported at least 1 AE during lumasiran 
treatment (215 AEs in total and 3.7 AEs per patient with an AE) and cross-study analysis showed some 
differences between the studies. All patients > 6 years developed an AE on the highest dose tested (3 
mg/kg qM; 002 study; 7/7 patients; 25 AEs; 3.6 AEs/patient), whereas, the largest study (003) 
evaluating the recommended therapeutic dose had the lowest proportion of patients with AEs (66.7%) 
across the pooled studies. The lowest number of AEs per patient (2.3 AE/patient) was reported on the 
lowest lumasiran dose (002 study; 1 mg/kg qM, or 3 mg/kg q3M dose arm) tested, whereas the 
highest average number of AEs per patient was in 003 study (127 AEs in 26 patients with AEs; 4.9 
AE/patient). Average proportion of the drug-related AEs was about 26% across the pooled studies (56 
DRAEs out of 215 AEs) with the lowest number being reported in the youngest population of <6 years 
of age (12.5% of the patients and 8.6% of the AEs), and the highest in the 003 study (35.9% of the 
patients and 34,6% of AEs). 
When regarding the AE frequencies in the youngest children (< 6 years old; 004 study), proportion of 
the patients with AEs (81.3% of the patients), or number of the AEs per patient in this population (2.7 
AE/patient) did not seems to reveal major differences to the safety profile observed in the older 
population (002 and 003 studies; range: 66.7 – 100% of patients with AEs; 2.3 to 4.9 AEs/patient).   
Common adverse events (AE) and the common AEs which occurred at least 5% more frequently on 
lumasiran compared to placebo are summarised in Tables 39 and 40 respectively.

The most frequently observed AEs in the overall pooled experience (≥10% of patients treated with 
lumasiran) were injection site reaction (24.7%), pyrexia (14.3%), and headache, rhinitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and vomiting (10.4% each). The most frequently observed AEs (≥10% of 
patients) considered related to lumasiran by the Investigator were injection site reactions (24.7%). 
Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity; 1 (1.3%) patient had a severe AE of urosepsis that was 
considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. 
When evaluated by medical concept grouping, injection site reactions were reported in 32.5% of 
patients during the overall pooled experience. 
Injection site reactions appeared to reveal patterns both, in the time-to-start, as well as, in the 
duration. The absolute majority of these events started on the day of the drug administration (Day 0) 
and resolved on the same day without treatment (pain, discomfort, erythema, swelling, discoloration, 
mass, and induration) or within the following 2 days (swelling, induration and mass). None of the 
events, which started at Day 0 lasted longer than 3 days. Some of the AEs, however, emerged with 
delay, i.e. 2 - 43 days after the drug administration and lasted considerably longer (3 – 100 days). In 
the majority of the cases these delayed reactions represented a combination of erythema and pruritus, 
sometimes accompanied with swelling. Overall, pruritus (7 events) occurred always as a delayed AE 
and was always accompanied by other AEs (mostly erythema). Pain and discomfort started always on 
Day 0 and resolved on the same day. Only one case of rash and one case of exfoliation were reported 
in the pooled analysis and had late start and prolonged duration.  
Study 004 
As of 30 June 2020, all (100%) patients reported at least 1 adverse event (AE), all of which were mild 
or moderate in severity. The most common AEs (reported in ≥15% of patients) included pyrexia 
(38.9%), rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting (22.2% each), and injection site 
reaction (16.7%). AEs considered related to lumasiran by the Investigator were injection site reactions 
(ISRs) in 3 (16.7%) patients and headache in 1 (5.6%) patient. All AEs related to lumasiran were mild 
in severity.  
No AEs mapping to the Drug-related Hepatic Disorders Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) were reported. 
There were no clinically relevant changes in haematology or blood chemistry values. No clinically 
relevant elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) were reported and no patients had worst post-baseline 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values >3 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) during the study.  
There were no deaths, severe AEs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, interruption, or 
withdrawal from the study.

Study 005 
As of the data extraction date of 17 August 2020, 5 (41.7%) patients had had an AE. One (8.3%) 
patient had a non-serious AE of injection site haematoma that was mild in severity and was considered 
related to study drug. No other patients have had ISRs or other AEs considered related to study drug. 
There have been no treatment-emergent deaths, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, or AEs 
leading to treatment interruption.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
As of 01 June 2020, no deaths have been reported on the lumasiran treatment. 
Overall number of serious adverse events (SAEs) reported on lumasiran treatment was low. 
In study 001, two patients had SAEs prior to Day 85 (3 mg/kg qM): one had an SAE of vomiting due to 
an upper ureteric stone that was treated with hydration and another patient had an SAE of 
nephrolithiasis that was treated with hyperhydration and lithotripsy.  Two (2) additional patients had 
SAEs after Day 85, which included gastroenteritis in 1 patient (1 mg/kg qM) and abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and pyrexia in another patient (3 mg/kg qM).  
In study 002 one patient developed an SAE of renal colic.  
In study 003, 1 patient treated with 3 mg/kg q3M lumasiran experienced a craniocerebral injury and 
bone (rib) contusion as a result of a road traffic accident, and one had an SAE of urosepsis.  
In study 004 in the ≥20 kg weight group one patient had an SAE of viral infection. 
All events were mild or moderate in intensity and none of them was considered drug related. 
Hepatic events 
As lumasiran is directed to the liver, the frequency of hepatic events was evaluated by performing an 
analysis of AEs mapping to the Drug-related Hepatic Disorders SMQ.   
During the placebo-controlled experience, no patients in either treatment group had AEs mapping to 
the Drug-related Hepatic Disorders SMQ.   
In the overall pooled experience, 3 (4.0%) patients treated with lumasiran had AEs mapping to the 
Drug-related Hepatic Disorders SMQ.  These include 1 patient with an AE of hepatomegaly and 1 
patient with an AE of AST increased reported in the Extension Period of Study 003, and 1 patient with 
an AE of blood bilirubin (indirect bilirubin) increased reported in Study 002. The first two events were 
considered related to lumasiran by the investigators. All 3 events were non-serious, mild in severity, 
and did not result in any change to dose or withdrawal from the study.  All 3 patients continue to 
receive lumasiran.  No hepatic AEs have been reported in Study 004. 
Renal Events 
As patients with PH1 are at risk of recurrent kidney and bladder stones, the frequency of renal and 
urinary disorders other than renal stone events was evaluated.   
During the placebo-controlled experience, 2 (7.7%) patients in the lumasiran group and no patients in 
the placebo group had AEs within the Renal and Urinary Disorders System Organ Class (SOC).  Both 
AEs, polyuria and worsening renal pain, were considered not related to study treatment by the 
Investigator.  Neither event led to a change in study drug administration. 
In the overall pooled experience, no additional patients had renal AEs.

EMA/568312/2020  
Page 97/112 
 
 
 
Laboratory findings 
No apparent changes were observed in haematology, serum chemistry parameters, vital signs, ECG, 
etc.  
Liver function tests and eGFR data were the only laboratory data pooled for analysis in the overall 
pooled experience. 
On laboratory analysis, there have been no major changes in LFT parameters related to lumasiran 
treatment and no apparent pattern of imbalances compared to placebo in the placebo-controlled 
setting.  
Pooled analysis showed mostly mild and transient elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin and ALP in 
10.7%, 4%, 8%, and 4% (worst post-baseline values) in the lumasiran treated, respectively. These 
frequencies were in the same range as those observed in placebo-controlled experience. No cases of 
Hy’s Law were reported. 
Mean and median values for eGFR appeared stable over time in the placebo-controlled experience. No 
apparent changes were detected in the parameter across various studies. 
Safety in special populations 
The maximum age of the tested patients was 60 years. 
Increased systemic levels of lumasiran were observed in the patients younger than 6 years of age. 
Limited safety information in these patients do not raise any age-specific safety concerns. However, 
limited safety data is available in the youngest (< 1 year) population, caution is warranted when using 
lumasiran in this population. 
A dedicated renal impairment study was not conducted for the lumasiran clinical development program 
based on the minor (<26%) role of the kidneys in the excretion of lumasiran. Approximately half of the 
patients treated in the overall pooled experience had mild (37.3%) or moderate (17.3%) renal 
impairment at baseline.   
An analysis of AEs was performed based on baseline eGFR values (≥90 mL/min/1.73m2 [normal renal 
function], 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73m2 [mild renal impairment], or 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2 [moderate 
renal impairment]) and did not reveal any apparent differences in the safety profile between these 
groups. 
Preliminary data in 4 patients with ESRD and on dialysis did not reveal any apparent differences in AE 
profile compared to the overall treated population. Data on plasma glycolate as measured prior to 
dialysis showed relative increase of glycolate on treatment with lumasiran similar to that in patients 
with more preserved or normal renal function (see Table 19 in section 2.4.3). However, absolute 
values of glycolate at baseline and on treatment in these patients was several times higher, indicating 
that safety monitoring is warranted in the patients with severe and ESRD (with or without dialysis), as 
increased glycolate may cause, or worsen metabolic acidosis in these patients. 
No data are available in patients with hepatic impairment. Given the decreased expression of ASGPR in 
these patients, reduced uptake of lumasiran is possible (see sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.4). Decreased 
lumasiran uptake in the liver and increased systemic exposure may be the consequence. While 
increased systemic lumasiran has not been linked to adverse events thus far and do not raise safety 
concerns at this point in time, decreased efficacy due to the reduced lumasiran uptake in the liver 
cannot be excluded and requires monitoring.  
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 98/112 
 
 
 
Influence of intrinsic or extrinsic factors on the lumasiran safety cannot be adequately assessed based 
on the subgroup analyses provided due to small sample sizes, differences in dosing schedules and 
treatment duration. Due to the lack of data, lumasiran should not be used in pregnant or lactating 
women. 
Immunological events 
In the pivotal Study 003 only 1 lumasiran-treated patient (including those initially randomised to 
placebo who received lumasiran during the Extension Period) had a post-dose ADA sample during the 
study that tested positive for ADA.  This patient tested positive for ADA at Month 6 with a low titer of 
1:50. The presence of low-level ADA in this patient did not affect safety, as no AEs have been reported 
in this patient.   
Overall, across all 4 clinical studies in the lumasiran development program, including the patients with 
PH1 and healthy volunteers, a total of 6 of 100 (6%) lumasiran-treated individuals with post-dose ADA 
samples had treatment emergent ADA to lumasiran.   
ADA titers were low (1:50) and transient and ADAs do not seem to influence PK/PD or safety of 
lumasiran.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No DDI studies have been conducted and safety related to DDI interactions in other clinical studies 
have not been studied.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total, only two lumasiran-treated patients discontinued treatment due to the AEs.  
The AEs leading to discontinuation were fatigue and disturbance in attention in one case. Another case 
concerned a 7-year old, who developed a needle phobia because of venepuncture and the guardian 
decided to withdraw the child.  
None of these events was considered drug related. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety assessment of lumasiran is primarily based on the placebo-controlled setting of one pivotal 
study and the pooled analysis of the selected 3 studies (the pivotal study and 2 supportive studies). 
The safety database is small. This is acceptable given the ultra-orphan status of the disease and the 
amount of data presented on 6-month treatment can be considered sufficient for assessment of safety 
in this rare condition with the pre-requisite that further data will be collected and submitted post-
approval.    
Long-term treatment experience (>1 year) with lumasiran is limited and will be collected from the 
studies included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Safety in the population above 65 years of age is 
missing. However, this is not seen as a major deficiency, given the typically young age of the targeted 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 99/112 
 
 
 
population and since the PK, PD, and respectively, safety of lumasiran are predicted to be comparable 
in primary hyperoxaluria type 1 patients across age groups including the elderly.  
Overall, the studied population is reflective of the target population with the exception of very young 
children <2 years of age. Use in this population is included in the RMP as missing information with 
additional data expected from the ongoing trials ALN-GO1-004 and 005 as well as the planned 
observational PASS. 
Limited data with lumasiran in patients with severe/end phase renal impairment have been provided 
and the definition used in the clinical development program to diagnose hepatic impairment is not 
accepted. Therefore treatment with lumasiran in patients with hepatic impairment and end-stage renal 
impairment are considered as missing information in the RMP. These sub-populations will be further 
characterised from the ongoing trials ALN-GO1-005 and the planned observational study. 
Increased levels of glycolate were observed in these patients with end-stage renal impairment 
compared to the overall treated population. Caution when using lumasiran and monitoring of signs of 
metabolic acidosis is warranted in the patients with severe/end-stage renal impairment. Decreased 
expression of ASGPRs is reported in the patients with hepatic impairment, that could potentially lead to 
limited liver uptake and reduced efficacy of lumasiran. Therefore, monitoring of efficacy in the patients 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is required.  
The frequency of total adverse events and AE related to the study drug was higher on lumasiran 
compared to placebo (84.6% vs. 69.2% and 42.3% of patients with 33.3% AEs vs. 7.7% of patients 
with 5.6% AEs) in the pivotal study. Similar results were observed in the pooled data analysis, with 
89.6% patients experiencing AE and 39% experiencing drug-related AE. Eight patients in the overall 
population (001-005 studies) had non-drug related SAEs of mild or moderate intensity and no fatal 
cases were registered on treatment with lumasiran.   
Cross-study comparison of AE frequencies is difficult due to small sample sizes, variable patient 
populations, differences in dosing and especially in exposures. However, no apparent differences were 
spotted. 
Adverse events that were most frequently reported on lumasiran were injection site reactions. Notably, 
these AEs were not reported on placebo treatment and some of the patients on placebo developed 
injection site reactions after they were switched to lumasiran treatment, that suggests clear causal 
relationship of these events to the active drug. Injection site reactions were generally mild, majority 
resolved within two days, and did not result in interruption or discontinuation of treatment. Some of 
the events persisted longer, for a period of up-to several months, but generally resolved without 
treatment, and did not lead to discontinuation of the treatment. 
As the injection sites will be alternated, and the injections are to be administered quarterly, the 
observed events do not raise any safety concerns. 
Another commonly reported AE with higher frequency on lumasiran (15.4 vs 7.7%) was abdominal 
pain. No apparent causal relationship could be established with lumasiran, but neither could this be 
excluded.  
Both injection site reactions and abdominal pain are regarded as ADRs and are included in the product 
information of lumasiran.  
Most of the AEs were mild in severity and none of the AEs in the pooled analysis were severe. Only two 
AEs reported during lumasiran treatment led to treatment discontinuation suggesting good tolerability 
to the drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 100/112 
 
 
 
As lumasiran is directed to liver, liver-related AEs and laboratory parameters were scrutinised. 
Generally, number of liver-related AEs was low (3 patients with one AE each, 4% in pooled data set) 
with no cases reported in the patients younger than 6 years. On laboratory analysis, there have been 
no major changes in LFT parameters related to lumasiran treatment and no pattern of imbalances 
compared to placebo in the placebo-controlled setting.  No cases of Hy’s Law were reported in the 
patients of any age. 
These results do not raise any safety concerns regarding potential impact of lumasiran on liver 
function. However, in light of the limited data available, experience with other similar drugs (e.g. 
givosiran), and preclinical findings suggestive of possible off-target effects of lumasiran, hepatic effects 
are included in  the RMP as a potential important risk to allow further characterisation of the liver-
related effects of the drug in studies that are ongoing or being planned. 
No major findings were reported as AEs related to kidneys or urinary tract, nor were any major 
changes observed in the renal function parameters. Data do not raise any concerns with regard to the 
potential negative effects on renal function.  
No apparent changes were observed in haematology, serum chemistry parameters, vital signs, ECG, 
etc. Influence of intrinsic or extrinsic factors on the lumasiran safety cannot be assessed properly 
based on subgroup analyses due to small sample sizes, differences and exposure/treatment duration.  
Due to the lack of data use of lumasiran in pregnant or lactating women is considered as missing 
information in the RMP. The planned observational study will collect and evaluate information on 
maternal, foetal and infant outcomes following exposure to lumasiran during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding 
Low titers of ADAs were detected in some of the lumasiran-exposed patients, which appeared 
transient. No apparent impacts on safety, PK and PD were observed.  
No DDI studies have been conducted, however this was considered acceptable considering 
physicochemical properties, mechanism of action, PK properties of lumasiran, and data from the in 
vitro studies which suggest that such interactions are unlikely. 
In general, the safety profile of lumasiran is in accordance with the results from non-clinical studies 
and known class effects of siRNA molecules targeted to the liver. The limited safety database will be 
supplemented by information which will be collected through the ongoing clinical studies and the 
planned observational study. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity of primary hyperoxaluria type 1, the 
overall safety profile of lumasiran is considered acceptable. The main safety concerns are injection site 
reactions, abdominal pain, and the increased risk of metabolic acidosis in patients with severe/end-
stage renal impairment, due to the increased levels of glycolate, which are addressed adequately 
through appropriate routine risk minimisation measures. The potential effects of treatment on the liver 
will be further characterised through ongoing and planned post-authorisation studies.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion.  
The new EURD list entry will use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of lumasiran with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers lumasiran to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Oxlumo (lumasiran) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
•  It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Oxlumo is proposed to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This is an inherited metabolic disorder 
which leads to overproduction of oxalate in the liver, with a subsequent formation or renal 
concrements, nephrocalcinosis, deterioration of renal function, and, in late stages, organ oxalosis. The 
type I of the disease comprises about 80% of the total PH population, with the most severe forms 
occurring in this subgroup. There is considerable morbidity associated with the condition, already in 
early years of life, depending on the time of manifestation, which is variable. Data on mortality are not

exactly known, but it can be assumed that the condition is associated with increased mortality overall. 
The disease is very rare with an estimated prevalence of 0.05 in 10,000 people in the European Union. 
Oxlumo treatment is aimed at reducing the production of oxalate in the liver, thus reducing plasma 
levels and urinary excretion of oxalate. It is assumed that the reduction of the oxalate burden will lead 
to a reduced frequency of the clinical events. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current therapy consists of basic measures such as hyperhydration and medicinal products to increase 
solubility of oxalate. This is frequently burdensome with especially young children not able to comply 
fully with the requirements. The only substance used in the condition, but currently not licensed, is 
pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) which, however, is able to reduce the oxalate burden only in a minority of 
patients. Depending on the deterioration of renal function, when ESRD has developed, patients will in 
later stages be treated with dialysis, which frequently has to be applied with a tight schedule. Renal 
transplantation is then also carried out, and patients have also been treated with (pre-emptive) 
combined renal and liver transplantation. All of the three latter procedures are of course burdened with 
increased morbidity and also mortality. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has conducted a small clinical programme owing to the rarity of the disease. The pivotal 
study submitted is study 003, which was randomised, placebo controlled, multi-national and of 6 
months duration with an ongoing open-label extension period with a proposed duration of 54 months. 
The trial recruited 39 patients aged 6-60 which were randomised 2:1 to active and placebo treatment, 
respectively. Patients were having a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PH 1, and a mean 24-hour 
urinary oxalate excretion from the first 2 valid 24-hour urine collections being ≥0.70 
mmol/24hr/1.73m2. The dosing of the study medication was 3 mg/kg BW monthly for the first three 
months, and then 3 mg/kg BW every three months. 
The applicant has also submitted a study in patients under the age of 6 (study 004), which is a non-
randomised study with a proposed study duration of 60 months, and a primary evaluation for efficacy 
at 6 months. This study is reported with an interim report for the efficacy results.  
Both studies taken together support the treatment of patients of all ages. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The favourable effects of the compound are based on the surrogate parameter of reducing the oxalate 
burden in the body, with a reduction of oxalate in plasma and its excretion in urine. The evaluation of 
the urine excretion was based on 24-hour urine collections with the endpoints “24-hour urinary oxalate 
corrected for body surface area (BSA)”, which was the primary endpoint (evaluated as percent change 
from baseline for the primary analysis, and as absolute change as secondary endpoint),  “24-hour 
urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio” (to account for the dilution status of the urine; secondary endpoint), 
with both being evaluated as relative and absolute changes, and the change in plasma oxalate. Further 
secondary endpoints comprise the proportion of patients with a 24-hour urinary oxalate level at or 
below 1.5xULN, and at or below ULN at month 6.  
In the pivotal study 003, all these parameters demonstrated statistically significant changes, with a 
reduction in24-hour urinary oxalate excretion of 65.4% (compared to 11.8 for placebo treated 
patients).  In addition 52% and 84% of lumasiran treated patients achieved respectively normal or

near normal levels of 24 hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA (≤1.5×ULN). In contrast no placebo 
treated patient had normal or near normal levels of urinary oxalate excretion at month 6. Of note, the 
secondary endpoints mentioned were included into a hierarchical testing strategy and are thus under 
full type-I error control. 
These effects were highly consistent across all subgroups analysed (age, weight, sex, geographic 
region etc.). 
The trial in young children evaluated only two of the secondary endpoints and over a shorter period. 
However, these also indicated favourable changes in this population similar to the magnitude seen in 
the adult population. Paediatric patients achieved a reduction of 72.0% in spot urinary oxalate: 
creatinine ratio from baseline (averaged over months 3 through month 6). Furthermore, nine patients 
achieved near normalisation (≤1.5×ULN), including 1 patient who achieved normalisation ((≤ULN), at 
month 6 in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio. The 6 months treatment data provided for 18 
patients was considered sufficient to draw conclusions on efficacy in this age group. The CHMP 
therefore concluded that the claim of treating patients of all age ranges was appropriately 
substantiated.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The demonstration of efficacy, as described above, is currently based on surrogate parameters only. 
Although high biological plausibility can be attributed to the hypothesis underlying the use of the 
surrogates, the prognostic value of these, in the context of medical treatment of the condition, is not 
available, and therefore the surrogate parameters have to be considered to be non-validated. The 
applicant has tried to support the prognostic value of oxalate reduction with data on patients with liver 
transplantation and pyridoxine treatment, which indicate improvement of the condition in terms of 
clinical events (e.g. renal stones). However, these data are based on published literature case reports 
only. 
The results of the trial have also included secondary and exploratory endpoints with the evaluation of 
the occurrence of renal stone events, the development of nephrocalcinosis (diagnosed by ultrasound), 
and changes in renal function as measured by eGFR. However, none of these parameters has indicated 
any improvement in the actively treated group as compared to the placebo group. The failure to 
demonstrate a clinical benefit is largely attributable to the short (controlled) observation period, as well 
as the small sample size. Post hoc analysis of 1-year data of the placebo - lumasiran vs. lumasiran – 
lumasiran group do indeed suggest some improvement in the renal events/ultrasound findings on 
active treatment. However, longer treatment and observation data are required to confirm this finding. 
No efficacy data are available for patients above the age of 65, however, majority of PH1 patients are 
younger than 65. Further, PK and PD analyses across various ages suggest similar effects. Thus, 
extrapolation of effects to this population appears justified. 
Data from the trial in the small children under the age of 6 is limited. This included only 2 children 
below the age of 1 and 4 patients were aged less 2 years. The treatment of patients in the very young 
population is therefore burdened with additional uncertainties. Further data in this population will be 
collected post-marketing. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The majority of the patients reported at least 1 AE on lumasiran. The proportion of patients with AEs 
was higher on lumasiran treatment than with placebo.  
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 108/112 
 
 
 
Most frequently reported AEs (frequency ≥10%) were AEs grouped under the SMQ terms injection site 
reactions and abdominal pain. Injection site reactions were the most prominent AEs and were reported 
only on lumasiran treatment. Some of the AEs occurred after repeated treatment, on the day of drug 
administration, or as delayed reactions, whereby the delayed reaction could last several months. AEs 
related to abdominal pain were also reported more frequently on lumasiran than on placebo (15.4 vs 
7.7%).  
Only mild and moderate AEs were reported including the SAEs and none of the SAEs were considered 
as drug related.  
Hepatic and renal effects are the acknowledged potential risks of siRNAs. AEs related to hepatic 
disorders and elevations in LFT were reported on lumasiran, however, without marked differences to 
the placebo group, and no apparent changes in the renal parameter were observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Limitations of the safety database include small sized, variable population, and limited and variable 
exposure across trials. Patients across the broad age range were treated with different dosing 
schedules and for variable treatment duration, mostly for up-to 12 months. Data on long-term safety is 
limited to a small number of > 6 years old patients with <1 year exposure. Such variability combined 
with small sample size and short observation times creates uncertainties in interpretation of safety 
profile.  
For the youngest, most vulnerable (i.e. <2 years old) population and in the patients with severe/end-
stage renal impairment, data are very limited. Experience of treatment with lumasiran in patients with 
hepatic impairment (of any degree) is absent.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
With regard to oxalate reduction, the near normalisation or full normalisation of the urinary oxalate 
excretion is seen as the most clinically relevant parameter. Although still considered a surrogate, the 
biological plausibility that normalisation of the oxalate burden would lead to a reduced clinical 
manifestation of the disease appears convincing.  
The reduction of oxalate as demonstrated in the study 003 is a strong effect induced by the treatment, 
which has shown consistency across different disease severities, and in different patient subgroups 
(according to age, different regions etc). A clinical benefit, e.g. with regard to renal events, has not 
been demonstrated, which is likely due to the short placebo-controlled treatment phase of 6 months 
and the small sample size in this orphan indication. In fact, renal stone events were even occurring at 
a numerically slightly higher rate in actively treated patients but the ultrasound-based evaluations of 
the progression of nephrocalcinosis (in those patients with pre-existing nephrocalcinosis) showed some 
(numerical) improvements compared to placebo. However, the assumption that in patients with near 
normal levels of oxalate excretion (achieved by 84%), or even full normalisation of oxalate excretion 
(achieved by 52%), a further disease progression with regard to deterioration of renal function, 
development of nephrocalcinosis, renal stone events, and finally ESRD can be halted or ameliorated 
appears reasonable. Also, the data of post hoc analysis of renal events over 1 year, which showed 
trends towards improvement in these events on lumasiran treatment are supportive in this respect. 
Adverse events were more frequently reported in the lumasiran treatment group compared to placebo. 
However, most of the adverse events were mild.  
The compound, being an RNA-based injectable, is “naturally” bound to cause fear of injection, and 
injection pain, which is considered especially relevant for the intended population, mainly being in the 
paediatric age range. However, high level of compliance and low number of drop outs from the studies, 
are reassuring regarding compliance in clinical reality. In addition, about 33% of the patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/568312/2020  
Page 110/112 
 
 
 
 
experienced injection site reactions. The relevance of the injection site reactions is alleviated with the 
schedule of administration, which is one injection every three months only, and alternating sites of 
administration. The evaluation of adverse events has also revealed that abdominal pain occurs 
relatively frequently in connection with the injection. Although no causal relationship to lumasiran 
could be established, these AEs were qualified as ADRs of lumasiran. The severity of the abdominal 
pain was mild in most cases, duration transient, and the impact on the further treatment appears to be 
low.  
The potential for ADA formation appears to be low, and there is currently no indication that ADA 
formation would influence efficacy or safety of the compound.  
Hepatic events are an important potential risk and may be a class effect of liver-targeting siRNA 
products. Events suggestive of lumasiran effects on liver were infrequent. Further evaluation of the 
possible causal relationship and of clinical relevance of these events is required. No signs of possible 
negative impact on renal function could be detected based on the available data set.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical studies performed have demonstrated strong effects with regard to reduction of oxalate 
production in the body, measured as the oxalate “load” in plasma and urine, and have shown that 
about half of the patients can achieve normal levels of oxalate, and more than 80% can achieve near 
normal levels. Due to the strong biological plausibility, the expectation that the favourable effects 
demonstrated on the surrogate parameters can translate into a reduced progression of the disease is 
fully supported. The expected reduction of clinical events, and prevention of ESRD is considered to be 
of high clinical relevance.  
The observed adverse reactions were generally mild in nature and the most commonly reported ADR of 
injection site reaction relates to the mode of administration of lumasiran. Although these reactions 
were relatively frequent, the schedule of administration is suitable to alleviate the burden to patients.  
Overall, the observed favourable effects are considered to outweigh the unfavourable effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Oxlumo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Oxlumo is favourable in the following indication: 
treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in all age groups. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Assessment report

Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that lumasiran is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

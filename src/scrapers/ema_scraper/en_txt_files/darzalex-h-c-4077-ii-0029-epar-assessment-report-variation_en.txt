Multiple myeloma, a malignant disorder of the plasma cells characterized by uncontrolled and progressive 
proliferation of a plasma cell clone, is estimated to represent 0.8% of all cancers worldwide. The proliferation 
of myeloma cells causes displacement of normal bone marrow haematopoietic precursors and the 
overproduction of M-proteins. Characteristic hallmarks of multiple myeloma include osteolytic lesions, 
anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency or failure, and 
neurological complications. 
While OS rates for multiple myeloma have improved significantly over the last decade due to the availability 
of effective new therapies, it remains an incurable disease. Based on the revised International Staging 
System (R-ISS), the 5-year OS is 82% for R-ISS stage I, 62% for R-ISS stage II and 40% for R-ISS stage 
III. Median OS time was not reached for patients with R-ISS stage I and was of 83 and 43 months for R-ISS 
stage II and R-ISS stage III patients, respectively1. Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma are 
typically categorized into 2 subpopulations defined by their age, comorbidity and suitability for intensive 
treatment. For patients who are considered fit, an induction regimen followed by high-dose chemotherapy 
(HDT) and ASCT is considered the standard of care according to both US (National Comprehensive Cancer 
1 Palumbo A,  Avet-Loiseau H,  Oliva S et al. Revised international staging system for multiple myeloma: a report from 
International Myeloma Working Group. J Clin Oncol 2015; 33: 2863–2869.

Network [NCCN]) and European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO]) guidelines, and this therapeutic 
approach is customarily limited to younger patients. For patients considered ineligible for HDT and ASCT due 
to their age, presence of comorbidities, and/or physical status, the treatment approach often favours longer, 
less intensive/toxic treatments.  
The coexistence of different tumor subclones at baseline displaying different drug sensitivities ultimately 
contributes to the development of drug resistance and disease progression (Barlogie 2014). Because 
combination regimens comprised of agents with non-overlapping and synergistic mechanisms of action 
target multiple pathways in multiple myeloma cells, they are more likely to overcome intratumoral clonal 
heterogeneity than single agent or doublet approaches. Thus, triple or quadruple drug regimens have 
become standard of care for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (Kumar 2018; Moreau 2017). 
Elderly patients are generally not considered eligible for HDT and ASCT due to increased comorbidities which 
increase the risk of complications, morbidity and mortality. This is particularly notable as multiple myeloma 
is disproportionately detected in older adults, the majority of whom are older than 65 years at the time of 
diagnosis (median age at diagnosis: 72 years). Furthermore, comorbidities such as renal dysfunction are 
present at initial diagnosis in a significant proportion of patients with multiple myeloma (12% to 30%). 
Daratumumab is a targeted immunotherapy that binds with high affinity to tumor cells that overexpress 
CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein. Combining daratumumab with Rd in patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma who are not eligible for ASCT is supported by the approved use of Rd for this indication as 
well as the approved use of DRd in the relapsed/refractory setting.  
The current submission is supported by the Phase 3 study MMY3008 where DRd was compared to Rd for the 
treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT. 
The following new indication is proposed: 
DARZALEX is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Absorption  data  are  not  available  because  all  studies  in  this  and  prior  submissions  administered 
daratumumab as an IV infusion. 
Distribution 
The mean±SD volume of distribution in subjects who received 16 mg/kg was 90.19±43.40 mL/kg after the 
first dose and 59.51±54.68 mL/kg following repeat dosing (Study GEN501); Japanese subjects receiving 16 
mg/kg exhibited a similar volume of distribution of 57.97±3.29 mL/kg (Study MMY1002). As described by 
the monotherapy PPK model, the estimate for the central volume of distribution is 56.98±18.07 mL/kg. 
Overall, these data suggest that daratumumab is primarily localized to the vascular system with limited 
extravascular tissue distribution 
Elimination 
As shown previously in the monotherapy studies, daratumumab clearance decreased with increasing dose 
and with multiple doses. After the first infusion, mean clearance decreased from 1.06 mL/h/kg in the 2 
mg/kg group to 0.29 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg group; after repeat dosing, clearance decreased from 0.59 
mL/h/kg (n=1) in the 2 mg/kg group to 0.16 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg group. Following the first 
administration at the approved dose of 16 mg/kg, clearance was 0.42±0.42 mL/h/kg and the t1/2 was 
216±104 hours (9.0±4.3 days). Following repeated administration of 16 mg/kg, daratumumab clearance 
decreased to 0.30±0.12 mL/h/kg and t1/2 increased to 255±216 hours (10.6±9.0 days).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Following the first administration of daratumumab ranging from 0.005 to 24 mg/kg, Cmax increased in an 
approximately  dose-proportional  manner  for  doses  ≥1  mg/kg.  After  repeat  dosing,  Cmax  increased  in  a 
greater  than  dose-proportional  manner.  AUC  also  increased  in  a  greater  than dose-proportional  manner 
after both the first and last dose. Consistent with the monotherapy data, Cmax following the first infusion 
increased in approximate proportion to the increasing daratumumab dose of 2 to 16 mg/kg daratumumab 
and AUClast increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner after the first dose. These findings are 
consistent with target-mediated clearance. 
As reported for monotherapy, mean clearance following the first dose decreased with increasing dose, from 
1.50±0.96 mL/h/kg in the 1 mg/kg cohort to 0.29±0.15 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg cohort. This trend for 
decreasing  clearance  with  increased  dose  was  also  evident  following  repeat  dosing,  from  6.72±6.18 
mL/h/kg  in  the  0.5  mg/kg  cohort  to  0.16±0.08  mL/h/kg  in  the  24  mg/kg  cohort.  Following  the  first 
administration at the approved dose of 16 mg/kg, clearance was 0.32±0.13 mL/h/kg and 0.10 mL/h/kg in 
the 1 subject with the parameter estimated after repeat dosing. 
Time Dependency 
Clearance of daratumumab also decreased with multiple doses in the monotherapy studies: after the first 
infusion, mean clearance decreased from 1.06 mL/h/kg in the 2 mg/kg group to 0.29 mL/h/kg in the 24 
mg/kg group; after the last infusion, mean clearance decreased from 0.59 mL/h/kg in the 2 mg/kg group to 
0.16 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg group. Following the first administration at the approved dose of 16 mg/kg, 
clearance  was  0.32±0.13  mL/h/kg  (mean±SD)  and  0.10  mL/h/kg  in  the  1  subject  with  the  parameter 
estimated after repeat dosing.  
Comparison of DRd Combination in MMY3008 and Previous Monotherapy and Combination Therapies 
Comparison of Cmax (Cycle 1 Day 1) and Ctrough during every-2-week (Cycle 6 Day 1) and every-4-week 
(Cycle 12 Day 1) dosing was made between the DRd dose regimen from Study MMY3008 (once weekly for 
8  weeks,  every  2  weeks  for  16  weeks,  every  4  weeks  thereafter)  and  similar  dose  regimens  from  the 
monotherapy  Study  MMY2002  and  combination  therapy  Studies  GEN503,  MMY1001,  and  MMY3003. 
Concentrations after administration of the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1) were similar across monotherapy and 
combination  therapies.  The  maximal  trough  concentrations  of  daratumumab  were  also  similar  across 
studies. 
Special populations 
No special population studies for hepatic or renal dysfunction with daratumumab have been presented in this 
application.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No dedicated clinical drug-drug interaction studies were presented. Since there is no overlapping pathway of 
elimination,  no  interactions  are  expected  between  daratumumab  and  small-molecule  drugs  including 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone. This is considered acceptable.  
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A pop-PK model of daratumumab was used to describe the PK characteristics of daratumumab following IV 
administration  in  combination  with  Rd  and  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  covariates  on  the  exposure  of 
daratumumab  in  subjects  with  newly  diagnosed  MM  who  are  ineligible  for  ASCT.  In  addition,  the  PK  of 
daratumumab combined with Rd (D-Rd) was compared with that of daratumumab monotherapy studies and 
the previous combination therapy studies. 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 9/65 
 
  
  
  
The  pop-PK  analysis  included  combined  data  from  a  Phase  3  study  (MMY3008)  and  a  Phase  1/2  study 
(GEN503).  GEN503  data  were  pooled  into  the  analysis  dataset  to  improve  the  PK  parameter  estimates 
because Study GEN503 included a wider dose range (2 to 16 mg/kg) and a more intensive PK sampling 
scheme.  Both  Studies  MMY3008  and  GEN503  shared  the  same  background  therapy  and  similar 
concentration-time profiles were observed in these 2 studies. 
Effects of Covariates 
Body Weight: When daratumumab was administered on a mg/kg basis, no clinically important differences 
(ie, <20%) in the exposure to daratumumab were observed in subjects with a low body weight (<65 kg, 
n=102) or high body weight (≥85 kg, n=92) compared to those with a normal body weight (65 to 85 kg, 
n=161). 
Age: No clinically important influence of age on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. There was a 
9% decrease in exposure to daratumumab in older subjects (age ≥75 years, n=153) compared to younger 
subjects (age <75 years, n=202). 
Sex: No clinically important influence of sex on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The exposure 
to daratumumab in males was approximately 1% lower than that in females (n=173). 
Race:  Because  92%  of  subjects  were  White  and  there  were  only  limited  sample  sizes  in  other  race 
categories, the effect of race was evaluated as White (n=325) and Non-white (n=30). No clinically important 
influence of race on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The exposure to daratumumab in White 
subjects was approximately 8% higher than in Non-white subjects. 
Region: Approximately 28% of subjects were North American. The effect of region was evaluated in North 
America (n=98) and other regions (n=257). No clinically important influence of region on the exposure to 
daratumumab was observed. The exposure to daratumumab in North American subjects was approximately 
6% lower than that in subjects from other regions. 
Renal  Impairment:  The  effect  of  renal  impairment  was  evaluated  in  categories  of  normal  renal  function 
(creatinine clearance [CRCL] ≥90 mL/min, n=60), mild renal impairment (60≤ CRCL <90 mL/min, n=141), 
moderate  renal  impairment  (30≤  CRCL  <60  mL/min,  n=147),  and  severe  renal  impairment  (CRCL  <30 
mL/min; n=7). No clinically important differences (≤13%) in the exposure to daratumumab were observed 
between subjects with renal impairment and those with normal renal function. 
Hepatic Impairment: No subjects had severe hepatic impairment (TB >3× upper limit of normal [ULN] and 
any AST). As only 1 subject had moderate hepatic impairment (TB >1.5× to 3.0× ULN, as defined using the 
National Cancer Institute criteria of hepatic dysfunction), this subject was combined with subjects with mild 
hepatic impairment (TB 1.0× to 1.5× ULN or AST >ULN) in this analysis. The effect of hepatic impairment 
was  evaluated  in  categories  of  normal  hepatic  function  (TB  and  AST  ≤ULN,  n=323)  and  mild/moderate 
hepatic  impairment  (n=31).  The  exposures  to  daratumumab  in  subjects  with  mild/moderate  hepatic 
impairment  were  similar  to  those  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  and  were  consistent  with  the 
findings  based  on  previous  studies.  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab 
(-3%) were observed between subjects with hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function as 
found in the monotherapy or the previous combination therapy study populations. 
Baseline  Albumin:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between  subjects  with  abnormal  albumin  and  those  with  normal  albumin  level.  The  exposure  to 
daratumumab  was  6%  lower  in  subjects  with  abnormal  albumin  level  (<35  g/L;  n=142)  compared  with 
subjects who had normal albumin level (≥35 g/L; n=213). 
Type  of  Myeloma:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between  subjects  with  IgG  myeloma  and  non-IgG  myeloma.  The  exposure  to  daratumumab  was 
approximately  18%  lower  in  subjects  with  IgG  myeloma  (n=232)  compared  with  subjects  with  non-IgG 
myeloma (n=123), consistent with previous study results. 
ECOG Score:  No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab (≤7%) were observed 
between subjects with ECOG scores of 1 (n=170) or ≥2 (n=59) and those with ECOG scores of 0 (n=126). 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019

Immunogenicity:  All  immunogenicity-evaluable  subjects  (n=338)  in  the  PPK  analysis  were  negative  for 
anti-daratumumab antibodies. Immunogenicity-evaluable subjects were defined as subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of daratumumab and had at least 1 postinfusion sample for detection of anti-daratumumab 
antibodies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No new data on the mechanism of action has been presented in this application. 
Daratumumab is a human IgG mAb that binds with high affinity to CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein 
expressed  on  tumor  cells,  and  induces  tumor  cell  death  through  multiple  mechanisms  of  action.  These 
mechanisms  of  action  include  several  immune-mediated  activities,  including  complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and direct 
cytotoxicity by induction of apoptosis by Fc gamma receptor mediated crosslinking of tumor-bound mAbs 
(Overdijk 2016). Translational biomarker studies of samples from subjects treated with daratumumab in 
Phase  1  and  Phase  2  studies  (Studies  GEN501  and  MMY2002,  respectively)  have  revealed  previously 
unknown immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab (Krejcik 2016). Daratumumab leads to the rapid and 
sustained  elimination  of  highly  immunosuppressive  subsets  of  CD38+  regulatory  T  cells,  CD38+ 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and CD38+ regulatory B cells (Krejcik 2016). The elimination of these 
immunosuppressive  cells,  modulation  of  CD38  enzymatic  activity,  and  destruction  of  the  malignant 
myeloma  cells  are  thought  to  lead  to  the  clonal  expansion  of  CD8+  and  CD4+  T  cells  (Chiu  2016). 
Altogether, daratumumab’s converging mechanisms of actions are hypothesized to synergistically lead to 
the deep responses observed in patients.  
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Exploratory Exposure-response Analysis 
Exposure-response (E-R) relationships were investigated based on the simulated daratumumab exposure 
metric data from Study MMY3008 using the pop-PK model. Since all subjects in the D-Rd group received the 
recommended dose of 16 mg/kg, there is limited exposure variation for daratumumab and, therefore, only 
exploratory and graphic E-R analyses were performed for selected efficacy endpoints and AEs. 
Progression-free Survival 
An apparent maximal effect (Emax) relationship was observed between the relative hazard of progression or 
death and daratumumab systemic exposures. The relative hazard for progression or death decreased rapidly 
with increasing daratumumab systemic exposure. When the first peak exposures reached the first quartile 
(Q1) (232 μg/mL), the risk (compared to the control Rd group) was reduced by approximate 50% for PFS, 
indicating that the maximum effect on PFS had been attained for the majority of the subjects at the 16 
mg/kg dose with an acceptable safety profile.

Figure 1: Relative Hazard of PFS at Different Predicted Exposures 
The  improvement  in  PFS  was  observed  in  the  majority  of  the  daratumumab-treated  subjects  (exposure 
quartiles: Q2-Q4, 75%). In the case-control analysis, the improvement of PFS was apparent in the Q1 DRd 
match group compared with the Q1 Rd match group for both peak and trough concentrations after the first 
dose. In addition, the PFS improvement in the Q1 group according to the peak and trough concentration 
following the first dose appeared comparable to that in the Q2-Q4 groups. The results suggest that, despite 
trough concentrations following the first dose being close to 0 in Q1 subjects, the PFS improvement in those 
subjects were similar to that in the Q2-Q4 groups.

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Matched Subgroups (PFS) 
In summary, the E-R analysis on efficacy data suggests that the maximum drug effect on PFS had been 
attained for the majority of the subjects at the studied 16 mg/kg dose and it appears that subjects in the DRd 
arm of Study MMY3008 benefited from the treatment with daratumumab evidenced by a lower relative risk 
of disease progression/death across the studied concentration range compared with subjects in the Rd arm. 
Selected Adverse Events 
There  was  no  apparent  E-R  relationship  between  Cpeak,  1st  and  IRR,  and  between  Cpeak  max  and 
thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and infections within the studied drug concentration 
range. The results were consistent with the clinical analysis where the safety profile is similar between the 
D-Rd and the Rd arms. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
No  patients  developed  anti-daratumumab  antibodies  during  Study  MMY3008.  This  confirms  previous 
findings that the risk of immunogenicity for daratumumab is low.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  daratumumab  used  as  monotherapy  is  well  established.  The  PK  profile  for 
daratumumab  when  given  in  combination  treatment  seems  to  show  a  similar  pattern  to  what  has  been 
observed in in the monotherapy studies. Clinical pharmacology data for the combination treatment with VMP 
derive  from  two  clinical  studies  (MMY3007  and  MMY1001)  with  a  total  of  353  patients  evaluable  for  PK 
analyses.  Additionally,  a  pop-PK  analysis  from  Study  MMY3008  contributes  data.  The  applied  analytical 
methods for both the statistical analyses and the PK data analysis seem appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetics  
Overall, there is no new data with regards to the basic pharmacokinetic properties including absorption, 
distribution,  metabolism,  elimination  and  excretion.  It  is  supported  that  as  a  mAb,  the  distribution  of 
daratumumab is primarily localised to the vascular system, and the dose-dependent elimination (nonlinear 
characteristics) is consistent with target-mediated elimination (where clearance decreases as a function of 
dose).   
The typical pharmacokinetic profile shows similar pattern to what has been observed in in the monotherapy 
studies. Steady state is reached after approximately 21 weeks (≈5 months) and mean trough concentrations 
were  375-615  μg/mL.  After  approximately  1  year,  the  mean  trough  concentrations  dropped  to 
approximately  250-525  μg/mL.  The  MAH  informs  that  target  saturation  >90%  is  maintained  at  trough 
concentrations in the majority (>99%) of the patients following the every 4 week dose regimen. 
A  logistic  regression  analysis  of  overall  response  rate  and  predicted  maximal  pre-infusion  (trough) 
daratumumab concentration showed by the initial (monotherapy) PK analysis, that maximal response rate 
was obtained with daratumumab concentrations around 300 µg/mL and no additional effect was obtained 
)  was 
with  higher  concentrations.  The  MAH  calculated  that  90%  of  the  maximal  effect  on  ORR  (
achieved when Cpre-infusion,max was 274 µg/mL. From the data presented, it appears that mean trough 
concentrations are well above the thresholds of 274 µg/mL and 300 µg/mL during the initial 4 weeks’ dosing 
period the first 52 weeks but thereafter, pre-infusion values appear to be slightly lower than the thresholds. 
Mean concentrations are however well above both thresholds at all time points.    Thus, when comparing 
results  from  the  present  combination  studies  (MMY3007  and  MMY1001)  with  the  results  from  the 
monotherapy studies, similar mean concentrations after first dose and similar pattern for the subsequent 
cycles  are  observed.  Therefore,  it  is  concluded that  the  PK  data  from  the  two  studies  including  patients 
treated with the D-VMP combination are comparable with the data reported from the monotherapy studies. 
This supports the assumption (based on molecular structures of the agents) that there are no interactions 
with the combination treatment, and it justifies the use of PK-data from the previous registration studies 
with daratumumab.  
The  pop-PK  analysis  was  based  on  1,635  PK  samples  from  353  PK-evaluable  patients  (all  receiving 
daratumumab at 16 mg/kg). Initially, the MAH was asked to to discuss the goodness of fit for the updated 
population PK as several samples are clustered away from the correlation regression line of the population 
predictions and the conditional weighted residuals showed samples which lie outside the +/- 5 limits. Eta 
shrinkage was high for V1 and the visual predictive checks showed that the model poorly captured the data 
variability. In their response, the MAH agreed that the shrinkage on V1 was fairly high (56%), however, the 
issue will not be pursued. Thus overall, the goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots presented showed an acceptable 
symmetrical distribution around the unity line, supporting that the applied model is appropriate and the 
VPCs for the final updated PPK model are considered acceptable and do not indicate any misspecifications.  
The impact of covariate effects was analysed using a forest-plot, showing the relative change to reference 
individual of each selected covariate on pre-infusion levels (trough concentrations). A change greater than 
±20%  is  considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  impact  of  severe  renal  impairment  versus  normal  renal 
function  patients  leads  to  change  between  -30%  and  9%  change  in  maximal  trough  concentrations  and 
patients with higher body-weight (85kg) may show an increase in trough concentrations between 11-27% 
compared  to  a  65  kg  subject.  Based  on  these  results,  the  impact  of  high  body  weight  and  severe  renal 
impairment on trough concentration levels might be of relevance. The MAH was asked to discuss this issue 
in  more  detail.  Based  on  their  response,  it  was  concluded  that  the  hazard  ratio  analysis  in  over-weight 
patients demonstrates a slight trend in favour of DRd but the 95% CI includes the unity, demonstrating the 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 14/65 
 
  
  
  
lack of significant effect in this sub-group of population. However, these results seems contradictory with the 
E-R  analysis  previously  developed,  where  relative  hazard  ratio  was  related  to  maximal  through 
concentrations, showing that higher through concentrations would lead to a less hazard ratio. The issue will 
not be pursued. Regarding the patients with severe renal impairment, it is acknowledged that low number of 
patients with severe renal impairment where recruited in the study and the clinical impact observed in the 
forest plot could be considered as preliminary. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No new data related to mechanism of action or QTc evaluation are presented. This is overall acceptable. No 
patients developed anti-daratumumab antibodies, which is assuring.  
It is reassuring that no patients developed anti-daratumumab antibodies during the present Study 
MMY3008. This confirms previous findings that the risk of immunogenicity for daratumumab is low. The 
present combination treatment with D-Rd is not expected to increase the risk of immunogenicity. However, 
in relation to a Post-Authorisation Measure regarding assay and ADA detection, several concerns regard the 
adequacy of the assay emerged. The Applicant is encouraged to continue immunogenicity surveillance in 
coming studies. Especially longer-term exposure could add valuable information to better understand ADA 
response kinetics by capturing more persistent responses, if any, and to rule out impact on efficacy. The 
impact of ADA on efficacy will be further investigated in samples from previous studies using a highly 
sensitive assay.   
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  new  analyses  presented  do  not  change  the  current  knowledge  on  PK/PD  and  immunogenicity  of 
daratumumab.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose-response studies were conducted.  
In study MMY3008, daratumumab was administered at 16 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks (for 8 doses), every 2 
weeks for 16 weeks (for 8 doses), then every 4 weeks thereafter, which is the approved dose regimen of 
daratumumab as monotherapy and in combination therapy with Rd in subjects with RRMM.  
2.4.2.  Main study

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints 
The primary endpoint is PFS, which is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to either 
progressive disease, or death, whichever occurs first. PFS was determined by the use of a validated 
computer algorithm that combines laboratory results (eg, monoclonal [M]-protein level) and applicable 
imaging and generates the outcome according to IMWG criteria (Durie 2006, Rajkumar 2011). Further, 
sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed, including those using investigator-determined response.  
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
- Time to disease progression (TTP): is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
first documented evidence of PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria. For subjects who have not progressed, 
data will be censored at the date of the disease evaluation before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma 
therapy. 
- CR rate, defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR, as defined: 
•  Negative immunofixation of serum and urine, and 
•  Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 18/65 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
•  <5% plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow 
• 
For  those  subjects  with  negative  serum  M-protein  quantitation  by  electrophoresis  (SPEP)  and 
suspected daratumumab interference on immunofixation, a reflex assay using anti-idiotypeantibody 
will  be  utilized  to  confirm daratumumab  interference  and  rule  out  false  positive  immunofixation. 
Patients who have confirmed daratumumab interference, but meet all other clinical criteria for CR or 
sCR, will be considered CR/sCR. 
- MRD negativity rate, defined as the proportion of subjects assessed as MRD negative, at any timepoint 
after the date of randomization. 
- Progression-free Survival on Next line of Therapy (PFS2), defined as the time from randomization 
to progression on the next line of treatment or death, whichever comes first. Disease progression will be 
based on investigator judgment. For those subjects who are still alive and not yet progressed on the next line 
of treatment, they will be censored on the last date of follow-up. 
- Overall survival (OS), measured from the date of randomization to the date of the subject’s death. If the 
subject is alive or the vital status is unknown, then the subject’s data will be censored at the date the subject 
was last known to be alive. 
- Time to next treatment, defined as the time from randomization to the start of the next-line treatment. 
- sCR rate, defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR in addition to having a normal free light chain 
(FLC) ratio and an absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, 
2-4 color flow cytometry 
- Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve PR or better, according 
to the IMWG criteria, during or after the study treatment. 
- Proportion of subjects who achieve VGPR or better, defined as the proportion of subjects achieving 
VGPR and CR (including sCR) according to the IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment at the time 
of data cutoff. 
- Time to response, defined as the time between the randomization and the first efficacy evaluation that 
the subject has met all criteria for PR or better. For subjects without response, data will be censored either 
at the date of progressive disease or, in the absence of progressive disease, at the last disease evaluation 
before the start of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. 
- Duration of response, calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to 
the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the IMWG criteria. For subjects 
who have not progressed, data will be censored at the last disease evaluation before the start of any 
subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. 
- To evaluate clinical efficacy of DRd in high risk molecular subgroups compared to Rd alone. 
- To evaluate the impact of DRd compared to Rd on patient-reported perception of global health. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that the median PFS for Rd arm is approximately 
24 months and the addition of daratumumab would reduce the risk of the disease progression or death by 
25%, ie, assuming the hazard ratio (DRd vs Rd) of 0.75, a total of 390 PFS events is needed to achieve a 
power of 80% to detect this hazard ratio with a log-rank test (two-sided alpha is 0.05).  
With a 21-month accrual period and an additional 24-month follow-up, the total sample size needed for the 
study is approximately 730 (365/arm) subjects.  
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 19/65 
 
  
  
  
 
The sample size calculation has taken into consideration an annual dropout rate of 5%, and the planned 
interim efficacy analysis used the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. PFS and responses were derived 
using the same validated computer algorithm as used in previous daratumumab studies. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either DRd or Rd stratified by International Staging 
System (ISS, I vs II vs III), region (North America vs Other), and age (<75 vs ≥75). 
Blinding (masking) 
As this is an open study, blinding procedures are not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Long-term survival follow-up was to continue until 330 deaths had been observed or 7 years after the last 
subject  was  randomized,  whichever  came  first.  The  study  was  to  achieve  approximately  80%  power  to 
detect  a  27%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  (hazard  ratio  [HR]=0.73)  with  a  log-rank  test  (two-sided 
alpha=0.05). 
The primary endpoint of Progression-free survival (PFS) and responses were derived using the validated 
computer algorithm as used in previous daratumumab studies. For PFS, the primary analysis was to consist 
of a stratified log rank test for the comparison of the PFS distribution between the 2 treatment arms. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was to be used to estimate the distribution of overall PFS for each treatment. The 
treatment effect (hazard ratio) and its two-sided 95% confidence intervals were to be estimated using a 
stratified  Cox  regression  model  with  treatment  as  the  sole  explanatory  variable.  Other  time-to-event 
efficacy endpoints, including TTP, PFS2, OS, and time to subsequent anti-myeloma treatment, were to be 
analysed similarly. 
Comparison between the 2 treatment arms of overall response rates, VGPR or better rate, CR or better rate, 
MRD negativity rate, and other binary endpoints were to be conducted using the stratified Cox regression 
model  with  treatment  as the  sole explanatory  variable  and  stratified  with  ISS staging  (I, II,  III),  region 
(North America vs. Other), and age (<75 years vs. ≥75 years) as randomized. Other time-to-event efficacy 
endpoints, including TTP, PFS2, OS, and time to subsequent anti myeloma treatment, were to be analysed 
similarly. Duration of response were to be analysed descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
For overall survival, the final analysis will occur after 330 deaths have been observed. Earlier analyses, in 
which overall survival are analyzed will be considered as interim analyses, and the stopping boundary will be 
determined  using  the  observed  number  of  deaths  at  the  time  of  the  analyses  and  a  modified  linear 
alpha-spending function per the Lan-DeMets method. At the interim PFS analysis (234 PFS events), a total 
alpha of 0.0001 (2-sided) will be spent. Cumulative total alpha (2-sided) spent at each subsequent analysis 
of OS will be the total alpha allocated to OS multiplied by the proportion of the number of deaths observed 
at the time of the analysis out of the total planned number of deaths (330). 
Strong control of familywise Type I error rate will be controlled at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 for 
the following major secondary endpoints: TTP, CR rate, MRD negativity rate, PFS2 and OS. A hierarchical 
testing procedure will be used 
Interim analyses 
Two  interim  analyses  are  planned.  The  first  interim  analysis,  with  a  purpose  to  evaluate  safety,  will  be 
performed after a total of approximately 100 subjects have been treated for at least 8 weeks or discontinued 
the study treatment. The second interim analysis will be performed when 234 PFS events, which is 60% of 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 20/65 
 
  
  
  
 
the  total  planned  events,  have  been  accumulated.  The  purpose  of  this  interim  analysis  is  to  evaluate 
cumulative interim safety and efficacy data. The significance level at this interim analysis to establish the 
superiority of DRd over Rd with regard to PFS will be determined based on the observed number of PFS 
events at the interim analysis, using the O’Brien-Fleming boundaries as implemented by the Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending method. If the experimental arm (DRd) is numerically worse than the control arm in terms 
of PFS (observed hazard ratio >1 favoring the control arm), then the study may be terminated for futility, 
with a conditional power of less than 20% under the alternative hypothesis given the observed interim data.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 14 July 2014, and there were 4 global amendments in addition to country 
specific amendments for the UK, Germany, and France. The rationale for each amendment is summarized 
below:

During  the  study,  issues  were  identified  involving  the  collection  of  unscheduled  samples  for 
pharmacokinetic, quantitative immunoglobulins, and exploratory peripheral blood MRD testing from study 
subjects. A corrective action plan was implemented. The non-compliance did not have an impact on the 
safety,  physical,  or  mental  integrity  of  the  study  subjects.  Some  of  the  unscheduled  pharmacokinetic 
samples were tested but the results were not included in the analysis. Additionally, pharmacokinetic samples 
not  tested  will  be  destroyed.  The  unscheduled  peripheral  blood  MRD  samples  were  not  tested  and  the 
samples will be destroyed. The unscheduled quantitative immunoglobulin samples were tested, and the data 
retained in the database.  
Protocol deviations 
All protocol deviations of eligibility criteria and those deviations that could impact subject safety or primary 
endpoints  were  considered  major  protocol  deviations.  Major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  68 
subjects  (9.2%)  across  both  treatment  groups:  25  subjects  (6.8%)  in  the  DRd  group  and  43  subjects 
(11.7%) in the Rd group. One subject in the DRd group had 2 major protocol deviations (entered but did not 
satisfy criteria and other [M-protein disease evaluation at screening not within protocol defined window]).

Secondary Endpoints: 
For key secondary endpoints, pre-specified hierarchical testing, along with alpha spending using group 
sequential methods, was performed to strongly control the family-wise type I error rate at 0.05 (2-sided).

The p-values for CR or better rate, VGPR or better rate, MRD negativity rate, and ORR, all crossed the 
O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary of 0.0244 as pre-specified. 
Response-related secondary efficacy endpoints 
Table 8: Summary of Response related secondary efficacy endpoints - ITT 
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) 
For the ITT population, the DRd group demonstrated a greater rate of MRD negativity compared with the Rd 
group. The MRD negativity rate at the sensitivity threshold of 10-5 was more than 3-fold higher in subjects 
in the DRd group compared with subjects in the Rd group (DRd: 24.2%, Rd: 7.3%; odds ratio=4.04; 95% 
CI: 2.55, 6.39; p<0.0001).  
An important aspect in the assessment of MRD is the identification of tumor sequence from the baseline 
sample (calibration) that is required to evaluate the residual disease burden at the time of a deep clinical 
response. The overall calibration success rate was 238 of 267 (91.9%) in subjects with confirmed CR or 
better response. As an exploratory evaluation, MRD analyses using different thresholds (10-4 and 10-6) 
were also conducted in the ITT population. The rates of MRD negativity at these threshold levels were also 
significantly higher for the DRd group compared with the Rd group.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has provided a randomised phase 3, open-label, active controlled, and multicentre study 
(MMY3008). The incl/excl criteria clearly define a patient population above 18 years, with newly diagnosed 
MM ineligible for ASCT and with ECOG 0-2. Sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC clearly reflect the included 
patient population. The primary endpoint (PFS) is acceptable in this first-line setting. PFS2, CR and OS are 
important secondary endpoints.  
Overall, the study was well-conducted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference in 
PFS in favour of DRd (36-month PFS rate % (95% CI) of 69.5 (63.5, 74.6) in DRd arm vs 38.5 (23.0, 53.9) 
in Rd arm; median PFS not reached in DRd arm and 31.9 months in the Rd arm; HR (955 CI) = 0.56 (0.43, 
0.73), p-value < 0.0001).  Several sensitivity analyses have been provided, including PFS by investigator, all 
showed similar results as the primary analysis. Consistent results were shown across the majority of 
subgroups. Updated PFS data (cut-off 10th June 2019) with a median follow-up of 36.4 months continue to 
show statistically significant and clinically meaningful results. 
Across all response criteria DRd show statistically significant and clinically relevant results that confirm the 
primary analysis. The MRD negativity rate is 24.2% vs. 7.3% in favour of DRd.  
Overall survival data are still immature. The MAH has committed to present the final clinical study report of 
study MMY3008 by 4Q2024. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study MMY3008 was well conducted. The study met its primary endpoint and showed statistically significant 
and clinically relevant results. The results from secondary endpoints and subgroup analysis are by majority 
consistent with the primary endpoint. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Summaries of adverse events and other safety data are based on 729 subjects (DRd: 364 subjects, Rd: 365 
subjects) who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of any study treatment  and contributed any safety 
data after the start of study treatment, ie, the Safety Population.

Patient exposure 
A summary of treatment cycles received by subjects in both treatment groups is presented below. 
As of the clinical cutoff, subjects in the DRd group had received a median of 27 cycles and subjects in the Rd 
group had received 22 cycles of treatment. In addition, 237 subjects (65.1%) in the DRd group and 157 
subjects (43.0%) in the Rd group had received more than 24 cycles of treatment. The median duration of 
treatment was 25.3 months for the DRd group and 21.3 months for the Rd group. Thirty-five subjects in the 
DRd group discontinued Rd but continued daratumumab and an additional 25 subjects discontinued 
lenalidomide but continued daratumumab and dexamethasone. Four subjects in DRd discontinued 
daratumumab but continued Rd.

neutropenia (48.1% and 33.7%), anemia (7.1% and 13.7%), and lymphopenia (10.2% and 6.8%). 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 dexamethasone-related TEAE was pneumonia (9.3% in the DRd 
group and 4.1% in the Rd group).

Table 22: TEAEs with outcome Death 
There were 3 Grade 5 TEAEs related to nervous system disorder that occurred in DRd subjects.   
•  One subject was a 79-year-old male with an ongoing medical history including hepatic cirrhosis and 
increased  blood  bilirubin  levels.  Several  episodes  of  hyperammonemia  were  reported  during  the 
study.  The  investigator  considered  these  events  to  be  not  related  to  any  component  of  study 
treatment. 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 44/65 
 
  
  
  
 
 
On Study Day 416, a Grade 2 serious adverse event (SAE) of hepatic encephalopathy was reported. 
The investigator considered this event to be doubtfully related to daratumumab and lenalidomide, 
and not related to dexamethasone. The subject discontinued daratumumab on Study Day 407 and 
dexamethasone on Study Day 484 and continued lenalidomide monotherapy. 
On Study Day 711, which was 304 days after the last daratumumab dose, 227 days after the last 
dexamethasone  dose,  and  6  days  after  the  last  lenalidomide  dose,  a  Grade  4  SAE  of  hepatic 
encephalopathy was also reported. The investigator considered this event to be not related to any 
component of study treatment. 
On  Study  Day  717,  the  subject  died  due  to  Grade  5  hepatic  encephalopathy.  No  autopsy  was 
performed. The subject had last received the lenalidomide dose on Study Day 705, which was 298 
days after the last daratumumab dose. 
•  A second subject was an 81-year-old male with an ongoing medical history including hypertension, 
type 1 diabetes mellitus, mitral valve incompetence, ventricular hypertrophy, and tobacco abuse 
and a prior medical history of infectious pneumonia. The subject was on prophylactic antithrombotic 
treatment  (heparin  calcium)  from  study  entry.  At  diagnosis,  91%  of  the  subject’s  bone  marrow 
nucleated cells were plasma cells and platelet count at screening (Study Day -3) was 58×109/L. 
On  Study  Day  40,  a  Grade  3  SAE  of  pneumonia  was  reported  and  the  subject  was  hospitalized. 
Treatment included amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin), amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. The dose of 
dexamethasone was reduced to 20 mg from Study Day 50 due to the Grade 3 SAE of pneumonia and 
a Grade 2 nonserious adverse event of urinary tract infection. 
Since Cycle 1 Day 1, the subject had intermittent Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that worsened to Grade 
4 thrombocytopenia on Study Day 45. On Study Day 51, the subject died of Grade 5 hemorrhagic 
stroke  in  relation  to  Grade  4  thrombocytopenia  (platelet count  was  22×109/L).  The  investigator 
considered the event of hemorrhagic stroke as probably related to lenalidomide, doubtfully related 
to daratumumab, and not related to dexamethasone. The subject had last received the lenalidomide 
dose on Study Day 45, and daratumumab and dexamethasone doses on Study Day 50. 
•  A third subject was a 76-year-old male with an ongoing medical history including atrial fibrillation 
and  hypertension  and  prior  medical  history  of  coronary  arterial  stent  insertion  and  myocardial 
infarction. 
On Study Day 697, the subject underwent spinal surgery. During the hospitalization, the subject 
developed  an  arterial  embolism  of  the  lower  limb  and  Grade  4  SAEs  of  atrial  fibrillation, 
cerebrovascular accident, intestinal ischemia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and peripheral 
ischemia. The investigator considered these events to be possibly related to lenalidomide and not 
related  to  daratumumab  or  prednisolone.  On  Study  Day  710,  the  subject  died  due  to  Grade  5 
cerebrovascular  accident.  An  autopsy  was  not  performed.  The  subject  had  last  received  the 
daratumumab, prednisolone, and lenalidomide dose on Study Days 686, 693, and 696, respectively. 
All  three  subjects  had  contributing  medical  histories  that  predisposed  them  to  the  Grade  5  neurological 
events  that  occurred  and  therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  isolate  the  impact  that  treatment  had  on  the  fatal 
neurologic events. The first subject had ongoing hepatic cirrhosis at the time of study entry which worsened 
while on study, but the subject had not received daratumumab for almost 10 months prior to the fatal event. 
The second subject had low bone marrow reserve and therefore, thrombocytopenia complicated treatment. 
The  final  subject  had  a  history  of  atrial  fibrillation  and  myocardial  infarction  prior  to  developing  a 
post-operative thrombotic event that cascaded to multi-organ dysfunction and a Grade 5 cerebrovascular 
accident. 
Three  subjects  (0.8%)  in  the  DRd  group  died  due  to  treatment-emergent  hemorrhage  or  stroke.  Two 
subjects died due to hemorrhagic stroke and cerebrovascular accident. The remaining subject died due to 
subdural hematoma and is summarized below. 
• 
The subject was a 63-year-old male who had an ongoing medical history of hypertension, type 2 
diabetes mellitus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, depression, and 
prior medical history of smoking and alcohol use. 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 45/65 
 
  
  
  
On  Study  Day  −10,  a  Grade  3  SAE  of  subdural  hematoma  occurred.  On  the  same  day,  platelet 
function lab results showed an abnormal platelet function.  
On Study Day 8, accidental head trauma was reported and the SAE of subdural hematoma worsened 
to Grade 4. The investigator considered this event to be not related to any of the study medications. 
The subject underwent a craniotomy on Study Day 8 and received a transfusion of 4 units of fresh 
frozen plasma. The subject died of subdural hemorrhage on Study Day 10. The subject had last 
received the daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone doses on Study Days 1, 7, and 8, 
respectively. 
One  subject  (0.3%)  in  the  Rd  group  died  due  to  TEAEs  related  to  hemorrhage  or  stroke  (due  to 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage).  
• 
The subject was an 83-year-old white female who had an ongoing medical history of hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and had a prior medical history of bilateral pulmonary embolism. 
The subject was on prophylactic antithrombotic treatment (tinzaparin sodium) from study entry. 
On  Study  Day  51,  a  Grade  4  SAE  of  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  was  reported.  An  upper 
gastrointestinal  endoscopy  showed  esophagitis  and  confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage.  On  the  same  day,  the  subject  received  packed  red  blood  cell  transfusion  and 
esomeprazole.  The  investigator  considered  the  event  of  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  to  be 
doubtfully related to lenalidomide and very likely related to dexamethasone. On Study Day 58, the 
subject  died  of  the  SAE  of  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage.  The  subject  had  last  received  the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone dose on Study Days 50 and 51, respectively.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
IRR 
Infusion-related  reactions  (IRRs)  associated  with  daratumumab  administration  were  reported  in  149 
subjects (40.9%). The most frequently reported (≥5% of subjects) preferred terms for IRRs were dyspnea 
(9.3%), cough (7.4%), and chills (7.4%). Of the subjects with IRRs, most (139 of 149 subjects) had Grade 
1 or 2 events; 2.5% of subjects had Grade 3 IRRs; 1 subject (0.3%) had a Grade 4 IRR; no Grade 5 IRR was 
reported. One subject discontinued treatment with daratumumab due to IRRs (preferred terms of Grade 4 
hypertension and Grade 3 tachycardia, dyspnea, and non-cardiac chest pain).  
Most  subjects  with  an  IRR  experienced  the  IRR  during  the  first  infusion  of  daratumumab  (146  of  149 
subjects), a pattern consistent with previous daratumumab studies. Six (1.7%) and 14 subjects (3.9%) had 
an IRR during the second or subsequent infusions, respectively. Fifteen subjects (4.1%) experienced an IRR 
in more than 1 infusion. 
The median onset time for IRRs was 90 minutes into the first infusion, 111 minutes for the second infusion, 
and 68.5 minutes for the subsequent infusions, which is consistent with previous daratumumab studies.

Secondary malignancies 
Table 25: Summary of Second Primary Malignancies 
Haemorrhage 
The incidence of hemorrhage events (all grades) was balanced across the 2 treatment groups (DRd: 29.4%, 
Rd: 26.3%) and the majority of events were Grades 1 or 2. One subject in the Rd group discontinued study 
treatment due to a TEAE of intracranial hemorrhage. Two subjects in the DRd group died due to TEAEs of 
hemorrhagic stroke and subdural hematoma and 1 subject in the Rd group died due to a TEAE of 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  
Four subjects (1.1%) in the DRd group and 1 subject in the Rd group (0.3%) received fresh frozen plasma 
transfusions. The median time to first onset of hemorrhage events was similar between treatment groups, 
31.0 and 29.1 weeks in the DRd and Rd groups, respectively. In both treatment groups, more subjects with 
hemorrhage events had the first onset during the first (Cycle 1-12) and second (Cycle 13-24) year with 
fewer first onset events occurring at year 3.  
Infections and Infestations 
Overall, the incidence of infections and infestations was higher in the DRd group (86.3%) compared to the 
Rd group (73.4%). The difference was primarily driven by bronchitis (DRd: 29.1%, Rd: 20.3%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (DRd: 22.8%, Rd: 14.2%), pneumonia (DRd: 22.5%, Rd: 12.6%), and urinary 
tract infection (DRd: 17.6%, Rd: 10.4%). 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infections was higher in the DRd group (32.1%) compared with the Rd group 
(23.3%). This was largely due to a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 pneumonia in the DRd group (13.7%) 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 48/65 
 
  
  
  
 
compared with the Rd group (7.9%). Additionally, the incidence of serious TEAEs of infection were also 
higher in the DRd group (33.0%) compared with the Rd group (21.6%). This was also due to a higher 
incidence of serious TEAEs of pneumonia in the DRd group (13.2%) compared with the Rd group (7.4%). For 
all other Grade 3 or 4 and serious TEAEs of infection, the difference between treatment groups was <2%.  
Although infections were reported by a higher percentage of subjects in the DRd treatment group compared 
with the Rd treatment group, infections were manageable and rarely led to study discontinuation or death. 
Discontinuation of study treatments due to infection and infestation TEAEs was low in both groups; DRd 
group (2 subjects [0.5%]) and Rd group (5 subjects [1.4%]). Deaths due to infection were low and balanced 
between groups (DRd: 2.2%, Rd: 1.6%). 
Among subjects in the DRd group who experienced Grade ≥3 pneumonia, 45 subjects had Grade 3, 5 
subjects had Grade 4, and 2 subjects had Grade 5 pneumonia. One subject in the DRd group who died due 
to hemorrhagic stroke had ongoing Grade 3 pneumonia at the time of death. Among the subjects in the Rd 
group who experienced Grade ≥3 pneumonia, 24 subjects had Grade 3, 5 subjects had Grade 4, and 3 
subjects had Grade 5 pneumonia. 
The median time to first onset of treatment emergent infections and infestations was similar between 
treatment groups, 14.1 weeks and 13.6 weeks in the DRd and Rd groups, respectively.  
Viral Infections 
The most frequently reported (≥2% in either treatment group) treatment emergent viral infections in the 
DRd  and  Rd  groups,  respectively,  were  viral  upper  respiratory  infection  (15.4%  and  12.6%),  influenza 
(9.3% and 5.8%), oral herpes (2.2% and 3.0%), and herpes zoster (1.4% and 3.6%). 
The Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent viral infections were balanced across treatment groups (12 events in 
each group). In the DRd group influenza (8 subjects) was the only Grade 3 or 4 viral infection reported in 
more than 1 subject. In the Rd group influenza (8 subjects) and respiratory syncytial virus infection (2 
subjects) were the only Grade 3 or 4 viral infections reported in more than 1 subject. One subject in the Rd 
group discontinued study treatment due to a TEAE of influenza . The review of TEAE viral infections is limited 
to those adverse events where a virus was identified and reported; it is possible that some infectious TEAEs 
are not classified as viral if the pathogen was not identified or reported. 
Prophylactic antiviral therapy for herpes infection was administered to 65.2% of subjects in the DRd group 
and 45.5% of subjects in the Rd group. Systemic antiviral therapy (the majority of which was for 
prophylactic treatment) was administered to 69.8% of subjects in the DRd group and 52.3% of subjects in 
the Rd group. The median time to first onset of viral infections was longer in the DRd group (36.8 weeks) 
compared with the Rd group (32.4 weeks). In both treatment groups, a greater proportion of subjects with 
viral infections had the first onset during the first year (Cycle 1-12) with fewer first onset events occurring 
at year 2 or 3. 
Hepatitis B Reactivation 
No subject in this study had reactivation of hepatitis B. Five subjects (4 in the DRd group and 1 in the Rd 
group) had baseline serologies consistent with prior exposure to hepatitis B, only 1 subject (DRd group) was 
HBSAg positive. Three subjects of the 5 subjects received prophylaxis against hepatitis B reactivation with 
either tenofovir (2 subjects in the DRd group) or lamivudine (1 subject in the Rd group). 
Opportunistic Infections 
History of herpes virus infections was balanced across treatment groups, 15 subjects in each treatment 
group (preferred terms of herpes zoster, ophthalmic herpes zoster, oral herpes, genital herpes, herpes 
simplex). 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 49/65 
 
  
  
  
 
The most frequently reported (≥2% in either treatment group) opportunistic infections in the DRd and Rd 
groups, respectively, were oral candidiasis (4.1% and 5.2%), oral herpes (2.2% and 3.0%), and herpes 
zoster (1.4% and 3.6%). Five Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent opportunistic infections (cytomegalovirus 
viremia, nocardiosis, pneumocystis jirovecii infection, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and pulmonary 
mycosis) were reported for subjects in the DRd group and 1 Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent opportunistic 
infection (varicella zoster virus infection) for 1 subject in the Rd group. No individual Grade 3 or 4 
opportunistic infection was reported in more than 1 subject. No subject discontinued study treatment due to 
an opportunistic infection. One subject in the DRd group died due to a TEAE of nocardiosis. 
The median time to first onset of opportunistic infections was shorter in the DRd group (14.0 weeks) 
compared with the Rd group (21.6 weeks). In both treatment groups, most subjects with opportunistic 
infections had the first onset during the first year (Cycle 1-12) with few first onset events occurring at year 
2 or 3. 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There were no reports of tumor lysis syndrome in either treatment group during the study. 
Intravascular Haemolysis 
There were no reports of intravascular hemolysis in either treatment group during the study.  
Treatment-emergent Interferences for Blood Typing 
No subject had treatment-emergent interference for blood typing reported during the study. 
Other Adverse Events 
Thrombotic Events 
The incidence of thrombotic events was balanced between the DRd and Rd groups. The occurrence of events 
by individual preferred terms were as follows: 
•  Deep vein thrombosis (DRd: 8.5%; Rd: 9.6%) 
• 
Pulmonary embolism (DRd: 5.2%; Rd: 5.5%) 
Prophylactic use of antithrombotic agents was balanced across the 2 treatment groups (DRd: 64.4%, Rd: 
66.9%).

2.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of the DRd safety comes from one single pivotal phase 3 study. Overall, a significant number 
of patients have been exposed to a sufficient number of cycles of DRd for a substantial period of time. This 
should enable a thorough safety assessment of DRd.  
In general, there are slightly more Grade 4 AEs in the DRd arm, 26.9% vs. 21.9%, and looking at common 
AEs there seems to be more AEs in the DRd arm across all SOCs. The higher number of AEs in DRd reflects 
the safety profile of daratumumab. 
Overall, there are more Grade 3-4 AEs in the DRd arm. Looking at Grade 3-4 AEs a significant difference is 
seen in neutropenia, lymphopenia and leukopenia. This is also reflected in Grade 3 pneumonia, 12.4% vs. 
6.6% in favour of Rd. There is no difference in terms of Grade 4 pneumonias. The higher risk of neutropenia 
and infections is known with daratumumab and is clearly reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.   
Looking at AEs judged to be drug-related by the investigators, differences were seen in terms of 
neutropenia, diarrhoea and fatigue.  
There is no relevant difference in terms of deaths within 60 days of the first dose and within 30 days of the 
last dose. Overall, no differences could be seen in total number of deaths, 6.3% vs. 6.9%, Rd and DRd 
respectively. 
Cytopenia is commonly associated with daratumumab, however, more importantly there were no relevant 
differences between Rd and DRd in terms of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis or neutropenic infection. 
There are no significant differences in terms of Grade 3-4 viral infections. However, viral re-activation is a 
serious risk in relation to daratumumab. The SmPC clearly reflects that prophylaxis for herpes zoster should 
be considered. There has been cases of fatal hepatitis B reactivation in other studies. This issue is currently 
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 57/65 
 
  
  
  
 
being addressed in a different procedure (EMEA/H/C/004077/II/0027).Opportunistic infections (Grade 3 or 
4) were reported more frequently in the DRd group [5 subjects (cytomegalovirus viremia, nocardiosis, 
pneumocystis jirovecii infection, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and pulmonary mycosis)] than in the Rd 
group (1 subject: varicella zoster virus infection). No individual Grade 3 or 4 opportunistic infection was 
reported in more than 1 subject. No subject discontinued study treatment due to an opportunistic infection. 
One subject in the DRd group died due to a TEAE of nocardiosis. The median time to first onset of 
opportunistic infections was shorter in the DRd group (14 weeks) compared with the Rd group (21.6 weeks). 
In both treatment groups, most subjects with opportunistic infections had the first onset during the first year 
(Cycle 1-12) with few first onset events occurring at year 2 or 3.  
More patients in the Rd arm discontinued treatment due to AEs, 15.8% vs 7.1%, however, many patients 
could continue daratumumab monotherapy despite AEs leading to discontinuation of the Rd.   
Overall, the observed safety profile is as expected and in line with the safety profile of daratumumab.  
2.6.1.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of DRd is worse than Rd. The additional toxicity clearly reflects the known safety 
profile of daratumumab. However, the majority of the AEs are clinically manageable, and no new safety 
findings were observed during this study. 
2.6.2.  PSUR cycle

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were accepted by 
the CHMP. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient 
groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant clonal plasma cells disorder, that represents approximately a 0.8% of 
all  cancers  worldwide  (Ferlay  2015).  The  proliferation  of  the  malignant  clonal  plasma  cells  leads  to 
subsequent  replacement  of  normal  bone  marrow  hematopoietic  precursors  and  overproduction  of 
M-proteins, progressive morbidity and eventual mortality. Characteristic MM hallmarks include osteolytic 
lesions,  anaemia  (due  to  bone  marrow  dysfunction),  increased  susceptibility  to  infections  (due  to 
immunosuppression), hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency/failure, and neurological complications (Palumbo 
2011). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma are typically categorized into 2 subpopulations defined by 
their age and suitability for intensive treatment. For patients who are considered fit, an induction regimen 
followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and ASCT is considered the standard of care. For patients 
considered ineligible for HDT and ASCT due to their age, presence of comorbidities, and/or physical status, 
the treatment approach often favors longer, less intensive/toxic treatments, including most commonly 
a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and a corticosteroid in toxicity-adapted fashions. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current submission is based on data from the Phase 3 study, MMY3008 (clinical cut-off, 10 June 2019). 
This study is a randomized, open-label, active controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study in subjects at 
least 18 years of age with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for high dose chemotherapy 
and ASCT, to evaluate the efficacy (PFS) of DRd compared with Rd and to evaluate the safety/tolerability and 
clinical outcomes of DRd compared to Rd. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
• 
The  study  met  is  primary  endpoint  showing  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
difference in favour of DRd (median PFS was not reached in DRd, but was 31.9 months in the Rd 
arm. HR (95% CI) = 0.56 (0.43, 0.73), p-value < 0.0001).  
EMA/CHMP/622108/2019 
Page 62/65 
 
  
  
  
•  Secondary  endpoints  (time  to  PD,  time  to  subsequent  therapy  and  PFS2)  all  show  consistent 
favourable effects, confirming the primary analysis.  
•  Across  all  response  criteria  DRd  show  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  results  that 
confirm the primary analysis.  
• 
The MRD negativity rate was 24.2% vs. 7.3% at 3 years in favour of DRd. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
OS data are immature. The MAH has committed to providing the final CSR post-authorisation.  
Additionally, it should be noted that since the response rates in D-Rd are better, with a higher rate of CR and 
also with a greater depth of response (MRD negativity), continuing with a long-term maintenance treatment 
with daratumumab could be questioned, especially in those patients who achieve an optimal response. 
However, addressing this question would require a new clinical study, which is currently out of the scope of 
this application. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, there are slightly more Grade 4 AEs in the DRd arm, 26.9% vs. 21.9%, and looking at common 
AEs there seems to be more AEs in the DRd arm across all SOCs. The higher number of AEs in DRd reflects 
the safety profile of daratumumab. 
Looking at Grade 3-4 AEs, a significant increase with daratumumab is seen in neutropenia, lymphopenia and 
leukopenia. This is also reflected in Grade 3 pneumonia, 12.4% for DRd vs. 6.6% for Rd. There is no 
difference in terms of Grade 4 pneumonias. The higher risk of neutropenia and infections is known with 
daratumumab and is reflected in the SmPC.   
Cytopenia is commonly associated with daratumumab; however, there were no relevant differences 
between Rd and DRd in terms of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis or neutropenic infection. 
There are no significant differences in terms of Grade 3-4 viral infections. However, viral re-activation is a 
serious risk in relation to daratumumab. The SmPC clearly reflects that prophylaxis for herpes zoster should 
be considered. There have been cases of fatal hepatitis B reactivation in other studies. This issue is currently 
being addressed in a different procedure (EMEA/H/C/004077/II/0027). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no major uncertainties or limitations about unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In Study MMY3008, DRd now showed clinically relevant improvements in terms of PFS and response rates in 
patients newly-diagnosed with a multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT. These results are highly 
relevant in this population with a dismal prognosis. A sCR rate of 30.4% is clinically very encouraging. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  daratumumab  in  combination  with  Rd  seems  generally  consistent  with  the 
known safety profile of daratumumab and the respective combination agents and it seems to be manageable 
with  dosing  modifications,  and  is  reasonably  tolerated,  as  suggested  by  the  relatively  low  proportion  of 
discontinuations due to AEs.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R balance of DRd in the proposed patient population is considered positive, since the demonstrated 
benefits of DRd for the treatment of adult patients with NDMM that are ineligible for ASCT are considered to 
outweigh the toxicity of the combination, which is considered generally acceptable and manageable in the 
current clinical setting.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Darzalex in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant is 
positive.

patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant 
(ASCT) for Darzalex; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP has been updated accordingly (finally agreed version 
6.2). Furthermore, the Annex II is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Darzalex is not similar to Imnovid (pomalidomide), Farydak 
(panabinostat), Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and Ninlaro (ixazomib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

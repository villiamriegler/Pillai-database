2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
The current combined type II variation and line extension is aimed on registering a novel 
pharmaceutical form, granules in capsules for opening, as well as extension of the therapeutic 
indication. 
The proposed therapeutic indication was:
“Entresto is indicated in children and adolescents aged one year or older for treatment of chronic heart 
failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.”
Paediatric heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction
The European Society of Cardiology defined heart failure (HF) as a clinical syndrome consisting of 
cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by 
signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). It is due to 
a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures 
and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. 
The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation defines paediatric HF as a clinical and 
pathophysiologic syndrome that results from ventricular dysfunction, volume, or pressure overload, 
alone or in combination. In children, it leads to characteristic signs and symptoms, such as poor 
growth, feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, exercise intolerance, and fatigue, and is associated 
with circulatory, neurohormonal, and molecular abnormalities.
More specifically, paediatric chronic HF with left ventricular systolic dysfunction refers to paediatric 
chronic HF characterized by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, as evidence using 
echocardiography.

EMA/172209/2023
Page 8/132
2.1.2.  Epidemiology
The incidence of paediatric heart failure is estimated to be 0.97 to 7.4 per 100,000 in the USA, 
whereas in Europe, incidences varied from 0.87 in the United Kingdom and Ireland to 2.0–3.0 per 
100,000 in Germany [10.1016/j.cardfail.2012.03.001 & 10.1007/s00246-017-1787-2]. The prevalence 
of paediatric heart failure has been reported in Spain to be 83 per 100,000 children and adolescents.
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis
In the paediatric population, the major aetiologies of paediatric HF are congenital heart disease and 
cardiomyopathies. After birth, the major causes are fetal cardiomyopathies or extracardiac conditions 
(including hypoglycemia and sepsis). In the first week, congenital heart disease with ductus-dependent 
systemic circulation becomes the main cause, including aortic coarctation and aortic stenosis, due to 
the closing of the ductus arteriosus. In the following months, major causes are congenital heart 
diseases with left to right shunts (patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects). Later, in older 
children and adolescence, major causes are cardiomyopathies or myocarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy 
(DCM), which is associated with abnormalities of left ventricular systolic function, is the most common 
myopathic process leading to paediatric HF [10.1016/j.pedneo.2017.01.001].  
Regardless of the cause of paediatric HF with LVSD, the reduced systolic function leads to several 
compensatory mechanisms, including an activation of the sympathetic nervous system (leading to 
peripheral vasoconstriction) and the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to 
increased concentrations of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone. While beneficial in the short-term, 
on the longer term, the enhanced catecholamine leads to cardiomyocyte injury, whereas elevation of 
aldosterone and angiotensin promote cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, an increased 
activation of the natriuretic peptide system has been demonstrated in paediatric HF, which partially 
counteracts the RAAS system.
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis
The clinical picture of paediatric HF is strictly related to age. In infants and young children, the typical 
presentation is difficulty in feeding, with additional characteristics being cyanosis, tachypnea and sinus 
tachycardia. The major presentations in older children and adolescents include fatigue, shortness of 
breath, and exercise intolerance. Besides clinical investigation, additional analyses may include ECG, 
chest radiography, echocardiography and laboratory investigations. 
Paediatric heart failure is associated with high morbidity and mortality. For example, the in-hospital 
mortality for patients with heart failure in 2009 was 6.7%, compared with a 0.4% in-hospital mortality 
rate for children without heart failure [10.1016/j.cardfail.2012.03.001]. 
The well-established New York Heart Association (NYHA) HF classification does not apply to most 
paediatric populations. The Ross HF classification was developed to assess severity in infants and has 
subsequently been modified to apply to all paediatric ages.
2.1.5.  Management
Due to the different etiologies and the relatively low incidence of paediatric heart failure, the 
development of medical therapy in paediatric HF is challenging. In contrast to HF in adults, to date, 
few clinical trials have been conducted in paediatric patients with HF. Consequently, there are no 
approved therapies in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of paediatric HF, and medical 
recommendations are mainly based on data from adult studies. Therefore, all current medical 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 9/132
recommendations for peadiatric heart failure with LVSD are based on off-label usage. The mainstay of 
treatment consists of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs), beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and diuretics in case of fluid overload. Of these, ACEIs 
are considered the first-line treatment for paediatric HF according to The Report on the Expert Group 
Meeting of Paediatric Heart Failure, London, 29 November 2010 (EMA 2011) and are recommended by 
the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) for the treatment of symptomatic 
left ventricular dysfunction (Class I recommendation, Level of Evidence B; Kirk et al. 2014). Although 
not approved for treating paediatric patients with HF, enalapril is the most commonly used ACEI in 
children with HF.
ACE inhibitors are considered the first-line treatment by the International Society for Heart and Lung 
Transplantation, although the evidence on which this is based is limited. A retrospective analysis of 81 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy compared ACE inhibitor treatment with conventional therapy (at 
that time digoxin and diuretics) and demonstrated a better survival during the first year of treatment, 
which became insignificant in the following years [10.1007/bf00794837]. Another retrospective 
analysis of 189 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated a numerical trend toward better 
survival when comparing ACE inhibitor-treated patients with digoxin-treated patients, though it did not 
reach statistical significance [10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.059]. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 
57 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in which perindopril was compared to placebo, 
demonstrated that perindopril delayed the onset and progression of prominent left ventricle 
dysfunction after 3 years of treatment but did not investigate mortality [10.1016/j.jacc.2004.09.078]. 
A later publication of the same study demonstrated that at the end of the 10 years follow-up period, 
survival status was 26 (92.9%) of 28 patients in the perindopril group were alive at 10 years versus 19 
(65.5%) of 29 in the placebo group (P = .02). 
Given the high mortality and morbidity associated with paediatric HF, there is a significant unmet 
medical need for approved treatments with demonstrated benefits, acceptable safety, appropriate 
posology and age-appropriate formulation in paediatric patients with HF. 
The main goals of HF management are to prevent the onset of symptoms related to the reduced LV 
ejection fraction, stabilize or improve the symptomatic patients, and increase survival.
2.2.  About the product
Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696, Entresto®, Neparvis®) is a first-in-class angiotensin receptor and 
neprilysin (ARN) inhibitor that is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with heart 
failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in 117 countries, including the US and EU.
Sacubitril is a prodrug that is in vivo converted to sacubitrilat via esterases. Sacubitrilat inhibits 
neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase that degrades vasoactive peptides. As a result, sacubitrilat 
increases the concentration of natriuretic peptides, causing blood vessel dilation and reduced ECF 
volume via sodium excretion. Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist and inhibits the 
effects of angiotensin II.  
The current indication for Entresto as 24 mg/26 mg, 49 mg/51 mg, 97 mg/103 mg film-coated tablets 
is as follows:
Entresto is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (see section 5.1).
The proposed indication for Entresto was as follows: 
Adult heart failure
Entresto is indicated in adult patients for treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (see section 5.1).

Paediatric heart failure
Entresto is indicated in children and adolescents aged one year or older for treatment of 
chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see section 5.1).
The proposed posology for the paediatric indication was: 
Paediatric heart failure
Table 1 shows the recommended dose for paediatric patients, except in the situations described below 
the table. The recommended dose should be taken orally twice daily. The dose should be increased 
every 2-4 weeks to the target dose, as tolerated by the patient.
Entresto film-coated tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 40 kg. Entresto film-coated 
granules are available for these patients.

(Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and patients who have moderate 
hepatic impairment (see special populations).
#0.8 mg, 1.6 mg, 2.3 mg and 3.1 mg refer to the combined weight of sacubitril/valsartan and are to 
be given using film-coated granules.
In patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB or taking low doses of these medicinal 
products, half of the starting dose is recommended. In paediatric patients weighing 40 kg to less than 
50 kg, a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg twice daily (given as film-coated granules) is recommended. After 
initiation, the dose should be increased following the recommended dose titration in Table 1 and 
adjusted every 3 4 weeks.
Treatment should not be initiated in patients with serum potassium level >5.3 mmol/l or with SBP 
<5th percentile for the age of the patient. If patients experience tolerability issues (SBP <5th 
percentile for the age of the patient, symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalaemia, renal dysfunction), 
adjustment of concomitant medicinal products, temporary down–titration or discontinuation of Entresto 
is recommended (see section 4.4).
The agreed indication at the end of the procedure is:
Paediatric heart failure
Entresto is indicated in children and adolescents aged one year or older for treatment of symptomatic 
chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see section 5.1).
The agreed posology for paediatric indication is:

ARB or have been taking low doses of these medicinal products, patients who have renal impairment 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and patients who have moderate 
hepatic impairment (see special populations).
#0.8 mg/kg, 1.6 mg/kg, 2.3 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg refer to the combined weight of sacubitril and 
valsartan and are to be given using granules.
In patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB or taking low doses of these medicinal 
products, half of the starting dose is recommended. For paediatric patients weighing 40 kg to less than 
50 kg, a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg twice daily (given as granules) is recommended. After initiation, 
the dose should be increased to the standard starting dose following the recommended dose titration 
in Table 1 and adjusted every 3-4 weeks.
For example, a paediatric patient weighing 25 kg who has not previously taken an ACE inhibitor should 
start with half the standard starting dose, which corresponds to 20 mg (25 kg × 0.8 mg/kg) twice 
daily, given as granules. After rounding to the closest number of full capsules, this corresponds to 
2 capsules of 6 mg/6 mg sacubitril/valsartan twice daily.
Treatment should not be initiated in patients with serum potassium level >5.3 mmol/l or with SBP <5th 
percentile for the age of the patient. If patients experience tolerability issues (SBP <5th percentile for 
the age of the patient, symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalaemia, renal dysfunction), adjustment of 
concomitant medicinal products, temporary down-titration or discontinuation of Entresto is 
recommended (see section 4.4).
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development
The present line extension is being filed for Entresto (a separate procedure is also being filed for its 
duplicate marketing authorisation Neparvis) (sacubitril/valsartan) to register a suitable paediatric 
pharmaceutical form (6 mg/6 mg and 15 mg/16 mg granules in capsules for opening). The extension 
application is grouped with:
- A Type II variation (C.I.6.a) - expansion to the approved indication for the treatment of paediatric 
patients aged one year and above based on the results from PANORAMA-HF (Study CLCZ696B2319).
The Entresto development program in paediatric patients for the treatment of heart failure was 
discussed and agreed upon with the PDCO on May 30, 2012 (EMEA-000316-PIP02-11). The Entresto 
Paediatric Investigational Plan (EMEA-000316-PIP03-20) consists of quality (Study 1: Development of 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

an age-appropriate solid oral dosage form), non-clinical (Study 2: Mechanistic in-vitro study, study 3: 
4-week dose range-finding juvenile rabbit bone toxicity study and study 4: a 4-week investigative bone 
study in juvenile rats) and clinical measures (study 5: Open-label, randomized, single-dose, multiple 
treatment period study to determine the relative bioavailability of LCZ696 paediatric formulation 
relative to the LCZ696 200 mg Final Market Image (FMI) tablet in healthy adult subjects, study 6: Part 
2 of B2319, and study 7: Part 2 of B2319). A PDCO partial compliance check procedure (EMEA-C1-
000316-PIP02-11-M01) to confirm compliance of the non-clinical measures (study 2, study 3 and study 
4) and one of the clinical measures (study 5) was completed prior to the submission of the original 
marketing authorization application. On March 08, 2022 the partial compliance check (C2-000316-
PIP02- 11-M05) to confirm compliance of the quality measure (study 1) was completed. The final 
compliance check for the remaining clinical measures (study 6 and study 7) has received a positive 
opinion from the PDCO on May 20, 2022 (Procedure EMEA-C-000316-PIP02-11- M05).

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The finished products are film-coated granules filled into capsules for opening. The granules are 
intended to be administered by sprinkling on soft food.  The capsule serves as a dosing aid and is 
discarded after dispensing film-coated granules. 
The film-coated granules are white to almost white to slightly yellow, round, biconvex with a diameter 
of about 2 mm. The capsules (size 0) of both strengths have a body that is transparent with red 
imprints, “NVR” marking on one side, and an axial rectified unfilled arrow on the opposite site (Figure 
1). The caps of the 6.1 mg/6.4 mg strength are white opaque with red imprints, “04” marking on one 
side, and an axial rectified unfilled arrow on the opposite side. The caps of the 15.18 mg/16.07 mg 
strength are yellow opaque with red imprints, “10” marking on one side, and an axial rectified unfilled 
arrow on the opposite side. 
Figure 1: picture of commercial capsules 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The aim of the 
pharmaceutical development was to develop an oral immediate-release dosage form as an extension to 
the registered film-coated tablets, which is suitable for paediatric population from one year of age and 
enables sufficient dose flexibility.
The formulation development was initiated with the existing composition of the final blend of the 
100 mg commercial adult core tablet. Batches of different compositions were manufactured to identify 
the final composition. Excipients used for coating are compendial and were chosen based on 
experience with similar products. To check the functionality of the coating, different coating levels were 
tested.
The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments (DoE) to identify the critical product quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process 
parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in 
order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the 
finished product quality attributes. 
Based on the results of lab and pilot scale experiments, some variables were designated as potentially 
critical because they demonstrated a meaningful impact on finished product quality attributes. The 
potential critical process parameters were further investigated during full-scale manufacturing of 
process verification batches. The objectives of the process verification were to finalize the commercial 
manufacturing process, confirm the critical process parameter designations and verify the control 
strategy prior to process validation. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified.
Bioavailability (BA) studies were performed to bridge the proposed paediatric and commercial adult 
formulation. The film-coated tablets and film-coated granules formulations were demonstrated to be 
bioequivalent.
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 14/132
The finished product batches that were used in the BA studies, as well as the batches used in the 
pivotal clinical study, are representative of the proposed commercial product. Dissolution profiles 
similarity as per the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 
1/Corr has been demonstrated.
The development of the QC dissolution method has been described in sufficient detail and the choices 
made are justified. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated.
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The choice and ratio 
of the excipients used in the granule cores was based on compatibility studies and experience gained 
on the film-coated tablets. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. 
The finished product is considered adequate for use in the target paediatric population. No safety 
issues are foreseen with the selected excipients and their quantities for use in children. Compatibility of 
the film-coated granules with soft food was demonstrated. The ease of opening the capsules was 
confirmed in clinical practice. 
The primary packaging is PA/Alu/PVC blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
At the time of CHMP opinion, there are currently no standard terms in the EDQM database deemed 
suitable to describe the present dosage form. After QWP consultation, the non-standard term 
“Granules in capsules for opening” was considered the most appropriate by majority of members. This 
is also in line with precedents, where for the same pharmaceutical dose form the non-standard term 
“Granules in capsules for opening” was included in the SmPC and packaging.
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of following five main steps: dry granulation by roller compaction, 
screening, mixing, compression and film-coating. The film-coated granules are treated with an anti-
electrostatic agent (talc) before filling into capsules. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process.
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Sufficient 
information on the critical process parameters and in-process controls has been provided in line with 
development data. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form.
In line with the Guideline on process validation for finished products it is acceptable that formal 
validation studies have not been completed yet. The manufacturing process is considered a standard 
process and process parameter settings are sufficiently supported by the available development data. 
An adequate process validation scheme has been provided in the section 3.2.R. 
The critical process steps are adequately described and controlled. Proven acceptable ranges (PAR) 
have been defined. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis 
data fully support the proposed PARs.

2.4.3.3.  Product specification
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance (shell and contents), mean mass of contents, identity (IR, HPLC), water content 
(KF), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products 
(HPLC) and microbiological quality. 
A major objection (MO) was raised in relation to the initially proposed dissolution limit, as the 
dissolution limit was not considered justified in line with clinical batch data. To ensure batch-to-batch 
consistency of future batches, CHMP requested to set the dissolution specification limit based on the 
dissolution profiles of the finished product batches that were used in the pivotal clinical study. The 
applicant agreed to tighten the specification limit for dissolution in line with CHMP recommendation, 
resulting in MO resolution.  
The limits for impurities are set in line with the ICH Q3B limits. The limit for any unspecified impurity is 
acceptable based on a maximum daily dose and related identification threshold. The limit for the 
sacubitril related impurity exceeds the qualification threshold, however it is considered acceptable in 
view of the batch analysis and stability data and is also qualified from a safety point of view given the 
fact that the impurity is the major in vivo, active metabolite of sacubitril.
The absence of testing for chiral purity has been adequately justified in accordance with ICH Q6A, by 
demonstrating that no chiral impurities are formed during the manufacture and storage of the finished 
product. Control of chiral purity in the active substance alone is therefore considered sufficient. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on three commercial scale batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that 
each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A nitrosamine risk evaluation was performed considering finished product excipients, manufacturing 
process, packaging and storage, and no specific potential risk for nitrosamines was identified for this 
line-extension. Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine 
impurities in the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for eight pilot and three production scale batches (both strengths) 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the above release 
specifications, through traditional final product release testing.
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product
Stability data from three commercial scale batches per strength of finished product stored for up to 12 
months under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30°C / 75% RH), and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. One batch of each strength was also stored at -20 °C / ambient RH (12 months) and 5 °C / 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 16/132
ambient RH (12 months). The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.
In addition, one batch per dosage strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with storage conditions ‘This 
medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. Store in the original 
package in order to protect from moisture’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The application concerns a line extension, therefore only the finished product part of the dossier was 
assessed. Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The major objection related to the dissolution specification limit 
has been adequately addressed. The limit was tightened in line with biobatch data and CHMP 
recommendation. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product.
As at the time of CHMP opinion, there are currently no standard terms in the EDQM database deemed 
suitable to describe the present dosage form, the non-standard term “Granules in capsules for 
opening” was considered the most appropriate.
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
There has been no change in the overall non-clinical safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics 
profile based on the results from non-clinical experiments included in the original MAA submission for 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 17/132
the treatment of adult patients with HFrEF. Since the submission of the original MAA, no additional 
nonclinical studies have been performed by Novartis. In both nonclinical species and humans, orally 
administered sacubitril/valsartan dissociates into valsartan and sacubitril (also known as AHU377), 
which is further metabolized to the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitrilat (also known as LBQ657).
2.5.2.  Pharmacology
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies
The applicant provided an update of the literature regarding the combination sacubitril/valsartan since 
2015. It was shown that the combined treatment with sacubitril/valsartan improved pharmacodynamic 
responses compared to valsartan treatment only in relation to cardiac function after infarction or valve 
insufficiency, molecular markers (such as cTnT levels, serum hsCRP, IL-6, RAAS pathway and 
natriuretic peptide, among others. The update and discussion provided by the applicant is considered 
sufficient. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics
No new studies or data were provided. Toxicokinetic data was discussed in the toxicology section.
2.5.4.  Toxicology
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
Sacubitril
Sacubitril alone was tested in a rat juvenile toxicity study with exposure from PND7 through PND 70, 
covering the neonatal stage up to adulthood. Adverse effects on body weight were observed at all 
doses tested (<0.2 fold MRHD), and adverse effects on bone length (femur) and mineralization of bone 
(proximal tibia) were observed at higher doses, with a safety margin of 0.2 fold MRHD. After one 
month of recovery (PND105), femur length and bone mass at a low and mid-dose (males only) were 
slightly decreased compared to control (~5% decrease), but these slight decreases were proportional 
to body weight and were likely secondary to decreases in growth. However, at a mid dose in females 
and for both sexes at high doses, decreases in bone density of the proximal tibia persisted (11-15% 
decrease).
Gastric squamous mucosal hyperplasia and vacuolation were observed at all doses tested, which were 
still observed after recovery. These findings were also observed in adult rats in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. 
Absolute values of bone size, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density were not affected in 
adult rats. Furthermore, adverse effects on the CNS and thyroid gland were observed in adult rats in 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies and were not observed in the sacubitril rat juvenile toxicity study.
In an investigative follow-up study, the effects of sacubitril on bone growth and mineralization were 
investigated further with exposure from PND7 through PND35, and a four-month recovery period. 
Similar findings on bone growth and mineralization were observed in this study. In addition, the 
greatest effects on growth were observed around PND21 (equivalent to approximately 2 years of age 
in humans), which was related to higher exposure to sacubitril and LBQ657 on PND7 (equivalent to 
human new born) compared to exposure at later time points (PND21 (weaning) and PND34 (pre- 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 18/132
peripubertal) and greatest body weight decreases. After four months of recovery, all bone effects were 
found to be reversible. 
According to the applicant, the bone changes are potentially secondary to decreases in body weight 
gain. However, the mechanism is not well understood, as the effects observed in juvenile rats were not 
consistent with the on-target pharmacologic effects of Sacubitril on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).
In a rabbit juvenile dose range finding study, no adverse effects were observed, up to an exposure 
margin of 0.5-fold exposure in paediatric patients MRHD.
In conclusion, bone is a target organ together with growth retardation for sacubitril in juvenile rats 
with a safety margin lower than exposure in the human paediatric population. In the clinical paediatric 
study (B2319), no increased risk of fractures and altered growth was observed. In addition, increases 
in height and height Z-score were comparable between treatment and age groups. Nonetheless, the 
duration of this clinical study may be too short to detect long-term changes in growth. However, the 
mechanism behind the bone growth findings in juvenile rats is unknown; therefore, the relevance of 
these bone findings to the human paediatric population is also unknown. 
Valsartan
In a juvenile toxicity study, rats were treated with valsartan from PND7 through PND70. 
Pharmacological effects of valsartan on the kidney leading primarily to juxtaglomerular cell 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia in adult animals, seem to be exaggerated in juvenile animals leading to 
tubular nephropathy, sometimes accompanied by tubular epithelial necrosis, which was not reversible. 
This occurred at exposures well below human exposure based on paediatric AUC values of valsartan 
(EM 1-6-year-old = <0.0051 fold; 6-18-year-old = <0.068 fold). 
The effects on the kidney observed in this study are related to exaggerated pharmacology, as can be 
expected from ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. Until PND13, rat kidneys are not fully 
developed, and during this period, rats are sensitive to the observed kidney-related effects. In human, 
this coincides with 36 weeks of gestation, which could occasionally extend up to 44 weeks after 
conception. Therefore, possible effects on the development of the kidney from week 4-6 after birth 
cannot be excluded. As functional growth of the kidney is a gradual process one year after birth, the 
clinical relevance of these findings until <1 year cannot be excluded either. This is sufficiently reflected 
in the SmPC as the paediatric indication of Entresto is for children >1 year.
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The applicant previously submitted (EMEA/H/C/004062) a full blown ERA assessment, including the 
calculation of the environmental risk ratio’s for the different environment compartments, which were 
all well below a ratio of 1. The applicant further discussed that the expected increase due to the new 
paediatric indication would be low due to an increase in prevalence of 1.004 as compared to the adult 
indication. Therefore, additional consumer usage of the paediatric population is expected to be of 
limited impact on the earlier calculated environmental exposures.
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Sacubitril is indicated to be given chronically to paediatric patients, and therefore, long-term clinical 
effects on bone growth in the paediatric population are unknown. Therefore the applicant agreed to 
add to section 5.3 of the SmPC at the end of the proposed sacubitril section: “However, long term 
paediatric data on (bone)growth and fracture rate is not available”. 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 19/132
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
For the current line extension procedure, the applicant built upon the studies provided for the Entresto 
marketing authorisation application (MAA). The applicant provided an updated discussion on up-to-
date literature regarding the primary pharmacology of sacubitril and valsartan. No novel information 
was provided regarding non-clinical pharmacokinetics.
Overall the juvenile toxicology package revealed that bone is a target organ together with growth 
retardation for sacubitril in juvenile rats with a safety margin lower than exposure in the human 
paediatric population. Furthermore, in juvenile rats, valsartan-induced effects on the kidney are related 
to exaggerated pharmacology. The SmPC was updated to reflect that the long term paediatric data on 
(bone)growth and fracture rate is not available.
The application was considered acceptable from nonclinical point of view.
2.6.  Clinical aspects
2.6.1.  Introduction
GCP aspects
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies
The totality of evidence included in this submission supporting the safety and efficacy of 
sacubitril/valsartan for paediatric use includes 1) extrapolation of the existing adult HFrEF data from 
the PARADIGM-HF study to children based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from 
PANORAMA-HF paediatric study and 2) the clinical data provided by the B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) study. 
A tabular listing of the reports of controlled clinical studies pertinent to the claimed indication is shown 
in Table 1. 
Table 1. Clinical studies of the current dossier. 
A more detailed tabular listing per study is shown for below study B2319 (Table 2) and B2314 (Table 
3).

2.6.2.  Rationale for an extrapolation from adult to paediatric patients of 
the use of sacubitril/valsartan in HF with LVSD. 
Sacubitril/valsartan, unlike any other therapy for HF, provides concomitant inhibition of neprilysin and 
the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor. Inhibition of neprylysin with chronic oral administration of 
sacubitril/valsartan can promote the endogenous capacity of the body to compensate for HF 
exacerbations by potentiating the activity of natriuretic peptides secreted by the heart in response to 
cardiac stress and increased intravascular volume. Natriuretic peptides exert their effects by activating 
membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, resulting in increased concentrations of the 
second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which could result in vasodilation, 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 21/132
natriuresis and diuresis, increased glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, inhibition of renin 
and aldosterone release, reduction of sympathetic activity, and anti-hypertrophic and anti-fibrotic 
effects. The resulting increase in natriuretic peptide (NP) activity due to neprilysin inhibition and AT1 
receptor blockade through RAAS inhibition have complementary effects on the CV system, improving 
outcomes in HF patients. 
Given that the pathophysiology of HF in adult HFrEF with DCM and paediatric HF due to LVSD are 
similar (described and discussed in the following sections), the inhibition of the RAAS axis by 
sacubitril/valsartan is expected to have similar beneficial effects in children with HF due to LVSD as in 
adults with HFrEF. The similar pathophysiology is a key element that enables extrapolation of existing 
adult HFrEF data to paediatric HF patients, as highlighted in the draft ICH E11A guidance on paediatric 
extrapolation.  
In view of this, an extrapolation plan was designed by the applicant. However, as far as currently 
known by the EMA, this plan has not been discussed with the PDCO. 
2.6.3.  Appropriateness of extrapolating sacubitril/valsartan data from 
adults to paediatrics
There have been ongoing efforts from regulatory agencies globally to optimize the development of 
treatment modalities in paediatric patients. In this context, the CHMP released in April 2022 the draft 
ICH guideline E11A on paediatric extrapolation (ICH E11A guideline), which aims to better leverage the 
use of the existing information on approved treatment in adults and enable extrapolation to paediatrics 
when appropriate to reduce exposure of paediatric populations to unnecessary clinical trial 
interventions, and to facilitate more timely access to paediatric medicines globally. 
The extrapolation is based on the principles laid down in the ICH E11A guidance: similarity of the 
disease in the target paediatric HF patients with LVSD and the adult HFrEF patients; similar drug 
exposure and exposure-response demonstrated in these 2 populations; and similar reduction from 
baseline in NT-proBNP, a biomarker associated with clinical outcomes in both population. In 
Study B2314, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels at baseline and changes 
from baseline were correlated with clinical outcomes. Changes in NT-proBNP are also associated with 
markers of left ventricular systolic function and heart failure outcomes in paediatric patients. 
Of note, based on interim 12-week data from Study B2319 (N=110), sacubitril/valsartan was approved 
in the US by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic HF with systemic LVSD in paediatric patients 
aged one year and older. Sacubitril/valsartan reduces N-Terminal prohormone-B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-proBNP) and is expected to improve cardiovascular outcomes. The safety and tolerability 
of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric patients from the interim Study B2319 data were consistent with 
that observed in adult patients.  
2.6.4.  Key steps of the proposed extrapolation plan
The key steps of the MAHs proposed extrapolation plan are summarized below and aligned with 
principles laid down in the ICH E11A guidance. 
1.
Demonstrate disease similarity between the reference population (with established efficacy) 
and the target population. In this case, the applicant has defined the reference population as 
adult HFrEF patients with DCM and the reference population as paediatric HF patients with 
LVSD consistent with DCM. 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 22/132
2.
Demonstrate similar drug pharmacology (exposure). Similar drug pharmacology will be tested 
by comparing the AUC of the target paediatric dose (3.1 mg/kg) in part 1 of study B2319 with 
the AUC of the target adult dose (200mg) in study B2314. 
3.
4.
Demonstrate a similar exposure response. In this extrapolation plan, the response will be NT-
proBNP change in response to treatment at an exposure-matched dose. 
Investigate the potential of NT-proBNP as a suitable biomarker to bridge efficacy between adult 
and paediatric populations. To do the latter, the applicant proposed using the Prentice criteria, 
which are summarized below:
1. The treatment has a significant impact on the true clinical endpoint. 
2. The treatment has a significant impact on the biomarker
3. The biomarker is significantly associated with true clinical endpoint 
4. The effect of treatment on true clinical endpoint is explained by the biomarker
The results from the extrapolation plan are demonstrated under section 3.3.7.1 extrapolation plan 
(part of clinical efficacy). 
2.6.5.  Clinical pharmacology
2.6.5.1.  Pharmacokinetics
Introduction
Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696, Entresto®, Neparvis®) is a first-in-class angiotensin receptor and 
neprilysin (ARN) inhibitor that is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with heart 
failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in 117 countries, including the US and EU. Sacubitril 
is a prodrug that is in vivo converted to sacubitrilat via esterases. Sacubitrilat inhibits neprilysin, a 
neutral endopeptidase that degrades vasoactive peptides. As a result, sacubitrilat increases the 
concentration of natriuretic peptides, causing blood vessel dilation and reduction of ECF volume via 
sodium excretion. Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist and inhibits the effects of 
angiotensin II.  
This application concerns an extension of the indication and a line extension for adding a new 
pharmaceutical form in two strengths. Where the product was initially only authorised for adults, it will 
now be used in children from 1-18 years as well. The new pharmaceutical form is intended to facilitate 
dosing in younger children. 
The finished products are presented as capsules filled with 4 and 10 film-coated granules 
corresponding to strengths of 6 mg/6 mg (6.1 mg/6.4 mg) and 15 mg/16 mg (15.18 mg/16.07 mg) 
sacubitril/valsartan. The granule cores have the same composition as the commercial adult tablet, 
except for the disintegrant.
Bioavailability
The pivotal paediatric registration (Study CLCZ696B2319; B2319; Study 6 and 7) used three different 
formulations of sacubitril/valsartan: the approved FCT (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg); film-coated 
granules (3.125 mg); and extemporaneous liquid formulation prepared by using film-coated granules 
(3.125 mg) in Part 1 and using 100 mg FCT in Part 2, by using appropriate vehicles. To bridge the 
different formulations used in the pivotal paediatric trial, Novartis conducted in-vitro dissolution tests

and two relative bioavailability (rBA) studies. Study CLCZ696B2126 (Study B2126; study 5) evaluated 
the rBA of sacubitril/valsartan and its analytes following oral administration of 200 mg film-coated 
granules (64 × 3.125 mg) compared to the adult 200 mg (97/103 mg) FCT in healthy adult subjects 
under fasted conditions. Study CLCZ696F2130 (Study F2130) evaluated the rBA of sacubitril/valsartan 
oral extemporaneous liquid formulation (200 mg equivalent of 3.125 mg film-coated granules) 
compared to the adult 200 mg (97/103mg) FCT in healthy adult subjects.
The rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of sacubitril/valsartan film-coated granules absorption were similar 
to those of the commercially available 200 mg (97/103 mg) FCT, as the ratios of the geometric means 
fall in the bioequivalence boundary of 80-125%. The extemporaneous liquid formulation prepared from 
film-coated granules provided similar total exposure (AUC) of sacubitril/valsartan analytes (sacubitril, 
sacubitrilat, and valsartan) compared to the FCT. The peak concentrations (Cmax) were also similar 
between the extemporaneous liquid formulation and the FCT for the active sacubitril/valsartan analytes 
(sacubitrilat and valsartan).
The sacubitril/valsartan FCT and the film-coated granules formulations are largely similar in 
composition except for few differences (See Section 1.2.2), but both have been shown to provide 
similar BA (Study B2126). So, the preparation of the extemporaneous liquid formulation from either 
FCT or film-coated granules would be considered equivalent.
Soft food (vanilla pudding) had no significant effect on the BA, but the high-fat meal had an effect on 
the rate of absorption (Cmax) of sacubitril, sacubitrilat, and valsartan and the extent of absorption 
(AUCs) of valsartan (Study B2126). However, the effect of food on the PK of sacubitril/valsartan was 
comparable with previously reported results with the FCT. Hence, the food effect is independent of the 
formulation, and the food effect was considered clinically insignificant during the initial registration of 
sacubitril/valsartan. Accordingly, the three different formulations were administered without regard to 
meal in the current paediatric pivotal Phase III [Study B2319]. 
Pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population
Study B2319 was a 52-week randomized, two-part, double-blind, active-controlled paediatric clinical 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in paediatric 
patients 1 month to < 18 years of age with heart failure due to systemic left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction (LVSD). The study objectives and endpoints are described in [Study B2319-Section 8], and 
the study design is provided in [Study B2319-Section 9]. The study had 2 Parts. The 
sacubitril/valsartan doses used were 0.8 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg for Age Groups 1 and 2, and 0.4 mg/kg 
and 1.6 mg/kg for Age Group 3, as a single dose. The Age Group 3 dose was reduced considering the 
potential impact of developing the capacity of drug disposition in this very young age group on drug 
exposure.
There were 26 patients enrolled in Part 1 of the study: 9 patients in Age Group 1 (6 to <18 years), 9 
patients in Age Group 2 (1 to < 6 years), and 8 patients in Age Group 3 (1 month to < 1 year). Nine 
patients were in both Dose Cohort 1 and Dose Cohort 2; the remainder participated in one dose cohort. 
The results are presented below.

The primary objective of Part 2 was to determine whether sacubitril/valsartan was superior to enalapril 
for the treatment of HF as assessed using a global rank endpoint in paediatric HF patients. Pre-dose 
sparse samples were collected to determine if trough exposures at steady-state were comparable to

exposures in adults with heart failure in Study B2314. PK samples were obtained from 177 paediatric 
patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan. The results are presented below:

Page 27/132
Sacubitrilat and valsartan drug exposure in paediatric heart failure patients is similar to exposure in 
adult heart failure patients at the same dose (Age Groups 1 and 2), with the ratios of geometric means 
of drug exposure (AUC children /AUC adults) being 0.80-0.92 and 0.99-1.29 for sacubitrilat and 
valsartan, respectively. Age Group 3 shows corresponding AUC changes consistent with the dose 
change (50% dose reduction), with the ratios of geometric means of the drug exposure (AUC 
children/AUC adults) being 0.39 and 0.61 for sacubitrilat and valsartan, respectively. This was 
confirmed in Study B2314 part 2, where comparable steady-state trough exposures at the 
recommended target dose of sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg (200 mg) in adults and the equivalent 
weight-based target dose 1.51/1.59 mg/kg (3.1 mg/kg) in paediatric patients were found.
In general it was shown that sacubitril/valsartan PK in paediatric heart failure patients aged 1 month to 
<18 years old is similar to that in adult heart failure patients.
2.6.5.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Sacubitril is a prodrug that is in vivo converted to sacubitrilat via esterases. Sacubitrilat inhibits 
neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase that degrades vasoactive peptides. Sacubitrilat thereby increases 
the concentration of natriuretic peptides, causing blood vessel dilation and reduction of ECF volume via

sodium excretion. Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist and thereby inhibits the 
effects of angiotensin II.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology
Study B2319
Study B2319 was a 52-week randomized, two-part, double-blind, active-controlled paediatric clinical 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in paediatric 
patients 1 month to < 18 years of age with heart failure due to systemic left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction (LVSD). In Part 1 of the study, multiple pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints, including 
plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), plasma NT-proBNP (optional), plasma cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP), urine cGMP change from baseline geometric mean ratio (GMR) after single 
dose treatment were assessed. An exploratory endpoint in Part 2 was NT-proBNP change from baseline 
through 4, 12 and 52 weeks of treatment.
Part 1
The primary objective of Part 1 of Study B2319 was to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric HF patients after single-dose treatment. 
The PK data from the paediatric patients in Part 1 were used to select doses for the same age groups 
in Part 2 of the clinical trial. 
The  PK/PD results were evaluated for the original protocol-defined age groups: Age Group 1 (6 to <18 
years), Age Group 2 (1 to <6 years), and Age Group 3 (1 month to <1 year). The sacubitril/valsartan 
doses used were 0.8 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg for Age Groups 1 and 2, and 0.4 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg for 
Age Group 3. The dose for Age Group 3 dose was reduced considering the potential impact of 
developing the capacity of drug disposition in this very young age group on drug exposure.
A pharmacodynamic response to sacubitril/valsartan was observed for both plasma and urine cGMP in 
Age Group 1, which was dose-dependent (Table 4). In Age Group 2, urine cGMP results demonstrated 
a dose-response for the 0.8 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg, while an exposure-response was not observed in 
plasma cGMP. In Age Group 3, the increase in urine cGMP at the high dose of 1.6 mg/kg was in line 
with the urine cGMP findings for Age Groups 1 and 2.

Part 2
In Part 2 of Study B2319, a secondary objective was to characterize the population PK of 
sacubitril/valsartan exposure in paediatric patients with HF (n=375). In addition, an exploratory 
objective was to compare sacubitril/valsartan to enalapril on change in NT-proBNP from baseline to 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 29/132
Weeks 4, 12, and 52. The exposure-response of sacubitril/valsartan and NT-proBNP was also 
evaluated. Part 2 results are presented using the original Age Group 1 (6-<18 years) and modified Age 
Groups 2a (2-<6 years) and 3a (1 month-<2 years). Furthermore, the target dose was 3.1 mg/kg in 
patients aged 1 year and older and 2.3 mg/kg in a patient less than 1 year of age
The baseline NT-proBNP between adults (Study B2314) and paediatric patients (Study B2319) with HF 
were median 1222 ng/L vs 833 ng/L. However, when separated by specific paediatric age groups, Age 
Groups 2a and 3a appeared to have higher median baseline NT-proBNP than adults with HF. Off note, 
the physiological range of NT-proBNP is known to be higher in newborns and to decrease during 
childhood (Nir et al 2009).
The plasma NT-proBNP levels by dose group show a consistent decrease in NT-proBNP level with 
increasing sacubitril/valsartan dose, supporting a similar exposure-response in adult and paediatric 
patients with HF. Paediatric HF patients treated with the target dose of sacubitril/valsartan showed a 
comparable reduction in NT-proBNP as noted in adults (median 55% vs 28%), with a substantial 
overlap in distribution as displayed in the boxplots at Week 52 (Figure 1). Similar results were 
observed at Week 12 (Figure 2).

2.6.5.2.1.  Relationship between plasma concentration and effect
Exposure-response of steady-state effect of sacubitril/valsartan on plasma NT-proBNP
The PK/PD analysis showed comparable NT-proBNP reductions in paediatric and adult patients treated 
with sacubitril/valsartan, especially in the comparison of paediatric HF with adult patients with HFrEF 
due to DCM. The dose-exposure-response of sacubitril/valsartan and NT-proBNP appeared to be 
consistent between paediatric and adult patients with HF at their equivalent dose, with greater 
decreases in NT-proBNP in patients who received higher doses of sacubitril/valsartan Figure 4. There 
were larger NT-proBNP reductions in paediatric HF patients compared to the overall adult HF 
population in Study B2314. However, this difference was marginal when comparing paediatric HF 
patients to adults with HFrEF due to DCM. At 52 weeks in paediatrics and 8 months in adults, the ratio 
of NT-proBNP relative to baseline between paediatric HF patients (3.1 mg/kg) and adult HF patients 
(200 mg) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89), while when compared to adult HF patients with DCM it was 
0.94 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.2); with approximately 50% decrease from baseline. 
Taken together, the results of the PK/PD analysis support that a weight-based dose of 3.1 mg/kg in 
paediatric HF patients provides comparable NT-proBNP lowering (>50% decrease from baseline) and 
comparable sacubitril/valsartan trough exposures as in adult HFrEF patients at the equivalent target 
dose.

97/103 mg (200 mg) or equivalent weight-based dose 1.51/1.59 mg/kg (3.1 mg/kg) in paediatric HF 
patients provides greater NT-proBNP reduction (Figure 5 and Figure 6) when compared to the lower 
dose. The dose biomarker response across studies showed lower NT-proBNP levels with increased 
doses of sacubitril/valsartan and indicated comparable dose-response between paediatric and adult HF 
patients (Figure 6).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Entresto contains the active substances sacubitril and valsartan. The proposed beneficial effect of 
sacubitril is based on inhibiting the degradation of natriuretic peptides, increasing BNP. Natriuretic 
peptides exert their effects by activating membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase coupled receptors, 
resulting in increased concentrations of the second messenger, cGMP, which can be detected in plasma 
and urine. 
The PD effects of sacubitril/valsartan were evaluated in a 52-week randomized, two-part, double-blind, 
active-controlled paediatric clinical study in three age categories  (part 1: Age Group 1 (6 to <18 
years; n=9), Age Group 2 (1 to <6 years; n=9), and Age Group 3 (1 month to <1 year; n=8);  part 2: 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 34/132
Age Group 1 (6-<18 years) and modified Age Groups 2a (2-<6 years) and 3a (1 month-<2 years). The 
sacubitril/valsartan doses used were 0.8 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg for Age Groups 1 and 2, and 0.4 mg/kg 
and 1.6 mg/kg for Age Group 3.
In part 1 of study B2319, administration of sacubitril/valsartan resulted in increases in urinary cGMP in 
all age groups, which were dose-dependent. For plasma cGMP and plasma BNP, no clear dose-response 
effects were found. For age group 3, the Applicant states that a dose higher (2.3 mg/kg) than dose 
cohort 2 (1.6 mg/kg) was chosen after a review of data from part 1 by the FDA and DMC. From the 
summary of pharmacology, it is unclear how this choice was made. Since only an indication is sought 
for paediatric patients one year and older, this issue is not pursued.
Regarding pharmacodynamics in part 2 of study B2319, the PK/PD analysis showed comparable NT-
proBNP reductions in paediatric and adult patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan, especially in 
comparing paediatric HF patients with adult patients with HFrEF due to DCM. Based on plots of the 
dose-biomarker response of the NT-proBNP at steady-state, the applicant claimed that the effect was 
generally consistent between paediatric and adult HF patients, with larger decreases in NT-proBNP in 
patients who received higher doses of sacubitril/valsartan (up to 200 mg). No clear exposure-response 
relationship was shown. However, this was to be expected as both B2314 (PARADIGM-HF, adult 
population) and B2319 (PANORAMA-HF, pediatric population) studies were designed to achieve a 
target maintenance dose of 200 mg (B2314) and the equivalent dose of 3.1 mg/kg (B2319). As such, 
the ranges for the majority of sacubitrilat and valsartan PK concentrations are relatively narrow, and 
the exposure-response relationships are difficult to discern for both analytes.
2.6.7.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Administration of sacubitril/valsartan at the target dose in paediatric patients leads to a reduction in 
NT-proBNP at steady state, which appears larger than the NT-proBNP reduction in adult HF patients 
but similar to the NT-proBNP decrease in adult HF patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There 
appears to be a trend of larger NT-proBNP decreases at higher sacubitril/valsartan doses up to 200 
mg. However, no clear trend between exposure and response could be ascertained. In conclusion, 
there is a similar decrease in NT-proBNP between adult HF with DCM and paediatrics patients with HF 
when treated with an equivalent dose of sacubitril/valsartan.
2.6.8.  Clinical efficacy
The totality of evidence included in this submission supporting the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan for 
paediatric use includes 1) extrapolation of the existing adult HFrEF data from study B2314 
(PARADIGM-HF) to children based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from study 
B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) and 2) the clinical data provided by the PANORAMA-HF study.
2.6.8.1.  Extrapolation plan 
The extrapolation of sacubitril/valsartan efficacy from adults to the paediatric population
NT-proBNP is recognized as a prognostic biomarker for clinical outcomes in clinical trials in HF (Januzzi 
et al. 2019, Schmitt et al. 2021). NT-proBNP was used as a bridging biomarker for extrapolation from 
adults to the paediatric population in submission to the FDA based on an interim analysis of Week 12 
data, leading to approval in the US. Using the Prentice Criteria (Prentice 1989), Novartis investigated 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 35/132
the relationship between NT-proBNP over time and the change at Month 1 on top of baseline NT-
proBNP with the risk of CV death or HF hospitalization (Study B2314). This included the magnitude of 
the sacubitril/valsartan treatment effect on the clinical outcomes explained by post-randomization 
change from baseline in NT-proBNP over time.
The extrapolation of sacubitril/valsartan efficacy from adults to the paediatric population is predicated 
on the following principles, as outlined in the draft ICH E11A guideline:

Disease similarity 
Similar drug pharmacology (exposure) 
Similar exposure response 
Predictive biomarker to bridge efficacy between adult and paediatric populations
Given the similarity between paediatric HF due to LVSD and adult HFrEF with DCM, the similar 
exposure between adult and paediatric HF populations, the similar magnitude of NT-proBNP reductions 
at exposure-matched doses of sacubitril/valsartan, and the association of NT-proBNP changes from 
baseline with clinical outcomes, the Applicant claimed that extrapolation from adult data using the 
predictive NT-proBNP marker is a reasonable approach to infer clinical efficacy in the paediatric HF 
population.
2.6.8.1.1.  Disease similarity 
Pediatric heart failure can be due to a variety of etiologies, pathophysiologies and morphologies. 
Morphologies include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive 
cardiomyopathy (RCM), LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNCM). It is estimated that DCM 
characterizes approximately 50% of pediatric HF, 35 to 50% by HCM and < 5% by RCM. LVNCM 
accounts for approximately 5% of cases.
Despite the difference in etiologies between paediatric and adult HF, there are important common 
clinical features between adult HFrEF patients with DCM and paediatric HF patients with LVSD 
consistent with DCM. The major morphologic feature in both populations is dilatation of both ventricles 
(Dec and Fuster 1994). In both paediatric and adult HF, due to systolic dysfunction, there is a decrease 
in systemic cardiac output. The pathophysiologic adaptation to decreased cardiac output in both adult 
and paediatric HF involves increased sympathetic tone and activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) (Momma 2006). In addition, also similar to adult HF, paediatric HF results 
in increased activation of the natriuretic peptide system (Favilli et al. 2009). This pathophysiologic 
neurohumoral activation plays a key role in the progression of HF due to systolic dysfunction in adults 
and children, and this is why the clinical course and HF management in this paediatric HF subset with 
systemic LVSD is similar to adult HFrEF with DCM. In addition, both populations have similar physical 
signs and symptoms. These similarities have been highlighted in the draft ICH E11A 2022 guideline "... 
heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy is similar between adult and paediatric populations, 
allowing for extrapolation from adult to paediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy". 
Similarities have also been noted concerning disease progression between paediatric and adult HF 
patients with DCM. The Ventricular Volume Variability study (VVV), designed by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-funded Paediatric Heart Network, was a longitudinal observational 
study of children with known or suspected DCM ages 0 to 22 years from 8 paediatric clinical centres. 
Clinical data were collected together with 150 echocardiographic indices of left ventricle (LV) size and 
function. Of a total of 275 subjects with known or suspected DCM, 194 were eligible for the initial 
screening echocardiogram, 173 (89%) consented to participation and underwent data recording, and 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 36/132
131 were confirmed to have chronic DCM (Colan et al 2012). In 127 chronic DCM patients with 
prospective echocardiographic and clinical data collected during the 18-month follow-up, factors that 
were found to be predictors of disease progression included age at diagnosis, echocardiographic 
evidence of larger LV size and impaired systolic and diastolic function (Molina et al 2013). Clinical 
progression was similar between paediatric patients in the VVV study and PARADIGM-HF patients ≤ 40 
years old with DCM treated with enalapril. 
PANORAMA-HF aimed to enrol a homogeneous population of pediatric HF with left ventricle systolic 
dysfunction (LVSD) consistent with DCM. HCM and RCM, along with uncorrected structural heart 
disease and single ventricle or systemic right ventricle, were excluded. Enrolment of a homogeneous 
pediatric HF population with LVSD consistent with DCM in PANORAMA-HF was thus achieved by 
defining a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria, ensuring all patients had symptomatic HF and 
HFrEF is defined as LVSD in pediatric patients. 
More than 60% of patients in PANORAMA-HF were diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, with the cause 
being idiopathic in 33.6%, followed by familial/genetic conditions in 15.7% and congenital heart 
malformations in 13.3%. Heart failure secondary to other causes was noted in about 35% of patients. 
In those 35% of patients where the etiology of HF was not primarily identified as related to 
cardiomyopathy, it is known from the literature that all can evolve into or manifest as DCM. In 
particular, the most frequent cause was myocarditis-induced HF, which is the most common cause of 
acquired DCM in children.
In PANORAMA-HF, while there was no collection of echocardiographic data regarding ventricle volumes 
or diameters to confirm a diagnosis of DCM, all diseases included are known to evolve or manifest as 
DCM. Additionally, patients with restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were excluded. 
Nonetheless, as recommended by treatment guidelines, the treatment of heart failure in children is 
based on pathophysiology, hence based on systolic vs. diastolic dysfunction and based on approved 
adult HFrEF therapies.
PANORAMA-HF evaluated a relatively homogeneous population with biventricular hearts and 
symptomatic HF due to a systemic left ventricle with decreased ejection fraction. All diseases included 
are known to possibly evolve or manifest as DCM. Such an approach resulted in a patient population 
that resembles the adult HF population with DCM. In conclusion, all patients enrolled in PANORAMA-HF 
were diagnosed with LVSD, while patients with HCM, RCM, and complex congenital heart disease with 
functional single ventricle or systemic right ventricle were excluded. Despite the lack of LV diameter 
measurement, the literature and clinical practice support that all enrolled pediatric patients with 
systemic LVSD had a form of DCM. Furthermore, both adult HFrEF with DCM and pediatric HF due to 
LVSD have similar pathophysiology, including a reduced cardiac output due to left ventricle 
insufficiency, which causes reduced organ perfusion, increased adrenergic tone, and RAAS activation. 
2.6.8.1.2.  Similar drug pharmacology (exposure) 
Part 1 of study B2319 showed that sacubitrilat and valsartan drug exposure in paediatric HF patients is 
similar to exposure in adult heart HF at the same dose (Age Groups 1 and 2) with the ratios of 
geometric means of drug exposure (AUC children /AUC adults) being 0.80-0.92 and 0.99 1.29 for 
sacubitrilat and valsartan, respectively. Age Group 3 showed corresponding AUC changes consistent 
with the dose change (dose was initially 50% reduced considering the potential impact of developing 
the capacity of drug disposition), with the ratios of geometric means of the drug exposure (AUC 
children/AUC adults) being 0.39 and 0.61 for sacubitrilat and valsartan, respectively. Described in 
more detail in the pharmacokinetic section.

2.6.8.1.3.  Similar exposure response 
Part 1 of study B2319 showed a similar magnitude of NT-proBNP reductions at exposure-matched 
doses of sacubitril/valsartan. The ratio of NT-proBNP relative to baseline between paediatric HF 
patients (3.1 mg/kg) and adult HF patients (200 mg) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89), while when 
compared to adult HF patients with DCM, it was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.2); with approximately 50% 
decrease from baseline. This subject is described in more detail in the pharmacodynamic section, as 
well as under the following section. 
2.6.8.1.4.  NT-proBNP as bridging biomarker for extrapolation of efficacy 
NT-proBNP has been increasingly recognized as an important biomarker in heart failure and is 
correlated with clinical outcomes.  It is therefore proposed as a bridging biomarker between paediatric 
HF patients and adult patients with DCM to support extrapolation of efficacy.  The Prentice criteria 
(Prentice 1989) provide a systematic framework to establish the adequacy of NT-proBNP as a bridging 
biomarker. This includes the demonstration that:

The effect of treatment on the true clinical endpoint is explained by the biomarker
Prentice criteria 1: The treatment has a significant impact on the true clinical endpoint
As reflected in the approved SmPC, in Study B2314 in adult HFrEF (FAS: N=8399), sacubitril/valsartan 
was superior to enalapril, reducing the risk of CV death or HF hospitalizations to 21.8% compared to 
26.5% for enalapril treated patients. The absolute risk reductions were 4.7% for the composite of the 
CV death or HF hospitalization, 3.1% for CV death alone, and 2.8% for first HF hospitalization alone. 
The relative risk reduction was 20% versus enalapril. This effect was observed early and was sustained 
throughout the duration of the study. Both components contributed to the risk reduction. Sudden 
death accounted for 45% of cardiovascular deaths and was reduced by 20% in sacubitril/valsartan-
treated patients compared to enalapril-treated patients (HR 0.80, p=0.0082). Pump failure accounted 
for 26% of cardiovascular deaths and was reduced by 21% in sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients 
compared to enalapril-treated patients (HR 0.79, p=0.0338) (Entresto SmPC).  The benefit of 
sacubitril/valsartan was also shown for the subgroup of patients with HFrEF with DCM (N=1810), with 
a 25% relative risk reduction in CV death/HF hospitalization (p=0.0040) compared to enalapril. Data 
from B2314, therefore, meet the first criteria for both the overall HFrEF population and the DCM 
subgroup. 
Prentice criteria 2: The treatment has a significant impact on the biomarker
In the biomarker substudy of study B2314 (N=2080), the HR (sacubitril/valsartan /enalapril) adjusted 
for baseline NT-ProBNP was 0.82 (95% CI 0.68, 0.98; p=0.0279) and sacubitril/valsartan treatment 
had a significant impact on NT-proBNP. The ratio of NT-proBNP to baseline levels was approximately 
25% lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group as compared to the enalapril group both at Month 1 (Ratio: 
sacubitril and valsartan/enalapril 0.7376, 95% CI 0.6985 to 0.7789)  and at Month 8 (Ratio: 0.7524, 
95% CI 0.7003 to 0.8084)  post-randomization (both p<0.0001).
In the subgroup of adult patients with HFrEF with DCM, the reduction in NT-proBNP from baseline was 
43% at Month 1, and 52% at Month 8 (Table 5). These data show that in the overall adult HFrEF

population as well as in those with DCM, sacubitril/valsartan had a significant impact on the biomarker 
visible as early as 1 month and fulfils the 2nd Prentice criteria.

Prentice criteria 3: The biomarker is significantly associated with true clinical endpoint 
Data in adult HFrEF demonstrate that longitudinal changes in NT-proBNP levels (measured by either 
absolute, relative or categorical changes) are highly predictive of risk for clinical outcomes, including 
mortality and hospitalization. This raises the perspective of utilizing changes in NT-proBNP to predict a 
drug’s treatment effect.
Recent data from the Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment (GUIDE 
IT) trial looking at NT-proBNP guided therapy vs usual care to achieve an NT-proBNP level <1000 
pg/mL in HF patients with reduced EF and elevated NT-proBNP levels at baseline, showed a clear 
correlation between achieved NT-proBNP levels at 90 days and clinical outcomes (Januzzi et al 2019).

Figure 7. GUIDE-IT: Number of events per 100 patient years
An analysis of 1742 patients from the placebo-arm of the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT), a 
multicenter, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 5,010 patients with 
LVEF <40% revealed a progressive increase in the rate of all-cause mortality in relation to the increase 
in NT-proBNP analyzed in quartiles from baseline to 4 months with the rate of all-cause mortality more 
than doubling from 9.2% to 21.5% between the lowest and the highest quartile. The analysis of 
categorical changes in NT-proBNP reinforced these findings: patients whose NT-proBNP was “high” (i.e. 
above the optimal prognostic cutoff value (1078 pg/mL) at baseline and after 4 months had a nearly 
two-fold increased risk for subsequent all-cause-mortality compared to those patients with NT-proBNP 
values that were low at both time points. In addition, those whose values started high at baseline but 
fell below the threshold after 4 months had a risk for all-cause mortality similar to those who started 
and remained “low” (Masson et al. 2008).
Similar results were reported from the study B2314 biomarker sub-study in 2080 patients (Zile et al. 
2016). In an analysis of the primary endpoint for B2314 (CV death and HF hospitalization) starting 1-
month after randomization, the change of NT-proBNP from baseline to 1-month was a highly significant 
predictor of clinical outcomes. Median NT-proBNP at baseline was 1269 (IQR: 762 to 2184) pg/mL for 
enalapril-treated patients and 1303 (IQR: 781 to 2371) pg/mL for sacubitril/valsartan treated patients. 
The median NT-proBNP did not change significantly during the enalapril run-in but decreased 
significantly during the sacubitril/valsartan run-in. One month after randomization, NT-proBNP was 
significantly lower in the sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients (938 [IQR: 511 to 1595] pg/mL) 
compared with enalapril treated patients (1203 [IQR: 711 to 2,061] pg/mL; p <0.001). After 
adjustment for baseline NT-proBNP, the HR per doubling of NT-proBNP at 1 month was 1.46 (95% CI: 
1.30 to 1.64), whereas the HR per halving of NT-proBNP at 1 month was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61 to 0.77). 
In summary, a change in plasma NT-proBNP post-randomization is associated with the CV mortality/HF 
hospitalization rate in adult patients with HFrEF. Whether looking at absolute, relative or categorical 
changes in NT-proBNP, reductions have been shown to be associated with a significantly lower 
morbidity and mortality rate, fulfilling the 3rd Prentice criteria.

Additional data supporting the third prentice criteria:
As shown in Table 6, baseline NT-proBNP levels and change from baseline in post-baseline NT-proBNP 
are significantly associated with the risk of clinical events in both paediatric and adult HF patients.
In adults with HFrEF, a doubling of NT-proBNP levels at baseline or at post-baseline were both 
associated with a 1.6-fold increase in the risk of clinical events (composite endpoint of CV death/HF 
hospitalization).
The results were similar for the subpopulation of adults with HFrEF with DCM, where a doubling of NT-
proBNP levels at baseline or post-baseline was associated, respectively, with a 1.6-fold and 1.5-fold 
increase in the risk of clinical events. 
The association between NT-proBNP and risk of clinical events was similarly observed in paediatric 
patients: in study B2319, a doubling of NT-proBNP levels at baseline or post-baseline was associated, 
respectively, with a 1.8-fold and 2.1-fold increase of the risk of Category 1 or 2 events (Table 6). The 
applicant also performed sensitivity analyses that demonstrated that these analyses were not driven by 
outliers, supporting the robustness of the data. Results from study B2314 and study B2319 show a 
very similar association between the NT-proBNP level and changes in NT-proBNP to the risk of clinical 
outcomes events, including CV death and HF hospitalization in adult HFrEF patients with DCM and 
paediatric HF patients with LVSD. This supports the equal predictive value of NT-proBNP across the 2 
populations

The robustness of these analyses was improved by also performing analyses using slope rather than 
change from baseline. These analyses include an additional Cox’s proportional hazards analysis with an 
average slope of available changes from baseline in log2(NT-proBNP), i.e., changes in log2(NT-proBNP) 
divided by time interval in a year as a covariate, and a Cox’s proportional hazards analysis with slopes 
of log2(NT-proBNP), again, changes divided by the time interval in year, as a time-dependent 
covariate. Both analyses showed similar strong positive associations (p<0.01) between the hazards for 
Category 1 and/or Category 2 events and the slope of log2(NT-proBNP); see Table 7 and Table 8.

Prentice criteria 4: The effect of treatment on true clinical endpoint is explained by the biomarker 
The majority of the sacubitril/valsartan treatment effect on the time to the first event of CV death or 
HF hospitalization endpoint is captured or explained by NT-proBNP over time. The proportion of 
treatment effect explained on top of baseline NT-ProBNP was 85.55%, with the 95% CI (6.35%, 
164.76%) excluding zero (Table 9).
Change from baseline in NT-proBNP, when adjusted for baseline NT-proBNP and treatment, was 
significantly associated with the risk of the true clinical endpoint (first event of CV death or HF 
hospitalization) with an HR of 1.59 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.75) for doubling post-baseline NT-proBNP (vs no 
change), respectively an HR of 0.825 (95% CI 0.793 to 0.860) for 25% reduction of post-baseline NT-
proBNP.

after randomization, the change of NT-proBNP from baseline to Month 1 was a highly significant 
predictor of clinical outcomes. Table 10 demonstrates that the treatment effect of sacubitril/valsartan

A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the PTE reported in the original 
submission using structural equation modelling and counterfactual methods. For this purpose, an Aalen 
additive hazard model (Lange and Hansen 2011) was performed using the same PARADIGM-HF 
(B2314) data. The outcome variable is the time to the first event of CV death or HF hospitalization, the 
mediator variable is the change from baseline to month one in log2(NT-proBNP), and the exposure 
variable is the indicator of treatment (sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril). Table 11 shows the percent 
contribution of the natural indirect effect from NT-proBNP relative change to the total effect: 81.4% 
(CI:24.7% to 509.3%), which is very close to the result of 82.5% (CI:1.26% to 164%) obtained with 
the “change in coefficients” method described above.

The assessment of the utility of NT-proBNP as a predictive marker of clinical outcome response with 
sacubitril/valsartan was repeated for various subgroups of HF aetiology in study B2314 to explore the 
consistency of the relationship across these subgroups and quantify the amount of treatment effect 
explained by NT-proBNP over time on top of baseline. In summary, following sacubitril/valsartan 
treatment, the relationship between NT-proBNP changes and clinical outcome, including the predictive 
value of NT-proBNP changes on outcomes, appears consistent across various aetiology subgroups.  It 
is noted that due to reduced sample sizes, power becomes small and the focus should be on directional 
consistency rather than statistical significance. Results are summarized in Table 12. 
Importantly, neutralization of the treatment effect for sacubitril/valsartan is observed after accounting 
for NT-proBNP change over time following treatment administration (HR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.17, 
p=0.7545); All patients, Model 2) Also of note, in the DCM subgroup, the % change in NT-proBNP at 
Month 1 for sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril was 38%. These analyses show that the biomarker largely 
explains the sacubitril/valsartan treatment effect on clinical outcome, supporting the 4th Prentice 
criteria.  Taken together, these data support the relevance and appropriateness of NT-proBNP as a 
bridging biomarker for the extrapolation of efficacy benefits with sacubitril/valsartan between adults 
with HFrEF due to DCM and paediatric HF patients with LVSD. 
The following sections focus on comparing the available data on NT-proBNP from study B2314 and 
study B2319 in support of extrapolating the efficacy benefits to a DCM population.

2.6.8.1.5.  Summaries of the extrapolation plan
In summary, the applicant has demonstrated disease similarity between paediatric HF due to systemic 
LVSD and adult HFrEF with DCM. The applicant has demonstrated similar drug exposure at the target 
dose in both paediatric and adult populations. And the applicant has demonstrated that in both adult 
and paediatric populations, NT-proBNP demonstrates a large and comparable decrease during 
sacubitril/valsartan treatment. Using the Prentice criteria, the applicant has shown data supporting the 
use of NT-proBNP as a biomarker for bridging data from adult to paediatric patients.
To this end, the results demonstrate that sacubitril/valsartan treatment decreases NT-proBNP levels, 
and this reduction reliably predicts clinical benefits in both adult and paediatric HF patients. Based on 
the similar NT-proBNP reductions, similar exposure-response and similar associations with favourable 
clinical response in both paediatric and adult HF populations, the paediatric population is expected to 
experience the same benefits of sacubitril/valsartan as observed in adults. 
Large decreases in NT-proBNP were observed in both treatment groups in study B2319. While the 
treatment difference between sacubitril/valsartan to enalapril in NT-proBNP change from baseline in 
study B2319 did not replicate what was observed in study B2314, the magnitude of change from 
baseline within the sacubitril/valsartan arm was similar to what was observed in study B2314 in adult 
HFrEF patient with DCM (Table 13). The similar large reduction in NT-proBNP from baseline, in the 
context of its established clinical relevance in both populations, provides a reasonable basis to 
extrapolate and infer clinical benefits in paediatric HF patients with LVSD.

14.2-8.3]
2.6.8.2.  Dose response studies
No specific dose-response studies were performed. Part 1 of study B2319 was used for dose-finding 
and is detailed below. 
The doses for study B2319 part 2 were based on results from B2319 part 1. The paediatric dose 
selection for Part 2 of Study B2319 was based on the evaluation of safety, PK and PD response from 
Part 1 in children and adolescents following administration of single doses of sacubitril/valsartan: 0.8 
mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg for patients 1 year of age and above, and 0.4 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg for patients 
1 month to <1 year old. The objective was to select a dose for Part 2 that provided similar exposures 
of sacubitril and valsartan to that observed in adult HF patients and that also maximized neprilysin 
inhibition. The PD effect of neprilysin inhibition was assessed through urine and plasma biomarkers.
Selection of doses for Study B2319 Part 1
The starting dose of sacubitril/valsartan of 0.8 mg/kg corresponds to the sacubitril/valsartan 50 mg 
dose for adults with a body weight of 65 kg. It delivers valsartan exposure equivalent to 0.6 mg/kg 
using valsartan formulation, which is below the starting dose for valsartan in paediatric hypertension 
(1.3 mg/kg). The target sacubitril/valsartan dose of 3.1 mg/kg corresponds to the sacubitril/valsartan 
200 mg dose in adults of 65 kg. In adult HF patients, no significant impact of body weight on the PK of 
sacubitril/valsartan analytes was observed over a range of 41.5-157.3 kg; therefore, paediatric 
patients in this weight range, exposure was expected to be similar to that observed in adult HF 
patients. Furthermore, simulations using physiological-based PK models and allometric scaling 
techniques indicated similar exposure between paediatric HF patients >1 year of age and adult HF 
patients at an equivalent dose of sacubitril/valsartan.
The single doses for children aged 1 month to < 1 year (Age Group 3) were reduced by 50% to 0.4 
mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg, taking into consideration the potential impact of developing capacity of drug 
disposition in this age group on drug exposure.
Selection of doses for Study B2319 Part 2
Results from Part 1 of the study showed that the PK of sacubitril/valsartan following single-dose 
administration in Age Groups 1 and 2 are similar to the adult HF population based on approximately 
dose-proportional exposure increase, observed sacubitril T1/2, apparent total body plasma clearance 
for both sacubitril and valsartan, and drug exposure. Accordingly, a target dose of 3.1 mg/kg 
sacubitril/valsartan was selected for patients in Age Groups 1 and 2 with a maximum dose of 200 mg.
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 48/132
For Age Group 3 (1 month to <1 year), the mean exposure (AUC changes) of sacubitrilat and valsartan 
following a 1.6 mg/kg single dose were, respectively, 61% and 39% lower than the steady-state 
exposure in adults following sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg bid. The target dose for this age group was 
increased from the originally planned 1.6 mg/kg to 2.3 mg/kg to better match the exposures in adults 
and older paediatric patients.
2.6.8.3.  Main study
Part 2 of study B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) is the pivotal source of data to support the proposed indication. 
Study B2319 is a Multicenter, open-label, study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and, 
pharmacodynamics of LCZ696 followed by a 52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active-

Treatments
This study uses a seamless design which consists of two parts (Figure 10).
Part 1: This was an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a low and a high 
dose strength of sacubitril/valsartan in the following age groups: Age Group 1: 6 to <18 years; Age 
Group 2: 1 to <6 years; and Age Group 3: 1 month to <1 year. To ensure that patients are enrolled in 
both high and low end of the 6 to < 18 years of age group, approximately 50% patients will be 
enrolled who are 6 to 11 years of age in Group 1. 
Part 2: This was a randomized, double blind, parallel-group, active controlled, 52-week study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LCZ696 compared to enalapril in paediatric HF patients 
(1 month to < 18 years). A screening epoch of up to 3 weeks will be used to assess eligibility. Roughly 
360 eligible patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (LCZ696 vs enalapril) and 
continue treatment for 52 weeks duration. 
Rationale for treatment duration
The rationale for the 52-week treatment duration is based on the positive LCZ696 treatment
effect for relevant clinical endpoints that were evident as early as 4 to 6 months treatment
duration in the LCZ696 adult PARADIGM-HF study. The 52-week treatment duration will also
increase the number of clinical events in Categories 1 and 2.



There was a sustained separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves as early as 6 months for
the primary composite endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death and time to first HF 
hospitalization.
At four months compared to baseline, there was less worsening of HF symptoms and physical 
limitations compared to enalapril as measured by the KCCQ (p=0.0423).
At four months, there were more improved patients with the Global Assessment, and fewer 
worsened patients for both NYHA and the Global Assessment for the LCZ696 group compared 
to the enalapril group (NYHA, p=0.0028; Global Assessment, p=0.0039).

PART 1
PART 2
Enalapril is considered the standard of care in the treatment of chronic HF in most geographic areas 
(Stidham et al 2021). Enalapril doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/day are used in the treatment of 
paediatric HF (Das 2018). The enalapril study medication was available in two formulations: tablets or 
liquid formulation. The liquid formulation was not a commercially available formulation, but instead a 
compounded formulation, which was made using 10 mg enalapril tablets. The concentration of the 
liquid enalapril formulation was 1 mg/ml (compounded using 20 tablets in 200ml). The dose of 0.4 
mg/kg/day was the target dose in the “Enalapril in infants with single ventricle” study published (Hsu 
et al. 2010), and is the target dose in the ongoing “The labelling of enalapril from neonates up to 
adolescents”, or LENA initiative sponsored by the European Commission (http://www.lena-med.eu). In 
addition, enalapril has a twice-daily dosing regimen similar to sacubitril/valsartan. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following double-blind treatments:
Sacubitril/valsartan: Projected target dose was 3.1 mg/kg bid for patients 1 year of age and older 
3.125 mg granules, 50 mg tablets, 100 mg tablets, 200 mg tablets or liquid formulation. For 
patients less than 1 year of age, the target dose was 2.3 mg/kg bid. Patients who turned 1 year 
old during the study could be further up-titrated to a dose of 3.1 mg/kg bid. The study used three 
different formulations, e.g. film-coated tablets (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg), film-coated 
granules (3.125 mg), and extemporaneous suspension prepared by using 100 mg film-coated 
tablets using appropriate vehicles.
Enalapril: Target dose was 0.2 mg/kg bid for patients 1 year of age and older. For patients less than 
1 year of age, the target dose was 0.15 mg/kg bid. Patients who turned 1 year old during the 
study could be further up-titrated to a dose of 0.2 mg/kg bid. For this, the study uses 2.5 mg, 5 
mg and 10 mg tablets and liquid formulation. 
Participants in age group 1 and 2 will start on a dose of 0.8 mg/kg or 1.6 mg/kg (dose level 1 or 2, 
depending on prior usage of ACEi or ARB and corresponding dose). Study drug is titrated every two 
weeks with a target dose of 3.1 mg/kg (dose level 4). 
Participants in age group 3 will start on a dose of 0.8 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg (dose level 1 or 2, 
depending on prior usage of ACEi or ARB and corresponding dose). Study drug is titrated every two 
weeks with a target dose of 2.3 mg/kg (dose level 4).
A summarized schedule is found in Table 14 and Table 15, the adult formulation is used by patients 
≥ 57 kg.

All paediatric formulations of study medication (sacubitril/valsartan granules or liquid, enalapril liquid) 
were made available to all age groups. The adult tablet formulations of sacubitril/valsartan and 
enalapril were available to patients based on the patient’s dose level, weight and ability to swallow 
adult tablets.
The proportion of patients with at least one down titration was low and similar in both 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (10.16% and 9.04%, respectively). The most common reason 
for down titration was AE (8.02% and 6.91%, respectively). 
Outcomes/endpoints
The objectives/endpoint of part 2 study B2319 are presented in Table 16. The Global Rank endpoint 
used in study B2319 was a composite endpoint integrating clinical outcomes, patients' function, 
symptoms and quality of life in a hierarchical way from worst to best. This approach leverages a 
broader scope of data from the trial compared to trials in adult HF to compensate for the challenges of 
powering a trial in paediatric HF.

Sample size
The assumed underlying probabilities for each category of the primary endpoint in Part 2 (Efficacy) 
were acquired using data from the Carvedilol Paediatric HF study data. Sample size calculations for the 
ordered categorical test (ordered categorical Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon rank sum test) were determined 
using nQuery. A sample size of 180 patients per group (360 patients total) will provide at least 80% 
power for a test of the primary endpoint. The actual sample size turned out to be 375 (N=187 
sacubitril/valsartan; N=188 enalapril).
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
At Visit 401, all eligible patients will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one 
of the treatment arms. Patients will be stratified by age group (Age Groups 1, 2 and 3) and NYHA/Ross 
class group (Class I/II, Class III/IV) at randomization to ensure a balanced distribution of treatment 
allocation within each age strata. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will 
be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first 
package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be 
communicated to the caller. The randomization scheme for patients will be reviewed and approved by 
a member of the Randomization Group.
Patients, investigators and staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain 
blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock. 
Statistical methods
The primary endpoint comparing the distributions for patients receiving LCZ696 and patients 
receiving enalapril will be assessed using a stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis (Kawaguchi 
2011), stratifying by modified age group (Group 1: 6 to < 18 years; Group 2a: 2 to < 6 years; 
Group 3a: 1 month to < 2 years) and NYHA/Ross class group (Class I/II; Class III/IV). The 
overall significance level (Type 1 error) of 0.05 (2-sided) will be used. In addition, the 
proportion of patients falling into each of the 5 ordered categories of the primary endpoint will 
be presented by treatment group. These proportions will be provided both hierarchically (only 
the worst category counted for each patient), as the endpoint is defined, and overall, not accounting 
for whether a patient also had a worse event. A full analysis set will be used for these analyses.

EMA/172209/2023
Page 54/132
In addition, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be provided by
treatment group for each age group, each modified age group, and for overall. 
The time to event endpoints will be analyzed using Cox’s proportional hazards model with 
treatment as a fixed-effect factor stratified by modified age group (Group 1: 6 to < 18 years; 
Group 2a: 2 to < 6 years; Group 3a: 1 month to < 2 years). The estimated hazards ratio and the 
corresponding two-sided confidence interval will be provided
NYHA/Ross class and PGIS will be compared for LCZ696 and enalapril at week 52,
respectively. Change from baseline at week 52 for these assessments will be analyzed based on 
a proportional cumulative odds model, stratified by modified age group (Group 1: 6 to < 18 
years; Group 2a: 2 to < 6 years; Group 3a: 1 month to < 2 years) in which treatment will be 
included as fixed-effect factors and baseline value as a covariate. The treatment comparison 
between LCZ696 and enalapril for the secondary objective is to be made at week 52. This 
model assumes that the treatment effect sizes across measurement categories are the same. The 
effect size estimates and their 95% confidence intervals will also be provided.
Based on the full analysis set, the PedsQL assessment will be compared for LCZ696 and 
enalapril after 52 weeks of double-blind treatment. PedsQL value changed from baseline will 
be analyzed based on a repeated measures ANCOVA model stratified by modified age group
(Group 1: 6 to < 18 years; Group 2a: 2 to < 6 years; Group 3a: 1 month to < 2 years). Treatment, 
visit (Week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 visits), and treatment-by-visit interaction will be included as fixed-
effect factors and baseline value as a covariate, with a common unstructured covariance matrix 
among visits for each treatment group. The estimated between and within treatment effects with 
the associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals at week 52 will be provided.
PGIC value (reflecting changes from baseline) will be analyzed by the same approach as used 
for PGIS, excluding baseline as a covariate in the model.
NTproBNP in this exploratory analysis will be analyzed on the full analysis set using the same 
method as other biomarkers. The changes from baseline in log(NTproBNP) will be analyzed using a 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), in which the response variable will be the changes from 
baseline in log(NTproBNP); modified age group (Group 1: 6 to < 18 years; Group 2a: 2 to < 6 years; 
Group 3a: 1 month to < 2 years), treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction will be included as 
fixed-effect factors; baseline log(NTproBNP) and visit-by-baseline interactions will be included as 
covariates; the within-patient covariance will be modelled using an unstructured covariance matrix (a 
common matrix for the two treatment groups). Based on the MMRM model, the estimates and the two-
sided 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the adjusted geometric means for the ratio to 
baseline in NTproBNP at Week 12 and Week 52 in each of the two treatment groups (LCZ696 and 
Enalapril), and for the ratio of the adjusted geometric means (LCZ696 / Enalapril).
Time to recurrent events of Category 1 and Category 2 will be analyzed using the proportional rates 
model (LWYY, Lin et al. 2000), with treatment as a fixed effect factor, stratified by modified age group 
(Group 1: 6 to < 18 years; Group 2a: 2 to < 6 years; Group 3a: 1 month to < 2 years). The estimated 
rate ratio and the corresponding two-sided confidence interval will be provided.
Results
Participant disposition and numbers analyzed
Out of 420 patients that signed written consent, a total of 43 discontinued prior to pre-randomization 
completion, of which 32 were screen failures. 377 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 
sacubitril/valsartan (N=187) or enalapril (N=190) (Table 17). Two patients were mis-randomized (did 
not receive any study medication) and therefore excluded from the FAS.

Page 55/132
The majority of patients in both treatment arms (90% in the sacubitril/valsartan arm and 86% in the 
enalapril arm) completed the double-blind epoch. The most frequent reason for discontinuation in both 
arms was death (4% vs 6% in the sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril arms, respectively).

The proportion of patients who completed double-blind treatment was 78.07% in the 
sacubitril/valsartan arm, and 72.63% in the enalapril arm (Table 18). In both arms, the most frequent 
reason for discontinuation of study treatment was AE (10.70% vs 11.05% for sacubitril/valsartan vs 
enalapril, respectively). Twenty patients (10 in each arm) discontinued study treatment following the 
implementation of the urgent safety measure (USM), described under study conduct section below.

enalapril group were on target dose level 4. The percentage of patients who reached dose level 4 at least 
once at any time point was 76.5% (143/187) for sacubitril/valsartan and 81.9% (154/188) for enalapril. 
Conduct of the study
Urgent safety measure
An out of specification (OOS) result for an unspecified degradation product (observed: 0.3% vs 
requirement: ≤ 0.2%) for both enalapril maleate 5 mg and 10 mg, packaged in alu-alu blisters by 
Novartis for this clinical trial, was observed in representative batches during supportive stability 
testing. As a result, the assigned shelf-life of 24 months of enalapril 5 mg and 10 mg in alu-alu blisters 
can no longer be supported for the current batches in use in the study and only a shelf-life of 12 
months and 18 months, respectively, is supported. This finding impacts the batches currently in use in 
the trial of enalapril 5 mg and 10 mg as well as one batch of enalapril 5 mg and 10 mg used earlier in 
the study. The current clinical trial supply of enalapril 5 mg is beyond the revised supported 12-month 
shelf-life (expiry date was 31 March 2021). The current supply of enalapril 10 mg has a revised 
supported expiry date of 18 months, lasting up to 31 October 2021. The finding only relates to 
enalapril 5 mg and 10 mg in alu-alu blister packs. The placebo of enalapril 5 mg and 10 mg, as well as 
all LCZ696/placebo and Enalapril/placebo 2.5 mg, are not impacted.
What follows outlines the safety measures that have been implemented for the 31 patients who 
were ongoing and receiving study medication at the time the USM was initiated. The USM includes the 
following:




Investigational medicinal product (IMP) dispensation was blocked. 
All patients who were receiving study medication at the time the USM was initiated had to 
discontinue study treatment by 31 October 2021 and change to local standard of care, 
respecting any required washout periods. These patients were to attend an unscheduled visit at 
the site by 31 October 2021, or as soon as possible thereafter, for safety and efficacy 
assessments.
It was requested that all patients return IMP in their possession by 31 October 2021.
All IMP is to be removed from the sites for destruction per local practices.
For patients who were receiving study medication with an end-of-study visit originally planned for after
14 November 2021, were instructed to come to the study site for an unscheduled visit (or regularly 
scheduled visit) by 31 October 2021. During this visit, study medication was discontinued, patients 
were transferred to local standard of care, and additional data was assessed (Lab + clinical data).  
These patients were continued to be followed in the trial until the planned end of study visit (week 52 
± 2 weeks).
The early study drug discontinuation affects a maximum of 31 patients who were on-treatment as of 
26 October 2021, with a current follow-up between 297 days to 395 days. The total on-treatment 
follow-up time lost is expected to be <1%. Regarding CRF documentation, the reason for the 
treatment discontinuation is to be reported on the End of Treatment (EOT) CRF as ‘Technical 
problems’. If a patient withdraws from study participation after the study drug discontinuation due to 
the USM and before they have completed 52 weeks (± 2 weeks) of follow-up, the reason for the study 
phase discontinuation on the EOS CRF, is also be documented as ‘Technical problems’. Every effort is 
to be made to keep patients in the study until the planned 52-week follow up and to ensure study 
integrity. While the current statistical analysis plan (SAP) includes off-treatment data after treatment 
discontinuations in the primary analysis (reflecting a real-world setting), this does not seem 
appropriate for the study drug discontinuations in the context of this USM. The unforeseen intercurrent 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

events of the USM leading to study treatment discontinuations are not related to disease progression, 
are not related to the assigned study treatment and do not reflect a real-world setting. The exposure 
to the study treatment and study follow-up are reasonably long. Therefore, an on-treatment approach 
is considered to be more appropriate for the handling of USM-impacted patients in the primary 
analysis, utilizing the relevant components of the global rank endpoint including Category 1 and 2 
status at the time of treatment discontinuation. 
Baseline data
Baseline demographic characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups (Table 19). Overall, 
48.53% were male, and the most frequent race was white (48.00%), followed by Asian (27.20%) and 
Black or African American (12.80%).
Age group 1 (6 to <18 years) accounted for 58.67% of all patients, age group 2a (2 to <6 years) for 
22.67% of all patients, and age group 3a (1 month to < 2 years) for 18.67% of all patients.
Nine patients (2.40%) were below <1 year of age.

The paediatric heart failure history was balanced between the treatment groups (Table 20). 
Consistent with the study requirement, all patients had a history of heart failure due to left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and biventricular physiology. The most frequent primary aetiology for heart 
failure was cardiomyopathy-related (63.47% of patients), and prior heart failure-related hospitalization 
was reported in 68.53% of patients. The time from diagnosis to randomization was more than a year in 
62.67% of patients.

Baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups (Table 21). The majority 
of patients (>80%) were NYHA/Ross Class II or higher at baseline (Table 22). Of note, 10 patients were 
randomized into the wrong NYHA/Ross class group stratum; thus, there is a slight difference between 
patients’ NYHA/Ross class based on baseline status vs based on the randomization stratum. 
The  mean  LVEF  was  32.22%,  and  the  mean  fractional  shortening  16.24%,  consistent  with  systemic 
LVSD. Baseline NT-proBNP levels were higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group than the enalapril group. 
Within  each  age  group,  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  balanced  between  treatment  groups, 
including NYHA class (age group 1) and Ross class (age groups 2a, and 3a). The baseline NT-proBNP 
levels were higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group across all age groups.

Prior treatment and background treatment for heart failure 
Prior heart failure and cardiovascular medication use was balanced between the two treatment groups. 
As expected, ACE inhibitors were used in the vast majority of patients with 91.44% vs 91.49% of 
patients in the sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril groups, respectively, most frequently enalapril (45.99% 
vs 47.43%), captopril (22.99% vs 20.21%), lisinopril (13.37% vs 13.83%), and enalapril maleate 
(10.70% vs 10.11%).
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 61/132
The most frequent other prior heart failure and cardiovascular medications in the sacubitril/valsartan 
vs enalapril groups were: beta-blockers (70.59% vs 68.62%), spironolactone (64.71% vs 68.09%), 
furosemide (60.43% vs 67.55%), and digoxin (39.04% vs 34.57%). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) was 
used in 39.04% (37.97%) vs 44.15% (44.15%) of patients.  ARBs were used in 5.50% vs 7.21% of 
patients, and ivabradine, an HCN channel blocker, was used in 2.14% vs 2.13% of patients. 
The use of concomitant heart failure and cardiovascular medications (i.e. medications that were 
ongoing or started at baseline) was balanced between the treatment groups, and, with the exception of 
ACE inhibitors that were prohibited during the treatment period, similar to prior use. The most frequent 
concomitant heart failure and cardiovascular medications used in the sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril 
groups were: beta-blockers (73.26% vs 72.34%), spironolactone (68.45% vs 69.15%), furosemide 
(65.78% vs 69.68%) and digoxin (42.25% vs 35.64%). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) was used in 
43.32% (42.25%) vs 46.81% (46.81%) of patients. ARBs were used in 3.21% vs 4.26% of patients, 
and ivabradine was used in 4.28% vs 3.72% of patients.
ACEIs were reported as concomitant medications in 9.63% of patients in sacubitril/valsartan group and 
14.36% of patients in the enalapril group. Of note, only patients who interrupted or discontinued study 
drug could be on ACEi or ARB treatment. The most commonly reported ACEI was enalapril 
(sacubitril/valsartan: 5.35%; enalapril: 6.91%) followed by lisinopril (sacubitril/valsartan: 2.67%; 
enalapril: 3.19%) and captopril (sacubitril/valsartan: 1.60%; enalapril: 2.66%).
Primary Outcomes and estimation
The primary endpoint analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment 
groups (Table 23). The Mann-Whitney probability estimate numerically favoured sacubitril/valsartan 
(0.5244; 95% CI 0.4665,  0.5817, p=0.4238) compared to the standard of care enalapril. 
The results were consistent across subgroups by age, with no significant differences observed between 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril. The interpretation is limited for patients younger than 1 year (age 
group 3) as only 9 patients in this age group were enrolled.

Supportive and sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint
Supportive analyses of the global rank endpoint (including primary rank score based on positively 
adjudicated clinical events (PACE) in the PPS, primary rank score based on investigator-reported 
clinical events (IRCE), response category based on PACE and IRCE, and primary rank score based on 
PACE and IRCE in the pooled strata) showed results similar to the primary analysis.
Sensitivity analysis of the global rank endpoint primary rank score based on PACE and IRCE with 
multiple imputations and LOCF approach without cut-off, and assessing USM impact, also showed 
results similar to the primary analysis. Results of a tipping point sensitivity analysis for the global rank 
endpoint –primary ranks score based on PACE was in agreement with the primary analysis results and 
demonstrated the robustness of handling the discontinuation of patients without Category 1 events 
Global rank endpoint – patient allocation 
Patient allocation for the Global Rank primary endpoint (based on positively adjudicated events) is 
shown in Table 24. This table shows the worst event per patient contributing to the global ranking: 
patients are hierarchically counted by their first event for the Category 1 events, and by their worst 
event for Category 2, and for the change in functional class (worse/unchanged/improved) for Category 
3 to 5 events. 
The following observation can be made: 
•
•
The proportion of patients with a Category 1 event was numerically lower in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group (10.16%) compared to the enalapril group (15.96%).
The proportion of patients counted for Category 2 was numerically higher in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group (9.63%) compared to the enalapril group (4.79%). This difference is in part due to the 
higher proportion of patients on enalapril having a Category 1 event, as patients who had both a 
Category 1 and a Category 2 event were excluded from Category 2 (i.e. competing risks) (see also 
Table 2-10 below).

A large proportion of patients, approximately 80%, in both treatment groups had no Category 1 or

Summary of Category 1 and Category 2 events
A summary of all Category 1 and Category 2 events based on both PACE and IRCE is provided in Table 
25. There were fewer events of death in the sacubitril/valsartan group (8 deaths, 4.28%) than the 
enalapril group (12 deaths, 6.38%). Furthermore, based on PACE, the proportion of patients with other 
types of Category 1 event was also lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group. 
A similar pattern was observed for IRCE, with the exception of the event UNOS status 1A listing for 
heart transplant or equivalent.
The proportion of patients with a Category 2 event was numerically higher in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group than in the enalapril group (16.58% vs 14.36%). The difference is less pronounced than for 
events allocated to Category 2 for the Global Rank primary endpoint analysis shown in Table 24, due 
to some patients having both a Category 1 and a Category 2 event (13 in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group and 18 in the enalapril group). Excluding discontinuations, there were 10 patients in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group and 14 patients in the enalapril group who had both a Category 1 and a 
Category 2 event.

Results of subgroup analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints 
The results for the primary endpoint were consistent across subgroups, with MWO numerically 
favouring sacubitril/valsartan in the majority of the subgroups, however with the notable exception of 
the small (n=27) subgroup of patients with NYHA/Ross class III/IV. As 10 patients were randomized in 
the wrong NYHA/Ross stratum, the subgroup analysis by “NYHA/Ross class group at baseline” should 
be considered; this analysis shows a less pronounced difference in treatment effect than the analysis 
by “NYHA/Ross class group with IRT”. The results of subgroup analyses for the secondary endpoints 
were generally comparable across subgroups, with no consistent trends observed.

Pre-Pandemic - end of study prior to 1-Mar-2020. Pre and During Pandemic - randomized prior to 1-Mar-2020 and 
end of study after 1-Mar-2020. During pandemic - randomized on or after 1-Mar-2020. For USM-impacted patients, the 
on-treatment assessments are included. The interaction p value was derived using meta analysis to test for heterogeneity across 
subgroups. The NYHA/ROSS class group at randomization referred to the data assigned in IRT when the patient was randomized. 
The NYHA/ROSS class group at baseline referred to the data in CRF assessed by investigator and collected at randomization visit.
Secondary endpoints
Time to Category 1 or Category 2 events
No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in time to first positively adjudicated 
Category 1 or 2 events (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 1.0655; 95% CI: 0.6589, 1.7232) (Table 26). The 
cumulative event rate was similar in both treatment groups.
The proportion of patients with a Category 1 event was lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group (6.95%) 
than in the enalapril group (10.64%), and the HR was numerically in favour of sacubitril/valsartan (of 
note, the number of events is different from the primary analysis because discontinuation was not 
considered an event). Conversely, for Category 2 events, the proportion of patients with a Category 2 
event was slightly higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group (16.58%) than in the enalapril group 
(14.36%), and the HR was numerically in favour of enalapril. 
Similar results were obtained using analysis based on investigator-reported Category 1 or Category 2 
events (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 1.0068; 95% CI: 0.6482, 1.5638; nominal two-sided p=0.9759). Since 
there were no events in age group 2a with NYHA/ROSS class group III/IV, a sensitivity analysis

stratified by modified age group was conducted; the results showed a similar trend for time to first 
positively adjudicated Category 1 or 2 events (adjusted Hazard Ratio: 1.0559 [95% CI: 0.6531, 
1.7070; nominal two-sided p=0.8245]).
The cumulative probability of both positively adjudicated or Investigator reported Category 1 or 
Category 2 events was similar between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups.

NYHA/Ross functional class change from baseline
While there was no significant difference between the treatment groups, patients experienced clinically 
meaningful improvements over the 52 weeks of the study in both treatment groups, based on changes 
in NYHA/Ross functional class from baseline. At Week 52, 37.66% of patients in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group and 33.96% of patients in the enalapril group had improvement at Week 52, and approximately 
half of all patients were stable (no change in NYHA/Ross class). The odds ratio for a favorable outcome 
(sacubitril/valsartan / enalapril) at Week 52 was 1.0733 (95% CI: 0.6843, 1.6832) (Table 27). 
A sensitivity analysis with multiple imputations showed results similar to the main analysis above, with 
an adjusted odds ratio for a favourable outcome (sacubitril/valsartan/enalapril) at Week 52 of 1.0409 
(95% CI: 0.6705, 1.6158).

The majority of patients (>80%) were in NYHA/Ross class II or higher at baseline. Shifts to a lower 
(better) NYHA/Ross functional class was observed in both treatment groups during the study. The 
proportion of patients with NYHA/Ross class I (i.e. had no symptoms or limitations) increased from 
baseline to Week 52 in both treatment groups (from 13.37% to 48.47% in the sacubitril/valsartan

Global impression of severity (PGIS) change from baseline
Consistent with the results in NYHA/Ross class, while there was no significant difference between the 
treatment groups on change in PGIS from baseline, a high proportion of patients in both treatment

groups experienced clinically relevant improvement, or were stable, during the study: 35.53% of 
patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 34.81% of patients in the enalapril group had 
improvement at Week 52, and nearly half of all patients were stable (i.e. no change in PGIS). The odds 
ratio for a favorable outcome (sacubitril/valsartan / enalapril) at Week 52 was 1.1498 (95% CI: 
0.7349, 1.7989) (Table 29).
Similar results were obtained using a sensitivity analysis with multiple imputations to account for 
missing values: at Week 52, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.1251 (95% CI: 0.7266, 1.7422), 
numerically in favour of sacubitril/valsartan.

The proportion of patients who were asymptomatic (i.e. PGIS status C1 (none / good)) increased from 
baseline to Week 52 in both treatment groups (from 45.05% to 67.95% in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group, and from 38.59% to 64.94% in the enalapril group). Improvements in PGIS status were 
observed in all age groups. Fewer patients had moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms (PGIS 
classification of C3 or higher) at Week 52 than at baseline (Table 30).

Exploratory Outcomes
NT-proBNP change from baseline
The sections below show data to support the relevance of NT-proBNP as an important biomarker of 
heart failure, with higher levels being associated with poorer outcomes in patients with HFrEF. 
NT-proBNP change from baseline is presented for the overall population, followed by analyses 
conducted by the modified age group.
Change from baseline – overall population
There was an imbalance in NT-proBNP levels at baseline, with higher levels in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group (geomean 879.28 pg/mL) than in the enalapril group (geomean 737.42 pg/mL). 
Importantly, both treatment groups showed clinically relevant decreases in NT-proBNP levels 
throughout the study (Figure 12). The decrease was numerically greater in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group up to Week 52. The reduction was observed as early as 4 weeks after starting treatment, at 
which time the relative between-treatment difference was 27% (p<0.05) in favor of 
sacubitril/valsartan. The relative treatment differences in both Week 12 and Week 52 were 
approximately 9%, which were not statistically significant. At Week 52, the reduction in NT-proBNP 
from baseline was 65% and 62% for the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups,  respectively (Table 
31). Of particular note, at Week 52 the NT-proBNP values achieved with both therapies reached the 
upper end of the age-adjusted range reported in a healthy population by Nir et al 2009.

Association between NT-proBNP and clinical outcomes
A post-hoc analysis was performed to confirm whether baseline NT-proBNP levels and changes in NT-
proBNP levels post-baseline were associated with the risk of clinical outcome events in paediatric HF, 
similar to earlier observations in adults with HFrEF.
The results show that similar to adults, changes in NT-proBNP post-baseline were strongly associated 
with the risk of Category 1 or 2 events in paediatric HF patients (Table 32). A doubling of NT-proBNP 
levels post-baseline was associated with an approximately 2.1-fold increased risk of a Category 1 or 2 
event (p<0.0001). Conversely, halving NT-proBNP post-baseline levels (i.e. ratio to baseline = 0.5) is 
associated with a 52.2% decrease in risk (hazard) for a Category 1 or 2 event. Furthermore, a 
doubling of baseline NT-proBNP levels was associated with an approximately 1.8-fold increased risk of 
a Category 1 or 2 event.
NT-proBNP levels at baseline and changes post-baseline were also significantly associated with the risk 
of Category 1 event and the risk of Category 2 event when the two event categories were considered 
separately.

NT-proBNP levels by age group
Baseline NT-proBNP levels were consistently higher in age groups 1, 2a, and 3a than those reported for 
similar age groups of a healthy population by Nir et al. 2009. Conversely, clinically meaningful 
decreases in NT-proBNP levels were observed in all 3 age groups and both treatment groups.
MMRM analysis of change from baseline by modified age group confirmed that NT-proBNP decreased in 
all age groups. In the age group 1 (6 to <18 years of age), the reduction in NT-proBNP was 
numerically greater in the sacubitril/valsartan group throughout the study, with a relative between-
treatment difference of 28% at Week 4, 15% at Week 12, and 11% at Week 52. In age group 2a (2 to 
<6 years of age), the change from baseline was numerically greater in the sacubitril/ valsartan group 
at Week 4 (relative between-treatment differences of 28%), but similar at Week 52 (relative between-
treatment differences of 4%). In age group 3a (1 month to <2 years of age), the change from baseline 
was numerically greater in the sacubitril/valsartan group at Week 4  (relative between-treatment 
differences of 12%), but greater in the enalapril group at Week 52 (relative between-treatment 
differences of 31%).

NT-proBNP change concerning the reference change value and responder analyses
The intra-individual variability is the sum of analytical variability and biologic variability.  
Evaluation of biologic variability or the intra-individual between-visit-variability (sum of analytical and 
biological variability) in patients with CHF requires repeated NT-proBNP measurements in the same 
patient over time during a stable period (e.g., no progression of disease, no major changes in 
medications). Meijers et al 2016 reported week-to-week intra-individual coefficient of variation of 22% 
based on 83 CHF patients, with weekly NT-proBNP measurements over a period of 6 weeks. Bruins et 
al 2004 reported week-to-week intra-individual coefficient of variation of 35% based on 43 stable CHF 
patients, with weekly NT-proBNP measurements over a period of 6 weeks. Other relevant published 
reports are listed in Table 34 below.
Similarly, most visits of the adults PARADIGM-HF study are affected by changes in treatment and 
potentially disease status, which would artificially inflate the visit-to-visit variation. For an estimation of 
the random intra-individual visit-to-visit variation, only the relatively stable enalapril run-in phase 
between Visits 2/2a and Visit 3 seems adequate since the two visits are in close vicinity (2-4 weeks 
apart) and presumably not much affected by changes in treatment (most patients were on ACEi/ARBs 
before participating in the study, and all patients received enalapril between Visit 2 and Visit 3). There 
were 835 patients with NT-proBNP measures at both visits 2/2a and 3. Based on these patients, the 
intra-individual coefficient of variation for NT-proBNP in PARADIGM-HF was estimated to be 34.8%.
A search of the literature was conducted to identify publications on the variability of NT-proBNP in 
adults or children (search terms: biological variability OR intra-patient variability OR intrapatient 
variability OR coefficient of variation; pediatric OR paediatric OR children; and NT-proBNP OR BNP). 
The publications were then reviewed and selected for relevance (e.g., assessed within-subject 
variability, data in HF patients, original research rather than review articles). The search did not 
retrieve any study of the biological variability of NT-proBNP in children. Eight relevant publications (7 
original research articles and one letter to the editor), all in adults, were selected and included in the 
analysis (Table 34). Additionally, in pediatric review articles from Nir et al 2009 and Cantinotti 2016 it 
was reported that BNP/NT-proBNP concentrations have the highest drop in the first month of life, with 
a smaller reduction up to the age of 2 and then without any significant change up to 12 years of age, 
thus further supporting the adequacy of using the same RCV values for adults and children.
Table 34 shows the estimated RCVs based on PARADIGM (B2314) enalapril run-in dataset, PARADIGM 
DCM (B2314 DCM) enalapril run-in dataset and 8 published datasets. The estimated RCVs based on 
B2314 are around −60% which is consistent with the externally published datasets, which range from 
−22% to −61% with a 97.5% insurance against false positive reduction. 
The RCVs corresponding to the 90% insurance against false positive reduction are also presented 
since, based on the argument of Fokkema et al 2006, 97.5% is probably too high of a hurdle for 
insurance and 90% might be clinically more appropriate for the HF population to lower the false-
negative rate.  The corresponding RCVs range from −16% to −46%.

From these analyses, RCVs ranged from −16% to −61%, depending on the dataset and insurance level 
chosen. For the CHMP proposed responder analysis, we chose RCV thresholds −22%, −33%, −46%, 
and −61% from the above range. The RCV threshold of  –16% was not included because it is well 
within the intra-subject variability from most data sources and hence might be too low to protect 
against false positives, i.e. to distinguish between deterioration in a patient’s clinical condition and 
random noise. The results of the responder analysis are presented in Table 35.  It shows reasonable 
proportions of patients who had reached or crossed the thresholds within treatment groups. 
Interestingly, especially for children in PANORAMA-HF, numerically consistently higher rates of 
responders in the sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril group for each threshold, for 
both children and adults, are observed. In addition to the odds ratios being all greater than 1.5, the 
lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios are greater than 1 for the between 
treatment responder comparison for all thresholds in adults and for the −33% and −46% thresholds in 
children, indicating a systematic difference in favor of sacubitril/valsartan in the responder rates 
between the treatment groups.

Time to recurrent Category 1 and 2 events
Analysis of all Category 1 and 2 events (first and recurrent) showed a numerical trend in favour of 
sacubitril/valsartan but no significant difference between the treatment groups. Based on positively 
adjudicated Category 1 and 2 events (73 in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 79 in the enalapril 
group), the rate ratio (sacubitril/valsartan/enalapril) was 0.9225 (95% CI: 0.5386, 1.5800). Based on 
investigator-reported Category 1 and 2 events (88 in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 112 in the 
enalapril group, the rate ratio (sacubitril/valsartan/enalapril) was 0.7808 (95% CI: 0.4700, 1.2973). 
The total number of Category 1 events was lower in the sacubitril/valsartan vs the enalapril group, 
based on both positively adjudicated events (25 vs 36) and investigator-reported events (31 vs 45). 
For Category 2 events, the total number of positively adjudicated events was higher in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group vs the enalapril group (48 vs 43), but for investigator-reported events, the 
trend was the opposite, with fewer events reported in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs the enalapril 
group (57 vs 67).  
PedsQL score 
PedsQL change from baseline
Improvements (i.e. a higher score) in both patient-reported and parent-reported total PedsQL scores 
were observed in both treatment groups. Patient-reported mean PedsQL scores (patients 5 to <18 
years of age) increased from 72.51 at baseline to 77.12 at Week 52 in the sacubitril/valsartan group 
(mean increase from baseline 5.24). For enalapril, mean PedsQL scores increased from 69.90 at 
baseline to 72.22 at Week 52 (mean increase from baseline 2.34). Similar improvements were 
observed for parent-reported total PedsQL scores: in the overall population (patients 1 month to <18 
years of age), mean parent-reported PedsQL scores increased from 70.91 at baseline to 77.23 at Week 
52 in the sacubitril/valsartan group (mean increase 5.94), and from 72.37 at baseline to 76.09 at 
Week 52 in the enalapril group (mean increase 3.89). Similar results were observed in the age groups 
6 to <18 years of age, 2 to <6 years of age, and 1 month to <2 years of age as in the overall 
populations.

The change from baseline in patient-reported and in parent-reported total PedsQL scores up to Week 
52 based on the MMRM analysis was numerically higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the 
enalapril group, but not significantly different between the treatment groups. Importantly, in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group, the adjusted least squares mean change from baseline exceeded the 
minimally clinically important difference threshold of 4.5 at Weeks 36 and 52 for both patient-reported 
and parent reported PedsQL, whereas the threshold was not crossed in the enalapril group (Table 36).
The change in patient-reported Physical functioning subscore, which was used for further ranking in 
the global rank endpoint for patients in age group 1, was also numerically higher in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group. The adjusted least squares mean change from 
baseline at Week 52 was 6.0439 (95% CI: 1.6506, 10.4372) in the sacubitril/valsartan group, and 
1.7617 (95% CI: -2.5698, 6.0932) in the enalapril group.

Proportion of patients with a 4.5 change from baseline in PedsQL
The proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 4.5 points in patient-reported PedsQL score 
was numerically higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group throughout the study. At Week 52, the 
proportion of patients with at least 4.5 point improvement was 43.43% in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group and 38.38% in the enalapril group; the results numerically favoured sacubitril/valsartan, with an 
OR of 1.5100 (95% CI: 0.8055, 2.8304; nominal 2-sided p=0.1987). 
A similar pattern was observed for parent-reported PedsQL: At Week 52, the proportion of patients 
with at least 4.5 point improvement was 45.78% vs 42.07% for the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril 
groups, respectively, with an OR of 1.1606 (95% CI: 0.7265, 1.8541; nominal 2-sided p=0.533).
Conversely, the proportion of patients with a deterioration in PedsQL of at least 4.5 points was 
numerically lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group in both parent-reported 
and patient-reported PedsQL. 
PGIC score through 52 weeks

PGIC scores indicated that there was a progressive increase in the proportion of patients who felt 
“much better” or “better” since the start of the study in both treatment groups from Week 4 until Week 
52 (Table 37). At Week 52, the proportion of patients who felt much better was 33.33% in the 
sacubitril/ valsartan group vs 28.24% in the enalapril group. The corresponding figures for patients 
who felt better were 40.94% vs 38.24% for the respective groups.
Although analysis of change from baseline showed no statistically significant difference between 
treatment groups for the PGIC at Week 52, the results numerically favoured sacubitril/valsartan, with 
an OR of 1.3510 (95% CI: 0.9134, 1.9983; nominal two-sided p=0.1320).

The efficacy of LCZ696 compared to enalapril after 52-week of double-
blind treatment is assessed using a global rank endpoint. The ranking 
was based on clinical events (such as death, listing for urgent heart 
transplant,  mechanical  life  support  requirement  at  end  of  study), 
worsening HF, NYHA/Ross class, Patient Global Impression of Severity 
(PGIS),  and  Paediatric  quality  of  life  inventory  (PedsQL)  physical 
functioning domain.
Clinical  events  (Categories  1  and  2)  are  adjudicated  by  an  external 
independent adjudication committee.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Sacubitril/valsartan is approved in adult patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) based on the results from study B2314, in which it demonstrated superiority over enalapril in 
reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalizations for heart failure 
(HF) by 20%. 
The totality of evidence included in this submission supporting the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan for 
paediatric use includes 1) extrapolation of the existing adult HFrEF data from study B2314 
(PARADIGM-HF) to children based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from study 
B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) and 2) the clinical data provided by the PANORAMA-HF study.
Extrapolation plan
Disease similarity was proposed by the applicant between adults with HFrEF based on DCM and 
paediatric heart failure patients with LVSD consistent with DCM. Similarities have also been highlighted 
in the draft ICH E11A 2022 guideline stating that "... heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy is 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 86/132
similar between adult and paediatric populations, allowing for extrapolation from adult to paediatric 
patients with dilated cardiomyopathy". 
Dilated cardiomyopathy is considered a form of heart muscle disease (abnormal ventricular 
myocardium) whose primary abnormality is systolic dysfunction. While dilation is also a component of 
this disease, it can be agreed that treatment strategies in children are based on signs, symptoms, and 
the degree of systolic dysfunction. PANORAMA-HF aimed to enrol a homogeneous population of 
pediatric HF with left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSD) consistent with DCM. HCM and RCM, along 
with uncorrected structural heart disease and single ventricle or systemic right ventricle, were 
excluded. Enrolment of a homogeneous pediatric HF population with LVSD consistent with DCM in 
PANORAMA-HF was thus achieved by defining a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria, which made 
sure all patients had symptomatic HF and HFrEF, which is defined as LVSD in pediatric patients. 
More than 60% of patients in PANORAMA-HF had a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, with the cause being 
idiopathic in 33.6%, followed by familial/genetic conditions in 15.7% and congenital heart 
malformations in 13.3%. Heart failure secondary to other causes was noted in about 35% of patients. 
In those 35% of patients where the etiology of HF was not primarily identified as related to 
cardiomyopathy, it is known from literature, that all can evolve into or manifest as DCM. In particular, 
the most frequent cause was myocarditis-induced HF, which itself is the most common cause of 
acquired DCM in children. In PANORAMA-HF, while there was no collection of echocardiographic data 
regarding ventricle volumes or diameters to confirm a diagnosis of DCM, all diseases included are 
known to evolve or manifest as DCM, and, additionally, patients with restrictive or hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy were excluded. Nonetheless, as recommended by treatment guidelines, the treatment 
of heart failure in children is based on pathophysiology, hence based on systolic vs. diastolic 
dysfunction and based on approved adult HFrEF therapies.
It can be agreed that PANORAMA-HF evaluated a relatively homogeneous population with biventricular 
hearts and symptomatic HF due to a systemic left ventricle with decreased ejection fraction. All 
diseases included are known to possibly evolve or manifest as DCM. Such an approach resulted in a 
patient population that resembles the adult HF population with DCM. In conclusion, all patients enrolled 
in PANORAMA-HF had a diagnosis of LVSD, while patients with HCM, RCM, complex congenital heart 
disease with functional single ventricle or systemic right ventricle were excluded. Despite the lack of LV 
diameter measurement, the literature and clinical practice support that all enrolled pediatric patients 
with systemic LVSD also had a form of DCM. Furthermore, both adult HFrEF with DCM and pediatric HF 
due to LVSD have similar pathophysiology, including a reduced cardiac output due to left ventricle 
insufficiency, which causes reduced organ perfusion, increased adrenergic tone, and RAAS activation. 
These translate into increased sodium retention and increased volume, which can further worsen left 
ventricle function.
Similar drug pharmacology was established by demonstrating that sacubitrilat and valsartan drug 
exposure in paediatric HF patients is similar to exposure in adult heart HF at the same dose (Age 
Groups 1 and 2) with the ratios of geometric means of drug exposure (AUC children /AUC adults) being 
0.80-0.92 and 0.99 1.29 for sacubitrilat and valsartan, respectively. Age Group 3 showed 
corresponding AUC changes consistent with the dose change (dose was initially 50% reduced 
considering the potential impact of developing the capacity of drug disposition), with the ratios of 
geometric means of the drug exposure (AUC children/AUC adults) being 0.39 and 0.61 for sacubitrilat 
and valsartan, respectively.
Similar exposure response was established by demonstrating a similar magnitude of NT-proBNP 
reductions at exposure-matched doses of sacubitril/valsartan in the paediatric study B2319 and adult 
study B2314. The ratio of NT-proBNP relative to baseline between paediatric HF patients (3.1 mg/kg) 
and adult HF patients (200 mg) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89), while when compared to adult HF 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 87/132
patients with DCM it was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.2). 
NT-proBNP as a bridging biomarker for extrapolation of effects in adults with DCM to the paediatric 
population was assessed using the Prentice criteria. The Prentice criteria provide a systematic 
framework to establish the adequacy of NT-proBNP as a bridging biomarker. This includes the 
demonstration that the treatment has a significant impact on the true clinical endpoint, the treatment 
has a significant impact on the biomarker, the biomarker is significantly associated with true clinical 
endpoint and that the biomarker explains the effect of treatment on true clinical endpoint. 
Study B2314 in adults (n=2080) with HFrEF with DCM demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan 
treatment has a significant impact on the true clinical endpoint of reducing the risk of CV death or HF 
hospitalizations compared to enalapril (RRR:25%) (1st Prentice criterion). In the subgroup of adult 
patients with HFrEF with DCM, the reduction in NT-proBNP from baseline was 43% at Month 1, and 
52% at Month 8 in the sacubitril/valsartan arm (n=885), indicating that the treatment has a significant 
impact on the biomarker NT-proBNP (2nd Prentice criterion). Furthermore, a change in plasma NT-
proBNP was associated with the CV mortality/HF hospitalization rate in adult patients with HFrEF with 
DCM in study B2314 (n=405), indicating that the biomarker is significantly associated with true clinical 
endpoint (3rd Prentice criterion). The association between NT-proBNP and risk of clinical events was 
similarly observed in paediatric patients (B2319), where a doubling of NT-proBNP levels at baseline or 
post-baseline was associated, respectively, with 1.8-fold and 2.1-fold increase of the risk of Category 1 
or 2 events (n=375). Lastly, study B2314 in adults with HFrEF demonstrated that the majority of the 
sacubitril/valsartan treatment effect on the time to first event of CV death or HF hospitalization 
endpoint is explained by NT-proBNP over time (n=1990)(4th Prentice criterion). The proportion of 
treatment effect explained on top of baseline NT-ProBNP was 85.55%, with the 95% CI (6.35%, 
164.76%) excluding zero. The applicant has performed sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of 
the proportion of treatment effect explained using structural equation modelling and counterfactual 
methods. To this end, an Aalen additive hazard model was used, which demonstrated that the percent 
contribution of the natural indirect effect from NT-proBNP relative change to the total effect: 81.4% 
(CI:24.7% to 509.3%), which is very close to the result of 82.5% (CI:1.26% to 164%) obtained with 
the “change in coefficients” method presented in the original submission. This is considered acceptable.
Design and conduct of clinical study B2319
Study B2319, consisted of two parts. Part 1 was a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK and PD of sacubitril/valsartan, which served to select the dose for part 2. Part 2 was a 
52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in paediatric patients from 1 month to < 18 years 
of age with HF due to systemic left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSD). The overall design of the 
study was endorsed by the PDCO (000316-PIP02-11 and modifications). 
Dose selection
In Part 1, PD and PK effects of sacubitril/valsartan were evaluated in three age categories  (Age Group 
1 (6 to <18 years; n=9), Age Group 2 (1 to <6 years; n=9), and Age Group 3 (1 month to <1 year; 
n=8)). The sacubitril/valsartan doses used were 0.8 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg for Age Groups 1 and 2, 
and 0.4 mg/kg and 1.6 mg/kg for Age Group 3. The objective was to select a dose for Part 2 that 
provided similar exposures of sacubitril and valsartan to that observed in adult HF patients and that 
also maximized neprilysin inhibition. The PD effect of neprilysin inhibition was assessed through urine 
and plasma biomarkers. Single doses of sacubitril/valsartan in patients 1 month to <18 years of age 
demonstrated similar PK as the adult HF patient population based on approximate dose-proportional 
exposure increase, observed sacubitril T1/2, and total body plasma clearance for both sacubitril and 
valsartan. Furthermore, administration of sacubitril/valsartan resulted in increases in urinary cGMP in 
all age groups, which were dose-dependent. Overall, the results from Part 1 indicated for age group 1 
and 2 that a target dose of 3.1 mg/kg achieved similar exposure to the adult dose of 200mg. For age 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 88/132
group 3, the dose in part 1 was reduced to 1.6mg/kg, considering the potential impact of developing 
capacity of drug disposition in this very young age group on drug exposure. The target dose for age 
group 3  (1 month to <1 year) was increased from the originally planned 1.6 mg/kg to 2.3 mg/kg, as 
agreed upon by the DMC and the FDA. Although the specific grounds for this decision have not been 
provided, this issue is not pursued since only an indication is sought for paediatric patients of one year 
and older. 
The target dose was further confirmed by the population PK data and PK/PD analysis of NT-proBNP 
from Part 2. More specifically, the dose-exposure-response of sacubitril/valsartan and NT-proBNP 
appeared to be consistent between paediatric and adult patients with HF at their equivalent dose, 
especially in the comparison of paediatric HF with adult patients with HFrEF due to DCM.
Overall, the recommended target sacubitril/valsartan dose is 3.1 mg/kg twice daily for patients aged 1 
to <18 years using age-appropriate dosage forms, i.e. the newly developed film-coated granules, 
suspension made of solid forms and the approved film-coated tablets.
Design of the main clinical study (Part 2 of B2319)
As described above, Part 2 of B2319 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, 
52-week study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LCZ696 compared to enalapril in 
paediatric HF patients (1 month to < 18 years). 
The chosen inclusion/exclusion criteria are acceptable. Key inclusion included male or female, inpatient 
or outpatient of 1 month to < 18 years of age with chronic HF resulting from LVSD and biventricular 
physiology. Furthermore, eligible patients were required to have NYHA classification II-IV (older 
children: 6 to <18 years old) or Ross CHF classification II-IV, systemic left ventricular ejection fraction 
(EF) ≤ 45% or fractional shortening ≤22.5% and receiving chronic HF therapy. Key exclusion criteria 
included patients listed for heart transplantation or hospitalized waiting for a transplant, patients with 
restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sustained or symptomatic dysrhythmias uncontrolled with 
therapy, symptomatic hypotension or blood pressures, serum potassium > 5.3 mmol/L at visit 1 and 
patients with allergy or hypersensitivity to ACEI/ARB patients with significant renal, hepatic, 
gastrointestinal or biliary disorders. These inclusion/exclusion criteria lead to a more homogeneous 
population with biventricular hearts and HF due to systemic left ventricle with decreased ejection 
fraction. Such an approach will result in a patient population that resembles more closely the adult HF 
population in which sacubitril/valsartan has been shown to be more effective than enalapril in reducing 
mortality, HF hospitalization and improving symptoms in patients with HF. A disadvantage of the 
chosen exclusion criteria is that it will limit analyses of efficacy in subgroups of hepatic and kidney 
impairment. Similarly, excluding participants with hypersensitivity to ACE/ARB, while acceptable, will 
lead to an underestimation of the true safety profile, especially considering that most patients were not 
ACE/ARB naïve. Furthermore, the inclusion criterion of “NYHA classification II-IV or Ross CHF 
classification II-IV” indicates that the study is focused only on patients with symptomatic paediatric HF 
patients. However, it is acknowledged that at baseline, 15% had NYHA/Ross classification I (patients 
who had NYHA/Ross II at any time before screening). However, since PANORAMA was not able to 
demonstrate the anticipated superiority over enalapril, a large part of the totality of evidence relies on 
the extrapolation of results from B2314 in adults (described below), which also had an inclusion 
criterion of NYHA classification II-IV and is indicated for “symptomatic chronic heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction”. In alignment, the Applicant has included “symptomatic” to the proposed 
indication. 
The study design of part 2 of B2319 is appropriate to achieve the primary objective of the study. In 
this study, enalapril was used as an active control. Active control of valsartan might have been more 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

useful for a direct comparison and understanding of the added benefit of sacubitril. However, it is 
acknowledged that ACE inhibitors are the first-line treatment for paediatric HF with LVSD, and the 
aforementioned potential design may not have led to a sufficient sample size to assess efficacy. The 
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for managing paediatric HF states 
that ACE inhibitors are a class I recommendation for managing paediatric HF with LVSD with a level B 
evidence. Assessment of this literature demonstrates very little evidence of ACE inhibitors affecting 
long-term outcomes. A retrospective analysis of 81 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 
compared ACE inhibitor treatment with conventional therapy (at that time, digoxin and diuretics) and 
demonstrated a better survival during the first year of treatment, which became insignificant in the 
following years [DOI: 10.1007/bf00794837]. Another retrospective analysis of 189 patients with DCM 
demonstrated a numerical trend towards better survival when comparing ACE inhibitor-treated patients 
with digoxin-treated patients, though it did not reach statistical significance [DOI: 
10.1016/j.jacc.2009.11.059]. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial in 57 patients with Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy, in which perindopril was compared to placebo, demonstrated that perindopril 
delayed the onset and progression of prominent left ventricle dysfunction after 3 years of treatment 
but did not investigate mortality [DOI: 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.09.078]. A later publication of the same 
study demonstrated that at the end of the 10 years' follow-up period, survival status was 26 (92.9%) 
of 28 patients in the perindopril group were alive at 10 years versus 19 (65.5%) of 29 in the placebo 
group (P = .02) [DOI: 10.1016/j.ahj.2007.05.014]. 
Although ACE inhibitors are a cornerstone of paediatric HF, no products have been registered for 
paediatric HF, making all therapy off-label. This is due primarily to the difficulties of performing 
paediatric HF trials. There are previous examples of paediatric cardiovascular (CV) studies that were 
initiated but unable to be successfully completed, such as the Paediatric Heart Network study, which 
aimed to test the efficacy of enalapril vs placebo in children with mitral regurgitation after 
atrioventricular septal defect repair. This study was terminated because only 5 of 349 patients 
screened were able to be enrolled over a period of 17 months (Li et al. 2011), illustrating the difficulty 
of conducting paediatric CV trials. Overall, while valsartan would be the ideal comparator for assessing 
the efficacy of sacubitril, the choice of enalapril as the active comparator is understandable and 
acceptable. 
The primary objective of part 2 of study B2319 was to determine whether sacubitril/valsartan was 
superior to enalapril for the treatment of HF as assessed using a Global Rank endpoint. It is 
acknowledged that there is no agreement upon a validated clinical efficacy endpoint for this patient 
population. In addition, the low prevalence of HF in children limits the possibility of conducting large 
outcome trials. Therefore, using a global rank-based endpoint might be an option with the major 
drawback of clinical interpretability by mixing hard and soft clinical endpoints. In this study the Global 
Rank endpoint rank orders patients from worst to best using; (a) objective outcome events of death, 
listing for urgent heart transplant or mechanical support; (b) events of worsening HF; and (c) 
measures of functional assessment (NYHA/Ross) and patient-reported outcomes: Patient Global 
Impression of Severity (PGIS) and the PedsQL (a physical functioning subgroup of questions). Thus, 
the globally ranked endpoint encompasses clinical events grouped into broadly agreed categories of 
severity, from mortality to disease progression (worsening HF) to measures of symptoms and physical 
functioning. The use of a global rank endpoint has been endorsed and not questioned in terms of 
robustness, clinical relevance and interpretability by the PDCO (000316-PIP02-11-M02). Furthermore, 
regarding the exploratory endpoint of change in NT-proBNP from baseline, the Applicant provided data 
regarding the analytic method (or methods) for NT-proBNP.
The sample size was calculated based on assumed underlying probabilities for each category of the 
primary endpoint using data from the Carvedilol Paediatric HF study. For the analysis of an ordered

(354 total). Using a global ranked endpoint, the power under the same assumptions was expected to 
increase. Simulation studies have demonstrated that the power for the global rank endpoint increases 
10-20% more than with the ordered categorical analysis when the power of the ordered categorical 
endpoint is more than 50%. Therefore the projected power using the global rank endpoint was 
estimated to be at least 80%. The sample size has been endorsed in the Paediatric Investigation Plan 
(PIP). It was acknowledged and endorsed in the PIP that the secondary endpoints are not adequately 
powered.
The superiority design is not explicitly discussed in the PIPs nor in modifications (1 to 5) of the PIP. 
However, the Applicant argued that a non-inferiority design was possible since there is no data 
available in the published literature to define a non-inferiority margin for such a study. The statistical 
analyses are adequately described. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses
In part 2 of the pivotal study, 377 patients (187 patients to sacubitril/valsartan and 190 patients to 
enalapril) were randomized, of which 375 received at least 1 dose of the study drug, indicating that the 
targeted sample size had been reached. The percentage of patients who completed study treatment 
was relatively low; however, slightly higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group compared with enalapril 
(78.1% vs 72.6%, respectively). This is acceptable considering the severity of the disease and 
consequently the discontinuation due to clinical worsening. The main cause of study treatment 
discontinuation was adverse events (AEs), with an approximately similar percentage between both 
treatment arms (10.7 vs 11.1% for sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril, respectively). Other reasons that 
contributed most, however, in similar proportions, were technical problems due to urgent safety 
measure (USM)(5.35% vs 5.26%) and physician decision (2.1% vs 2.6%). The study appears to be 
well conducted, with limited patients lost to follow-up (0 vs 0.5%). Nevertheless, out of 420 patients 
that signed written consent, a total of 43 discontinued prior to pre-randomization completion, of which 
32 were screen failures, the majority of which was related due to not reaching the inclusion criteria of 
reduced ejection fraction.
This study was a multicentre study (n=105). Considering that approximately 30% of the subjects were 
from Europe, the population is sufficiently representative for Europe.
The baseline demographic characteristics, paediatric HF history/disease characteristics and medical 
therapies for HF were largely comparable between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril arms. Age 
group 1 (6 to <18 years) accounted for 58.7% (n= 220) of all patients, age group 2a (2 to <6 years) 
for 22.7% (n=85) of all patients, and age group 3a (1 month to < 2 years) for 18.7% (n=70) of all 
patients. As expected, the percentage of patients < 1 year of age was very low (2.4% (n=9). 
Consequently, the proposed indication is limited to >1 year old.  Further, the most frequent primary 
aetiology for HF was cardiomyopathy-related (63.5%), which, based on the exclusion criterion of 
restrictive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, will mostly be comprised of DCM. There is a 
representation of 69.3% of patients in NYHA/Ross Class II (69.3%) and 14.4% in NYHA/Ross Class III, 
allowing an adequate assessment in these specific FCs. However, there is a limited representation of 
patients with NYHA/Ross IV (0.5% (n= 2). Similarly, in the adult study B2314, the number of patients 
with NYHA IV was also very limitedly represented (n=60, <1%). Also, subgroup analyses according to 
NYHA/(ROSS) class demonstrated a trend toward lower efficacy in both B2319 and B2314 in patients 
with higher NYHA/(ROSS) class. The limited representation of NYHA IV representation is well reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The Applicant has stratified by age and NYHA/Ross class at randomization 
to ensure a balanced distribution of treatment allocation within each age group. Nonetheless, the 
geometric mean of baseline NT-proBNP is higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group in each age group 
than enalapril (see section extrapolation for discussion). As expected, most patients used ACE-
inhibitors before enrolment, with enalapril being the most used ACE inhibitor.  Nevertheless, according 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 91/132
to the study protocol ACE- inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and renin inhibitors are all 
prohibited medications during the treatment phase and must be discontinued. Nonetheless, there was 
concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors in 45 patients, and concomitant use of angiotensin receptor blockers 
in 14 patients. However, according to the same protocol, only patients who interrupted or discontinued 
study drug could be on ACEi or ARB treatment, which is reasonable. A total of 56 patients received 
non-study ACEI/ARB prior to the end of the study. The Applicant performed a sensitivity analysis and 
demonstrated that the intercurrent use of non-study ACEI/ARB did not have a relevant impact on the 
results.
The analysis of the Global Rank primary endpoint did not show a statistically significant difference 
between the treatment groups, with a  Mann-Whitney probability estimate of  0.5244 (95% CI 0.4665,  
0.5817, p=0.42 (with a MWP > 0.5 being in favour of sacubitril/valsartan) compared to the standard of 
care enalapril. Therefore, the study failed to meet its primary objective, i.e. demonstration of the 
superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril. The primary results were consistent across subgroups 
by age, with no significant differences observed between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril. Although 
the primary analysis implicates that sacubitril/valsartan is not superior, it may be non-inferior to 
enalapril. However, this could not be tested since non-inferiority margins are unknown for a global 
rank endpoint. Even if sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril are similar in efficacy, the true effectiveness 
over placebo remains unknown due to the lack of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ACE 
inhibitors over placebo on hard clinical endpoints in paediatric HF.  
Subgroup analyses of the primary rank score were consistent with the overall results, that the results 
for the Global Rank primary endpoint numerically favoured sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril in 
all subgroups, except for patients with NYHA/Ross Class III/IV at randomization.
Furthermore, the study failed to meet its secondary objectives, i.e., demonstrating the superiority of 
sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril in delaying time to the first occurrence of the composite of either 
Category 1 or 2 events (e.g. death, worsening HF). The patient allocation for the global rank endpoint 
showed that the proportion of patients with a Category 1 event (objective outcome events of death, 
listing for an urgent heart transplant or mechanical support) was lower in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group compared to the enalapril group (10% vs 16%). However, no significant difference was 
observed between treatment groups in time to the first category 1 event (adjusted HR:  0.64, 95% CI: 
0.32 – 1.28; p=0.20). On the other hand, the proportion of patients with category 2 events (worsening 
of HF with/without hospitalization with/without ICU stay) was numerically higher in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril group (10% vs 5%). This was partially due to the 
higher number of patients on enalapril having a category 1 event, as patients with both category 1 and 
category 2 events were excluded from category 2 events. If these patients were counted, the 
proportion of patients with category 2 events was more similar between the groups (17% vs 14%). 
These data suggest that sacubitril/valsartan treatment delayed the occurrence of Category 1 events. 
However, similarly as for time to first category 1 events, there were no significant differences between 
the treatment groups in time to first category 2 event and combined category 1 or 2 event (adjusted 
HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.72-2.03; p=0.470 and adjusted HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.66- 1.72; p=0.78, 
respectively).
Clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in symptoms and functional endpoints were observed 
in both treatment groups. At Week 52, 37.66% of patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 
33.96% of patients in the enalapril group had improvement, and approximately half of all patients 
were stable. Moreover, the proportion of patients free of HF symptoms (i.e. NYHA/Ross Class 1) 
increased in both groups, from 13.37% at baseline to 48.47% at Week 52 in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group and from 18.09% to 47.50% in the enalapril group. Improvements in NYHA/Ross class were 
observed in all age groups. This pattern of improvement was paralleled by the PGIS assessment: the 
proportion of patients who were asymptomatic (i.e. PGIS classification C1) increased from 45.05% at 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 92/132
baseline to 67.95% at Week 52 in the sacubitril/valsartan group, and from 38.59% to 64.94% in the 
enalapril group. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the sacubitril/valsartan and 
enalapril groups. 
Improvements were also observed in measures of quality of life (PedsQL and PGIC). For PedsQL, the 
adjusted least squares mean changes from baseline exceeded the minimally clinically important 
difference threshold of 4.5 at Weeks 36 and 52 in the sacubitril/valsartan group, whereas the threshold 
was not crossed in the enalapril group. The proportion of patients with at least 4.5 point improvement 
in the sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril groups at Week 52 was 43.43% vs 38.38% for patient-reported 
PedsQL, and 45.78% vs 42.07% for parent-reported PedsQL. PGIC scores showed a progressive 
increase in the proportion of patients who felt “much better” or “better” in both treatment groups. The 
proportion of patients who felt much better in the sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril groups at Week 52 
was 33.33% vs 28.24%; the proportion of patients who felt better was 40.94% vs 38.24% in the 
respective groups. The analysis of change for these secondary outcomes numerically favoured 
sacubitril/valsartan, yet none were statistically significant. 
The improvements from baseline in disease symptoms and quality of life, though not statistically 
superior to enalapril, are reassuring, given the fact that paediatric HF is usually a progressive clinical 
and pathophysiological syndrome.
Regarding exploratory endpoints, in both the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril arm, there was a 
significant decrease in NT-proBNP during study treatment. Initially, there appeared to be a larger 
decrease in NT-proBNP in the sacubitril/valsartan arm (at Week 4), but this difference became and 
remained insignificant from Week 12 onward (65% and 62% for the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril 
groups at week 52, respectively; p=0.5). The Applicant calculated the reference change values (RCV) 
based on the intra-individual variation of NT-proBNP, described in the literature. Using several RCV 
thresholds (i.e. −22%, −33%, −46%, and −61%), the applicant demonstrated consistently higher 
rates of responders in the sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril group for each 
threshold. The lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios were greater than 1 for 
the between-treatment responder comparison for all thresholds in adults and for the −33% and −46% 
thresholds, indicating a systematic difference in favor of sacubitril/valsartan in the responder rates 
between the treatment groups.
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The totality of evidence included in this submission supporting the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan for 
paediatric use includes 1) extrapolation of the existing adult HFrEF data from study B2314 
(PARADIGM-HF) to children based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from study 
B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) and 2) the clinical efficacy data provided by the PANORAMA-HF study. 
The Applicant adequately demonstrated similarity between adult HFrEF with DCM and pediatric heart 
failure with LVSD, consistent with DCM. Furthermore, the applicant demonstrated similar drug 
pharmacology and similar exposure-response. Lastly, the applicant demonstrated that NT-proBNP 
could be used bridging biomarker (using the prentice criteria) to extrapolate the efficacy between adult 
and paediatric populations. 
In study B2319, the Global Rank primary endpoint analysis did not show a statistically significant 
difference between treatment groups with a Mann-Whitney probability estimate of 0.5244 (95% CI 
0.4665, 0.5817, p=0.4238) compared to the standard of care enalapril. Therefore, the study failed to 
meet its primary objective, i.e. demonstration of the superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril. 
In addition, these results question the added value of sacubitril in children, however it should be noted 
that a direct analyses of the added value is not possible as valsartan and enalapril, while similar, are 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 93/132
not the same. Furthermore, it is worth noting that enalapril, although standard of care, is currently not 
registered for pediatric heart failure.  
Given the lack of robust data supporting the efficacy of enalapril on hard outcomes, a direct 
assessment of the absolute efficacy is difficult. Therefore the focus is put on within-patient changes in 
secondary and exploratory outcomes. In these analyses, both sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril 
demonstrated improvements in NYHA/Ross class and PGIS, as well as measures of quality of life 
(PedsQL). Furthermore, both sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril lead to a large decrease in NT-proBNP.  
The similar exposure response and the large reductions in NT-proBNP, which are predictive of 
favourable clinical outcomes, coupled with the symptomatic and functional improvements from 
baseline observed in paediatric HF patients in Study B2319, can be used to infer clinical benefits of 
sacubitril/valsartan established in adults to the paediatric HF population.
Taking into consideration the totality of the evidence, including the extrapolation of efficacy data from 
adults, in which the combined effect of sacubitril and valsartan has been established, to pediatric HF 
populations with similar pathophysiology, sacubitril/valsartan provides clinically meaningful benefits to 
children and adolescents with HF due to systemic LVSD.
2.6.11.  Clinical safety
The totality of evidence included in this submission supporting the clinical safety of sacubitril/valsartan 
for paediatric use includes: 1) extrapolation of the existing adult HFrEF data from study B2314 
(PARADIGM-HF) to children based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from study 
B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) and 2) the clinical data provided by the PANORAMA-HF study.
2.6.11.1.  Extrapolation of clinical safety from adult to paediatric population. 
Given the similarities in disease between paediatric HF due to LVSD consistent with DCM and adult HF 
due to DCM and consistent with the principles of paediatric extrapolation outlined in the recent CHMP 
release of ICH E11A guidance, i.e. similar drug exposure at target doses and a similar decrease in NT-
proBNP at exposure matched doses, the safety assessment from Study B2319 is to be considered 
within the context of the already adequately characterized, well-established, safety profile of 
sacubitril/valsartan in adults. Based on the extrapolation plan (described in full under clinical efficacy), 
it can be considered a reasonable approach to extrapolate the safety profile from the adult to 
paediatric population. In the following sections, the safety data generated in Part 2 of Study B2319 
(N=375 total; N=187 sacubitril/valsartan; N=188 enalapril)) will be described and compared to the 
adult safety profile.
2.6.11.2.  Study B2319
2.6.11.2.1.  Patient exposure
The mean weight-based daily dose was 5.07 mg/kg for sacubitril/valsartan group and 0.33 mg/kg for 
the enalapril group.
The median duration of treatment exposure was similar between the treatment groups (365 days for 
sacubitril/valsartan and 364 days for enalapril). The overall exposure in Part 2 of Study B2319 was 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 94/132
also comparable between the treatment groups: 173.72 patient-years for sacubitril/valsartan and 
164.19 patient-years for enalapril.
Study drug was to be up-titrated every 2 weeks as tolerated by the patient to the target dose (dose 
level 4 for Age Groups 1 and 2, and 4x for Age Group 3; see section “Treatment” for further details) 
guided by safety monitoring criteria. Additional safety monitoring was required for Age Group 3 
patients with each initial dose level up-titration. 
Results for dose levels over time showed a slower up-titration than planned in the protocol. In the 
overall population, at Week 6, when all patients should have been up-titrated to dose level 4, 4.8% of 
patients were on dose level 1, 13.0% were on dose level 2, and 24.0% were on dose level 3, while 
53.9% were on dose level 4. By Week 8, 60.8% in sacubitril/valsartan group and 66.9% in enalapril 
group were on target dose level 4. The majority of patients reached dose level 4 at least once at any 
time point: 76.5% (143/187) for sacubitril/valsartan and 81.9% (154/188) for enalapril.
2.6.11.2.2.  Adverse events
General frequency of adverse events
Part 2 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs during Part 2 was comparable between 
sacubitril/valsartan (88.77%) and enalapril (87.77%) groups (Table 38). Deaths and drug-related AEs 
were less frequent for sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril, while SAEs and AEs requiring adjustment or 
interruption were more frequent for sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril. AEs leading to discontinuation 
study treatment were similar for the two treatment groups. Most of the AEs that led to study treatment 
discontinuation were SAEs, which tended to be lower overall with sacubitril/valsartan than enalapril. 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of severe AEs was 17.11% in 
sacubitril/valsartan and 21.28% in enalapril group [Study B2319-Table 14.3.1-3.2].
The safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan was consistent across the modified age groups (Table 38). 
The overall pattern of AEs in the age groups was generally similar to that observed for the overall 
population. As the sample size varied across the 3 age groups and the number of events in each age 
group was often small, comparisons between age groups should also be interpreted with caution.  Of 
note, the frequency of deaths, AEs/SAEs leading to discontinuation and drug-related AEs tended to be 
lower in the younger groups (Age Group 2a and Group 3a) than in the oldest group (Age Group 1), 
regardless of study treatment. Unlike the older groups, the youngest group (Age Group 3a) had lower 
frequencies of AEs/SAEs leading to discontinuation and drug-related AEs in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group compared with the enalapril group.

Most frequently occurring adverse events (Part 2)
The most commonly affected SOCs (incidence ≥ 20% in either group) were generally similar between 
the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (Table 39). Infections and infestations, the most 
frequently affected SOC, consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis, 
with no meaningful treatment differences. The sacubitril/valsartan group had a higher incidence of AEs 
in SOCs of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (mainly driven by pain in extremity, back 
pain and arthralgia) and renal and urinary disorders (mainly driven by renal impairment), while the 
enalapril group had a higher incidence of AEs in SOCs of injury, poisoning and procedural complications 
(not driven by one specific event) and reproductive system and breast disorders (not due to one 
specific event).
The pattern of AEs by SOCs was generally consistent between the modified age groups (Table 39). As 
the number of patients with AEs was low for many SOCs, particularly in the younger age groups, 
comparisons between age groups should be interpreted with caution.

There were no major imbalances in AEs by preferred term between the treatment groups for most of 
the frequently reported AEs (Table 40). Dizziness was more frequent in the sacubitril/valsartan group 
compared to the enalapril group, while hypotension occurred with similar frequency between the two 
treatment groups. Decreased glomerular filtration rate was more frequent in the enalapril group than 
in the sacubitril/valsartan group.
Many of the frequently reported AEs are common in children. Pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, 
and diarrhea were more frequent in younger children (Age Groups 2a and 3a) than in older children 
(Age Group 1), irrespective of the treatment group. Conversely, cardiac failure, dizziness, headache, 
abdominal pain, nausea, and hypotension were more frequent in older children. These age-related 
trends are not considered to be clinically meaningful. In young children, it is not unexpected that AEs 
that are overtly evident to caregivers or physicians (e.g., pyrexia, vomiting, diarrhea) are more 
frequently reported than AEs that require the patient to self-report (e.g., dizziness, headache, nausea).

The profile of frequently reported AEs by SOC and preferred term in Part 2 of study B2319 was 
consistent with events typically observed in children with HF and with the safety profile of 
sacubitril/valsartan reported in adults with HFrEF.
2.6.11.2.3.  Adverse drug reactions
No new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified during Study B2319 based on a comprehensive 
methodology for selecting and evaluating ADRs. The ADRs in the target population of paediatric 
patients with HF remained consistent with those previously observed in longer-term clinical trials in 
adults. 
A higher incidence and hence a change in the frequency category was observed for ADRs of diarrhoea, 
fatigue, headache, dizziness and cough in paediatric Study B2319 compared to the adult Study B2314. 
However, considering the small overall patient numbers and wide variability in the paediatric study, 
these findings should be interpreted with caution. 
While the incidence of these ADRs were higher in the paediatric HF population of Study B2319 than in 
adults with HFrEF, there are several considerations to take into account. Some ADRs are commonly 
observed in children and adolescents (e.g., diarrhoea, cough) or are a common symptom of HF (e.g., 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 98/132
fatigue). The frequencies of diarrhoea (13.4% in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 12.2% in the 
enalapril group) are comparable to the background rate of diarrhoea in this population (14.3% as 
observed in the placebo arm of ivabradine paediatric HF study; FDA 2019). The frequency of headache 
(11.8% with sacubitril/valsartan and 10.6% with enalapril) was lower than the estimated prevalence of 
headache in children and adolescents (Abu-Arafeh et al 2010). While dizziness was more frequently 
reported in the sacubitril/valsartan arm of Study B2319 than in Study B2314 (12.3% vs 6.3%), the 
majority of cases were mild and not suspected to be related to study drug and had resolved with no 
change to the sacubitril/valsartan dose.
2.6.11.2.4.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths 
As discussed in the efficacy section, a total of 20 deaths occurred in Part 2 of Study B2319. Fewer 
deaths were reported in the sacubitril/valsartan group (8 deaths, 4.28%) compared with the enalapril 
group (12 deaths, 6.38%) (Table 41). All but 2 deaths were adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths. Of 
the 2 non-cardiovascular deaths, one patient in the sacubitril/valsartan arm (Age Group 2a) who 
entered the study with acute myeloid leukaemia died of this malignancy, and one patient in the 
enalapril arm (Age Group 1) died due to respiratory failure.

Serious adverse events
The overall incidence of SAEs in Part 2 was comparable between the sacubitril/valsartan (36.90%) and 
enalapril (32.98%) groups (Table 42). Cardiac failure, the most frequently reported SAE by preferred 
term, occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups. SAEs of hypotension occurred only 
in the sacubitril/valsartan group (4 vs 0) and conversely, SAEs of hyperkalemia occurred only in the 
enalapril group (0 vs 2). Syncope SAEs occurred in 2 patients in enalapril group and 1 patient in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group. The number of patients with SAEs other than cardiac failure was small (≤5 
per group); hence comparisons of small numerical imbalances between treatment groups should be

interpreted with caution. There were no meaningful differences in SAEs across the modified age 
groups.

Safety topics of interest
Overall, the safety topics of interest showed largely similar frequencies between sacubitril/valsartan 
and enalapril groups (Figure 13 and Table 38). There were no relevant cases related to embryo-fetal 
toxicity or lethality, statin drug-drug interaction, cognitive impairment, neonatal or infantile toxicity 
through exposure to breast milk, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, or malignancy; hence these topics are 
not discussed further in this section.
Of note, cognitive impairment is a theoretical risk for sacubitril/valsartan because neprilysin is one of 
many enzymes involved in the metabolism of amyloid-β. The specific role of neprilysin in the 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation

pathogenesis of cognitive impairment remains unclear. There is currently no evidence of an increased 
risk of cognitive impairment (defined as the narrow SMQ ‘Dementia’) with sacubitril/valsartan 
treatment from 3 large Phase III adult cardiovascular studies (PARADIGM-HF, PARAGON-HF, and 
PARADISE-MI)  in over 18,900 HF patients.

EAIR (exposure adjusted incidence rate per 100 patient-year) is the number of patients with at least one TEAE of 
the STI category/[total exposure time (year)/100]. Rate difference (RD) is based on EAIR. Angioedema is AAC 
confirmed.

(Safety Set)
Hypotension
Hypotension is a known effect of sacubitril/valsartan based on its ARB and NEPI properties on lowering 
blood pressure. A higher incidence of hypotension AEs was observed in adults with HFrEF in Study 
B2314 (24.4% for sacubitril/valsartan vs 18.6% for enalapril). The majority of hypotension AEs in 
adults with HFrEF were preferred terms of hypotension and dizziness. There were no imbalances for 
events of greater clinical severity, such as syncope, pre-syncope, loss of consciousness, or depressed 
level of consciousness.
The profile of hypotension AEs in children with HF was largely consistent with that observed in adults 
with HFrEF. While hypotension AEs and blood pressure reductions during Part 2 of Study B2319 were 
more frequently reported for sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril across all age groups, the 
more severe events of syncope and pre-syncope were reported at a higher rate in the enalapril group 
and occurred only in the oldest age group.  
The overall incidence of hypotension AEs was comparable between the two treatment groups (Table 
44). By preferred term, the sacubitril/valsartan group had a comparable frequency of hypotension 
(12.30% vs 11.70%) but a higher frequency of dizziness (12.30% vs 7.98%), while the enalapril group 
had higher frequencies of syncope (1.07% vs 2.13%) and pre-syncope (0.53% vs 1.60%). Consistent 
with the observed effects on lowering blood pressure, greater proportions of patients in the 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 102/132
sacubitril/valsartan group had post-baseline reductions in systolic blood pressure compared to the 
enalapril group (Table 44). 
Most of the hypotension AEs were not serious and did not cause study treatment discontinuation. 
Hypotension SAEs were more frequent with sacubitril/valsartan than enalapril (Table 44). By preferred 
term, these SAEs consisted of hypotension (4 patients, 2.14% in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs 0 
patients in the enalapril group) and syncope (1 patient, 0.53% in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs 2 
patients, 1.06% in the enalapril group). One patient in the sacubitril/valsartan group discontinued 
study treatment due to a hypotension SAE.

Hyperkalemia
Hyperkalemia is known to occur with ACEI treatment due to RAAS blockage through inhibition of 
secretion of aldosterone. Hyperkalemia AEs and elevations in serum potassium were more frequently 
reported for the enalapril group compared with the sacubitril/valsartan group in adults with HFrEF.
The profile of hyperkalemia AEs in children with HF was consistent with that observed in adults with 
HFrEF. The incidence of hyperkalemia AEs was similar between the treatment groups during Part 2 of 
Study B2319 (Table 45). Hyperkalemia events that were serious or led to discontinuation were 
reported only in the enalapril group. 
Mild to moderate increases in serum potassium (>20% increase and >ULN or any value >6 mmol/L, 
and newly occurring ≥5.5 mEq/L or >6.0 mEq/L) were comparable between the two treatment groups 
(Table 5-7). More severe elevations (newly occurring >6.5 mEq/L) occurred only in the enalapril group 
(6 patients, 3.21%). 
Comparable trends were observed in oldest and youngest children (Age Groups 1 and 3a), while in 
children aged 2-<6 years (Age Group 2a) the sacubitril/valsartan group had more frequent 
hyperkalemia AEs (10.64% vs 5.26%) and newly occurring elevations of ≥5.5 mEq/L (17.39% vs 
8.11%) and >6.0 mEq/L (6.52% vs 0%) than the enalapril group.

Renal impairment has been observed with any therapy that blocks the RAAS by decreasing glomerular 
filtration. In Study B2314, the incidence of renal impairment AEs/SAEs was consistently lower with 
sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril in adults with HFrEF. Also, the percentages of adults with categorical 
eGFR decreases and notably abnormal serum creatinine elevations were lower in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared with the enalapril group.
Overall, the renal profile based on AEs and laboratory parameters in the paediatric HF population was 
comparable between the treatment groups. In Study B2319, the incidence of renal AEs was higher for 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared with the enalapril group (6.42% vs 4.26%) (Table 46). This 
difference was driven by mild renal AEs (3.21% vs 0.53%), while the frequencies of moderate (1.60% 
vs 2.13%) and severe renal AEs (1.60% in both groups) showed no treatment differences. The 
treatment groups also had identical frequencies of renal SAEs and AEs, leading to discontinuation 
(Table 46). 
Renal laboratory assessments further supported a comparable renal profile in the paediatric patients as 
seen in adults. The overall incidence of renal function abnormalities was lower for sacubitril/valsartan 
compared to enalapril (9.09% vs 11.70%) (Table 46). The two treatment groups had comparable 
frequencies of serum creatinine increases ≥25% and <50% vs baseline (7.49% vs 7.45%), while the 
sacubitril/valsartan group had a lower incidence of serum creatinine increase ≥ 50% vs baseline 
(1.07% vs 4.26%). These trends were consistent across the three age groups. Comparable frequencies 
of renal function abnormalities in the two treatment groups were observed in Age Group 1 (10.09% vs 
10.81%) and Age Group 2a (10.64% vs 10.53%), while in the youngest group, Age Group 3a, fewer 
renal events were observed in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs enalapril group (3.23% vs 15.38%).
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data was assessed by age group taking into account the 
different renal development phases in children. Healthy infants < 1 year of age tend to have a lower 
eGFR as their kidneys are still in development and therefore were analyzed separately. In Age Groups 
1 and 2 (i.e., 1-<18 years), categorical increases in creatinine and decreases in eGFR were comparable 
between the treatment groups throughout the study. In Age Group 3 (1 month-<1 year), a total of 7 
patients (4 patients, 80% in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 3 patients, 75% in the enalapril group) 
had an increase in eGFR of <30% throughout the study, which is lower than expected in children of 
that age.

NEP inhibition by sacubitril/valsartan has the potential to increase levels of the substrate bradykinin 
and cause angioedema. Unlike omapatrilat, which has shown to increase the risk for serious 
angioedema by inhibiting multiple enzymes responsible for the breakdown of the angioedema-mediator 
bradykinin, sacubitrilat delivered by sacubitril is a highly selective NEP inhibitor, and the ARB valsartan 
is known to have a lower risk of angioedema compared to ACEIs (Irons and Kumar 2003, Fryer et al 
2008, Toh et al 2012).
In Study B2314 (run-in and double-blind periods), the incidence of positively adjudicated angioedema 
was 0.31% (29 cases) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 0.24% (25 cases) in the enalapril group. 
Angioedema was more frequent in Black patients compared to non-Black patients (1.79% vs 0.44%). 
There were no angioedema cases involving airway compromise or requiring airway support. All 
confirmed cases were managed with no treatment or with antihistamines, catecholamine, or steroids.
In Study B2319 (Part 1 and Part 2), no patient in the sacubitril/valsartan group had positively 
adjudicated angioedema compared to one (0.53%) patient in the enalapril group during Part 2. This 
positively adjudicated case was reported in a Black patient in Age Group 1 (6->18 years) who was 
hospitalized but did not need mechanical airway protection and had no airway compromise. 
Hepatotoxicity
Patients with HF often experience increased liver enzymes due to liver congestion. The hepatic profile 
of sacubitril/valsartan does not suggest a hepatotoxic potential. In Study B2314 in adults, the 
incidence of AEs in the hepatotoxicity NMQ was 3.28% in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 4.35% in 
the enalapril group. The majority of liver-related AEs were of mild or moderate severity, and severe

EMA/172209/2023
Page 105/132
AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were infrequent and showed no differences between the 
treatment groups. 
In Study B2319 in paediatric patients, the incidence of hepatic AEs was higher in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared with the enalapril group (8.02% vs 5.32%). All hepatic AEs were 
mild (4.28% vs 3.19%) or moderate (3.74% vs 1.60%), except for one severe event (preferred term: 
ascites) in the enalapril group. One hepatic SAE (preferred term: ascites) was reported in 
sacubitril/valsartan group; this event was due to an increase in hepatic congestion and resolved with 
drainage. Hepatic AEs leading to discontinuation were reported only in the sacubitril/valsartan group (3 
patients, 1.60%) and consisted of non-serious events of increased hepatic enzyme, abnormal hepatic 
function, and hepatomegaly.
The incidence of newly occurring liver enzyme elevations was low and comparable between the 
treatment groups. One patient in each treatment group had elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST 
>20×ULN). The highest categorical values in the sacubitril/valsartan group were observed in the same 
patient who met the criteria for biochemical Hy’s law. This was a 9-year-old female patient who had a 
history of left ventricular non-compaction (idiopathic) and experienced worsening of cardiac failure 
followed by hepatomegaly due to hepatic congestion. The case was assessed by a blinded independent 
external liver safety expert to be consistent with heart failure deterioration and not related to study 
drug.
There were no major differences in liver enzyme elevations across the age groups. The majority of the 
elevations were reported in the oldest group and the frequencies, while low overall, were 2-3% higher 
in the sacubitril/valsartan group compared with the enalapril group (ALT>3×ULN: 4.26 vs 1.11%; 
ALT>5×ULN: 2.11% vs 0%). This oldest group also included the single patient with the highest 
elevation, as noted above. Liver enzyme elevations were infrequent and comparable in Age Groups 2a 
and 3a. 
Changes in bone growth and density
There was no evidence of increased risk of fractures or altered growth in either treatment group. 
Two patients in each of the sacubitril/valsartan (1.07%) and enalapril (1.06%) groups had AEs of 
fractures. In the sacubitril/valsartan group, there was a mild case of wrist fracture and a severe event 
of pathological fracture of the right femur (which resolved with surgery and no action taken with the 
study drug), both in the oldest age group. In the enalapril group, there was a mild event of clavicle 
fracture due to home injury (in Age Group 2a) and a moderate event of femur fracture in a patient 
with underlying osteopenia (in Age Group 3a). None of the fractures was considered related to the 
study drug or led to discontinuation.
The treatment groups had comparable increases in height and height Z-score during the study, and 
this result was consistent across the age groups
2.6.11.2.5.  Laboratory findings
The safety assessment of sacubitril/valsartan treatment during Part 2 epoch included a full panel of 
haematology, clinical chemistry laboratory evaluations and urinalysis at screening, Week 24, Week 52, 
and more frequently as deemed necessary by the Investigator; a smaller chemistry panel of 
electrolytes and renal function was collected at all in-person visits.
Haematology
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 106/132
Overall, the haematology results in the paediatric Study 2319 are consistent with the results in the 
adult Study B2314.
Mean haematology test results, as assessed via local or central labs, as shift from baseline or to 
minimum or maximum values, were generally balanced by treatment group and by age groups and in-
line with the known safety profile (Table 47).
Overall, clinically notable haematology parameters were infrequent (≤ 3.20%) and comparable 
between treatment groups. A > 50% increase in WBC count was observed in 1.60% of patients treated 
with sacubitril/valsartan vs 4.79% of patients treated with enalapril (Table 47). A similar trend was 
observed among the 3 age groups. These shifts in WBC counts were consistent with the incidence of 
concomitant transient infections in these paediatric patients.

Overall, the clinical chemistry results in the paediatric Study B2319 are consistent with the results in 
the adult Study B2314.
Notable clinical chemistry values, as measured by either the central laboratory or local laboratory are 
shown in Table 48. There were no clinically relevant differences in the incidence of the majority of 
laboratory parameters between treatment groups.
Numerically lower incidence in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs enalapril group were:

Mean change from baseline of clinical chemistry test results was similar between the two treatment 
groups, overall and among the 3 age groups. Any shifts from normal at baseline to high or low values 
post-baseline were similar between the two treatment groups.
Urinalysis
Only a few cases required full microscopic analysis as the majority of urine dipsticks were negative for 
abnormalities.

Not applicable. 
2.6.11.3.1.  Safety in special populations
Subgroup analyses of AEs (SOC and PT) reported during Part 2 of Study B2319 revealed no meaningful 
difference between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril in the incidences of AEs or safety topics of interest 
across the subgroups of age, race, region, sex, and prior ACEI/ARB status. 
Intrinsic factors
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 108/132
Analyses by factor
The following intrinsic factors were considered relevant to sacubitril/valsartan’s current safety topics of 
interest: sex, race, ethnicity, NYHA/Ross classification at baseline, history of renal disease at baseline, 
BP by quartiles at baseline, eGFR at baseline, liver disease at baseline, where applicable. These 
evaluations did not identify any meaningful difference. As the sample size was relatively small, the 
variability around frequencies of events within each category should be interpreted with caution.
The AESIs of Embryo-fetal toxicity, Anaphylaxis, Change in bone growth / density, and Malignancy 
reported few cases during Study B2319 and hence, no meaningful comparisons can be done for the 
intrinsic factor subgroups.
By AESI
The following observations were made regarding Hypotension:
AEs that belonged to Hypotension AESI presented relatively more frequently in Black enalapril-treated 
patients compared with sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients (11 out of 25 patients, 44.0%; 8 out of 23 
patients, 34.8%, respectively).
AEs that belonged to Hypotension AESI presented relatively more frequently 
insacubitril/valsartan-treated patients whose baseline systolic BP was in the first tertile compared with 
enalapril-treated patients (20 out of 56 patients, 35.7%; 12 out of 59 patients, 20.3%, respectively) 
and more frequently in enalapril-treated patients whose baseline systolic BP was in the second tertile 
compared with sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients (18 out of 65 patients, 27.7%; 11 out of 66 
patients, 16.7%, respectively).
The number of cases that reported Hyperkalemia events was low overall and, hence, no meaningful 
comparisons can be done for the intrinsic factor subgroups.
The following observations were made regarding Renal impairment:
AEs that belonged to Renal impairment AESI presented more frequently in sacubitril/valsartan-treated 
patients when NYHA/Ross was I/II at baseline compared with enalapril-treated patients (11 out of 160 
patients, 6.9%; 6 out of 159 patients, 3.8%, respectively). Upon individual case evaluation, the 
majority of the cases presented alternate explanations (acute decompensation, worsening HF, 
concomitant medication, sepsis, ongoing renal impairment).
The observations regarding Hepatotoxicity were not meaningfully different. Analyses by the various 
intrinsic factors were similar by treatment group.
The following observations were regarding Hypersensitivity:
AEs that belonged to Hypersensitivity AESI presented relatively more frequently in Black 
sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients compared to enalapril-treated patients (5 out of 23 patients; 
21.7%; 2 out of 25 patients, 8.0%, respectively).
Extrinsic factors
Safety during concomitant use of specific medications that are known to be related to specific risks, 
e.g. Statin drug-drug interaction or other medications, were investigated.
The following extrinsic factors were considered relevant to sacubitril/valsartan: ACEI, ARB, or MRA 
usage at screening; phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor usage post-baseline, potassium-sparing 
diuretics at baseline; alcohol history, and smoking status, where applicable.
No clinically relevant difference was observed between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril for AESIs and 
the extrinsic factors described above, except for the following:

By medication usage
AEs that belonged to Hypotension AESI presented more frequently in sacubitril/valsartan-treated 
patients compared to enalapril patients who did not use ACEI at screening (6 out of 19 patients; 
31.6%; 3 out of 17 patients; 17.6%). 
AEs that belonged to Renal impairment AESI presented more frequently in sacubitril/valsartan-treated 
patients compared to enalapril patients who did not use ACEI at screening (4 out of 19 patients, 
21.1%; 0 out of 17 patients).
By alcohol / smoking history
Although each patient’s alcohol history and substance usage was collected during Study B2319, an 
analysis was not considered warranted in this study population. With the exception of 1 patient who 
was a current smoker and 1 patient with a history of alcohol consumption, no other patient had alcohol 
or a smoking history. 
Importantly, safety results were consistent across the three age groups as described above for the 
overall profile of AEs, frequently reported AEs and frequently reported SAEs, and key safety topics of 
interest.
2.6.11.3.2.  Immunological events
No new data was generated.
2.6.11.3.3.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
No new data have been generated in support of this dossier.
During Study B2319, prohibited drugs for concomitant use were any ACEI, any ARB, and renin 
inhibitors. If any concomitant use was required (Section 5.1.2), sacubitril/valsartan was temporarily 
discontinued prior to the start of any open-label ARB or renin inhibitor; or temporary discontinuation of 
study drug more than 36 hours prior to starting open-label ACEI.
There were no relevant cases related to statin drug-drug interaction.
2.6.11.3.4.  Discontinuation due to adverse events
Overall, the rate of discontinuation was considered low (11.14%). However, death was the most 
frequent reason for treatment discontinuation (5.31%). 
Overall, 21 sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients (11.23%) and 21 enalapril-treated patients (11.17%) 
presented an AE that led to permanent discontinuation of the study drug (Table 49). By treatment 
group, AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug presented at a similar frequency. 
Cardiac failure was the most frequent event: 7 sacubitril/valsartan-treated patients (3.74%) and 
11 enalapril-treated patients (5.85%). All remaining AEs presented in ≤ 2 patients (≤ 1.07%) by 
treatment group.
SAE leading to study drug discontinuation
There were no meaningful differences in SAE leading to study drug discontinuation by treatment group 
and by age group observed (16 patients (8.56%) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 18 patients 
(9.57%) in the enalapril group).

Comparison with adult population
The profile of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the study drug was similar in adults during 
Study B2314. The frequencies of AEs causing permanent discontinuation of study drug in adults were 
low and comparable between treatment groups, as observed in the paediatric population during Study 
B2319.
The rate of AEs causing permanent discontinuation from the study drug was numerically lower for the 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril group (10.7% vs 12.2%). This was also the case 
for SAEs causing permanent discontinuation of the study drug (8.2% vs 9.4%). The most frequent AEs 
causing study drug discontinuation (i.e. AEs that occurred in ≥ 0.5% in either group) included cardiac 
failure (1.5%, each), cardiac death (0.67%, sacubitril/valsartan; 0.76%, enalapril), hypotension 
(0.62% vs 0.54%), sudden cardiac death (0.59% vs 0.52%), renal impairment (0.43% vs 0.78%), 
and sudden death (0.34% vs 0.50%). Discontinuation due to renal impairment was lower in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril group (0.4% vs 0.8%).

2.6.12.  Discussion on clinical safety
The safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan is adequately characterized in adults with more than 28,000 
patients in clinical studies and 6.0 million patient-treatment years of exposure in the post-marketing 
setting. 
Given the similarities in disease between paediatric HF due to LVSD consistent with DCM and adult HF 
due to DCM and consistent with the principles of paediatric extrapolation outlined in the recent CHMP 
release of ICH E11A guidance, i.e. similar drug exposure at target doses and a similar decrease in NT-
proBNP at exposure matched doses, the safety assessment from study B2319 is to be considered 
within the context of the already adequately characterized, well-established, safety profile of 
sacubitril/valsartan in adults. It is considered a reasonable approach to extrapolate the safety profile of 
adults to paediatrics, given the disease similarity, similar pharmacology and similar drug exposure.
The primary safety database to support registration of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric patients aged 1 
month to < 18 years with symptomatic HF due to LVSD is provided by Part 2 of Study B2319 (N=375 
total; N=187 sacubitril/valsartan; N=188 enalapril)) in which the exposure to treatment was 
approximately 52 weeks at the end of the trial. The safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan in study B2319 
is also assessed against the known safety profile of the HFrEF adult population (study B2314) with 
respect to key safety topics of interest.  
Patient exposure. The overall sample size of the safety database is acceptable and exceeds the 
minimal requirement of 100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year, as stated in ICH Topic E 1, 
which is reassuring. The overall patient-years on-treatment was similar between groups (173.72 for 
sacubitril/valsartan and 164.19 for enalapril). Most patients in both treatment groups had exposure ≥ 
6 months (87.20% (n=168) and 89.84% (n=159) for sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril, respectively). 
Although up-titration occurred slower than planned, the proportion of patients reaching the target dose 
level at one point in time was 77% for sacubitril/valsartan and 82% for enalapril. The mean weight-
based daily dose was 5.07 mg/kg for sacubitril/valsartan group and 0.33 mg/kg for the enalapril 
group. 
Adverse events. The overall incidence of AEs during study B2319 was comparable between the 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (88.8% and 87.8%, respectively). The majority of AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity. Deaths and drug-related AEs were less frequent for sacubitril/valsartan 
vs enalapril (4.3% vs 6.4% and 26.7% vs 28.2%, respectively), while SAEs and AEs requiring 
adjustment or interruption were more frequent for sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril (36.9% vs 33.0% 
and 20.3% vs 17.0%, respectively). The safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan was consistent across the 
modified age groups, with minor differences (i.e. less death and drug-related AE in youngest age 
groups). Infections and infestations were the most frequently affected system organ class. These 
consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis, with no meaningful 
treatment differences. 
The most common AEs (at least 10%) were pyrexia (20.9% vs 18.1% for sacubitril/valsartan vs 
enalapril, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (20.9% vs 18.6%), cough (19.3% vs 20.2%), 
vomiting (18.1% vs 21.3%), nasopharyngitis (15.5% vs 9.0%), cardiac failure (14.4% vs 14.4%), 
diarrhoea (13.4% vs 12.2%), dizziness (12.3% vs 8.0%), hypotension (12.3% vs 11.7%), headache 
(11.8% vs 10.6%), and fatigue (10.2% vs 7.5%). A higher incidence and hence a change in the 
frequency category was observed for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of diarrhoea, fatigue, headache, 
dizziness and cough in paediatric Study B2319 compared to the adult Study B2314. It should be noted 
that most of these AE are commonly observed in children and adolescents (e.g., diarrhoea, cough) are 
a common symptom of HF (e.g., fatigue). The frequencies of diarrhoea (13.4% in sacubitril/valsartan 
group and 12.2% in enalapril group) are comparable to the background rate of diarrhoea in this 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 113/132
population, and the frequency of headache (11.8% with sacubitril/valsartan and 10.6% with enalapril) 
was lower than the estimated prevalence of headache in children and adolescents. While dizziness was 
more frequently reported in the sacubitril/valsartan arm of Study B2319 than in Study B2314 (12.3% 
vs 6.3%), the majority of cases were mild and not suspected to be related to the study drug and had 
resolved with no change to the sacubitril/valsartan dose. 
Deaths. The proportion of reported deaths is relatively low, with fewer deaths in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group (4.3% (n=8)) compared with the enalapril group (6.4% (n=12)), which is 
reassuring. All but 2 deaths were adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths.
Serious AEs. The incidence of SAE was relatively high and slightly higher in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group compared with the enalapril group (36.9% vs 33.0%, respectively). Sacubitril/valsartan is 
known to have a larger effect on blood pressure than enalapril, which partially explains why the SAEs 
of hypotension only occurred in the sacubitril/valsartan group (n=4). Nevertheless, no other pattern 
indicative for a safety signal could be identified. The majority of serious adverse events were cardiac 
failures, which is in line with the progressive nature and poor prognosis of paediatric heart failure, and 
occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups. The number of patients with SAEs other 
than cardiac failure was small (≤5 per group), which is reassuring.
Safety topics of interest. Overall, the safety topics of interest showed largely similar frequencies 
between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups. There were no relevant cases related to embryo-
fetal toxicity or lethality, statin drug-drug interaction, cognitive impairment, neonatal or infantile 
toxicity through exposure to breast milk, anaphylaxis, or malignancy. 
The frequency of hypotension-based AEs was similar between the treatment groups in study B2319 
and comparable to the incidence of hypotension-based AEs in the sacubitril/valsartan group of study 
B2314. The profile of hyperkalaemia AEs in paediatric HF was consistent with that observed in adults 
with HFrEF. The incidence of hyperkalemia AEs was also similar between the treatment groups in the 
paediatric study B2319. In Study B2319, the incidence of renal AEs was slightly higher for 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared with the enalapril group (6.4% vs 4.3%), yet lower than the 
incidence in the adult population (which was 10.1 vs 11.5%). No patient in the sacubitril/valsartan 
group had positively adjudicated angioedema. 
Hepatic AEs were reported in higher frequency in the paediatric study B2319 compared with the adult 
study B2314 (3.3% vs 8.0%). Furthermore, in study B2319, the incidence of hepatic AEs was higher 
for sacubitril/valsartan as compared to enalapril (8.0% vs 5.3%). The individual hepatic PTs reported 
in the sacubitril/valsartan group were heterogeneous in nature and none showed evidence of causality 
to study treatment. Thus it is considered reasonable and acceptable that it is not included in the SmPC. 
There is preclinical evidence suggesting a possible risk of growth retardation and decreased bone 
mineral density in the paediatric population. However, there was no increased risk of fractures or 
altered growth in either treatment group in B2319. The treatment groups had comparable increases in 
height and height Z-score during the study, and this result was consistent across the age groups. 
Laboratory findings. Overall, both the hematology and clinical chemistry results in the paediatric 
study B2319 are consistent with the results in the adult study B2314. No large treatment differences 
were found between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril, besides uric acid. For serum uric acid 
concentration the incidence of 50% increase was 6% in the sacubitril/valsartan arm and 2% in the 
enalapril arm, with the highest incidence in age group 1. Elevated serum uric acid concentration has 
been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but this may be due to unmeasured 
confounders. Hyperuricemia is common in many forms of cardiovascular disease, including HF. In 
patients with HF, higher serum uric acid concentration has been associated with worse clinical 
outcomes. Interestingly, in B2314, during the run-in period, serum uric acid decreased when switching 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 114/132
from enalapril to sacubitril/valsartan and remained lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the 
enalapril group at 4, 12, and 24 months after randomization. No causal relationship was found between 
>50% increase in uric acid levels and sacubitril/valsartan use. Furthermore, the PT hyperuricemia was 
reported in 0 patients in the sacubitril/valsartan arm and 1 (0.53%) in enalapril arm and PT Blood uric 
acid increased was reported in 1 patient (0.53%) in sacubitril/valsartan and 2 patients (1.06%) in 
enalapril arm. 
Safety in special populations. Analyses of adverse events of special interest by intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors demonstrated that in paediatric patients, hypersensitivity was more frequently 
reported in black patients. Evaluation of the 5 cases of hypersensitivity in black patients revealed that 
these were all mild or moderate, recovered with no change to study treatment and were evaluated to 
be not related to sacubitril/valsartan by the investigator. Given the benign nature of the events 
reported and the lack of causality relationship to sacubitril/valsartan based on the individual case 
review, the finding that hypersensitivity PTs were more frequently reported in Black pediatric patients 
is not considered to be clinically meaningful.
The safety of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric patients with renal or hepatic impairment could not be 
investigated adequately due to exclusion criterion (Patients with significant renal (eGFR calculated 
using the modified Schwartz formula < 30% mean GFR for age); hepatic (serum aspartate 
aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase > 3 times upper limit of normal); gastrointestinal or 
biliary disorders (that could impair absorption, metabolism, or excretion of orally administered 
medications). The limited safety data are available in paediatric patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment or moderate to severe renal impairment has been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Discontinuations due to AEs. The proportion of AEs leading to discontinuations was comparable 
between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (11.2% each). Most of the AEs that led to study 
treatment discontinuation were SAEs, which tended to be lower overall with sacubitril/valsartan than 
enalapril (8.6% vs 9.6%).
Post marketing experience. The additional assessment of post-marketing data, with a cut-off of 31 
Jan 2022, revealed no new safety signals and/or substantial change to the safety profile of 
sacubitril/valsartan in adults. The known important identified risks with sacubitril/valsartan are 
Hypotension, Renal impairment, Hyperkalemia, Angioedema, and Embryo-fetal toxicity / Lethality. The 
important potential risks with sacubitril/valsartan are: Neonatal / infantile toxicity through exposure 
from breast milk, Hepatotoxicity, Cognitive impairment, and Statin drug-drug interaction.
2.6.13.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
In conclusion, the safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric patients aged 1 month to < 18 
years with symptomatic HF due to systemic LVSD is generally consistent with the well-established 
safety profile in adults with HF. No new safety signal was observed in the paediatric population of 
Study B2319. The ADRs in paediatric patients were generally consistent with those already identified in 
adults.
Safety data on important safety topics of interest, such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal 
impairment, angioedema, and hepatotoxicity, were consistent with extensive prior experience in 
adults, with only hepatotoxicity having a higher incidence in the paediatric population. In addition, 
there was no evidence of any embryo-fetal toxicity/lethality or any growth-related impact in paediatric 
patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan.
The safety profile observed in Study B2319 was broadly consistent across the age groups,

encompassing children aged 1 month to < 18 years of age. However, as there were only 9 patients 
aged 1 year or less, there is insufficient information on the safety of sacubitril/valsartan in this 
youngest patient population.

The section “juvenile toxicity” in the table in module SI was updated to reflect the current data, which 
indicates that bone is a target organ together with growth retardation for sacubitril in juvenile rats with 
a safety margin lower than exposure in the human paediatric population. In the clinical paediatric 
study (B2319) no increased risk of fractures and altered growth was observed. In addition, increases in 
height and height Z-score were comparable between treatment and age groups. Nonetheless, the 
duration of this clinical study may be too short to detect long-term changes in growth. 
In addition, module SII was updated to reflect that the risk of long-term effects on growth, bone 
growth and mineralisation observed in the rat juvenile toxicity studies is considered important for 
inclusion to the RMP as an important potential risk. The important potential risk was phrased as “long-
term effects on growth, bone growth and mineralisation in the paediatric population”. 
2.7.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan
The pharmacovigilance plan was updated to include the extension study PANOROMA-HF in the RMP as 
a category 3 PASS. 
In the overview table 10-2 in Part III.1: Ongoing and planned additional pharmacovigilance activities, 
the added row under the heading Category 3 is inserted below.

Page 116/132
The PANORAMA-HF extension study (CLCZ696B2319E1) was considered relevant for inclusion in the 
RMP as additional PhV activity. The study will provide robust information to further characterise the 
important potential risk ‘Effects on growth, bone growth and mineralization’. 
2.7.3.  Risk minimisation measures
The Table Part V.1: “Description of routine risk minimization measures by safety concern” was updated 
with the following information with regard to the newly added important potential risk:
For the new important potential risk “long-term effects on growth, bone growth and mineralisation in 
the paediatric population” routine RMM are considered sufficient, given that the Applicant added at the 
end of Section 5.3 of the SmPC a statement: “However, long term paediatric data on (bone)growth 
and fracture rate is not available.”
2.7.4.  Conclusion
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 4.2 is acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Sacubitril/valsartan is a fixed-dose combination of a neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril) and an angiotensin 
receptor blocker (ARB)(valsartan). The resulting increase in natriuretic peptide (NP) activity due to 
neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
(RAAS) activity through angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor blockade have complementary effects on 
the cardiovascular system potentiating vasodilation, enhancing natriuresis, and promoting 
antihypertrophic/antifibrotic effects. 
Regulatory status and proposed indication
Sacubitril/valsartan is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with heart failure (HF) 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The registration of sacubitril/valsartan in adults was based on 
results from study B2314 (PARADIGM-HF), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril 
on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. 
Compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan reduced the risk of the composite of CV death or first HF 
hospitalization by 20% (HR 0.80, 1-sided p<0.001); reduced the risk of CV death by 20% (HR 0.80, 1-
sided p<0.001); and reduced the risk of first HF hospitalization by 21% (HR 0.79, 1-sided p<0.001).

The current application is a grouped variation for extension of indication (type II variation) and a line 
extension. Aligned with the grouping examples laid out in Article 7.2 (b) of the Variation Regulation 
(Reg. 1234/2008), the line extension of the marketing authorization is being grouped with the type II 
variation as both changes are linked. The Applicant aims to provide evidence supporting the extension 
of sacubitril/valsartan use for the treatment of paediatric patients with HF with left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction (LVSD) in children and adolescents 1 year of age and older based on a paediatric 
extrapolation plan in conjunction with the results of the pivotal clinical trial B2319 (PANORAMA-HF). 
Furthermore, the Applicant has developed a novel pharmaceutical form, i.e. granules in capsules for 
opening, used within study B2319 to enable accurate and convenient administration of 
sacubitril/valsartan to the paediatric HF population. 
Paediatric heart failure and treatment goals
Paediatric HF is a chronic condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality, frequent 
hospitalization and medical care, and poor quality of life. The reported prevalence was up to 83.3 per 
100,000 children and adolescents in Spain. The two most common causes of paediatric HF are 
congenital heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy. Treatment goals are similar to those for adult 
patients with heart failure, minimize morbidity and mortality and improve functional status and quality 
of life.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
In contrast to adult HF, there is no therapy approved for the treatment of paediatric HF in the 
European Union. Paediatric HF patients are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEIs) (often enalapril), beta-blockers, and spironolactone, which represents off-label use. ACEIs are 
considered as the first line therapy in paediatric chronic HF, which was also recognized by the World 
health organization and also the EMA in the Report on the Expert Group Meeting of Paediatric Heart 
Failure in 2010. These recommendations for paediatric HF treatment are based predominantly on 
small, single-centre, open-label studies of ACEIs in children with HF caused by LVSD. The efficacy of 
the off-label treatment on hard outcomes such as mortality is unknown, given the difficulties in 
adequately powering such trials. Due to the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and aetiologies, 
developing therapeutic strategies in paediatric HF is extremely challenging. Due to the lack of these 
randomized controlled studies, there also are no age-appropriate formulations of this off-label 
medication, i.e. enalapril. Based on the morbidity and mortality associated with paediatric HF, the 
absence of approved therapy and corresponding paediatric formulations, there is a significant unmet 
medical need for well-studied efficacious treatments with acceptable safety in this population.
3.1.3.  Extrapolation plan
In line with ICH E11A, the Applicant proposes that the results from study B2314 (PARADIGM-HF, adult 
study, shortly described above) can be extrapolated to the paediatric population based on disease 
similarity, similar drug pharmacology (exposure), similar exposure-response and a predictive 
biomarker to bridge efficacy between adult and paediatric populations. 
Disease similarity was proposed by the applicant between adults with HFrEF based on DCM and 
paediatric heart failure patients with LVSD consistent with DCM. This has also been highlighted in the 
draft ICH E11A 2022 guideline "... heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy is similar between adult 
and paediatric populations, allowing for extrapolation from adult to paediatric patients with dilated 
cardiomyopathy". Dilated cardiomyopathy is considered a form of heart muscle disease (abnormal 
ventricular myocardium) whose primary abnormality is systolic dysfunction. While dilation is also a 
component of this disease, it can be agreed that treatment strategies in children are based on signs, 
symptoms, and the degree of systolic dysfunction. PANORAMA-HF aimed to enrol a homogeneous 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 119/132
population of pediatric HF with left ventricle systolic dysfunction (LVSD) consistent with DCM. HCM and 
RCM, along with uncorrected structural heart disease and single ventricle or systemic right ventricle, 
were excluded. Enrolment of a homogeneous pediatric HF population with LVSD consistent with DCM in 
PANORAMA-HF was thus achieved by defining a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria, ensuring all 
pediatric patients had symptomatic HF and HfrEF defined as LVSD. More than 60% of patients in 
PANORAMA-HF were diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, with the cause being idiopathic in 33.6%, 
followed by familial/genetic conditions in 15.7% and congenital heart malformations in 13.3%. Heart 
failure secondary to other causes was noted in about 35% of patients. In those 35% of patients where 
the aetiology of HF was not primarily identified as related to cardiomyopathy, it is known from 
literature, that all can evolve into or manifest as DCM. In particular, the most frequent cause was 
myocarditis-induced HF, which itself is the most common cause of acquired DCM in children. In 
PANORAMA-HF, while there was no collection of echocardiographic data regarding ventricle volumes or 
diameters to confirm a diagnosis of DCM, all diseases included are known to evolve or manifest as 
DCM. Additionally, patients with restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were excluded. 
Nonetheless, as recommended by treatment guidelines, the treatment of heart failure in children is 
based on pathophysiology, hence based on systolic vs. diastolic dysfunction and based on approved 
adult HFrEF therapies. 
In conclusion, all patients enrolled in PANORAMA-HF were diagnosed with LVSD, while patients with 
HCM, RCM, and complex congenital heart disease with functional single ventricle or systemic right 
ventricle were excluded. Despite the lack of LV diameter measurement, the literature and clinical 
practice support that all enrolled pediatric patients with systemic LVSD also had a form of DCM. 
Furthermore, both adult HFrEF with DCM and pediatric HF due to LVSD have similar pathophysiology, 
including a reduced cardiac output due to left ventricle insufficiency, which causes reduced organ 
perfusion, increased adrenergic tone, and RAAS activation. These translate into increased sodium 
retention and increased volume, which can further worsen left ventricle function.
Similar drug pharmacology was established by demonstrating that sacubitrilat and valsartan drug 
exposure in paediatric HF patients is similar to exposure in adult heart HF at the same dose (Age 
Groups 1 and 2) with the ratios of geometric means of drug exposure (AUC children /AUC adults) being 
0.80-0.92 and 0.99 1.29 for sacubitrilat and valsartan, respectively. Age Group 3 showed 
corresponding AUC changes consistent with the dose change (dose was initially 50% reduced 
considering the potential impact of developing capacity of drug disposition), with the ratios of 
geometric means of the drug exposure (AUC children/AUC adults) being 0.39 and 0.61 for sacubitrilat 
and valsartan, respectively.
Similar exposure response was established by demonstrating a similar magnitude of NT-proBNP 
reductions at exposure-matched doses of sacubitril/valsartan in the paediatric study B2319 and adult 
study B2314. The ratio of NT-proBNP relative to baseline between paediatric HF patients (3.1 mg/kg) 
and adult HF patients (200 mg) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.89), while when compared to adult HF 
patients with DCM it was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.2). 
NT-proBNP as a bridging biomarker for extrapolation of effects in adults with DCM to the paediatric 
population was assessed using the Prentice criteria. The Prentice criteria provide a systematic 
framework to establish the adequacy of NT-proBNP as a bridging biomarker. This includes a 
demonstration that the treatment has a significant impact on the true clinical endpoint, the treatment 
has a significant impact on the biomarker, the biomarker is significantly associated with the true 
clinical endpoint and that the biomarker explains the effect of treatment on the true clinical endpoint. 
Study B2314 in adults with HFrEF with DCM demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan treatment 
significantly impacts the true clinical endpoint of reducing the risk of CV death or HF hospitalizations 
compared to enalapril (RRR:25%) (1st Prentice criterion). In the same subgroup of adult patients with 
HFrEF with DCM, the reduction in NT-proBNP from baseline was 43% at Month 1, and 52% at Month 8 
in the sacubitril/valsartan arm, indicating that the treatment has a significant impact on the biomarker 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 120/132
NT-proBNP (2nd Prentice criterion). Furthermore, a change in plasma NT-proBNP was associated with 
the CV mortality/HF hospitalization rate in adult patients with HFrEF with DCM in study B2314, 
indicating that the biomarker is significantly associated with true clinical endpoint (3rd Prentice 
criterion). The results were similar for the subpopulation of adults with HFrEF with DCM. The 
association between NT-proBNP and risk of clinical events was similarly observed in paediatric patients 
(B2319), where a doubling of NT-proBNP levels at baseline or post-baseline was associated, 
respectively, with 1.8-fold and 2.1-fold increase in the risk of Category 1 or 2 events. Lastly, study 
B2314 in adults with HFrEF demonstrated that most of the sacubitril/valsartan treatment effect on the 
time to first event of CV death or HF hospitalization endpoint is explained by NT-proBNP over time (4th 
Prentice criterion). The proportion of treatment effect explained on top of baseline NT-ProBNP was 
85.55%, with the 95% CI (6.35%, 164.76%) excluding zero. Robustness of these analyses was 
confirmed using sensitivity analyses.
3.1.4.  Main clinical studies
Study B2319 (PANORAMA-HF) is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sacubitril/valsartan (part 1) followed by a 52-week 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in paediatric patients from 1 month to < 18 years of age 
with HF due to systemic LVSD (part 2). Patients were required to have NYHA classification II-IV (older 
children: 6 to <18 years old) or Ross CHF classification II-IV, systemic left ventricular ejection fraction 
(EF) ≤ 45% or fractional shortening ≤22.5%, and receive chronic HF therapy. In part 2, 377 patients 
were randomized 1:1 to sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril. The target sacubitril/valsartan dose was 3.1 
mg/kg twice daily for patients >1 year and 2.3 mg/kg twice daily for patients <1 year. The target 
enalapril dose was 0.2 mg/kg twice daily for patients >1 year and 0.15 mg/kg for patients <1 year. 
The efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril after 52-week of double-blind treatment was 
assessed using a global rank primary endpoint. The ranking was based on clinical events (such as 
death, listing for urgent heart transplant, mechanical life support requirement at the end of study), 
worsening HF, NYHA/Ross class, Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), and paediatric quality of 
life inventory (PedsQL) physical functioning domain. Key secondary/exploratory endpoints included 
individual components of the global rank primary endpoint and change in NT-proBNP from baseline.
3.2.  Favourable effects
Study B2319 
The analysis of the Global Rank primary endpoint was numerically in favour of sacubitril/valsartan over 
enalapril, with a Mann-Whitney probability (>0.5 indicates numerically in favour of sacubitril/valsartan) 
estimate of 0.5244 (95% CI 0.4665,  0.5817, p=0.42) compared to the standard of care enalapril. 
Secondary outcomes:
Compared to baseline, both the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril arm significantly improved in 
NYHA/Ross functional class. At Week 52, 37.7% of patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 
34.0% of patients in the enalapril group had improvement, and approximately half of all patients were 
stable (no change in NYHA/Ross class). The odds ratio for a favourable outcome (sacubitril/valsartan 
over enalapril) at Week 52 was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.68). Improvements in NYHA/Ross class were 
observed in all age groups.
Regarding the change in the patient global impression of severity (PGIS) from baseline, a high 
proportion of patients in both treatment groups experienced clinically relevant improvement or were 
stable during the study. At week 52, 35.53% of patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 34.81% 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 121/132
of patients in the enalapril group had improvement at Week 52, and nearly half of all patients were 
stable (i.e. no change in PGIS). The odds ratio for a favourable outcome (sacubitril/valsartan over 
enalapril) at Week 52 was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.80). Improvements in PGIS status were observed in 
all age groups. The results of subgroup analyses for the secondary endpoints were generally 
comparable across subgroups, with no consistent trends observed.
Exploratory outcomes
During 52 weeks of treatment, both the sacubitril/valsartan and the enalapril group demonstrated 
significant decreases in NT-proBNP from baseline. The adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline was 
0.35 (95% CI: 0.29 – 0.42) in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.31 – 0.47) in the 
enalapril group. 
The Applicant calculated the reference change values (RCV) based on the intra-individual variation of 
NT-proBNP, described in the literature. Using several RCV thresholds (i.e., 22%, −33%, −46%, and 
−61%), the applicant demonstrated numerically consistently higher rates of responders in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril group for each threshold. For the thresholds of -
33% and -46%, the odds ratio (95% CI) (sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril) were 2.04 (1.21; 3.44) 
and 2.12 (1.27; 3.52), respectively. 
Paediatric quality of life (PedsQL) change from baseline demonstrated improvements (i.e. a higher 
score) in both patient-reported and parent-reported total PedsQL scores in both treatment groups. 
Patient-reported mean PedsQL scores increased to 4.8 for the sacubitril/valsartan group and 1.72 for 
the enalapril group. Similarly, parent-reported total PedsQL scores increased by 5.5 and 3.7, 
respectively.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Study B2319
Primary outcome
The analysis of the Global Rank primary endpoint did not show a statistically significant difference 
between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups, with a Mann-Whitney probability (>0.5 indicates 
numerically in favour of sacubitril/valsartan) estimate of 0.5244 (95% CI 0.4665,  0.5817, p=0.42) 
compared to the standard of care enalapril. Therefore, the study failed to meet its primary objective, 
i.e., demonstrating the superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril. The primary analyses were 
consistent across age groups and in sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, including per protocol 
analyses. In addition, the results for the primary endpoint were consistent across subgroups, including 
gender, region, race and COVID-19 impacted period. 
Secondary outcomes
The study also failed to meet its secondary objectives, i.e. demonstration of superiority of 
sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril over the relevant secondary endpoints were the (time to) category 1 
or category 2 events, NYHA/Ross functional class change from baseline and global impression of 
severity change from baseline. 
The proportion of patients with a Category 1 events (Death; UNOS status 1A listing for a heart 
transplant; VAD/ECMO/mechanical ventilation/intra-aortic balloon pump requirement) was numerically 
lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group (10.2%) compared to the enalapril group (16.0%). However, no 
significant difference was observed between treatment groups in time to the first category 1 event 
(adjusted HR:  0.64, 95% CI: 0.32 – 1.28; P=0.20).
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 122/132
The proportion of patients with category 2 events (worsening of heart failure with/without 
hospitalization with/without ICU stay) was numerically higher in the sacubitril/valsartan arm compared 
to the enalapril arm (10% vs 5%). This was partially due to the higher number of patients on enalapril 
having a category 1 event, as patients with both category 1 and category 2 events were excluded from 
category 2 events. If these patients were counted, the proportion of patients with category 2 events 
was more similar between the groups (17% vs 14%). Similarly, as for time to first category 1 events, 
there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in time to first category 2 event 
and combined category 1 or 2 events (sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril adjusted HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 
0.72-2.03; p= 0.470 and sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril adjusted HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.66- 1.72; 
p=0.78, respectively).
NT-proBNP changes. Analyses of change in NT-proBNP during study B2319 demonstrated that besides 
sacubitril/valsartan, enalapril also demonstrated a 62% decrease in NT-proBNP. Therefore, in contrast 
to adults, there was no significant difference between sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril in the 
percentage of NT-proBNP decrease. It is unknown whether this reflects a higher efficacy of enalapril in 
paediatrics or a lack of added value of sacubitril, given the similar mechanism between valsartan and 
enalapril. However, a direct analyses on the added value of sacubitril cannot be made, as valsartan 
and enalapril, while similar, are not the same.   
Overall, for patients younger than 1 year (age group 3), the interpretation is very limited as only 9 
patients in this age group were enrolled (should be noted that the proposed indication is for children 
>1 year based on this lack of data)
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Adverse events. The overall incidence of AEs during study B2319 was comparable between the 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril groups (88.8% and 87.8%, respectively). Infections and infestations 
was the most frequently affected system organ class. These consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract 
infection and nasopharyngitis, with no meaningful treatment differences. The most common AEs (at 
least 10%) were pyrexia (20.9% vs 18.1% for sacubitril/valsartan vs enalapril, respectively), upper 
respiratory tract infection (20.9% vs 18.6%), cough (19.3% vs 20.2%), vomiting (18.1% vs 21.3%), 
nasopharyngitis (15.5% vs 9.0%), cardiac failure (14.4% vs 14.4%), diarrhoea (13.4% vs 12.2%), 
dizziness (12.3% vs 8.0%), hypotension (12.3% vs 11.7%), headache (11.8% vs 10.6%), and fatigue 
(10.2% vs 7.5%). No new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were identified during Study B2319.
Adverse events of special interest. The frequency of hypotension-based AEs was slightly higher in 
the sacubitril/valsartan than in the enalapril group (23% vs 21%); however, comparable to the 
incidence of hypotension-based AEs in the sacubitril/valsartan group (24%) of the adults study B2314.
The frequency of hyperkalaemia-based AEs was similar between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril 
group (5% vs 5%) and lower than in sacubitril/valsartan group (12%) of the adults study B2314. 
The frequency of renal impairment-based AEs was higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the 
enalapril group (6.4% vs 4.3%) but lower than in the sacubitril/valsartan group of study B2314 (10%).
The frequency of hepatic AEs was higher for the sacubitril/valsartan group than in the enalapril group 
(8.0% vs 5.3%) and occurred in a higher frequency in the paediatric study B2319 compared with the 
adult study B2314 (3.3%).  
Hypersensitivity occurred in 12% of the sacubitril/valsartan arm and 11% of the enalapril arm. The 
frequency of hypersensitivity was higher in the paediatric population as compared to study B2314 
Assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an extension of indication variation 
EMA/172209/2023
Page 123/132
(8%). Deaths. The proportion of reported deaths is relatively low, with fewer deaths in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group (4.3% (n=8)) compared with the enalapril group (6.4% (n=12)). All but 2 
deaths were adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths.
SAEs. The incidence of SAE was relatively high and slightly higher in the sacubitril/valsartan group 
compared with the enalapril group (36.9% vs 33.0%, respectively). Sacubitril/valsartan is known to 
have a larger effect on blood pressure than enalapril, which partially explains why the SAEs of 
hypotension only occurred in the sacubitril/valsartan group (n=4). Nevertheless, no other pattern 
indicative for a safety signal could be identified. The majority of serious adverse events were a cardiac 
failure, which is in line with the progressive nature and poor prognosis of paediatric heart failure, and 
occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups. The number of patients with SAEs other 
than cardiac failure was small (≤5 per group).
Discontinuations due to AEs. The proportion of AEs leading to discontinuations was comparable 
between the sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril group (11.2% each). Most of the AEs that led to study 
treatment discontinuation were SAEs, which tended to be lower overall with sacubitril/valsartan than 
enalapril (8.6% vs 9.6%).
Age subgroups. The general safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan was consistent across all 3 age 
groups studied during Study B2319.
Post marketing experience. The additional assessment of post-marketing data, with a cut-off of 31 
Jan 2022, revealed no new safety signals and/or substantial change to the safety profile of 
sacubitril/valsartan in adults.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Adverse events of special interest. 
Although the absence of angioedema in study B2319 appears reassuring, it should be noted that the 
incidence of angioedema was 0.5% in the sacubitril/valsartan group of study B2314. Therefore, the 
absence of angioedema in study B2319 may be due to the roughly 20 times lower sample size rather 
than a true absence in the paediatric population.
Preclinical evidence suggests a possible risk of growth retardation and decreased bone mineral density 
in the paediatric population. These bone findings do not appear to be related to the on-target effects of 
neprilysin inhibition in the bone. The absence of an increased risk of fractures or altered growth in 
either treatment group is reassuring. Nonetheless, the duration of the study may be too short to detect 
long-term changes in growth.
Monocomponent sacubitril. The neprilysin inhibitor (NEPi) component sacubitril of 
sacubitril/valsartan is not separately investigated in the target population, and its safety profile as a 
single component remains unknown.
Renal and hepatic impairment. The safety of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment could not be investigated adequately since these patients were excluded.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Given the high mortality and morbidity associated with paediatric HF and the absence of approved 
paediatric HF therapy, there is a significant unmet medical need for approved treatments with 
demonstrated benefits, acceptable safety, appropriate posology and age-appropriate formulation in 
this specific population. 
This extension of indication application for the use of sacubitril/valsartan in paediatric HF patients is 
based on an extrapolation of the results in adult patients with HFrEF of study B2314 (PARADIGM-HF) to 
the paediatric population using the principles for paediatric extrapolation as stated in the ICH E11A, as 
well as efficacy and safety data generated from study B2319 (PANORAMA-HF).
Extrapolation plan
The Applicant conducted an extrapolation of the results in adults of study B2314 (PARADIGM) to the 
paediatric population, based on the principles for paediatric extrapolation ICH E11A. In the 
extrapolation, the applicant adequately demonstrated disease similarity, similar drug pharmacology 
(exposure), and a similar exposure-response (NT-proBNP decrease) in the reference and target 
population. Furthermore, the applicant demonstrated that the Prentice criteria were fulfilled (with 
sufficient robustness) and that NT-proBNP can be considered as a bridging biomarker to extrapolate 
the results from study B2314 to the paediatric population. It should be noted that we deliberately 
chose to speak about a bridging biomarker rather than a surrogate biomarker (which is used in the 
original Prentice article) because N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a well-
established biomarker in heart failure (HF) but remains controversial as a potential surrogate marker in 
HF trials. 
The similar large reductions in NT-proBNP from baseline with sacubitril/valsartan in both paediatric and 
adult populations, in the context of its established clinical efficacy in adult HFrEF, provide a reasonable 
basis to extrapolate clinical benefits to paediatric HF patients with LVSD. 
Study B2319
Efficacy
Treatment goals in paediatric heart failure are similar to those for adult patients with HF, including 
minimizing morbidity and mortality and improving functional status and quality of life. Ideally, study 
B2319 would be a large study investigating the effects on cardiovascular mortality and HF 
hospitalization, as was done in study B2314 in adults. However, the low prevalence of HF in children 
limited the possibility of conducting large outcome trials. This is shown by study B2319, conducted at 
105 sites in 30 countries to enable the enrolment of 375 patients over a 4-year period, making it the 
largest paediatric HF study ever conducted. Nonetheless, the study was not powered to investigate the 
effects on hard clinical outcomes. Therefore, a Global Rank endpoint was used, which orders patients 
from worst to the best-using outcome, including both hard and soft clinical outcomes, ranging from 
mortality to disease progression (worsening HF) to measures of symptoms and physical functioning. 
The Global Rank primary endpoint analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between 
the treatment groups, with a Mann-Whitney probability estimate of  0.52 (95% CI 0.47,  0.58, p=0.42) 
compared to the standard of care enalapril. Therefore, the study failed to meet its primary objective, 
i.e., demonstrating the superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril. According to the Applicant, a 
non-inferiority design was not possible since no data is available in the published literature to define a

non-inferiority margin for such a study. Unfortunately, the lack of established efficacy of enalapril on 
hard outcomes in this paediatric population (literature described under clinical efficacy) makes it 
difficult to determine the true benefits (i.e., sacubitril/valsartan over placebo or no treatment) based 
on the primary analyses. Therefore, the results of the primary endpoint analyses of B2319 showing 
that sacubitril/valsartan is as least as efficacious as enalapril, with a small numerical advantage, does 
not directly translate to the efficacy with regards to this outcome. Analyses of the number of type 1 
and 2 category events also do not directly help assess the benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over a lack of 
treatment, as the background incidence of these events is not well known. 
The secondary and exploratory outcomes that compare changes from baseline within patients are more 
insightful. The beneficial effects of sacubitril/valsartan on NYHA/Ross functional class change from 
baseline, patient global impression of severity (PGIS) change from baseline, and paediatric quality of 
life change from baseline, as well as the decrease in NT-proBNP over time, are highly relevant, 
especially because paediatric heart failure is a progressive syndrome. Although none of these 
prespecified endpoints reached superiority over enalapril, it can be argued that without treatment, 
deterioration is expected with regards to NYHA/Ross class, PGIS score, quality of life, and NT-proBNP 
levels rather than improvement. These endpoints thereby support that sacubitril/valsartan treatment, 
albeit not superior to enalapril, improves disease severity, symptoms and quality of life in paediatric HF 
patients with LVSD. Furthermore, post-hoc responder analysis in which the NT-proBNP changes were 
analysed concerning the reference change value (reflecting clinically relevant change) demonstrated 
consistently higher rates of responders in the sacubitril/valsartan group compared to the enalapril 
group for each threshold. In addition to the odds ratios being all greater than 1.5, the lower limits of 
the 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios are greater than 1 for the between treatment 
responder comparison for all thresholds in adults and for the −33% and −46% thresholds in children, 
indicating a systematic difference in favour of sacubitril/valsartan in the responder rates between the 
treatment groups.
New pharmaceutical form
The lack of an age-appropriate formulation for treating paediatric HF patients has been recognized as a 
major unmet need to ensure safe and accurate dosing in paediatric patients. The new pharmaceutical 
form, film-coated granules (in capsules for opening), used within the paediatric B2319 study, provides 
an important benefit in both accuracy and convenience of dosing sacubitril/valsartan in young children 
with lower body weight or who may be unable to swallow tablets. This is especially important because 
no other age-specific pharmaceutical forms are available for the current standard of care, i.e. ACE 
inhibitors (see additional considerations for a note on other current procedures).  
Safety
Overall, the safety data from B2319 demonstrated that the safety profile of sacubitril/valsartan in 
paediatric HF patients was comparable to enalapril and consistent across all paediatric age groups. 
Further, the safety profile was generally consistent with the extensive data in adults both from clinical 
trials and post-marketing experience. No new signals or adverse drug reactions were identified in 
B2319. However, further safety evaluation and discussion is needed with respect to several subgroups 
and the potential effect of sacubitril/valsartan on hypersensitivity and hepatotoxicity. Further, it is 
likely that the AE profile from study B2319 may underestimate the true incidence of AE, given the low 
number of ACEi/ARB- naïve patients and of vulnerable patients (hypotension, hepatic and renal 
dysfunction or hyperkalaemia). Management of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment 
does require careful clinical monitoring. For the clinician, this is expected to be comparable to other 
RAAS-acting products like ACEis or ARBs.
The lack of fractures or altered growth is reassuring, even though the study duration is limited in this 
sense. The absence of angioedema also appears reassuring but may be related to the relatively small 
sample size, given that the incidence was 0,5% in adults.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The Applicant has based the totality of evidence on both a paediatric extrapolation plan using NT-
proBNP as a biomarker to bridge the results in adults from study B2314 (reduction mortality and 
morbidity over enalapril) to the paediatric population, as well as benefits found in study B2319. Based 
on the disease similarity, similar drug pharmacology, similar drug exposure-response (NT-proBNP) and 
the demonstrated validity of NT-proBNP as a bridging biomarker in this scenario (Prentice criteria), the 
extrapolation of sacubitril/valsartan efficacy from adults to the pediatric population is considered a 
reasonable approach to infer clinical efficacy in the pediatric HF population. 
Study B2319 did not demonstrate the superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril regarding the 
primary outcome. However, secondary and exploratory outcomes analyses demonstrated that both 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril led to clinically relevant improvements in NYHA/Ross functional class, 
PGIS assessment and patient-reported and parent-reported quality of life through 52 weeks. Similarly, 
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril led to a substantial decrease in NT-proBNP over time. As such, it is 
acknowledged that the aforementioned reflects a delay in the progression of the disease and 
potentially a better long-term outcome, especially given that paediatric heart failure has a progressive 
nature without treatment. 
It is also acknowledged that a new age-appropriate formulation, which has been shown to be 
equivalent to the approved FCT, offers an easier and safe dosing option in younger patients with lower 
body weight or unable to swallow tablets. Additionally, the risks of sacubitril/valsartan appear 
manageable and comparable to the adult population's risks. 
In conclusion, sacubitril/valsartan addresses the significant unmet need in the paediatric HF population 
for a registered therapy that can be administered using a new age-appropriate formulation. Taking into 
consideration the totality of the evidence, including the NT-proBNP-based extrapolation plan, the 
clinically relevant improvements from baseline in symptom and quality of life measures coupled with a 
consistent and manageable safety profile, it can be concluded that sacubitril/valsartan provides 
clinically meaningful benefits to children and adolescents with symptomatic HF due to systemic LVSD
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
Given the high mortality and morbidity associated with paediatric HF, there is a significant unmet 
medical need for approved treatments with demonstrated benefits, acceptable safety, appropriate 
posology and age-appropriate formulation in paediatric patients with HF.  
As mentioned before, there are no approved therapies in the European Union for the treatment of 
paediatric HF, and medical recommendations are mainly based on data from adult studies. Current 
medical recommendations for peadiatric heart failure with LVSD are based on off-label usage. Of these, 
ACEIs are considered the first-line treatment for paediatric HF. Although not approved for treating 
paediatric patients with HF, enalapril is the most commonly used ACEI in children with HF. The lack of 
an age-appropriate formulation for the treatment of paediatric HF patients has been recognized as a 
major unmet need to ensure safe and accurate dosing in paediatric patients. 
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Entresto is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the Novartis Europharm Limited, taking into 
account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that 
the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies 
(see appendix on Article 14(11)).
Paediatric Data
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan PIP P/0327/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning 
the following change(s):
Variations requested
Type
Annexes 
affected
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of 
Type II
I and IIIB
a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved 
one
Extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form associated with two new strengths (6 
mg/6 mg and 15 mg/16 mg granules in capsule for opening), grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) 
in order to extend the indication to include treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction in children and adolescents aged one year or older, based on the 
results from Study PANORAMA-HF (CLCZ696B2319); a multicenter, open-label, study to evaluate 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sacubitril/valsartan followed by a 52-
week randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril in paediatric patients from 1 month to < 18 years 
of age with heart failure due to systemic left ventricle systolic dysfunction. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are being updated and the Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. Further, the MAH applied for an additional year of market protection. In addition, 
an updated RMP version 4.2 has also been submitted.

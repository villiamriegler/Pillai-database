Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for thyrotropin alfa, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
Following review and characterisation of adverse event data acquired since 2011 regarding stroke, it is 
considered that the descriptive information included within section 4.8 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and section 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL) regarding this particular Adverse Drug 
Reaction (ADR), is no longer reflective of the clinical experience to date. For instance, this information 
specifies that cases have occurred in female patients. However, a number of cases (n=3, 21%) have been 
reported in male patients since the previous update in 2011. While it is acknowledged that a greater 
proportion of cases have occurred in female patients, this apparent disproportionality could be attributed to 
gender differences in the prevalence of thyroid cancer which would translate to a predominantly female 
patient population being treated with thyrotropin alfa and as such a higher reporting rate in this particular 
cohort. As specified by the MAH within the RMP for thyrotropin alfa (version 9.0), the age-standardised rate 
(ASR) of thyroid cancer is 6.1 per 100,000 females and 1.98 per 100,000 males. In addition, since the initial 
update regarding stroke in 2011, which was based on 2 serious cases, several serious cases (n=11), have 
been received, including three cases which are indicative of a causal association and two which are 
supportive. As a result, section 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to delete the information regarding stroke which 
is included within the description of selected adverse reactions. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for thyrotropin alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing thyrotropin alfa is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

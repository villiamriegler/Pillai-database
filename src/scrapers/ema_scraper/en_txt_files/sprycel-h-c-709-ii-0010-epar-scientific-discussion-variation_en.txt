SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
Introduction 
Sprycel (dasatinib) is a potent inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a 
number  of  other  selected  oncogenic  kinases  including  c-KIT,  ephrin  (EPH)  receptor  kinases,  and 
PDGFβ receptor. The Marketing Authorisation (MA) was granted in November 2006 for the treatment 
of adults with chronic, accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with resistance or 
intolerance  to  prior  therapy  including  imatinib  mesylate,  and  also  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with 
Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  and  lymphoid  blast 
CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion  for  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  in  September  2006,  the 
Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  made  a  commitment  (FUM  010)  to  provide  data  post-
authorisation  from  two  Phase  3  studies  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  dasatinib  administered 
once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) in subjects with chronic (CA180034) and advanced phase 
CML or Ph+ ALL (CA180035).  
  FUM 010:  'The proposed posology should be reassessed when results of studies CA180034 
and  CA  180035  are  available.  Final  Clinical  Study  Report  (24  months  follow-up)  by  June 
2009.’  
6  months  data  from  these  studies  have  previously  been  evaluated  as  a  part  of  variation 
EMEA/H/C/709/II/02 for which a positive CHMP opinion was adopted in July 2007, recommending 
the approval of a change in posology for chronic phase CML to 100 mg QD as starting dose, due to a 
more favourable benefit/risk ratio than the 70 mg BID originally approved. 
The MAH has now submitted a type II variation application to update sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 
5.1 of the SPC with 24-months follow-up data from the Phase III studies CA180034 and CA180035. 
The Package Leaflet has beeen amended accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to provide an updated version of the RMP (version 
6.0). Consequently, annex II has been updated to reflect the latest version agreed with the CHMP. 
Clinical aspects 
Clinical pharmacology 
No additional studies on biopharmaceutical or clinical pharmacology have been submitted as part of 
this application. 
Clinical Efficacy 
This  application  is  based  upon  two  Phase  3  studies  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  dasatinib 
administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) (current posology for the advanced phase CML 
and Ph+ ALL indications) in subjects with chronic phase CML (CA180034) and advanced phase CML 
or Ph+ ALL (CA180035). 
Studies CA180034 and CA180035 
In  the  Phase  3  study  (CA180034)  in subjects  with  chronic phase  CML,  dasatinib  was  administered 
QD  or  BID  at  a  total  daily  dose  (TDD)  of  100  mg  or  140  mg.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the 
comparison  of  MCyR  rates  after  a  minimum  follow-up  of  6  months  of  dasatinib  treatment  when 
administered  QD  relative  to  BID  in  imatinib-resistant  subjects.  Secondary  endpoints  included: 
comparison  of  MCyR  rates  between  the  2  TDDs  of  dasatinib;  durability  and  time  to  MCyR;  rate, 
duration,  time  to  CHR;  and  major  molecular  response  (MMR).  Six  hundred  seventy  subjects  were 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomized (497 imatinib-resistant, according to the assessment on the baseline case report form, and 
173 imatinib-intolerant) to receive dasatinib at either 100 mg or 140 mg TDD. 
In the Phase 3 study (CA180035) in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, dasatinib was 
administered  either  QD  or  BID  at  a  TDD  of  140  mg.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  comparison  of 
MaHR rates in all randomized subjects treated with dasatinib at 140 mg QD or 70 mg BID. Secondary 
endpoints included durability and time to MaHR and rate of MCyR. Six hundred eleven subjects with 
accelerated  phase,  myeloid  blast  phase,  or  lymphoid  blast  phase  CML  or  with  Ph+  ALL  were 
randomized to receive dasatinib at either 140 mg QD or 70 mg BID. 
In both studies, investigators were allowed to escalate subjects’ doses to achieve better efficacy or to 
reduce  subjects’  doses  to  manage  adverse  events.  Efficacy  responses  were  determined  from 
haematologic  values,  bone  marrow  cytology  and  cytogenetics,  and  in  the  presence  or  absence  of 
extramedullary  disease.  All  data  presented  represent  data  collected  from  any  subject  who  was 
randomized.  Response  rates  were  estimated  along  with  their  95%  exact  CIs  based  on  the  Clopper-
Pearson  method.  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  median  duration  of  response  were  provided  along  with 
their 95% CIs. Duration on treatment is calculated as the time from the first dose to the last dose of 
study drug; medians are presented for both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects treated 
in the studies. In addition, duration of response is presented for both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-
intolerant subjects. 
MMR in subjects with chronic phase CML was assessed by RQ-PCR determined as the ratio of BCR-
ABL copies to a control gene. These ratios were expressed using a standardized methodology initially 
described in the International Randomized Study of Interferon and STI-571 (IRIS) trial and currently 
reported  by  an  international  panel  of  experts.  Data  are  reported  on  the  international  scale  after 
determining a laboratory specific conversion factor. Molecular data for the Phase 3 study (CA180034) 
were  measured internally at a BMS facility using validated methodology. Results are reported in all 
treated  subjects  and  in  subjects  who  achieved  a  CCyR.  Subjects  assessed  for  MMR  may  have  been 
tested at any time during the treatment period. 
Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  from  randomization  until  the  time  disease 
progression  was  first  documented  by  the  investigator  or  death.  Subjects  who  neither  progressed  nor 
died were censored on the date of their last cytogenetic or haematologic assessment. 
RESULTS STUDY CA180034 
The median duration of exposure in CA180034 was 22 months.  
Efficacy  was  achieved  across  all  treatment  groups  with  the  QD  schedule  demonstrating  comparable 
efficacy (non-inferiority) to the BID schedule on the primary efficacy endpoint (difference in MCyR 
1.9%;  95%  confidence  interval  [-6.8%–10.6%]).  Over  half  of  the  subjects  with  chronic  phase  CML 
who achieved MCyR did so within the first 6 months with most subjects achieving MCyR by 1 year. 
MMR in all treated subjects was reported in 33% to 35% of the subjects. MMR in assessed subjects 
with  CCyR  was  reported  in  66%  to  72%  of  the  subjects.  Rates  of  projected  duration  of  MCyR  and 
CCyR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected  overall  survival  showed  little  difference  across  dose  and 
schedule. Similar findings were reported for subjects who were intolerant of or resistant to imatinib. 
(Please refer to Table 4.3.1.2 below)

In imatinib-intolerant subjects who received 100 mg QD, MCyR was achieved in 77%, CCyR in 67%, 
and  MMR  (in  assessed  subjects  with  CCyR)  in  64%.  Based  on  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates,  all 
subjects (100%) maintained MCyR for 1 year and 92% (95% CI: [80%–100%]) maintained MCyR for 
18 months. The estimated rate of PFS in this population was 97% (95% CI: [92%–100%]) at 1 year 
and 87% (95% CI: [76%–99%]) at 2 years. The estimated rate of overall survival was 100% at 1 year 
and 95% (95% CI: [88%–100%]) at 2 years. 
RESULTS STUDY CA180035 
With 2 years of follow-up in subjects with advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL in the Phase 3 study 
(CA180035),  haematologic  and  cytogenetic  responses  were  achieved  in  subjects  treated  with 
dasatinib.  Data  from  CA180035  establishing  the  optimal  dosing  schedule  showed  similar  efficacy 
between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules. With both schedules, long-term responses were 
identified in advanced phases of disease.

Accelerated Phase CML: 
With  2  years  of  follow-up,  most  subjects  with  accelerated  phase  CML  achieved  haematologic 
responses.  Efficacy  results  were  similar  between  the  140  mg  QD  and  70  mg  BID.  Cytogenetic 
response rates in CA180035 were lower than haematologic responses (see Table 4.3.3.2 below). Most 
subjects  who  achieved  MaHR  did  so  within  the  first  6  months  of  treatment.10  Rates  of  projected 
duration  of  MaHR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected  overall  survival  were  high  and  showed  little 
difference between the 2 schedules. 
Myeloid Blast Phase CML: 
Efficacy  results  with  2  years  of  follow-up  were  similar  between  the  140  mg  QD  and  70  mg  BID 
schedules.  In  CA180035,  approximately  one-third  of  the  subjects  achieved  haematologic  and 
cytogenetic  responses  (see  Table  4.3.3.2  below).  In  subjects  with  MaHR,  the  time  to  response  was 
rapid and within the first 4 months of treatment. Rates of projected duration of MaHR, projected PFS, 
and projected overall survival showed little difference across the 2 schedules. 
Lymphoid Blast Phase CML: 
There was little difference in efficacy between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules in subjects 
with lymphoid blast phase CML after 2 years of follow-up. In CA180035, more subjects achieved a 
MCyR compared with MaHR (Table 4.3.3.2). Most subjects who achieved MaHR did so  within the 
first  2  months  of  treatment.10  Rates  of  projected  duration  of  MaHR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected 
overall  survival  were  lower  compared  with  other  advanced  phases  of  CML  reflecting  the  more 
aggressive nature of this disease phase. 
Ph+ ALL: 
In subjects with Ph+ ALL with 2 years of follow-up, rates of MaHR were similar between the 140 mg 
QD and 70 mg BID schedules. In CA180035, cytogenetic responses were greater than haematologic 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responses  (see  Table  4.3.3.3  below).  Most  subjects  who  achieved  MaHR  did  so  within  the  first  2 
months  of  treatment.  Rates  of  projected  duration  of  MaHR,  projected  PFS,  and  projected  overall 
survival  were  lower  compared  with  other  advanced  phases  of  CML  reflecting  the  more  aggressive 
nature of this disease phase 
Dose modifications 
Study CA180035 included 609 patients. Among the 304 patients who were randomized to the 140 mg 
QD starting dose of dasatinib, 110 (36%) were dose escalated (Table 1). Of the 110 subjects who dose 
escalated, 106 (96%) escalated to 180 mg, 3 to 200 mg, and 1 to 280 mg. Escalation higher than 180 
mg QD was primarily due to dosing error or rising % blasts.

35 (11.5)       
Of the 110 subjects who dose escalated to  180 mg QD due to either no response or partial response 
at  the  recommended  starting  dose,  haematologic  responses  were  reported  in  10  subjects.  Of  the  10 
subjects with haematologic response after dose escalation, 4 achieved a major haematologic response 
(MaHR). Cytogenetic responses were reported in 18 subjects who dose escalated due to no response or 
partial response at the recommended starting dose. An additional 7 subjects who had a loss of MCyR 
regained  MCyR  after  dose  escalation.  Of  these  25  subjects  with  a  cytogenetic  response  after  dose 
escalation, 17 achieved MCyR. Overall, with 3 of the 4 subjects with a MaHR also achieving a MCyR, 
a  total  of  18 (16%)  out  of  110  subjects  benefited  from  dose  escalation    180  mg  QD.  Changes  in 
response following dose escalation are presented in Table 2.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The current dosing recommendation is 70 mg BID in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL 
based on three Phase 2 studies and one Phase 3 previously reported with 6 months of follow-up. With 
long-term follow-up in the dose optimization study (CA180035), efficacy data were similar between 
the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules, and comparable with responses reported at 6 months with 
70  mg  BID.  With  both  schedules,  long-lasting  responses  were  identified.  In  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL 
with longer follow-up, haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were also similar between 140 mg 
QD and 70 mg BID schedules. The dose of 140 mg QD supports an overall superior benefit risk and 
should be recommended in this population. 
Dose-escalation to 180 mg QD in subjects with no response or partial response at the recommended 
starting dose is considered justified based on dose modification guidelines utilized in Study CA180035 
that resulted in response improvement without additional safety concerns.  
Protocol CA180035 allowed dose escalation from 140 mg to 180 mg total daily dose for the advanced 
phase CML and Ph+ ALL patients for the following reasons: 
  Rising % blasts on 2 consecutive haematologic assessments at least one week apart (i.e., from 
Day 15); 
  No  complete  haematologic  response  (CHR),  no  evidence  of  leukaemia  (NEL),  or  minor 
haematologic response (MiHR) within 4 weeks;  
  No major cytogenetic response (MCyR) after 3 months;  
  No complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) after 6 months;  
  Loss of haematologic response on 2 consecutive assessments at least 1 week apart. 
Clinical Safety 
As  part  of  this  submission  safety  data  are  presented  for  the  safety  cohort  (all  treated  subjects  who 
received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug).  The  safety  prognosis  for  subjects  resistant  and  intolerant  to 
imatinib  was  expected  to  be  similar;  therefore,  all  of  the  safety  analyses  combined  these  2  groups 
except for subgroup analyses by imatinib status. 
Safety data are presented separately for subjects with chronic phase CML and advanced phase CML or 
Ph+ ALL. In subjects with chronic phase CML, data are displayed by 100 mg QD, 70 mg BID, other 
doses, and all doses. In advanced phase CML and in Ph+ ALL, data are presented for 140 mg QD, 70 
mg BID, and total.

Exposure 
Dasatinib-treated  subjects  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  were  followed  for  2  years.  In  CA180034,  the 
median  duration  of  study  therapy  was  similar  across  the  4  treatment  schedules  (22  months  for  each 
schedule).    In  CA180035,  the  median  duration  of  study  therapy  was  similar  between  the  QD  (6.1 
months; range 0.03 - 31.2 months) and BID (6.2 months; range 0.03 - 28.8 months) groups. Likewise, 
there  was  little  difference  between  the  groups  in  median  duration  when  excluding  interruptions  (5.7 
months and 5.2 months, respectively). The median duration of exposure in the overall population of 
2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL was 15.01 months; 55% of the subjects were 
administered dasatinib for more than 12 months.  
Common Drug-related adverse events 
In Study CA180034 with 2 years of follow-up, the majority of treated subjects (645 [97%]) reported at 
least 1 AE, regardless of relationship to study drug. 9 Drug-related AEs were reported in 603 (91%) 
subjects. Drug-related AEs occurred less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (86%) compared with the 
other 3 treatment groups (range 92% to 94%). Similarly, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs also occurred 
less frequently in the 100 mg QD group (36%) compared with the 140 mg QD, 50 mg BID, and 70 mg 
BID groups (range 42% to 53%). Common drug-related non-haematologic AEs (occurring ≥ 20% in at 
least 1 treatment group) were headache (23% to 32%), diarrhoea (26% to 31%), nausea (18% to 29%), 
fatigue (19% to 25%), dyspnoea (16% to 23%), and pleural effusion (14% to 25%).  
In  CA180035,  most  subjects  in  both  the  QD  group  and  the  BID  group  reported  at  least  1  AE,  any 
grade, while on study drug (98% vs. 99%).10 Drug-related AEs (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects), were 
reported  in  the  majority  of  subjects  (90%  in  QD  and  89%  in  BID).  Drug-related  AEs  were  similar 
between the QD and BID groups with 2 exceptions: pleural effusion (20% vs. 32%, respectively) and 
peripheral oedema (9% vs. 15%, respectively). 
Of the overall population of 2,182 dasatinib-treated subjects, 1,864 (85%) experienced at least 1 drug-
related AE over the course of the study. ADRs of clinical relevance included diarrhoea (33%), pleural 
effusion (27%), headache (25%), haemorrhage (16%), and infection (11%). 
Two  tables  of  selected  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  reported  in  these  Phase  3  dose-optimization 
studies have been updated in the proposed SPC. Uncommon and rare adverse drug reactions are also 
discussed and updated in the proposed SPC section 4.8. 
Drug-related Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation 
In  CA180034,  101  (15%)  subjects  reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  any  grade,  during  the 
study or up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication.  Eighty-three (13%) subjects reported 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation. Fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group (8%) reported 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, any grade, compared with the 140 mg QD, 50 mg BID, 
and 70 mg BID groups (12% to 15%, respectively). The most common (≥ 2% incidence in at least 1 
treatment  group)  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  pleural  effusion,  dyspnoea,  and 
headache. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, for all grades and for Grade 3 to 5, were less 
frequent in the 100 mg QD group vs. the other 3 treatment groups. This difference was largely due to 
fewer subjects with pleural effusion leading to discontinuation in the 100 mg QD group. 
In  CA180035,  192  (32%)  subjects  reported  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  any  grade,  during  the 
study  or  up  to  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  Drug-related  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  similar  between  the  QD  and  BID  groups  (14%  and  16%, 
respectively) with the exception of drug-related pleural effusion (2% vs. 5%, respectively). The most 
common  (≥  2%  incidence  in  at  least  1  treatment  group)  drug-related  AE  leading  to  discontinuation 
was pleural effusion.

Serious Adverse Events 
In CA180034, 276 (42%) subjects reported SAEs, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after 
the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  One  hundred  seventy-four  (26%)  subjects  reported  drug-related 
SAEs. Fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group (19%) reported drug-related SAEs vs. the 140 mg QD, 
50  mg  BID,  and  70  mg  BID  groups  (25%  to  33%).  In  particular,  pleural  effusion,  gastrointestinal 
disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and cardiac disorders were less frequent in the 100 
mg QD group than in the other 3 treatment groups. Similarly, severe (Grade 3 to 5) drug-related SAEs 
were less frequent in the 100 mg QD group (13%) than in the other 3 treatment groups (16% to 25%). 
The  most  common  (>  3%  incidence  in  at  least  1  treatment  group)  severe  drug-related  SAEs  were 
pleural effusion, dyspnoea, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. 
In CA180035, 448 (74%) subjects reported SAEs, any grade, during the study or up to 30 days after 
the last dose of study medication. Two hundred seventy (44%) subjects reported drug-related SAEs. 
There was little difference (43% vs. 46%, respectively) in drug-related SAEs between the QD and BID 
groups.  Notable  common  (>3%  incidence  in  at  least  1  treatment  group)  drug-related  SAEs  were 
pleural effusion, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, cerebral haemorrhage, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anaemia. 
Deaths 
In CA180034, 65 deaths were reported of which 26 were due to disease progression. Two of the 65 
deaths  were  due  to  study  drug  toxicity  (1  pulmonary  oedema/CHF/neck  pain/pleural  effusion,  1 
necrosis  of  the  colon).  Both  deaths  occurred  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose  of  dasatinib.  Of  the  65 
deaths, 16 occurred on-study or within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib. Of these 16, deaths were 
less frequent in the QD group compared with the BID group (5 vs. 11 subjects, respectively). 
In CA180035, 321 out of 609 subjects died of which over half were due to disease progression. Of the 
321  deaths,  126  subjects  died  on-study  or  within  30  days  of  last  dose  of  study  therapy.  For  those 
deaths within 30 days of last dose of study therapy, a difference between the QD and BID groups was 
observed  in  infection  (17%  vs.  30%,  respectively)  and  cardiovascular  disease  (3%  vs.  11%, 
respectively). 
Laboratory Abnormalities 
In this heavily pretreated population of subjects, treatment with dasatinib was associated with severe 
(Grade  3  or  4)  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  anaemia.  There  were  few  clinically  meaningful 
non-haematologic changes in laboratory parameters reported on treatment with dasatinib with 2 years 
of  follow-up,  a  result  consistent  with  the  initial  filing.  In  CA180034  and  CA180035,  there  were 
minimal differences between the treatment groups in the number of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 liver 
function  and  renal  function  abnormalities.  In  addition,  electrolytes  changes  and  coagulation 
parameters were similar between the groups in the two Phase 3 studies. There were few instances of 
Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  values;  the  most  common  laboratory  abnormality  was  Grade  3  or  4 
hypophosphataemia. 
An updated section of laboratory test abnormalities is provided in Section 4.8 of the proposed SPC. 
Selected Safety Events 
Safety  issues  of  special  importance  in  the  dasatinib  product  information  included  the  AEs  of 
myelosuppression, fluid retention, bleeding-related events, and QT prolongation. 
Haematology 
With 2 years of follow-up, the occurrence of severe leukopaenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
anaemia were more frequent in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CML. In subjects who reported severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief 
(2 to 4 weeks) dose interruptions or reductions. 
In  CA180034,  cytopenia  was  reported  less  frequently  in  the  100  mg  QD  group  than  in  the  other  3 
treatment  groups.  More  subjects  in  the  100  mg  QD  and  70  mg  BID  groups  (55%  and  54%, 
respectively) than in the 140 mg QD and 50 mg BID groups (40% and 36%, respectively) had their 
first  occurrences  of  leukocytopenia  after  8  weeks  of  treatment.  In  CA180035,  more  subjects  in  the 
BID group reported neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared with the QD group. There was little 
difference  between  the  QD  and  BID  groups  in  the  time  to  first  occurrence  of  Grade  3  to  4  WBC, 
platelet, and ANC. 
Fluid Retention 
Dasatinib is associated with fluid retention. Fluid retention events were systematically identified in the 
dasatinib programme. Other events related to fluid retention were also examined including: 1) pleural 
effusion,  2)  ascites,  3)  pulmonary  oedema,  4)  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  5)  pulmonary 
hypertension, and 6) pericardial effusion.  
In CA180034, fluid retention, any grade, was reported in 264 (40%) subjects. Of these 264 subjects, 
drug-related  fluid  retention  occurred  in  238  (36%)  subjects.  Pleural  effusion,  any  grade  and  any 
relationship, was reported in 147 (22%) subjects. Few subjects reported severe (Grade 3 to 5) pleural 
effusions. The majority of cases of pleural effusion were drug-related (96%; 141/147). Fewer subjects 
in the 100 mg QD group reported pleural effusion (all grades) compared with the 140 mg QD, 50 mg 
BID,  and  70  mg  BID  groups  (14%  vs.  25%,  23%,  and  23%,  respectively).  The  number  of  subjects 
with  drug-related  fluid-related  events  (including  generalized  oedema,  pulmonary  oedema, 
CHF/cardiac  dysfunction,  and  pericardial  effusion)  was  generally  lower  in  the  100  mg  QD  group 
compared with the other 3 treatment groups. 
In CA180035, fluid retention, any grade, was reported in 281 (46%) subjects. Of these 281 subjects, 
drug-related  fluid  retention  occurred  in  227  (37%)  subjects.  Pleural  effusion,  any  grade  and  any 
relationship, was reported in 181 (30%) subjects. Few subjects reported severe (Grade 3 to 5) pleural 
effusions. The majority of cases of pleural effusion were drug-related (88%; 159/181) (Table 5.5.2B). 
Fewer subjects in the QD group reported drug-related pleural effusion compared with the BID group 
(20% vs. 32%, respectively). The number of subjects with drug-related fluid-related events (including 
generalized  oedema,  pulmonary  oedema,  CHF/cardiac  dysfunction,  and  pericardial  effusion)  was 
lower in the QD group compared with BID group. 
Bleeding-related Events 
In  CA180034,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  any  grade,  was  reported  in  40  subjects.  Drug-related 
gastrointestinal  bleeding  occurred  in  21  subjects.  There  was  little  difference  in  the  rate  of 
gastrointestinal bleeding between the 4 treatment groups.  
In CA180035, drug-related gastrointestinal bleeding, any grade, was reported in 63 subjects. 10 Fewer 
subjects  in  the  QD  group  (N  =  25)  compared  with  the  BID  group  (N  =  38)  reported  drug-related 
gastrointestinal bleeding. 
QT Prolongation 
A comprehensive evaluation of data from Phase 2 studies (N = 865) examined the possible effect of 
dasatinib  on  ECG  parameters,  particularly  the  QTc  interval.  The  mean  QTc  interval  changes  from 
baseline using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) were 4 to 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence intervals for 
all mean changes from baseline were < 7 msec. A total of 5 subjects (< 1%) reported a QTcF > 500 
msec; 1 of these 5 subjects reported a QTcF > 500 msec on both Days 1 and 8. No events of torsade de 
pointes were reported. 
Nine  of  the  1150  subjects  with  chronic  phase  CML  had  QTc  prolongation  reported  as  an  adverse 
event. Of these 9 subjects, 7 were considered related to drug. None of the 9 subjects who reported QTc 
prolongation were from the 100 mg QD group compared with 8 subjects from the 70 mg BID group. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ten of the 1032 subjects with advanced disease had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse event. 
Of  these  10  subjects,  7  were  considered  drug-related.  All  10  of  the  subjects  who  reported  QTc 
prolongation were from the 70 mg BID group. 
Overall,  of  the  2182  subjects  treated  with  dasatinib  in  clinical  trials,  21  (1%)  subjects  across  the 
studies  reported  a  QTcF  >  500  msec,  and  14  (<1%)  had  QTc  prolongation  reported  as  an  adverse 
reaction. These data have been updated in the proposed SPC, accordingly (Sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Dose modifications 
Analysis of safety showed no meaningful differences in subjects (advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL) 
with  dose  escalation  ( 180  mg  QD)  compared  with  those  without  dose  escalation  (  140  mg  QD) 
except for pleural effusion, which showed fewer events in subjects with dose escalation (Table 3).

Discussion on Clinical Safety 
Safety results after 2 years of follow-up were consistent with the safety profile reported with shorter 
follow-up. In chronic phase CML, fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group reported drug-related non-
haematologic toxicities, all grades, than subjects in the 70 mg BID. AEs of special interest including 
fluid retention, haemorrhage, and some cardiac disorders were reported in fewer subjects in the 100 
mg QD group compared with the 70 mg BID group. Similarly, in subjects with advanced phase CML 
or  Ph+  ALL,  the  QD  schedule  of  administration  was  also  associated  with  fewer  drug-related  non-
haematologic toxicities (including AEs of special interest). Myelosuppression usually occurred early, 
especially in advanced stages of CML. Incidence and severity did not change over time. 
Updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 6.0 
The purpose of the RMP update is to provide 2-year post-approval safety data from the two studies for 
which results are discussed above. Changes to the RMP are summarized in the following table.

are acceptable.  
CHMP’s comment: 
The changes to the Product Information are supported by the data submitted and provide further useful 
information to the treating physicians. 
Benefit /Risk assessment 
This  type  II  variation  concerns  an  update  of  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  4.9  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  with  24-
months  follow-up  data  from  two  Phase  3  studies  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  dasatinib 
administered once daily (QD) versus twice daily (BID) (current posology for the advanced phase CML 
and Ph+ ALL indications) in subjects with chronic phase CML (CA180034) and advanced phase CML 
or Ph+ ALL (CA180035). 
The current dosing recommendation is 70 mg BID in subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL 
based on three Phase 2 studies and one Phase 3 previously reported with 6 months of follow-up. With 
long-term follow-up in the dose optimization study (CA180035), efficacy data were similar between 
the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID schedules, and comparable with responses reported at 6 months with 
70  mg  BID.  With  both  schedules,  long-lasting  responses  were  identified.  In  subjects  with  Ph+  ALL 
with longer follow-up, haematologic and cytogenetic response rates were also similar between 140 mg 
QD and 70 mg BID schedules. The dose of 140 mg QD supports an overall superior benefit risk and 
should be recommended in this population of advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL. 
Safety results after 2 years of follow-up were consistent with the safety profile reported with shorter 
follow-up. In chronic phase CML, fewer subjects in the 100 mg QD group reported drug-related non-
haematologic toxicities, all grades, than subjects in the 70 mg BID. AEs of special interest including 
fluid retention, haemorrhage, and some cardiac disorders were reported in fewer subjects in the 100 
mg QD group compared with the 70 mg BID group. Similarly, in subjects with advanced phase CML 
or  Ph+  ALL,  the  QD  schedule  of  administration  was  also  associated  with  fewer  drug-related  non-
haematologic toxicities (including AEs of special interest). Myelosuppression usually occurred early, 
especially in advanced stages of CML. Incidence and severity did not change over time. 
Overall,  data  presented  in  the  dossier  confirm  the  selection  of  140  mg  QD  as  the  recommended 
starting  dose in  subjects  with  advanced CML  and  Ph+  ALL.  The proposed  revised  SPC  Section 4.2 
also includes a revised dose modification guideline:  
-  For Dose escalation: in patients who did not achieve a haematologic or cytogenetic response at the 
recommended starting dosage; 
-  For  Dose  adjustments  for  undesirable  effects:  with  guidance  including  interruption,  reduction,  and 
escalation. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the analyses provided the CHMP considers the dose escalation recommendation justified, as 
there is a subgroup of patients who derive efficacy benefit with the dose escalation to 180 mg QD. In 
addition, few differences in the safety profile were reported in subjects with dose escalation thereby 
demonstrating  that  the  benefit  in  response  received  with  dose  escalation  is  not  compromised  by 
additional safety risks.   
The CHMP consider the proposed changes to the SPC and the Package Leaflet acceptable. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to provide an updated version of the RMP (version 6.0). The revisions 
introduced in the RMP are relevant and fully adequate. Consequently, annex II has been updated to 
reflect the latest version agreed with the CHMP. 
CONCLUSION 
On 22 January 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Indication sought:  
Mosunetuzumab  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or 
refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.   
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
FL is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and the second most common lymphoma 
diagnosed in the United States and Europe, accounting for approximately 10-20% of all NHL cases 
(Mounier et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2015; SEER Cancer Statistics 2020). Population-based studies 
reported the annual age-standardized incidence of FL (new cases per 100,000 population) as 2.1 in 
France (2012; Le Guyader-Peyrou et al. 2016), 2.8 in the UK (2004-2012; Smith et al. 2015), 2.7 in 
the US (2014-2018; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] Cancer Statistics), 3.8 in 
Canada (1992-2010; Le et al. 2019), and 3.1 in Australia (1997-2006; van Leeuwen et al. 2014). The 
estimated total prevalence of FL in the EU27 is likely to lie between 3.2-3.8 per 10,000 population 
(EMA/OD/0000058552), based on estimates extracted from several EU countries’ population-based 
cancer registries. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
As in the majority of other mature B-cell lymphomas, FL is characterized by the expression of a surface 
membrane  antigen,  CD20.  CD20  is  an  attractive  target  for  anti-lymphoma  therapies,  being  B-cell-
specific, highly and stably expressed, exhibiting a low rate of internalization, and not being present on 
hematopoietic stem cells.  The concept of targeting CD20 as an effective anti-lymphoma strategy has 
been validated by clinical data for the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, which has revolutionized 
the treatment of FL. The utility of CD20 as a therapeutic target has led to the continued development of 
improved  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibodies,  such  as  obinutuzumab,  which  was  designed  to  overcome 
several  postulated  mechanisms  of  resistance  to  rituximab  by  binding  CD20-antigen  in  a  different 
orientation and through enhanced fragment crystallizable (Fc)-dependent immune effector mechanisms 
(Freeman and Sehn 2018). The efficacy of obinutuzumab in patients who have relapsed or are refractory 
to rituximab-based regimens as demonstrated in the GADOLIN study (Sehn et al 2016, Cheson et al. 
2018) is supportive of the continued development of more effective therapies targeting CD20. 
The current WHO edition defines FL in accordance to the number of centroblastic cells as Grade 1, 
Grade 2, Grade 3A and Grade 3B. The distinction between Grade 3A and 3B is important due to their 
apparent differences in molecular genetics and prognosis; it is suggested that Grade 3A FL is on the 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 10/11 
 
  
 
 
 
same spectrum as Grade 1-2 FL, and Grade 3B FL (no centrocytes, centroblasts only) behaves as de 
novo DLBCL (Katzenberger et al., Am J Pathol 2004; Karube et al., Blood 2007). 
2.1.4.   Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Follicular lymphoma remains an incurable disease with currently available therapies. Beyond the front-
line setting, prognosis is influenced by several factors, including number of prior regimens, refractory 
status, and progressive decline of bone marrow reserve (Smith 2013). In patients who progress from 
front-line  therapies,  the  disease-free  intervals  and  DOR  become  progressively  shorter  with  increased 
refractoriness with each subsequent progression/relapse (Link et al. 2019; Rivas-Delgado et al. 2019). 
Nevertheless, for patients receiving a second course of rituximab-containing chemotherapy at the time 
of first relapse, achieving a CR or receiving autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the 
second-line  setting  has  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  improved  PFS  (time  to  second  disease 
progression) (Liu et al. 2020).  
Patients  with  R/R  FL  after  ≥2  prior  lines  of  therapy  are  a  particularly  poor  prognostic  group.  These 
patients  have  usually  received  anti-CD20  and  chemotherapeutic  regimens,  and  PFS  and  OS  shortens 
with each subsequent relapse and line of therapy, with most deaths due to progressive lymphoma or 
complications of treatment. For patients who received ≥2 prior therapies, median PFS ranges from 1-
1.1  years  for  third-line  patients  decreasing  to  0.5  years  for  sixth-line  patients  with  a  corresponding 
median OS of 4.8-8.8 years and 1.9 years, respectively (Alperovich et al. 2016; Rivas-Delgado et al. 
2019; Batlevi et al. 2020). A real-world analysis of patients with R/R FL receiving systemic therapy after 
≥2 prior therapies (including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylator, 94% of whom had exactly 2 prior 
therapies)  across  eight  academic  centers  in  the  United  States  participating  in  the  LEO  Cohort  Study 
(NCT02736357; https://leocohort.org/) showed a median PFS of approximately 1.4 years. Heterogeneity 
of third-line therapies observed in this real-world analysis reflects the absence of an outstanding standard 
of  care  for  patients  with  R/R  FL  ≥2  prior  therapies,  with  median  PFS  under  2  years  for  all  third-line 
therapies, and response rate varying by type of third-line therapy (Casulo et al. 2022). 
FL can also undergo histologic transformation to high-grade NHL that is clinically more aggressive and 
has a poor outcome, at a rate of approximately 2-3% of patients with FL per year (Link et al. 2013). 
Taken together, there is an unmet need for patients with R/R FL who have received ≥2 prior therapies, 
particularly for patients who are R/R to different classes of agents and are left with limited treatment 
options that may have challenging safety profiles. New treatment options that will significantly extend 
duration of remission and that can overcome resistance to existing therapies, while providing 
acceptable safety and tolerability are needed. 
2.1.5.   Management 
For patients with FL who relapse after or are refractory to initial therapy, treatment decisions take into 
consideration  efficacy  and  DOR  of  prior  therapy,  stage  of  disease  and  tumor  burden  at  relapse,  the 
presence  of  symptoms,  and  the  age  and  comorbidities  of  the  patient.  As  with  patients  with  newly 
diagnosed  FL,  observation  (watch-and-wait)  is  an  accepted  approach  (e.g.,  in  asymptomatic  patients 
with low tumor burden and confirmed follicular histology) and may be of benefit to patients with disease 
relapse or progression after first-line treatment. 
For patients who require second-line therapy, there is no treatment considered standard of care, and 
options vary widely.

Recently,  therapies  which utilize  T-cells  have  been  developed  to  treat  B-cell  malignancies.  Two  T-cell 
directed approaches that have led to approved treatments are CAR-T cells that target lineage-specific 
surface molecule CD19 (e.g., axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel), and bispecific molecules that 
directly engage endogenous T-cells with tumor cells via binding to specific surface antigens on both cell 
types (e.g., blinatumomab).

2.2.   About the product 
Mosunetuzumab  is  a  CHO-produced  humanised  full-length  anti-CD20/CD3  T-cell-engaging  bispecific 
antibody  of  isotype  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).  
Mosunetuzumab is a conditional agonist, and the target B-cell lymphoma killing is expected to occur only 
when mosunetuzumab binds simultaneously to CD20 on B cells and CD3ε on T cells. Engagement of both 
arms  of  mosunetuzumab  results  in  polyclonal  T-cell  activation  through  stimulation  of  T-cell  receptor 
signaling, which results in formation of an immunologic synapse between a target B cell and a cytotoxic 
T cell. Subsequent T-cell activation and directed release of perforin and a cocktail of granzymes from T 
cells  to  B  cells  through  the  immunologic  synapsis  result  in  B-cell  lysis.  Mosunetuzumab  contains  the 
N297G amino acid substitution in the Fc region, which results in a non-glycosylated heavy chain. It is 
therefore  expected  that  minimal  binding  to  Fc  receptors  will  occur  and,  consequently,  significantly 
reduced Fc-mediated effector function. 
The  current  MAA  is  based  on  study  GO29781,  an  open-label,  multicenter,  Phase  I/Ib  (Phase  I/II  per 
protocol  v12)  trial  evaluating  the  safety,  efficacy,  and  PK  of  escalating  doses  of  mosunetuzumab 
(BTCT4465A) as a single agent and combined with atezolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Interim CSR GO29781 reports 
all data in patients receiving IV monotherapy in both Group A and Group B (dose escalation and dose 
expansion stages) up to the clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 15 March 2021.

The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was   
considered to be of major public health interest. The request for an accelerated assessment has been 
duly substantiated.  Mosunetuzumab has the potential to address a high unmet need and will most 
likely impact medical practice. Also, mosunetuzumab provides a novel MoA, has a potential therapeutic 
advantage compared to available treatments, provides clinically meaningful ORR, CR and DOR, while 
having a clinically manageable safety profile. All this is highly welcomed in a patient population that 
needs new therapies with improved efficacy and safety. 
Based on the assessment of the request provided by the applicant and the CHMP guideline on the 
procedure for accelerated assessment pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) no 726/2004, the 
CHMP recommended to grant the accelerated assessment procedure pursuant to Article 14 (9) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Lunsumio. 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
● 
● 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. Comprehensive data is 
expected from the recently commenced phase 3 study in FL patients after at least one prior 
treatment where mosunetuzumab in combination with lenalidomide is evaluated against rituximab 
+ lenalidomide.   
● 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as mosunetuzumab provides a novel MoA, has a potential 
therapeutic advantage compared to available treatments, provides clinically meaningful ORR, CR 
and DOR, while having a clinically manageable safety profile. 
EMA/390815/2022

● 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Mosunetuzumab has the potential to address a high unmet 
need and will most likely impact medical practice and is thus considered of major interest from 
the point of view of public health.  
2.4.   Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The active substance contained in Lunsumio is mosunetuzumab, a humanised full-length anti-CD20/CD3 
T-cell-dependent bispecific IgG1 monoclonal antibody. One fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region of the 
antibody  is  directed  against  the  extracellular  domain  of  the  CD3  subunit  of  the  T-cell  receptor  (TCR) 
complex and the other Fab region is directed against the extracellular domain of CD20. The mechanism 
of action of mosunetuzumab involves recruitment of effector T-cells via CD3 to engage with target CD20-
expressing  B  cells,  leading  to  T-cell  activation  (independent  of  TCR  epitope  specificity)  and  T-cell 
mediated B cell cytolysis. 
Lunsumio  is  presented  as  a  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  (pH  5.8)  in  single  use  vial  where 
mosunetuzumab is formulated with the following commonly used excipients: L-histidine, L-methionine, 
acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. Two strengths are proposed: 1 mg (each 
vial contains 1 mg of mosunetuzumab in 1 mL) and 30 mg (each vial contains 30 mg of mosunetuzumab 
in 30 mL). 
2.4.2.   Active Substance 
2.4.2.1. General Information 
Mosunetuzumab  (approximately  146  kDa)  is  produced  in  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells  by 
recombinant DNA technology.  
2.4.2.2. Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Mosunetuzumab active substance is manufactured at Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way South San Francisco 
(SSF), CA 94080, USA. Sufficient proof of GMP compliance has been provided for all sites involved in the 
manufacturing and controls. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Mosunetuzumab is produced using CHO cell lines. Cell culture process involves three stages: seed train, 
inoculum  train,  and  production  culture.  The  purification  process  consists  of  multiple  steps,  such  as 
harvest, chromatography, filtration, and removal and inactivation of potential viral contaminants. The 
active substance is filtered into appropriate containers. 
The  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  and  associated  limits  are  acceptable.  The  manufacturing  process  is 
sufficiently described.  
The proposed reprocessing options are acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Cell banks 
The protocol used for the generation of master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) have been 
adequately described in the dossier. WCB cells are used to initiate the production process. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 14/15 
 
  
 
 
The  master  and  working  cell  banks  were  tested  for  microbial  and  viral  purity,  host  cell  identity  and 
identity of the expressed protein. End-of-production cells (EPC) were tested for host cell line identity and 
viral purity.  
Cells at limit of in vitro age (LIVCA) were tested for bacterial and viral contamination, and for genetic 
consistency.  Overall,  the  generation  and  characterisation  of  the  MCB,  WCB,  EPC  and  cells  at  LIVCA 
comply  with  the  requirements  set  in  the  ICH  Q5D  guideline.  In  addition  to  genetic  characterisation, 
phenotypic consistency was demonstrated during process validation.  
Raw materials 
The information provided on raw materials is overall sufficient.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The mosunetuzumab active substance manufacturing process was developed with defined operational 
procedures, CPPs, and in-process limits to ensure control of critical steps. A process parameter is critical 
if varying the process parameter across its acceptable range impacts at least one critical quality attribute 
(CQA). The identification of CPPs is described in the dossier. 
As part of the assurance of quality of mosunetuzumab active substance, IPCs have been established. 
IPC tests and limits applied to the cell culture and purification process as well as modification reactions 
are  described.  Depending  on  criticality,  IPCs  are  tested  against  defined  action  limits  or  acceptance 
criteria.  Data  from  IPC  testing  of  the  process  verification  and  supportive  batches  are  provided  in  the 
dossier. 
Process validation 
The  mosunetuzumab  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  in  accordance  with 
relevant guidelines and the control strategy is acceptable. 
Manufacturing process verification (also referred to as process performance qualification (PPQ)) 
Active  substance  PPQ  was  performed  at  the  Applicant’s  commercial  active  substance  manufacturing 
facility  (Genentech,  SSF)  to  show  that  the  commercial  v0.2  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
producing  active  substance  of  consistent  quality  at  the  manufacturing  site  and  scale.  The  PPQ  is 
considered adequate. 
The  PPQ  data,  supported  by  the  data  from  the  supportive  batches,  confirm  that  the  process  is  in  a 
validated  state  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site  and  scale,  and  can  deliver  mosunetuzumab 
consistently with the expected product quality.   
A  sequence  variant  is  present  at  low  levels  that  were  within  clinical  experience.  Based  on  the  risk 
evaluation conducted by the Applicant, it can be agreed that the sequence variant at the levels observed 
is unlikely to impact the clinical safety profile, bioactivity, immunogenicity, or  PK of mosunetuzumab, 
and it can also be agreed that no routine testing is required. This position is in line with the CHMP/EMA 
Scientific Advice. In conclusion, the approach taken by the Applicant to control the level of the sequence 
variant is endorsed.  
Process parameter ranges and CPPs 
The process was developed using a Quality by Design (QbD) strategy driven by a science- and risk-based 
approach. This included prior knowledge gained from similar molecules and processes (the leveraging 
has been sufficiently justified) and mosunetuzumab-specific process validation studies, conducted both 
at scale and in sufficiently qualified scale-down models (SDMs).  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 15/16 
 
  
 
 
An  initial  risk  assessment  was  conducted  to  identify  potentially  critical  process  inputs  and  outputs. 
Selected process parameters were further investigated.  
CPPs are acceptable and have been identified.  
Clearance and worst-case linkage studies 
Process linkage studies are designed to challenge individual steps, or the overall process, with higher 
levels  of  process-related  impurities  or  product-variants  than  are  typically  present  during  routine 
manufacturing. Typically, the CQA level selected to challenge the process step was based on the highest 
observed value for the CQA from a process validation unit operation or in-process pool hold time study. 
The  studies  include  spiking  studies  and  unit-operation  worst-case  linkage  studies.  The  high  levels  of 
process-related impurities and product variants were demonstrated to be cleared to acceptable levels by 
the  purification  steps  for  which  high  impurity  clearance  are  claimed.  Robust  clearance  has  been 
demonstrated.  
Process hold times 
In  addition  to  the  IPCs  for  bioburden  and  endotoxin,  the  microbial  quality  of  mosunetuzumab  active 
substance is ensured through the manufacturing process designed for minimisation of risk of introduction 
and  proliferation  of  microbial  contaminants,  and  through  implementation  of  validated  in  process  hold 
times. The applicant has critically assessed the impact of each hold duration, as well as the cumulative 
hold time. The proposed active substance in-process hold times are considered justified. 
Process impact assessment 
A process impact (PI) assessment has been performed to assess the residual risk for the manufacturing 
process and its ability to produce active substance of consistent quality. PI assessments are based on 
the  data  from  process  validation  studies  to  support  process  performance  acceptable  ranges  and 
criticality,  biochemical  in-process  pool  hold  studies  (based  on  the  acceptable  pool  hold  times),  and 
process  linkage  studies,  as  well  as  data  from  manufacturing-scale  batches.  The  level  of  each  CQA  at 
different  process  steps  was  compared  to  an  established  limit;  either  an  in-process  pool  limit  (IPPL), 
active substance release acceptance criterion, or process validation assessment criterion.  
The  majority  of  the  CQAs  had  low  residual  risk,  meaning  that  they  are  well  controlled  during 
manufacturing  and/or  effectively  removed  during  manufacturing.  The  data  presented  in  the  PI 
assessment  support  the  conclusion  that  the  manufacturing  process  produces  active  substance  of 
consistent quality and as such the PI assessment is seen as support to the comparability study. 
Media hold times, potential impact of input materials and the proposed possible refiltrations of active 
substance  bulk  have  been  sufficiently  evaluated.  As  active  substance  and  finished  product  are 
manufactured at the same site, shipping qualification is not applicable.  
Sufficient information is provided on the potential residual levels of raw materials, potential leachable 
impurities from product-contacting materials, resin and membrane reuse and sanitisation and storage of 
resins.  
Sufficient method descriptions for assays used in the process validation studies and/or in-process testing 
are provided.  
Manufacturing process development 
Developmental history 
At  the  SSF  active  substance  manufacturing  site,  three  different  versions  of  the  active  substance 
manufacturing process were developed; toxicology process, v0.1 process and v0.2 process. There are 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 16/17 
 
  
 
 
no  differences  between  the  pivotal  clinical  process  and  commercial  process  (v0.2  manufacturing 
process). 
Minor changes were made between the toxicology process and v0.1 process.  
Further changes were implemented for the v0.2 active substance process. 
Comparability 
A  comparability  exercise  considered  the  types  of  changes  introduced  in  the  mosunetuzumab 
manufacturing  process  with  v0.2  and  the  potential  impact  of  observed  product  quality  differences on 
safety and efficacy. The comparability evaluation included active substance release analysis, extended 
characterisation  comparison  and  in  addition  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  to 
compare  the  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  mosunetuzumab  from  the  v0.1  and  v0.2  processes. 
Overall, the results of the comparability exercise showed that the manufacturing process changes did 
not have an adverse impact on the quality, safety, or efficacy of mosunetuzumab, and determined that 
v0.1  material  and toxicology  material  were  comparable  to  v0.2  material.  In  addition  to  comparability 
evaluation, process impact assessment was performed, see details in sections above. The data presented 
in the process impact assessment support the conclusion that the manufacturing process produces active 
substance of consistent quality. Comparability is considered sufficiently addressed.  
Critical quality attribute assessment  
A  list  of  identified  CQAs  has  been  provided.  Each  CQA  is  controlled  at  the  appropriate  stage  in  the 
manufacturing  process.  QAs  were  first  categorised  to  determine  if  a  risk  assessment  was  needed  to 
classify an attribute as a CQA or non-CQA. The identified CQAs, as well as the approach used to classify 
attributes as CQAs, are found acceptable.  
Characterisation  
Overall,  the  structural,  physiochemical  and  biological  characterisation  of  mosunetuzumab  active 
substance is considered comprehensive and sufficient.   
The structural confirmation and characterisation of the physicochemical properties of mosunetuzumab 
has  been  performed  using  the  secondary  reference  standard.  The  characterisation  studies  were 
performed  using  the  proposed  commercial  release  analytical  methods  and  extended  characterisation 
methods  to  assess  the  primary,  secondary  and  higher  order  structure,  as  well  as  post-translational 
modifications.  
Methods to assess mosunetuzumab biological properties include the proposed potency method used for 
commercial release as well as extended characterisation methods.  
Data demonstrate that the in vitro biological activity measured by the potency assay is reflective of the 
key aspects of mosunetuzumab MOA.  
Process-related impurities 
Process-related impurities are impurities derived from the manufacturing process. 
Process-related impurities have been sufficiently characterised and assessed. 
2.4.2.3. Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch 
analysis, and container closure 
Specifications 
The commercial release and shelf life specifications for mosunetuzumab active substance were 
provided. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 17/18 
 
  
 
 
The specifications include general tests, test for identity, purity and impurity tests for product-related 
impurities, tests for excipients, test for protein content, test for potency, as well as tests for safety.  
Sufficient justification for the tests which are not performed during shelf life has been provided.  
The  justification  of  the  acceptance  criteria  for  mosunetuzumab  active  substance  is  based  on  a 
combination of different information such as clinical experience, product-specific knowledge, Applicant’s 
experience  with  related  molecules,  formulation  development  studies,  storage  and  process  effects, 
regulatory guidelines and manufacturing experience. For most attributes, acceptance criteria for the final 
specification  (in  most  cases,  finished  product  shelf  life)  are  the  anchor  points  for  the  sets  of  CQA 
acceptance criteria. Working backward from the final testing point, the potential storage- and process-
related effects were considered for each preceding acceptance criteria, in order to ensure that the final 
acceptance criteria will be met. Overall, the approach used to set the active substance acceptance criteria 
is accepted.  
The acceptance criteria set for the qualitative and quantitative attributes have been sufficiently justified 
and are accepted. In addition, the acceptance criteria have been tightened during development. 
Overall, the parameters included in the active substance specification are found adequate to control the 
quality of mosunetuzumab active substance. 
Analytical procedures 
The analytical procedures used for batch release of mosunetuzumab active substance are a combination 
of compendial and non-compendial methods. Only methods specific to the active substance are described 
in  this  section.  Descriptions  of  the  analytical  procedures  used  for  both  active  substance  and  finished 
product are provided.  
The panel of methods used to assure the quality of the active substance is in accordance with ICH Q6B, 
Ph. Eur. 2031, and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008. The analytical procedures are in general described in 
sufficient  details.  Information  on  reference  standard  is  included  where  relevant.  The  methods  are 
considered suitable for their intended use.  
The  compendial  analytical  procedure  Bioburden  for  testing  of  the  active  substance  is  performed  in 
accordance with the method described in the relevant pharmacopoeia and was qualified for use with the 
active substance and in-process samples demonstrating recovery of challenge organisms in the presence 
of the different samples. 
A  summary  of  validation  for  the  non-compendial  methods  has  been  provided.  The  non-compendial 
analytical  methods  have  in  general  been  sufficiently  validated  according  to  ICH  Q2  to  control  active 
substance.  
Reference standards 
See finished product (the same reference standard is used for finished product and active substance 
testing). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data have been provided for three full-scale  clinical batches and three supportive batches  
produced by the process v0.1, as well as for three full-scale PPQ and three full-scale supportive batches 
produced with the process v0.2. All batch data comply with the specifications valid at the time of testing 
and demonstrate adequate batch-to-batch consistency.  
Container closure

Mosunetuzumab  active  substance is  filled  and  stored.  The  polymer  primary  packaging  components  of 
the tanks are compliant with USP Class VI Standards per USP <88> and the risk for potential leachables 
agreed to be sufficiently low.  
2.4.2.4. Stability 
The  stability  studies  are  designed  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5C  Stability  testing  of  biotechnological/ 
biological products. A shelf life of 48 months is proposed at a storage condition.  
Long-term stability studies are on-going for three PPQ mosunetuzumab active substance batches; data 
are available for up to 48 months. Stability data at 48 months are also available for one supportive R&D 
batch. The four batches enrolled in stability were manufactured with the commercial process v0.2, except 
for the supportive batch. Trends were not observed at the intended storage temperature for any test.  
In addition, the four batches were tested in accelerated and stress conditions for 6 months and 1 month, 
respectively. A set of active substance release methods was used to assess stability behaviour, some of 
the methods (i.e. purity and potency) being stability indicating. The provided stability data is sufficient 
to  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  for  the  active  substance.  The  post-approval 
stability protocol and stability commitment are acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1. Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
Description 
The  mosunetuzumab  finished  product  is  a  sterile  aqueous  solution  of  mosunetuzumab,  which  is 
colourless, pH 5.8 and osmolality of 240-333 mOsm/kg. 
The  mosunetuzumab  finished  product  is  supplied  as  a  1  mg/mL  solution  in  a  single-use  vial  with  L-
histidine  and  acetic  acid  as  buffering  agents,  L-methionine,  sucrose  as  isotonicity/stabilising  agent, 
polysorbate 20 as surfactant and water for injections. 
All excipients are compendial.  
Mosunetuzumab is presented in 2 sizes (pack of one vial each):  
- 1 mg/vial with 1 mL solution in a 2 mL vial (1 mg strength); 
- 30 mg/vial with 30 mL solution in a 50 mL vial (30 mg strength). 
The container closure system consists of a Type 1 clear glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper and 
aluminium overseal with a plastic flip-off cap (dark grey for 1 mg strength and light blue for 30 mg 
strength). Vial and stopper are compliant with Ph. Eur 3.2.1 and 3.2.9, respectively. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product formulation is identical to the active substance formulation with the exception of 
the  concentration  of  mosunetuzumab.  Excipients  include  L-histidine  and  acetic  acid  as  buffering/pH 
adjusting  agents,  sucrose  as  isotonicity/stabilising  agent  and  polysorbate  20  as  surfactant.  No  novel 
excipients or excipients of human or animal origin have been identified. Compatibility of active substance 
with the excipients is considered demonstrated. 
Two different formulations have been used during the clinical studies. Formulation development included 
adjustment of the concentration of mosunetuzumab,. The fill volume has also been adjusted to fit clinical 
EMA/390815/2022

needs. The mosunetuzumab finished product manufacturing process includes sterile filtration, filling into 
vials, capping & crimping and final visual inspection before secondary packaging. 
Comparability assessments have been conducted between the Phase 1 clinical) and the pivotal Clinical 
and  commercial)  formulations  as  well  as  between  the  different  presentations  of  the  F02  formulation. 
Similar trends were seen between the formulations and presentations. Analytical profiles were similar 
and no new peaks were observed. 
The  selected  formulation  for  commercial  mosunetuzumab  active  substance  and  finished  product  is 
identical to the formulation F02 used in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies. 
The  mosunetuzumab  finished  product  does  not  contain  preservatives.  The  finished  product  is  sterile 
filtered using an aseptic filling process. Satisfactory microbiological testing and container closure integrity 
testing (CCIT) is proposed as release and stability testing. 
Container closure 
The proposed container closure system is a Type I glass vial with a butyl stopper and aluminium overseal 
with  a  flip-off  cap.  The  CCS  is  suitable  for  the  finished  product  as  documented  by  long-term  and 
accelerated stability data incl. testing of container closure integrity and sterility. The secondary cardboard 
packaging protects the finished product from light as it is shown to be light sensitive. Comprehensive 
extractables and leachables (E/L) studies have been performed on the container closure system. All of 
the identified E/L are below the defined threshold permitted daily exposure (PDE) values. 
Compatibility 
The  compatibility  of  the  mosunetuzumab  finished  product  with  the  infusion  set  and  bag  has  been 
evaluated for both the 1 mg and the 30 mg strengths. The product is stable in a range of commercially 
available 0.45% and 0.9% saline infusion bags with a PVC infusion set without in-line filters during 24 
hours  at  5°C  followed  by  24  hours  at  30°C  with  subsequent  infusion  over  480  minutes  covering  the 
proposed in-use period. 
Overall, pharmaceutical development of mosunetuzumab finished product is considered acceptable.  
2.4.3.2. Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Batch  certification  for  EU  release  is  performed  at  Roche  Pharma  AG,  Emil-Barell-Strasse  1,  79639 
Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany. 
The finished product manufacturing process was provided in a figure and includes sterile filtration, filling 
and capping, visual inspection and cold storage. 
Process controls 
The  process  parameters  have  been  defined  for  all  process  steps  and  cover  volumes,  temperatures, 
mixing speeds and durations, filtration parameters and filling parameters. Process and hold times have 
likewise  been  defined  for  all  steps.  In-process  controls  are  appropriate.  The  fill  weight  of  the  vial  is 
checked during filling. Visual inspection is performed on 100% of the filled vials and on an acceptance 
quality limit (AQL) sample of the inspected vials. The proposed controls are considered adequate. 
Process validation 
The PPQ was performed on 1 mg/vial and 30 mg/vial commercial scale batches. In addition to controls 
defined by 3.2.P.3.3 and 3.2.P.3.4, homogeneity during filling was also performed. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 20/21 
 
  
 
 
The submitted data demonstrate that the process is generally well controlled with little variation in the 
reported results. 
Comprehensive process design studies have been submitted. 
Equipment,  utilities  and  sterilising  processes  were  adequately  qualified  prior  to  the  PPQ  including 
autoclaving of stoppers, decontamination of the filling isolator & aseptic processing media fill. A product 
specific  filter  validation  including  bacterial  retention  supporting  the  proposed  processing  limits  is 
submitted. 
A transport study covering the pallet transport to the site of secondary packaging is submitted. 
In  light  of  ongoing  pandemic-related  supply  constraints,  an  alternate  vessel  was  included  to  avoid 
potential supply issues at launch. The Applicant’s proposed approach to qualify the alternate vessel for 
use in the commercial finished product manufacturing process is considered acceptable. However, the 
Applicant is recommended to submit the remaining verification data when available.  
2.4.3.3. Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specifications 
The release and shelf life specifications for mosunetuzumab finished product were presented. 
The proposed finished product release and shelf life specifications for mosunetuzumab have been 
provided for both dosage forms. The release specification includes general tests , test for identity, 
purity and impurity tests for product-related impurities, test for excipient, test for protein content, test 
for potency, as well as tests for safety. Overall, the parameters included in the finished product 
specification are found adequate to control the quality of mosunetuzumab finished product at release. 
The shelf life specification has been provided. Sufficient justification has been provided. CCIT is included 
in the shelf life specification.  
The justification of the acceptance criteria for mosunetuzumab is based on a combination of different 
information such as clinical experience, product-specific knowledge, Applicant’s experience with related 
molecules, formulation development studies, storage and process effects and manufacturing experience. 
For most attributes, acceptance criteria for the final specification (in most cases, finished product shelf 
life)  are  the  anchor  points  for  the  sets  of  CQA  acceptance  criteria.  Working  backward  from  the  final 
testing  point,  the  potential  storage-  and  process-related  effects  were  considered  for  each  preceding 
acceptance  criteria,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  final  acceptance  criteria  will  be  met.  In  addition, 
acceptance  criteria  for  Osmolality,  Visible  particles,  Sub-visible  particles,  Sterility  and  Bacterial 
endotoxins are established to align with pharmacopoeia requirements. Overall, the approach used to set 
the acceptance criteria for the finished products is accepted.  
The acceptance criteria set for the qualitative and quantitative attributes have been sufficiently justified 
and can be accepted.  
The test for Visible particles on finished product is performed during shelf life. At release, the acceptance 
quality  limit  (AQL)  testing  results  performed  at  the  finished  product  manufacturing  site  (SSF)  will  be 
used  for  commercial  release  in  the  EU/EEA.  The  Applicant  provided  appropriate  rationale  and  the 
proposed setup is from a scientific point of view acceptable. 
The QC testing for Bacterial endotoxins is only performed at active substance release. For the finished 
product, the results from in-process testing performed at the finished product manufacturing site will be 
used for commercial release in the EU/EEA. The strategy is considered acceptable.

Analytical procedures 
The panel of methods used to assure the quality of the finished product is in accordance with ICH Q6B, 
Ph. Eur. 2031, and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008. The analytical procedures are in general described in 
sufficient  details.  Information  on  reference  standard  is  included  where  relevant.  The  methods  are 
considered suitable for their intended use.  
The compendial analytical procedures are performed in accordance with the methods described in the 
relevant pharmacopoeia and were sufficiently verified for their suitability. Suitability verification has been 
performed for active substance and/or finished product, as well as for in-process samples.  
Sterility  testing  is  performed  using  either  the  compendial  procedure  or  an  alternative  method.  The 
compendial procedure was adequately verified for suitability with the finished product. Validation of the 
alternative method was designed in agreement with ICH guidelines, Ph. Eur. 5.1.6., USP <1223>, PDA 
Technical  Report  No.  33,  and  EDQM  guidelines  (Examples  of  Validation  Protocols  of  the  Alternative 
Microbiological Methods According to Chapter 5.1.6 “Alternative methods for control of microbiological 
quality,” Edition 2018). Method validation using mosunetuzumab finished product was performed. The 
compendial sterility test method will be maintained until the alternative method is approved for ongoing 
clinical trials across the Applicant’s manufacturing network. After this transition, the alternative method 
will be used as the commercial release test method, while the compendial sterility test method will be 
maintained as backup option (e.g. in case of equipment failure). With the Applicant’s confirmation that 
the  two  methods  cannot  be  used  interchangeably  for  batch  release  testing,  the  approach  is  found 
acceptable. 
In general, the non-compendial analytical procedures are described in sufficient detail. Information on 
the reference standards are included where relevant. The methods were adequately validated for their 
suitability for intended use. Further, the stability-indicating methods were identified.  
Some methods were transferred using a method transfer protocol.  
The  testing  of  container  closure  integrity  is  performed.  Sufficient  evidence  has  been  provided  to 
demonstrate equivalence to the microbial ingress test. Therefore, the use of both methods is acceptable.  
Reference standards 
A two-tiered reference material system has been established. Three different reference standards (RS) 
− initial, primary and secondary − have been used throughout the development of mosunetuzumab. The 
initial  RS  was  produced  with  process  v0.1  while  the  primary  and  secondary  RS  were  produced  using 
process  v0.2.  Information  on  the  batches  (number,  source,  date  of  manufacture)  and  the  use  are 
included. The finished product batches used in the pivotal clinical study GO29781 were manufactured 
from  the  same  active  substance  run  as  primary  reference  standard,  supporting  the  link  between  the 
primary and secondary RS and the pivotal clinical material and commercial material. 
The primary and secondary RS were prepared at the same time from the same active substance batches. 
Qualification  included  active  substance  release  methods  as  well  as  additional  characterisation.  The 
acceptance criteria used to qualify the current RS are based on active substance release specification, 
except  for  the  acceptance  criterion  for  potency,  which  is  tighter  than  the  active  substance  release 
specification.  Potency  assignment  is  based  on  multiple  independent  determinations,  which  is  found 
adequate to prevent shift of potency.  
The procedure for preparation and qualification of future reference standards is provided and deemed 
sufficient (release and extended characterisation will be performed, chromatographic and electrophoretic 
profiles will be compared, potency assignment is described and suitable to prevent drift, approach for 
stability testing is given).

Batch analysis 
PPQ  batches  were  manufactured  at  the  proposed  commercial  scale  and  used  for  clinical  studies.  In 
addition, batch data are provided for batches used for clinical studies and manufactured at, as well as 
for supportive nonclinical batches. All results are compliant with the established limits and are consistent 
across  the  batches  with  an  acceptable  batch-to-batch  variation.  The  batch  release  data  demonstrate 
consistent quality of the mosunetuzumab finished product throughout development and for commercial 
purpose. 
Characterisation of impurities  
The mosunetuzumab finished product manufacturing process includes aseptic filling and capping. No new 
impurities are generated during the finished product manufacturing process and all impurities observed 
in the finished product were characterised for the active substance.  
The  Applicant  has  provided  a  risk  assessment  for  elemental  impurities  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q3D 
guideline  and  showed  that  the  potential  major  contributions  to  the  elemental  impurities  are  from  the 
freeze/thaw tank and container closure system. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch 
data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished 
product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk assessment regarding the potential presence of nitrosamines in Lunsumio was provided where it 
is concluded that the risk is negligible. Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was 
identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
2.4.3.4. Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 24 months at 2°C-8°C is proposed. This is supported by the data presented. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C and 24 hours at 
9°C-30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user and would normally 
not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated 
aseptic conditions 
Primary stability studies were conducted on the commercial scale PPQ batches for up to 30 months in 
long  term  storage  conditions  and  for  up  to  6  months  in  accelerated  conditions  are  presented  for  all 
primary batches 
Additional studies have been performed on 2 clinical batches, 1 representative technical and 2 supportive 
R&D stability batches at both long-term storage conditions (5°C) and accelerated conditions (25°C). 24 
to 48 long term are presented as well as 6 months accelerated data. 
Generally, no alarming trends are observed at 5°C. Slight increases of impurities and decrease of purity 
is observed and this is confirmed by the data at accelerated conditions. Trends are comparable across 
presentations. Stability stress studies have been conducted at 30°C/2 months and 40°C/1 months. These 
studies confirm the degradation pathways observed at lower temperatures. 
In general, the proposed protocols are in accordance with current guidelines. 
The Applicant committed to place one batch in long-term stability per year with yearly time points and 
testing according to the stability specification. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 23/24 
 
  
 
 
An  ICH  Q1B  photostability  study  has  been  conducted  concluding  that  the  mosunetuzumab  finished 
product is photosensitive. A temperature cycling (incl. freeze/thaw) study have been conducted on one 
PPQ batch of each presentation. Data show that the product is not susceptible to temperature cycling. 
Lunsumio vial should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
2.4.3.5. Product Lifecycle Management (PLCM)  
The  Applicant  initially  provided  a  Product  Lifecycle  Management  (PLCM)  plan  including  Established 
Conditions. As requested, and due to the fact that such documents cannot currently be recognised in the 
EU, the Applicant removed the PLCM from the dossier. 
2.4.3.6. Adventitious agents 
Raw materials 
Animal-derived raw materials are compliant with the guidance for minimizing the risk of transfer of TSE 
(EMA/410/01, Rev. 3). Based on the information provided, the risk of transmitting adventitious viral or 
non-viral agents is evaluated to be negligible. 
Cell banks 
Cell  banks,  including  the master,  working,  and end  of  production  cell  banks,  and  cells  at  LIVCA  have 
been characterised according to ICH Q5A and ICH Q5D,. No non-viral nor viral adventitious agents were 
detected. No endogenous retroviruses were detected except for retroviral like particles (RVLP), type A 
and  C,  which  are  known  to  be  present  in  cells  of  CHO  origin.  Based  on  the  results  obtained,  the  cell 
banks are considered safe for use in manufacture of mosunetuzumab with regards to the risk of viral 
and non-viral adventitious agents and endogenous retroviruses. 
Testing at appropriate stages of production 
The mosunetuzumab active substance is tested for absence of bacteria and fungi (bioburden), and level 
of  endotoxin during  manufacture  (IPC)  and  at  release.  In  addition,  the  preharvest  cell  culture  fluid is 
subjected to testing of absence of mycoplasma and general in vitro test for absence of viral adventitious 
agents  .  The  finished  product  is  tested  for  bioburden  and  level  of  endotoxin  during  manufacture  and 
sterility and level of endotoxin at release. No contamination has been detected. The number of RVLPs 
have been determined in three batches by TEM. The highest number of the three batches was used to 
calculate the retrovirus safety factor (see below under “virus clearance validation”. The testing conducted 
during manufacture and at release is considered sufficient and in line with current requirements. 
Viral clearance studies. 
The viral clearance capacity of the mosunetuzumab active substance purification process was evaluated 
by conducting viral clearance studies, using qualified scale down models in accordance with ICH Q5A. 
The scale down procedure is considered acceptable and the scale down models are representative of the 
commercial scale. Studies were conducted under worst-case conditions, when applicable. Virus detection 
assays  included  detector  cell  based  tests  and  PCR.  The  assays  used  have  been  properly  validated, 
including sample type (matrix) validation.  
Efficient clearance (> 4 log reduction values) was observed for each of the three model viruses by at 
least two of the process steps validated. The studies show an acceptable viral clearance potential of the 
manufacturing  process.  The  quantitative  virus  risk  assessment  demonstrates  an  acceptable  safety 
margin for the studied viruses in the manufacturing process including the retroviral clearance.  
Conclusion 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 24/25 
 
  
 
 
Overall, the risk of contamination with adventitious agents, including TSE, mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, 
and  viruses,  is  considered  well  contained  based  on  selection  of  safe  raw  materials,  demonstration  of 
absence of adventitious (and endogenous) agents in cell banks, testing at relevant stages of the process, 
and finally the substantial virus clearance capacity, demonstrated for the mosunetuzumab purification 
process. 
Based on this, mosunetuzumab is considered safe for commercial purposes with regards to the risk of 
contamination with adventitious non-viral or viral agents or with endogenous viruses. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Lunsumio is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved 
monoclonal antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing ICH/CHMP guidelines.  
The manufacturing processes of the active substance and finished product are adequately described, 
controlled and validated. Active substance and finished product batch release data indicate robust 
reproducible manufacturing processes within and between manufacturing sites. All pre-defined 
acceptance criteria were met. The active substance and finished product manufacturing history is 
described in sufficient detail and the outcome of the comparability evaluations of different processes 
used is satisfactory. 
The active substance has been extensively characterised with regard to its physicochemical and 
biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. 
Process- and product-related impurities have been evaluated and are sufficiently cleared during the 
process and/or controlled at release. 
The quality of the active substance and finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
No major objection was identified during the procedure. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Lunsumio is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physico-chemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Lunsumio is considered approvable from the quality point of view.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
In relation to the use of an alternate vessel in the commercial finished product manufacturing process, 
the Applicant is recommended to submit the remaining verification data when available.

2.5.   Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacological activity and 
mode of action of mosunetuzumab. During development and nonclinical testing, two earlier versions of 
mosunetuzumab were also investigated (referred to as 2H7v16/40G5c and the proof-of-concept (POC) 
molecule, referred to as 2H7v16/UCHT1v9). All three anti-CD20/CD3 T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) 
antibodies  are  based  on  the  same  modification  technology;  Cynomolgus  monkey  was  selected  as  the 
appropriate  animal  species  for  assessing  the  nonclinical  safety,  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of mosunetuzumab and 2H7v16/40G5c. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
To evaluate the cross-species in vitro binding and potency of 2H7v16/40G5c, the binding affinity of the 
anti-CD3  antibody  arm  to  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  CD3εγ  antigens  was  investigated.  It  was 
demonstrated  that  the  binding  affinities  to  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  CD3εγ  antigens  were 
comparable, and furthermore, comparable in vitro potency for B-cell killing was demonstrated in human 
and cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Due to technical limitations it was 
not possible to develop a robust, reproducible and accurate IHC assay to assess specific tissue binding 
and  determine  the  potential  cross-reactivity  of  mosunetuzumab  in  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey 
tissue, as mosunetuzumab exhibits poor analytical sensitivity and specificity as an IHC reagent. No cross-
reactivity studies were conducted in other species, e.g. rodents, dogs or rabbits. Mosunetuzumab showed 
marginal binding to human Fc gamma receptors FcγRs (including FcγRIA, IIA-H131, IIA-R131, IIB, IIIA-
F158, and IIIA-V158) and human C1q.  
During  development,  two  different  drug  substance  manufacturing  processes  were  developed  yielding 
mosunetuzumab v0.1 and v0.2. Mosunetuzumab v0.1 has been used for the investigational new drug 
(IND), enabling pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies, as well as for the ongoing Phase 
I study, where mosunetuzumab v0.2 was since developed. Binding studies to both CD20 and CD3∑ on 
B  cells  and  T  cells  showed  comparable  activity  in  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  between  the  two 
versions, and the change in manufacturing process is not considered to have an impact on the nonclinical 
profile of mosunetuzumab. 
It was confirmed in vitro that 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 is inactive with cynomolgus monkey PBMCs while only 
2H7v16/40G5c was able to activate CD8+ T cells and kill cynomolgus monkey B cells in a comparability 
study. In human PBMCs, both antibodies had comparable in vitro potency in B-cell killing and induced a 
similar extent of B-cell killing. Though not statistically significant, 2H7v16/40G5c appeared to have lower 
potency in CD8+ T-cell activation and resulted in a lower extent of CD8+ T-cell activation and cytokine 
production (IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α). Mosunetuzumab and 2H7v16/40G5c demonstrated comparable 
target antigen binding affinity as well as no apparent difference in their potency in B-cell killing, CD8+ T-
cell activation, and cytokine production 
The binding and activity of 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 was investigated in vitro in human donor PBMCs against 
the  B-cell  line  BJAB.  It  was  demonstrated  that  B-cell  killing  does  not  appear  to  be  dependent  on  Fc 
expression or Fc receptor−mediated effector functions. Furthermore, it was shown that the activity of 
2H7v16/UCHT1v9 is dependent on both the presence of CD3 expressing T cells and CD20+ expressing 
B cells, confirming the bimodular action of 2H7v16/UCHT1v9, as no activity is detected in the absence 
of either cell type. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can be activated by 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 in the presence of 
B cells. However, it appears that CD8+ T cells are more potent in BJAB cell killing compared to CD4+ T

cells,  as  CD8+  T  cells  mediated  a  greater  extent  of  cell  killing  as  well  as  producing  higher  levels  of 
granzyme  B  and  perforin  when  activated.  2H7v16/UCHT1v9  was  also  potent  in  killing  CD20  low-
expressing  B-lymphoma  cells.    Further,  there  was  no  particular  correlation  between  EC50s  and  CD20 
expression in cells where CD20 expression levels were available. EC50s from healthy donor B cells were 
of a wide range and wider range than for EC50s for lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL.  
The activity of 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 was confirmed in vivo after single-dosing in a human CD20/CD3 double-
transgenic mouse model in spleen samples. 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 bound to both mouse B and T cells and 
showed high activity as well as a significant clearance of splenic B cells. T-cell dependency as part of the 
mechanism of action for CD20 TDB antibodies was confirmed in vivo in a human CD20 single-transgenic 
mouse model, as 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 only bound to mouse B cells in this model and elicited no activity. 
The efficacious dose of 2H7v16/UCHT1v9 for complete B-cell depletion in blood and lymphoid tissues in 
double-transgenic mice was established at 0.5 mg/kg as single dosing, as this was the minimal dose to 
sustain  depletion  for  15  days.  In  a  similar  double-transgenic  mouse  model,  2H7v16/40G5c  potently 
depleted tissue B cells starting at Day 1 post-dose which was complete at Day 3 post-dose, with some 
recovery observed at 14 days post-dose. Corresponding activation of both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells 
(measured  as  CD69  expression)  was  detected  in  the  spleen  at  Day  1  post-dose,  with  up  to  5-fold 
increases in CD8+ T-cell counts at Day 2 post-dose. Activation of T-cells gradually decreased to or below 
baseline levels between Days 2 and 14 post-dose, whereas the increase in T-cell numbers normalised 
between Days 5 and 14 post-dose, corresponding to depletion of B-cells and thus a lack of continued T-
cell activation due to the missing TBD CD20 target. In the double-transgenic mouse model, it was also 
shown  that  2H7v16/40G5c  and  mosunetuzumab  have  comparable  profiles  in  potently  depleting 
peripheral  and  tissue  B  cells  as  well  as  activation  of  T  cells.  Following  repeat-dosing  of  0.5  mg/kg 
administered  once  weekly  for  three  weeks  in  humanized  NSG  mice,  both  2H7v16/UCHT1v9  and 
2H7v16/40G5c potently depleted peripheral B cells to a similar extent with almost complete depletion of 
B cells in blood until the end of the study (day 21 post-dose). 
The PD effect of mosunetuzumab was investigated in cynomolgus monkey after single and repeat dose 
administration  by  evaluating  effects  on  B-cell  depletion,  T-cell  kinetics  and  activation  as  well  as  the 
cytokine release profile. In the pivotal GLP single-dose toxicity study (Study 14-1246) following 1-hour 
IV  infusion  of  mosunetuzumab,  dose  levels  above  0.1  mg/kg  induced  rapid  dose-dependent  B-cell 
depletion  from  peripheral  blood,  with  complete  or  near  complete  depletion  at  dose  levels  above  0.1 
mg/kg.  As  in  mice,  B-cell  depletion  was  also  sustained  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  through  day  22  after 
dosing  with  recovery  observed  at  day  57.  Administration  of  mosunetuzumab  was  associated  with 
transient and dose-dependent T-cell activation in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a tendency for greater 
activation among CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, as also observed in vitro. Transient decreases in circulating T 
cell, cytotoxic T cell, natural killer cell, and monocyte counts were detected as early as 2 hours after 
mosunetuzumab  administration,  which  recovered  to  baseline  by  3  days  after  dosing,  most  likely 
attributable  to  activation-induced  T-cell  margination  followed  by  redistribution  and/or  expansion. 
Corresponding dose-dependent increases in cytokine and chemokine levels were detected rapidly after 
dosing (~2h) and declined to baseline levels within 24 hours following mosunetuzumab administration. 
Dose-dependent increases in serum levels of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) were detected with maximum 
fold increases in BAFF occurring on Day 9 (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) and Day 23 (1 mg/kg). SC dosing at 1 
mg/kg resulted in similar findings for B-cell depletion and T-cell activation compared to IV administration 
of 1 mg/kg. 
PD effects of 2H7v16/40G5c and mosunetuzumab were also investigated in several studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys after repeated dosing and generally confirmed the findings from the single dose 
studies. In a dose range finding (DRF) toxicity study (Study 12-3160), 2H7v16/40G5c was 
administered at doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks including a 7-week recovery 
period. Within hours of dosing, a rapid depletion of circulating B cells was observed, which was

sustained in the majority of animals given 1 mg/kg as well as in recovery animals 6-8 weeks after the 
final dose.

Single-Dose  Studies  in  Cynomolgus  Monkeys  (Studies  14-1246,  13-2298,  13-1514,  and  13-
2135) 
The PD effects of mosunetuzumab were evaluated in the GLP single-dose toxicity study (Study 14-1246) 
following 1-hour IV infusion at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg or SC injection at 1 mg/kg, and in a single-dose 
pharmacokinetic and PD study (Study 13-2298) following IV bolus injection (approximately 30 seconds 
to 1 minute) of 0.001−1 mg/kg. In addition, the PD effects of 2H7v16/40G5c were assessed in two single-
dose studies following IV slow bolus injection of 2H7v16/40G5c at 1 mg/kg. The first study (Study 13-
1514) was conducted in a cohort of 3 animals followed for 7 days. The second study (Study 13-2135) 
expanded  to  3  cohorts  with  necropsy  after  3,  14,  or  28  days.  Results  were  similar  between 
mosunetuzumab and 2H7v16/40G5c and across studies; data from Study 14-1246 are presented below. 
B-Cell Depletion 
Mosunetuzumab induced rapid B-cell depletion from peripheral blood within 2 hours at dose levels above 
0.01 mg/kg. Dose-dependent B-cell depletion in the spleen and lymph nodes was observed in all dose 
groups with complete or near complete depletion achieved at dose levels ≥0.1 mg/kg by Day 8 post-
dose. B-cell depletion was sustained in the periphery and lymphoid tissues through Day 22 after dose 
administration for animals given 1 mg/kg and recovered by Day 57.  B-cell depletion in the blood and 
tissues were comparable for IV and SC dosing at 1 mg/kg.

Mosunetuzumab (Study 14-1246) – Circulating B Cells (CD40+) 
Pharmacodynamic Effects following a Single Intravenous Administration of 
In the 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg dose groups, a recovery in B cells was observed at the beginning of week 
two due to formation of ADA and subsequent loss of drug exposure, presumably due to an incomplete 
depletion of B cells at the lower dose levels, which are then available for production of ADA. 4 of 4 
animals in the 0.01 mg/kg group developed high titers ADA while only one animal given 0.1 mg/kg did 
not develop ADA. In this animal, complete B-cell depletion in blood and lymphoid tissues was 
observed, confirming the PD effect at this dose level. 5 of 8 animals dosed with 1 mg/kg developed 
ADA. Increases in BAFF levels inversely correlated with B-cell depletion. A step-up mosunetuzumab 
dosing regimen was used in the 4-week DRF study and the pivotal GLP 26-week repeat-dose toxicity 
studies (Study 16-2088 and 16-1815) by splitting the first 1 mg/kg dose to Day 1 (0.2 mg/kg) and 
Day 2 (0.8 mg/kg), followed by weekly doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg or 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. 
Using this approach, a split of the first dose resulted in a reduction in the observed cytokine-related 
acute toxicities while ADA formation was mitigated to some extent due to the high initial dose of 1 
mg/kg IV administered within the first two days.  
During both the 4-week and 26-week repeat-dose studies, a rapid and sustained depletion of B-cells 
and corresponding increase in BAFF was observed in animals that did not develop ADA, in line with 
previous results. In these animals, exposure was furthermore demonstrated as the mean serum 
concentration was approximately maintained over time as well as a maintained or slightly increasing 
Cmax and AUC over time (dose-normalized), confirming that ADA did not affect the results of the 
study. As also observed in the single dose studies, a transient reduction in T cells from peripheral blood 
at day 2 post-dose was observed primarily after the first dosing cycle with 2H7v16/40G5c, which 
returned to baseline at day 8 post-dose. T-cell activation was confirmed after repeated dosing of both 
2H7v16/40G5c and mosunetuzumab, primarily CD8+ T cells and to a lesser extent CD4+ T cells. The 
response was most significant after cycle 1 compared to cycle 2-4 where only modest activation was 
observed. Corresponding increases in chemokines and cytokines was observed 2-6 hours post-dose, 
which returned to pre-dose levels by 24 hours post-dose following the first dose only. These findings 
support the mechanism of initial (complete) depletion of the entire pool of B cells with reduction in T 
cell count and release of cytokines/chemokines during cycle 1 and subsequent maintenance of the B-
cell depletion with only moderate/slight changes in T cell count and cytokine production after the 
subsequent doses.

2.5.2.2.   Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  an  in  vitro  binding  assay  for  human  Fcγ  receptors,  it  was  shown  that  while  the  positive  control 
trastuzumab binds robustly to the Fcγ receptors, mosunetuzumab showed minimal detectable binding to 
the Fcγ receptor tested. This is expected due to the mutation introduced in the N297 residue in the Fc 
binding region which results in aglycosylation and minimal capability of binding to effector cells via this 
region. Thus, mosunetuzumab appears to have a low potential for Fcγ receptor cross-linking on immune 
cells  leading  to  induction  of  nontargeted  immune  cell  activation  (e.g.  ADCC  and  ADCP).  The  binding 
affinity to C1q was investigated in vitro.  It was shown that mosunetuzumab exhibits minimal binding 
activities to C1q, thus, mosunetuzumab is not expected to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity. 
2.5.2.3.   Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular effects were investigated as part of the single dose GLP study  in monkeys (Study 14-
1246). Monkeys were instrumented with surgically-implanted telemetry devices and evaluated from pre-
dose to 3 weeks post-dose. Increases in heart rate and body temperature were noted at 0.1 mg/kg (IV) 
and 1 mg/kg (IV or SC) on Day 1, resulting in attenuated diurnal patterns. Hypotension was furthermore 
observed at 1 mg/kg IV. Decreases in PR and QT intervals in animals given 1 mg/kg (IV or SC) correlated 
with  increases  in  heart  rates  (RR  interval  decreases).  When  corrected  for  heart-rate,  no  significant 
differences were noted in the QT intervals (QTc) compared with pre-dose levels. It appears that effects 
on  QT  were  heart-rate  dependent  and  not  indicative  of  an  effect  of  mosunetuzumab  on  ventricular 
repolarization kinetics, which is accepted. All cardiovascular related findings generally occurred following 
the  first  dose  and  diminished  or  were  absent  following  subsequent  weekly  administrations.  The 
cardiovascular effects are considered to be secondary to mosunetuzumab-induced cytokine release and 
associated  acute  phase  protein  reactions.  In  clinical  trials,  hypotension  and  tachycardia  have  been 
reported as symptoms of CRS in patients treated with mosunetuzumab. Because mosunetuzumab is a 
high  molecular  weight  monoclonal  antibody,  which  in  theory  has  a  low  likelihood  of  direct  interaction 
with  cardiac  ion  channels,  the  risk  for  QT  prolongation  is  considered  to  be  low.  The  NOAEL  for  the 
cardiovascular system following single IV administration is 0.1 mg/kg. Similar findings were observed in 
the  4-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  in  monkeys,  which  was  also  considered  attributed  to 
mosunetuzumab-induced cytokine release. 
Microscopic  findings  of  minimal  to  mild  vascular/perivascular  inflammatory  cell  infiltrates  has  been 
observed in single and repeat-dose studies in mosunetuzumab-treated monkeys, primarily in the brain 
white matter and with less incidence within spinal cord and sciatic nerve. In the brain, the changes were 
associated  with  local  microglial  phagocytosis  reaction,  though  no  neuronal  degeneration  or  vascular 
damage  was  observed.  The  effects  were  not  observed  to  progress  and  were  considered  reversible  in 
recovery  groups.  Further,  the  Applicant  considers  that  the  vascular/perivascular  infiltrates  may  be 
secondary to cytokine/chemokine-induced up-regulation of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules 
in the vessels of the brain and other tissues. A case of in-life neurologic abnormalities was observed in 
one animal (IV infusion of 0.2/0.8/1.0 mg/kg on Day 1/Day 2/Day 8 (Study 16-2088)), as convulsions 
were observed on Day 11 after dosing. The animal showed extensive microscopic findings compared to 
the other test animals at similar or higher dose levels. Exposure margins based on AUC and Cmax was 
calculated as 1.80 and 3.26, respectively, indicating that the effect was observed in the range of clinically 
relevant dose levels. No other neurologic abnormalities were observed in any non-clinical toxicity studies 
after chronic administration. Neurologic adverse events have been observed in the clinical trials and are 
considered potential clinical risks for mosunetuzumab treatment, which will be followed up by routine 
pharmacovigilance.  
No mosunetuzumab- or 2H7v16/40G5c-related respiratory effects were observed in the GLP single-
dose or 4-week repeated dose studies in monkeys. The NOEL for the respiratory system following a 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 30/31 
 
  
 
 
single IV infusion or SC injections of mosunetuzumab and for 2H7v16/40G5c via IV dosing for 4 weeks 
was 1 mg/kg. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Rituximab is widely used for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. To investigate potential interaction 
between the compounds, the efficacious activity of 2H7v16/40G5c to induce B-cell killing in the presence 
of rituximab-DANA (an effector-less variant of rituximab) was assessed in vitro (Study 15-0396). At a 
concentration  well  above  what  was  required  for  saturating  binding  of  CD20  antigen,  rituximab-DANA 
only  increased  the  EC50  values,  but  did  not  reduce  the  extent  of  B-cell  killing  mediated  by 
2H7v16/40G5c. The interaction with the steroid dexamethasone was investigated by pre-treating human 
PBMCs  with  concentrations  of  dexamethasone  which  could  potentially  impact  T-cell  immune  response 
and reduce in vitro cytokine production (Study 15-0396). 2H7v16/40G5c was still active in B-cell killing 
in  the  presence  of  dexamethasone  in  vitro,  however,  dexamethasone  could  greatly  reduce  T-cell 
activation and cytokine production mediated by 2H7v16/40G5c. In a 4-week study in monkeys, the effect 
of pre-treatment with either dexamethasone or rituximab on the B-cell killing activity of 2H7v16/40G5c 
was investigated. The in vivo study confirmed the findings from the in vitro study, as the onset and the 
magnitude  of  B-cell  depletion  were  similar  in  all  animals  that  maintained  2H7v16/40G5c  exposures, 
indicating  that  pre-treatment  with  dexamethasone  or  rituximab  had  no  negative  impact  on 
2H7v16/40G5c-induced B-cell depletion.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  series  of  non-clinical  single-dose  and  repeat-dose  PK/TK  studies  in  humanized  transgenic  mice  or 
cynomolgus monkeys were performed to characterize the IV and SC pharmacokinetics of 2H7v16/40G5c 
and/or mosunetuzumab. Of these, two pivotal GLP-compliant toxicity studies (Study 14-1246 and 16-
1815)  and  additional  PK  and  pilot  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  with  mosunetuzumab,  while  early 
explorative  studies  were  conducted  using  2H7v16/40G5c.  Both  mosunetuzumab  and  2H7v16/40G5c 
cross-react  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  but  not  in  rodents,  and  have  similar  in  vitro  potency  in  both 
cynomolgus  monkey  and  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells  (PBMCs).  Therefore,  cynomolgus 
monkey was selected as the appropriate animal species for assessing the PK/TK of mosunetuzumab and 
2H7v16/40G5c, which is accepted. 
The methods developed to measure mosunetuzumab and anti-mosunetuzumab antibody in cynomolgus 
monkey serum in support of the GLP pivotal toxicology studies (14-1246, 16-1815) have been suitably 
validated.  The  ELISA  method  for  detection  of  mosunetuzumab  in  cynomolgus  monkey  serum  was 
validated across a calibration range of 0.125 to 16.0 ng/mL. The accuracy and precision of the within-
run  and  between-run  values  is  acceptable  and  in  line  with  relevant  guidance  documents 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2). Furthermore, dilution integrity and minimum required 
dilution  (MRD)  as  well  as  long-term  stability  and  stability  during  freeze-thaw  cycles  was  sufficiently 
addressed. Mosunetuzumab at QC levels (12.0, 30.0 and 140.0 ng/mL) is stable after up to 6 freeze/thaw 
cycles and 24 hours at room temperature. Frozen blocked plates containing mosunetuzumab at QC levels 
are stable up to two weeks when stored at -80°C±10°C. Further, the stability of mosunetuzumab at QC 
levels in frozen matrix (-80°C±10°C) was demonstrated for up to 1003 days. Incurred sample reanalysis 
(ISR) was investigated in the GLP-compliant study (14-1246) and results were acceptable in line with 
relevant  guidance  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009  Rev.  1  Corr.  2)  for  ligand-binding  assays.  The 
validated  anti-mosunetuzumab  bridging  ELISA  assay  had  a  cut  point  factor  of  1.05  and  a  relative 
sensitivity of 214 ng/mL (assessed using a surrogate positive control affinity-purified sheep anti-human 
IgG). This assay can detect 1000 ng/mL of the surrogate positive control in the presence of up to 3.13 
µg/mL  of  mosunetuzumab.  For  both  GLP-studies  (14-1246  and  16-1815)  serum  concentrations  of 
mosunetuzumab at the time of ADA determination were below this drug tolerance threshold, except for 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 31/32 
 
  
 
 
those in the high-dose group in repeat-dose GLP-study 16-1815. However, the exposure levels did not 
seem affected in neither ADA-positive nor ADA-negative animals in this high-dose group.  
Overall, there were no significant sex-related differences observed in exposure parameters across single-
dose or repeat-dose studies using both male and female cynomolgus monkeys (14-1246, 12-3160, 16-
1815,  16-2088)  after  dosing  with  mosunetuzumab  or  2H7v16/40G5c,  and  therefore  only  combined 
exposure parameters are discussed below.  
The  bioavailability  of  mosunetuzumab  or  2H7v16/40G5c  after  an  SC  dose  of  1  mg/kg  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys was 75% and 60% after single- and repeat-dosing, respectively (study 14-1246 and 13-1689). 
Serum exposure parameters after SC dosing were reduced (72-80% for Cmax, 25-40% for AUC-values) 
compared to IV dosing. As expected, Tmax was delayed and occurred approximately 24 hours post SC-
dosing compared to IV-dosing.  
Single-dose IV/SC 
Following  IV  single-dose  administration 
to  cynomolgus  monkeys  both  2H7v16/40G5c  and 
mosunetuzumab displayed dose-dependent kinetics, however increases in exposure was not consistently 
dose-proportional,  especially  at  doses  below  0.01  mg/kg  which  could  be  attributed  to  differences  in 
impact of target-mediated clearance or ADA-formation observed at different dose levels (i.e. higher ADA-
formation  and  non-saturated  target-mediated  clearance  at  low  doses,  when  B-cell  depletion  is 
incomplete). Accordingly, clearance appeared to increase inversely with dose across single- and repeat- 
dose studies with mosunetuzumab or 2H7v16/40G5c, with clearance estimates ranging from 6.24-18.9 
ml/kg/day for animals dosed at 1 mg/kg IV, and ranging from 31.0-51.9 ml/kg/day in animals dosed 
from 0.001-0.1 mg/kg IV. Further, t1/2 of 2H7v16/40G5c was estimated to be 8.91 days after a single 
IV dose of 1 mg/kg (13-2135), and for mosunetuzumab t1/2 ranged from 4.21-5.95 days when dosed at 
0.01-0.1 mg/kg (13-2298, 17-3165). Volume of distribution (Vss) was determined from three IV single-
dose  studies  with  either  mosunetuzumab  (13-2298,  17-3165)  or  2H7v16/40G5c  (13-2135)  and  one 
repeat-dose study with 2H7v16/40G5c (13-2134) and ranged from 76.5-94.5 ml/kg in animals dosed at 
1 mg/kg and from 120-225 ml/kg in animals dosed from 0.001-0.1 mg/kg. Vss-values were greater than 
estimated serum volume of cynomolgus monkeys, most likely due to specific binding of mosunetuzumab 
to its target cells.  
Repeat-dose IV/SC studies 
A series of three initial repeat-dose studies was conducted with 2H7v16/40G5c (12-3160, 13-1689, 13-
2134).  In  an  initial  four-week  dose-range-finding  toxicity  study  with  2H7v16/40G5c  (12-3160)  in 
cynomolgus monkeys, the frequency of ADA-formation was high in low-dose groups (≤0.1 mg/kg), and 
markedly impacted serum exposure beyond the second dose. Consequently only 1/8 animals dosed ≤0.1 
mg/kg were able to maintain exposure throughout the dosing phase compared to 7/8 animals dosed 1 
mg/kg. Further, exposure was confirmed throughout the recovery phase (7 weeks) in all animals dosed 
1 mg/kg, although they progressively declined in 3 ADA-positive animals past Day 63. Serum exposure 
parameters increased with dose, and was greater than dose-proportional in the range of 0.1-1 mg/kg 
when comparing AUC0-7 where exposure profiles were least affected by ADA. Based on the high frequency 
of  ADAs  observed  ≤0.1  mg/kg  in  study  12-3160,  the  following  two  repeat-dose  studies  with 
2H7v16/40G5c (13-1689, 13-2134) incorporated only the high dose (1 mg/kg). In these two studies, 
ADA-formation  was  still  observed,  but  exposure  was  maintained  for  the  duration  of  the  studies  (four 
weeks) in the majority of animals, when dosed either IV or SC at 1 mg/kg. Across all repeat-dose studies 
conducted  with  2H7v16/40G5c,  moderate  accumulation  was  observed  after  multiple  dosing  with 
accumulation ratios ranging from 1.96-3.57 in animals dosed at 1 mg/kg, probably indicating a lesser 
impact of target-mediated clearance over time (correlating with B-cell depletion).  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 32/33 
 
  
 
 
Following the initial repeat-dose studies with 2H7v16/40G5c, a 25-day pilot repeat-dose toxicity study 
(16-2088) and a pivotal GLP 26-week toxicity study were conducted with mosunetuzumab. In the 25-
day pilot toxicity study, it was evaluated whether IV step-up dosing could minimize first dose-associated 
cytokine release and adverse events, while avoiding ADA-formation to enable long-term dosing in the 
subsequent pivotal GLP 26-week repeat-dose study (16-1815). After splitting of the 1 mg/kg dose into 
a 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg administered at Day 1 and 2, respectively, animals were dosed once-weekly at 0.3, 
1 or 3 mg/kg from day 8-22. In all animals, exposure was maintained until end of study, and although 
ADA-formation was detected in some animals, it appeared to have little impact on exposure, even in the 
low  target-dose  group  (0.3  mg/kg).  Further,  the  split-dose  approach  (16-2088  and  16-1815)  did  not 
appear  to  influence  exposure  parameters  notably  within  the  first  week  of  dosing  when  comparing  to 
single IV infusion of 1 mg/kg (14-1246). Due to convulsions in one animal dosed at 0.2/0.8/1 mg/kg on 
Days 1, 2 and once-weekly from Day 8, respectively, the maximum tolerated once-weekly target-dose 
from this study was set at 0.3 mg/kg. Consequently, similar step-up doses and regimen with reduced 
once-weekly target-doses (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) were subsequently carried forward to the GLP 26-week 
toxicity study.    
In the pivotal 26-week GLP toxicity study (16-1815), exposure was maintained in 7/7 animals in the 0.5 
mg/kg target-dose group, and in 4/7 surviving animals past TK Day 84 in the 0.1 mg/kg group. ADA 
was detected in 5 of 8 animals in Group 2 (0.1 mg/kg) and in 4 of 8 animals in Group 3 (0.5 mg/kg) 
dosed with mosunetuzumab. Exposure appeared to be lower in ADA-positive animals in Group 2 (0.1 
mg/kg), while exposure was not consistently impacted in ADA-positive animals in Group 3 (0.5 mg/kg). 
Exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased with an increase in dose from 0.1-0.5 mg/kg, and the increase was 
greater  than  dose-proportional  when  evaluated  at  steady  state  conditions  (TK  Day  175-182).  When 
comparing dose-normalized Cmax and AUC-values from TK day 0-3 (1 mg/kg) and TK day 182-185 (0.1 
or 0.5 mg/kg), exposure was shown to increase over time and was, as such, maintained throughout the 
26 weeks of the study. 
ADA-formation and impact on non-clinical exposure parameters 
Generally, across early PK/TK studies in cynomolgus monkeys, there were high frequencies and titres of 
ADA following single- and repeat-dosing of mosunetuzumab or 2H7v16/40G5c which in some animals 
affected exposure, especially at doses below 1 mg/kg where incomplete B-cell depletion was observed. 
As such, it appeared that a dose of 1 mg/kg was needed to achieve rapid and complete B-cell depletion 
in order to prevent ADA development and thereby maintain drug exposure in long-term studies. Further, 
to  mitigate  cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS)-like  acute  toxicities  associated  with  a  single  dose  of  1 
mg/kg,  a  step-up  dosing  approach  was  used  in  a  repeat-dose  pilot  study  (16-2088)  and  in  the 
subsequent GLP-compliant pivotal repeat-dose study with mosunetuzumab in cynomolgus monkeys (16-
1815).  The  step-up  dosing  approach  appeared  to  mitigate  CRS-like  acute  toxicities  and  ADA-related 
effects on exposure, and overall, it is considered acceptably established that exposure was adequately 
maintained in pivotal toxicity studies to evaluate toxicology and PD effects of mosunetuzumab, despite 
the occurrence of ADA. The drug tolerance threshold for the validated anti-mosunetuzumab assay was 
3.13 µg/mL mosunetuzumab (able to detect 1000 ng/mL ADA). Trough concentrations in the high-target 
once-weekly dose (0.5 mg/kg) in repeat-dose GLP study 16-1815 were above this threshold, however 
exposure did not seem significantly affected in neither ADA-positive nor ADA-negative animals of this 
group, and as such this is not expected to have influenced overall results.  
Interspecies  comparisons  of  human  exposure  levels  to  established  Cmax  and  AUCs  from  repeat-dose 
toxicity studies at the Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (LOAEL) are addressed in the toxicology 
section.

2.5.4.   Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.   Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity of 2H7v16/40G5c or mosunetuzumab was assessed in three studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, at doses of 0.01, 0.1, 1 mg/kg IV or 1 mg/kg SC and observation periods of 7 days, 28 days 
or 7 weeks (GLP-study, 14-1246). No test-article-related deaths were observed in any of the studies, 
and toxic findings were overall similar between studies.   
Observed  toxicities  in  GLP-study  14-1246  were  largely  attributed  to  a  dose-dependent  release  of 
cytokines which occurred 2-6 hours post-dosing and returned to baseline values at 24 hours post-dose. 
Clinical signs were limited to the 1 mg/kg dose (IV) and included emesis, reduced appetite, hypoactivity, 
watery/mucoid feces and in a few cases hypothermia. There were transient and reversible changes in 
clinical pathology, cardiovascular parameters and body temperature which were considered consistent 
with,  and  secondary  to  mosunetuzumab-induced  cytokine  release  and  acute  phase  protein  reactions. 
Microscopic  findings  were  present  in  lymphoid  tissues  (consistent  with  expected  PD  effects),  the  liver 
and  CNS.  CNS-related  findings  included  slight  to  minimal  perivascular  infiltrates  of  eosinophils  with 
associated  microgliosis  in  2 females  administered  1 mg/kg  IV  and  1 male  and  1 female  administered 
1 mg/kg SC one week after dosing. These changes were not considered adverse as they were present 
at a frequency and severity that would not be expected to result in any clinical signs, and there was no 
associated  astrocytosis  or  neuronal  changes.  Standard  neurological  examination  revealed  no  drug-
related findings. No findings were present in the CNS on Days 22 or 57 in the GLP-study. 
SC-dosing appeared to be better tolerated than IV-infusion at 1 mg/kg, with no clinical signs or 
decreases in blood pressure observed in animals dosed SC. These findings seem consistent with the 
observed decreased exposure, and delayed tmax after SC dosing, and the associated reduction and 
delay of cytokine release in this group. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Mosunetuzumab  and  2H7v16/40G5c  were  investigated  after  repeated  dosing  up  to  26  weeks  in 
cynomolgus monkeys following IV administration (slow bolus injection (½-1 min) or infusion (1h)) or SC 
injection. The main findings were acute toxicities related to cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) primarily 
attributed  to  the  first  dose,  vascular/perivascular  inflammatory  cell  infiltrates  mainly  observed  in  the 
CNS and increased susceptibility to infection following chronic dosing. All observed toxicities could be 
related to the pharmacological mode of action, namely cytokine release following T-cell activation and 
B-cell depletion. 
Microscopic findings of vascular/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates were present primarily within 
the brain but also infrequently in other organs and were observed in all the repeat dose studies at target 
dose levels from 0.1 mg/kg and above. A tendency for dose-dependency was observed with increase in 
incidence  and  severity  and  the  findings  in  the  brain  were  accompanied  with  local  microglial  reaction. 
However,  no  neuronal  degeneration  was  observed  and  the  findings  were  considered  reversible  in 
recovery  animals.  Convulsions  were  observed  in  one  animal  on  day  11  following  dosing  of  0.2/0.8/1 
mg/kg on day 1/2/8, respectively, in Study 16-2088. CNS microscopic findings were more severe in this 
animal than observed in other animals. The Applicant noted the uncertainty regarding the etiology of the 
CNS vascular/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. However, it was hypothesized that the effects 
could be secondary to cytokine/chemokine-induced up-regulation of chemokine receptors and adhesion 
molecules in the vessels of the brain and immune cell activation, margination, and transmigration. In 
the  single  dose  study,  minimal  hepatocellular  degeneration  and  single-cell  hepatocyte  necrosis  was 
observed which was associated with minimal increases in ALT/AST at 1 mg/kg while transient increases 
in ALT/AST was observed following repeated dosing. The Applicant notes that the hepatotoxic findings 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 34/35 
 
  
 
 
may be due to cytokine-mediated hepatocyte damage. Minimal activation of the coagulation system with 
increases in APTT and PT was also observed after repeated dosing at ≥0.2 mg/kg, which is furthermore 
indicated  as  a  CRS-related  acute  toxicity.  Changes  in  lymphoid  tissue  and  bone  marrow  as  well  as 
increased  susceptibility  to  infections,  as  observed  in  the  26-week  study  where  2  animals  had  to  be 
euthanized due to moribund condition, is considered to occur secondary to the pharmacological effect of 
B-cell depletion. 
To  elucidate  the  CRS-related  findings  and  observations  that  may  occur  secondary  to  CRS,  a  step-up 
dosing approach using a split of the first dose over the first two days (i.e. 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg on day 1 
and 2, respectively) was investigated with the aim to mitigate the CRS-related effects. It was found that 
step-up dosing alleviated some of the effects of CRS (i.e. hypotension) as cytokine release was reduced, 
while formation of ADA was partially mitigated, ensuring exposure in test animals. The maintenance of 
exposure in animals has been extensively discussed in the pharmacokinetic section, and it is considered 
that exposure has been sufficiently demonstrated in the repeat dose studies in spite of the ADA formation 
in cynomolgus monkeys. 
As  an  alternative  to  step-up  dosing,  SC  administration  was  investigated  in  relation  to  mitigating  CRS 
effects and ADA formation. It was shown that exposure (Cmax) was significantly reduced by 72-80% 
with a corresponding reduction in cytokine levels and T-cell activation while still maintaining depletion of 
B cells. Further, findings of CRS-related clinical signs were minimal while hypotension was not observed 
and  the  incidence  of  CNS  vascular/perivascular  findings  were  reduced.  Though  it  appears  that  SC 
administration may lead to a lesser incidence of CRS-related acute effects, note should be taken of the 
low number of animals tested, inter-animal variation and the mild degree of findings across dose groups. 
As CRS related effects were observed at all dose levels, a LOAEL was derived for all studies at the 
lowest dose levels resulting in an overall LOAEL of 0.01 mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted (see discussion on Non-clinical aspects).  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted (see discussion on Non-clinical aspects). 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Male and female fertility was investigated as part of the 26-week GLP study in cynomolgus monkeys. No 
mosunetuzumab-related findings were observed in male and female reproductive endpoints up to the 
highest dose tested (0.5 mg/kg) at exposures (AUC) similar to exposure (AUC) in patients receiving the 
recommended dose. 
In line with the ICH S9 guideline, no studies investigating the effect of mosunetuzumab on fertility and 
early  embryonic  development  (FEED)  or  pre-  and  postnatal  toxicology  (PPND)  were  performed  (see 
discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
In  order  to  perform  an  interspecies  comparison,  a  normalization  of  the  exposure  data  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys and humans were carried out. To achieve a 0-24 h corrected AUC-value, AUClast was divided 
by the duration of the study for each repeat-dose study as well as the AUC0-42d-value reported for humans 
(Study GO29781 Interim CSR report 1106874, Table 35). 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 35/36 
 
  
 
 
When applying the corrections of AUC, estimations of exposure multiples resulted in values of 0.008 to 
1.84, implying that CRS related effects and immunosuppression leading to infections occur at clinically 
relevant dose levels. The same results are approximately achieved when comparing Cmax in cynomolgus 
monkeys with humans (i.e. exposure multiples of 0.01 to 1.66). A more comprehensive discussion of 
the approach for deriving LOAELs and establishing exposure multiples has been included in the Discussion 
section in the Overview document. 
An occurrence of convulsion as well as extensive clinical findings was reported in one animal at 1 mg/kg 
in  Study  16-2088,  corresponding  to  Cmax  and  AUC0-7d  values  of  22.9  µg/ml  and  37.6  day*µg/ml.  The 
Applicant was asked to provide amended calculations of exposure multiples based on time-normalized 
AUC and  Cmax values in  animals using the clinical exposure data for CmaxCYCLE4 (7.02 µg/mL) and for 
AUC0-42  (125.7  µg/mL)  at  the  recommended  therapeutic  dosage  regimen  of  mosunetuzumab  of 
1/2/60/30 mg. For the calculated exposure margin based on AUC, the AUC values were normalized by 
their respective collection periods, yielding an average concentration of 5.37 µg/mL (37.6 µg/mL*day/7 
days) in the convulsive animal and 2.99 µg/mL (125.7 µg/mL*day/42 days) in the typical patient at the 
recommended dose. The calculated exposure margin based on AUC and Cmax is 1.80 and 3.26 (22.9 
µg/mL/7.02 µg/mL), respectively.  
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the single or repeat dose GLP studies following IV or SC 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys. No changes were observed that indicated local intolerance 
concerns. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The  formation  of  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  has  been  investigated  as  part  of  the  pharmacology  and 
toxicological studies and has been thoroughly discussed in the sections above. Overall, the interpretation 
of the data from the PD and toxicology studies are not considered to be compromised by potential ADA 
formation. No ADA formation has been observed in patients in the clinical studies. 
Mosunetuzumab exerts its pharmacological action via B-cell killing, thus inducing immunosuppression. 
This has been observed in the general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, as microscopic evidence 
of ascending urinary tract infection has been observed as well as clinical changes related to inflammation. 
The  Applicant  conducted  an  in  vitro  binding  assay  for  human  Fcγ  receptors,  where  mosunetuzumab 
showed minimal detectable binding to the Fcγ receptors tested. This is expected due to the mutation 
introduced  in  the  N297  residue  in  the  Fc  binding  region  which  results  in  aglycosylation  and  minimal 
capability  of  binding  to  effector  cells  via  this  region.  Thus,  mosunetuzumab  appears  to  have  a  low 
potential for Fcγ receptor cross-linking on immune cells leading to induction of nontargeted immune cell 
activation  (e.g.  ADCC  and  ADCP).  Further,  binding  to  C1q  was  shown  to  be  minimal  and  thus 
mosunetuzumab is not expected to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity.  
Monoclonal  antibodies  have  limited  penetration  across  the  blood-brain  barrier  due  to  the  size  of  the 
molecule.  Further,  no  evidence  of  off-target  binding  related  to  CNS  effects  have  been  observed  for 
mosunetuzumab and no evidence to suggest affected behaviour or activity patterns have been observed 
in  general 
toxicity  studies 
in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Though  histopathological 
finding  of 
perivascular/vascular  inflammatory  cell  infiltration  in  the  CNS  has  been  observed,  this  is  considered 
related  to  pharmacologically  mediated  cytokine  release,  and  the  weight  of  evidence  indicates  that 
mosunetuzumab has a low likelihood for abuse potential.

The  active  substance  and drug  product  are  generally  well  controlled  at  production  level  and potential 
process derived impurities are cleared to low levels. Thus, no impurities have been identified that are of 
toxicological concern 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Mosunetuzumab is exempted from ERA studies (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology of mosunetuzumab was thoroughly described in the provided non-clinical package. 
Mosunetuzumab showed minimal detectable binding to the Fcγ receptor tested, expectedly due to the 
mutation introduced in the N297 residue in the Fc binding region, resulting in aglycosylation and minimal 
capability  of  binding  to  effector  cells  via  this  region.  As  such,  it  appears  there  is  a  low  potential  for 
mosunetuzumab to induce nontargeted immune cell activation (e.g., ADCC and ADCP), via Fcγ receptor 
cross-linking on immune cells. Further, limited binding affinity of mosunetuzumab to C1q was shown and 
therefore, mosunetuzumab is considered of low potential to elicit activation of the complement system 
and trigger complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).    
Mosunetuzumab  is  produced  from  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cells;  the  functionally  equivalent 
antibody,  referred  to  as  2H7v16/40G5c  and  the  proof-of-concept  (POC)  molecule,  referred  to  as 
2H7v16/UCHT1v9,  were  produced  from  E.  coli.  2H7v16/40G5c  displays  the  same  properties  as 
mosunetuzumab, as it cross-reacts with CD20 and CD3 in both humans and cynomolgus monkeys, but 
not in rodents. 2H7v16/40G5c lacks the N297G substitution in the Fc region, however, as it is produced 
from E. coli it is aglycosylated. The proof -of -concept molecule, 2H7v16/UCHT1v9, is also aglycosylated. 
However, where its CD20 arm (2H7v16) is the same as for the two other molecules and therefore binds 
human and monkey CD20, its CD3 arm (UCHT1v9) is different from the two other molecules and only 
binds human CD3.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab or 2H7v16/40G5c were well-described, while extensive 
ADA formation was observed in cynomolgus monkeys.  
The design of the TK studies with varying points of measurement as well as the step-up dosing approach 
for  studies  16-2088  and  16-1815,  somewhat  complicated  the  possibility  to  compare  data  and  assess 
exposure multiples in the nonclinical studies for comparison with human exposure values. It was decided 
to derive LOAELs on basis of the findings in the nonclinical toxicology studies at the lowest tested dose 
levels, as the effects occurred at all dose levels and were considered to be relevant toxic observations, 
though  they  were  observed  as  secondary  to  pharmacological  effects  (i.e.  B-cell  depletion  and  CRS). 
These  effects  are  also  observed  in  the  clinic  and  CRS  has  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important 
identified  clinical  risk.  To  obtain  normalised  exposure  values  relevant  for  interspecies  comparison  of 
exposures (at the LOAELs derived by the assessor), AUC0-24h was derived based on normalization of the 
AUClast value (AUClast value divided by the duration of the study in days), as it was assessed that this 
normalization  would  relay  the  most  appropriate  exposure  values  in  order  to  facilitate  a  meaningful 
interpretation of exposure multiples. On the basis of the chosen approach, exposure multiples below or 
around approximately 1 were obtained for all studies indicating that the findings were observed at human 
relevant dose levels. These findings are all well-known effects in the clinic and are adequately described 
in the SmPC and have been discussed regarding human relevance in the RMP. 
An occurrence of convulsion as well as extensive clinical findings was reported in one animal at 1 mg/kg 
in  Study  16-2088,  corresponding  to  exposure  margins  based  on  AUC  and  Cmax  of  1.80  and  3.26, 
respectively. Thus, the nonclinical observation of convulsion in the animal from study 16-2088 occurs in 
the range of clinically relevant dose levels. Neurological adverse events are considered a potential risk 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 37/38 
 
  
 
 
for patients being treated with mosunetuzumab and the finding has been included correspondingly in the 
SmPC section 5.3 and the RMP Part II module SII.  
No  data  on  genotoxicity  or  carcinogenic  potential  has  been  submitted,  which  is  accepted  as 
mosunetuzumab is a biotechnology-derived product (guideline ICH S6). 
In line with the ICH S9 guideline, no studies investigating the effect of mosunetuzumab on fertility and 
early  embryonic  development  (FEED)  or  pre-  and  postnatal  toxicology  (PPND)  were  performed.  The 
Applicant submitted a waiver for not performing the embryofetal (EFD)/ enhanced (e)PPND study with 
mosunetuzumab, providing an extensive discussion of known class effects on pregnancy of anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibodies (i.e. rituximab, obinutuzumab and ocrelizumab), which have been investigated in 
(e)PPND  or  EFD  studies  as  well  as  the  observed  effects  of  mosunetuzumab  in  nonclinical  and  clinical 
studies. Common for the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies is the pharmacologic effect of B-cell depletion 
in dams and the offspring observed consistently across programs in animal studies, which was reversible 
upon drug washout.  
While it has been shown that mosunetuzumab also depletes B cells as part of the pharmacological action, 
increasing  the  incidence  of  opportunistic  infection  secondary  to  B-cell  depletion  following  long-term 
dosing, mosunetuzumab also exerts its pharmacological action via transient T-cell activation and cytokine 
release  primarily  following  the  first  dose.  As  already  discussed  above,  the  cytokine  release  results  in 
acute  adverse  reactions  such  as  vomiting,  diarrhea,  hypoactivity/hunched  posture,  hypotension, 
tachycardia,  fever,  acute  phase  protein  reactions,  leukocyte  margination,  and  minimal  liver  injury  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys,  which  may  have  a  negative  impact  during  pregnancy.  Further,  it  appears  that 
cytokines may be involved in establishing and maintaining pregnancy, thus potentially resulting in foetal 
loss  when  the  cytokine  levels  are  affected  during  the  early  period  of  pregnancy.  Taken  together,  the 
toxicities associated with T cell activation and cytokine release as well as B-cell depletion may pose a 
risk to the maintenance of early pregnancy. 
Based on the justification provided by the Applicant, and in accordance with ICH S6 (R1) it is agreed 
that no further testing is required in order to elucidate the reproductive toxicity of mosunetuzumab in 
cynomolgus monkeys, as it is not likely it will add further information to the current nonclinical and 
clinical knowledge to support the mitigation of this risk in humans. It is considered that 
mosunetuzumab should not be used during pregnancy in humans due to the identified risks, which has 
been adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3. 
Mosunetuzumab  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  environment,  as  the  proteolytic  breakdown  of 
monoclonal antibodies will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment.  
Overall, the nonclinical safety and efficacy profile seems well documented in the submitted nonclinical 
dossier, which supports the findings in the clinic. The identified nonclinical risks have been discussed 
regarding human relevance and follow-up measures in patients have been proposed as relevant. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects

2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An adequate program of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology was conducted for mosunetuzumab, including 
in  disease  models,  supporting  the  intended  clinical  use  of  mosunetuzumab.  Pharmacokinetics  of 
mosunetuzumab  and  2H7v16/40G5c  were  well  described.  Toxicology  was  investigated  sufficiently. 
Relevant information has been reflected in the SmPC.  
The active substance being a monoclonal antibody is a natural substance, the use of which will not

alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, mosunetuzumab 
is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Pharmacokinetics 
Table 2 Schedule of PK assessments in study GO29781 
The  serum  pharmacokinetics  of  mosunetuzumab  was  characterized  based  on  clinical  PK  data  from 
439 PK-evaluable  patients  from  Study GO29781  who  received  mosunetuzumab  by  IV  administration; 
specifically, 32 patients from Group A cohorts who received doses ranging from 0.05 to 2.8 mg q3w, and 
407 patients from Group B step-up dosing cohorts who received doses ranging from 0.4/1.0/2.8 mg to 
1.0/2.0/60 mg including 1.0/2.0/60/30 mg.  
The PK-evaluable population included all enrolled patients (in Groups A and B) who received at least one 
dose  of  the  study  drug  (mosunetuzumab  IV  monotherapy)  and  who  had  at  least  one  measurable  PK 
sample collected until the PK cut-off date of 4 December 2020. 
Methods 
Quantification of mosunetuzumab serum levels in clinical studies was performed using a validated ELISA 
method.  Anti-drug  antibodies  (ADAs)  to  mosunetuzumab  in  human  serum  were  determined  using  a 
validated bridging ELISA assay and a 3-tiered screening, confirmation and titer determination approach.  
Non-compartmental  methods  were  used  to  estimate  mosunetuzumab  PK  parameters  using  Phoenix 
WinNonlin.  The  population  analyses  and  simulations  were  performed  in  the  nonlinear  mixed-effects 
modeling  software  NONMEM  using  the  first-order  condition  estimation  method  with  interaction.  The 
Simcyp population-based ADME simulator was used for development of an IL-6 PBPK model.

Population PK analyses 
Population PK analysis was conducted using 7259 mosunetuzumab concentrations from 439 PK-evaluable 
patients  with  R/R  NHL  in  Study  GO29781  who  had  received  at  least  two  prior  systemic  therapies. 
Mosunetuzumab was IV administered using either a fixed q3w dose (Group A) or step-up dosing cohorts 
receiving doses ranging from 0.4/1.0/2.8 mg to 1.0/2.0/60/30 mg (Group B). The number of excluded 
samples including BLQ samples were <10% of total.  
Figure 4 Population PK model schematic 
The  final  Pop  PK  model  was  two-compartmental  with  time-varying  CL  and  additive  residual  error. IIV 
was included on all parameters except for Q. Covariates included were: sex on CLss (12.8% lower in 
female subjects) and V1 (12.6% lower in female subjects), albumin on both CLbase and V1, aCD20 drug 
concentration on CLbase and tumor burden on CLss. Body weight was included using allometric scaling 
with estimated effect on CLss, V1, and V2. Covariance was observed for CLbase-V1 and CLss-HLtrans. 
None of the significant covariates are considered to have clinically relevant effect on mosunetuzumab 
exposure (AUC0-42).

Table 3 Parameter estimates for the final PK model 
Terminal beta half-lives for the PK system were derived using the individual PK parameters of CLbase, 
Q, V1, and V2 for HLbase, and CLss, Q, V1, and V2 for HLss. Geometric mean half-lives were estimated 
to 9.64 and 16.1 days for HLbase and HLss, respectively. Thus steady-state would be achieved by Cycle 
4. Relative high inter-individual variability was observed for CLbase (CV=63%) and HLtrans (CV=86%) 
compared  with  CLss  (CV=18%),  V1  (CV=31%)  and  V2  (CV=25%).  High  shrinkage  was  observed  for 
CLss and HLtrans (34% and 41%) with minimal impact since the E-R analyses were in close agreement 
to observed data. 
Simulation-type  diagnostics,  such  as  visual  predictive  checks  (VPCs),  were  performed  to  assess  the 
model predictive performance. The model demonstrated good predictive performance with observed data 
included within the predicted 95% CIs of predictions, throughout the study.

Exposure-response methods 
The following exposure endpoints were output by the popPK model for subsequent use in the ER modeling 
of mosunetuzumab: 
•  Mosunetuzumab Area Under the Curve 
•  Mosunetuzumab Receptor Occupancy 
• 
Prior aCD20 Therapy 
•  Cycle 4 AUC, cycle 8 AUC, 
•  Cmax at Day 63, Day 84. Day 147, Day 168. 
Prior  treatment  with  aCD20  drugs  e.g.  rituximab  or  obinutuzumab  have  confounding  effects  on 
mosunetuzumab exposure/RO due to a high affinity for the CD20 binding site. Exposure metrics intended

for evaluation of E-R relations were generated using EBEs from the final Pop PK model with aCD20 drug 
concentration included as a significant covariate of mosunetuzumab clearance.

AUC0-42 was the main exposure metric used for investigation of E-R for efficacy measures, CR and OR 
using logistic regression modelling with an Emax function. A linear logistic model was used to describe 
cytokine release syndrome E-R analysis with ROmax as the exposure endpoint. Kaplan-Meier time-to-
event plots with AUC0-42 exposure tertiles were used to describe other safety time-to-events.

PBPK modelling 
An IL-6 PBPK model was built using observed IL-6 data following mosunetuzumab administration from 
study GO29781 to assess the magnitude of potential CYP3A4 suppression caused by cytokines.

Figure 10 Simulated and observed mean IL-6 plasma concentration at the observed mean level and 
95th percentile level for sensitivity analysis  
The magnitude of DDI was simulated using two substrates, midazolam and simvastatin, and evaluated 
at C1D15 where the CYP3A4 suppression was largest following the proposed dose regimen. Assuming 
the inhibitory impact on CYP3A4 activity was similar in the gut and liver, in contrast to liver only, did not 
have  a  major  impact  on  the  substrate  exposure.  A  sensitivity  test  was  conducted  assuming  a  5-fold 
higher mean IL-6 level than observed in Study GO29781 close to the observed 95th percentile level. The 
result of the sensitivity testing indicated that mosunetuzumab induced CRS may have a mild inhibitory 
effect on CYP3A4 at 5-times the mean observed IL-6 level (<two-fold increase in AUC). The conclusions 
are further discussed under drug-drug interactions. 
ADME properties 
Absorption  
The drug product is administered intravenously. 
Non-compartmental analyses indicate that mosunetuzumab serum concentration reaches the maximal 
level (Cmax) at the end of the IV infusion.  
In group A a moderate to high PK parameter variability was observed (% coefficient of variation [%CV] 
for  the  first-cycle  AUC  and  Cmax  ranged  from  approximately  20%  to  120%).  In  Group  B  (step-up 
escalation) the total Cycle 1 mosunetuzumab exposure AUC0-21 increased as the total amount of the 
three  mosunetuzumab  dose  in  Cycle  1  in  each  dose  group  increased,  ranging  from 2.8  day∙
g/mL  to 
50.2 day∙
g/mL. 
⎧
Two formulations have been used during clinical development: F01 and F02. The F01 formulation was 
⎧
used for initial clinical studies. The F02 formulation was used for subsequent clinical studies, including 
the  B11  RP2D  cohort  and  is  the  intended  commercial  formulation.    No  formal  bioequivalence  studies 
have been performed. 
No  dedicated  food-interaction  studies  have  been  performed  as  mosunetuzumab  is  administered 
intravenously, and therefore no food effect would be expected with parenteral administration.

Study GO29781 
A total of 33 patients enrolled in Group A received mosunetuzumab IV q3w treatment with the dosing 
range 0.05-2.8 mg. Of these, 32 patients were included in the PK analysis. All data for the only patient 
at the 0.05 mg dose group were below the assay lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 10 ng/mL. The 
summary of PK parameters is provided in the table below:

Distribution 
The serum concentration-time data was best described by a two-compartment popPK model. The 
central volume of distribution of 5.49 L is larger than plasma volume, suggesting the potential impact 
of binding to immediately accessible targets following IV administration of mosunetuzumab. Following 
Administration as IV Monotherapy in Non-Fractionated Dose Escalation Cohorts in Group A, the Vss (L) 
is in the range of 6.69 to 15.5L (+-11.7 L).  
As mosunetuzumab is an antibody, protein binding studies were not conducted.  
Elimination 
Mosunetuzumab is a full-length IgG1 bispecific monoclonal antibody metabolized to peptides and amino 
acids  by  circulating  phagocytic  cells  or  by  their  target  antigen-containing  cells.  Neither  hepatic 
metabolism  nor  renal  excretion  are  considered  as  major  elimination  routes.  Accordingly,  no  active 
metabolites are expected. 
The serum concentration-time data was well-described by a popPK model with two-compartment and 
time-dependent clearance (CL), which was parameterized as an initial baseline clearance (CLbase ~ 1.08 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 49/50 
 
  
 
 
 
L/day) which transitions over time to a steady state clearance (CLSS ~ 0.584 L/day). The apparent half-
life (t1/2) is approximately 3 to 10 days. The terminal half-life estimate was 16.1 days at steady state 
based on population PK (popPK) model simulations.   
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Mosunetuzumab exhibits linear and dose-proportional PK in the dose range studied (0.2−60 mg) and in 
the clinically active dose range (≥1.2 mg).   
In Group A, a moderate to high PK parameter variability was observed in that the % coefficient of 
variation for the first-cycle Cmax, which ranged from approximately 20% to 120%;

Following  two  cycles  (i.e.,  42  days)  of  the  RP2D  dose  of  1/2/60/30 mg,  the  mosunetuzumab  serum 
concentration reaches the Cmax at the end of Cycle 2 Day 1 of the mosunetuzumab IV infusion with an 
average maximal concentration of 17.9 
g/mL and %CV of 49.6%.  The average total two Cycles (42 
days) mosunetuzumab exposure AUC was 246 day∙

Concentration- and/or time-dependency in pharmacokinetics were evaluated and compared using POP 
PK  analysis,  as  plots  of  dose-normalized  (using  nominal  dose  level)  concentration  against  time  after 
dose, stratified by treatment cohort. There was no evidence of dose nonlinearity in low doses.  
Overall, the time dependency of mosunetuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and accumulation patterns were 
well  characterized  by  the  popPK  model.  Mosunetuzumab  behaves  like  a  typical  IgG1  monoclonal 
antibody, and steady state exposure is achieved by ~Cycle 4.  
Mosunetuzumab exhibits linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in the dose range studied (0.2 
to 60 mg) and in the clinically active dose range (≥1.2 mg). Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) 
was tested in the popPK model, but the results did not indicate improvement in descriptions of the data 
over simpler linear models, either with or without time-dependent clearance approaches.

Intra-individual variability 
No information provided. 
Inter-individual variability  
Moderate to high inter-individual variability (IIV) was observed for mosunetuzumab key PK parameters 
(range from 18% to 86%). 
In the population PK analysis, relative high inter-individual variability was observed for CLbase (CV=63%) 
and HLtrans (CV=86%) compared with CLss (CV=18%), V1 (CV=31%) and V2 (CV=25%). 
No  information  is  provided  on  intra-individual  variability.  Overall,  the  inter-individual  variability  of 
mosunetuzumab PK parameters is moderate to high, which is consistent with other mAbs. 
Target population 
The pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab was not evaluated in healthy volunteers as mosunetuzumab 
was developed primarily for oncology indications.  
There  was  no  dedicated  clinical  study  for  mosunetuzumab  patient  PK  and  tolerability.  Evaluation  of 
mosunetuzumab patient PK and initial tolerability was included in study GO29781 which is a phase I/Ib 
dose-escalation and dose-expansion study in patients with R/R hematologic malignancies expected to 
express CD20, including B-cell NHL and CLL.

Renal impairment 
Mosunetuzumab is a full-length IgG1 bispecific monoclonal antibody, and the Applicant states that the 
PK is not expected to be impacted by renal impairment. A tendency towards increased AUC in patients 
with moderate and severe renal impairment is observed (see figure below).

Hepatic impairment 
Mosunetuzumab  is  a  full-length  IgG1  bispecific  monoclonal  antibody.  The  PK  is  not  expected  to  be 
impacted by hepatic impairment, as confirmed by the popPK modeling assessment.  
Mosunetuzumab has not been investigated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and the data from 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment are very sparse (n=2).

Figure 17: Comparison of Mosunetusumab PK exposure (i.e., AUC0-42) at the clinical dose of 
1/2/60/30 mg with different hepatic function (study GO29781)  
Gender 
The Applicant states that PopPK modeling based on Study GO29781 in 284 men (64.7%) and 155 women 
(35.3%)  indicate  no  clinical  meaningful  effect  of  gender  on  mosunetuzumab  PK.  However,  significant 
baseline covariate effects include sex on CLss and V1 i.e. AUC0-42 for a typical female patient (weighing 
78 kg) is approximately 6% higher than a typical male patient.  
Race 
PopPK modeling based on Study GO29781 indicate no statistically significant effect of race (Asian vs. 
Non-Asian) on mosunetuzumab PK.  
The  Applicant  has  provided  figures  on  Eta  distribution  on  Cl(base),  V1  and  Cl(ss)  from  the  Pop  PK 
analysis.  The  demographic  information  for  capturing  study  participant  race  on  GO29781  included  the 
following  options:  “American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native”;  “Asian”;  “Black  or  African  American”;  “Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander”; “White”; “Unknown.”  The following options were used by sites for 
recording  study  participant  ethnicity:  “Hispanic  or  Latino”;  “Not  Hispanic  or  Latino”;  “Not  reported”; 
“Unknown.”  Based on the visual inspection of plots for individual values of random effects (i.e., ETA) 
stratified  by  these  categories,  there  were  no  apparent  ethnic  differences  with  respect  to  key 
mosunetuzumab PK parameters, including the baseline clearance (CLbase), central volume of distribution 
(V1), and steady-state clearance (CLss).  Note, that the low sample sizes for “American Indian/Alaskan 
Native” (N=2) and “Black” (N=12) categories precluded these groups from robust assessments, either 
visually by stratified ETA plots, or formally in the covariate analysis. 
The formal popPK covariate analyses tested “Asian” (N=77) versus “Non-Asian” (N=362) as a potential 
factor  impacting  PK;  results  indicated  no  significant  differences  in  mosunetuzumab  PK  by  these 
EMA/390815/2022

categories.  However,  it  is  noted  that  the  overall  body  weight  distribution  is  lower  in  Asian  patients 
compared to the Non-Asian patients – median [95% percentile] body weight for Asian patients of 65.7 
[42.4-86.5] kg  and  80.4  [49.8-121] kg  for  Non-Asian  patients.  Hence,  the  slightly  higher  exposure 
(AUC0-42) difference comparing Asian versus non-Asian participants is considered to be attributable to 
differences in body weight between the two groups and not ethnic-related differences in mosunetuzumab 
PK disposition. Body weight was identified as a statistically significant covariate and included in the final 
popPK model.  
Figure 18 Comparison of AUC0-42 across race in PK-evaluable study participants  
Body weight 
Significant baseline covariate effects include bodyweight on CLss, V1 and V2. The model covariates are 
judged not to have a meaningful effect if the impact of extreme, or categorical, values fall within 0.80-
1.25 -fold change from the reference.

Histology 
The  effect  of  NHL  histology  on  mosunetuzumab  pharmacokinetics  was  investigated  as  a  categorical 
covariate  (DLBCL,  FL,  and  others)  in  the  popPK  model  based  on  patients  in  Study  GO29781.    The 
Applicant  states  that  NHL  histology  had  no  statistically  significant  impact  on  the  mosunetuzumab 
pharmacokinetics parameters.

No clinical DDI studies have been conducted with mosunetuzumab.  
Classical drug-drug interactions that occur through effects on enzyme systems such as the cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) system are not expected for monoclonal antibodies (Keizer et al. 2010). In several specifically 
designed clinical trials, no relevant influence of monoclonal antibodies on metabolism of co-medication 
has been shown, confirming the general principle that pharmacokinetic interactions are generally not to 
be expected with monoclonal antibody co-treatment (Keizer et al. 2010; Ettlinger et al. 2006; Gaudreault 
et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2008; Zinner et al. 2004). Since the vast majority of immunoglobulin is eliminated 
by catabolism (Wang et al. 2008), monoclonal antibodies are presumably not substrates for CYP enzymes 
or drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein. In many cases, IgG elimination is driven primarily by affinity 
for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) receptor, and the nature of and affinity for the specific target of the 
antibody. Accordingly, inhibitors or inducers of CYP, or of transporters such as P-glycoprotein, are not 
expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab, as a victim of DDIs. Therefore, no direct 
victim  or  perpetrator  based  DDIs  are  anticipated  for  mosunetuzumab  from  monoclonal  antibodies’ 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion perspective.  
Study  GO29781  has  shown  that  treatment  with  mosunetuzumab  results  in  transient  elevations  of 
cytokines including IL-6, the key cytokine associated with CYP enzyme suppression in humans (Xu et al. 
2015;  Haas  et  al.  2003;  Lee  et  al.  2010;  Nakai  et  al.  2008).  The  systemic  elevation  associated  with 
mosunetuzumab  treatment  appears  to  be  primarily  a  first  cycle  effect,  and  IL-6  concentration  peaks 
following the Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15 doses with no changes from baseline in later cycles (Figure 24). 
Importantly, the cytokine elevation was mitigated by the use of the Cycle 1 step up dosing regimen, as 
implemented in Group B and for the proposed dose intended for registration of 1/2/60/30 mg. The mean 
observed  IL-6  peak  concentrations  at  C1D1,  C1D8,  and  C1D15  are  152,  52.7  and  160  pg/mL, 
respectively, based on n=212 patients in B11 who received 1, 2, and 60 mg on Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, and 
15. 
PBPK model 
A PBPK model was developed to assess the potential DDI risk for mosunetuzumab due to the transient 
IL-6  elevation.  Other  than  IL-6,  mosunetuzumab  does  not  meaningfully  elevate  the  systemic  level  of 
other  proinflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  IFN-γ,  IL-2,  TNF-〈,  which  have  been  reported  to  alter  CYP 
enzyme expression or activity (Huang et al. 2010). 
Physiologically  based  pharmacokinetics  (PBPK)  modelling  and  simulations  based  on  IL-6  and  CYP3A4 
interaction indicated low risk of cytokine-mediated drug-drug interaction potential for mosunetuzumab.   
Table 6 Predicted DDI between Mosunetuzumab and Sensitive CYP3A Substrate Midazolam 
Caused by Transient IL-6 Elevation during Mosunetuzumab Treatment 
The PBPK model is considered of high impact since it is used to replace a dedicated DDI study. The most 
important  issue  foreseen  with  the  proposed  PBPK  modelling  are  related  to  (1)  the  modelling  of  time 
course of IL-6 concentrations and (2) the verification the appropriateness of in-vitro in vivo extrapolation 
of the suppressive effects of IL-6 on CYP3A activity based on in vitro parameters from the literature. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 59/60 
 
  
 
 
 
The IL-6 levels were modelled using a PK top-down approach calibrated with in house clinical data from 
study  GO29781.  In  addition,  a  hypothetical  dose  was  used  to  force  the  model  to  fit  the  observed 
concentrations.  
The  graphical  figures  of  simulated  vs  observed  interleukin-6  (IL-6)  concentrations,  midazolam  and 
simvastatin for Schmitt et al. (2011) and Zhuang et al. (2015) study data have been presented by the 
applicant.  For  IL-6  -  midazolam  (MDZ)  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  prediction  by  the  physiologically-
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model described in the report, a single 5 mg oral dose of MDZ was used 
while 0.03 mg/kg was stated in the reference. To provide simulated vs. observed MDZ pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile as in the reference, additional DDI simulations using 0.03 mg/kg MDZ with IL-6 at 50 pg/mL 
and  100  pg/mL  were  conducted.  The  predicted  DDI,  expressed  as  MDZ  exposure  (maximum  serum 
concentration [Cmax] and area under concentration time curve [AUC]) ratio, was similar at 0.03 mg/kg 
MDZ dose versus the 5 mg MDZ dose.  
The figures demonstrate that both observed simvastatin and MDZ PK in the presence and absence of IL-
6 are described reasonably well by the PBPK simulations.

2.6.2.2.   Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of mosunetuzumab involves recruitment of effector T-cells via CD3 to engage 
with target CD20-expressing B cells, leading to T-cell activation (independent of TCR epitope specificity) 
and T-cell mediated B cell cytolysis. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Exposure-response  relationships  for  safety  were  assessed  based  on  439 patients  receiving  IV 
administration of mosunetuzumab from Study GO29781; specifically, 32 patients from Group A cohorts 
receiving doses ranging from 0.05 to 2.8 mg q3w, and 407 patients from Group B step-up dosing cohorts 
receiving doses ranging from 0.4/1.0/2.8 mg to 1.0/2.0/60/30 mg. 
Exposure-Response Analyses for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
Grade ≥2 CRS was identified as an exposure- and regimen- dependent AE where the administration of 
mosunetuzumab following the step-up dosing regimen was associated with a low frequency but ROmax-
dependent increase of Grade ≥2 CRS transiently during Cycle 1 following the 60 mg dose administration 
on Day 15. 
Dosing  of  mosunetuzumab  following  the  step-up  dosing  regimen  was  associated  with  a  relatively  low 
frequency of Grade ≥2 CRS transiently during Cycle 1 following the 60 mg dose administration on Day 
15.  Higher  receptor  occupancy  values  increase  the  rate  of  Grade  ≥2  CRS.  Cycle  1  step-up  dosing 
schedule mitigated the acute CRS risks, and the frequency of Grade ≥3 CRS was less than 3% at the 
RP2D/intended registration dose and schedule of 1/2/60/30 mg.

The safety cohort on which the E-R analyses were based was large, however it should be noticed that 
for  20  subjects,  RO  was  not  evaluable,  and  that  also  for  E-R  analyses  for  the  other  grade  ≥3  AEs, 
analyses were based on a lower number of subjects, only including subjects from Group B step-up dosing 
cohorts, as subjects from Group A, which received a much lower dose exposure, were not included in 
order to better assess safety under the proposed step-up dose regimen.

Exposure-Response Analyses for Neurologic Adverse Events (NAEs) 
The logistic regression ER analyses indicate a slightly positive ER slope for increased NAE (broadly defined 
as all AEs reported as primary or secondary PTs in either the SOC of Nervous System Disorders or SOC 
of  Psychiatric  Disorders)  frequency  that  occurs  with  AUC0-42  and  ROmax0-42  metrics  (p>0.05).    This 
directional trend is consistent with directional trends in Kaplan-Meier analyses, conducted by tertiles of 
exposure, demonstrating a visual separation occurring near the timing of the higher 60 mg loading dose; 
however,  overall  log-rank  tests  for  time-to-event  analyses  show  non-significant  p-values  in  range  of 
~0.3.  The overall effect size of the trend appears small with ~10% difference in NAE incidence observed 
between the lowest and highest tertile of exposure.  Note, 61% (130/213) B11 patients' AUC belongs to 
3rd tertile, 28% (60/213) B11 patients' AUC belongs to 2nd tertile, and 11% (28/213) B11 patients' AUC 
belongs to 1st tertile.  A flat ER relationship for NAE was observed following the Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) 
doses of 0.05 to 2.8 mg when mosunetuzumab was administered as fixed q3w doses (i.e., Group A).

Exposure-Response Analyses for Selected Grade ≥3 Adverse Events 
Dosing  of  mosunetuzumab  following  the  step-up  dosing  regimen  did  not  lead  to  exposure-dependent 
increases for Grade ≥3 neutropenia, Grade ≥3 infections or infestations, or all Grade ≥3 adverse events 
(AEs).  Higher  mosunetuzumab  exposure  did  not  appear  to  lead  to  an  earlier  onset  of  Grade ≥3 
neutropenia, Grade ≥3 infections or infestations, or all Grade ≥3 AEs (see below).

Immunogenicity 
As of the anti-drug antibodies (ADA) data cutoff date of 4 December 2020, there was no ADA detected 
in  418  ADA  evaluable  patients  who  received  mosunetuzumab  single-agent  IV  treatments  in 
Study GO29781.  
QT/QTc Prolongation Potential 
No  formal  QT/QTc  studies  were  performed.  The  Applicant  states  that  there  is  a  low  risk  for 
mosunetuzumab to cause QT/QTc prolongation as mosunetuzumab is not expected to interact directly 
with the hERG channel.  
Drug-Drug Interaction through Effect on Pharmacodynamics 
For  patients  with  R/R  FL,  clinical  data  to  date  from  Study  GO29781  suggest  low  risk  for  clinically 
meaningful DDI through competition of CD20 target engagement with obinutuzumab (G) or rituximab 
(R). The residual concentrations of baseline G or R were low (median value is below quantitation limit 
where BQL = 0.5 
g/mL and 0.00405 
g/mL for R and G PK assays, respectively). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
⎧
⎧
The E-R relationships for efficacy were characterized based on INV-assessed clinical objective response 
data from 159 patients with R/R FL who received ≥2 prior therapies and treated with IV administration 
of mosunetuzumab in Study GO29781. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 69/70 
 
  
 
 
 
The  results  presented  on  E-R  modelling  of  CR  and  OR  show  that  most  model  parameters  are  poorly 
estimated  with  very  high  values  of  RSE.  The  modelling  and  simulation  results  should  therefore  be 
interpreted with caution. 
The  E-R  analyses  indicate  that  clinical  responses  (CR  rate  and  ORR)  increase  with  increasing 
mosunetuzumab  exposure  (AUC0-42)  and  approach  a  plateau  estimated  by  the  model  as  the  maximal 
clinical responses of 63.7% and 81.4% for CR rate and ORR, respectively.  
The results indicated that ER curves shift to the right (with an increasing E90) as baseline tumor size in 
patients  increases.    Furthermore,  the  clinical  response  was  lower  in  the  subset  of  patients  who  had 
residual  aCD20  concentrations  at  baseline.    The  clinical  dose  of  1/2/60/30 mg  achieved  average  PK 
exposure (AUC0-42) at or near the plateau of the ER curves, except for the 5% of patients at the highest 
95th percentile of baseline tumor SPD (10816 mm2 or square root of baseline tumor SPD equal to 104 
mm).  
Based on the 15 March CCOD, the finding of the covariate analysis for efficacy E-R (CRR) with regard to 
lower  clinical  response  in  the  subset  of  patients  who  had  residual  aCD20  concentrations  at  baseline 
seems  to  be  confirmed  by  efficacy  subgroup  analyses  in  the  B11  FL  RP2D  Expansion  Cohort,  which 
suggest that subjects with 3 months or less time since last anti-CD20 therapy (n = 23) had particular 
less favourable CRR and ORR (35% [95% CI: 16%, 57%]) and 65% [95% CI: 43%, 84%], respectively) 
compared to subjects with more than 3 months since last anti-CD20 therapy (n = 67; CRR = 66% [95% 
CI: 53%; 77%]).  
Clinical  response  increases  in  an  exposure-dependent  manner  and  plateaus  at  the  AUC0–42  values  of 
approximately  72.1  and  38.4 day*µg/mL  corresponding  to  the  estimated  E90  for  CRR  and  ORR, 
respectively.

Exposure-efficacy 
Based  on  15  March  2021  CCOD,  at  the  proposed  registration  dose  and  schedule  of  1/2/60/30  mg, 
mosunetuzumab IV monotherapy showed IRF-assessed CR rate of 57.8% (95% CI: 46.9, 68.1) and ORR 
of 78.9% (95% CI: 69.0, 86.8) with associated durability. The proposed registration dose and schedule 
of 1/2/60/30 mg was predicted to achieve PK exposures at the plateau of the ER curves for CRR and 
ORR. 
Exposure-safety 
Grade ≥2 CRS was identified as an exposure- and regimen- dependent AE where the administration of 
mosunetuzumab following the step-up dosing regimen was associated with a  relatively low frequency 
but  ROmax-dependent  increase  of  Grade ≥2  CRS  transiently  during  Cycle 1  following  the  60 mg  dose

• 
Post-baseline B-cell depletion: 
Per  Applicant’s  analysis,  B-cell  depletion  was  defined  as  a  CD19  measurement  of  <70  counts/µL  that 
occurred  after  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug  administration.  Time  to  depletion  was  defined  as  the 
number of cycles between the first intake of study drug at baseline and the date of the first depletion. 
B-cell recovery was defined as a CD19 measurement of ≥70/µL, for which the patient’s previous CD19 
measurement revealed B-cell depletion. B-cell recovery was considered possible only after the patient 
had completed study treatment. 
Of the 152 evaluable patients in the B11 RP2D cohort who had a baseline sample and at least one follow-
up sample to assess B-cell counts, a majority of patients (110/152; 72.4%) enrolled with B-cell counts 
below 70 cells/µL. This is likely reflective of prior anti-CD20 therapy in R/R NHL patients. By Cycle 2 Day 
1 treatment with mosunetuzumab IV monotherapy, 135/139 (97.1%) patients had CD19+ B-cell counts 
<70 cells/µL and by Cycle 8, Day 1, 102 out of 102 patients (100%) had B-cell counts <70 cells/µL. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 75/76 
 
  
 
 
 
 
At the time of the updated CCOD (27 August 2021), only 18 patients had follow-on samples available 
for  analysis  and  B-cell  counts.  B-cell  counts  remained  depleted  in  all  18  patients  at  3  months  post-
treatment and had recovered in only one patient with prior B-cell depletion at 6 months post-treatment. 
Limited data of an additional 32 patients with B-cell recovery data at time points later than 6 months 
after treatment completion, including 2 patients with data for more than one follow-up visit, suggest an 
increase in B-cell recovery at later timepoints, consistent with the time to recovery for other anti-CD20 
therapies. 
• 
Post-baseline IgG level: 
At the time of the updated CCOD (27 August 2021), of the 105 evaluable patients in the B11 RP2D cohort 
who had a baseline IgG measurement and at least one post-baseline IgG measurement, a total of 38 
patients enrolled with IgG levels <5 g/L, while the remaining 67 patients had baseline IgG levels ≥5 g/L. 
Among patients with baseline IgG levels <5 g/L, a majority (30/38 patients; 78.9%) maintained their 
post-baseline IgG levels <5 g/L. Among patients with baseline IgG levels ≥5 g/L, a greater proportion 
of  patients  maintained  their  post-baseline  IgG  levels  ≥5  g/L,  while  the  remaining  patients  (27/67; 
40.3%)  had  depletions  in  their  IgG  values  post  treatment  with  mosunetuzumab  IV  monotherapy  to 
values <5 g/L. 
● 
Hypogammaglobulinemia: 
As of CCOD 27 August 2021, hypogammaglobinemia was reported in 9 of 414 patients (2.2%) in Group B 
and 7 of 218 patients (3.2%) in B11 recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) cohort.  All the events were 
Grade 1-2.    All  the  events  were  non-serious.    Immunoglobulin  decreased  was  reported  in  1 patient 
(0.2%)  in  B11  RP2D  cohort.    The  event  was  Grade  1  and  non-serious.    The  onset  date  of 
hypogammaglobinemia or immunoglobulin decreased events ranged from 17-563 days.  Seven patients 
with  hypogammaglobinemia  or  immunoglobulin  decreased  from  Group B  received  treatment  with 
immunoglobulin and 5 patients recovered.  The duration of the resolved events ranged from 0-55 days.  
Infections  with  concurrent  hypogammaglobinemia  or  Immunoglobulin  decreased  (infections  events 
occurred within 30 days of hypogammaglobinemia/Immunoglobulin decreased) occurred in 3 patients.  
Except  for  1 Grade 3  serious  lower  respiratory  tract  infection,  all  other  events  were  Grade 1-2,  non-
serious.  Infections were also observed in patients without hypogammaglobinemia or immunoglobulin 
decreased.  The  frequency  of  infections  concurrent  with  hypogammaglobinemia/Immunoglobulin 
decreased  was  lower  than  the  frequency  of  infections  observed  in  the  whole  population  of  Group  B 
(11.1% in Group B as of CCOD 27 August 2021).  Therefore, the clinical safety data did not suggest that 
hypogammaglobinemia/immunoglobulin decreased contributed to increased risk of infections or serious 
infections. 
No hypogammaglobinemia or immunoglobulin decreased events were reported in Group A. 
After  mosunetuzumab  initiation,  25 patients  (6.0%)  in  Group  B  received  immune  globulin  as  a 
concomitant medication.  In 15 patients (3.6%), this was for the treatment of hypogammaglobinemia, 
low hypogammaglobinemia or low IgG, including 2 patients concurrent with infections.  In 6 patients, 
immune  globulin  were  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  infections  or  infections  prophylaxis.    Other 
indications  for  immune  globulin  included  disease  related  immune  deficiency,  pre-medication  of 
leukapheresis, infusion related reaction, and supplement, reported in one patient, respectively. 
● 
Intratumoral CD20: 
Correlation analyses between CD20 expression level and PK and efficacy outcomes did not show a clear 
relationship, nor in terms of response rates (similar range of CD20+ staining for both responders and 
non-responders),  nor  in  terms  of  duration  of  response  (3/4  patients  with  ≤50%  CD20+  staining  had 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 76/77 
 
  
 
 
durable responses), nor in terms of exposure (similar ranges of exposure in patients with lower CD20 
expression levels). 
● 
Cytokine levels: 
Only  IL-6  and  INFγ  were  cytokines  that  were  measured  in  all  cohorts,  including  the  Group  B  step-up 
dosing cohorts. The PD profiles of IL-6 and INFγ were similar and were for the step-up dosing Cohort 
Group B characterized by an acute and transient elevation, predominantly limited to the first cycle of 
treatment, despite the continued accumulation in the serum of mosunetuzumab.  In general, no changes 
from baseline were observed in later cycles. It is likely that this initial acute transient elevation in cytokine 
levels reflects the initial target engagement and is associated with an acute clinical safety profile (e.g., 
CRS).

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
ELISA based methods were used for the bioanalysis and for ADA determination.  
To ensure detection of 100 ng/mL positive control ADA, drug concentrations should be ≤1 µg/mL. Most 
samples taken for ADA evaluation had a drug concentration >1 µg/mL.  
Two  mouse  anti-idiotypic  antibodies  against  the  anti-CD3  (PC1)  and  anti  CD20  (PC2)  portion  of 
mosunetuzumab were used as positive controls in the ADA assay. 100 ng/mL PC1 remained positive at 
5.00 µg/mL of mosunetuzumab while 100 ng/mL PC2 was positive at 1.00 µg/mL and negative at 5.00 
µg/mL  of  mosunetuzumab.  99%  of  samples  had  mosunetuzumab  levels  <5.00  µg/mL.  The  drug 
tolerance  of  ADAs  raised  against  the  anti-CD3  part  of  mosunetuzumab  is  adequate  as  tested  by  the 
mouse  surrogate  marker  PC1.  The  drug  tolerance  of  ADAs  raised  against  the  anti-CD20  part  of 
mosunetuzumab  is  less  good.  However,  ~50%  samples  had  mosunetuzumab  levels  <1.00  µg/mL 
(reported  DT  of  PC2)  and  78%  samples had  mosunetuzumab  <2.12  µg/mL.  Therefore,  the  impact  of 
potential false negatives against the anti-CD20 is considered low and a new assay will not be requested.  
Interference of previous monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments (including rituximab, obinutuzumab and 
polatuzumab vedotin) in screening and confirmatory mosunetuzumab anti-drug antibodies (ADA) assays 
were evaluated and no interference was observed. 
No neutralising antibody assay was developed because minimal immunogenicity responses are expected. 
Population PK analysis 
Population PK analysis was conducted on data from 439 PK evaluable patients in Study GO29781. The 
final model was 2-compartmental with time-varying CL and allometric scaled weight effect. The model 
demonstrated good predictive performance and is adequate for the intended purpose.  The conclusion 
related to the lack of clinical relevance of the covariate tested are endorsed. 
ADME 
There have been no dedicated clinical biopharmaceutic studies for mosunetuzumab to support the MA, 
because  mosunetuzumab  is  administered  intravenously  and  no  food  effect  would  be  expected  with 
parenteral administration. 
The  serum  concentration-time  data  was  best  described  by  a  two-compartmental  popPK  model  and  a 
time-dependent clearance. The central volume of distribution of 5.49 L is larger than plasma volume, 
suggesting the potential impact of binding to immediately accessible targets following IV administration 
of mosunetuzumab. The apparent half-life (t1/2) was approximately 3 to 10 days. The terminal half-life 
estimate was 16.1 days at steady state based on population PK (popPK) model simulations.  
Monoclonal antibodies are metabolized to peptides and amino acids in several tissues. The liver is not 
considered the major clearance organ for IgG, as well as renal excretion is not considered as a major 
elimination pathway.  
Overall, the time dependency of mosunetuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) and accumulation patterns were 
well  characterized  by  the  popPK  model.  Mosunetuzumab  behaves  like  a  typical  IgG1  monoclonal 
antibody,  and  steady  state  exposure  is  achieved  by  ~Cycle  4.  The  overall  pharmacokinetic  (PK) 
disposition  and  accumulation  patterns  of  mosunetuzumab  are  still  consistent  with  that  of  other 
monoclonal  antibody 
therapeutics.  Mosunetuzumab  exhibits 
linear  and  dose-proportional 
pharmacokinetics in the dose range studied (0.2 to 60 mg) and in the clinically active dose range (≥1.2 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 78/79 
 
  
 
 
 
mg). Target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) was tested in the popPK model, but the results did not 
indicate improvement in descriptions of the data over simpler linear models, either with or without time-
dependent clearance approaches. A moderate to high inter-individual variability (IIV) was observed for 
mosunetuzumab key PK parameters (range from 18% to 86%).  
Special populations 
No  clinically  meaningful  baseline  covariates  were  found  for  mosunetuzumab  PK  requiring  dose 
modifications  
Based on exposure-response analysis and clinical exposure margins, no dose adjustment is required due 
to patient bodyweight.   
No dose adjustment of Lunsumio is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Lunsumio has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments are not 
considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment based on pharmacokinetics 
(see section 5.2). 
Lunsumio has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments are not 
considered necessary based on pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). 
Drug-drug interactions 
No clinical DDI studies have been conducted with mosunetuzumab.  
A PBPK model for IL-6 was built using a top-down approach based on a modified literature model and 
used to assess the magnitude of potential CYP3A4 suppression caused by cytokines. Clinical IL-6 data 
from study GO29781 were used to optimise/build the PBPK model and also to verify the simulations of 
IL-6 profiles following mosunetuzumab 1/2/60 mg dosing.  
Graphical  figures  of  simulated  vs  observed  interleukin-6  (IL-6)  concentrations,  midazolam  and 
simvastatin for Schmitt et al. (2011) and Zhuang et al. (2015) study data were presented. For IL-6 - 
midazolam (MDZ) drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction by the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) model described in the report, a single 5 mg oral dose of MDZ was used while 0.03 mg/kg was 
stated in the reference. To provide simulated vs. observed MDZ pharmacokinetic (PK) profile as in the 
reference, additional DDI simulations using 0.03 mg/kg MDZ with IL-6 at 50 pg/mL and 100 pg/mL were 
conducted. The predicted DDI, expressed as MDZ exposure (maximum serum concentration [Cmax] and 
area under concentration time curve [AUC]) ratio, was similar at 0.03 mg/kg MDZ dose versus the 5 mg 
MDZ dose. Both observed simvastatin and MDZ PK in the presence and absence of IL-6 are described 
reasonably well by the PBPK simulations. However, the modelling platform is not considered adequately 
qualified for prediction of CYP3A4 interactions according to the PBPK guideline.   
No dose adjustment for mosunetuzumab is recommended when co-dosing mosunetuzumab with small 
molecule drugs which are CYP3A substrates. However, a clinically relevant effect on CYP450 substrates 
with  a  narrow  therapeutic  index,  in  which  the  dose  is  individually  adjusted  (e.g.  warfarin)  cannot  be 
excluded,  since  initiation  of  mosunetuzumab  treatment  causes  a  transient  increase  in  cytokine  levels 
which may cause inhibition of CYP450 enzymes.  On initiation of therapy in patients being treated with 
CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered. The 
dose  of  the  concomitant  medicinal  product  should  be  adjusted  as  needed.  This  information  has  been 
provided adequately in the SmPC section 4.5. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacodynamics

B-cell aplasia is an expected on-target toxicity of both mosunetuzumab treatment and prior anti-CD20 
therapy. By Cycle 8 Day 1, all patients with available baseline and follow-up B-cell count measurements 
experienced B-cell aplasia (defined as CD19 measurement of <70 counts/µL), however more than 70% 
of subjects already had B-cell aplasia at baseline. Limited data of B-cell counts post treatment suggest 
that B-cell aplasia may persist at longer term (at 6 months post treatment only 1 out of 18 patients with 
available follow-on samples for analysis and B-cell counts shows B-cell recovery). B-cell aplasia might 
indicate the durability of the mosunetuzumab effect. Further characterisation of B-cell aplasia and the 
time to B-cell recovery is expected from further data collected with longer follow-up in ongoing study 
GO29781.  
Also,  IgG  decrease  is  an  on-target  toxicity  expected  to  result  from  B-cell  aplasia.  For  a  proportion  of 
patients  (40.0%)  with  baseline  IgG  levels  ≥  5  g/L  depletions  in  their  IgG  values  were  observed  post 
treatment to values <5 g/L. For the majority of patients (78.9%) with baseline IgG level < 5 g/L, this 
low level was maintained post-baseline.  
With regard to hypogammaglobulinemia, this was reported in 9 of 414 patients (2.2%) in Group B, with 
all events being Grade 1-2 and non-serious. Seven of them were treated with immunoglobulin therapy 
and 5 recovered within a range of 0 to 55 days. Overall, 25 patients (6.0%) in Group B received immune 
globulin  as  a  concomitant  medication, 
for 
the 
treatment  of  hypogammaglobinemia, 
low 
hypogammaglobinemia or low IgG, including 2 patients concurrent with infections. 
No clear relationship has been observed between CD20 expression level and PK and efficacy outcomes. 
IL-6 and INFγ time profiles were similar and were for the step-up dosing Cohort Group B characterized 
by an acute and transient elevation, predominantly limited to the first cycle of treatment, despite the 
continued accumulation in the serum of mosunetuzumab.  In general, no changes from baseline were 
observed in later cycles. 
The  Applicant  is  planning  to  further  characterize  and  publish  the  primary  pharmacology  data  for  the 
remaining exploratory PD endpoints (changes CD19+ cells, T-cell subsets and NK-cells, T-cell activation 
by flow cytometry, and evaluation of intratumoral changes). 
Exposure-efficacy 
The proposed registration dose and schedule of mosunetuzumab is administered using the Cycle 1 step-
up regimen (i.e., 1 mg and 2 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 8, respectively, as the “step doses”, followed by 
two “loading doses” of 60 mg on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, and then maintained at the “base 
dose” of 30 mg for the remaining Cycles 3−8; treatment continues for 17 cycles [approximately 1 year] 
if CR is not achieved by Cycle 8), referred to as 1/2/60/30 mg. 
Based  on  15  March  2021  CCOD,  at  the  proposed  registration  dose  and  schedule  of  1/2/60/30  mg, 
mosunetuzumab IV monotherapy showed IRF-assessed CR rate of 57.8% (95% CI: 46.9, 68.1) and ORR 
of 78.9% (95% CI: 69.0, 86.8) with associated durability. The proposed registration dose and schedule 
of 1/2/60/30 mg was predicted to achieve PK exposures at the plateau of the ER curves for CRR and 
ORR.   
“Step Doses” of 1 mg and 2 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 8 are clinically active and well tolerated doses 
shown to mitigate the ROmax-dependency of the acute CRS. The two loading doses of 60 mg induced 
rapid  and  durable  tumor  reduction  in  responding  patients  who  received  the  1/2/60/30  mg  clinical 
regimen.  This rapid response over the first 2 cycles further supports the rationale of the Applicant to 
incorporate loading doses in early cycles in order to maximize clinical benefits, particularly, for patients 
with larger baseline tumor burden; the 30 mg base dose following such rapid initial tumor debulking was 
shown to induce durable clinical response.  The lowering of the dose from 60 mg loading to 30 mg base 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 80/81 
 
  
 
 
dose  (from  cycle  3  onwards)  minimizes  unnecessary  over-exposure  in  patients  during  the  treatment 
duration to minimize any potential for acute or chronic/cumulative toxicity. 
The rationale for the 60 mg loading doses for the first 2 cycles (on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1) is 
illustrated by comparing to a simulated dose regimen of 1/2/30 mg (replacing the 60 mg loading doses 
with 30 mg).  The model predicts further increase in clinical CRR and ORR with minimal increase in Grade 
≥2  CRS.    Furthermore,  the  60  mg  loading  doses  better  ensure  the  majority  of  patients  achieve  PK 
exposure  corresponding  to  the  efficacy  plateau  of  the  ER  curves  (as  assessed  by  E90  and  90%  CI) 
thereby  maximizing  the  therapeutic  potential  of  mosunetuzumab  in  patients  with  R/R  FL  ≥2  Prior 
Therapies.  
The dose and schedule of mosunetuzumab is recommended as a Cycle 1 step-up regimen (i.e., 1 mg 
and 2 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 8, respectively, as the “step doses”, followed by two “loading doses” of 
60 mg on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, and then maintained at the “base dose” of 30 mg for the 
remaining Cycles 3−8; treatment continues for 17 cycles [approximately 1 year] if CR is not achieved 
by Cycle 8), referred to as 1/2/60/30 mg.  
Raised PK concerns regarding supplied data in the present Application have been adequately addressed 
by the MAH. As of the anti-drug antibodies (ADA) data cutoff date of 4 December 2020, there was no 
ADA detected in 418 ADA evaluable patients who received mosunetuzumab single agent IV treatments 
in Study GO29781.  
Exposure-safety 
Grade ≥2 CRS was identified as an exposure- and regimen- dependent AE where the administration of 
mosunetuzumab following the step-up dosing regimen was associated with a  relatively low frequency 
but  ROmax-dependent  increase  of  Grade ≥2  CRS  transiently  during  Cycle 1  following  the  60 mg  dose 
administration on Day 15.  The occurrence of Grade ≥3 CRS frequency was <3%. 
The overall clinical experience and ER data support that neurological events are mostly lower grade and 
have a modest exposure-dependency across the dose range tested (i.e., 0.4/1/2.8 mg to 1/2/60/30 mg) 
using the step-up dosing regimen.   
No exposure-related increases were seen using the step-up dosing regimen with regard to the rates of 
other  Grade  ≥3  AEs  including  neutropenia  and  infections/infestations.  A  slightly  positive  ER  slope  for 
increased NAE frequency with AUC0-42 and ROmax0-42 metrics has been observed, however this trend is 
not significant (p>0.05), indicating only a small effect size. In addition, clinical data with the target step-
up dosing regimen, indicating NAEs are overall manageable (Mostly grade 1-2, only 4.4% grade 3 and 
no grade 4-5), further support that NAEs are not considered to be an important risk for r/r FL patients 
receiving mosunetuzumab monotherapy. 
Two  mouse  anti-idiotypic  antibodies  against  the  anti-CD3  (PC1)  and  anti  CD20  (PC2)  portion  of 
mosunetuzumab were used as positive controls in the ADA assay. 100 ng/mL PC1 remained positive at 
5.00 µg/mL of mosunetuzumab while 100 ng/mL PC2 was positive at 1.00 µg/mL and negative at 5.00 
µg/mL  of  mosunetuzumab.  99%  of  samples  had  mosunetuzumab  levels  <5.00  µg/mL.  The  drug 
tolerance  of  ADAs  raised  against  the  anti-CD3  part  of  mosunetuzumab  is  adequate  as  tested  by  the 
mouse  surrogate  marker  PC1.  The  drug  tolerance  of  ADAs  raised  against  the  anti-CD20  part  of 
mosunetuzumab is less good, however, the impact of potential false negatives against the anti-CD20 is 
considered low as ~50% samples had mosunetuzumab levels <1.00 µg/mL (reported DT of PC2) and 
78% samples had mosunetuzumab <2.12 µg/mL and a new assay will not be requested. The Applicant 
is recommended to improve the assay drug tolerance for PC2 for future applications, if possible.

As of the anti-drug antibodies (ADA) data cutoff date of 4 December 2020, there was no ADA detected 
in  418  ADA  evaluable  patients  who  received  mosunetuzumab  single-agent  IV  treatments  in 
Study GO29781. 
No  formal  QT/QTc  studies  were  presented  as  mosunetuzumab is  not  expected  to  constitute  a  cardiac 
risk. 
Numerical  differences  in  response  rates  were  observed  in  patients  depending  on  time  since  last  anti-
CD20 therapy, although, it should be noted that time since last anti-CD20 therapy could be confounded 
by other clinical characteristics, for example, refractory status to prior anti-CD20-containing regimens. 
No dose adjustment for mosunetuzumab is recommended based on prior anti-CD20 therapies. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Clinical pharmacology programme for Lunsumio is considered adequate. All relevant information 
has been included in the SmPC.  
The Applicant is planning to further characterize and publish the primary pharmacology data for the 
remaining exploratory PD endpoints (changes in CD19+ cells, T-cell subsets and NK-cells, T-cell 
activation by flow cytometry, and evaluation of intratumoral changes). This data is expected to be 
available and published by the end of 2022.

For Group B11 RP2D:  
To evaluate the efficacy of mosunetuzumab using a Cycle 1 step-up dosing schedule as a single agent 
(Group B) in patients with R/R DLBCL and transformed FL and patients with R/R FL, as measured by 
Independent Review Facility (IRF)-assessed CR rate according to standard NHL response criteria (Cheson 
et al. 2007).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome measure for this study is IRF-assessed CR rate according to standard 
NHL response criteria (Cheson et al. 2007). CR rate is defined as the proportion of patients whose best 
overall response is a CR based upon IRF assessment.  
The secondary efficacy outcome measures are described in the SAP for study GO29781, and are as 
follows: 
● 
Investigator-assessed CR rate, using standard criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007). 
●  ORR, using standard criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007). ORR was assessed by the IRF and by 
the INV.  
●  DOCR, assessed by the IRF and by the INV, using standard criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007).  
●  DOR, assessed by the IRF and by the INV, using standard criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007).  
●  PFS, assessed by the IRF and by the INV, using standard criteria for NHL (Cheson et al. 2007).   
●  OS.  
Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The  results  for  the  following  PRO  analyses  are  described  for  patients  with  R/R  FL  in  the  B11  and  B7 
cohorts who have received ≥2 prior systemic therapies: 
●  Change from baseline scores in physical functioning and fatigue symptom domains of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30, disease-related symptoms or concerns of the FACT-Lym subscale, and health status 
according to the index utility score and the VAS of the EQ-5D-5L. 
●  Responder  analyses  of  proportion  of  patients  with  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement  from 
baseline  at  any  time  in  physical  functioning  (≥10-point increase)  and  fatigue  symptom  (≥10-
point  decrease)  domains  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30,  and  the  FACT-Lym  subscale  (≥3-point 
increase). 
●  Time to deterioration from baseline to first documentation of a ≥10-point decrease from baseline 
in physical functioning, or ≥10-point increase from baseline in fatigue scales of the EORTC QLQ-
C30, or a ≥3-point decrease from baseline in FACT-Lym subscale. 
Radiographic Assessments 
In protocol version 7 (16 August 2018), FDG PET/CT imaging for baseline tumor burden assessment in 
FDG-avid lymphomas was changed to a requirement, while it was clarified that conventional CT scans 
were the preferred modality for subsequent imaging timepoints for lymphomas that are shown to not be 
FDG-avid or have variable FDG uptake at screening. 
From protocol version 9 (30 January 2019) onwards, it was clarified that FDG PET and diagnostic-quality 
CT scans were required at screening and for response assessments during study treatment for lymphoma 
patients (the specific distinction between FDG-avid/ not FDG-avid was removed). It was also added that 
during post-treatment follow-up, CT scans with or without PET scans could be utilized for these patients. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 90/91 
 
  
 
 
Of note, the first patient with R/R FL ≥2 prior therapies in the B7 cohort was treated on 23 February 
2018 and in the B11 cohort on 14 May 2019. 
All FL patients in the B11 cohort had positive PET-scans at baseline. Of the three patients that also had 
PET-negative enlarged lymph nodes at baseline, two developed CR (confirmed by CT measurement) 
and the third had SD.  
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  selected  to  be  able  to  show  a  CR  rate  superior  to  14%.  This  cut-off  value  was 
selected based on the CR rate of idelalisib and copanlisib: 8% and 14%, respectively (the clinical studies 
included different FL patient populations). The expansion cohorts for FL have been designed to rule out 
a 14% CR rate and are powered to detect a 14% increase in CR rate from 14% to 28%. 
For the R/R FL expansion cohorts of Group B: with observed CR rates of 24% and 28%, a sample size 
of 80 patients will result in 95% CIs of (15%, 35%) and (18%, 39%), respectively, i.e., a true CR rate 
below 14% is ruled out. Additionally, 80 patients will provide an 83% power to detect a 14% increase in 
CR rate from 14% to 28%, at the 5% two-sided significance level.  
The Sponsor may enroll more than 80 patients in the R/R FL expansion cohorts of Group B to obtain data 
from at least 60 patients with R/R FL who are refractory to both anti-CD20 therapy and an alkylating 
agent to perform statistical analyses.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Study GO29781 is an open-label study - a blinded outcome evaluation by IRF is implemented.   
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets: The primary efficacy analyses will cover Group B efficacy evaluable patients with R/R 
FL or R/R DLBCL/trFL who have enrolled in the RP2D (1/2/60/30 mg of mosunetuzumab) cohort. 
Primary endpoint IRF-CR: Comparisons of CR rate between each efficacy-evaluable population and 
historical controls will be conducted using an exact binomial test with two-sided alpha level of 5%. The 
control CR rate is assumed to be 14% for R/R FL population. Patients with missing or no response 
assessments will be classified as non-complete responders. The exact 95% CIs using the Clopper-
Pearson method for CR rate will be provided. 
Estimand Framework for Primary Endpoint 
Variable: Number of patients who achieve an IRF-assessed CR 
Population: The primary endpoint will be conducted separately in R/R DLBCL/trFL and R/R FL efficacy 
evaluable populations 
Treatment:  Patients  will  receive  mosunetuzumab  monotherapy.  Tocilizumab  will  be  used  to  manage 
safety risks in patients with severe CRS 
Intercurrent events and strategy: 
●  Discontinuation  from  study  (including  COVID-related  reasons)  prior  to  achieving  CR. 
Composite Strategy: Patients will be included as non-complete responders. 
●  Start  of  new  anti-lymphoma  therapy  (NALT)  prior  to  achieving  CR.  Composite  Strategy: 
Patients will be included as non-complete responders. 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 91/92 
 
  
 
 
 
 
●  Discontinuation  of  study  drug  (including  COVID-related  reasons)  prior  to  achieving  CR. 
Treatment policy: Available assessments after the discontinuation of study drug will be used 
to determine CR status 
●  Missed  any  scheduled  response  assessments  (including  COVID-related  reasons)  prior  to 
achieving CR. Treatment policy: Available assessments will be used to determine CR status 
Population Level Summary: The proportion of patients in each of the R/R DLBCL/trFL and R/R FL efficacy 
evaluable populations whose best overall response is a CR based on IRF assessment. Comparisons of CR 
between  the  efficacy-evaluable  population  and  historical  controls  will  be  conducted  using  an  exact 
binomial test with two-sided alpha level of 5%. 
The primary efficacy analysis population is based on all enrolled patients. The Applicant aims to estimate 
the  complete  response  rate  regardless  of  missing  assessments  or  treatment  discontinuations  prior  to 
achieving a CR. . Starting a new anti-lymphoma therapy or study discontinuation prior to achieving a CR 
is considered as a non-complete response.  
Secondary  Response  Endpoints;  Inv-CR  rate  and  IRF-  and  Inv-ORR  rate:  The  exact  95% 
confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method for CR rate /PR+CR rate will be provided. 
Secondary  Time  to  Event  Endpoints:  DOCR,  DOR,  PFS,  and  OS:  The  time  to  event  secondary 
endpoints will be assessed by the IRF and by the investigator. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used. 
For DOCR and DOR only efficacy evaluable patients who achieve a CR (DOCR, DOR) or at least PR (DOR) 
will  be  included.  The  censoring  rules  are  listed  in  the  clinical  assessment  report.  According  to  the 
implemented censoring rules, patients who start a new anti-lymphoma therapy or discontinue the study 
before PD are considered to have the same risk of events as patients who remained in the study treated 
with study drug. Sensitivity analyses were planned in case  more than 5 % of the patients discontinued 
study due to starting a new anti-lymphoma therapy.

Multiplicity and interim analyses  
The  study  has  one  primary  endpoint  and  several  secondary  endpoints.  Hypothesis  testing  will  be 
conducted on the primary endpoint of IRF assessed CR rate. The R/R DLBCL/trFL and R/R FL cohorts at 
RP2D will be each tested at the 5% alpha level.  
 “The primary efficacy analysis in the Group B R/R FL and R/R DLBCL/tr FL expansion cohorts occurred 
when all the following conditions were met: 
●  At least approximately 6 months after last patient in (LPI) in Group B R/R FL and R/R DLBCL/tr 
FL expansion cohorts, whichever is later; 
●  Efficacy-evaluable  population  includes  approximately  80  patients  in  this  cohort  for  each 
histology” 
The performed interim analyses do not inflate the type I error. The protocol also includes several other 
cohorts to increase operational efficiency and patients belong to only one cohort. The type I error is thus 
not affected.  
Changes in the SAP 
There  were  two  versions of  the  SAP.  The  current  version  was  dated  21  May  2021.  The  Applicant has 
described the changes made to the SAP v1. 
No significant changes were made in the planned analyses of the main endpoints in the CSR.

B11 R/R FL RP2D Cohort 
Of  the  152  patients  in  the  Group  B  FL  cohort,  90  patients  in  Group  B11  had  received  the  RP2D  of 
1/2/60/30 mg mosunetuzumab IV monotherapy as initial treatment during the dose expansion stage in 
this study.  
At the most recent data cut-off (27 Aug 2021), 0 patients of the 90 R/R FL patients were active on initial 
treatment, 54 patients (60%) had completed initial treatment, and 36 patients (40%) had discontinued 
initial treatment. The main reason for discontinuation was PD (25/36). Four were due to AEs, four were 
due to  physician’s  decision,  two  were due to use of  another  anti-cancer therapy,  and  one  is listed  as 
withdrawal by subject. Given the potentially serious and very uncomfortable AE of CRS one could envision 
that  some  of  the  reasons  for  withdrawal  were  due  to  this  AE.  The  Applicant was  requested  to  supply 
narratives (with direct links) for the 11 FL patients in group B11 and the seven FL patients in the B7 
group that discontinued due to reasons other than PD.  
For  the  B7  cohort  it  is  considered  that  6  and  not  4  patients  experienced  adverse  events  leading  to 
discontinuation.  
The efficacy assessment will focus on the 90 patients with R/R FL who received the intended registration 
dose  and  schedule  of  1/2/60/30  mg  (B11  FL  RP2D:  primary  efficacy  population).  Supportive  efficacy 
data for 46 patients with R/R FL enrolled and treated at the lower dose level of 1/2/13.5 mg (B7; including 
44 patients in the Group B interim expansion cohort, and 2 patients in the dose escalation cohort) will 
also be described here as the results are presented side-by-side in the tables.

Recruitment 
First Patient Enrolled: 15-Sep-2015 
This  interim  CSR  reports  data  in  R/R  NHL  patients  receiving  mosunetuzumab  intravenous  (IV) 
monotherapy in both Group A and Group B (dose escalation and dose expansion stages) up to the clinical 
cutoff date (CCOD) of 15 March 2021. Since the study was ongoing at the time of the CCOD (and 
will remain ongoing at the time of the finalization of this interim CSR), a database lock was deemed not 
appropriate to be applied at the CCOD. Rather, a database snapshot, which is a stable extract of the 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 99/100 
 
  
 
 
 
 
final data based on the CCOD, was taken on 21 May 2021. Updated efficacy and safety data has been 
provided during the procedure so that relevant data is presented for the CCOD of 27 Aug 2021.  
Conduct of the study 
Study GO29781, which is the single study included in this submission, was conducted in accordance with 
the principles of GCP, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local, state, and federal 
laws,  as  well  as  other  applicable  national legal  requirements.  The  appropriate Ethics  Committees  and 
Institutional Review Boards reviewed and approved this study. 
The Roche Clinical Quality Assurance group or designee conducted audits, and one critical finding of non-
compliance  was  observed;  Study  Monitoring  processes  failed  to  ensure  that  subjects  were  verbally 
informed  about  the  emerging  safety  risks  contained  in  the  Actemra  (tocilizumab).  Dear  Investigator 
Letters (DILs) on the hepatotoxicity risks at their next study visit, as specified in the DIL communication 
plan, and the master informed consent form was not revised to include these risks for six months until 
the next protocol amendment was issued.  
Corrective  and  preventative  actions  were  established  and  implemented  to  ensure  adequate  study 
oversight, subject consent and communication of safety information were in place to protect the subjects’ 
rights  to  be  informed of  emerging  safety  information  and  to  prevent  similar  issues  in the  future.  The 
impact of the critical finding on patient safety is minimal considering that tocilizumab in Study GO29781 
is administered as an acute rescue medication to treat patients who experience CRS, a different patient 
population  than  outlined  in  the  DIL;  and  it  is  anticipated  that  patients  may  need  to  only  receive  1-2 
doses of tocilizumab.   
The  Applicant  has  provided  a  tabulated  overview  of  major  protocol  changes  related  to  Group  B  (see 
below). A subset of patients in the B7 FL cohort were enrolled under protocol v6-8 under which the FDG 
PET imaging was not strictly required.

At CCOD (15 March 2021), 44 major protocol deviations IPDs were reported in 30 subjects (33,3%) in 
the B11 RP2D FL cohort. Out of these 4 (4.4%) were  related to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The most common major protocol deviations in the B11 FL RP2D cohort was “Incomplete/missing/out-
of-window tumor-related assessments” reported in 11% of patients (n = 10). According to the narratives 
provided,  all  of  the  10  major  protocol  deviations  were  related  to  delayed  confirmation  of  complete 
response by bone marrow assessment. In addition, an analysis of subject incidence of major and overall

protocol deviations by study site was provided, suggesting a slightly increased median number of major 
and overall protocol deviations per subject in 6 sites (3 located in Spain, 2 in Germany and 1 in Australia). 
The major protocol deviations observed in these sites were distributed across various subcategories. In 
addition, these sites had only few subjects enrolled (n ≤ 3).

Numbers analysed 
The  primary  efficacy  population  are  the  90  patients  with  R/R  FL  (≥2  prior  lines  of  systemic  therapy) 
receiving the RP2D/intended registration dose and schedule of 1/2/60/30 mg in cohort B11.   
The 46 patients with R/R FL enrolled and treated at the lower dose level of 1/2/13.5 mg in cohort B7 
(≥2 prior lines of systemic therapy) are considered a supportive efficacy population. 
Outcomes and estimation (CCOD: 27 August 2021) 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
In the main efficacy cohort B11 FL RP2D the CR (by IRF) was 60% (95% CI: 49.1, 70.2) and for the 
supportive cohort B7 (FL), which received a lower dose, the CR rate 45.7% (95% CI: 30.9, 61.0).

Secondary endpoints 
Updated analyses were provided by the Applicant with an increase in median follow-up for DOR from 
10.3 to 14.9 months for the B11 FL RP2D Cohort and from 21.0 to 24.2 months for the B7 FL Interim 
Cohort.

Table 20 Extent of follow up for Duration of response in R/R FL patients> 2 prior therapies 
27.08.21 
Agreement between IRF- and investigator-assessed response on whether a patient achieved a CR was 
high: 93.3% (83/89). IRF-assessed ORR was 80.0% (95% CI: 70.3%, 87.7%). 
The  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  in  the  B7  FL  interim  dose  cohort  receiving  the  lower  dose  of 
1/2/13.5 mg were slightly lower than in the B11 FL cohort and are generally thought to support efficacy.   
Of the 54 patients in the B11 FL RP2D cohort who achieved a CR as assessed by the IRF, 16 patients 
(29.6%)  subsequently had  disease  progression by  the  time of  the  CCOD  (27 Aug  2021).  The  median 
DOCR was not estimable. The K-M estimated event-free rates among complete responders at 12 and 18 
months after the first complete response were 71.4% and 63.7%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier plot 
of DOCR as assessed by IRF is provided. The median DOR has been reached and is 22.8 months (95% CI: 
9.7,  NE).  Among  responders,  the  event-free  rates at  12  and  18 months  after  the  first  response  were 
61.8% and 56.9%, respectively. Median PFS is 17.9 months with a 12-month and 18-months PFS event-
free rate of 57.7% and 47.0%, respectively. Median OS is not reached, with a K-M-estimated 12-month 
survival rate of 93.0%.

Although not included as a secondary endpoint in the study protocol, it is of importance to note that for 
the majority of patients a response and/or complete response was achieved relatively short after start 
of treatment, with a median time to first response in the 72 patients who achieved an objective response 
(CR or PR) of 1.4 months (range: 1.1 – 8.9 months) and with median time to first complete response in 
the 54 patients who achieved a CR of 3.0 months (range: 1.1 – 18.9 months).  
From  11  patients  who  received  >8 cycles  of  mosunetuzumab  treatment  and  had  tumor  assessments 
beyond Cycle 8, 4 patients (36.4%) who had a best response of SD or PR by the end of Cycle 8 had a 
late initial response or deepening of response, with 3 patients deepening their response from PR to CR 
and 1 patient with a PR after having SD by the end of Cycle 8. In addition, 5 patients maintained their 
PR or SD. One patient progressed, and 1 patient already had CR by the end of cycle 8 (major protocol 
deviation).  While  the  safety  profile  reported  after  8  cycles  of  mosunetuzumab  treatment  was  more 
tolerable compared to that within the first 8 cycles and no new safety signals were detected beyond 8 
cycles, these results justify the appropriateness of continuing treatment beyond Cycle 8 for patients with 
SD or PR at the end of Cycle 8 and for the proposed treatment duration. 
In response to a request for additional information, the Applicant also provided a summary of data of 
primary and key secondary endpoints using a modified Lugano response criteria (based on Cheson 2014 
criteria with conservative modifications including the requirement of bone marrow confirmation for CR 
assessment, and at least 50% SPD reduction for PR assessment) used for exploratory purposes (CCOD 
15 March 2021). Compared to the efficacy results reports with the Cheson 2007 response criteria (IRF 
assessment, CCOD of 15 March 2021), consistent efficacy outcomes in terms of CRR and ORR have been 
reported using the modified Lugano response criteria (CRR of 57.8% and 58.9% respectively; ORR of 
78.9% and 77.8%, respectively); in terms of DOR and PFS, even slightly higher 12-month DOR and PFS 
rates were reported using the modified Lugano response criteria (12-month DOR of 65.4% and 77.1%, 
respectively; 12-month PFS rate of 59.7% and 69.6%, respectively).

In addition, the Applicant provided sensitivity analyses using EMA censoring rules, considering other new 
anticancer therapies or retreatment in the absence of prior documented progression as an event (CCOD: 
15 March 2021). Overall, although 12-month event free rate for DOR, PFS and DOCR (for both IRF and 
INV assessed data) are slightly lower using the EMA censoring rules compared to the original analysis 
(12-month DOR rate: 60.3% vs 65.4%; 12-months DOCR rate: 72.6% vs 76.9%; 12-months PFS rate:

54.0%  vs  59.7%;  per  IRF  assessment),  95%  confidence  intervals  are  overlapping  and  medians  were 
highly consistent.

Patient Reported Outcomes 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 112/113 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In terms of patient-reported outcomes, high compliance rates of >70% (in some cases, >80%) were 
consistently observed for all questionnaires across the scheduled assessments for these cohorts.  
Post-baseline assessments for the B11 FL RP2D cohort and the B7 FL interim dose cohort indicated that 
physical functioning and fatigue scores were generally maintained per the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire 
and that lymphoma symptom-related burden at baseline was also maintained according to the FACT-
Lym subscale.  
It is considered that the uncontrolled/unblinded nature of the HR-QoL data and the lack of any strategy 
to control for multiplicity do not allow for specific HR-QoL claims and preclude the inclusion of HRQoL 
data in the SmPC. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses - CCOD (27 August 2021) 
Subgroup analyses of the treatment effect across relevant subpopulations defined by demographic, 
prior treatment (number and refractory status; PD <24 months after initial treatment), and prognostic 
factors (FLIPI) were provided.  
Patients  refractory  to  alkylator-  and  anti-CD20-therapy  were  observed  to  have  a  lower  CR  rate 
(CR=50%; CI 35%, 65%) compared to non-refractory patients (CR=71%, CI 55%, 84%). The expansion 
cohorts for FL have been designed to rule out a 14% CR rate and are powered to detect a 14% increase 
in CR rate from 14% to 28%. As CR in refractory patients is well above the 28%, it is agreed, that the 
indication in FL after 2 prior systemic therapies should include both refractory and relapsed FL patients.  
Forest plots for 12-month event-free rate for DOR and DOCR for relevant subgroups in the B11 FL RP2D 
Cohort (CCOD: 27 August 2021), were provided.

2.6.5.6 Supportive study  
There is only one study with multiple subgroups. Subgroup B7 included 46 FL patients having received 
≥ 2 prior therapies treated with mosunetuzumab 1/2/13.5 mg. The Applicant has presented the results 
side-by-side with the pivotal B11 cohort, so the results in this cohort are briefly commented upon in the 
main study section.  
2.6.6 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study GO29781: An open-label, multicenter, Phase I/Ib (Phase I/II per protocol v12) trial evaluating the 
safety,  efficacy,  and  PK  of  escalating  doses  of  mosunetuzumab  (BTCT4465A)  as  a  single  agent  and 
combined with atezolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 
chronic  lymphocytic  leukemia.  The  Interim  CSR  GO29781  reports  all  data  in  patients  receiving  IV 
monotherapy in both Group A and Group B (dose escalation and dose expansion stages) up to the clinical 
cut-off date (CCOD) of 15 March 2021. 
Efficacy  results  are  described  for  90  patients  with  R/R  FL  (≥2  prior  systemic  therapies  that  included 
treatment  with  an  anti-CD20-directed  therapy  and  an  alkylating  agent)  receiving  the  RP2D/intended 
registration  dose  and  schedule  of  1/2/60/30  mg  (B11  FL).  The  46  patients  with  R/R  FL  enrolled  and 
treated at the lower dose level of 1/2/13.5 mg (B7) are considered supportive. Enrolment of patients 
with  R/R  FL  in  Study GO29781  as  well  as  grading  of  FL  was  based  on  local  assessment  of  diagnosis. 
Confirmation of FL by central assessment in all subjects was not planned as the study has been initially 
designed as a FIH study. Moreover, a reliable pathological diagnosis of FL depends largely on size and 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 126/127 
 
  
 
 
 
quality of the tissue sample. Consequently, the implementation of the central confirmation after local 
histopathological diagnosis would result in potentially insufficient size and/or quality of tissue samples 
for a proportion of patients to confirm diagnosis. 
Dose-expansion FL cohorts in Study GO29781 did not include patients with diagnosis of Grade 3B FL or 
transformed FL patients (see SmPC section 5.1).  The distinction between Grade 3A and 3B in the 
current WHO edition is important due to their apparent differences in molecular genetics and 
prognosis; it is suggested that Grade 3A FL  is on the same spectrum as Grade 1-2 FL, and Grade 3B 
(no centrocytes, centroblasts only) FL behaves as de novo DLBCL (Katzenberger et al., Am J Pathol 
2004; Karube et al., Blood 2007)”. 
Based on the sought indication (Mosunetuzumab as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  follicular  lymphoma  (FL)  who  have  received  at  least  two  prior 
systemic therapies) the population included in the trial is considered at high risk and representative for 
the  intended  population,  although  patients  with  various  detrimental  conditions  (ECOG  ≥2,  cardiac, 
conditions,  moderate-severe  renal  and  hepatic  impairment)  were  excluded,  as  they  generally  are  in 
clinical trials.  
The endpoints are considered relevant for a SAT and the primary endpoint of CR (by IRF) is a potential 
surrogate endpoint for PFS (Zhu et al. 2017; Mangal et al. 2018), which is considered the most relevant 
endpoint in indolent lymphomas (including FL), where new treatments are applied for PD on a regular 
basis.  
At CCOD (15 March 2021), 44 major protocol deviations  were reported in 30 subjects (33,3%) in the 
B11 RP2D FL cohort. Out of these 4 (4.4%) were  related to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The most common major protocol deviations in the B11 FL RP2D cohort was “Incomplete/missing/out-
of-window tumor-related assessments” reported in 11% of patients (n = 10). According to the narratives 
provided,  all  of  the  10  major  protocol  deviations  were  related  to  delayed  confirmation  of  complete 
response by bone marrow assessment which may have contributed to an underestimate of the CR rate 
and DOCR. In addition, an analysis of subject incidence of major and overall protocol deviations by study 
site  was  provided,  suggesting  a  slightly  increased  median  number  of  major  and  overall  protocol 
deviations per subject in 6 sites (3 located in Spain, 2 in Germany and 1 in  Australia). However, the 
major  protocol  deviations  observed  in  these  sites  were  distributed  across  various  subcategories, 
indicating there was no specific protocol deviation causing consistent errors in study conduct. In addition, 
these sites had only few subjects enrolled (n ≤ 3), which might also explain the slightly higher rates of 
major and minor protocol deviations. In overall, the deviations were not considered to affect the overall 
conclusions of the study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Exposure-efficacy: At the proposed registration dose and schedule of 1/2/60/30 mg, mosunetuzumab IV 
monotherapy showed IRF-assessed CR rate of 60% (95% CI: 49.1, 70.2) and ORR of 80% (95% CI: 
70.3, 87.7) with associated durability (CCOD of 27 August 2021). The proposed registration dose and 
schedule of 1/2/60/30 mg was predicted to achieve PK exposures at the plateau of the ER curves for 
CRR and ORR. 
For the supportive cohort B7, which received a lower dose, the CR rate was 45.7% (95% CI: 30.9, 61.0).  
The secondary endpoints support the primary endpoint although at the CCOD of 15 March 2021 data 
were immature with a median follow-up for DOR of 10.3 months in an indolent disease like FL. Updated 
data  with a CCOD of 27 Aug 2021, with an improved data maturity (median follow-up for DOR of 14.9 
months), have been submitted and confirms the initial results. The results of the secondary endpoints in 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 127/128 
 
  
 
 
the B7 FL interim dose cohort receiving the lower dose of 1/2/13.5 mg were slightly lower than in the 
B11 FL cohort and are generally thought to support efficacy.   
The limited efficacy and safety results for patients who received more than 8 cycles of mosunetuzumab 
treatment (n = 11) support the appropriateness of continuing treatment beyond Cycle 8 for patients with 
SD or PR at the end of Cycle 8 and for the proposed treatment duration.  
Subgroup analyses of the CR rate by IRF assessment in general demonstrated the consistency of the 
treatment effect across relevant subpopulations defined by demographic, prior treatment (number and 
refractory  status;  PD  <24  months  after  initial  treatment),  and  prognostic  factors  (FLIPI).  Consistent 
response  rates  were  also  observed  for  subgroups  with  anticipated  poor  prognosis,  such  as  for  frailer 
patients aged ≥ 65 years, patients with PD within 24 months after start of first line treatment, patients 
with bulky disease and patients with intermediate/high risk FLIPI scores. Consistency of the treatment 
effect across relevant subpopulations has also been shown in terms of response durability (12-Months 
event-free rate for DOR and DOCR).  
Given the limitations associated with the uncontrolled single-arm design of the pivotal study and that 
the primary endpoint, CR, is not an established surrogate endpoint in r/r FL, sufficiently mature DOR 
data are important. At the CCOD of 15 March 2021, data were immature in an indolent disease like FL, 
with a median follow-up for DOR of 10.3 months with the proposed dosing regimen (1/2/60/30 mg). 
Therefore, updated data with an improved data maturity were requested and have been provided, 
which confirm the initial results (CCOD 15 March 2021 to CCOD of 27 Aug 2021).  
The efficacy results with mosunetuzumab monotherapy have been contextualized through a systematic 
literature review conducted by the Applicant including approved and unapproved therapies. These cross-
trial  indirect  comparisons  are  however  associated  with  well-known  limitations,  mainly  related  to 
differences in study populations. This is in particular the case for studies including patients with r/r FL, 
known to be a very heterogeneous patient population in terms of disease course, treatment history and 
prognosis. Contextualisation using an external real-world control based on a non-interventional study 
applying similar eligibility criteria as for study GO29781 would have partially overcome these issues and 
would  have  been  preferred.  However,  such  an  external  real-world  control  is  lacking,  which  poses 
uncertainty  on  the  value  of  the  efficacy  results  obtained  with  this  single-arm  study  in  the  context  of 
available alternatives. Despite the uncertainties associated with cross-trial comparisons and given there 
is no standard of care in the target disease setting, the clinical data with mosunetuzumab monotherapy 
in general show a substantial effect size compared to most of the currently approved and unapproved 
alternative  therapies  (including  PI3K  inhibitors,  rituximab  +  lenalidomide  and  bendamustine  + 
obinutuzumab). Overall, these indirect comparisons support the contextualization of the mosunetuzumab 
efficacy and safety results and suggest that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability 
outweigh the risks in this patient population with high unmet need.  
In addition, in response to a request for additional information, the Applicant provided results of several 
RWD  studies  involving  patients  with  R/R  FL  having  received  ≥  2  prior  lines  of  systemic  therapies, 
including  2  RWD  analyses  conducted  by  the  Applicant.  Despite  methodological  issues  preventing  any 
definite conclusion based on comparative analyses, RWD study data might give an idea on the validity 
of the pre-defined threshold for CR rate. In this respect, these RWD data support the issue with regard 
to  the  validity  of  the  predefined  threshold  CR  rate  of  14%  used  for  superiority  testing,  as  CR  rates 
provided  for  all  RWD  studies  are  higher  than  14%  (ranging  from  17.7%  to  47%).  However,  the 
compelling response rates observed with mosunetuzumab monotherapy, supported by contextualizing 
with RWD study data as well as with study data with alternative approved and unapproved therapies, do 
overcome this issue.

Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
From a regulatory point of view, an RCT would have been preferred based on the availability of alternative 
therapies for the included population. Instead, the results from the study are contextualised through a 
systematic literature review. This presents certain limitations, as discussed.  
Mosunetuzumab is still in development, but based on the promising CR rate, particularly compared to 
other treatments for FL, it is considered appropriate for the Applicant to request approval in the context 
of a conditional MA as requirements for a CMA are fulfilled (see B/R section). A confirmatory phase III 
study evaluating PFS is considered necessary for a conversion of the CMA to full approval and has recently 
commenced:  Study  GO42909:  A  randomized  Phase  III  trial  of  mosunetuzumab  plus  lenalidomide 
(M+Len)  versus  rituximab  plus  lenalidomide  (R+Len)  in  patients  with  R/R  FL  after  at  least  one  prior 
systemic therapy regimen. 
2.6.7 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Lunsumio as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies - is 
considered promising based on the CR rate.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
●  The MAH will provide results from Study GO42909, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial 
evaluating mosunetuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in comparison to rituximab in 
combination with lenalidomide in patients with follicular lymphoma after at least one line of 
systemic therapy. 
2.6.8 Clinical safety 
Key safety summary tables are presented side by side for the following safety-evaluable patients (defined 
as  those  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  mosunetuzumab)  who  received  mosunetuzumab  IV 
monotherapy in Study GO29781 in the following order: 
●  All 33 patients with R/R NHL in Group A (Cycle 1 non-fractionated dosing [fixed dosing]) 
●  All 414 patients with R/R NHL in Group B (Cycle 1 step-up dosing) 
●  The  subgroup  of  218 patients  with  R/R  NHL  in  Group B  expansion  cohort  treated  at  the 
RP2D/intended  registration  dose  and  schedule  (1/2/60/30 mg;  hereinafter  referred  to  as 
B11 RP2D cohort)  
●  All 90 patients with R/R FL within the B11 RP2D cohort (hereinafter referred to as B11 FL RP2D 
cohort or B11 FL), which represent the patient population for the intended indication, R/R FL 
patients with ≥2 prior therapies, at the RP2D/intended registration dose and schedule  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 129/130 
 
  
 
 
The primary safety population of 218 patients with lymphoid malignancies (DLBCL, FL, MCL; in cohort 
B11)  having  received  the  RP2D  is  the  cohort  to  be  mainly  assessed.  Supportive  information  from  an 
additional 196 patients  having  received  for most patients  considerably  lower doses  in  group  B,  which 
have been added to the primary population, will be taken into consideration as well as results in the B11 
FL RP2D cohort.  
Table 26 Overview of mosunetuzumab intravenous monotherapy cohorts (Group A and B) of 
pivotal Study GO29781 contributing to safety evaluation  
2.6.8.1 Patient exposure 
Most patients in the B11 RP2D cohort received their planned doses of mosunetuzumab with a median 
dose intensity of 99.4% (range: 10–114) and 81.7% of patients achieved a dose intensity of >90%. The 
median duration of treatment of mosunetuzumab was 4.9 months (range 0.03-13.8), which corresponds 
approximately to the median of 8 x q3w cycles received.  
For the 90 patients in the B11 FL cohort the exposure was similar to the B11 RP2D cohort of 218 patients. 
One difference was the number of cycles received, which was higher in the FL population than in the 
entire B11 RP2D cohort (which includes the 90 FL patients): Forty-eight percent received <8 cycles in 
the entire cohort compared to 23% in the FL cohort whereas the corresponding number for 8 cycles were 
37% vs 59%. Correspondingly, the time on study was longer for the FL cohort compared to the entire 
B11 RP2D cohort; a median of 392 days compared to 348.5 days, respectively.  
Given the higher median cumulative dose and longer time on treatment in the B11 FL cohort compared 
to the entire B11 RP2D population, adverse events in this cohort will also be considered separately. 
Exposure for 6 months (corresponding to app. 8 cycles) and 1 year (approximately 17 cycles for patients 
who achieved a PR or maintained SD after 8 cycles) were seen for 79 and 13 patients in the primary 
EMA/390815/2022

safety population, respectively. The median observation time in cohort B11 RP2D was 14.3 months. The 
initial  CCOD  is  from  15th  March  2021;  an  updated  analysis  has  been  provided  with  CCOD  from  27th 
August 2021 (+24 weeks).

Serious adverse events 
Table 40/CSR includes deaths as part of the SAEs (32 patients including 28 patients with PD). Grade 5 
events occurred for all patients with progressive disease (53 in Group B and 28 in cohort B11 RP2D), 
and for 2 patients with pneumonia and 2 patients with sepsis in Group B of which one of each occurred 
in cohort B11 RP2D. 
In  the  B11  RP2D  cohort  75  patients  (34.4%)  had  at  least  one  SAE  that  was  assessed  as  related  to 
mosunetuzumab  by  the  investigator,  and  seven  patients  (3.2%)  had  mosunetuzumab  treatment 
withdrawn due to an SAE.  
CRS stands out as the SAE (and AE) with the highest incidence (21.6% by Lee 2014 grading).

Selected adverse events / Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) specific for mosunetuzumab (including but not limited to CRS) 
were defined based on evolving clinical experience with mosunetuzumab in clinical studies. 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
Per the protocol, investigators reported and graded CRS events according to the Lee 2014 grading criteria 
(Lee  et  al.  2014).  CRS  events  according  to  the  ASTCT  2019  grading  criteria  (Lee  et  al.  2019)  were 
derived  programmatically  from  the  reported  data  based  on  the  presence  of  fever  and  presence  and 
management of hypotension or hypoxia as reported in the CRS signs/symptoms eCRF. 
In the B11 RP2D cohort, the AE with highest frequency was CRS events (39.3% by ASTCT grading) which 
were predominantly Grade 1-2 (88/92), limited primarily to Cycle 1. CRS as SAEs were reported in 44/92 
(20.6%) patients (by ASTCT grading). All events resolved. According to the Applicant ASTCT 2019 grades 
could not be derived from 19 CRS events (10 Grade 1 events, 8 Grade 2 events, and 1 Grade 3 event) 
by Lee 2014 due to the lack of reported fever. Details of the Grade 2 and Grade 3 CRS events by Lee 
2014 that were not graded by ASTCT 2019 are presented below.  
No patient among the 410 patients in Group B died due to a CRS event (within 30 days of onset). With 
the updated safety data 2 additional Grade 1 CRS events in the cohort B11 RP2D occurred (CCOD: 27 
Aug 2021).

Among the 86 patients who experienced CRS in the B11 RP2D cohort (by ASTCT 2019), 14 patients had 
NAEs occurring concurrently with CRS events.  
Concurrent liver enzyme elevation events: 
Concurrent (with CRS) liver enzyme elevation events were seen in 4/92 patients by Lee 2014 and 3/84 
patients  by  ASTCT  2019  in  the  B11  RP2D  cohort  and  were  Grade  2-4  events.  All  CRS  events  with 
concurrent liver enzyme elevation events resolved.  
Neurologic Adverse Events (NAEs) 
NAEs were broadly defined as all AEs reported as primary or secondary PTs in either the SOC of Nervous 
System Disorders or SOC of Psychiatric Disorders.  
DI-CCNAEs (Driving-Impacting Cognition or Consciousness Neurologic Adverse Events) include a subset 
of  these  neurologic  AEs  with  the  following  PTs  that  the  Sponsor  adjudicated  as  potentially  impacting 
cognition,  consciousness,  and  ability  to  drive:  Amnesia,  aphasia,  cerebrovascular  accident,  cognitive 
disorder,  confusional  state,  delirium,  depressed  level  of  consciousness,  disturbance  in  attention, 
encephalopathy,  hallucination,  hallucination  visual,  hepatic  encephalopathy,  immune  effector  cell-
associated  neurotoxicity  syndrome,  lethargy,  memory  impairment,  neurotoxicity,  psychotic  disorder, 
seizure, somnolence, subdural haematoma, syncope, and vertigo.  
In cohort B11 RP2D, serious NAEs were reported in 14 patients (6.4%), and those reported in more than 
one patient were confusional state (3 patients; one Grade 3), subdural hematoma (2 patients; all Grade 
3), and neurotoxicity (2 patients; all Grade 2. The median time to onset of first NAEs was 15.0 days, 
with median duration of 5.0 days. The majority of the NAEs (188 of 244 events) had resolved at the 
cutoff date. Most of the unresolved NAEs were Grade 1-2 and three unresolved Grade 3 events could not 
safely be related to mosunetuzumab as there were several confounding factors.  
Twenty-six patients (11.9%) in cohort B11 RP2D experienced DI-CCNAEs of which 10 patients (4.6%) 
experienced serious DI-CCNAEs. The median duration was 3 days, but the range was 1-259 days.

Neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased were reported in 53 patients in cohort B11 RP2D 
(24.3%) with a comparable incidence for the B11 RP2D FL cohort (26.6%). A total of six serious infection 
events (including one death) in five patients (2.3%) occurred concurrently with neutropenia/neutrophil 
count decreased events (including febrile neutropenia events) in the B11 RP2D cohort.

Thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased: 
A  total  of  26  events  under  the  grouped  terms  of  thrombocytopenia/platelet  count  decreased  were 
reported in 25 of 218 patients (11.5%) in the B11 RP2D cohort.  
A total of 15 bleeding events in 15 patients (3.6%) in Group B, with 9 events reported in the B11 RP2D 
cohort, occurred concurrently with thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased events.  
Nine bleeding events (4.1%) occurred in nine patients with thrombocytopenia in the B11 RP2D cohort.  
Eight of 25 patients (32.0%) in the B11 RP2D cohort who had thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased 
events received platelet transfusion. Nine bleeding events (all events were anaemia) in 9 patients (4.1%) 
in the B11 RP2D cohort occurred concurrently with thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased events; 
all bleeding events were anemia. These anaemia events were of severity Grade 1 (4 events) and Grade 
3 (5 events).   
Haemorrhagic events were observed in 6% of patients. The majority of events were Grade 1-2 and non-
serious. Grade 3 and serious adverse events were reported in 1.2% of patients and 1.0% of patients, 
EMA/390815/2022

respectively. Three were CNS events (subdural hematoma in two patients, cerebrovascular accident in 
one patient) and one was an upper GI-bleeding in a patient with PD and in treatment with apixaban.  
No fatal or life-threatening events have been reported.

No DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) events were reported in patients in Group A and Group 
B. 
Anaemia: 
A total of 42 events under the grouped terms of anemia/hemoglobin decreased were reported in 33 of 
218 patients (15.1%) in the B11 RP2D cohort. All events were reported as the PT of anemia. 
The incidence of anaemia was comparable between the Group B, B11 RP2D, and B11 RP2D FL cohorts 
(16.4%, 15.1%, and 13.3%, respectively).  
Thirteen of 33 patients (39.4%) in the B11 RP2D cohort who had anemia AEs received RBC transfusion.

HLH  events  were  reported  in  3  patients  receiving  mosunetuzumab  IV  monotherapy  as  of  the  CCOD, 
including 1 of 33 patients (3.0%) in Group A and 2 of 414 patients (0.5%) in Group B (one of which was 
in the B11 RP2D cohort).  
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Two TLS events were reported in 2 patients in the B11 RP2D cohort. Both events (Grade 4 event in a 
patient with R/R FL and Grade 3 event in a patient with R/R MCL) were assessed as serious and preceded 
by a CRS event on the prior study day. Both patients had received allopurinol prophylaxis, and the TLS 
events resolved with no change in mosunetuzumab dose. 
No TLS events were reported in other cohorts in Group B or in Group A. 
TLS is satisfactorily described in the SmPC in sections 4.4 and 4.8.  
Tumour Flare 
Tumour flare events were identified by PT of tumour flare, as suspected tumour flare events, or by AESI 
Grade ≥2 tumour flare/tumour inflammation specific for mosunetuzumab.

Hepatic Adverse Events 
Hepatic AEs were identified by the High-Level Term of liver function analyses or PTs of ALT increased, 
AST increased, bilirubin increased, hyperbilirubinemia, blood bilirubin increased, amylase increased, 
and hyperamylasemia. In cohort B11 RP2D a total of 29 of 218 patients (13.3%) experienced 61 
hepatic AEs following initial treatment with mosunetuzumab. Patients in Group B who potentially 
fulfilled Hy’s law criteria for liver laboratory abnormalities and were assessed for potential DILI are 
addressed in the Laboratory findings section. Study GO29781 excluded patients with known hepatitis 
B.

There is a relatively high incidence of transaminase/bilirubin increases overall in B11 RP2D cohort; per 
NCI CTCAE classification, a Grade 2 or above transaminase is increase in >3X ULN, similar as the limit 
per Hy’s law; for bilirubin the threshold of >2XULN is included as from Grade 2 or above. There are 17 
patients in B11 RP2D who had Grade 2 or above increase in liver parameters.  
Patients in Group B who fulfilled Hy’s law criteria for liver laboratory abnormalities and were assessed 
for potential DILI are addressed in the Laboratory findings section.

Haematology 
The most frequent (≥5% of patients) treatment-emergent Grade ≥3 worsening haematological 
laboratory parameter shifts in the B11 RP2D cohort were decreases in lymphocytes (the 
pharmacodynamic action of mosunetuzumab to deplete B-cells), neutrophils, leukocytes, hemoglobin, 
and platelets and are consistent with AE reporting of decreased neutropenia/neutrophil count, 
anemia/hemoglobin decreased, and thrombocytopenia.  
The treatment-emergent haematological laboratory parameter shifts in the B11 FL cohort were similar 
to those reported in the B11 RP2D cohort.

The treatment-emergent chemistry laboratory abnormalities in the B11 FL cohort were similar to those 
reported in the B11 RP2D cohort (see table above).   
Hy’s Law:  
At least three patients experienced hepatotoxicity, which later resolved, in conjunction with CRS in Cycle 
1.

The safety profile is comparable across the age groups. There is limited experience with mosunetuzumab 
in patients >85 years of age. 
Race:  
The two main cohorts by  race in Group B  were White [317 patients (77.3%)] and Asian [67 patients 
(16.3%)]. In the B11 RP2D cohort 23/214 patients (10.7%) were Asian and in the B11 FL cohort 8/90 
(8.9%) were Asian (Table 10/uCSR, Exposure section). The only Asian country that took part in the study 
was the Republic of Korea, which recruited 7 patients in Group A (7/33) and 50/410 in Group B (which 
means  that  17  Asian  patients  in  Group  B  must  have  come  from  Western  countries).  The  difference 
between SAEs (excluding Grade 5 PD) for Whites and Asians seem quite remarkable [136/317 (42.9%) 
and 14/67 (20.9%)].

Prior CAR-T therapy:  
In cohort B11 FL only 3 patients had received prior CAR-T therapy. All adverse events (AEs, SAEs, PD, 
Grade 3-4 AEs) were seen more frequently in patients having received CAR-T therapy.    
2.6.8.7 Immunological events 
As  of  the  ADA  data  cutoff  date  of  4  December  2020,  no  ADAs  have  been  detected  in  serum  samples 
collected at any assessment timepoint from 418 ADA-evaluable patients who received mosunetuzumab 
IV monotherapy treatments in Study GO29781. (See the Clinical Pharmacology section).  
2.6.8.8 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Physiologically-based  pharmacokinetics  (PBPK)  modeling  and  simulations  based  on  IL-6  and  CYP3A4 
interaction  indicated  a  low  risk  of  cytokine-mediated  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  potential  of 
mosunetuzumab on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme expression or activity (PBPK Report No.1110241).  
The predicted area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) ratios 
(with  mosunetuzumab  coadministration/without  mosunetuzumab  coadministration)  for  midazolam,  a 
sensitive CYP3A substrate was 1.37 and 1.37, respectively. No dose adjustment is recommended when 
co-dosing  mosunetuzumab  with  small  molecule  drugs  which  are  CYP3A  substrates  (See  the  Clinical 
Pharmacology section for an assessment of drug-drug interactions). 
2.6.8.9 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
B11 RP2D Cohort 
Overall, 9 of 218 patients (4.1%) in the B11 RP2D cohort discontinued mosunetuzumab due to AEs. 
CRS was the only AEs that led to discontinuation in more than one patient (2 patients; 0.9%).  
Overall, 73 of 218 patients (33.5%) in the B11 RP2D cohort had a dose interruption or modification 
of mosunetuzumab due to AEs. Adverse events that led to dose interruption or modification of mosunetuzumab and 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 163/164 
 
 
  
 
 
 
occurred  in  ≥2%  of  patients  in  the  B11  RP2D  cohort  were  neutropenia/neutrophil  count  decreased  (25  patients 
[11.5%]) and CRS (19 patients [8.7%] by Lee 2014 grading criteria; 17 patients [7.8%] by ASTCT 2019 
grading criteria). 
Serious  adverse  events  led  to  mosunetuzumab  dose  modification  in  3  patients  (1.4%)  and 
mosunetuzumab dose interruption in 32 patients (14.7%) in the B11 RP2D cohort.  
2.6.8.10 Post marketing experience 
Mosunetuzumab has not been approved for use anywhere in the world; therefore, no postmarketing data 
regarding its use are currently available. 
2.6.9 Discussion on clinical safety 
The  primary  safety  population  of  214  patients  is  the  B11  RP2D  cohort  with  lymphoid  malignancies 
(DLBCL,  FL,  MCL)  of  which  90  patients  had  follicular  lymphoma.  Supportive  information  from  an 
additional 196 patients having received for most patients considerably lower doses in Group B, which 
have been added to the primary population (N=410), has been taken into consideration. Updated safety 
data  with  the  addition  of  4  patients  with  Richter’s  transformation  (B11  RP2D  cohort  n=218)  and  an 
additional 24 weeks of safety data have generally been included in the assessment report but have not 
led to any changes in the assessment of safety.  
Safety data in patients in the intended indication is limited to 90 patients; it is unknown to what extent 
the  safety  information  in  Group  A  and  Group  B  (all  cohorts)  is  applicable  for  the  intended  indication. 
Although dataset B11 RP2D cohort (n=218) includes more patients and could provide more information 
on mosunetuzumab safety, it is noted that a significant proportion of the patients in this dataset have a 
different disease than the intended indication. Patients had follicular lymphoma (41.3%), diffuse large 
B-cell  lymphoma/transformed  follicular  lymphoma  (40.4%)  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (11.5%),  Richter’s 
transformation  (6.4%),  and  other  histologies  (0.5%).    The  median  number  of  cycles  of  Lunsumio 
received was  8  (range  1  -17),  37%  of  patients  received  8 cycles,  and  15%  received  more  than 
8 cycles up to 17 cycles. This information is included in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Exposure for 6 months (corresponding to app. 8 cycles) and 1 year (approximately 17 cycles for patients 
who achieved a PR or maintained SD after 8 cycles) were seen for 79 and 13 patients in the primary 
safety  population,  respectively.  The  median  observation  time  in  cohort  B11  RP2D  was  14.3  months 
(updated safety data), and thus long-term safety is missing. The Applicant has accepted to include this 
as Missing information in the RMP ‘Summary of safety concerns’ table. This is also in line with the FU 
advice given by EMA.  
Exposure-safety: Grade ≥2 CRS was identified as an exposure- and regimen-dependent AE where the 
administration of mosunetuzumab following the step-up dosing regimen was associated with a relatively 
low frequency but ROmax-dependent increase of Grade ≥2 CRS transiently during Cycle 1 following the 
60 mg dose administration on Day 15.  The occurrence of Grade ≥3 CRS frequency was <3%. 
The key cancer history characteristics of the B11 RP2D cohort and the B11 FL were generally consistent 
with  the  overall  Group  B  population  (Table  11/CSR).  One  third  had  bulky  disease  (>  6  cm)  and 
approximately half of the patients had Ann Arbor stage IV disease. In the B11 FL cohort, 18.9% had 
previously received PI3K inhibitor treatment, while 53.3% were doubly refractory to anti-CD20/alkylator 
therapy. A total of 47/90 patients (52.2%) experienced progression of disease in less than 24 months 
from the start of first systemic therapy. All FL patients had received at least two prior therapies (median 
of three) and had received both alkylator- and anti-CD20-therapy according to protocol.  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 164/165 
 
 
  
 
 
In  the  primary  safety  population  of  214  patients  at  the  CCOD  of  15  March  2021,  almost  all  patients 
(97.7%)  treated  with  mosunetuzumab  IV  monotherapy  by  step-up  dosing  in  cohort  B11  RP2D 
experienced at least one AE. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the most commonly observed event 
(43.0% of patients based on Lee 2014 grading criteria and 39.3% by ASTCT 2019 grading criteria.  
Other  common  AEs (≥20% incidence by PT) in cohort B11 RP2D were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased, 
fatigue, hypophosphatemia, and pyrexia. Most AEs were Grade 1 or 2 severity except for neutropenia/neutrophil count 
decreased.  Grade  3-4  AEs  were  reported  in  64.6% of  patients  in  cohort  B11  RP2D.  The  most  frequent  Grade  3-4 
events (≥5% incidence) were cytopenias (neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased and anemia/hemoglobin decreased) 
and hypophosphatemia.  
Neutropenia  is  a  well-known  AE  for  anti-CD20  Abs  and  is  observed  with  comparable  frequency  for 
mosunetuzumab: Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased were reported in 53 patients in 
cohort B11 RP2D (24.3%) with a comparable incidence for the B11 RP2D FL cohort (26.6%).  
A total of 48 of 60 patients (68%) in cohort B11 RP2D and B11 FL who had neutropenia/neutrophil count 
decreased events received treatment with G-CSF to treat the events. This information is presented in 
the SmPC, which is satisfactory.  Serious infections is included as an Identified risk in the RMP (see RMP). 
Six deaths in Group B (1.5%), of which four occurred in cohort B11 RP2D (1.9%), were due to AEs that 
were not PD. Five of these were due to infections, which is not considered unexpected in this population.  
Serious AEs were reported in 50.9% of patients in cohort B11 RP2D, the most frequent being CRS (22.0% of patients 
based on the Lee 2014 grading criteria and 20.6% by ASTCT 2019 grading criteria, predominantly Grade 1-2 events 
that required hospitalization). Other SAEs reported at a frequency of ≥ 2% were pyrexia (4.2%, predominantly Grade 1-
2, and did not occur concurrently with CRS), and pneumonia (3.3%).  
At the CCOD of 27 August 2021, adverse events in the B11 RP2D cohort infrequently led to treatment 
discontinuation (4.1%). CRS was the only AEs that led to discontinuation in more than one patient (2 
patients;  0.9%).  Overall,  73  of  218  patients  (33.5%)  in  the  B11  RP2D  cohort  had  a  dose  interruption  or 
modification  of  mosunetuzumab  due  to  AEs.  Adverse  events  that  led  to  dose  interruption  or  modification  of 
mosunetuzumab and occurred in ≥2% of patients in the B11 RP2D cohort were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased 
(25 patients [11.5%]) and CRS (19 patients [8.7%] by Lee 2014 grading criteria; 17 patients [7.8%] by 
ASTCT 2019 grading criteria).  
Study  GO29781  excluded  patients  with  known  hepatitis  B.  Anti-CD20  antibodies  are  known  to  cause 
reactivation  of  hepatitis  B  in  some  patients.  Information  regarding  exclusion  of  hepatitis  B-positive 
patients is presented in the SmPC, section 5.1.    
In cohort B11 RP2D a total of 29 of 218 patients (13.3%) experienced 58 hepatic AEs following initial 
treatment with mosunetuzumab. ALT elevation is listed as Very common, whereas AST elevation is listed 
as Common in the ADR table in the SmPC, section 4.8.  
The majority of the AESIs were of Grade 1-2 maximum severity, with exception of 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events, which were most frequently reported at Grade 3-4 
severity, and anemia/hemoglobin decreased events, for which approximately half of the events were 
Grade 3. Grade 3-4 neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events were infrequently associated with 
serious infections. Serious infections such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and sepsis or septic shock have 
occurred in patients receiving Lunsumio, some of which were life-threatening or fatal events (see 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Febrile neutropenia was observed after receiving Lunsumio infusion. 
A warning has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding live and/or live-attenuated vaccines 
that should not be given concurrently with Lunsumio.   
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 165/166 
 
 
  
 
 
CRS  events  in  the  overall  Group  B  as  well  as  cohort  B11  RP2D  were  predominantly  Grade  1  or  2  in 
severity and limited primarily to Cycle 1 with decreasing frequencies in the subsequent treatment cycles. 
Within Cycle 1, CRS events were most frequently associated with Day 1 and Day 15 dose administrations 
with the highest frequency of events observed following the Day 15 administration.  Twenty-two percent 
were graded as SAEs as they required hospitalisation.  
The Applicant was requested to present and discuss the risk of CRS as a function of bone marrow 
involvement (including various degrees of BM involvement) given that there were less CRS in DLBCL 
patients (although some of these were trFL patients), who usually have less BM involvement, and that 
9/10 of patients with Richter’s transformation developed CRS, suggesting that BM involvement (and 
most likely circulating tumour lymphocytes as in CLL) is a predictor for CRS. High tumour burden is 
considered a risk for CRS in patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy (EBMT and JACIE Guideline). Based 
on the Applicant’s multi-variate analysis of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk, bone marrow (BM) 
involvement and baseline tumour burden are not expected to be significant prognostic factors for 
mosunetuzumab-related Grade ≥2 CRS. Given the limited information regarding a possible correlation 
between bone marrow involvement and the risk of CRS, the data is inconclusive and thus not included 
in the PI.  
Patients developing CRS had quite a range of time to onset and duration, which the treating physician 
needs to consider. This has been adequately described in the SmPC, sections 4.4 and  4.8. 
CRS events were managed with steroids, antihistamines and paracetamol (obligatory for Cycle 1 and 2) 
and for some events supplied with tocilizumab (25.0% of patients in cohort B11 RP2D with CRS events 
by ASTCT 2019 grade), oxygen administration (21.8%), and vasopressors (6.0%), and were reversible, 
as evidenced by resolution of all CRS events. 
Obligatory  premedication  for  cycle  1  and  2  included  steroids,  paracetamol  and  antihistamine.  Of  218 
patients in the B11 RP2D cohort 23 patients (10.6%) received tocilizumab. In the SmPC the Applicant 
has provided guidance for the grading and management of CRS, which is considered satisfactory.  
The  prescriber  must  discuss  the  risks  of  Lunsumio  therapy  with  the  patient.  The  patient  should  be 
provided  with  the  patient  card  and  instructed  to  carry  it  at  all  times.  The  patient  card  describes  the 
common signs and symptoms of CRS, and provides instructions on when a patient should seek medical 
attention (see Annex II and RMP). 
Neurologic AEs (NAEs) were broadly defined as all AEs reported as primary or secondary PTs in either 
the SOC of Nervous System Disorders or SOC of Psychiatric Disorders and were observed in 122/218 
patients in cohort B11 RP2D. Serious NAEs were reported in 14 patients (6.4%). SAEs reported in more 
than one patient were confusional state (3 patients; one Grade 3), subdural hematoma (2 patients; all 
Grade 3), and neurotoxicity (2 patients; all Grade 2)..  
Twenty-six patients (11.9%) in cohort B11 RP2D experienced DI-CCNAEs (Driving-Impacting Cognition 
or  Consciousness  Neurologic  Adverse  Events)  of  which  10  patients  (4.6%)  experienced  serious  DI-
CCNAEs. The median duration was 3 days, but the range was 1-259 days. In the SmPC, section 4.7 the 
following is stated: Patients who experience events that impair consciousness should be evaluated and 
advised not to drive and refrain from operating heavy or potentially dangerous machines until events 
are resolved, which is considered satisfactory. 
A  total  of  9  of  218patients  (4.1%)  experienced  tumour  flare  events  following  initial  treatment  with 
mosunetuzumab. Tumour flare is described in the SmPC in sections 4.4 and 4.8 and is included in the 
RMP Summary of safety concerns table as an Important identified risk. Manifestations included new or 
worsening  pleural  effusions,  localised  pain  and  swelling  at  the  sites  of  lymphoma  lesions  and  tumour 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 166/167 
 
 
  
 
 
 
inflammation. Consistent with the mechanism of action of Lunsumio, tumour flare is likely due to the 
influx of T-cells into tumour sites following Lunsumio administration. 
There  are  no  specific  risk  factors  for  tumour  flare  that  have  been  identified,  however,  there  is  a 
heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients 
with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. (see section 4.4 of the 
SmPC).  
Patients treated with Lunsumio should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical 
sites. Only two tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) events were reported in 2 patients in the B11 RP2D cohort. 
TLS is described in the SmPC.  
The nature, severity, and frequency of AEs reported by patients who received mosunetuzumab at RP2D 
in the B11 RP2D cohort was similar to the overall Group B with a generally consistent proportion across 
AE  categories  among  the  four  histology-specific  cohorts  of  FL,  DLBCL/trFL,  MCL,  and  Richter’s 
transformation. 
The two main cohorts by  race in Group B  were White [317 patients (77.3%)] and Asian [67 patients 
(16.3%)]. The only Asian country that took part in the study were the Republic of Korea, which recruited 
7 patients in Group A (7/33) and 50/410 in Group B. Fatal AEs (including PD) were 51/317 (16.1%) vs 
0/67, for Whites vs Asians, respectively. The difference between SAEs (excluding Grade 5 PD) for Whites 
and  Asians  seem  quite  remarkable  [136/317  (42.9%)  and  14/67  (20.9%)].  The  percentage  of  Asian 
patients was low, and there were differences in baseline and disease characteristics with Asian patients 
being generally younger, and with less tumor burden. This may at least to some degree explain the lower 
incidence  of  serious  AEs  (including  deaths)  reported  in  Asian  compared  to  non-Asian  patients.  The 
Applicant  states  that  the  difference  in  AE  reporting  between  Asian  and  non-Asian  patients  cannot  be 
explained by differences in mosunetuzumab PK exposure: The impact of Asian race on mosunetuzumab 
PK was tested in covariate analyses of a popPK model that has been developed from PK observations 
from patients treated with mosunetuzumab intravenous (IV) monotherapy in Study GO29781. Asian race 
was not shown to be a significant covariate.   
Overall deaths and SAEs were reported in a higher proportion of patients who previously received CAR-
T therapy (N=48 in Group B) compared with those who had not received prior CAR-T therapy (N=362); 
in  cohort  B11  FL  only  3  patients  had  received  prior  CAR-T  therapy.  It  is  agreed  with  the  Applicant, 
though,  that  patients  with  prior  CAR-T  therapy  included  in  this  analysis  appeared  to  have  more 
aggressive NHL histology, heavier disease burden, worse ECOG PS at baseline, and more prior therapies 
received. The differences and variances in baseline characteristics likely confounded the observed safety 
profile, and the differences seen in the subgroups could not be attributed to prior CAR-T therapy alone. 
Based on the imbalances in baseline characteristics, the small sample sizes and exploratory nature of 
these analyses, no firm conclusions can be made regarding differences in the safety profile of patients 
who received prior CAR-T therapy compared to those who did not. Therefore, it is accepted not to include 
any  information  regarding  potential  risk  to  patients  having  received  prior  CAR-T  cell  therapy  into  the 
SmPC. Based on the uncertainty due to few patients, the Applicant has agreed to add ‘Safety in patients 
with  prior  CAR-T  therapy’  as  Missing  information  in  the  Summary  of  safety  concerns  in  the  Risk 
Management Plan. No ADAs to mosunetuzumab were detected in the ADA-evaluable patients in Group 
B.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Not applicable.  
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Given the relatively small safety population (214 in B11 RP2D at the CCOD of 15 March 2021; 90 of 
these with FL), the single-arm design and the short follow-up, additional safety data will be needed to 
address uncertainties such as known risks for other monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 on B-cells 
and/or CD3 on T-cells, the long-term safety; median observation time of 14.3 months in the B11 RP2D 
cohort, safety in patients with prior CAR-T therapy and adverse events were seen more frequently 
(e.g. serious infections).  
A confirmatory phase III study evaluating PFS is considered necessary and has recently commenced: 
Study GO42909: A randomized Phase III trial of mosunetuzumab plus lenalidomide (M+Len) versus 
rituximab plus lenalidomide (R+Len) in patients with R/R FL after at least one prior systemic therapy 
regimen (Study GO42909).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10 Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Generally,  the  adverse  events  are  manageable;  in  particular  the  risk  of  cytokine  release  syndrome 
requires careful training of hospital staff in relation to observation and management and furthermore 
easy access to an ICU. Risk minimisation measures including a patient card have been agreed (see Annex 
II and RMP).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data (in particular 
long-term safety) in the context of a conditional MA: 
In order to provide further evidence of safety of mosunetuzumab in follicular lymphoma, the MAH will 
provide  results  from  Study  GO42909,  a  randomised,  open-label,  multicentre  trial  evaluating 
mosunetuzumab  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  in  comparison  to  rituximab  in  combination  with 
lenalidomide in patients with follicular lymphoma after at least one line of systemic therapy. The Applicant 
has commenced recruitment in study GO42909 (see Annex II).

2.7.4 Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable. 
2.8 Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1 Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2 Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
{EBD} to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9 Product information 
2.9.1 User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2 Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lunsumio (mosunetuzumab) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3. Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1 Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1 Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is “Lunsumio as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.   
3.1.2 Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients with FL who relapse after or are refractory to initial therapy, treatment decisions take into 
consideration  efficacy  and  DOR  of  prior  therapy,  stage  of  disease  and  tumour  burden  at  relapse,  the 
presence of symptoms, and the age and comorbidities of the patient. 
Patients who have received ≥2 prior therapies are associated with particularly poor prognosis, with a 
median PFS ranging from 1-1.1 years for third-line patients decreasing to 0.5 years for sixth-line patients 
with a corresponding median OS of 4.8-8.8 years and 1.9 years, respectively (Alperovich et al. 2016; 
Rivas-Delgado  et  al.  2019;  Batlevi  et  al.  2020).  For  these  patients  there  is  no  treatment  considered 
standard of care, and options vary widely. Therefore, there is a high unmet need. 
3.1.3 Main clinical studies 
Study GO29781 was an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/Ib (Phase I/II per protocol v12) trial evaluating 
the safety, efficacy, and PK of escalating doses of mosunetuzumab (BTCT4465A) as a single agent and 
combined with atezolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Interim Analysis (CCOD 27 August 2021). 
Of  the  152  patients  in  the  Group  B  FL  cohort,  90  patients  in  Group  B11  had  received  the  RP2D  of 
1/2/60/30 mg mosunetuzumab IV monotherapy as initial treatment during the dose expansion stage in 
this single-arm trial and are the main efficacy population corresponding to the indication sought.   
3.2 Favourable effects 
At the cut-off date of 27 Aug 2021, in the main efficacy cohort B11 FL RP2D the CR (by IRF) was 60.0% 
(95% CI: 49.1, 70.2) and for the supportive cohort B7 (FL), which received a lower dose, the CR rate 
45.7% (95% CI: 30.9, 61.0), compared to 14% CR rate from historical controls for both cohorts.  
The  secondary  endpoints  support  the  primary  endpoint:  Agreement  between  IRF-  and  investigator-
assessed response on whether a patient achieved a CR was high: 93.3% (83/89).  
The  results  of  the  secondary  endpoints  in  the  B7  FL  interim  dose  cohort  receiving  the  lower  dose  of 
1/2/13.5 mg were slightly lower than in the B11 FL cohort and are generally thought to support efficacy.   
Of the 54 patients in the B11 FL RP2D cohort who achieved a CR as assessed by the IRF, 16 patients 
(29.6%)  subsequently  had  disease  progression  by  the  time  of  the  CCOD.  The  median DOCR  was  not 
estimable (Table 14/CSR). The K-M estimated event-free rates among complete responders at 12 months 
and 18 months after the first complete response were 71.4% and 63.7%, respectively. The median DOR 
is 22.8 months (95% CI: 9.7, NE). Among responders, the event-free rates at 12 and 18 months after 
the first response were 61.8% and 56.9%, respectively.  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 173/174 
 
 
  
 
 
At the CCOD of 15 March 2021, data were immature in an indolent disease like FL with a median follow-
up for DOR of 10.3 months with the proposed dosing regimen (1/2/60/30 mg). Therefore, updated data 
has been provided (CCOD of 27 Aug 2021), which confirmed the initial results. 
3.3 Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  sample  size  with  the  intended  dosing  regimen  was  limited,  with  90  patients  with  r/r  FL  having 
received ≥2 prior lines of therapy.  
Given the limitations associated with the uncontrolled single-arm design of the pivotal study and that 
the primary endpoint, CRR, is not an established surrogate endpoint in r/r FL, sufficiently mature DOR 
data are important.  
The  efficacy  results  with  mosunetuzumab  monotherapy  have  been  contextualized  through  cross-trial 
indirect  comparisons  with  alternative  approved  and  unapproved  therapies  identified  in  a  systematic 
literature  review.  Cross-trial  comparisons  are  however  associated  with  well-known  limitations,  mainly 
related  to  differences  in  study  populations,  especially  in  the  r/r  FL  patient  population,  which  are 
characterized  by  heterogeneity  in  terms  of  disease  course,  treatment  history  and  prognosis. 
Contextualization of efficacy results is further hampered by the lack of an external real-world control, 
which would have partially overcome these limitations.  
As  discussed  above  the  results  from  a  single-arm  trial  are  generally  associated  with  a  number  of 
uncertainties, for this reason a conditional marketing authorisation is recommended with an appropriate 
specific obligation to submit the results from an ongoing phase III study (see section 4 and RMP).  
3.4 Unfavourable effects 
At the CCOD of 15 March 2021, the primary safety population of 214 patients is the B11 RP2D cohort 
with lymphoid malignancies (DLBCL, FL, MCL) of which 90 patients had follicular lymphoma. 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the most commonly observed event (43.0% of patients based on 
Lee 2014 grading criteria and 39.3% by ASTCT 2019 grading criteria). CRS events were predominantly 
Grade 1 or 2 severity (36.4% by ASTCT 2019 grade), and limited primarily to Cycle 1, particularly D1 
and  D15.  All  CRS  events  resolved.  CRS  events  were  managed  with  steroids,  antihistamines  and 
paracetamol  (obligatory  for  Cycle  1  and  2)  and  for  some  events  supplied  with  tocilizumab  (25.0%  of 
patients in cohort B11 RP2D with CRS events by ASTCT 2019 grade), oxygen administration (21.8%), 
and vasopressors (6.0%), and were reversible, as evidenced by resolution of all CRS events. Twenty-
two percent were graded as SAEs as they required hospitalisation.  
Other  common  AEs  (≥20%  incidence  by  PT)  in  cohort  B11  RP2D  were  neutropenia/neutrophil  count 
decreased,  fatigue,  hypophosphatemia,  and  pyrexia.  Most  AEs  were  Grade  1  or  2  severity  except  for 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased. Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 64.6% of patients in cohort 
B11  RP2D.  The  most 
frequent  Grade  3-4  events 
(≥5% 
incidence)  were  cytopenias 
(neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased and anemia/hemoglobin decreased) and hypophosphatemia.  
Neurologic AEs (NAEs) were broadly defined as all AEs reported as primary or secondary PTs in either 
the SOC of Nervous System Disorders or SOC of Psychiatric Disorders and were observed in 119/214 
patients in cohort B11 RP2D. Serious NAEs were reported in 21 patients (5.1%). SAEs reported in more 
than  one  patient  were  confusional  state  (4  patients;  one  Grade  3),  encephalopathy,  syncope,  and 
subdural hematoma (2 patients each; all Grade 3), and neurotoxicity and herpes zoster (2 patients each; 
all Grade 2.  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 174/175 
 
 
  
 
 
Twenty-five patients (11.7%) in cohort B11 RP2D experienced DI-CCNAEs (Driving-Impacting Cognition 
or Consciousness Neurologic Adverse Events) of which 10 (4.7%) were SAEs. The median duration was 
3 days, but the range was 1-259 days.   
A  total  of  9  of  214  patients  (4.2%)  experienced  tumour  flare  events  following  initial  treatment  with 
mosunetuzumab (see SmPC and RMP Summary of safety concerns). 
Overall deaths and SAEs were reported in a higher proportion of patients who previously received CAR-
T therapy (N=48 in Group B) compared with those who had not received prior CAR-T therapy (N=362), 
and Safety in patients with prior CAR-T therapy has been included as Missing information in the Summary 
of safety concerns in the RMP.  
In cohort B11 RP2D 46.7% of patients experienced 174 infection adverse events many of which were 
related  to  the  respiratory  system.  SAEs  were  reported  in  35  patients  (16.4%),  with  pneumonia  (7 
patients [3.3%]) being the most frequent (see RMP). 
3.5 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Given the relatively small safety population (214 in B11 RP2D; 90 of these with FL), the short follow-
up and known risks for other monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 on B-cells and/or CD3 on T-cells, 
several uncertainties remain, such as long-term safety; median observation time of 14.3 months in the 
B11 RP2D cohort, Safety in patients with prior CAR-T therapy and adverse events were seen more 
frequently (e.g. serious infections).  
Furthermore, given the uncertainties of a single-arm trial, a conditional marketing authorisation is 
recommended and the specific obligation a confirmatory phase III study that has recently commenced 
(Study GO42909 - A randomized Phase III trial of mosunetuzumab plus lenalidomide (M+Len) versus 
rituximab plus lenalidomide (R+Len) in patients with R/R FL after at least one prior systemic therapy 
regimen) will provide missing long term safety data.

3.7 Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is an unmet need for patients with R/R FL who have received ≥2 prior therapies, particularly for 
patients who are R/R to different classes of agents are left with limited treatment options that may have 
challenging safety profiles. 
Results from the single-arm trial GO029781 are encouraging with a high proportion of patients with CR. 
Consistent response rates were also observed for subgroups with anticipated poor prognosis. Obtaining 
a CR, which is the disappearance of all measurable evidence of disease, can be considered relevant for 
the  patient  and  indicates  clinically  meaningful  favourable  effect.  Results  from  secondary  endpoints 
support  the  primary  endpoint,  in  particular  high  ORR  and  durability  of  responses,  which  are  likely  to 
translate into an overall survival benefit. 
Most important safety concerns are CRS, serious infections, and tumour flare. The adverse events are 
generally manageable and acceptable in this disease population.  
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 176/177 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indirect comparisons provided support the contextualization of the mosunetuzumab efficacy and safety 
results. Further, mosunetuzumab provides a novel MoA, has a potential therapeutic advantage 
compared to available treatments, provides clinically meaningful ORR, CR and DOR, while having a 
clinically manageable safety profile. 
3.7.2 Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of mosunetuzumab monotherapy in FL patients who have received ≥2 prior systemic 
therapies is considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3 Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The Applicant has provided an overview of efficacy and safety results for therapies for follicular 
lymphoma patients having received at least 2 prior therapies. The proportion of patients who achieved 
CR and the durability of responses for patients with R/R FL ≥2 prior therapies treated with 
mosunetuzumab compare to the results of CAR-T therapy (i.e. axicabtagene ciloleucel). Overall, these 
indirect comparisons support the contextualization of the mosunetuzumab efficacy and safety results 
and suggest that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks in this 
patient population with high unmet need. 
Based on the single-arm trial design of the study, the clinical data are not considered comprehensive. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As  comprehensive  data  on  the  product  are  not  available  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission.  
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing  authorisations,  as  it  aims  at  the  treatment  of  a  life-threatening  disease.  In  addition,  the 
product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
The product is considered to fulfil the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: 
●  The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
● 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data: by providing results from a 
phase III study within a reasonable timeframe to confirm efficacy (and safety); the Applicant has 
recently commenced recruitment in study GO42909.  
●  Unmet  medical  needs  will  be  addressed:  Patients  who  have  received  ≥2  prior  therapies  are 
associated with particularly poor prognosis, with a median PFS ranging from 1-1.1 years for third-
line patients decreasing to 0.5 years for sixth-line patients with a corresponding median OS of 4.8-
8.8 years and 1.9 years, respectively. For these patients there is no treatment considered standard 
of care, and options vary widely (see ESMO recommendations under Introduction). 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: Given the positive benefit risk profile and the poor prognosis in R/R 
FL patients having received at least two prior systemic therapies, the benefit to public health is 
considered to outweigh the risks. 
Based on the single-arm trial design of the study, the clinical data are not considered comprehensive. 
The following measures are necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a 
conditional MA: 
EMA/390815/2022  
Page 177/178 
 
 
  
 
 
In order to provide further evidence of efficacy and safety of mosunetuzumab in follicular lymphoma, 
the MAH will provide Study GO42909, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial evaluating 
mosunetuzumab in combination with lenalidomide in comparison to rituximab in combination with 
lenalidomide in patients with follicular lymphoma after at least one line of systemic therapy.  
3.8 Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Lunsumio as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior 
systemic therapies.   
is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section ‘Recommendations’. 
4. Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Lunsumio is not similar to Gazyvaro within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Lunsumio is favourable in the following indication: 
Lunsumio  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory 
follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.   
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

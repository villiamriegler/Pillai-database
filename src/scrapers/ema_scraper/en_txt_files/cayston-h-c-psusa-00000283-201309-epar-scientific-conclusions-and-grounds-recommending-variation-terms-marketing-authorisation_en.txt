Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for aztreonam lysine nebuliser 
solution (Cayston), the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
• 
The sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC of Cayston state: “The following rare and severe adverse 
reactions have not been observed to date with Cayston, but have been reported after 
parenteral use of other aztreonam containing products: toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
anaphylaxis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, petechiae, 
pruritus, diaphoresis.” 
In the periods covered by this as well as previous PSURs, several reports of pruritus, urticaria, 
and erythema have been received in relation to Cayston. Therefore, the MAH is requested to 
amend the aforementioned statement in the sections 4.4 and 4.8 as follows:  
“The following rare and severe adverse reactions  have not been observed to date with 
Cayston, but have been reported after parenteral use of other aztreonam containing products: 
toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, 
urticaria, petechiae, pruritus, diaphoresis.”  
In the next PSUR: 
• 
• 
• 
The MAH is requested to provide a brief clinical evaluation of new cases regarding 
hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, urticaria, erythema nodosum, etc.) that are not listed in 
the EU-SmPC, under the PSUR section “new information on important potential risks” to assist 
the assessment process.  
The MAH is requested to continue to report on fatal cases and the reporting trend for fatal 
outcomes in the future PSUR periods.  
The MAH is requested to regard the dizziness as an on-going signal and to re-evaluate it in the 
next PSUR.  
The next PSUR (covering one year period) for Cayston should be submitted in accordance with the 
requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 
107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for aztreonam the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance aztreonam is favourable 
subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Nausea  and  vomiting  are  recognized  as  2  of  the  most  upsetting  adverse  reactions  of  cancer 
chemotherapy. Current guidelines propose 5-HT3 receptor antagonists as an effective pharmacological 
intervention  for  prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  chemotherapy-induced  nausea  and  vomiting  (CINV) 
with some reservations according to the intensity and duration of chemotherapy. The active substance 
of SANCUSO 3.1 mg/24 hrs transdermal patch submitted for marketing authorisation is granisetron, a 
selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. 
The  legal  basis  for  this  marketing  authorisation  application  for  SANCUSO  3.1  mg/24  h  transdermal 
patch  is  Article  10(3)  (“hybrid  application”)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  nonclinical  and  clinical 
development  strategies  were  therefore  designed  to  bridge  to  the  previous  findings  of  efficacy  and 
safety  for  the  reference  product,  Kytril  (granisetron  hydrochloride)  1  mg  Tablets.  Oral  as  well  as 
intravenous formulations of granisetron have been authorized and marketed in the EU Member States. 
The literature has also been reviewed for new information generated since the licensing of the existing 
dosage forms of granisetron and it has been incorporated in the submitted dossier. 
The  granisetron  transdermal  delivery  system  (granisetron  TDS)  that  is  applied  in  this  application  has 
been  developed  for  the  prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  in  patients  receiving  moderately  or  highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy for up to 5 consecutive days with an expectation that a single application of 
the patch offers steady, sustained delivery of granisetron.   
Granisetron TDS is approved in several countries outside the EEA. The indication sought is prevention 
of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for up to 
5 consecutive days. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Granisetron TDS consists of an active matrix spread on to a polyethylene terephthalate backing. The 
active matrix has an area weight of 110 g/m2 (572 mg per patch). The active matrix consists of a 
pressure sensitive adhesive containing 6 % (w/w) granisetron base. The total content of the active 
drug substance is 34.3 mg per patch and the flux determined during the clinical programme using 
patches made by the proposed commercial product manufacturer is 3.1 mg/24 h. 
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, the active substance granisetron is not described in the European 
Pharmacopoeia.  
Granisetron is an off-white to pale yellow coloured powder, non hygroscopic, freely soluble in methanol 
and methylene dichloride. A single crystalline form of granisetron is consistently produced; no further 
studies on polymorphism were performed. 
The molecular formula of granisetron is C18H 24N4O, its relative molecular mass 312.41 and its 
structural formula as follows: 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 7/69
 
 
 
 
Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  sourced  from  two  different  manufacturers:  Dr  Reddy’s  Laboratories  (Andhra 
Pradesh, India) and Cipla Ltd (Mumbai, India). Both sources of drug substance are supported by Active 
Substance Master Files.  
Granisetron  base  manufactured  by  both  drug  substance  suppliers  is  generally  produced  by  the  same 
manufacturing  process  as  granisetron  hydrochloride.  The  active  substance  from  Cipla  Ltd  is 
manufactured  to  the  point  of  granisetron  base  with  manufacture  halted  before  conversion  to  the 
hydrochloride  salt,  while  the  active  substance  from  Dr  Reddy’s  Ltd  is  manufactured  to  the  point  of 
granisetron  hydrochloride  and  then  converted  to  granisetron  base.  Applicant  states  that  due  to  the 
above presented approaches, the impurity profile of both sources of granisetron base drug substance 
is,  therefore,  the  same  as  for  the  respective  granisetron  hydrochloride  salts  manufactured  by  both 
Cipla Ltd and Dr Reddy’s Ltd. 
The  synthetic  routes  are  considered  essentially  identical  except  for  a  few  minor  details  and  would  be 
expected  to  produce  finished  product  of  identical  quality  with  very  similar  impurities  profiles.  The 
solvents used by the two processes have some differences, which are reflected in the residual solvents 
specifications for the respective active substances. 
The active substance produced by Cipla Ltd. is dried, milled and sieved; the active substance produced 
by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Limited is dried and sieved. Since the granisetron base is dissolved in N,N-
dimethylacetamide  during  the  granisetron  TDS  manufacturing  process,  there  is  no  particle  size 
specification and  the  active  substance  physical  characteristics  have  no  influence  on  the  quality  of  the 
drug product. The granisetron base produced by both Cipla Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited is 
the  endo  form.  Thus  the  Applicant  considers  two  granisetron  base  sources  can  be  considered 
equivalent with respect to the manufacture of granisetron TDS. 
The  quality  of  the  starting  material  supplied  by  different  manufacturers  is  satisfactory.  The 
manufacturing  processes  are  well  established  and  reproducible  and  the  specification  of  granisetron 
ensures  that  the  product  fully  meets  the  requirements.  Adequate  details  are  provided  for  the  quality 
control  testing  performed  during  the  synthesis;  these  include  specifications  and  the  associated  test 
methods for all the raw materials used in the process plus any in-process testing also with limits and 
test  method.  These  procedures  and  tests  ensure  that  the  processes  are  properly  and  adequately 
controlled.  Batch  analysis  from  production  scale  batches,  are  provided  ensuring  consistency  in    the 
manufacture of the active substance. 
Specification 
As the active substance in Sancuso preparation, presented in a form of granisetron base, is identical to 
the active moiety of the reference product Kytril 1 mg Tablet (granisetron hydrochloride), for the 
purposes of setting specifications the existing European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monograph for 
granisetron hydrochloride has been considered. 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 8/69
 
 
 
 
Specifications have been set that are appropriate in view of the Ph Eur Monograph ‘Substances for 
Pharmaceutical use’, ICH guidance. 
The specifications of the active substance as tested by the finished product manufacturer include the 
following test parameters: description, solubility, identification (HPLC and IR), water content (LoD), 
residue on ignition, heavy metals, related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particle size and residual 
solvents (GC). 
Batch analysis results of at least 3 production scale batches from each manufacturer demonstrate 
compliance with the proposed specification and indicate that the manufacturing process followed by 
both manufacturers is under control. 
Stability 
Satisfactory  stability  data  of  three  batches  from  each  manufacturer  of  the  active  substance  stored  in 
their  proposed  commercial  packaging  at  25  °C/  60  %  RH  or  30  °C/  65  %  RH  and  40  °C/  75  %  RH, 
have  been  provided  to  support  the  proposed  re-test  period  of  24  months.  The  following  tests  were 
included  in  the  stability  program:  description,  identification,  loss  on  drying,  related  substances  and 
assay.  The  container  closure  system  is  similar  to  that  proposed  for  commercial  packaging.  All  results 
comply with the specifications and no trends are observed. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
Granisetron TDS consists of a stable matrix of granisetron base (6% w/w: 34.3 mg/52 cm2 patch) in a 
commercially available adhesive (Duro-Tak 387-2287).  
Granisetron base was selected as the active drug substance in preference to granisetron hydrochloride 
(the form of the drug used in currently marketed oral and intravenous formulations and described by a 
Ph. Eur. compendial monograph) because of anticipated superior skin permeation properties. 
Granisetron base is lipophilic, non-ionic drug substance and due to its physical/chemical properties it is 
more suitable for the preparation of transdermal dosage forms and for appropriate penetration through 
the skin. 
The objective of the granisetron TDS formulation development programme was to create a stable 
granisetron transdermal matrix system capable of delivering the active substance over multiple days 
whilst achieving the necessary plasma levels. The pharmaceutical development process focused on the 
manufacturability and stability of the formulation, and permeation and loading of the active substance. 
The pharmaceutical development is presented in sufficient details and is supported by adequate 
amount of experimental data. Adequately designed and reported comprehensive validation studies are 
presented. Steps in formulations development and manufacturing process development are logical and 
consistent. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process involves several processing steps such as manufacture of the adhesive 
blend containing Granisetron base, spreading of the blend onto the siliconised liner, followed by drying, 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 9/69
 
 
 
 
rolling the backing onto the dried adhesive matrix and finalising by punching and packaging the 
patches. The description of manufacturing process and process controls is presented in sufficient detail 
and process flow diagram is presented with indication of the critical steps, including appearance, 
identification of granisetron, assay, and residual solvents. The manufacturing steps are conducted for a 
40 kg batch size.  
Process validation results of four production scale batches were provided. Results of tested parameters 
are batch to batch comparable and are within proposed limits. The results verify that the process 
assures adequate batch to batch consistency. 
Product specification 
The specification of the drug product are acceptable and include: appearance, assay (HPLC), uniformity 
of dosage units, identification by HPLC and UV, related substances (HPLC), presence of crystals, 
dissolution, microbiological purity, pouch integrity, adhesion and peel force. The finished product 
specifications are adequate for controlling this pharmaceutical form. The proposed test procedures and 
acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. and ICH guidelines. All tests included 
in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Certificates of analysis of seven production scale batches are provided. The batch analysis results show 
that the finished product meets the proposed specifications and confirm the consistency & uniformity of 
manufacture indicating that the process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
The conditions used in the stability studies are in accordance with the ICH stability guideline (25 °C/ 60 
% RH, 30 °C/ 65 % RH and 40 °C/ 75 % RH) and the packaging similar to that proposed for the 
market. The control tests and specifications of drug product are adequately drawn up. Photostability 
tests performed on one batches showed that the product is unstable at when exposed to UV and cool 
white light but that the proposed container closure system adequately protected the product from 
light. Based on the stability data provided the proposed shelf-life of 3 years when stored in the original 
packaging at 25 °C with allowable excursions to 30 °C can be granted.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  have 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature as well as studies conducted by the 
applicant to support this application. In accordance with the requirements for a hybrid application, the 
applicant has identified a programme to address the following points: 
(1) whether administration of granisetron base via the transdermal route results in a comparable 
systemic toxicological profile to that established following oral and intravenous administration of 
granisetron hydrochloride, and  
(2) whether transdermal administration of granisetron base exhibits the potential for local irritation or 
photosensitivity. 
The safety programme undertaken by the Applicant comprises the following studies: 
–  14-day local tolerance and systemic toxicity studies in rat and dog, which compared the effects 
of granisetron administration via different routes: transdermal versus oral versus intravenous 
(i.v). bolus injection 
–  14-day toxicology studies via continuous i.v. infusion in rats and dogs in order to further 
increase systemic exposures to granisetron (rat) and maintain plasma granisetron 
concentrations constant over the whole duration of the treatment period (rat and dog) 
–  Six additional, non-pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies 
–  Skin sensitising potential in the guinea-pig according to the Buehler protocol 
– 
In vitro photosafety studies in Balb/c 3T3 fibrobasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells 
– 
In vivo photoirritation and photosensitisation study in guinea-pigs. 
Furthermore, an environmental risk assessment was performed. 
All pivotal non-clinical studies provided with this application were performed according to the GLP 
standards. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Granisetron was previously demonstrated to be potent and effective in the anaesthetised rat, cat and 
in the conscious ferret with a long duration of action and a shallow dose/inhibition curve. Relatively 
large changes in granisetron levels are required to result in marked changes in anti-emetic effect. 
Noteworthy findings during preclinical general pharmacological testing with granisetron were observed 
at very high doses in vivo and very high concentrations in vitro, and were considered unlikely to be 
clinically relevant. Later findings of possible inhibition of the human cardiac ion channels was taken 
into account in clinical studies with granisetron TDS (Study 392MD/39/C). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption patterns following IV administration of 14C-granisetron to rats and dogs suggest no 
differences in Cmax, t1/2, and AUC of granisetron between the single-dose and repeated-dose groups 
(Haddock, 19901). There is no indication in the literature of a gender difference in PK in animals.

Page 11/69
 
 
 
                                               
Elimination of IV granisetron was both urinary (40 %) and faecal (60 %) in both rats and dogs and it is 
unlikely that granisetron undergoes significant enterohepatic circulation. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Median lethal dose values for the rat and mouse are described by Hakansson et al., 19901. The acute 
toxicity of granisetron was primarily due to CNS stimulation with convulsions occurring in rats and mice 
after oral, subcutaneous and IV administration. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The pivotal programme consists of two 14-day local tolerance and systemic toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs, comparing granisetron administration via the TDS route versus the oral and IV (bolus) routes, as 
well as two 14-day continuous IV infusion toxicology studies were performed in rats and dogs. In total, 
the applicant has performed 8 repeat-dose toxicity studies. These studies are summarized in the table 
below.

Major findings 
No clinical signs of systemic 
toxicity. No treatment-related 
changes in: behaviour; faeces; 
body weight; food or drinking 
water consumption. No 
treatment-related local 
intolerance at infusion site or 
premature deaths.  
Transdermal: Local intolerance 
reactions in the form of a 
moderate or severe erythema 
were noted at the application 
sites of the animals treated 
epicutaneously. The local 
reactions observed are 
considered to be due to the 
adhesive 14-day patch 
application causing a local 
irritation of the skin. 
No signs of systemic toxicity. 
Oral administration: No signs of 
systemic toxicity. Intravenous 
administration: 
No signs of local and systemic 
toxicity were noted for the 
animals treated intravenously 
with 1 mg /kg/ b.w./day. 9 mg 
/kg/ b.w./day IV caused 
tonicoclonic convulsions in a few 
male and female animals on 
individual test days, lasting for 
up to 5 minutes after the 
injection. Histopathological 
examination revealed an 
increased incidence and severity 
of granulation tissue with 
haemorrhage at the intravenous 
injection sites.  
No mortality. No clinical signs of 
toxicity were noted at any dose 
level. No effect on the body 
weight and the food 
consumption. No test item-
related influence was observed 
on haematological, biochemical 
and urinary parameters. No 
effect on the eyes and the 
auditory acuity at any dose level. 
Macroscopic past martern 
evaluation revealed no systemic 
changes during necropsy 
considered as related to the 
treatment with the test item. 
The absolute and relative organ 
weights were in the normal 
range. The bone marrow 
examination revealed no test 
item-related findings. The 
histopathological evaluation 
revealed no test item-related 
local or systemic microscopic 
findings.

examination revealed no test 
item-related findings. The 
histopathological evaluation 
revealed no test item-related 
local or systemic rnicroscopic 
findings. 
No new signals were identified by the Applicant with the exception of local intolerance in the form of 
erythema at the application sites. The formulation of the granisetron TDS used in the toxicology 
studies was the same formulation composition, containing the same strength as that used in the 
clinical trials and the same as the proposed commercial composition. 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of granisetron has been studied by the originator with respect to gene mutations in 
bacteria and mammalian cells and chromosomal aberrations in vitro. No significant genotoxic effects 
could be observed. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies conducted by the originator showed no special hazard for humans when used at 
the recommended dose. In accordance with the recommendations of ICH S1A (treatment duration 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report

below 6 months and patient population) no new genotoxicity studies have been performed for 
granisetron TDS.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity was previously studied with po and sc fertility studies in rats, 
po and iv embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits (only po), po and sc pre and post-natal 
development studies in rats.  These studies demonstrated no effects on fertility, no embryotoxicity or 
effects on development and reproductive performance of pups, at maximum doses which were 
sufficiently high to produce parental toxicity. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic analysis was performed from the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. The 
results are summarized in the following table.

Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of granisetron TDS was investigated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed 
by the Applicant in rats and dogs which revealed a low potential for irritancy for granisetron TDS. 
In addition, the applicant has conducted a specific local tolerance and sensitisation study in guinea-pigs 
No sensitising properties were observed in this study

Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
The Applicant conducted 2 in vitro studies and 1 in vivo study in female guinea-pigs (Report 21022/06) 
to assess the phototoxic potential of granisetron base as well as an in vivo photosensitisation test in 
guinea-pigs (see table below). The phototoxicity studies are not showing any phototoxicity, 
photoirritation, or photosensitisation potential. However the results of a single in vitro study in CHO 
cells suggest that there is a potential for photoactivation of granisetron as this is shown in a dose-
dependent and statistically significant increase in chromosome structural damage following 
photoirradiation. This finding is reflected in sections 4.4. and 5.3 of the SmPC.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has conducted an experimental determination of the octanol-water partition coefficient 
(Kow) of granisetron, using the shake-flask method. A log Kow value of 2.84 ± 0.25 (n=6) was 
calculated, which is close to the computed value of 2.8, previously submitted, and is below the log Kow 
limit value of >4.5. Therefore the substance is not a PBT. 
For calculating PECsw both (1) the total amount of granisetron within the granisetron TDS, whether 
this enters the environment through use or after removal of the patch, and (2) the amount released 
during actual use have been considered by the applicant.  
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 16/69
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only the first approach is being used by CHMP as basis for the calculation, as the active substance 
remaining in the patch discarded after use can have also an impact on the environment and because 
this is the most conservative approach. 
According to the Q&A CHMP Guideline on the ERA of medicinal products for human use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010), note 1, Fpen can be refined taking into account the prevalence data 
provided and the treatment regime.The incidence of all new cancers is estimated in EU at 3.2 million 
and the prevalence of all cancers (based on Globocan 2008) at 3.4 million.  
In the worst case scenario, granisetron TDS is given as 7 patches/week in 12 courses of chemotherapy 
in a 12 month period. Considering that each patch contains 34.3 mg of granisetron, and taking into 
account the  dosing regime, calculated (average) Doseai = 34.2 mg *7 *12/365 = 7.9 mg.  
Taking the prevalence as 3.2 million (out of 498 million inhabitants in EU), the refined Fpen is 
3.2/498= 0.0064.Therefore the calculated PECsw= (7.9*0.0064)/(200*10)= 0.025 10-3 mg/L= 0.025 
g/L, which is above the action limit of 0.01 g/L. 
Consequently, the applicant was asked to perform a phase II ERA. The applicant should perform a 
phase II ERA based on literature with a view to propose amendments for the information for use and 
handling (& disposal) of the patches. Overall, considering that the actual use of granisetron TDS is 
likely to be far less than the above assumptions, it is considered reasonable in these circumstances to 
conclude at present that the therapeutic use of granisetron TDS is unlikely to pose a risk to the 
environment. Recommendations for disposal are included in the product information. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
The MAH is recommended to perform a literature based phase II ERA analysis, with a view to propose 
amendments for the information for use and handling (& disposal) of the patches. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological properties of granisetron in the Non-clinical part are adequately overviewed on 
the basis of scientific publications. The Applicant has not conducted any new pharmacokinetic 
nonclinical studies and nowadays available data are discussed and reviewed in the Nonclinical Overview 
part. Data on the toxicology of granisetron TDS are based on bibliographical sources on granisetron 
and repeat-dose toxicity, local tolerance, photogenotoxicity and photosensitisation studies conducted 
by the Applicant according to the GLP standards.  
In the repeat dose toxicity and the toxicokinetic analysis no new signals were identified with the 
exception of local intolerance in the form of erythema at the application sites. The formulation of the 
Granisetron TDS used in the toxicology studies was the same formulation composition, containing the 
same strength as that used in the clinical trials and the same as the proposed commercial composition. 
In addition, the Applicant has conducted a specific local tolerance and sensitisation study in guinea-
pigs. Different grades of skin irritations were observed in granisetron base-treated animals, as well as 
erythema in all positive controls.  
Application site erythema and application site irritation were added to the RMP as important potential 
risks furthermore application site reaction was reflected in 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The Applicant has conducted 3 formal studies to assess the phototoxic potential of granisetron base as 
well as an in vivo photosensitisation test in guinea-pigs. The phototoxicity studies are not showing any 
phototoxicity, photoirritation, or photosensitisation potential. However the results of a single in vitro 
study in CHO cells suggest that there is a potential for photoactivation of granisetron as this is shown 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 17/69
 
 
 
in a dose-dependent and statistically significant increase in chromosome structural damage. This 
finding is reflected in 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
With respect to the environmental risk assessment, it is considered reasonable to conclude at present 
that the therapeutic use of granisetron TDS is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment. Adequate 
recommendations for disposal are included in the product information. Nevertheless, a phase II ERA 
should be performed by the applicant with a view to propose amendments for the information for use 
and handling (& disposal) of the patches.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical program performed by the applicant was considered adequate to support this hybrid 
application. Issues observed in the performed studies such as application site erythema and 
photogenotoxicity were adequately addressed in the relevant parts of RMP and SmPC.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress the 
MAH was recommended to perform a literature based phase II ERA analysis, with a view to propose 
amendments for the information for use and handling (& disposal) of the patches. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development strategies were designed to bridge to the previous findings of efficacy and 
safety for the reference product, the oral formulation of granisetron, to the transdermal formulation. 
Overall the study programme consisted of 
–  One pivotal phase III study in cancer patients 
–  One dose-ranging phase II study in cancer patients 
–  Nine pharmacokinetic studies 
–  One phase I pharmacology study. 
The below table provides an overviews of this study programme. 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of granisetron TDS have been studied in all ten clinical studies involving 1,386 
subjects (576 healthy subjects and 810 cancer patients with CINV), of whom approximately 58 % were 
the target patient population - cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The release of granisetron 
from granisetron TDS was measured in nine of these. No formal study has been performed to assess 
granisetron TDS pharmacokinetics in children.The measurement was made by determining the residual 
amount of granisetron that remained in the granisetron TDS after removal and calculating the 
administered dose as patch content minus residual granisetron amount. The in vitro flux, that is the 
dose released per day (apparent dose), could then be calculated as released dose/days contact. 
The in vitro flux has been dose normalised, for comparison purposes, to a dose of 34.3 mg, that is, to 
a 52 cm2 patch. Adjusting the total apparent dose (21.7 mg) from this study for number of days’ 
exposure (7 days) yields a flux value of 3.1 mg/24 h.  Thus, the granisetron TDS flux has been 
calculated as 3.1 mg/24 h. 
Bioanalytical methods  
Bioanalytical methods for granisetron were adequately described and validated to support the clinical 
pharmacokinetic programme conducted. The analytical methods used in each study are listed in Table

Study 392MD/4/C. This was a single-centre, single-dose, open, Phase I study and was conducted in 
12 healthy subjects (6 males and 6 females) to evaluate the systemic bioavailability of one 15 cm² 
granisetron TDS and to determine the PK profile over an application period of 5 days on the abdomen. 
For the evaluation of the plasma concentrations of granisetron, blood samples were drawn per time 
point at the following times after patch application: 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 
48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120 (preceding patch removal), 126, 132 h after patch application. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental or model free methods, namely, 
linear trapezoidal rule for AUC, log-linear regression for λz. PK parameters are given in the table 
below.

This study was contributing to the first understanding of mean Tmax determination that was found as 
48 hrs, and ranging form 30 to 126 hrs. 
The CHMP noted that in this study were a number of outliers, with both higher and lower exposures 
within this study. The observed variability in PK parameters was in line with the known high variability 
for oral and IV granisetron. 
Different application sites were used in study 392MD/4/C (abdominal wall) compared to the other 
clinical trials presented (upper arm). Data from this study show that somewhat higher concentrations 
are obtained in comparison with Study 392MD/11/C (patch applied on upper arm). Further, in the 
patient studies it was specified that in cases of breast cancer and lymph gland issues prevented use of 
the upper arm, the patch should be applied to the patient’s upper abdomen. However, no subgroup 
analyses could be performed from these patient studies as only one patient applied the patch to 
another site. As no safety issues are expected from the observed higher concentrations, the CHMP 
accepted the companies proposal to use the abdomen as an alternative administration site if an arm is 
not available, which is reflected in the SPC Section 4.2.  
Study 392MD/11/C. This was a single-centre, open-label, four-way-crossover study to compare the 
bioavailability of granisetron after a single 6-day application of three dosages of granisetron TDS, to 
that of once-daily dosing of 2 mg granisetron tablets for 5 days. This study also assessed the dose 
proportionality of granisetron pharmacokinetics after patch application.  
Twelve healthy male subjects received oral granisetron administered as a 2 mg dose once daily, for 5 
days and three dosages of granisetron TDS (15, 33 and 52 cm2) applied for 6 days to the upper outer 
arm. Each treatment was separated by a washout period of at least 5 days. The mean age of all 12 
subjects was 37.1 years; mean weight 76.8 kg; and mean BMI (body mass index) 24.2 kg/m2. 
Serial blood samples were taken before and up to 240 hrs after TDS application and up to 72 hrs after 
the last oral dose. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: Cmax, Tmax, t1/2,λz, 
AUC(0-z), AUC(0-∞), in vivo flux (for TDS only) and Cavg calculated as AUC(0-24h)ss/24 for oral 
dosing and as AUC(0-144h)/144 for TDS application. The apparent elimination half-lives (t1/2, λz) 
were calculated by non-compartmental analysis. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of 
granisetron. 
As Tmax is a discrete variable, day effect was tested using a Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. Time 
for plasma concentrations of granisetron to reach steady state was assessed on Ln-transformed trough 
plasma concentrations (C24h) observed from days 1 to 5 using an analysis of variance with subject 
and day as main effects in the model followed by a Tukey’s test. For TDS: Proportionality between the 
dose administered (size of the patch) and the pharmacokinetic parameters was assessed by means of 
an analysis of variance with subject, dose and period interaction as main effects in the model on the 
following Ln-transformed parameters: Cavg/dose, AUC(0-∞)/dose, in vivo flux/dose and t1/2,λz.

Study 392MD/26/C. This study was a double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the skin 
irritation and sensitisation potential of granisetron TDS and was undertaken in healthy subjects. The 
secondary objective was to assess the delivery of granisetron from the patch by determining the 
plasma granisetron levels in a subset of subjects. During the first 7-days administration of the patches 
a subset of 24 subjects had blood samples taken for plasma granisetron measurements to determine 
the release profile of the drug from the patch in the the to-be-marketed formulation. 
The mean plasma granisetron Cmax and AUC values in healthy females were both approximately 3-
fold higher than in males. Individual Cmax and AUClast values generally overlapped and part of the 
observed difference in mean values was caused by one female subject with Cmax and AUClast values 
10-fold higher than those reported in other subjects (respectively, over 42 ng/mL and 4500 ng.h/mL). 
After this subject exclusion from the analyses, mean plasma granisetron Cmax and AUC values in 
healthy females were 1.8-fold higher than in males. Median Cmax and AUC values were 1.805 ng/mL 
and 169.05 ng.h/mL, respectively, in males and 4.92 ng/mL and 489.85 ng.h/mL, respectively, in 
females.

granisetron TDS (52 cm²) and i.v. granisetron on the QT interval in 120 healthy male and 120 healthy 
female  subjects.  The  secondary  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  assess  the  relationship  between  the 
QTcF change from baseline and plasma granisetron concentrations; and to assess patch adhesion and 
residual granisetron remaining in the patch after use. During the 5 day application of granisetron TDS, 
geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-120h were 3.6 ng/mL and 239 ng.h/mL (see Table 5) respectively, with 
high  intersubject  variability  (%CV  80%  and  89%)  respectively.  Median  time  to  maximum 
concentrations was 56 hours.

  5.  Pharmacokinetic  Results  of  Granisetron  During  5-Day  Application  of  Granisetron 
TDS 
Study 392MD/40/C. This was a single-centre, open-label, single-dose, two-part, controlled study 
without randomisation, to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the granisetron TDS in elderly 
subjects (part I) and to assess the PK profile of the granisetron TDS in underweight and obese subjects 
(Part II). Healthy male or female subjects; nei
ther gender was to represent more than 60% of the 
population enrolled in each part of the study. 
The results of the statistical analyses of the PK parameters Cmax, AUC(0−z), AUC(0−∞) and C
avg 
show that the there were no significant regression coefficients at the 5% level; therefore, the 
continuous variables age, BMI and age*BMI were determined to have n
o predicting properties for 
d
escribing the PK parameters Cmax, AUC(0−z), AUC(0−∞) and Cavg. 
Study 392MD/41/C. This was a Phase 1 study to assess the PK profile of the co-administration of i.v. 
granisetron and granisetron TDS (52 cm2) in 6 healthy male and 6 healthy female Caucasian subjects.
The times between 0 and 24 hrs at which peak plasma concentrations were reached (Tmax (0−<24
)) 
ranged from 0.05 to 1 hour after i.v. administration of granisetron. Individual Tmax (24−168) and 
Tmax (>168−336) estimates ranged from approximately 
24 to 96 hrs and from 192 to 264 hrs (i.
e. 24 
to 96 hrs after application of the second patch), respectively. Subsequent to these concentration 
maxima, plasma concentrations were variable but generally declined in a mono-exponential manne
r. 
Based on geometric mean AUC(0−168) and AUC(168−336) estimates no meaningful difference in 
systemic exposure to granisetron was noted between the two granisetron TDS applications following 
co-administration of transdermal and i.v. granisetron. 
The subsequent concentration maximally attributable to the release of granisetron from the 
granisetron TDS applied at 0 hour and 168 hrs were broadly comparable, in terms of their resp
ective 
Cmax and Tmax values, and as such did not appear to be affected by i.v. co-administration.  
Systemic exposure to granisetron was comparable following the first and second transdermal patch 
applications: minimal differences were apparent between Cmax(24−168) and Cmax(>168−336),
 and 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report

between corresponding Cavg estimates, with minimal evidence of accumulation following repeat 
dosing.  
The PK analysis from the Study (41/C) revealed that T max variations can be quite variable, ranging 
from 24 hrs up to 96 hrs. The applicant provided analysis of mean and median C24/Cmax valu
es for 24 
hours, 48 hours and 96 hours and stated that these concentrations were similar. 
Study 392MD/43/C. This was a Phase 1 study to evaluate the effect of external heat on the 
pharmacokinetics of granisetron TDS in 8 healthy male and 8 healthy female subjects. One granisetron 
TDS (52 cm2) was applied to the upper arm for 5 days (120 h), and a second granisetron TDS was 
applied for 5 days after a minimum washout of 14 days. On each of the 5 days (during either the first 
or second application), one Cura-Heat® Back & Shoulder pad with a measured local temperature of 
approximately 42ºC (107.6ºF) was applied over granisetron TDS at the same time each day and left 
in 
place for 4.5 continuous hrs. Subjects were randomised to receive Treatment A (granisetron TDS
alone) followed by Treatment B (grani
setron TDS plus Cura-Heat), or vice versa.Systemic exposure 
based on geometric mean estimates of Cmax, AUC(0−z), Cavg and AUC(0−∞) was comparable 
between the 
two treatments. 
Time to maximum plasma granisetron concentration (Tmax) was also comparable between the 
treatments. 
Apparent ter
minal half-lives were very similar between the treatments: mean apparent t½ estimates 
were 25.16 hrs for Treatment A (range 16.46 to 30.01) and 30.73 h for Treatment B (range 19
.98 to 
54.92). 
Study SP-0101.
 This study was a Phase 1, single centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study to assess the PK of a single 6-day application of granisetron TDS (52 cm2) in healthy 
Japanese males. 
Following the application of a single 6-day granisetron TDS 52 cm2 to healthy male Japanese subjects, 
a median Tmax value of 48.0 hrs, as well as a mean t1/2 value of 30.7 hrs was observed for 
granisetron. Granisetron mean Cmax values of 5.02 ng/mL were also observed. Following granisetron 
TDS application, granisetron mean Cavg(0-144h) and Cavg(24-
144h) were 3.00 ng/mL and 3.27 
ng/mL, respectively. A similar moderate to large inter-subject variability was also observed in healthy 
male non-Japanese subjects in the 392/MD/11/C study. 
Study 392MD/8/C. This was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel group
, 
Phase 2 study in chemotherapy naïve patients undergoing a single day regimen of chemotherapy with 
MEC. A total of 175 patients received study medication and 157 were included in the per protocol (PP) 
population. The study included male or female patients 18-75 years of age with histologically and/or 
cytologically confirmed solid tumours, ECOG status ≥ 2 and a body mass index (BMI) of 18-30 kg/m2,
who were scheduled to receive single-day administration of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
. 
Blood samples for determining plasma levels of granisetron were taken 2 hrs following administratio
n 
of the oral granisetron/placebo on Day 0 and thereafter on Days 1 and 4. In a small subset of 17 
patients, samples were also taken on Days 5 and 6 after oral granisetron/placebo administration in 
order to establish the apparent terminal decline following removal of the patch on Day 4. 
Plasma 
concentration data were available for 86 patients on Day 0 granisetron TDS application (52 cm2 patch) 
and for 82 patients who had received a single 2 mg dose of oral granisetron. 
In patients treated with a single 2 mg dose of oral granisetron absorption was rapid with granisetron 
quantifiable in the plasma of 80 out of the 83 patients one hour after chemotherapy.  This time point 
was also Tmax and a mean plasma granisetron value of 7.17 ng/mL (median 7.01 ng/mL) was 
observed. In comparison, granisetron was similarly quantifiable in the plasma of 80 out of 86 patients 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report

one hour after chemotherapy in patients receiving granisetron TDS.  The mean value at this time point 
was 2.84 ng/mL (median: 1.12 ng/mL) and Cmax was not reached until 24 hours after chemotherapy 
(mean Cmax 5.00 ng/mL, median: 2.56 ng/mL). 
For patients receiving oral granisetron the initial high Cmax was followed by a rapid decrease in plasma 
granisetron to 2.28 ng/mL 24 hours post dose and after 4 days plasma granisetron was below the limit 
of quantification in 70% of patients. Plasma granisetron levels decreased more slowly following 
granisetron TDS with plasma levels still as high as 3.26 ng/mL after 4 days. Two days after removal of 
grani
setron TDS granisetron was still measurable in plasma, although it had decreased to 0.49 ng/m
L. 
However, in oral granisetron patients no grani
setron was quantified in plasm
a at this time point.

Study 392MD/15/C was a randomised, active control, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, 
multi-national study to assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of granisetron TDS (52 cm2 patch) in 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) associated with the administration of moderatel
y 
or highly emetogenic multi-day chemotherapy. Over six hundred patients were treated wi
th 
g
ranisetron (316 with the granisetron TDS and 321 with oral granisetron). Descriptive pharmacokinetic 
analyses were performed. Granisetron plasma concentration data are summarised for the two 
tr

The applicant noted, that this study confirmed the high i
nter-subject variability of the pharmacokinetics 
of granisetron overall and in both male and female cancer patients treated with oral granisetron an
d 
granisetron TDS. Median plasma concentrations at Visit 1 (anticipated peak plasma concentration) 
were higher for oral granisetron than granisetron TDS. 
The CHMP noted that main PK data in patients were generated from two trials (8/C and 15/C). In 
Study 8/C minimally required time for patch application was 24 hours time before chemotherapy. In 
Study 392MD/15/C median time value prior to chemotherapy was 45.1 hours, median (SD) was 40.7 
(9.4) hours, individual values ranged between 25 and 72 hours. So, median time value was closer to 
48 hours than to 24 hours. As it can be seen from measured median plasma concentrations, 
differences between oral and TDS is ~ 7 times different in Study 8/C and ~4 times different in Study 
15/C.  
Population PK. The PK model was developed using data from 4/C, 8/C, 11
/C, 15/C and 26/C. The 
objectives of the population PK analyses were to develop a population PK model for granisetron after 
granisetron TDS application and after oral administration, to explore the effects of various covariates 
on the PK characteristics of granisetron and to use it for PK/PD modelling.

Based on the granisetron TDS PK model for the cross-over study, the fraction, bioavailable after pa
tch 
administration (F), was determined to be 46% relative to oral dosing. This value is based on t
he 
nominal dose. The median amount removed from the patch was 55% in trials 4/C, 8/C, 11/C and 26/C.
It was assumed by the applicant that, based on the administrated dose, F is approximately 
80% 
relative to oral. As Granisetron exposures showed a high inter-individual variability, in the final PK 
model fitted to data of all granisetron TDS treated subjects, a inter-subject CV of 112% was 
determined for the apparent clearance (CL/F), which is inversely proportional to exposure. In the final 
model based only on the cross-over trial, an intra-subject CV of 26% was determined for exposure 
after granisetron TDS administration.  
The CL/F of granis
etron was estimated in both healthy subjects and patients after oral and granisetron 
TDS administration. This showed that CL/F in patients was decreased relative to healthy volunteers, by 
75%  
Distribution 
Based on bibliogr
aphic data, granisetron is distributed with a mean volume of distribution of 
approximately 3 L/kg (Allen et al. 1995). Using the PopPK modelling, similar V values were obtained: 
mean V c = 322 L and Vss=468 L. This implies also certain accumulation. 
Elimination 
The mean plasma clearance in heal
thy subjects is reported as 0.79 L/h/kg (Allen et al. 19951). 
In Study  11/C and in the PPK modelling it could be observed that the apparent granisetron plasma 
half-life in healthy subjects was prolonged to approximately 36 hours due to the slow absorption rate 
of granisetron through the skin.   
According to bibliographic data and in original studies evaluating CL after patch application (PPK 
modelling), the total plasma CL in healthy patients was ~0.79 l/h*kg or 42.5 L/hr and in patients CL = 
23.6 L. This information is reflected in SmPC as “in clinical studies conducted with SANCUSO, clearance 
in cancer patients was shown to be approximately half that of he
althy subjects”. 
In study 33/C, which was conducted to compare the metabolic profiles of granisetron (TDS and oral), 
and from plasma samples collected during Studies 11/C and 8C an analysis for metabolites from the 
patients treated with the TDS was performed.  
Considering bibliographically data the result are reflected in th
e SmPC: Following an oral or IV dosing 
of granisetron approximately 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged with the remainder metabolised 
via hydroxylation or N-demethylation, with 7-hydroxylation the major route in humans.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No formal dose proportionality studies were performed. Some aspects relevant to dose determination 
were assessed in Study 11/C, where Granisetron TDS application resulted in maximal concentrations
48 hrs post application. Mean Cmax values of 1.15, 2.08 and 3.85 ng/mL and mean Cavg values of 
0.68, 1.24, and 2.23 ng/mL were determined for 15 cm², 33 cm² and 52 cm² patch sizes, respectivel
y 
For the granisetron TDS, the mean area und
er the plasma concentration-time curve between time 0 
and infinity (AUC0-∞) was 149, 287 and 420 ng.h/mL, for 15cm2, 33cm2 and 52cm2 patch, 
respectively. Average granisetron plasma concentrations and AUC(0-) increased proportionally with

granisetron TDS patch size (i.e. with dose). Terminal half-life of granisetron was similar for all t
hree 
patch sizes with an overall mean of 33 hrs. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability The main data for inter-subject variability was assesse
d in 
the relative bioavailability study (11/C). Inter-subject variability was comparable across the 
transdermal patch and oral gr
anisetron treatments. The CV for AUC was 89% for the 52 cm2 
granisetron TDS compared with 108% on Day 5 following oral dosing regimen. The coefficients of 
variation for Cmax values w
ere 77% and 68% following patch or oral dosing respectively. 
The CHMP acknowledged the high inter-subject and intra-subject variability of the main PK parameters 
(Cmax, Cavg, AUC, and CL). 
Special populations 
Gender. The gender effect was assed via bibliographic data and original studies (4/C, 26/C, 15/C and 
PPK modelling). Published data showed that Cma
x is generally higher in males
 than in females but AUC 
is unaffected by gender. This seem broadly consistent with the findings in healthy subject study 4/C 
where the mean plasma granisetron Cmax and AUC in the healthy male subjects was greater than th
at 
seen in the females
 whilst in study 26/C, also in healthy subjects, the mean plasma granisetron Cmax 
and AUC were higher in females than males. 
For Study 39/C, both granisetron TDS and i.v. granisetron exposure was higher in females compared 
to males, although there was considerable overlap in the ranges of individual values and high inter-
subject variability. 
The CHMP considered that overall there seem to be a general tendency towards higher concentration
s 
in females in comparison to males, but this trend does not result in a clinical significant difference. This 
is also substantiated by the population pharmacokinetic model, where gender was not identified
 as a 
covariate improving the fit.  
Race. Study SP-0101 assessed the PK of granisetron after a single 6-day application of granisetron 
TDS in healthy Japanese males. High inter-subject variability in systemic exposure was observed (as it 
is well documented for granisetron studies) but overall the PK profile in Japanese subjects was 
comparable to that in non-Japanese subjects. 
Weight. Weight was assessed in study 40/C. Comparisons of mean Cmax, Cavg and AUC estimates 
indicated that systemic exposure appeared slightly lower in the normal subject group than in either th
e 
underweight or obese subject groups, although there was extensive overlap in the 95% CI around the 
geometric mean estimates for these parameters. 
Elderly. Study 40/C specifically studied the PK profile of granisetron TDS in 24 elderly subjects versus 
a control group in younger subjects. The mean (± SD) ages for 
the control and elderly groups were: 
30.8 (± 7.1) and 70.8 (± 5.0) years respectively. In the elderly group, 6 of the 24 subjects were ≥
75 
years old and the oldest subject was 84 years old. The results of the statistical analyses of the PK 
parameters Cmax, AUC(0−z), AUC(0−∞) and Cavg showed no significant differences at the 5% level 
between the age groups for any of the PK parameters. 
Children. No study has been performed to assess granisetron TDS pharmacokinetics in child
ren. 
Impaired renal function. Urinary excretion of unchanged granisetron accounts for less than 20% of 
dose in healthy subjects following i.v. dosing. The rest of the dose administered is excreted 49% by 
urine and 34% by the faeces as metabolites, mainly 7-hydroxygranise
tron. For this reason, dose 
adjustment in renal failure is considered unnecessary (Antonopoulos 200
81, Clarke 19941).

Additionally, total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who 
received a single 40 μg/kg dose of granisetron (Carmichael et al 19892). 
Impaired hepatic function. Palmer (1994)3 investigated the pharmacokinetics of granisetron in 20 
cancer patients with malignant involvement of the liver and 19 cancer patients who did not have liver 
involvement. In this study total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without liver 
involvement, which is expected due to the fact that granisetron is predominately eliminated by hepatic 
metabolism. For the reference product dose adjustment is not considered necessary based on the wide 
variability in PK parameters and good tolerance of doses above the recommended clinical dose. In 
section 4.4 of the SPC a special warning for hepatically impaired patients has been included 
considering the fact that granisetron is eliminated predominantly by the liver.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
As reported in the literature (Bloomer et al. 19944) and mentioned in the prescribing information of the 
reference product, granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug metabolizing 
enzyme system in vitro. 
In vivo 
The prescribing information of the reference product mentions that there have been no definitive drug-
drug  pharmacodynamic  or  PK  interaction  studies  performed  with  i.v.  granisetron;  however  safe 
administration  is  reported  with  drugs  representing  benzodiazepines,  neuroleptics  and  anti-ulcer 
medications.  Leigh  et  al.  (1991,  1992) 5   report  the  results  of  two  studies  in  12  healthy  subjects 
reviewing  the  effect  of  granisetron  alone  and  in  combination  with  lorazepam,  and  haloperidol,  on 
psychometric  performance,  and  for  the  latter  on  the  electroencephalogram  (EEG).  The  results  of  the 
studies  suggested  that  granisetron  had  no  impact  on  performance  or  the  EEG  and  that  it  can  be  co-
administered  with  the  two  agents  without  producing  unwanted  synergistic  effects.  Youlten  (2004) 6  
investigated the effect of repeat dosing with cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of i.v. granisetron in 
12 healthy subjects and found that PK parameters measured after cimetidine administration were not 
significantly different from those taken before. 
Granisetron  does  not  appear  to  interact  with  emetogenic  cancer  therapies.  More  recently  Watanabe 
(2003)7 suggested that granisetron neither inhibits nor induces the enzymes involved in paclitaxel and 
docetaxel  metabolism.  In  a  later  study,  Watanabe  (2005) 8   similarly  established  that  granisetron

Bloomer et al. (1994)1 reported the inhibition of ring oxidation of ketoconazole in human microsomal 
studies, although the clinical significance of this is unknown. This is also the case for the results of a 
h
uman PK study in which phenobarbital induction resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance 
of i.v. granisetron (prescribing information originator). 
Granisetron is metabolised by hepatic CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 enzymes, which is part of the cytochrome 
P450  enzyme  system. 
Drugs  that  induce  the  CYP3A4  enzyme  reduce  serum  concentration  of 
granisetron  or  interacting  drug,  whereas  drugs  that  inhibit  CYP3A4  increase  serum  concentration  of 
either drug. 
In section 4.5 of the SmP
C, the potential interaction with drugs that inhibit the isoenzyme CYP3A4 is 
discussed. Caution should be used wh
en administering ketoconazole or phenobarbital concurrently with 
granisetron.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamic
s 
Mechanism of action 
T
here are two sources of afferent input that can initiate the emetic reflex: 
- abdomi
nal vagal afferents with a variety of receptors, 5-HT3, neurokinin-1, cholecystokinin-1, which 
are located in close proximity to enteroendocrine mucosal cells of the proximal
 small intestine. 
Antineoplastic agents stimulate these cells to release mediators that bind to the vagal fibers, and
 lead 
to an afferent stimulus that terminates in the dorsal brain stem.  
- the area postrema (AP), a circumventricula
r structure located at the caudal end of the fourth   
ventricle. It is thought that gut-derived peptides and metabolites of chemotherapeutic agents induce 
emesis in part through binding at this site.  
The 5-HT  receptors are in both central location (area postrema 
3
and nucleus tractus solitarius – NTS) 
and peripheral locations (vagal afferents) that are rel
evant to CINV. Substance P and 
endocannabinoids may also be relevant transmitters in CINV. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Granisetron is a selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT3 receptors). Pharmacological 
studies have demonstrated that granisetron is effective against nausea and vomiting as a resul
t of 
cytostatic therapy. Radioligand binding studies have demonstrated that granisetron has negligible 
affinity for other receptor types, including 5HT1, 5HT2, 5HT4 and dopamine D2 binding site
s. 
The following pharmacology assessmentshave been performed specific for the present application. 
Study 392MD/39/C. This was a Phase 1, single-site, single-blind (except for the use of 
moxifloxacin), randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled, 4-arm parallel study with the primar
y 
objective to evaluate the effect of doses of granisetron TDS (52 cm2) and i.v. granisetron on the 
interval from start of Q wave to end of T wave (QT) in 120 healthy male and 120 healthy female 
subjects, who were in good health as determined by a physician, aged between 18 to 50 years 
inclusive, weighed at least 50 kg (110 pounds), had a body mass index of 18-32 kg/m2 inclusive.

No clinically significant effect of the granisetron TDS was observed on ECG parameters (heart 
rhythm, 
PR interval or QRS intervals), on the derived ECG parameters (QTcF, QTcB, and QTcI), or on the 
incidence of ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The upper l
imit of all the one-sided 95% 
confidence intervals for the time-matched granisetron TDS versus placebo analyses was below 10 
msec. There were no extreme QTcF value changes > 60 msec. 
The results resembles findings of gender differences ~ 50 % higher of AUC and Cmax in female
s, 
observed in study 26/C. 
PK/PD modelling. A PK/PD model was developed using PK data from studies 4/C, 8/C, 11/C, 
392MD/15/C and 26/C and PD data from study 15/C (see information above). General methodo
logy. 
The model applied to describe the PK and PD was a population or mixed-effect models. Modelling 
strategy. A sequential PK-PD modelling approached was followed. First, the oral PK model was 
developed. Subsequently the distribution and elimination parameters from this oral model were used in 
the development of the PK model for patch administration. The PK models were then used for the 
investigation of the PK-PD relationship. Development of a PK-PD model. The final PK models developed 
for patients after oral dosing or patch application were used to derive the exposure of each individual 
to granisetron in the Study 15/C. From the post hoc estimates, exposure was calculated in NONMEM a
s 
the area under the curve (AUC) from the start of chemotherapy until 24 h later (AUC24), and the AUC
from start of patch attachment or oral dosing until the end of the study period, which is 7 days later 
(AUC168). Possible exposure-response relationships were evaluated using 
proportional odds models. 
The relationship between AUC24 and Total Control on Day 1 was evaluated in separate models after 
oral administration, patch application, and in a combined oral/patch model. In an analogous manner, 
the relationship between AUC168 and Total Control Overall was evaluated. 
Results: In Study 15C plasma granisetron conce
ntrations were determined at two time points (Visit 1 
and Visit 6). An exposure-dependent effect on TC could not be detected using PK-PD modelling, for 
none of the exposure-response relationships.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Granisetron TDS has been developed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receivin
g 
moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for up to 5 consecutive days. The clinical development
strategies were designed to bridge to the previous findings of
 efficacy and safety for the reference 
product, the oral formulation of granisetron, to the transdermal formulation. The pharmacology 
program performed is formally acceptable for this purpose.  
A dose ranging and comparative bioavailability study with oral granisetron (392MD/11/C) showed that 
a 52 cm2 patch was the most suitable for further clinical development. The calculated flux of 
granisetron from grainsetron TDS 52 cm² is 3.1 mg/24 h. Pharmacological characteristics of the patch 
showed that initially plasma concentrations were slow to increase and that Cmax was reached at 
around 48 hours. Mean Cmax with granisetron TDS (3.85 ng/mL) was lower than that measured with 
oral granisetron 2 mg (5.5 ng/mL). However, the delivered dose from granisetron TDS resulted in a
n 
average plasma granisetron concentration (Cavg) of 2.23 ng/mL compared with 2.14 ng/mL after the 
first oral granisetron administration and 2.6 ng/mL following the final oral granisetron dose. When 
administered for 7 days the granisetron TDS 52 cm2 patch delivers, on average, a dose of 3.1 mg of 
granisetron per day. Hence the granisetron TDS 52 cm² patch delivers comparable average plasma 
concentrations to 2 mg oral granisetron every 24 hours. Therapeutically relevant concentrations were
maintained through to the removal of the patch at 144 hrs (Day 6), with less fluctuation in comparison
with repeat daily oral administration. Upon removal of the patch plasma concentrations continued to 
decline slowly, suggesting a dermal reservoir of drug.Consistent with PK studies of other formulations 
the interpatient variability of granisetron concentrations and exposure is high. Available data s

that granisetron TDS pharmacokinetics are not affected by external heat, body fat or age. Population 
PK analysis of data from clinical studies showed that granisetron PK are not affected by renal 
impairment and gender. It is likely that the apparent gender differences are due to the high variabili
ty 
of granisetron pharmacokinetics 
In Study 392MD/15/C median time value prior to chemotherapy was 45.1 hours, median (SD) wa
s 
40.7 (9.4) hours, individual values ranged between 25 and 72 hours. S
o, median time value was closer 
to 48 hours than to 24 hours. Median plasma concentrations at Visit 1 (anticipated peak plasma 
concentration) were higher for oral granisetron than granisetron TDS. 
It is important to have sustained exposure to granisetron over the whole time course of ch
emotherapy 
however considering that there is no established relationship between granisetron levels and control of 
CINV, the high degree of variability is not thought clinically re
levant for control of CINV.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacological  characteristics  of  the  patch  showed  that  initially  plasma  concentrations  were  slow  to 
increase and that Cmax was reached at around 48 hours. Granisetron TDS 52 cm

plasma  concentrations  comparable  to  2  mg  oral  granisetron  every  24  hours  However  a lower  median

It  is  important  that  at  the  start  of  emetic  chemotherapy,  patients  have  sufficient  exposure  to 
granisetron to prevent nausea and vomiting and that this exposure is sustained over the time course of 
chemotherapy.  Plasma  levels  of  granisetron  are  poorly  correlated  with  efficacy,  however,  in
  the 
absence of measurements of concentrations at the receptor level they are the best surrogate available 
to indicate that sufficient exposure to granisetron has been achieved to be of therapeutic benefit.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: (1) Male or female aged; ≥ 18 yrs for the Czech Republic and Russia; ≥ 16 yrs 
for Serbia and Montenegro; ≥ 15 yrs for Bulgaria, India, Mexico, Poland, Romania and the USA (no 
upper limit) (2) Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed cancer and an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) status of ≤ 2. (3) Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months; (4) Assigned to receive the 
first cycle of a new multi-day MEC or HEC regimen including the daily administration of a cytotoxic 
regimen with the emetogenic potential of level 3-5 (Hesketh 1997) for 3-5 days. 
Main exclusion criteria: (i) hypersensitivity to adhesive plasters; (ii) contraindications to 5-HT3 
receptor antagonists; (iii)any cause for nausea and vomiting other than CINV (iii) any episode of 
retching, vomiting or uncontrolled nausea in the 72 hour period prior to chemotherapy administration; 
(iv) clinically relevant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (at the discretion of the 
investigator) and/or a baseline QT corrected for heart beat (QTc) > 450 ms for male patients or a 
baseline QTc > 470 ms for female patients; (v) Other 5-HT3, neurokinin-1 (NK1) or dopamine 
antagonists. 
Treatments 
Treatments Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio: (i) GTDS 
+ placebo capsule; (ii) placebo patch + active capsule (2 mg oral granisetron). The patch was applied 
1-2 days prior to the first dose of MEC or HEC and remained in place for a full 7 days in all patients 
(e.g. Saturday 7 pm to Saturday 7 pm). The capsule was administered 1 h prior to MEC or HEC on 
each day the HEC or MEC cytotoxic agent or combination of cytotoxics was administered. 
Prior and concomitant therapy. Some of the treatments were considered as criteria for exclusion 
due to violations of the protocol, depending on when the concomitant medication was administered: (i) 
concomitant radiotherapy of total body, brain or upper abdomen within one week of study entry or 
planned during the study; (ii) intake of medication to control the symptoms of a brain tumour, brain 
metastasis or seizure disorder; (iii) patients using SSRI antidepressants (unless a stable dose for the 
duration of the study); (iv) scheduled to receive an neurotising NK1 receptor antagonist, dopamine 
receptor antagonist or another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist between 72 h prior to the administration of 
the chemotherapy and patch removal 
Concomitant use of corticosteroids The concomitant use of prophylactic corticosteroids was 
permitted throughout the study according to local clinical practice.   
Rescue Medication. The investigator was permitted to prescribe rescue medication, in accordance 
with the site’s standard of care, to be taken by the patient, as required. There were no restrictions on 
the use of anti-emetic drugs as rescue medication except those known to cause prolongation of QTc. 
Patients recorded details of the medication taken, including time, in their diary card. 
Objectives 
The null hypothesis was that granisetron TDS was inferior to oral granisetron.  
Non-inferiority margin. The applicant employed delta for Non-inferiority margin as 15%. 
The applicant justified the chosen NI margin for multiday type CINV as follows: 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 34/69
 
 
 
 
(1) The historical evidences for efficacy, including the effect of intravenous 5-HT3-RA plus 
dexamethasone in multiday type of CINV (3 to 5 days of cisplatin administration) as shown during 
MASCC Perugia 2004 Consensus conference.  
(2) Clinical judgement of the scientific advisory board.  
(3) Superiority of the reference product over placebo: numerical difference is estimated from 24% to 
35%.  
(4). Additive effect of dexamethasone. The argumentation is based on (i) an estimated minimum 
relative value for granisetron TDS (~7%) that is falling within chosen 15% of NI margin and (ii) similar 
to 15/C study design approach taken in previous study for palonsetron authorisation.  
The 2-sided 95% confidence interval of difference was obtained via a logistic regression, adjusting for 
study treatment, gender, planned duration of chemotherapy regimen (3, 4/5 days), planned 
cisplatin/corticosteroid use, and chemotherapy naive status (yes, no) as recorded in IVRS (called 
“planned chemotherapy naivety”). A main effects model was used. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the trial was the composite endpoint complete control (CC) of CINV over the 
whole period at risk from the first dose of chemotherapy to 24 hours after the last dose of 
chemotherapy (3, 4 or 5 days). CC was defined in study 15/C as no vomiting and/or retching, no more 
than mild nausea and no rescue medication. 
The main secondary efficacy endpoints were: (i) time from start of MEC or HEC to treatment failure 
(failure of CC); (ii) time from start of MEC or HEC to treatment failure (failure of CR, i.e. no vomiting 
and/or retching and no rescue medication); (iii) time from start of MEC or HEC to first administration of 
rescue medication; (iv) time from start of MEC or HEC to first emetic episode (vomiting/retching); (v) 
Time from start of MEC or HEC to first episode of more than mild nausea; (vi) Percentage of patients 
achieving CC of CINV overall and during different time periods. 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study was based on efficacy considerations. In particular, it was based upon 
the primary efficacy endpoint: the percentage of patients achieving CC of CINV during the period (from 
the first administration until 24 h after the last administration of ME or HE multi day chemotherapy). 
The null hypothesis was that the TDS is inferior to oral granisetron. The alternative hypothesis was 
that the TDS is not inferior (by greater than a non-inferiority margin Δ) to oral granisetron. 
The hypothesis was tested via construction of a two-sided 95% confidence interval around the 
difference in percentage CC between the 2 treatment groups (D). If the lower limit of this confidence 
interval was greater than -Δ, the null hypothesis was rejected. 
Setting the reference rate for CC with oral granisetron to 50%, an absolute non-inferiority margin of 
15%, and 90% power, 576 patients (288 per group) were required. This assumed that there was no 
clinical difference (i.e. D=0) between oral granisetron and GTDS. This sample number was 
conservative in the sense that it was based on the CC rate for oral granisetron which gave the highest 
required sample size. However, it did not allow for an interstratum difference in effect size.  Analysis of 
the primary endpoint was carried out on both the FAS and the PPS. As the PPS was likely to be smaller 
than the FAS and assuming 9% drop out, based on the GTDS Phase II study, the randomisation of 
approximately 630 patients in all (315 per treatment group), yielding a PPS of 576 patients, was 
planned.

Randomisation 
Once patients were confirmed as eligible for the study and had completed all screening procedures, 
they were each assigned a unique randomisation number by a centralized randomisation procedure 
using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). After randomisation, the patient received a unique 
blinded number, allocated by the IVRS, corresponding to the patient’s randomised treatment group. 
After matching the appropriate patient pack with the patient pack number, in accordance with the 
IVRS, patients were dispensed medication by the investigator or the designee. The patient pack 
number was entered in the CRF. A randomisation list was generated independently by a statistician, 
not involved in the conduct or management of the study, using the validated computer programme 
SAS, Version 8.02. 
A random permuted block design was used to obtain a 1:1 ratio with categories using the following 
stratification variables: 
• Gender 
• Chemotherapy regimen: 
1. Cisplatin chemotherapy regimen, 
2. Non-cisplatin chemotherapy regimen with planned use of corticosteroids 
3. Non-cisplatin chemotherapy regimen without planned use of corticosteroids 
• Duration of planned chemotherapy (3 day versus 4/5 day) 
• Chemotherapy naive versus non-naive 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-dummy method was used to ensure blinding. Each patient received a patch (active or 
placebo) and an appropriate number of capsules (active or placebo). The patches containing 
granisetron and patches without granisetron were of identical appearance, as were the capsules 
containing granisetron and placebo capsules. 
The investigator did not break the treatment code unless knowledge of the patient's treatment was 
required for the patient's clinical care and safety. If unblinding was considered necessary the 
respective patient was withdrawn from the study after unblinding. 
Statistical methods 
Study populations. Several populations for statistical analysis were defined for this study. Full 
Analysis Set. The Full Analysis Set (FAST) was defined as all randomised patients who received study 
treatment (GTDS or capsule) and had at least one efficacy assessment after the start of chemotherapy. 
Per Protocol Set. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was defined as all FAST patients without violations of the 
protocol which directly impinged on or affected the primary endpoint. Safety Set. The Safety Set (SS) 
was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (GTDS or capsule). 
Handling of outliers and missing data. Missing data were not imputed, except for the analysis of 
efficacy endpoints, where the following assumptions were made: (i) If severity of event was missing 
the worse case was assumed; (ii) If time of event/rescue medication was missing but the date 
corresponded to a chemotherapy day then the time was set to 1 minute (min) after start of that day’s 
chemotherapy; (iii) Nausea and vomiting starting prior to the first chemotherapy on day 1 were

ignored; (iv) Patients who withdrew from the study during the primary endpoint evaluation period were 
assumed not to have attained the primary endpoint (i.e. not achieved CC).

Recruitment 
First patient enrolled: 24 January 2006

Conduct of the study 
Several amendments were introduced (i) Country-Specific Amendment 1 as requested by local 
Regulatory Authorities (exclude minors in some countries), (ii) Global Amendment 1 as requested by 
the FDA (mainly introducing the aspects of QT prolongation measurements), and (iii) changes in SAP 
(main of them – changing the definition of „overall emetogenicity“ from average to maximal observed; 
primary endpoint results was examined not via an unadjusted logistic regression. but the normal 
approximation to the binomial.) (iv) additional changes before unblinding (omitting metabolites 
analysis [due to unavailability of validated methods], method of tabulation of TEAE, omitting capturing 
prior CINV); (v) Additional changes post unblinding (as some subjects had been incorrectly 
included/excluded from the PPS. This was corrected post unblinding and all affected tables, figures and 
listings were re-run).

 Individual data on medical history, related to primary disease reveal that in general primary tumour 
sites were comparable. More then 40 % had metastatic disease. The history of disease therapy for the 
treatment groups was comparable with regards to history of radiotherapy, number of curses; history of 
chemotherapy and number of previous courses. The most common past relevant medical conditions 
were comparable by system – organ class.

There was a broad range of primary disease. Pro-emetogenic primary diseases (i.e. Gastrointestinal 
and gynaecological malignancies) were balanced in both treatment arms. Pro-emetogenicity of CNS 
metastases was not captured however it was acknowledged by the CHMP that this influence might be 
minor due to defined exclusion criteria (any condition likely to cause nausea and vomiting other than 
CINV), randomization and short duration to efficacy assessment (5 days).

Chemotherapy and their emetogenicity. 
An external expert classified the 159 unique regimens applied in the pivotal study into 28 sets (15 HEC 
and 13 MEC regimens) which were equally balanced in the oral and the TDS group. The algorithm to 
calculate the emetogenicity for combination chemotherapy was proposed as published by Hesketh 
(1997)1. This algorithm was introduced prior to unblinding into this study as the amendment following 
expert advice. The CHMP considered the Hesketh score as informative for the regulatory purpose for 
this application.

Concomitant medication. The use of antiemetogenic concomitant medicines was slightly higher in 
the TDS group (up to 12- 13%, firstly for propulsives, antihistamines, and benzodiazepines).  
Concomitant corticosteroid use was comparable between groups (median dosage was 8 and 7.5 mg of 
dexamethasone equivalent per day).  Of the 621 patients included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), 396 
were also administered corticosteroids.  As anticipated the use of corticosteroids with cisplatin was high 
(277/446 = 62.1%) and stratification according to cisplatin use helped ensure that the use of 
corticosteroids overall in the study was balanced between the two groups (oral: 201 patients; 
granisetron TDS: 195 patients). The majority of patients used them not as rescue medications. The 
use of non-rescue concomitant therapy was comparable between both treatments groups.

The corticosteroid use was analysed for the Full analysis set.  All corticosteroids used during the 24 hours prior to the start of 
chemotherapy and during days on which chemotherapy was given were included, unless identified in the case report form as 
‘rescue medication’.  Corticosteroids with a respiratory indication are excluded (4 patients).; a: British National Formulary, 2007 ;

Treatment compliance and patch adhesion. The majority of patients (~76%) in both treatment 
groups had the patch on for 7 days and most of the patients (~90%) for primary evaluation had taken 
a capsule for the correct number of days. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall 715 patients were screened to yield 621 in the FAS and 582 in the PPS.  The disposition of the 
patients is depicted in Table 21 and Figure 12.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoint (Complete Control) 
In the PPS population the percentage of patients who achieved CC from the first administration until 
24 hours after the start of the last day’s administration of the MEC or HEC regimen was comparable 
between granisetron TDS and the oral groups with the point estimate of the difference between groups 
of –4.89% (95% CI–12.91%; 3.15). 
Since the lower limit of this confidence interval was above –15%, the null hypothesis was rejected and 
the alternative hypothesis was accepted, i.e. that granisetron TDS was non-inferior to oral granisetron.   
The results of the supportive analysis of the primary endpoint on the FAS were similar to the results 
obtained for the PPS (see Table 32). The percentage of patients achieving complete control was 
comparable between the two treatment groups.

The CHMP noted that only one cycle of chemotherapy was included in the pivotal study 392MD/15/C, 
and therefore the activity during further cycles of chemotherapy is unknown. The applicant explained 
that is not seeking specific wording in the indication relating to use over multiple cycles. This was 
acknowledged by the CHMP and included in 5.1 of the SmPC.

Secondary Endpoints. A number of secondary efficacy analyses revealed similar differences in 
secondary efficacy assessment including the estimated point differences as assessed via complete 
response and total control ranging from -3.8% to -6.58% for PPS population and from -4.5% to -
7.74% for FAST population (see Table 36). The lower bound of the 95% CI was below settled delta of 
15% only in one case – CR in FAST and above -15% for all the rest response analyses.

The efficacy analysis by Day showed results consistent with the overall non-inferiority conclusion of the 
primary analysis. On Day 1, the estimated point difference was –4.89%; 95% confidence interval (-
12.91%, +3.13%) for the PPS. Although the estimated difference between the means for CC is 
greatest on Day 1 the lower bound of the 95% CI remains above -15%, demonstrating consistency 
with the primary efficacy endpoint.

The CHMP noted that since non inferiority was shown for the primary endpoint, and the endpoints are 
all related, it is not surprising that the small, non significant difference of –4.89% observed in the 
primary endpoint between the TDS and oral groups was generally apparent across the secondary 
endpoints.

The CHMP acknowledged that these data represent somewhat comparable trends in distribution. 
Ancillary analyses 
Heterogeneity 
The CHMP raised questions regarding the design of the pivotal study mainly due to a wide variety of 
chemotherapy regimens administered, likely regional differences in patient care and concerns that the 
randomisation and the statistical analysis does not consider the influence of emetogenicity potential of 
primary diseases possibly confounding the complete control positives or negatives giving rise to 
concerns about the comparability of treatment groups and the assay sensitivity of the study. 
In response the applicant emphasized that the concept of this development were the comparison of 
two routes of delivery of granisetron in which the only difference expected between these routes was 
PK. To address the issue of wide variety of chemotherapy regimens the applicant argued that the 
treatment regimens used in Study 392MD/15/C were examined by an expert independent oncologist 
and grouped into 28 categories with similar emetogenic chemotherapies (MEC or HEC) which where 
balance in both treatment arms. According to the applicant these groupings are expected to reduce the 
perceived heterogeneity among the treatment regimens. Furthermore the most important variables of 
treatment are the inclusion or exclusion of cisplatin and the classifying of the treatment as moderately 
or highly emetogenic.  
In Study 392MD/15/C, 69.9% of patients received a cisplatin-based regimen. Cisplatin is the most 
frequently used chemotherapeutic agent in multiple day chemotherapy. The Applicant provided further 
analysis of the balance of chemotherapy regimens administered between treatment groups in Study 
392MD/15/C in Table 9. and noted that the data confirm that cisplatin use by day was also balanced 
between the treatment groups.  
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 45/69
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant performed a logistic regression analysis for effect modification in the pivotal Study 
392MD/15/C. Table 10 below summarizes the results of the logistic regression analysis taking into 
account five selected factors (regimen (cisplatin present/absent); emetogenicity of regimen (MEC or 
HEC); Country, Region, emetogenic potential of primary disease).  
In all five cases the P value for the interaction did not achieve statistical significance (P > 0.05). 
Therefore the applicant concluded that the treatment effect is similar, except for random fluctuations 
across the subgroups. 
Further to these analyses, the applicant provided several arguments related to other clinical studies for 
the development of anti-emetics for CINV, the standardize management of monitoring in study 
392MD/15/C, as well as the evaluation of assay sensitivity of the study. 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report

The CHMP agreed that primary disease is not an important factor in emetogenicity, provided the 
primary site is outside the CNS; only primary brain tumor or brain metastases can have an impact on 
nausea and vomiting. The CHMP acknowledged that at baseline patients in the studies of other anti-
emetics had a broad range of primary disease with varying emetogenic potential; thus study 
392MD/15/C was conducted in line with this approach and precedent. Investigators launching a clinical 
trial intended to assess the efficacy of an antiemetic drug are free to choose among all the available 
regimens a few regimes within the same emetogenicity class (HEC or MEC). However CHMP 
emphasized that the use of a wide range of regimes in the same trial as much as different primary 
diseases and regional differences in patient care can make the comparability of treatment groups 
difficult and may compromise the assay sensitivity of studies. However it is acknowledged that in this 
case the pivotal trial shows non inferiority versus the 2mg oral dosage for the overall population 
providing valuable information close to a real live scenario making the study sufficiently informative for 
a new mode of administration in a substance with established benefit risk profile.  
Clinical relevance of inferior plasma levels 
During the procedure the applicant was requested to provide argumentation that the difference in 
plasma levels between granisetron oral and granisetron patch is not clinically relevant concerning 
efficacy overall and specially during the first day of chemotherapy. 
The applicant used a logistic regression to test for an association between each PK parameter and 
achieving CC on Day 1.  
Methodologically the logistic regression model assumed a linear relationship between the log odds of 
achieving CC and log transformed PK parameters, i.e. a sigmoidal relationship between the probability 
of achieving CC and log transformed PK parameters. This analysis included PK parameter, treatment 
group, Day 1 emetogenicity, chemotherapy naïve, gender, age and all interactions. In each case, the 
PK parameter was included in the model and the remaining were added, if significant (P < 0.05), in a 
stepwise fashion. The final models for each of the PK parameters are presented in Table 1, Table 2 
and Table 3 below. 
For both AUC and Cmax no statistically significant association with CC was observed, suggesting that 
within the range covering both granisetron TDS and oral granisetron at 2 mg QD, CC on the first day of 
chemotherapy is not dependent on daily granisetron exposure or achieved maximum levels. The 
relationship between observed plasma concentration and % CC on Day 1 was statistically significant (P 
= 0.0038). 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 47/69
 
 
 
 
 
The geometric mean plasma level was 2.2-fold higher for oral granisetron compared to granisetron 
TDS. Figure 1 (log scale) and Figure 2 (linear scale) shows the modelled probability of achieving CC 
on Day 1, and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Figure 1 and shows that based on the obtained 
statistically significant association, the change in the probability of achieving CC on D1 across the 
range of observed granisetron plasma levels at the start of chemotherapy for oral granisetron and 
granisetron TDS is shallow. Figure 1 also shows the observed D1 CC figures (82.0% for granisetron 
TDS and 88.5% for oral granisetron). This demonstrates that a 14-fold increase in granisetron levels 
would be required to increase the probability of achieving CC from 82 to 88.5%, which is much higher 
than the observed 2.2-fold difference in geometric mean granisetron plasma levels for oral granisetron 
and granisetron TDS. 
The applicant provided also predicted probabilities of achieving CC for treatment groups, based on 
granisetron geometric mean levels (see Table 4) for the two treatment groups, based on the 
modeled relationship and noted that based on this relationship the observed difference in geometric 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 48/69
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mean plasma levels for oral granisetron and granisetron TDS would lead to only a minimal difference in 
the probability of achieving CC (84.4% for granisetron TDS and 86.4% for oral granisetron), with the 
95% CIs almost completely overlapping.  
Furthermore the applicant noted that the observed plasma levels in the granisetron oral and TDS 
groups at Visit 1 differ by a factor of 2.2 in geometric mean. An oral 1 mg twice daily (BID) dosing 
regimen is approved for CINV and therefore by implication is considered equally as effective as 2 mg 
QD. The plasma level one hour after the first dose (i.e. the start of chemotherapy) dosing for the 2 mg 
QD regimen would be expected to be 2-fold that for the oral 1 mg BID dosing regimen. Thus, a 
difference in plasma level of the order of approximately 2-fold, as observed when comparing oral 
granisetron to granisetron TDS, should be acceptable. It is also noteworthy that in both treatment 
groups the granisetron level at the start of chemotherapy was below LLOQ (0.05) in a number of 
subjects. This number was more than twice as high in the oral granisetron group compared to the 
granisetron TDS group: 26/235 (11.1%) vs 12/230 (5.2%) respectively. 
Besides overall CC, oral granisetron and granisetron TDS were also compared based on CC on each 
individual day. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6 below. The criterion for non-
inferiority was met for each individual day of treatment, as the lower limit of the 95% CIs were above 
the non-inferiority margin of -15%. The applicant noted that for granisetron TDS the % CC on each 
day was relatively constant. For oral granisetron a marked drop in % CC was observed on Days 2-5 
relative to Day 1. This observation was also confirmed statistically, comparing CC on Days 1 and 2 for 
both oral granisetron and granisetron TDS using McNemar’s test (Oral: P <0.001; TDS: P = 0.212).  
The applicant noted that in view of this observation, the possible relevance of differences in 
granisetron plasma levels in terms of clinical efficacy may be questioned, as the observed drop in % 
CC after Day 1 for oral granisetron cannot be explained by changes in granisetron plasma 
concentrations or exposure. 
For oral granisetron, exposure even increases slightly during continued use due to accumulation to 
steady-state levels (see Study 392MD/11/C where oral graniseteron is taken for 5 days). Granisetron 
TDS is designed to deliver relatively constant granisetron levels for multiple days (as confirmed in the 
performed clinical pharmacology studies) and therefore plasma levels will be relatively similar on the 
first and second day of chemotherapy. The applicant argued that therefore on the second day of 
chemotherapy the difference in granisetron plasma levels for oral granisetron and granisetron TDS can 
be considered to be at least similar to Day 1. However on Day 2 only a marginal difference in % CC 
was observed. This might highlight the lack of a clear dependency of CC on granisetron levels, when 
comparing granisetron TDS and oral granisetron at 2 mg QD. 
Sancuso

The CHMP acknowledged that the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application 
of the transdermal patch and possible slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron at 
the start of chemotherapy can be managed with clear instructions in the SmPC that the TDS should be 
applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy. 
The slower onset of efficacy can be balanced restricting the indication to patients having swallowing 
difficulties where the benefits of a transdermal system are obvious.

Gender differences. Study 15/C revealed tendency for better efficacy of granisetron TDS in females 
vs. males. According to the applicant, the reason for having lower bound of the 95% CI below -15% in 
males as compared to females is due to underpowered study for this analysis. In addition, the efficacy 
results do not correlate with exposure differences between males and females. 
Corticosteroid Use. The CC proportions divided by CS use and by emetogenicity or cisplatin use were 
assessed and study results revealed comparable point estimates. CSs had an additive effect on CC 
during PEEP, although without significant interaction during a logistic regression analysis. The effect 
was observed in both study arms, numerically more in Oral vs TDS groups, 7.2% vs 5.1%, 
respectively.

granisetron TDS with oral granisetron in CINV following a single day administration of MEC. The trial 
was conducted at 21 sites in Germany.  
The trial was constructed to allow study of both pre and post 24-hour phases of CINV following 
chemotherapy. The primary analysis was on TC of CINV for the period 24 to 120 hours following 
chemotherapy administration (i.e. delayed CINV). Total control (TC) was defined as no nausea, no 
vomiting, no use of rescue medication and no withdrawal from the study. 
Inclusion criteria: (i) ECOG status < 2; (ii) Life expectancy of at least 3 months; (iii) Chemotherapy-
naïve for at least 6 months since last chemotherapy; (iv) At least 3 weeks since last major surgery, 
including thoracotomy, laparotomy, craniotomy or vascular surgery involving the major vessels; (v) 
Scheduled to receive a single-day regimen of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (i.e. any dose of 
carboplatin, epirubicin, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, mitoxantrone; methotrexate (>250 mg/m2), 
cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m2), doxorubicin (>25 mg/m2) or cisplatin (<50 mg/m2) infused over 
1-4 hours. 
Exclusion criteria: (i) Tumours of the head, neck or stomach; (ii) Received radiation therapy involving 
the abdomen or pelvis within the 48 hours period prior to, or were scheduled to receive such radiation, 
during the treatment period. 
Unlike Study 15/C, the exploratory 8/C study was designed without CS use. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving TC of CINV for the period 24 to 
120 hours following chemotherapy administration (i.e. delayed CINV). This was a superiority study for 
delayed CINV: based on a logistic regression model (with treatment, centre, gender and use of nicotine 
as factors), the 2-sided hypothesis that the granisetron TDS is not different to the single oral dose of 
granisetron (2 mg) was tested with an α level of 0.0499 on data from the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population. 
Secondary endpoints were: (i) proportion of patients achieving TC of CINV during the 0-24 hour time 
period post chemotherapy; (ii) proportion of patients achieving TC of CINV during the 0-120 hour time 
period post chemotherapy. 
Oral active and oral placebo were taken 1 hour before the administration of ME chemotherapy. Patches 
were applied 24 hours before chemotherapy and remained in-situ for 4 days after chemotherapy – 5 
days in total. 
Originally a total of 210 patients were planned to be randomised. However, an interim analysis of the 
results all patients enrolled until 31 March 2005 (133 patients) suggested that although the 
granisetron TDS showed comparable efficacy to oral granisetron for the first 24 hours, there was no 
evidence of superiority during the period 24 - 120 hours post chemotherapy. Therefore, patient 
recruitment was halted at the end of April 2005, at which time 179 patients had been randomised. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of granisetron TDS has been studied in ten clinical studies involving 1,386 subjects (576 
healthy subjects and 810 cancer patients with CINV), of whom approximately 58 % were the target 
patient population - cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The clinical development strategy was 
designed to bridge to the previous findings of efficacy and safety for the reference product. The 
performed study program as well as the size of the database is considered adequate for this hybrid 
application. 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 55/69
 
 
 
 
During the procedure the design of the pivotal study was challenged mainly due to a wide variety of 
chemotherapy regimens administered, likely regional differences in patient care and concerns 
that the randomisation and the statistical analysis not considering the influence of emetogenicity 
potential of primary diseases possibly confounding the complete control positives or negatives giving 
rise to concerns about the comparability of treatment groups and the assay sensitivity of the study. 
The applicant argued that the development of granisetron was not based on NME but on new route of 
administration and could show that from 28 categories with similar emetogenic chemotherapies, the 
most important variables – the fact of cisplatin administration and the emetogencity (MEC or HEC) 
were balanced between the study arms. 
Using logistic regression analysis for effect modification in the pivotal Study taking account the five 
most relevant selected factors (regimen (cisplatin present/absent); emetogenicity of regimen (MEC or 
HEC); Country, Region and emetogenic potential of two essential primary diseases (gynecology and 
GI) the applicant could show that the P value for the interaction did not achieve statistical significance 
(P > 0.05). 
Regional differences in patient care were addressed through standardized management without any 
findings indicating regional differences in care.  
The challenging of the assay sensitivity of the pivotal study was addressed by conducting several 
sensitivity analyses to confirm non-inferiority, in particular, examining subgroups of patients who 
received cisplatin-containing regimens and showing consistent results. The CHMP acknowledged that in 
this case the pivotal trial shows non inferiority versus the 2mg tablet for the overall population 
providing valuable information close to a real live scenario and making the study sufficiently 
informative for a new mode of administration in a substance with established benefit risk profile.  
The applicant provided relevant arguments why the difference in plasma levels between granisetron 
oral and granisetron TDS should not be clinically relevant concerning efficacy overall and specially 
during the first day of chemotherapy arguing that the observed statistically significant difference of 2.2 
times in mean plasma levels on D1 is close to the difference observed in another approved posology 
for oral granisetron (1mg BID vs 2 mg QD), that the probabilities to achieve CC on D1 for TDS and oral 
formulation are quite close each to other (0.844 vs 0.864, respectively) and that there are 
inconsistencies in changes in plasma concentrations as compared to changes in respective CC 
proportions highlighting the lack of a clear dependency of CC on granisetron levels. 
The CHMP acknowledged that the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application 
of the transdermal patch and possible slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron at 
the start of chemotherapy can be managed with clear instructions in the SmPC that the TDS should be 
applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy. 
The slower onset of efficacy can be balanced restricting the indication to patients having swallowing 
difficulties where the benefits of a transdermal system are obvious. 
The CHMP recommended including QoL (Functional Living Index of Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire) as an 
assessment in the future clinical programme, including the ongoing paediatric studies. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For this Hybrid application the applicant performed one clinical pivotal study to show non inferiority of 
the granisetron TDS to 2mg tablet. Concerns of heterogeneity in the design of the pivotal study and 
inferior plasma levels at day 1 leading to inferior efficacy at day 1 were adequately addressed by the 
applicant.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of granisetron TDS is based on the clinical studies performed with this formulation and the 
available post-marketing safety data for this medicinal product. The main source for the integrated 
safety profile is based on two studies with cancer patients (8/C and 15/C); the integrated summary for 
healthy subjects is also presented. In addition, the safety profile of the reference product is taken into 
consideration. 
Patient exposure 
In the original studies 796 (392 healthy subjects, 404 cancer patients) were exposed to granisetron 
TDS. Across these studies, durations of exposure varied from 1 day to 23 days. The majority of healthy 
subjects wore the 52 cm² TDS for a minimum of 6 days (range 1-23 days) with 202 healthy subjects 
exposed to granisetron TDS for 23 days. All the cancer patients were exposed to the 52 cm² TDS, the 
majority for 5, 6, or 7 days with 246 cancer patients treated for 7 days.  
The mean age of the cancer group was 55 years and the healthy population was 37 years. The overall 
age range in studies was 16 – 86 years and the populations were predominantly of Caucasian 
ethnicity.  
In addition, post-marketing safety data covering a 21 months period of use in the US (12 September 
2008 through 11 June 2010) was also provided. 
Adverse events  
In the main study the most commonly reported adverse reaction was constipation, occurring in 
approximately 10.4% of patients. The majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report

Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 58/69
 
 
 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
During the assessment process the applicant acknowledged a potential underreporting of the adverse 
events headache, constipation, dizziness and asthenia/fatigue and argued that comparisons across 
trials are cofounded by study-specific differences such as schedules of chemotherapy and patient visits, 
dose and study design as well as possibly by the higher familiarity of physicians with granisetron-
containing products compared to the initial trials. Therefore the MAH included in addition, adverse 
reactions reported for other formulations of granisetron as class effects into the SmPC. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The application included reports of two serious adverse events (SAEs) that were observed in the 
healthy subject studies - a cerebrovascular accident in Study 26/C (considered by the investigator to 
be unrelated) and atrial fibrillation case in Study 40/C (considered possibly related).  
Twenty-two granisetron TDS patients recorded 33 SAEs (5.45%) compared with twenty patients in the 
oral granisetron group who recorded 32 SAEs (4.9%). Four cancer patients reported related events - 
three patients in the oral granisetron group had QTc prolongation reported as an SAE and one subject 
in the granisetron TDS group had constipation. 
Eighteen cancer patients died as a result of AEs during the clinical trials; ten of the patients were 
treated with granisetron TDS and eight received oral granisetron. None of the deaths was considered 
related to granisetron TDS. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, there were no significant consistent patterns of alterations in biochemistry, haematology and 
urinalysis measurements for the cancer population.  Changes in vital signs data were not considered 
significant. 
Other significant events 
Skin irritation and sensitisation 
The evaluation of skin irritation and sensitisation was primarily based on an analysis of 201 healthy 
volunteers included in study 26/C. 
Generally, in all studies healthy subject population 46 AEs were recorded for application site erythema 
of granisetron TDS, seven AEs for application site pruritus, four AEs for application site irritation, four 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 59/69
 
 
 
 
AEs for application site reaction, two AEs for application site papules, one for application site dryness, 
one for application site eczema and one for application site pain.  
Dermal tolerance in cancer patients was formally assessed in study 8/C. In addition, skin tolerance 
data were collected as AEs in study 15/C. In the cancer patient safety population three AEs were 
recorded for application site pruritis with one case of oedema. Of these, one case of pruritis and the 
oedema case were reported as related to study medication. 
All cases were reported as of mild severity and none led to withdrawal from the studies. 
The results of the dermal tolerance studies in both patients and healthy subjects suggest that mild 
irritant and hypersensitivity reactions are possible with granisetron TDS. As a consequence of this the 
precaution has been included in the EU SmPC Section 4.4.  
Phototoxicity 
Granisetron TDS did not show any potential for photoirritation or photosensitivity when tested in vivo 
in guinea-pigs. Granisetron was not phototoxic when tested in vitro in a mouse fibroblast cell line. 
When tested for potential photogenotoxicity in vitro in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, 
granisetron increased the percentage of cells with chromosome damage following photoirradiation.  
Although, the clinical relevance of this finding is not completely clear, it was recommended to advise 
patients to avoid exposure to sunlight in section 4.4 and to mention the finding in 5.3 of the SmPC  
Possible hypersensitivity/local tolerance 
Hypersensitivity-type adverse events were reported in a total of 65/784 (8.3%) subjects treated with 
granisetron TDS in the clinical programme, including application site erythema (46 [5.9%]); 
application site pruritus (10 [1.3%]); application site irritation (4 [0.5%]); application site reaction (4 
[0.5%]) and hypersensitivity (1 [0.1%]). With the exception of the case of hypersensitivity and two 
cases of application site pruritus, all hypersensitivity type adverse events were considered by the 
Investigator to be related to study treatment. 
In addition, as of 11 June 2011, 13 adverse event reports of hypersensitivity reactions were received 
in the global safety database since launch, including application site erythema (3); application site rash 
(3); application site reaction (3); application site irritation (2); and application site pruritus (2). There 
were no SAE reports of hypersensitivity in the clinical trials for granisetron TDS, and all 13 post 
marketing cases of hypersensitivity type reactions reported were non-serious. 
The CHMP considered that although reports of hypersensitivity reactions in the global safety database 
are rare, the possibility of such an event occurring cannot be ruled out. Hypersensitivity has therefore 
been added as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan, including appropriate pharmacovigilance 
and risk minimization activities. 
Safety in special populations 
Special attention was given to subgroups of patients with impaired hepatic or renal function and no 
new information has been gathered during the course of the development programme for granisetron 
TDS with respect to this patient population. As no studies were performed in children no information is 
available for the paediatric population. 
An analysis of age among granisetron TDS-treated patients was performed and no association with 
increased frequency of occurrence of AEs was found. 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 60/69
 
 
 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies were performed on drug interactions with regard to safety. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events were recorded as the reason for withdrawal in 24 subjects overall: 10 cancer patients 
from the granisetron TDS group, 7 cancer patients from the oral granisetron group and 6 healthy 
subjects from study 26/C and one healthy subject from 40/C.  
In the healthy subject group, five of the withdrawals were considered related to study medication – (3 
cases constipation, 1 case of atrial fibrillation and 1 case of abdominal pain) and one possibly related 
(atrial fibrillation). Three additional cases were unrelated, including an SAE of a cerebrovascular 
accident.  
In cancer patients, most AEs leading to withdrawal were assessed as not related to study medication, 
but instead related to the underlying medical condition or the chemotherapy administered. 
Post marketing experience 
Granisetron TDS was first authorised on 12 September 2008. An Integrated Post-marketing Safety 
Report for granisetron TDS (patch 3.1 mg/24 hours) has been provided in support of the EU licensing 
application. This report covers the 21 month period from 12th September 2008 (IBD) to 11th June 
2010. An estimated 80,940 patches have been distributed since launch through 11 June 2010. Based 
on the distributed patches of 80,940 units into the US market, the patient exposure has been 
estimated at 1,552 treatment years. 
Overall, during this review period, the MAH has received 71 case reports: 34 from HCP, 36 from 
consumers and 1 from clinical trials. Seven reports were serious, two of those concerned cardiac 
disorders: sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrilation. The MAH concluded that a review of all new safety 
information identified during this review period did not reveal any new safety signals. 
Ongoing review of the reported detachment rate from the market gives no indication that this rate may 
be any higher than that reported in the Phase 3 clinical trial. 
One unexplained case of epilepsy was observed postmarketing. The epileptogenicity is one of the 
observed effects in the acute non-clinical toxicity study. The applicant explained that the particular 
patient had a history of complex partial seizures and possible precipitating factors for TEAE. This is 
explanation was considered acceptable CHMP. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of granisetron TDS is based on a database generated in 796 healty subjects and cancer 
patients (392 and 404 cancer respectively). In addition to this, post marketing experience estimated at 
1,552 treatment years and is contributing to the safety profiling. Thus, the size of the safety data base 
and the exposure over time could in principle be acceptable for an application for a new pharmaceutical 
form of a known active substance as it is the case with this application.  
In the clinical studiers granisetron TDS, like other 5-HT3-antagonists, showed an increased risk of 
constipation, headache and hepatotoxicity. The post marketing experience did not reveal any new 
important risk identified and the safety concerns listed as potential risks are endorsed. 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 61/69
 
 
 
 
 
The  CHMP  noted  a  lower  then  historically  expected  reporting  rate  for    oral  granisetron  2mg  in  the 
clinical studies which was explained by the applicant by possible higher familiarity with the granisetron 
product  compared  to  the  initial  trials  and  that  comparisons  across  trials  are  confounded  by  study-
specific differences such as schedules of chemotherapy and patient visits, dose and study design.  
It  was  therefore  considered  adequate  to  add  granisetron  class  effects  seen  with  other  formulations 
(oral and intravenous) in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been associated with QT interval prolongation. However, no clinically 
relevant effects on ECG have been observed in clinical studies with SANCUSO, including a thorough QT 
study in 240 healthy subjects. 
Although no cases of phototoxicity were observed in man, findings in a laboratory model using Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are suggestive of a potential photogenotoxic effect. As a consequence a 
warning regarding exposure to sunlight has been included in sections 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Effects of photogenotoxicity observed in the pre-clinical tests and hypersensitivity reactions as 
observed in the safety database were added to the RMP as important potential risks and were reflected 
adequately in the relevant sections of the SmPC. 
Taking into account the experience with the active substance in other formulations, the CHMP 
considers the safety profile of the patch acceptable.  
The safety profile is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical studies with granisetron TDS and the post marketing experience with the medicinal product 
did  not  reveal  any  new  important  risk.  The  known  safety  profile  of  granisetron  has  been  taken  into 
consideration  and  the  CHMP  concludes  that  the  safety  profile  for  Sancuso  is  acceptable.  The  SmPC 
adequately reflects this body of information.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

Although no evidence of an increased incidence of 
adverse reactions have been observed in 
hepatically-impaired patients receiving granisetron 
orally and intravenously, based on granisetron 
pharmacokinetics, a degree of caution must be 
exercised in this population. 
Cardiac disorders: 
5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as granisetron, 
may be associated with arrhythmias or ECG

No clinical studies have been performed specifically 
to investigate the pharmacokinetics of SANCUSO in 
patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No clear 
relationship between renal function (as measured by 
creatinine clearance) and granisetron clearance was 
identified in population PK modelling. In patients 
with renal failure or hepatic impairment, the 
pharmacokinetics of granisetron were determined 
following a single 40 g/kg intravenous dose of 
granisetron hydrochloride. 
Hepatic impairment: 
In patients with hepatic impairment due to 
neoplastic liver involvement, total plasma clearance 
was approximately halved compared to patients 
without hepatic impairment. Given the wide 
variability in pharmacokinetic parameters of 
granisetron and the good tolerance well above the 
recommended dose, dose adjustment in patients 
with functional hepatic impairment is not necessary. 
Renal impairment: 
No correlation between creatinine clearance and 
total clearance was observed in cancer patients, 
indicating no influence of renal impairment on the

2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet does not meet all the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The 
applicant will address the outstanding minor issues concerning the user consultation before marketing 
the product. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Granisetron TDS delivers over 7 days an average of 3.1 mg of granisetron per day resulting in effective 
plasma concentrations 24-48h after application. Compared to the tablet granisetron TDS has the 
advantage of requiring only a single administration. It can be self applied by the patient at home and 
can be worn for up to 7 days, removing the need for repeated oral doses of granisetron. For Patients 
Sancuso 
CHMP assessment report

with difficulties in swallowing the tablet is not a treatment option. These patients could benefit in an 
outpatient setting from granisetron TDS as they would otherwise have to attend a clinic or be admitted 
for daily i.v. CINV medication. Furthermore applying oral medications if at all possible is difficult and 
uncomfortable for these patients therefore the TDS formulation might might also have positive effects 
on treatment compliance. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
There is no established relationship between granisetron plasma levels and control of CINV. However in 
the absence of measurements of concentrations at receptor level they are the best surrogate available 
to indicate that sufficient exposure to granisetron has been achieved to be of therapeutic benefit. 
Non inferiority to the originator has been robustly demonstrated for the overall population an for all 
days of chemotherapy however the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following 
application of the transdermal patch and the lower median plasma concentration with regards to the 
tablet at the first day of chemotherapy might be indicative for a slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 
mg oral granisetron at the start of chemotherapy. Therefore reference was made in the indication to 
5.1 of the SmPC where this relevant pharmacodynamic property is explained. Furthermore TDS is 
considered to be used in patients where the tablet is not a treatment option. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Granisetron  is  a  known  active  substance  used  for  CINV;  its  general  safety  profile  can  be  considered 
established. There are few new safety concerns regarding granisteron TDS compared to the tablet. 
The results of the dermal tolerance studies in both patients and healthy subjects suggested that mild 
irritant and hypersensitivity reactions are possible with granisetron TDS. Reports of hypersensitivity 
reactions in the global safety database are rare but the possibility of such an event occurring cannot be 
ruled out. In addition to that findings in a laboratory model using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells 
are suggestive of a potential photogenotoxic effect although no cases of phototoxicity were observed in 
man. These new safety issues with the TDS  are acceptable and considered manageable as reflected in 
SmPC and RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of granisetron can be considered established. The clinical relevance of potential 
photogenotoxicity seen in vitro in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line not completely clear and 
was not observed in non clinical in vivo studies or man. This finding is considered manageable as 
reflected in SmPC and RMP 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Nausea and vomiting still remain a major issue for patients receiving chemotherapy. The distress 
resulting from these symptoms can escalate over time, and can potentially lead to a patient’s refusal to 
continue with the most effective anti-tumour therapy. Complications can include dehydration and 
electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition or aspiration pneumonia and can be life-threatening. Failure to 
control these side effects can lead to 25% - 50% of patients delaying or refusing possible life saving

chemotherapy, or can result in increased demands and costs for the healthcare team if chemotherapy 
has to be rescheduled. 
Patients with upper aerodigestive tumours following surgery or radiotherapy can have dry mouth, 
mucositis and/or difficulty in swallowing making oral medications difficult and uncomfortable, or 
impossible in some patients. The possible impact on treatment compliance is reasonable to expect. 
Such patients, when in the outpatient setting, could benefit from granisetron TDS as they would 
otherwise have to attend a clinic or be admitted for daily i.v. CINV medication. 
Therefore the need for new and more convenient administration of antiemetics used for multiday CINV 
is high and the favourable effects of an effective TDS reasonable to expect. 
The safety profile of granisetron is well known and there are only few new safety concerns regarding 
granisteron TDS compared to the tablet such as hypersensitivity reactions and observations of 
photogenotoxicity in the non clinical model. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Granisetron is licensed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer 
therapy, including high-dose cisplatin, which has a strong emetic effect in more than 90 % of patients. 
Oral and i.v. formulations of granisetron have been available for over fifteen years. Granisetron has a 
well established safety profile and the safety concerns specific for the transdermal formulation can be 
adequately managed in clinical practice.  
Nausea and vomiting still remain major issues for patients receiving chemotherapy. Failure to control 
these side effects can lead to delaying or refusing possible life saving chemotherapy. For patients with 
difficulties in swallowing the tablet is not a treatment option. These patients could benefit in an 
outpatient setting from granisetron TDS as they would otherwise have to attend a clinic or be admitted 
for daily i.v. CINV medication. Furthermore applying oral medications if at all possible is difficult and 
uncomfortable for these patients therefore TDS formulation might have also positive effects on 
treatment compliance.  
In a pivotal, randomised, double-blind, Phase III efficacy study the applicant could show non-inferiority 
of granisetron TDS to 2 mg oral granisetron once daily in the prevention of nausea and vomiting in 
patients receiving multi-day chemotherapy for 3 to 5 consecutive days.  
There is no established relationship between granisetron plasma levels and control of CINV and non 
inferiority against the originator has been shown for all days of treatment. However the gradual 
increase in plasma levels of granisetron TDS following application and the lower median plasma 
concentration shown in the pharmacokinetic studies with regards to the tablet at the first day of 
chemotherapy might be indicative for a slower onset of efficacy at the start of chemotherapy compared 
to 2 mg oral granisetron. Therefore reference was made in the indication to 5.1 of the SmPC where 
this relevant pharmacodynamic property is explained. Furthermore TDS is considered to be used in 
patients where the tablet is not a treatment option. 
Considering the apparent benefit having this effective treatment of post chemotherapy nausea and 
vomiting also available for patients who have difficulties to swallow the CHMP consider the risk benefit 
balance for granisetron positive for the following indication: 
SANCUSO transdermal patch is indicated in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting 
associated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, for a planned duration of 3 to 5

consecutive days, where oral anti-emetic administration is complicated by factors making swallowing 
difficult (see section 5.1).

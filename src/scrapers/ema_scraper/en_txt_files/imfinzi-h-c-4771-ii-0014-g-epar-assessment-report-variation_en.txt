2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 
Epidemiology 
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises approximately 15% of all lung cancer diagnoses (American 
Cancer Society 2019).  SCLC is the most aggressive lung cancer subtype characterized by rapid 
tumour growth, high vascularity, genomic instability, and early metastatic dissemination (Gazdar et al, 
Nat Rev 2017). The disease typically presents as bulky symptomatic masses, and mediastinal 
involvement is common.  The cancer is strongly co related with cigarette smoking with almost all SCLC 
patients being current or former smokers (Alexandrov et al, Science 2016). 
The global burden of SCLC remains substantial (GLOBOCAN 2018: Global Cancer Statistics).  In the 
US, approximately 30,000 deaths annually are attributable to SCLC (American Cancer Society 2019). 
Worldwide, this number exceeds 250,000 patients per year (GLOBOCAN 2018: Global Cancer 
Statistics), including over 11,000 in Europe (Alvarado-Luna and Morales-Espinosa, Transl Lung Cancer 
Res 2016). 
Biologic features 
SCLC is characterised by uniform round to spindled-shaped small cells, sparse cytoplasm, high mitotic 
index, necrotic areas (ESMO, 2013). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
SCLC has been traditionally classified into 2 stages according to the extent of disease: limited stage 
(LS) and extensive stage (ES) (Spigel and Socinski, J Thorac Oncol 2013).  At their initial diagnosis, 
approximately 70% of patients present with ES-SCLC.  Based on the TNM staging system, ES-SCLC is 
also defined as Stage IV disease (T any, N any, M 1a/b) or T3 4 due to multiple lung nodules that are 
too extensive or have tumour/nodal volume that is too large to be encompassed in a tolerable 
radiation plan (NCCN Guidelines for SCLC Version 2.2018).  The remaining approximately 30% of 
patients have LS-SCLC, in which tumour involvement is confined to one hemi thorax and can be 
treated in a tolerable radiation field. Patients with LS-SCLC can be treated with chemotherapy and 
radiation with the potential for long-term survival (Stinchcombe et al. 2010).  ES-SCLC has poor 
survival prospects: the median OS is approximately 10 months with a 1-year OS rate of approximately 
40% (Socinski et al. 2009). Chemotherapy alone can palliate symptoms and prolong survival for 
patients with ES-SCLC; however, long-term survival is rare (Johnson et al. 2004; DeMets et al. 2010).

Management 
Since the early 1980s, platinum-based chemotherapy has been the mainstay of ES-SCLC management 
(Aisner et al, Semin Oncol 1986; Sundstrøm et al, JCO 2002; Levy et al, JNCCN 2013).  Until recently, 
etoposide with either carboplatin or cisplatin (EP) followed by active surveillance has largely remained 
the standard of care 1L treatment in the United States and Europe (NCCN Guidelines for SCLC Version 
2.2018; ESMO Guidelines Working Group 2013). As 1L agents, carboplatin or cisplatin-based regimens 
have been demonstrated to be equally effective in terms of OS, progression free survival (PFS), and 
objective response rate (ORR) (Rossi et al, JCO 2012).  In summary, real world evidence from the past 
3 decades in the pre-immunotherapy era has demonstrated that 4 to 6 cycles of etoposide with either 
carboplatin or cisplatin with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as indicated has largely been the 
global standard-of-care 1L treatment in ES-SCLC (Alvarado-Luna and Morales-Espinosa, Transl Lung 
Cancer Res 2016; Calles et al, Clin Transl Oncol 2019). 
Most recently, nonclinical and clinical studies have indicated that blockade of immune checkpoints (PD-
1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) can have a positive effect on antitumor immunity for SCLC. In the first line 
setting, recent data have suggested promising clinical benefits from the combination of a 
chemotherapy backbone with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. IMpower133 was a randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with ES-SCLC who had not previously received treatment and 
demonstrated clinical benefit of atezolizumab (Tecentriq) + etoposide and carboplatin (EC) compared 
with placebo + EC: the median OS was 12.3 months and 10.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 
for death: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.91; p=0.007); the median PFS was 5.2 months and 4.3 months, 
respectively (HR for disease progression or death: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.96; p=0.02) (Horn et al, 
NEJM 2018). Atezolizumab in combination with EC for the first line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC 
has been authorised in the EU (3 September 2019, EMEA/H/C/004143/II/0018). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Durvalumab (Imfinzi) is an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody approved in the EU on 21 September 2018 
as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable (stage III) NSCLC in adults whose 
tumours express PD-L1 on ≥1% of tumour cells and whose disease has not progressed following 
platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.  
The first study to evaluate the clinical activity of durvalumab in the SCLC disease setting was Study 
1108.  This was a Phase I/II, first-time-in-human, multicentre, multi-cohort, open-label, dose-
escalation, and dose-expansion study in the durvalumab clinical development program.  The SCLC 
cohort comprised 21 patients with ES SCLC who had received prior lines of treatment.  Treatment with 
durvalumab demonstrated an ORR of 9.5% (95% CI: 1.2, 30.4), median PFS of 1.5 months (95% CI: 
0.9, 1.8) and median OS of 4.8 months (95% CI: 1.3, 10.4). 
It has been hypothesised that combining single agent immune checkpoint inhibitors might produce an 
additive improvement in tumour response (Larkin et al, NEJM 2015; Postow et al, NEJM 2015). The 
available data in second-line ES-SCLC and available safety data on immunotherapy indicated that a 
combination of two immunotherapies may be more efficacious than a monotherapy approach in ES-
SCLC (Antonia et al, JCO 2016). Given the synergistic potential of durvalumab and tremelimumab 
(anti-CTLA-4), it was hypothesised that the combination of both these drugs with chemotherapy has 
the potential to further improve the response rates and response durability along with OS in patients 
with ES-SCLC. 
The present application is based on the results from Study D419QC00001 (“CASPIAN”), which is an 
ongoing phase III, open-label, randomised,  three-arm, multicentre trial designed to compare the 
Assessment report

efficacy and safety of durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide and 
either carboplatin or cisplatin (D+T+EP, arm 1; D+EP, arm 2) with that of etoposide and either 
carboplatin or cisplatin by themselves (EP alone, arm 3) as first-line treatment in patients with ES-
SCLC. 
The proposed indication which is considered approvable by CHMP is: 
IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 
The recommended dose for IMFINZI monotherapy and IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is 
presented in Table 1. IMFINZI is administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour.

b Patients with a body weight of 30 kg or less must receive weight-based dosing, equivalent to IMFINZI 20 mg/kg in combination 
with chemotherapy every 3 weeks (21 days) for 4 cycles, followed by 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks as monotherapy until weight 
increases to greater than 30 kg. 
c Administer IMFINZI prior to chemotherapy on the same day. 
d  When IMFINZI is administered in combination with chemotherapy, refer to the Prescribing Information for etoposide and 
carboplatin or cisplatin for dosing information. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The Applicant received scientific advice (SA) from the CHMP regarding the design of pivotal trial 
CASPIAN in April 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/2752/3/2016/II). Overall, the recommendations from the CHMP 
regarding the patient population and control arm design were followed by the MAH. Certain remaining 
concerns, such as the role of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy as maintenance 
treatment and the usefulness of PD-L1 IHC as a predictive biomarker are further discussed under 
section 2.4.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Durvalumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a protein being extensively degraded in the patient’s 
body by regular proteolytic mechanisms before excretion. Durvalumab is expected to biodegrade in the 
Assessment report

environment and does not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline 
on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), durvalumab is exempt from the submission of Environmental Risk 
Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Bioanalytical methods 
Durvalumab serum concentrations in the CASPIAN study were measured using the same assay as was 
used for the previous studies included in model development and validation.

The bioanalytical method utilised an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay format to measure the 
concentration of durvalumab in human serum. The bioanalytical method used for the determination of 
anti-durvalumab antibodies in human serum uses a tiered approach where clinical samples were tested 
in screening, confirmatory, titer, and nAb assays.  The ADA screening assay is a homogeneous double-
bridging ECL assay. The nAb assay is a ligand-binding sandwich immunoassay. 
Method validation and sample analysis supporting the clinical studies were conducted in accordance 
with approved standard operating procedures and in compliance with relevant sections of 21 CFR part 
58. 
Pop PK analyses 
A two-compartment PopPK model with both linear and nonlinear eliminations was initially developed 
for durvalumab and later amended to a two-compartment PopPK model with linear elimination and 
time-varying clearance. Residuals were described by a combined error model. The time-varying PK 
model structure was implemented based on the equation below: 
TVCL = baseline linear clearance, Tmax = logarithm maximum change in clearance, t =TAD, γ = 
sigmoid factor, T50= time at half-maximum change effect in clearance.  
The previous PopPK analyses were based on pooled data from Phase 2 study ATLANTIC and Phase 
1b/2 study 1108 after durvalumab monotherapy in patients with solid tumors (6984 samples from 
1310 subjects). Dose levels of Study 1108 ranged from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W IV and from 15 mg/kg 
Q3W IV to 20 mg/kg Q4W IV. ATLANTIC used a dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W IV. The PopPK model was used 
to characterise the PK profile of durvalumab in patients with solid tumors, investigate the impact of 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors on PK and evaluate the need for dose adjustment in special populations.  
The PopPK model was externally validated with PK data in CASPIAN (DCO: Mar 11, 2019), 647 
evaluable durvalumab concentrations (validation dataset) from 259 ES-SCLC patients (validation 
subjects) in the durvalumab + EP group. Predicted durvalumab concentrations for validation subjects 
were obtained by fixing the parameters in the structural and variance model to the parameter 
estimates in the final model using post-hoc Bayesian forecasting with NONMEM 7. Bias (mean 
prediction error) and precision (root mean squared prediction error) were computed for each patient, 
then a t-test was used to check whether the mean prediction error across patients was significantly 
different from zero.  
Goodness-of-fit analyses by standard sets of diagnostic plots, visual predictive checks (VPCs), and 
numerical predictive checks (NPCs) were performed. Based on the PopPK external validation results, 
the previous PopPK model underpredicted the observed durvalumab PK data from the durvalumab + 
EP group in CASPIAN as shown in Figure 1.

The durvalumab PopPK model was then refitted with PK data from the validation dataset only. Model 
structure remained, however, given the sparse PK sampling in the CASPIAN study, majority of the 
parameters were fixed during the refitting.  
Initially, only the typical value estimates of CL, V1 and Tmax were re-estimated. Post hoc covariate 
analysis indicated the model did not adequately capture the body weight effect on CL since there was a 
significant correlation between body weight and ηCL (p=0.004). Therefore, the exponent of weight on 
CL was also re-estimated along with CL, V1 and Tmax. The updated PopPK model well described data 
from the CASPIAN study. The general goodness-of-fit plots, pcVPC (see Figure 2 and Figure 3), and 
NPC indicated that both the fixed and random effect components of the refitted PopPK model were 
reflective of the observed data.

The mean bias for validation subjects was 0.0847% (95% CI [-0.030%, 0.200%]) which was not 
significantly different from zero (p value=0.147). The mean imprecision was 5.11% (95% CI [4.75%, 
5.47%]).

The model estimated typical CL was 0.226 L/day and V1 was 3.13 L which were respectively 15.0% 
and 10.8% lower than that estimated in previous developed PopPK model (CL=0.266 L/day and 
V1=3.51 L) (Table 5). The estimated Tmax decreased from -0.27 to -0.772 in the updated model, 
suggested a greater reduction in CL over time. The updated model also estimated a greater effect of 
body weight on CL, with the exponent increased from 0.302 to 0.531. 
The geometric mean (%CV) of post hoc individual CLss and Vss estimates were 0.164 L/day (31.3%) 
and 5.48 L (13.9%), respectively, and the mean (%CV) of %change in post hoc individual CL 
estimates from baseline to steady state after 12 weeks dosing was -25.2% (10.5%).

Impact of covariates 
The effects of existing covariates (body weight, ALB, CRCL, sex, LDH and ECOG) on PK parameters 
were well described by the updated model. Post hoc evaluation showed that the absolute difference in 
geometric mean of the post hoc parameter values from the respective population geometric mean 
estimate at the top 10th%ile and the bottom 10th%ile of the covariate distribution or across covariate 
categories was up to 30.6%, 24.1%, 15.6%, 13.4%, 11.6%, and 0.243% for body weight, ALB, CRCL, 
sex, LDH, and ECOG on CLss, respectively, and up to 23.4% and 15.6% for body weight and sex on 
V1, respectively (Figure 5).

Additional covariates evaluated (age, BMI, baseline BIL, AST, ALT, tumour size, NLR, smoking history, 
and disease stage) were not significantly correlated with inter-individual variability of CL or V1. Race 
was found to significantly correlate with inter-individual variability on CL (Table 5). However, this may 
be due to a limited number of subjects in the non-White race group in the CASPIAN study 
(n=36/2/220/1 for Asian/Black/White/Other races).  
Table 5: Impact of race on PK parameters of durvalumab 
In specific populations of interest (Asian, Japanese, subjects enrolled in different regions, and subjects 
with mild or moderate renal impairment), the geometric mean of individual post hoc parameters (CLss 
or V1) were within ±30% of those of the overall population. 
Simulation of fixed dose regimen 
For fixed dose evaluation, simulations were performed using the post hoc PK parameters to predict 
durvalumab exposure at steady state. Steady state was defined as the last (i.e. 4th) dosing cycle of 
the durvalumab + EP combination treatment phase in the CASPIAN study. AUCss, Cmin,ss and 
Cmax,ss were predicted across body weight quartiles at the fixed dose regimen of 1500 mg Q3W IV in 
order to quantify the impact of body weight on exposure.  
The geometric mean values of the simulated AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss following 1500 mg Q3W 
durvalumab IV infusion in the validation subjects were 9162 μg*day/mL, 690 μg/mL, and 219 μg/mL, 
respectively. Compared with the overall geometric mean values, the geometric mean of the simulated 
durvalumab exposures in the lowest quartile of body weight were 17.9%, 17.3%, and 19.6% higher, 
and in the highest quartile of body weight were 17.3%, 15.8%, and 20.1% lower for AUCss, Cmax,ss, 
and Cmin,ss, respectively (Table 6).

Clinical studies  
Key PK results from the CASPIAN study and the supportive studies are presented in Table 2 in section 
2.3.1 Introduction. CASPIAN is the pivotal study and will be the only study summarised here. 
CASPIAN is a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multicentre, global study to determine the efficacy 
and safety of durvalumab ± tremelimumab in combination with etoposide and platinum-based 
chemotherapy (EP) versus EP alone as first-line treatment in patients with extensive-stage small cell 
lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Patients were randomized at 1:1:1 to receive durvalumab + tremelimumab + 
EP, durvalumab + EP or EP alone. In the durvalumab + EP arm (Arm 2), patients received 1500 mg 
durvalumab via IV infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses during the chemotherapy combination 
phase, followed by 1500 mg durvalumab monotherapy every 4 weeks (Q4W) via IV infusion until 
progression of disease. Patients in the EP treatment group (Arm 3) received EP for up to 6 cycles. 
Durvalumab PK samples were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1 post-infusion, Cycle 2 Day 1 (predose), and 
Cycle 5 Day 1 (predose). Samples for determination of etoposide, carboplatin, and cisplatin in serum 
or plasma were obtained on Day 1 of Cycle 1.   
Immunogenicity assessments (ADA sampling) were performed for Cycle 1 on Day 1 (predose), Cycle 5 
on Day 1 (predose), and at 3-month follow-up. 
The study randomized 537 patients with SCLC to receive durvalumab + EP (268 patients) or EP 
chemotherapy alone (269 patients).  The randomization was stratified based on planned platinum-
based therapy in Cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin). 
As of the 11 March 2019 DCO, the interim analysis for CASPIAN only included data in the EP and 
durvalumab + EP treatment groups; therefore, only durvalumab PK data from durvalumab + EP 
treatment group and EP PK data from EP and durvalumab + EP treatment groups are presented.  
Pharmacokinetics of Durvalumab 
Durvalumab PK data were available for a total of 263 patients in the durvalumab + EP treatment group 
of CASPIAN. No formal noncompartmental analysis was conducted due to the sparse PK sampling 
scheme. Following administration of durvalumab 1500 mg Q3W in combination with EP, the geometric 
mean (n, %CV) maximum serum concentration (Cmax; end of infusion) of durvalumab at Week 0 
(Cmax,w0) was 503 (n=227, 30.5%) µg/mL  Durvalumab trough serum concentrations (Ctrough) at 
Week 3 (Ctrough,w3) and Week 12 (Ctrough,w12) were 110 (n=236, 64.4%) and 241 (n=199, 
49.7%) µg/mL, respectively.  Durvalumab PK concentrations were within the expected exposure range 
following 1500 mg Q3W in combination with EP. 
Pharmacokinetics of etoposide, carboplatin, and cisplatin 
The PK data for EP were available in a total of 27 patients: 13 patients in the EP treatment group and 
14 patients in the durvalumab + EP treatment group.  Overall, PK profiles of etoposide, carboplatin, 
and cisplatin were similar between EP and durvalumab + EP treatment groups, suggesting that 
durvalumab does not have an impact on the PK of EP when administered as a combination therapy.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Rationale for dose selection 
The approved durvalumab dose regimen in urothelial carcinoma and unresectable, Stage III NSCLC is 
10 mg/kg Q2W.  This regimen is aligned with the dose rationale based on nonclinical and clinical data 
that demonstrate a favorable benefit:risk profile in the respective patient populations. 
The fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W for an average body weight of 75 kg) 
was predicted to result in similar AUC and only modest difference in median peak and trough levels at 
steady state compared to 10 mg/kg Q2W based on PopPK simulations with the initial model (Figure 6).  
Figure 6: Simulated PK profiles of durvalumab following 10mg/kg Q2W dosing and its fixed-dose 
equivalent of 1500 mg Q4W 
The initial PopPK model, without time varying CL and developed on data from patients with solid 
tumors, identified 10 mg/kg IV Q2W as the dose of choice to maintain exposure levels above 53.3 
μg/mL, with > 95% of patients expected to reach almost complete saturation of PD-L1 (99% target 
suppression) in Study 1108. Simulations with this model indicated that a 20 mg/kg Q4W posology and 
a fixed 1500 mg Q4W dose would result in comparable exposures (Figure 7). Therefore, the fixed dose 
of 1500 mg Q4W was selected as the dose regimen being investigated in multiple ongoing Phase 3 
studies of durvalumab across cancer types.

The geometric mean of end of infusion concentration levels following the first dose and trough 
concentration levels at Week 12 were 149% and 75% higher, respectively, when compared to those at 
10 mg/kg Q2W based on pooled PK data across supportive studies (Table 7). 
Table 7: Summary of serum durvalumab concentrations (PK-evaluable population) 
Based on data from a previous durvalumab monotherapy trial (Study 1108), the baseline sPD-L1 levels 
were shown to be similar across UC, NSCLC, SCLC, and other cancer types (Figure 8). Although data 
on sPD-L1 suppression was not available in CASPIAN, post-baseline sPD-L1 data were available from 
21 SCLC patients in Study 1108. All of these patients achieved complete sPD-L1 suppression following 
10 mg/kg Q2W durvalumab treatment (Figure 9)

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The relationship between predicted durvalumab PK exposure and the key efficacy/safety endpoints was 
evaluated based on data in the durvalumab + EP and EP groups from CASPIAN. The exposure-efficacy 
analysis was based on the full analysis population and the exposure-safety analysis was based on the 
safety analysis population. Patients (n=3) in the durvalumab + EP treatment group who did not 
receive treatment were excluded from the analysis. The total numbers of patients included in 
exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety analysis were 534 (EP/durvalumab + EP: 269/265), and 531 
(EP/durvalumab + EP: 266/265), respectively.

The PopPK model-predicted AUCss was used as the primary exposure endpoint in the exposure-
response (E-R) analysis. E-R relationships were also explored for Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and the trough 
concentration after the first dose, Cmin1.  
Table 9: Baseline characteristics and exposure metrics of the ERE analysis population 
E-R relationship for efficacy 
The E-R relationships for time-to-event variable of OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier 
estimates. Confounding effects of baseline prognostic factors (ECOG, ALB, LDH, NLR, baseline tumour 
size, smoking history and disease stage) on the E-R relationship of OS was investigated by means of a 
Cox proportional-hazards model developed for durvalumab + EP treated group (N=265). The final 
model included LDH and NLR as the only significant factors (p<0.05) for the OS hazard.  
Table 10: Summary of model parameters from the final OS model 
Safety endpoints were evaluated as binary outcomes (yes/no). Boxplots of exposures stratified by AE 
outcomes were generated. The probability of AE events was calculated and plotted across exposure 
quantiles in durvalumab + EP treated patients.

The effects of body weight on safety and efficacy endpoints were also evaluated. For safety endpoints, 
the probability of AE events was calculated by body weight quantiles in durvalumab + EP treated 
patients. For efficacy endpoints, Kaplan-Meier plots of OS and PFS stratified by body weight quantiles 
were generated. E-R analysis was performed using R 3.5.1. 
Results: 
The plots of Kaplan-Meier OS curve stratified by quartiles of model-predicted AUCss, Cmax,ss, 
Cmin,ss, and Cmin1 for durvalumab + EP treated group (N=265) suggested that a slightly longer OS 
was observed in the fourth quartile of durvalumab PK exposure compared to the lower three quartiles, 
while all four exposure quartiles showed similar or longer median OS compared to the EP control arm 
(Figure 10; left panel). There was no apparent relationship between PFS and any of the durvalumab PK 
exposure metrics in the durvalumab + EP treated patients (Figure 10; right panel). 
Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier OS and PFS curves stratified by AUCss quartiles 
The final model included LDH and NLR as the only significant factors (p<0.05). Higher LDH and NLR 
were associated with shorter survival in both EP and durvalumab + EP groups, suggesting they are 
prognostic factors for OS (Figure 11 and Figure 12). Patients in the lowest AUCss or Cmin1 quartile had 
the highest median LDH and NLR values among all four exposure quartiles (Figure 13). Neither AUCss 
nor Cmin1 was significant when added on top of the final model.

E-R relationship for safety 
The distribution of durvalumab exposure were similar between patients who had the AE and those who 
didn’t for Grade 3 and above treatment related AE and Grade 3 and above AESI. However, the median 
values of exposure appeared to be lower in patients with AE leading to treatment discontinuation 
among durvalumab + EP treated subjects (N=265) in the CASPIAN study (Figure 14).

Figure 14: Probability of selected AEs by quartiles of AUCss (durvalumab + EP group) 
There appeared to be an inverse relationship between exposure and AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation, which could be due to small number of AE in this category. 
Body weight impact on efficacy and safety 
To assess the impact of body weight on efficacy and safety endpoints following the fixed dosing 
regimen of durvalumab in the CASPIAN study, the Kaplan-Meier curves of OS and PFS, and probability 
of selected AEs were stratified by body weight for patients in the durvalumab + EP treated group. The 
results suggested that there was no clear trend between body weight and OS, PFS (Figure 15) or any 
of the safety endpoints evaluated (Table 7).

There appeared to be a numerically higher rate of AE leading to treatment discontinuation in the

The results showed that there was no clinically meaningful relationship between increased durvalumab 
exposure and efficacy or safety risk in the durvalumab + EP treated patients in CASPIAN.  Additionally, 
there was no apparent relationship between body weight and efficacy or safety risk in these patients. 
Immunogenicity 
The ADA-evaluable population was defined as patients who have a non-missing baseline ADA and at 
least 1 non-missing post-baseline results.  ADA results were pooled across 9 supportive studies (Study 
1108, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, ARCTIC, MYSTIC, Japan Study 02, HAWK, CONDOR, and EAGLE) including 
subjects treated with dosing regimens of durvalumab at 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W (pan-
tumor monotherapy pool), and compared with those in CASPIAN. 
Across studies, the ADA prevalence ranged from 3.9% (5 of 127 patients) to 18.2% (4 of 22 patients), 
with an ADA incidence range of 0% (0 of 201 patients) to 9.1% (2 of 22 patients).  The occurrence of 
nAb-positive subjects was <1% across the studies, with only 1 exception (ARCTIC, Sub-study B; 2.6%

[2 of 76 patients]).  In the placebo-controlled PACIFIC study, immunogenicity results were similar 
between the placebo and active treatment groups.

In the CASPIAN study, ADA to durvalumab could be detected as early as Week 12.  A comparison of 
the kinetics of ADA responses in patients treated with durvalumab 1500 mg Q3W in combination with 
EP versus durvalumab alone could not be done due to the small number of ADA-positive patients at 
each post-baseline visit (n≤3 at all visits) in the pools. None of the ADA-positive patients in CASPIAN 
tested positive at post-baseline timepoints. Therefore, the impact of ADA on PK was not evaluated. 
The impact of ADA on the PK of durvalumab has been evaluated in the previous PopPK modelling 
based on data from Study 1108, ATLANTIC, and PACIFIC. In the previous PopPK analysis, ADA was 
identified as a significant covariate and the PK-covariate relationship assessment showed that patients 
who were ADA positive had lower exposure levels of durvalumab with a reduction of less than 30% of 
PK exposure (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) compared to a typical patient.

samples versus others 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Only sparse PK data from the D+EP arm were included in the interim report of the CASPIAN study. The 
dosing  regimen  for  durvalumab  has  been  changed  from  a  weight-based  posology  in  the  approved 
indication (unresectable stage III NSCLC) to a fixed dose posology in ES-SCLC. Additionally, the regimen 
is switched from Q3W during the combination phase (4 initial cycles) to Q4W in the maintenance phase 
(as of cycle 5), until disease progression. PK sampling was sparse in the induction phase (C1D1 post-
infusion, C2D1 predose and C5D1 predose) and no PK samples were collected during the maintenance 
phase of treatment.  
ADA sampling was performed on C1D1 predose, C5D1 predose and at 3-months follow-up in CASPIAN. 
The ADA prevalence in CASPIAN interim analysis and across earlier studies was low. The data indicate 
that immunogenicity have no clinically relevant impact on PK of durvalumab. 
The initial 2-compartment Pop PK model with dual linear and nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) elimination, 
was amended to include a time-varying clearance function. The amended PopPK model could not fit the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 32/115 
 
 
 
 
 
validation data from CASPIAN (D+EP arm) but underpredicted the sparse concentration data collected 
in ES-SCLC patients. The model was refitted with the CASPIAN data set only and the simulation-based 
diagnostics indicated a better fit. The reasons behind the difference in PK are unclear. The PK bridge 
from mg/kg to a fixed dose is based on 3 PK timepoints taken within the first 12 weeks of treatment. 
The  CASPIAN  PK  data  set  does  not  contain  durvalumab  monotherapy  data  and  the  PK  population  is 
different. Further model validation showed the PK data was informing the model adequately.  
The rationale for dose selection in arm 2 (D+EP) was based on simulations with the initial PopPK model. 
The fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W was predicted to result in similar AUC at steady state as the approved 
10 mg/kg Q2W durvalumab dose regimen.  
A serum exposure maintained above 53.3 μg/mL was identified to result in >95% of patients reaching 
99% target suppression in patients with solid tumours. Comparing PD-L1 data across cancer types in 
Study 1108, showed complete sPD-L1 suppression. The 1108 study included data from 21 SCLC patients 
presumably with worse disease status than patients enrolled in CASPIAN (treatment naïve). Therefore 
patients are expected to have sPD-L1 suppression throughout the treatment period of CASPIAN. 
The CASPIAN study results indicated that durvalumab 1500 mg Q3W in combination with EP for 4 cycles 
followed by durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W monotherapy is an appropriate dose for patients with ES-SCLC. 
These results of the E-R relationship for safety show no evidence of higher durvalumab exposure leading 
to increased rates of these AEs. Therefore, no clinically relevant E-R relationship was observed between 
durvalumab PK exposure and the safety endpoints of interest among durvalumab + EP treated subjects 
in the CASPIAN study. 
Considering the significant effect from weight upon CL and V1, the conversion from weight-based to flat 
dose was further justified by additional simulations at body weight extremes in both genders. The shift 
from  Q3W  to  Q4W  after  induction  might  result  in  even  lower  Cmin  values.  “Worst  case”  simulations 
suggested  that  95%  patients  would  still  maintain  target  exposure  throughout  the  treatment  period, 
independent of body weight. Patients with a body weight of 30 kg or less must receive weight-based 
dosing, equivalent to IMFINZI 20 mg/kg in combination with chemotherapy every 3 weeks (21 days) for 
4 cycles, followed by 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks as monotherapy until weight increases to greater than 30 
kg. 
PK drug-drug interaction between durvalumab and chemotherapy was assessed in the CASPIAN study 
and showed concomitant treatment with durvalumab did not impact the PK of etoposide, carboplatin or 
cisplatin. Additionally, based on population PK analysis,  concomitant chemotherapy treatment did not 
meaningfully impact the PK of durvalumab (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The previous amended Pop PK model underpredicted the PK data set from CASPIAN and the model was 
refitted to describe the PK of durvalumab in ES-SCLC patients. The rationales for the fixed dosing 
schedule and posology change from Q3W (induction) to Q4W (maintenance) were supported by 
additional simulations and considered acceptable. Further subgroup analyses of body weight extremes 
did not imply dose adjustment for these patients with the exception of patients with a body weight of 
30 kg or less who must receive weight-based dosing.

2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No additional dose-response study was performed. In the CASPIAN study, a fixed dose of 1500 mg 
durvalumab and 75 mg tremelimumab were used (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).

Treatments 
Patients were to receive durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with standard of 
care etoposide platinum chemotherapy (D+T+EP, arm 1 or D+EP, arm 2) or chemotherapy alone (EP 
alone, arm 3). 
The platinum agent in the EP treatment could be either carboplatin or cisplatin, and was based on the 
Investigator’s choice. 
Duration of treatment: In the experimental arms (arms 1 and 2) the study allowed up to 4 cycles of EP 
(Q3W), which is consistent with that observed in other studies combining platinum-based 
chemotherapy with investigational agents, particularly immunotherapies, to minimize the toxicity 
burden to patients (Horn et al 2018). In the control group, at the Investigator’s discretion, up to 6 
cycles of EP (Q3W) were allowed. 
After the 4 cycles of D+T+EP (arm 1) or D+EP (arm 2), durvalumab +/- tremelimumab (respectively) 
could be continued Q4W until confirmed progressive disease (PD), although treatment through 
progression was permitted if the patient was deriving benefit.

Figure 19: Dosing scheme 
Dosing scheme and route of administration: All medications were administered intravenously (IV).  
•  Durvalumab was administered at 1500 mg (flat dose) Q3W for 4 cycles in the induction phase and 
then at 1500 mg Q4W in the maintenance phase in both experimental arms (D+T+EP and D+EP). 
• 
Tremelimumab was administered at 75 mg (flat dose) Q3W for 4 cycles in the induction phase and 
then an additional dose of 75 mg was given in week 16 in arm 1 (D+T+EP). 
• 
EP: Etoposide was administered at 80-100 mg/m2 with either carboplatin (area under the curve 5-
6) or cisplatin (75-80 mg/m2) Q3W for 4 cycles in arms 1 and 2; and for up to 6 cycles in the 
control arm (arm 3). 
Dose modifications and interruptions: Dose reductions were not permitted for durvalumab and 
tremelimumab. In case of G2 AEs, durvalumab or tremelimumab were held until resolution to G≤1. In 
case of G≥3 AEs, durvalumab or tremelimumab were permanently discontinued.  
EP-related toxicity management, dose adjustment, including dose delays and reductions were to be 
performed as indicated in the local prescribing information for the relevant agent. In the event of 
unfavourable tolerability, patients could switch between cisplatin and carboplatin therapy at any point 
on study (assuming eligibility for the switched therapy is met). 
Crossover: Crossover was not permitted as part of this study.  
Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI): In the EP alone active comparator arm, patients could receive 
PCI if clinically indicated at the Investigators’ discretion.  Since the risks of combining PCI with 
immunotherapies were unknown at the time of the study initiation, PCI was not permitted in the 2 
immunotherapy arms. 
Thoracic radiotherapy: Any history of radiotherapy to the chest prior to systemic therapy or planned 
consolidation chest radiation therapy was an exclusion criterion.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any 
cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last 
recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive.  
Secondary endpoints: 
Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 using Investigator assessments was defined as the 
time from the date of randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any 
cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized 
therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression.  
In the absence of significant clinical deterioration, the investigational site was advised to continue the 
patient on their randomized durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP or durvalumab + EP treatment until 
progression was confirmed. If progression was not confirmed, the patient was to continue their 
Assessment report

Page 40/115 
 
 
 
 
 
randomized durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP or durvalumab + EP treatment and on-treatment 
assessments. Treatment through PD in the EP arm was at the investigator’s discretion; however, a 
follow up scan was required for all patients in the EP arm, even if a subsequent treatment was started. 
Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 using Investigator assessments was defined as the 
number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR.  
Proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 and 12 months (APF6 and APF12) was 
defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed using site Investigator 
assessments) at 6 and 12 months, respectively.  
Proportion of patients alive at 18 months (OS18) was defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS 
at 18 months. 
Patient reported outcome (PRO) variables 
All PRO variables were to be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer 30-item core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) with the Lung Cancer Module, a 
13-item self-administered questionnaire from the EORTC for lung cancer (EORTC QLQ-LC13) and the 
EuroQoL 5-dimension, 5-level health state utility index (EQ-5D-5L) Q8W during the treatment period 
and Q12W until confirmed objective disease progression by RECIST v1.1. All questionnaires were 
scored according to published scoring guidelines or the developer’s guidelines, depending on 
availability. 
Selected exploratory endpoints: 
Time from randomization to second progression (PFS2) was defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or 
death. The date of second progression was to be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF and defined 
according to local standard clinical practice and may involve any of the following: objective radiological 
imaging, symptomatic progression, or death. 
Time to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST) was defined as defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy after 
discontinuation of randomized treatment, or death.  
Biomarkers: Tissue samples were to be obtained from all screened patients where available. Based on 
availability of tissue, additional exploratory biomarkers could be evaluated. The results could be pooled 
with biomarker data from other durvalumab and tremelimumab studies to evaluate biological 
responses across indications and to compare results in monotherapy versus combination settings. 
•  Tumour markers: This study mandated the collection of archival/diagnostic tumour tissue, 
where available, which was to be analysed for various markers by immunohistochemistry. A 
primary goal was to measure PD-L1, tumour mutational burden (TMB), somatic 
mutations/genomic alterations and Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (DLL3) expression to 
support exploratory objectives of investigating the following: 
1. The relationship between a patient’s PD-L1 expression and spatial distribution within the 
tumour microenvironment and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab and EP. 
2. The relationship between a patient’s tumour mutational burden and/or presence of somatic 
mutations/genomic alterations and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab and EP. 
3. The impact, if any, of the level of DLL3 expression on efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, 
tremelimumab and EP (once a validated assay becomes available).

Sample size 
The study planned to randomize approximately 795 eligible patients 1:1:1 to D+T+EP (Arm 1), D+EP 
(Arm 2), or EP (Arm 3). Once global enrolment achieved 795 randomised patients, recruitment 
continued in China only. 
If the average true OS HR is 0.69, the study will have 89% power to demonstrate a statistically 
significant difference at the final analysis with a 2-sided 0.93% significance level (for an overall alpha 
of 1%) for the comparison of D+T+EP versus EP (Arm 1 vs 3), and 96% power to demonstrate a 
statistically significant difference at a 2-sided 3.57% significance level (for an overall alpha of 4%) for 
the comparison of D+EP versus EP (Arm 2 vs 3); this translates to a 4.8-month benefit in median OS 
over EP (15.7 months vs 10.9 months). The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically 
significant is an average HR of 0.78 for D+T+EP versus EP and 0.82 for D+EP versus EP.  
If the average true PFS HR is 0.71, the study will have 90% power to demonstrate a statistically 
significant difference at the 5% level (using a 2-sided test) for the PFS comparisons when 
approximately 360 PFS events have been observed in the two treatment arms to be compared. 
There were to be 2 data cut-off timepoints in the study. The interim analysis of OS was to occur when 
approximately 318 OS events had occurred (60% maturity) in the D+T+EP and EP treatment arms and 
approximately 318 OS events had occurred (60% maturity) in the D+EP and EP treatment arms. 
The data cut-off for the primary analysis of OS was to occur when approximately 425 OS events 
have occurred across the durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP and EP treatment arms 
(80% maturity) and approximately 425 OS events have occurred across the durvalumab + EP and EP 
treatment arms (80% maturity). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio in a stratified manner according to the planned platinum-
based therapy for Cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin) to receive treatment with D+T+EP (Arm 1), D+EP 
(Arm 2), or EP (Arm 3). Blocked randomization was generated, and all centers used the same list to 
minimize any imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment arm. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; however, the AstraZeneca study team were blinded to aggregate 
treatment information. During the programming and preparation of statistical outputs, data were 
dummy blinded. 
Statistical methods 
CASPIAN was designed to test the hypothesis that durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in 
combination with standard of care etoposide platinum chemotherapy (D+T+EP, arm 1 or D+EP, arm 2) 
as 1L treatment in ES-SCLC can achieve significant clinical benefit over chemotherapy alone (EP alone, 
arm 3).

Analysis sets: 
Full analysis set (Intention to treat - ITT): The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients 
randomized prior to the end of global recruitment. The full analysis set was used for demographics, 
patient characteristics and efficacy analyses (including PROs). Treatment groups were compared on 
the basis of randomized study treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients who 
were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment were to be included in the 
analysis in the treatment group to which they were randomized. 
Safety analysis set: The safety analysis set consisted of all patients recruited prior to the end of 
global recruitment who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Safety data will be summarized 
using the safety analysis set, according to the treatment received, that is, erroneously treated patients 
(e.g. those randomized to treatment A but actually given treatment B) will be summarized according to 
the treatment they actually received. 
Type I error control: 
In order to strongly control the type I error at 5% 2-sided, a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with 
gatekeeping strategy was to be used across the 2 primary endpoints of OS (Arm 1 vs. 3), OS (Arm 2 
vs. 3) and the key secondary endpoint of PFS (Arm 1 vs. 3) and PFS (Arm 2 vs. 3). If the higher-level 
hypothesis in the MTP was rejected for superiority, the following hypothesis would then be tested as 
shown in Figure 20. 
The overall 5% type 1 error was to be initially split between the 2 primary endpoints: an alpha level of 
4% will be allocated to the analysis of OS (Arm 2 vs. 3), and an alpha level of 1% will be allocated to 
the analysis of OS (Arm 1 vs. 3). If the OS (Arm 2 vs. 3) analysis is significant, then 4% alpha will be 
recycled to the OS (Arm 1 vs. 3) endpoint; If the OS (Arm 1 vs. 3) analysis is significant, then 1% 
alpha will be recycled to the OS (Arm 2 vs. 3) endpoint; If both OS primary analyses are significant, 
then 5% alpha will be recycled to the PFS (Arm 2 vs. 3) endpoint. If PFS (Arm 2 vs. 3) is significant, 
then the 5% alpha will be recycled to PFS (Arm 1 vs. 3). 
This testing procedure stops when the entire test mass is allocated to non-rejected hypotheses. 
Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, including recycling, will strongly control 
type I error at 5% (2-sided), among all key hypotheses.  
For the OS endpoint, there is 1 IA planned, and the alpha level will be controlled at the interim and 
primary analysis timepoints by using the Lan-DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien 
Fleming approach. The O’Brien Fleming boundaries for the OS interim and final analyses will be 
adjusted depending on the alpha used for the OS endpoint. In addition, durvalumab + tremelimumab 
+ EP will be compared with durvalumab + EP for OS and PFS. This comparison is not included in the 
MTP.

Efficacy analyses: 
OS was to be analysed using a stratified log-rank test adjusting for planned platinum therapy in cycle 
1 (carboplatin or cisplatin). Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was to be 
censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. 
The effect of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP versus EP treatment as well as durvalumab + EP 
versus EP treatment was to be estimated by the HR together with its corresponding ([1-adjusted 
alpha] × 100%) CI and p-value for the ITT population. The HR and CI could be estimated from the Cox 
proportional hazards model. Kaplan-Meier plots of OS was to be presented by treatment arm.  
A secondary analysis of OS was to be performed to compare D+T+EP versus D+EP. These analyses 
were to be performed using the same methodology as for the primary endpoints described above.   
The assumption of proportionality was to be assessed. 
A sensitivity analysis for OS was to examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias, which is 
achieved by a Kaplan-Meier plot of time to censoring, where the censoring indicator of OS is reversed. 
PFS: The analysis was to be performed using a stratified log-rank test adjusting for planned platinum 
therapy (carboplatin or cisplatin). The effects of D+EP versus EP treatment, and of D+T+EP versus EP 
treatment, were to be estimated by the HR together with corresponding 95% CIs and p-values. 
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis were to be censored at the time of 
the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. However, if the patient 
progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visits, the patient was to be censored at the time of the 
latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have 
baseline data, he or she was to be censored at Day 1 unless the patient dies within 2 visits of baseline. 
A secondary analysis of PFS was to be performed to compare D+T+EP versus D+EP. This analysis was 
to be performed using the same methodology as described above, but was not to be included in the 
multiple testing strategy. 
The assumption of proportionality was to be assessed in the same way as for OS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 45/115 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, patients who take subsequent therapy prior to progression or 
death were to be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent therapy. 
ORR was to be compared between D+T+EP vs EP using logistic regression models adjusting for the 
same stratification factor as the primary endpoint. The results of the analysis was to be presented in 
terms of an odds ratio together with its associated profile likelihood 95% CI and p-value. The 
denominator is a subset of the ITT population who has measurable disease at Baseline. Data obtained 
up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, were to be 
included in the assessment of ORR. Patients who go off treatment without progression, receive a 
subsequent therapy, and then respond were not to be included as responders in the ORR. 
The results of the analysis was to be presented in terms of an odds ratio together with its associated 
profile likelihood CI and p-value (based on twice the change in log-likelihood resulting from the 
addition of a treatment factor to the model).  
APF6 and APF12 were to be summarized (using the Kaplan-Meier curve) and presented by treatment 
arm along with confidence intervals using the log-log transformation.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 704 patients were enrolled into the D + EP and EP groups; of these patients, 537 patients 
were randomized at 209 study centres across 23 countries in North and Latin America, Europe, and 
Asia Pacific  
Of the 537 randomized patients, 268 were randomized to the D + EP group and 269 to the EP group.  
From the D+EP arm, one patient did not receive treatment because of unknown reason. This patient 
was verbally reported to be too sick after randomization to receive study medication. 
A total of 222 (83.8%) patients in the D + EP group and 190 (71.4%) patients in the EP group 
completed EP treatment (1 patient for EP completion in the D + EP group is missing due the entry not 
being recorded on the eCRF in error).

Medical history: 
The most frequent (ie, ≥15% of patients in any treatment group) current medical history events by 
system organ class (SOC) in the D + EP and EP groups were: Cardiac disorders (32.5% and 24.5%, 
respectively), Gastrointestinal disorders (32.1% and 32.3%, respectively), General disorders and 
administration site conditions (21.6% and 19.3%, respectively), Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
(38.1% and 36.1%, respectively), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (25.7% and 28.6%, 
respectively), Nervous system disorders (15.3% and 10.8%, respectively), Psychiatric disorders 
(18.7% and 19.7%, respectively), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (54.1% and 52.8%, 
respectively), Vascular disorders (54.1% and 46.8%, respectively).  
The most frequent (ie, ≥15% of patients in any treatment group) current medical history events by 
preferred term (PT) in the D + EP and EP groups were: type 2 diabetes mellitus (16.4% and 15.6%, 
respectively), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (22.8% and 23.0%, respectively), cough (25.0% 
and 21.9%, respectively), dyspnoea (19.0% and 14.9%, respectively), hypertension (45.1% and 
44.2%, respectively).

than 4 weeks after the initial CR/PR evaluation was conducted. Results in the table below reflect the 
DCO 11 March 2019. The data from the DCO 27 January 2020 are reflected in Table 29.

ORR is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least one visit response of CR or PR.  Patients who do 
not have measurable disease at baseline are excluded from the analysis.  Patients who went off treatment 
without progression, received a subsequent anticancer therapy, and then responded are not included as 
responders. 
95% confidence interval using mid-p method. 
The comparisons (vs EP) were performed using a separate logistic regression model, adjusting for planned 
platinum therapy in Cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin), with 95% CI calculated by profile likelihood. 
P-value, derived from logistic regression model, is based on twice the change in log-likelihood resulting 
from the addition of a treatment factor to the model. 
An odds ratio >1 favours D + EP. 
Response is determined by the RECIST-based assessment of the Investigator.

Early censoring (>10 weeks before data cut-off) was observed for 2/268 (0.7%) patients for D + EP 
compared to 8/269 (3.0%) for EP. The majority of these cases (9/10) were due to withdrawal of 
consent.  
The effect of adjusting for additional covariates was investigated, and the resulting adjusted estimate 
of HR was similar to the unadjusted estimate, see Table below: 
Table 40: Overall survival, effect of covariates on primary and secondary analyses (Full analysis set) 
To further explore robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis using the Restrictive Mean Survival 
Time (RMST) approach –which may be used regardless the presence or not of proportional hazards– 
was done.

aPrespecified protocol analysis of ORR did not require confirmation of response 
(unconfirmed response). Post-hoc analysis with confirmation of response has more 
clinical importance, so it was prioritised. 
bIDMC concluded that interim analysis of OS met prespecified O’Brien Fleming 
boundary for statistical significance between Arms 2 and 3, so those arms were 
unblinded, while Arm 1 remains blinded. 
cp-value, derived from logistic regression model, is based on twice the change in log-

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
CASPIAN was a phase III, open-label, randomised, three-arm trial designed to determine the efficacy 
and safety of durvalumab + tremelimumab + EP (D+T+EP) or durvalumab + EP (D+EP) vs. EP alone 
as first-line treatment in patients with ES-SCLC. 
The MAH has performed the first interim analysis for the D+EP group compared with the EP group, 
which occurred at a data cut-off of 11 March 2019. The interim analysis of OS performed by an 
independent committee showed statistical significance for the D+EP vs. EP comparison, which allowed 
for unblinding those arms to the sponsor and submitting efficacy and safety data to support the 
proposed new indication: durvalumab in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin 
for the first-line treatment of adults with ES-SCLC. The trial was to continue for analysis of D+T+EP at 
the final analysis (this arm remained blinded). 
The original design of the trial had been discussed with the CHMP, although an important number of 
changes were implemented before and during recruitment. Allowing cisplatin as part of chemotherapy 
in any of the arms is considered a notable advantage. This was in fact physician’s choice (carboplatin 
or cisplatin) and the only stratification factor prior to randomisation. It is noted that other factors such 
as ECOG PS or presence of brain metastases could have also been used as stratification factors. 
Treatment with up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy was permitted in the control EP arm, whereas only 4 
were allowed in the experimental D+EP arm. This is a matter of controversy: although most guidelines 
recommend 4-6 cycles of EP for the 1L treatment of ES-SCLC, evidence of efficacy benefit from 6 vs. 4 
cycles is minimal and longer exposure might only lead to accumulated chemotherapy toxicity, thus 
probably disfavouring safety performance of the control arm.  
Study design did not allow to discern the benefit from durvalumab in the induction phase (combined 
with chemotherapy) from that in the maintenance phase (by itself). However, some clinical evidence 
(numerical improvement in ORR) of the early beneficial effect from D+EP during induction, as well as 
efficacy in exploratory endpoints (PFS2) support the maintenance advantage. 
A crucial change was implemented in the primary endpoint in V4 of the protocol: from OS and PFS to 
OS only, which in turn led to downgrading PFS assessment from BICR to INV. To demonstrate that 
integrity of the study had not been compromised, the MAH presented the timelines that relate external 
evidence and amendments along the protocol, along with the percentage of OS events at each of the 
referred milestones.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 78/115 
 
 
 
 
 
As for the change in V5 (allocating more alpha for the comparison of D+EP vs. EP than for D+T+EP vs. 
EP), it came from internal sources: results from the MYSTIC study showed worse performance of the 
tremelimumab+durvalumab arm (vs. chemotherapy) than durvalumab by itself (vs. chemotherapy). 
The MAH has further explained that the D+T+EP arm did not meet its primary endpoint, and presented 
the results disclosed at ASCO 2020, although no discussion of the contribution of tremelimumab to the 
D+EP regimen was provided. 
Overall, statistical methods applied in the trial are endorsed.  
A total of 971 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 805 patients were finally randomised to 
each treatment arm in a 1:1:1 ratio. 75% of patients had been planned for carboplatin and 25% for 
cisplatin.  Important protocol deviations occurred in a small proportion of patients and are balanced in 
the two reported arms. The proportion of patients with brain metastases (10.2%) is lower than that in 
clinical practice (15-20%, Hochstenbag et al, 2016; Lekic et al, 2011), but this is likely due to allowing 
only patients with asymptomatic or treated metastases for inclusion.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the interim OS analysis, after a median follow-up of 10.6 months at data cut-off (11-MAR-2019), 
336 death events (62.6%) had occurred in arms 2 (D+EP) and 3 (EP) of the trial, satisfying the 
predefined O’Brien-Fleming boundary for declaring statistical significance between those arms (p-value 
<0.0178). The D+EP arm showed a statistical OS improvement compared to EP alone [mOS 13.0 
versus 10.3 months, HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.591, 0.909), p=0.0047]. Importantly, OS results from the 
control arm are comparable to data from most published 1L studies of platinum + etoposide in ES-
SCLC, including the control arm (carboplatin + etoposide + placebo) from study IMpower133 (Horn et 
al, 2018).  
Data from the final OS analysis (data cut-off 27-JAN-2020, 82% of events) are overall consistent with 
those from the interim analysis. However, in both interim and final OS analyses, the K-M curves depict 
violation of the proportional hazards model, i.e. the essential assumption of the stratified Cox model. A 
sensitivity analysis using the RMST approach (area under the KM curve, pseudo-value and Royston-
Pharma), albeit lacking the 95% Cis for the RMST ratio, supports robustness of the results.  
Hierarchical testing also required a statistically significant OS improvement from D+T+EP vs. EP (arm 
1 vs. 3) before proceeding to PFS. Since this did not happen, formal PFS testing was not performed. 
Mature data (86% of PFS events - DCO 11-MAR-2019) permitted a descriptive analysis of investigator-
assessed PFS, which seems to sustain the benefit from D+EP over EP (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.645, 0.936; 
nominal p=0.0078). Overall, the survival advantage from D+EP vs. EP seems to be reflected in the 
descriptive analysis of the key secondary endpoint – PFS.  
Sensitivity analyses on both OS and PFS support the clinical advantage from D+EP over EP, as do 
other secondary (ORR, DoR) and exploratory endpoints (PFS2, TFST). The forest plot on OS shows the 
benefit from D+EP is maintained across the prespecified subgroups based on demographics, 
geographical region, carboplatin or cisplatin use and disease characteristics. 
An exploratory analysis on PD-L1 results from available samples shows scarce IHC expression in TCs 
and ICs of ES-SCLC. The forest plots that depict the potential relationship of these results with OS 
events suggests that the benefit of D+EP vs. EP is maintained across the different subgroups of PD-L1 
expression, but such limited data prevent a firm conclusion on the predictive value of this biomarker in 
the ES-SCLC setting.

Time to deterioration results suggest that delay of patient-reported symptoms was more pronounced in 
the experimental arm. However, the open-label nature of the study and reduced compliance in the 
questionnaires challenges definitive conclusions in PRO data. 
Overall, efficacy data from the CASPIAN trial are in line with results observed in the IMpower133 
study, which was conducted with atezolizumab + chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy in a similar 
population setting, in spite of a few differences in study design. 
The complete final analysis of all three arms along with a discussion in the final CSR of CASPIAN, will 
be submitted by the end of 2020 (recommendation) 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The interim and final analyses of CASPIAN show a statistically significant improvement in OS for 
durvalumab + EP vs. EP in the first line setting of ES-SCLC. This benefit is supported by an informal 
analysis on mature data of the key secondary endpoint, PFS. The rest of secondary endpoints are also 
consistent with the primary endpoint. The role of PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for 
checkpoint immunotherapy in SCLC remains uncertain. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The total postmarketing exposure of durvalumab since launch to 30 April 2019 is estimated to be 
approximately 10163 patient-years (IMFINZI Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report [PBRER], 25 June 
2019). No new safety concern was identified based on the postmarketing safety reports.  
The CASPIAN study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab (D), or 
durvalumab and tremelimumab (D+T), in combination with EP for the first-line treatment of patients 
with ES-SCLC.  
The pivotal safety dataset comprises 265 patients in the D+EP group and 266 patients in the EP alone 
group. Data from all cycles of treatment were combined in the presentation of safety data. AEs (both 
in terms of MedDRA preferred terms and CTCAE grade) were listed individually by patient. The number 
of patients experiencing each AE was summarized by treatment group and CTCAE grade. Other safety 
data were assessed in terms of physical examination, clinical chemistry, haematology, vital signs, and 
ECGs.  
D pan tumour pool: A supportive assessment of the safety and tolerability of durvalumab monotherapy 
(without chemotherapy) was provided in a 9-study durvalumab pan-tumour pool (D pan tumour 
pool; N=3006). This population consists of patients who have received at least 1 dose of durvalumab 
monotherapy given at a dose of either 10 mg/kg Q2W IV or 20 mg/kg Q4W IV for any line of therapy 
(across tumour types).  
Each of the 9 studies included contributed with a cohort of at least 50 patients:

Definitions, adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs): 
AESIs: In the durvalumab clinical program, AESIs are AEs that include, but are not limited to, events 
with a potential inflammatory or immune mediated mechanism as a result of the mechanism of action 
of durvalumab that may require more frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapies include standard endocrine 
supplementation, as well as treatment of symptoms resulting from endocrine disorders (e.g. therapies 
for hyperthyroidism include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, methimazole, propylthiouracil, 
and sodium perchlorate). 
The categories for AESIs include the following: pneumonitis, hepatic events, diarrhoea/colitis, intestinal 
perforations, hypothyroid events, hyperthyroid events, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, 
type I diabetes mellitus, renal events, dermatitis/rash, myocarditis, myositis, infusion/hypersensitivity 
reactions, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, pancreatic events, other rare/miscellaneous 
events. 
imAEs: In the durvalumab clinical program, a suspected imAE is an AESI that required the use of 
systemic steroids (regardless of dose) or other immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy for 
specific endocrine events. A confirmed imAE is a suspected imAE that, after medical review, is deemed 
consistent with an immune mediated mechanism of action, and where there is no clear alternate 
aetiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, will be used to support 
characterization of an imAE. 
Steps to manually adjudicate the imAEs: The process for adjudicating imAEs starting from the 
study level AE reporting dataset through to confirmed imAE includes the steps depicted in Figure 33.

Figure 33: The process for adjudicating imAEs 
• 
From all AEs reported in a study, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were defined. This 
definition varied slightly between studies and was dependent upon the AE reporting period for the 
study. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The suspected imAEs were identified as AESI treated with systemic steroids, other 
immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy, except Pneumonitis AESI for which all are 
suspected imAE. Endocrine therapies included standard endocrine supplementation, as well as 
treatment of symptoms resulting from endocrine disorders (for example, therapies for 
hyperthyroidism include beta blockers [e.g., propranolol], calcium channel blockers [eg, 
verapamil, diltiazem], methimazole, propylthiouracil, and sodium perchlorate). 
All suspected imAEs underwent medical review.  
Confirmed imAEs were those suspected imAEs that after medical review did not have a clear 
alternate aetiology and were consistent with immune-mediated mechanism of action.

Patient exposure 
Table 45: Duration of exposure – durvalumab (safety analysis set) 
In the D pan-tumour pool (N=3006), mean total exposure duration in weeks was 25.6 (SD 24.3); 
median was 16.0 weeks (Min 0, Max 152) and total treatment-years was 1474.2.’

Table 46: Duration of exposure – chemotherapy (safety analysis set) 
Out of a total of 531 patients treated, 17 patients who initially received cisplatin were switched to 
carboplatin therapy, and no patients initially treated with carboplatin switched to cisplatin. Of the 17 
patients whose treatment was switched, 8 were in the D + EP group and 9 were in the EP alone group. 
Dose modifications: 
Dose interruptions: In the D + EP group, a total of 3 patients required a durvalumab dose interruption 
(all 3 were due to an AE). A total of 2 patients required an etoposide dose interruption (both due to an 
AE), no patients required a carboplatin dose interruption, and 1 patient required a cisplatin dose 
interruption (due to an AE). In the EP group, 9 patients required an etoposide dose interruption (7 due 
to an AE and 2 due to other reasons), 3 patients required a carboplatin dose interruption (all due to 
AEs), and no patients required a cisplatin dose interruption. 
Dose delays: In the D + EP group, 149 (56.2%) patients had dose delays to durvalumab, the majority 
of whom had only 1 delay (78 [29.4%]); the most common reason for a dose delay was AEs (109 
[41.1%]). A total of 113 (42.6%) patients had dose delays to etoposide, the majority of whom had 1 
delay (72 [27.2%]); the most common reason was due to an AE (84 [31.7%]). A total of 89 (42.8%) 
carboplatin-treated patients had dose delays to carboplatin, the majority of whom had 1 delay (54 
[26.0%]); the most common reason was due to an AE (70 [33.7%]). A total of 23 (35.4%) cisplatin-
treated patients had dose delays to cisplatin, the majority of whom had 1 delay (16 [24.6%]); the

most common reason was due to an AE (14 [21.5%]). In the EP group, 144 (54.1%) patients had dose 
delays to etoposide, the majority of whom had 1 delay (76 [28.6%]); the most common reason was 
due to an AE (105 [39.5%]). A total of 118 (56.7%) carboplatin-treated patients had dose delays to 
carboplatin, the majority of whom had 1 delay (61 [29.3%]); the most common reason was due to an 
AE (88 [42.3%]). A total of 29 (43.3%) cisplatin-treated patients had dose delays to cisplatin, the 
majority of whom had 1 delay (19 [28.4%]); the most common reason was due to an AE (20 
[29.9%]). 
Dose reductions: In the D + EP group, a total of 30 (11.3%) patients required an etoposide dose 
reduction, the majority of whom had only 1 reduction (26 [9.8%]); the most common reason due to 
an AE (27 [10.2%]). A total of 22 (10.6%) patients required a carboplatin dose reduction, the majority 
of whom had 1 reduction (20 [9.6%]); the most common reason due to an AE (21 [10.1%]). A total of 
5 (7.7%) patients required a cisplatin dose reduction, the majority of whom had 1 reduction (4 
[6.2%]); the most common reason due to an AE (5 [7.7%]). In the EP group, 42 (15.8%) patients 
required an etoposide dose reduction, the majority of whom had only 1 reduction (39 [14.7%]); the 
most common reason due to AEs (38 [14.3%]). A total of 22 (10.6%) patients required a carboplatin 
dose reduction, all of whom had 1 reduction; the most common reason due to an AE (19 [9.1%]). A 
total of 12 (17.9%) patients required a cisplatin dose reduction, the majority of whom had 1 reduction 
(11 [16.4%]); the most common reason due to an AE (12 [17.9%]). 
Dose intensity: The median relative dose intensity of D was 100% in the D + EP group. The median 
relative dose intensity for EP was not calculated due to the permissive ranges for these medications.

Adverse drug reactions 
As part of this group of variations, the applicant has updated the Durvalumab Pan-Tumor pool with the 
safety and tolerability information from an additional 1117 patients to include a total of 3006 patients. 
This population consists of all patients from the Monotherapy Pool studies who have received at least 1 
dose of durvalumab monotherapy given at a dose of either 10mg/kg Q2W IV or 20mg/kg Q4W IV for 
any line of therapy (across tumour types).

Table 53: Monotherapy Pool 
Based on biological plausibility consistent with the mechanism of action of durvalumab, temporal 
association and re-challenge responses, known risks associated with the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drug class, 
and context of background rates in target populations, the ADRs with durvalumab monotherapy have 
been determined. 
The safety of IMFINZI given in combination with chemotherapy is based on data in 265 patients with 
SCLC. IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 1500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with 
chemotherapy followed by monotherapy every 4 weeks. 
A comparative analysis between durvalumab (monotherapy and/or in combination with tremelimumab) 
treatment plus EP and EP in CASPIAN was performed using a Bayesian framework to identify 
AEs/laboratory events with an increased frequency in these treatment groups compared with EP, 
defined as AEs/laboratory events that have a 95% posterior probability that the risk ratio is greater 
than 1. Those events not already on the known ADR list were medically reviewed further for alternative 
causes (medical history, concomitant medications, comorbidities or other risk factors), biological 
plausibility, rechallenge response in order to determine whether an AE is an additional ADR.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody, therefore, no formal PK drug-drug-interaction studies have been 
conducted. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between durvalumab and EP was assessed in 
CASPIAN and no clinically meaningful PK drug-drug interaction was identified.

Post marketing experience 
At the time of data cut-off (DCO) for the most recent Development Safety Update Report (12 July 
2019), an estimated 8817 patients have received durvalumab in AstraZeneca (the Sponsor) or 
MedImmune sponsored interventional studies in multiple tumour types, stages of disease, and lines of 
therapy. Of these, 4067 patients received durvalumab monotherapy, 2423 patients received 
durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab, and 2327 patients received durvalumab in 
combination with an investigational and or an approved product. An estimated 8343 patients have 
been randomized to the various treatment/comparator arms in sponsor-blinded studies. In addition, 
2482 patients have participated in the durvalumab Early Access Programme (EAP; Study 
D4194C00002 for patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC whose disease has not 
progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy). One hundred twenty-one patients have 
been enrolled in the durvalumab urothelial carcinoma (UC) EAP (Named Patient Supply) in Australia; 
this access program closed on 15 January 2019. The total post-marketing exposure of durvalumab 
since launch to 30 April 2019 is estimated to be approximately 10163 patient-years (IMFINZI Periodic 
Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report [PBRER], 25 June 2019). No new safety concern was identified based 
on the post-marketing safety reports. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The known safety profile of durvalumab as monotherapy was based on the PACIFIC study, which 
recruited patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC after chemoradiation. In that target 
population, the most frequent ADRs associated to this immune checkpoint inhibitor were cough, upper

EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 107/115 
 
 
 
 
respiratory tract infections, rash, diarrhoea, pneumonia, pyrexia, pneumonitis, pruritus, 
hypothyroidism and abdominal pain. Other less common immune-mediated AEs have been further 
characterised with supportive safety data from a pool of 3006 patients treated with durvalumab 
monotherapy across 9 studies from diverse cancers and stages.  This pooled safety dataset allows for 
characterization of the safety profile of durvalumab in a larger patient population that includes patients 
across various tumour types and stages of disease, thus providing a reference to more fully evaluate 
the durvalumab safety profile. 
Nevertheless, the safety outcome of durvalumab in the CASPIAN study might differ for many reasons. 
Treatment-naïve advanced SCLC is a completely different clinical setting with shorter survival, which 
also implies much lesser exposure: 7 cycles as median vs. 20 in the PACIFIC study. Moreover, 
durvalumab was combined with chemotherapy and administered at a fixed dosing regimen which 
significantly differs from the one already authorized, i.e., 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. 
The safety profile of durvalumab in combination with EP (D+EP) in the proposed indication is based on 
data from 531 patients included in the CASPIAN trial who received at least one dose of the study 
treatment (265 patients in the D+EP arm and 266 in the EP alone arm).  
The overview of AEs suggests the SOC comparator (etoposide + cis/carboplatin) is slightly more toxic, 
particularly regarding haematological AEs, but this may be due to the protocol allowing for longer 
chemotherapy exposure (6 vs. 4 cycles) in this arm. A post hoc analysis comparing AEs reported 
during the first four cycles of treatment did not reveal major differences between treatment arms apart 
from a higher incidence of anaemia and neutropenia (Grade 3-4 and SAEs) in the EP arm. According to 
the MAH the cause of these differences may be multifactorial (advanced disease condition, existing co-
morbidities and unknown causes).  
High-grade (G3/4), SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in similar 
proportions in both arms, although their pattern differed slightly: AEs of haematological nature 
predominated in the EP arm, whereas imAEs and thoracic disorders prevailed in the D+EP arm.  
A similar number of patients died from AEs in both reported arms from CASPIAN. Most of those G5 AEs 
were associated to haematological toxicity, infections and/or respiratory/thoracic disorders, but deaths 
from pneumonia were more frequent in the D+EP arm. Only 1 patient in the D+EP arm experimented 
death related to an imAE of hepatotoxicity. The deaths from two patients from the EP arm had been 
classified as due to ‘pneumonitis’, but a revision of the narratives did not find solid evidence for this 
diagnosis. 
Accounting for the mechanism of action of durvalumab and the open label nature of the trial, the 
proportion of patients with imAEs was significantly higher in the D+EP arm than in the EP arm. 
Nevertheless, most of the difference is attributable to low grade manageable thyroid disorders and 
rash, with very few patients from the D+EP arm experimenting more severe events. Furthermore, as 
compared to the early days of immunotherapy, most oncologists nowadays have experience dealing 
with imAEs, allowing for early detection and manageability. 
The incidence and severity of pneumonitis associated to durvalumab in CASPIAN was inferior to that 
seen in the PACIFIC study. A potential explanation for this difference is the fact that all the patients in 
the latter trial had received high-dose thoracic irradiation –a known risk factor for pneumonitis– as 
part of their previous treatment. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed with radiographic 
imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, and managed as recommended 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The safety profile of durvalumab did not vary significantly across subgroups of gender, race, 
geographic region, smoking status and ECOG. Nevertheless, patients aged ≥ 75 years presented a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 108/115 
 
 
 
 
higher incidence of SAEs (around 50% in both arms and in the D pan-tumour pool), G5 AEs and AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation even though data are limited in this patient population. 
Overall, incidence of AEs, SAEs, deaths and discontinuations due to AEs in the D+EP group was 
comparable with the monotherapy pool (D pan-tumour pool). In contrast, G3/4 AEs were more 
frequent in the D+EP group, driven by the higher incidence of haematological AEs related to 
chemotherapy. 
Since the risks of combining prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) with immunotherapies were unknown 
at the time of the study initiation, PCI was not permitted in the 2 immunotherapy arms. Therefore, the 
safety of concurrent PCI with durvalumab in patients with ES-SCLC is unknown. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In safety terms, adding durvalumab to SOC etoposide + carbo/cisplatin in the target population results 
in predictable toxicity corresponding to the known safety profile of the individual components. Higher 
proportion and severity of AEs typical from chemotherapy in the control arm are attributed to 
considerably longer exposure. 
Overall, no new safety concerns arise from the results of CASPIAN, although it is recommended that 
practicing Oncologists be particularly aware of higher incidence of imAEs associated to durvalumab, in 
most cases manageable with adequate treatment.

2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
All safety concerns have been removed as no additional risk minimization measures or 
pharmacovigilance activities were considered necessary to manage the safety profile of durvalumab. 
This is endorsed. The RMP has been revised throughout to reflect this were appropriate. All issues 
considered resolved. 
The revised RMP sufficiently reflect the known risk profile of durvalumab. All safety concerns have been 
removed and sections II – VI are now considered acceptable. 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2 is acceptable. The CHMP endorsed this 
advice without changes.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this group of variation including a new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 
5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Overall, the wording in the PL is similar to the text previously tested during the MAA. The changes are 
considered not significant enough to warrant an additional user consultation for this new indication. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication for durvalumab (IMFINZI) in combination with etoposide 
and either carboplatin or cisplatin in the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell 
lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 
SCLC is a highly aggressive, lethal and widely metastatic lung cancer that comprises 15% of global 
lung cancer incidence (Gazdar et al, Nat Rev 2017). Nearly all patients with SCLC have a history of 
tobacco use and about 70% of them present with extensive-stage (ES) at diagnosis, which limits 
median overall survival to 10-12 months. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Platinum-based chemotherapy, often combined with etoposide, has been the mainstay of ES-SCLC 
management since the 1980s (Levy et al, J Natl Compr Can Netw 2013). Although ES-SCLC initially 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 110/115 
 
 
 
 
responds to cytotoxic therapy, it almost always rapidly relapses with resistance to further therapies. 
The median time to progression is 4 to 6 months (Slotman et al 2015). In the past few years, 
however, nonclinical and clinical studies have shown promising benefit from adding an immune 
checkpoint inhibitor to the standard chemotherapy backbone. The IMpower133 study was a placebo-
controlled trial that evaluated the benefit of adding atezolizumab to carboplatin + etoposide, with 
improved survival in the experimental arm [mOS 12.3 vs 10.3 months, HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.54, 0.91), 
p=0.007)] (Horn et al, NEJM 2018). This is the only anti-PD-L1 inhibitor approved in combination with 
chemotherapy in the 1L setting of ES-SCLC to date. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study D419QC00001 (“CASPIAN”) is an ongoing phase III, open-label, randomised, three-arm, 
multicentre trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of durvalumab, with or without 
tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin (D+T+EP, arm 1; 
D+EP, arm 2) with that of etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin by themselves (EP alone, arm 
3) as first-line treatment in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 
Randomisation was 1:1:1 with planned platinum-based therapy: carboplatin or cisplatin as 
stratification factor. The two experimental arms received chemotherapy for 4 cycles and then remained 
in maintenance with durvalumab, whereas up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy and no maintenance 
treatment were permitted in the control arm.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is OS compared between the D+EP and EP alone groups, and separately, 
between the D+T+EP and EP groups. The overall 5% Type 1 error was split between the two 
comparisons. The key secondary efficacy endpoint is INV-assessed PFS according to RECIST 1.1 
criteria.  
The MAH has submitted efficacy and safety results from 537 patients allocated to arms 2 (n=268) and 
3 (n=269) of the CASPIAN study to support the extension of the licensed indication of durvalumab to 
the first line treatment of ES-SCLC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  At data cut-off there was 63% maturity of OS data from arms 2 and 3. The study met its primary 
endpoint with a statistically significant improvement in OS from D+EP over EP alone [median OS 
13.0 vs. 10.3 months, HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.59, 0.91), p=0.0047] at the pre-planned interim 
analysis. The K-M curves remain separated after month 6. Data from final OS analysis (82% of 
events) are overall consistent with those from the interim analysis (63% events). 
• 
Investigator-assessed PFS with mature data (86% of events) supports the OS benefit: HR 0.78 
(95% CI 0.65, 0.94), nominal p=0.0078. Though mPFS is comparable between arms (5.1 months 
for D+EP and 5.4 months for EP alone), K-M curves do not separate until after the 6th month. PFS2 
shows a clear difference favouring the D+EP arm. 
•  The efficacy benefit from D+EP vs. EP is seen across ancillary analyses of OS and PFS (sensitivity, 
subgroup), other secondary endpoints (ORR, DoR) and exploratory endpoints (PFS2, TFST).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  An exploratory analysis on available PD-L1 results (52% of the ITT) shows scarce IHC expression in 
TCs and ICs. Although the forest plots that depict the potential relationship of these results with OS 
events suggests that the benefit of D+EP vs. EP is maintained across the different subgroups of PD-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/210563/2020  
Page 111/115 
 
 
 
 
L1 expression, the role of PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for checkpoint 
immunotherapy in SCLC remains uncertain. 
•  PFS could not be formally tested at the interim analysis within the MTP as both the D+EP and 
D+T+EP groups were required to achieve statistical significance for OS prior to stepping down to 
PFS. Thus, the PFS analysis for D+EP vs EP can only be considered as descriptive. 
•  Treatment effect from durvalumab during induction and maintenance phases cannot be 
differentiated. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  The proportion of patients with any AEs, G3/4, G5 AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of 
treatment were comparable between the D+EP and EP arms, but their pattern differed slightly: 
haematological toxicity predominated in the EP arm, whereas imAEs and thoracic disorders 
prevailed in the D+EP arm. 
•  A post hoc analysis comparing AEs reported during the first four cycles of treatment did not reveal 
major differences between treatment arms apart from a higher incidence of anaemia and 
neutropenia (Grade 3-4 and SAEs) in the EP arm. 
•  Numerically higher rates of SAEs were reported in the EP arm (36%) as compared to the D+EP arm 
(31%). Most hospital admissions in both arms were related to AEs of haematological nature and 
infections. 
•  The proportion of patients with imAEs was significantly higher in the D+EP arm (20%) as compared 
to the EP (3.4%) arm, with most of this difference being attributable to low grade thyroid disorders 
and rash. The most common imAEs in the experimental arm were hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, 
pneumonitis, hepatic events and dermatitis/rash. 
•  Clinical laboratory profiles of patients in both arms mainly reflected haematological toxicity from the 
chemotherapy backbone and thyroid autoimmunity in the D+EP arm. Shifts in liver biochemistry 
parameters were numerically higher in the D+EP arm. 
•  Patients ≥75 years presented higher incidence of SAEs, G5 AEs and AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation in both arms of the study. Of note, the incidence of SAEs in this age subgroup was 
around 50% in both arms, as was in the pan-tumour pool (286 out of 3006 patients ≥ 75 years). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although adjudication of causality from the investigator was respected, it seems that more patients 
than those reported presented SAEs and G5 AEs attributable to pneumonia in the D+EP arm.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Considering the descriptive nature of the analysis of the key secondary endpoint –INV-PFS–, updated 
OS data seem to confirm the long-term advantage from adding durvalumab to SOC EP. 
Efficacy results from the CASPIAN trial are in line with what is expected from adding a PD-L1 
checkpoint inhibitor to standard chemotherapy in a highly aggressive cancer such as SCLC. Albeit 
short-term benefit seems limited, overall survival is improved in the ITT population. Regarding 
duration of treatment, it is debatable whether allowing up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy contributed to 
improve efficacy outcomes in the control arm, while it undeniably added considerable haematological 
toxicity.  
As with most trials of immune-targeted monoclonal antibodies, there seems to be a group of patients 
who benefit most. The clinical behaviour of the disease might serve as a guide, but certain biological 
indicators could aid to identify those subjects. An exploratory ad hoc analysis on PD-L1 IHC results 
from available samples in the trial does not show a clear relationship to efficacy in terms of OS.  
The open-label nature of the trial increases the likelihood of investigator bias. The protocol and primary 
analysis plan were modified during the conduct of the study, but the MAH has provided some 
reassurance regarding the timelines of the amendments and the external nature of the data that 
prompted them.   
Most of the safety issues in the study were related to the backbone combination of platinum + 
etoposide, but the potential emergence of imAEs related to durvalumab requires constant vigilance and 
experience from the clinician.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A modest, though clinically relevant survival improvement was seen in the durvalumab + EP arm vs. 
the control arm in the final analysis of the CASPIAN trial. This advantage is supported across other 
endpoints, sensitivity analyses and population subgroups.

Valid pharmacological arguments that endorse posology changes have been provided. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Although the role of PD-L1 IHC expression as a predictive biomarker for checkpoint immunotherapy in 
ES-SCLC remains uncertain, the overall outcome of the CASPIAN trial, consistent with results from the 
IMpower133 study conducted with atezolizumab, highlights the importance of PD-L1 checkpoint 
inhibition as an addition to chemotherapy with etoposide and a platinum agent in the first line setting 
of ES-SCLC. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imfinzi (durvalumab) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes:

Extension of Indication to include the use of IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either 
carboplatin or cisplatin for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer 
(ES-SCLC). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated. 
The proposed indication is supported by study D419QC00001 (CASPIAN), an ongoing Phase III 
randomised, multicentre, open-label, comparative study designed to determine the efficacy and safety 
of durvalumab, or durvalumab and tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide and platinum-based 
chemotherapy (EP) for the first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC.  
In addition, the MAH proposes to revise sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to update the safety 
information based on the Durvalumab Pan-Tumour Pool, a safety dataset comprising of 9 clinical 
studies building on the existing safety database and summarising the safety information for 
durvalumab monotherapy characterised across tumour types in the durvalumab clinical program to 
date. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 2 has also been agreed. The MAH also 
took the opportunity of this group of variations to update the PI in line with QRD template v10.1. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

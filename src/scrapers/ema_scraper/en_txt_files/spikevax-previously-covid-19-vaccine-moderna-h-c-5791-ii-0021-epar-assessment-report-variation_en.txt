consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2,  4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated.  The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006,  the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0481/2020  on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0481/2020  was not  yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000  and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the MAH  did not submit  a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to  the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH requested scientific advice at the CHMP  on the  clinical proposals for extending the indication 
under the conditional marketing authorisation, down to 12 years of age and the clinical development plan 
for variant vaccines of Spikevax. The scientific advice was ongoing at  the time when this application was

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, WHO was informed about  a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause 
in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020 the pathogen causing this  atypical pneumonia was identified as a 
novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were 
published. Since then  the virus has spread globally and on 30  January 2020  the World Health 
Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health  Emergency of International Concern and on 11 
March 2020  a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the  outbreak.  
According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung 
injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with  severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication and dosing administration for Spikevax are: 
•  Proposed indication: Active immunisation  to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 
virus, in individuals ≥12 years of age (extension including 12-17  year olds) 
•  Dosing administration: single 0.5-mL  intramuscular (IM) dose followed by a second 0.5-mL 
dose 28  days later 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
As of week 23  in 2021,  there have been over 33 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 
EU/EEA with  approximately 734,000  deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19). The majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild  disease with full  recovery.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 7/88 
 
 
 
 
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory 
disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are considered risk 
factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ transplantation and 
chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-existing medical conditions have also been suggested as a risk factor for 
severe disease and ICU admission in  children and adolescents. 
Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to  COVID-19. Individuals with  high 
risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to  occupation include healthcare and frontline  workers.  
There are currently several vaccines approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adults and elderly, but  only 
one for the use in adolescents 12-17  years old. COVID-19 in adolescents is mostly a mild disease 
although severe cases also occur rarely. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with  a single linear RNA segment. It 
is enveloped and the virions are 50–200  nanometres in  diameter. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 
has four structural  proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) 
proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to  increase pathogenicity and 
transmissibility in other viruses. The spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with 
the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit  catalyses attachment to the  angiotensin converting enzyme 
2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the  S2 subunit  facilitates fusion with  the 
cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen  for vaccine development because it 
was shown that  antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune response that 
prevents infection in  animals. 
It is believed that  SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it  has close genetic similarity to  bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020  and the  virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Human-to-human  transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020.  Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. After infection 
individuals remain infectious for up to two weeks and can spread the virus even if they do not show 
symptoms.  
The median incubation  period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two  to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with  dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with  few or no symptoms, 
resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 8/88 
 
 
 
 
recover within two  weeks, while those with  severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to 
recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to  death has ranged from two to 
eight weeks. Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the 
hospital are associated with  severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to  ICU.  
The gold standard method of testing  for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the  presence of viral RNA fragments. As this  test detects RNA but 
not infectious virus, its ability to  determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. The test is 
typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or sputum 
sample.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Spikevax (also referred to in  this report as COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna or mRNA-1273) is a vaccine 
approved for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is based on nucleoside-modified 
mRNA encoding for the full-length  SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with  2 proline substitutions  within 
the heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the  spike protein into a prefusion conformation. The mRNA 
is encapsulated in lipid  nanoparticles (LNP). 
Upon delivery and uptake by body cells the mRNA is translated in the cytosol and SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein is generated by the host cell machinery. The spike protein is presented and elicits an adaptive 
humoral and cellular immune response. Neutralising antibodies are directed against it and hence it is 
considered a relevant target antigen for vaccine development.  
Spikevax is administered intramuscularly in two  100 µg doses given 28 days apart. The vaccine is 
indicated for active immunisation to  prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 18 years of 
age and older. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH has applied for CHMP  scientific advice on clinical proposals for extending the indication for this 
CMA down to 12  years of age and the  clinical development plan for variant vaccines of Spikevax, which is 
currently under evaluation.  
A PIP has been agreed (PIP P/0481/2020)  and the current study is part of the PIP. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH states that  all clinical studies were performed in accordance with GCP. The current application is 
based on study P203 and the initial  adult study P301,  which was the pivotal phase 3 study included in  the 
application for initial approval.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this  application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.4.1.  Main study 
Study mRNA-1273-P203 
Study P203 is an ongoing, two-part (Part A and Part B), Phase 2/3,  randomised, observer-blind, placebo-
controlled study that evaluates the  safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax (also referred to as 
mRNA-1273  vaccine) in healthy adolescents aged ≥ 12  to < 18 years. Vaccine efficacy is inferred based 
on demonstrating non-inferiority of both  the (a) geometric mean (GM) value of serum antibody (Ab) and 
(b) the seroresponse rate from adolescent participants - with  both measures compared with  those 
obtained from young adults (≥  18 to ≤ 25 years of age) enrolled in the ongoing adult study (Study 
P301). Additionally, secondary study endpoints assessed the effect of Spikevax on COVID-19 and 
asymptomatic infection as measured by RT-PCR testing  of mucosal samples and serologic assessment of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this study, baseline SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by using virologic and 
serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on or before Day 1. 
To support the use of the  Spikevax in adolescents (aged ≥12 to <18  years), immunogenicity data from 
young adults (aged ≥18  to ≤25  years) from study P301, based on a database lock date of 04  May 2021, 
were used as a comparator group to infer vaccine efficacy to adolescents aged ≥12  to <18  years. Study 
P301 is the ongoing pivotal randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study that  supported the 
indication of Spikevax in adults  ≥ 18 years of age. In study P301, more than  30,000  participants were 
randomised and >96.7%  participants received dose 2 of mRNA-1273.

Study Eligibility Criteria (Part B): 
- 
- 
Participants must have been previously enrolled in the mRNA-1273  P203 study. 
Female participants of childbearing potential  may be enrolled in the study if the participant  has a 
negative pregnancy test  on the day of the first injection (OL-Day 1) and on the day of the second 
injection (OL-Day 29). 
The CHMP considered the inclusion  and exclusion criteria to be acceptable. There is good concordance 
with  the adult population  included in study P301 which is paramount for the  immunobridging strategy. 
Treatments 
In Part A, the blinded phase of the study, each participant  received either two doses of 0.5mL  of Spikevax 
(100  µg) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) by intramuscular injection 28 days apart (i.e. Day 1 and Day 
29). The protocol specified a window of +7 days for administration of the second dose. 
In part B the  open-label phase of the study, mRNA-1273  vaccine will be administered intramuscularly 
following the injection schedule for each group based on the product received in Part A. Participants who 
received placebo in Part A will  receive 2 doses of mRNA-1273  (100 μg)  on open-label (OL) – Day 1 and 
OL-Day 29  of Part B (see schedule below).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Safety Endpoints 
- 
- 
Solicited local and systemic ARs through 7 days after each injection 
Unsolicited AEs through 28  days after each injection 
-  MAAEs through the entire study period 
- 
- 
SAEs through  the entire study period 
AESI of MIS-C through the entire study period 
-  ≥Physical examination findings. 
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
- 
The proportion of participants with  a serum Ab level at Day 57 ≥  an Ab threshold of protection 
(Note:  If an accepted serum Ab threshold of vaccine protection against COVID-19 is available, this 
analysis will  form the basis to infer efficacy)  
- 
The primary vaccine response as measured by GM value of serum Ab level and seroresponse rate 
from study  P203 vaccine recipients at Day 57 compared with those obtained from young adult 
recipients (≥18-<25  years of age) at Day 57 in the  clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study P301). 
(Note:  If an accepted serum Ab threshold is not available, efficacy will  be inferred based on 
establishing noninferiority of adolescent (≥12 to <  18 years; this clinical study) to adult  GM values of 
serum Ab and seroresponse rate obtained in  Study P301  (GM value ≥12  to < 18 years / GM value 
≥18 to  <25 years). 
Seroresponse due to vaccination at  a subject level may be defined as a change from below the LLOQ to 
equal to or above LLOQ,  or a z-fold rise if baseline is equal to or above LLOQ. The definition of 
seroresponse may depend on assay-specific performance characteristics, and Table 2 lists  the assay-
specific definition  of seroresponse for each assay/test of interest.

Among the two pseudovirus tests,  PsVNT50 and PsVNT80, PsVNT50 is considered the most appropriate 
measure of subject response because it  falls in  the middle of the dynamic range of the dilution  response 
curve while PsVNT80 is close to  the plateau and thus  subject to restriction. 
The GM and seroresponse rate comparisons between adolescents in study P203  and young adults (≥18-
<25 years of age) in  study P301 will be compared for the  bAb and nAb measures listed in Table 2, with 
Pseudovirus nAb PsVNT50 (ID50) considered as the primary assay for the  immunobridging.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (by Roche Elecsys) counted starting 14  days after the 2nd dose of 
IP in  participants with  negative SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. 
The incidence of the first occurrence of COVID-19 starting 14 days after the  second dose of IP, where

•  One of the  following systemic or respiratory symptoms: fever (temperature >38ºC/≥100.4ºF), 
or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty  breathing, fatigue, muscle aches, or body 
aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat,  congestion or runny nose, nausea, or 
vomiting or diarrhoea, AND

participants with  2x, 3x and 4x rise of bAb relative to baseline. 
Laboratory tests 
Besides the serological assays listed in Table 2  the following assays were employed to assess SARS-CoV-2 
baseline status  and efficacy endpoints 
-  RT-PCR  
- 
anti-Nucleocapsid antibody assay by Elecsys.  
Information on assay validation and the laboratories involved in the  evaluation are available for all assays 
used.  
The CHMP noted the evidence of acceptable assay control, assay validation and sample storage provided. 
Studies on sample stability are ongoing; the respective validation reports should be provided upon 
completion (REC). The full  bioanalytical report is not available yet and should be provided upon 
completion of the study (SOB). 
The CHMP considered the selection and definition, time point  as well as the applied non-inferiority margin 
to be acceptable for the immunobridging concept and in  line with provisions as per variant RP (indent on 
naïve population)  with the  definition of seroresponse being an exception (i.e. protocol stipulating other 
than 4-fold increases above BL and/or threshold crossing in case of <LLOQ instead of using nominal value 
replacement). 
Sample size 
The overall sample size of the study was driven by safety. Approximately 3,000 participants were to  be 
randomly assigned in a 2:1  ratio to receive mRNA-1273 and placebo. With  2,000 participants  exposed to 
mRNA
1273, the study  was planned to have at  least 90%  probability to  observe at least 1 participant  with 
an AE at a true 0.25%  AE rate. 
‑
Sample size for immunogenicity subset 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021

Serum samples from all participants were to  be collected and banked, a subset of participants was to be 
selected, and their samples were to be processed for immunogenicity testing (the  Immunogenicity 
Subset). Approximately 362 participants who receive mRNA-1273 were to be selected for the 
Immunogenicity Subset, with  a target of 289 participants in  the PP Immunogenicity Subset (adjusting for 
approximately 20% of participants who may be excluded from the PP Immunogenicity Subset, as they 
may not  have immunogenicity results due to  any reason).  
In case an acceptable Ab threshold of protection against COVID-19 was available for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, with  approximately 289 participants in the  PP Immunogenicity Subset, the 
study was considered to have > 90%  power to rule out 70%  with  a 2-sided 95%  CI for the percentage of 
mRNA-1273  participants exceeding the acceptable threshold if the true rate of participants  exceeded the 
acceptable threshold is 80%.  
If an acceptable Ab threshold of protection against COVID-19 was not available at the time  of analysis, 
for the primary immunogenicity objective, non-inferiority tests of two null hypotheses based on two 
coprimary endpoints, respectively, were to be performed: 
With  approximately 289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in study P203  and 289  participants 
in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in young adults (18-25  years of age) from study P301, there was to  be 
90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response as measured by Ab GM in adolescents 
in study P203 at  a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, compared with  that  in young adults  (18-25 years of age) from 
study P301 receiving mRNA-1273,  assuming an underlying geometric mean titers (GMR) value of 1,  a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.5,  and a point  estimate minimum  threshold of 0.8.  The standard deviation 
(SD) of the log
transformed levels was assumed to  be 1.5. 
With  approximately 289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in study P203  and 289  participants 
‑
in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in young adults (18-25  years of age) from study P301, there was to  be 
at least 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response as measured by sero-
response rate in  adolescents in study P203 at a 2 sided alpha of 0.05,  compared with that  in young adults 
(18-25  years of age) from study P301 receiving mRNA 1273,  assuming a true sero-response rate of 85% 
in young adults (18-25  years of age) from study P301,  and a true sero-response rate of 85% in 
adolescents in study P203  (i.e., true rate difference is 0 compared to young adults from study P301), a 
non-inferiority margin of 10%,  and a point  estimate minimum  threshold of -5%  in sero-response rate 
difference. 
Overall, the CHMP  endorsed the sample size considerations, both  for the overall trial size as well as for 
the immunogenicity subset. It is noted that  even less frequent AEs are observable with >  90% probability 
at least once. The claimed probability of ≥ 90%  to observe AEs which occur in 0.25% of subjects would 
even be achieved with around 1,000  participants, i.e., the study is overpowered for the claimed goal. 
Overall, the sample size is appreciated, however. The power for immunogenicity analysis was always 
estimated to be above 90% based on the assumptions provided. If a correlate of protection  (COP) was 
established the power for the expected to be > 97%.  Similarly, it seems that  in case no COP was 
established, the power for the geometric mean titers (GMR) is around 97% given the assumptions made. 
Under the made assumptions, the  power for sero-response was estimated to  be about 92%.  While both 
serologic endpoints were required, the power for this analysis was hence seemingly driving the sample 
size in the immunogenicity subset. The sample size is sufficient for the immunogenicity analysis. 
• 
Randomisation 
Random assignment of participants in a 2:1 ratio was based on a centralised interactive response 
technology, in accordance with pre-generated randomisation schedules. No strata for randomisation were 
defined in study P203.  
Immunogenicity Sampling Plan for study P203

For  the  primary analysis  of  immunogenicity,  and  charactering immunogenicity  of  the  vaccine,  a  simple, 
very pragmatic sampling  method  was to  be used  for measuring bAb  and  nAb data  from  a subset  of  trial 
participants.  The  first  550  participants  enrolled  in  Part  A  were to  be  selected  who  met  the  following  the  
criteria:  
• 
The participant is in Full  Analysis Set. 
•  Baseline SARS-CoV-2 status is not missing. 
Hence, approximately only 362  participants who received mRNA-1273 were to  be selected for the 
Immunogenicity Subset, with  a target of 289 participants in  the PP Immunogenicity Subset after 
adjusting for approximately 20% of participants not meeting inclusion criteria for PP Immunogenicity 
Subset, resulting in a set size of approximately 289 participants, which  is endorsed. 
The pragmatic sampling approach itself, however, might  lead to a biased subset if the participant 
population was to change over time, which could be reasonably assumed. Upon review of side-by-side 
tables for the  different analysis sets, which  are discussed below, there might be slight  imbalances (e.g. in 
age and race/ethnicity) between the FAS and the immunogenicity samples, which could affect the overall 
representativeness of the immunogenicity estimates for the  overall population. As subgroup analyses 
were provided as well, this  issue can however be considered minor. 
The MAH further argued that due to a very quick enrolment in less than three months no marked time 
difference between the first 550 and the overall population  existed. This argument is only partially shared 
as differences in the  willingness to participate in such a trial might occur regardless of calendar time and 
hence the  population might change. 
Immunogenicity Sampling Plan for study P301 
An immunogenicity subset of 340  young adults  from study P301 was to be randomly selected from all 
participants (18-25  years of age) receiving mRNA-1273,  with a target of 289 participants in  the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset (using  same definition as in study P203) after adjusting for approximately 15% of 
participants not  meeting inclusion  criteria for PP Immunogenicity Subset. 
The CHMP endorsed the overall randomisation to treatment arms. The selection of immunogenicity 
subsets is not considered optimal and not well documented. 
The random sampling took place prior to evaluating the  blood samples and only the blood samples of the 
randomly selected subjects were evaluated in the laboratory. Hence, no data driven choices based on 
immunogenicity data could be made for study P301,  while clinical efficacy data in  principle might  have 
been able to influence the choice. It is not assumed that  this has happened and even if so, it  is not 
expected that  this would affect the results in a meaningful way. 
The anticipated rates of participants in the  immunogenicity subset who do not  meet the PP definition  were 
substantially higher than the  observed rates. In study P203 the “dropout” rate was only ~9%  (rather 
than the  assumed 20%) and in study P301  ~10% (rather than the assumed 15%). Of note the assumed 
rates from the immunogenicity to the  immunogenicity PP set were different for study P301 and study 
P203. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
Part A of this  study was to  be observer-blind. The investigator, study staff, study participants, study site 
monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) were to be blinded to  the IP administered until  study 
end or initiation  of Part B, with the  following exceptions:  
•  Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited  number) was to be assigned to  vaccine accountability 
procedures and was to prepare and administer mRNA-1273 (or placebo) to  all participants.   
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 19/88 
 
 
 
 
•  Unblinded study site monitors, not  involved in other aspects of monitoring, were to be assigned 
as the IP accountability monitors.  
•  An unblinded statistical  and programming team was to perform the  pre-planned interim analyses 
(IA). Sponsor team members were to be pre-specified to be unblinded  to the IA results and were 
not to  communicate the results of IA to  the blinded investigators, study site staff, clinical 
monitors, or participants. This was to be detailed in the  study Data Blinding Plan. 
In Part A, the dosing assignment was to be concealed by having the unblinded pharmacy personnel 
prepare the IP in  a secure location that  is not accessible or visible to other study staff. An opaque sleeve 
over the syringe used for injection was to  maintain the blind at the  time of injection, as the doses 
containing mRNA-1273  look different to that  of placebo. Access to the randomisation code was to be 
strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
A limited number of Sponsor and CRO personnel was to be unblinded for the  interim analyses. The 
purpose of the unblinding  was to enable the group to develop regulatory submission documents and to 
address questions from regulatory agencies during the regulatory review of the submission. After 
unblinding,  this unblinded team was not to  participate in  the conduct or execution of the subsequent 
course of the study. The study Data Blinding Plan provides details of the blinding/unblinding  process and 
personnel. The study site staff, investigators, study monitors, and participants were to remain blinded 
until  the initiation  of Part B. 
Individual unblinding of participants was possible in  specific situations  (e.g. due to SAEs, medical 
emergencies, pregnancy). Unblinding  was to  be documented in a timely fashion.  
Overall, the CHMP  considered the blinding procedure to be reasonable. The laboratories who analysed the 
serum samples for immunogenicity analyses were blinded to the  time-point when the  sample was 
collected (baseline or follow up)  and that  samples from both studies were analysed at the same time. All 
lab analyses were conducted in the same labs (PsVNA was performed at Duke University, anti-S ELISA 
and MSD 3-plex at PPD Vaccine Laboratory) for all samples. It was further clarified that age was not 
“specifically provided to testing  labs”, but that  subject IDs were provided to the labs. This means that 
identification  of the study  might have been possible, while otherwise some level of blinding  at the 
laboratory can be reasonably assumed. From the reply and the  display in the SAP and study protocol, it  is 
assumed that  blood samples were drawn from all of the first ~550  subjects enrolled in Study P203 but 
only the samples from vaccinated subjects were subsequently analysed. This is important  to maintain the 
blinding of participants enrolled in the trial. Likewise, it is assumed that  blood samples from all 
participants in study P301  were collected as otherwise the sampling approach described above would not 
have been possible. Although  the timing of the unblinding  of the study team is not entirely clear, this is 
not considered to impact  the immunogenicity analysis in a meaningful way.

Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The MAH defined in total 9  analysis sets, see Table 3. The most relevant analysis sets for immunogenicity 
was to be the PP immunogenicity set (a subset of subjects selected for immunogenicity testing  [see 
Randomisation] who were observed and treated according to protocol). For efficacy, the PP efficacy set 
was planned to be used as primary analysis set, with  supplementary analyses in the FAS, mITT set, and 
mITT1 set. For safety analyses, the safety set was to be used.

Immunogenicity analyses 
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection  against COVID-19 was available based on data from 
other mRNA-1273 studies or external data, the number and percentage of participants with  Ab greater 
than or equal to the threshold at Day 57 were to be provided with a 2-sided 95% CI using the Clopper-
Pearson method. If the lower bound of the 95%  CI on the mRNA-1273  group was >  70%, the primary 
immunogenicity objective of this study was to be considered met. The percentage of participants with 
serum Ab greater than  or equal to the threshold with  95% CI were to be provided at each post-baseline 
time point.   
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection  against COVID-19 was not  established, the  non-
inferiority of primary vaccine response as measured by Ab GM and sero-response rate in adolescents

compared with  those in young adults  (18-25 years of age) receiving mRNA-1273  was to be assessed as 
co-primary immunogenicity endpoints.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was to be carried out with  Ab value at Day 57 as a dependent 
variable and group (adolescents in Study P203 and young adults  in study P301) as fixed variable. The GM 
values of the adolescents at Day 57  was to  be estimated by the geometric least square mean (GLSM) 
from the  model. The GMR (ratio of GM values) was to be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model. 
A corresponding 2-sided 95% CI was to be provided to assess the difference in immune response for the 
adolescents in Study P203 compared to the  young adults  (18-25 years of age) in  study P301 at Day 57. 
The non-inferiority of immune response to mRNA-1273  as measured by GM was considered to be 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95%  CI of the GMR was > 0.67  based on the non-inferiority 
margin of 1.5,  and the GMR point estimate was > 0.8 (minimum  threshold). 
The difference of sero-response rates between adolescents receiving mRNA-1273 in  Study P203  and 
young adults (18-25  years of age) receiving mRNA-1273 in study P301  was to  be calculated with  95% CI. 
The non-inferiority in  seroresponse rate of adolescents in study P203  compared to young adults  (18-25 
years of age) in study P301 was to be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95%  of the 
sero-response rate difference is > -10%, based on the  non-inferiority margin of 10%, and the sero-
response rate difference point  estimate > -5% (minimum threshold).   
In addition, the GM  level of specific nAb and bAb with  corresponding 95% CI was to be provided at each 
time point.  The 95%  CIs were to  be calculated based on the t-distribution  of the log transformed values 
then back transformed to the original scale. The geometric mean fold
rise (GMFR) of nAb and bAb with 
corresponding 95% CI was to be provided at each time point  with  Day 57 as the  primary time point of 
‑
interest.  
Interim analyses 
• 
• 
• 
The first interim analysis for safety and efficacy was to  be performed after at least 1,500 
participants (1,000  participants receiving mRNA-1273)  completed Day 57  (one month  after dose 
2, Part A).  
The second interim analysis for immunogenicity, safety and efficacy was to be performed after 
Day 57 immunogenicity data were available for the immunogenicity subset. This interim analysis 
was to be considered as the primary analysis of immunogenicity. 
The final analysis of all applicable endpoints is planned to be performed after all participants have 
completed all planned study procedures. Results of this analysis are planned to be presented in 
an end of study CSR, including individual listings. 
Analysis sets 
Overall, the CHMP  considered the primary analysis sets to be acceptable. The huge amount of defined 
analysis sets suggests more “sensitivity analyses” and – if these are in line – more robustness than 
actually supported by the data. E.g.  the PP efficacy set and the mITT set were almost identically defined 
and only differed in the exclusion of patients with  major protocol deviations, which might affect efficacy 
endpoints, from the former set. The mITT1 set is even closer to  the PP efficacy set by excluding subjects 
who were not  treated as randomised. Actually, this  definition is considered to be very close to a PP set.  
Immunogenicity analyses 
Overall, the CHMP  endorsed the planned immunogenicity analyses. The comparison of immunogenicity 
data with  external controls from Study s301 is considered a pragmatic and acceptable approach.  
The primary comparison in case no COP was established (the current situation)  was not  planned to be 
adjusted for any potential confounders. This is not  considered optimal for a formal proof of non-

inferiority. Comparisons of baseline characteristics between the analysis sets and studies provided some 
reassurance that the data was collected in  overall comparable populations (see below). However, it 
cannot be fully excluded that subjects differ “immunologically” between studies; see also the discussions 
on randomisation, choice of immunogenicity subsets and blinding.  In the light  of the  obtained results, this 
can however be considered negligible.  
No methodological details on the analyses of sero-response rate were provided with  the protocol and SAP. 
The definition of sero-response was only defined in the SAP version 2.  It is noted, however, that  only the 
definition of seroresponse for sero-positive patients was critical. For the majority of subjects in the sero-
negative population  of primary interest sero-response was defined as change from Ab levels below the 
LLOQ to levels equal to or above the LLOQ. Only very few subjects had measurable Ab levels at  baseline. 
Hence, this is not  considered a critical issue for this  procedure. 
It was noted that  the SAP Version 2 defined the visit windows applicable to immunogenicity analysis (as 
well as safety and efficacy) very liberal and wide. The relevant Day 57 visit window  for the primary 
immunogenicity analysis spans from Day 44 post  the first injection to Day 133,  i.e., from roughly 6 weeks 
to as much as 19  weeks with  a target of 8 weeks. Per the SAP visit schedule, however, immunogenicity 
blood samples were to be collected only at Day 1  (prior to vaccination, no tolerance window)  and Day 57 
(+7 days). The provided information is at  least unclear or even contradictory. The PP immunogenicity 
subset was defined as all subjects who  complied with  the immunogenicity testing  schedule. 
Efficacy analyses 
For vaccine efficacy analyses, SARS-CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 and 
COVID-19 per secondary case definition, were to be analysed. For these analyses VE was to be defined as 
1 – ratio of incidence rate (mRNA-1273  vs. placebo). The 95%  CI of the ratio was to be calculated using 
the exact method conditional upon the total number of cases adjusted by the total  person-time. Person-
time was to be defined as the total  time from randomisation date to the date of event, last date of study 
participation, censoring time, or efficacy data cut-off date, whichever was earlier. 
Interim analyses 
The timing and nature of interim analyses was changed from SAP version 1 to version 2. The first interim 
for efficacy and safety was newly introduced with  version 2 and replaces an interim analysis for safety, 
which was previously planned after approximately 250 participants  (16-17 years of age) have completed 
Day 57.  
At the EMA/Rapporteur meeting held on 7th May 2021,  the MAH  presented interim analyses results for 
efficacy. These were not pre-planned in SAP  version 1  and also do not match the first interim  analysis 
planned in SAP version 2. While efficacy data were anyway not  under type 1 error control this  however 
leaves some uncertainty as regards the blinding of the MAH  during the conduct of trial. Of note, SAP 
version 2 was prepared on 7th May 2021,  i.e., at the very same day as the EMA/Rapporteur meeting was 
held. During the meeting the MAH  was asked for the document which defined the presented interim 
analysis and could not refer to the  updated SAP. It is hence likely that  the SAP was finalised after the 
meeting and after the  analyses were conducted, i.e. post hoc. A request for further information on the 
conducted interim analyses did not provide further clarity. It appears that  several “descriptive analyses” 
were conducted. 
The timing and order of interim analyses 1 and 2 as defined in SAP version 2 remain somewhat unclear. 
Interim analysis 1 was to be conducted after at least 1,500  participants (over both arms) had completed 
Day 57. Interim analysis 2 was to be conducted after immunogenicity data were available for the 
immunogenicity subset, and this was planned to happen earlier, already after ~550  participants (over 
both arms) had had their  Day 57 visit. The only reason for interim analysis 2 to  happen later is potentially

Page 23/88 
 
 
 
 
the “availability” of the immunogenicity data, which is driven by the lab analyses. This unspecific timing 
of analyses for efficacy and safety theoretically leaves room for data-driven approaches.  
Importantly and the above notwithstanding,  the  efficacy analyses are only considered as supportive in the 
trial, while the  immunobridging approach serves as the main and acceptable basis for inferring efficacy.

As comparator arm for the  immunogenicity subset, 340 subjects aged ≥18  to ≤25 years were randomly 
selected from all participants in that  age group enrolled in the  mRNA-1273 group of study P301. Of the 
340 selected, 35 were excluded from the PP Immunogenicity Subset for the following reasons: baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 positive or missing (17 participants), did  not receive dose 2 per schedule (16 participants), 
or received dose 2 outside of [21,  42] days after dose 1 (2  participants). 
Conduct of the study 
Timing of the Application 
A data snapshot for this submission was triggered on 08  May 2021 based on the availability of 
immunogenicity data from Study P203, resulting  in a median study follow-up duration of 53 days after 
dose 2.  This analysis included a total  of 3,732 participants (3,726  participants randomised and received 
study treatment, with  1,240  participants randomised to placebo and 2,486  participants randomised to 
mRNA-1273). 
Changes in  primary immunogenicity endpoint(s)  and evaluation: 
- 
In case a protective threshold was established, the  response rate based on SARS-CoV-2  S 
protein (S2P)  serum Abs was initially to be compared against a response rate of ≤ 60%. This 
was changed to  a serum Ab threshold which  was to  be compared against a response rate of ≤ 
70%. 
- 
In case no protective threshold was established, the GM serum neutralising Ab level was 
replaced by GM serum Ab level and sero-response rate.  The lower bound for GMR was changed 
from 0.5  to 0.67  (equivalently the NI margin was changed from 2 to 1.5).  The definition  of sero-
response was to be defined in the SAP only based on outstanding  information about assay 
performance. The lower margin was newly defined as -10%. 
-  Comparison was initially planned against study P301 subjects ≥ 18 years and changed to  subjects 
18 to 25  years. 
- 
The immunogenicity subset (mRNA-1273 subjects only) was increased from 210 to 362  and the 
PP immunogenicity subset was increased from 178 to 289  subjects. 
-  mITT and mITT1 sets were newly defined. 
-  An additional safety interim analysis was introduced after 250 subjects in the cohort of subjects 
16-17  years of age.  
- 
The immunogenicity and safety analysis was planned earlier, already after the immunogenicity 
subset and an undefined number of subjects in  the safety set has completed Day 57  assessments. 
With  the SAP version 2 additional changes were introduced: 
- 
For Ab GM values an additional success criterion on point estimate has been added requiring the 
GMR point estimate > 0.8  (minimum threshold). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 26/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
For sero-response an additional success criterion on point estimate has been added requiring the 
sero-response rate difference point estimate > -5% (minimum  threshold). 
-  New sero-response definition (Sec. 3.1)  added. 
-  Clarification that COVID-19 cases 14 days after first dose were to  be analysed in the  mITT1 set. 
-  New secondary COVID-19 definition. 
- 
Interim analyses changed again: 
o  First  interim analysis for safety was dropped and replaced by an interim analysis for 
safety and efficacy in all age groups after 1500 participants have completed Day 57 
o  Second interim analysis dropped the specification of “a subset of all participants having 
completed Day 57” but  this might  be still  included due to  the time it takes to analyse the 
immunogenicity samples.  
The CHMP noted the numerous changes from protocol version 1  to 2 and from SAP version 1 to  2 in the 
conduct of study affecting the immunogenicity endpoints and their analysis. Most  of these changes were 
indeed considered to be conservative in nature, e.g. an increase in the lower acceptance bounds, the 
addition of a further primary endpoint “sero-response” if no COP was established, the addition  of a lower 
threshold for the  point estimates of both GMR and sero-response and the change of the population  to be 
used as comparator from all adults to adults between 18 and 25 years of age. Although  the timing  and 
type of interim  analyses was changed in a non-transparent manner twice, first with  Protocol version 2 and 
later with  the second SAP, this  is considered to have negligible consequences on the  interpretability of 
safety and immunogenicity data. 
Demographics and  baseline characteristics 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the FAS, Immunogenicity Subset, PP Immunogenicity 
Subset, mITT1 Set, and PP Efficacy Set is presented in Table 6. For parameters such as age, gender, race 
and ethnicity, the  PP Immunogenicity Subset is generally representative of the FAS as well as other 
subsets.

Immunogenicity subset 
In the PP Immunogenicity Subset including study P203  and study P301  participants, proportions of males 
and females were comparable (Table 7).  The mean and median ages were 14.4 years and 14.0  years, 
respectively, for Study P203 participants and 22.3  years and 23.0  years, respectively, for study P301 
young adults. 
In the PP immunogenicity subset of study P203 a total  of 20.3%  of the participants were from 
communities of colour (78.5%  were non-Hispanic  white) (Table 7). Of note, 51.8%  of young adults 
enrolled in study P301  were from communities of colour, which was numerically higher than in all study 
P301 mRNA-1273  participants who received at least one dose (37.1%,  FAS, PA, 25 Nov 2020).

The CHMP noted that  the immunogenicity subset and PP immunogenicity subset differ slightly from the 
FAS/mITT sets e.g. with  respect to age, and race and ethnicity group with  a higher proportion of older 
subjects and a higher proportion of white  non-Hispanics in the  immunogenicity subset. As the 
immunogenicity subsets were defined based on the first 550  enrolled subjects, this shows that  some 
changes over time might  exist in the enrolled subject population, which  could slightly affect the results in 
the immunogenicity (PP) subset in comparison to the overall population. 
The study was conducted in  the US only. This is considered acceptable and no concerns arise from lack of 
European data as there are no major intrinsic/extrinsic differences seen between regions to question 
applicability of main results to  the EU. 
The demographic characteristics of the two immunogenicity subsets of study P203 and study P301 differ 
as regards ethnicity and body mass index with  a higher proportion of white non-Hispanic  participants and 
a higher number of participants with  a BMI of <30  kg/m2 in the PP immunogenicity subset in study P203. 
No subjects with  comorbidities such as diabetes or other risk factors were randomised in the 
immunogenicity subsets of studies  P203 and P301, respectively. 
Interestingly, differences between the  safety set and the PP immunogenicity population  also occurred in 
study P301, where a random sample was to be drawn. Of interest, patients with  BMI < 30kg/m² and 
white  non-Hispanics were even slightly  enriched in the PP immunogenicity subset as compared to the 
safety set. 
Overall, this could affect immunogenicity data and hence the comparison of the two  age cohorts to an 
unknown but  most likely to a minor extent. 
Outcomes and estimation 
•  Non-inferiority of the immune response (nAb levels  and seroresponse rates)  
At the time the  immunogenicity/efficacy analyses were performed no correlate of protection has been 
established. Therefore, the primary efficacy objective to  infer efficacy of mRNA-1273 in adolescents (≥ 12 
to < 18  years of age; Study P203) was evaluated by comparing the immune response to mRNA-1273 as 
measured by GM  values/titers of serum Ab and seroresponse rates 28 days after dose 2 (Day 57) with 
those obtained from young adults (≥ 18  to ≤ 25 years of age; study P301)  and establishing non-
inferiority. 
The seroresponse criteria were 1) Number of subjects with  baseline <LLOQ  and ≥LLOQ  at D57 and 2) 
Number of subjects with  baseline ≥LLOQ  and ≥3.3-fold rise at D57. Numbers of subjects meeting the 
respective criteria are shown  in the Table 8.  The MAH  also provided 3)  the number of subjects with 
baseline <LLOQ  and ≥3.3-fold rise from baseline 0.5xLLOQ at  D57.

Descriptive results depicting PsVNT (ID50) are shown in Table 9. 
Table 9:  Summary of Pseudovirus Neutralising Antibody ID50  Titers by Age Group (PP Immunogenicity 
Set) 
The CHMP considered that  the criteria specified in the SAP 2.0  based on PsVNT (ID50) allow the following 
classification of seroresponse: (1) baseline <LLOQ >=LLOQ  or (2) baseline >=LLOQ:  3.3-fold rise). 
Numbers were provided for each outcome separately and also for the  number of subjects with “(3) 
baseline <LLOQ  and 3.3-fold-rise for PsVNT (ID50) with  imputed  baseline value = 0.5xLLOQ”  (PP 
Immunogenicity Set)”. The majority of subjects (in both  studies) could be classified into both categories 
(1) and (3) (approx. 99 % each), which rules out  the possibility that  “seroresponse” might have been 
attributed  to titers merely above the LLOQ. In addition,  an analysis employing the more commonly used 
“4-fold increase” criterion was provided for the  PP immunogenicity subset (PsVNT (ID50), PP 
Immunogenicity Set), which does not  suggest a different outcome compared to the MAH’s primary “3.3-
fold rise” criterion (based on assay-specific considerations).

Table 10  summarises the analysis of the differences in immune response at Day 57 for adolescents 
without  evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in Study P203 compared to young adults aged ≥18 to 
≤25 years in study P301  for serum nAb level (PsVNA ID50 assay) and seroresponse.  
The GMR of adolescent (Study P203) to young adult (study P301)  nAb titers at Day 57 was 1.077  (95% 
CI: 0.939, 1.236),  meeting the 1.5-fold  non-inferiority criterion (ie, lower bound of the  95% CI for GMR is 
> 0.67).  The difference in adolescent to young adult nAb seroresponse rates at Day 57 was 0.2% (95% 
CI: -1.8%, 2.4%),  meeting the 10% non-inferiority criterion (lower bound of the  95% of the 
seroresponse rate difference is >  -10%). Non-inferiority for the primary endpoints (neutralising antibody 
level and seroresponse) was demonstrated.

Neutralising antibody responses by age stratification 
Stratification according to age group ≥12 to  <16 years and ≥16 to <18  years indicates no difference in 
the GMR of the nAb response at day 57  as measured by Pseudovirus Neutralisation Assay (ID50) when 
compared to the age group of young adults in study P301.  The seroresponse rates are slightly lower in 
younger participants (≥12  to <16  Years) than in young adults.

[1] Seroresponse  due to vaccination specific to pseudovirus  neutralizing  antibody ID50 titer at a subject  level is 
defined as a change from below LLOQ to equal or above LLOQ, or at least a 3.3-fold rise if baseline is equal to or above 
LLOQ.  
[2] 95% CI is calculated using the Clopper-Pearson  method. 
[3] 95% CI is calculated using the Miettinen-Nurminen (score) confidence limits. 
As shown in Figure 1 Box Plot analyses presented for nAb responses at day 1 and day 57 reveals that 
very few participants without  evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in study P203 and in study P301 had 
neutralising antibody titers at day 1 and almost all participants  had neutralising  antibodies at  day 57.

Reverse cumulative distribution  curves 
Figure 2 displays the reverse cumulative distribution curves of neutralising antibodies titers as measured 
by Pseudovirus Neutralising Assay (ID50) of participants assessed in the PP immunogenicity subset of 
study P203 and study P301 and stratified according to age group. Overall, the distribution  of neutralising 
antibody titers as well as the  distribution of bAb titers (figures not shown) between the study population 
of studies P203 and P301 are comparable. No difference in the nAb distribution  between the two age 
strata in study P201 is observed. There is however a slightly broader distribution  of antibody titers  in 
study P301 particularly with a higher proportion of subjects having lower nAb titers.

Neutralising antibody responses by baseline status and other characteristics 
In general, comparable antibody levels and response rates were found across different subgroups except 
for some ethnicities (e.g. Hispanic).  The analyses by baseline SARS-CoV-2 status based on the 
immunogenicity subset showed that higher antibody levels were elicited in baseline seropositive subjects 
in the adolescents than in young adults and that  the GMR and seroresponse rates are in the  same range 
as for the non-inferiority analyses on the PP immunogenicity subset.

Note: The assay used for these data was the pseudovirus neutralizing antibody ID50 titer. N1=number of participants with non-
missing data at baseline and the corresponding timepoint. The Immunogenicity Subset consists of participants in the FAS who had 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status available and had baseline and at least 1 post-injection antibody assessment for the analysis endpoint. 
The Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Subset consists of all participants in the Immunogenicity Subset who meet all of the following 
criteria: received planned doses of study vaccination per schedule; complied with the timing of second dose of injection; had 
negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and a negative serology test based on bAb specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (as measured 
by Roche Elecsys 
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay) at baseline; had baseline (Day 1) and Day 57 Ab assessment for the analysis endpoint; and had no major 
protocol deviations that impact key or critical data. Antibody values reported as below the LLOQ are replaced by 0.5 x LLOQ. Values 
greater than the ULOQ are replaced by the ULOQ if actual values are not available. The log-transformed antibody levels are analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with the group variable (adolescents in P203 and young adults in P301) as fixed effect. The resulted LS 
means, difference of LS means, and 95% CI are back transformed to the original scale for presentation.

SARSCOV2S2P IgG Antibody (AU/mL) by MSD MULTIPLEX (LLOQ: 23, ULOQ: 1400000) 
The CHMP considered that  non-inferiority of antibody responses (nAb/bAb titers and seroresponse rates) 
following a two doses vaccine regimen in baseline SARS-CoV-2 negative participants was demonstrated 
regardless of the serological assay used indicating a comparable immune response in children and 
adolescents from 12 years onwards to that  of young adults. Neutralising antibody levels across various 
age groups (≥12  to <16, ≥16  to <18,  ≥18 to <25  years of age) were found to be generally of the same 
magnitude and no substantial difference in antibody distribution  was observed. The seroresponse rates 
measured by pseudo neutralisation assay across the different age strata of the ≥12  to <16, ≥16  to <18, 
and ≥18 to  <25 years old were 98.3%,  100% and 98.6%  respectively. Results from additional analyses 
applying different criteria for seroresponse (e.g. 4-fold  increase instead of 3.3-fold increase) are 
reassuring that  immune response is comparable between young adults and adolescents and all predefined 
success criteria were met regardless the definition of seroresponse. 
Subgroup analysis suggests that  the immune response in subjects with  a higher BMI (≥30  kg/m2) is 
lower in adolescents than in young adults as the non-inferiority criteria for the neutralising antibody levels 
and response rates were not met. The actual antibody levels in adolescents were higher than that  in 
young adults. However, there is an imbalance in participant  rates with  higher BMI in the two 
immunogenicity subsets with  a substantial  lower number of subjects included in the  immunogenicity

subset of study P203 (n=24,  7.1%) compared with  study P301 (n=71,  23.3%).  No subjects with 
comorbidities other than  obesity were included in the immunogenicity subsets of study P203  and study 
P301.  
A similar observation applies to the ethnicity  ‘Hispanic’ and Black or African American with lower antibody 
levels and seroresponse rates reported in adolescents. Again, a substantially lower number of subjects 
were included in the  immunogenicity subset in study P203 than in study P301 and it is not known 
whether any other cofactors impact these results.  
Additional analyses (descriptive statistics  including PsVNT50/80,  ELISA, MSD read-outs and analyses 
related to  e.g. GMFR, RCDC) are in good agreement with  the primary read-out. Considerably higher 
PsVNT (ID50) titers were induced by Spikevax in adolescents who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline 
compared to their young adult counterparts (Immunogenicity Subset; GMT  approx. 2.5-fold higher and 
median titer approximately 1.5-fold higher in younger subjects). This may, however, be an artefact 
driven by the low numbers of subjects contributing  to this  analysis (n=27  adolescents vs. n=  17 young 
adults). 
In summary, results of this  subgroup analysis should be interpreted with  caution. The subgroup analyses 
do not show a meaningful heterogeneity between considered subgroups. 
Vaccine  efficacy (Secondary endpoints)  
In addition to the  primary immunobridging analysis, VE was assessed against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 
infections (asymptomatic and with  or without  symptoms). Methods used were the same as those 
employed for adults  ≥18 years (Study P301). The secondary endpoint analysis results for vaccine efficacy 
are summarised in Table 16. All VE analyses are descriptive. 
For the descriptive analysis of VE in Study P203 employing the COVID-19 “P301 case definition” used in 
the pivotal adult efficacy study, the  observed VE against confirmed cases occurring 14  days or more after 
dose 2 was 100.0%  (95% CI: 28.9%,  NE).  There were no case in the  mRNA-1273 group and 4 cases in 
the placebo group (Table 16). These results are consistent  with  results obtained in the  pivotal efficacy 
study. 
Using the COVID-19 “CDC case definition”  with  requiring only one symptom and reflecting the symptoms 
more common in adolescence VE against COVID-19 occurring 14 days or more after dose 2 was 93.3% 
(95% CI: 47.9%,  99.9%).   
VE against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring at  least 14  days after dose 2 (PP Set for 
Efficacy) was 39.2%  (95% CI, -0.247,  0.697).

pivotal study P301 in adults.  A VE of 100.0% (95%  CI: 28.9%, NE)  was estimated. Analysis of VE based 
on the FAS population (starting  14 days after dose 1) confirmed the results with a comparable number of 
cases observed in both groups.  
Using the less stringent CDC definition amended to  reflect the clinical course in adolescents a VE of 
93.3%  (95% CI: 47.9%, 99.9%)  is reported starting  14 days post dose 2 with  1 case reported in the 
vaccine group and 7 cases observed in the  placebo group confirming the initial  VE results in adults ≥ 18 
years of age. The low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases regardless of the case definition  is not 
surprising given the low  number of subjects enrolled, the time of follow-up and the normal course of 
infection in this  age group where most SARS-CoV-2 infections are expected to cause no (asymptomatic) 
or mostly mild symptoms. As regards prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infections 14 days following the second dose lower VE was observed with 55.7%  (95% CI:16.8, 76.4)  and 
39.2%  (95% CI: -24.7, 69.7),  respectively. 
As can be expected, no severe cases occurred in the  study. The risk of severe disease increases with 
increasing age.  
The data further suggest that  the protection against asymptomatic disease may be (substantially) lower. 
This may be indicative of a shift  in disease severity on individual vaccinee level rather than complete 
infection prevention explaining part of the pronounced efficacy observed for symptomatic endpoints. It 
should be noted, however, that  sensitivity for estimating asymptomatic case prevention is likely limited 
due to operational constraints.  No firm conclusions regarding prevention of asymptomatic infection can be 
drawn for the  time being. Final study results should be submitted as soon as available. 
No information is currently available on the  virus variants causing COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-
2 infections in study P203.  As the study was solely conducted in the  USA between December 2020 and 
May 2021 it  is unclear whether the circulating  variants in the US at the  time of study conduct are 
representative of the  variants observed and currently spreading in Europe. From virus variant distribution 
data available from US CDC it  can be assumed that the main virus variants circulating at the  time of 
study conduct were the alpha, followed by the iota and gamma variants. The delta variant, which  is 
expected to become the predominant variant in Europe with  an anticipated 90%  infection rate by end of 
August, was not substantially  circulating in the USA until  early May 2021.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of Spikevax in adolescents aged ≥12-<18  years was assessed in an 
interim analysis of the study P203,  which is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled (2:1 
randomised in favour of IP), observer blind study conducted in the  US. The study is ongoing and currently 
immunogenicity and (exploratory) efficacy data are available from a median duration of follow-up of 57 
days after the second dose. The planned study duration is 14  months, 12 months after the second dose 
to collect long-term efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data. 
The choice of the comparator arm consisting  of the  immunogenicity set of young adults aged 18 to 25 
years enrolled in the pivotal study P301 is acceptable as COVID-19 vaccine efficacy was convincingly 
demonstrated in this adult  study.  
The study population comprised adolescents ≥12  to< 18 years of age including  individuals with higher 
BMI. No individuals with  comorbidities were included in the immunogenicity subset. There are no major 
intrinsic/extrinsic differences seen between regions to  question applicability of main results to the EU. 
Pregnant and breastfeeding adolescents were excluded from the studies. The selection of immunogenicity 
subsets is considered not optimal due to slight  imbalances (e.g. in age and race/ethnicity) between the 
FAS and the immunogenicity samples, which could affect the overall representativeness of the 
immunogenicity estimates for the general population. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoints were defined in the study protocol to evaluate binding  and 
neutralising antibody responses following vaccination in  a subset of study participants. These endpoints 
are appropriately chosen and relevant for immunobridging to young adults. However, the chosen criteria 
for defining seroresponse are not fully in line with  established criteria generally used for vaccines. 
Therefore, additional analyses were requested, for details see below. 
The primary analysis population was the per protocol (PP) set defined as all subjects without  major 
protocol deviations who received all planned doses of the  study treatment and who had not developed 
COVID-19 prior to the second dose.  
As regards the comparative primary immunogenicity assessments, the  co-primary endpoints are agreed 
in definition  and respective sample sourcing. It was noted during the assessment (partly based on 
interaction with  the MAH)  that  for finalisation of SAP version 2, prior availability/access to immunogenicity 
reads cannot be conclusively ruled out  based on described timelines (and unclear masking of study 
origin). This is relevant insofar, as some specifics of the  co-primary immunogenicity endpoints  were left 
open in version 1 of the SAP. Additional analyses were requested to address the robustness of results 
across (‘candidate’) immunogenicity endpoint specifications as per SAP version 1. More generally, and 
questions regarding pre-specification in  protocol/SAP aside, the specifications eventually considered for 
primary inference are supported from a regulatory perspective. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 44/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, various exploratory efficacy endpoints (largely aligned with those from the adult pivotal study 
P301) were specified to evaluate prevention of COVID-19 starting 14 days post dose 2 in individuals with 
no prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections before receiving any study treatment. Two different COVID-
19 case definitions  were employed to identify probable cases, one being identical to the case definition 
used in study P301 and the second following  the CDC case definition.  
As noteworthy additions, asymptomatic COVID-19 infection  and (related to that)  COVID-19 infection 
(combining symptomatic and asymptomatic cases) have been included as efficacy endpoints. Respectively 
reported study P203 data are the first obtained from any Spikevax study. Available interim results are, 
however, limited and do not allow firm conclusions regarding prevention of asymptomatic infection. 
Overall, the analysed/reported efficacy endpoints only warrant consideration as supportive and for 
consistency (across studies, endpoint  definitions and with  immune response) but do not per se enable 
reliably estimating  vaccine efficacy in adolescents. For that purpose, primary reference is made to 
immunogenicity data (see above).  
A protocol amendment split up study  P203 into part A (db RCT) and part B (OLE) to  enable subjects to 
seek unblinding  by choice and elect to go for IP (or other vaccine) if initially allocated to placebo upon 
EUA of COVID-19 vaccine for younger cohorts (in  the US). This will impair developing long-term 
controlled data (safety) and meaningful efficacy readout at later time points. 
Overall, the design and conduct of the study were appropriate for the intended purpose of showing 
comparable immunogenicity and safety. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical immunogenicity/ efficacy 
Immunogenicity to infer vaccine efficacy 
Inferring efficacy by immunobridging from adults  to adolescents is an accepted strategy for vaccines and 
has been applied previously. Since no serological correlate of protection  is currently established, non-
inferiority analyses based on antibody levels and response rates following vaccination are recommended. 
Antibody responses in adolescents and young adults  following vaccination with  Spikevax were assessed 
using three different serological assays to measure anti-spike binding and neutralising antibodies. As 
demonstrated in in vitro studies and in  vivo using monoclonal antibodies, neutralising antibodies against 
the spike protein play a crucial role in  the prevention of COVID-19. Hence, results of the analyses of 
neutralising antibody responses are key to establish non-inferiority and to  conclude on the acceptability of 
immunobridging.  
The immunobridging strategy to  infer vaccine efficacy was based on a non-inferiority approach employing 
ratios of geometric mean titers  (GMR) and seroresponse rates between young adults 12-17  years of age 
from study  P203 (n=340)  and adolescents 18-25 years of age from study P301 (n=296).  Evaluations 
were based on neutralising antibody (nAb) titers measured via PsVNT (ID50) at day 57 post-vaccination 
(Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Subset). The criteria specified in the SAP version 2  based on PsVNT (ID50) 
allow the following classification of seroresponse: (1) baseline <LLOQ  >=LLOQ or (2) baseline >=LLOQ: 
3.3-fold rise). To allow for a more granular analysis, the MAH provided numbers for each outcome 
separately and also provide the number of subjects with  “(3)  baseline <LLOQ and 3.3-fold-rise for PsVNT 
(ID50) with  imputed baseline value =  0.5xLLOQ” (PP Immunogenicity Set). The majority of subjects (in 
both studies) could be classified into  both categories (1) and (3) (approx. 99 % each), which rules out 
the possibility that  “seroresponse” might have been attributed  to titers  merely above the LLOQ. In 
addition, an analysis employing the more commonly used “4-fold increase” criterion was provided for the 
PP immunogenicity subset (PsVNT (ID50), PP Immunogenicity Set), which  does not suggest a different 
outcome compared to the MAH’s primary “3.3-fold  rise” criterion (based on assay-specific considerations). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 45/88 
 
 
 
 
An increase in neutralising antibodies was reported in adolescents aged 12-17 years of age 4 weeks after 
the recommended adult vaccination schedule of 2 doses given 28 days apart. In SARS-CoV-2 baseline 
negative individuals the neutralising  antibody (nAb) levels were in the same range as the  nAb levels 
observed in young adults  included in the PP immunogenicity set in  the pivotal efficacy study P301 
(1401.670  and 1301.312,  respectively). Seroresponse rates (per defined criteria as stated above) was 
detected in almost all subjects in  both age groups (12-17  years of age: 98.8% and 18-25  years of age: 
98.6%).  These results indicate that  the neutralising antibody levels (1.077;  95%CI: 0.939,  1.236) and 
the seroresponse rates (0.2; 95%CI: -1.8,  2.4) are non-inferior in adolescents compared to  young adults. 
Results of additional analyses provided upon request (see also paragraph above) are reassuring that 
immune response is comparable between young adults and adolescents and all predefined success criteria 
were met regardless the definition  of seroresponse. Analyses based on two  different binding  anti-Spike 
antibody assays confirmed these results, i.e. non-inferiority of bAb responses and response rates were 
established.  
Overall, comparable immunogenicity in young adults 12-17 years of age and adolescents 18-25  years of 
age to  infer vaccine efficacy is considered to be adequately demonstrated. 
Further analyses of the nAb responses stratified according to age group ≥12  to <16 years and ≥16 to 
<18 years indicates no difference in the magnitude of nAb levels at day 57.  This is somewhat unexpected 
and in contrast to recent findings with  another COVID-19 vaccine evaluated in adolescents. A possible 
explanation could be that  the antibody responses achieved after vaccination with  Spikevax reached a 
maximum level and plateau at that  level. The vaccine dose initially  chosen for the pivotal study was 
selected in view of the immune responses observed in elderly. As no dose-finding studies were conducted 
in subjects below 18 years of age, it is unclear whether the dose level evaluated is the most appropriate 
for this age group and whether lower doses would have triggered comparable responses in adolescents.  
No immunogenicity data are available from subjects who received placebo. Predictors of immune 
response, apart from age and immune status  remain uncertain. Likewise, the MAH stated  that no 
immunogenicity data from study P203  from subjects counted as SARS-CoV-2 infection have been 
available to date. Availability of such data would have been considered of value, yet the lack thereof does 
not impact on the overall conclusion of the primary immunogenicity comparison. 
Exploratory efficacy data 
Based on a very low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in adolescents tested SARS-CoV-2 negative at 
baseline and having received 2 doses 28 days apart, consistent vaccine efficacy across the different age 
groups (adolescents and adults) was reported. Using the  same COVID-19 case definition  as in the pivotal 
adult study P301  or a less stringent  CDC case definition  a VE of 100% (95%  CI: 28.9, NE;  0/4 cases) and 
93.3%  (95% CI: 47.9, 99.9;  1/7 cases), respectively, was estimated. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
was estimated to be 55.7% (95%CI: 16.8,  76.4).  
As can be expected, no severe cases occurred in the  study. The risk of severe disease increases with 
increasing age.  
The data further suggest that  the protection against asymptomatic disease may be (substantially) lower. 
This may be indicative of a shift  in disease severity on individual vaccinee level rather than complete 
infection prevention explaining part of the pronounced efficacy observed for symptomatic endpoints. It 
should be noted, however, that  sensitivity for estimating asymptomatic case prevention is likely limited 
due to operational constraints.  No firm conclusions regarding prevention of asymptomatic infection can be 
drawn for the  time being. Final study results should be submitted as soon as available. 
Information on the  virus variants causing COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in 
adolescents was not provided (exploratory endpoint). As the study was solely conducted in the USA 
between December 2020 and May 2021  it is unclear whether the circulating variants in the US at the time 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 46/88 
 
 
 
 
of study conduct are representative of the variants observed and currently spreading in  Europe. From 
virus variant distribution  data available from US CDC it  can be assumed that  the main virus variants 
circulating at the  time of study conduct  were the alpha, followed by the iota  and gamma variants. The 
delta variant, which is expected to become the predominant variant in Europe with  an anticipated 90% 
infection rate by end of August, was not substantially  circulating in the USA until early May. Although  no 
data is currently available on the duration of the immune response or protection, it is to be expected that 
the level of protection over time is similar to the adult  population. 
Concluding remarks 
In summary, and mainly building  on the co-primary immunobridging endpoints, efficacy against 
symptomatic COVID-19 can be inferred for adolescents 12-17  years of age. The effect size for efficacy 
endpoints was largely in agreement with  that  seen in adults overall, which  supports immunogenicity 
results but respective analyses are hampered by low case counts. 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P203  including the full bioanalytical report will  be 
submitted  no later than  September 2022 and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the marketing 
authorisation, in order to provide long-term efficacy data in adolescents 12-17 years of age. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From the data available, the CHMP  concludes that  Spikevax protects adolescents aged ≥12 to <18  years 
against symptomatic COVID-19 based on demonstration of non-inferior humoral immune responses 
compared to young adults ≥18 to  <25 years old. This is supported by exploratory analyses of efficacy. 
The CHMP considers the  following measure (SOB)  necessary to address the missing efficacy data:  
• 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P203  including the full bioanalytical report will 
be submitted no later than September 2022  and is subject to  a specific obligation laid down in the 
marketing authorisation.  This will provide long-term data.  
In addition, the following  recommendations (REC) are made: 
•  Since no dose finding trial in this  population has been conducted it  is not  possible to conclude 
whether lower dose could have resulted in a lower reactogenicity with  comparable immune 
response and efficacy. The MAH  should further explore lower dose levels in  adolescents 12-17 
years of age given the  high reactogenicity of Spikevax and the usually mild course of infection 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in this age group.  
• 
• 
The CHMP noted the evidence of acceptable assay control, assay validation and sample storage 
provided. Studies on sample stability  are ongoing; the MAH  should provide the respective 
validation reports upon completion. 
The MAH should provide, on a regular basis and as soon as (interim)  results are available, data 
from relevant endpoints, e.g. immunogenicity data over time, efficacy against variants, 
immunogenicity data from breakthrough cases. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
On 6th of January 2021, mRNA-1273  (COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna) was granted a conditional marketing 
authorisation in the  EU for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 47/88 
 
 
 
 
individuals 18 years of age and older. The present submission intends  to extend the  existing indication to 
individuals ≥12 years of age for the prevention of COVID-19. Route of administration, dose and schedule 
will be the same as for the adult indication,  i.e. 100 μg IM, given as 2  injections, 28 days apart. To 
extend the indication the MAH  submitted preliminary safety data from clinical trial mRNA-1273-P203.  This 
trial is a two-part Phase 2/3,  randomised, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, 
immunogenicity and efficacy of mRNA-1273  in healthy adolescents 12 to  < 18 years of age. 
Participants in Part A, the blinded Phase of the study are randomly assigned to receive 2 injections (28 
days apart) of either 100 μg of mRNA-1273 vaccine or placebo in a 2:1 randomisation ratio. The dosage 
and dosing schedule were identical  to that  used in adults  in study P301. 
Part B is an open-label observational phase of this study, designed to offer participants who received 
placebo in Part A of this  study and who meet the EUA eligibility criteria an option  to receive mRNA-1273 
in an open-label fashion. 
The safety data base of this submission includes data from the  08 May 2021 data snapshot with  a median 
study follow-up duration of 53 days (approximately 2 months)  after dose 2. Details are provided in the 
Patient disposition section below. 
Patient exposure and disposition 
As of 08  May 2021  (data snapshot date), 2,486  of 2,489  randomised participants (99.9%)  in the mRNA-
1273  group and 1,240  of 1,243 randomised participants (99.8%)  in the  placebo group had received dose 
1. 2,480  (99.6%)  and 1,222 (98.3%)  in the 2 groups had received dose 2, respectively. 
In the Safety Set population 2,480  of the 2,486 participants  included in the mRNA-1273 group (99.8%) 
and 1,222 of 1,240  in the placebo group (98.5%)  had received 2 doses. In the Solicited Safety Set 
population 2,478  participants of 2,485 included in  the mRNA-1273 group (99.7%)  and 1,220 of 1,240 
(98.4%)  participants included in the placebo group have received 2 doses, respectively. In the mRNA-
1273  group, the  median follow-up time was 83.5  days after dose 1, and 53 days after dose 2.  In the 
placebo group, the follow-up period was 82.0 days after dose 1, and 51  days after dose 2. 
The Safety Set consists of 1,838  subjects ≥12 and <16 years of age and of 648 subjects ≥16 and <18 
years of age who received at least one dose of in the mRNA-1273  vaccine, and of 929 and 311 subjects in 
the two  age cohorts who received placebo, respectively. The overall sample size of the  Safety Set 
included 3,726  subjects, 2,486  who received mRNA-1273 and 1,240  who received placebo. 
Overall 6.6% of subjects (245) of the 3,732  randomised subjects discontinued from study.  2.3% (57) of 
2,489  randomised subjects randomised to  the mRNA-1273 group, and 15.1%  (188) of 1,243  subjects 
randomised to the placebo group. 3 subjects in the  mRNA-1273 group discontinued due to an AE.  
An overview of participant disposition  in the safety Set is provided in Table 18 below.

In the Safety Set 43.7%  (1087) of the 2,486  subjects in the mRNA-1273  group and 38.2%  (474) of the 
1,240  subjects in the  placebo group had a follow-up time-period of ≥56 days post  dose 2. 54.9%  (1,366) 
of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 group and 56.4% (699)  subjects in the placebo group had a follow-up 
between ≥28 and <56  days after dose 2. All subjects except of 12 in the mRNA vaccine group and 27 in 
the placebo group had a follow-up time of 7 days after dose 2 (99.5%  and 97.8%, respectively). The 
follow-up duration by age cohort is provided in Table 19 below. In the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 801 
subjects ≥12 to <16  years of age (43.6%)  and 286  subjects ≥16  to <18  years of age (44.1%) had a 
follow-up period of ≥56  days after dose 2, and 1026  (55.8%) and 340  (52.5%) a follow-up period 
between ≥28 and <56  days after dose 2, respectively. In the  placebo-group 388 subjects ≥12 to <16 
years of age (41.8%)  and 86 subjects >16  to <18  years of age (27.7%) had a follow-up period of ≥56 
days after dose 2, and 582  (56.8%) and 171  (55.0%)  a follow-up period between ≥28 and <56 days 
after dose 2, respectively.

Table 19:  Summary of Study Duration by Age Group, Safety Set 
The CHMP noted that  the follow-up period in the Safety Set of the mRNA-1273  vaccine group was 
comparable between the 2 age cohorts ≥12 and <16  years and ≥16  and <18 years, but differed for the 2 
age cohorts in the placebo groups with  regards to the follow up period of ≥56 days. In the Safety Set, in 
the mRNA-1273  group, 43.6% of subjects ≥12 to <16  years of age and 44.1%  of subjects ≥16  to <18 
years had a follow-up period of more than 56 days after dose 2. In the placebo group only 27.7%  of 
subjects ≥16 to <18  years of age had a follow-up period more than 56  days post dose 2  (versus 41.8% 
of subjects >=12  and <16 years). Almost all subjects in the Safety Set received a second dose, i.e. 
99.8%  of subjects (2,480/2,486  subjects included in the  Safety Set) in the mRNA-1273  group and 98.5% 
in the placebo group (1,220/1,240  included in the Safety Set). 
Dropout rate was low in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group (overall 2.3% of subjects), but notably higher in 
the placebo group (overall 15.1%,  respectively), because of the increasing availability of authorised 
mRNA-COVID-19 vaccines. Mainly adolescents between 16  to 18 years of age requested unblinding.  This 
was confirmed by the sponsor. In the mRNA-1273  group 1.2% of subjects in  the ≥12 to <16  years of age 
cohort, and 5.4% in the  ≥16 to <18  years of age cohort discontinued  from trial. In the placebo group the 
percentage was 45% in the  ≥16 to <18  years of age cohort and 5.0%  in the ≥12  to <16 years of age 
cohort.  
There is a discrepancy between the  disposition analysis in the table and the analysis for unsolicited AEs 
leading to discontinuation  from study vaccine. Overall, 3 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group, and 
not only 1 as listed in the table, discontinued the  trial due to AEs (COVID-19, eye swelling, drug-induced 
liver injury, all AEs considered being not  related to study vaccine). Details for the 3 AEs that lead to 
discontinuation  are provided in the corresponding section “Discontinuation  due to  adverse events”.

Demography 
In the Safety Set, 74.3%  of subjects (2767)  were enrolled in the younger age cohort (≥12  to <16  years 
of age). Of them, 1,838  subjects (73.9%)  were enrolled in the  mRNA-1273 group, and 929 (74.9%)  in 
the placebo group. 25.7%  (959 subjects) were enrolled in the older age cohort (≥16 to  <18 years of 
age), 648 subjects in the mRNA-1273  group (26.1%),  and 311  (25.1%) in  the placebo group, 
respectively. Overall, 87.0% of subjects were seronegative at baseline, 87.2%  (2167 subjects) in the 
mRNA-1273  group, and 86.7%  (1075)  in the placebo group. Overall, 51.4%  of subjects (1915)  were 
male, and 48.6%  (1811)  were female. 83.9%  (3126  subjects) of all subjects in the Safety Set were 
White,  83.9% (2085  subjects) in the mRNA-1273 group, and 84.0%  (1041)  in the placebo group. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics for the Safety Set are provided in Table 20 below.

Table 20:  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics in Study mRNA-1273-P203  (Safety Set) 
The CHMP considered that  the demographic and baseline characteristics of the safety set are balanced 
between the mRNA-1273  group and the placebo group in the  older and the younger age cohort. The 
majority of subjects was enrolled in the younger age cohort ≥12 to 16  years of age (74.3%  of subjects). 
83.9%  of subjects were white.  48.6%  of subjects were female and 51.4%  were male. The majority of 
subjects was seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (87.0%).  SARS-CoV-2 status at baseline has been

determined by a combination of the results of the  RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal or nasal swab) and Elecsys 
binding antibody test  specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid evaluation.  
Safety analysis set 
The following two safety sets apply in this  trial: 
1.  Solicited Safety Set: 
The Solicited Safety Set consists of FAS participants who contributed any solicited AR data. The 
Solicited Safety Set will be used for the analyses of solicited ARs. FAS includes all randomised 
participants who received at least 1 injection of IP. 
2.  Safety Set: 
The safety Set consists of all randomised participants  who receive at least 1 dose of IP (i.e. the 
FAS). The Safety Set will be used for all analyses of safety except for the  solicited ARs. 
Adverse events 
The overall sample size of the Safety Set included 3,726  subjects, 2,486 who received at least one dose 
of mRNA-1273 vaccine, and 1,240  who received at least one dose of placebo. The majority of subjects 
belong to the age cohort ≥12  and <16 years of age (1,838  subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and 
929 in  the placebo group). 648 and 311  subjects are included in  the age cohort ≥16 to  <18 years. 
The solicited safety set included almost the same sample size like the  safety set, i.e. overall 2,485 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (1,838  in the age cohort ≥12 to <16  years of age and 647 ≥16 
to <18  years of age), and 1,240 in the  placebo group (929 subjects in the younger and 311  in the older 
age cohort).  
Solicited adverse reactions 
Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) were evaluated through  7 days after each dose (ie, 
the day of injection and six subsequent days). Solicited ARs were recorded daily using an eDiary, which 
was unchanged from the eDiary used in the study P301 submission for adults  aged ≥ 18 years. The 
solicited local ARs assessed included pain, erythema, swelling, and axillary swelling or tenderness. 
Solicited systemic ARs included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, chills,  and nausea/vomiting. 
Severity grading of reactogenicity occurred automatically based on participant  entry into  the eDiary 
according to  grading scales modified from the  Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult  and Adolescent 
Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials. 
Solicited local ARs 
The incidence of local ARs was higher in  the mRNA-1273 group compared with  the placebo group after 
any and after each dose. Any solicited local AR after any dose was recorded for 97.8% of subjects in the 
mRNA-1273  vaccine group (2,431/2,485)  and for 48.5%  of subjects (602/1,240)  in the placebo group. 
The most frequently reported local solicited AR in  the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group after any dose 
was injection site pain reported by 97.2% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and by 45.9% of 
subjects in the placebo group. This was followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (34.6%  versus 
10.7%),  swelling (27.7%  versus 1.9%), and erythema/redness (25.8% versus 1.5%).  The events of 
erythema and swelling tended to be more often reported after dose 2, whereas the incidence of pain and 
axillary swelling or tenderness were comparable after dose 1 and dose 2. The incidence for each solicited 
local AR after each dose by severity is presented in Table 21, and after any dose in Table 22. The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

majority of solicited local ARs was mild to moderate. However, any grade 3 solicited local AR after any 
dose was recorded for 13.8%  of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and for 0.3%  in the placebo 
group. The severity slightly increased from dose 1 to  dose 2. 6.8%  of subjects reported any grade 3 local 
solicited AR post dose 1 versus 8.9% post dose 2. No grade 4  solicited local AR was recorded. Grade 3 
local solicited ARs were mostly recorded for pain (9.1%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group after 
any dose), followed by erythema (3.5%),  swelling (3.2%),  and axillary swelling or tenderness (0.6%). 
The majority of solicited local ARs in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group occurred within  the first 1  to 2 days 
after any dose (97.4%  of subjects). 1.3% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group reported solicited 
local ARs with  onset after day 7. Solicited local ARs usually persisted for a median of 3 days. 6.4%  of 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group reported solicited local ARs that  persisted beyond day 7 after 
dose 1 and 1.6%  after dose 2. The proportion of subjects in the placebo group was 1.2% and 0.7%  after 
dose 1 and dose 2, respectively.

Solicited systemic ARs 
The incidence of systemic ARs was higher in the  mRNA-1273 group compared with  the placebo group 
after any and after each dose. Any solicited systemic AR after any dose was recorded for 91.9%  of 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (2,284/2,485)  and for 66.9%  of subjects (830/1,240)  in the 
placebo group. 
The most frequently reported systemic solicited AR in the  mRNA-1273 group after any dose was 
headache reported by 78.4% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and by 50.3%  of subjects in 
the placebo group. This was followed by fatigue (75.2%  versus 47.5%),  myalgia (54.3%  versus 23.5%), 
chills (49.1%  versus 16.2%),  arthralgia (34.6  versus 16.9%), and nausea (29.3% versus 15.2%).  Fever 
of any grade was reported by 13.7%  versus 1.9% of subjects. The incidence of solicited systemic ARs 
was notably higher after dose 2 compared with  dose 1. Any solicited systemic AR was reported by 68.5% 
of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group after dose 1 and by 86.1% after dose 2. The incidence for 
each solicited systemic AR after each dose by severity is presented in Table 6, and after any dose in Table 
7. Though the majority of systemic solicited ARs was mild to moderate it  should be noted,  that any grade 
3 solicited systemic AR after any dose was recorded for 16.5%  of subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group (versus 4.6% in the  placebo group). Severity of systemic AEs increased from dose 1 to dose 2. 
Grade 3 AEs were reported by 4.4% versus 13.7%  of subjects after each dose. Grade 4 solicited systemic 
ARs were recorded for 3 subjects in the mRNA-1273  group (fever, headache, nausea/vomiting). Grade 3 
systemic solicited ARs were mostly recorded for fatigue (8.5%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine 
group after any dose), followed by headache (6.4%), myalgia (5.8%), arthralgia (2.7%),  fever (2.2%), 
chills (0.5%),  and nausea (0.2%).  The majority of solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-1273  vaccine 
group occurred within  the first 1 to 2 days after any dose (89.1%  of subjects). 0.7%  of subjects in the 
mRNA-1273  vaccine group reported solicited systemic ARs with  onset after day 7. Solicited systemic ARs 
usually persisted for a median of 2 days. 4.7%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group reported 
solicited systemic ARs that persisted beyond day 7 after dose 1  and 3.1%  after dose 2. The proportion of 
subjects in the placebo group was 5.2% and 2.6%  after dose 1  and dose 2, respectively. Because of the 
higher systemic reactogenicity the  use of antipyretic or pain medication was notably higher in the mRNA-
1273  vaccine group compared with  the placebo group. In the mRNA-1273  vaccine group, 30.1% of 
subjects used such medication after dose 1 and 50.1%  after dose 2.  The proportion was 9.5% and 8.9% 
in the placebo group, respectively.

The CHMP noted that,  as can be expected, the incidence of solicited local and systemic ARs was higher in 
the mRNA-1273  group compared with  the placebo group. Although  the majority of solicited ARs (local and 
systemic) was mild to  moderate, it should be noted that  after any dose in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group 
13.8%  of subjects reported grade 3  solicited local and 16,5%  solicited systemic ARs. For solicited local 
reactions no clear trend could be observed regarding differences in severity post dose 1 and post dose 2. 
The incidence of solicited systemic ARs however was notably higher post dose 2 compared to  post dose 1, 
i.e. depending on the kind of event approximately 2- to 3-fold higher after dose 2 than after dose 1. 
Because of the  higher systemic reactogenicity, the use of antipyretic or pain medication was notably 
higher in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group compared with  the placebo group. In the mRNA-1273  vaccine 
group, 30.1% of subjects used such medication after dose 1 and 50.1%  after dose 2. The proportion was 
9.5% and 8.9%  in the placebo group, respectively. 
Solicited ARs by age  group 
The solicited safety set included 1,838 subjects ≥12-<16  years of age who had received at least one dose 
of mRNA-1273, and 648  subjects ≥ 16  to < 18 years of age who had received at least one dose of 
mRNA.-1273.  In the mRNA-1275 vaccine group, any solicited AR after any dose was recorded by 99.1% 
of participants ≥12 to  <16 years of age and by 99.5%  of participants ≥16 to  <18 years of age. Any 
solicited local AR in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group was recorded by 97.9% versus 97.5%  of subjects in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

the 2 age cohorts, and any solicited systemic AR by 91.6%  versus 92.7% respectively. The most often 
recorded solicited local AR in both age cohorts was pain recorded by 97.4%  of subjects ≥12-<16  years of 
age and by 96.6% of subjects ≥16 to  <18 years of age, followed by axillary swelling or tenderness 
(33.9%  and 36.5%), and swelling/hardness (28.9% and 24.3%).  Erythema was recorded by 26.7% and 
23.3%  of participants  in the 2 age cohorts, respectively. Any solicited systemic AR after any dose was 
recorded by 91.6%  of subjects ≥12  to <16 years of age and by 92.7% of subjects ≥16 to  <18 years of 
age in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group. The most frequent solicited systemic AR in  both age groups was 
headache (77.6%  and 80.4%), followed by fatigue (74.8% and 76.4%),  myalgia (52.8%  and 58.6%), 
and arthralgia (32.9%  and 39.3%).  Any solicited AR grade 3 or more was recorded by 25.6% of subjects 
in the younger compared to 24.4% of subjects in the older age group. Any local solicited AR grade 3 or 
more was recorded by 14.6%  versus 11.7%,  and any systemic solicited AR grade 3 or more by 16.6% 
versus 16.8%  of subjects in the 2 age cohorts. 
The CHMP noted that  the number of subjects included into  the ≥12 to  <16 years of age cohort was 
approximately 3 times higher than the number of subjects in the  older age cohort ≥16  to <18 years 
(1,838  versus 647 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group). Local and systemic reactogenicity was 
generally comparable in the 2 age cohorts with  regard to frequency and severity. 
Data on the  solicited systemic and local ARs by dose in the age cohort 18  to 25 years of age from study 
P301 suggested a higher local reactogenicity for all solicited local ARs except for pain in the  age cohort 12 
to <18  years compared with the age cohort 18 to 25 years of age. The incidence of solicited systemic ARs 
tended to be comparable or slightly higher in the  age cohort 18 to 25  years of age. Comparing the 
incidence of severe (grade 3) systemic ARs shows a clear difference between adolescents (4.4%  dose 1, 
13.7%  dose 2) and young adults (5.2% dose 1, 21.6%  dose 2), especially after dose 2. It should be 
taken into account, that  the sample size in the age cohort 12  to <18 years was 3-fold higher than in the 
age cohort 18  to 25 years of age and the control group is a historical one. Solicited local and systemic 
ARs for the age group 18 to  25 years of age are presented in  Table 25 and Table 26.

Solicited ARs by SARS-CoV-2  serostatus 
The solicited safety set of the mRNA-1273 vaccine group includes 2,167  subjects seronegative for SARS-
CoV-2 at baseline and 147 subjects seropositive. The respective numbers for the  placebo group are 1075 
and 69 subjects.  
In the mRNA-1275  vaccine group, any solicited AR after any dose was recorded by 99.4% of participants 
seronegative at baseline, and by 98.6% of participants seropositive at baseline. Any solicited local AR in 
the mRNA-1273  vaccine group was recorded by 98.1% versus 94.6%  of subjects, respectively. Any 
solicited systemic AR was reported by 91.7%  versus 93.9%  of seronegative and seropositive subjects. 
The most often recorded solicited local AR in  seronegative and seropositive subjects of the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group was pain recorded by 97.5% versus 92.5%  of subjects, followed by axillary swelling or 
tenderness (34.3%  and 44.2%),  and swelling/hardness (28.3%  and 22.4%).  Erythema was recorded by 
26.5%  and 21.1%  of participants, respectively. Any solicited systemic AR after any dose was recorded by 
91.7%  of seronegative subjects and by 93.9%  of seropositive subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group. 
The most frequent solicited systemic AR in both  age groups was headache (78.3% and 80.3%),  followed 
by fatigue (74.9% and 80.3%),  myalgia (54.0%  and 59.2%),  chills (48.7% and 61.2%)  and arthralgia 
(34.6%  and 38.1%). Any fever was recorded by 13.0% of seronegative and 25.9%  of seropositive 
subjects. Any solicited AR grade 3 or more was recorded by 25.4% of seronegative subjects compared to 
24.5%  of seropositive subjects. Any local solicited AR grade 3 or more was recorded for 13.8%  versus 
15.0%,  and any systemic solicited AR grade 3 or more by 16.5% versus 20.4%  of seronegative and 
seropositive subjects. 
After dose one any solicited AR was recorded by 96.1%  of seronegative and 93.9%  of seropositive 
subjects, any solicited local AR was recorded by 94.6%  versus 89.1%,  and any solicited systemic AR by 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021

67.6  versus 87.1%, respectively. After dose 2 any solicited AR was recorded for 97.5% of seronegative 
and 91.1% of seropositive subjects, and any solicited local AR by 93.8 and 85.6%  of subjects, 
respectively. Any solicited systemic AR was recorded for 86.3% of seronegative and 83.6% of 
seropositive subjects. 
The CHMP considered that  there is an imbalance with regard to  the sample size of seronegative and 
seropositive subjects in  the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group. The huge majority of subjects in the 
solicited safety set of the mRNA-1273  vaccine group was seronegative (2167 subjects). Only 147 subjects 
were seropositive. This needs to be taken into  account when  comparing reactogenicity data in that 
subgroup. Results should be interpreted with  caution. The incidence of solicited local and systemic ARs 
after any dose was nonetheless, except for fever (13.0% versus 25.9%  of seronegative and seropositive 
subjects), in general comparable in the two  groups. No  notable difference with  regard to severity of ARs 
could be observed. The CHMP considered that  the data do not indicate any notable increased 
reactogenicity for seropositive individuals.  
Solicited ARs by gender 
The solicited safety set included slightly more males than females (1283  versus 1203 subjects in the 
mRNA-1273  vaccine group). In the mRNA-1275  vaccine group, any solicited AR after any dose was 
recorded for 99.1%  of male participants, and for 99.4% of female participants. Any solicited local AR in 
the mRNA-1273  vaccine group was recorded by 97.1% versus 98.6%  of subjects, respectively. The most 
often recorded solicited local AR in male and female subjects was pain recorded by 96.2% versus 98.3% 
of subjects, followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (35.7% and 33.4%),  and swelling/hardness 
(24.8%  and 30.8%). Erythema was recorded by 24.4%  and 27.3%  of participants, respectively. Any 
solicited systemic AR after any dose was recorded by 90.2%  of male subjects and by 93.8%  of female 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group. The most frequent solicited systemic AR in both age groups 
was headache (75.1% and 81.8%),  followed by fatigue (72.6%  and 77.9%),  myalgia (52.3%  and 
56.4%),  and chills (47.6% and 50.6%).  Any fever was recorded by 15.1%  of male and 12.1%  of female 
subjects. Any solicited AR grade 3 or more was recorded by 22.7% of male subjects compared to 28.1% 
of female subjects. Any local solicited AR grade 3 or more was recorded by 11.5%  versus 16.3%, and any 
systemic solicited AR grade 3 or more by 15.3% versus 18.1%  of male and female subjects. 
The CHMP considered that  the solicited safety set was rather balanced with  regard to gender with  only 
slightly more males than females being enrolled (1283  versus 1203  subjects each). In contrast to the 
placebo group were notable differences between males and females with  regard to the incidence of any 
solicited AR could be observed, only a slight increase in reports of any solicited ARs post dose 1 in 
females compared to males (97.4%  versus 94.5%)  could be seen; the incidence post  dose 2 was 
comparable (97.9 in females versus 96.2%  in males). The incidence of any solicited AR after any dose 
was 99.4% in  females versus 99.1% in males. Local reactogenicity was comparable between males and 
females with  regard to frequency and severity. Systemic ARs tended to be numerically slightly higher in 
female compared with  male subjects but were overall within  the same range. The same was observed for 
grade 3 and more systemic ARs that  tended to be slightly higher in females, but overall within  the  same 
range compared to males. In general, no clinical meaningful difference is observed with  regard to 
reactogenicity of mRNA-1273  between females and males.  
Unsolicited adverse events 
Unsolicited AEs are in the submitted  clinical overview and tables also referred to as treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded through 28 days after each Injection. Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation  from vaccination and/or study participation,  medically attended adverse events (MAAEs), 
SAEs, AESIs (in  this study an AESI is the event of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, MIS-
C), and pregnancies are being collected from Day 1 through the  entire study  period or until  last day of 
study participation.

Summary of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality 
The incidence of unsolicited TEAEs was higher in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with  the 
placebo group. Unsolicited TEAEs irrespective of causality up to 28 days after any dose were reported by 
20.5%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273  group (510/2,486  subjects) compared to 15.9% of participants in 
the placebo group (197/1,240  subjects).  
An overview of unsolicited AEs with  a frequency of more than  1% up to 28 days after any dose for all 
ages irrespective of causality is given in Table 27. 
Table 27:  Incidence of Unsolicited TEAEs With Occurrence in ≥ 1%  of Participants in Any Treatment 
Group up  to 28 Days After Any Dose Classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term, All Participants Aged ≥ 12 to < 18  Years (Safety Set) 
The most commonly recorded unsolicited TEAEs with  a frequency of more than 1% occurred in the  SOC 
General disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 10.1%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group and by 4.0%  of subjects in the placebo group. This included events of injection site 
lymphadenopathy (4.3%  versus 0.4%), injection site erythema (1.9% versus 0.2%),  fatigue (1.9% 
each), injection site induration (1.1%  versus 0.2%), and injection site pain (1.1  versus 0.6%). All of the 
reports of injection site lymphadenopathy were identified as axillary (underarm) swelling or tenderness

ipsilateral to the side of the  injection. The incidence of lymphadenopathy within  28 days after any dose 
was 0.7% in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group (18 subjects) and < 0.1% in  the placebo group (1 subject). 
Within  the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 1.1% of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group and 0.6% in the placebo group reported any unsolicited AE. This imbalance is mostly attributable 
to the events of urticaria (6 subjects/0.2%  versus 1 subject/<0.1%),  pityriasis rosea (3 subjects/0.1% 
versus 0 subjects), and rash. Rash included any rash (3 subjects/0,1% versus 1 subject/<0.1%),  rash 
pruritic (1 subject/0.1%  versus 0 subjects) and rash vascular (1 subject/<0.1  versus 0 subjects). 
Other numerical imbalances were observed in the  SOC of: 
• 
Immune system disorders 
o  Type IV hypersensitivity reaction: 3 subjects (0.1%)  in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group 
and no subjects in  the placebo group. 
• 
Psychiatric disorders (ADHD, anxiety) 
o  attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder: 6 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group 
(0.2%)  versus no subject in  the placebo group 
o  anxiety and anxiety disorder together: 8 subjects in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and 2 
subjects in the placebo group. 
• 
Endocrine disorders 
o  Hypothyroidism: 2 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (<0.1%)  and no subject in 
the placebo group. 
•  Nervous system disorders: 
o  dizziness 4 subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group and no subject in  the placebo 
group. 
• 
Eye disorders: 5  subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group versus one subject in the  placebo 
group. The individual events in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group included (eye pain, eye swelling, 
eyelid oedema, periorbital inflammation, and transient blindness). 
Single events of interest are metabolic glucose tolerance impairment (diagnosed as prediabetic), insulin 
resistance, cardiac disorder of palpitation. 
Severe unsolicited AEs were reported by 0.2%  of subjects (4/2,486)  in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
and by <0.1%  (1 subject) in the  placebo group. The severe unsolicited AEs in the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group were one event each of appendicitis, diarrhoea, vomiting,  drug-induced liver injury, testicular 
torsion, and concussion in  a total  of 4  participants. 
Any COVID-19 was reported in 0.2% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (5 subjects) versus 
1.0% in  the placebo group (13 subjects). 
The CHMP noted that  the incidence of unsolicited  adverse events irrespective of causality was higher in 
the mRNA-1273  vaccine group compared with  the placebo group. None of the severe unsolicited AEs that 
occurred in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group were considered being vaccine related. The grade 3 events of 
vomiting and diarrhoea occurred in one subject together with  the event of appendicitis, which is listed as 
an AESI in the EMA  monthly summary safety report (MSSR). The case of drug-induced liver injury is 
discussed in the  SAE section of this report. 
Psychiatric disorders:

A numerical disbalance is observed for the event of attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder within  28 days 
after vaccination (6 subjects [0.2%]  in the mRNA-1273  versus no subject in the  placebo group). It should 
be noted that 2  cases of ADHD in the placebo group occurred after day 28 (day 29 [grade 2, ongoing] 
and day 59 [grade 2, ongoing], both  post dose 2). Considering that ADHD is no acute event that  leads to 
an immediate diagnosis, it  seems legitimate to include these events from the placebo group for 
considerations regarding relatedness and relevance of this  AE. The difference for other psychiatric 
disorders was less pronounced. Anxiety/anxiety disorder e.g. was recorded for 8 subjects in the mRNA-
1273  vaccine group and for 2 subjects in  the placebo group (0.3% versus 0.2%).  The overall incidence of 
events in  the SOC of psychiatric disorder was 0.7%  versus 0.5%. The MAH submitted  narratives for all 
subjects receiving placebo or mRNA-1273  with  at least one AE within  the SOC of psychiatric disorders 
with  onset within  28 days following any injection. Some of the events in the placebo and the vaccine 
group were already known from the subjects medical history and need to be classified as worsening of 
event (e.g. one event of tic,  one of depression, one of anxiety, and one of ADHD in the vaccine group). 
All others are new onset events, the majority not resolved at the time of data snapshot. None of the 
events of psychiatric disorders in the vaccine group except of tic (actually worsening of pre-existing motor 
tic) was assessed as vaccine related by the  investigator. The field of psychiatric disorders is complex and 
major changes in the neural system happen during childhood and adolescence. According to CDC in the 
US 9.4% of children aged 2-17  years have received an ADHD diagnosis, 7.4%  of children aged 3-17 
years have a diagnosed behaviour problem, 7.1%  of children aged 3-17 years have diagnosed anxiety, 
and 3.2% of children aged 3-17  years have diagnosed depression. The incidence of psychiatric disorders 
in this  trial is below that  number in both groups and there is no notable difference between the placebo 
and the vaccine group with  overall 18 events (0.7%)  versus 6 events (0.5%).  A final conclusion on 
vaccine relatedness based on this  small sample size would be premature and unreliable.  
Endocrine disorders: 
Two cases of hypothyroidism were reported in the vaccine group. One grade 1 event was reported on day 
3 after dose 2. Another grade 2 event occurred on day 23 after dose 2. The first case was resolving and 
ongoing, the second case ongoing at the time of data snapshot. Both cases were assessed as not  related 
to the mRNA-1273  vaccine. For both cases no clinical information has been submitted.  It is unclear 
whether the cases of hypothyroidism are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis,  the most common cause of 
acquired hypothyroidism in children and adolescents. From the 2 cases of hypothyroidism in the  vaccine 
group a final conclusion on causality is not possible.  
Metabolism disorders: 
Two cases of glucose metabolism disorders occurred in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and one in the 
placebo group. The first case of prediabetic diagnosed in  the vaccine group was recorded for an obese 
study participant (BMI of 39.6  kg/m2 [BMI Z-score 2.42].  The event started on day 22  after dose 2. An 
event of insulin  resistance was recorded for an overweight study participant  (BMI of 27.9kg/m2  (BMI Z-
score 1.40).  The event started on day 6 after dose 2. The event of diabetes mellitus in the  placebo group 
happened to  an obese study  participant with  a BMI of 53.9 kg/m2 (Z-score 3.10)  with  onset on Day 10 
after the first dose of placebo. 
With  regard to the cases of glucose metabolism disorders vaccine relatedness cannot be concluded on. All 
3 subjects were obese or overweight, which  is an additional  risk factor for glucose metabolism disorders. 
One subject is Hispanic,  a population  at higher risk for prediabetes. The prevalence of prediabetes among 
adolescents is high in  the US with nearly 1  in 5 adolescents (Andes LJ,  Cheng YJ, Rolka DB et al. 
Prevalence of Prediabetes Among Adolescents and Young Adults in the  United States, 2005-2016.  JAMA 
Pediatr. 2020;174(2):e194498.

Eye disorders: 
A minor numerical imbalance was observed for eye disorders (<0.1%  in the placebo versus 0.2%)  in the 
vaccine group. Of interest was the  event of transient blindness, which was assessed as vaccine related by 
the investigator and a case of eyelid swelling after both  doses of mRNA-1273. The MAH  submitted 
narratives for 6  cases of eye disorders in the  vaccine group and 2 in the  placebo group.  
A case of transient blindness was reported. The subject woke up in the middle of the night,  turned on the 
bedroom light,  and was unable to see anything before regaining  vision after approximately 1 minute.  The 
CHMP  supports the  MAH’s assessment that  this event is unlikely to represent a primary eye disorder or 
thromboembolic event and most likely related to adaptation to light. 
The event of eyelid swelling on day 10 and day 3 post dose 1 and post dose 2 was recorded for a study 
participant with  an ongoing medical history of red dye allergy, asthma, and seasonal allergies. Both 
events of eye lid swelling happened after nut/  and or almond exposure. 
The other 4 events of eye disorder in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group included conjunctival haemorrhage, 
eye swelling diagnosed as trochleitis, eye pain, and eye swelling. 
The events of type IV hypersensitivity reactions, and dizziness, are discussed in the section below “AEs 
considered being vaccine related”. The event of palpitation is discussed in the  section 
myocarditis/pericarditis. 
Summary of unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related 
Unsolicited TEAEs considered being vaccine related were recorded by 12.6% of subjects in the mRNA-
1273  vaccine group (312/2,486)  and by 5.8%  of subjects (72/1,240)  in  the placebo group. Most 
frequently TEAEs considered being vaccine related were reported in the SOC of General disorders and 
administration site conditions  (9.6% of subjects [238/2,486]  in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and 3.5% 
in the placebo group [43/1,240]),  followed by the SOC of Nervous system disorders (2.4%  [59/2,486) 
versus 1.8% [22/1,240]). 
TEAEs considered being vaccine related and reported by ≥ 2% of participants in the mRNA-1273  vaccine 
group through 28 days after any dose were injection site  lymphadenopathy reported by 4.3% 
(108/2,486)  of subjects and headache reported by 2.2% (55/2,486)  of subjects. Lymphadenopathy (not 
restricted to injection site) considered being vaccine related was reported by 0.6% of subjects 
(16/2,486). 
The following vaccine related unsolicited AEs in the mRNA-vaccine group occurred in a lower frequency 
than 2%  but with  an imbalance compared to the placebo group. Some of these events (injection  site 
urticaria, hypersensitivity, lymphadenopathy) are already listed as AE for adult  subjects: 
• 
• 
Lymphadenopathy: 0.6%  of subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group and no subject in the 
placebo group 
Type IV hypersensitivity reaction: 3 subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group and no subject in 
the placebo group 
•  Dizziness: 3 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and no subject in the  placebo group 
•  Oropharyngeal pain: 5  subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group and no subject in  the placebo 
group 
•  Urticaria: 4 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and 1 subject in the placebo group 
• 
Injection site hypersensitivity: 8 subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (0.3%) and no subject 
in the placebo group 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 69/88 
 
 
 
 
• 
Injection site urticaria: 4 subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group (0.2%)  and no subject in the 
placebo group.  
The CHMP considered that  most of unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related are attributable to 
events of local injection site reactions in the  SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions. 
Not  all of the unsolicited  AEs that  were recorded in this  trial and that were considered being vaccine 
related are covered in the  SmPC for the  paediatric population yet. 
With  regard to the adverse reaction table in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the CHMP decided that  a single 
table for all ages is appropriate, i.e. all AEs from the paediatric population  not listed yet in the “adult” 
table should be included in the existing table, with  correct frequency. 
Type IV hypersensitivity reactions: 
The three unsolicited  AEs of type IV hypersensitivity reactions in the 3 subjects were all events of delayed 
cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions with  onset on Day 8 to 11  after the first  dose of mRNA-1273. One 
subject did not provide an additional description about the event. A second subject noted a non-urticarial 
rash on the  left upper arm (ipsilateral to where the injection was given) and the third reported a pruritic, 
papular non-urticarial rash on the lower legs. None of the three subjects reported notable solicited local 
adverse reactions in the eDiary after the  first dose of mRNA-1273 other than  Grade 1 injection site pain. 
Because of the  timing being consistent with  reports of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, the 
events of type IV hypersensitivity reactions are considered most probably vaccine associated. A separate 
variation is already under discussion to  update the product information regarding delayed injection site 
reactions. It  is therefore decided to include delayed injection site reactions as an AR in the  SmPC. 
Dizziness: 
3 cases of dizziness are considered being vaccine related by the  investigator. The onset was on day 2, 1, 
and 10. The onset time of one of the 3 events, i.e. 10 days after vaccination, is long for vaccine related 
dizziness. A biological plausibility for dizziness being vaccine related is given. A causal relationship 
between vaccination with  mRNA-1273  and the adverse event of dizziness is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The event of dizziness is therefore included in  section 4.8  of the SmPC. 
Urticaria/Hypersensitivity:  
Four subjects (0.2%)  in the mRNA-1273 group and 1 subject (<0.1%)  in the placebo group had at least 
one unsolicited treatment-related TEAE of urticaria up to 28 days after any injection. The 4 events in the 
mRNA-1273  vaccine group occurred on day 1,4,11,  and 21 after vaccination and were either generalised 
(one case) or restricted to parts of the body (feet and elbows, groin, left deltoid, back and right  leg). All 4 
events were assessed as being vaccine related by the investigator. The assessment is supported. The 
events are suggestive of a hypersensitivity response. The event of hypersensitivity is covered in the 
SmPC, but  only for adult subjects. During licensure of mRNA-1273 it  was agreed to summarise all events 
indicative of hypersensitivity under the  PT “hypersensitivity” and not to list  them separately (leading to 
the frequency calculation “unknown”).  The events of hypersensitivity and injection site urticaria are 
already covered in the  SmPC.  
Hot  flush: 
One case of hot flush was reported 6 hours after dose 1. The event resolved at midnight  and did not 
reoccur after dose 2. The case was assessed as being vaccine related by the investigator. Hot  flush is a 
commonly described reaction after a vaccination procedure. A procedure related stress response cannot 
be excluded. 
Discoloration at injection site: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 70/88 
 
 
 
 
One subject experienced injection site discoloration on day 11 after dose 1, resolving on day 15.  Other 
local injection site reactions after dose 1 included grade 1 pain and grade 1  redness. The event was 
actually not assessed as vaccine related by the investigator. However, such local AR cannot totally be 
excluded. 
For the two  events of hot flush and injection site discoloration a causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
Both are singular events, were mild and resolved. It is considered acceptable to not include them in the 
SmPC for the time being. 
Hypoaesthesia: 
There was one event of treatment-related hypoaesthesia (bilateral arm numbness, grade 2, onset on day 
5 after first vaccination, still  ongoing). Considering that there was also an imbalance for treatment-
related events of hypoaesthesia in the adult study (vaccine: 4  events, placebo: no event), this  AE is 
therefore added in  section 4.8  of the SmPC. 
Chilblains: 
There was one event of treatment-related chilblains in the vaccine group. Of note, the event of chilblains 
has been associated with  (often otherwise asymptomatic) COVID-19 infection and was also referred to as 
“COVID toe” (https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2020.05.012,  DOI: 10.1111/jdv.16753).  According to 
narratives for this  event (verbatim worsening pernio, right  foot), the subject had a history of acrocyanosis 
(since April 2020),  chronic chilblains (since March 2020),  coagulation disorders (FV and FVII deficiency, 
since June 2020) and chronic toe infections prior to receipt of mRNA-1273. Therefore, it is agreed with 
the MAH  that a causal association with  vaccination is improbable for the time being. 
Lymphadenopathy: 
The AE of lymphadenopathy is listed as an adverse reaction with  the frequency of very common. This 
event was solicited as axillary swelling ipsilateral to  the vaccination arm. The provided AE listings  indicate 
that  in some cases other lymph nodes (e. g. 4x cervical, 6x supraclavicular) were also involved. Similar 
observations were made in the adult study. Therefore, the footnote of Table 1 of section 4.8  of the  SmPC 
is amended to inform about these findings. 
Anaphylaxis 
No cases of anaphylactic reaction considered being vaccine related were reported in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group. 
Hypersensitivity 
Taking the narrow and broad hypersensitivity SQM together 1.9% (46)  of subjects in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group and 0.8% (10) of subjects in the placebo group reported any event indicating 
hypersensitivity. Taking the narrow scope, the proportion was 1.6% (39) and 0.5%  (6) of subjects.  
The most frequently reported events considered being vaccine related (narrow and broad hypersensitivity 
SMQ) in the mRNA-1273  group were injection site hypersensitivity (8  subjects, 0.3%),  injection site 
urticaria (0.2%, 4 subjects), rash (0.2%, 4  subjects) and urticaria (0.2%,  6 subjects). 3  subjects (0.1%) 
reported a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. This included a non-urticarial rash at the upper arm, and a 
pruritic rash of lower legs. One type IV hypersensitivity reaction was not further specified. Injection site 
rash was reported by 2 subjects (<0.1%).  Individual reports of vaccine related events indicating 
hypersensitivity included worsening of photosensitivity, sneezing, wheezing, pruritus,  and vesicular, 
pruritic and urticarial rash. Hypersensitivity reactions also include cases of delayed cutaneous 
hypersensitivity reactions. One case of anaphylactic reaction not  assessed as vaccine related was 
reported (anaphylactic reaction to  tree nut).

A separate variation is already under discussion to update the product  information regarding delayed 
injection site reactions. Considering that  an imbalance in delayed / type IV hypersensitivity reactions was 
noted in the clinical trials, it  is therefore decided to include delayed injection site reactions as an AR in the 
SmPC. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
Within  28 days after each vaccination any SAE was reported by 2 subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group any by 1 subject in the placebo group (<0.1%).  The 2 SAEs in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
included one event of drug-induced liver injury in one participant  and one event each of appendicitis, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, and post-procedural fever in a second participant. 
The event of drug-induced liver injury occurred in a study participant who received the first dose of 100 
μg mRNA1273  in the left arm. 7 days later the participant was found to have a Bartholin gland cyst that 
was treated for 7 days with  sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. On day 13, the study participant  experienced 
fever, fatigue, and generalised body aches. Per report, a COVID-19 test  was negative. On day 16, the 
study participant went  to the emergency room with  intermittent  fevers, nausea, vomiting, and decreased 
oral intake. The rash was largely resolved at this time.  The study participant  was admitted to hospital for 
treatment of nausea and vomiting. Laboratory results and ultrasound indicated liver involvement. The 
study participant reported malaise and headaches for 1.5 weeks, fevers for 4 days, and nausea/vomiting 
for 1 day, moreover progressively dark coloured urine, no jaundice and clay coloured stool. Hepatitis 
panel including hepatitis  A IgM, hepatitis  B core IgM, hepatitis B surface Ag and hepatitis C Ab were non-
reactive. Cytomegalovirus test, Epstein Barr Virus Quantitative PCR test and Herpes Simplex Qualitative 
PCR were negative. The participant was diagnosed with  hepatitis,  most likely drug-induced liver injury 
secondary to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Treatment for the drug-induced liver injury included 
ondansetron, IV electrolyte solution  and sodium chloride 0.9% IV solution. The event of drug-induced 
liver injury was considered to be resolved on day 30.  The investigator assessed the event of drug-induced 
liver injury to be not related to the IP. The second dose on Day 29 was not administered per Sponsor 
recommendation and physician decision to discontinue the  participant from IP. The participant was 
discontinued from the study and IP on day 42. 
The case of appendicitis together with diarrhoea, vomiting, and post-procedural fever occurred in a study 
participant who received the first two  doses of 100 μg mRNA-1273  30 days apart. Three days after the 
first dose, the participant experienced a grade 3 severe SAE of appendicitis and underwent a laparoscopic 
appendectomy. The participant was discharged from the hospital on day 5. The event of appendicitis was 
considered to be resolved on day 4. The investigator assessed the event of appendicitis not  to be related 
to the IP. 
At the time of data snapshot SAEs were reported by 0.2% of subjects each in the MRNA-1273  vaccine 
group (6 subjects) and the placebo group (2 subjects). SAEs in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group beside the 
2 events of drug-induced liver injury and appendicitis together with  diarrhoea, vomiting, and post-
procedural fever were pectus excavatum, suicidal ideation (2 subjects, none in  the placebo group), and 
depression suicidal (1 subject, none in the placebo group). In the placebo group one suicide attempt  and 
one case of obstructive nephropathy were recorded as SAE by one subject each. 
None of the SAEs reported at the time of data snapshot were considered being vaccine related. 
SAEs considered being vaccine related 
No SAEs being considered vaccine related were reported at  the time of data snapshot.

Deaths 
At the time of the data snapshot (08  May 2021),  no SAEs with  fatal outcome or deaths were reported.  
AESI 
Multisystem  Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was defined as AESI in this  trial. No cases were 
reported at the  time of data snapshot. 
Myocarditis 
No cases of myocarditis have been reported at the time  of data snapshot. 
Three subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group reported symptoms that  could be consistent  with 
myocarditis or pericarditis. 
1.)  The first case is a study participant who, on the day after the second dose of mRNA 1273 at 
07:00,  experienced a Grade 2 non-serious MAAE of Palpitations (verbatim: intermittent  tachy-
palpitations).  The participant  also experienced the Grade 2 non-serious MAAEs of wheezing with 
onset on the same day at 09:00 and the Grade 2  non-serious MAAE of Non-cardiac chest pain 
with  onset on the very same day. Other relevant unsolicited adverse events reported near the 
time of event onset included a Grade 1 non-serious TEAE of Viral infection with  onset 16 days 
before the second dose and resolution 2 days before the second dose. The event of palpitations 
was considered resolved on day 2, the event of non-cardiac chest pain and the event of wheezing 
were considered resolved on day 3. The CHMP  considered that the symptoms are in general 
consistent with  myocarditis or pericarditis. However, the AE of palpitations resolved within  1 day 
and the AEs of wheezing and non-cardiac chest pain resolved within  3 days, which  makes this 
diagnose rather unlikely. An inclusion of the singular events of wheezing, palpitation,  and non-
cardiac chest pain as AEs into  the SmPC is currently not  supported.  
2.)  A study participant without  any medication and medical history, reported an event of Grade 2 non 
serious MAAE of painful respiration (chest pain with  painful respirations) and a Grade 2 non-
serious MAAE of dyspnoea, one day after dose 2. Additional solicited ARs post dose 2 included 
grade 1 and grade 2  headache on day 1 and 2, grade 2 and grade 3 3  fatigue on day 1 and 2, 
grade 2 myalgia on day 1 and 2, grade 1 arthralgia on day 1, and grade 1  and grade 2 chills on 
day 1,  2, and 4. The two events of painful respiration, and dyspnoea resolved the same day. Both 
events were assessed as being vaccine related by the investigator. The CHMP considered that 
relatedness of chest pain, painful breathing and dyspnoea to study vaccination cannot be 
excluded. The events resolved within  one day and are therefore not likely indicative of 
myocarditis or pericarditis. The two  events were accompanied by other grade 1 to grade 3 
solicited ARs, which  might have induced or stimulated the breathing problems. It can be 
acceptable to not  include these singular events in the SmPC for the time being.  
3.)  A study participant reported pain to the  left side of the chest with  deep inspiration  and position 
changes 4 days after dose 2 of mRNA-1273. The event was diagnosed and classified as Grade 2 
non-serious MAAE of costochondritis. The subject went to the ER and had a chest x-ray and an 
electrocardiogram 5 days after dose 2. Both examinations without  findings.  Solicited systemic 
adverse reactions reported after dose 2 included Grade 1 fatigue and Grade 1 arthralgia on Day 
3. Solicited local adverse reactions after dose 2 included Grade 1 to  Grade 2 injection site pain on 
Day 1 to Day 3  and Grade 2 to  Grade 3 injection site swelling on Day 1 to Day 2. The event was 
ongoing at the time of data snapshot. The event of costochondritis was assessed as not being 
vaccine related by the investigator. The CHMP noted that  the symptoms leading to the diagnosis 
of osteochondritis are rather unspecific. The event was ongoing at the time  of data snapshot. 
Without  follow up information and based on the limited  clinical information a final conclusion is

EMA/439844/2021 
Page 73/88 
 
 
 
 
not possible. Myocarditis/pericarditis appears unlikely as the ECG and x-ray did not reveal any 
findings. 
Overall  comment on myocarditis/pericarditis: 
The issue of myocarditis after vaccination with  COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was first flagged by Israel 
health officials, when during the COVID-19 vaccine campaign in Israel a more than expected number of 
myocarditis cases occurred. The cases were mostly reported in  young men who had received their second 
dose of vaccine a few days earlier. Following  PRAC evaluation of the safety signal of 
myocarditis/pericarditis these two events have been included into  the SmPC section 4.8. in the  SOC: 
“Cardiac disorders” with  frequency “unknown. For 3  presented cases with  symptoms indicative of 
myocarditis clinical medical information is limited.  A diagnosis of myocarditis/pericarditis based on the 
information provided in the narratives however is considered unlikely. For the singular events of 
palpitation,  non-cardiac chest pain, wheezing, painful breathing, painful respiration, and dyspnoea it  is 
difficult  to establish a causal association. The events were accompanied by solicited ARs and might  be 
indicative of the  general reactogenicity of the mRNA-1273  vaccine. It is deemed acceptable to not include 
them into  the SmPC so far.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory safety analyses were not carried out. 
Safety in special populations 
The population of the trial included healthy adolescents 12 to 18  years of age. Individuals with  a HIV 
infection or individuals under immunosuppressants or immune-modifying medication for more than  14 
days in total  within  6 months prior to the day of enrolment were not  allowed to  participate. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction study has been performed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Until  data lock point,  three subjects discontinued due to AEs, all of them were from the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group. None of the AEs leading to discontinuation  is considered being vaccine related. No  subject 
in the placebo group discontinued due to an AE. 
One participant in the mRNA-1273  group discontinued from study vaccine due to a grade 1 MAAE of 
COVID-19 that  began on Day 10  day after dose 1 of mRNA-1273. 
One study participant in the mRNA-1273  group discontinued the study 4 days after dose 2 due to a MAAE 
of grade 2 right eye swelling.  In addition a study participant did not receive dose 2 of mRNA-1273 and 
was discontinued from the  study vaccine per physician decision and discussion with the  Sponsor, 
following a grade 3 serious MAAE of drug-induced liver injury. Details about the case of liver injury are 
discussed in the  serious adverse event section.

Post-marketing experience 
The MAH has not submitted  a summary of safety data after approval. mRNA-1273  received a Conditional 
Marketing Authorisation in the EU  on 6th of January 2021 under the invented name COVID
Moderna for individuals of 18 years of age and older. The vaccine has moreover been authorised for 
19 Vaccine 
‑
emergency use in 15  other countries or regions (including  WHO authorisation). Since the approval, the 
vaccine has been used extensively. Safety data updates are summarised in the EMA Monthly  Summary 
Safety Reports (MSSRs). As of 31 May 2021, a total  of 155,522,108  doses of the vaccine had been 
administered (5th EMA  MSSR). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data base: 
In this trial, subjects were randomised in a 2:1  randomisation ratio to receive either mRNA-1273 or 
placebo. Therefore, the two  groups were not  balanced with  regard to the sample size, which  is deemed 
acceptable. The overall sample size of the  Safety Set included 3,726  subjects. 2,486  subjects received at 
least one dose of mRNA-1273  vaccine, and 1,240  received at least one dose of placebo. The majority of 
subjects belonged to the  younger age cohort 12 to 16  years of age. The number of subjects included into 
the ≥12  to <16 years of age cohort was approximately 3-fold higher than  the number of subjects in the 
older age cohort ≥16 to <18  years. In the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group 1,838  subjects belonged to the age 
range of ≥12  and <16  years of age and 648 subjects to the age range ≥16 and <18  years. In the placebo 
group, the sample size in the two  age cohorts was 929 and 311 subjects, respectively. 
The solicited safety set includes almost the same sample size like the  safety set, i.e. overall 2,485 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (1,838  in the age cohort ≥12 to <16  years of age and 647 ≥16 
to <18  years of age), and 1,240 in the  placebo group (929 subjects in the younger and 311  in the older 
age cohort). 
The safety data base is deemed acceptable. 
Exposure to vaccine: 
Data cut-off date is 08 May 2021. As of 08 May 2021 (data snapshot date), 2,486  of 2,489 randomised 
participants (99.9%)  in the mRNA-1273  group and 1,240  of 1,243  randomised (99.8%) in  the placebo 
group received dose 1, and 2,480 (99.6%)  in the mRNA-1273  group and 1,222 (98.3%)  in the placebo 
group received dose 2, respectively. 
The median follow-up duration  post dose 2 was 53 days for vaccine recipients and 51  days for placebo 
recipients at the data snapshot on 08 May 2021. Follow  up period in  the Safety Set of the  mRNA-1273 
vaccine group was comparable between the 2 age cohorts ≥12  and <16 years and ≥16 and <18  years. In 
the Safety Set of the mRNA-1273  group, 43.6%  of subjects ≥12  to <16  years of age and 44.1%  of 
subjects ≥16 to <18  years had a follow-up period of more than 56 days after dose 2.  54.9% (1,366)  of 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  group had a follow-up between ≥28 and <56  days after dose 2. All subjects 
except of 12 in the  mRNA vaccine group had a follow-up time of 7 days after dose 2 (99.5%). 
Dropout rate was low in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group (overall 2.3% of subjects), but notably higher in 
the placebo group (overall 15.1%,  respectively, because of the increasing availability of authorised 
mRNA-COVID-19 vaccines. Mainly adolescents between 16  to 18 years of age requested early unblinding. 
This was confirmed by the sponsor. 
No subject in the vaccine group discontinued due to a vaccine related AE.

Demography: 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of the safety set are balanced between the mRNA-1273 group 
and the placebo group in the older and the younger age cohort. The majority of subjects was enrolled in 
the younger age cohort ≥12 to 16  years of age (74.3%  of subjects). 83.9% of subjects were white. 
48.6%  of subjects were female and 51.4%  were male. The majority of subjects was seronegative for 
SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (87.0%). 
Local and systemic reactogenicity: 
The incidence of solicited local and systemic ARs was as it  can be expected higher in the mRNA-1273 
group compared with the  placebo group. The mRNA-1273  vaccine is reactogenic. Any solicited local AR 
after any dose was recorded for 97.8%  of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group (2,431/2,485)  and 
for 48.5% of subjects (602/1,240)  in the placebo group. The most frequently reported local solicited AR 
in the mRNA-1273  and the placebo group after any dose was injection site pain reported by 97.2%  of 
subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and by 45.9% of subjects in the placebo group. This was 
followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (34.6%  versus 10.7%),  swelling (27.7% versus 1.9%),  and 
erythema/redness (25.8% versus 1.5%). 
The incidence of any solicited systemic AR after any dose was 91.9%  in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group 
(2,284/2,485  subjects), and 66.9%  of subjects in the  placebo group (830/1,240  subjects). The most 
frequently reported systemic solicited AR in the mRNA-1273 group after any dose was headache reported 
by 78.4% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and by 50.3% of subjects in the placebo group. 
This was followed by fatigue (75.2%  versus 47.5%),  myalgia (54.3% versus 23.5%),  chills (49.1% 
versus 16.2%),  arthralgia (34.6  versus 16.9%),  and nausea (29.3%  versus 15.2%). Fever of any grade 
was reported by 13.7% versus 1.9%  of subjects. 
The majority of solicited local ARs occurred within  the first 1 to 2 days after any dose and persisted for a 
median of 3 days. The majority of systemic ARs had an onset within  the first 2 days and a median 
duration of 2 days. 
Though the majority of solicited ARs (local and systemic) was mild to  moderate it should be noted, that 
after any dose in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 13.8%  of subjects reported grade 3 solicited local and 
16,5%  solicited systemic ARs. The severity of local and systemic reactogenicity increased from dose 1 to 
dose 2.  Any grade 3 local solicited AE was reported by 6.8%  versus 8.9% of subjects after any dose. Any 
grade 3 systemic solicited AE by 4.4% and 13.7%,  respectively. The relatively high  incidence of grade 3 
events after the second injection was mainly caused by fatigue (7.6%),  myalgia (5.2%),  and headache 
(4.5%).  Grade 3 fever occurred in 1.9% of the vaccinated participants after the second injection. Of note, 
some of the vaccinees reported more than  one of these events at the  same time, which is the reason why 
the sum of the individual incidences does not fit the  total incidence of 13.7%.  There were three grade 4 
events in  the mRNA-1273 group (1x fever [>40°C], 1x headache, 1x nausea/vomiting). 
Reactogenicity by dose: 
For solicited local reactions no clear trend could be observed regarding differences in severity post dose 1 
and post dose 2. The incidence of solicited systemic ARs however was notably higher post  dose 2 
compared to post dose 1, i.e. depending on the kind of event approximately 2 to  3 fold higher after dose 
2 than after dose 1. 
By age: 
Local and systemic reactogenicity was generally comparable in the 2 age cohorts included in the  trial with 
regard to frequency and severity. It must be taken into account that  the sample size in the younger age 
cohort was 3-fold higher than  the sample size in the older age cohort.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 76/88 
 
 
 
 
Data on solicited systemic and local ARs in  the age cohort 18 to  25 years of age from study P301 
suggested a higher local reactogenicity for all solicited local ARs except for pain in the age cohort 12 to 
<18 years compared with  the age cohort 18  to 25 years of age. The incidence of systemic solicited ARs 
tended to be comparable or slightly higher in the  age cohort 18 to 25  years of age compared with  the age 
cohort 12 to <18  years of age. The incidence of grade 3 systemic ARs is lower for adolescents (4.4% 
dose 1,  13.7% dose 2), compared to young adults (5.2% dose 1, 21.6%  dose 2). In contrast, the 
incidence of grade 3  local ARs tends  to be slightly  higher for adolescents (6.8%  dose 1, 8.9%  dose 2), 
compared to young adults (5.9%  dose 1, 7.7%  dose 2). It should be noted, that  the sample size in the 
age cohort 12  to <18 years was 3 fold higher than  in the age cohort 18  to 25 years of age. 
No dose finding studies were performed for the younger age group below 25 years of age. The paediatric 
dose is the same as for adults. It cannot be excluded, that  a lower dose with lower reactogenicity could 
induce a non-inferior immune response and protection. 
By SARS-CoV-2 serostatus: 
The incidence of solicited local and systemic ARs after any dose was, except for fever (13.0%  versus 
25.9%  in seronegative and seropositive subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group) in  general comparable 
in subjects seropositive and seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. No notable difference with regard 
to severity of ARs could be observed. There is an imbalance with regard to  the sample size of 
seronegative and seropositive subjects in the mRNA-1273  and the placebo group. The huge majority of 
subjects in the solicited safety set of the mRNA-1273  vaccine group was seronegative (2167  subjects). 
Only 147 subjects were seropositive. This needs to  be taken into account when comparing reactogenicity 
data in the subgroups of seropositive and seronegative subjects. 
By sex: 
The solicited safety set was rather balanced with  regard to  sex. Local reactogenicity was comparable 
between males and females with  regard to frequency and severity. Systemic ARs tended to be 
numerically slightly higher in female compared with male subjects but  were overall within  the same 
range. The same was observed for grade 3  and more systemic ARs that  tended to be slightly higher in 
females, but  were overall also within  the  same range compared to males. In general, no clinical 
meaningful difference is observed with regard to reactogenicity of mRNA-1273  between females and 
males. 
Use of pain medication: 
The high reactogenicity of the mRNA-1273  vaccine is reflected in the use of antipyretic and pain 
medication. The use of antipyretic or pain medication was notably higher in the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group compared with the  placebo group. In the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group, 30.1%  of subjects used such 
medication after dose 1 and 50.1% after dose 2. The proportion was 9.5% and 8.9% in  the placebo 
group, respectively. Also the severity particularly for systemic AEs increased from post dose 1 to post 
dose 2. 
Unsolicited AEs: 
The incidence of unsolicited adverse events irrespective of causality was higher in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group compared with the  placebo group. Unsolicited TEAEs irrespective of causality up to 28 days 
after any dose were reported by 20.5% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  group (510/2,486  subjects) 
compared to 15.9%  of participants  in the placebo group (197/1,240  subjects). The most commonly 
recorded unsolicited TEAEs with  a frequency of more than 1% occurred in  the SOC General disorders and 
administration site conditions,  reported by 10.1%  of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and by 
4.0% of subjects in the placebo group. This included events of injection site lymphadenopathy (4.3% 
versus 0.4%),  injection site erythema (1.9% versus 0.2%),  fatigue (1.9%  each), injection site induration 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 77/88 
 
 
 
 
(1.1%  versus 0.2%), and injection site pain (1.1  versus 0.6%). Severe unsolicited AEs were reported by 
0.2% of subjects (4/2,486)  in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and by <0.1%  (1 subject) in the placebo 
group. The severe unsolicited AEs in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group were one event each of appendicitis, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, drug-induced liver injury, testicular torsion, and concussion in  a total  of 4 
participants. None of the severe unsolicited AEs that  occurred in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group were 
considered being vaccine related. 
Metabolic, endocrine and autoimmune disorders: 
Two cases of prediabetic diagnose were reported in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group. Both 
subjects in the vaccine group had additional risk factors (both overweight/obesity, one subject is of 
Hispanic origin). 
Two cases of hypothyroidism were reported in the vaccine group and none in the  placebo group. Only 
very limited clinical information is available. The cases of hypothyroidism were diagnosed on day 3 and 
day 23  post dose 2 in one male and one female subject. It is unclear whether the  cases are caused by 
autoimmune thyroiditis. From the  two cases no conclusion on vaccine relatedness can be drawn.  
There was one event of treatment-related chilblains in the vaccine group. Of note, the event of chilblains 
has been associated with  (often otherwise asymptomatic) COVID-19 infection and was also referred to as 
“COVID toe” (https://doi.org/10.1053/j.seminoncol.2020.05.012,  DOI: 10.1111/jdv.16753).  According to 
the narratives for this event (verbatim worsening pernio, right  foot), the subject had a history of 
acrocyanosis (since April 2020), chronic chilblains (since March 2020), coagulation disorders (FV and FVII 
deficiency, since June 2020) and chronic toe infections prior to receipt of mRNA-1273. Therefore, it is 
agreed with  the MAH  that a causal association with  vaccination is improbable at the  time being. 
Psychiatric disorders 
There was an imbalance for the SOC of Psychiatric Disorders (vaccine: 0.7%,  placebo: 0.5%).  However, 
the only event that  was considered treatment-related (and also related to the study procedure itself) by 
the Investigator was the  AE of tic (verbatim Worsening of Motor  Tic). The subject had a history of motor 
tics since 2019. No  action was taken with  study vaccine due to MAAE of tic and no concomitant treatment 
was given for the event of tic. 
Vaccine related unsolicited  AEs: 
Unsolicited TEAEs considered being vaccine related were recorded by 12.6% of subjects in the mRNA-
1273  vaccine group (312/2,486)  and by 5.8%  of subjects (72/1,240)  in  the placebo group. Most 
frequently TEAEs considered being vaccine related were reported in the SOC of General disorders and 
administration site conditions  (9.6% of subjects [238/2,486]  in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and 3.5% 
in the placebo group [43/1,240]),  followed by the SOC of Nervous system disorders (2.4%  [59/2,486) 
versus 1.8% [22/1,240]).  TEAEs considered being vaccine related and reported by ≥ 2% of participants 
in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group through 28 days after any dose were injection site lymphadenopathy 
reported by 4.3% (108/2,486)  of subjects and headache reported by 2.2% (55/2,486)  of subjects. 
Lymphadenopathy (not  restricted to  injection site) considered being vaccine related was reported by 
0.6% of subjects (16/2,486). 
Not  all AEs considered being vaccine related are yet listed in  section 4.8 of the SmPC for the adolescent 
population, but  some of them already for the adult  population. The CHMP decided that a single table for 
all ages is appropriate, i.e. all AEs from the paediatric population not listed  yet in  the “adult” table should 
be included in the existing table, with  correct frequency. 
The following AEs should be reflected based on data from the paediatric population: 
• 
Type IV hypersensitivity reactions/delayed injection site reaction: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 78/88 
 
 
 
 
The three unsolicited  AEs of type IV hypersensitivity reactions in the 3 subjects were all events of delayed 
cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions with  onset on Day 8 to 11  after the first  dose of mRNA-1273. 
Because of the  timing being consistent with  reports of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, the 
events of type IV hypersensitivity reactions are considered most probably vaccine associated. A separate 
variation is already under discussion to  update the product information regarding delayed injection site 
reactions. It  is therefore decided to include delayed injection site reactions as an AR in the  SmPC. 
•  Dizziness: 
3 cases of dizziness are considered being vaccine related by the  investigator. The onset was on day 2, 1, 
and 10. A biological plausibility  for dizziness being vaccine related is given. A causal relationship between 
vaccination with mRNA-1273  and the adverse event of dizziness is at least a reasonable possibility. The 
event of dizziness is therefore included into section 4.8 of the SmPC with  a frequency uncommon. 
•  Urticaria/Hypersensitivity:  
Four subjects (0.2%)  in the mRNA-1273 group and 1 subject (<0.1%)  in the placebo group had at least 
one unsolicited treatment-related TEAE of urticaria up to 28 days after any injection. The 4 events in the 
mRNA-1273  vaccine group occurred on day 1,4,11,  and 21 after vaccination and were either generalised 
(one case) or restricted to parts of the body (feet and elbows, groin, left deltoid, back and right  leg). All 4 
events were assessed as being vaccine related by the investigator. The assessment is supported. The 
events are suggestive of a hypersensitivity response. The event of hypersensitivity is covered in the 
SmPC, but  only for adult subjects. During licensure of mRNA-1273 it  was agreed to summarise all events 
indicative of hypersensitivity under the  PT “hypersensitivity” and not to list  them separately (leading to 
the frequency calculation “unknown”).   
•  Hypoaesthesia: 
There was one event of treatment-related hypoaesthesia (bilateral arm numbness, grade 2, onset on day 
5 after first vaccination, still  ongoing). Already in the adult trial  an imbalance for treatment-related events 
of hypoaesthesia was observed (vaccine: 4 events, placebo: no event). This AE is therefore included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC with  a frequency rare. 
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders: 
There were 16 treatment-related events of lymphadenopathy in the vaccine group, compared to none in 
the placebo group. Lymphadenopathy, which was captured as a solicited event (axillary lymphadenopathy 
on the same side of the injection site) is already included in the SmPC with  the frequency of “very 
common”. However, there were also some cases of lymph nodes swellings at other sites (e.g. cervical or 
supraclavicular) in both the adolescent and adult studies. Therefore, a small amendment of the  legend of 
the table in section 4.8  is implemented. 
SAEs: 
At the time of data snapshot SAEs were reported by 0.2% of subjects each in the MRNA-1273  vaccine 
group (6 subjects) and the placebo group (2 subjects). SAEs in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group included 
drug-induced liver injury, appendicitis together with  diarrhoea, vomiting, and post-procedural fever, 
pectus excavatum, suicidal ideation (2 subjects, none in  the placebo group), and depression suicidal (1 
subject, none in the placebo group). In the placebo group one suicide attempt  and one case of 
obstructive nephropathy were recorded as SAE by one subject each. 
None of the SAEs reported at the time of data snapshot were considered being vaccine related. 
AESI: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 79/88 
 
 
 
 
Multisystem  Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was defined as AESI in this  trial. No cases were 
reported at the  time of data snapshot. 
Myocarditis/pericarditis: 
The issue of myocarditis after vaccination with  COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was first flagged by Israel 
health officials, when during the COVID-19 vaccine campaign in Israel a more than expected number of 
myocarditis cases occurred. The cases were mostly reported in  young men who had received their second 
dose of vaccine a few days earlier. On 09 July 2021,  the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) concluded to recommend listing  myocarditis and pericarditis as a side effect in the product 
information of both currently authorised mRNA vaccines, due to the occurrence of very rare cases in the 
post-marketing phase. The two events have been included into  the SmPC section 4.8 in  the SOC “Cardiac 
disorders” with  a frequency “unknown”. No cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in this trial. 
Unsolicited AEs from this  trial do not reveal clinical signs of immune thrombocytopenia, an AE under close 
monitoring in the  context of the  Periodic Safety Update Reports. Safety lab was not performed in this 
trial. In the COVID-19 vaccine safety update report for Spikevax from 14th of July 2021,  nine cases were 
considered possibly related to the vaccine. No clear causal relationship could be established in any of 
these cases. 
The sample size of the trial  is overall not sufficient to evaluate rare or very rare events like e.g. 
autoimmune disorders. The trial was restricted to healthy adolescents. No safety data are available for 
adolescents with  underlying chronic medical conditions and immune suppression. In the Safety Set of the 
mRNA-1273  group, only 43.6%  of subjects ≥12 to  <16 years of age and 44.1%  of subjects ≥16 to  <18 
years had a follow-up period of more than 56 days after dose 2. Long-term safety data are not  available 
yet. The study period of this trial will  be 1 year. 
The following AEs should be added in the SmPC: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Delayed injection site reactions 
Dizziness 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypoaesthesia 
A single AE table should be used for all age groups. Hypersensitivity and injection site urticarial are 
already covered in table 1 in  section 4.8  of the SmPC. Dizziness, hypoaesthesia, and delayed injection 
site reactions must  be added with  corresponding frequency. For hypersensitivity the frequency is listed as 
unknown, due to a decision made during licensure (inclusion of all AEs indicative of hypersensitivity, e.g. 
urticaria, instead of separate listing). 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P203  will be submitted no later than September 2022 
and is subject to a specific obligation laid down in the marketing authorisation, in order to provide long-
term safety data in adolescents 12-17 years of age. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
This type II variation aims to extend the indication  to include adolescents aged 12  to <18 years of age for 
Spikevax. The database for evaluation of the safety profile of mRNA-1273 in the  paediatric population 12 
to <18  years of age derives from an ongoing Phase 2/3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.  Route of 
administration, dose and schedule were the  same as for the adults, i.e. 100  μg IM, given as 2 injections, 
28 days apart. Safety data are available from 3,726  subjects recruited in the US, of whom 2,486  were 
exposed to the Spikevax vaccine and 1,240  who received saline placebo. The median follow-up duration 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 80/88 
 
 
 
 
post dose 2  was 53  days for vaccine recipients and 51 days for placebo recipients at the data snapshot on 
08 May 2021.  Spikevax (mRNA-1273) is reactogenic in the paediatric population and the observed rates 
of adverse reactions were higher in comparison to adults, which  is not unexpected. The low incidence of 
severe cases of COVID-19 in the  healthy paediatric population must be taken into account here. The 
reactogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine is however not clinically meaningful different from that in 
the adult  subpopulation 18 to 25  years of age. Study P203  confirmed the previous finding that  the 
majority of solicited ARs are mild or moderate in severity and occur within  the first 1 to 2 days after IP 
injection. The individual adverse reactions persisted for a median of 1 to 3 days. 
There was an imbalance regarding the  number of subjects reporting unsolicited  AEs up to 28  days after 
any vaccination. The difference was mainly caused by injections site reactions (e.g. injection site 
lymphadenopathy, injection site erythema) persisting beyond day 7 after vaccination. There was no 
difference regarding the incidence of MAAEs between the vaccine and the placebo group. 
Some amendments of section 4.8  of the  SmPC are considered necessary, mainly based on imbalances for 
some particular AEs (dizziness, hypoaesthesia). The study was restricted to  healthy paediatric individuals. 
No conclusion on the safety profile in individuals with  comorbidities or under immunosuppression who 
have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 can be drawn. Only 2 SAEs were reported in the  mRNA-1273 
vaccine group none of them considered being vaccine related. No cases of myocarditis or pericarditis and 
no case of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children or immune thrombocytopenia were reported. 
The sample size of note is not  sufficient to detect rare or very rare AEs. The observed safety profile is 
considered favourable within  the context of a conditional marketing authorisation. The benefit-risk ratio of 
mRNA-1273  in this age group is considered positive. 
The CHMP considers the  following measure (SOB)  necessary to address the missing safety data  
• 
The final clinical study report for study mRNA-1273-P203  including the full bioanalytical report will 
be submitted no later than September 2022  and is subject to  a specific obligation laid down in the 
marketing authorisation.  This will provide long-term data.  
In addition, the following  recommendation (REC) is made: 
•  Since no dose finding trial in this  population has been conducted it  is not  possible to conclude 
whether lower dose could have resulted in a lower reactogenicity with  comparable immune 
response and efficacy. The MAH  should further explore lower dose levels in  adolescents 12-17 
years of age given the  high reactogenicity of Spikevax and the usually mild course of infection 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in this age group.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list  of Union  reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7)  of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH did not  submit an updated RMP version with  this application. The Spikevax RMP will  be updated 
in line with  the conclusions of this  assessment in the context of a separate, subsequent procedure. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication,  sections 4.1,  4.2, 4.8  and 5.1  of the SmPC and Annex II.E are 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification  for not  performing a full  user consultation  with target patient  groups on the  package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH.  However, the  changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with  target patient  groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). COVID-19 is primarily recognised as a febrile respiratory illness. While the majority of cases 
subsides without  specific treatment in a subgroup of patients the disease progresses to severe disease 
characterised by oxygen requirement. Still fewer patients  progress to critical disease with respiratory 
failure, ARDS, multiorgan failure and/or thromboembolic complications. Age is the major risk factor for 
severe COVID-19 and death, other described risk factors are obesity, pre-existent diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, lung disease, immuno-deficiency and pregnancy. COVID-19 can be considered 
confirmed by the existence of above clinical signs and proof of the presence of the virus e.g. by NAAT. 
In adolescents SARS-CoV-2 infections cause mostly asymptomatic or mild disease. Severe COVID-19 
cases occur rarely, and predominantly in subjects with  comorbidities.  
The MAH is seeking an extension of the  indication for Spikevax in adolescents from 12  to less than  18 
years. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with  clinical experience gained over time, there 
remains an urgent and unmet need for a vaccine able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 during the 
ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of particularly vulnerable groups and mitigating  the effects of the 
pandemic on a population level are desired. Although one vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 in 
adolescents is available there is still a need for additional vaccines to meet demand. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This submission is based on one clinical trial conducted in adolescents.  
Study P203 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, randomised (2:1),  observer-blind, placebo-controlled study that 
evaluates the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of Spikevax in healthy adolescents aged 
≥ 12 to  < 18 years.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/439844/2021 
Page 82/88 
 
 
 
 
Vaccine efficacy is inferred based on demonstrating non-inferiority of the geometric mean value of serum 
Ab and the  seroresponse rate from adolescent participants compared with  those obtained from young 
adults (≥ 18  to ≤ 25 years of age) enrolled in the ongoing adult study (Study P301).  Additionally, 
secondary study endpoints assessed the effect of Spikevax on COVID-19 and asymptomatic infection. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies it  has been demonstrated that  neutralising antibodies play a crucial 
role in  preventing COVID-19. Spikevax was shown to  elicit non-inferior neutralising  antibody levels and 
seroresponse rates in subjects 12-17  years of age without  previous SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to 
young adults 18-25  years. Based on these immunobridging results efficacy can be inferred for 
adolescents.  
In addition, vaccine efficacy (exploratory) against prevention of COVID-19 was also evaluated. The 
vaccine efficacy results indicate that in SARS-CoV-2 baseline negative adolescents from 12  to <18 years 
Spikevax is efficacious in preventing laboratory confirmed symptomatic infection although only a low 
number of cases were observed using the  same stringent case definition as in  the pivotal study P301 in 
adults. A VE of 100.0%  (95%  CI: 28.9%,  NE)  was estimated. Using  the less stringent  CDC definition 
amended to reflect the clinical course in adolescents a VE of 93.3% (95%  CI: 47.9%,  99.9%)  is 
estimated starting 14  days post dose 2 with  1 case reported in the vaccine group and 7 cases observed in 
the placebo group with  a mean follow-up of 53 days.  
Overall, the vaccine efficacy results in the adolescent population  are consistent with  the vaccine efficacy 
reported in older age groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No data are available from adolescents with  a risk of more severe disease, including those with 
comorbidities such as diabetes or those under immune suppressive therapy. A study in 
immunocompromised children is however included in  the PIP.  
It is also currently unknown how long protection will  last in adolescents and adults and if vaccination 
provides protection against newly emerging variants (REC). The impact on transmission is also currently 
unknown. 
In addition, no (immune) correlate of protection has been identified to date. 
Finally, the  efficacy analyses are hampered by very low case counts. 
As the study is ongoing, results were not provided for all endpoints. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The evaluation of solicited ARs was performed in the Solicited Safety Set that consisted of randomised 
participants who received at least one injection of the vaccine and contributed  any solicited adverse 
reaction data. The evaluation of unsolicited  AEs, SAEs, and AESIs was conducted in the  Safety Set 
including all randomised participants  who received at least 1 dose. As of 08 May 2021  (data cut-off date) 
in the Safety Set population  2,480 participants of the mRNA-1273  group (99.8%) and 1,222  of the 
placebo group (98.5%)  had received 2 vaccinations. In the  Solicited Safety Set population  the numbers 
were 2,478  (99.7%)  and 1,220 (98.4%)  participants, respectively. In the Safety Set 1087  subjects in the 
mRNA-1273  group and 474  in the placebo group had a follow-up  time-period of ≥56 days post dose 2.

Spikevax is reactogenic. Almost all subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group (97.8%)  reported any 
solicited local AR compared to 48.5%  of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported local 
solicited AR in  the mRNA-1273 was injection site pain reported by 97.2%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group and by 45.9%  of subjects in the  placebo group. Any grade 3 solicited local AR after any 
dose was recorded for 13.8%  of subjects in  the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and for 0.3%  in the placebo 
group. This was followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (34.6% versus 10.7%),  swelling (27.7% 
versus 1.9%),  and erythema/redness (25.8% versus 1.5%).  Any solicited systemic AR after any dose was 
recorded for 91.9%  of subjects in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group and for 66.9%  of subjects in the  placebo 
group. The most frequently reported systemic solicited AR in the mRNA-1273  group after any dose was 
headache reported by 78.4% of subjects in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group and by 50.3%  of subjects in 
the placebo group. This was followed by fatigue (75.2%  versus 47.5%),  myalgia (54.3%  versus 23.5%), 
chills (49.1%  versus 16.2%),  arthralgia (34.6  versus 16.9%), and nausea (29.3% versus 15.2%).  Fever 
of any grade was reported by 13.7%  versus 1.9% of subjects. For solicited local reactions no clear trend 
could be observed regarding differences in severity post dose 1  and post  dose 2. The incidence of 
solicited systemic ARs however was notably higher post dose 2  compared to post dose 1 (depending on 
the kind of event approximately 2 to 3-fold higher).  
Study P203 confirmed the  previous finding that  the majority of solicited ARs are mild or moderate in 
severity, occur within  the  first 1 to 2 days after IP injection and persist for a median of 1 to 3 days, 
depending on the type of the  reaction. It should be noted, that  after any dose in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group 13.8% of subjects reported grade 3 solicited local and 16.5% solicited systemic ARs. Because of 
the higher systemic reactogenicity the use of antipyretic or pain medication was notably higher in the 
mRNA-1273  vaccine group compared with  the placebo group. In the mRNA-1273  vaccine group, 30.1% of 
subjects used such medication after dose 1 and 50.1%  after dose 2.  The proportion was 9.5% and 8.9% 
in the placebo group, respectively. The severity of local and systemic reactogenicity increased from dose 
1 to dose 2. Any grade 3 local solicited AE was reported by 6.8% versus 8.9% of subjects after each 
dose; any grade 3 systemic solicited AE by 4.4% and 13.7%,  respectively. 
A comparison with reactogenicity data from the age cohort 18 to 25 years from study P301 indicated a 
higher local reactogenicity for all solicited local ARs except for pain in the age cohort 12  to <18 years 
compared with  the age cohort 18 to  25 years of age. No clinical meaningful difference could be observed 
for solicited systemic ARs. The incidence tended to  be comparable or slightly higher in the age cohort 18 
to 25 years of age compared with  the age cohort 12  to <18 years of age. Interestingly, a comparison 
between adolescents and young adults suggests that the incidence of severe (grade 3) systemic ARs is 
lower for adolescents (4.4%  dose 1, 13.7%  dose 2),  compared to young adults  (5.2% dose 1, 21.6% 
dose 2).  Results must be interpreted with  caution since the sample size in the age cohort 12  to <18 years 
was 3-fold higher than in the age cohort 18 to 25 years of age and it  is a historical control group.  
The incidence of unsolicited TEAEs was higher in the  mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with  the 
placebo group. Unsolicited TEAEs irrespective of causality up to 28 days after any dose were reported by 
20.5%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273  group compared to 15.9% of participants in the  placebo group. The 
most commonly recorded unsolicited TEAEs with  a frequency of more than 1%  occurred in the SOC 
General disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 10.1%  of subjects in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group and by 4.0%  of subjects in the placebo group. This included events of injection site 
lymphadenopathy (4.3%  versus 0.4%), injection site erythema (1.9% versus 0.2%),  fatigue (1.9% 
each), injection site induration (1.1%  versus 0.2%), and injection site pain (1.1  versus 0.6%). 
The incidence of MAAEs until  the data cut (08 May 2021)  was nearly identical between the groups 
(mRNA-1273:  8.2%, placebo: 8.4%). 
Unsolicited TEAEs considered being vaccine related were recorded by 12.6% of subjects in the mRNA-
1273  vaccine group and by 5.8% of subjects in the placebo group. Most  frequently TEAEs considered

being vaccine related were reported in the SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions 
(9.6%  versus 3.5%), followed by the  SOC of Nervous system disorders (2.4% versus 1.8%). 
TEAEs considered being vaccine related and reported by ≥ 2% of participants in the mRNA-1273  vaccine 
group through 28 days after any dose were injection site  lymphadenopathy reported by 4.3% of subjects 
and headache reported by 2.2%. Lymphadenopathy (not restricted to injection site) considered being 
vaccine related was reported by 0.6%  of subjects. 
At the time of data snapshot SAEs were reported by 0.2% of subjects each in the MRNA-1273  vaccine 
group (6 subjects) and the placebo group (2 subjects). SAEs in the mRNA-1273  vaccine group included 
drug-induced liver injury, appendicitis together with  diarrhoea, vomiting, and post-procedural fever, 
pectus excavatum, suicidal ideation (2 subjects, none in  the placebo group), and depression suicidal (1 
subject, none in the placebo group). In the placebo group one suicide attempt  and one case of 
obstructive nephropathy were recorded as SAE by one subject each. 
None of the SAEs reported at the time of data snapshot were considered being vaccine related. 
Multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was defined as an AESI in this trial. Up  to the 
Uncertainties and limitations  about unfavourable effects 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No clinically meaningful difference was observed with  regard to incidence and severity of reactogenicity in 
subjects who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline compared with subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline. The majority of subjects however was SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline 
(87.0%).  Long-term safety data are not available yet. In the  Safety Set 1087 subjects (43.7%)  in the 
mRNA-1273  group and 474  subjects (38.2%)  in the placebo group had a follow-up time-period of ≥56 
days post dose 2. The study is ongoing and the  study period will be 1 year. 
The sample size of trial P203  is not  sufficient to evaluate rare or very rare events like e.g. Multisystem 
Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, autoimmune disorders or rare vaccine related events like 
myocarditis or pericarditis. Post-marketing reports of the very rare AEs of myocarditis/pericarditis in 
adults investigated by PRAC suggest that the  risk for myocarditis is especially increased in young male 
adults. The trial was restricted to healthy adolescents. No safety data are available for adolescents with 
underlying chronic medically conditions  and/or immune suppression. Concomitant  use of mRNA-1273  and 
any other vaccine or any other medication was not evaluated. 
Since no dose finding trial in this  population has been conducted it  is not  possible to conclude whether 
lower dose could have resulted in a lower reactogenicity with  comparable immune response and efficacy. 
Further evaluation of lower dose levels in adolescents 12-17  years of age are desirable given the high 
reactogenicity of Spikevax and the usually mild course of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 in this age 
group (REC).

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effect of vaccination is the  prevention of symptomatic disease that has 
been demonstrated for Spikevax in the pivotal trials that  were submitted  for marketing authorisation. A 
similar degree of benefit of Spikevax in adolescents 12-17  years of age can be inferred by the successful 
immunobridging approach to young adults, 18-25  years of age. A non-inferior immune response with 
respect to  neutralising antibody levels and seroresponse rates was clearly demonstrated. Clinical data

(exploratory) also show short-term protection against symptomatic COVID-19 in adolescents 12-17  years 
of age supporting the  immunobridging approach.  
Results from some of the  defined endpoints were not provided as the study is still ongoing. While this  is 
acceptable for the time being as the  relevant results supporting the immunobridging were provided, final 
study results should be submitted  as soon as available (SOB). 
Data from relevant endpoints, e.g. immunogenicity data over time, efficacy against variants, 
immunogenicity data from breakthrough cases, should be provided on a regular basis and as soon as 
(interim) results are available (REC). 
The most common and important unfavourable effects are related to  reactogenicity. Local reactogenicity 
was slightly higher, but systemic reactogenicity comparable to that  observed in the  adult population 18 to 
25 years of age that  was evaluated in a previous application. No new safety concerns were observed and 
local and systemic reactogenicity are transient  and reversible. The study size did not  allow detection  of 
rare adverse events. However, evidence transfer from adults as regards type and occurrence of rare AE is 
considered justified making the safety database considerably larger than  just this paediatric trial. 
A possible link of vaccination with  very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis has been confirmed and 
these events were included in the product information. According to investigations by PRAC, young adults 
are more often affected than older adults, which increases the relevance of these very rare events for 
adolescents. It should however be noted that  SARS-CoV-2 infection itself  can cause these events, as for 
example recently shown in a cohort study with  1597 young competitive athletes at US universities, 
revealing that  2.3% were diagnosed with  clinical (0.5%)  or subclinical myocarditis after COVID-19 
infection (doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2021.2065). 
Study P203 is not large enough to  detect new rare events or to estimate the risk of established adverse 
events such as myocarditis or pericarditis in adolescents. However, the overall safety profile determined 
in adults was confirmed in  the adolescent study and is considered favourable to support a positive 
benefit/risk. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Even though the course of COVID-19 in  adolescents is generally milder than in  the older population there 
are individuals that  suffer from direct consequences of the infection. The favourable effects of preventing 
COVID-19 with  potential irreversible and long-lasting  consequences outweigh the identified risks of 
vaccination. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Given the current emergency situation, it  is considered that the  identified uncertainties can be addressed 
post-marketing in the context of the existing conditional marketing authorisation, including the 
continuation  of the  pivotal study as long as possible, post-approval effectiveness studies and routine 
disease surveillance. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Spikevax is positive provided that the MAH  submits the  final Clinical Study 
Report for the randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study mRNA-1273-P203,  including  the full 
bioanalytical report (SOB, due date 30/09/2022).

Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The evaluation procedure started on 24 April 1998. 
The Rapporteur’s assessment report was circulated to all CPMP members on 17 June 1998. The 
Co-Rapporteur’s assessment report was circulated to all CPMP members on 19 June 1998.  
An Ad-Hoc group of Experts on hepatitis B was convened by the CPMP to address the problem 
of  the  indication  and  duration  of  treatment.  The  meeting  took  place  on  15  July  1998  and  the 
recommendations  of  the  group  were  circulated  to  all  CPMP  members  in  advance  of  the  July 
CPMP meeting.  
The draft-consolidated list of questions was circulated to all CPMP members on 17 July 1998 
for discussion at the July CPMP plenary meeting. The CPMP adopted the CPMP consolidated 
list of questions on 23 July 1998.  
The  applicant  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  list  of  questions  on  
21  September  1998  to  all  CPMP  members  and  the  evaluation  restarted  at  the  October  CPMP 
meeting. 
The  joint  Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur’s  assessment  report  on  the  responses  to  the  consolidated 
list of questions was circulated to all CPMP members on 23 November 1998.  
During its December meeting, the CPMP considered that remaining issues needed to be solved 
before  an  opinion  could  be  reached.  The  CPMP  adopted  therefore  on  17  December  1998  a 
second consolidated list of questions. 
The applicant submitted the responses to this second list on 26 January 1999 and the evaluation 
restarted at the February CPMP meeting.  
The  joint  Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur’s  assessment  report  on  the  responses  to  the  second 
consolidated list of questions was circulated to all CPMP members on 2 March 1999.  
During its March 1999 meeting, the CPMP agreed to reconvene the Ad-Hoc group of experts on 
hepatitis B to discuss the remaining outstanding issues. The meeting took place on 6 April 1999. 
During this meeting the applicant made an oral explanation in front of the group to address each 
of the remaining issues. 
During its April CPMP meeting, the CPMP considered the recommendations of the group. An 
oral explanation took place in front of the CPMP on 21 April 1999. The CPMP in the light of 
the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee issued a positive

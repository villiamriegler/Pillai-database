2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication is “the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult 
patients”.  Pyruvate  kinase  deficiency  (PKD)  is  a  glycolytic  defect  causing  congenital  non-spherocytic 
haemolytic anaemia. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
PKD exhibits autosomal recessive inheritance in nearly all cases and is widely distributed geographically. 
The frequency is not precisely defined, with a wide estimated prevalence of 3:1 000 000 to 1:20 000 
(Beutler  &  Gelbart,  2000;  Carey  et  al,  2000).  The  prevalence  is  higher  in  the  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio 
Amish community due to founder effect. The prevalence of this condition may be underestimated due to 
the lack of specific clinical features and the necessity of highly specialised testing not readily available 
at many medical institutions. 
PKD  is  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder;  thus,  the  family  history  is  typically  unrevealing,  with  the 
exception  of  miscarriages and  affected  siblings.  The  differential  diagnosis  includes  the  heterogeneous 
group of both the congenital and acquired haemolytic disorders. The haemolysis is typically exacerbated 
by acute infections, stress and pregnancy. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Pyruvate kinase converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, creating 50% of the red cell total ATP. Red 
cell  longevity  is  dependent  on  the  ATP  produced  in  glycolysis.  Thus,  PKD  leads  to  less  ATP  and  a 
shortened red cell lifespan. The red cells in PKD are variably damaged with the youngest red cells, most 
dependent  on  glycolysis  and  increased  ATP  levels,  at  highest  risk  for  destruction,  while  the  older  red 
cells  are  less  severely  affected.  Travel  through  the  splenic  capillaries  causes  damage  to  affected  red 
cells, which are variably cleared by both the spleen and liver. 
To date, more than 300 mutations in the PKLR gene have been associated with PKD. The majority of 
these, about 70–80%, are missense substitutions, such as R510Q in Northern Europe and the United 
States  and  R486W  in  Southern  Europe.  A  particularly  high  frequency  of  the  R479H  mutation  in 
homozygous  state  exists  among  the  Pennsylvania  Amish  due  to  a  founder  effect  (Rider  et  al,  2011). 
However, not all the mutations detected can be immediately classified as causative until their pathogenic 
nature is confirmed by other functional tests.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The  clinical  features  of  PKD  are  highly  variable  and  patients  with  PKD  have  a  variable  laboratory 
phenotype ranging from mild well-compensated anaemia to transfusion dependent haemolysis. The most 
frequent  symptoms  of  PKD  are  those  related  to  anaemia,  present  in  90–95%  of  cases,  from  mild  to 
transfusion  dependent  (low  Hb,  reduced  haptoglobin,  indirect  hyperbilirubinaemia,  reticulocytosis, 
hyperferritinaemia,  increased  LDH),  splenomegaly  (80–85%),  with  a  variable  degree  of  enlargement, 
Assessment report

Page 13/187 
 
 
 
jaundice  (40–70%)  and  gallstones  (30–45%).  Less common  manifestations  include  aplastic  crisis  (2–
14%),  bone  deformities  (9%),  extramedullary  erythropoiesis  (9%),  delayed  puberty  (8%), 
hyperpigmentation  (6%),  leg  ulcers  and  pulmonary  hypertension  (2–3%)  (Zanella  &  Bianchi,  2000; 
Zanella et al, 2005; Grace et al, 2015, 2018a).  
The anaemia may also be surprisingly well tolerated because of the increased red cell 2,3-DPG content, 
which  is  responsible  for  a  rightward  shift  in  the  oxygen  dissociation  curve  of  haemoglobin.  However, 
many patients with PKD report fatigue and low energy related to their anaemia, with a negative impact 
on their daily life. 
Iron overload is a common complication of PKD. It is a predictable complication of chronically transfused 
patients but is also common in patients with PKD and limited or no history of transfusions. In transfusion-
independent individuals, additional factors for iron loading include splenectomy, a degree of ineffective 
erythropoiesis,  and  co-inheritance  of  hereditary  haemochromatosis  mutations.  Transfusional 
haemosiderosis is a predictable complication of chronic transfusion therapy. 
The diagnosis of PKD is based on the presence of clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory markers of 
chronic haemolytic anaemia, 1) on reduced PK enzymatic activity, and 2) on the detection of compound 
heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the PKLR gene.  
PK enzymatic activity is usually determined in red blood cell (RBC) lysates by spectrophotometric assay. 
Importantly, there is no clear correlation between the severity of the clinical phenotype and the reduction 
of PK activity in the in vitro assay. In fact, clinically mild patients may display significantly reduced PK 
activity (Bianchi & Zanella, 2000; Zanella & Bianchi, 2000). Therefore, even when testing reveals low PK 
activity, genotyping of the red cell PK gene, PKLR, is strongly recommended to confirm the diagnosis of 
PKD.  
With over 300 mutations described and compound heterozygous gene mutations in most patients, the 
relationship between the genotype and clinical symptoms in PKD is difficult to study. This topic was first 
investigated  by  describing  homozygous  patients,  and  then  by  studying  larger  series  of  compound 
heterozygous cases grouped according to anaemia severity. Severe anaemia was commonly associated 
with disruptive mutations, such as stop codon, frameshift, splicing and large deletions, and with missense 
mutations directly involving the active site or protein stability. However, the clinical manifestations of 
PKD  also  include  genetic  post-translational  or  epigenetic  modifications,  along  with  variations  in  the 
degree  of  ineffective  erythropoiesis  and  splenic  function,  making  it  complex  to  interpret  the  in  vitro 
findings. 
More  recently,  the  genotype-phenotype  correlation  was  investigated  in  patients  enrolled  in  the  PKD 
Natural  History  Study  (Grace  et  al,  2018a).  Patients  were  grouped  according  to  the  presence  of  two 
missense mutations (M/M), one missense/ one non-missense (M/NM), or two non-missense mutations 
(NM/NM); non-missense mutations included nonsense, frameshift, inframe splicing mutations and other 
disruptive mutation variants. When compared with those patients with at least one missense mutation, 
the NM/NM group had a more severe phenotype, characterised by earlier diagnosis, lower haemoglobin 
levels, higher rate of splenectomy, greater transfusion needs and higher ferritin levels. These findings 
suggest that genetic testing may also be useful in discussing prognosis and establishing a monitoring 
plan  with  patients.  However,  the  haemoglobin  range  overlaps  among  the  genotype  groups  and  the 
frequency  of  complications  is  high  across  genotypes,  suggesting  careful  monitoring  is  needed  in  all 
patients regardless of the genotype. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Curative therapy for PKD is not currently available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022

Until recently, management options for PKD were limited to blood transfusion, splenectomy to maintain 
an adequate haemoglobin and supportive care. For these patients, haematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) is the only curative option, but it is associated with high rate of mortality and morbidity and is 
not currently recommended over regular blood transfusions and supportive care.  
A  common  intervention  is  splenectomy.  Approximately  70%  of  patients  diagnosed  with  PK  deficiency 
undergo a splenectomy procedure between the ages of 5 and 18 years to reduce the need for transfusion 
and/or to increase Hb. In majority of patients, haemolysis and indirect hyperbilirubinaemia persist after 
splenectomy, and patients remain at risk for gallstones and jaundice.  
Another common intervention is transfusion. A patient’s degree of anaemia does not correlate with the 
symptoms of anaemia. The decision to transfuse a patient with PKD relates to the patient’s tolerance of 
anaemia rather than an arbitrary level of haemoglobin. Because of increased red cell 2,3-DPG content, 
patients may tolerate moderately severe anaemia with few symptoms due to enhanced oxygen unloading 
from haemoglobin. In PKD, there is currently no data to support a strategy of transfusing to keep the 
haemoglobin above a set nadir with a goal of avoiding complications. This strategy exposes patients to 
risks  without  clear  benefit.  Rather,  transfusions  should  be  individualised,  based  on  the  patient’s 
symptoms, level of activity, and assessment of the impact of the anaemia on their quality of life. 
In  addition  to  the  supportive  treatments  targeting  improvement  of  haemolytic  anaemia,  several 
treatments  are  used  to  address  other  disease  complications;  cholecystectomy  in  the  case  of 
choledocholithiasis  (67.8%),  bisphosphonates  for  improving  BMD/preventing  further  worsening,  and 
supplemental folic acid for rapid red cell turnover. 
Iron overload is common in PKD, in both chronically transfused and transfusion-independent individuals, 
and monitoring through measurements of plasma ferritin, and/or liver, pancreas, and cardiac iron burden 
by MRI methods is indicated. Chelation therapy is necessary in regularly transfused patients and may be 
required intermittently in non-transfused patients with PKD as MRI studies are monitored. 
2.2.  About the product 
Mitapivat is an allosteric activator of wild-type PKR (red blood cell [RBC]-specific form of pyruvate kinase) 
and a range of mutant PKR (mPKR) enzymes. Mitapivat acts by allosterically binding to the PKR tetramer 
and enhancing its affinity for PEP, thereby increasing the ability of RBCs to convert PEP + ADP to pyruvate 
+ ATP. Thus, by restoring the activity of mutant forms of PKR, mitapivat targets the underlying enzymatic 
defect that causes haemolysis in PK deficiency.

2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of mitapivat is N-(4-((4-(cyclopropylmethyl)piperazine-1)carbonyl)phenyl)quinoline-
8-sulfonamide 
sulfate 
hydrate 
(2:1:3) 
corresponding 
to 
the  molecular 
formula 
(C24H26N4O3S)2.H2SO4.(H2O)3. Mitapivat has a relative molecular mass of 450.56 g/mol (free base) or 
1053.23 g/mol (sulfate hydrate salt) and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The  chemical  structure  of  mitapivat  was  elucidated  by  a  combination  of  elemental  analysis,  infrared 
spectroscopy,  1H  and  13C  NMR  spectroscopy,  mass  spectrometry,  single  crystal  X-ray  crystallography 
and  UV  spectroscopy.  The  solid-state  properties  of  the  active  substance  were  measured  by 
thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption and x-ray powder 
diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic crystalline solid. Mitapivat shows relatively 
high solubility at pH ranges from 1.0 - 5.5 and low solubility at pH range from 5.5 - 8.0. Mitapivat is 
achiral.  
Three  polymorphic  forms  have  been  observed  for  mitapivat.  The  mitapivat  manufacturing  process 
consistently produces the desired form in the desired stoichiometry. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in five main steps using three well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. Two manufacturers are proposed. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised and a 
detailed discussion on mutagenic impurities was provided. 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the description and control of the three 
active substance starting materials used. The major objection included questions in relation to the control 
of  mutagenic  or  potentially  mutagenic  impurities  in  the  starting  materials.  The  applicant  provided 
satisfactory  responses  to  resolve  the  major  objection.  Several  mutagenic  and  potentially  mutagenic

impurities (class 1, 2 and 3) are controlled via ICH M7 option 3, i.e. by a specification limit in the active 
substance starting material, supported by purge data to demonstrate sufficiently low levels in the active 
substance. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development programme. The same route of synthesis has been used throughout the development of 
mitapivat and this route has been optimised in parallel with the clinical development programme. The 
quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is comparable with that 
produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene bags placed within a high-density 
polyethylene  (HDPE)  drum.  The  primary  packaging  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  3.1.3  for  polyolefins  and 
Regulation EC 10/2011 as amended. 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, identity (IR), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC, HPLC/MS and GC), residual solvents (GC), particle size (Ph. Eur.), X-ray powder diffraction (Ph. 
Eur.) water content by KF (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS) and 
sulfate content (HPLC-CAD). 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQA). 
The  CQA  identified  are:  organic  related  substances,  genotoxic  impurities,  other  active  substance 
attributes such as description, identification, assay, residual solvents content, water content, residue on 
ignition, potential genotoxic impurities content, residual imidazole content, elemental impurities content 
and  the  crystalline  form  of  mitapivat  (hemisulfate  sesquihydrate  salt).  Microbiological  purity  is  not  a 
CQA. 
The control of mutagenic or potentially mutagenic impurities is adequate.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (5 validation/commercial batches) of the active substance are provided. The results 
are  within  the  specifications  and  consistent  from  batch  to  batch.  The  batch  data  provided  includes 
batches from each of the two active substance manufacturers proposed for commercial manufacturing, 
which are considered equivalent. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
Stability  data  from  3  batches  manufactured  at  commercial  scale  from  each of  the  two  manufacturers 
proposed for marketing stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months (manufacturer 
1) and 18 months (manufacturer 2) under long term (25ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30ºC, 65 % 
RH) conditions, and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the 
ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  assay,  related 
impurities, water content, XRPD, particle size and microbial purity. The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release (with the exception of microbiological purity which is not tested at release) and 
are stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the specification limits. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  performed  on  one  batch.  Mitapivat  is 
photostable.

Results from stress tests (acidic, basic, oxidative, simulated sunlight, thermal and humidity) were also 
provided for one batch (solid active substance and in solution). Formation of a degradation product was 
observed under acidic and basic conditions and formation of another degradation product was observed 
under oxidative conditions. In solution, formation of degradation impurities was observed upon exposure 
to simulated sunlight while the solid active substance remained stable. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify 
the proposed retest period 48 months when stored at or below 30 °C in the proposed container. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as blue film-coated tablets for oral administration containing 5 mg, 20 
mg or 50 mg of mitapivat (as hemisulfate sesquihydrate) as the active substance. The 5 mg tablet is 
round, approximately 5 mm in diameter and imprinted on one side with "M5" in black ink. The 20 mg 
tablet is round, approximately 8 mm in diameter and imprinted on one side with "M20" in black ink. The 
50 mg tablet is oblong, approximately 16 mm in length and 6.8 mm in width and imprinted on one side 
with "M50" in black ink. The three different strengths are sufficiently distinguishable from each other by 
tablet size and/or shape, and by the use of a unique product identification imprint on one tablet face. 
The  composition  is  quantitatively  proportional  between  the  three  strengths,  the  formulation  being 
manufactured from a common blend and the same coating agent.  
The  aim  of  development  was  an  immediate  release  dosage  form  to  deliver  the  therapeutic  dose  of 
mitapivat  for  twice  daily  administration  as  defined  in  the  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP).  This 
allowed  identification  of  potential  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs:  description,  identification,  assay, 
degradation products, uniformity of dosage units, water content, microbiological quality and dissolution) 
of the finished product which were then investigated during development studies. 
A traditional approach to pharmaceutical development was chosen, but QbD elements, such 
as risk assessments and design of experiments were incorporated. 
The polymorphic form of the active substance is controlled in the specification of the active substance 
and has been shown to be stable. 
An excipient compatibility study was conducted with binary blends of excipients that directly come into 
contact  with  mitapivat  and  the  active  substance  has  been  shown  to  be  compatible  with  the  selected 
excipients. Functional attributes of the excipients have been adequately described. There are no overages 
in the formulation. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with  Ph.  Eur.  or  other  relevant  standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used in  the  finished  product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.3.1. of this 
report. Lactose is an excipient with a known physiological effect and is thus also listed in section 2 of the 
SmPC.  As  the  finished  product  contains  contains  less  than  1  mmol  (23  mg)  sodium  per  tablet,  it  is 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
Two formulations of mitapivat finished product have been used during clinical development: 5 mg, 20 
mg, and 50 mg tablets and 5 mg, 25 mg, and 100 mg capsules.  
Mitapivat  active  substance  absorption  is  potentially  limited  by  solubility  and  dissolution.  Mitapivat 
demonstrates relatively high solubility at pH ranges from 1.0 - 5.5 and low solubility at pH range from 
5.5  -  8.0.  The  sulfate  hydrate  form  of  the  active  substance  affords  sufficient  solubility  overall  at 
physiologically relevant pH values.

The  manufacturing  process  for  Pyrukynd  tablets  used  in  clinical  trials  is  essentially  the  same  as  the 
commercial process in terms of process and control strategy. The choice of manufacturing process has 
been justified. Dry granulation and direct compression formulations were initially considered.  
The  tablet  batches  used  for  clinical  development  as  well  as  the  primary  registration  stability  batches 
were manufactured at the manufacturing site proposed for commercial manufacturing and following the 
proposed commercial process with the exception of imprinting, as all tablets used in clinical studies were 
plain-faced. The imprinting does not alter the physical properties of the tablets and the trace amount of 
imprinted ink on the tablet is not expected to impact the performance and bioavailability of the tablets. 
Therefore, no formal bioequivalence studies were conducted to compare the plain-faced and imprinted 
tablets. 
The relative bioavailability following administration of the direct compression tablet formulation intended 
for commercial manufacture and the capsule formulation used in phase 1 safety and phase 2 efficacy 
studies was investigated in a clinical study and found to be similar. 
The development of the QC dissolution method is described. The discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method has been studied and sufficient discriminatory capacity has been demonstrated for meaningful 
changes in process parameters or composition.  
For QC testing, a method utilizing a USP Apparatus 2 with 900 mL of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 
containing 0.05% SDS with a paddle speed of 70 rpm was selected.  
The critical process parameters of the manufacturing process have been identified, adequately studied 
and are appropriately defined and controlled. 
A bulk holding time study was conducted. Stability data justify a maximum hold time of 3 months for 
the final blend mixture, core tablets, and bulk film-coated tablets.  
The start of shelf-life of the finished product is determined in accordance with Note for Guidance on Start 
of Shelf-life of the Finished Dosage Forms (CPMP/QWP/072/96). 
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PCTFE/Al  blisters.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of several steps which include blending, tabletting and packaging. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been investigated during development and scale-up. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. An acceptable validation scheme has been submitted 
and the process will be validated on 3 consecutive production scale batches prior to commercialisation. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (visual),  identification  (HPLC/UV  and  HPLC/DAD),  assay  (HPLC/UV),  impurity  AGI-80276 
(LC/MS/MS),  degradation  products  (HPLC/UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (in 
house), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.).

Limits for impurities are set in line with ICH Q3B. The potential presence of elemental impurities in the 
finished product was assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for 
Elemental Impurities.  Based on the risk assessment, it can be concluded that no specific controls for 
elemental impurities are required in the finished product specification. 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the risk of presence of nitrosamines. 
The major objection is resolved. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 6 batches of each strength manufactured with active substance 
from  both  manufacturers  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to 
manufacture  to  the  intended  product  specification.  Batch  results  for  clinical  batches  and  for  the 
registration batches were also provided.  
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional finished product release testing. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  18  finished  product  batches  (6  batches  per  strength)  produced  according  to  the 
commercial  manufacturing  process  and  using  different  active  substance  batches  from  both  active 
substance manufacturers stored for up to 12-24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), 
for up to 12-24 months under intermediate conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content, microbial 
purity and XRPD. All results were within specification.  
In addition, two batches (5 mg and 50 mg strength) were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline 
on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results indicate that the finished 
product is not light sensitive. 
Results from forced degradation studies were also provided. Samples were exposed to acidic, basic, and 
oxidative conditions in solution and formation of two degradation products was observed. In addition, 
solid  finished  product  samples  were  exposed  to  simulated  sunlight,  thermal  and  thermal-humidity 
conditions and no degradation was observed.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with the special precaution for 
storage ‘store below 25ºC’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced  from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  condition  as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the

2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  clinical  use.  A  Major  objection  raised 
during the procedure in relation to the description and control of the three starting materials used to 
manufacture the active substance has been satisfactorily resolved. A Major Objection raised in relation 
to the risk of presence of nitrosamines is also satisfactorily resolved. Suitable limits at release and shelf-
life have been included in the finish product specification. The shelf life of 2 years with storage condition 
‘store below 25 oC’ ensures that the nitrosamine impurity remains below the acceptable intake until the 
end of shelf life. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
Pyruvate  kinase  deficiency  is  an  autosomal  recessive  enzymopathy  in  red  cells  that  is  caused  by 
mutations in PKLR. These genetic alterations lead to a deficit of pyruvate kinase activity in red cells and 
to  haemolytic  anaemia  of  variable  severity.  The  main  mutation  found  in  Caucasian  patients  with  PK 
deficiency  are  R510Q  (40%)  and  R486W  (30%)  approximately.  Pyruvate  kinase  R  (PKR)  is  one  of  4 
pyruvate kinase isoenzymes expressed in human tissues by 2 different genes, PKLR and PKM. Both PKR 
and PKL are splice isoforms of the PKLR gene, while PKM1 and PKM2 are expressed from the PKM gene. 
The isoforms are expressed either in the lungs, adipocytes or epithelial cells (PKM2), either in the brain, 
muscle or heart (PKM1), either in liver and small intestine (PKL) or erythroblasts or matures erythrocytes 
(PKR). PKM2 et PKLR are regulated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate [FBP] [activating] and several amino 
acids  [both  activating  and  inhibitory])  and  phosphorylation  [inhibitory].  Mitapivat  is  an  oral,  small-
molecule allosteric activator of wild type (WT) and a range of mutant isoforms of pyruvate kinase in red 
cells that binds to an allosteric pocket to stabilise the active tetrameric form of the enzyme and enhance 
its affinity for its substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (Grace RF, et al. and Kung C, et al. 2017). 
In vitro studies 
Mitapivat and its predominant metabolite AGI-8702 were tested to evaluate their activation potential. It 
was demonstrated that while the WT PKR was activated by mitapivat with AC50 0.013 µM the 10 mutant 
PKR  isoforms  evaluated  were  activated  with  AC50  values  ranged  approximately  0.009  to  0.059  µM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 21/187 
 
 
 
Mitapivat  also  activated  PKM2  and  PKL,  with  AC50  values  of  0.038  and  0.037  μM,  respectively,  and 
maximum percent activation of 587% and 293%, respectively. In contrast to mitapivat, AGI-8702 had 
low potency mixed activity (activation, inhibition, or no effect) against WT and the mutant isoforms. 
Mitapivat  also  demonstrated  the  ability  to  stabilise  mutant  PKR  isoforms  that  are  hypersensitive  to 
thermal denaturation such as R510Q, G364D and R532W, especially towards R510Q.  
In  human  red  blood  cells,  mitapivat  activates  PKR  with  AC50  and  AC90  for  PKR  activation  of 
0.0619±0.0346  μM  and  1.002±1.109  μM,  respectively  (n=16).  The  average  maximum  percent  PKR 
activation  was  274%±56%.  AGI-8702  is  a  weak  activator  of  PKR  in  RBCs  from  human  whole  blood 
compared to mitapivat.  
To evaluate mitapivat’s effect, the rate of carbon flow through the PKR enzyme reaction (PKR flux) was 
measured in WT C57BL/6 mouse whole blood. Mitapivat increased the PKR flux by 80% and also induced 
enhanced  glycolytic  pathway  activity  in  RBCs.  In  human  RBCs  isolated  from  fresh  whole  blood  from 
healthy donors: mitapivat increased ATP levels in human RBCs, consistent with activation of cellular PKR 
with an average absolute of 1.59-fold change and a mean AC50 0.0109±0.007 µM. The metabolite of 
mitapivat, has a low potency (0.5% of mitapivat) to increased ATP Production.  
In  human  RBCs  isolated  from  4  patients  with  distinct  genotypes  of  PK  deficiency  (Patient  A: 
R510Q/G511R;  Patient  B:  R486W/D390N;  Patient  C:  A495V/E241stop;  Patient  D:  R510Q/E241stop), 
mitapivat increased ATP levels and decreased 2.3-DPG and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) after 3 (Patient 
C) to 24 hours (Patient A and B) of exposure to mitapivat. Patient D was not evaluated in this experiment 
because the number of available cells was limited.  
Additionally,  dose-response  curves  assessed  for  2  of  the  4  patients  (B  and  D)  demonstrated  that 
Mitapivat treatment (concentration range was 0.000153 to 10 µM for Patient B and 0.000508 to 10 µM 
for Patient D) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PKR activity.  
In vivo studies 
The objective of PK/PD studies was to investigate the relationship between mitapivat pharmacokinetics 
and  target  engagement  (PKR  activation)  and  pharmacodynamics  parameters  (2,3-DPG  and  ATP 
concentrations, and calculated ATP/2,3-DPG ratios) after single or multiple oral doses of mitapivat. 
After single dose of 1, 10, 50 or 150mg/kg of mitapivat, an increase of PKR activity in RBC (24.1% to 
145%) and 2,3 DPG levels (by 6.53% to 23.3%) was observed. No change of ATP level was noted. The 
increase of ATP level was observed after 3 days BID of treatment with an augmentation of 14.8 to 45%. 
The decrease of 2.3 DPG levels and the increase of PKR activity were observed with the same changes 
than single dose (0.777% to 22.5% and 39.9% to 196%, respectively). After 7 days of BID oral dosing 
of  mitapivat,  results  were  similar  to  the  ones  after  3  days  of  treatment:  ATP  exposure  increased  (by 
15.6%  to  43.7%)  and  2,3-  DPG  exposure  decreased  (by  1.78%  to  18.7%)  in  mouse  blood,  and  PKR 
activity  effectively  increased  (by  29.4%  to  141%)  in  RBCs  in  a  dose-proportional  manner.  Therefore, 
results were pooled to determinate the curve of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationships. 
Mitapivat  was  evaluated  in  anaemia  mice  (female  Hbbth3/+  mice  were  used  in  all  studies  since  they 
exhibit a more severe phenotype than males [Nai et al, 2012]versus WT C57BL/6J mice during 21 days 
at 50 mg/kg BID oral gavage or 100 mg/kg diet and 56-day study diet: 100 mg/kg. In anaemic mice at 
50 mg/kg, an increase of haemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume was observed as well as a decrease 
of absolute reticulocyte count.  
An increase of ATP levels was observed in peripheral blood after 21 days in Hbbth3/+ mice (50 mg/kg 
BID). Moreover, a decrease of apoptotic erythroblasts from spleen and bone marrow and a decrease of

levels  of  reactive  oxygen  species  in  erythroblasts  in  bone  marrow  (P<0.05  vs  vehicle  control)  were 
observed in anaemic mice. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Mitapivat and its metabolite AGI 8702 were assessed for their potential to inhibit binding and enzymatic 
activity in a panel of 91 receptors, ion channels, and enzymes, including Histamine receptors and CYP19 
aromatase.    AGI8702  showed  no  inhibition  of  binding  to  histamine  receptor  (H1  H2  and  H3)  and  to 
aromatase  (highest  concentration  tested  10  µM).    Mitapivat  inhibits  by  55  and  64%  the  H1  and  H2 
receptors but with no functional activity. However, with 72% binding inhibition of H3 receptor, mitapivat 
has a functional antagonism activity (IC50 = 0.102)) and an inverse agonism activity (EC50 0.012 µM). 
As H3 receptor is present in brain, lung and gastrointestinal tract, an inhibition should have effects on 
behaviour or gastrointestinal effect. Mitapivat inhibits CYP19 Aromatase in several test enzyme systems: 
Insects cells expressing human recombinant aromatase, human placental microsomes, and rat ovarian 
microsomes.  The  IC50  of  mitapivat  in  human  placental  microsomes  was  higher  (2.05  µM)  than  the 
positive control which were know aromatase inhibitors (IC50 from 0.00829 to 0.397µM).  
On  the  other  hand,  no  aromatase  inhibition  activity  was  observed  with  AGI-8702  at  the  highest 
concentration tested (10 μM).  
Safety pharmacology 
The  IC50  for  both  mitapivat  and  its  metabolite  AGI-8702  was  >  10  µM,  suggesting  a  low  potential 
inhibition of hERG current. This low potential was confirmed by GLP-compliant manual patch clamp assay 
for  potential  inhibition  of  the  hERG  current  at  concentrations  up  to  226  μM.  The  IC50  and  IC20 
(concentration that produced 50 or 20% inhibition) were 29.4 and 8.6 μM, respectively, confirming that 
the potential for mitapivat to inhibit the hERG current is low. Studies showed no effect of mitapivat on 
respiratory and cardiac system. Otherwise, CNS (central nervous system) effects observed in the Irwin 
study in male rats, were more frequent in a proportional manner in the treated groups (30, 150, or 300 
mg/kg)  compared  to  the  control,  in  particular  at  the  highest  doses  tested  of  150  and  300  mg/Kg. 
Consequently,  a  relationship  with  the  test  article  cannot  be  excluded  at  all.  Anyway,  considering  the  
exposure values at  16 and 33-fold the human Cmax (965 ng/mL) and 26 and 53-fold the human AUC0-
12hr (3,580 hr•ng/mL) at the recommended dose of 50mg BID, respectively, the  occurred effects were 
suggested to not  represent a safety risk from a clinical point of view. 
Following observed effects in repeat dose toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys, the emetic activity 
was  evaluated  in  ferrets.  Mitapivat  effects  after  oral  administration  at  30,  60  and  100  mg/kg  were 
observed during 6 hours. Emetic activity was observed ≤ 30 mg/kg and was marked at ≤ 60mg/kg. The 
mitapivat AUC0-12hr and Cmax values associated with the 30 mg/kg dose were 23,752 hr•ng/mL (6.6-
fold  the  human  AUC0-12hr  at  the  recommended  dose)  and  10,183  ng/mL  (11-fold  the  Cmax  at  the 
recommended dose), respectively. The mitapivat AUC0-12hr and Cmax values associated with the 60 
mg/kg  dose  were  96,105  hr•ng/mL  (27-fold  the  human  AUC0-12hr  at  the  recommended  dose)  and 
20,200 ng/mL (21-fold the Cmax at the recommended dose), respectively. No pharmacodynamic drug 
interaction studies have been conducted; according to the applicant it is not anticipated that mitapivat 
will be administered in combination with other therapies that may alter the pharmacological effect of the 
test article, or with therapies whose pharmacological effects may be altered by co-administration with 
mitapivat. This is agreed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted,  which  is  acceptable  give  the 
product-characteristics.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
Mitapivat is a small molecule activator of the red blood cell–specific form of pyruvate kinase (PKR). A 
comprehensive series of in vitro and in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
studies has been conducted with mitapivat. In vitro studies of mitapivat were also performed to evaluate 
the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interactions.  
The single-dose PK of mitapivat was characterised by rapid oral absorption, moderate to high plasma 
clearance (CL), high volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss), moderate to long half-life (T½), and 
moderate to high oral bioavailability in Sprague Dawley rats, Beagle dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Toxicokinetics  was  evaluated  in  several  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies.  The  TK  of  mitapivat  and  its 
metabolite,  AGI-8702,  was  evaluated  in  mice,  rats,  monkeys,  and  rabbits  after  twice-daily  (BID)  oral 
doses of mitapivat ranging from 10 to 2,000 mg/kg/day for up to 9 months.  
Methods of analysis 
Qualified liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalytical assays were 
used  for  all  single-dose  PK  and  in  vitro  studies.  Method  details  are  included in  the  individual  reports. 
Metabolism  and  excretion  studies  using  [14C]mitapivat  used  LC-MS/MS  techniques  for  metabolite 
identification. Quantitative determination of total radioactivity and metabolites was made either by liquid 
scintillation  counting  (LSC)  or  in-line  radioactivity  monitoring  (β-radioactivity  monitoring  [β-RAM]) 
techniques. The tissue distribution study conducted in rats after administration of [14C]mitapivat used 
quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) methodology. All radiolabelled studies were conducted 
with [14C]mitapivat of 97% purity or greater. 
In  the  toxicokinetic  studies  plasma  concentrations  of  mitapivat  and  its  metabolite,  AGI-8702,  were 
determined using validated LC-MS/MS assays.  
The  intra-run  and  inter-run  accuracy  tested  in  the  4  levels  of  analytical  QCs  are  acceptable  (under 
15%RE)  as  well  as  the  precision  assessed  in  the  4  levels  of  analytical  QCs  (under  10%CV)  in  the  4 
plasma species. 
Some  criteria  of  validation  are  not  provided,  mitapivat  and  AGI-8702  were  determined  to  be  stable 
between 144 and 197 days (depends on the species) in plasma samples when stored at -20ºC or -70ºC  
but no details are provided on the degradation kinetics of these products as a function of temperature 
or the expected storage temperature for these samples from the validation report of the stability study 
where these two temperatures are evaluated, we could infer that it is -20 and/or -70).  
Moreover,  information  on  the  non-specific  matrix-related  interferences  (using  individual  matrix  lots, 
analysed as blanks and fortified at the LLOQ level), specific interferences (using LLOQ (and sometimes 
ULOQ  for  LBAs)  QC  samples),  on  the  recovery  of  the  analyte  from  the  biological  matrix  (Extraction 
recovery should be reproducible), on the carry-over (blank following a ULOQ sample) were not provided. 
However, these studies are GLP thus, the analytical methods are acceptable.  
Absorption 
It  was  shown  by  a  permeability  test  that  mitapivat  is  actively  transported  across  Caco-2—cells.  The 
bidirectional  permeability  of  Mitapivat  appeared  greater  in  the  basal-apical  direction  than  the  A-B 
direction resulting in efflux ratios greater than 2 and was reduced by 92 and 98% in the presence of the 
P-gp inhibitors, valspodar and verapamil respectively, confirming that mitapivat is actually a substrate 
of P-gp while it is not actively transported across MDCKII-BCRP cells.  After a single PO dose, the oral 
bioavailability of mitapivat was 50%, 82%, and 24% in rats, dogs, and monkeys, respectively. The T1/2 
were from 3.7 to 9.5 hours after oral dose and from 4.6 to 9.6 hours after IV dose.

The Mean plasma toxicokinetic parameters showed that females were more exposed than male rats at 
same doses; from 100 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg the exposure was 3-fold higher in female than male rats. At 
1000 and 2000 mg/kg, the dose proportional was less important (only 2/2.5-fold).  
In male dogs, mitapivat exposure decreased with decreasing dose, and the dose-exposure relationship 
was  proportional  between  125  and  10  mg/kg.  In  female  monkeys,  the  mitapivat  exposure  was  dose 
proportional up to 250mg/kg. At 500 and 1000 mg/kg, the increase exposure was less dose proportional. 
Two formulations were assessed at pH <1 or pH = 3 and showed similar results. 
Distribution 
The brain versus plasma distribution of mitapivat was assessed in fed male rats after a single dose 300 
mg/kg PO or during 5 days of once-daily PO dosing at 300mg/kg. Low brain penetration was observed, 
with  brain-to-plasma  ratios  of  0.0912  after  five  days  of  daily  oral  administration.  After  24  hours,  the 
plasma  concentration  of  mitapivat  decreased  from  approximately  10,000  ng/ml  to  <10  ng/ml  after 
following the single-dose treatment while decreased to <100ng/ml during the 5-day dosing. Conversely, 
in  the  brain,  the  mitapivat  concentration  seemed  to  keep  constant  (around  1000  ng/ml)  and  similar 
either at a single dose or after 5 days of treatment (no accumulation). Indeed, the mitapivat plasma and 
brain  AUC0-24hr  from time  0  to  24 hours  post-dose  were  253619  and  14394 hr*ng/mL,  respectively 
following  single  dose  administration  and  192010  and  17506  hr*ng/mL,  respectively  after  5  days 
administration. 
The  tissues  distribution  was  assessed  in  male  Long-Evans  rats  by  [14C]radioactivity  using  validated 
QWBA techniques. The radioactivity after a single oral 100-mg/kg dose of [14C]mitapivat after 168 post-
dose were below the quantifiable limit (BLQ)  in most tissues. By 504 hrs, mosti tissues were BQL except 
aorta, eye, abdominal fat, liver, muscle, spleen, thyroids and uveal tract. The ocular tissues, as well as 
tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolic/excretory system, contained the highest distribution, 
suggesting mitapivat may bind to melanin. Moreover, the exposure in pigmented skin was higher relative 
to the exposure in non-pigmented skin. The radioactivity in central nervous system was very low. The 
plasma  protein  binding  mean  values  for  mitapivat  (0.2,  1,  and  10  μM)  was  moderate  to  high  (89%, 
93.3%,  98%  and  97.7%  in  dog,  monkey,  rat  and  human,  respectively)  and  was  53.76%  for  the 
metabolite AGI-8702 (0.1, 0.3 and 1 μM) in human plasma.  
The partitioning of mitapivat between red blood cell and plasma showed a ratio of 0.5 in mouse, 0.47 in 
rat,  0.62  in  dog,  0.42  in  monkey  and  0.37  in  human.  This  distribution  suggests  a  low  penetration  of 
mitapivat  in  red  blood  cells  (ratio  <1).  However,  in  view  of  pharmacology  studies,  this  distribution  is 
sufficient for mitapivat to be active on PKR enzymes in red blood cells. No Placental transfer of mitapivat 
has been evaluated.  
Metabolism 
Microsome tests have shown that mitapivat presents a metabolic stability in mouse, rat, dog, monkey 
and human. Mitapivat is extensively metabolised in the liver with high clearance.  The main cytochromes 
implicated  in  metabolism  of  mitapivat  in  human  liver  microsomes  are  CYP3A4  and  CYP3A5.    All 
metabolites found in human were found in at least one of other species in vitro and in vivo. All metabolites 
were characterised and were found under 10%, excepted metabolites M396 or AGI-8702 found at 33% 
in human hepatocytes and > 50 % in human liver microsomal incubation; in rats this metabolite was 
found at > 60% in liver microsomal incubation and at 23 % in male and 21% in female in vivo. All studies 
have evaluated mitapivat and its metabolite according to ICH M3 guideline.  
Excretion 
In male rats, the dosed radioactivity was excreted via biliary, urinary, and fecal routes in similar amounts 
(approximately  30%  each).  In  female  rats,  biliary  excretion  was  the  major  route  of  elimination, 
accounting for 48.8% of the dose; in feces and urine, the mean cumulative excretion was 30.4% and 
13.9%, respectively. AG-348 recovered unchanged in urine was negligible (0.0458% of dose). The total 
amount of mitapivat recovered in the urine of monkeys was negligible (0.267% of dose) as well. 
Excretion of mitapivat in milk has not been evaluated.

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Please refer to the section on Clinical Pharmacology below. 
2.4.3.  Toxicology 
2.4.3.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The applicant provided 3 non-GLP compliant studies in rats, dogs and monkeys.  
In the rat study, no early mortality was observed nor mitrapivat-related clinical observation, effects on 
body weight or macroscopic findings at the dose of 100 to 2000 mg/kg by oral gavage.  
In  dogs,  mitapivat  was  administrated  from  10  up  to  125  mg/kg;  swelling  (ear,  eyelid,  mouth,  paw) 
and/or discoloration (mouth, thoracic region, abdominal region, or whole body) were observed from 30 
mg/kg. Emesis was noted from 62.5 mg/kg; lethargy, prostration and reduced activity from 125 mg/kg. 
The clinical observations appeared at 0.5 to 4 hr postdose and were almost completely resolved by 8 
hours postdose. 
In monkey, mitapivat was administrated from 100 up to 1000 mg/kg; no early mortality or mitapivat-
related effects were observed at ≤250 mg/kg. Only a non-adverse emesis was observed at 500 mg/kg. 
2.4.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The  applicant  performed  GLP-compliant  regulatory  studies  such  as  28-days,  3-months  and  6-months 
pivotal studies in rats and 28-days, 3-months and 9-months pivotal studies in monkeys.  
RATS 
Regarding the variability of exposure between male and female rats, different dose levels were used to 
attain similar drug exposure.  
In the first pivotal study in rats, mitapivat was administrated at 60, 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in males 
and at 20, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day in female by oral gavage during 28 days. One male was found dead 
on day 8 in group at 60 mg/kg/day, the cause of death was dark area on all lobes of the lung correlated 
with microscopic moderate haemorrhage. This death was considered likely traumatic in origin and was 
not considered test article related.  
The  clinical  observation,  such  as  clear  material  around  the  mouth,  was  only  observed  1-2 hours  post 
dose  at  highest  dose  and  was  fully  resolved  during  the  recovery  period.  The  body  weight  and  food 
consumption were decreased of 7.7% in males at 600 mg/kg and was not reversible during the recovery 
period,  whereas  the  effects  on  food  consumption  was  reversible.  Mitapivat  exposure  increased  with 
increasing dose, and dose proportionality varied across doses. The mean mitapivat accumulation ratios 
ranged from 0.63 to 2.20 in males and from 0.68 to 1.85 in females. 
The  haematology  and  coagulation  parameters  were  impacted  by  mitapivat  but  were  related  to  the 
mechanism of action. The absolute reticulocyte counts, minimally lower MCV, and minimally higher mean 
corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were decreased in rat at 600 mg/kg. In females, at all 
doses,  the  haemoglobin  distribution  width  (HDW)  was  decreased  and  non-reversible  after  14  days 
recovery.  Excepted  the  lower  mean  glucose  value  in  male  at  the  highest  dose,  all  serum  chemistry 
changes were reversible during the recovery period. The alterations of serum chemistry parameters were 
lower  serum  chloride,  sodium,  glucose,  and  higher  cholesterol,  albumin  and  albumin/globulin  ratio  in 
male from 300 mg/kg/d and lower serum chloride, blood urea nitrogen and higher cholesterol in females 
at 200 mg/kg/d. The incidence of urinary ketones was higher in the 300 and 600 mg/kg/day males at 
the  Day  28/29  interval.  This  finding  was  considered  to  correlate  to  decreased  food  consumption  and

body weight in the 600 mg/kg/day males. The urine chemistry changes were an increase of corrected 
total sodium and chloride in male from 300 and 600 mg/kg/d respectively and an increase of corrected 
total  chlorid  and  creatinine  at  200mg/kg/d,  and  an  increase  of  corrected  total  potassium  from 
100mg/kg/d. All those changes were reversible.  
In  general  in the  28-day study  in  rats,  the  incidence  of  microscopic  findings  increased  with  dose  and 
effect were more pronounced in males than in females. An exception was at highest doses the incidence 
and  impact  in  liver  and  adrenal  gland  that  were  similar  in  both  sexes.  Microscopic  findings  from  60 
mg/kg/day included vacuolation in adrenal zona glomerulosa in male and was reversible.  
From 300/100 mg/kg/d hepatocellular and centrilobular hypertrophy correlated with higher liver weight 
were observed in both sexes, a lower thickness in adrenal zona fasciulata correlated with lower adrenal 
weight  and  a  decrease  of  zymogene  granule  in  pancreas  was  observed  in  males.  In  females,  an 
incomplete corpora lutea and follicular cyst were observed in ovary correlated with higher ovary weight, 
as well as a hypertrophy of uterus and changes in oestrous cycle consisting of persistent dioestrous and 
vaginal mucification. This impact on female reproductive organ was related to the inhibition of CYP19 
aromatase by mitapivat. It is known that aromatase inhibitor can change the oestrus cycle.   
At 600/200 mg/kg, all effects noted previously were observed, as well as, tubular vacuolation in kidneys 
correlated  with  higher  kidney  weight  in  both  sexes,  in  males  myocardium  vacuolation  correlated  with 
lower heart weight, and a decreased secretion in prostate correlated with lower prostate and seminal 
vesicles weights and in females, increased basophilia in pituitary gland. All effects were reversible except 
decreased prostate weight (-20% absolute) and decreased secretion prostate weight (-13.8% absolute). 
Only  microscopic  findings  in  the  ovaries  were  considered  adverse  at  100  mg/kg/d.  The  tubular 
vacuolation  in  kidney  corresponds  to  multiple,  non-staining,  often  non-discrete  vacuoles  within  the 
cytoplasm of the renal tubular epithelium primarily in the outer medulla.  
Therefore, the NOAEL was considered to be 600 mg/kg/day for males and 20 mg/kg/day for females. 
Dosage levels of 600 mg/kg/day for males and 20 mg/kg/day for females resulted on day 27 mitapivat 
AUC0-12hr values of 118,000 and 10,400 hr.ng/mL (33- and 2.9-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 
mg BID), respectively, and mitapivat Cmax values of 27,500 and 4,730 ng/mL, respectively. On day 27 
AGI-8702/mitapivat AUC0-12hr ratios at these dosage levels were 0.37 and 0.07, respectively.  
The  second  pivotal  study  in  rats  was  a  3-month  with  28-day  recovery  period  study  at  doses  40/10, 
60/20, 150/50 and 300/100 mg/kg/day in males/females.  
There were no test article–related deaths during the study. One control group male was found dead on 
day 42. The cause of death was not determined from the macroscopic or microscopic examinations. One 
50  mg/kg/day  group  female  was  euthanised  on  day  62.  The  cause  of  the  deteriorating  condition 
necessitating early euthanasia as determined from the microscopic examination was ascending chronic 
active pyelonephritis. One TK Group 2A male died on day 19 and one TK Group 5A male  died on day 
63.  The  cause  of  death  for  both  TK  males  as  determined  from  the  macroscopic  examination  was 
undetermined. No early mortalities were considered mitapivat related because of their isolated incidence 
and lack of dose response.  
No  effect  was  observed  at  40/10  mg/kg/day  except  haematology  changes  (decrease  reticulocytes  in 
female)  and  a  decrease  of  adrenal  weight  in  male  which  were  reversible  during  the  recovery  period. 
Effects observed were similar to effects on the 28 days study and correlated with organ weights changes 
(vacuolation  in  adrenal  ZG  and  decreased  thickness  in  ZF  adrenal,  centrilobular  hypertrophy  in  liver, 
incomplete  CL  in  ovaries  as  wells  as  a  persistent  dioestrus  during  cycle  and  uterus  atrophy  and 
mucification). These effects were reversible at 150/50 mg/kg/d. At 300/100 mg/kg/day the vacuolation 
in  ZG  adrenal  in  F  was  not  reversible.  In  males  treated  from  150  mg/kg/day,  changes  in  testis  were 
observed: tubular degeneration, spermatid retention and Leydig cell hypertrophy correlated with a higher 
testis weight, as well as cell debris in epididymis. Those changes were reversible at 150 but not at 300 
mg/kg/d. However, changes in kidney and prostate weight (increase and decrease respectively) were 
observed  at  300  mg/kg/d  in  males  without  microscopic  findings  correlated.  In  this  study,  effects  on 
serum  chemistry  have  a  low  incidence:  only  decreased  chloride  in  female  from  20  mg/kg/day  was 
observed and it was not persistent after the recovery period.

Effects  observed  on  kidney,  heart,  prostate  and  pituitary  gland  in  the  28-day  study  at  600  and  200 
mg/kg/day  did  not occur at  lower doses  with longer  duration.  Based  on  the  results  of  this  study,  the 
NOAEL was considered to be 60 mg/kg/day for males and 50 mg/kg/day for females. Dosage levels of 
60 mg/kg/day for males and 50 mg/kg/day for females resulted on day 90 mitapivat AUC0-12hr values 
of 16,800 and 39,400, respectively (4.7 and 11-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID) and 
mitapivat Cmax values of 5,550 and 13,600, respectively.  
At the Week 13 primary necropsy, test article–related microscopic observations were observed at doses 
from 50 mg/kg/day on. Test article–related changes in the female reproductive tract were seen at ≥50 
mg/kg/day. A single incidence of luteal cysts in the ovary at 50 mg/kg/day and 2 incidences of follicular 
cyst and of incongruence of ovarian morphology with oestrous stage at 20 mg/kg/day were of uncertain 
test article relationship. 
After the 4-week recovery period, an increased severity of vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa persisted 
in females at 100 mg/kg/day; single incidences of tubular degeneration/atrophy in the testis and luminal 
cellular debris in the epididymis were noted in 1 male at 300 mg/kg/day. The lower incidences of these 
findings compared to those at the primary necropsy suggested partial recovery. Increased large atretic 
follicles and decreased corpora lutea in 1 female at 50 mg/kg/day (associated with an abnormal oestrous 
phase of the oestrous cycle) was consistent with spontaneous reproductive senescence, but a relationship 
to  test  article  administration  cannot  be  ruled  out.  All  other  test  article–related  microscopic  findings 
observed at the Week 13 primary necropsy were no longer present, were present at similar incidences 
to the control groups, or were present in low incidences consistent with spontaneous findings. All the 
organ weight changes observed at the Week 13 primary necropsy were no longer present. 
Mitapivat was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, with a tmax of 1.0 to 2.0 hours. Mitapivat exposure 
increased with increasing dose, and dose proportionality varied across doses. Exposure ratios over the 
dosing intervals can be found in Module 2.6.5. The mean mitapivat accumulation ratios ranged from 1.81 
to 3.82 in males and from 1.56 to 2.60 in females. AGI-8702 was rapidly formed after mitapivat dosing, 
with tmax of 1.0 hours (except on day 90 in females in the 50 mg/kg/day group, in which tmax was 8.0 
hours). AGI-8702 exposure increased with increasing dose, and dose proportionality varied across doses. 
The mean ratio of AGI-8702 exposure from day 90 to day 0 ranged from 1.32 to 4.01 in males and from 
2.84 to 9.46 in females. 
The third study in rats was a 6-month with 28 days of recovery study at doses of 40/10, 60/20, 150/50 
and 300/200 mg/kg/d in males/females.  
There were no test article–related deaths; the mortality observed in TK group was justified and none of 
the early mortalities were considered test article related. 
Administered doses were similar to the 3-month study except in females for which the highest dose has 
been increased to 200 instead of 100 mg/kg/d.  
Test article-related clinical observations were sporadic and limited to clear, red, and/or yellow material 
around the mouth and/or nose and on the forelimb(s) in all test article-treated male groups and in the 
50 and 200 mg/kg/day group females during the dosing period. 
Test article-related lower body weight gains were noted in the 150 and 300 mg/kg/day group males and 
higher body weight gains were noted in the 200 mg/kg/day group females throughout the dosing period, 
which correlated with higher food consumption beginning from study week 2 to 3. 
Test  article-related  alterations  in  clinical  pathology  parameters  included  minimally  lower  absolute 
reticulocyte counts with consequently lower mean haemoglobin distribution width values in females at ≥
10 mg/kg/day, and a minimally lower chloride value in the 300 mg/kg/day group males at study week 
26. Although these alterations were of minimal magnitude and non-adverse, they were considered by 
the applicant test article-related because they have been noted consistently in other studies with this 
test article and another test article with the same mode of action (Bultman, 2014, Kappeler, 2015). The 
lower reticulocyte count was likely related to the mechanism of action of the test article, while the cause 
of the lower serum chloride value was uncertain.

Effects  observed  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  3-month  study  at  same  doses  such  as 
haematology  changes  (decreased  reticulocytes  in  females),  serum  chemistry  changes  (decreased 
chloride in female), vacuolation in ZG adrenal, centrilobular hypertrophy correlated with a higher liver 
weight from 60 mg/kg/d in male and at 200 mg/kg in female, spermatid retention, tubular degeneration 
and Leydig cell hypertrophy in testis, incomplete CL in ovaries, uterus atrophy and mucification in vagina. 
All  effects  were  reversible  excepted  from  50  mg/kg/d  in  female,  liver  changes  (hepatocellular  and 
centrilobular  hypertrophy)  and  adrenal  vacuolation,  at  300  mg/kg/d  spermatid  retention.  At  200 
mg/kg/day, an increase of luteinised follicles was observed in ovaries, as well as some changes in organs 
weight without microscopic findings (kidneys, and thyroid).  
All  test  article-related  findings  recovered  or  partially  recovered  during  the  recovery  period  with  the 
exception of mean body weights which remained similar to the end of the dosing period; however, body 
weight gains during the recovery period were similar to those of the control group animals. 
There were sex-related differences in exposure to mitapivat on all days 
There were sex-related differences in exposure to mitapivat on all days. Mitapivat exposure increased 
with increasing dose, and dose proportionality varied across doses. The mean mitapivat accumulation 
ratios ranged from 0.804 to 4.00 in males and females. AGI-8702 was rapidly formed after oral dosing 
with mitapivat, with a mean tmax of 1.0 hour for all groups across all days. AGI-8702 exposure increased 
with increasing dose, and dose proportionality varied across doses. There were sex-related differences 
in AGI-8702 exposure. The mean ratio of AGI-8702 exposure from day 90 or day 180 to day 0 ranged 
from 0.869 to 5.08 in males and females.  
MONKEYS 
In monkeys, mitapivat was well tolerated in the 28-day study at all doses (0, 20, 50 and 150 mg/kg/day). 
No test article–related clinical observations or effects on body weight or food consumption were noted. 
There  were  no  test  article–related  alterations  in  clinical  pathology  parameters  or  ophthalmic, 
electrocardiography, macroscopic, or microscopic findings. There were no test article-related microscopic 
observations  noted  in  the  examined  tissues  from  animals  at  the  primary  or  recovery  necropsies.  All 
microscopic observations noted were considered spontaneous and incidental, as stated by the applicant; 
many of them have been well described as background changes in cynomolgus monkeys (Chamanza et 
al., 2010; Wood 2008; Drevon-Gaillot et al., 2006). 
Only a reversible increase of liver weight at 150 mg/kg/day was observed in male and female. The NOEL 
was 50 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day in both sexes. Mitapivat was rapidly absorbed 
after oral dosing, with mean tmax ranging from 1.00 to 2.40 hours. There were small sex differences 
observed at the 20 mg/kg/day dose level on day 0 and day 27, and at the 50-mg/kg/day dose level on 
day 0. Mitapivat exposure increased with increasing dose, and dose proportionality varied across doses.  
Accumulation ratios for mitapivat ranged from 0.65 to 1.61 in males, and from 0.67 to 1.63 in females.   
The  mean  tmax  of  AGI-8702  ranged  from  1.00  to  2.40  hours.  There  were  no  notable  sex-related 
differences in the exposure of AGI-8702 on day 0 or day 27. The mean ratio of AGI-8702 exposure from 
day 27 to day 0 ranged from 0.77 to 1.34 in males, and from 0.86 to 1.16 in females. 
In the 3-month study at 0, 50,100 and 200 mg/kg, mitapivat increased the incidence of emesis at all 
doses during the dosing period (reversible). Body weight loss was observed in males and females at 100 
and 200 mg/kg/day compared to the control group and was reversible.  
The  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  was  observed  in  both  sexes  from  50  mg/kg/day.  This  effect  was 
correlated with higher liver weight in male from 50 mg/kg/day and from 100 mg/kg/day in female, it 
was  reversible  only  at  50  mg/kg/day  and  in  female  at  all  doses  (persisting  in  male  at  100  and  200 
mg/kg/day.) The NOAEL was 200 mg/kg/day. The dosage level of 200 mg/kg/day resulted in Day 90 
mean Cmax values of 2,420 ng/mL and 3,180 ng/mL and mean AUC0-12hr values of 10,400 hr•ng/mL 
and  14,600  hr•ng/mL  (2.9-  and  4.1-fold  the  human  AUC0-12hr  value  at  50  mg  BID)  for  males  and 
females, respectively.

There were no consistent sex-related differences in the TK of mitapivat. Mitapivat exposure increased 
with  increasing  dose,  and  dose  proportionality  varied  across  doses.  Accumulation  ratios  ranged  from 
0.414 to 1.24 in males, and from 0.642 to 1.27 in females. AGI-8702 was rapidly formed after mitapivat 
dosing, with mean tmax ranging from 1.2 to 3.2 hours. There were no consistent sex-related differences 
in  the  TK  of  AGI-8702.  AGI-8702  exposure  increased  with  increasing  dose,  and  dose  proportionality 
varied across doses. The mean ratio of AGI-8702 exposure from day 90 to day 0 ranged from 0.456 to 
0.804 in males and from 0.746 to 1.03 in females. 
During  the  9-month  study  in  monkey,  mitapivat  increased  the  incidence  of  emesis  at  all  doses.  A 
reversible white area in liver was observed in females at 200 mg/kg. From 50 mg/kg/day, hepatocellular 
hypertrophy  and  minimal  pigment  in  the  Kupffer  cells;  minimal  subcapsular  hepatocellular 
inflammation/necrosis), lung (minimal to mild pigmented macrophages), and lymph nodes (minimal to 
mild pigmented macrophages) in the 50, 100, and/or 200 mg/kg/day group males and/or females, and 
in the adrenal cortex (increases in incidence and severity of diffuse hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata 
correlating with higher adrenal gland weights) in the 100 and 200 mg/kg/day female group at the week 
39  primary  necropsy.  The  pigment  nature  was  not  determined  from  examination  of  special  stains, 
although  the  pigment  stained  similarly  in  the  same  tissue  between  the  control  and  test  animals, 
suggesting it was present in the control animals but exacerbated by administration of mitapivat. 
Mitapivat was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, with mean tmax ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 hours. There 
were  no  consistent  sex-related  differences  in  mitapivat  exposure.  Increases  in  dose  from  50  to  100 
mg/kg/day  and  from  100  to  200  mg/kg/day  resulted  in  approximately  dose-proportional  increases  in 
mitapivat exposure on all days. Accumulation ratios ranged from 0.593 to 0.998 in males and from 0.696 
to 1.39 in females. There were no consistent sex-related differences in AGI-8702 exposure. Increases in 
dose  from  50  to  100  mg/kg/day  and  from  100  to  200  mg/kg/day  resulted  in  approximately  dose-
proportional increases in AGI-8702 exposure on all days. The mean ratio of  AGI-8702 exposure from 
day 90, 180, or 270 to Day 0 ranged from 0.704 to 1.04 in males and from 0.738 to 1.06 in females. 
Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day for males and 100 
mg/kg/day for females. These dosage levels corresponded to mean AUC0-12hr values were 4,370 and 
8,040 ng•hr/mL (1.2- and 2.2-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID) and mean Cmax values 
were 1,570 and 2,350 ng/mL for males and females, respectively, on Day 270. 
The  applicant  provided  a  comparison  between  animal  exposure  and  human  exposure.  Margins  of 
exposure were determinate on AUC0-12hours in blood on the final TK sampling day in each study and 
the exposure in blood at the maximum dose recommended in human (50 mg BID). The safety margins 
are acceptable even if they are low. Indeed, the severity was of relative significance and effects were 
reversible in most of cases. 
2.4.3.3.  Genotoxicity 
Mitapivat and AGI-8702 were tested in a non–GLP-compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. 
typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA97a, and E. coli tester strain WP2 uvrA in the 
presence and absence of rat liver S9 at the doses of 0.075, 0.25, 0.75, 2.5, 7.5, 25, 75, and 250 μg per 
well. Under the conditions of this assay, mitapivat and AGI-8702 were nonmutagenic.  
Mitapivat was tested in a GLP-compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium tester 
strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 and E. coli tester strain WP2 uvrA in the presence and absence 
of  rat  liver  S9.  Mitapivat  dose  levels  tested  were  50,  150,  500,  1,500,  and  5,000  μg  per  plate.  No 
mutagenic responses were observed with any of the tester strains in either the presence or absence of 
S9 activation. The metabolite of mitapivat, AGI-8702, was identified in a non–GLP-compliant analysis to 
be present over the concentrations tested in the S9 portion of the treatment at 298 to 3,840 ng/mL, 
which corresponds to 0.77 to 10 μg per plate, respectively. Under those conditions of the study, mitapivat 
was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay.  
Mitapivat was tested in a GLP-compliant in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test using HPBLs in both 
the absence and presence of a S9 activation system at doses ranged from 35 to 500 μg/mL. Based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 30/187 
 
 
 
the findings of this study, mitapivat was negative for the induction of micronuclei in both nonactivated 
and S9-activated test systems in the in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test using HPBLs. 
In this GLP-compliant study mitapivat was evaluated for its clastogenic activity and/or disruption of the 
mitotic apparatus by detecting micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocyte (PCE) cells in rat bone marrow. 
Test and/or control article formulations were administered at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg by oral gavage 
twice within a 24-hour period. The administration of mitapivat at doses up to and including 2,000 mg/kg 
did  not  induce  a  significant  increase  in  the  incidence  of  MPCEs,  and  mitapivat  was  negative  in  the 
micronucleus assay. 
2.4.3.4.  Carcinogenicity 
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in male and female rats some neoplastic and nonneoplastic findings 
were observed. The target organs are liver, pancreas, thyroid and ovary but most of those effects were 
minimal and observed in control group as well. However, neoplastic lesions in the liver and thyroid at 
300 mg/kg and preneoplastic lesions in the liver of males at all dose levels and females at 200 mg/kg/day 
were observed and are most likely related to known effects of mitapivat on CYP enzyme induction and 
associated  with  hepatocellular  changes  (centrilobular  hypertrophy).  In  the  pancreas  of  males,  acinar 
adenoma and hyperplasia were observed at an increased incidence and/or severity at ≥30 mg/kg/day, 
however  pancreatic  findings  were  within  the  range  of  historical  control  data  at  ≤100  mg/kg/day,  and 
were outside the historical control data range only at 300 mg/kg/day. The ovary atrophy was observed 
in  control  group  and  treatment  group  thus  this  effect  was  not  significant.  However,  there  was  an 
increased incidence and severity of granulosa and/or luteal/granulosa cell hyperplasia as well as a slightly 
increased incidence of corpus luteum atrophy at 200 mg/kg/day. 
Twice  daily  oral  administration  of  AG-348  for  up  to  95  weeks  to  Sprague-Dawley  rats  resulted  in 
neoplastic lesions in the liver and thyroid of males at 300 mg/kg/day and pre-neoplastic lesions in the 
liver of males at all dose levels and females at 200 mg/kg/day most likely related to known effects of 
AG-348  on  cytochrome  p450  enzyme  induction  and  associated  hepatocellular  changes  (centrilobular 
hypertrophy). Beyond this effect, there was no evidence that AG-348 treatment caused de novo tumour 
types or promoted rare tumour types within the liver. 
Additionally in the pancreas of males acinar adenoma and hyperplasia were observed at an increased 
incidence and/or severity at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, however the pancreatic findings were within the range of 
historical control data at ≤ 100 mg/kg/day, and were outside the historical control data range only at 
300 mg/kg/day. 
The applicant provided three studies of 5 and 28 days in CByB6F1 mice and 26 weeks in CByB6F1/Tg 
rasH2 Hemizygous mice.  
The 5-day study was conducted at doses of 0, 1100, 300, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. The highest dose led 
to  the  death  of  3  animals  in  main  cohort  (30%).  Clinical  signs  of  decreased  motor  activity,  labored 
breathing, thin, hunched, and/or ruffled fur were noted at 1000 mg/kg/dose BID in males and females 
at the detailed observation. Mitapivat was associated with lower mean body weight parameters in males 
and females at 1000 mg/kg/dose BID.  
The 28-day study was conducted at mitapivat doses of 0, 300, 750 and 1500 mg/kg/day in 10 animals 
/sex/group. Mortality was observed at the highest dose at day 2 and 12 (20% M and 30% F) and was 
related  to  mitapivat  without  micro  or  macroscopic  findings.  At  300  mg/kg/dose  in  males  and  750 
mg/kg/dose in both sexes, liver organ weight increased and centrilobular hypertrophy were observed. 
Female reproductive tract changes included increased incidence of metestrus noted at 750 mg/kg/dose. 
Uterine atrophy, decreased incidence of corpora lutea, and increased incidence of metestrus were noted 
at 300 and 750 mg/kg/dose.  
The 26-week study in CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 hemizygous has not shown carcinogenicity at ≤ 500mg/kg/day 
in  male  and  at  ≤  250mg/kg/day  in  females.  No  mortality  was  observed  and  no  test  article–related 
neoplastic  or  non-neoplastic  changes  were  observed  microscopically  in  mice  administered  mitapivat. 
Assessment report

Microscoping  findings  observed  in  mice  receiving  mitapivat  (spleen,  lung  or papilloma/squamous  cell) 
were  not  significant  because  they  were  also  observed  in  control  group.  The  various  other  neoplastic 
lesions observed in other tissues/organs were generally typical of those commonly encountered in rats 
of this strain and age range and were not considered AG-348-related. The tumour incidences were within 
the range of spontaneous occurrence reported in aged SD rats and/or lacked a dose relationship. 
2.4.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A full programme of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies was performed in rats and rabbits. 
In  rats,  treatment-related  effects  male  reproductive  organs  organs  were  observed  at  doses  ≥ 150 
mg/kg/day.  They  consisted  in  bilateral  small  testes,  degeneration  of  seminiferous  tubules,  spermatid 
retention and residual bodies as well as an increased incidence of cellular debris in the epididymides. 
These pathological findings correlated with decreased sperm motility and density and increased numbers 
of abnormal sperm (detached or no head)). These changes were reversible following a recovery period 
corresponding to one spermatogenic cycle, and were not associated with adverse outcomes on mating 
and fertility when male animals were mated with untreated females. Since fertility assessment in test 
animals has limited sensitivity as a measure of reproductive injury, the paternal NOAEL for effects on 
fertility is considered at 60 mg/kg/day based on the adverse effects on sperm parameters and testes. In 
female rats, reversible decreases in the number of oestrous stages and in progesterone levels were seen 
at  200  mg/kg/day;  these  effects  were  not  associated  with  adverse  outcomes  on  mating,  fertility, 
histology of reproductive tissues, or early embryonic development.  
In  the  embryo-foetal  toxicity  conducted  in  rats,  mitapivat  was  demonstrated  to  induce  embryo-
fetolethality,  fetotoxicity  and  teratogenicity  at  the  maternotoxic  dose  of  200  mg/kg/day  inducing 
exposure levels well-above those reached at the MRHD (x63). Treatment-related external malformations 
were reported in 5 fetuses from 5 litters, and included notably omphalocele (2 fetuses from 2 litters) 
with other malformations affecting the whole fetus, face, trunk, ear, head, vertebrae, and eye. Visceral 
and  skeletal  malformations  were  also  reported  in  one  fetus  each  (narrow  pulmonary  trunk,  skull 
anomaly).  The  developmental  NOAEL  was  determined  at  50  mg/kg/day.  In  the  rabbit  embryo-foetal 
development study, fetotoxicity (decreased fetal weights) was noted in presence of maternotoxicity at 
the high dose level of 125 mg/kg/day. The developmental NOAEL was determined at 60 mg/kg/day. 
In  the  rat  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study,  increased  perinatal  mortality  was  reported  at  200 
mg/kg/day in relation to drug-induced dystocia/prolonged parturition and associated maternal mortality 
at ≥50 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effect on the postnatal development of F1 offspring, notably 
on their sexual maturation, learning and memory, and reproductive capacity was reported at doses up 
to 50 mg/kg/day. This was the highest dose level evaluated for such endpoints due to excessive mortality 
of F1 animals at 200 mg/kg/day during the preweaning phase. Based on these results, the no-observed-
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for general toxicity in the F0 generation females was 20 mg/kg/day and 
reproductive toxicity in the F1 generation males and females was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day. 
In  the  definitive  juvenile  rat  toxicity  study  designed  to  support  trial  in  children  above  1  year  of  age, 
histopathological findings in testes (dilation of seminiferous tubules) were noted at ≥30 mg/kg/day with 
secondary  findings  at  ≥150  mg/kg/day  in  testes  (degeneration/atrophy)  and  epididymides  (cellular 
debris). These effects were associated with altered sperm quality at 300 mg/kg/day. Reduced mating, 
fertility  and  pregnancy  indices  were  also  observed  at  ≥150  mg/kg/day  when  males  were  mated  to 
untreated females, with additional decreased implantations and increased postimplantation losses at 300 
mg/kg/day.  Following  an  off-dose  period  of  13  weeks  (more  than  one  spermatogenic  cycle), 
histopathological  findings  at  ≥150  mg/kg/day  were  only  partially  reversed,  and  not  associated  with 
adverse effects on other endpoints. In treated females mated to untreated males, findings were similar 
to those reported in adult animals with mainly increased perinatal mortality at ≥50 mg/kg/day associated 
with  dystocia/prolonged  parturition  and  mortality  in  maternal  animals.  At  200  mg/kg,  oestrous  cycle 
length was prolonged. These findings were shown to be reversible. Regarding growth, it is noted that 
the body weight of males at the high dose level of 300 mg/kg/day was decreased vs. controls, and this 
effect  was  not  clearly  reversed  after  a  13-week  recovery  period.  There  were  also  changes  in  bone

densitometry  parameters  at  all  dose  levels  in  femur  metaphysis  and  diaphysis,  with  significant 
differences vs. controls still noted in diaphysis at the end of recovery at ≥150 mg/kg/day. The applicant 
explains that they are not viewed as adverse due to their minimal nature and partial recovery. However, 
historical  control  values  are  not  available  for  such  parameters.  In  addition,  the  difference  vs.  control 
group for some parameters was even greater at the end of the non-dosing period compared to the end 
of dosing period (e.g. total area 14-16%, endosteal circumference 13-16%, CMSI 26-28%). In female 
animals treated at ≥50 mg/kg, a persistent increase in body weight was reported with reversible changes 
in bone mass/density at femur metaphysis. There was no adverse treatment-related effect on memory, 
learning, ambulation, fine movement, and habituation at any dose level, i.e. up to 300 mg/kg/day in 
males  and  200  mg/kg/day  in  females.  On  PND  97,  the  AUC(0-12)  was  5430,  79000,  and  223000 
hr.ng/mL in males at 30, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively, and 6480, 72000, 215000 hr.ng/mL in 
females at 10, 50, and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
2.4.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to current guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use (2006- EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), the applicant performed a phase I for the ERA. The 
partition  coefficient  of  mitapivat  was  determined  at  3  pH  levels  and  all  values  were  below  4.5  (ie, 
logDow=0.3 [pH 5], 1.8 [pH 7], and 1.6 [pH 9]). Therefore, mitapivat is not considered to be a PBT or 
a  vPvB  substance.  The  Phase  I  PECSURFACEWATER  of  mitapivat  (0.0026  μg/L)  does  not  exceed  the 
action limit of 0.01 μg/L.  
As mitapivat has known off-target aromatase inhibitory properties, it was evaluated whether this activity 
could  cause  potential  adverse  ecological  effects  at  the  PECSURFACEWATER.  This  was  performed  in  2 
ways: the lowest NOAEL observed in reproductive studies in any species was compared with the expected 
tissue concentration in fish, and the potential for a pharmacological response in fish was estimated using 
the fish plasma model.  
The  environmental  assessment  based  on  nonclinical  data  indicates  that  the  predicted  tissue 
concentration  in  fish,  at  the  PECSURFACWATER,  is  6  orders of  magnitude lower  than the  mammalian 
NOAEL. The ER derived by the fish plasma model is far above 1, indicating a large safety margin and a 
low risk potential to fish. 
Despite of the fact that mitapivat has off-target aromatase inhibitor activity, no environmental effects 
are  expected  at  the  PECSURFACEWATER  and  mitapivat  is  not  expected  to  affect  the  reproduction  of 
vertebrate  or  lower  animals  at  concentrations  lower  than  0.01  μg/L.  Therefore,  no  Phase  II 
environmental assessment is needed. 
However, although the fish plasma model may be acceptable from a scientific point of view, this test is 
not validated (OECD) and the applicant has committed to perform the regulatory tests according to the 
requirements of the ERA/OECD guidelines (234), and submit the results of the study as a post approval 
measure. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease with hundreds of mutant alleles described. 
The main mutation found in Caucasian patients with PK deficiency are R510Q (40%) and R486W (30%) 
approximately.  
In  an  in  vitro  study,  in  human  RBCs  (patients  with  distinct  genotypes  of  PK  deficiency),  mitapivat 
increased  ATP  levels  and  decreased  2.3-DPG  and  PhosphoEnolPyruvate  (PEP)  after  3  to  24  hours  of 
exposure  to  mitapivat  in  patients  with  PKR  mutations  (Patient  A:  R510Q/G511R;  Patient  B: 
R486W/D390N;  Patient  C:  A495V/E241stop;  Patient  D:  R510Q/E241stop).  Mitapivat  treatment  of 
pyruvate kinase-deficient RBCs resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PKR activity.

Mitapivat was evaluated in anaemia mice (Hbbth3/+) versus WT mice during 21 days at 50 mg/kg BID 
oral gavage or 100 mg/kg diet and 56-day study diet: 100 mg/kg. In anaemic mice at 50 mg/kg, an 
increase of haemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume was observed as well as a decrease of absolute 
reticulocyte count. An increase of ATP levels was observed in peripheral blood after 21 days in Hbbth3/+ 
mice (50 mg/kg BID). Moreover, a decrease of apoptotic erythroblasts from spleen and bone marrow 
and a decrease of levels of reactive oxygen species in erythroblasts in bone marrow (P<0.05 vs vehicle 
control) were observed in anaemia mice. 
The pertinence of anaemia mice model is questionable, it would have been interesting to assess mitapivat 
(and its metabolite) in an in vivo model of deficiency PK mice if available. However, assessment of NFS 
and haematology parameters sufficiently proves efficacy of mitapivat on anaemia.   
Mitapivat and its metabolite AGI 8702 were assessed for their potential to inhibit binding and enzymatic 
activity in a panel of 91 receptors, ion channels, and enzymes, including Histamine receptors and CYP19 
aromatase.    AGI8702  showed  no  inhibition  of  binding  to  histamine  receptor  (H1  H2  and  H3)  and  to 
aromatase  (highest  concentration  tested  10  µM).    Mitapivat  inhibits  by  55  and  64%  the  H1  and  H2 
receptors but with no functional activity. However, with 72% binding inhibition of H3 receptor, mitapivat 
has a functional antagonism activity (IC50 = 0.102)) and an inverse agonism activity (EC50 0.012 µM). 
As H3 receptor is present in brain, lung and gastrointestinal tract, an inhibition should have effects on 
behaviour or gastrointestinal effect.  
Mitapivat is extensively metabolised in the liver with high clearance. The main cytochromes implicated 
in metabolism of mitapivat in human liver microsomes are CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. All metabolites found in 
human were found in at least one of other species in vitro and in vivo. All metabolites were characterised 
and  were  found  under  10%,  excepted  metabolites  M396  or  AGI-8702  found  at  33%  in  human 
hepatocytes and > 50 % in human liver microsomal incubation; in rats this metabolite was found at > 
60% in liver microsomal incubation and at 23 % in male and 21% in female in vivo. All studies have 
evaluated mitapivat and its metabolite according to ICH M3 guideline.  
The applicant provided 3 non-GLP compliant single dose studies in rats, dogs and monkeys. The dogs 
were a hypersensitive species, thus the applicant has preferred the use of rat and monkeys only for the 
repeat dose toxicity studies.  
The  applicant  performed  GLP-compliant  regulatory  studies  such  as  28-days,  3-months  and  6-months 
pivotal studies in rats and 28-days, 3-months and 9-months pivotal studies in monkeys. Regarding the 
variability of exposure between male and female rats, different dose levels were used to attain similar 
drug  exposure.  As  there  is  no  difference  between  men  and  women  in  the  clinical  data  in  humans,  it 
suggests that this is an effect related to the species without clinical relevance. 
In  the  first  pivotal  study  in  rats,  the  death  was  considered  likely  traumatic  in  origin  and  was  not 
considered test article related. The clinical observation, such as clear material around the mouth, was 
only observed 1-2 hours post dose at highest dose and was fully resolved during the recovery period. 
The  haematology  and  coagulation  parameters  were  impacted  by  mitapivat  but  were  related  to  the 
mechanism of action. All changes observed on serum chemistry were reversible.  
In studies in rats, the incidence of microscopic findings generally increased with dose and effect and was 
more pronounced in males than in females. The main target organs are adrenal gland, liver, reproductive 
organ male and female, kidney and thyroid. The impact on male and female reproductive organs was 
related to the inhibition of CYP19 aromatase by mitapivat. Findings on reproductive organs seen in repeat 
dose toxicity studies  have been reflected in the SmPC Section 5.3. 
In monkeys, mitapivat was well tolerated in the 28-day study at all doses (0, 20, 50 and 150 mg/kg/day). 
No test article–related clinical observations or effects on body weight or food consumption were noted. 
There  were  no  test  article–related  alterations  in  clinical  pathology  parameters  or  ophthalmic, 
electrocardiography, macroscopic, or microscopic findings. Only a reversible increase of liver weight at 
150 mg/kg/day was observed in male and female. In the 3-month study at 0, 50,100 and 200 mg/kg, 
mitapivat  increased  the  incidence  of  emesis  at  all  doses  during  the  dosing  period  (reversible).  Body

weight  loss  was  observed  in  males  and  females  at  100  and  200  mg/kg/day  compared  to  the  control 
group and was reversible.  
The hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in the 3-month study in both sexes from 50 mg/kg/day. 
This effect was correlated with higher liver weight in male from 50 mg/kg/day and from 100 mg/kg/day 
in female, it was reversible only at 50 mg/kg/day and in female at all doses (persisting in male at 100 
and 200 mg/kg/day.)  
During  the  9-month  study  in  monkey,  mitapivat  increased  the  incidence  of  emesis  at  all  doses.  A 
reversible white area in liver was observed in females at 200 mg/kg. From 50 mg/kg/day, hepatocellular 
hypertrophy  and  minimal  pigment  in  the  Kupffer  cells;  minimal  subcapsular  hepatocellular 
inflammation/necrosis), lung (minimal to mild pigmented macrophages), and lymph nodes (minimal to 
mild pigmented macrophages) and in the adrenal cortex (increases in incidence and severity of diffuse 
hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata correlating with higher adrenal gland weights).  
The  applicant  provided  a  comparison  between  animal  exposure  and  human  exposure.  Margins  of 
exposure were determinate on AUC0-12hours in blood on the final TK sampling day in each study and 
the exposure in blood at the maximum dose recommended in human (50 mg BID). The safety margins 
are acceptable even if they are low. Indeed, the severity was of relative significance and effects were 
reversible in most of cases. 
Mitapivat was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Mitapivat was not 
clastogenic  in  an  in  vitro  human  lymphocyte  micronucleus  assay,  or  in  an  in  vivo  rat  bone  marrow 
micronucleus assay. 
Mitapivat  was  not  carcinogenic  in  transgenic  rasH2  mice  in  male  mice  at  500mg/kg/day  (6.4-fold 
difference in human exposure) and 250 mg/kg/day (2.6-fold difference in human exposure) in female 
mice twice daily for a minimum of 26 weeks. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in male and female rats 
some  neoplastic  and  non-neoplastic  findings  were  observed.  The  target  organs  are  liver,  pancreas, 
thyroid and ovary but most of those effects were minimal and observed in control group as well. However, 
neoplastic lesions in the liver and thyroid at 300 mg/kg and preneoplastic lesions in the liver of males at 
all dose levels and females at 200 mg/kg/day were observed and are most likely related to known effects 
of  mitapivat  on  CYP  enzyme  induction  and  associated  with  hepatocellular  changes  (centrilobular 
hypertrophy). In the pancreas of males, acinar adenoma and hyperplasia were observed at an increased 
incidence  and/or  severity  at  ≥30  mg/kg/day,  however  pancreatic  findings  were  within  the  range  of 
historical control data at ≤100 mg/kg/day, and were outside the historical control data range only at 300 
mg/kg/day. The ovary atrophy was observed in control group and treatment group thus this effect was 
not  significant.  However,  there  was  an  increased  incidence  and  severity  of  granulosa  and/or 
luteal/granulosa cell hyperplasia as well as a slightly increased incidence of corpus luteum atrophy at 
200 mg/kg/day. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies,  reversible  effects  on  sperm  quality  and  male 
reproductive  tissues  were reported in  rats,  hence  the  safety  margin  for  male reproductive  capacity  is 
considered to amount to 6 based on a NOAEL of 60 mg/kg/day for the abovementioned parameters. No 
effects were reported on female fertility at exposure levels nearly 50-fold higher than those reached in 
humans. As regards embryo-fetal development, a safety margin of 13 can be derived based on the rat 
study considering the adverse effects (malformations and embryo-fetal lethality) reported at 63-fold the 
human exposure. Effects reported in rabbits were less severe, however lower exposure levels could be 
attained in that species with foetotoxicity (decreased fetal weight) noted at 3-fold the human exposure 
levels, and a developmental NOAEL determined at exposure levels similar to those reached in humans. 
In  the  rat  pre-  and  post-natal  development  study,  increased  perinatal  mortality  was  reported  at  200 
mg/kg/day in relation to drug-induced dystocia/prolonged parturition and associated maternal mortality; 
no  treatment-related  effect  on  the  postnatal  development  of  F1  offspring,  notably  on  their  sexual 
maturation, learning and memory, and reproductive capacity was reported at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day 
which  represents  approximately  13-fold  the  human  exposure  based  on  TK  data  obtained  in  the 
embryofoetal  development  study.  It  is  noted  that  rat  seems  to  be  more  sensitive  than  humans  to 
Assessment report

inhibition of  aromatase  based  on  4-fold  lower  IC50  values  determined in  vitro  for  the  rat  aromatase. 
However, a cautious approach is suggested in the clinical setting since some adverse effects reported in 
patients  would  be  in  line  with  aromatase  inhibition  (see  SmPC  section  4.8:  changes  in  oestradiol, 
oestrone, and testosterone levels; as well as hot flush). 
A  programme  of  juvenile  toxicity  studies  was  conducted  in  rats  in  line  with  the  PIP  adopted  for 
development of mitapivat for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency in children aged 1 year and 
above. In general, the toxicological profile of mitapivat (target organs) in this study was in line with that 
defined  in  the  adult  rat  studies  with  aromatase-related  adverse  effects  noted  on  male  and  female 
animals. Juvenile rats appear as more sensitive than adults for effects on the reproductive tract since 
histopathological  findings  were  seen  at  lower  dose/exposure  levels,  did  not  fully  reverse,  and  were 
associated  with  adverse  effects  on  mating  and  fertility  indices.  Changes  in  bone  densitometry  values 
were also reported, and it is not certain that they should be viewed as non-adverse and non-relevant to 
humans considering also the adverse bone effects reported in the clinical setting with other aromatase 
inhibitors (bone loss) and the data suggesting aromatase inhibition in patients treated with mitapivat 
(see SmPC section 4.8), respectively. The main findings of the juvenile rat toxicity study were reported 
in SmPC section 5.3. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Mitapivat PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, mitapivat is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
As mitapivat has off-target aromatase inhibitor activity an evaluation was performed to determine the 
potential impact on fish. It is to be noted that the applicant provided a fish plasma model that may be 
acceptable from a scientific point of view. However, this test is not validated (OECD).  
Therefore, the applicant has committed to performing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) 234 Fish Sexual Development Test and providing the results as a post approval 
measure, which is acceptable.

The CHMP considers that Pyrukynd can be granted a marketing authorisation from a non-clinical point 
of view. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Mitapivat  (AG-348),  a  new  chemical  entity,  is  a  first-in-class,  orally  bioavailable,  potent,  allosteric 
activator of wild-type red blood cell (RBC)-specific form of pyruvate kinase (PKR) and a range of mutant 
PKR  enzymes.  Mitapivat  targets  the  underlying  enzymatic  defect  that  causes  haemolysis  in  pyruvate 
kinase deficiency by restoring the activity of mutant forms of PKR. 
In the current submission, the applicant seeks marketing approval for mitapivat, for the treatment of 
adult patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency. 
The proposed recommended starting dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily, which should be increased 
sequentially every 4 weeks to 20 mg twice daily and then 50 mg twice daily. Such titration phase (from 
5 to 50 mg BID) is haemoglobin (Hb) level dependent. Hb level should be assessed before increasing to 
the next dose level as some patients may reach and maintain normal Hb levels at 5 mg twice daily or 20 
mg twice daily. The maximum recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. 
The drug product for registration is a film coated tablet containing mitapivat sulfate hydrate proposed at 
three strengths 5 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Introduction 
Mitapivat sulfate hydrate is a small molecule, with a molecular weight of 1053.23 Da (450.6 Da as free 
base). 
Additionally  to  non-clinical  pharmacokinetics  studies  (in  vitro  metabolite  profiling,  CYP  inhibition  and 
induction, P-gp substrate evaluation, and protein binding), the clinical pharmacology investigations of 
mitaprivat consisted of 7 clinical studies in healthy adult volunteers (HV). These studies were designed 
to  provide  further  information  on  mitaprivat  including  ADME  properties,  food  interaction,  drug 
interactions, effect on QT.  
Additional  information  was  collected  from  studies  performed  in  adult  patients  with  two  supporting 
ongoing  studies  (Phase  2  study  AG348-C-003,  and  Phase  3  Extension  Study  AG348-C-011)  and  two 
pivotal completed Phase 3 studies (studies AG348-C-006 and AG348-C-007).  
PK data from both adult patients and HV were used to develop a Population PK model, from which only 
PK/PD data from adult patients were used for exposure-response analysis. PBPK models were developed 
to predict DDI.

Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
Throughout the clinical development, two bioanalytical methods were developed to quantify, mitapivat 
and its main metabolite (N-dealkylated metabolite: AGI-8702) in human K2EDTA plasma. Overall, the 
used methods appears to be adequate and comply with acceptance criteria of the bioanalytical method 
validation following the CHMP guideline. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses 
PK data were analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling. 
Standard non-compartmental (model-independent) pharmacokinetic methods were used to calculate PK 
parameters. 
Pharmacokinetics  of  mitapivat  were  investigated  by  population  pharmacokinetic  modelling  using  a 
nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach.  
Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  (PK-PD)  and  exposure-response  analyses  were  performed  using 
model-derived pharmacokinetic metrics, assessing the relationship between mitapivat concentration and 
haemoglobin measure, and parameters for efficacy and safety, respectively. 
Model evaluation and selection were based on commonly used statistical and graphical criteria.  
Absorption  
Following single dose of mitapivat between 30 mg to 2500 mg in healthy volunteers (Study AG348C-
001), absorption was reasonably rapid with Cmax approximately achieved at median Tmax of 0.77-1.01 
hours, for doses up to 360 mg. Above the 360 mg dose observed median Tmax ranged from 1.49 to 
4.07 hours (700 to 2500 mg). Mean Cmax ranged from 461 to 25477 ng/mL (30 mg to 2500 mg). 
Following multiple-dosing of mitaprivat at doses between 15 mg to 700 mg BID in healthy volunteers 
(Study  AG348C-002),  absorption  was  reasonably  rapid  with  Cmax  approximately  achieved  at  median 
Tmax ranging from 0.5 to 1.02 hours after 14 days, Cmax ranged from 255 to 5830 ng/mL. 
Absolute bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of mitapivat has been investigated as part of Study AG348-C-009 and was 
estimated at 72.7% 
Relative bioavailability/ Bioequivalence 
Throughout the clinical development, two formulations were used, a capsule (strength 5, 25 and 100 
mg), and a film-coated tablet (strength at 5, 20 and 50 mg). The commercial formulation is the same 
as the tablet formulation used in the pivotal Phase 3 studies (AG348-C-006 and AG348-C-007), differing 
only in the nonfunctional printing. 
A  relative  bioavailability  study  (AG348-C-005)  was  performed  in  a  crossover  design  between  the  two 
formulations at a 50 mg dose. Results of this study indicated that compared to capsule, with the tablet 
formulation Tmax was shorter with a median difference of -0.5 h, Cmax and AUCs were 19% and 5% 
higher, other PK parameters were similar (CL/F, Vz/F). 
Influence of food 
The effect of a standardised high fat meal on mitapivat PK was investigated in healthy subjects using 
the capsule formulation (Study AG348-C-001) or the tablet formulation (Study AG348-C-014).  
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 39/187 
 
 
 
In  Study  AG348-C-001,  the  effect  of  a  high  fat  meal  on  mitapivat  PK  was  investigated  in  5  healthy 
volunteers who were administered a single oral dose of 700 mg mitapivat (capsule formulation) in the 
fasted and the fed states. PK results indicated that administration of a high fat meal decreased Tmax by 
0.56 h decreased Cmax by 7.7% and slightly increased AUC0-∞ by 4.3%. 
In  Study  AG348-C-014,  the  effect  of  a  high  fat  meal  on  mitapivat  PK  was  investigated  in  31  healthy 
volunteers  who  were  administered  a  single  oral  dose  of  100  mg  mitapivat  (film-coated  tablet)  in  the 
fasted and the fed states. PK results indicated that administration of a high fat meal delayed Tmax by 
2.25 h decreased Cmax by 42% with similar AUC0-∞. 
Distribution 
Mitapivat has a 97.7% protein binding, a B/P below 1. Mitapivat is extensively distributed in tissue with 
Vz estimated at 135 L. 
Elimination 
Across clinical studies in healthy volunteers, after single oral dose from 30 mg to 2500 mg (Study AG348-
C-001), estimated half-life ranged from 17.8 to 79.3 h. After multiple doses from 15 mg BID to 700 mg 
BID, estimated half-life ranged from 32.2 to 194 h. 
In healthy volunteers, CL/F ranged from 10.3 to 14.4 L/h. Mitapivat clearance increased in a time and 
dose dependent manner after multiple doses. An auto-induction of clearance modelled as an exponential 
increase to steady-state was considered in the PopPK analysis. In patients, based on the results from 
this analysis, the estimated CL/F on Day 1 was 10.6 L/h and at steady-state was 11.5, 12.7 and 14.4 
L/h respectively at the 5 mg BID, 20 mg BID and 50 mg BID.  
The main elimination route was hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4/5 enzymes and excretion of metabolites 
in both urine and feces.  
•  Mass balance 
The excretion and biotransformation of a 14C-radiolabeled mitapivat dose of 120 mg was investigated in 
8 healthy volunteers (Study AG348-C-009). 
The total recovery of radioactivity in this mass balance study was approximately 89.1 % with individual 
recovery ranging from 85.5 to 91.2%. Approximately 39.6 % and 49.6 % of the radioactive dose was 
recovered in feces and urine respectively, unchanged mitapivat was found at trace levels in feces (less 
than <1%) and approximately 2.62% in urine.  
The arithmetic mean CLR of mitapivat was 0.335 L/h (3.4% of total clearance of 9.87 L/h).  
•  Metabolism 
Metabolite  profiling  was  performed  and  up  to  17  metabolites  were  identified  in  the  three  matrix  (all 
representing < 10% of the total administered radioactivity). Mitapivat accounted for 57.2 % of the total 
radioactivity in plasma and no major metabolites were identified. AGI-8702 (a weak active metabolite) 
accounted for only 5.47 % of the total radioactivity in plasma, but remain the main compound excreted 
in  both  feces  and  urine,  with  18.5  %  and  24.9  %  of  the  recovered  radioactivity.  Metabolite  M642a 
accounted for 8.48% of the total radioactivity in human plasma. Approximately, 88% and 91.6% of the 
recovered radioactivity in urine and feces respectively was identified. 
Based on in vitro investigations mitapivat was found to be predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4 and 
CYP3A5, AGI-7802 formation is mediated by both.

No major plasma metabolites (≥ 10% of total compound-related material) were detected based on Study 
AG348-C-009,  nevertheless  a  thorough  assessment  of  AGI-8702  PK  was  performed  throughout  the 
clinical pharmacology programme as AGI-8702 was thought as an active metabolite. Non-clinical data 
suggests that AGI-8702 is a weakly active metabolite.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Mitapivat is dose proportional over the clinically relevant dose range of 5 to 50 mg BID in healthy subjects 
and  in  patients  with  PK  deficiency.  Across  all  the  available  clinical  studies  in  both  healthy  and  adult 
patients,  mitapivat  show no  or minimal  accumulation.  Steady  state is  generally  reached  by  Day  7-10 
after BID administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using pharmacokinetic data of healthy volunteers 
from five Phase 1 studies AG348-C-001, AG348-C-002, AG348-C-004, AG348-C-005, and AG348-C-012 
and patients with PK deficiency from studies AG348-C-003 (Phase 2), AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and 
AG348-C-011 (Phase 3). Data from Phase 1 studies AG348-C-009 and AG348-C-014, and Phase 2 Study 
AG348-C-010 were not included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. The model was developed 
directly using all data from healthy volunteers and patients included Phase 1 (AG348-C-001, AG348-C-
002, AG348-C-004, AG348-C-005, and AG348-C-012), Phase 2 (AG348-C-003), and Phase 3 (AG348-
C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011). 
In total, 4686 (95.4% of total) pharmacokinetic samples from 341 volunteers (186 healthy volunteers 
and 155 patients with PK deficiency) were used in the final model. The 155 patients with PK deficiency 
were aged 18 to 78 years (mean = 36.1 years), and 54.8 % of the patients were female and 45.2 % 
male.  Overall,  patients  with  PK  deficiency  had  slightly  lower  body  weight  (mean  69  vs  77  kg),  lower 
haemoglobin (mean 8.85 vs 14.2 g/dL), and lower haematocrit (mean 28.4% vs 41.9%) compared to 
healthy  volunteers.  Patients  with  PK  deficiency  had  much  higher  baseline  total  bilirubin  levels  than 
healthy volunteers (mean 5.58 vs 0.567 mg/dL). The majority of the healthy volunteers were of Black 
(41%) or White (41%) race, while the majority patients with PK deficiency were of White race (77%). 
The percentage of male (69% vs 45%) and Hispanic ethnicity (24% vs 2%) participants were higher in 
the healthy compared to the PK deficiency population. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers 
were prohibited in the Phase 2/3 studies. Thus, concomitant medications of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers 
were uncommon in patients with PK deficiency. 
The  final  mitapivat  population  pharmacokinetic  model  was  a  3-compartment  model  with  first-order 
absorption and a lag-time on absorption. Clearance of mitapivat was modeled as exponentially increasing 
to steady state, as a function of time (DAY) and dose (DOSE), to account for the auto-induction observed 
after multiple doses; CL/F of mitapivat increases in a dose- and time-dependent manner. IIV were found 
on CL (29 %CV, shrinkage=6.6 %), V2 (21.2 %CV, shrinkage=34.9 %), Q3 (71.8 %CV, shrinkage=20.4 
%), V3 (46.6 %CV, shrinkage=52.1 %) and Ka (89.8 %CV, shrinkage=21.1 %). Interoccasion variability 
(IOV) was estimated for Ka. ALAG was fixed to the estimated values (ALAGTablet = 0.249 h, ALAGCapsule = 
0.227 h). A proportional error model was chosen each, for healthy volunteers (δ =0.277, RSE=3.82 %, 
shrinkage = 9.1 %) and patients (δ =0.425, RSE=4.64 %, shrinkage = 9.1 %). Volumes of distribution 
(V2,  V3,  and  V4)  increased  with  increasing  body  weight,  females  had  a  slightly  lower  V2  (central 
compartment) relative to males, and CL increased with increasing haematocrit level. The impact of these 
covariates  on  mitapivat  exposure  seem  limited  with  no  clinical  relevance.  The  PK  of  mitapivat  seems 
similar between healthy volunteers and patients. Table 2 gives the post-hoc pharmacokinetic parameters 
of patients with PK deficiency.

haematocrit on Ctrough were slightly outside the window of 0.8 and 1.25; the point estimate of the Ctrough

No formal PK study investigating renal impairment on mitapivat PK was performed. Besides the effect of 
renal  impairment  on  the  PKs  of  mitapivat  was  investigated  in  patients  based  on  the  Population-PK 
approach. 
Model-based  steady-state  AUC  among  patients  with  PK  deficiency  in  different  renal  categories  were 
compared  after  administration  of  50  mg  BID.  Most  participants  had  normal  renal  function  (n=127, 
81.9%), while 24 (15.5%) had mild renal impairment and 4 (2.6%) had moderate renal impairment. 
None had severe renal impairment. Steady-state AUC was similar between participants with normal renal 
function and those with mild renal impairment. Steady-state AUC of participants with moderate renal 
impairment were numerically higher, but still within the range in subjects with normal renal function. 
•  Hepatic impairment 
No  formal  PK  study  investigating  hepatic  impairment  on  mitapivat  PK  was  performed,  but  a  study  is 
planned to investigate the hepatic impairment effect on mitapivat pharmacokinetics. Besides the effect 
of hepatic impairment on the PKs of mitapivat was investigated in patients based on the Population-PK 
approach. 
Model-based  steady-state  AUC  in  patients  with  PK  deficiency  stratified  by  liver  function  parameter 
categories were compared after administration of 50 mg BID.  
Most patients in the dataset had normal AST, ALT, and ALP at baseline. Only limited data are available 
for patients with AST values from 2 to > 3-times ULN (n=5), ALT values 2 to > 3-times ULN (n=1), and 
ALP  values  1  to  2-times  ULN  (n=6).  No  apparent  difference  in  steady-state  AUC  was  observed  in 
volunteers with normal AST, ALT, or ALP levels versus those with elevated levels.  
Most patients with PK deficiency had elevated total bilirubin level at baseline. Post-hoc steady-state AUC 
appeared similar among the PK deficiency patients with total bilirubin of 1 to 2 × ULN, 2 to 3 × ULN, and 
>3 × ULN. 
•  Gender 
No formal PK study investigating gender on mitapivat PK was performed. Besides the effect of gender 
on the PKs of mitapivat was investigated in patients based on the Population-PK approach. 
Sex was a statistically significantly covariate on the volume of distribution of the central compartment. 
Females  are  expected  to  have  lower  volume  of  distribution.  Simulations  reveal  that  female  patients 
receiving 50 mg mitapivat BID are expected to have similar exposure compared to male patients, and 
relative ratios compared to the reference patients were within the 0.8 to 1.25 range. No dose adjustment 
is warranted. 
•  Race 
A  formal  dedicated  PK  study  (AG348-C-004)  was  performed  to  investigate  a  potential  race  /ethnicity 
effect on PKs of mitapivat between Japanese and non-Asian subjects. Besides, race/ethnicity have been 
tested as a covariate in the population-PK analysis.  
From Study AG348-C-004, in Japanese subjects, at the recommended dose of 50 mg, compared to non-
Asian subjects, Cmax was increased by 15% and AUCs remain generally similar.  
Race was not a statistically significantly covariate. No dose adjustment is warranted. 
•  Weight 
Weight  was  a  statistically significantly  covariate  on all  volumes of  distribution.  Simulations  for  50  mg 
BID dosing reveal that AUCsteady-state is comparable for patients weighing 45 or 95 kg compared to the 
typical patient (70 kg). Ctrough at steady-state is expected to be about 21 % lower and 21% higher in 
patients weighing 45 and 95 kg, respectively. Overall, the median exposures were within the 0.8 to 1.25 
range.  The  expected  mitapivat  exposure  in  patients  with  pyruvate  kinase  deficiency  was  in  addition 
simulated over a borader body weight range of 40 kg to 140 kg. Cmax,ss is expected to be about 27 % 
higher in patients with lower body weight (40 kg) and 24 % lower in patients with higher body weight

(140 kg). Ctrough is expected to be about 26 % and 22 % lower in patients with lower body weight (40 kg 
and 45 kg, respectively) and 49 % higher in patients with higher body weight (140 kg).

Elderly 
The 155 patients with PK deficiency included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis were aged 18 
to 78 years (mean = 36.1 years). Among the 155 patients included in the population PK analysis, only 
five patients were older than 65 years (n=4 [2.6] % aged 65 to 74 years and one patient [0.6 %] in the 
age group 75 – 84 years). Details on the number of participants per range per clinical study are provided 
in Table 4. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, all 155 subjects with pyruvate kinase deficiency 
were included. Age was not a statistically significantly covariate.

Laboratory parameters 
In the analysed Phase 3 studies, haematocrit in patients varied between 19.4 and 39.2 %. In Phase 1 
and Phase 2 studies, haematocrit values of up to 52.4 % were measured.  
Haematocrit  was  a  statistically  significantly  covariate  on  CL/F.  Simulations  reveal  that  patients  with 
haematocrit of 22 % are expected to have similar AUCsteady-state and Cmax values, while median Ctrough is 
expected to be about 22 % higher compared to patients with a haematocrit of 28 %. For patients with a 
haematocrit of 35 %, median Ctrough is expected to be about 17 % lower compared to patients with a 
haematocrit of 28 %. Overall, the expected exposures are mostly within the within the 0.8 to 1.25 range.  
In addition, model-based expected exposures over a broader range of haematocrit levels of 19 to 52 % 
were  provided.  AUC  (predictor  for  safety  measures)  is  expected  to  decrease  by  about  20  %  with 
increasing  haematocrit  (of  up  to  52  %  haematocrit).  The  decrease  in  exposure  with  increasing 
haematocrit is more pronounced for Ctrough, which is expected to decrease by 41 % for patients reaching 
52 % haematocrit levels, and by 24 % for patients reaching 39 % haematocrit levels. 
The baseline haematocrit in patients with PK deficiency was generally lower than in healthy volunteers. 
Therefore, the CL in patients with PK deficiency was generally lower. Those who responded to mitapivat 
treatment had haematocrit increasing toward normal range.  
Haemoglobin,  albumin,  total  bilirubin  Aspartate  aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  alkaline 
phosphatase,  blood  urea  nitrogen  were  non  statistically  significantly  covariates.  Patients  had  lower 
haemoglobin levels compared to healthy volunteers (mean 8.85 vs 14.2 g/dL).  
•  Children 
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat in children and adolescent patients less than 18 years old have not 
been studied.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency mutations 
Pyruvate  kinase  deficiency  mutation  type  was  not  statistically  significantly  covariate  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of mitapivat and seem not have an impact on mitapivat exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In  vitro,  mitapivat  was  identified  as  CYP3A4  and  P-gp  substrate  (CYP3A4  metabolism  responsible  for 
AGI-8702  metabolite  formation  N-dealkylated  metabolite).  Mitapivat  was  demonstrated  to  be  auto-
inhibited and auto-induced through CYP3A4 / P-gp pathway.  
The multiple-ascending dose study showed increase in mitapivat clearance and reduction in its exposure 
suggesting the overall net effect of mitapivat as (auto-) inducer of CYP3A4. 
In vivo, mass balance study in healthy subjects (Study AG348-C-009) underlined that [14C] mitapivat 
was  extensively  metabolised  in  humans  after  a  single  oral  dose,  as  <3%  and  <1%  of  the  dose  was 
excreted unchanged in urine and feces, respectively. Mitapivat metabolite, on the other hand, AGI-8702 
represented 44.4% of the total radioactivity collected in excreta (18.5% in feces and 24.9% in urine) 
but contributed to less than 25% of the parent-drug AUC. There is, thus, no need to conduct clinical DDI 
study to investigate its interaction potential. 
In  addition  to  in  vivo  clinical  studies  conducted  with  itraconzole,  and  rifampin,  mitapivat  drug-drug 
interactions was predicted based on in-silico approaches. The model accounted for mitapivat metabolism 
as followed: 
-  CYP3A4  substrate:  CYP3A4  metabolised  fraction  was  estimated  based  on  clinical  stady  with 
itraconazole; 
- CYP3A4 mechanism-based inhibition: inhibition parameter were set to in vitro values; 
- CYP3A4 induction: induction parameter were set based on best fitting of mitapivat PK at steady-state.  
The model is not considered qualified to predict mitapivat interactions with other drugs with mitapivat 
being as victim drug or perpetrator.  
Mitapivat effects on other drugs 
In vitro, mitapivat was shown to be metabolism-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, inhibitor of 
P-gp, and inducer of enzymes and transporters which expressions are regulated by CAR/PXR pathways, 
i.e. CYP3A4, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, and P-gp. Mitapivat may thus decrease CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9 and 
2C19 drug substrate concentrations.  
Clinical  net  effects  of  mitapivat  on  CYP3A4/P-gp  substrates  are  considered  unknown  (mitapivat  being 
both TDI and inducer), but it is expected mitapivat to decrease CYP3A4/P-gp substrate concentrations 
including CYP3A-sensitive hormonal contraceptives. This may also affect the latter pharmacodynamics.  
In vitro results showed mitapivat was a weak aromatase inhibitor in vitro which induced in male subjects 
increases  in  testosterone  above  normal  range  (2/16,  12.5%,  in  ACTIVATE  study)  and  decreases  in 
oestrone  and  oestradiol  below  normal  range  (9/16,  56.3%,  in  ACTIVATE  study  and  1/7,  14.3  %  in 
ACTIVATE-T study). These effects were reversible when Pyrukynd treatment was discontinued. No data 
were presented in female subjects, due to, according to the applicant, physiologic variations in hormone 
levels expected throughout the normal menstrual cycle and the various types of hormonal contraceptives 
used by patients. 
Other drugs effects on mitapivat 
Identified in vitro signal (i.e. mitapivat identified as CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate) were further assessed 
through  both  in  vivo  study  and  in  silico  simulations.  Mitapivat  showed  pH-dependent  solubility,  the 
previously built PBPK model was also used to predict mitapivat interactions with gastric acid reducing 
agent.

CYP3A inhibitor and inducer effect on mitapivat (in vivo / in silico) 
In vivo DDI study results showed that following mitapivat 20 mg single dose admistration with strong 
CYP3A4  (and  P-gp)  inhibitor  and  inducer  increase  and  decrease  mitapivat  plasma  exposure  by 
respectively approximately 5-fold and 91% following mitapivat 20 mg administration.  
Gastric acid reducing agent effect on mitapivat (in silico) 
A  combined  mitapivat  PBPK  model  with  a  PD  model  on  gastric  pH  was  used  to  assess  the  impact  of 
ranitidine co-administration on mitapivat exposure. The model is not considered qualified for this purpose. 
The outcome from interactions between mitapivat with gastric acid reducing agent is considered unknown. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mitapivat is an allosteric activator of wild-type PKR (red blood cell [RBC]-specific form of pyruvate kinase) 
and a range of mutant PKR (mPKR) enzymes.  
The  presence  of  mPKR  in  patients  with  PK  deficiency  leads  to  a  disruption  in  the  glycolytic  pathway, 
causing  accumulation  of  PEP  and  2,3-diphosphoglycerate  (2,3-DPG)  and  a  reduction  in  ATP.  This 
glycolytic defect and subsequent reduction in ATP leads to shortened reticulocyte and RBC life spans. 
Mitapivat acts by allosterically binding to the PKR tetramer and enhancing its affinity for PEP, thereby 
increasing the ability of RBCs to convert PEP + ADP to pyruvate + ATP.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study AG348-C-001 (Single Ascending Dose) 
Study  AG348-C-001  was  a  Phase  1,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  designed  to 
assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single ascending oral doses of mitapivat administered using 
a capsule formulation in sequential cohorts of healthy subjects. 
Six cohorts of 8 subjects each were randomised to receive a single dose of either mitapivat (n=6) or 
placebo (n=2). The doses of mitapivat studied were 30, 120, 360, 700, 1,400, and 2,500 mg. All doses 
were administered after a 10-hour fast, and subjects continued to fast until 4 hours postdose.

Exposure-response (E-R) analysis 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses (report AG348-PMx-002) for safety and efficacy were conducted using 
data from AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011 (safety) and studies AG348-
C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011 Cohort 1 (efficacy). 
Evaluation  of  the  relationship  between  mitapivat  exposure  and  safety  endpoints  of  interest  included 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; All Grade Insomnia and hot flush), laboratory abnormalities 
(alanine  aminotransferase  [ALT],  aspartate  aminotransferase  [AST],  total  bilirubin,  triglyceride),  and 
changes in sex hormone levels (total and free testosterone, estrone, estradiol). Endpoints for efficacy 
were haemoglobin response and transfusion burden reduction.  
Data were analysed graphically and by modelling the E-R relationship, testing different models, such as 
linear, saturable, sigmoidal, or Emax models. For the E-R relationship of efficacy only linear models were 
tested  due  to  the  number  of  limited  available  data.  If  deemed  plausible,  covariate  analyses  were 
conducted. Model selection was based on the OFV.

Data for all Grade ALT, AST, total bilirubin, triglycerides, All Grade of insomnia and hot flush elevation 
was available from 155 mitapivat- and 39 placebo-treated patients. For the 155 participants who received 
mitapivat treatment, exposure estimates could be estimated. The time-averaged mean AUC was 10.2 
μg*h/mL (median=4.89 μg*h/mL, min=0.521 μg*h/mL, max= 62.7 μg*h/mL). 
ALT and AST: For ALT, events were observed in 10 (25.7%) placebo-treated and 35 (22.6%) mitapivat-
treated  patients.  For  AST,  in  7  (17.9%)  placebo-treated  subjects  and  35  (22.6%)  mitapivat-treated 
patients. Across exposure quartiles, no apparent trend in incidence was present. A logistic regression 
confirmed the absence of a statistically significant exposure effect across the observed exposure range. 
Total  bilirubin:  Events  were  observed  in  7  (17.9%)  placebo-treated  and  11  (7.1%)  mitapivat-treated 
patients  (Table  9).  Across  exposure  quartiles,  there  was  a  tendency  of  lower  incidence  with  higher 
exposures. Logistic regression was borderline statistically significant (P=0.048). The trend of decreasing 
total  bilirubin  with  the  increase  in  mitapivat  exposure  indicated  an  improvement  in  haemolysis.  No 
covariate  evaluation  was  performed  due  to  borderline  statistically  significance  and  equally  distributed 
covariates.

Triglyceride:  Events  were  observed  in  21  (53.8%)  placebo-treated  and  62  (40.0%)  mitapivat-treated 
patients. Across exposure quartiles, incidences were somewhat lower in the second to fourth exposure 
quartile compared with the first exposure quartile. A logistic regression indicated that exposure effects 
were not statistically significant across the observed exposure range. 
All  Grade  insomnia  events  were  observed  in  7  (17.9%)  placebo-treated  and  46  (29.7%)  mitapivat-
treated patients ( 
Table  10).  No  new  or  no  worsening  of  All  Grade  insomnia  were  observed  in  82.1  %  of  the  placebo 
treated volunteers and in 70.3 % of mitapivat treated patients. Overall, an upward trend of the incidence 
of All Grade insomnia with exposure appears present. A linear logistic regression showed a significant 
exposure  effect  and  an  increasing  event  occurrence  with  increasing  exposure.  No  covariates  were

Sex  hormones  were  only  evaluated  in  male  participants.  Total  and  free  testosterone,  estrone,  and 
estradiol data were available for all 83 male patients (n=15 placebo, n=68 mitapivat-treated). Exposure 
estimates could be estimated in all 68 mitapivat-treated male subjects.  The mean time-averaged AUC 
in male patients was 11.9 μg*h/mL (median=8.5 μg*h/mL, min=0.695 μg*h/mL, max=46.1 μg*h/mL). 
The average total and free testosterone level through the Core Period (AG348-C-003) or the Fixed-Dose 
Period (studies AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011) was stratified by exposure quartiles. A 
weak trend of increased total and free testosterone with increasing mitapivat exposure was observed 
and modelled by a linear model with baseline total and free testosterone as covariates on the intercept 
and the slope. Median total testosterone increased from 26.6 nmol/L (min=13.3, max=42.4) in the 1st 
quartile to 27.9 nmol/L (min=14.3, max=42.8) in the 4th quartile ( 
Table 12). Total testosterone was higher in mitapivat treated patients compared to placebo (median 
25.5  nmol/L  vs.  18.5  nmol/L).  Median  free  testosterone  increased  from  579  pmol/L  (min=226, 
max=999) in the 1st quartile to 947 pmol/L (min=373, max=1830) in the 4th quartile (Table 13). Total 
testosterone was higher in mitapivat treated patients compared to placebo (median 612 pmol/L vs 374 
pmol/L).

A trend of decreased estrone level with increasing exposure was observed (Table 14). The magnitude of 
the effect reached a plateau at the high end of the exposure range. A linear regression applied to the 
individual data confirmed the presence of a statistically significant exposure effect across the observed 
exposure range. An Emax model resulted in a significant improvement of the fit and described best the 
data. Covariate effects were evaluated on the intercept and the maximum effect of the exposure effect. 
Baseline estrone was the only covariate that was retained in the model, both on the intercept and the 
maximum effect.

Estradiol levels were lower in mitapivat-treated patients compared with placebo, but levels were similar 
across  the  exposure  quartiles.  The  treatment  effect model  best  described the data.   Median  estradiol 
was 88.1 pmol/L (min=48.8, max=119) in the 1st quartile and 69.7 pmol/L (min=22.2, max=167) in the 
4th  quartile.  For  participants  who  received  placebo  values  were:    median=118  pmol/L  with  min=45.3 
pmol/L, max=161 pmol/L. 
Simulations  for  the  proposed  recommended  doses  showed  that  the  predicted  probability  of  All  Grade 
insomnia and All Grade hot flush slightly increased with the dose increase from 5 to 50 mg BID (

E-R for efficacy: 
Data from 57 mitapivat-treated patients, and 39 placebo-treated patients were included in the efficacy 
analyses. Of note, 17 participants who first received placebo treatment in Study AG348-C-006 and then 
rolled over to mitapivat treatment in Study AG348-C-011 were counted in both the placebo and mitapivat 
treatment groups. A total of 26 patients treated with mitapivat (titrated 5-20-50 mg) were available for 
analysis in study AG348-C-007. The mean time-averaged AUC in studies AG348-C-006 and AG348-C-
011 was 6.78 μg*h/mL (median=6,69 μg*h/mL, min=0.695 μg*h/mL, max=12.4 μg*h/mL). Exposure 
tertiles were used in the exploratory E-R plot. All 26 efficacy evaluable patients in study AG348-C-007 
had  mitapivat  exposure  estimates.    The  mean  time-averaged  AUC  was  6.51  μg*h/mL  (median=6.09 
μg*h/mL, min=2.91 μg*h/mL, max= 16.7 μg*h/mL).  Bitiles were used in the exploratory E-R plots. 
The number of haemoglobin responders, defined as a ≥1.5 g/dL increase in haemoglobin concentration 
from baseline assessed at Weeks 16, 20, and 24 during the Fixed-Dose Period, was stratified by exposure 
tertiles. After mitapivat treatment 38.6% of the patients were haemoglobin responders (Table 19). No 
significant trends with exposure were apparent (responder 1st tertile 31.6 %, 2nd tertile 36.8 %, and 3rd 
tertile  47.4  %;  placebo  0  %).  A  treatment  effect  was  observed,  but  a  statistically  significant  E-R 
relationship  was  not  identified  across  the  observed  exposure  range.  Overall,  61.4  %  were  not 
haemoglobin  responders.  A  logistic  regression  confirmed  the  absence  of  a  statistically  significant 
exposure effect across the observed exposure range.

(transfusion-burden-responder reduction 1st bitile 53.8 %, 2nd bitile 23.1 %, transfusion-free-responder 
1st bitile 38.5 %, 2nd bitile 7.7 %) which may be confounded by prior splenectomy status. Overall, 61.5

Data from Study AG348-C-003 were initially not included in the exposure-response analysis for efficacy 
because  haemoglobin  (Hb)  response  was  a  secondary  endpoint  in  the  study.  An  updated  exposure-
response  analysis  for  Hb  response  including  the  data  from  Study  AG348-C-003  has  been  performed. 
Results and conclusions from this updated analysis are consistent with those described in the original 
analysis  (Report  AG348-PMX-002)  where  a  non-statistically  significant  relationship  was  observed 
between mitapivat exposure (with doses up to 300 mg) and Hb response. 
The  updated  exposure-response  analysis  of  haemoglobin  response  included  patients  from  Studies 
AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006, and AG348-C-011 Cohort 1 for whom mitapivat AUC could be estimated, 
as well as the placebo-treated participants in Study AG348-C-006. The exposure metric was the time-
averaged AUC across the Core Period (Study AG348-C-003) or Fixed-Dose Period (Studies AG348-C-006 
and AG348-C-011). Data from 99 mitapivat-treated and 39 placebo-treated patients were included. The 
mean time-averaged AUC for the 99 patients was 10.3 µg*h/mL (standard deviation = 8.05 µg*h/mL). 
The  median  time-averaged  AUC  was  7.62  µg*h/mL  (min=  0.695  µg*h/mL,  max=46.2  µg*h/mL).  
Covariate  distributions  for  continuous  and  categorical  covariates  based  on  the  exposure  tertile  were 
summarised (not shown here). There were no Hb responders with placebo treatment, while 41.4% of 
the  patients  achieved  Hb  response  after  mitapivat  treatment.  No  apparent  exposure-response 
relationship was observed. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted,  including  10  participants  with  the  nonmissense/nonmissense 
mutations from Study AG348-C-003; all 10 participants were Hb nonresponders. Thus, in the sensitivity 
analysis dataset, a total of 148 patients were included: 39 who received placebo with no Hb response 
and 109 patients who received mitapivat with 37.6% (41 out of 109 subjects) achieving Hb response (

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model 
A  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  (PK-PD)  model  was  developed  (report  AG348-PMx-002).  Data 
from 168 patients and finally 1447 samples taken in studies AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006, and AG348-
C-011 (Cohort 1) were used. Because the 10 patients with non-missense/non-missense PKLR alleles did 
not respond to treatment with mitapivat in Study AG348-C-003, and were not included in Study AG348-
C-006 and Study AG348-C-011. Inititially they were also excluded from formal PK-PD modelling analysis. 
Likewise, data from placebo treated participants were not included in the PKPD modelling analysis. The 
mean haemoglobin change from baseline stratified by PKLR mutation status in study AG348-C-003 is 
presented in

An updated PKPD model was developed including the 10 patients with non-missense/non-missense PKLR 
alleles  from  Study  AG348-C-003.  Placebo  data  from  Study  AG348-C-006  were  not  included  because 
there  was  no  change  in  the  haemoglobin  (Hb)  concentration  over  time  in  participants  who  received 
placebo for 24 weeks; therefore, placebo data were not deemed to contribute to the primary purpose of 
understanding the dynamic relationship between mitapivat concentration and Hb concentration and were 
deemed unnecessary for inclusion in the analysis.

The final PK-PD model for haemoglobin and mitapivat concentrations was an indirect-effect model with 
zero-order production and first-order degradation for haemoglobin (turnover model). Mitapivat plasma 
concentration  (central  compartment)  inhibiting  the  degradation  rate  constant  of  haemoglobin  in  a 
saturable fashion was modelled using an Emax model, leading to an increase in haemoglobin levels (i.e. 
stabilisation  in  haemoglobin  levels;  Emax  =  29 %,  EC50  =  73.2  ng/mL).  IIV  were  found  on  baseline 
haemoglobin  half-life  (population  mean  6.8  days,  54.8  %CV)  and  on  Emax  for  patients  without 
splenectomy  (72.7  %CV).  A  decreased  of  haemoglobin  stabilisation  was  estimated  for  patients  with 
splenectomy  and  an  increased  for  patients  with  higher  indirect  bilirubin  levels.  Covariates  on 
haemoglobin  half-life  revealed  an  increase  with  increasing  body  weight  and  decrease  with  increasing 
baseline  ferritin.  In  the  updated  PKPD  model,  a  large  covariate  effect  of  non-missense/non-missense 
PKLR alleles on Emax (mitapivat maximum effect) was identified. The Emax estimate was 28.6% in a typical 
patient  with  a  missense/missense  or  missense/non-missense  PKLR  allele  type,  and  5.2%  in  a  typical 
patient with a non-missense/non-missense PKLR allele type. All other parameter estimates were similar 
between the updated and original models. The VPC of the final updated model is presented in

Note: The blue lines represent the 5th, median, and 95th percentile of simulated data; there were 10 simulations per

the titration algorithm. The yellow lines represent the 5th, median, and 95th percentile of the observed data, which 
are represented with solid dots. 
The saturable decrease of haemolysis was estimated with an EC50 of 73.2 ng/mL (updated model 72.7 
ng/mL) and a median maximum decrease of about 29 % in patients without splenectomy, and about 9.3 
% in patients with prior splenectomy. At maximal mitapivat concentrations, this translates to a 40.8 % 
increase in haemoglobin levels in patients without splenectomy and a 10.2 % increase in patients with 
prior splenectomy. The baseline haemoglobin half-life was estimated to be 6.8 days (a patient with a

body weight of 70 kg and ferritin level of 560 μg/L) with a range of 2.4 to 25.1 days. After maximal 
mitapivat treatment, the haemoglobin half-life changes to a median of 8.1 days with a range of 3.7 to 
63.3 days.  
Different  up-titration  dosing  scenarios  were  simulated  using  the  final  PK-PD  model.  Results  for 
simulations of study AG348-C-006 revealed that using a faster up-titration regimen (after 2 and 4 weeks) 
or  a  higher  starting  dose (50  mg  instead of  5  mg) did  not  results  in  a  higher  probability  of  response 
compared to the proposed recommended dosing regimen (response 41.4%, 95% CI of 33% to 49.8%, 
down titration margin 2 g/dL below ULN, i.e. if haemoglobin values were above the down-titration margin 
at any visit, the dose was reduced to the next lower dose). Time profiles for haemoglobin mean change 
from  baseline  and  for  weekly  haemoglobin  responder  percentage  for  the  three  dosing  scenarios  with 
down-titration margin 2 g/dL below ULN (scenarios 1 to 3) are shown in Figure 11. Mean change from 
baseline in haemoglobin during the Fixed-Dose Period was 1.58 g/dL (95% CI of 1.31 to 1.81 g/dL) with 
a probability of dose reduction of 3.9% (95% CI of 1.5% to 6.8%) (Table 22). 
For  patients  with  non-missense/non-missense  PKLR  alleles,  the  simulation  results  suggested  that 
increasing the dose from 50 mg BID to 300 mg BID or 500 mg BID would result in a small numerical 
increase in Hb. This is consistent with the non-responder status of these patients in Study AG348-C-003, 
in which none of the 10 patients with non-missense/non-missense PKLR alleles reached the threshold of 
the Hb response criterion defined as change from baseline in Hb ≥1.5 g/dL at >50% assessments in the 
Core Period, excluding those within 2 months (61 days) of transfusion.

•  QTc analyses 
Report AG348-C-004-QTC: Two linear mixed-effects models were developed using Phase 1 data from 
study AG348-C-004 (doses of 5, 50, and 200 mg, no placebo), describing concentration – QTc effects 
for mitapivat and its metabolite AGI-8702. Predicted mean increase in QTcF at geometric mean Cmax 
for  200  mg  dose  were  3.19  ms  (0.79  to  5.65  ms)  for  AGI-8702  and  1.53  ms  (-1.27  to  4.32  ms)  for 
mitapivat. For the highest dose of 200 mg and considering mean QTcF baselines of ≤403 ms, maximal 
effects of up to 7.41 ms (AGI-8702) and 5.96 ms (mitapivat) can be expected. The results for the 5 mg 
dose group were not presented. The effects of mitapivat and metabolite AGI-8702 on QTcF change from 
baseline fall below the 10 msec threshold. 
Report  AG348-C-014-QTc  cardiac  safety:  A  linear  mixed-effects  model  was  developed  using  Phase  1 
data from the fasted arms (i.e. Treatments A, B, and D) in study AG348-C-014 (doses of 100 and 300 
mg or placebo), describing concentration – QTc effects for mitapivat and its metabolite AGI-8702. Serial 
ECGs were extracted from continuous ECG recordings (Holters) and time matched to the pharmacokinetic 
samples.  A  combined  model  for  both  analytes  was  chosen.  Results  reveal  that  QTc  effects  are  not 
expected to exceed 10 ms. Highest changes were observed after about 4 h. An increase in heart rate 
could be observed after administration of 100 mg (up to 3.3 bpm) and 300 mg (up to 6.5 bpm) between 
0.5 and 4 h post-dose. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacometrics 
Data  from  186  healthy  volunteers  and  155  patients  with  PK  deficiency  obtained  in  five  Phase  1,  one 
Phase 2, and three Phase 3 studies were analysed developing a population pharmacokinetic model for 
mitapivat. The nonlinear pharmacokinetics (exposure increases less than dose proportional) of mitapivat 
was  described  by  a  3-compartment  model  that  included  a  first-order  absorption  and  a  lag-time  on 
Assessment report

absorption. Clearance was modeled a function of time and dose and increased exponentially to steady 
state, thus accounting for the auto-induction observed after multiple doses. Shrinkages for the central 
and  a  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  are  considered  too  high.  However,  overall  the  parameter 
estimates  were  generally  precise  (RSE  between  3.18  and  34.4  %).  Statistically  significant  covariates 
were found for dose and haematocrit on CL (increasing with dose and haematocrit), body weight on all 
three volumes of distribution (increasing with body weight), and gender on volume of distribution of the 
central  compartment  (decreasing  for  female).  Model-based  simulations  were  performed  in  order  to 
evaluate the expected exposures (AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough) for different subpopulations. Overall, results 
reveal that exposures after 50 mg BID dosing are expected in the order of magnitude of the exposures 
for  the  reference  patients.  In  addition,  expected  exposure over  a  broader  weight  range up  to  140  kg 
were presented. Cmax,ss is expected to be about 27 % higher in patients with lower body weight (40 kg) 
and 24 % lower in patients with higher body weight (140 kg). Ctrough is expected to be about 26 % and 
22  %  lower  in  patients  with  lower  body  weight  (40  kg  and  45  kg,  respectively)  and  49  %  higher  in 
patients  with  higher  body  weight  (140  kg).  Overall,  Cmax  can  be  expected  to  be  slightly  too  high  for 
lighter patients and slightly too low for heavier patients. The expected Ctrough values for patients with a 
higher body weight are considered too high from the PK perspective (+ 49 % compared to the reference). 
But AUC0-24hr,ss , which was found as predictor for safety, seems comparable for the different body weights 
between 40 and 140 kg. Model-based expected exposures for a broader range of haematocrit levels of 
19 to 52 % were provided. AUC (predictor for safety measures) is expected to decrease by about 20 % 
with  increasing  haematocrit  (of  up  to  52  %  haematocrit).  The  decrease  in  exposure  with  increasing 
haematocrit is more pronounced for Ctrough, which is expected to decrease by 41 % for patients reaching 
52 % haematocrit levels, and by 24 % for patients reaching 39 % haematocrit levels. Among the 155 
patients included in the population PK analysis, only five patients were older than 65 years (n=4 [2.6] 
% aged 65 to 74 years and one patient [0.6 %] in the age group 75 – 84 years). The low number of 
older patients have been adequately addressed in the SmPC. However, results with regard to older age 
(65 years and onwards) require cautious interpretation. Pyruvate kinase deficiency mutation type was 
not statistically significantly covariate on the pharmacokinetics of mitapivat and seem not have an impact 
on mitapivat exposure. In summary, the developed population pharmacokinetic model might be sufficient 
for  the  intended  purpose  to  characterise  the  pharmacokinetic  behaviour  and  evaluate  effects  of 
covariates.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The ADME study showed that the renal excretion of mitapivat is negligible (< 3% of the dose). Based on 
PopPK analysis, steady-state AUC values from subjects with moderate renal impairment were within the 
range for subjects with normal renal function, and a comment has been added to the SmPC, regarding 
the limited available data. 
Hepatic impairment 
The ADME study showed that approximately half of the administered dose was metabolised. Therefore, 
there is the potential for hepatic impairment to affect mitapivat exposure. There is too limited data to 
allow drawing any conclusion. The lack of information is correctly reflected in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 
5.2.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  undertake  a  dedicated  study  aiming  to  assess  the  influence  of 
hepatic impairment on exposure, and to provide the results as a post-approval measure. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Mitapivat  interactions  with  other  drugs  is  based  on  one  interaction  study  where  mitapivat  was  co-
administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP3A4 inducer, and PBPK modeling.  
Although  mitapivat  PBPK  was  demonstrated  to  be  able  to  accurately  describe  mitapivat  in  certain 
conditions  with  metabolism-related  parameters  estimated  using  adequate  clinical  data,  there  are  still 
concerns regarding the model’s capability to accurately estimate both auto-induction and auto-inhibition 
due to the lack of qualification dataset and some remaining questions on misprediction following multiple 
dose administration at high dose (i.e. 120 mg QD and 360 mg BID). A combined mitapivat PBPK model

with the PD model on gastric pH was also presented to predict mitapivat interactions with acid reducing 
agent (ARA). The latter model is is not considered qualified to predict mitapivat interaction with gastric 
acid  reducing  agent.  The  qualification  dataset  was  not  considered  robust  and  importantly,  the  model 
verification overpredicted the interaction between ranitidine and ketoconazole by ten- to four- fold, when 
considering  geometric  and  arithmetic  means  respectively.  Consequently,  decreases  in  mitapivat 
absorption in case of such concomitant treatment cannot be excluded. This is appropriately reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Mitapivat interactions with CYP3A4 substrate are still uncertain given mitapivat’s inhibition and induction 
potentials. This is, however, reflected in the SmPC and caution of use should be applied in case of co-
administration with CYP3A4 substrate. Close monitoring should be performed in case of NTI drugs. Given 
the  complex  metabolism  of  mitapivat  being  CYP3A4  substrate,  inhibitor  and  inducer,  and  the  large 
fraction of drugs being metabolised by CYP3A4, especially those with narrow therapeutic index, a DDI 
study with midazolam to assess the magnitude of interaction between mitapivat at the highest dose with 
midazolam will be conducted by the applicant as a post-approval measure.  
The clinical relevance of potential interaction with P-gp substrates is thus unknown. The caution of use 
in case of concomitant treatment with P-gp substrates is recommended. 
As inducer of CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2B6, and UGT1A1 mitapivat may decrease drug substrate of those 
enzymes and caution should be used in case of concomitant treatment with these drug substrates with 
close monitoring in case of NTI drugs.  
Mitapivat exposure may be decreased in case of co-administrations of ARAs, which has been reflected in 
the SmPC together with appropriate recommendations. 
Relation between plasma concentration and response 
Different E-R models for efficacy and safety endpoints were developed using logistic regression, linear, 
and  Emax  models.  Overall,  results  reveal  that  All  Grade  insomnia,  hot  flush,  and  total  and  free 
testosterone  increase  with  increasing  mitapivat  exposure.  Estrone  levels  decreased  with  increasing 
mitapivat  exposure  although  no  consistent  trend  with  exposure  was  observed  across  the  exposure 
quartiles. Logistic regression or linear regression models were applied for efficacy endpoints. Exposure-
efficacy for haemoglobin response, indirect bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocytes, 
and  ferritin  (studies  AG348-C-006  and  AG348-C-011),  as  well  as  transfusion  burden  reduction  and 
transfusion-free  response  (study  AG348-C-007)  were  investigated.  For  none  of  the  investigated 
endpoints a clear exposure-response trend was found. For haemoglobin a treatment effect was observed, 
but a statistically significant E-R relationship was not identified across the observed exposure range.  
Initially, data from Study AG348-C-003 were not included in the exposure-response analysis for efficacy 
because haemoglobin response was a secondary endpoint in this study. However, the exposure-response 
analysis  was  rerun  and  these  data  (each  n=21  treated  with  50  and  300  mg  BID,  respectively)  were 
included in the exposure-response analysis for efficacy. In addition a sensitivity analysis was conducted, 
including 10 participants with the non-missense/non-missense mutations from Study AG348-C-003 (all 
non-responder).  No  clear  relationship  between  exposure  (AUC)  and  haemoglobin  response  can  be 
observed. 
The PK-PD relationship between mitapivat plasma concentration and increase in haemoglobin levels was 
analysed  by  modelling  a  reduction  of  the  degradation  rate  constant  of  haemoglobin  with  increasing 
mitapivat doses. An Emax function was used to model the saturable effect of mitapivat on haemoglobin 
increase. Stabilisation of haemoglobin turnover during mitapivat treatment was less in patients with prior 
splenectomy and increased in patients with higher indirect bilirubin. Haemoglobin half-life increased with 
increasing baseline body weight and decreased with increased baseline ferritin. Model-based simulations 
reveal that the proposed every 4-weeks up-titration dosing scheme of 5 mg to 20 mg up to 50 mg BID 
result in a similar response (41.4%, 95% CI of 33.4% to 49.5%, down titration margin 2 g/dL below 
ULN) compared to faster up-titration or using a higher starting dose of 50 mg, but resulting in less dose 
reductions during the treatment. Dosing schemes designed to achieve faster haemoglobin response could 
enable 31 or 43% of participants to achieve a haemoglobin change ≥ 1.5 g/dL at 4 weeks but had no

effect  on  haemoglobin  response  during  the  Fixed-Dose  Period.  Such  schemes  did  not  allow  sufficient 
time for the individual Hgb level to achieve a plateau prior to up-titrating to the next dose level, and 
therefore were predicted to increase dose reductions by approximately 2-fold. Based on these results, 
the proposed titration and dosing scheme is acceptable.  
While the dosing titration scheme is well justified in case Hb level is below normal range or within normal 
range, it was not clear how to manage patients with Hb above normal range. Therefore, the applicant 
updated the text in the SmPC section 4.2).  All patients are to be titrated through sequential doses of 5 
mg BID and 20 mg BID to a maximum of 50 mg BID, with dose increases occurring after 4 weeks at 
each dose level, after assessing haemoglobin (Hb) levels and transfusion requirements. Some patients 
may respond at lower dose levels (5 or 20 mg BID). If Hb levels is within normal range and patient has 
not required a transfusion within the last 8 weeks, patients can maintain on 5 or 20 mg BID. If Hb levels 
decrease, patients who are at one of the lower maintenance dose levels can be up titrated to a maximum 
dose of 50 mg BID. The dose can be reduced to the next lower dose level for adverse event management 
and/or tolerability reasons. 
In Study AG348-C-003, 10 patients with non-missense/non-missense PKLR alleles did not respond to 
treatment  with  mitapivat,  and  were  not  included  in  Study  AG348-C-006  and  Study  AG348-C-011. 
Therefore, they were excluded from formal PK-PD modelling analysis.  
The applicant provided results for an updated PKPD model that included, in addition to the previously 
used data, data from 10 patients with non-missense/non-missense PKLR alleles. Placebo data were not 
included. The applicant’s argumentation that inclusion of placebo data are unnecessary is not agreed, as 
they would help to directly quantify the difference between placebo and mitapivat treatment, in particular 
for patient populations who experience very little or no response only (e.g. patients with missense/non-
missense PKLR alleles).  
Overall,  results  between  participants  of  studies  AG348-C-003,  AG348-C-006  and  AG348-C-011, 
mitapivat  and  placebo  treated,  and  the  three  PKLR  mutation  types,  are  difficult  to  compare,  because 
they were presented in different ways and simulations were performed for different dosing scenarios. 
Moreover, placebo data should have been assessed along with the mitapivat treated participants to better 
quantify the differences in response. Nonetheless, results suggest, that patients with non-missense/non-
missense PKLR mutation do not response (markedly) to the treatment with mitapivat, independent of 
the dose administered. Please refer also to the section on clinical efficacy below.  
All taken together it can be expected, that based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic, PK-
PD and the E-R modelling analyses, and due to the nonlinear pharmacokinetics, higher doses of mitapivat 
(above 50 mg BID) would not lead to proportional higher exposure and are not expected to translate to 
a higher efficacy. However, an increase in exposure may results in an increased safety risk with respect 
to insomnia, hot flush and testosterone levels. The SmPC provides guidance to prescribers for situations 
when a patient may need a maintenance dose lower than 50 mg BID. Two QTc analyses were conducted 
using Phase 1 data were the effect of mitapivat and its metabolite AGI-8702 on QT intervals and heart 
rate were investigated after administration of mitapivat doses of 5, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg. Linear 
mixed  effects  models  were  developed.  Overall,  results  reveal  that  QTc  effects  can  be  expected  to  be 
below 10 ms.  
Pharmacodynamics 
A dose-exposure-response relationship between mitapivat and 2 PD endpoints (ATP and 2,3-DPG) was 
shown  in  healthy  subjects,  consistent  with  the  hypothesised  mechanism  of  action  (PKR  activation).  
Dose-dependency decrease in 2,3-DPG concentrations was observed up to 360 mg BID mitapivat. No 
dose-dependent increases in ATP were observed above mitapivat doses of 60 mg BID.  
Significant changes in these markers were not observed in subjects with pyruvate kinase deficiency. The 
reason for this difference is not clear but may be related to the composition of blood in subjects with PK 
deficiency,  who  often  have  a  considerable  degree  of  reticulocytosis  and  a  severely  curtailed  RBC  life 
span. The assessment of activity must imperatively focus on clinical parameters.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall  the  PK  of  mitapivat  has  been  sufficiently  characterised  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  the  target 
population. Results of the ongoing hepatic impairment study are awaited and will be submitted by the 
applicant post-approval, which is acceptable. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
•  Dose-response study  
Study  AG348-C-003  is  a  Phase  2,  open-label,  2-arm,  multicentre,  randomised,  dose-ranging  study  in 
adult subjects with PK deficiency. This study consists of a 24-week core period and an 8-year extension 
period. 
The choice of dose and schedule of administration of mitapivat for arms 1 and 2 of the study 003 was 
based on PK/PD data from AG348-C-002 multiple ascending dose study in healthy adult subjects. The 
study 002 demonstrated that the exposures produced by mitapivat doses from 60 mg BID to 360 mg 
BID resulted in maximal changes from baseline for the PD markers 2,3-DPG (reduction from baseline) 
and  ATP  (increase  from  baseline).  The  exposures  resulting  from  doses  less  than  60  mg  BID  were  of 
lesser magnitude and the exposures resulting from doses greater than 360 mg BID were of no greater 
magnitude than the aforementioned range. Therefore, the starting doses for this first dose ranging study 
in subjects with PK deficiency were selected to be 300 mg BID (Arm 1) and 50 mg BID (Arm 2).  
Subjects remaining on study received mitapivat across a wide range of doses (from 300 mg BID to 5 mg 
QD).  These  observations  indicate  that  the  optimal  maintenance  dose  of  AG-348  is  likely  to  vary  by 
subject and cannot be determined in advance. 
Based on simulations from the population PK-efficacy-safety analyses, doses of 5 mg BID, 20 mg BID, 
and 50 mg BID were selected for study 006 and study 007. These same doses were also used in the 
dose optimisation period for subjects in Cohort 1 of the extension study (Study 011). 
•  Main studies 
Study AG348-C-006 
Study AG348-C-006 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy 
and safety study of orally administered mitapivat compared with placebo in subjects with PK deficiency 
who were not regularly receiving blood transfusions.  The study consisted of a dose optimisation period 
(Part 1) followed by a fixed dose period (Part 2).

Treatments 
All subjects should receive an initial dose of 5 mg BID of study treatment with 2 potential sequential 
steps for dose level increase (ie, from 5 to 20 mg BID and from 20 to 50 mg BID; no increases beyond 
50 mg BID will be allowed).  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with mitapivat compared 
with placebo in increasing haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety of mitapivat, to determine the effect 
of the study treatment regimens on markers of haemolysis, haematopoietic activity, and other indicators 
of clinical activity, and to determine the effect of the study treatment regimens on health-related quality 
of life (HRQOL).  
The exploratory objectives of the study were to determine the effect of the study treatment regimens on 
number  of  transfusion  events  and  number  of  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  units  transfused  and  to  evaluate 
markers of iron metabolism and indicators of iron overload. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the Hb response, defined as a ≥15 g/L (1.5 g/dL; 0.93 mmol/L) increase in 
Hb concentration from baseline that is sustained at 2 or more scheduled assessments at Weeks 16, 20, 
and 24 during the Fixed Dose Period. 
Key Secondary Endpoint 
The key secondary endpoint was the average change from baseline in Hb concentration at Weeks 16, 
20, and 24. 
Other Secondary Endpoints 
• Maximal Hb concentration increase from baseline 
• Time to first achieve an increase in Hb concentration of 15 g/L (1.5 g/dL; 0.93 mmol/L) or more from 
baseline. 
• Average change from baseline at Weeks 16, 20, and 24 in markers of haemolysis: bilirubin, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and haptoglobin levels 
•  Average  change  from  baseline  at  Weeks  16,  20,  and  24  in  markers  of  haematopoietic  activity: 
reticulocyte percentages 
• Change from baseline in HRQOL Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) scores: Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency 
Diary (PKDD) and Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Impact Assessment (PKDIA) 
Exploratory Endpoints 
• Change from baseline in additional markers of haematopoietic activity. 
• Change from baseline in markers of iron metabolism and indicators of iron overload.

• Change from baseline in HRQOL PRO scores: European quality of life 5-dimensional descriptive system 
(EQ-5D-5L). 
• Proportion of subjects requiring transfusions and the total number of RBC units transfused. 
Sample size 
Approximately 76 subjects were to be randomised in the study in a 1:1 ratio to mitapivat or matched 
placebo. Assuming a response rate of 35% in the mitapivat arm and 5% in the placebo arm, 76 subjects 
(38 per arm) were needed to have 90% power to reject the null hypothesis based on a 2-sided Fisher’s 
exact test with 0.05 significance level. 
The sample size of 76 subjects (38 per arm) also provided >80% power to detect a difference of 1.4 
g/dL between mitapivat and placebo in the average of mean change from baseline in Hb at Weeks 16, 
20, and 24, based on a 2-sample t-test, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.5 g/dL (98% power) 
or 2.1 g/dL (81% power). 
To control the overall type I error in the study at the 2-sided 5% level, a fixed sequence testing procedure 
(Mauer, 1995) was used to adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints. This is detailed in the statistical method section. 
No formal interim analysis was planned or performed. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to mitapivat or matching placebo. 
Randomisation assignment was implemented by an interactive response system and stratified by: 
- 
- 
The average of screening Hb concentrations (<8.5, ≥8.5 g/dL [5.28 mmol/L]) 
The  PKLR  gene  mutation  category  (missense/missense,  missense/nonmissense).  In  rare 
instances where PKLR gene mutation category could not be made definitively (eg, if the subject 
harbored  3  mutant  PKLR  alleles),  the  subject  was  assigned  to  the  missense/nonmissense 
category. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  included  all  subjects  who  were  randomised.  Subjects  were  classified 
according to the randomised treatment arm. 
The Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Subjects 
were classified according to the treatment actually received. If a subject randomised to placebo received 
at least 1 dose of mitapivat then the subject was classified to the mitapivat arm. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was a subset of the FAS. Subjects who met any of the following criteria 
were excluded from the PPS: 
− Did not receive at least 1 dose of the randomised treatment 
− Did not have Hb assessments at Weeks 16, 20, and 24 during the Fixed Dose Period

This was a Phase 3, multicentre, single-arm, open-label efficacy and safety study of orally administered 
mitapivat  in  subjects  with  PK  deficiency  who  were  regularly  receiving  blood  transfusions.  The  study 
consisted of a dose optimisation period (Part 1) followed by a Fixed-Dose Period (Part 2). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion Criteria 
1. Aged 18 years or older 
2. Documented clinical laboratory confirmation of PK deficiency, defined as documented presence of at 
least 2 mutant alleles in the PKLR gene, of which at least 1 was a missense mutation, as determined per 
the genotyping performed by the study central genotyping laboratory. 
3. A history of a minimum of 6 transfusion episodes in the 52-week period before the date of informed 
consent  as  documented in  the transfusion  history  of  the  subject,  which  reflected  the  subject’s  typical 
transfusion burden. 
4. Complete records of transfusion history, defined as having the following available for the 52 weeks 
before  the  date  of  informed  consent:  (1)  all  the  transfusion  dates,  (2)  the  number  of  blood  units 
transfused  for  all  the  transfusions,  and  (3)  Hb  concentrations  within  1  week  before transfusion  for  at 
least 80% of the transfusions. 
5.  Received  at  least  0.8  mg  of  oral  folic  acid  daily  for  at  least  21  days  before  the  first  dose  of  study 
treatment, to be continued daily during study participation

6. Adequate organ function, as defined by: 
a. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless the 
increased  AST  was  assessed  by  the  Investigator  as  due  to  haemolysis  and/or  hepatic  iron 
deposition)  and  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  ≤ 2.5 × ULN  (unless  the  increased  ALT  was 
assessed by the Investigator as due to hepatic iron deposition). 
b.  Normal  or  elevated  levels  of  serum  bilirubin.  In  subjects  with  serum  bilirubin  >ULN,  the 
elevation was not to be associated with choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, or 
hepatocellular  disease.  Elevated  bilirubin  attributed  to  haemolysis  with  or  without  Gilbert 
syndrome was not exclusionary. 
c. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2, measured GFR ≥60 mL/min, 
or calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) ≥60 mL/min 
d. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 × 109/L 
e. Platelet count ≥100 × 109/L in the absence of a spleen, or platelet count ≥50 × 109/L in the 
presence of a spleen and in the absence of any other cause of thrombocytopenia. 
f. Activated partial thromboplastin time and international normalised ratio ≤1.25 ×ULN, unless 
the subject was receiving therapeutic anticoagulants. 
Exclusion Criteria 
1.  Homozygous  for  the  R479H  mutation  or  have  2  non-missense  mutations,  without  the  presence  of 
another missense mutation, in the PKLR gene as determined per the genotyping performed by the study 
central genotyping laboratory. 
2. A significant medical condition that confers an unacceptable risk to participating in the study and/or 
that could confound the interpretation of the study data.  
3.- A history of transfusions occurring on average more frequently than once every 3 weeks during the 
52 weeks prior to signing informed consent. 
4.  A  splenectomy  scheduled  during  the  study  drug  period  or  have  undergone  splenectomy  within  12 
months prior to signing informed consent. 
5. Prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant. 
Treatments 
Part 1: Dose Optimisation Period of the Study 
During Part 1 of the study, all enrolled subjects will begin treatment with AG-348 at a dose level of 5 mg 
BID on Day 1, which is scheduled to occur 2 to 7 days after a subject’s Transfusion 0. Each subject will 
undergo  individual  dose  optimisation  to  identify  the  highest  appropriate  dose  for  the  subject  with  2 
potential sequential dose level increases (ie, from 5 to 20 mg BID and from 20 to 50 mg BID).  
Part 2: Fixed-Dose Period of the Study 
In  Part  2  of  the  study,  subjects  will  receive  their  optimised  dose  of  AG-348  for  24  weeks.  No  dose 
adjustment  should  be  performed  during  Part  2  of  the  study,  unless  a  safety  event  experienced  by  a 
subject requires a dose reduction, in the opinion of the Investigator. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with mitapivat, as assessed 
by the reduction in transfusion burden. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 98/187 
 
 
 
The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of treatment with mitapivat. 
The exploratory objectives of the study were the following: 
•  To  determine  the  effect  of  mitapivat  on  markers  of  haemolysis,  erythropoietic  activity,  and  other 
indicators of clinical activity 
• To determine the effect of mitapivat on markers of iron metabolism and indicators of iron overload 
• To determine the effect of mitapivat on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), as determined using 
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in transfusion 
burden, defined as a ≥33% reduction in the number of RBC units transfused during the 24 weeks of Part 
2  compared  with  the  historical  transfusion  burden  standardised  to  24  weeks  (Standardised  Control 
Period).  
Secondary endpoints  
• Annualised total number of RBC units transfused during the study (both Part 1 and Part 2) compared 
with the historical transfusion burden.  
• Number of transfusion episodes during Part 2 compared with the Standardised Control Period.  
• Proportion of subjects who became transfusion-free, defined as 0 transfusions administered during Part 
2.  
• Proportion of subjects who achieved Hb concentrations in the normal range at least once, 8 weeks or 
more after a transfusion in Part 2.  
Exploratory endpoints  
• Change from baseline in the following markers of haemolysis: bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
and haptoglobin levels, as measured by safety laboratory assessments. 
• Change from baseline in markers of erythropoietic activity. 
• Change from baseline in markers of iron metabolism and indicators of iron overload. 
• Change from baseline over time in HRQOL scores (ie, Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Impact Assessment 
[PKDIA], Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Diary [PKDD], European Quality of Life Five-Dimensional Descriptive 
System [EQ-5D-5L]). 
Sample size 
Due to the rarity of the disease and the small patient population, the sample size was largely driven by 
feasibility, and the study was planned to enrol a minimum of 20, with up to 40, subjects. The power to 
reject H0 at a 1-sided α=0.025 for different sample sizes and under different assumptions for the true 
TRR rate is shown in the following table.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this was a single-arm open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
The Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. In this 
nonrandomised study, the FAS and the Safety Analysis Set were identical. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was a subset of the FAS and included all subjects who completed 12 weeks 
of treatment in the Fixed-Dose Period (ie, end date of the Fixed-Dose Period – start date of the Fixed-
Dose Period + 1 ≥84).

Haemolysis Markers 
For  transfusion-free  responders,  there  was  a  consistent  and  sustained  improvement  in  haemolysis 
markers  (indirect  bilirubin,  haptoglobin,  and  LDH)  during  both  the  Dose  Optimisation  Period  and  the 
Fixed-Dose Period (with most subjects reaching values within the normal range for these markers). 
For non–transfusion-free responders, there were fluctuations in the levels of markers of haemolysis, but 
interpretation of these markers is limited by concomitant transfusions.

performed by the study central genotyping laboratory. 
For subjects with PK deficiency in the studies 006, 007 and 003, mutations were confirmed by central 
testing prior to enrollment.  
•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy data from study 003 were not pooled with data from Studies 006 and 011 due to differences in

• Hb response was ongoing for 26 of the 31 Hb responders up to 29.1 months with continued mitapivat 
treatment. 
• Of the 5 Hb responders who experienced loss of Hb, 3 subjects continued to have Hb concentration 
increased by ≥15 g/L with ongoing treatment with mitapivat after the initial loss of Hb response (ie, loss 
of Hb response was due to transient dip in Hb).

Haemolysis Markers 
For  transfusion-free  responders,  there  was  a  consistent  and  sustained  improvement  in  haemolysis 
markers (indirect bilirubin, Hp, and LDH). 
For non–transfusion-free responders, there were fluctuations in the levels of markers of haemolysis, but 
interpretation of these markers is limited by concomitant transfusions. 
Reticulocyte Percentage 
For  transfusion-free  responders,  there  was  a  consistent  and  sustained  improvement  in  reticulocyte 
percentage; for non–transfusion-free responders, there were fluctuations in reticulocyte percentage. 
2.5.5.1.  Supportive studies 
Study AG348-C-011 [Study 011] 
This study is an ongoing multicentre, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety, and 
efficacy of treatment with mitapivat in subjects who were previously enrolled in study 006 or Study 007.  
Subjects were assigned to 1 of the following 3 cohorts: 
• Cohort 1: Subjects who received placebo in Study 006 
• Cohort 2: Subjects who received mitapivat in Study 006 
• Cohort 3: Subjects who received mitapivat in Study 007 
For Cohorts 2 and 3 only, subjects were required to have demonstrated clinical benefit from mitapivat 
in the antecedent study, in the opinion of the Investigator. Subjects are scheduled to receive mitapivat

treatment  for  up  to  a  maximum  of  192  weeks  until  study  withdrawal  criteria  are  met  or  the  study  is 
closed.  For  subjects  in  Cohort  1,  individual  dose  titration  was  incorporated  to  allow  each  subject  to 
escalate  to  a  dose  of  mitapivat  that  maximised  the  subject’s  increase  in  Hb  concentration  (assessed 
every 4 weeks) while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. 
Figure 32 Overview of Design for Study 011 
First subject enrolled: 21 March 2019 
Data cutoff date: 12 November 2020 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of mitapivat. 
The secondary endpoints of the study were as follows: 
Cohort 1 Only: Subjects who received placebo in Study 006 
•  Proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  Hb  response,  defined  as  a  ≥15  g/L  (≥1.5  g/dL;  0.93  mmol/L) 
increase  in  Hb  concentration  from  baseline  that  is  sustained  at  2  or  more  scheduled  assessments  at 
Weeks 16, 20, and 24. 
• Average change from baseline in Hb concentration at Weeks 16, 20, and 24 
All Cohorts 
• Change from baseline in Hb concentration 
•  Change  from  baseline  in  markers  of  haemolysis:  bilirubin,  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  and 
haptoglobin concentrations 
• Change from baseline in markers of erythropoietic activity: reticulocyte percentages 
• Change from baseline in the number of transfusion events, in the number of RBC units transfused 
• Change from baseline in HRQOL PRO scores: Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Diary (PKDD) and Pyruvate 
Kinase Deficiency Impact Assessment (PKDIA) 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. The 
Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) is a subset of the FAS and included all subjects in Cohort 1 who received the 
first dose of mitapivat more than 24 weeks (≥169 days) before the data cutoff date. 
As of the data cutoff date of 12 November 2020, 88 subjects were treated in the study, with 36 in Cohort 
1, 35 in Cohort 2, and 17 in Cohort 3. Of the treated subjects in Cohort 1, 17 were included in the EAS.

Disposition of Subjects 
A  total of  10  (11.4%)  subjects  discontinued  study  treatment  and  8  (9.1%)  subjects  discontinued the 
study  prematurely.  The  primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  lack  of  efficacy  and  withdrawal  by 
subject.

Continued dosing with mitapivat (Cohort 2) resulted in sustained increases in Hb concentration compared 
with baseline; with a mean change from baseline of 16.14 g/L at Week 24. 
In Cohort 3, 6 of 17 subjects with more than 12 weeks of mitapivat treatment in Study 011 who were 
transfusion-free achieved or maintained normal Hb as follows: 
• One subject had at least 60 weeks of mitapivat treatment and reached normal Hb concentration once. 
•  Three  subjects  had  at  least  48  weeks  of  mitapivat  treatment  in  study  011,  with  1  subject  reaching 
normal Hb concentrations once and 1 subject maintaining Hb at normal concentrations. 
•  Two  subjects  had  at  least  12  weeks  of  mitapivat  treatment  in  Study  011,  with  1  subject  reaching 
normal Hb concentration once.

Mean Hb was low at baseline (89.5 g/L). Mitapivat treatment led to early and sustained increases in Hb 
concentrations throughout the core Period and in the extension Period. 
All  subjects  who  achieved  Hb  response  in  the  Core  Period  and  continued  into  the  Extension  Period 
maintained Hb levels that were increased from baseline in the Extension Period.

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A  MAA  for  mitapivat  has  been  submitted  in  the  proposed  indication  ”treatment  of  pyruvate  kinase 
deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult patients”. 
The primary support for the proposed indication is based on efficacy and safety results from the pivotal 
studies AG348-C-006 and AG348-C-007, in subjects with PK deficiency who are not regularly transfused 
and  who  are  regularly  transfused,  respectively.  Supportive  data  are  provided  from  the  ongoing  long-
term study AG348-C-011 of subjects previously treated on studies 006 and 007 and the extension period 
of the phase 2 study AG348-C-003. 
In Study 003, a relationship between genotype and haemoglobin response was observed: patients with 
at least 1 missense mutation had a higher likelihood of a haemoglobin response. None of the patients 
with 2 drastic mutations nonmissense/nonmissense (NM/NM) had a haemoglobin response. In addition, 
a relationship between red cell PK protein level and haemoglobin response was observed, likely indicating 
that a minimum amount of full-length PK protein is required for activation by mitapivat.  
Design and conduct of clinical study AG348-C-006 
Study AG348-C-006 is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and 
safety study of mitapivat compared with placebo in subjects with PK deficiency who were not regularly 
receiving  blood  transfusions.  The  study  consisted  of  a  dose  optimisation  period  (Part  1  of  12  weeks) 
where patients received Mitapivat through sequential doses of 5 mg BID, 20 mg BID, and 50 mg BID 
with dose increases to the next dose level every 4 weeks, followed by a fixed dose period (Part 2 of 12 
weeks).  Subjects  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either  mitapivat  or  matching  placebo.  The 
randomisation was stratified by average of screening Hb concentrations (Hb <85 g/L vs Hb ≥85 g/L) and 
the PKLR gene mutation category (missense/missense vs missense/nonmissense).  
The study 006 enrolled adult subjects with clinical laboratory confirmed PK deficiency and harbouring at 
least  one  missense  mutation.  Patients  must  be  not  regularly  transfused  (no  more  than  4  transfusion 
episodes  in  the  12-month  period  up  to  the  first  day  of  study  treatment  and  no  transfusions  in  the  3 
months before the first day of treatment). Patients must have an average screening Hb concentration of 
≤100g/L  (10  g/dl;  6.21  mmol/L).  The  applicant  clarified  that  ‘symptomatic  anaemia’  patients  with 
different clinical severity were included in the trial.  
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 146/187 
 
 
 
 
Patients homozygous for the R479H mutation or with 2 non-missense mutations [NM/NM]), without the 
presence  of  another  missense  mutation,  in  PKLR  gene  were  excluded  from  phase  3  trials  given 
lack/absence of efficacy in the phase 2 study. This was clearly reflected in the product information.  There 
are  some  limitations  to  this  categorisation,  according  to  the  type  of  mutations  (missense/missense, 
missense/non-missense,  non-missense/non-missense).  For  example,  some  missense  mutations  may 
result in marked protein instability or functional inactivity, or, although not directly involved in splicing 
consensus sequences, may result in altered splicing. On the other hand, some non-missense variants 
may not have a significant impact on the protein structure (Bianchi et al. Am J Hematol. 2020). Due to 
the  intrinsic  difficulties  of  examining  the  relationship  between  genotype-phenotype  in  PK  deficiency, 
future studies should consider studying the relationship between residual PK protein level and clinical 
phenotype.  The primary endpoint was the number of Hb responders defined as a ≥15 g/L (1.5 g/dL; 
0.93  mmol/L)  increase  in  Hb  concentration  from  baseline  that  is  sustained  at  2  or  more  scheduled 
assessments at Weeks 16, 20, and 24 during the fixed dose period. The measure of Hb was performed 
centrally.  In  case  of  unavailability,  results  from  a  local  laboratory  may  be  used.  The  key  secondary 
endpoint  was  the  average  change  from  baseline  in  Hb  concentration  at  weeks  16,  20,  and  24.  Other 
secondary  endpoints  include  haemolysis  and  haematopoietic  activity  biomarkers  (indirect  bilirubin, 
reticulocyte  percentage,  lactate  dehydrogenase  and  haptoglobin)  and  PRO  score:  Pyruvate  Kinase 
Deficiency Diary (PKDD) and Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Impact Assessment (PKDIA) that assessed and 
captured changes in symptom burden and impact of HRQOL in subjects with PK deficiency treated with 
mitapivat, respectively. 
This is a double-blind study. However, the subject’s treatment assignment was unblinded to the subject, 
investigator and site personnel once a subject entered the extension study, and after the completion of 
the week 24 assessment. The SAP was finalised after most subjects had already entered the extension 
study,  i.e.,  after  most  of  them  were  unblinded.  In  this  context,  the  difference  in  the  multiplicity 
adjustment  procedures  between  the  protocol  and  the  SAP  could  be  of  concern,  with  six  secondary 
endpoints (indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte percentage, LDH, haptoglobin, PKDD and PKDIA) added to the 
fixed  sequence  testing  procedure  in  the  SAP  compared  to  the  protocol.    Nevertheless,  the  applicant 
further described the blinding requirements until after week 24 assessment, the data access restrictions 
to  the  secondary  laboratory  variables,  and  provided  the  blinding  maintenance  and  unblinding  plan 
(missing  from the  initial  submitted  documentation),  which  clarified  the  study team  blinding  up to  the 
study database lock. Based on these considerations, it is agreed that the type I error is unlikely to be 
inflated. 
The lack of specification and validation of the PRO endpoints prior to the confirmatory phase 3 trial is a 
limitation to the results interpretation. 
The  SAP  introduced  the  use  of  local  laboratory  assessments  in  the  absence  of  central  laboratory 
assessments for efficacy analyses. As this is in contradiction with the protocol wording, supplementary 
analyses of all efficacy data based on central laboratory assessments were requested from the applicant. 
The results were consistent with the study report.  
The MMRM analyses for key secondary and secondary endpoints assume that data are missing at random 
(MAR). However, some data are probably missing not at random (MNAR), therefore the applicant was 
requested to perform additional analyses based on methods that do not assume MAR (pattern-mixture 
model analysis with a control-based imputation). These sensitivity analyses showed similar results as 
the study secondary analysis results. 
Several  laboratory  efficacy  parameters  (indirect  bilirubin,  reticulocyte  percentage,  LDH,  haptoglobin) 
appear  to  be  positively  skewed  based  on  the  descriptive  statistics.  The  applicant  was  requested  to 
investigate whether log-transformation could improve the normality of the distribution, and if so, perform 
supplementary  analyses  based  on  log-transformed  data.    Log-transformation  generally  improved  the 
normality of the laboratory parameter distributions; it is acknowledged that the improvement was less 
clear  for  indirect  bilirubin.  More  importantly,  the  supplementary  analyses  did  not  impact  the  study 
conclusions,  with  similar  significance  levels  achieved  for  all  parameters  in  comparison  with  the  study 
report.

A total of 80 subjects were randomised and 79 (98.8%) subjects completed the study. The first subject 
was enrolled on 01-Oct-2018 and the last subject completed on 09-Oct-2020.  
Patients included are overall representative of patients with PK deficiency not regularly transfused. Of 
the 80 subjects enrolled, most subjects were white (75%) and 10% were Asian. There were a higher 
proportion of women than man (60.0% vs 40%). The median age was 33 years with 42 subjects (52.5%) 
that  were  <35  years  of  age;  4  subjects  were  older  than  65  years.  55  subjects  (68.8%)  had  a 
missense/missense  PKLR  gene  mutation  and  25  subjects  (31.3%)  had  missense/non  missense  PKLR 
gene mutation.  
Baseline  Hb  was  similar  in  the  mitapivat  arm  and  the  placebo  arm.  Most  subjects  (72.5%)  had  prior 
splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Most subjects had elevated ferritin levels at baseline. 74% of subjects 
(59  subjects)  had  no  prior  transfusion  history,  19%  of  subjects  (15  subjects)  had  1  prior  transfusion 
episode, and 5% of subjects (4 subjects) had 3 prior transfusion episodes in the 12-month period up to 
the first day of study treatment. Although subjects with Hb >100 g/L were excluded from the pivotal 
study 006, an Hb response was observed in 5 subjects among the 8 subjects with baseline Hb >100g/L 
enrolled in the phase 2 study 003 (Hb response rate of 62.5%, 95%CI: (24.5, 91.5)). 
More  subjects  reported not  receiving  prior  chelation  therapy  in  the  12  months  before  the  first  day  of 
study  treatment  (on  both  arms)  compared  with  those  who  did  receive  it,  with  a  lower  percentage  of 
subjects reporting prior chelation therapy in the mitapivat arm (12.5%) compared with the placebo arm 
(25.0%).  
At baseline, more than 50% of subjects had decreased bone mineral density (T-score >-2.5 to <-1.0 or 
≤-2.5) indicating osteopenia and osteoporosis. However, only 20 (25%) subjects had a medical history 
of osteopenia, and 11 (13.8%) subjects had a known medial history of osteoporosis.  
The efficacy analysis was by intention to treat (N=80 subjects, with 40 subjects in each arm). 77.5% of 
the  subjects  randomised  (n=62  subjects)  were  included  in  the  PPS  (82.5%  in  the  mitapivat  arm  and 
72.5% in the placebo arm) for sensitivity analysis. 
Primary endpoint: For subjects with PK deficiency, the adjusted difference in Hb response rate was 
39.3%,  95%CI  (24.1,  54.6),  2-sided  p-value<0.0001.  16  subjects  (40%)  in  mitapivat  arm  were  Hb 
responders. There were no Hb responders in the placebo arm.  
Of the 16 subjects with Hb response, 13 subjects received a fixed dose of 50 mg BID, 2 subjects received 
20 mg BID and 1 subject received 5 mg BID during the Fixed Dose Period. Resuts of sensitivity analyses 
of  Hb  response  rate  and  change  from  baseline  in  Hb  concentrations  adjusting  for  concomitant 
transfusions received and excluding patients who received transfusions were consistent with the primary 
analysis.   
Key secondary endpoint: The difference between both study arms in LS mean average change from 
baseline in Hb concentrations across Weeks 16, 20, and 24 was 18.21 g/L, 95% CI (12.41, 24.01), (2-
sided p-value <0.0001).  
Most subjects in the placebo arm experienced a decrease in Hb. Among subjects dosed with mitapivat, 
16 subjects were responders and experienced increase in Hb more than 15 g/L, 19 subjects were non-
responders but experienced some level of increase in Hb (<15 g/l) and 5 subjects experienced a decrease 
in  Hb.  Of  16  Hb  responders  in  the  mitapivat  arm,  the  mean  of  average  change  from  baseline  in  Hb 
concentration was 35.07 g/L. Of the 24 non-responders, the mean change was 4.45 g/L.   
Among  the  16  responders  with  PK  deficiency,  the  median  time  to  first  ≥ 15  g/L  increase  in  Hb 
concentration from baseline was 6.57 weeks (95% CI: 6.14, 8.14).  
Subgroup analysis: Hb response rates and the average mean change from baseline in Hb at Weeks 
16, 20, and 24 were higher in the mitapivat arm than the placebo arm across all pre-specified subgroups. 
However, subjects who did not have a prior splenectomy appear to draw more benefit in term of increase 
in Hb concentration than subjects who were splenectomised (difference of Hb response rate was 21.4% 
(95%  CI:  -4.2,  45.9)  vs  83.3%  (95%  CI:  47.9,  97.9),  difference  in  mean  Hb  average  change  from 
baseline  was  11.63  g/l  (95%  CI:  6.22,  17.04)  vs  34.26  g/l  (95%  CI:  24.62,  43.90)).  The  observed

difference in effect of mitapivat on Hb changes and transfusion burden in subjects with PK deficiency 
with  and  without  splenectomy  may  be  due  to  incompletely  compensated  haemolysis  in  patients  with 
splenectomy.  
Secondary endpoints: Consistent with the mechanism of action of mitapivat, it is noticed a moderate 
improvement in PD biomarkers of haemolysis (indirect bilirubin, LDH, and haptoglobin) and biomarkers 
of haematopoietic activity (reticulocyte percentage), in subjects treated with mitapivat compared with 
placebo during the fixed dose period. However, some missing assessments at several time are noticed.  
Difference in LS mean average change from baseline in indirect bilirubin, LDH and haptoglobin across 
Weeks 16, 20, and 24 was -26.26 μmol/L (95% CI  (-37.82, -14.70); 2-sided p-value <0.0001)), -70.81 
U/L (95% CI (-115.88, -25.74), 2-sided p-value <0.0027) and 0.158 g/L (95% CI (0.043, 0.273), 2-
sided p-value <0.0079), respectively. 
Transfusions were indicated for clinically significant or poorly tolerated anaemia in 2 (5.0%) subjects in 
the mitapivat arm (2 units in 1 subject and 4 units in the other subject) and 5 (12.8%) subjects in the 
placebo arm (2 units per subject in 4 subjects and 1 unit in 1 subject).  
No  improvement  is  noticed  in  iron  biomarkers  with  study  006.  However,  data  interpretation  of  iron 
markers is limited due to short-term duration. The controlled part is limited to 24 weeks.  
The difference in LS mean (SE) on the PKDD weekly mean score between the 2 arms at Week 24 was -
3.11  (1.352),  (p  value=0.0247)  not  reaching  the  range  for  meaningful  change.  The  difference  in  LS 
mean (SE) on the PKDIA score between the 2 arms at Week 24 was -3.25 (1.574) (p value =0.0421) 
not reaching the range of meaningful change.  
PROs analyses are considered exploratory. The lack of specification and validation of the PRO endpoints 
(PKDD and PKDIA) prior to the confirmatory phase 3 trial is a limitation to the interpretation of results. 
New PRO instruments should be characterised and fully specified before the finalisation of the pivotal 
phase  3  protocol,  especially  if  they  were  intended  to  be  part  of  the  confirmatory  endpoints.  The 
improvement observed in PKDD and PKDIA scores with mitapivat are not clinically significant. Results on 
PROs are thus not included in the SmPC. 
Design and conduct of clinical study AG348-C-007 
Study  AG348-C-007  is  a  phase  3,  multicentre,  single-arm,  open-label  efficacy  and  safety  study  of 
mitapivat  in  subjects  with  PK  deficiency  who  were  regularly  receiving  blood  transfusions.  The  study 
consisted of a dose optimisation period (Part 1 of 16 weeks) followed by a fixed-dose period (Part 2 of 
24 weeks). 
In  study  AG348-C-007,  subjects  who  meet  any  of  the  following  criteria  during  screening  were  not 
enrolled:  be  homozygous  for  the  R479H  mutation  or  have  2  non-missense  mutations,  without  the 
presence of another missense mutation, in the PKLR gene or have a history of transfusions occurring on 
average more frequently than once every 3 weeks during the 52 weeks prior to signing the informed 
consent. However, there was no exclusion criterion limiting the number of RBC units transfused. Taking 
into consideration the MoA of mitapivat and the pathophysiology of the disease, it seems plausible that 
the treatment effect could be translated to these rare cases of patients who required transfusions more 
frequently than once every 3 weeks. 
In  PKD,  there  is  currently  no  strategy  of  transfusing  to  keep  the  Hb  above  a  set  nadir  with  a goal of 
avoiding complications. Rather, transfusions are individualised, based on the patient’s symptoms, level 
of  activity,  and  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  anaemia  on  their  quality  of  life.  In  study  007,  an 
Individual  Transfusion  Trigger  (ITT)  was  calculated  and  the  subject  was  to  be  transfused  when  they 
reached their ITT.  
ITT  is  the  mean  (±0.5  g/dL  or  ±0.31  mmol/L)  of  subject’s  collected  historical  pre-transfusion  Hb 
concentrations. The applicant confirmed that all subjects had complete records of transfusion history, 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 149/187 
 
 
 
including transfusion dates, number of blood units transfused, and haemoglobin concentrations within 1 
week before transfusion for at least 80% of transfusions. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with mitapivat, as assessed 
by the reduction in transfusion burden which is considered a meaningful clinical endpoint in regularly 
transfused patients. Indeed, a substantial reduction of transfusion burden should decrease transfusional 
iron  overload,  prevention  of  iron  accumulation  and  subsequent  organ  damage  and,  thus,  the  iron-
chelation therapy requirements.  
The proposed pivotal trial incorporates a variety of secondary endpoints that are relevant measures of 
improvement  in  TD  patients  with  PK  deficiency,  including  transfusion  episode  burden,  proportion  of 
subjects who became transfusion-free. PROs, markers of haemolysis, markers of iron metabolism and 
indicators of iron overload were exploratory endpoints. 
The sample size was based on feasibility and left flexible with between 20 and 40 subjects to be enrolled. 
No criteria for stopping or continuing enrolment were pre-specified. 
The null hypothesis, added with protocol amendment 1, uses a reference TRR rate of 10% for which no 
justification could be found.  No further clarification was provided by the applicant on the quantification 
of the specific 10% value of the selected threshold. As a consequence, the corresponding hypothesis test 
(against  the  10%  TRR  rate)  remains  unjustified,  and  the  associated  p-value  was  removed  from  the 
SmPC. 
The definition of the primary endpoint was updated with the first protocol amendment and the sample 
size was increased with the second amendment. Based on these updates and the flexibility in the total 
number of subjects, the study results should be considered exploratory. 
Due  to  the  change  in  primary  analysis  pre-specification,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  repeat  the 
primary endpoint analysis as per the original protocol analysis description, i.e., including the entire study 
Part 2 period regardless of treatment discontinuation / dose taper (not only the fixed dose period), and 
considering  subjects  who  discontinued  the  study  before  the  end  of  Part  2  as  non-responders.  The 
requested analysis has been performed, with results identical to the primary analysis results. It can be 
concluded that the change in analysis period definition had no impact on the study results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A  total  of  27  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  mitapivat,  21  (77.8%)  subjects  completed  study 
treatment and 20 (74.1%) subjects completed the study.  
A total of 20 study sites participated in this study. The first subject was enrolled on 26 June 2018 and 
the last subject completed on 12 November 2020. 
Primary endpoint: Among the 27 subjects who received treatment, 10 patients (37% (95% CI: 19.4%, 
57.6%)) were responders and had ≥ 33% reduction in total number of RBC units transfused during the 
fixed-dose period compared with the historical number of RBC units transfused standardised to 24 weeks.  
The mean percent reduction from historical RBC units transfused was 37.1%. One responder achieved 
reduction  between  33%  and  50%,  while  the  remaining  9  responders  achieved  a  ≥50%  reduction.  6 
subjects did not experience any reduction from historical RBC units and 8 subjects experienced a slight 
(<20%) reduction.  
As  requested,  the  applicant  provided  an  analysis of  time  to  transfusion  requirement  during  the  study 
compared with the historical transfusion burden. The results showed that the time between transfusion 
requirements  becomes  longer,  by  approximately  1  month  on  average,  with  continued  mitapivat 
treatment compared to that in the 52 weeks before informed consent.  
As  requested,  a  discussion  of  the  cases  in  which  a  subject  on  study  AG348-C-007  missed  at  least  1 
transfusion after reaching their individual TT (mean individual pretransfusion haemoglobin [Hb] during 
the  52-week  historical  period,  ±0.5  g/dL)  has  been  presented  by  the  applicant.  A  sensitivity  analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 150/187 
 
 
 
(which classified as non-responder subjects who did not complete 12 weeks of treatment and subjects 
who missed a transfusion after reaching their TT for reasons other than “clinically asymptomatic”) was 
performed. Two subjects were considered non-responders for purposes of this sensitivity analysis. The 
analysis showed that 8 subjects out of 27 were responders (29.6%; 95% CI: 13.8, 50.2, p= 0.0039).  
Secondary endpoints: There were 6 transfusion-free responders, during fixed-dose period.  
The  percent  mean  reduction  of  transfusion  episodes  during  the  fixed-dose  period  compared  with  the 
historical RBC transfusion episodes standardised to 24 weeks was 39.57%, which was consistent with 
the mean percent reduction in the number of RBC units. 
Three (11.1%) subjects achieved Hb concentrations in the normal range at least once, 8 weeks or more 
after last receiving a transfusion in the fixed-dose period. All 3 of these subjects were transfusion-free 
responders.  
Subgroup  analysis:  Results  of  subgroup  analysis  of  transfusion  reduction  responders  (TRR)  were 
homogenous  across  different  subgroups  based  on  sex,  race,  and  baseline  Hb  level.  Although,  in  the 
context  of  a  single  arm  study  with  a  small  number  of  patients  and  some  unbalanced  subgroups  it  is 
difficult  to  draw  any  conclusion.  However,  a  difference  in  the  magnitude  of  TRR  rate  is  observed  in 
subgroups based on prior splenectomy status.  
Exploratory endpoints: The mean (SD) reduction in PKDD score from baseline to dose optimisation 
week  12  was  -5.3  (11.63)  and  was  -2.4  (11.30)  at  fixed-dose  period  week  24  and  did not  reach  the 
range of meaningful change. The mean (SD) reduction in PKDIA score from baseline to dose optimisation 
Period Week 12 was -4.9 (9.97) and was -9.1 (11.50) at fixed-dose period Week 24, reaching the range 
of  meaningful  change.  These  results  are  overall  sustained  for  most  time  points  during  the  extension 
study 011. However, a high proportion of missing data was noticed (N=14 at week 24 vs 24 patients at 
baseline). Overall results on improvement of signs and symptoms and disease impact as measured by 
PKDD and PKDI are very difficult to interpret in the context of single arm study and these results remains 
completely exploratory.  
For  transfusion-free  responders,  there  was  an  improvement  in  haemolysis  markers  (indirect  bilirubin, 
haptoglobin, and LDH) during both the Dose Optimisation Period and the Fixed-Dose Period (with most 
subjects reaching values within the normal range for these markers). However, due to the limited number 
of subjects, no conclusions can be drawn. 
For non–transfusion-free responders, there were fluctuations in the levels of markers of haemolysis, but 
interpretation of these markers is limited by concomitant transfusions. 
Study 011 is an ongoing multicentre, open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety, and 
efficacy of treatment in subjects who were previously enrolled in study 006 or Study 007.  Subjects who 
received placebo in study 006 were assigned in cohort 1. Subjects who received mitapivat in study 006 
were assigned in cohort 2. Subjects who received mitapivat in Study 007 were assigned in cohort 3. 
The pooled analysis of cohort 1 and 2 at the DCO date of 12 November 2020 showed that after 24 weeks, 
the mean change from baseline was 15.98 g/L in Hb, 0.188 g/L in Hp, -22.43 μmol/L in indirect bilirubin, 
and -88.05 U/L in LDH for subjects treated with mitapivat. Slight to moderate improvement in markers 
of haemolysis was observed. However, it is difficult to contextualise the effect observed to clinical benefit 
particularly at long-term on the complications of the disease. 
Updated  long-term  efficacy  data  for  study  011  as  of  the  cut-off  date  of  12  September  2021  were 
provided.  Among the 31 NTD Hb responders, Hb response was ongoing for 26 Hb responders up to 29.1 
months  with  continued  mitapivat  treatment.  The  median  duration  of  Hb  response  was  15.1  months 
95%CI  (10.84,  19.58).  Out  of  the  5  Hb  responders  who  experienced  loss  of  Hb  response,  3  subjects 
continued to have Hb concentration increased by ≥15 g/L with ongoing treatment with mitapivat after 
the initial loss of Hb response (iei.e., loss of Hb response was due to transient dip in Hb). 
In cohort 3 of the study 011, nine out of the 10 transfusion reduction responders had ongoing transfusion 
reduction response up to 30.7 months with continued mitapivat treatment. Among the 10 TD responders, 
the median duration of TRR was 24.0 months 95%CI (17.9, 28.0). In addition, 7 out of the 8 transfusion-
Assessment report

Page 151/187 
 
 
 
free responders maintained their transfusion-free response up to 31.8 months with continued mitapivat 
treatment. The median duration of transfusion-free response was 27.0 months. 
Available long-term data suggest a slight non-significant improvement over time in some iron markers, 
as mean iron levels, hepcidin levels and transferrin saturation with mitapivat treatment but these does 
not show a change in ferritin levels. 
At cut-off date of 12 September 2021 for study AG348-C-011, ferritin remained largely stable among 
NTD  subjects  treated  with  mitapivat.  However,  slight  improvements  in  LIC  by  MRI  were  seen  with 
continued mitapivat treatment in both Hb responders and Hb non-responders of the study 006. These 
improvements were unexpectedly more pronounced in Hb non-responders patients; mean change from 
baseline in LIC at week 48 was -0.39 (2.468) among Hb responders and -3.66 (13.511) among non-
responder patients. The available data on use of chelators are not informative. 
At cut-off date of 12 September 2021 for study AG348-C-011, updated data on iron burden (ferritin and 
LIC)  were  provided  in  transfusion  free  responders  and  transfusion  reduction  responders.  Of  the  2 
transfusion-free  responders  with  baseline  LIC  high  (≥5  mg  Fe/g  dry  weight),  both  subjects  showed 
decreased levels of LIC to <5 mg F3/g dry weight after treatment with mitapivat. Out of 4 transfusion 
reduction responders with high baseline LIC levels, 3 subjects decreased LIC to <5 mg Fe/g dry weight 
after treatment with mitapivat. Although a longer follow-up is needed to highlight a significant impact 
on iron burden in transfused patients, the data provided support the conclusion that long-term treatment 
with mitapivat could have a beneficial impact on iron overload in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency. 
In any case, a longer follow-up is needed to confirm these data. 
None of the 6 transfusion-free responders increased their dose of iron chelation therapy; 1 decreased 
their  dose  of  chelation  therapy  over  the  course  of  the  study,  and  2  discontinued  chelation  therapy 
completely. In addition, the responder who became transfusion-free in Study 011 also had a decrease 
in dose of chelation therapy during the study.  
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In NTD patients, the adjusted difference in Hb response rate (mitapivat vs placebo) was 39.3%, (95% 
CI (24.1, 54.6), 2-sided p-value<0.0001). These results are overall sustained with the long treatment 
regimen. The reported results on HRQoL and improvement of symptoms of anaemia are not clinically 
meaningful  and  are  considered  exploratory  given  the  lack  of  specification  and  validation  of  the  PRO 
endpoints (PKDD and PKDIA) prior to the confirmatory study 006.    
Among the 27 TD subjects who received treatment in study 007, 10 patients (37%) had ≥ 33% reduction 
in  total  number  of  RBC  units  transfused  and  there  were  7  (26%)  transfusion  free  responders.  These 
results are overall sustained with long-term therapy.   
The  potential  benefit  of  this  therapy  on  iron  overload  was  not  sufficiently  demonstrated.  Long-term 
outcomes  (i.e.,  gallstones,  endocrine  dysfunctions,  leg  ulcers  and  osteopenia,  extramedullary 
haematopoiesis and pulmonary hypertension) are still unknown.  The choice of the trial population, with 
the  exclusion  of  patients  based  on  genotype;  those  who  had  2  non  missense  mutations  without  the 
presence  of  another  missense  mutation  or  were  homozygous  for  the  R479H  mutation  in  PKLR  gene, 
significantly limit the representativeness of PK deficient patients into the trial. 
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
Safety data for oral mitapivat (AG-348) in adult subjects with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency are mainly 
taken from 4 studies in adults: 
-  Study AG348-C-006 (Study 006 - ACTIVATE): Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled  study  evaluating  the  efficacy,  safety,  pharmacokinetics,  and  impacts  on

HRQOL of mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency not regularly receiving transfusions (26 weeks -  
80 subjects, completed); 
-  Study  AG348-C-007  (Study  007  –  ACTIVATE-T):  Phase  3,  multicenter,  open-label  study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency regularly receiving 
transfusions (42 weeks - 27 subjects, completed);  
-  Study AG348-C-003 (Study 003): Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open-label, dose ranging 
study evaluating the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical 
activity of mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency not regularly receiving transfusions (52 subjects, 
ongoing); 
-  Study AG348-C-011 (Study 011): Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, long-term extension study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency previously enrolled in 
Study AG348 C-006 or AG348-C-007 (88 subjects, ongoing) 
•  Cohort 1 : non regularly transfused subjects from the placebo arm of Study 006 
•  Cohort 2 : non regularly transfused subjects from the experimental arm of Study 006 
•  Cohort 3 : regularly transfused subjects from Study 007 
Additional supportive safety data come from 7 completed phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (n=249) 
and  an  ongoing  phase  2  study  (Study  010)  in  adult  subjects  (n=20)  with  non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassemia. 
Only  subjects  from the  pivotal  studies  006  and  007  received  mitapivat  at the  regimen  considered  for 
MA: a dose titration from 5 to 50 mg BID. Subjects from ongoing supportive studies 003 and 010 received 
fixed doses ranged from 50 mg BID to 300 mg BID.  
•  Patient exposure 
Overall, 400 adult subjects have received at least one dose of mitapivat:  
•  225 healthy subjects with single doses ranged from 5 to 2.500 mg and multiple doses of 15 to 700 
mg BID for 14 days 
•  20 subjects with non-transfusion-dependant thalassemia (NTDT) with doses ranged from 50 to 100 
mg BID for up to 29 weeks (~7.2 months)  
•  155  subjects  with  PK  deficiency,  of  whom  27  were  regularly  transfused  and  128  were  not.  These 
subjects received doses ranged from 5 mg once daily (QD) to 300 mg twice a day (BID) for up to 
58.7 months (~ 4.9 years) 
Of the 155 subjects with PK deficiency, 103 received the MA treatment schedule (studies 006, 007 and 
011), the subjects from Study 003 received either 50 mg BID (n=18) or 300 mg BID (n=34).  
The  median  duration  of  exposure  was  comparable between  regularly  transfused  (Study  007)  and not 
regularly  transfused  (Study  006)  subjects:  12.42  months  (3.7,  28.6)  and  11.55  months  (6.0,  25.4), 
respectively. Exposure duration was longer in supportive Study 003. 
In  subjects  treated  at  the  MA  regimen,  most  of  dose  reductions  were  due  to planned  discontinuation 
following  withdrawal  of  consent  (to  be  further  discussed  below).  A  sixth  of  dose  reductions  (5.8%  of 
subjects) occurred following an adverse event. 
The  use  of  concomitant  medications  was  comparable  within  the  safety  analysis  set  and  in  line  with 
standard supporting treatment for PK deficiency (i.e. folic acid, vitamin B12, iron chelation therapy and 
antipyretics/analgesics). 
Overall,  demographics  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  homogeneous  between  groups  and 
studies, confirming that the safety analysis set is a representative sample of the target population.

As subjects who initially received placebo in Study 006 were eligible for mitapivat treatment in extension 
Study 011, no meaningful comparisons could be made between the mitapivat and the placebo arms of 
Study  006  for  the  cumulative  period.  Therefore,  safety  assessment  will  mostly  be  based  on  the 
summaries of data provided for the 24-week period.

Notes: Summarised in order of decreasing frequency of subjects with events based on the frequencies observed for total subjects 
in mitapivat ≤50 mg BID group. 
The  denominator  used  to  calculate  percentages  is  N,  the  number  of  subjects  in  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  within  each  treatment 
group.  
Subjects with multiple adverse events within a PT are counted only once in that PT. 
For subjects with multiple occurrences of an adverse event, the adverse event with the maximum CTCAE grade is included in the 
summary. 
MedDRA Version 23.1 and CTCAE Version 4.03 are used. 
Grade ≥3 adverse events 
During the 24-week period, 10 subjects (25.0%) who received mitapivat in Study 006 had a Grade ≥3 
TEAE.  Hypertriglyceridaemia  and  Hypertension  each  occurred  in  2  subjects  (5.0%  each).  Events  of 
Syncope,  Musculoskeletal  pain,  Rib  fracture  occurred  once  each  in  the  same  treatment  group  (2.5% 
each). 
In regularly transfused subjects (Study 007), there were 4 subjects (14.8%) with Grade ≥3 TEAEs. Each 
event occurred once: Jugular vein occlusion, Back Pain, Joint swelling and Ovarian cyst (3.1% each). 
During  the  24-week  period,  more  Grade  ≥3  TEAEs  have  been  reported  in  not  regularly  transfused 
subjects (Study 006) compared to regularly transfused ones (Study 007). This difference is smoothed 
over the cumulative period.

Treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
More than half of headaches and nauseas reported in the regularly transfused subjects (pivotal Study 
007) were considered related to study treatment (18.5% and 14.8%, respectively). Two cases of Rash 
were also considered related to treatment, as well as cases of vomiting (3.7%), ASAT and ALAT increase 
(7.4% each). The severity of these events was mild (Grade 1 or 2). The only reported Grade ≥3 TEAE 
in this study was a Grade 3 Joint swelling. Grade ≥3 Jugular vein occlusion, Ovarian Cyst and Back pain 
were not considered to be related to treatment. 
In  subjects  who  received  mitapivat  during  the  core  period  of  Study  006,  the  following  AEs  were 
considered related mitapivat: nauseas and  transaminases increases (15.0% and 5% respectively), as 
well  as  most  headaches  (12.5%),  an  half  of  arthralgia  (5.0%),  a  third  of  hypertriglyceridaemia  (2 
subjects, 5.0%) and a quarter of abdominal pain (2.5%). All these cases were mild in severity (Grade 1 
or 2). In addition, one Grade 3 Musculoskeletal pain (2.5%) and the two Grade ≥3 Hypertriglyceridaemia 
(5.0%) were considered related to study treatment.

Serious adverse events 
Table 73 
Class and Preferred Term –24-Week Period (Safety Analysis Set) 
Summary  of  Serious  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  by  System  Organ 
Treatment-related SAEs 
Treatment-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  1.9% of  all  subjects  who  received mitapivat  during  the  24-
week period. The incidence of treatment-related SAEs was highest (6.3%) in subjects in Study 003 who 
received  mitapivat  >50  mg  BID.  There  were  no  treatment-related  SAEs  in  subjects  in  Study  007  or 
subjects who received placebo in Study 006.  
One (0.6%) subject in Study 003 who received mitapivat >50 mg BID experienced treatment-related 
SAEs of Haemolytic anaemia and Haemolysis due to abrupt withdrawal of mitapivat. One (0.6%) subject 
in Study 003 who received mitapivat >50 mg BID experienced a treatment-related SAE of Haemolytic 
anaemia; this subject did not respond to treatment with mitapivat and required blood transfusion. One 
(0.6%)  subject  in  Study  006  who  received  mitapivat  ≤50  mg  BID  had  a  treatment-related  SAE  of 
Musculoskeletal pain. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Transaminase increase 
The  AESI  transaminase  increase  is  defined  as  an  increase  of  more  than  2.5  ×  the  baseline  value  for 
subject or an increase to Grade 2. Transaminase increase was reported as AESI only in the Extension 
Period of Study 003, which does not allow relevant comparison to Studies 006 and 007. In these two 
studies,  identification  of  transaminase  increase  as  AESI  is  based  on  retrospective  review  of  liver  test 
monitoring performed during the core study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022

Eleven subjects who received mitapivat (7.0%) presented elevated transaminases. They all had baseline 
increased bilirubin, which during treatment decreased or remained at baseline values in 9 of them.  
During the 24-week period, a lower incidence of transaminase increase was observed in subjects who 
received  mitapivat  (1  subject,  2.5%)  compared  to  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  (6  subjects,  15.4% 
including one subject with Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase [AST] increase) and  regularly transfused 
subjects (Study 007, 7 subjects [25.9%]).  
These  elevations  generally  resolved  without  the  need  for  dose  modification  or  discontinuation  of 
treatment. 
Similar results were observed during the cumulative period. No serious TEAEs related to transaminases 
increase have been reported. None of the events of transaminase increase led to a dose reduction nor 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Adverse events  
Acute haemolysis 
As Hb would exceed the upper limit normal (ULN) in two subjects who received 300 mg BID of mitapivat 
(Study 003), sudden withdrawal of mitapivat was performed and caused acute haemolysis; Grade 3 SAE 
Haemolysis rapidly followed by Grade 3 Haemolytic Anaemia in the first subject and a Grade 2 nonserious 
TEAE Haemolysis in the second one. Another sudden withdrawal of treatment has been performed in a 
female subject who became pregnant (≥50 mg BID). 
During  the  Extension  Period  of  Study  003,  14  subjects  of  the  >50  mg  arm  underwent  the  newly 
implemented dose taper (starting at 300 mg BID and decreasing by 100 mg increments for 3 weeks) to 
minimise the haemolytic risk. Hb decreased was observed at 1.1 g/dL per week at most, with stabilisation 
at the new dose in eleven of them.  
Based on these findings, an adapted dose taper was implemented in the pivotal studies (see table below). 
After Week 24, five subjects of Study 006 (3 of them were non-responders regarding increase in Hb or 
decrease  of  key  markers  of  haemolysis)  underwent  this  dose  taper  and  no  haemolytic  episode  was 
reported.

Aromatase inhibition 
Aromatase  activity  is  inhibited  by  mitapivat.  As  this  enzyme  is  responsible  for  the  transformation  of 
androgens to estrogens, a decrease of estrogens and an increase in androgens in male subjects were 
expected in male subjects. 
During  the  24-week  period,  17  male  subjects  who  received  mitapivat  had  lower  limit  normal  (LLN) 
estrone  levels  on  treatment  and  26  subjects  had  high  levels  of  free  testosterone.  Estradiol  levels 
decreased but not below the LLN. 
These trends were confirmed during the cumulative period. The changes were reversible upon treatment 
discontinuation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 162/187 
 
 
 
 
In  female  subjects,  no  clear  changes  could  have  been  identified  due  to  confounding  factors  such  as 
menstrual cycle variations, type of contraceptives (hormonal or non-hormonal), and the production of 
estrogens by ovaries in women of childbearing potential. 
Also,  according  to  T-  and  Z-scores;  no  meaningful  changes  in  bone  mineral  density  were  observed, 
regardless of the gender. 
Insomnia 
Mitapivat is thought to have inhibitory activity on histamine H3 receptors without penetrating the blood 
brain barrier.  
During  the  24-week  period,  events  of  insomnia  were  widely  reported  in  the  target  population  (Study 
006, mitapivat arm: 15.0% and placebo arm: 17.9% and Study 007: 22.0%), with a considerably higher 
incidence was observed in supportive Study 003 for doses greater than 50 mg (64.0%). The occurrence 
of these events increased during the cumulative period.  
In the 4 main studies of the safety analysis set, Insomnia TEAEs  were generally transient (resolution 
over 40 days) non serious and rarely considered related to study treatment. In supportive Study 010, 
an  ongoing  phase  2  study  in  subjects  with  non-transfusion  dependent  thalassemia  (NTDT),  the  11 
reported events of Insomnia were considered to be related to the study drug. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
During the 24-week period, GI events concerned at least 40% subjects in all treatment groups. The rate 
of these events were comparable between the placebo arm of Study 006 and Study 007 (48.7% and 
48.1% respectively). A higher incidence was observed in Study 003, regardless of the dose. Nauseas 
were the most reported events (>15% in each treatment group), some of them considered drug-related 
in Study 003. 
In  healthy  subjects,  such  events  occurred  in  14  subjects  (6.2%)  and  the  frequency  of  GI  events  is 
significant (24 subjects, 10.7%). 
Triglycerides increase 
Events  of  triglycerides  increase  were  more  frequent  in  subjects  who  received  mitapivat,  especially  in 
Study 003 (≥50 mg, 27% during the cumulative period). Such events were mostly mild and transient. 
Also, no case of pancreatitis has been reported in the target population. 
Hypersensitivity 
Among the safety analysis set, some TEAEs of hypersensitivity have been reported, especially in Study 
003 for doses greater than 50 mg. Some have been considered drug-related but were mild and transient. 
Other significant events 
Overdose 
A case of overdose was reported in clinical studies: a subject originally enrolled in the mitapivat arm of 
Study 006 took 3 tablets at once (150 mg BID) instead of 50 mg BID during the long-term extension 
Study 011. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
Subjects who abruptly interrupt or discontinue mitapivat may be at risk of developing acute haemolysis; 
a  gradual  reduction  in  dosing  (dose  taper)  is  recommended.  Events  of  acute  haemolysis  that  were 
observed with mitapivat have been discussed above. 
Drug abuse 
As data cutoff, no case of drug abuse or drug dependence has been reported.

Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
The effect of mitapivat on the ability to drive vehicles and operate machinery has not been evaluated. 
As  of  the  data  cutoff  date  for  the  marketing  application,  no  effect  of  mitapivat  on  ability  to  drive  or 
operate machinery has been reported during any of the studies with mitapivat. 
• 
Laboratory findings 
No  other  unexpected  safety  finding  was  raised  from  clinical  chemistry,  haematology  and  coagulation 
parameters. Transaminase increase, triglycerides and acute haemolysis have been discussed above as 
AESIs. 
Also, no unexpected signal was raised from ECG abnormalities.

Safety in special populations 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women 
Pregnant women were excluded from studies, however two pregnancies were reported from mitapivat 
clinical trial. 
No  information  is  available  on  the  clinical  use  of  mitapivat  during  breastfeeding,  on  the  presence  of 
mitapivat in human milk, on the effect on the breastfed infant, or effects on milk production.

The vast majority of subjects with PK deficiency is under 65 years of age (96.8%, median around 36 
years  of  age).  Due  to  restrictive  inclusion  criteria  of  the  pivotal  studies,  limited  data  in  subjects  with 
renal or hepatic impairment have been provided. 
Regarding gender, there was a slightly greater amount of female subjects but no clear trend favouring 
men or women has been observed when assessing safety data. Concerning ethnicity, most subjects were 
White (126 subjects, 77.4%) or Asian (16 subjects, 10.3%). The other reported races were represented 
in smaller proportions, which did not allow meaningful comparisons. 
Splenectomy status 
About 75% of the target population had prior splenectomy. 
During the 24-week period, a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs in splenectomised subjects who received 
mitapivat was observed: 94.9% compared to 89.7% in non-splenectomised ones. Rates of TEAEs were 
comparable in both subject subgroups who received placebo. The occurrence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs  was 
higher  in  non-splenectomised  subjects  who  received  mitapivat  (27.0%  and  14.4%,  respectively)  or 
placebo (17.2% or 0%). 
During the cumulative period, the trends are reinforced. In the absence of splenectomy, more GI events 
were  reported  in  the  absence  of  splenectomy:  Nausea  (35.1%  and  24.6%,  respectively),  Diarrhoea 
(21.6% and 10.2%, respectively), and Vomiting (18.9% and 8.5%, respectively) along with Bone pain 
(13.5%  and  0%,  respectively).  Events  of  Grade  ≥3  Insomnia  were  also  more  reported  in  non-
splenectomised subjects (5.4% and 0%, respectively).

Baseline Hb 
57.4% of subjects who received mitapivat and 42.6% of subjects who received placebo had baseline Hb 
levels ≥ 8.5 g/dL. During the 24-week period, the overall incidence of TEAEs was comparable in subjects 
who received mitapivat in Study 006, regardless of baseline Hb levels (<8.5 g/dL: 89.5%, ≥8.5 g/dL: 
85.7%).  Regularly  transfused  subjects  from  Study  007  were  more  prone  to  TEAEs  when  baseline  Hb 
levels were greater than 8.5 g/dL (95% compared to 79.4% for Hb levels >8.5 g/dL).  
Extrinsic factors 
Adverse events by region 
Clinical studies with mitapivat were conducted worldwide. Most subjects with PK deficiency came from 
Western  Europe  (56.8%),  North  America  (36.1%)  or  Asia  (4.51%).  Considering  the  unbalanced 
distribution  of  subjects  across  regions,  no  meaningful  comparisons  could  be  made  regarding  the 
incidence of TEAEs.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No conclusion can be drawn on safety related to drug-drug interactions as the dedicated studies have 
not been performed. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
7  subjects  who  received  mitapivat  had  a  TEAE  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  Most  of  the 
subjects (6 of them) who discontinued study drug due to a TEAE were those who received mitapivat >50 
mg BID in Study 003. Similar trends were observed concerning dose interruptions and dose reductions.

2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall safety experience for mitapivat is derived from a clinical development program consisting of 
12 studies.  
The primary safety data in adults with PK deficiency are provided by two pivotal studies:  
•  Study 006, a placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in non-transfusion-dependant (NTD) subjects 
•  Study 007, an open-label Phase 3 study in transfusion-dependant (TD) subjects.  
Main supportive safety data come from Study 011, the long-term extension of pivotal studies and Study 
003, an open-label phase 2 study in NTD subjects.  
Additional supportive safety data from an ongoing phase 2 study in subjects with NTD thalassemia and 
seven studies in healthy volunteers have also been provided.

Out of the 155 subjects with PK deficiency included the safety analysis set, 106 were included in pivotal 
studies: 40 mitapivat and 39 placebo subjects of Study 006 and 27 subjects of Study 007 who received 
5 to 50 mg BID of mitapivat. 
This  sample  of  subjects  was  considered  overall  representative  of  the  target  population  in  terms  of 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics. However, the data in subjects over 65 years is very 
limited.  
Patient exposure 
The median duration of treatment was comparable between both studies 006 and 007: 12.42 months 
(3.7, 28.6) and 11.55 months (6.0, 25.4), respectively.  
As of the 12 November 2020, due to the rarity of the disease, a limited number of subjects have been 
exposed to study treatment: only 45% and 51.9% of recruited participants in the pivotal studies 006 
and 007, respectively, have completed at least 12 months of treatment at data cut-off. As mitapivat is 
intended  to  be  used  on  a  daily  basis  and  for  the  long-term  treatment  of  pyruvate  kinase  deficiency 
anaemia, longer-term safety data from the ongoing Study 011 were provided during the procedure in 
order better characterise mitapivat safety profile, based on the identification of potential chronic toxicity, 
rare and/or longer-term complications.  
The  updated safety data from Study 011 have been provided (new data cut-off: 12 September 2021). 
Study 011 is the Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, long-term extension study in adults with PK deficiency 
originally enrolled in Study 006 or 007 with 3 distinctive cohorts:  
-  Cohort 1: non transfusion-dependent (NTD) subjects from the placebo arm of Study 006 
-  Cohort 2: NTD subjects from the experimental arm of Study 006 
-  Cohort 3: transfusion-dependent (TD) subjects from Study 007  
The  updated  median  duration  of  exposure  was  18.55  months  (range  1.9  to  35.6  months)  with 
comparable  rates  in  TD  and  NTD  transfused  subjects  (19.25  ±  11.084  months  and  21.26  ±  8.720 
months, respectively). 72% of subjects received mitapivat for more than 12 months and 29% of subjects 
received treatment for more than 24 months. 
Treatment discontinuation now concerned a third of the target population (35 subjects, 33.3% versus 
24.3% initially), still driven by TD subjects from the pivotal Study 007 (15 subjects [55.6%] versus 48.1 
% initially).  
Overall, these events were still driven by withdrawal of consent (19/35, 18.1% of subjects from pivotal 
studies), which raised the question of the long-term tolerability of the treatment.  
Treatment discontinuation due to AE remained rare; an additional case was reported, bring up the total 
to two NTD subjects.  
Adverse events 
TEAEs were presented by individual study based on the highest dose taken (≤50 mg BID or >50 mg 
BID)  over  two  analysis  periods:  the  24-week  on-treatment  period  and  the  cumulative  period,  which 
includes an additional period of 28 days of post-treatment follow-up.  
TEAEs were presented by individual study based on the highest dose taken (≤50 mg BID or >50 mg 
BID)  over  two  analysis  periods:  the  24-week  on-treatment  period  and  the  cumulative  period,  which 
includes an additional period of 28 days of post-treatment follow-up. 
Initially, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between groups and studies: 89.7% in the placebo 
arm; 87.5% in the mitapivat arm of Study 006 and 88.9% in the open-label study 007. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 167/187 
 
 
 
Treatment-related TEAEs were more frequent in regularly transfused subjects (63.0% in Study 007 vs 
57.5%  in  Study  006),  which  was  expected  due  to  repeated  transfusions.  Also,  a  low  number  of 
treatment-related Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was observed in pivotal studies: 1 in regularly transfused subjects 
and 3 in occasionally transfused subjects, including 1 SAE.  
Most common TEAEs, all doses included, were: Headache (36.1%), Nausea (21.3%), Insomnia (15.5%), 
Nasopharyngitis (14.2%), Fatigue (12.3%), Back pain (11.0%) and Arthralgia (10.3%). 
As  of  the  updated  data  cutoff  (12  September  2021),  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  increased  but 
remained similar between groups and studies: 97.4% in Cohort 1; 95.0% Cohort 2 and 100.0% in Cohort 
3. 
As  of  the  updated  data  cutoff,  overall  in  the  target  population  reported  most  common  TEAEs  were 
consistent with what has been previously observed. 
Whereas treatment-related TEAEs were initially more frequent in TD, such events became comparable 
between the three cohorts at time of updated data cutoff, driven by a largest increase in Cohort 1 (7 
additional subjects) followed by Cohort 2 (4 additional subjects) and then Cohort 1 (1 additional subject). 
This was not unexpected considering that subjects in Cohort 1 started mitapivat treatment in Study 011 
(i.e. receiving placebo in the parent study).  
Furthermore, the number of Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related TEAEs remained low (6 subjects, 5.7%).  
Transfusion-dependant  subjects  (Cohort  3)  remained  more  susceptible  to  infections  and  experienced 
more  nausea  (40.7%),  vomiting  and  fatigue  (25.9%  each),  probably  due  to  recurrent  and  persistent 
transfusions. Aminotransferase levels were also higher in this subgroup (ALAT: 40.7%, ASAT: 22.2%), 
which was expected since transfusions cause iron overload which disrupts liver function. When assessed 
as related to treatment, these events were mild to moderate in severity. 
The only reported treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAE was a Grade 3 Joint swelling. At time of updated 
DLP, the additional case of treatment-related Grade 3 ASAT increased does not impact mitapivat safety 
profile.  
Initially,  in  the  pivotal  Study  006,  events  of  Arthralgia,  Abdominal  pain  (10.0%  each),  Hot  flush  and 
Hypertriglyceridaemia  (7.5%  each)  were  more  frequent  compared  with  other  treatment  groups.  The 
following AEs were considered as related to mitapivat:  nauseas and transaminases increases (15.0% 
and  5%  of  subjects  respectively),  headaches  (12.5%  of  subjects),  an  half  of  arthralgia  (5.0%  of 
subjects), hypertriglyceridaemia (2 subjects, 5.0% of subjects) and abdominal pain (2.5% of subjects). 
All these cases were mild in severity (Grade 1 or 2). In addition, one Grade 3 Musculoskeletal pain and 
both events of Grade ≥3 Hypertriglyceridaemia (5.0%) were considered related to study treatment. 
The two treatment-related Grade 3 events of Hypertriglyceridaemia reported in Study 006 are no longer 
of  concern  since  these  events  occurred  in  overweight  subjects  presenting  elevated  triglycerides  at 
baseline,  thus  ruling  out  a  potential  causal  relationship  between  severe  triglycerides  increase  and 
mitapivat treatment.  
All  the  treatment-related  TEAEs  under  the  SOC  ‘Musculoskeletal  or  connective  tissue  disorders’  were 
assessed  as  not  related  to  mitapivat  treatment  by  the  applicant  despite  assessed  as  related  by  the 
investigators; the applicant considered that these cases were confounded by past medical history and/or 
the underlying disease. This is acknowledged but causal relationship still cannot be ruled out. Further 
longer-term data will hopefully allow a better characterisation of BMD decrease potentially associated 
with mitapivat treatment, and close monitoring in PSURs should be ensured.  
Also, as of 12 September 2021, Osteopenia became frequent within the safety analysis set: events were 
reported in both populations who received mitapivat in the parent studies (1 case [3.7%] in Cohort 3 
and 6 cases [15.0%] in Cohort 2). These events cannot be disentangled from the mitapivat inhibitory 
effect on aromatase (please refer to the section dedicated to AESIs).  
In NTD subjects who initially received placebo (Cohort 1), the frequency of headaches and initial insomnia 
was higher compared to the other groups, which is consistent with previous observations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 168/187 
 
 
 
The additional treatment-related TEAEs occurred mainly in this cohort, led by sleep disturbance (Middle 
insomnia, Initial insomnia) and general condition disturbance (Headache, Restless leg syndrome, Muscle 
spasms and Gastroenteritis). They were generally mild in severity. 
Five  additional  subjects  with  SAEs  have  been  reported,  mostly  in  the  same  cohort:  Seizure,  Varicella 
zoster virus (VZV) infection, Syncope, Haemolysis and Gastroenteritis (1 subject each, 2.6%), of whom 
the events of Seizure and Gastroenteritis (resolved with treatment so not of concern) were considered 
treatment-related.  
Provided data suggest that events of Hot Flush occurred on treatment onset, regardless reported changes 
in sex hormones.  
Also, a common cause underlying headache and hot flush could be either vascular or endocrine in nature, 
or both. Changes in sex hormones have been investigated given the known aromatase inhibitory activity 
of the drug. Quite peculiarly, the effect of mitapivat on vital signs, including blood pressure and heart 
rate, had not been formally investigated, even though cases of hypertension have been described (2.6% 
in the group of all doses included vs 0% in placebo) that were among the most common causes of Grade 
≥3 events (1.7%).  
During the procedure, information on the two (out of 40) patients in the mitapivat group who experienced 
hypertension  as  AE  were  provided,  revealing  comorbidities  as  confounding  factors.  However,  a  trend 
towards BP increase in this short-term course of treatment was observed. The small sample size might 
be insufficient to detect clinically relevant effects associated to chronic therapy and in particular groups 
of  patients  depending  on  age,  sex  and  co-morbidities.  Considering  that  aromatase  inhibition  with 
oestrogen suppression affects endothelial function and vascular tone, and the resulting level of vascular 
resistance,  a  potential  effect  of  mitapivat  on  blood  pressure  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Therefore, 
cardiovascular parameters should be monitored to better define the effect of  mitapivat in the treated 
population.  Collection  of  BP  data  through  the  ongoing  long-term  extension  PK  deficiency  studies  and 
review of any cardiovascular events through routine pharmacovigilance can be considered sufficient to 
detect relevant signals. 
Furthermore,  special  considerations  merit  the  potential  risk  of  carcinogenicity  that  has  emerged  from 
preclinical studies. In the intended population, iron overload due to the underlying disease represents 
and additional risk factor for tumorigenesis.  
Although data accumulated so far indicate improvement in iron overload related clinical parameters, the 
risk  factor  persists  despite  treatment  due  to  the  underlying  disease.  Considering  the  predisposing 
conditions,  the  relevance  of  the  preclinical  findings is  of  difficult  interpretation  and  a  potential  risk  of 
tumorigenesis cannot be excluded, at this stage. Therefore, the proposal for monitoring carcinogenicity 
AEs  as  part  of  the  planned  Category  3  PASS,  together  with  routine  pharmacovigilance  activity  as 
contemplated in the RMP, is considered appropriate. A report specifically addressing the carcinogenicity 
AEs  is  expected  in  the  future  as  part  of  the  Category  3  PASS  study  report  and  as  well  from  routine 
pharmacovigilance activity.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Transaminase increase 
Eleven subjects who received mitapivat (7.0%) presented elevated transaminases. They all had baseline 
increased bilirubin which during treatment decreased or remained at baseline values in 9 of them. 
A lower incidence of transaminase increase was observed in subjects who received mitapivat (1 subject, 
2.5%)  compared  to  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  (6  subjects,  15.4)  and  regularly  transfused  subjects 
(Study 007, 7 subjects [25.9%]). 
Elevated  liver  enzymes  were  expected  in  placebo-treated  subjects  as  hepatic  activity  is  increased  in 
subjects with PK deficiency. Indeed, the liver and spleen work together to destroy aging and defective 
RBCs, resulting in intra-tissue haemolysis. In addition, a higher incidence of transaminase increases was 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 169/187 
 
 
 
also expected in regularly transfused subjects as repeated transfusions cause iron overload which affects 
liver function. 
These  elevations  generally  resolved  without  the  need  for  dose  modification  or  discontinuation  of 
treatment. Also, no serious TEAEs related to transaminases increase have been reported. None of the 
events of transaminase increase led to a dose reduction nor discontinuation of study treatment. 
Considering  the  timing  of  this  AESI,  its  reversibility  and  the  associated  underlying  haemolysis,  it  is 
considered  that  there  is  no  causal  relationship  between  mitapivat  administration  and  transaminase 
increases in pivotal Study 006; a lower incidence of increased ALT/AST was observed in the mitapivat 
group, independent of responder status.  
In the absence of a control arm in Study 007 with subjects undergoing transfusion, the effect of mitapivat 
on  liver  function  could  not  have  been  fully  disentangled  from  the  underlying  hepatic  dysfunction  and 
detrimental  effect  of  blood  transfusions.  The  two  cases  of  treatment-related  transaminase  increases 
reported in Study 007 have been discussed. Mitapivat causality has been excluded for the first one due 
to  confounding  factors,  however  the  second  one  remains  of  concern.  Indeed,  a  clinically  relevant 
transaminase  increase  was  observed  upon  treatment  discontinuation,  suggesting  a  possibly  related 
haemolysis following mitapivat dose reduction.  
Acute haemolysis 
Sudden withdrawal of mitapivat was performed in two subjects from Study 003 (>50 mg BID) when Hb 
levels  would  exceed  the  upper  limit  normal  (ULN),  leading  to  acute  haemolysis.  Implementation  of  a 
dose taper (starting at 300 mg BID and decreasing by 100 mg increments for 3 weeks) in 14 subjects 
from this arm induced a decrease in Hb levels, which stabilised in eleven of them and helped avoiding 
such situation.  
A different dose taper (see SmPC) was implemented in pivotal studies and performed in 5 subjects from 
Study 006 and signs of mild haemolysis were reported in some Hb responders and non-responders. Also, 
two cases of haemolysis were reported in Study 007. 
Clarifications on subjects who missed at least a dose of study treatment, underwent a dose taper and/or 
presented signs of haemolysis (even mild signs) were provided. 
Data provided during the procedure showed that the reported Grade 2 or 3 cases of Haemolysis were 
not considered related to treatment.  
Mild signs of haemolysis were reported either following increased Hb response or the final recommended 
dose taper in subjects not entering the extension. Generally, haemolytic markers returned at baseline 
without action be taken with mitapivat treatment. 
The clinical and safety impact of missed doses was discussed. Most events occurred at doses >50 mg 
BID without any emerging safety signals. Therefore, no additional RMMs are deemed necessary. 
Acute haemolysis is mentioned in SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.8 and is listed as an important identified risk 
in the RMP. The recommended dose taper is present in section 4.2.  
Aromatase inhibition 
Aromatase  activity  is  inhibited  by  mitapivat.  As  this  enzyme  is  responsible  for  the  transformation  of 
androgens  to  estrogens,  a  decrease  of  estrogens  and  an  increase  in  androgens  in  male  subjects  are 
expected in male subjects. Indeed, these events were observed: 17 male subjects (44.7%) who received 
mitapivat had lower limit normal (LLN) estrone levels on treatment and 26 male subjects (66.4%) had 
high levels of free testosterone. Estradiol levels decreased but not below the LLN. 
In  female  subjects,  no  clear  changes  could  have  been  identified  due  to  confounding  factors  such  as 
menstrual cycle variations, type of contraceptives, and production of estrogens by ovaries in women of 
childbearing potential. 
In addition, as estrogens play a key role in bone growth and maturation, mitapivat-mediated aromatase 
inhibition  could  be  associated  with  increased  bone  fragility,  which  is  of  concern  and  a  thorough 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 170/187 
 
 
 
investigation  of  the  relationship  between  aromatase  inhibition,  menstrual  disorders  and  bone  density 
loss, along with discussion of corresponding TEAEs was performed during the procedure.  The data as 
presented do not allow to determine the potential effects of the off-target aromatase inhibition on the 
safety profile of the male and female subjects who experienced changes in sex hormones. Difference in 
sample sizes in men and confounding factors in women did not allow to draw any meaningful conclusions. 
However ‘Changes in sex hormones’ should be closely monitored in upcoming PSURs, as part of PSUR 
safety concerns in order to better characterise this risk in real life settings. 
Furthermore,  updated  data  show  that  the  subjects’  T-scores  mainly  remained  into  the  same  baseline 
category  during  mitapivat  treatment.  However,  it  was  not  specified  whether  or  not  these  scores 
decreased during treatment. If so, provided results would not be inconsistent with a possible worsening 
of  pre-existing  bone  fragility  in  patients  treated  with  mitapivat,  especially  in  those  who  have  been 
receiving  treatment  for  the  longest  time.  As  this  reinforces  the  concern  about  mitapivat  long-term 
tolerability, longer-term data and close monitoring of BMD decrease are needed to rule out a potential 
causal relationship. 
Insomnia 
Mitapivat is thought to have inhibitory activity on histamine H3 receptors without penetrating the blood 
brain barrier, which is unlikely since these receptors, involved in wakefulness, are widely distributed in 
the striatum, nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex. 
Events of insomnia were frequently reported in the target population (Study 006, mitapivat arm: 15.0% 
and  placebo  arm:  17.9%  and  Study  007:  22.0%),  with  a  considerably  higher  incidence  observed  in 
supportive Study 003 with doses greater than 50 mg (64.0%). 
Insomnia TEAEs were generally transient (resolution over 40 days), non-serious and rarely considered 
related  to  study  treatment.  Interestingly,  in  the  supportive  Study  010,  an  ongoing  phase  2  study  in 
subjects with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT), the 11 reported events of Insomnia were 
considered to be related to the study drug.  
In  view  of  the  numerous  cases  of  insomnia  reported  in  clinical  studies,  the  inclusion  of  this  adverse 
reaction in the SmPC is considered adequate and the proposed wording is acceptable. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
GI  events  concerned  at  least  40%  subjects  in  all  treatment  groups.  The  rate  of  these  events  was 
comparable between the placebo arm of Study 006 and Study 007 (48.7% and 48.1% respectively). A 
higher incidence was observed in Study 003, regardless of the dose. Nausea were the most reported GI 
events (>15% in each treatment group). The possible causes for this significant occurrence of nausea in 
the treatment arms and in the placebo arm (especially with regard to its composition) along with listing 
of this event at the appropriate frequencies in the product information were discussed.   
Considering the review of excipients provided by the applicant, the potential relationship between the 
placebo composition and the significant frequency of nausea in the placebo arm is not a concern.  
This AE has been listed in the SmPC, as requested.  
Triglycerides increase 
Events  of  triglycerides  increase  were  more  frequent  in  subjects  who  received  mitapivat,  especially  in 
Study 003 (≥50 mg, 27% during the cumulative period). Such events were mostly mild and transient. 
Also, no case of pancreatitis has been reported in the target population. Based on provided narratives of 
subjects with Grade 3 Hypertriglyceridemia that occurred in subjects with confounding factors, no update 
of the SmPC regarding this risk is finally deemed necessary. 
Hypersensitivity 
Mild and transient TEAEs of hypersensitivity have been reported, mostly for doses greater than 50 mg 
BID. The considered treatment schedule for MA, along with the mention in section 4.3 of the SmPC, are 
considered adequate to minimise the risk.

Other significant events 
‘Events of endocrinological interest’ were initially not investigated. Such events apparently occurred in 
16 subjects (15.2%), including 4 additional subjects as of the updated data cut-off. These subjects were 
all  from  Cohort  1  and  experienced  either  Alopecia  (no  case  in  the  original  MAA)  or  Dysmenorrhea  (2 
subjects each, 5.3%). 
In the absence of comparative data from the initial data cut-off, it was difficult to draw any meaningful 
conclusions regarding the evolution in the trend in these AEs based on these results.Longer-term data 
should be provided post-approval in order to allow  for an evaluation of the impact of mitapivat treatment 
on ‘events of endocrinological interest’. 
It  should  be  noted  that  no  new  unexpected  safety  finding  was  raised  from  ECG  abnormalities  and 
laboratory findings, i.e. clinical chemistry haematology and coagulation parameters. 
Overdose 
A case of overdose was reported in Study 011: a subject took 150 mg BID instead of 50 mg BID during 
70 days.  
This dose error was not associated with any major AEs considered related to mitapivat.  
In order to minimise this risk identified during the clinical studies, the tablets are packaged in such a 
way as to avoid any confusion. Also, the wording proposed in section 4.9 of the SmPC is acceptable.   
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
The effect of mitapivat on the ability to drive vehicles and operate machinery has not been evaluated, 
this  remains  unknown.  Considering  listing  of  Insomnia  as  ‘very  common’  in  SmPC  section  4.8,  the 
following text has been included in SmPC section 4.7 as per QRD template: at least minor influence on 
the ability to drive and use machines should be considered. 
Safety in special populations 
There are no or very limited available data on mitapivat use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-
associated risks. Animal studies indicate harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. In addition, 
clinical  data  on  off-target  aromatase  inhibition  are  very  limited  and  are  considered  an  issue  when 
mitapivat is used during pregnancy. Cases of pregnancy occurred during the clinical experimentation of 
mitapivat. No safety issues have been identified. However, pre-clinical data demonstrated embryo-foetal 
toxicity. Consequently and according to the GVP, the risk “embryo-fetal toxicity”  has been classified as 
an Important Potential Risk in the RMP of mitapivat. 
No  unexpected  safety  finding  was  raised  from  sex,  race,  region  and  Hb  levels  subgroups.  Concerns 
regarding subjects over 65 years of age have been already mentioned above: considering the limited 
available data, the safety profile of mitapivat in this population should be further discussed considering 
the questioned effect of the drug on the vascular system, bone density as related to hormonal changes, 
the  potential  carcinogenicity  and  drug  interactions.  A  subgroup  analysis  for  the  5  subjects  above  65 
years of age, with a comparison to younger patients was provided. However, the data were not conclusive 
due to difference in sample sizes. An appropriate wording was added in section 5.1 of the SmPC to clearly 
inform physicians on the limited data currently available in this subpopulation.  
In addition, due to restrictive inclusion criteria of the pivotal studies, limited data in subjects with renal 
or hepatic impairment have been provided. As a study in subjects with hepatic impairment is currently 
ongoing, only the safety profile of mitapivat in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment has been 
discussed.  
As few subjects with impaired renal function were included in mitapivat studies in PK deficiency (i.e. 28 
mitapivat  and  4  placebo  subjects  versus  125  mitapivat  and  35  placebo  subjects  with  normal  renal 
Assessment report

function), no meaningful comparison can be made from the submitted subgroup analysis. Therefore, the 
wording proposed in section 4.2 to reflect this lack of data is acceptable.    
Regarding  splenectomy  status,  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  splenectomised 
subjects: 94.9% vs 89.7% in non-splenectomised ones.  
Since the spleen is deeply involved in the immune system, splenectomised subjects are by essence more 
susceptible to infections and therefore more fragile. However, these subjects presented less GI events 
and were less prone to insomnia compared with subjects without prior splenectomy.  
Regarding GI events, the observed difference in the frequency of subjects with GI events observed in 
non-splenectomised subjects who received mitapivat appears to be eliminated in the placebo arm, thus 
suggesting a study bias due to inter-individual variability. 
Moreover, a greater frequency of Insomnia in non-splenectomised subjects was observed in all treatment 
and  placebo  groups,  as  outlined  by  initial  CHMP  assessment  (for  ≤50  mg  BID:  35.5%  vs.  21.1%  in 
splenectomised subjects). Such results are unlikely to be related to a study bias but may be linked to 
aromatase inhibition. Insomnia is already listed in the SmPC. The applicant discussed whether or not the 
effects of aromatase inhibition are greater in non-splenectomised subjects. However, due to difference 
in sample sizes, no conclusion could have been drawn from presented data. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and others interactions 
No conclusion can be drawn on safety related to drug-drug interactions as the dedicated studies have 
not been performed. 
Dose modifications and discontinuations due to adverse events 
Few discontinuations or dose modifications due to adverse events occurred under the MA regimen, this 
supporting the relevance of the dose titration used in pivotal studies. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  mitapivat  is  adequately  characterised  through  both  pivotal  studies  and  the 
supportive extension study. The safety profile is manageable.

2.6.4.   Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022

2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 17.02.2022. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Pyrukynd (mitapivat) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The claimed therapeutic indication is “the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult 
patients”.  Pyruvate  kinase  deficiency  (PKD)  is  a  glycolytic  defect  causing  congenital  non-spherocytic 
haemolytic anaemia. 
The aim of the treatment is to improve haemolytic anaemia associated with the disease. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no standard guidelines for treating patients with PK deficiency. Current management remains 
supportive treating the symptoms of lifelong haemolytic anaemia and associated complications, with red 
cell  transfusions,  chelation  and  splenectomy.  Decisions  to  transfuse  and/  or  splenectomise  must  be 
individualised. Haematopoietic stem cell transplant has been pursued in a small number of patients with 
mixed outcomes.  
There  is  an  unmet  need  for  a  safe  and  effective  therapy  that  specifically  targets  the  underlying 
pathophysiology  of  PK  deficiency,  and  thereby  improves  chronic  haemolytic  anaemia,  prevents  or 
reduces the need for transfusions, reduces iron loading and decreases disease burden, improves quality 
of life (QOL), and has the potential to prevent long-term complications.  
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development consisted of two phase 3 pivotal studies in adult subjects with PK deficiency 
across  a  broad  range  of  transfusion  needs.  Study  AG348-C-006  was  a  randomised,  double-blind, 
controlled, multicentre study in non-transfusion dependent adult subjects with PK deficiency, to evaluate 
the efficacy, and safety of mitapivat compared to placebo with a primary endpoint the rate of Hb response 
defined as ≥1.5 g/dl increase in Hb concentration (N=80). Study AG348-C-007 was a phase 3, single-
arm, open-label study in transfusion-dependent subjects with a primary endpoint, transfusion reduction 
rate, defined as a ≥33% reduction in the number of RBC units transfused during standardised period. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the DCO date of the study 006, 40% (16 subjects) of subjects treated with mitapivat achieved an Hb 
response compared with 0% on placebo. The randomisation stratification adjusted difference in response 
rate was 39.3%, 95%CI (24.1, 54.6), 2-sided p-value <0.0001.  
The difference between both study arms in LS mean average change from baseline in Hb concentrations 
across Weeks 16, 20, and 24, was 18.21 g/L, 95% CI (12.41, 24.01) (2-sided p-value <0.0001).  
In  regard  to  biomarkers  of  haemolysis,  the  difference  in  LS  mean  average  change  from  baseline  in 
indirect bilirubin, LDH, and haptoglobin across Weeks 16, 20, and 24 were -26.26 μmol/L (95% CI: -
37.82,  -14.70),  -70.81  U/L,  (95%  CI:-115.88,  -25.74)  and  0.158  g/L,  (95%  CI:  0.043,  0.273), 
respectively. The difference in LS mean (SE) on the PKDD weekly mean score and PKDIA score between 
the 2 arms at Week 24 was -3.11 (1.352), and -3.25 (1.574). 
At the DCO date of study 007, out of the 27 TD patients with PK deficiency, 10 patients were responders 
and had ≥ 33% reduction in RBC units transfused during the fixed-dose period standardised to 24 weeks 
compared with the historical number of RBC units (TRR rate: 37%, 95% CI: 19.4%, 57.6%). The mean 
percent reduction from historical RBC units transfused was 37.1%. Among the 10 responders, 9 subjects 
achieved a ≥50% reduction in RBC units transfused and 6 (22.2%) subjects were transfusion-free. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 180/187 
 
 
 
percent  mean  reduction  of  transfusion  episodes  during  the  Fixed-Dose  Period  compared  with  the 
historical RBC transfusion episodes was 39.57%. 
At the DCO date of study 011 (12 September 2021), among the 31 NTD Hb responders, Hb response 
was ongoing for 26 Hb responders up to 29.1 months with continued mitapivat treatment. The median 
duration  of  Hb  response  was  15.1  months  95%CI  (10.84,  19.58).  Out  of  the  5  Hb  responders  who 
experienced loss of Hb response, 3 subjects continued to have Hb concentration increased by ≥15 g/L 
with ongoing treatment with mitapivat after the initial loss of Hb response. 
Nine out of the 10 transfusion reduction responders had ongoing transfusion reduction response up to 
30.7 months with continued mitapivat treatment. Among the 10 TD responders, the median duration of 
TRR  was  24.0  months  95%CI  (17.9,  28.0).  In  addition,  7  out  of  the  8  transfusion-free  responders 
maintained their transfusion-free response up to 31.8 months with continued mitapivat treatment.    
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While  the  pivotal  studies  006  and  007  enrolled  subjects  with  different  transfusion  needs  to  allow 
measurement  of  the  respective  primary  endpoints,  there  are  serious  concerns  about  the 
representativeness of the trial population given restrictions in selection of patients related to genotype 
in PKLR gene. Patients who had 2 non missense mutations without the presence of another missense 
mutation or were homozygous for the R479H mutation in PKLR gene were excluded from both trials. It 
is therefore uncertain if these patients may respond to treatment. The lack of specification and validation 
of the PRO endpoints (PKDD and PKDIA) prior to the confirmatory phase 3 study 006 is a limitation to 
the results interpretation. No clinically significant effect of mitapivat on symptoms and disease burden 
was achieved and results are only of exploratory nature given above raised methodological concerns. 
The study 007 is a single-arm clinical trial aimed at investigating the efficacy of mitapivat in TD patients. 
There are obvious uncertainties related to the design of a single arm study due to the lack of comparator 
and potential bias related to selection and measurements.  
Analysis of iron markers in pivotal studies are of exploratory nature. Controlled results on ferritin and 
LIC  in  NTD  patients  are  limited  to  only  24  weeks  and  no  improvement  was  observed.  Based  on  the 
current long-term non-controlled data, ferritin remained largely stable. Slight improvements in LIC by 
MRI were seen with continued mitapivat treatment in some patients. 
It is difficult to contextualise the effect observed on haemolysis/haematopoetic markers to clinical benefit 
particularly at long-term on the complications of the disease. The relation between the improvement of 
haemolytic anaemia and improvement of disease course or long-term outcomes is still not known. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
155  subjects  with  PK  deficiency  were  included  the safety  analysis  set,  108  from  both  pivotal  studies. 
Overall, this sample of subjects was considered overall representative of the target population for the 
safety analysis, in terms of demographics and baseline disease characteristics.  
TEAEs were presented by individual study based on the highest dose taken (≤50 mg BID or >50 mg 
BID)  over  two  analysis  periods:  the  24-week  on-treatment  period  and  the  cumulative  period,  which 
includes an additional period of 28 days of post-treatment follow-up. 
As  of  the  updated  data  cut-off  (12  September  2021),  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  increased  but 
remained similar between groups and studies: 97.4% in Cohort 1; 95.0% Cohort 2 and 100.0% in Cohort 
3 (versus 89.7%; 87.5% and 88.9%, respectively). 
Overall,  in  the  target  population,  reported  most  common  TEAEs  were  consistent  with  what  has  been 
previously observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 181/187 
 
 
 
Also,  Osteopenia  became  frequent  within  the  safety  analysis  set:  events  were  reported  in  both 
populations who received mitapivat in the parent studies (1 case [3.7%] in Cohort 3 and 6 cases [15.0%] 
in Cohort 2). These events cannot be disentangled from the mitapivat inhibitory effect on aromatase. 
Whereas treatment-related TEAEs were initially more frequent in TD subjects (63.0% in Study 007 vs 
57.5% in Study 006), due to repeated transfusions, such events became comparable between the three 
cohorts, driven by a largest increase in Cohort 1 (7 additional subjects) followed by Cohort 2 (4 additional 
subjects) and then Cohort 1 (1 additional subject).  
Initially,  a  low  number  of  treatment-related  Grade  ≥  3  TEAEs  was  observed  in  pivotal  studies:  1  TD 
subjects (Joint Swelling) and 3 in NDT subjects (Musculoskeletal pain, 2 cases of Hypertriglyceridaemia), 
including 1 SAE (Grade 3 Hypertriglyceridaemia). The number of such events remained low (6 subjects, 
5.7%): two additional events were reported in Cohort 1 (Grade 3 Gastroenteritis and Grade 3 Seizure). 
Among  the  five  additional  SAEs  reported,  only  the  two  above  mentioned  SAEs  were  considered 
treatment-related. 
Few discontinuations or dose modifications due to adverse events occurred under the MA regimen, this 
supporting the relevance of the dose titration used in pivotal studies. 
Acute haemolysis was an identified risk associated with mitapivat. Sudden withdrawal of mitapivat was 
performed in two subjects from supportive Study 003 (>50 mg BID) when Hb levels would exceed the 
upper limit normal (ULN), leading to acute haemolysis. Implementation of a dose taper (starting at 300 
mg  BID  and  decreasing  by  100  mg  increments  for  3  weeks)  in  14  subjects  from  this  arm  induced  a 
decrease in Hb levels, which stabilised in eleven of them.  
A different dose taper was implemented in pivotal studies and successfully performed in 5 subjects (of 
which 3 Hb non-responders) from Study 006. 
Moreover, mitapivat inhibits aromatase activity. Through the conversion of androgens to estrogens, this 
enzyme  plays  a  key  role  in  bone  growth  and  maturation.  Changes  in  sex  hormones  (increase  of 
androgens, decrease of estrogens) have been observed in male subjects. These changes were reversible 
upon treatment discontinuation. 
In addition, GI events initially concerned at least 40% subjects in all treatment groups. The rate of these 
events  was  comparable  between  the  placebo  arm  of  Study  006  and  Study  007  (48.7%  and  48.1% 
respectively). Nausea were the most reported GI events (>15% in each treatment group), which was 
confirmed by updated safety data. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Considering the updated safety data, the chronic toxicity of treatment should be further investigated in 
appropriately designed post-marketing studies/registries. 
Also, few subjects over 65 years of age (5 subjects, 4.6%) were included. An appropriate wording has 
been  added  in  SmPC,  section  5.1  to  reflect  that  it  was  not  possible  to  determine  whether  the  safety 
profile of mitapivat in this sub-population was comparable to that of the under 65 years of age. 
The  potential  for  an  effect  on  blood  pressure  of  mitapivat  has  been  recognised  based  on  biological 
plausibility and considering the observed results. Cardiovascular parameters in patients will be monitored 
through Study 011 to better define the effect of mitapivat in the treated population. 
Regarding acute haemolysis, the dose taper implemented in supportive Study 003 to reduce the risk of 
haemolysis seems effective. Also, the clinical impact of reported missed doses was remote, as depicted 
in the data provided by the applicant. 
Regarding the AESI aromatase inhibition, in female subjects, the adverse events identified as possibly 
associated with changes in sex hormones were discussed. Due to confounding factors, it is not possible 
to determine whether or not the reported events are related to mitapivat.

In addition, although no meaningful changes in bone mineral density have been observed in both gender, 
impact of mitapivat treatment on these subjects with fragile bones still cannot be ruled out. Longer-term 
data will  generate more information on this aspect post-approval. 
Nauseas  were  the  most  reported  GI  event  in  subjects  who  received  mitapivat,  independently  of  the 
transfusion burden (25.9% in TD subjects versus 25.0% in NTD subjects). This AE has been listed in the 
SmPC. 
Also, the following risks will be closely monitored and discussed in the PSURs: Changes in sex hormones 
and Bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase inhibition and associated AEs, as part of PSURs 
safety concerns.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Sustained  Hb  response  was  observed  with  long-term  treatment,  with  most  subjects  maintaining their 
response of increase in Hb (study 006) and transfusion reduction (study 007).  
Nevertheless, the available data do not provide sufficient evidence of a clear benefit of mitapivat on the 
clinical manifestation of the disease and iron overload in patients who are not regularly transfused.  
Although  study  AG348-C-007  had  a  single-arm  design,  patients  with  PK  deficiency  who  are  regularly 
transfused  do  not  spontaneously  become  transfusion  free  or  achieve  normal  Hb  concentrations 
independent  of  transfusions.  Being  transfusion  free  for  an  extended  period  with  sustained  treatment 
could decrease “transfusional” iron overload and may thus mitigate the limitations of a single-arm study 
and uncertainties related to the estimation of the primary endpoint (TRR rate). 
The  absence  of  efficacy  results  in  a  subset  of  patients  excluded  from  both  clinical  trials,  based  on 
mutations is a significant concern on study population representativeness. This is clearly reflected in the 
product information.  
The safety profile identified from the safety dataset is manageable. Most of AEs were non serious, no 
fatal AE was reported. Few discontinuations or dose modifications due to adverse events occurred under 
the MA regimen, this supporting the relevance of the dose titration used in pivotal studies.  
Acute haemolysis was an identified risk associated with mitapivat, mainly in case of sudden withdrawal 
of mitapivat. A dose taper was then successfully implemented. However, the safety impact of missed 
doses remains unknown. 
Moreover, mitapivat inhibits aromatase activity, which plays a key role in bone growth and maturation, 
and unbalances in sex hormones. Although no meaningful changes in bone mineral density have been 
observed in both gender, impact of mitapivat treatment on these subjects with fragile bones still cannot 
be ruled out.  
In addition, Nausea concerned at least 20% subjects from mitapivat groups of parent studies, which is 
still of concern.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical efficacy of mitapivat has been clearly shown in terms of Hb level, haemolysis parameters 
and transfusion need in TD and NTD patients (study 006 and study 007, respectively) even though the 
available data do not provide sufficient evidence of clear beneficial effect on symptoms and iron overload. 
The  absence  of  efficacy  results  in  a  subset  of  patients  excluded  from  both  clinical  trials  based  on 
mutations  is  a  significant  concern  in  terms  of  study  population  representativeness.  A  warning  and 
information related to genotype is added in the product information. 
Long-term outcomes are still unknown, and the applicant has committed to provide final results of the 
long-term  study  AG348-C-011;  an  ongoing,  global,  retrospective  and  prospective,  longitudinal 
observational study of paediatric and adult patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) as a 
post-approval measure via the relevant regulatory procedure. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  benefit/risk  balance  of  Pyrukynd  is  positive,  subject  to  the  conditions  stated  in  section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Pyrukynd is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Pyrukynd is indicated for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult 
patients. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/792328/2022  
Page 186/187 
 
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that mitapivat is to be qualified as 
a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised 
within the European Union.

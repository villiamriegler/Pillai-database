2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major European public health challenge, with a prevalence of 
0.4-3.5% in different EU member states. It is the most common single cause of liver transplantation in 
the Union. 
Hepatitis C virus has significant genetic (RNA sequence) variability and is classified on this basis into at 
least 6 genotypes. There is a significant geographical variation in the distribution of HCV genotypes. In 
North America and Europe, genotype 1 HCV infection predominates. In Asia, genotype 3 HCV infection is 
most prevalent followed by genotype 1 HCV infection. North Africa and the Middle East have high 
genotype 4 HCV infection prevalence. Genotype 5 HCV infection is primarily found in southern Africa while 
genotype 6 HCV infection is most prevalent in Southeast Asia. HCV genotype does not clearly impact the 
rate of disease progression. Treatment response, however, with available regimens, differs between 
genotypes.  
During the last few years there has been a transformation in the treatment of HCV infection with the 
development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting viral proteins essential to viral replication. 
Recently approved DAA-based treatment regimens are generally well tolerated and result in high 
sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks following completion of all treatment (SVR12) rates 
across most, but not all, patient populations. Patients with certain genotypes, notably genotype 3, remain 
hard to treat, in particular in combination with negative predictors of cure e.g. cirrhosis and pre-treatment 
resistance-associated variants. The only recommended IFN-free alternative for the treatment of 
genotype 2-infection includes RBV (all patients) and does not yield fully optimal results in those hardest 
to cure (with negative predictive factors including cirrhosis). 
There are currently limited recommended treatment options for patients with decompensated liver 
disease. In the EU, SOF+RBV is recommended across all HCV genotypes for the treatment of patients 
awaiting liver transplant with the treatment duration guided by the assessment of benefit – risk. Also in 
the EU, LDV/SOF+RBV and SOF + DVC + RBV are recommended regimens for the treatment of patients 
with genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection with decompensated cirrhosis who are either pre- or post-liver 
transplant. 
Despite the rapid development of new therapies, including interferon-free regimens, there remains an 
unmet medical need for certain groups of European patients with hepatitis C virus infection, in particular 
for those with genotype 2 and 3 and severe liver disease. 
Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that potently inhibits genotype 1 to 6 HCV RNA replicons in vitro and 
has demonstrated high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates when administered with RBV to subjects 
with chronic genotype 2 and 3 HCV infection and with pegylated interferon + ribavirin (PEG+RBV) to 
subjects with chronic genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 HCV infection. 
Velpatasvir  is  a  novel  HCV  nonstructural  protein  5A  (NS5A)  inhibitor  that  is  being  developed  in 
combination with sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals for the treatment of HCV infection. 
Due to the additive antiviral interaction and lack of cross-resistance observed in vitro between Sofosbuvir 
and  Velpatasvir,  the  administration  of  these  2  drugs  as  a  film-coated  tablet  is  expected  to  provide 
significant antiviral activity and a favourable resistance profile.  
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 9/112 
 
 
 
 
 
The medicinal product containing sofosbuvir and velpatasvir together as an oral fixed-dose combination in 
immediate-release film-coated tablet (400/100 mg) is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection in adults. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets containing 400 mg sofosbuvir and 100 mg 
velpatasvir as active substances in a fixed dose combination.  
Other ingredients are: 
For the tablet core: copovidone, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate. 
For the film coating: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, talc, iron oxide red. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant 
closure as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Sofosbuvir 
General information 
Sofosbuvir is the active substance of the already-authorised products Sovaldi and Harvoni. Information 
on its quality is essentially the same as in the Sovaldi and Harvoni dossiers.  
The chemical name of sofosbuvir is (S)-isopropyl 
2-((S)-(((2R,3R,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)-4-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-methyltetra
hydrofuran-2-yl)methoxy)-(phenoxy)phosphorylamino)propanoate corresponding to the molecular 
formula C22H29FN3O9P and has a relative molecular mass of 529 g/mol. It has the following structure: 
The structure of Sofosbuvir was unambiguously confirmed by 1H, 13C, 31P and 19F NMR, UV spectroscopy, 
IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
Sofosbuvir is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline solid, slightly soluble in water (pH 1.2-7.7), 
freely soluble in ethanol and acetone, soluble in 2-propanol, and insoluble in heptane. 
Sofosbuvir is chiral and possesses 6 stereogenic centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled in synthesis 
intermediates by chiral HPLC. Sofosbuvir exibits polymorphism. Eight polymorphic forms of sofosbuvir 
have been observed and the manufacturing process consistently produces sofosbuvir as the most 
thermodynamically stable polymorphic form that may contain a small amount of a metastable form that 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 10/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was determined to be pharmaceutically equivalent. Therefore it was considered acceptable not to control 
the presence of the metastable form in the active substance as per ICH Q6A (decision tree #4). Other 
polymorphic forms are excluded by the manufacturing process and their absence is confirmed by DSC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Sofosbuvir is synthesized in six synthetic steps using three well-defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. During the procedure the applicant also introduced an alternative manufacturing process 
in addition to the previous one to reduce chlorinated solvent use and improve process efficiency. The 
alternative process was approved for Solvadi and Harvoni products (procedures 
EMEA/H/C/002798/WS0904/0027/G and EMEA/H/C/003850/WS0904/0027/G, approval date 7 April 
2016). After recrystallisation, the active substance is then sieved or milled to afford material of a suitable 
particle size for formulation. GMP manufacturing for Sofosbuvir occurs at multiple manufacturers.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to 
ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set 
based on the manufacturing experience to date.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Sofosbuvir is packaged in double-lined polyethylene bags closed with plastic or wire ties. The bags are 
held in high-density polyethylene drums (or other suitable secondary container) with lids of appropriate 
size and fitted with a tamper-evident security seal. The polyethylene used complies with EC requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution, 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents and volatile organic impurities (GC), metals 
(ICP-OES), particle size (Ph. Eur.), and polymorphic form (DSC – Ph. Eur.).  
Rationale for the absence of tests for water content (non-hygroscopic) and microbiological testing (low 
water content and water activity, isolation from organic solvent) was considered justified. Residue on 
ignition testing is not suitable as the active substance contains phosphorous: this test is replaced with a 
combination of clarity of solution test and ICP for elemental impurities. The applicant committed to review 
the acceptance limits for two residual solvents when sufficient commercial scale data is obtained from 
batches manufactured at the recently approved manufacturing site and from batches manufactured using 
the alternative process. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 45 batches of the active substance ranging from laboratory through pilot to 
commercial scale, and used for development, stability, toxicology, clinical studies, and validation were 
provided. 3 of the 45 batches were manufactured according to the alternative manufacturing process. 
Assessment focussed primarily on later pilot commercial scale batches used for development, stability 
and validation. The results were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 11/112 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability data were provided on two pilot scale batches of active substance from two of the three proposed 
sources in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market. For those batches, 
stability data are on-going and results were provided for up to one month under accelerated conditions at 
40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The absence of stability data for the third active 
substance source was considered acceptable due to the fact that this manufacturer was approved for 
Sovaldi and Harvoni products (EMEA/H/C/002798/WS0841/0026/G and 
EMEA/H/C/003850/WS0841/0018/G approved in December 2015).  
Stability data were also provided for 6 batches of active substance from sources other than the ones 
proposed for this application. Results are available for 12 or 18 months under long term conditions at 25 
ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines. Those stability data were considered to be also representative for all the proposed active 
substance sources. 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Stressed studies were 
carried out on a single batch between -20 and 50 ºC for up to 4 weeks. Forced degradation was carried out 
under acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (10 mM Na2CO3) and oxidative (3% H2O2) conditions and at 105 ºC. 
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, impurity content, water content, and polymorphic form. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release, except for water content, measured by DVS, 
and were stability indicating. 
Sofosbuvir was shown to be stable under long-term, accelerated and stressed conditions and is not 
sensitive to light. Forced degradation revealed that the active substance may degrade via oxidation or 
hydrolysis in solution, but remains stable in the solid state even up to 105 ºC after 1 week. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed 24 months retest period in the proposed 
container. 
Velpatasvir 
General information 
The chemical name of velpatasvir is Methyl 
{(1R)-2-[(2S,4S)-2-(5-{2-[(2S,5S)-1-{(2S)-2-[(methoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-methylbutanoyl}-5-methy
lpyrrolidin-2-yl]-1,11-dihydro[2]benzopyrano[4',3':6,7]naphtho[1,2-d]imidazol-9-yl}-1H-imidazol-2-yl)
-4-(methoxymethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl}carbamate corresponding to the molecular 
formula C49H54N8O8. It has a relative molecular mass of 883.0 g/mol and the following structure: 
The structure of velpatasvir was unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, UV spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray crystallography. 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 12/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The active substance is a white to tan or yellow hygroscopic solid. Only one solid form is known to date. 
Velpatasvir belongs to Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class 4 (low solubility relative to 
dose and low permeability) and exhibits pH-dependent solubility; it is soluble at pH 1.2, sparingly soluble 
at pH 2 and practically insoluble at pH > 5.   
Velpatasvir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of six chiral centres and is produced as a single 
stereoisomer.  The stereoisomers are controlled either as specified impurities in velpatasvir or by the 
specifications of active substance intermediates or by process design. 
Velpatasvir is considered to be a new active substance. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized by two manufacturers in seven main steps using four well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Re-work and re-process procedures are described and are considered acceptable. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the velpatasvir active substance 
manufacturing process. The active substance critical quality attributes were identified.  
The preferred conditions for the manufacture of velpatasvir were selected through traditional univariate 
experimentation. Upon selection of the preferred conditions, additional studies were performed to 
establish proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for all important process parameters. These broad PARs 
support the more narrow normal operating ranges (NORs) used to describe the manufacturing process. 
The ranges included in manufacturing process description have been studied by univariate experiments. 
The applicant states that within the narrow ranges defined in the manufacturing description, at each 
velpatasvir manufacturer, individualised set points are selected to tailor the process to their specific 
equipment and that they do not constitute a design space. The applicant clarified that 
design-of-experiments (DoE) studies were used to increase the understanding of potential multivariable 
interactions in the process and not to establish a design space for velpatasvir manufacture. A risk 
assessment was conducted to identify critical process parameters (CPPs). Adequate in-process controls 
are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. Impurity genesis, fate and purge studies are described and support the 
specifications for the starting materials, intermediates and active substance velpatasvir. Potentially 
mutagenic impurities (PMIs) that may arise from the synthesis of velpatasvir and may be present in the 
active substance have been identified. Control strategies for these PMIs were established with 
understanding of fate and purge and associated process controls. These strategies assure that the levels 
of these PMIs in the active substance are controlled below 30% of the concentration limit calculated based 
on the threshold of toxicological concern. 
Velpatasvir is packaged in double polyethylene bags closed with plastic or wire ties; each double bag is 
contained in a polyethylene-lined aluminium foil pouch; the outer polyethylene-lined foil bag is heat 
sealed; the foil bags are placed in a high density polyethylene drum (or other suitable secondary

containment) fitted with a lid. The polyethylene used for the bags complies with the Ph. Eur. 
requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution, 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, UPLC), residual solvents and organic volatile impurities (GC), water 
content (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Residue on ignition (ROI) is not included as an active substance release test because the velpatasvir 
manufacturing process and the required clarity of solution test provide adequate control for insoluble 
impurities including inorganic impurities. The absence of ROI test was considered acceptable. 
In view of the content of elemental impurities observed, the absence of control of elemental impurities 
was considered acceptable. 
Active substance particle size is not critical for tablet processability, stability, content uniformity, 
dissolution or appearance taking into account the finished product manufacture. Therefore the absence of 
active substance particle size control was considered acceptable. 
Microbiological examination is not included in the specification for velpatasvir for the following 
reasons:  the relationship between water content and water activity of velpatasvir is well understood, the 
acceptance limit for water content in velpatasvir ensures microbiological growth is not supported, the 
active substance container closure system minimizes increase in water content over time, and data are 
available to show low bioburden of the active substance at release and on stability. The absence of 
microbiological control was considered acceptable. 
The absence of control of PMIs was considered acceptable in view of the control strategy implemented by 
the active substance manufacturer. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data are provided for 22 batches of velpatasvir ranging from laboratory through pilot to 
production scale used for non-clinical, clinical and stability studies. All studies have been conducted with 
the same form of the active substance. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data were provided on seven batches of active substance stored in a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market for up to twelve months under long term conditions at 30 
ºC / 75% RH and for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines. The sizes of the stability batches were from pilot to production scale and the batches were 
from the proposed manufacturers. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurity content, and water content at each 
scheduled time point. Microbiological examination is conducted at the initial and annual time points for 
samples stored at the long-term storage condition in accordance with USP <61> and <62> or Ph. Eur.

2.6.12. Currently the analytical methods used are the same as for release and for stability studies and are 
stability indicative. However over the course of clinical development, improvements were made to the 
analytical methods used to monitor critical quality attributes and stability of the drug substance. A 
bridging study was conducted by analysing three batches of velpatasvir using the test parameters of the 
clinical method and the intended commercial method. It has been demonstrated that data obtained using 
the clinical methods are valid and comparable to data obtained using the intended commercial method. 
No significant changes were observed in any of the monitored parameters through the 12 months of 
storage at long term conditions and 6 months of storage conditions at accelerated conditions compared to 
the initial values. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results showed that 
velpatasvir is photolabile. Results on stress conditions (-20°C during four weeks and 50°C/ambient 
conditions during two weeks) were also provided on one batch. Data confirmed that velpatasvir will 
remain stable at both extreme temperatures. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a an immediate-release fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing 400 mg 
sofosbuvir (SOF) and 100 mg velpatasvir (VEL). 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except for the film coating material, Opadry II Pink tested according to an in house standard 
and except for the colorant iron oxide red contained in opadry II pink that complies with EU Regulation 
231/2012 standard. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The compatibility of velpatasvir or sofosbuvir with typical formulation excipients was demonstrated as 
well as the compatibility of velpatasvir with sofosbuvir.  
Velpatasvir is a BCS Class 4 compound with pH-dependent solubility in the physiological pH range. As 
such, food and gastrointestinal pH may influence its dissolution properties and biopharmaceutical 
performance. Approaches to formulation of velpatasvir were thus focused on maximising dissolution and 
mitigating potential food and gastrointestinal pH effects while maintaining velpatasvir chemical and 
physical stability. 
Three formulation and manufacturing process approaches were selected based on prior experience and 
expert knowledge, and evaluated for incorporating velpatasvir in single-agent tablets. The formulation 
and manufacturing process were selected based on the results of studies performed to compare the 
dissolution properties, in vivo pharmacokinetic performance and chemical stability of the different 
formulation and manufacturing process approaches. 
A VEL single-agent tablet formulation was developed to support Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.  All 
clinical studies have used amorphous velpatasvir free base and the same solid form of velpatasvir and 
finished product intermediate formulation. The solid form of velpatasvir remains unchanged in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 15/112 
 
 
 
 
 
finished product intermediate. Velpatasvir remains amorphous in the finished product intermediate with 
no known ability to crystallise. A film coating material was used to inhibit photodegradation. 
A fixed-dose combination tablet (SOF/VEL tablet) was developed prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Sofosbuvir is a BCS Class 3 compound with low apparent permeability and high solubility. A precedent for 
the formulation of sofosbuvir in an immediate release solid oral dosage form has been established 
through its use in commercial products, including Sovaldi and Harvoni. 
SOF/VEL FDC tablets of 400/100 mg strength and 400/25 mg were developed.  Opadry II Pink was used 
as film coating material. SOF/VEL FDC tablets of 400/100 mg strength and 400/25 mg strength 
demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic performance to the respective co administered single-agent 
tablets in relative bioavailability (BA) study, with no need for dose adjustment. The selection of the 100 
mg dose for velpatasvir was supported by Phase 2 efficacy studies. The 400/100 mg strength SOF/VEL 
tablet formulation was used in all Phase 3 clinical trials and is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The quantitative composition of the 400/100 mg strength batch used for relative bioavailability study and 
the batch used in the Phase 3 clinical study is identical. The in vitro dissolution profile comparisons 
provided demonstrated that the 400/100 mg strength batch used for relative bioavailability study 
exhibited comparable sofosbuvir and velpatasvir dissolution performance to representative batches of 
Sovaldi (400 mg strength) and VEL single-agent tablets (100 mg strength). 
The in vitro dissolution profile comparisons provided also demonstrated that primary stability batches and 
all clinical batches of SOF/VEL 400/100 mg tablets showed comparable dissolution profiles to that 
observed for the 400/100 mg strength batch used for relative bioavailability study. 
A detailed discussion of the dissolution method development has been provided. The dissolution method 
was considered acceptable. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The physical stability, chemical stability, and/or dissolution properties of the finished product 
intermediate were evaluated. The results justified the limits selected for the specifications or the 
in-process control. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product manufacturing 
process. The finished product critical quality attributes have been identified.  
An initial risk assessment was conducted based on expert knowledge and VEL single-agent tablet and 
SOF/VEL tablet process. The results of this initial risk assessment supported the evaluation of certain unit 
operations and process parameters in development studies to define the control strategy for the 
commercial manufacturing process. The applicant has presented an enhanced approach (QbD) 
development of the manufacturing process and as a result proposed both a target and normal operating 
ranges in the manufacturing process description.  The applicant stated that no design space is claimed 
and committed to run the process at the target parameters. The applicant intends to operate within the 
NORs proposed for all unit operations. This approach was endorsed. It is expected that movement outside 
of the proposed normal operating ranges will be considered a change to the manufacturing process and 
would initiate a quality investigation and potentially regulatory post approval change process. 
The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle with a polypropylene child resistant closure. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the finished product intermediate is performed by two manufacturers and 
consists of four main steps: feed solution preparation, drying, secondary drying, and packaging. The 
manufacturing process of the finished product is performed by two manufacturers and consists of four 
main steps: powder processing (dispensing, blending, dry granulation), tablet compression, film coating 
and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Holding times and finished product intermediate shelf-life were justified. The process will be validated 
prior to commercial distribution of SOF/VEL tablets on a minimum of three consecutive production scale 
batches according to the process validation scheme provided. This was considered acceptable. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay of each active substance (HPLC), 
sofosbuvir degradation product content (HPLC), velpatasvir degradation product content (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 13 batches using all proposed active substance sources and all 
proposed manufacturers. Batch analysis results confirmed the consistency of the manufacturing process 
and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for six pilot scale batches of finished product from both manufacturers stored 
under long term conditions for up to eighteen months at 25 ºC / 60% RH or 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up 
to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The 
batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation product content, dissolution, water content. 
Microbiological examination is performed annually on samples stored at 30 °C/75% RH. The analytical 
procedures used are the same as the one used at release and are stability indicating. 
In addition, one pilot batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. Stability studies were also conducted at -20 °C and 60 °C/ambient 
humidity for 4 days on one pilot batch. 
No significant changes observed in any quality attribute for up to eighteen months at the long-term and 
six months at accelerated storage conditions. Photostability results demonstrated that the finished 
product is not sensitive to light. No significant change was observed stability studies conducted at -20 °C 
and 60 °C/ambient humidity for 4 days. 
Supportive stability data were also provided for five laboratory scale finished product batches 
manufactured with finished product intermediate stored in bulk from five to sixteen month prior tablet 
manufacturing. The batches were stored for up to 24 month at 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH and 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 17/112 
 
 
 
 
 
for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH. Based on the stability data available including the 6 month stability 
data at 25 ºC / 60% RH, 30 ºC / 75% RH and 40 ºC / 75% RH provided for the laboratory scale finished 
product batch manufactured with finished product intermediate stored in bulk for 16 months prior to 
tablet manufacturing, the applicant proposal to define the start of shelf life for the finished product as the 
date when finished product intermediate and sofosbuvir are combined with excipients was accepted. The 
holding time of sixteen months for finished product intermediate was accepted as well.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed finished product shelf-life of 24 months without any 
storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate used to 
manufacture SOF/VEL tablets is obtained exclusively from vegetable sources. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of 
velpatasvir active substance and in the development of the finished product and their manufacturing 
processes. However, design spaces were not claimed for either. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue related to the limits for two 
residual solvents in the sofosbuvir active substance specifications having no impact on the Benefit/Risk 
ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
- 
to review the acceptance limits for two residual solvents in the sofosbuvir active substance 
specifications when sufficient commercial scale data is obtained from batches manufactured at a 
recently approved manufacturing site and from batches manufactured using the alternative 
process.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
SOF/VEL is a fixed combination of sofosbuvir (approved NS5B polymerase inhibitor) and velpatasvir, a 
new NS5A-inhibitor. HCV NS5A is a multifunctional protein with key functions in HCV replication, virus 
assembly, and the modulation of cellular signaling pathways (Sheel and Rice, Nature Medicine, 2013). 
Sofosbuvir is a HCV nonstructural protein (NS)5B polymerase nucleotide inhibitor that demonstrates 
potent in vitro inhibition of HCV replicon ribonucleic acid (RNA) replication. Sofosbuvir has been approved 
for use once daily for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug 
of 2’-deoxy-2’-fluoro-2’-C-methyluridine monophosphate that is converted to the active uridine analogue 
triphosphate form (GS 461203) within the hepatocyte. GS-461203 is incorporated by the HCV NS5B 
polymerase during HCV RNA replication, and acts to inhibit RNA replication via chain termination. SOF 
exhibits broad genotypic coverage in genotypes 1 to 6 replicon assays. 
Velpatasvir is a HCV NS5A inhibitor that has displayed potent in vitro inhibition of HCV RNA replication 
across genotypes 1 to 6 in replicon cell lines. The non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) protein of HCV is an 
essential viral protein that plays roles in both viral RNA replication and the assembly of HCV virions. 
Experimental data support the conclusion that VEL targets NS5A as its mode of action. 
The combination of SOF and VEL is suggested to exhibit an additive antiviral activity and not to obtain any 
cross resistance.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Sofosbuvir is a HCV NS5B polymerase nucleotide inhibitor that displays potent inhibition of HCV RNA 
replication in vitro. In human hepatocytes, SOF is converted to an active uridine triphosphate form 
(GS-461203) that has been shown to directly inhibit NS5B polymerase activity in a biochemical assay, at 
IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 2.6 µM. Sofosbuvir demonstrates activity against stable genotypes 1a, 
1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a HCV replicons at EC50 values of 0.014 to 0.11 µM (PC-PSI-7977-09-0006, 
PC-PSI-7977-09-0012, and PC-334-2005).  
In vitro resistance selection experiments demonstrated that the NS5B S282T mutation was the primary 
SOF in vitro resistance mutation (PC-334-2006, PC-334-2010, and PC-PSI-7977-09-0008). 
Velpatasvir (GS-5816) inhibits HCV replication by interfering with the HCV NS5A protein. The enzymatic 
function of NS5A has no known, therefore, it is not possible biochemically confirm NS5A inhibition by VEL.  
Hepatitis C virus replicon studies have shown that VEL has antiviral activity against HCV genotypes 1 to 
6 with mean EC50 values ranging from 0.002 to 0.13 nM (PC-281-2024). No cytotoxicity was observed at 
the highest concentrations tested (concentration that results in 50% cytotoxicity > 44,444 nM).  
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 20/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean EC50 value of VEL against chimeric replicons encoding NS5A sequences from clinical isolates 
was 0.029 nM for genotype 1 (range [Min, Max]: 0.005, 0.5 nM; N = 57), 0.027 nM for genotype 2 (range: 
0.0003, 0.36 nM; N = 37), 14.8 nM for genotype 3 (range: 0.002, 319.1 nM; N = 40), 0.005 nM for 
genotype 4 (range: 0.001, 0.014 nM; N = 31); 0.007 nM for genotype 5 (range: 0.001, 0.019 nM; N = 
35); and 0.11 nM for genotype 6 (range: 0.0005, 2.6 nM; N = 49). 
In vitro resistance selection experiments demonstrated that depending of genotype (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, 
5a, and 6a) several NS5A mutations significantly increase VEL resistance (PC-281-2027). Phenotypic 
analysis of a broad panel of NS5A resistance-associated substitutions in HCV genotype 1 to 6 replicons 
demonstrated that VEL high potency against a wide range of NS5A RAVs and has an improved resistance 
barrier compared with first generation NS5A inhibitors (PC-281-2013, PC-281-2023, and PC-281-2030). 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir: In vitro, the combination of SOF and VEL exhibited additive antiviral activity. No 
antiviral antagonism was observed, and no significant change in cell viability was observed in combination 
studies of SOF and VEL (PC-334-2014). In vitro studies demonstrated no cross-resistance between SOF 
and VEL when tested individually against HCV mutations resistant to other classes of HCV inhibitors. The 
NS5B S282T mutant replicon, which conferred low-level reduced susceptibility to SOF, was susceptible to 
VEL (Table 1). Similarly, SOF was fully active against a panel of NS5A mutants that showed a reduced 
susceptibility to VEL. Furthermore, double-class mutants (NS5B S282T + NS5A resistance-associated 
variants [RAVs]) displayed a significant reduced replication capacity compared to wild type or single NS5A 
RAVs in the replicon.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Sofosbuvir 
In Vitro Cytotoxicity 
The cytotoxicity of SOF was evaluated in multiple cell lines. In 2 human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, Huh-7 
and HepG2, the SOF concentration that resulted in 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) was 95.9 µM and 90.6 µM, 
respectively. In human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (BxPC3), 2 human T cell leukemia cell lines (CEM 
and MT4), and human metastatic prostate carcinoma cells (PC-3), the CC50 values were greater than the 
respective highest concentration of SOF tested (89–200 µM) (PC-PSI-7977-09-0004 and PC-334-2005). 
In studies using GS-9851 (the diasteromer mixture of SOF and GS-491241), the CC50 values for 
GS-9851 were > 50 μM (the highest concentration tested) in human erythroid and myeloid bone marrow 
progenitor cells (PC-PSI-7851-08-0022). 
Mitochondrial Toxicity 
Sofosbuvir showed no mitochondrial toxicity in cell-based assays measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
depletion or selective cytochrome c oxidase protein depletion. Sofosbuvir did not alter mtDNA levels at 
concentrations of 50 μM and 100 μM in HepG2 and CEM cells, respectively (PC-334-2012, 
PC-PSI-7977-09-0007). The mitochondrial biogenesis studies demonstrated that SOF had no effect on

cytochrome c oxidase expression in PC-3 cells at the highest concentration tested (100 μM) 
(PC-334-2015). Similarly, GS-9851 showed no inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase expression at 100 μM 
in both HepG2 and PC-3 cell lines (PC-334-2015). The IC50 value for the active metabolite GS-461203, 
when tested against the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, was 
greater than the highest concentrations evaluated (200 μM and 500 μM, respectively) (PC-334-2013, 
PC-PSI-7851-09-0015).  
Activity Against Host Polymerases 
The GS-461203, was tested in vitro for activity against host DNA and RNA polymerases. The IC50 was 
greater than the highest concentration tested (200 μM) against human DNA polymerases alpha and beta 
(PC-334-2013, PC-PSI-7851-08-0029). The IC50 values were also greater than the highest concentration 
tested (200 μM) against the human RNA polymerase II (PC-334-2013, PC-PSI-7851-09-0015). 
In Vitro Receptor Binding Potencies 
The effects of GS-9851 and the major metabolite GS-331007 were evaluated to determine the potential 
for off-target activity against a panel of receptors, enzymes, and ion channels. At 10 µM, GS-9851 and 
GS-331007 did not show greater than 50% inhibition or induction of any target (PC-PSI-7851-09-0004, 
PC-334-2026). 
Velpatasvir 
Activity against other viruses 
The pharmacologic activity of VEL against other viruses is described in detail in the clinical part of this 
submission. Briefly, VEL was tested for antiviral activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), RSV, 
HBV, HIV-1, HRV, influenza A and B, and a panel of flaviviruses (including West Nile virus, yellow fever 
virus, dengue virus, and banzai virus). In contrast to its antiviral activity against HCV, VEL is reported to 
show no selective antiviral activity against BVDV (a related flavivirus) or against any of the other viruses 
tested at the highest concentration tested or the highest concentration without cytotoxicity. 
In Vitro Cytotoxicity 
The in vitro cytotoxicity of VEL was evaluated in 2 hepatic cell lines Huh-7 and HepG2, the prostate 
carcinoma cell line PC-3, the T-lymphoblastoid cell line MT-4, and normal lung-derived MRC-5 cells. 
Following 5 days of continuous compound exposure, CC50 values for VEL were > 44,444 nM in 4 of the 5 
cell lines tested, and 4028 nM in PC-3 cells. These values conferred a selectivity index of 270,000 to > 
3,000,000 for genotype 1 HCV and VEL is thus concluded to show low cellular cytotoxicity. 
In Vitro Receptor Binding Potencies 
The effects of VEL on a standard panel of receptors, enzymes, and ion channels were evaluated to 
determine the potential for off-target activity. At 10 μM VEL (dispensed from a 10 mM stock solution in 
DMSO), there were no significant responses on any target and only a weak to moderate effect (between 
25-50%) indicated in the melatonin receptor MT1 ((ML1A) (h) agonist radioligand assay; using [125I]2- 
iodomelatonin) with a 38% inhibition of binding at 10µM. 
SOF/VEL 
In Vitro Cytotoxicity 
No significant cell cytotoxicity was observed with either SOF or VEL as individual agents. In vitro studies 
of the combination SOF and VEL were performed in genotype 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a replicon cell lines. 
Cytotoxicity was quantified by cell viability at a SOF top concentration of 320 nM in combination with VEL 
Assessment report

at a top concentration of 0.064 nM. No significant change in cell viability was observed. In addition, SOF 
is unlikely to produce adverse effects related to the inhibition of human RNA and DNA polymerases, and 
there is no indication of mitochondrial toxicity associated with SOF. In conclusion, based on the low 
potential for off-target activity by SOF and VEL, no additional pharmacodynamics studies are considered 
necessary with the SOF/VEL combination. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The nonclinical safety pharmacology profiles of SOF (dosed as GS-9851) and VEL were independently 
characterized. Study designs and parameters evaluated are consistent with accepted principles and 
practices as outlined in the ICH S7A Guideline (Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human 
Pharmaceuticals). All studies were conducted in accordance with GLP regulations.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles of SOF and VEL have been evaluated in 
nonclinical studies in human extracts and cells in vitro as well as in in vivo studies in animals. Nonclinical 
evaluation of the PK of SOF/VEL is primarily based on studies conducted with the individual agents. 
Methods of analysis 
Sofosbuvir, Velpatasvir  
The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) methods were used to examine SOF, VEL and their metabolites in culture media, plasma, bile 
and urine samples during PK studies. These methods did not strictly conform to GLP guidelines but were 
evaluated for appropriate selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, as well as intra-assay accuracy and precision. 
All bioanalytical methods for toxicokinetic analyses supporting the GLP safety studies with SOF and VEL 
were validated. The LC-MS/MS method was used to determine the PK parameters in the toxicokinetics 
studies. Validation parameters included selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, recovery, carryover, intra- and 
inter-assay precision and accuracy, sample collection stability, stock solution stability, injection medium 
integrity, short-term matrix stability, freeze-thaw matrix stability, long-term matrix stability, and dilution 
integrity, re-injection reproducibility. 
Following radiochemicals were used: [3H]GS-9851, [14C]SOF, [14C]VEL. The [3H] and [14C]-derived 
radioactivities in biological samples, including cell culture media, blood, plasma, excised tissues, excreta, 
and effluent from the HPLC, were determined by liquid scintillation counting.  
TRIzol was used to isolate RNA, which was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) to assess the effect of SOF and VEL on CYPs mRNA levels. 
Velpatasvir 
Analysis of VEL in plasma, bile, and urine samples from PK studies in CD-1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats, 
New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkey utilized methods based on 
LC/MS/MS that were not fully validated under the conditions of GLP. These methods were evaluated for 
appropriate selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, as well as intra assay accuracy and precision.

Reproducibility 
The results of incurred sample reproducibility analyses that were conducted during the rat and dog 
toxicology studies confirmed the repeatability of the methods. Only one (23.5%) of thirty-six reanalysed 
samples from rats (TX-281-2003) and nine (30.6, 25.2, 26.3, 30.4, 23.3, 24.6, 31.6, 40.5, 20.4 %) of 
fifty-three samples from dogs (TX-281-2004) showed a difference >20%. Thus 97% of samples in the rat 
study and 83% from the study in dogs where within 20.0% of each other and met the acceptance criteria: 
“The incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) analysis was considered acceptable if at least two-thirds 
(rounded up) of the repeat results and original results were within 20.0% of each other.” 
Absorption 
Sofosbuvir 
In vitro absorption studies 
Sofosbuvir was stable when incubated in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (PC-PSI-7851-08-0012, 
PC-PSI-7977-09-0003). Sofosbuvir showed partially saturable efflux transport with low forward 
permeability that increased with concentration when incubated at different concentrations with Caco-2 
cell monolayers (AD-334-2003). 
Single and multiple dose in vivo studies 
In rodents, administration of GS-9851 resulted in the rapid appearance of GS-331007 in plasma and liver. 
GS-9851 was not detected in mice or rats immediately following administration (as early as 15 minutes), 
suggesting rapid conversion to GS-331007 by plasma esterase. 
The pharmacologically active metabolite, GS-461203, was efficiently formed in rat liver but was not 
detected in mice administered lower doses (PC-PSI-7851-08-0017, PC-PSI-7851-08-0019). GS-461203 
was detected in livers of mice in the micronucleus study following oral administration at higher doses 
(SA-PSI-7851-08-0005). In dogs, SOF was well absorbed (Fa = 39.7%) and highly extracted by the liver 
(74% of the absorbed dose), resulting in high (Cmax = 47.5 µM following administration at 5 mg/kg) and 
persistent (t1/2 = 17.8 h) liver levels of GS-461203 (AD-334-2011, AD-334-2012).

The toxicokinetic profiles of SOF, GS-9851, and select metabolites were examined in plasma following 
oral administration to mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs in toxicology studies. The Cmax and AUC of monitored 
compounds generally increased proportionally with dose. No marked sex differences in exposure were 
observed (typically < 2-fold) and no evidence for accumulation was observed following repeat dosing.  
The plasma and liver PK of select metabolites were studied after 4 days of once daily administration of 
GS-9851 to a single dog or monkey. The predominant metabolites GS-331007 and GS-566500 were 
observed in the livers of both species. The pharmacologically active triphosphate, GS-461203, was 
efficiently formed in dog liver but was not detected in the monkey (PC-PSI-7851-08-0018). 
Velpatasvir 
In vivo absorption of VEL has been assessed in mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, NZW rabbits, beagle dogs, 
and Cynomolgus monkeys following intravenous and oral administration. In vitro permeability studies 
have been carried out in Caco-2 cell monolayers. However, according to the applicant permeability values 
of VEL could not be reliably obtained due to low recovery of the compound and poor reproducibility (no 
data shown). 
Systemic clearance (CL) of VEL was low in all species tested and was less than 30% of hepatic blood flow. 
Velpatasvir was well distributed, with Vss values ranging from 1.4 to 1.6 L/kg.

Formulation Development 
Velpatasvir has low intrinsic (unionized) aqueous solubility (approximately 3 µg/mL at pH 8.2), and its low 
solubility limited the exposure that could be obtained during toxicology studies. Less than proportional 
increases in exposure were observed following oral administration in organic solution or aqueous 
suspension at higher doses in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. In order to optimize the formulation for 
toxicology studies the PK of VEL, following oral administration in various formulations, was assessed in 
rats and rabbits (AD-281-2020, AD-281-2035, and AD-281-2036).  
In rat the formulations included: A) solution of 15% Solutol-HS-15, 45% propylene glycol, and 40% 
water, pH adjusted to 2.0 with HCl; B) suspension of 0.2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 0.2% Tween 
20, and 0.9% benzyl alcohol in water; and C) solution of 100% Capmul MCM, NF. The plasma exposure 
to VEL was slightly higher when dosed with formulation A compared with the other 2 formulations and this 
formulation was selected for subsequent toxicology studies. 
In female NZW rabbits the formulations evaluated included: A) solution of 100% oleic acid; B) solution of 
60% propylene glycol and 40% Solutol HS-15; and C) suspension of 0.5% hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 98.5% water. The plasma exposure to VEL in 
rabbits was the highest when dosed as an aqueous suspension (Formulation C), and this formulation was 
selected for subsequent toxicology studies. In addition, the highest exposure to VEL obtained when single 
ascending oral doses of VEL were administered to female NZW rabbits in a solution of 25% Solutol HS-15 
and 75% propylene glycol (AD-281-2036) was shown to be comparable to that achieved in the aqueous 
suspension (Formulation C). 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
The effect of VEL on the bidirectional permeability of SOF was assessed in vitro using Caco 2 cell 
monolayers (AD-334-2002). The apical to basolateral (forward) permeability of SOF (incubated at 10 µM) 
was increased from 0.25 × 10-6 cm/s to 0.66 × 10-6 cm/s and the basolateral to apical (reverse) 
permeability decreased from 10.9 × 10-6 cm/s to 7.39 × 10-6 cm/s, which resulted in a decreased efflux 
ratio of SOF from 43.6 to 11.2 in the presence of 1 µM VEL.

Distribution 
Protein Binding  
Sofosbuvir 
Protein binding of SOF was low (< 70%) and concentration independent in dog and human plasma. 
Sofosbuvir was not stable in mouse, rat, and rabbit plasma, and plasma binding in those matrices was not 
determined. Protein binding of GS 331007 was minimal in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma (< 
10%, PC PSI 7977 11 0001). 
Velpatasvir 
Plasma protein binding of VEL was determined for CD-1 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, Rhesus 
monkeys, Cynomolgus monkeys, and humans in vitro by equilibrium dialysis at a VEL concentration of 2 
µM in plasma (AD-281-2037 and AD-281-2001). The protein binding of VEL in human plasma was also 
determined in vitro by equilibrium dialysis at different VEL plasma concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 
2 µM (AD-281-2029). Velpatasvir was highly protein bound in plasma from all species (> 99.5% bound) 
(Table 5). There was no notable change in VEL protein binding from 0.1 to 2 µM VEL in human plasma 
(Cmax observed in the clinic: 259 ng/mL, or 0.293 µM).

Tissue Distribution 
Sofosbuvir 
After oral administration of [14C]SOF to pigmented and non-pigmented rats, drug-related material was 
rapidly absorbed and widely distributed to tissues (SA-PSI-7977-09-0005). The highest concentrations of 
radioactivity in tissues were found in the alimentary canal, lymphatic system, and excretory system. The 
lowest concentrations of total radioactivity were observed in the CNS, bone, eye lens, and white adipose. 
Elimination of radioactivity from tissues was nearly complete at the last time point (144 or 168 hours post 
dose), with most tissue concentrations decreasing to below limit of quantification by 48 hours post dose. 
There was no evidence for a specific association of SOF or its metabolites with melanin in rats. 
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir is well distributed with a volume of distribution from 1.4 to 1.6 L/kg in the rat, dog, and 
monkey (AD-281-2002, AD-281-2003, AD-281-2004).  
After oral administration of [14C]VEL to mice and to pigmented and non-pigmented rats, drug-related 
material was quickly distributed to most tissues, especially the liver (AD-281-2021 and AD-281-2018). 
Although VEL likely binds to melanin, it is quickly removed from pigmented skin. Low levels of 
radioactivity were transiently detected in mouse brain and in mouse and rat testes, suggesting that 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 29/112 
 
 
 
 
 
[14C]VEL-derived radioactivity poorly crossed the blood:brain barrier in mice and the blood:testis barrier 
in mice and rats, which is consistent with VEL being a substrate of efflux transporters. 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
No nonclinical distribution studies have been done with the combination of SOF and VEL.  
Distribution in Pregnant or Nursing Animals 
Sofosbuvir 
[14C]Sofosbuvir-derived radioactivity was absorbed and widely distributed to tissues of pregnant, 
nonpregnant, and postpartum female rats after a single oral dose (SA-PSI-7977-11-0008). Drug-derived 
radioactivity was inefficiently transferred through the placenta and was found in amniotic fluid and 
absorbed into fetuses. Low levels of drug-derived radioactivity were quantifiable in the milk collected from 
postpartum females. Relatively low amounts of drug-derived radioactivity were transferred into nursing 
pups. Tissue distribution in the nursing pups was limited with detectable levels in the liver and GI contents 
only (SA-PSI-7977-11-0008).

[14C]Velpatasvir-derived radioactivity was absorbed and widely distributed to maternal tissues after a 
single oral dose of [14C]VEL to pregnant rats on Gestation Day 13 or 18 (AD-281-2031). [14C]VEL-derived 
radioactivity did not cross the placenta, and no radioactivity was detected in fetal blood or whole fetuses. 
Toxicokinetic parameters for VEL were determined in pregnant mice (TX-281-2032), rats (TX-281-2009, 
TX-281-2013), and rabbits (TX-281-2010, TX-281-2014). Exposure in pregnant animals was generally 
similar to that in non-pregnant animals. 
The plasma exposure of VEL was detected in neonates and increased greater than proportionally with the 
increase in the maternal dose level (TX-281-2027). Maternal plasma exposure (AUC) to VEL was > 
20-fold higher than in pups.  
Metabolism 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug and requires activation in hepatocytes to form the pharmacologically 
active triphosphate metabolite, GS 461203. GS-7977 was efficiently metabolized to its active 
triphosphate analogue metabolite, GS-461203, in primary hepatocytes from human following a 2-hour 
pulse incubation and there was no apparent gender difference in maximal triphosphate formed 
(AD-334-2017). The first step in the intracellular activation of SOF is the hydrolytic cleavage of the 
isopropyl ester by estareses such as cathepsin A (CatA) and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), but was not 
cleaved by CES2. Ester hydrolysis results in the release of isopropanol and a metastable intermediate that 
chemically degrades to release phenol and the intermediate metabolite GS 566500. Subsequent cleavage 
of the phosphoramidate linkage catalyzed by the histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (HINT1) 
results in release of the endogenous amino acid alanine and GS 606965 (AD-334-2018). Two sequential 
phosphorylation steps, catalyzed by the nucleotide kinases uridine monophosphate-cytidine 
monophosphate (UMP-CMP) kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), result in formation of the 
pharmacologically active triphosphate metabolite GS 461203 (AD-334-2019).

Figure 1: Intracellular metabolic pathways of GS 9851, GS 491241, and Sofosbuvir 
SOF is stable in plasma from non-rodent species and highly unstable in hepatic subcellular fractions. The 
presence of high plasma esterase activity in some rodent species results in rapid metabolism in mouse 
and rat plasma and blood. Isomeric conversion between SOF and GS 491241 was not detected in rat, dog, 
and human plasma and human urine. The primary route of intracellular SOF metabolism is hydrolytic 
cleavage of the isopropyl ester by CatA and CES1. Pathways involving CYP isozymes, flavin containing 
monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes, or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are not likely 
to be important considerations in the disposition of SOF based on studies completed with SOF and its 
metabolites, GS 566500, GS 606965, and GS 331007 in human liver microsomes incubated under 
different conditions. GS-7977 and GS-331007 were not substrates for recombinant CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 (AD-334-2015).

Figure 2: Proposed biotransformation pathways of Sofosbuvir 
Velpatasvir 
The rate of in vitro metabolism of VEL was low in mouse, monkey and human hepatic microsomes 
(predicted hepatic Cl <0.17 – 0.98 L/h/kg). Similarly, its metabolic turnover rate was low and could not 
be determined in cryopreserved human hepatocytes. There was no significant metabolic turnover of VEL 
by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 and slow metabolic turnover of VEL by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and 
CYP3A4 was observed.

Unchanged VEL was the most abundant circulating component. Of the total radioactivity exposure in 
plasma, unchanged VEL accounted for approximately 71% in CD-1 mice, 92% in rasH2 mice, 83% in rats, 
81% in dogs, and approximately 98.9% in human subjects. The O-demethyl-metabolite, desmethyl-VEL 
(M19), was identified in the plasma of all species, accounting for 7.1%, 8.3%, 12.4%, and 0.7% of the 
total radioactivity exposure in plasma in CD-1 mice, rats, dogs, and human subjects, respectively. The 
monohydroxylated metabolite, hydroxyl-VEL-1 (M18), was identified in rat, dog, and human plasma, 
accounting for 1.2%, 3.1%, and 0.4% of the total radioactivity exposure in plasma in these species, 
respectively. The monohydroxylated metabolite, hydroxyl-VEL-3 (M23), and the

Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
The effect of VEL on the formation of GS 461203 in primary human hepatocytes after incubation with SOF 
was assessed in vitro (AD 334 2010). When 10 µM SOF was incubated with hepatocytes for 2 hours, in the 
absence or presence of 10 µM VEL, the GS 461203 concentrations were 69.8 and 49.5 pmol/million cells, 
respectively. These results suggest that VEL does not markedly affect the intracellular activation of SOF.

Excretion 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is excreted in urine with urinary recovery of administered radiolabeled material accounting for 
65.6%, 72%, and 81%, in mice, rats and dogs, respectively. In bile duct cannulated rats, 6% of the dose 
was eliminated in bile. 
Velpatasvir 
Most of the [14C]VEL-derived radioactivity was rapidly excreted after oral administration in all 3 species 
investigated. By 168 hours after oral administration, a mean of 95.9%, 96.9%, and 93.6% of the 
administered radioactivity was excreted in feces from CD-1 mice, rats, and dogs, respectively. Less than 
0.27% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine from these animals.  
In BDC rats, a mean of 83.1%, 13.7%, and 0.248% of the administered radioactivity dose was excreted 
in feces, bile, and urine, respectively. In BDC dogs, a mean of 71.2%, 18.7%, and 0.245% of the 
administered radioactivity was excreted in feces, bile, and urine, respectively. The mean overall recovery 
of radioactivity after oral dosing, was 96.5% in CD-1 mice, 97.1% in both bile duct-intact and BDC rats, 
94.9% in bile duct-intact dogs, and 91.1% in BDC dogs. 
The biliary and urinary excretion of VEL was also examined in BDC Sprague-Dawley rats following a single 
30-minute intravenous infusion at 2 mg/kg (AD-281-2005). An average of 16% of the total dose was 
recovered as unchanged parent drug in rat bile. Only a trace amount of VEL was detected in rat urine. 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
No nonclinical excretion studies have been done with the combination of SOF and VEL. 
Excretion into Breast Milk 
Sofosbuvir 
Excretion of SOF in breast milk was studied in postpartum female rats after a single oral dose 
(SA-PSI-7977-11-0008). Low levels of drug-derived radioactivity were quantifiable in the milk. The 
nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 was the predominant metabolite observed in the milk at a milk:plasma 
concentration ratio of 0.1 at 1 hour post dose. 
Velpatasvir 
After oral dosing of [14C]VEL to lactating rats, [14C]VEL-derived radioactivity was transferred into milk 
with a Tmax of 4 hours and was not detectable by 24 hours post dose (AD-281-2031). The mean 
milk:plasma exposure (AUC) ratio was 1.74. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Sofosbuvir 
Cytochrome P450 and UGT1A1 Inhibition 
Sofosbuvir did not inhibit the activity of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 in vitro (IC50 > 100 µM).  
GS-331007 did not inhibit any of the CYP enzymes tested (IC50 > 300 µM). No evidence for 
mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A by SOF was observed (PC-PSI-7977-09-0011, AD-334-2020).  
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 34/112 
 
 
 
 
 
No inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2C8, 2D6, and 3A4 was observed by other SOF metabolites 
GS-607596, GS-606965, GS-566500, and GS-461203 at concentrations up to 100 µM 
(PC-PSI-7851-09-0009). 
Sofosbuvir showed weak dose dependent inhibition (IC50 = 198 µM) of human UGT1A1 while no inhibition 
was observed by GS-331007 and GS-606965 (IC50 > 300 µM; AD-334-2022). 
Table 8: Human UGT1A1 Inhibition Potential of Sofosbuvir 
Intracellular Activation 
The effects of CYP inhibitors and anti-HCV agents on the formation of the pharmacologically active 
triphosphate GS-461203 following incubation of SOF were determined in primary human hepatocytes 
(AD-334-2010, PC-PSI-7977-11-0002). Incubation with the HCV inhibitors VEL, ledipasvir, daclatasvir, 
tegobuvir, vedroprevir, or GS-9669, or the CYP inhibitors ritonavir or ketoconazole, did not markedly 
affect the formation of GS-461203 (less than 30% change). 
Assessment of Induction Liability 
Sofosbuvir caused little or no induction of CYP mRNA or activities when assessed in cultured human 
hepatocytes from 3 separate donors treated once daily for 3 consecutive days (PC-PSI-7977-10-0005). 
Small increases in CYP2B6 activity and CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels observed at the highest 
concentration tested (100 µM) were less than 15% of those caused by the positive controls.  
Interaction with Transporters 
The absorptive permeability of SOF through Caco-2 monolayers was increased by CsA and anti-HCV 
agents due to inhibition of the efflux transport of SOF (AD-334-2002). Modest decreases (approximately 
2-fold) in efflux were observed with LDV, tegobuvir, and GS-9669; moderate effects of approximately 
4-fold were observed with VEL. 
Sofosbuvir is a substrate for BCRP and P-gp (PC-PSI-7977-11-0006). No evidence for SOF transport by 
the basolaterally expressed hepatic transporters, including organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) or organic 
anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1, OATP1B3) was observed in vitro (AD-334-2004, 
PC-PSI-7977-11-0007).  
No evidence for GS-331007 transport by P-gp or BCRP was obtained in vitro (PC-PSI-7977-11-0006). 
GS-331007 was also not a substrate for renal transporters, including organic anion transporter 1 and 3 
(OAT1, OAT3), OCT2, and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) (AD-334-2005, AD-334-2021). 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were not inhibitors of the transporters P-gp, BCRP, multidrug resistance 
related protein (MRP) 2, bile salt export pump (BSEP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 (8215026, 
AD-334-2004, AD-334-2016, AD-334-2021, PC-PSI-7977-11-0006, and PC-PSI-7977-11-0007). 
GS-331007 was also not an inhibitor of the renal transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and MATE1.

Velpatasvir 
Cytochrome P450 and UGT1A1 Inhibition 
Velpatasvir did not inhibit the activities of the tested human enzymes, including CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 (IC50 > 25 μM; AD-281-2008). VEL had an inhibitory effect on the activity of human 
UGT1A1 in vitro (IC50 = 1.56 μM, AD-281-2016).  
Table 9: UGT1A1 Inhibition Potential of Velpatasvir 
Assessment of Induction Liability 
Velpatasvir caused little or no induction of CYP mRNA or activities when assessed in cultured human 
hepatocytes from 3 different donors (AD-281-2025). Small increases in CYP2B6 and 3A4 activity and 
mRNA levels observed at the highest concentration tested of 10 µM were less than 20% of those caused 
by the positive controls. There was no concentration-dependent mRNA increase for CYP2C9, P-gp, or 
UGT1A1.  
Interaction with Transporters 
Velpatasvir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, and inducers may decrease its absorption. There was no clear 
in vitro evidence to show that VEL is a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1 (AD-281-2011, 
AD-281-2026).  
The IC50 for VEL exceeded the Cmax unbound to plasma protein (2.93 nM) by greater than 500-fold for 
P-gp, MRP2, NTCP, OATP1B1, OATP1A2, OATP2B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, and MATE1, thus indicating 
no potential for systemic drug interactions mediated by these transporters. The IC50 for OATP1B1 (0.26 
µM) and BCRP (0.30 µM) exceeded the VEL unbound Cmax by greater than 80-fold, illustrating minimal 
potential for systemic drug-drug interactions mediated by these transporters. 
Velpatasvir also showed some potential to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 (IC50 = 1.5 
µM) and OATP1B3 (IC50 = 0.26 µM) during first pass based on an estimated unbound hepatic inlet 
concentration of 0.305 µM (assuming plasma protein binding of 1%). 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
Cytochrome P450 and UGT1A1 Inhibition 
Velpatasvir is subject to oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C8, while no evidence for 
oxidative metabolism of SOF has been observed. VEL exposure was decreased by a CYP inducer and 
increased by inhibitors of these metabolizing enzymes during clinical studies (GS-US-281-0115). The 
UGT1A1 substrate dolutegravir was unaffected by coadministration with SOF/VEL in a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study (GS-US-342-1167). 
Intracellular Activation 
Coincubation of SOF and VEL with primary human hepatocytes in vitro decreased formation of the 
pharmacologically active triphosphate metabolite of SOF, GS-461203 (AD-334-2010).  
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 36/112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additive to minor synergistic antiviral activity was observed for the combination of SOF and VEL in HCV 
genotype 1a, 2a, 3a, and 4a replicon systems in primary human hepatocytes (PC-334-2004 and 
PC-334-2014). 
Interaction with Transporters 
Sofosbuvir and VEL are substrates of intestinal efflux transporters and their intestinal absorption may be 
increased by coadministration with inhibitors of intestinal efflux transporters or reduced by inducers. 
Sofosbuvir is a substrate but not an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. VEL is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. VEL 
has the potential to inhibit intestinal P-gp, BCRP, and OATP2B1 at concentrations achievable during 
absorption. The permeability of SOF across Caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro is increased in the presence of 
transport inhibitors including VEL (AD-334-2002), which is consistent with the increase in SOF plasma 
exposure observed following coadministration of SOF with VEL (GS-US-281-0101). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir has been analysed in a single-dose oral toxicity study in rats; repeat-dose oral toxicity studies 
in mice (up to 3 months), rats (up to 6 months) and dogs (up to 9 months), genotoxicity tests both in vitro 
and in vivo; a full developmental and reproductive toxicity program, and two-year oral carcinogenicity 
studies in mice and rats. 
Velpatasvir 
Repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance of VEL, as well as phototoxicity 
and the potential for sensitization to velpatasvir have been characterized in in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Most in vivo studies utilized oral administration as this is the clinical route of administration. 
Velpatasvir has low intrinsic aqueous solubility (0.003 mg/mL at pH 8.2), and low solubility in both fasted 
and fed state simulated intestinal fluids (0.028 and 0.21 mg/mL, respectively). In order to maximize oral 
exposure in the nonclinical toxicology studies, 4 formulations were evaluated in rats and rabbits, and 2 
formulations were evaluated in dogs. Results demonstrated that a 60% organic formulation [45% (v/v) 
propylene glycol and 15% (v/v) Kolliphor® HS 15 in reverse osmosis [RO] water, pH 2.0 ± 0.1] was 
optimal in rats and dogs and the high dose levels administered in the GLP toxicity studies (200 mg/kg and 
100 mg/kg in rats and dogs, respectively) are considered the maximal achievable doses via oral 
administration. Administration of velpatasvir in aqueous suspension (0.5% w/v hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose [HPMC], 0.1% v/v Tween 20 and 0.9% v/v benzyl alcohol in RO water) produced the 
highest exposure in rabbits. In mice, aqueous vehicle suspensions (0.2% w/v HPMC, 0.2% v/v Tween 20, 
and 99.6% v/v deionized water) provided increase in exposure up to 1000 mg/kg.

Carcinogenicity 
Long-term studies 
Sofosbuvir 
The carcinogenicity potential of SOF was evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice 
(TX-334-2002) and rats (TX-334-2001). Sofosbuvir was not considered carcinogenic at doses up to 
200/600 (males/females) mg/kg/day in mice and 750 mg/kg/day in rats. Exposure margins (based on

The NOEL for fertility and early embryonic development in rats is 200 mg/kg/day. When compared to the 
mean AUC following administration of the SOF/VEL FDC, the margin of exposure for VEL at the NOEL is 
approximately 6-fold (sexes combined; based on VEL exposure on Day 14 of the 2-week rat study. 
At the developmental NOAELs, VEL exposures in the mouse, rat, and rabbit were approximately 31-, 
6- and 0.7-fold compared with the clinical exposure of SOF/VEL FDC. 
In the rat pre- and postnatal study, VEL at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day had no maternal effects, and no 
effects on behaviour, reproduction, or development of the offspring. Velpatasvir maternal exposure (LD 
10 AUClast 13.9 μg·h/mL) at the maternal and F1 offspring NOEL in the pre- and postnatal development 
study was approximately 5-fold higher than the mean clinical exposure with the SOF/VEL FDC. 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
There are no reproductive or developmental studies with SOF/VEL FDC.

Exposure to VEL generally increased with the increase in dose level from 100 to 1500 mg/kg/day. The 
increases in peak concentration Cmax and AUC0-24 were less-than-dose proportional between 100 and 
1500 mg/kg/day. Sex-based differences were less than 2-fold in VEL Cmax and AUC0-24 values. No 
accumulation of VEL was observed after multiple doses in mice.

Exposure to VEL increased with increasing dose level from 20 to 200 mg/kg/day. The increases in Cmax 
and AUC0-t were less than dose proportional between 20 and 200 mg/kg/day. Sex-based differences in 
VEL Cmax and AUC0-t values were less than 2-fold. No notable accumulation of VEL was observed after 
once daily dosing for 2 weeks in rats.

Exposure to VEL increased with the increase in dose level from 5 to 100 mg/kg/day. Increases in Cmax 
and AUC0-t were generally dose-proportional between 5 and 20 mg/kg/day and less-than-dose 
proportional between 20 and 100 mg/kg/day. Sex-based differences were less than 2-fold in VEL mean 
Cmax and AUC0-t values. No accumulation of VEL was observed after multiple dosing.

Local Tolerance  
Sofosbuvir 
The local tolerance in the GI tract was conducted during the repeat dose oral toxicity studies with SOF. 
Sofosbuvir-related emesis and soft stools/diarrhoea was observed more frequently at doses ≥ 100 
mg/kg/day in the dog studies as compared with controls. The soft stools were also observed in the rat 
Assessment report

studies. These effects may partly be due to the vehicle administered, as similar findings were observed in 
vehicle control animals. 
Sofosbuvir was classified as a non-irritant to skin (TX-334-2009), and was predicted to be a non-severe 
irritant to eyes (TX-334-2008). In the quantitative whole body radiography study using pigmented and 
non-pigmented rats, SOF and its major metabolites did not accumulate in dermal or ocular tissues 
(SA-PSI-7977-09-0005). 
Velpatasvir 
Evaluation of local tolerance in the GI tract conducted during the chronic repeat dose oral studies in the 
rat and dog did not show any notable effects on the GI tract. 
Velpatasvir was classified as a nonirritant to skin (TX-281-2040), and was not considered a severe irritant 
to eyes (TX-281-2039). 
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
No local tolerance studies were conducted for the SOF/VEL FDC. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Antigenicity studies with SOF or VEL have not been conducted based on their lack of antigenic properties. 
Sofosbuvir (TX-334-2010) and VEL (TX-281-2041) showed no potential for sensitization in local lymph 
node assays in mice. 
Immunotoxicity 
No specific immunotoxicity studies were conducted with SOF or VEL.  
Dependence 
No specific studies on dependency of SOF or VEL were conducted. Tissue distribution studies using 
radiolabeled SOF in rat and dog or VEL in mouse and rat indicated that very low concentrations of 
radioactivity at Cmax were observed in the CNS. 
Metabolites 
No specific studies with SOF metabolites were conducted. There are no unique human metabolites with 
SOF and the predominant metabolites were similar across species. The predominant metabolites of SOF, 
GS-566500 and GS-331007, were adequately evaluated in repeat dose studies in mouse, rat, and dog; in 
embryo-fetal development toxicity studies; and in a prenatal and postnatal developmental toxicity study. 
There are no major or unique human metabolites with VEL. Velpatasvir is excreted primarily as the parent 
compound in the bile in all species. 
Studies on impurities 
The impurities and degradation products related to SOF and VEL have been identified in batches of the 
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or drug product. From the SOF/VEL FDC starting materials, 
process intermediates and actual impurities and potential impurities were described, predicted potential 
mutagenicity for 1 VEL starting material, 3 starting material impurities, 1 process intermediate, and 3 
process impurities. Testing during development and process validation demonstrates control of these 
impurities to levels that are below the threshold of toxicological concern. 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 46/112 
 
 
 
 
 
Sofosbuvir 
Two repeat dose studies were conducted in rats to determine if there were unexpected toxic effects from 
SOF-related process impurities (SA-PSI-7977-11-0003 [14 days] and TX-334-2007 [28 days]). No 
adverse treatment-related effects were observed and there were no differences in findings in animals 
treated with lots containing SOF-related process impurities to those observed in previous studies, or to a 
comparator lot.  
Velpatasvir 
GS-604527, a starting material in the manufacturing process of VEL, was positive in TA98 and TA100 in 
the absence and presence of S9 in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (TX-281-2033). 
A 2-week oral gavage toxicity study was conducted in rats to determine the toxicity potential of 
VEL-related process impurities (TX-281-2042). No adverse treatment-related effects were observed and 
there were no differences in findings in animals treated with lots containing VEL-related process 
impurities to those observed in previous studies, or to a comparator lot.  
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir 
The combination of SOF and VEL in the FDC did not introduce new impurities or degradation products. 
Toxicity studies with the single agents were considered sufficient to qualify observed impurities and 
degradation products and no additional qualification studies were necessary. 
Other Toxicity Studies 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir and GS-9851 demonstrated no evidence of mitochondrial toxicity (PC-334-2012, 
PC-PSI-7977-09-0007, PC-PSI-7851-08-0009, PC-334-2015). 
Fourteen-day oral bridging toxicity studies comparing SOF with the diastereomer mixture GS-9851 at 500 
mg/kg/day in both rats (SA-PSI-7977-09-0001) and dogs (SA-PSI-7977-09-0002) did not reveal any 
toxicity or exposure differences between the 2 compounds. 
Sofosbuvir does not absorb light within the range of 290 to 700 nm and there are no nonclinical or clinical 
findings indicative of phototoxicity with SOF.  
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir was positive in the Balb/c 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay (TX-281-2015).  
Velpatasvir at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (5-fold exposure margin versus clinical Cmax) did not produce 
any reactions indicative of phototoxicity (TX-281-2016). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Sofosbuvir is already approved in the EU and no additional assessment of the submitted ERA for SOF was 
required. The ERA is based on the major metabolite of sofosbuvir (GS-331007) which is concluded not to 
be expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Velpatasvir accumulates in sediment in a persistent manner and additional evaluation is required on the 
effects of VEL on sediment-dwelling organisms. The applicant has committed to providing an updated ERA 
report once the final report for the bioaccumulation in sediment-dwelling benthic oligochaetes study has 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016

been completed. It is not possible to conclude on the PBT / vPvB status of Velpatasvir until the results of 
the bioaccumulation in sediment-dwelling benthic oligochaetes study (OECD 315) are available.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Both SOF and VEL have been shown to inhibit HCV genotypes 1-6 replicons. In vitro combination of SOF 
and VEL exhibited an additive and antiviral activity and also an overlapping activity against resistant 
mutants. No antiviral antagonism was observed, and no significant change in cell viability or in vitro 
cross-resistance has been seen.  
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir show low potential for off-target activity and no further studies with the 
combination have therefore been performed or are considered to be needed. 
Due to the differences in metabolism and elimination pathways of SOF and VEL the administration of the 
combination does not affect the PK profile of each other in the liver or systemic circulation. However, a 
higher plasma exposure to SOF is seen after administration of the combination as compared to when 
given alone which is consistent with the identified in vitro interaction via the intestinal efflux transporters 
P-gp and BCRP with SOF being a substrate and VEL both a substrate and inhibitor of these transporters. 
Sofosbuvir seemed overall well tolerated in general toxicity studies of up to 9 months in rat and dog. In 
toxicity studies at high doses effects were noted in the gastrointestinal tract, liver and the haematological 
system. Reproductive toxicity was studied in rat and rabbit and while no relevant potential for adverse 
reproductive effects was evident, the high dose likely was suboptimal in these studies. Velpatasvir also 
seemed to be well tolerated and no target tissues were identified in any of the repeat dose toxicological 
studies performed up to 26 week in rat and 39 week in dog. No reproductive toxicity was seen in rat or 
mouse. However, it has not convincingly been able to show that velpatasvir may not have a teratogenic 
potential in the rabbits. This information is reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Studies in vitro and in vivo for genotoxic potential were negative and consistent with a low mutagenic 
potential of both sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat showed 
no carcinogenic potential for sofosbuvir. Carcinogenicity studies with velpatasvir are ongoing. 
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir thus does not have any overlapping toxicological profiles and there is no 
toxicological concern with this combination based on available non-clinical data. No toxicological studies 
have been performed with the combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir and none are considered to be 
needed. 
The toxicological qualification of specified impurities and residual solvents is considered to be sufficient for 
both compounds. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The review of non-clinical data available for sofosbuvir and velpatasvir overall indicates no major issues 
for concern for the combination of these two substances.  
The applicant will provide the VEL carcinogenicity study reports as soon as finalised (reports are projected 
to be available in Q4 2016 (mouse), and Q4 2017 (rat)). In addition the applicant committed to provide 
an updated ERA report once the final report for the bioaccumulation in sediment-dwelling benthic 
oligochaetes study has been completed (Q2 2017).

Velpatasvir is a new chemical entity and the PK evaluation aimed at characterisation of the disposition of 
the compound and its interaction potential to support dosing recommendations and to predict patient 
populations and clinical situations in which pharmacokinetics may be different from that in the average 
patient population evaluated in the clinical development programme. Velpatasvir has a wide safety 
margin. The clinical pharmacology has been investigated in healthy volunteers and HCV patients.  
Sofosbuvir is an authorised medicinal product (Sovaldi, 2013 and is contained in the fixed dose 
combination of Harvoni [sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir], 2014). All relevant data along with new data obtained 
with the fixed dose combination with velpatasvir is described in this assessment report.

GS-331007) concentrations in human plasma were based on deuterium and/or 13C labelled internal 
standards and LC/MS/MS. The sample preparation for VEL was liquid-liquid extraction and for SOF and 
metabolites sample preparation was protein precipitation extraction. All methods were validated. The SOF 
intracellular active metabolite GS-461203 has not been possible to measure in vivo.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard statistical methods and non-compartmental methods were used to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics. Population PK analysis was characterised by non-linear mixed effects modelling 
including data from healthy subjects in phase I studies and patients in phase II/III studies. 
Formulations  
All phase III studies and a majority of the DDI studies were performed with the intended commercial fixed 
dose combination (FDC) formulation, SOF/VEL (400 mg/100 mg). The SOF/VEL FDC tablets at 
400mg/100mg showed similar AUCinf and Cmax for SOF, GS-566500, GS-331007 and VEL as compared to 
co-administered SOF and VEL as mono components. The point estimates for AUCinf and Cmax (%GLSM 
ratio) for the FDC tablet were within 90-107%.  
Absorption 
Sofosbuvir 
For sofosbuvir, following a single dose of the SOF/VEL FDC tablet in fasted state, the tmax was 1 and 3 h 
for SOF and GS-331007, respectively.  
In vitro studies show that SOF is subject to marked efflux, mediated by P-gp and/or BCRP. 
Co-administration of a single dose CsA increased the exposure to sofosbuvir 4.5-fold. The bioavailability 
of drug related material is at least 50%, although the absolute value is unknown. 
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir was relatively rapidly absorbed with a tmax of 3 h after administration of the SOF/VEL FDC 
tablet in healthy volunteers. The solubility is pH dependent (41 mM at pH 2 and <0.11 mM at pH 5) and 
in FaSSIF and FeSSIF the solubility was <11 µM and 11 µM, respectively. In vitro, VEL was shown to be 
a BRCP and P-gp substrate. Co-administration of a single dose of 600 mg Cyclosporin A (CsA) increased 
the exposure to velpatasvir approximately 2-fold. The absolute bioavailability of VEL has not been 
determined in humans.  
SOF/VEL 
Co-administration of velpatasvir with sofosbuvir has an effect on exposure of sofosbuvir (approx. 2-fold 
increase). The half-life of SOF and metabolites were unaffected and the effect on exposure is likely due to 
intestinal inhibition P-gp and/or BCRP caused by velpatasvir. Exposure of metabolite GS-566500 was also 
increased nearly 2-fold, while GS-331007 was in general unaffected. There was no relevant change of 
velpatasvir steady state PK parameters when co-administrated with single dose SOF. 
Food effect  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
The effect of food on PK after a single-dose of SOF/VEL FDC tablet was investigated in healthy volunteers. 
Administration with food increased AUC of SOF by 60% and 78% and slightly decreased Cmax by 5% and 
12% after a moderate and high fat meal, respectively. The AUC of GS-331017 was not affected with or 
without food, while Cmax decreased 25% and 37%, respectively. The plasma exposure achieved for VEL 
upon administration of SOF/VEL after a moderate and high fat meal was an increase of 34% and 21% 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 55/112 
 
 
 
 
 
(AUC) and 31% and 5% (Cmax), respectively. The influence of food on velpatasvir and sofosbuvir exposure 
was limited and thus SOF/VEL can be administered without regard to food. 
Distribution  
Sofosbuvir 
The unbound plasma fraction of SOF was approximately 15% ex vivo and seems to be independent of 
concentration. No effect of renal impairment was seen on degree of binding. GS-331007 is minimally 
bound to plasma proteins. The mean whole blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was approximately 0.71. 
In the Pop-PK analysis Vc/F for SOF was estimated to 197 L. 
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir is highly protein bound in plasma (in vitro, fraction unbound 0.3-0.5%) and independent of 
concentration (0.1–2 µM). In severe renally impaired subjects the unbound fraction was similar to 
subjects with normal renal function (~0.3%). Unbound plasma concentration in subjects with hepatic 
impairment (HI) was determined in vitro and was found to be similar (0.2-0.3%) in plasma from in 
subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI compared to subjects with normal liver function. The mean 
whole blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.52 to 0.67. In the population PK analysis the 
estimated apparent oral volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc/F) for VEL was 392 L in a 
typical subject (male HCV patient with normal or Child-Pugh-Turcotte A (CPT A) hepatic function). 
Elimination  
From the popPK analysis the estimated CL/F in a typical HCV patient (male with normal/CPT A hepatic 
function) was 47 L/hr and 352 L/h, and t½ was 19 h and 0.39 h, for velpatasvir and sofosbuvir, 
respectively. 
Excretion 
Sofosbuvir 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the dose was greater 
than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, and expired air, 
respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 (78%) while 3.5% 
was recovered as sofosbuvir. This data indicate that renal clearance is the major elimination pathway for 
GS-331007 with a large part actively secreted. While subject to active tubular secretion, GS 331007 is not 
a substrate for renal transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or 3, OCT2, MRP2, P gp, 
BCRP or MATE1. Sofosbuvir is not a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1 or 1B3, and 
OCT1. 
Velpatasvir 
In the human mass balance study following a single dose of 100 mg the mean cumulative urinary and 
fecal recovery of [14C]-radioactivity was 95% with relative recovery of 0.4% in urine and 94% in faeces. 
Velpatasvir was the major compound found in faeces accounting for on average 77% of the administered 
dose. Unchanged parent drug was <0.1% of dose in urine. Velpatasvir is a substrate for hepatic uptake 
transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B and efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP, but 
not a substrate for organic cat-ion transporter (OCT) 1.

Metabolism 
Sofosbuvir 
Sofosbuvir is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestine and in the liver. The active 
metabolite GS-461203 is formed through several metabolic steps (Figure 4). In vitro, SOF is rapidly 
hydrolysed by CatA and CES1 to form GS-566500 which is further metabolised to eventually form the 
active triphosphate nucleoside analogue GS-461203. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not substrates of 
UGT1A1 or CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes. 
In plasma, GS-331007 constituted the majority (90%) of measured radioactivity. The intermediate 
metabolite GS-566500 has a tmax of 1 h and has a half-life of 2 h. The major metabolite GS-331007 peaks 
at 2 h and has a half-life of 26 h. GS-331007 and GS-566500 are not active metabolites.  
Figure 4: Intracellular metabolism pathway of SOF (GS-7977) 
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir was relatively stable when incubated in human microsomes or hepatocytes. In the human 
ADME study most (~99%) of the total radioactivity in the AUC-pooled plasma samples was attributed to 
parent compound with 0.4% and 0.5% attributed to metabolites hydroxy-GS-5816-1 (M18) and 
desmethyl-GS-5816 (M19). In faeces, parent compound on average accounting for 77% of the 
administered dose, followed by M18 and M19, accounting for 6% and 3% of the dose up to 144 hours 
post-dose, respectively (Figure 5). In addition 2 unknown metabolites M7 and M11 were detected in feces 
each accounted for 2.8% and 0.5% of the dose, respectively.

in humans 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Velpatasvir exhibited nonlinear PK after single dose across the dose range of 5 to 450 mg. Increase in 
exposure was larger than dose-proportional from 5 to 50 mg and increased less than in proportion to dose 
at doses from 50 mg to 450 mg in healthy subjects. In HCV patients, after multiple dosing there was no 
clear systematic deviations from dose proportionality for velpatasvir in the range 25 to 150 mg. There was 
no evidence of time-dependent PK for VEL over a 3 day period. 
For SOF no indication of non-linearity was observed in the range 200-1200 mg. There was no evidence of 
time-dependent PK for SOF over a 7 day period.  
Inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability of the VEL PK was determined to 51% for CL/F, 69% for Vc/F, 51% for Vp and 
54% for Ka (CV%) from the population PK analysis.  
Population PK analysis 
The population PK of velpatasvir was described by a 2-compartment model with first order absorption, 
first order elimination from the central compartment and an absorption lag time. Female gender and 
hepatic function were statistically significant covariates on CL/F and Vc/F. Females had lower CL/F and 
V/F compared to males. HCV infected subjects with CPT-B or C had higher CL/F and V/F compared to 
subjects with normal or CPT-A hepatic function. Food had an effect on F1, Ka and Tlag. However, no 
covariate had a clinically meaningful impact on velpatasvir exposure. Other tested covariates, including 
age, weight, race, renal function, (compensated) cirrhosis, genotypes, IL28B status did not show any 
statistically significant impact on the PK of velpatasvir.

For sofosbuvir a one-compartment model with first order absorption, first order elimination from the 
central compartment and an absorption lag time was used for description of plasma PK. Female gender 
and hepatic function were statistically significant covariates on CL/F. Females had lower CL/F compared to 
males and HCV infected subjects with CPT-B or C had lower CL/F compared to subjects with normal or 
CPT-A hepatic function. Food had an effect on Ka. However, no covariate had a clinically meaningful 
impact on sofosbuvir exposure. Other tested covariates, such as age, weight, race, renal function, 
(compensated) cirrhosis, genotypes, IL28B status did not show any statistically significant impact on the 
PK of sofosbuvir. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population  
Sofosbuvir 
The CL/F for SOF was 352 L/h for a typical subject (fasting male HCV infected patient without hepatic 
impairment or CPT-A), typical Vc/F was 197 L and t½ was 0.4 h. For the once daily regimen of SOF/VEL 
FDC, model predicted steady state AUC was 1135 ng·hr/mL for a typical subject. The model predicted AUC 
values for the population (5 to 95%tile) were 731 to 2510 ng·hr/mL. 
Velpatasvir 
Based on the population PK analysis, velpatasvir CL/F and half-life in a typical subject (fasting male 
HCV-infected with normal or hepatic function CPT-A) was determined to be 46.5 L/h and 18.8 h, 
respectively. The model predicted steady state exposure to velpatasvir after once daily regimen of 
SOF/VEL (400 mg/100 mg), was 2149 ng·hr/mL for a typical subject. The model predicted AUC values for 
the population (5 to 95%tile) were 1066 to 6307 ng·hr/mL (-50% to 193% different from typical value).  
Special Populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Sofosbuvir 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied following 7 day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in HCV 
infected patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C).  Relative to patients 
with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher in moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment, while the GS 331007 AUC0 24 was 18% and 9% higher, respectively.   
Velpatasvir 
Single dose (100 mg) PK of VEL was investigated in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh-Turcotte-B, 
CPT-B) and severe (CPT-C) hepatic impairment. The plasma exposure (AUC) was marginally affected 
while Cmax was lowered in subjects with both moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to 
subjects with normal liver function. The VEL half-life was slightly increased in subjects with HI compared 
to subjects with normal liver function.  
Renal impairment 
Sofosbuvir 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir were studied in HCV negative patients with mild (eGFR ≥ 50 and <80 
mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal impairment (eGFR <30

mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a single 400 mg dose of 
sofosbuvir.  Relative to patients with normal renal function (eGFR >80 mL/min/1.73 m2), the sofosbuvir 
AUC was 61%, 107% and 171% higher in mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, while the GS 
331007 AUC was 55%, 88% and 451% higher, respectively.  In patients with ESRD, sofosbuvir AUC was 
28% higher when sofosbuvir was dosed 1 h before haemodialysis compared with 60% higher when dosed 
1 hour after haemodialysis, respectively.  The AUC0-inf of GS-331007 in patients with ESRD administered 
with sofosbuvir 1 hour before or 1 h after haemodialysis was at least 10-fold and 20-fold higher, 
respectively.  GS 331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of 
approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 h haemodialysis removed 18% of 
administered dose. 
Velpatasvir 
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg in HCV negative subjects 
with severe renal impairment median (CrCL<30 ml/min by Cockcroft-Gault). The exposure (AUC) of VEL 
was approximately 50% higher, with similar Cmax, in the subjects with severe renal impairment as 
compared to subjects with normal renal function.  
Age, sex, race, body weight 
Female subjects had a lower CL/F of VEL and SOF compared to male subjects, resulting in an 
approximately 50% and 20% higher exposure, respectively, compared to male subjects.  
The Population PK analyses of SOF, GS-331007 and VEL did not suggest a significant effect of race 
(described as White, Black, Asian and Other) on the kinetics of either compound.  
Body weight (range 40 – 182 kg) did not have a clinically significant effect on VEL or SOF exposure 
according to the population pharmacokinetic analysis.  
No formal PK study in elderly patients has been conducted. However, the impact of age (range 18 – 82 
years) on the PK of SOF and VEL has been evaluated as a covariate in the population PK analyses. No 
clinically significant effect on VEL exposure was observed in subjects ≥75 years administered velpatasvir, 
however the number of subjects was limited (n=14). 
The safety and efficacy of SOF/VEL in children and adolescents aged <18 years have not yet been 
established. The SOF/VEL FDC is not indicated in patients less than 18 years. 
Drug-Drug Interactions 
Effects of other medical products on the pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir and SOF/VEL  
Velpatasvir is relatively metabolically stable in incubations in human microsomes and hepatocytes and 
the majority of the administered oral radioactive dose was found as parent compound in faeces. The 
major elimination pathway(s) for VEL is not fully understood, however most likely biliary excretion is a 
major pathway. In vitro, VEL was determined to be a substrate for P-gp and BCRP and indicated to be an 
OATP1B3 substrate, but not an OCT1 or OATP1B1 substrate. 
Velpatasvir was administered with both single and repeated dosing of rifampicin. The duration of the 
repeat dosing was a bit short (7 days) for full effect of induction, but the resulting decrease in exposure 
was 70-80% decrease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 60/112 
 
 
 
 
 
The effect of ketoconazole (P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor) was limited on the exposure of VEL (AUC 
increased 70%) and administration of single dose rifampicin (OATP1B1/3 inhibitor as single dose) 
resulted in 47% increase of AUC. In addition, velpatasvir exposure was approx. 2-fold when 
co-administered with CsA (an inhibitor of multiple transporters).  
The solubility of VEL is pH dependent and therefore medical products that increase gastric pH are 
expected to decrease plasma concentration of VEL. When SOF/VEL was combined with famotidine 
simultaneously or staggered (VEL dosed 12 hours after famotidine) the decrease in exposure was 
approximately 10-20% for both SOF and VEL. Co-administration of SOF/VEL with 20 mg omeprazole 
simultaneously in the fasting state, the decrease of SOF and VEL exposure (AUC) was 29% and 46%, 
respectively, and staggered (given 12 hours after omeprazole), 44% and 55% respectively.  
SOF/VEL (400/100 mg) has been studied in several combinations of antiretroviral treatments. Summaries 
of the effect of HIV ARV regimens on the SOF/VEL PK in healthy subjects are given in Table 28. For the 
combinations EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF, RAL+ FTC/TDF, FTC/RPV/TDF, E/C/F/TAF and DTG there was no or 
slight increase of the VEL exposure. For the combination with ATV+RTV+ FTC/TDF the increase was 
substantial. 
When SOF/VEL was administered with EFV/FTC/TDF the exposure of VEL decreased substantially 
(50-60%). Both VEL and SOF exposure decreased up to 30-40% when co-administered with DRV+RTV+ 
FTC/TDF and LPV/r+ FTC/TDF (Table 28).

Effects of velpatasvir and SOF/VEL on the pharmacokinetics of other medical products 
Velpatasvir showed no direct inhibition on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
CYP3A4 or UGT1A1. Based in vitro data, no relevant induction signal was observed for AhR (CYP1A2) and 
CAR (CYP2B6). An in vitro induction signal was detected for PXR (CYP3A4), however based on clinical data 
interactions due to induction of PXR is considered low.  
In vitro studies showed that VEL was not an inhibitor of drug transporters BSEP, MATE1, MRP2, OAT1, 
OAT3, OATP1A2, OATP2B1, OCT1, OCT2, or NTCP (sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein) at 
clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, VEL showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, P-gp and BCRP with IC50 of 1.5, 0.26, 20.6 and 0.30 μM, respectively. These results indicate 
that a clinically relevant interaction between VEL and OATP1B1 and 1B3 and intestinal inhibition of P-gp 
and BCRP by VEL substrates cannot be excluded. The inhibitory potential of VEL on OATP1B1/3, P-gp and 
BCRP has been investigated in clinical DDI studies.  
There was a limited effect on the cyclosporine (CYP3A4 substrate) exposure (slightly decreased) following 
co-administration after multiple dosing with VEL relative to CsA administered alone.  
For pravastatin (OATP1B1 and MRP2 and possibly CYP3A substrate) the in vivo exposure (AUC) was 
approximately 1.4-fold following co-administration with VEL, relative to pravastatin administration alone. 
Rosuvastatin (OATP1B1/3 and BCRP substrate) exposure was 2.7-fold following co-administration with 
VEL, relative to rosuvastatin administration alone. The median half-life for both pravastatin and 
rosuvastatin was similar with and without velpatasvir.  
Digoxin (P-gp probe) exposure increased following co-administration with VEL, relative to digoxin 
administration alone.  
It can be concluded that VEL is an in vivo P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3 inhibitor. 
The effect of VEL on the PK of a representative hormonal contraceptive (OC) medication (norgestimate 
/ethinyl estradiol) was studied. Similar systemic exposures of norelgestromin and norgestrel were 
achieved following OC co-administration with and without VEL (exposure decreased 3% to 10% point

estimates). An approximate 39% increase in ethinyl estradiol Cmax and decrease in Ctau (approximately 
17% point estimate 90% CI 65, 106) were observed with no change in AUCtau when VEL was 
co-administered with OC compared with OC alone.

SOF/VEL has been studied in several combinations of antiretroviral treatments. Summaries of the effect 
of SOF/VEL 400/100 mg on the PK of HIV ARV regimens in healthy subjects are given in Table 30. The 
exposure of tenofovir (TFV) increased in all cohorts with the highest increase with the EFV/FTC/TDF 
combination.  
Sofosbuvir 
Effects of other medical products on the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir  
Renal secretion is involved in the elimination of GS-566500 and GS-331007. The transporter(s) involved 
are unknown, but it has been shown that GS-331007 is not a substrate for renal transporters OAT1 or 3, 
OCT2, MRP2, P-gp, BCRP or MATE1. Sofosbuvir is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate for 
hepatic uptake transporters, OATP1B1, OATP1B1B3, or OCT1. 
A 600 mg single dose of CsA had a large effect on SOF exposure with a 4.5-fold increase. However, the 
exposure to GS-331007 was not statistically different. Tacrolimus did not affect exposure to SOF or its 
metabolites.  
The in vivo effect on SOF exposure of the strong P-gp inducer rifampicin was significant. Medicinal 
products that are potent P gp inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, St. John’s wort, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital and phenytoin) are contraindicated with sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®, Post Approval Measurement 
EMEA/H/C/002798/II/0018). In addition, medicinal products that are moderate P gp inducers (e.g. 
oxcarbazepine and modafinil) are not recommended to be co-administered with sofosbuvir. 
Effects of sofosbuvir on the pharmacokinetics of other medical products 
Sofosbuvir and its metabolite, GS-331007 did not show detectable in vitro inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6, CYP3A or UGT1A1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016

Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 was observed in vitro. An in vivo DDI study with oral contraceptives 
co-administered with sofosbuvir for 7 days did not show any sign of reduced exposure.  
Sofosbuvir and GS 331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and OCT1. GS 331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1. 
DDI studies have been performed in healthy volunteers and patients to evaluate effect of SOF on the PK 
of methadone, CsA and tacrolimus. Further, the effect of these medications on the PK of SOF and its 
metabolites has been evaluated. Methadone exposure was unaffected by SOF as were exposures to CsA 
and tacrolimus, although Cmax for tacrolimus was decreased by almost 30%.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Discussion on clinical pharmacokinetics 
Basic pharmacokinetic characteristics for velpatasvir such as absorption, distribution and elimination 
have been sufficiently investigated, however the Applicant committed to perform and provide a few 
studies post-authorisation.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The velpatasvir PK is considered straightforward. The mean faecal and urinary recovery of 
[14C]-radioactivity was 94% and 0.4%, respectively. Velpatasvir was the major compound found in faeces 
accounting for on average 77% of the administered dose and it is unknown if this is unabsorbed 
velpatasvir or excreted via bile. The elimination of VEL is not fully understood, partly due to that the 
bioavailability is unknown. Two scenarios are considered: The first scenario being if the fraction absorbed 
is >25%, only unchanged parent compound via bile will be considered a major elimination pathway. This 
is the case since the largest metabolic pathway (M18) under these circumstances will only be responsible 
for maximum 23.6% (5.9%/25%) of the VEL elimination. A second scenario is if the fraction absorbed is 
less than 25%, then both unchanged parent compound eliminated via bile and metabolism to M18 are 
considered as important elimination pathways (i.e. contributes to ≥25% of drug elimination). The 
Applicant has not provided unambiguous data to show that the fraction absorbed (fa) is >25%. However 
there is evidence indicating that fa is >25% as radioactivity excreted after 48 h can be considered 
systematically available. Based on mean data approximately at least 35% was excreted >48 h after 
administration. Also, velpatasvir has been shown to be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP and in vivo inhibition 
with e.g. cyclosporine or ATR/r resulted in a 2 to 2.4-fold increase in exposure. Even so, it cannot be 
concluded that biliary excretion of parent is the only major elimination pathway. Therefore it the 
suggested investigations to identify the enzyme responsible for formation of M18 is supported.  
Special populations  
Renal Impairment 
The exposure (AUC) of VEL was ca. 50% higher, with similar Cmax, in the subjects with severe renal 
impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function. This was somewhat unexpected since 
renal elimination of VEL is negligible. However, the change in exposure due to renal impairment may be 
a result of renal impairment affecting VEL intestinal and hepatic metabolism and/or transport. The VEL 
half-life was not altered by renal impairment which indicates that the increase in exposure is due to an 
alteration in the absorption/first-pass process. Independent of the reason for increased exposure of VEL 
in severe renal impaired subjects, the change is not considered clinically relevant as the safety margin for 
VEL is wide and therefore no dose adjustments for patients with any grade of renal impairment are 
needed. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. Of note, the efficacy and safety for sofosbuvir have not 
been established in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and end stage 
renal disease (ESRD). 
Hepatic impairment 
For the total plasma concentration, AUC is marginally affected by grade of hepatic impairment (HI) and 
Cmax is lowered. The half-life of VEL increased in subjects with HI (from 18 h in HV to 31 h in severe HI) 
which indicates that the elimination of VEL is prolonged in subjects with HI. Unbound plasma 
concentration in subjects with hepatic impairment (HI) was determined in vitro and was found to be 
similar (0.2-0.3%) in plasma from in subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI compared to subjects with 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 66/112 
 
 
  
 
normal liver function. No dose adjustment for patients with any grade of HI is needed of exposure 
reasons. The study data is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Age, sex, race, body weight 
Female subjects had a lower CL/F of VEL and SOF compared to male subjects, resulting in approximately 
50% and 20%, respectively, higher exposure compared to male subjects. No apparent relation has been 
observed between adverse events and exposure. The increased exposure in women is therefore not 
considered clinically relevant. The Population PK did not suggest a significant effect of age, race and 
weight. The safety and efficacy of SOF/VEL in children and adolescents aged <18 years have not yet been 
established. The SOF/VEL FDC is not indicated in patients less than 18 years. These intrinsic factors have 
been reflected in the SmPC.  
Drug- drug interactions 
Effects of VEL and SOF/VEL on PK of other medical products 
In vitro, velpatasvir showed no direct inhibition on the CYPs, however it has not been investigated 
whether velpatasvir is as a mechanism based inhibitor. The Applicant should perform an in vitro study to 
investigate if there is any inhibitory effect of pre-incubation with NADPH for all individual CYPs (i.e. the 
same CYPs as for competitive inhibition should be investigated) according to Guideline on the 
Investigation of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/rev 1, 2012). The data from the in vitro study will 
be provided post approval and depending on outcome further DDI studies could be requested.  
There was a clear in vitro induction signal for CYP3A4 (PXR) with gene expression increases of 2.7 to 
30-fold in the hepatocyte lots investigated. No dedicated in vivo DDI was performed, however a DDI study 
with FTC/RPV/TDF is considered to be relevant, as RPV is a relatively sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and it is 
unlikely that FTC or TDF has an effect on RPV exposure. The duration of VEL dosing was 8 days and is 
short, but sufficient to detect any clinically relevant induction potential. No overt treatment sequence 
effect was observed. Although, the DDI study was not optimally designed to investigate CYP induction, 
the data indicate that the risk of in vivo induction of PXR appears to be low. 
In vitro, VEL showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, P-gp and BCRP and 
clinically relevant interactions between VEL and substrates of these transporters cannot be excluded. 
Clinical DDI studies with statins (pravastatin OATP1B1, MRP2, possibly CYP3A substrate; rosuvastatin 
OATP1B1/3 and BCRP substrate) and digoxin (P-gp substrate) were performed.  
In vivo, the exposure was 1.4-fold higher and 2.7-fold for pravastatin and rosuvastatin, respectively, 
following co-administration with VEL, relative to statin administration alone. The similar median half-life 
for both pravastatin and rosuvastatin with and without VEL, indicates the lack of effect of VEL on the 
systemic clearance of the probe drugs. The in vivo increase of rosuvastatin exposure is likely mostly 
dependent on BCRP and/or OATP1B3 inhibition, since both pravastatin and rosuvastatin are suitable 
OATP1B1 probes and the effect on pravastatin was minor. In the SmPC no dose adjustment is 
recommended for pravastatin, while the highest recommended dose of rosuvastatin is 10 mg. These 
recommendations are acceptable. A general text is added in the SmPC regarding risk of increase in 
exposure of substrates of P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/3. 
The exposure of digoxin, AUC and Cmax was 34% and 88% higher, respectively, following 
co-administration with VEL, relative to digoxin administration alone. In the SmPC caution and 
concentration monitoring is recommended as SOF/VEL may increase the digoxin concentration. This is 
acceptable. Dabigatran etexilate, which is the recommended in vivo probe to study intestinal P-gp 
inhibition, was not studied. Dabigatran etexilate has a narrow therapeutic interval and the SmPC 
recommendation is clinical monitoring and signs of bleeding and anaemia.  
It can be concluded that VEL is an in vivo P-gp, BCRP and OATP1B inhibitor.

The effect of VEL on the PK of a representative hormonal oral contraceptive (OC) medication was studied. 
Similar systemic exposures of ethinyl estradiol, norelgestromin and norgestrel were achieved following 
OC co-administration with and without VEL. No loss in contraceptive efficacy containing 
norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol is expected based on PK and PD results. In the study of OC in combination 
with SOF the duration was only 7 days. The study is considered to be too short to fully exclude a minor 
induction, however no sign of reduced exposure was observed and a clinically relevant effect is not 
expected based on the data. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
SOF/VEL has been studied in several combinations of antiretroviral treatments. Summaries of the effect 
of SOF/VEL 400/100 mg on the PK of HIV ARV regimens in healthy subjects are given in Table 30. It is 
considered to be no clinically relevant change in exposure of EFV, RPV, DTG, EVG, FTC, COBI, or TAF when 
co-administered with SOF/VEL in the antiretroviral combinations. The exposure of tenofovir (TFV) 
increased in all cohorts with the highest increase with the EFV/FTC/TDF combination. A caution involving 
renal monitoring is included in the SmPC when TFV is part of the regimen. 
Effects of other medical products on the PK of VEL and SOF/VEL 
DDI studies with ketoconazole (P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor), single dose rifampicin (OATP1B1/3 inhibitor 
at single dose) and cyclosporine (multiple transporter inhibitor) have been performed, resulting in an 
increase of VEL AUC and Cmax of 71% and 29%, 46% and 28%, 103% and 56%, respectively. The VEL 
half-life was similar when co-administered with rifampicin and CsA and was slightly prolonged with 
ketoconazole, i.e. both pre-systemic and systemic inhibition is likely involved in the latter case. The P-gp 
and CYP3A4 contributions cannot be separated as the inhibitor used is not selective and both are 
expressed in the liver and intestine. The in vivo results confirm that VEL is an OATP1B, P-gp/CYP3A4 
substrate and that BCRP could be involved in the transport of VEL. The safety margin of velpatasvir is very 
wide and no safety issue is expected with this magnitude of increase in exposure. The data and 
recommendation are adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
The solubility of VEL is pH dependent and therefore medical products that increase gastric pH are 
expected to decrease plasma concentration of VEL. When SOF/VEL was combined with famotidine 
simultaneously or staggered (12 hours after famotidine) the decrease in exposure was approximately 
10-20% for both SOF and VEL. The SmPC includes the recommendation is that no dose adjustment is 
needed for famotidine up to 40 mg BID.  
Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir was co-administered with omeprazole 20 mg simultaneously in the fasting state, 
the decrease of SOF and VEL exposure (AUC) was 29% and 46%, respectively, and staggered (12 hours 
after omeprazole), 44% and 55% respectively. The decrease in SOF/VEL exposure in fasting state was 
considered to be large, which led to a new study; SOF/VEL was co-administered with omeprazole in the 
fed state. However, there is a caveat in the study design, namely that the reference treatment was given 
in the fasted state, while the test with PPI was given in the fed state. As both compounds VEL and SOF 
have a higher exposure in the fed state, the fasted state exposure is not a straightforward comparison. 
Administering SOF/VEL with food increases VEL exposure and in essence, PPI with food will diminish the 
decrease in absolute exposure terms. The Applicant presented data indicating that subjects with highest 
exposure in reference treatment showed the largest decrease in VEL exposure with PPI. As VEL shows a 
pH dependent solubility a mechanistic plausible explanation is that the patients with low exposure already 
had relatively high gastric pH and thus the pH was not changed to same extent as in a subject with lower 
gastric pH.  
Since the Applicant has not clearly described the efficacious plasma levels, it is difficult to judge an 
acceptable magnitude of decrease in exposure. Consequently a cautious approach is needed regarding 
co-medication with PPIs to not compromise the efficacy and therefore co- medication with proton pump 
inhibitors is not recommended. If it is considered necessary to co-administer, then SOF/VEL should be 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 68/112 
 
 
  
administered with food and taken 4 h before proton pump inhibitor (as studied) at max doses comparable 
to omeprazole 20 mg.       
When velpatasvir was administered with repeated dosing (7 days) of rifampicin the resulting decrease in 
exposure was large (70-80% decrease). The duration of the rifampicin dosing was a bit short as the 
recommended duration to obtain full induction effect is 10-14 days. The effect of rifampicin was extensive 
also on the SOF exposure (decrease of 70-80% when studied as the mono-component Sovaldi®, 
EMEA/H/C/002798/II/0018). The large decrease in exposure for both SOF and VEL in combination with 
the short duration of dosing of rifampicin, i.e. the decrease of exposure of VEL could be even larger, 
should lead to a contraindication with strong P-pg inducers (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin, St. John’s wort, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin). Also, medicinal products that are moderate P-gp inducers 
(e.g. oxcarbazepine and modafinil) are not recommended to be co-administered with SOF/VEL. This is 
reflected in the SmPC.  
SOF/VEL (400/100 mg) has been studied in several combinations of antiretroviral treatments. Summaries 
of the effect of HIV ARV regimens on the SOF/VEL PK in healthy subjects are given in Table 30. The safety 
margin for VEL is wide and no dose adjustment of SOF/VEL is required for these six ARV combinations. 
This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. Ribavirin is commonly co-medicated with SOF/VEL. There is no 
clinically relevant effect on the exposure of SOF and VEL. 
When SOF/VEL was administered with EFV/FTC/TDF the exposure of VEL decreased 50-60%. An effect on 
P-pg and possibly enzymes by EFV (inducer) is likely the mechanism for the change in exposure of VEL. 
As reflected in the SmPC co-administration of SOF/VEL with efavirenz containing regimens is not 
recommended.  
Population PK  
The popPK model for velpatasvir was overall able to describe the data and it can be concluded that the 
model could be used for predicting individual exposure and further used in PK/PD modelling. There were 
some issues with the PopPK model for sofosbuvir e.g. some model misspecification was observed in the 
VPCs, a high  shrinkage and high residual error. Although the popPK model is not optimal it is considered 
acceptable for describing the data. The SOF PopPK model can currently not be used for predictive 
purpose. The issue will not be further pursued, however if the Applicant wishes to use the popPK model for 
simulations and further product claims, an updated model is requested.  
The pharmacodynamics of SOF has been well characterized and has been presented during the approval 
of Sovaldi (SOF as single agent). In brief summary, SOF has pangenotypic activity and carries a high 
resistance barrier. There seems to be only one key mutation (S282T) which has relevant impact on 
susceptibility. However, S282T has a profound effect on viral fitness, and mutant virus was shown to 
rapidly revert to WT virus when drug pressure is stopped SOF can therefore be used in re-treatment of 
patients who failed SOF-containing treatment. 
VEL is highly potent in vitro against HCV genotype 1 to 6, with mean EC50 values ranging from 0.002 to 
0.13 nM. In addition, VEL retains high potency against a broad range of NS5A polymorphisms observed 
across HCV genotypes 2a, 2b, 3a, and 4a, including the M31 polymorphism in NS5A, in genotype 2 virus. 
The majority of variants across genotypes 1-6 conferred a greater fold increase in EC50 to LDV and DCV 
than to VEL.  
Y93H remains a challenge in specific genotypes; this variant showed 46-fold reduced susceptibility in 
genotype 2a (seemingly without relevance), very high fold changes in genotypes 1a (609), 2b (4582), 
and 3a (724), but <3.3-fold resistance in genotype 1b and 4a. Considering the prevalence of Y93H in 
different genotypes, the clinical relevance in patients without prior NS5A therapy seems restricted to 
genotype-3 infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 69/112 
 
 
  
Three-day VEL monotherapy resulted in 3-4 log reductions in viral load. Treatment-emergent NS5A RAVs 
were seen in the majority of viral isolates post baseline. Whether this is an effect of de novo resistance 
development, or rather an effect selection effect where pre-existing variants are seen when wild type 
virus is cleared is hard to tell.  
In longer-term follow-up, Y93H persisted in patients with genotype 1a, 1b, and 3-virus, after only three 
days of monotherapy with therapeutic doses.  
The Y93H mutation in genotype-3 infection is the only naturally occurring NS5A RAV that had a relevant 
impact on treatment outcome with SOF/VEL. This RAV is seen at baseline in slightly less than 10% of 
genotype-3 isolates in previously untreated patients, and has apparently no relevant impact on viral 
fitness. Y93H is universally found in genotype-3 infected patients who failed therapy with SOF + an 
NS5A-inhibitor, VEL included. This is of great clinical importance when discussing re-treatment options, in 
particular for patients with cirrhosis, where a delayed effective re-treatment may have severe 
consequences. At present, the issue in practice mostly concern genotype-3 infected patients with 
cirrhosis. How to re-treat such patients after a failure with SOF/VEL is not so clear.  
It was shown that NS5A RAVs (single and multiple) typically seen in genotype-1 infected patients failing 
available NS5A-containing with few exceptions have no relevant impact on velpatasvir susceptibility in 
vitro (genotype-1 virus).  Furthermore, the cure rate with SOF/VEL therapy was in practice not affected 
by the presence of such NS5A RAVs in baseline virus in genotype-1 infected patients in the ASTRAL-1 
study (discussed next section). In some cases effective re-treat options may be very limited, and 
SOF/VEL + RBV for a prolonged treatment duration of 24 weeks may therefore be a regimen that could be 
considered in such special cases in need of therapy. A proposal for wordings was given by the company, 
which is endorsed by the Rapporteurs. Of note, that regimen will be evaluated in an ongoing study 
(GS-US-342-1553). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
The clinical pharmacology data for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir FDC is considered acceptable. The CHMP 
recommended to investigate the mechanism based CYP inhibition caused by velpatasvir. The applicant 
has committed to undertake such investigation. In addition, the results from the already initiated study of 
investigating the responsible enzymes for the formation of the major metabolite M18 will be provided 
post-authorisation.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The dose of SOF was 400 mg in all studies. Supportive studies for SOF as single agent is not discussed in 
this report.  
SOF + VEL 25/100 mg +/- RBV was used in the phase 2 programme, while the fixed dose SOF/VEL 
(400/100 mg) was used in the four phase 3 studies. Dedicated studies were done for genotype 2 
(presently lacking a RBV-free regimen), genotype 3 (most problematic genotype with IFN-free regimens) 
and for the special population with decompensated cirrhosis. 
The total number of enrolled patients was 2603; 1302 in phase 3, 802 in phase 2 and 499 in phase 1.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
As a single-agent, the VEL PK/PD relationship for efficacy was examined in a Phase 1 study following 
administration of VEL monotherapy for 3 days to HCV infected subjects. Using PK and antiviral response 
data following VEL monotherapy, Emax modeling predicted VEL exposures at a 100-mg dose would 
achieve near maximal (99.5%) antiviral effect, and doses above 100 mg were considered unlikely to 
cause further meaningful reductions in HCV RNA.  
Phase 2 studies evaluated SOF 400 mg with VEL 25 mg or 100 mg + /-RBV for 8 or 12 weeks. High SVR12 
rates were achieved across all HCV genotypes in subjects receiving SOF 400 mg + VEL 100 mg for 12 
weeks.

Study 342-0102 included TN patients without cirrhosis, infected with genotype 1-6. The study showed 
clearly that 8 weeks of therapy is not sufficient (genotype 1 and 2 tested), regardless addition of ribavirin. 
With 12 weeks of SOF + VEL therapy there was no obvious difference in cure rates with VEL dosed 25 or

GS-US-342-0109 included hard to cure genotype-3 infected patients. All patients were treatment 
experienced (i.e. selected for negative predictive factors for cure) and half of them had cirrhosis. In this 
study the need for (at least) a 100 mg dose is clearer.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
ASTRAL-1 was placebo-controlled and blinded, while ASTRAL-2, -3 and -4 used active comparators and 
were of open-label design. In ASTRAL-1, -2 and -3 approximately 20% of patients could be treatment 
experienced and approximately 20% of patients could have compensated cirrhosis. ASTRAL-4 was 
conducted in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (CPT Class B). 
Main exclusion criteria 
 
 
Prior exposure to SOF or other nucleotide analogue HCV NS5B inhibitor or any HCV NS5A Inhibitor 
Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
Efficacy endpoints  
The following efficacy endpoints were common to all phase 3 studies: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR12, defined as HCV RNA <LLOQ 12 weeks after discontinuation of 
the study drug, in all randomized and treated subjects (FAS = the full analysis set). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
 
The proportion of subjects with: HCV RNA < LLOQ at 4 and 24 weeks after cessation of therapy 
(SVR4 and SVR24) 
 
The proportion of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ on treatment 
  HCV RNA change from Baseline/Day 1 
 
The proportion of subjects with virologic failure 
  Kinetics of circulating HCV RNA during treatment and after cessation of treatment 
 
Emergence of viral resistance to SOF and VEL during treatment and after cessation of treatment 
ASTRAL-1, -2 and -3 share the following additional features: 
Criteria used for cirrhosis determination:  
A. Cirrhosis was defined as any 1 of the following: 
 
 
 
Liver biopsy showing cirrhosis (eg, Metavir score = 4 or Ishak score ≥ 5) 
FibroTest® score > 0.75 and an AST : platelet ratio index (APRI) > 2 during screening 
Fibroscan® with a result of > 12.5 kPa 
B. Absence of cirrhosis was defined as any 1 of the following: 
 
 
 
Liver biopsy within 2 years of screening showing absence of cirrhosis 
FibroTest score ≤ 0.48 and APRI ≤ 1 performed during screening 
Fibroscan with a result of ≤ 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of baseline/Day 1 
In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by FibroTest/APRI using the 
above criteria, a liver biopsy or Fibroscan was required. Liver biopsy results superseded FibroTest/APRI or 
Fibroscan results and were considered definitive. 
Clinical hepatic decompensation (ie, ascites, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage) constituted an 
exclusion criterion. 
The following laboratory parameters had to be fulfilled at screening: 
Assessment report

Page 73/112 
 
 
  
  ALT and AST < 10 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
  Direct bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN 
 
Platelets > 50,000/microL 
  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 8.5% 
  Creatinine clearance (CLcr) > 60 mL /min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation 
  Hemoglobin > 11 g/dL for female subjects; > 12 g/dL for male subjects 
  Albumin > 3 g/dL 
 
International normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5 × ULN unless subject had known hemophilia or was 
stable on an anticoagulant regimen affecting INR 
GS-US-342-1138 (ASTRAL-1) - Study title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, 
Placebo-Controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Sofosbuvir/GS-5816 Fixed Dose 
Combination for 12 Weeks in Subjects with Chronic HCV 
Study participants  
Patients were to be enrolled across 81 study sites in the United States (US), Canada, Europe, and Asia and 
were to have chronic genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized in a 5:1 ratio in a double-blind manner to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups: 
1) SOF/VEL 12 Week group (Group 1): SOF/VEL FDC (400/100 mg) tablet once daily for 12 weeks 
2) Placebo 12 Week group (Group 2): SOF/VEL placebo tablet once daily for 12 weeks 
Patients were stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 4, 6, and indeterminate) infection and the presence or 
absence of cirrhosis at screening. Patients with genotype 5 HCV infection were not randomized but were 
enrolled into the SOF/VEL 12 Week group. 
Results 
In ASTRAL-1, 625 patients were randomized to the different treatment groups of which 624 were treated. 
Of these 622/624 patients completed study treatment. In practice all patients came to the follow-up visits 
(including 12 weeks post therapy). Randomization to the placebo group comprised 116 patients, all of 
whom received placebo.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the SOF/VEL and Placebo 12 
Week groups. The majority of subjects were male (59.7%), white (78.8%), and non-Hispanic/Latino 
(94.6%), with a mean age of 54 years (range: 18 to 82). The mean (SD) baseline body mass index (BMI) 
was 26.6 (4.93) kg/m2 and 21.4% of patients had a BMI ≥  30 kg/m2. Genotype 1, of which 2/3 of the 
patients had genotype 1a, dominated. The proportion of the cirrhotic subgroup varied between 10 and 
23% in different genotypes. Between 55 and 93% of patients were treatment naïve, depending on 
genotype. 
SVR12 rates were high and uniform across genotypes, irrespective of treatment experience, cirrhosis 
status or other baseline characteristics. All except 2 patients in the active groups who did not achieve 
SVR12 experienced virologic relapse.

Prevalence of NS5A/NS5B RAVs and Impact on Treatment Outcome  
Having results in mind, NS5A RAVs at baseline did not have a relevant impact on cure rates. Overall, a 
total of 257 of 616 patients (42%) in the Resistance Analysis Population had detectable (≥  1%) NS5A 
RAVs at baseline and 255 of 257 patients (99.2%) achieved SVR12.

to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Sofosbuvir/GS-5816 Fixed Dose Combination for 12 Weeks with 
Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin for 12 Weeks in Subjects with Chronic Genotype 2 HCV Infection 
Study participants  
Patients with chronic genotype 2 HCV infection were to be enrolled across 51 sites in the United States. 
Treatments 
Approximately 240 patients were randomized (1:1) to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups: 
  SOF/VEL 12 Week (Group 1): SOF/VEL FDC (400/100 mg) tablet once daily for 12 weeks 
  SOF+RBV 12 Week (Group 2): SOF (400 mg) tablet once daily + RBV (1000 or 1200 mg/day 
divided twice daily) tablets for 12 weeks 
Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis at screening and prior treatment 
experience (treatment naive versus [vs] treatment experienced). 
Results  
In ASTRAL-2, 269 patients were randomized and 266 were treated. All but two patients completed study 
treatment. In practice all patients came to the follow-up visits (including 12 weeks post therapy).  
Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across both treatment groups. 
Overall, the majority of patients were male (59.4%), white (88.3%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (79.3%),

with a mean age of 57 years (range: 23-81). The mean (SD) baseline body mass index (BMI) value for 
patients was 28.6 (6.08) kg/m2, and 32.7% of patients had a BMI > 30 kg/m2. 
Genotype 2b was predominant (78% of the patients). The cirrhotic subgroup constituted 14% of the 
patient population and approximately 15% of the patients were treatment naïve.

to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Sofosbuvir/GS-5816 Fixed Dose Combination for 12 Weeks with 
Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin for 24 Weeks in Subjects with Chronic Genotype 3 HCV Infection 
Study participants 
Patients with chronic genotype 3 infection were to be enrolled across 76 sites: 8 in Australia, 7 in Canada, 
11 in France, 9 in Germany, 2 in Italy, 2 in New Zealand, 11 in the United Kingdom, and 26 in the United 
States. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized (1:1) to 1 of the following 2 treatment groups: 
  SOF/VEL 12 Week group (Group 1): SOF/VEL fixed-dose combination (FDC) (400/100 mg) tablet 
once daily for 12 weeks 
  SOF+RBV 24 Week group (Group 2): SOF (400 mg) tablet once daily + RBV (1000 or 1200 
mg/day divided twice daily) tablets for 24 weeks 
Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis at screening and prior treatment 
experience (treatment-naive versus [vs] treatment-experienced). 
Results  
A total of 552 patients were randomized and treated. In the SOF/VEL group 275/277 completed study 
treatment, as compared to 254/275 in the SOF + RBV group. Two patients in the SOF/VEL group 
discontinued. All but one of the patients in the SOF/VEL group came to the follow-up visits (including 12 
weeks post therapy). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across both treatment groups. 
Overall, the majority of subjects were male (62.3%), white (88.6%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (95.8%), 
with a mean age of 50 years (range: 19-76). The majority of patients were from countries outside the US 
(78.3%). The mean (SD) baseline BMI value for patients was 26.5 (5.21) kg/m2, and 20.3% of patients 
had a BMI ≥  30 kg/m2. Subtype 3a dominated, comprising 96% of patients in the SOF/VEL group and 
91% in the SOF +RBV group. Thirty per cent of patients had cirrhosis and 26% were 
treatment-experienced.

In the subgroup with compensated cirrhosis, the mean (SD, Q1, Q3) baseline platelets were 145 (63.4, 
100, 179). The same values for albumin were 3.9 (0.39, 3.7, 4.2) and for Fibroscan 22.5 (11.81, 14.3, 
26.6).   
SOF/VEL 12 W is concluded to be superior to SOF + RBV 24W for the primary endpoint (Table 37).

Although numbers are limited, there seemed to be a trend towards an increased risk of relapse in patients 
with more severe (yet compensated cirrhosis); 4/25 in those with a scanning values >20 kPa versus 0/32 
in those with a value <20 kPa. This is to be expected, having results in ASTRAL-4 in mind.

This latter issue was raised during the procedure, where the company was asked to discuss the adequacy 
of adding ribavirin when treating genotype-3 infected patients with severe, yet compensated, cirrhosis, 
having uncertain re-treatment options in mind in case of treatment failure with sof/vel.  The company 
presented SVR12-data for those ASTRAL-3 patients who had a baseline Fibroscan value of >20 kPa 
(n=32). In summary, using Fibroscan values does not seem to be a valid decision tool for deciding what 
genotype-3 infected patients that may need the addition of ribavirin to minimize the risk for relapse.

It was also explored whether traditional parameters, s-albumin and thrombocytes, were useful predictors 
for the risk of relapse in cirrhotic patients who were treated with SOF/VEL in ASTRAL-3. That was not the 
case. Since ribavirin added considerably to the efficacy in genotype-3 infection in decompensated 
patients in ASTRAL-4 (discussed below), the Rapporteurs concluded that ribavirin should be considered 
also in the setting of compensated cirrhosis, in genotype-3 infection. 
Prevalence of NS5A RAVs and Impact on Treatment Outcome 
Overall, a total of 43 of 274 patients (16%) in the SOF/VEL 12 Week group with NS5A deep sequencing 
data had detectable (≥ 1%) NS5A RAVs at baseline.  
Baseline presence of the Y93H RAV had a clear impact on treatment outcome, in particular in cirrhotic 
patients (albeit based on small numbers).

Baseline NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome in the SOF/VEL group, while they appear to 
impact treatment with SOF/RBV (50% SVR12 in 8 patients with NS5B RAVS as compared to 86% in 
patients without). 
Virologic failures in the SOF/VEL group 
As previously discussed, the Y93H mutation was a universal finding at time of failure.

GS-US-342-1137 (ASTRAL-4) - Study Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Investigate 
the Efficacy and Safety of Sofosbuvir/GS-5816 Fixed-Dose Combination in Patients with Chronic HCV 
Infection and Child-Pugh Class B Cirrhosis 
Study participants 
Patients with chronic HCV infection (genotypes 1-6) were to be enrolled across 47 sites in the United 
States (US).  
Important inclusion criteria  
  Confirmation of cirrhosis by any 1 of the following methods: 
o 
Liver biopsy showing cirrhosis (eg, Metavir score = 4 or Ishak score ≥5) 
o  Fibroscan (in countries where locally approved) showing cirrhosis or results > 12.5 kPa 
o  FibroTest® score of > 0.75 
  Confirmed CPT class B (7−9) at screening 
  Additional criteria shared across all phase 3 studies are described in the beginning of Main study 
section in this document. 
Important exclusion criteria  
  Haematological and biochemical parameters, including the following: 
o  Haemoglobin < 10 g/dL 
o  Platelets ≤ 30,000/mm3 
o  ALT, AST, or ALP ≥ 10 x ULN 
o  Sodium < 125 mEq/L 
o  Total bilirubin > 5 mg/dL 
o  Creatinine clearance (CLcr) < 50 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

  Additional criteria shared across all phase 3 studies are described in the beginning of Section 3.4 
in this document. 
Treatments 
Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups: 
  SOF/VEL 12 Week group (Group 1): SOF/VEL FDC (400/100 mg) tablet once daily for 12 weeks 
  SOF/VEL+RBV 12 Week group (Group 2): SOF/VEL FDC tablet once daily + RBV (1000 or 1200 
mg/day divided twice daily) tablets for 12 weeks 
  SOF/VEL 24 Week group (Group 3): SOF/VEL FDC tablet once daily for 24 weeks 
Randomization was stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and indeterminate). 
Endpoints 
In addition to the endpoints described for the ASTRAL 1-3 studies, changes in CPT and MELD Scores 
constituted a secondary endpoint. 
Results 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced across all treatment groups. 
The majority of patients were male (69.7%), white (89.5%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (85.4%), with a 
mean age of 58 years (range: 40-73). The mean (SD) baseline BMI value for patients was 30.4 (6.74) 
kg/m2, and 42.3% of patients had a BMI > 30 kg/m2.

Despite their decompensated liver disease the vast majority of patients completed study treatment. Very 
few discontinuations were considered to be due to the study drugs.

Overall 12 weeks of therapy that included RBV yielded the highest cure rates. This was the case for 
genotype-1 infection, and in particular for genotype-3 infection. Hence, the addition of RBV had a clearly 
higher impact on efficacy (lowering the risk for relapse) than prolonging therapy of SOF/VEL to 24 weeks. 
Relapse in practice constituted the all virologic failures. 
Patients with genotypes 2 and 4 did well with all three regimens, however numbers are low and the data 
is only descriptive.

Changes in CPT stage and MELD score 
Over the treatment course CPT stage improved in around half of patients overall. This was mainly driven 
by decreased bilirubin and increased albumin values. Patients in the small subgroup with MELD scores of 
15 or more at baseline were most likely to experience MELD score improvements during the study period. 
Long-term impact on liver function will be followed in a registry study where all patients who achieved 
SVR12 are eligible. 
Although deterioration in liver function was rare, around 10% of patients who were cured in fact had a 
worsened CPT score or a MELD score increasing by 2 points or more, and a few patients experienced a 
considerable increase in MELD score, despite the cure. The Applicant was asked to provide further 
analyses on the latter patients.

Changes in MELD (based on creatinine, bilirubin, and INR) and CPT scores (albumin, bilirubin, INR, ascites 
and encephalopathy), scores that are predicative of survival in the untreated, were further discussed 
during the procedure.  Overall, scores generally improved or showed no change with the 24 weeks of 
follow-up that was available.  Improvement was mainly driven by a decrease in bilirubin (both scoring 
systems). Median albumin levels were also improved (CPT). During 24 weeks of follow-up improvement 
of INR and the clinical parameters (ascites and encephalopathy) was less marked (Table 47).

Prevalence of NS5A RAVs and Impact on Treatment Outcome 
In genotype 1 HCV-infected patients, the SVR12 rates in patients with or without pre-treatment RAVs 
were similar in the SOF/VEL+RBV 12 Week group, in contrast to the SOF/VEL 12 and 24 Week groups, 
where patients with baseline RAVs had lower SVR12 rates (80% and 90%) compared to patients without 
RAVS (96% and 98%), respectively.  
Interpretation of the results in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection is limited by the small number of 
patients with NS5A RAVs in each treatment group. In GT3 patients without baseline NS5A RAVs, SVR12 
rates were superior in the SOF/VEL/RBV group (91%) compared to the two SOF/VEL groups (60 and 50%, 
in the 12 and 24 week groups, respectively). 
All patients with genotype 2, 4, or 6 HCV infection achieved SVR12 irrespective of the presence of 
pre-treatment NS5A RAVs. 
Patients with Virologic Failure 
The majority of patients with virologic failure had genotype-3 infection and with the Y93H RAV detected 
posttreatment. None of the patients with virologic failure had pre-treatment NS5B RAVs.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program follows the established principles in terms of efficacy endpoints as well 
as inclusion and exclusion criteria. The phase 3 program comprised four clinical studies: ASTRAL-1, -2 
and -3 mainly included patients without cirrhosis, while approximately 20% of the participants had 
compensated cirrhosis. ASTRAL-4 was conducted in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.  
The predominant HCV genotypes are well represented in the overall patient population. For example, 
ASTRAL-3 is by far the largest study to date in patients with genotype 3. Still, some subgroup analyses 
are hampered by low numbers of patients, in particular those with several baseline predictors of virologic 
failure (commented below).  
Although the entry criteria used in the phase 3 studies are typical and accepted, the cirrhotic patients 
included in ASTRAL-1 – 3 may be considered to have fairly mild cirrhosis with modest baseline Fibroscan 
values in the majority of these patients. Consequently, patients with more severe (yet compensated) 
cirrhosis are in a way underrepresented in the study program. 
The study in decompensated patients with CPT class B cirrhosis (ASTRAL-4) therefore serves as an 
important point of reference. In this study, SOF/VEL (without ribavirin) for 12 weeks yielded high efficacy 
outcomes in these very sick patients – with genotypes other than 3. Hence, ASTRAL-4 can be considered 
support for efficacy in severe compensated cirrhosis. 
The choice of comparators for the individual studies is overall considered relevant.  
Overall, premature discontinuation of study treatment was rare, illustrating the excellent tolerability and 
safety profile of the study regimes. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis had slightly higher rates, but 
this should be considered a reflection of their severe disease state rather than related to the study drugs 
(see the section on clinical safety). 
Efficacy data in different genotypes 
Table 49 shows the proportion of patients who achieved SVR12 following treatment with SOF/VEL for 12 
weeks across all four phase 3 studies. For ASTRAL-4, both comparator arms are included. The 
recommended treatments for compensated and decompensated liver disease are highlighted.

GT1 is well represented in the clinical development program. SVR12 rates in patients without as well as 
with compensated cirrhosis are high, including in patients with multiple baseline predictors of virologic 
failure. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis receiving 12 weeks SOF/VEL had an increased risk of 
virologic failure (7.4%) compared to patients with less severe liver disease. The addition of RBV, in 
contrast to prolonged SOF/VEL therapy, minimized the risk for relapse.  
GT3 
Patients with GT3 represent the biggest remaining challenge for SOF/VEL treatment. Virologic failures in 
patients without cirrhosis were infrequent (2.0%) but increased to 8.8% in the group with compensated 
cirrhosis. The same pattern was seen for baseline NS5A RAVs (2.6 vs 11.6%), treatment experience (1.9 
vs 9.9%) and HCV ≥ 800,000 IU/ml (1.2 vs 5.2%). 
In patients with combinations of these predictors SVR12 rates were reduced proportionally to the number 
of predictors present. In patients with cirrhosis and the NS5A resistance-associated variant Y93H only 2/4 
achieved SVR12, in contrast to 19/21 of the non-cirrhotic subgroup carrying Y93H at baseline.  
A treatment failure would be considered particularly problematic in patients with cirrhosis (compensated 
cirrhosis included), since re-treatment options for genotrype-3 infected patients who failed therapy with 
SOF/VEL are not so clear at present. The Applicant was not able to find cut off values for Fibroscan values, 
or baseline albumin/thrombocytes that were predictive for relapse in patients with compensated cirrhosis 
(ASTRAL-3). The results in ASTRAL-4 therefore favour the addition of ribavirin also in patients with 
compensated cirrhosis (GT-3), as an approach to minimize the risk for relapse, in the present lack of 
randomized data. A study is planned where SOF/VEL +/- ribavirin will be given for 12 weeks to genotype 
3-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (GS-US-342-2097, with preliminary results are expected 
by the end of 2017). 
The relative vulnerability of genotype 3 is further pronounced in patients with CPT B decompensated 
cirrhosis (ASTRAL-4), where 6/14 (42.9%) GT3 patients in the SOF/VEL 12 week group experienced 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 88/112 
 
 
  
 
relapse. GT3 patients with baseline NS5A RAVs were few in all treatment groups (totally 6) but outcomes 
in these patients indicate as expected a further increased risk of failure. The addition of RBV improves 
results considerably, reducing virologic failures in patients with GT3 to 15.4% (2/13 patients). The latter 
finding justifies a discussion regarding the adequacy of adding ribavirin to SOF/VEL also in patients with 
compensated cirrhosis of the higher magnitude. 
The starting dose of RBV used in ASTRAL-4 was higher than used in previous studies with IFN-free 
regimens in decompensated patients. This is discussed in the section on clinical safety. 
When summarizing efficacy yielded in genotype-3 infected patients, it is reasonable to believe that the 
addition of RBV to patients with compensated cirrhosis would optimize results. This issue should be 
further discussed (LoQ, Efficacy). 
GT2, GT4, GT5, GT6 
Results in patients without as well as with compensated cirrhosis are excellent: This includes subgroups 
of patients with multiple baseline factors that historically have been associated with high risk of virologic 
failure. In decompensated cirrhosis, the small number of patients complicates assessment. However, the 
complete lack of virologic failures among patients with GT2 (n=12), GT-4 (n=8) and GT-6 (n=1), across 
all treatment groups, adds further support to the 100% cure rates in patients with compensated cirrhosis, 
(including patients with multiple baseline predictors of virologic failure). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
SOF/VEL treatment for 12 weeks is a highly effective therapy for chronic HCV patients with or without 
compensated cirrhosis across all genotypes. In patients with liver decompensation, SOF/VEL + RBV 
results in unprecedented high cure rates (overall 94.3%), and that is the recommended regimen for all 
such patients (i.e. for all genotypes).  
There is no clinical data for patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis, or for patients with a prior liver 
transplant; such studies are planned, with an expected start in second half of 2016. 
The remaining Achilles heel of 12 week SOF/VEL therapy concerns genotype-3 infected patients with 
negative predictors of cure (prior treatment experience and cirrhosis). Of note, there are limited 
re-treatment options for these patients, and a treatment failure in a cirrhotic patient should be considered 
a severe event. On the basis of available data, the CHMP recommended the addition of ribavirin in 
patients with compensated cirrhosis in genotype-3 infection.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
SOF/VEL 
A total of 2603 patients have received at least 1 dose of SOF/VEL or SOF+VEL, including 1302 patients in 
the phase 3 studies (ASTRAL 1 to 4), 802 patients in phase 2 studies, and 499 as part of phase 1. 
SOF 400 mg + VEL 100 mg (separate or as fixed dose) administered for at least 12 weeks was given to 
1539 patients, including 90 who received SOF/VEL for 24 weeks (ASTRAL 4), and 167 patients who 
received SOF/VEL+RBV for 12 weeks (ASTRAL-4 plus the phase 2 study GS US 342 0109), see Table 50. 
The phase 2/3 program included 325 patients with compensated cirrhosis (phase 2 + ASTRAL 1-3) and 
another 267 patients with decompensated cirrhosis (ASTRAL-4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 89/112 
 
 
  
The number of patients aged 65 years and above treated with SOF/VEL +/- RBV in the phase 3 studies 
(ASTRAL 1-4) was 156/1302 (12%). 
Of note, a substantial number of patients have been exposed to SOF, as part of Sovaldi (SOF, first 
approval December 2013) and Harvoni (SOF/ledipasvir, first approval October 2014). In addition to large 
scale phase 3 studies for both products, the estimated accumulated post marketing exposure to Sovaldi 
was 160.000-320.000 patients by June 2015 (on the basis of 24 or 12 weeks of therapy). The predicated 
post marketing exposure of Harvoni was around 24.000 patient-years by April 2015, equivalent to well 
over 50,000 patients treated, and likely more close to 100.000 patients.

The ASTRAL 1-3 studies compared SOF/VEL 400/100 mg (without RBV) to control regimens (placebo and 
SOF + RBV) in patients without cirrhosis and in patients with compensated cirrhosis. 
ASTRAL-4 concerns patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B). Child Pugh C patients and 
patients with a prior liver transplant were not included. On the basis of ASTRAL-4, the Applicant proposed 
that SOF/VEL + RBV 1000/1200 mg (arm 2 of the study) should be given to all patients with 
decompensated disease. Of note, this RBV starting dose is higher than that used in previous studies on 
patients with decompensated liver disease, where the RBV starting dose was 600 mg (Gilead´s 
SOLAR-1/2 studies and the ALLY-1 study of BMS).  
Adverse events 
There was no relevant difference in the frequency of reported AEs (all reported, or possibly related) in 
patients treated with SOF/VEL as compared to those treated with placebo in the ASTRAL 1-3 studies 
(Table 51).  
For patients treated with SOF + RBV, control regimen in ASTRAL 2 (12 weeks, n=132) and ASTRAL-3 (24 
weeks, n=275) a higher frequency of fatigue and anemia were the main differences as compared to the 
other regimens (SOF/VEL and placebo).

In ASTRAL 1-3 AEs of grade 3 were reported for a total of 3% of patients treated with SOF/VEL (n=1035). 
It concerned headache (0.5%), anxiety 0.3%, acute myocardial infarction 0.2%, and common AEs at a 
frequency of <0.1% each. 
Two patients (0.2%) in the SOF/VEL group had Grade 4 AEs (1 lung cancer, 1 who died in his sleep on 
posttreatment Day 8); both events were assessed as unrelated to study drug. 
In ASTRAL-4, a similar pattern of common AEs were seen in the decompensated patients treated with 
SOF/VEL. AEs of grade 3 and 4 were more common in this treatment population, and clearly linked to the 
severe liver disease status per se (Table 52). Grade 3/4 events were not more frequent with the 
RBV-containing regimen, than with SOF/VEL alone.

SAEs 
In ASTRAL 1-3 SAEs were reported in 2.2% (23 patients) in the SOF/VEL 12 Week group, none of which 
were assessed as related to study drug. The only SAEs reported for >1 patient treated with SOF/VEL 
concerned acute myocardial infarction in two patients, at days 10 and 24 days post treatment. Both 
patients had typical cardiovascular risk factors.   
Also in ASTRAL-4, in practice all serious adverse events were not considered related to study drug (Table 
53). One patient (03055-64017, SOF/VEL 24 weeks), experienced SAEs assessed as related to SOF/VEL 
by the investigator: this male patient had a prior history of varices, ascites, encephalopathy, and portal 
vein thrombosis. He experienced hepatorenal syndrome (Grade 4), peritonitis (Grade 3), sepsis (Grade 
4), and hypotension (Grade 4) on Day 35 leading to study drug discontinuation. At the time of event the 
MELD score was 38, and underwent a liver transplantation on posttreatment Day 8. He subsequently 
achieved SVR12.  
No other patient in ASTRAL-4 was transplanted during study or follow-up.

As mentioned in the efficacy section, around 10% of patients had a worsening of MELD/CPT score, despite 
curative therapy. A specific analysis, requested during the procedure, revealed no particular AEs 
suggestive of causality to therapy in these patients. 
Deaths 
In ASTRAL 1-3, three treatment-emergent and 3 non-treatment emergent deaths were reported, none 
consider related to therapy by the investigator. Two cases of treatment emergent deaths had no clear 
causative events; autopsies were not performed. Having the overall safety profile in mind, it is not likely 
that these deaths were related to therapy.

Adverse events of special interest  
Adverse events of interest were defined as AEs that have previously been associated with administration 
of nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors or other DAAs. 
Cardiac Safety 
Cardiac safety assessments included analysis of cardiac failure events, cardiac arrhythmia/bradycardia 
events, the effect of beta blockers and calcium-channel blockers on heart rate, and any safety events in 
patients with amiodarone use during treatment.  
Cardiac Failure 
No on-treatment events were reported in ASTRAL 1-3.  
Cardiac arrhythmias/bradycardia 
Four patients had cardiac arrhythmias/bradycardia events in the ASTRAL 1-3 studies: 3/1035 in the 
SOF/VEL 12 Week group and 1/132 in the SOF+RBV 12 Week group. The four adverse events observed 
were considered as non-related to SOF/VEL therapy and are summarised as follows: 
1) minimal QT increase,  
2) palpitations without ECG changes,  
3) asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in patient with prior history of arrhythmia, 
4) supraventricular tachycardia and sinus arrhythmia, in patient with severe ribavirin-induced anemia 
(Hb 53 g/L).  
Adverse Events by use of beta- and calcium channel blockers 
For all patients who received (A) a beta blocker, (B) a calcium-channel blocker with chronotropic effects 
(diltiazem or verapamil), or (C) neither at any time during the first 2 weeks of study treatment, an 
analysis was performed to identify patients with (1) any AE in the SOC of cardiac disorders and/or (2) the 
preferred terms of syncope and dizziness during that time.  
Of note, in ASTRAL-4 more than half (58%) of patients were on stable beta-blocker therapy when 
entering the study (evenly distributed between the three treatment arms). Only 3 patients were receiving 
a calcium channel blocker.  
No notable changes in vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse) were 
reported during the studies. No trends in electrocardiogram findings suggestive of cardiotoxicity were 
observed. 
No relevant findings were seen in those treated with betablockers/calcium-blockers; the frequency of AEs 
was similar in these patients as compared to the frequency in those without such drugs. The few cases 
reported concerned dizziness without relevant changes in the ECGs.  
The maximum on-treatment pulse decrease was fully similar for patients with betablockers and patients 
without any such drugs. Numbers treated with calcium channel blockers were too few for a meaningful 
assessment. Hence, for all groups (A-C), there were no meaningful changes in pulse rate or maximal 
decrease at any time. 
Amiodarone Use  
No patients in ASTRAL 1-4 received amiodarone during the study treatment period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 95/112 
 
 
  
One patient in the phase 2 received amiodarone prior to study treatment; SOF/VEL + RBV was started 3 
weeks later, without events and no meaningful changes in heart rate.  
Other Adverse Events of Interest 
No patients in the SOF/VEL 12 Week group experienced any of the “Other Events of Interest”: 
dermatologic events, pancytopenia (including aplastic anemia) events, psychiatric events relevant to 
suicide ideation or attempt, pancreatitis events, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy events, and renal failure 
events.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
SOF/VEL 
AEs that lead to discontinuation of SOF/VEL were very infrequent and not indicative for causality to the 
treatment regimens.   
In ASTRAL 1-3 only 2/1035 treated prematurely discontinued SOF/VEL for reasons of AEs: 
  Anxiety grade 3 on day 4. The AE resolved the same day; assessed as unrelated to study drug.  
  Difficulty concentrating, headache, and anxiety of grade 3, on day 1, resolved the following day.  
The patient had a medical history of depression, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
Assessed as related by the investigator. 
In ASTRAL-4, nine patients (3.3%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of all study drugs (Table 54). In 
one case this was consider as related to study drugs by the investigator (patient 03055-64017).

Table 54: AEs leading to premature discontinuation of all study drugs, ASTRAL-4. 
RBV dose reductions or discontinuations (ASTRAL-4) 
In ASTRAL-4, dose reductions of ribavirin in the SOF/VEL+RBV group were common; 32/87 (37%) 
lowered the dose (>3 days), mainly for reasons of anaemia (n=20) and 15/87 (17%) stopped ribavirin 
completely. 
As mentioned in the exposure section, the Applicant selected a standard weight based starting dose of 
RBV in ASTRAL-4 (1000/1200 mg/d), in contrast to the 600 mg starting dose used in previous studies in 
decompensated patients (SOLAR 1+2 studies by Gilead; ALLY-1 study by BMS). On the basis of ASTRAL-4 
(which excluded patients with Child Pugh C, and those with a prior transplant), the Applicant proposed 
that SOF/VEL + RBV 1000/1200 mg should be recommended to all patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
(including those populations not studied in ASTRAL-4). 
SOLAR-1 (SOF/ledipasvir + RBV 600 mg starting dose) included all aspects of decompensated liver 
disease (Child Pugh B/C, and transplant patients with decompensated disease). It should be noted that 
these patients are more vulnerable for RBV-associated anaemia and might have difficulties to keep even 
the 600 mg dose.  
Therefore the adequacy of a 1000/1200 mg starting dose of ribavirin for patients with CPT C cirrhosis, and 
for post-transplant patients with Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis, was further discussed during the procedure.  
The Applicant concluded that a 600 mg starting dose was a more reasonable option for these mentioned 
patients although not studied within the SOF/VEL program), which was endorsed by the CHMP.

Laboratory findings 
ASTRAL 1-3 
There were no meaningful changes from baseline in haematology parameters. A few cases of lowered 
white blood cells were seen in the active arms, none considered clinically important. 
The most common Grade 3-4 abnormalities for other blood chemistry for patients in the SOF/VEL 
12 Week group were elevated lipase, elevated serum glucose, and elevated creatine kinase. 
  All cases of lipase increases were asymptomatic and generally isolated or transient and 
intermittent; no cases of pancreatitis were reported. With regards the new drug, velpatasvir, 
there was no tendency for a dose dependent effect on lipase in the dose finding study in phase 2, 
comparing 25 and 100 mg dosing. 
  Out of 20 patients who had hyperglycaemia in the SOF/VEL group, 18 had diabetes mellitus and 
for the other 2 cases the increase was transient.  
 
The 8 cases of grade 3 or 4 CK increases in the SOF/VEL group were transient and related to 
exercise or physical exertion, according to the investigator, with no cases of rhabdomyolysis. 
There were no cases of unexplained increases of transaminases during therapy with SOF/VEL. 
ASTRAL-4 
As expected, abnormal lab chemistry values were more common in ASTRAL-4 reflecting the severe liver 
disease status (particularly low haemoglobin, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia).  
Amylase increases of grade 3-4 were seen in total 7 patients (2.7%), all asymptomatic (no cases of 
pancreatitis). One case of grade 4 CK increase was seen (<1%), following a surgical procedure where 
other drugs were given that were deemed the inciting factor.  
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
The proportion of female patients was around 40% in the ASTRAL 1-3 studies (405 females treated with 
SOF/VEL), and 30% of the patients in the ASTRAL-4 study. 
The incidence of overall AEs was slightly higher for female patients compared with male patients 
(primarily due to a higher incidence of nausea, headache, and asthenia) – for all regimens (SOF/VEL, 
placebo, sof + rbv). 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 AEs and SAEs was similar for males and females receiving SOF/VEL. 
Age 
The proportion of patients with an age >65 was 11% in ASTRAL 1-3 (n=123 treated with SOF/VEL), and 
12% in ASTRAL-4 (33 treated with SOF/VEL +/- RBV).  
Age >65 did not have any apparent relevant effect on the incidence of AEs, Grade 3 or 4 AEs or SAEs.  
Race 
The majority of patients in the SOF/VEL program were white. In ASTRAL 1-3 around 16% of patients were 
non-white, with 8.3% Asian (86 treated with SOF/VEL) and 5.9% black (61 treated with SOF/VEL) 
patients. 
Graded laboratory abnormalities for low neutrophils and elevated creatine kinase were more frequently 
seen in black patients than in white and “other” patients – for all regimens (SOF/VEL, placebo, SOF + 
RBV). 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 98/112 
 
 
  
Renal impairment 
The safety of SOF/VEL has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. A creatinine clearance <60 
ml/min was an exclusion criteria in ASTRAL 1-3 and <50 ml/min in ASTRAL-4 studies. The proportion of 
patients with a clearance <90 was around 25%, and a total of around 30 patients with a clearance <60 
has been treated. No apparent difference in overall AEs were not by degree of renal function in these 
patients 
The exposure of SOF and VEL has been studied in patients with renal impairment(as single agents).  
The exposure of VEL is not much affected by renal function, and this agent could be given also in the 
setting of severe renal impairment.  
However, the main metabolite of sofosbuvir increases markedly (several hundred-fold) in patients with 
severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of SOF administered at 200 or 400 mg are presently 
being evaluated in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis in Study 
GS-US-334-0154. The company is asked for any updates on this study in order to understand whether 
SOF/VEL (400/100 mg fixed dose) in fact may be used in patients with severe renal impairment. That is 
a population presently lacking optimal treatment alternatives (LoQ, Clinical Safety, other concern) 
At present, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir should not be given to patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 
ml/min. 
Severe hepatic impairment and liver transplant patients 
SOF/VEL has been studied in a large number of patients with decompensated Child Pugh B cirrhosis 
(ASTRAL-4), without any particular safety signals (previous pages).  
Data on safety in patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis is lacking. However, SOF has been studied in 
patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis, without safety issues, and VEL exposure was similar in patients 
without cirrhosis as compared to exposures in patients with Child Pugh B cirrhosis (ASTRAL 1-4 studies). 
Likewise similar levels were seen after single dose in health subjects with normal liver function as 
compared to levels in HCV-negative patients with Child pugh B and C cirrhosis.  
Hence, SOF/VEL 400/100 mg qd can be given to patients without regards to liver function. 
Liver transplant patients have not been studied. However, DDI studies with agents typically used were 
done; there is no need for dose adjustments during co-treatment with tacromilus. 
HIV/HCV co-infection 
Specific safety data in patients co-infected with HIV is presently pending. A Phase-3 study 
(GS-US-342-1202[ASTRAL-5]) is currently ongoing. 
The safety would not be expected to be different from that in HIV-negative patient, provided that drug 
interactions (antiretroviral therapy) are taken into account.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Within the study program, no new safety issues related to drug-drug interactions emerged. 
Other safety issues 
Recently there were some literature case reports on events of hepatitis B-reactivation during IFN-free hep 
C therapy (Colline et al, Ende et al, Takayama et al; all in 2015). Two cases concerned patients with occult 
hepatitis B (serology: HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive), normally regarded as having a “prior hep B 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 99/112 
 
 
  
infection” without a risk for reactivation with the exception of advanced immunosuppressive therapy 
where this is a well-known risk. Another two cases concerned pronounced re-activation of a previously 
silent hepatitis B co-infection (serology: HBsAg positive); a phenomenon that is well known from the past, 
subsequent to successful therapy with IFN-based therapy of such patients. These cases have triggered a 
PRAC investigation on hep B reactivation during therapy with the new hep C agents, since this issue has 
not been studied within the developmental program of any agents, SOF/VEL included. 
Hep B co-infection (HBsAg positive) was an exclusion criteria in the SOF/VEL program. However, patients 
with prior “occult” hepatitis B infection have likely been treated in high numbers, since around 30 % (or 
higher) of hepatitis C patients show markers for a prior hep B-infection (frequency varying by region and 
setting).   
Although there is no clear signal for HBV reactivation in the SOF/VEL studies, the company was asked to 
further discuss the issue, including providing any data available on HBV viral dynamics during HCV 
therapy in patients with HBV co-infection: 
The Applicant has recently presented a cumulative review in the issue within the latest Sovaldi PSUR 
(submitted Feb 2016). No SAEs suggestive of HBV reactivation have been observed in Gilead-sponsored 
clinical studies in which 12,157 subjects have been treated with a SOF-containing regimen. In the 
post-marketing setting there were 7 reported cases of HBV reactivation in the context of 191,533 patient 
years of exposure to SOF-containing regimens. Two of these cases involved HBV flares with associated 
elevations in liver laboratory tests; 1 of these cases involved fulminant hepatic flare in a patient with other 
risk factors for HBV reactivation. 
The Applicant had no data on the number of patients with “prior HBV infection” that were part of the 
SOF/VEL program (serology not analyzed during the studies). A small number of patients had a 
documented prior HBV-infection by medical history and safety data in these patients were not suggestive 
of any HBV-reactivation during study.  
Furthermore, results from a prior study with Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) undertaken in South East 
Asia were provided. None of 103 HCV-infected patients with prior HBV infection (documented HBsAg 
negative, HBcAb positive) showed any signs of HBV reactivation during therapy with Harvoni given for 12 
weeks, on the basis of transaminases (normalized during therapy, where in practice all patients were 
cured for the hep C infection).  
With regards HCV/HBV co-infection (HbsAg positive), the Applicant provided data from a small cohort of 
such treated with Harvoni in the ELECTRON-2 study (cohort 6), including HBV dynamics during therapy 
and follow-up. Patients were HBeAg-negative and without therapy for their HBV infection. All 8 patients 
were cured from the hepatitis C-infection. A modest increase in HBV-DNA levels were seen overall, but 
without any other signs of clinical HBV flare. Transaminases were improved, and there were no cases of 
grade 3/4 increases of liver enzymes.  
Although HBV-DNA increases were modest, in some cases these increases resulted in levels that would 
justify concomitant HBV therapy, as recommended in treatment guidelines.  
Gilead has also initiated Study GS-US-337-1655, an open-label study of LDV/SOF for 12 weeks in 100 
subjects with chronic genotype 1 or 2 HCV infection and HBV coinfection in Taiwan. The impact of effective 
HCV treatment on concurrent HBV infection and HBV disease progression will be evaluated throughout 
treatment and for a follow-up period of 2 years after treatment completion.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the clinical program for the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) around 1300 
patients were exposed to at least 12 weeks of SOF/VEL 400/100 mg as part of the phase 3, including 220 
patients with compensated cirrhosis (as part of ASTRAL 1-3 studies) and 267 patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis, Child Pugh B (ASTRAL-4). In the phase 2 studies another 800 patients were 
given SOF/VEL (400/25 mg and 400/100 mg) for 8-12 weeks.  
A favourable safety profile of SOF 400 mg is already well established; a substantial number of patients 
have been exposed as part of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir, first approval December 2013) and Harvoni 
(sofosbuvir/ledispasvir, first approval October 2014).  
The active substance VEL is not previously approved. Although VEL has not been studied as a single agent 
for the treatment of hepatitis C outside short term monotherapy studies, it is noted that VEL showed no 
particular signs of toxicity in pre-clinical studies (no target organ of toxicity found) apart from a possible 
risk of teratogenicity. That is in line with other agents of this class. 
The safety profile for SOF/VEL was unremarkable, with similar frequencies of adverse events (overall as 
well as possibly treatment-related) as compared to that seen with placebo (control in ASTRAL-1). The 3 
most commonly reported AEs being headache (20%), fatigue (15%), and nausea (10%).  
In ASTRAL 1-3 (patients with compensated liver disease) there was no patient reported to have had any 
serious adverse events related to therapy with SOF/VEL, out of 1035 treated. In these studies there were 
6 deaths (0.4%), none of which was considered related to therapy. No relevant adverse effects were seen 
on laboratory parameters. 
In ASTRAL-4, the same common AEs were seen in patients with decompensated Child Pugh B cirrhosis. 
Also in this population serious adverse events were not indicative for causal relationship to therapy. One 
patient out of the 267 treated worsened in liver function after a month of therapy, with a subsequent need 
for liver transplantation (and subsequently achieved SVR12). The event occurred during an episode of 
E-coli sepsis (with subsequent hepatorenal failure), which seems to be the triggering event.  
On the basis of efficacy and safety in ASTRAL-4 the company proposes that SOF/VEL should be given in 
combination with RBV 1000/1200 mg (for 12 weeks) to all patients with decompensated liver disease. 
That would include patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis and decompensated patients with a prior liver 
transplant; populations not studied in ASTRAL-4.  
That stands in contrast to what is recommended in the Harvoni SmPC, Gilead´s similar preceding product,  
which recommends SOF/ledipasvir + RBV 600 mg starting dose, on the basis of efficacy and safety from 
the SOLAR-studies, which included the full spectrum of decompensated patients, transplanted included.  
For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, SOF/VEL should be combined with ribavirin in order to 
maximize efficacy. The company proposes that the ribavirin starting dose should be 1000/1200 mg per 
day, in line with what was used in the ASTRAL-4 study. According to the present proposal, that dose would 
apply to all patients with decompensated cirrhosis, Child Pugh C-patients and also for those with a prior 
liver transplant.  Of note, such patients were not included in ASTRAL-4, and it is known from previous 
studies with similar regimens that the problems with ribavirin-associated anemia increases by disease 
severity, in particular in the setting of transplanted patients. In ASTRAL-4 (Child Pugh B, no transplanted 
patients) dose reductions and discontinuations of ribavirin were common, but manageable (37% and 
17%, respectively). In previous studies with similar regimens that included the full spectrum of 
decompensated cirrhotic patieints, such as the SOLAR-1 (Harvoni + Ribavirin), a 600 mg starting dose 
was used. It should be noted that these patients are more vulnerable for RBV-associated anaemia and 
might have difficulties to keep even the 600 mg dose. The adequacy of a 1000/1200 mg starting dose of 
ribavirin for patients with CPT C cirrhosis, and for post-transplant patients with Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis,

was further discussed during the procedure. The Applicant concluded that a 600 mg starting dose was a 
more reasonable option for these mentioned patients although not studied within the SOF/VEL program), 
which was endorsed by the CHMP. 
A number of AEs of special interest were followed, in particular cardiac safety having in mind a recently 
reported signal for arrhythmic events during therapy with sofosbuvir-based regimens in combination with 
amiodarone (mechanism unknown). No patient in the ASTRAL-4 studies used amiodarone, and of those 
patients on stable beta-blocker (58% in ASTRAL-4) or calcium blocker therapy (very few patients) no 
notable changes in vital signs or electrocardiogram findings suggestive of cardiotoxicity were observed. 
There was no arrythmic events or considered related to therapy, and no events of cardiac failure. 
HBV-reactivation during hep C therapy in patients with prior HBV-infection, or a silent non-treated HBV 
co-infection, is presently reviewed in an article 20 procedure. Within the SOF/VEL program there were no 
cases suggestive of such events in patients that, on the basis of epidemiological data, to a substantial part 
would have had a prior HBV infection. The Applicant provided limited data on HBV dynamics in HBV 
co-infected patients during and following therapy with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir. Although HBV-DNA 
increases were modest, in some cases these increases resulted in levels that would justify HBV therapy, 
according to acknowledged treatment guidelines. The CHMP considered that the results, despite the 
limited numbers, justify a recommendation in the SmPC for the monitoring of HBV DNA levels during and 
following therapy with SOF/VEL. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
SOF/VEL has been studied in a sufficient number of patients, including substantial numbers compensated 
and decompensated cirrhosis. The safety profile is indeed favourable, seemingly similar to that of 
placebo. 
For patients with decompensated cirrhosis SOF/VEL should be combined with ribavirin in order to 
maximize efficacy. The optimal RBV dose for that population with regards to anaemic complications, in 
particular for patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis and liver transplant patients, was discussed during the 
procedure and where the final proposal is endorsed (starting dose 1000/1200 mg in Child Pugh B without 
prior liver transplant; 600 mg in Child Pugh C without prior transplant and for patients with Child Pugh B 
or C post transplant). 
HBV-reactivation during hep C therapy in patients with prior hep B infection, or in those with a silent 
non-treated HBV co-infection, is presently reviewed as part of an article 20 procedure for all authorised 
DAAS. The data provided by the Applicant within this application does not warrant any specific warning for 
the former subset of patients. However, for patients with HBV co-infection a recommendation for 
HBV-DNA monitoring is considered justified as part of section 4.4 of the SmPC.

moderate and potent Pgp inducers 
that potent Pgp inducers (eg, rifampicin, rifabutin, St. 
John’s wort, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and

SOF/VEL, and that the use of such medicinal products 
with SOF/VEL is not recommended. The SmPC 
(Section 4.4) includes information that moderate Pgp 
inducers (e.g. oxcarbazepine, modafinil) are not 
recommended with SOF/VEL as they can reduce the 
plasma concentrations of SOF or VEL leading to reduced 
therapeutic effect of SOF/VEL.

The SmPC states that the safety and efficacy of SOF/VEL 
None 
in pediatric subjects have not been established and that 
SOF/VEL is not recommended for use in children and 
adolescents < 18 years of age (Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8) 
and that the PK of SOF, GS-331007 and VEL have not 
been established in children (Section 5.2). 
Safety in pregnant or breastfeeding 
The SmPC (Section 4.6) states that there are no or 
None

limited amount of data from the use use of SOF/VEL in 
pregnant women, that animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects for reproductive toxicity 
or fetal development, and that, as a preventive 
measure, use of SOF/VEL should be avoided during 
pregnancy. The SmPC also states that it is unknown 
whether sofosbuvir, its metabolites or velpatasvir are 
excreted in human milk, that available PK data in 
animals have shown excretion of velpatasvir and 
metabolites of sofosbuvir in milk, and that, a risk the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, 
SOF/VEL should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Safety in patients with HCV/HIV 
The SmPC section 4.4 provides warning on

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Harvoni. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has 
been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Epclusa (sofosbuvir / velpatasvir) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011 was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In patients with chronic HCV infection with or without compensated cirrhosis (ASTRAL 1-3 studies), 12 
weeks of SOF/VEL therapy yielded SVR (sustained virological response = viral clearance) in practically all 
patients, regardless of HCV genotype. The only exception concerned patients with genotype 3-infection 
Assessment report

and cirrhosis, where the SVR rate was slightly lower (around 90%). The company proposes that all 
patients with compensated cirrhosis, regardless of HCV genotype, should be given SOF/VEL for 12 weeks.  
For patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child Pugh B), the addition of ribavirin (i.e. SOF/VEL + RBV 
for 12 weeks) optimized SVR rates, in particular for patients with genotype-3 infection.  Although 
numbers are low, it is clear that ribavirin adds to the efficacy in patients with this genotype.  
The results in decompensated patients with the 12 week triple regimen are impressive across genotypes. 
As a consequence the recommendation for all patients with decompensated cirrhosis is SOF/VEL + RBV 
for 12 weeks.

For the vast majority of patients, the proposed treatment recommendations will lead to SVR. In 
genotype-3 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis it seems likely that the addition of RBV would 
further optimize results, in particular for those with more severe, yet compensated, cirrhosis.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Taking into consideration that the study population with compensated cirrhosis in the clinical 
development program represents fairly mild cirrhosis, it could be anticipated that outcomes with SOF/VEL 
for 12 weeks in patients with more pronounced (but still compensated) liver disease might be slightly 
lower. One might assume that the addition of RBV to SOF/VEL treatment would maximize SVR for these 
patients, in particular in the case of genotype-3 infection.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Exposure data, both in terms of total numbers of patients (n=2603) as well as coverage of genotypes and 
patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, is sufficient for the regulatory safety evaluation 
in the context of establishing a positive benefit/risk balance. A favourable safety profile of sofosbuvir (400 
mg) is already well established; a substantial number of patients have been exposed as part of Sovaldi 
(sofosbuvir, first approval December 2013) and Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledispasvir, first approval October 
2014). 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 109/112 
 
 
  
 
 
SOF/VEL is well tolerated and the emerging safety profile is similar to placebo, with comparable 
frequencies of adverse events (overall as well as possibly treatment-related). 
The most important unfavorable effect was relapse after therapy with SOF/VEL in certain subgroups of 
hard-to-treat patients, i.e. patients with genotype 3 and cirrhosis, since NS5A resistance (Y93H mutation) 
is a universal finding in these cases. That resistance, with a substantial impact on the activity of all agents 
of this class, has been shown to persist long term and is presently considered an obstacle with regard to 
highly effective re-treatment options. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Virologic failure in patients with genotype 3 and decompensated or severe compensated cirrhosis 
constitutes an important adverse event which presently leaves these seriously ill patients with no clear 
effective options for retreatment. The full impact of this is unknown. 
For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, SOF/VEL should be combined with ribavirin in order to 
maximize efficacy. The Applicant initially proposed that the ribavirin starting dose should be 1000/1200 
mg per day, in line with what was used in the ASTRAL-4 study, for all patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis (CPC and post transplants included). This was further discussed during the procedure and where 
the final proposal is endorsed (starting dose 1000/1200 mg in Child Pugh B without prior liver transplant; 
600 mg in Child Pugh C without prior transplant and for patients with Child Pugh B or C post transplant). 
HBV-reactivation during HCV therapy in patients with prior hep B infection, or in those with a silent 
non-treated HBV co-infection, is presently reviewed as part of an article 20 procedure. The data 
presented by the company within this application does not warrant any specific warning for the former 
subset of patients. However, for patients with HBV co-infection a recommendation for HBV-DNA 
monitoring is considered justified as part of section 4.4 of the SmPC.

further increased in 
patients after liver

did not include patients 
with Child Pugh C, or those 
with a prior liver

RBV dose is likely too high 
for certain groups of 
decompensated patients.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
SVR marks the clearance of HCV infection, and has been associated with a decrease risk of cirrhosis, 
decompensation, cancer, and liver-related deaths. The adverse effect profile of SOF/VEL does not stand 
out as different from placebo.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Treatment outcomes with SOF/VEL in patients without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis as well as 
with SOF/VEL/RBV in patients with decompensated cirrhosis represent unprecedented SVR rates in 
chronic HCV infection.  
The emerging safety profile is very favourable and the recommended treatment combinations will be 
suitable for the majority of patients with chronic HCV infection. 
Virologic failures mainly occurred in already hard to treat patients (genotype-3 infected patients with 
cirrhosis) leaving unclear re-treatment options. However, the risk of treatment failure is most likely 
lowered by the addition of ribavirin to SOF/VEL for genotype-3 infected patients with compensated 
cirrhosis as well as those with decompensated cirrhosis. The recommendations of triple therapy in these 
patient populations are reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Epclusa in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
Assessment report  
EMA/399285/2016 
Page 111/112 
 
 
  
 
 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP considers 
that velpatasvir is qualified as a new active substance.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is very common and generally acquired early in life, with the majority of the 
adult population being CMV-seropositive in most countries. Similar to other herpesviruses, acute infection is 
generally followed by latent (dormant) infection. Among individuals with intact immune systems, reactivation 
of  CMV 
infection 
is  uncommon  and 
is  generally  asymptomatic.  However,  CMV  reactivation 
in 
immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. 
Annually, approximately 27,000 allogeneic HSCTs are performed worldwide (Gratwohl 2015): in 2014 around 
16,000 such transplants were performed in 47 European countries (Passweg 2014).  Globally, the number of 
allogeneic HSCTs has increased yearly (Gratwohl 2015). 
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplant  (HSCT)  recipients  are  immune-compromised,  which  increases 
the  risk  for  CMV  infection,  mostly  due  to  reactivation  of  latent  CMV  infection.  Hematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant  recipients  with  prior  CMV  infection  (R+)  are  at  highest  risk  for  developing  CMV  reactivation, 
especially  during  the  first  100  days  post-transplant  (Özdemir  2007).  Some  20-35%  of  this  population 
progress to CMV disease in the absence of preventive measures (Ljungman 2011).   
The clinical effects of CMV infection can be divided into direct and indirect effects. Direct effects include the 
spectrum of CMV disease manifestations. CMV colitis is the most common clinical presentation of CMV disease 
in  the  allogeneic  HSCT  population.  While  pneumonitis  is  the  most  serious  manifestation,  it  has  become 
relatively  infrequent  with  current  preventative  strategies.  Other  rare  manifestations  of  CMV  disease  include 
hepatitis,  retinitis,  and  encephalitis.    The  indirect  effects  of  CMV  infection  include  increased  risk  of 
opportunistic  bacterial  and  invasive  fungal  infections,  graft-versus-host  disease  (GVHD),  and  non-relapse 
mortality. 
All  currently  available  anti-CMV  agents,  whether  used  for  prophylaxis  or  pre-emptive  therapy  (PET),  are 
nucleoside analogues with target related toxicities such as myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The most widely 
used  agents,  ganciclovir  (GCV)  and  valganciclovir  (VGCV),  are  associated  with  myelotoxicity,  which  is 
particularly  problematic  in  the  HSCT  setting.  Due  to  concerns  of  the  toxicities  associated  with  anti-CMV 
agents,  PET  is  currently  the  preferred  preventive  approach  in  the  majority  of  centres  worldwide,  especially 
during  the  first  100  days  post-transplant.  However,  CMV  viremia  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of 
overall mortality even after adjustment for PET (Green 2016). 
Considering the challenges for PET as well as the toxicities associated with current anti-CMV agents, there is 
a role for an effective and well-tolerated antiviral agent for the prevention of CMV reactivation and disease in 
allogeneic HSCT recipients. 
About the product 
Letermovir is a novel anti-CMV agent. Virological characterization and sequence analysis of resistant viruses 
indicate that the viral terminase complex is the target of this compound. Unlike currently marketed anti-CMV 
drugs,  which  act  via  inhibition  of  the  viral  DNA  polymerase,  terminase  inhibitors  interfere  with  viral  DNA 
maturation  and  packaging  of  monomeric  genome  units.  Consequently,  cross-resistance  is  not  expected 
between letermovir and currently approved medicines for the treatment of CMV infection. There is no known 
mammalian counterpart of the viral terminase complex.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be  of  major  public  health  interest.  This  was  based  on  a  conclusion  that  this  medicinal  product  is  likely  to 
address  an  unmet  medical  need,  and  is  of  major  interest  from  the  point  of  view  of  public  health. 
Furthermore, it was considered to represent a major therapeutic innovation. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue accelerated 
assessment, as there were pending issues related to the quality development of the product that could not be 
solved within the timeframe of accelerated assessment. The applicant was required to prepare a plan to 
further evaluate and develop a terminal sterilisation process for the product.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 9/124 
 
  
Figure 1: Structure of letermovir 
The molecular structure of letermovir has been confirmed by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and single 
crystal x-ray crystallography. 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder, slightly hygroscopic, very slightly soluble in water and 
very soluble in acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylacetamide, ethanol and 2-propanol. 
Letermovir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Letermovir is the S-form. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for letermovir. No crystalline forms or solvates have been identified. 
The active substance obtained using the proposed route of synthesis is an amorphous form. 
The applicant provided relevant information on the investigation of structural features of the proposed active 
substance when compared to known active substances marketed in EU. Based on the presented information, 
the CHMP considers that letermovir can be qualified as a new active substance.   
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Letermovir is synthesized in six main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specification.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of ICH Q8 and Q11 such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies. Attributes and 
parameters were categorised as either critical or noncritical, based on their impact to product quality. Where 
a quality attribute was been designated as critical (CQA), associated elements of the control strategy were 
elaborated. The applicant did not propose any design space for the process.  
Critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified through an assessment of the extent to which their 
variation over established ranges can impact the quality of the active substance (which included 
considerations of scientific first principles, quality risk management, prior knowledge, appropriate 
experimentation and in-process controls).  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced during development have been presented in sufficient detail and 
have been justified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 10/124 
 
  
 
Detailed comparative physico-chemical investigations, structural elucidation, in-process data, batch analysis 
data and stability data on active substance from both synthetic routes demonstrated that the changes in the 
route of synthesis did not have a significant impact on the quality of the product. The quality of the active 
substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced 
by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene (LDPE) liners with desiccant in an outer containment 
of  a  high  density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  drum  which  complies  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), chiral 
purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), sulfated ash/residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), 
identification (IR), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial enumeration test (Ph. Eur.). 
The choice of specification parameters and acceptance criteria have been adequately justified in accordance 
with the relevant EU and ICH guidelines. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
(non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data ( commercial route/scale and development batches) of the active substance are provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturerstored 
in the intended commercial package under long term conditions at 25ºC / 60% RH and under accelerated 
conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: identification (IR and XRPD), description, assay, water, impurities and 
chiral purity. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All 
tested parameters were within the specifications. 
During the procedure the applicant also provided data up to 3 months under long term conditions at 25ºC / 
60% RH, on a further four recent batches manufactured with different routes of synthesis. All tested 
parameters were within the specifications. The results confirmed that the changes in manufacturing process 
did not have an impact on the quality of the product. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Letermovir has been 
exposed to acidic, basic, oxidative, thermal and photolytic stress conditions to induce the formation of 
potential degradation products and demonstrate the stability indicating nature of the analytical procedures.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container at the proposed 
storage conditions.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
A. Film-coated Tablets 
A. Film-coated Tablets 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Letermovir tablets are formulated as an immediate-release, film-coated tablet for oral administration. The 
two strengths, 240 mg and 480 mg, are weight multiples of a common granulate. The tablets are packaged 
in Polyamide/Aluminium/PVC – Aluminium blisters.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Letermovir exhibits pH dependent solubility. Letermovir is classified as a BCS class II compound by the 
applicant (low solubility, high permeability).  The ranges of particle size have been determined to yield 
product which reproducibly meets all intermediate and finished product specifications, including blend 
uniformity, tablet content uniformity, and dissolution performance. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) was defined as an oral immediate release solid dosage form containing 240 mg or 480 mg of 
letermovir, providing adequate bioavailability to maintain desired plasma levels and consistency in oral 
absorption (e.g. lack of food effect), all impurities controlled in line with ICH or qualified levels and packaged 
to provide a shelf life of at least 2 years.  
The formulation and manufacturing development for the commercial product / process have been evaluated 
through the use of risk assessment, prior knowledge and design of experiments to identify the critical product 
quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). A risk analysis was performed using the 
failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters 
that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the 
prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The CQAs and CPPs have 
been adequately identified. The understanding resulting from this development has been used to establish a 
control strategy consisting of proven acceptable ranges (PARs), design space and in-process controls. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is Polyamide/Aluminium/PVC – Aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps:  
1.  Blending & Lubrication,  
2.  Roller Compaction and Milling,  
3.  Lubrication,  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 12/124 
 
  
4.  Compression,  
5.  Film Coating & Wax Polishing.  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches fully support the proposed design space and PARs. The in-process controls for compression and 
primary packaging are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The manufacturing process will be validated at the registered batch size prior to 
commercialisation. A prospective validation protocol describing these planned studies has been provided. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; description, 
identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (HPLC) and microbial quality (Ph. Eur.)  
The choice of specification parameters and acceptance criteria have been adequately justified in accordance 
with the relevant EU and ICH guidelines. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for full scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 full scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
18  months  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  finished  product  are  identical  to  those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  microbial  testing  and  water 
activity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes were observed in any 
tested parameters. 
One  batch  of  each  tablet  strength  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Photo exposure of the samples shows no significant change in 
assay degradation products, or dissolution compared to the control sample.  
Stability  of  the  film  coated  tablets  in  bulk  containers  was  also  evaluated.  Based  on  the  stability  results 
obtained a 12 month hold time period was supported. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  30  months  and  “Store  in  original  package  to 
protect from moisture” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

B. Concentrate for solution for infusion  
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product Letermovir is supplied as a 20 mg/mL colourless aqueous concentrate for solution for 
infusion in 30 mL Type I glass vials and is supplied in two presentations, containing either 240 mg/vial or 480 
mg/vial. The concentrate for solution for infusion contains 240 mg or 480 mg of letermovir as active 
substance.  Other ingredients are: hydroxypropylbetadex, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide (E524), water 
for injections. 
The finished product is intended for single-use after dilution. Accompanying dilution solvent is not supplied 
with the finished product. The solvents to be used for dilution are sodium chloride and dextrose which both 
are readily available in EU. 
Letermovir is an intravenous formulation that has been developed to meet the need for treatment of patients 
who are not able to swallow the letermovir oral tablet. The development of the finished product has been 
described, the choice of excipients justified and their functions explained. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements, although no design space is 
claimed. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a liquid concentrate for intravenous 
infusion, containing 240 mg or 480 mg of letermovir, for once daily dosing, all impurities controlled in line 
with ICH or qualified levels, sterility and bacterial endotoxins controlled per compendial requirements and 
acceptable injection site tolerability.  
The formulation and manufacturing development for the commercial product / process have been evaluated 
through the use of risk assessment, prior knowledge and design of experiments to identify the critical product 
quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). A risk analysis was performed using the 
failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters 
that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the 
prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The CQAs and CPPs have 
been adequately identified. 
In line with the Decision trees for the selection of sterilisation methods (CPMP/QWP/054/98), terminal 
sterilisation is preferred to sterilisation by filtration and/or aseptic treatment because it is lethal to the 
microorganisms and a reliable sterility assurance level (SAL) is possible to calculate, validate and control, and 
thus incorporates a safety margin. For sterile filtration followed by aseptic treatment this is not applicable as 
accidental contamination caused by inadequate technique cannot be reliably eliminated by monitoring, 
control or validation. Therefore, terminal sterilisation provides the highest assurance of sterility and should be 
used whenever possible.  
The applicant selected sterile filtration in combination with aseptic processing as studies of potential terminal 
sterilization cycles showed physical and chemical changes to the formulation at some combinations of 
autoclave time/temperature. The applicant presented a proposal to further evaluate, develop and implement 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 14/124 
 
  
a terminal sterilisation method as a post-approval commitment. In light of the overall positive benefit/risk 
balance of the product, the CHMP agreed that the applicant’s justification for the use of sterile filtration in 
combination with aseptic processing instead of terminal sterilisation could be accepted provided that, that in 
order to optimise the sterility assurance level (SAL) of the manufacturing process, the applicant performs a 
number of post-authorisation measures to further develop, validate and introduce a terminal sterilisation 
process for the product. These measures have been clearly outlined by the applicant in a stepwise approach 
in a Post Approval Change Management Protocol.  
The primary packaging is Type I (30 ml) clear glass vial with a 20 mm fluorocoated chlorobutyl stopper with 
aluminium flip-off cap containing 12 mL (medium green cap) or 24 mL (dark blue cap) of solution. The 
material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Information related to the manufacturers of the packaging components well as sterilisation site for the same 
have been presented. At the time of Opinion, the CHMP, noting the EMA Quality Q&A which states that “In 
the absence of GMP certification or confirmation that the component is a CE-marked Class Is medical device, 
certification that the sterilisation process has been conducted and validated in accordance with the relevant 
ISO standards should be provided”, recommends that the applicant should submit a report from an external 
auditor showing compliance of the sterilisation site with the ISO audit criteria for sterilisation of stoppers 
(ISO-17665-1 and ISO-17665-2) and arrange for the validation of sterilisation of stoppers to be included 
within the scope of the upcoming EU GMP inspection of the finished product manufacturing site.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The commercial manufacturing process consists of the following steps:  
1.  Weighing and dispensing active substance and excipients 
2.  Formulation of final formulated bulk (FFB) in vessel 
3.  Sterile filtration 
4.  Aseptic filling and sealing. 
Based  on  the  risk  assessments  and  evaluation  of  the  relationships  between  the  process  and  Critical  Quality 
Attributes (CQAs) performed throughout development. No design space is claimed. Proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs) have been defined for a number of finished product manufacturing steps. The available development 
data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the 
proposed PARs. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. During 
the  procedure  the  applicant  amended  the  proposed  holding  times  and  maximum  processing  times  and 
introduced additional in-process bioburden tests.  
The  main  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  investigated  in  a  number  of  development  batches 
and one production scale batch of each presentation. The proposed manufacturing process would normally be 
considered  non-standard  as  per  Annex  II  of  EU  “Guideline  on  process  validation  for  finished  products  – 
information  and  data  to  be  provided  in  regulatory  submissions”  however  the  applicant  considers  that  the 
process  can  be  considered  to  be  a  standard  process  based  on  the  extensive  manufacturing  knowledge  and 
experience  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  site.  Based  on  the  information  provided,  the  applicant’s 
justification  to  consider  it  to  be  a  standard  process  was  accepted.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 15/124 
 
  
manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible 
manner. The manufacturing process will be validated at the registered batch size prior to commercialisation. 
A prospective validation protocol describing these planned studies has been provided. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and stability specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; 
description,  visible  particulates  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products 
(HPLC),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  sub-visible  particles  (Ph.  Eur.),  volume  of injection  in container  (Ph.  Eur.),  container 
closure integrity (dye ingress by UV), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.).  
The choice of specification parameters and acceptance criteria have been adequately justified in accordance 
with the relevant EU and ICH guidelines. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 full scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
18  months  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  finished  product  are  identical  to  those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  visible  particles,  assay,  degradation  products,  pH,  osmolality,  sub-
visible particles, container closure integrity, sterility and bacterial endotoxins. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating.  
An in-use stability study was carried out by simulating in-use practice for patient delivery in IV infusion bag 
solutions of dextrose and saline. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours 
at 25 °C and for 48 hours at 2 to 8 °C. 
One batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results indicated that the light exposed sample shows no significant 
change in assay, degradation products, osmolality, pH or particulate matter, however the color of the solution 
was observed to darken slightly upon exposure to light. Therefore the product will be labeled to store in the 
original carton to protect from light. 
Additional studies on leachable compounds, temperature excursion and freeze thaw were also performed. No 
significant changes were observed in any tested parameters. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months when stored in the original carton to 
protect  from  light  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  (section  6.3)  are  acceptable.  The  product  should  be  used 
immediately after opening. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility  of  the  user  and  would  normally  not  be  longer than  24  hours  at  2  to  8 °C,  unless  dilution  has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

Adventitious agents 
Hydroxypropylbetadex is manufactured from starch using an enzyme of microbiological origin. In the 
fermentation process to produce this enzyme, a casein-hydrolysate is used. There is no concern about BSE 
for this product. Confirmation has been given that other excipients used are non-animal and non-human 
origin, hence no TSE/BSE risk.   
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished products has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The control applied to the active substance and the finished product, along with the controls over the 
manufacturing process of the active substance and the finished products, support the view that the products 
can be routinely manufactured to conform to the current expectations for this type of dosage form. 
Furthermore, the stability data submitted supports that both the active substance and the finished products 
will remain of the appropriate quality when stored as recommended storage conditions.  
Concerning  the  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  while  sterile  filtration  in  combination  with  aseptic 
processing  is  considered  sufficient  to  ensure  a  positive  benefit-risk  balance,  with  a  low  risk  of  residual 
contamination, in line with the Decision trees for the selection of sterilisation methods (CPMP/QWP/054/98), 
terminal sterilization is the state of the art method with respect to ensuring no microbial contamination, and 
should  be  used  whenever  possible.  The  measures  proposed  by  the  applicant  to  develop,  validate  and 
introduce  a  terminal  sterilisation  process  should  be  implemented  post-approval.  Documentation  confirming 
compliance of the rubber stopper sterilisation site with the ISO audit criteria for sterilisation of stoppers will 
be provided by the applicant as a post-authorisation measure. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of these products are considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
The CHMP has identified the following measures necessary to address the identified quality developments 
issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the concentrate for solution for 
infusion: 
• 
In order to optimise the sterility assurance level (SAL) of the manufacturing process, the marketing 
authorisation holder should implement the measures outlined in the Post Approval Change 
Management Protocol (PACMP), agreed with the CHMP, concerning development, validation and 
introduction of terminal sterilisation.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Assessment report

• 
The applicant should submit a report from an external auditor showing compliance of the chlorobutyl 
stoppers manufacturer with the ISO audit criteria for sterilisation of stoppers (ISO-17665-1 and ISO-
17665-2) and arrange for the validation of sterilisation of stoppers to be included within the scope of 
the upcoming EU GMP inspection of the finished product manufacturing site. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action 
Letermovir  has  activity  (single-digit  nanomolar  EC50  values)  against  laboratory  and  clinical  CMV  isolates  in 
cell-culture  models  of  infection.  Characterization  of  DNA  processing,  virion  maturation,  and  viral  resistance 
mutations in CMV-infected, letermovir-treated cells implicate CMV DNA terminase as the target of letermovir. 
The process of cleaving concatameric DNA and packaging unit-length genomes into viral capsids is absent in 
uninfected cells and there are no human homologs of the CMV DNA terminase complex proteins. The mode of 
action  of  letermovir  is  distinct  from  that  of  already  approved  anti-CMV  agents  that  target  CMV  DNA 
replication.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Please refer to section on clinical pharmacodynamics. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Early  in  the  development  of  letermovir,  preliminary  studies  in  cell  culture  were  performed  to  assess  the 
potential  for  cellular  cytotoxicity  (CC).    These  experiments  were  conducted  with  mouse,  rat  and  human  cell 
lines  including  epithelial  cells  derived  from  liver  and  kidney,  heart  muscle  cells,  fibroblasts  derived  from 
embryos  and  dermis,  monocytes,  T-lymphocytes,  macrophages,  and  neuroblastoma  and  hepatoma  cells.  
Values for 50% effect in the cell proliferation assay (CC50) ranged from 27 ± 1.0 µM to > 30 µM, which was 
the highest concentration of letermovir tested. 
Letermovir was analysed in 63 radioligand-binding assays to evaluate potential off-target effects (interaction 
with mammalian receptors and enzymes).  None of the results met the criteria for a significant effect at the 
concentration tested (10 µM). 
Letermovir at a final concentration of 30 µM (0.1% DMSO) did not exhibit significant activity (≥ 50% change) 
in the following tissue assays:

Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed in both in vitro and in vivo test systems to assess the potential 
cardiovascular,  respiratory,  and  neurobehavioral  effects  of  letermovir.  In  addition,  renal  function,  lipid 
metabolism,  haematology  parameters,  blood  glucose  concentrations,  gastrointestinal  motility  were  also 
investigated following administration of letermovir.  
The  Cmax  values  in  the  phase  3  study  in  HSCT  patients  ranged  from  2,549  ng/mL  to  21,570 ng/mL.  The 
highest  Cmax  value  of  21,570  ng/mL  was  used  to  provide  the  most  conservative  estimate  of  exposure 
margins. 
Cardiovascular Function 
In  the  functional  patch-clamp  electrophysiology  study,  letermovir  inhibited  hERG  current  with  an  IC50  of 
67 µM (~38,360 µg/L).  Taking into account that the hERG assay is conducted in absence of protein and that 
letermovir  is  98.7%  protein  bound  in  humans,  the  IKr  IC50  is  ~137X  the  unbound  Cmax  in  HSCT  patients 
(approximately 280 ng/mL at an IV dose of 480 mg). 
To  evaluate  the  effect  of  letermovir  on  QT/QTc  interval,  a  surrogate  for  assessment  of  ventricular 
repolarization,  an  anesthetized  dog  telemetry  study  was  conducted.  There  were  no  QT/QTc  effects  and  no 
changes  in  any  ECG  parameters  in  anesthetized  dogs  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested  (45 mg/kg  given 
intraduodenally).  In  conscious  dogs  up to the  highest  oral  dose  tested, 10 mg/kg,  letermovir  was  devoid  of 
any  effects  on  cardiovascular  function,  ECG  evaluations,  respiratory  function,  and  acid/base-status  and 
plasma electrolytes. There was  no pharmacokinetic evaluation in the study performed in conscious animals.  
In anesthetized dogs, the Cmax at the highest dose tested, 45 mg/kg, was 6886 ng/mL (<1-fold the Cmax in 
HSCT patients). Additionally, there were no ECG changes in the 13-week repeat-dose oral studies in monkeys 
at a Cmax of 16,780 ng/mL, which represents ~1-fold the Cmax in HSCT patients. Of note, in a QTc clinical 
study, IV administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 960 mg (Cmax of 68000 ng/mL) did not result in QTc 
prolongation in healthy volunteers. Based on these data, it is unlikely that hERG-blockade mediated delayed 
ventricular repolarization will occur at clinically relevant exposures. 
In  conclusion,  letermovir  had  no  impact  on  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  in  anesthetized  dogs  up  to  the 
highest  dose  tested,  45 mg/kg  given  intraduodenally  and  in  conscious  dogs  up  to  the  highest  oral  dose 
tested,  10 mg/kg  (Cmax  of  6886  ng/mL  at  45  mg/kg  in  dogs;  <1-fold  the  Cmax  in  HSCT  patients),  and  in 
repeat-dose  oral  toxicity  study  in  monkeys  up  to  the  Cmax  of  16,780 ng/mL  (~1-fold  the  Cmax  in  HSCT 
patients). 
Respiratory Function 
Letermovir  had  no  impact  on  respiratory  function  in  anesthetized  dogs  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested, 
45 mg/kg given intraduodenally (Cmax of 6886 µg/L; <1-fold the Cmax in HSCT patients).  Additionally, there 
were no clinical signs indicative of respiratory concern in the repeat-dose studies in rats and monkeys up to 
the highest doses tested (sexes-combined Cmax in monkeys of 249,687 ng/mL on Week 4 of repeat-dose IV 
toxicity  study  in  monkeys,  ~11-fold  the  Cmax  in  HSCT  patients;  mean  Cmax  value  in  male  rats  of 
272,011 ng/mL, ~12-fold the Cmax in HSCT patients). 
Nervous System Function 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 19/124 
 
  
Letermovir  had  no  impact  of  concern  on  neurobehavioral  parameters  in  a  central  nervous  function  study 
conducted  at  single  doses  up  to  45 mg/kg  in  rats.  There  was  no  pharmacokinetic  evaluation  in  this  study. 
There was no evidence of effects on the nervous function in repeat-dose studies in rats and monkeys up to 
the  highest  doses  tested  (Cmax  in  monkeys  of  249,687  ng/mL,  ~11-fold  the  Cmax  in  HSCT  patients;  Cmax  in 
rats of 272,011 ng/mL, ~12-fold the C max in HSCT patients). 
Additional studies 
Additionally, letermovir had no impact on blood parameters, lipid metabolism and blood glucose levels up to 
45  mg/kg.  In  another  rat  study,  up  to  a  dose  of  45 mg/kg,  letermovir  had  no  impact  on  urine  volume  and 
excretion of potassium and chloride, but there was a dose dependent increase in sodium. 
Conclusion on safety pharmacology 
There  were  no  letermovir-related  effects  of  concern  on  cardiovascular,  nervous  system,  and  respiratory 
functions observed in well characterized safety pharmacology experimental models. However, due to the low 
exposure margins to patients in the majority of the preformed dedicated in vivo safety pharmacology studies 
the  actual  risk  cannot,  with  confidence,  be  extracted  from  the  generated  data.  Consequently,  any  effect  on 
safety pharmacology parameters at supra-therapeutic exposure cannot be ruled out. However in light of the 
data from the clinical QTc study, in which IV administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 960 mg (Cmax of 
68000 ng/mL)  did  not  result  in  QTc  prolongation  in  healthy  volunteers  the  risk  for  delayed  ventricular 
repolarization  is  considered  low.  It  can  also  be  concluded  that,  due  to  the  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  in  the 
animals, the animals were exposed up to MTD in these studies.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Letermovir was evaluated for antiviral activity in pairwise combinations with the anti-CMV agents GCV, CDV, 
FOS and acyclovir. Using two mathematically techniques for analysis, the combination of letermovir with each 
drug was additive, with no evidence of antagonism. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Plasma  concentrations  for  the  evaluation  of  the  PK/ADME  (non-GLP  pharmacokinetic  experiments)  of 
letermovir  were  determined  by  LC/MS/MS  using  Turbo  Ion  Spray  in  positive  ion  mode,  following  protein 
precipitation.    For  toxicokinetic  studies,  plasma  concentrations  of  letermovir  were  determined by  LC/MS/MS 
methods  validated  in  accordance  with  GLP.  Radioactivity  was  determined  by  direct  liquid  scintillation, 
counting  of  samples  or  the  HPLC  eluent  was  analysed  for  14C-content  by  accelerator  mass  spectrometry. 
Metabolite  structures  were  proposed  using  mass  spectrometry  and  in  the  case  of  the  acyl-glucuronide  M7, 
authenticated using a synthetic standard.  
Absorption 
Following  IV  administration  to  Wistar  rat  and  Rhesus  monkey, 
letermovir  exhibited  non-linear 
pharmacokinetics,  which  is  consistent  with  saturation  of  its  elimination  pathways,  resulting  in  greater  than 
dose  proportional  increase  in  exposure.    At  the  lowest  IV  doses  tested  (0.3 mg/kg  in  rat  and  0.1  mg/kg  in 
monkey),  the  mean  plasma  clearance  (CLp)  was  35.8 mL/(min∙kg)  and  17.3  mL/(min∙kg),  the  steady  state 
volume of distribution (Vdss) was 3.01 L/kg and 1.30 L/kg, and the elimination half-life (t½) was 3.3 hr and 
4.9 hr in rat and monkey, respectively.  At the lowest oral dose (1 mg/kg), the bioavailability of letermovir 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 20/124 
 
  
was  55%  in  rat  and  14%  in  monkey.    Based  on  studies  in  bile-duct  cannulated  rats  dosed  at  3 mg/kg,  the 
fraction absorbed was estimated to be 83%. 
Distribution 
The  tissue  distribution  of  letermovir  was  assessed  in  Wistar  rats,  Long  Evans  rats  and  pregnant  Sprague 
Dawley  rats  by  QWBA  following  a  single  oral  dose  of  [14C]letermovir.    In  addition,  quantitative  whole  body 
autoradiography was performed in male Wistar rats after a single IV dose of [14C]letermovir.   
The  distribution  pattern  of  letermovir  across  Wistar,  Sprague  Dawley  and  Long  Evans  rats  was  similar.  
Letermovir was rapidly and widely distributed in tissues and highest levels of radioactivity were observed in 
the  gastrointestinal  tract,  bile  duct  and  liver  independent  of  the  route  of  administration.    Low  levels  of 
radioactivity  in  the  brain  suggested  that  letermovir  does  not  readily  cross  the  blood-brain-barrier    In  the 
pigmented rat, the radioactivity in eye tissues was at the level of background after 24 hours, suggesting that 
letermovir-related  radioactivity  does  not  bind  to  melanin.  Elimination  of  radioactivity  was  nearly  complete 
from most tissues by 72 hours post-dose.   
In pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats, the highest concentration of radioactivity was identified in uterus, clitoris, 
gastrointestinal  tract,  bile  duct  and  liver.  Letermovir  was  observed  in  foetal  tissues,  suggesting  that 
letermovir can cross the placental barrier.   
Letermovir  was  extensively  bound  to  plasma  protein  with  minimal  differences  in  percent  unbound  across 
nonclinical species and human (percent unbound: 2.38% in mouse, 2.19% in rat, 2.12% in rabbit, 0.73% in 
dog,  1.84%  in  Rhesus  monkey,  4.05%  in  Cynomolgus  monkey,  and  1.33%  in  human.  Letermovir  does  not 
partition preferentially into the blood cellular compartment in animals (rat, dog, Rhesus monkey) or humans. 
Metabolism 
The  in  vitro  biotransformation  of  [14C]letermovir  was  investigated  in  NADPH-fortified  liver  microsomes  from 
CD-1 mouse, NMRI mouse, Wistar rat, Himalayan rabbit, Beagle dog, Rhesus monkey, and human as well as 
in  plated  hepatocytes  from  CD-1  mouse,  Wistar  Hannover  rat,  Himalayan  rabbit,  Beagle  dog,  Cynomolgus 
monkey and human.   
In vitro, [14C]letermovir showed low metabolic turnover following incubation with liver microsomes or plated 
hepatocytes  across  all  species.    A  total  of  eight  oxidative  metabolites  were  observed  in  liver  microsomes.  
The metabolism resulted from hydroxylation (M1, M2), O-dealkylation (M3, M4, M5, M6, M11) and oxidative 
desaturation (M14).  In hepatocytes, glucuronidation of letermovir was the major route of metabolism in all 
species,  including  human,  forming  M7,  M8,  and  M9.    An  additional  acyl-glucuronide  metabolite  M10  was 
observed in incubations with recombinant UGT isoforms.  Several minor oxidative metabolites were observed, 
of which M11, an N-dealkylation metabolite, was observed in all species except rabbit.  Additional metabolites 
observed  only  in  hepatocyte  incubations  from  preclinical  species  were  derived  either  from  oxidation  or  a 
combination of oxidation and glucuronidation or methylation.  All human metabolites were observed in liver 
preparations from the safety species. 
The  in  vivo  metabolism  of  [14C]letermovir  was  studied  in  bile  duct-cannulated  and  intact  rats  (and  in 
humans).  In  rats,  independent  of  the  route  of  administration,  letermovir  represented  the  majority  of 
drug-related  radioactivity  circulating  in  rat  plasma  accounting  for  ~70%  of  the  total  plasma  AUC.  
Additionally, an oxidative metabolite (M5) was a circulating constituent of the plasma radioactivity accounting 
for ~25% of the total plasma AUC. Oxidative demethylation of the 2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethylphenyl moiety 
followed  by  an  intramolecular  nucleophilic  substitution  of  the  3-methoxyphenyl-piperazinyl  moiety  is  the 
proposed mechanism for the formation of M5.

In the human ADME study, letermovir was the major circulating constituent in human plasma, accounting for 
96.6%  of  total  drug  related  material.    The  remaining  radioactivity  of  3.4%  belonged  to  three  structurally 
uncharacterized  metabolites.  The  oxidative  metabolite  M5,  found  to  circulate  in  rats,  was  not  observed  in 
human plasma.  
Excretion 
The  excretion  of  letermovir  was  studied  in  Wistar  rats  and  Rhesus  monkeys,  as  well  as  in  humans.  In  all 
species,  biliary/faecal  excretion  was  the  predominant  elimination  route,  while  renal  elimination  was 
negligible. 
In rats, a combination of biliary excretion and metabolism via glucuronidation and oxidation were the major 
routes  of  elimination  for  letermovir.    In  Rhesus  monkeys,  the  majority  of  radioactivity  was  recovered  in 
faeces (86.9%) with a minimal amount recovered in urine (4.06%).  
In  the  human  ADME  study,  letermovir-related  radioactivity  was  primarily  eliminated  via  the  biliary/faecal 
route  and  was  recovered  in  the  faeces  as  parent  drug  (~70%  of  dose),  an  acyl-glucuronide  (~6%  of  dose, 
M7) and four metabolites (~4% each) of unknown chemical transformation. 
Following  oral  administration  of  letermovir  to  lactating  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  letermovir  was  shown  to  be 
secreted into milk at Day 10 postpartum.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The pivotal toxicity studies were performed in rat and monkey, in which the animals were dosed either orally 
or intravenously for up to 39 weeks.   
Rat and Cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main non-clinical species based on the in vitro and in vivo 
metabolic  profiles  and  based  on  the  demonstration  of  satisfactory  pharmacokinetics  in  these  species.  The 
Applicant´s  justification  is  considered  acceptable  by  CHMP  and  consequently  the  data  generated  in  these 
species is regarded as relevant.  
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies have been performed, however in light of the data generated in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, the relevance of the data collected in these studies has some limitations. In short, mortality 
was observed after a 2000 mg/kg oral dose in rats and a 200 mg/kg IV dose in rats and mice. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Morbidity and mortality 
In  the  14-day  monkey  study,  one  female  and  one  male  from  the  high-dose  group  (500  mg/kg)  were 
euthanized  on  day  14  and  12,  respectively.  The  kidneys  of  the  male  and  female  had  moderate,  multifocal 
degeneration/regeneration of tubules in the cortex and medulla. Tubules were lined by acidophilic, sloughing 
cells or plump basophilic regenerating cells. Many affected tubules contained granular casts of epithelial cells 
and/or  neutrophils.  In  addition,  the  transitional  cell  epithelium  lining  the  pelvis  had  many  vacuolated  or 
sloughed  cells.  It  is  unclear  to  what  extent  letermovir  was  the  actual  cause  of  death  in  these  two  animals. 
One female in the high-dose group (300/250 mg/kg) in the 13 week study  was terminated on day 21 after 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 22/124 
 
  
cessation  of  dosing  on  day  18,  since  the  health  status  did  not  improve.  There  were  no  macroscopic  or 
microscopic findings in this animal and no cause of death was established.     
Clinical observations  
Clinical observations made in exposed animals included transient post dose mouth rubbing in high-dose (250 
mg/kg)  mice,  increased  water  consumption  in  high-dose  (180  mg/kg)  rats,  salivation,  mouth  rubbing  and 
limb  paddling  immediately  after  dosing  in  rats  dosed  ≥50  mg/kg.  Additional  clinical  observations  in  rat  i.v. 
dosed included decreased activity, laboured breathing, mouth rubbing, and swollen tails at 100 mg/kg.   
In  monkeys  orally  administered  100  mg/kg  the  animals  displayed  abnormal  faeces  (soft  or  liquid)  and 
salivation. Salivation was also observed after i.v. administration of 100 mg/kg.  
Body weight and food consumption  
Decreased body weight gain and decreased food consumption was observed in all tested species. In mouse, 
males  exposed  to  100  mg/kg  had  a  decreased  body  weight  gain  of  23%  at  the  end  of  the  13  week  study. 
Also in male rats dosed 180 mg/kg had a 13% decrease in body weight gain after 13 weeks. In the prolonged 
26 weeks study in rat body weight gain was decreased in females at all doses (-7.4%, -5.7% and -5.3% at 
17, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively). In the same study the male body weight gain was decreased at all 
dose  levels  (-6%  and  -11%  at  50  mg/kg/day  and  150  mg/kg/day,  respectively).  These  findings  were 
resolved in the 4 week treatment-free period. No changes in these parameters were observed in rat after i.v. 
administration.     
In monkey there was a progressive loss of body weight in both males and females dosed 500 mg/kg for 14 
days.  This  signal  was  also  detected  in  the  prolonged  studies  in  this  species  and  in  the  39-week  study  body 
weight  gain  was  slightly  less  than  that  of  the  controls  (males  gained  7.8  or  16%  less  weight  and  females 
gained  20  or  9.0%  less  weight,  respectively).  No  changes  in  these  parameters  were  observed  in  monkey 
after i.v. administration.     
Haematology 
Several haematological parameters were affected in all species after letermovir exposure. The most extensive 
data  on  this  aspect  were  generated  in  the  13-week  rat  study.  In  this  high-dose  (180  mg/kg)  study, 
decreased haematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were observed in both sexes (up to -7% and -
6%, respectively) and decreases in haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) were observed in 
females  only  (-5%  and  -4%,  respectively).  These  findings  showed  partial  reversibility  at  the  end  of  the  4 
week treatment-free period. In the same dose-group there was an increase in CD45 low cells, B cells (Pan B) 
and antigen presenting cells (I-a) in both sexes as well as in T-helper cells (CD4 total from CD4/CD8 double 
labelling),  CD45total  cells  and  splenic  cell  counts  in  females.  Also  at  the  lower  dose  (60  mg/kg)  letermovir 
increased  leukocyte  and  monocyte  counts,  CD45low  cells,  T-helper  cells  (CD4total)  and  T-helper  cells 
(CD4total from CD4/CD8 double labelling) in females.   
In  monkeys  exposed  to  300/250  mg/kg  a  decrease  in  erythrocytes,  haemoglobin,  and  haematocrit  were 
observed  in  males  (7%)  and  females  (8,  6,  and  6%,  respectively).  These  findings  were  reversible  after 
recovery.  After  i.v.  administration  to  monkey  at  all  doses  (≥10  mg/kg)  an  increase  in  absolute  reticulocyte 
counts  in  females  (up  to  2-fold  at  100  mg/kg)  and  an  increase  white  blood  cell  counts  in  males  (1.2-fold) 
were  observed.  In  the  same  study  there  was  an  increase  reticulocyte  counts  in  females  (up  to  2.4-fold)  at 
≥30 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg an increase in reticulocyte counts in males (up to 2.8-fold), red cell and platelet 
distribution  (minimally  increased)  in  females  (up  to  1.2-fold),  and  lymphocytes  (1.3  fold,  males  only)  was 
detected.

Clinical chemistry 
In both mouse and rat, letermovir induced changes in several clinical chemistry parameters. These changes 
were  observed  in  mid-  and  high-dosed  animal  groups.  In  mouse  these  changed  were  observed  for  ALT 
(+50% at 100 mg/kg), AST (+87% at 250 mg/kg), globulin (+18% at 250 mg/kg), bilirubin (+43% in 250 
mg/kg), albumin (-9% at 250 mg/kg), albumin/globulin ratio (-19% at 250 mg/kg), potassium (-20% at 250 
mg/kg) in females, creatinine (-25% at 250 mg/kg), cholesterol (-56% at 250 mg/kg) in males. 
In the rat 4-week study there was a decrease in creatinine excretion, triglycerides, cholesterol, albumin and 
an  increase  in  alkaline  phosphatase  and  bilirubin  in  animals  dosed  180  mg/kg.  In  the  extended  13-week, 
animals  dosed  ≥60  mg/kg  were  recorded  to  have  a  decrease  in  in  ALT  (up  to  -27%)  and  glutamine 
dehydrogenase  (up  to  -58%)  in  males,  decreases  in  cholesterol  (up  to  -44%),  triglycerides  (up  to  -60%), 
proteins (up to -7%) and in albumin (up to -5%). At the same time the animals showed an increase in ALP 
(+41%)  in  females,  total  bilirubin  (up  to  3.6-fold),  T4  (with  no  increases  in  T3  or  thyroid  stimulating 
hormone) in females dosed at 180 mg/kg/day. 
In  monkey  an  increase  in  ALT  was  also  detected  in  both  sexes  dosed  300/250  mg/kg  for  13  weeks.  This 
signal showed reversibility after 4-weeks of recovery. Also in the 39-week monkey study at 250/200 mg/kg 
there was in decrease in cholesterol in treated females (up to 11% compared to pre-test). This was reversible 
after  recovery.  In  monkeys  administered  ≥10  mg/kg  letermovir  i.v.  there  was  a  slight  decrease  in  gamma 
glutamyl transferase across all male groups (0.93 to 0.61-fold) and in all female groups (0.87 to 0.67-fold) 
and in total bilirubin (males only). In the ≥30 mg/kg there was a decrease in total bilirubin (females only) up 
to 0.6-fold.  
Macroscopic observations 
In the mid-dose (60 mg/kg) rat dosed for 13-weeks there was an increased liver weights in females at and in 
both  sexes  at  180  mg/kg/day.  In  addition,  the  male  from  the  high-dose  group  (180mg/kg)  a  decreased 
testes  and  epididymitis  weigh  was  observed  which  was  still  present  after  4  weeks  of  recovery.  Also  in  rats 
administered letermovir i.v. soft and/or small appearance of the testes and small epididymis was noted.  
In monkey, there was an increase in testes/epididymides weights, adjusted to overall body weight, in males 
at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day by 2.5, 1.5 and 2.0-fold, respectively, when compared to controls. The above 
change was not dose-related in degree and was without any histopathological correlates.  
Microscopic observations 
Liver  
Mouse 
In  mice  dosed  250  mg/kg  for  13-weeks  hepatocyte  vacuolation  characterized  by  enlarged,  usually 
centrilobular,  hepatocytes  containing  microvacuoles  sometimes  coalescing  to  macrovacuoles  was  detected. 
Also  at  lower  doses  (≥  40  mg/kg)  centrilobular  hypertrophy  associated  with  increased  liver  weights  was 
recorded. 
Rat 
In  rat  dosed  180  mg/kg  for  13-weeks  minimal  liver  cell  hypertrophy,  changes  in  the  pattern  of  lobular  fat 
deposition in males was seen at the end of dosing. However, this was not observed after recovery.

Kidney 
As indicated above, euthanized monkeys displayed changes to the kidneys.  
Testis 
A  general  finding  in  rat  includes  testicular  toxicity.  Already  in  animals  dosed  180  mg/kg  for  4  weeks  a 
minimal to slight spermatic exfoliation in the seminiferous tubules, minimal spermatic retention and increased 
vacuolation  of  the  tubular  epithelium  were  seen  in  testes  and  a  minimal  to  slight  spermatic  debris  and 
minimal  oligospermia  were  seen  in  the  epididymides.  In  the  longer  studies  testicular  toxicity  was  also 
observed.  These  data  show  testicular  degeneration  and  changes  of  the  epididymal  sperm  content 
(oligospermia,  increased  spermatic  debris)  in  animals  dosed  180  mg/kg  for  13  weeks  and  after  4  weeks  of 
recovery  residuals  of  degeneration  (vacuoles)  were  still  present  in  the  testes  while  the  epididymides 
appeared normal after the recovery time. 
Rats  administered  letermovir  intravenously  (100  mg/kg)  showed  minimal  or  slight  germ  cell  degeneration, 
spermatid  retention  and  an  increased  incidence  and  severity  of  tubular  cell  vacuolation  in  the  testes, 
accompanied  by  oligospermia  and  cell  debris  in  the  epididymis,  which  correlated  with  the  decrease  in 
testes/epididymis  weights  that  were  noted  at  necropsy.  This  signal  was  not  recovered  after  2  weeks,  since 
germ cell degeneration and slight increased levels of tubular cell vacuolation were still present in the testes of 
previously  treated  males.  In  addition,  tubular  atrophy  of  testis  and  oligospermia/cellular  debris  in  the 
epididymis was observed.  
This testicular toxicity has influenced the reproductive toxicity program for letermovir and has also resulted in 
specific SmPC labelling (see reproduction toxicity below). 
Genotoxicity 
Letermovir  was  found  to  be  non-mutagenic  and  non-genotoxic  in  a  battery  of  in  vitro  or  in  vivo  studies 
carried  out  according  to  ICH  guidances  that  included  a  microbial  mutagenesis  assay,  a  chromosomal 
aberration assay, and an in vivo assay for micronucleus induction in mouse bone marrow.  The top dose was 
the limit dose which was limited by cytotoxicity in the in vitro genetic toxicity studies, or was the maximum 
tolerated  dose  in  the  in  vivo  genetic  toxicity  study  in  mice.  Systemic  exposure  to  letermovir  has  been 
determined in mice after oral dosing. The IP route was used in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay 
in  mice  with  letermovir.  The  exposure  following  IP  administration  is  expected  to  be  similar  or  higher  than 
following oral administration. The highest dose in the mouse in vivo micronucleus study was 48 mg/kg/day, 
given for 2 days to male mice. At 40 mg/kg/day in the repeat dose oral study in mice, the exposure (AUC0-
24hr) on Day 1 study was 295,100 ng.hr/ml in males, which exceeds the highest human exposure of 99,960 
ng.hr/ml at the 480 mg IV dose (exposure margin ~3X). 
Carcinogenicity 
There were no carcinogenicity studies presented. The lack of carcinogenicity studies is deemed acceptable by 
CHMP, considering the limited clinical use (100 days). However, should the clinical use be extended beyond 6 
months the applicant should consider performing carcinogenicity studies according to the relevant guidelines.    
Reproduction and Developmental Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Assessment report

Fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  was  assessed  in  rats.  As  discussed  above,  repeat  dosing  with 
letermovir  induced  alterations  in  the  rat  testis  such  as  vacuolation  of  the  germinal  epithelium,  germ  cell 
exfoliation, tubular atrophy and damage to Sertoli-cells at doses ≥180 mg/kg/day.  In the male fertility study 
in  rats  (TT#16-7150),  effects  on  male  fertility  were  observed  at  180  mg/kg/day  (~2.3-fold  the  exposure  in 
HSCT  recipients),  were  associated  with  toxicity  on  male  reproductive  organs  including  impaired  sperm 
quality, and were likely secondary to this toxicity.  There was no male reproductive organ toxicity and there 
were no changes in male fertility at ≤60 mg/kg/day (~1-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients). Overall, the 
fertility and early embryonic development studies did not indicate any effects of letermovir on female fertility 
up to the highest dose tested, 240 mg/kg/day (~5-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients).  
In  addition,  in  a  study  investigating  thoroughly  the  male  reproductive  organs  and  the  potential  effects  on  
male fertility (which included electron microscopy examination of the testes, evaluation of Inhibin B plasma 
concentrations  and  potential  reversibility  of  male  reproductive  changes)  it  was  shown  that  the  testicular 
toxicity:  
•  was characterized by degenerating germ cells and degenerating Sertoli cells in seminiferous tubules 
with  impaired  spermatogenesis  but  also  in  tubules  with  normal  spermatogenesis  which  correlated 
with a marked decrease in Inhibin B plasma concentrations; 
•  was not reversible after a 15-week treatment-free period in rats previously dosed with letermovir for 
15 weeks.   
To thoroughly investigate any potential effects of letermovir on male reproductive organs in monkeys, a 13-
week oral male fertility study in Cynomolgus monkeys with an 8-week recovery phase was conducted (TT # 
11-7863).    A  set  of  investigations  of  male  reproductive  organs  and  male  hormones  was  completed  on  the 
main  study  as  well  as  in  recovery  animals.    Oral  dosing  of  sexually  mature  non-human  primates  (60  to 
240 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks) did not induce any alterations of the male reproductive system.  Therefore, the 
NOAEL  for  effects  on  male  reproductive  tissues  was  ≥240 mg/kg/day  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys,  which 
corresponds to a systemic exposure of 211,000 ng⋅h/mL (~2-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients). 
Importantly, there were no male reproductive organ changes and no changes in any male sexual hormones, 
including Inhibin B, in Cynomolgus monkeys administered letermovir up to 250/200 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks 
(approximately  2-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients),  and  no  male  reproductive  toxicity  in  mice 
administered  letermovir  up  to  250 mg/kg/day  (~3.5-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients)  for  13  weeks. 
There  were  no  male  reproductive  organ  changes  noted  in  the  embryo-foetal  developmental  studies  in  rats 
(high  dose:  250 mg/kg/day)  and  rabbits  (high  dose:  225 mg/kg/day),  in  the  pre-  and  postnatal 
developmental study in rats (high dose: 180 mg/kg/day) and in a 2-week juvenile toxicity study conducted in 
rats  of  14-day  age  at  study  start  (high  dose:  250 mg/kg/day).    Based  on  these  nonclinical  results, 
biomarkers of testicular toxicity including luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone and 
Inhibin B were evaluated in HSCT patients dosed with letermovir at 480 mg or 240 mg (in patients on CsA) in 
the phase 3 clinical study.  There was no evidence of letermovir-induced changes in these biomarkers in this 
clinical  study.    The  applicant  concluded  that  the  lack  of  findings  in  the  male  reproductive  system  following 
letermovir dosing in monkeys and mice and the lack of changes in biomarkers of testicular toxicity in Phase 3 
clinical study is suggestive that testicular findings in rats are specific for this species and letermovir may not 
modulate spermatogenesis in humans.  
The  CHMP  agrees  with  the  applicant  that  the  testicular  toxicity  may  be  rat  specific,  and  with  no  risk  for 
toxicity in humans. However, no mechanistic explanation is available, showing why this toxicity is only seen 
in  rats  and  not  in  other  species  (humans  included).  Further,  the  patient  population  in  the  present  phase  3 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 26/124 
 
  
study  cannot  be  considered  the  best  suitable  to  rule  out  this  toxicity  for  several  reasons  (prior  treatment, 
baseline values etc.). Therefore the issue of testicular toxicity should be closely monitored. Also, since no rat-
specific mechanism has been presented, the SmPC and labelling of Prevymis on this issue reflect actual data 
and is non-speculative, i.e. any reference to a possible rat-specific mechanism was removed from the SmPC. 
However, in relation to the indication (HSCT) the issue of potential irreversible testis toxicity is of somewhat 
less  importance  when  considering  the  pre-conditioning  regiment  (cytostatic  drugs  and  radiation)  applied 
before  transplantation  which  virtually  makes  every  patient  sterile.  Nevertheless,  it  is  not  unlikely  that 
letermovir may be tested in other indications, for instance solid organ transplantation, where patients are not 
co-  or  pre-treated  with  medicines  which  impact  the  fertility.  In  such  cases  the  relevance  of  the  data 
generated in rat is of high importance to male patients. Consequently, this issue will be re-scrutinized in any 
upcoming  extension  of  indication  applications  holding  patients  which  are  not  pre-  or  co-treated  with 
medicines  known  to  decrease  fertility.  The  above  reasoning  can  also  be  applied  to  the  issue  of  a  SmPC-
recommendation  for  semen  conservation  (which  is  more  or  less  standard  for  males  undergoing  stem  cell 
transplantation).        
Embryo-foetal development  
The  embryo-foetal  developmental  study  in  rats  was  conducted  at  0,  10,  50,  and  250 mg/kg/day.    In  rats, 
foetal  developmental  effects  were  identified  at  dose levels  exhibiting  maternal toxicity.  The  NOAEL  for  both 
maternal  and  developmental  toxicity  was  50 mg/kg  (~2.5-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients).    Maternal 
findings  at  250 mg/kg/day  included  decreased  food  consumption  together  with  decreased  water  intake  and 
reduced  amount  of  faeces,  as  well  as  moderate  body  weight  loss  and  impaired  body  weight  gain,  reddish 
vaginal  discharge  (with  no  associated  post-implantation  loss)  and  possible  reduction  in  placental  weight.  
Reddish vaginal discharge occurred at 50 mg/kg/day, but this was not considered to be adverse as it was not 
associated  with  post-implantation  loss.  At  250 mg/kg/day,  decreased  foetal  weights  together  with  retarded 
ossification, increased incidence of shortened umbilical cord and slightly oedematous foetuses and increased 
incidence  of  generally  common  spontaneous  malformations  (additional  lumbar/pelvic  shift)  and  common 
skeletal variations (additional 14th rib and altered shape of sacral vertebral arches) were observed.  
The embryo-foetal developmental study in rabbits was conducted at 0, 25, 75, and 225 mg/kg/day.  Similarly 
to rats, in rabbits developmental toxicity was observed, but only in the presence of maternal toxicity at high 
dose levels.  One female at the high-dose of 225 mg/kg/day had to be sacrificed due to moribund condition 
and  three  other  females  in  this  dose  group  aborted  after  they  each  had  shown  signs  of  severe  maternal 
toxicity.    Decreases  in  food  consumption  and  marginal  body  weight  loss  during  treatment  period  and 
histomorphological  findings  in  the  intestine  and  liver  were  also  noted  in  dams  at  225 mg/kg/day.    A 
treatment related effect cannot be ruled out for two foetuses with one supernumerary presacral vertebra with 
13th  ribs  (malformation)  and  an  increased  incidence  of  13th  ribs  (floating  and  comma  shaped  or  fully 
present,  deviations)  at  225 mg/kg/day.    The  NOAEL  for  both  maternal  and  developmental  toxicity  in  this 
study was 75 mg/kg/day (~0.5-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients). 
It  is  acknowledged  that  “supernumerary  14th  ribs”  is  a  common  finding.  Findings  of  lumbosacral 
malformations and variations, including pelvic shift, supernumerary lumbar vertebrae, altered shape of sacral 
vertebrae  arches,  and  the  supernumerary  14th  ribs  in  the  high  dose,  which  was  maternally  toxic,  are 
considered treatment related and are discussed in the SmPC.

Gestation  Day  6 through  Day  22  postpartum  were evaluated  (TT #11-7860).    The  NOAEL  for  F0  generation 
was 45 mg/kg/day (1-fold, based on toxicokinetic data on Study Day 1, the exposure in HSCT recipients).  In 
F1 generation, the changes limited to 180 mg/kg/day, including slight transient reduction in body weight gain 
as  well  as  slight  delayed  vaginal  opening  in  the  F1  generation  were  considered  to  be  non-adverse  and  the 
NOAEL was ≥180 mg/kg/day (~2-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients).  Of note, there were no changes in 
male reproductive organs and no decreased fertility in the F1 generation. 
Toxicokinetic data 
It  is  clear  that  Letermovir  is  toxic  and  that  consequently  the  exposure  margins  between  patients  and  toxic 
exposure in animals are generally low (0.7 times in mouse, 7.8 times in female rats and 4.3 in monkeys).    
Local Tolerance  
When letermovir was dissolved in 20% hydroxypropyl betadex solution, the formulation did not induce signs 
of local intolerability after IV infusion, intra-arterial or subcutaneous injections of 2.5 or 5 mg/mL in a rabbit 
study; this cyclodextrin formulation produced only test item-related histopathological changes (focal necrosis 
of  muscle  cells)  after intramuscular  injection  (which is  not  the  clinical  route of  administration).    There  were 
no injection site changes observed in a local tolerance study in rats conducted with Polysorbate 80-containing 
and  arginine-containing  IV  formulations.    However,  based  on  local  tolerance  results  obtained  in  rabbits,  it 
cannot  be  totally  excluded  that  letermovir  when  applied  as  the  clinical  form  for  IV  administration  (an 
arginine-phosphate buffer lyophilisate reconstituted in water for injection) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL or 
higher may exert slight local intolerabilities in humans. 
Other toxicity studies 
Juvenile toxicity studies 
The potential toxicity of letermovir was assessed in juvenile male rats following daily oral administration for 2 
weeks starting at 14 days of age.  In addition, the potential for letermovir to interfere with the establishment 
of the blood-testis barrier was assessed.  There were no findings in the study except for a slight decrease in 
body  weight  gain  at  180  mg/kg/day.    Oral  administration  of  60  or  180 mg/kg/day  of  letermovir  to  juvenile 
male  rats  (postnatal  Day  14  through  27)  did  not  interfere  with  Sertoli  cell  proliferation  or  the  germinal 
epithelium.  Therefore the NOAEL in this study was ≥180 mg/kg/day. 
In relation to the juvenile toxicity data it can be concluded that they are of less importance to this application 
since  the  intended indication  is  confined  to  adults.  CHMP  noted  that this  study  should  have  been  prolonged 
until PD 40 to ensure exposure over the period of testicular development.    
Antigenicity 
There were no observations or changes in the routine repeat-dose toxicity studies that were considered to be 
due to potential antigenicity induced by letermovir.  Therefore, no antigenicity evaluations were conducted. 
Immunotoxicity  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 28/124 
 
  
 
Specific immunotoxicity endpoints were evaluated in the 4 and 13-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats. 
The  changes  noted  in  the  study  report  as  adverse  were  observed  only  at  180  mg/kg  and  were  limited  to 
increased  CD4 T  cells, B  cells,  antigen  presenting  cells,  and  CD45total  and  CD45low  cells  and  decreased 
CD45high cells.  Upon consideration of the totality of these nonclinical data for letermovir, these findings are 
not considered adverse or indicative of immunotoxicity. 
Metabolites  
No  circulating  metabolites  were  detectable  in  human  plasma  at  exposures  greater  than  10%  of  total  drug-
related  exposure.    Therefore,  the  ICH  M3(R2)  guidance  requirements  relative  to  metabolite  safety 
assessment have been met with letermovir and no studies were conducted with any individual metabolites. 
Impurities  
No nonclinical studies were conducted with any individual impurities.  The levels of all impurities were below 
the  qualification  threshold  as  defined  in  the  ICH  guideline  on  Impurities  in  New  Drug  Substances  [ICH 
Q3A(R2)]. 
Phototoxicity 
The molar extinction coefficient of letermovir at 290 nm is 10173 L.mol-1cm-1, which is above the threshold of 
1000  L.mol-1cm-1  for  phototoxicity  assessment  as  per  ICH  S10  Guidance.    Hence,  to  evaluate  the  potential 
phototoxic effects of letermovir, Long-Evans pigmented female rats were administered oral (gavage) doses of 
letermovir (0, 100 and 500 mg/kg/day) for three consecutive days followed by exposure to radiation from a 
xenon lamp to simulate sunlight.  There were no letermovir-related cutaneous or ocular findings indicative of 
phototoxicity.   
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  is  based  on  the  parent  compound  letermovir,  which  has  a 
molecular weight of 572.56 g/mol and has a water solubility of 573 mg/mL (pH 7) and a log KOW = 2.29 (pH 
7).  All  ERA  studies  are  performed  in  compliance  with  GLP.  The  ERA  Phase  I  surface  water  predicted 
environmental  concentration  (PECSW)  was  calculated  to  2.4  µg/L  using  the  default  Fpen  (0.01)  and  the 
maximum dose of 480 mg/day. Based on the OECD TG308 test, the persistence against aerobic degradation 
in whole fresh water-sediment systems is between DT50 22–34d (20°C), and 47-62d (12°C) with a tendency 
to  sediment  accumulation  (AR  >10%  after  14d).  There  was  some  primary  degradation  with  several 
transformation products (two products M1 and M7 at AR>10% with DT50 (20°C) for M7 being 65d) but only 
very  minor  ultimate  biodegradation.  The  organic  content  solid  adsorption  coefficients  for  letermovir  were 
below  10000  L/kg  for  sludge  and  soil  (log  Koc  2.49  to  3.46  L/kg)  –  making  it  unlikely  that  there  is  a 
terrestrial  environmental  risk  due  to  agricultural  use  of  sludge.  The  lowest  NOEC  for  aquatic  toxicity  was  1 
mg/kg  (the  maximum  concentration  in  the  FELS  test  using  P.  promelas)  while  the  most  sensitive  NOEC  for 
sediment-dwellers (C. riparius; NOEC 25mg/kg, OC10% normalized to 100mg/kg dry weight) was for midge 
development.

Ecological  risk:  Letermovir  is  not  classified  as  a  PBT  or  vPvB  candidate.  Based  on  the  Phase  I  PECSW,  the 
applicant  has  provided  a  set  risk  quotients/ratios  (RQs)  that  are  below  0.1  for  sludge  microorganisms  and 
below 1 for other compartments (the highest RQ being 0.5 for sediment-dwellers based on a sediment PEC of 
0.5mg/kg).  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Letermovir  has  activity  (single-digit  nanomolar  EC50  values)  against  laboratory  and  clinical  CMV  isolates  in 
cell-culture  models  of  infection.  Characterization  implicates  CMV  DNA  terminase  is  the  target  of  letermovir.  
The applicant has conducted several in vitro studies to address the primary pharmacodynamics of letermovir. 
However,  since  data  generated  by  these  studies  are  an  intricate  part  of  the  clinical  efficacy  data,  they  are 
presented and assessed in conjunction with the clinical data. 
A mouse xenograft model of human CMV infection the data illustrates that letermovir was at least as effective 
as VGCV at inhibiting CMV replication outside of typical cell culture conditions. 
There  were  no  letermovir-related  effects  of  concern  on  cardiovascular,  nervous  system,  and  respiratory 
functions observed in well characterized safety pharmacology experimental models. However, due to the low 
exposure margins to patients in the majority of the dedicated in vivo safety pharmacology studies, the actual 
risk cannot be extracted with confidence from the generated data. CHMP agreed that these limitations were 
acceptable, in light of the whole generated data package. Data from the clinical supratherapeutic QTc study 
did not result in QTc prolongation.

The  absorption  of  letermovir  was  adequately  characterised  in  rats  and  monkeys  following  IV  and  oral 
administration.  In  rat  distribution  studies,  letermovir  was  rapidly  and  widely  distributed  in  tissues  with  the 
highest  levels  of  radioactivity  observed  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  bile  duct  and  liver.  Elimination  of 
radioactivity  was  nearly  complete  at  3  days  post-dose.    Extensive  plasma  protein  binding  was  observed 
across all non-clinical species. 
The in vitro biotransformation of [14C]letermovir was investigated in all relevant non-clinical species studied 
and  all  human  metabolites  were  observed  in  liver  preparations  from  the  safety  species.  The  in  vivo 
metabolism  of  [14C]letermovir  was  studied  in  bile  duct-cannulated  and  intact  rats  and  in  humans.  In  rats, 
letermovir  represented  the  majority  of  drug-related  radioactivity  circulating  in  rat  plasma  accounting  for 
~60%  of  the  total  plasma  AUC.    Additionally,  an  oxidative  metabolite  (M5)  was  a  circulating  constituent  of 
the  plasma  radioactivity  accounting  for  ~25%  of  the  total  plasma  AUC.    In  the  human  ADME  study, 
letermovir was the major circulating constituent in human plasma, accounting for 96.6% of total drug related 
material.    No  in  vivo  metabolism  data  was  generated  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  absence of in  vivo  data 
may  question  its  relevance  as  a  toxicology  species.  However,  as  letermovir  is  the  major  circulating 
constituent in human plasma and based on the comparable in vitro metabolism and in vivo elimination data 
between species, further metabolism data in Cynomolgus monkeys is not requested by CHMP. 
The pivotal toxicity studies were performed in rat and monkey in which the animals were dosed either orally 
or  intravenously  for  up  to  39  weeks.    Rat  and  Cynomolgus  monkey  were  selected  as  the  main  non-clinical 
species  based  on  the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  metabolic  profiles  and  the  demonstration  of  satisfactory 
pharmacokinetics  in  these  species.  The  Applicant´s  justification  is  considered acceptable  by  CHMP  and  data 
generated in these species is regarded as relevant.  
In  mice,  oral  administration  of  letermovir  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested,  250 mg/kg/day  (~3.5-fold  the 
exposure in HSCT recipients) for 13 weeks was well tolerated.  The main antemortem change was decreased 
body weight gain in males (up to -23% compared to controls) with no impact on the general health status of 
the  animals.    The  NOAEL  was  100 mg/kg/day  (~2-  to  4-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients),  based  on 
hepatocyte vacuolation with slight increases in AST, ALT and bilirubin at 250 mg/kg/day.  However, the dose 
of  250 mg/kg/day  was  considered  minimally  toxic  in  the  absence  of  evidence  of  liver  inflammation, 
degeneration or necrosis at microscopic examination. 
In rats, oral administration up to the highest dose tested, 150 mg/kg/day (~6- to 7.5-fold the exposure in 
HSCT recipients) for 26 weeks was well tolerated.  The high dose of 150 mg/kg/day was selected based on 
evidence of effects of letermovir on body weight and identification of target organ toxicity (testes) at the high 
dose of 180 mg/kg/day in the 13-week repeat dose toxicity study.  The main antemortem changes were 
decreased food consumption (up to -6% compared to controls) and body weight gain in males (up to -11% 
compared to controls) with no impact on the general health status of the animals.  The NOAEL was 
≥150 mg/kg/day in females (approximately 7.8-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients) and 60 mg/kg/day in 
males (~1-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients) based on male reproductive organ toxicity observed in most 
toxicity studies in rats, including fertility studies at doses above 60 mg/kg/day.  The male reproductive organ 
toxicity consisted of vacuolation of the germinal epithelium, germ cell exfoliation, tubular atrophy and 
damage to Sertoli cells, and oligospermia and cell debris in the epididymides, with decreased testes and 
epididymides weights. This signal was irreversible after recovery and further exploited in dedicated rat 
reprotoxicity studies. In these studies a decrease in male fertility was observed. It is considered that this is a 
rat specific effect, as it was not observed in mice or monkeys. A risk for human testicular toxicity can still not 
be excluded; a mechanistic reason why such severe toxicity was seen in rats and not in other species has not 
been presented, and the lack of findings in biomarkers in the present phase 3 study is not considered

sensitive enough to rule out a toxicity, having baseline findings in these patients in mind. This issue should 
be closely monitored in PSURs. In addition, the unknown relevance for human is reflected in sections 4.6 and 
5.3 of the SmPC. For the present indication, where measures such as semen collection are standard due to 
other treatments, no specific recommendation is necessary in the SmPC (outside an adequate wording in 
SmPC section 5.3).  
The toxicity profile of letermovir in IV rat studies was consistent with the oral studies.  IV administration up 
to the highest dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (~7.5-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients) for 4 weeks was well 
tolerated.    The  NOAEL  was  ≥100 mg/kg/day  in  females  (~7-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients)  and 
30 mg/kg/day in males (~1-fold the exposure in HSCT recipients) based on male reproductive organ toxicity 
observed at 100 mg/kg/day. 
In  monkeys,  oral  administration  up  100 mg/kg/day (<1-fold the  exposure  in HSCT  recipients)  for  39  weeks 
was well tolerated.  The high-dose of the 39-week study, 250 mg/kg/day (~5- to 7-fold, males and females, 
respectively, the exposure in HSCT recipients) was not tolerated, as evidenced by body weight loss and signs 
of poor general health status, which resulted in the lowering of this dose to 200 mg/kg/day (1- to 2-fold the 
exposure  in  HSCT  recipients).    The  200 mg/kg/day  dose  was  generally  better  tolerated,  with  the  main 
antemortem  change  being  a  decreased  body  weight  gain  in  females  (-55%  relative  to  controls).    Doses 
higher  than  250/200 mg/kg/day,  300  and  500 mg/kg/day  (>11-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients)  were 
evaluated  in  shorter-term  monkey  studies  and  were  shown  to  be  associated  with  signs  of  gastrointestinal 
toxicity including emesis and abnormal faeces, and morbidity.  Based on the antemortem changes observed 
at  ≥250/200 mg/kg/day,  the  NOAEL  in  monkeys  was  100 mg/kg/day  (<1-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT 
recipients).  There were no adverse histomorphologic changes identified in monkeys.  Of note, in a controlled 
Phase  3  study  in  HSCT  patients,  treatment  related  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  in  the  letermovir  group 
were reported at similar rates to the placebo group.  
The toxicity profile of letermovir in IV monkey studies was consistent with the oral studies.  IV administration 
up  to  the  highest  dose  tested,  100 mg/kg/day  (~4-fold  the  exposure  in  HSCT  recipients)  for  4  weeks  was 
well  tolerated.    Letermovir  is  not  classified  as  a  PBT  or  vPvB  candidate.  Based  on  the  Phase  I  PECSW,  the 
applicant  has  provided  a  set  risk  quotients/ratios  (RQs)  that  are  below  0.1  for  sludge  microorganisms  and 
below 1 for other compartments (the highest RQ being 0.5 for sediment-dwellers based on a sediment PEC of 
0.5mg/kg). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
CHMP agreed that there are no objections to an approval of letermovir from a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The bioavailability of letermovir from the phase III formulation was estimated to 94% in healthy volunteers 
by  population  PK  analysis.  However,  there  are  indications  from  inter-study  comparisons  of  multiple  dose 
studies   that the  bioavailability  is  ca  50%  during  480  mg qd dosing  to  healthy  volunteers.  According  to  the 
popPK  analysis  in  HSCT  patients,  the  bioavailability  of  Letermovir  was  much  lower  (35%)  (but  increased  to 
85% when 240 mg qd was administered with CsA). It is noted that when making an inter-study comparison 
of  the  multiple  dose  PK  data,  the  exposure  after  iv  administration  appears  double  the  exposure  at  oral 
administration. The bioavailability during multiple-dose conditions in healthy volunteers may then be ca. 55% 
at  the  480  mg  qd  dose.  Thus,  the  bioavailability  may  be  reduced  under  multiple-dose  conditions  also  in 
healthy volunteers. There may be a time-dependent decrease in absorption due to auto induction of intestinal 
Pgp/BCRP. Auto induction affecting letermovir exposure is observed under multiple-dose conditions. Moderate 
induction  in  vivo  has  been  observed  on  CYP2C19  and  some  intestinal  induction  has  also  been  observed  on 
digoxin, which is not that sensitive for changes in intestinal Pgp activity (see below). 
Formulation comparisons 
The  bridging  BE  studies  confirms  extrapolation  of  data  obtained  with  different  formulations  within  healthy 
volunteers. PMF3 and FMI formulations were used in the pivotal Phase 3 trial (P001). 
Food-effect 
There is a small effect of concomitant food intake on Cmax (30% increase) but not on AUC under single-dose 
conditions  in  healthy  volunteers.  As  the  bioavailability  appears  different  during  multiple  dose  conditions/  in 
patients,  the  magnitude  of  the  food  effect  may  be  different  during  clinical  use.  However,  the  effect  is  not 
likely  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  lletermovir  was  administered  regardless  of  food  intake  in  the  phase  III 
studies The present SmPC recommendation is supported by data from the phase III studies. 
Solubility/pH dependency 
Solubility for letermovir is low between pH ~4 and ~7, (0.3-0.4 mg/mL). It increases below pH 4, and from 
pH ~7.  
Permeability 
The  permeability  cannot  be  classified  as  neither  high  nor  low,  as  the  study  was  not  optimally  designed  for 
making this classification.   
Intestinal transport 
Letermovir  is  efflux  transported  by  P-gp  and  BCRP.  Available  data  suggest  that  the  transporters  limit 
letermovir absorption during multiple-dose conditions. It is unknown whether an intestinal uptake transporter 
aids the absorption.  
Distribution 
Volume of distribution 
The  volume  of  distribution  is  reduced  with  increasing  doses  of  letermovir.  This  is  likely  a  consequence  of  a 
reduced distribution to OATP1B1/3 expressing tissues such as the liver. The volume of distribution was 87 L 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 37/124 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
after an iv infusion of 480 mg and 50 L during 240 mg qd. The population PK analysis estimates a population 
mean V (sum of central and peripheral compartments volume) to be 46 L in HSCT recipients.   
Protein binding 
Letermovir is extensively bound to human plasma protein in vitro. Letermovir bound both to serum albumin 
and AAG. In an initial study, using radiolabelled drug and ultrafiltration, the protein binding appeared to be 
concentration dependent (fraction unbound ranging from 1.0 to 2.1% ) within the range of 000 to 93000 
ng/mL. However, in a more recent study using equilibrium dialysis and LC-MS, the fraction unbound was 
1.8% at concentrations ≥3000 ng/ml and maintained so to the maximum studied 100000 ng/ml. The free 
fraction of letermovir was ca 0.9% at 1000 ng/ml and ca. 1.8 at higher concentrations. The protein binding of 
letermovir thus appears linear at concentrations corresponding to marked increases in drug exposure. 
However, to ensure the right conclusion is drawn and the results of the extrinsic factor studies in healthy 
volunteers can be trusted, the binding will be studied in a DDI study recommended as PAM (the rifampicin 
DDI study). It is possible that the binding in patients has the plateau at higher concentrations if the AAG 
concentrations are higher in the patients. However, this has no impact on the assessment of the 
interpretation of the results of the studies performed in healthy volunteers. It may have an impact on PK in 
patients. Red blood cell partitioning of letermovir was 0.56 and independent of the concentration range (0.1 
to 10 mg/L).

Organ distribution 
The distribution of letermovir may be influenced by the expression of OATPs as well as P-gp and BCRP as it is 
a substrate to these transporters. In albino rats, highest distribution was to the GI tract, bile ducts and liver. 
No  penetration  was  observed  to  the  CNS.    However  in  another  study  in  pregnant  albino  rats,  the  results 
indicated passage over the blood-brain barrier. The volume of distribution is dose-dependent likely due to the 
auto inhibition of OATP1B1/3 reducing distribution to organs expressing these transporters such as the liver.

Elimination 
The mass-balance investigation was performed at multiple-dose (80 mg bid) conditions using [14C]letermovir 
the  dose  before  sampling.  The  mean  recovery  of  total  radioactivity  from  excreta  was  95%.  The  major 
recovery of total radioactivity was in faeces and accounted for 93% with negligible amounts (<2%) recovered 
in urine. The radioactivity in faeces consisted of letermovir (70% of dose) as the major component and the 
acyl-glucuronide M7 (6%, unstable in faeces) as a minor component. The remaining 17% of radioactivity in 
faeces  corresponded  to  a  total  of  four  structurally  uncharacterized  metabolites  each  representing  similar 
amounts.  The  two  pathways  are  both  counted  as  main  elimination  pathways.  OATP1B1/3  is  responsible  for 
the uptake of letermovir into the hepatocyte. BCRP and Pgp mediate the efflux from the hepatocyte into the 
bile. Glucuronidation to the acyl glucuronide observed in vivo was catalysed by UGT isoforms 1A1 and 1A3. 
There is little in vivo DDI support of the elimination pathways of letermovir. There is no study investigating 
the effect of a strong OATP inhibitor or a strong Pgp/BCRP inhibitor. 
Interconversion 
Letermovir contains one chiral centre with an absolute configuration of S. Ex vivo data indicate that there is 
no conversion to the R-enantiomer in vivo. 
Metabolites in circulation 
Seventy-six  %  of  total  radiolabelled  material  in  plasma  was  parent  drug  and  the  remainder  was  related  to 
other  metabolites.  The  extraction  efficiency  of  the  AUC  plasma  pool  (0-24  hours)  was  84%  (60-88%)  with 
16% of radiolabelled material not being extractable. This unextractable material may have been, in part, the 
1-O-acyl-β-D-glucuronide (M7).  
Pharmacogenetics 
Polymorphism in SLCO1B1 (coding for OATP1B1) was expected to influence the AUC of letermovir in healthy 
volunteers. Pooled analysis was performed on data from phase 1 studies. Homozygous carriers of SLOC1B1 
rs4149056 had a mean 42% increase in drug exposure. The *1b/*5 and *5/*5 haplotypes were statistically 
significantly associated with increased letermovir AUC (by 25 and 58%, respectively). Subjects carrying the 
UGT1A1*6  rs4148323  minor  allele  (A)  have  a  36%  increase  in  a  pooled  analysis.  As  there  is  no  study  with 
stratified  inclusion  and  the  numbers  reside  from  pooled  analysis,  there  is  some  uncertainty  regarding  the 
exposure  change  estimates.  However,  the  effects  of  the  studied  polymorphisms  are  unlikely      clinically 
relevant. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Single-dose conditions 
Letermovir shows clear dose dependent pharmacokinetics due to saturation of drug elimination. CL decreased 
from  16.6  to  5.7  L/h  after  giving  iv  single  doses  from  30  to  480mg,  respectively.  In  another  study,  CL 
decreased  from  9.4  to  4.0  L/h  after  single-dose  administration  of  120  and  960  mg  iv,  respectively.  The 
nonlinearity was not that pronounced between iv 240 and 480 mg. After iv administration of 720 mg, there 
was  a  plateau  in  the  dose  normalised  AUC  indicating  either  that  the  saturable  pathway  was  completely 
saturated. The data on oral administration is partly aligned with iv data. One study investigating oral single 
doses up to 120 mg showed nonlinear elimination kinetics. In another study when increasing the dose from 
240 to 280 and 320 mg, the exposure was not increased further. These results are difficult to explain by full 
saturation  of  the  elimination  pathway  alone.  In  yet  another  study  investigating  oral  single  doses,  linear  PK 
Assessment report

was  observed,.  The  applicant  has  performed  a  PBPK  analysis  to  investigate  the  cause  of  the  saturated 
elimination.  The  platform  has  not  been  qualified  for  this  purpose  and  simulations  are  particularly  difficult 
regarding  transporters  due  to  lack  of  scientific  data.  However,  the  conclusion  that  OATP1B1  inhibition  is 
responsible for the saturated elimination is agreed upon, without relying on the simulations. 
Multiple-dose conditions 
Clearance in multiple-dose conditions at the therapeutic dose (the true clearance varies with concentration) 
during 480 mg qd, CL and t1/2 were ca. 4.66 L/h and 12 hours, respectively. There was little accumulation 
during  multiple-dose  conditions  and  the  exposure  was  nonlinear.  The  lack  of  accumulation  is  somewhat 
surprising  based  on  the  half-life  and  saturable  elimination.  This  may  again  be  a  result  of  auto  induction. 
There  was  no  study  investigating  many  different  dose  levels  aiming  to  understand  the  dynamics  of  the 
nonlinearity  observed  at  single-dose  conditions.  The  exposure  was  quite  dose-proportional  comparing  120 
and 240 mg qd iv. No other good comparative iv datasets are available. After oral administration, one study 
show saturable pharmacokinetics between 240 and 360 mg bid and one between 40 mg qd and 40 mg bid, 
but not between 40 mg bid and 80 mg bid. 
At oral high doses (720 mg qd and 480 mg qd), auto induction is observed. During iv administration of 480 
mg qd for 7 days, trough concentrations were increasing and there was no clear auto induction. This suggests 
that  the  majority  of  the  auto  induction  resides  in  the  intestine,  possibly  through  induction  of  Pgp  and/or 
BCRP.  An  autoinduction  component  was  also  needed  in  the  population  PK  model  to  obtain  satisfactory 
predictions. 
These exposure parameters are concluded from the data in healthy volunteers: 
•  480 mg qd iv infusion for 7 days mean Cmax 27000 ng/ml and AUC 129000 ngh/ml 
•  480 mg qd po for 9 days Cmax 13018 ng/ml and AUC 71484 ng*h/ml 
It  is  noted  that  when  making  an  inter-study  comparison  of  the  data  above,  the  exposure  after  iv 
administration is double the exposure at oral administration. The bioavailability may then be ca. 55% at this 
dose level,  maybe due  to absorption limitations  and/or  auto  induction  of intestinal  Pgp/BCRP.  This  is  in line 
with the low (35%) bioavailability observed in patients indicated by the population PK analyses. 
Table 16  Letermovir AUC (ng•hr/mL) values in HSCT Recipients  
The time needed to reach steady state appears to be dependent on mode of administration. Looking at the IV 
480 mg qd data, steady state may be obtained after ca. 5 days, while after oral administration, steady state 
may be reached later, after ca. 10 days. The population PK analysis indicate a time needed to obtain steady 
state of 9-10 days.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
According to the population PK analysis in patients, inter-individual variability (IIV) was estimated to 25 and 
37%  for  clearance  and  bioavailability,  respectively,  while  inter-occasion  variability  (IOV)  on  bioavailability 
was estimated to 44%. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Based  on    population  PK  analysis  of  phase  1  data,    healthy  volunteers  have  a  higher  bioavailability 
(approximately  94%)  as  compared  to  patients  (approximately  35%  without  concomitant  cyclosporin  A 
treatment).  Further,  co-treatment  with  cyclosporin  A  results  in  increased  bioavailability  in  patients 
(approximately  85%  with  concomitant  cyclosporin  A  treatment).  Clearance  in  patients  was  decreased  from 
4.8 L/h to 3.4 L/h in patients that received cyclosporin A. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of letermovir has been investigated at multiple dose condition (120 mg qd) for 8 days 
in  patients  with  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment.  Patients  with  ESRD  have  not  been  studied.  The 
unbound exposure of letermovir was doubled in both moderate and severe renal function impairment. One of 
the eight subjects with severe RI had an 8-fold increased unbound exposure. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of letermovir has been investigated at multiple dose condition 60 and 30 mg qd for 8 
days  in  patients  with  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment,  respectively,  and  compared  to  healthy 
controls  matched  for  each  group  and  having  the  same  dose.  The  exposure  of  unbound  letermovir  was 
increased  4-fold  in  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  81%  increased  in  moderate  impairment.  Use  in  severe 
impairment  is  not  recommended  but  in  moderate  impairment,  the  SmPC  states  that  no  dose  adjustment  is 
required.  The  exposure  of  letermovir  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  treated  with  CsA 
combined with letermovir is estimated to be within the target exposure range. 
Japanese 
The pharmacokinetics of letermovir has been studied in Japanese subjects after single doses of 240, 480, and 
720 mg orally and 240, 480, and 960 mg iv. Furthermore, multiple doses of 480 mg qd for 7 days have been 
studied and also of 240 mg qd but with a 200 mg CsA dose on the sampling day (day 8). The exposure was 
doubled  in  Japanese  as  compared  to  Non-Japanese  as  historical  controls.  This  increase  is  considered  not 
clinically relevant. The dose dependency (saturable elimination) was more pronounced in the Japanese. 
Blacks 
There was no significant difference in the exposure of letermovir estimated in Blacks. 
Gender 
Based on population PK analyses, gender did not have a clinically relevant effect on letermovir exposures. 
Body Weight 
Letermovir  exposure  decreased  with  an  increase  in  body  weight.  The  population  PK  analyses  showed  that 
letermovir  exposures  changed  slightly  with  changes  in  body  weight;  within  the  White  subgroup,  letermovir 
exposures were 18.7% lower for subjects with high weight (80- 100 kg) compared to the average weight of 
67.1 kg observed in the population PK analysis dataset.

Summary of the interpretation of the in vivo relevance of the in vitro inhibition results: Letermovir was found 
to inhibit CYP2B6 in the liver, CYP3A4 in intestine and liver (TDI), CYP2C8 in intestine and liver, UGT1A1 in 
intestine  and  liver,  Pgp  at  intestine  and  liver/kidney,  BCRP  in  intestine  and  liver,  hepatic  MRP-2  after  iv 
administration  only,  OATP1B1  and  3  in  liver,  OATP2B1  in  intestine  and  liver,  OAT1  in  liver,  OAT3  in  kidney 
and, finally BSEP in liver. The intestinal inhibition is of course only relevant for orally administered letermovir.  
In vitro induction 
Induction  of  CYP3A4  and  CYP2B6  (model  enzymes  for  PXR  and  CAR  mediated  induction,  respectively)  was 
observed  at  relevant  concentrations.  For  CYP2B6,  the  induction  signal  was  more  pronounced  at  an  activity 
level.  No  induction  of  CYP1A2  (Ah-receptor  mediated  induction)  was  observed.  The  calculated  EC50  values 
obtained in two lots were 0.83 ± 0.60 μM and 0.70 ± 0.38 μM with Emax  values reaching 5.4 and 5.3  fold 
increase over solvent control, respectively.  
In vivo DDI studies 
MECHANISTIC STUDIES 
A)  Letermovir as perpetrator of DDIs 
Midazolam (CYP3A4)  
Letermovir  is  a  moderate,  time-dependent,  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4. The  AUC  of  midazolam  after  oral 
administration  increased  by  125%  on  the  6th  day  of  treatment  with  letermovir  240  mg  qd  p.o.  (half  the 
therapeutic  dose.)  The  effect  on  the  AUC  of  iv  administered  midazolam  on  the  4th  day  of  treatment  was 
47%. The effect of oral and iv letermovir is likely larger after 480 mg qd. This is also supported by sirolimus 
DDI data (see below). 
Digoxin  
On  the  6th  day  of  240  mg  letermovir  BID  digoxin  was  administered.  Digoxin  AUC0-last  and  Cmax  were 
reduced by 12 and 25%, respectively, likely due to Pgp induction mainly in the intestine. The effect may not

be present for iv administered Letermovir. The effect may be larger on drugs for which intestinal Pgp is more 
important such as dabigatran and sofosbuvir. 
Statins  
Atorvastatin is a substrate of OATP1B1/3, BCRP and CYP3A.  The OATP1B1 involvement appears higher than 
for pravastatin and rosuvastatin.  When atorvastatin was administered as a 20 mg single-dose on the 8th day 
of letermovir 480 mg qd, atorvastatin exposure was increased by 230%. Tmax of atorvastatin was prolonged. 
The  half-life  of  atorvastatin  was  unaffected.  The  exposure  of  orthohydroxyatorvastatin  and 
parahydroxyatorvastatin  was  unchanged  while  the  observed  median  Tmax  for  both  metabolites  were 
markedly prolonged. Most statins may be markedly affected by letermovir with or without cyclosporine. 
B)  Letermovir as victim of DDIs  
The applicant did not perform any mechanistic study providing in vivo support to the elimination pathways of 
Letermovir.  The  studies  with  cyclosporine  single-dose  (see  below)  provide  some  support  to  the  OATP 
involvement.  However,  it  may  not  be  used  to  quantify  the  involvement  as  CsA  also  inhibits  Pgp  and  BCRP. 
The effect of potently inhibiting Pgp/BCRP alone is not known. Cyclosporine is used by half the patients. The 
effect of adding a Pgp/BCRP or an OATP1B1/3 inhibitor to the Letermovir-CsA combination is also not known. 
There  are  no  DDI  studies  with  inducers.  PAMs  have  been  requested  to  provide  some  of  the  missing 
information. 
Between pH ~4 and ~7, letermovir exhibits low intrinsic solubility. Solubility increases below pH 4, above pH 
~7,  solubility  increases  again.  The  solubility  appears  high  enough  for  the  pH  dependency  not  to  reflect  in 
DDIs with PPIs (see table). In addition, exploratory population PK analysis did not indicate any relevant effect 
by PPIs.  
STUDIES WITH COMMON CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
The patient population has many concomitant medications (see below).

Table 19  Summary of Concomitant Immunosuppressive Regimen Use 
(ASaT Population; Treatment phase and letermovir arm only) 
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS 
Cyclosporine 
A  high  fraction  of  the  patients  were  co-treated  with  cyclosporine.  A  50%  reduction  of  the  dose  (to  240  mg 
qd)  was  used  when  letermovir  was  administered  with  cyclosporine  in  phase  III  studies.  Cyclosporine  is  a 
CYP3A substrate and an inhibitor of OATP1B1, Pgp and BCRP.  
In transplantation, the recommended dose of CsA is approximate, but 2-6 mg/kg is proposed divided on two 
administrations. For a person weighing 70kg, the dose translates to 70-210mg bid.  
There  are  two  conventional  DDI  studies  with  cyclosporine  but  they  included  only  a  CsA  single  dose  and  a 
quite low such dose. On the seventh day of letermovir 80 mg bid p.o, the AUC of CsA administered as a 50 
mg  single-dose  was  80%  increased.  Letermovir  AUC  was  90%  increased  by  the  CsA  50mg  single-dose. 
During letermovir 40 mg bid treatment, single doses of CsA were administered; 50 mg on day 7, 200 mg on 
day  14.  There  was  an  increase  by  130%  in  letermovir  AUC  after  coadministration  of  50  mg  CsA  and  an 
increase by 240%, after coadministration of 200 mg CsA.  
In another study, a single oral CsA 50 mg dose was administered on the 8th day of letermovir 240 mg qd. 
CsA  exposures  were  50-70%  increased  and  C12  and  C24  doubled.  Very  unfortunately,  the  study  did  not 
include an arm with letermovir alone. Thus, direct comparisons investigating the effect on letermovir are not 
possible. The CsA dose was subtherapeutic. 
The  recommendation  in  the  SmPC  section  4.5  regarding  co-treatment  with  CsA  is  to  reduce  the  letermovir 
dose  by  50%  (from  480  to  240  mg  qd)  and  to  TDM  for  CsA.  This  recommendation  was  used  in  phase  III 
studies.  
.The  above  Phase  1  DDI  studies  with  CsA  informed  the  dose  selection  for  the  Phase  3  trial.  A  more 
pronounced effect by CsA was observed in the population PK analysis where the exposure was doubled after 
240  mg  qd  with  CsA  as  compared  to  480  mg  qd  without  CsA  (see  below).  The  interaction  was  not  as 
pronounced after iv administration and thus the 240 mg taken with CsA did not reach the exposure obtained 
with  480  mg  qd iv  (see  below).  The  difference  between  iv  and  po  administration  may  be the  Pgp  mediated

efflux  in  the  intestine  after  the  oral  but  not  iv  administration.  The  net  result  is  that  the  exposure  obtained 
with oral letermovir without CsA is markedly lower than the exposure obtained with the other treatments. 
Table 20 Letermovir AUC (ng x hr/mL) values in HSCT recipients 
There  is  another  DDI  study  where  a  CsA  50  mg  single  dose  was  administered  with  and  without  letermovir 
240 mg qd. No effect of CsA on letermovir was determined in this study but numerically the AUCs observed 
when taken with the CsA single dose was very similar to the result of the population PK analysis in the 240 
mg qd oral + CsA arm.  
A  different  interaction  effect  is  expected  with  therapeutic  doses  of  letermovir and  CsA  and  after  oral  and  iv 
letermovir.  This  depends  on  differences  in  systemic  exposure,  in  intestinal  exposure  and  additional 
transporter inhibition brought by CsA. 
Tacrolimus 
Tacrolimus  is  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  and  5,  and  is  transported  by  Pgp,  but  in  contrast  to  CsA,  it  is  not  a 
known  transporter  inhibitor.  Letermovir  480  mg  qd  p.o.  doubled  the  exposure  of  tacrolimus  (5  mg  single-
dose) on the 8th day of of treatment, absorption and half-life were prolonged.   In another study letermovir 
80 mg bid po increased tacrolimus AUC by 60% after a tacrolimus 5mg single dose. The DDI may be caused 
by  CYP3A4  inhibition  but  the  prolonged  absorption  also  indicates  Pgp  induction  or  intestinal  uptake 
transporter inhibition. TDM for tacrolimus is recommended in the SmPC.  
Sirolimus 
Sirolimus  is  metabolised  by  CYP3A  and  is  also  transported  by  Pgp.  Sirolimus  exposures  (AUCs)  were 
approximately 3-fold higher following coadministration with letermovir 480 mg qd p.o. (day 8 of treatment) 
and  a  2  mg  sirolimus  single-dose.  The  absorption  was  delayed  by  1.5  hours  again  indicating  intestinal  Pgp 
induction. In the SmPC, frequent monitoring is advised. 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA)  
MPA  is  the  active  metabolite  of  mycophenolate  mofetil.  The  PI  approved  at  national  level  indicated  that 
glucuronidation  catalysed  by  UGT1A9  followed  by  hydrolysis  and  enterohepatic  recirculation  is  the  main 
elimination pathway of mycophenolic acid. Coadministration of 480 mg qd letermovir at steady state with a 
single  dose  of  1  g  mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  has  no  meaningful  effect  on  the  PK  of  mycophenolic  acid 
(MPA).

ANTIVIRALS 
Acyclovir     
Acyclovir is a very commonly used drug in the target population. The drug is mainly eliminated through renal 
excretion with a large contribution of active secretion to a significant extent mediated by OCT2, OAT 1 and/or 
3 (shown as DDIs with cimetidine and probenecid, respectively). Letermovir inhibits OAT3 in vitro at in vivo 
relevant  concentrations..  Five  days  of  treatment  with  480  mg  letermovir  qd  did  not  influence  the 
pharmacokinetics of acyclovir (400 mg acyclovir single-dose).  
ANTIFUNGALS 
Antifungals  were  used  in  almost  all  patients.  Concomitant  treatment  is  expected  with  the  following: 
fluconazole,  isavuconazole,  voriconazole,  posaconazole,  amphotericin  B  and  echinocandins  (caspofungin, 
anidulafungin and micafungin). Voriconazole and in particular fluconazole were common in the target patient 
population.  
Voriconazole     
When letermovir 480 mg qd was administered together with voriconazole multiple dose regimen (as per the 
product SmPC) for 4 days, the exposure of voriconazole was reduced by 44% due to CYP2C19 induction. The 
effect on voriconazole was evaluated the 8th day of letermovir treatment. The effect on voriconazole may be 
somewhat  more  pronounced  at  steady  state.  The  effect  on  letermovir  exposure  was  not  studied.  The  effect 
by letermovir 240 mg qd (with CsA) is likely lower but it is not known how much the DDI is reduced. TDM is 
advised  to  maintain  therapeutic  concentrations  of  voriconazole.  CYP2C19  PMs  will  likely  have  increased 
exposures. 
Posaconazole 
Letermovir 480 mg qd for 14 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole (300 mg single-dose). 
Available in vitro data does not indicate an effect by posaconazole on letermovir.  
Fluconazole and other not studied antifungals 
The  interaction  with  other  antifungals  fluconazole,  isavuconazole,  amphotericin  B  and  capsofungin, 
anidulafungin  and  micafungin  has  not  been  studied.  Based  on  the  available  information  no DDI  is  predicted 
with  fluconazole,  caspofungin  or  anidulafungin.  Letermovir  likely  increases  isavuconazole  exposure  through 
CYP3A  inhibition.  Available  data  indicate  a  clinically  not  relevant  increase  in  exposure  but  it  is  unknown 
whether  isavuconazole  also  is  transported  by  OATP1B1/3,  which  could  make  the  DDI  more  marked.  The 
enzymes and transporters involved in main elimination pathways of micafungin and amphotericin B does not 
appear to be well characterised. As the data is so sparse, is thus not known whether letermovir will give rise 
to reduced exposures of amphotericin B or micafungin. 
ANTIBACTERIALS 
There  are  no  interaction  studies  with  penicillins,  cephalosporines,  carbapenems  or  vancomycin.  The  risk  of 
interactions  has  been  discussed  based  on  the  available  scientific  information.  The  elimination  of  piperacillin 
has  partial  contribution  of  metabolism  and  biliary  secretion  that  may  be  inducible  and  thus  affected  by 
letermovir.  Such  contribution  in  the  elimination  of  tazobactam  is  smaller.  Available  information  does  not 
indicate an interaction risk for meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, cefepime, vancomycin and ceftazidime.

Ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel  
The  HSCT  patients  treated  on  this  indication  are  highly  unlikely  to  be  fertile.  Letermovir  480  mg  qd  for  12 
days gave rise to a 43% increase in EE AUC, and a 36% increased AUC of levonorgestrel administered as a 
single-dose. As letermovir is an inducer, a decrease in exposure of the contraceptives is expected unless the 
effect is counteracted by inhibition of proteins such as CYP3A, BCRP or UGT1A1. The net effect thus depends 
on  the  elimination  pathways  or  the  specific  steroid.  Thus,  the  lack  of  DDI  may  not  be  translated  to  other 
systemically acting contraceptive steroids. 
Target exposure range 
The  target  range,  or  here  –  range  of  the  fold  change  where  it  is  considered  that  satisfactory  efficacy  and 
safety has been shown – varies by letermovir regimen as the observed exposure in patients treated with the 
separate  regimens  is  quite  different  (See table  1). The  range  for  oral  letermovir  without  CsA  is  1 to  9-fold. 
For  the  other  regimens,  the  range  is  0.5  to  4-fold.  The  differences  results  in  different  treatment 
recommendations  for  the  separate  regimens  in  situations  where  the  exposure  of  letermovir  is  affected  by 
other drugs. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction 
Letermovir (also referred to as MK-8228, AIC001, AIC090027, AIC246, BAY 73-6327, EX-30, EX000030, BR-
4359)  is  a  novel  inhibitor  of  the  human  cytomegalovirus  (CMV).  Virological  characterization  and  sequence 
analysis of resistant viruses indicate that the viral terminase complex is the target of this compound. Unlike 
currently marketed anti-CMV drugs, which act via inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, terminase inhibitors 
interfere  with  viral  DNA  maturation  and  packaging  of  monomeric  genome  units.  Consequently,  cross-
resistance  is  not  expected  between  letermovir  and  currently  approved  medicines  for  the  treatment  of  CMV 
infection.  There  is  no  known  mammalian  counterpart  of  the  viral  terminase  complex.  Therefore,  this  novel 
mechanism could provide an efficacious and well- tolerated therapy for CMV reactivation and disease. 
Mechanism of action 
Selection  and  genotyping  of  a  panel  of  mutant  viruses  that  escaped  letermovir  inhibition  indicated  that  the 
viral  terminase  complex,  which  plays  a  key  role  in  cleavage  and  packaging  of  viral  progeny  DNA,  is  the 
target.  The  terminase  complex  minimally  consists  of  a  large  and  a  small  subunit  that  are  encoded  by  two 
viral genes (UL56 and UL89). The terminase complex is thought to interact with premature viral capsids by 
binding  to  the  viral  portal  protein  pUL104.  Recently,  another  viral  protein  (pUL51)  has  also  been  found  in 
complex with pUL56 and pUL89, although its functional role within the viral terminase machinery remains to 
be  elucidated.  Consistent  with  letermovir  resistance  mutations  that  map  to  UL56,  biochemical  experiments 
and  electron  microscopy  demonstrated  that  letermovir  affects  the  formation  of  proper  unit  length  genomes 
from viral DNA concatamers and interferes with virion maturation.

Figure. 3 Mechanism of Action: Letermovir Interferes with CMV Genome Cleavage and Encapsidation of 
Monomeric CMV Progeny DNA 
Mutant CMV isolates resistant to letermovir were generated in vitro. DNA sequencing identified mutations in 
the CMV UL56 terminase gene, and marker transfer analyses confirmed that these mutations were necessary 
and  sufficient  to  confer  letermovir  resistance.  No  resistance-associated  mutations  were  found  in  the  UL51, 
UL89, or UL104 genes. 
While letermovir treatment leads to an immediate cessation of the production of infectious viral particles, it 
allows  DNA  synthesis  to  occur,  thus  providing  DNA  copies  that  are  measured  by  the  CMV  DNA  assay. 
Valganciclovir, in contrast, is a DNA polymerase inhibitor and thus has an immediate effect on the production 
of DNA copies. 
In  the  P001  study,  CMV  DNAemia  has  been  used  as  a  trigger  for  initiating  pre-emptive  therapy  with 
GCV/VGCV.  However,  given  that  the  postulated  mechanism  of  action  of  letermovir  is  down-stream  of  DNA 
synthesis, CMV DNA might not be the optimal biomarker for the efficacy of letermovir prophylaxis. It may be 
that  CMV  DNA  levels  rise,  but  without  the  output  of  infectious  virions  that  characterizes  virologic  failure. 
However, as there are no validated alternative biomarkers or PET initiation thresholds, the use of CMV DNA 
for  monitoring  and  standard-of-care  PET  criteria  is  endorsed  although  this  could  be  too  conservative  and 
result in unnecessary termination of letermovir prophylaxis. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The mechanism of action is described above.  
Antiviral potency 
In cell culture models of infection, letermovir inhibited laboratory and clinical CMV isolates, including several 
strains resistant to other anti-CMV agents, with low nanomolar EC50 (50% effective concentration) values. 
Antiviral Drug Resistance 
In  order  to  identify  CMV  mutations  linked  to  letermovir  drug  resistance,  cell-culture  selection  procedures 
were  used  to  isolate  mutant  viruses  that  escaped  letermovir  inhibition.  Characterization  of  these  CMV

mutants  established  that:  i)  all  mutants  were  resistant  to  letermovir,  with  EC50  values  that  were  13- to 
5,870-fold higher than those for the wild-type parental virus; and ii) each isolate had a mutation in UL56, the 
viral  gene  encoding  the  large  subunit  of  the  CMV  DNA  terminase  complex.  The  deduced  amino  acid 
substitutions  in  UL56  were  clustered  in  a  conserved  region  between  amino  acids  231  and  369.  Marker 
transfer  experiments  and  recombinant  phenotyping  confirmed  that  each  UL56  mutation  was  necessary  and 
sufficient for resistance to letermovir, and shifts in drug susceptibility for each recombinant mutant virus and 
its corresponding original mutant isolate were equivalent. No resistance-associated mutations were found in 
other regions of UL56, or in the UL51, UL89 or UL104 genes. None of the mutations affected virus growth in 
cell  culture,  although  the  fitness  of  these  variants  in  vivo  remains  to  be  determined.  The  selected  UL56 
mutations  conferred  reduced  susceptibility  to  letermovir  but  had  no  effect  on  susceptibility  to  CMV  DNA 
polymerase inhibitors including ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet.

Common UL56 and UL89 polymorphisms 
In addition to the UL56 genotypes whose impact on letermovir susceptibility has been measured,  CMV  DNA 
sequences  in  a  public  database  have  been  used  to  identify  additional  genotypic  variants  in  both  UL56  and

generated from these DNA sequence entries were aligned to UL56 and UL89 amino acid sequences from the 
letermovir-susceptible  CMV  Merlin  strain  (NCBI  accession  number  NC_006273.2).  Differences  from  the 
reference include both rare and common polymorphisms.  In UL56, 44 of 850 AAs had one or more variants 
detected. At 37 of these 44 AAs there was one variant compared to the Merlin reference UL56 AA sequence; 
at 5 of the 44 AAs there were two variants; and at 2 of 44 AAs there were 3 variants. The total number of 
variants was 53; included among these 53 variants were 17 whose impact on susceptibility to letermovir had 
been previously determined. In UL89, 18 of 674 AAs had one variant detected. None of these variants have 
been  characterized  for  their  impact  on  susceptibility  to  letermovir.  Finally,  none  of  the  previously-
characterized  UL56  letermovir-resistant  genotypic  variants  were  found  amongst  the  entries  in  the  NCBI 
database.  
Letermovir resistant strains can be selected with unaffected replicative capacity in vitro but the viral fitness in 
vivo,  resistance  barrier  and  clinical  impact  remains  to  be  elucidated.  From  the  entries  in  the  NCBI  DNA 
sequence  database  it  seems  that  the  letermovir  resistance  mutations  selected  in  vitro  are  not  common 
naturally existing polymorphisms. 
Phenotypic resistance data from clinical isolates drawn from subjects failing letermovir prophylaxis will be 
submitted post-approval to address CHMP recommendation. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The marketing authorization application states states that the antiviral spectrum of letermovir is specific for 
human CMV. With the exception of murine CMV, which had an EC50 value of 4.51 ± 2.01 μM, letermovir was 
defined as inactive (EC50 > 10 μM) against other herpes viruses (VZV, HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV, HHV-6, and rat 
CMV) and non-herpes viruses (HIV, influenza A, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and adenovirus). 
For  EBV  (in  a  GFP-based  replication  assay),  there  is  a  seemingly  dose-dependent  response  although  at 
micromolar rather than nanomolar concentrations. However, the Cmax values in the Phase 3 study in HSCT 
patients ranged from 2,549 ng/mL to 21,570 ng/mL (approx. 38 µM). 
For HHV-6 (in a PCR assay), the lowest concentration of letermovir that was evaluated (0.12 µM) resulted in 
an approximately 50% reduction of DNA expression with no further reduction at higher concentrations. Given 
that the mechanism of action does not primarily reduce DNA expression, antiviral effects cannot be excluded 
from this assay. 
However,  an  UL56  homology  search  shows  very  limited  homology  between  the  CMV  UL56  and  orthologs 
among  other  human  herpesviruses,  supporting  the  claim  that  the  letermovir  mechanism  of  action  is  CMV 
specific.  In  the  P001  study,  similar  rates  of  reactivation  of  other  herpesviruses  were  seen  in  the  P001 
letermovir  and  placebo  groups,  although  the  patients  were  not  systematically  monitored  for  these  viruses. 
However,  the  overall  rates  reported  in  the  P001  study  are  very  low  in  comparison  to  previously  published 
data (eg. Burns et al 2016, Aoki et al 2015) but differences are likely driven by the systematic, hence more 
frequent, sampling in these studies. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
Interactions with Approved CMV Antivirals in Inhibition of CMV Replication 
The inhibition of CMV by letermovir in combination with several currently approved CMV antivirals that target 
CMV  DNA  replication  was  evaluated  in  cell  culture  checkerboard  assays.  Using  two  separate  mathematical

techniques  (Loewe  Additivity  and  Bliss  Independence)  for  analysis,  additive  effects  for  the  combination  of 
letermovir with either GCV, CDV, FOS or acyclovir were observed. The lack of antagonism between letermovir 
and  these  compounds  suggests  that  inhibition  of  CMV  DNA  polymerase  does  not  antagonize  concurrent 
inhibition of CMV DNA terminase in a cell-culture model of infection. 
Effect of Letermovir on the In Vitro Activity of Selected anti-HIV Drugs  
Two-drug  combinations  of  letermovir  with  anti-HIV  agents  were  evaluated  in  a  cell-culture  model  of  HIV 
infection. In these checkerboard assays, human MT-4 cells were infected with the HIV-1LAI virus at an MOI 
of  0.01  in  the  presence  of  compounds,  and  the  cytopathic  effect  was  measured  using  an  alamar  Blue  cell 
viability  assay  following  5  days  incubation.  The  anti-HIV  compounds  included  HIV  protease  inhibitors  (ATV, 
DRV,  LPV,  and  RTV),  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (FTC,  TDF),  non-  nucleoside  reverse 
transcriptase  inhibitors  (EFV,  ETR,  and  NVP),  and  an  HIV  integrase  inhibitor  (RAL).  The  drug-drug 
interactions were classified according to the method of Prichard and Shipman.  All combinations of letermovir 
with HIV drugs in this study were defined as additive, with the exception of letermovir plus TDF, which was 
classified  as  minor  antagonism.  Given  that  any  HIV-  and/or  HBV-infected  patient  that  undergo  allo-HSCT  is 
most  likely  fully  virologically  suppressed,  the  possibility  of  a  minor  PD  antagonism  during  the  letermovir 
treatment is not considered to be of clinical importance. 
Additive,  but  not  synergetic  effects,  were  observed  between  letermovir  and  currently  available  DNA 
polymerase inhibitors.   
Genetic differences in PD response 
CMV is divided into four genotypes according to the polymorphisms in UL55 gene that encodes for envelope 
glycoprotein  B.  The  activity  of  letermovir  was  not  significantly  affected  by  the  gB  genotype  of  CMV,  and 
isolates  with  mutations  in  the  CMV  UL54  and/or  UL97  genes  that  confer  resistance  to  GCV  and  other  CMV 
DNA polymerase inhibitors maintained susceptibility to letermovir. 
As the pharmacological target is of viral origin, host-related genetic differences are not expected to directly 
influence the pharmacodynamic response. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In Vitro Dose Response of Letermovir 
The  EC50  values  for  letermovir  against  a  collection  of  74  CMV  isolates  (including  50  low–passage  clinical 
strains) ranged from 0.14 to 6.1 nM.

Antiviral Assay 
c=drug concentration; rel.=relative 
In a separate study, EC50 values for letermovir in the presence of 0/5/10/20/40% human serum were 2.5, 
3.5,  4.7,  5.6,  and  10.7  nM,  respectively.  This  illustrates  that  the  potency  of  letermovir  in  cell  culture  is 
shifted ca. 4.3-fold when the serum concentration is increased from 0 to 40% - the predicted EC50 values in 
100% serum is 22.4 nM. 
Antiviral Activity on Various Cell Types 
For  some  antiviral  drugs,  large  differences  in  EC50  values  have  been  reported  based  on  either  cell  culture 
conditions or the origin of the cells used for the in vitro infection model. EC50 values were determined for the 
fibroblast-specific  AD169  strain  using  various  fibroblast  cell  lines.  The  antiviral  activity  of  letermovir  was 
equivalent  in  all  cell  lines  tested.  In  contrast,  GCV  EC50  values  varied  by  as  much  as  7-fold  depending  on 
which fibroblasts were used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Target range 
The  target  range,  or  here  –  range  of  the  fold  change  where  it  is  considered  that  satisfactory  efficacy  and 
safety has been shown – varies by letermovir regimen as the observed exposure in patients is quite different. 
The range for oral letermovir without CyA is 1 to 9-fold. For the other regimens, the range is 0.5 to 4-fold. 
This  should  be  kept  in  mind  when  proposing  treatment  recommendations  and  the  difference  in  margins 
depending on regimen composes a communication challenge. 
Methods 
Non-linear PK was seen in healthy volunteers in the phase 1 population PK analysis. For instance, clearance 
in  healthy  volunteers  was  seen  to  be  concentration  as  well  as  time  dependent.  This  non-linear  PK  of 
letermovir was not included in the second population PK analysis due to the limited dose range, sparse data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 57/124 
 
  
 
 
collected in the phase 3 trial and lack of information to support the more complex disposition model built on 
phase  1  data.  Therefore,  the  two  models  describe  different  parts  of  the  letermovir  PK  data  and  cannot  be 
used interchangeably. 
The current phase 1 model does not provide a proper description of the complex disposition (distribution and 
elimination)  of  letermovir,  which  probably  involves  non-linear  behaviour  in  hepatic  uptake  as  well  as 
enterohepatic  recirculation.  Extrapolation  to  unstudied  scenarios  using  the  phase  1  model  is  discouraged. 
However,  it  is  agreed  that  the  model  can  be  used  to  describe  the  exposure  in  healthy  volunteers  following 
single and repeated dosing of letermovir at the 240 mg and 480 mg dose levels. 
The phase 3 population PK analysis included four Phase 1/2 trials and a Phase 3 trial.  
Saturable protein binding 
Letermovir is extensively bound to human plasma protein in vitro. Letermovir bound both to serum albumin 
and  AAG.  The  binding  is  concentration  dependent  at  low  concentrations  but  reached  a  plateau  at 
concentrations ≥3000 ng/ml and maintained so to the maximum studied 100000 ng/ml. The free fraction of 
letermovir was ca 0.9% at 1000 ng/ml and ca. 1.8 at higher concentrations. Letermovir thus appears linear 
at  concentrations  corresponding  to  marked  increases  in  drug  exposure.  However,  to  ensure  the  right 
conclusion  is  drawn  and  the  results  of  the  extrinsic  factor  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  can  be  trusted,  the 
binding will be studied in a DDI study recommended as PAM (the rifampicin DDI study). It is possible that the 
binding  in  patients  has  the  plateau  at  higher  concentrations  if  the  AAG  concentrations  are  higher  in  the 
patients. However, this is not relevant for this assessment. 
Bioavailability 
The bioavailability of letermovir may be lower in HSCT patients than in healthy volunteers. The data is not 
clear. The bioavailability was estimated to approximately 35% in patients by population-PK. The 
bioavailability of the phase III formulation was estimated to 94% in healthy volunteers by population PK 
analysis. However, there was very little supportive data at 480 mg qd as basis for the popPK analysis in 
healthy volunteers. It is noted that when making an inter-study comparison of the multiple dose PK data, the 
exposure after iv administration is double the exposure at oral administration.  Thus these data indicate that 
bioavailability may then be approximately 55% at the 480 mg qd dose level, maybe due to absorption 
limitations and/or auto induction of intestinal Pgp/BCRP. The involvement of Pgp/BCRP is also indicated by 
the markedly larger effect by CsA on oral as compared to iv letermovir. The pop PK analysis indicates that 
the majority of the effect of CsA is exerted through impact on the bioavailability. The applicant suggests 
mucositis as explanation for the low bioavailability. However, this is not in line with CsA drug interaction 
results and this condition is usually not present at the time point when the letermovir treatment is changed 
from iv to oral administration. 
Letermovir elimination 
The mass-balance data does not allow a conclusion regarding the relative contribution of biliary excretion and 
glucuronidation  but  it  can  be  concluded  that  these  are  the  two  major  elimination  pathways.  OATP1B1/3  is 
involved  in  the  uptake  to  the  hepatocyte  making  drug  available  for  metabolism  and  excretion.  There  is  no 
DDI study with a potent selective OATP inhibitor. Pgp and BCRP are involved in the efflux to the bile and in 
the intestine, the transporters appears to limit the bioavailability.  There is no in vivo DDI study with a potent 
selective  Pgp/BCRP  inhibitor  allowing  a  quantification  of  the  contribution  of  these  proteins.  Finally,  there  is 
also no in vivo study with an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and 3, which catalyses the glucuronidation. There is some 
pharmacogenetic support for the in vivo contribution of UGT1A1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017

It takes approximately 9 days to reach steady state of letermovir. There is minimal accumulation but there is 
autoinduction  and  dose-dependent  elimination.  The  DDI  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  letermovir 
treatments  of  optimal  length.  Thus,  the  steady  state  effects  are  in  most  cases  expected  to  be  somewhat 
more pronounced than indicated by the DDI study results. 
Renal impairment 
The unbound exposure of letermovir was doubled in both moderate and severe renal impairment. One of the 
eight subjects with severe RI had an 8-fold increased unbound exposure.  The reason for the high exposure 
in the patient is unknown. The exposure changes in the renal impairment groups is assessed as not clinically 
relevant  as  it  is  within  target  range.  No  dose  recommendation  can  be  made  in  ESRD  as  there  are  no 
supportive  data  and  as  literature  information  on  effects  on  biliary  secretion  and  UGTs  in  ESRD  does  not 
provide a consistent view 
Hepatic impairment 
The dose investigated in the hepatic impairment study was too low and as the elimination is nonlinear, this is 
of major importance. OATP1B1/3 has been observed to be down-regulated in liver disease. The applicant has 
used PBPK to answer the question. However, use of PBPK for simulating effect of transporter and/or hepatic 
impairment has low confidence in the EU at present and thus cannot be used to answer regulatory questions. 
It is reasonable to believe that the observed effects are worst case scenarios as OATP contribution is lower at 
higher  doses.  Thus,  the  effects  of  mild  and  moderate  hepatic  impairment  are  within  target  range.  This  will 
likely  also  be  the  case  for  oral  letermovir  with  CsA  with  the  recommended  dose  adjustment.  Overall,  the 
handling  of  patients  who  experienced  severe  hepatic  impairment  during  the  Phase  3  study  has  been 
described sufficiently and use of letermovir in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.  
Japanese and Blacks 
The exposure was doubled and dose dependency more pronounced in the Japanese. The higher exposure 
likely lacks clinical relevance. There was no significant difference in exposure of letermovir in black patients. 
Drug-drug interactions 
Mechanistic studies with letermovir as a victim of DDIs 
The  DDI  scenario  is  complex  as  the  effects of  other drugs  on  letermovir  may  be  influenced  by  the mode  of 
administration of letermovir and whether CsA is concomitantly used. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of an 
obtained effect on the letermovir exposure also depends on these factors as the exposure changes considered 
to  be  effective  and  safe  differs  for  the  scenarios.  Oral  letermovir  administered  without  CsA  has  a  lower 
exposure and is thus more sensitive to decreases in exposure but less sensitive to increases. 
The applicant did not perform any mechanistic study providing in vivo support to the elimination pathways of 
letermovir.  The  studies  with  cyclosporine  single-dose  (see  below)  provide  some  support  to  the  OATP 
involvement  but  also  include  the  effect  of  inhibition  of  Pgp  and  BCRP.  Due  to  the  low  exposure,  the  safety 
margins for oral letermovir without CsA are very high and it is unlikely that a DDI though Pgp/BCRP inhibition 
or through OATP inhibition will result in exposures outside this range. 
However,  for  the  other  letermovir  regimens,  the  margins  are  not  as  high,  and  when  combining  letermovir 
with  CsA,  the  multiple  transporter  inhibition  can  give  rise  to  unexpected  increases  in  exposure.  Current 
knowledge is not extensive yet for transporter DDIs and the magnitudes of multiple inhibitions is difficult to 
predict.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 59/124 
 
  
 
 
 
The  applicant  will  perform  a  multiple-dose  study  with  a  strong,  preferably  clinically  relevant,  Pgp/BCRP 
inhibitor  as  a  post-authorisation  measure.  The  inhibitor  exposure  should  be  as  little  as  possible  affected  by 
induction for relevant plasma levels to be obtained. As the safety margin is large for oral letermovir without 
CsA, the scenario of most concern is the effect of Pgp/BCRP inhibitors on oral letermovir combined with CsA, 
a  regimen  where  the  effects  could  be  outside  target  range  due  to  multiple  transporter  inhibition.  The 
applicant will however study the scenario with oral letermovir without CyA. Letermovir 480 mg qd should be 
administered with and without the Pgp/BCRP inhibitor until steady state. If a significant effect is observed in 
this  study,  it  will  be  difficult  to  estimate  the  effect  on  letermovir  when  combined  with  CyA.  This  may  have 
consequences for the SmPC. 
There  are  no  DDI  studies  with  inducers.  As  a  PAM,  the  applicant  will  perform  a  DDI  study  with  rifampicin 
designed to separate induction and OATP inhibition. The proposed design is rifampicin and letermovir multiple 
dose  treatment  for  at  least  10  days,  letermovir  steady  state  sampling  on  the  last  rifampicin  treatment  day 
and on the day after ending rifampicin. The study should start with a single dose of letermovir together with 
rifampicin  followed  by  sampling  for  estimating  AUCinf  before  starting  letermovir/rifampicin  multiple  dose 
treatment.  The  single  dose  part  of  the  study  should  also  contain  some  protein  binding  determinations  to 
support  the  assumption  of  linearity  in  the  protein  binding.  These  two  PAMs  should  include  an  initial  step 
where the study design is submitted and discussed.  
If  OATP1B1/3,  BCRP  or  Pgp  inhibition  should  be  found  to  give  rise  to  significant  increases  in  letermovir 
exposure and it may not be excluded that the DDI will be relevant when letermovir is administered alone of 
with  CsA,  the  applicant  should  perform  in  vitro  studies  to  provide  missing  data  for  the  azole  antifungals 
regarding inhibition of the particular transporter(s). This is also included in the PAM. 
Letermovir as perpetrator of DDIs 
The  DDI  situation  for  letermovir  as  perpetrator  is  also  complex  and  also  here  it  is  dependent  on  mode  of 
letermovir  administration  and  whether  CsA  is  concomitantly  used.  If  the  dose  of  a  drug  is  monitored  and 
titrated,  this  needs  to  be  performed  when  changing  mode  of  administration  and  if  adding  CsA.  In  addition, 
CsA has strong interaction effects of its own, some which are shared also by letermovir leading to additional 
DDI effects.  Letermovir induces enzymes and transporters and also inhibits a number of proteins at in vivo 
relevant concentrations. 
Induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 was observed at relevant concentrations indicating PXR and CAR mediated 
induction. Many enzymes and transporters are induced by these pathways. Moderate induction was confirmed 
in vivo for CYP2C19 (voriconazole) and intestinal Pgp induction was indicated by the results of the interaction 
study  with  digoxin  although  being  a  not  so  sensitive  intestinal  Pgp  probe.  Autoinduction  is  observed  for 
letermovir.  Besides  the  studied  proteins,  inducible  enzymes  and  transporters  include  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, 
CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  the  UGTs,  probably  SULTs,  BCRP,  other  transporters.  It  is  difficult  to  foresee  interactions 
with enzymes and transporters indicated to both inhibited and induced. This is the case for CYP2C8, CYP2B6, 
BCRP,  UGT1A1  and  OATP2B1.  The  net  effect  on  OAT3  may  be  inhibition  as  a  rifampicin-tenofovir  (a  OAT3 
substrate) DDI study showed lack of rifampicin (potent inducer) effect on tenofovir. 
Mechanistic studies with letermovir as a perpetrator of DDIs 
Letermovir  is  a  moderate,  time-dependent,  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4.    240  mg  qd  appears  to  give  moderate 
inhibition.  The  effect  of  iv  treatment  was  small  after  a  short  letermovir  treatment.  It  is  possible  that  the 
steady  state  effect  is  even  smaller.  The  size  of  the  effect  of  480  mg  qd  is  unknown  but  based  on  the 
tacrolimus and sirolimus DDI studies with 480 mg of letermovir, the effect of 480 mg qd would be consistent 
with that of moderate CYP3A inhibition.Letermovir 240 mg BID gave rise to a somewhat reduced exposure of

digoxin and a slower absorption. The effect may be larger on drugs for which intestinal Pgp is more important 
such as dabigatran and sofosbuvir. The effect may not be present for iv administered Letermovir. The effect 
of 480 mg qd may be likely similar to that of 240 mg bid. This is presently unknown. 
Letermovir  is  an  OATP,  BCRP  and  CYP3A  inhibitor.  As  such  it  affects  many  statins.  Letermovir  480  mg  qd 
increased  atorvastatin  exposure  by  230%.  The  maximum  dose  is  therefore  reduced.  A  marked  effect  is 
expected on simvastatin, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Concomitant used of these are “not recommended” in 
the  SmPC.    Statins  treatment  can  generally  be  interrupted  during  the  Letermovir  treatment  (100  days). 
Monitoring  is  advised  for  pravastatin  and  during  concomitant  letermovir  treatment.  For  fluvastatin  it  is  also 
stated  that  a  dose  adjustment  may  be  needed.  Less  marked  effects  are  expected  on  these  two  statins. 
Further restrictions are made when letermovir is combined with CsA. For the CsA combination, atorvastatin, 
simvastatin pitavastatin and rosuvastatin are contraindicated. 
DDI potential with common medications in the target population 
Half the patients in phase III were co-treated with cyclosporine. In phase III, the dose was reduced by 50% 
when  patients  were  co-treated  with  CsA.  The  resulting  exposure  based  on  the  population  PK  analysis  is 
somewhat surprising and in particular patients on oral treatment with letermovir and not receiving CsA have 
a predicted exposure that is 2-3-fold lower than other patients.  
The  patients  are  treated  with  many  co-medications.  The  applicant  has  discussed  likely  DDIs  between 
letermovir and common concomitant medication in the target population. The applicant has defined common 
as  >20%  use  in  phase  III.    The  following  drugs  were  selected:  acyclovir  (77%),  valacyclovir  (33.5%), 
sulphamethoxazole  +  trimethoprim  (64%);  methylprednisolone  (~  33%),  prednisone  (21%),  pantoprazole 
(~48%)  and  omeprazole  (~27%).    The  antifungals  (86%  of  the  patients  received  antifungal  medications, 
including  fluconazole  (46%),  voriconazole  (28%),    posaconazole  (20%),  isavuconazonium  (prodrug  of 
isavuconazole) (0.8%, n=3) and the echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin), were addressed separately.  
The  applicant  was  not  able  to  find  information  regarding  OATP  inhibitory  potential  for  aciclovir  and 
valacyclovir,  methylprednisolone,  sulphamethoxazole,  prednisolone,  pantoprazole  and  the  PPIs.  Thus,  the 
potential  for  an  effect  on  letermovir  by  these  drugs  may  not  be  completely  evaluated.  However,  in  many 
cases,  safety  of  letermovir  in  combination  with  the  drugs  could  be  considered  covered  by  the  clinical  data 
based  on  the  frequent  concomitant  use.  The  exposures  of  markedly  CYP2C19  metabolised  PPIs  are  likely 
reduced and an increase of the dose may be needed based on clinical response. 
There  is  a  risk  of  transient  reduced  exposure  of  ganciclovir  and  cidofovir  (used  in  PET)  due  to  transporter 
involvement in their elimination. However, maintained efficacy is supported by the clinical data.  
Antifungals were used in almost all patients. Voriconazole and in particular fluconazole were commonly used 
in the target patient population. Oral letermovir 480 qd gave rise to an almost 50% reduction in voriconazole 
exposure and TDM is advised. The use of TDM will also likely lead to normalised exposures in PMs. CYP2C19 
PMs will not have a reduction in exposure, but a likely increase due to the CYP3A inhibition. Due to the higher 
exposure  obtained  with  letermovir  po  with  CsA,  letermovir  iv  with  and  without  CsA,  the  induction  may  be 
even  more  pronounced  than  with  letermovir  without  CsA.  Thus,  the  TDM  needs  to  be  performed  when 
changing  regimen.  Voriconazole  is  a  Pgp  inhibitor  in  vitro.  There  is  no  information  on  OATP1B1/3  or  BCRP 
inhibitory potential of voriconazole. Thus, voriconazole could increase letermovir exposure. 
Letermovir  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  posaconazole,  but  will  lead  to  an  increased  exposure  of 
isavuconazole. No DDI is predicted with fluconazole, caspofungin or anidulafungin. Letermovir likely increases 
isavuconazole exposure through CYP3A inhibition. Available data indicate a clinically not relevant increase in 
exposure but it is unknown whether isavuconazole also is transported by OATP1B1/3, which could make the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 61/124 
 
  
DDI more marked. It is not known whether letermovir will give rise to reduced exposures of amphotericin B 
or  micafungin.  In  vitro  transporter  inhibition  data  are  missing  for  many  of  the  antifungals.  If  inhibition  of 
OATP1B1 or Pgp/BCRP is found to affect letermovir exposure to a clinically relevant extent, missing in vitro 
data should be provided for the DDI evaluation. 
There  is  an  uncertainty  whether  the  exposure  of  piperacillin  and  imipenem/cilastatin  related  to  potential 
inducing  effects  on  potential  biliary  secretion  and  metabolism  of  the  drugs.    Available  information  does  not 
indicate an interaction risk with meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, cefepime, vancomycin and ceftazidime. 
There  was  no  effect  of  letermovir  on  acyclovir  in  a  5-day  study.  Acyclovir  is  transported  by  OAT3  but  the 
effect  of  probenecid  does  not  indicate  that  it  is  a  sensitive  marker  for  the  transporter.  However,  it  can 
probably be concluded that letermovir is not a strong inhibitor of OAT3.  
Letermovir  480  mg  qd  gave  rise  to  an  increase  in  ethinylestradiol  and  levonorgestrel  exposure.  The  results 
may  not  be  translated  to  other  contraceptive  steroids,  as  letermovir  is  an  inducer  and  the  net  result  of 
enzyme and transporter inhibition and induction will depend on the particular contribution of these proteins in 
the elimination of each steroid. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  CMV  DNA  terminase  has  been  identified  as  the  target  of  letermovir,  based  on  characterization  of  DNA 
processing, virion maturation and viral resistance mutations in CMV-infected, letermovir-treated cells. As the 
postulated mechanism of action of letermovir is down-stream of DNA synthesis, CMV DNA might not be the 
optimal biomarker for monitoring the efficacy of letermovir prophylaxis. It may be that CMV DNA levels rise, 
but  without  the  output  of  infectious  virions  that  characterizes  virologic  failure.  However,  as  there  are  no 
validated  alternative  biomarkers  or  PET  initiation  thresholds,  the  use  of  CMV  DNA  for  monitoring  and 
standard-of-care PET criteria is endorsed although this could hypothetically be too conservative and result in 
unnecessary termination of letermovir prophylaxis. 
Letermovir has nanomolar EC50 values against laboratory and clinical CMV isolates in cell-culture models of 
infection, with a steep dose-response curve. An UL56 homology search shows very limited homology between 
the  CMV  UL56  and  orthologs  among  other  human  herpesviruses,  supporting  the  claim  that  the  letermovir 
mechanism  of  action  is  CMV  specific.  Also,  in  the  P001  study  similar  rates  of  reactivation  of  other 
herpesviruses were seen in the P001 letermovir and placebo groups. 
Letermovir resistant strains can be selected with unaffected replicative capacity in vitro, but the viral fitness 
in  vivo,  resistance  barrier  and  clinical  impact  remains  to  be  elucidated.  From  the  entries  in  the  NCBI  DNA 
sequence database it seems that the mutants selected in vitro are not common wild-type variants in vivo. 
Because the mode of action of letermovir is distinct from that of approved anti-CMV agents that target CMV 
DNA replication (CDV, GCV, and FOS), cross-resistance is unlikely. Studies with letermovir-resistant mutants 
(with mutations in the CMV UL56 gene) and GCV-resistant mutants (with mutations in the CMV UL54 and/or 
UL97) have confirmed this assumption. 
PD  interaction  studies  were  performed  with  anti  HIV  compounds  targeting  either  the  HIV  protease,  the HIV 
(non-)  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  or  the  HIV  integrase.  These  targets  are  all  viral  proteins.  The 
applicant  regards these  viral  proteins,  albeit  not  terminase  proteins,  more  alike  to the  CMV  terminase,  (the 
target of letermovir) than bacterial, fungal or human proteins which are the targets of antibiotics, antifungals 
and  immune  suppressants.  Since  no  or  only  minor  PD  interactions  between  letermovir  and  anti  HIV  drugs

were  observed,  the  applicant  sees  no  reason  to  conduct  PD  interaction  studies  with  drugs  that  target 
bacterial, fungal or human proteins that are much more different to the letermovir target then viral proteins 
might be. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Letermovir  inhibits  the  viral  terminase  complex,  which  plays  a  key  role  in  cleavage  and  packaging  of  viral 
progeny  DNA,  through  a  mechanism  that  is  CMV  specific  among  human  herpesviruses  and  where  no 
mammalian  counterpart  is  known.  Letermovir  resistant  strains  can  be  selected  with  unaffected  replicative 
capacity  in  vitro but  the  viral  fitness  in  vivo,  resistance  barrier  and  clinical impact  remains  to  be  elucidated 
and the submission of phenotypic resistance data will be included in a post-authorization commitment. 
Letermovir  has  complex  pharmacokinetic  behaviour  that  includes  nonlinear  kinetics,  autoinduction  and  a 
multitude of DDI effects such as enzyme and transporter induction, time dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 and 
inhibition of a large number of enzymes and transporters in vitro that has not been followed up in vivo.  
The  exposure  in  non-CsA  treated  patients  on  oral  letermovir  is  2-3-fold  lower  that  estimated  for  the  other 
letermovir regimens (oral and iv letermovir with CsA, iv letermovir without CsA). This has implications for the 
drug  interaction  potential  for  letermovir  as  perpetrator  and  also  for  clinical  relevance  consequences  of 
changes  in  letermovir  exposure.  The  safety  margins  are  much  higher  for  oral  letermovir  taken  without  CsA 
but the efficacy margins are less generous.  
Studies  investigating  letermovir  as  victim  of  DDIs  are  limited.  Only  one  mechanistic  such  study  (with  CsA) 
has been performed. A DDI study with an inducer is missing as well as a study with a Pgp/BCRP inhibitor. A 
DDI study with rifampicin will be performed as PAM. The study will be designed to measure effects of OATP 
inhibition  separately  from  induction.    A  DDI  study  with  a  Pgp/BCRP  inhibitor  will  be  performed  as  a  PAM 
aiming  to  provide  information  primarily  related  to  the  risk  of  DDI  with  Pgp/BCRP  inhibitors  and  letermovir 
combined  with  CsA.  It  will  also  add  mechanistic  information  on  letermovir  disposition.  Multiple  transporter 
inhibition  may  give  rise  to  unpredictable  DI  effects.  Hence,  translation  of  the  study  results  to  letermovir 
combined with CyA may be challenging. 
Letermovir  inhibits  quite  many  enzymes  and  transporters.  It  inhibits  CYP3A  in  vivo  and  is  also  a  moderate 
general  inducer  in  vivo.  The  patient  population  has  a  substantial  polypharmacy.  DDI  studies  with  common 
comedication  are  missing  in  some  respects.  Induction  affects  both  enzymes  and  transporters  broadly  and 
thus letermovir could give rise to reduced exposures potentially reducing clinical efficacy of other drugs.  
The effects of letermovir on other drugs may differ between letermovir modes of administration and depends 
also  on  whether  CsA  is  coadministered.  Combining  letermovir  with  CsA  will  also  add  to  the  DDI  effects 
through the OATP, BCRP and Pgp inhibition of CsA. This composes a complex DDI scenario to communicate in 
the SmPC.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program included two Phase 2 trials (P019 and P020) and one pivotal Phase 3 trial 
(P001). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
P019  (AIC001-2-001)  was  a  Phase  2a  open-label,  proof-of-concept  trial  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability, 
and  antiviral  activity  of  two  doses  of  letermovir,  40  mg  twice  daily  and  80  mg  QD,  compared  to  an  active 
control  standard-of  care  (valganciclovir)  given  over  a  period  of  14  days  in  27  subjects;  26  were  kidney  or 
kidney/pancreas transplant recipients and 1 was a HSCT recipient. Of the 27 subjects enrolled, 9 each were 
in the 40 mg BID, 80 mg QD, and active control (valganciclovir) groups, respectively.  The trial assessed the 
reduction in CMV DNA in subjects with pre-existing CMV viremia and eligible for PET at trial entry. 
This exploratory study of oral administration of letermovir to a limited number of patients was considered to 
have  provided  proof-of-concept.  Of  the  17  patients  treated  with  letermovir  for  14  days,  13  patients  had  a 
measurable CMV viral load in the plasma CMV PCR evaluation on Day 1, and 10 of these 13 patients showed 
a reduction in plasma CMV PCR on Day 15; the maximum reduction in plasma CMV PCR on Day 15 was 2.6 
log10.  Furthermore,  letermovir  was  used  to  successfully  treat  a  patient  harbouring  a  CMV  strain  multi-
resistant to the marketed anti-CMV drugs ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet. No patients treated during the 
study developed CMV disease. 
For  all  the  treatment  groups,  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  CMV  PCR  plasma  viral  load  was  seen 
between  Days  1  and  15  and  no  statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  between  the  observational 
control  group  and  the  letermovir  treatment  groups  at  Day  15.  It  is  therefore  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of 
letermovir in this open design trial was not significantly different from the observational control group. 
The P019 study provides some insight in viral kinetics when letermovir treatment is initiated in subjects with 
ongoing CMV viremia, but the dose range was significantly lower than what was selected for phase 3.

P020  (AIC246-01-II-02)  was  a  Phase  2b  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  to  evaluate  the 
safety  and  antiviral  activity  of  letermovir  compared  to  placebo  in  133  allogeneic  HSCT  transplant  recipients 
who  were  seropositive  for  CMV  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  antibodies  before  transplantation,  and  had  no 
detectable  CMV  DNA  within  5  days  before  starting  study  medication.  Subjects  were  randomized  to  1  of  3 
different  doses  of  letermovir  (60,  120,  or  240  mg  QD)  or  placebo,  and  treatment  was  given  orally  for  84 
days. In this trial, 131 of the 133 subjects randomized into the trial received study medication, with 31 and 
34  subjects  in  the  120  mg  and  240  mg  groups,  respectively,  and  33  subjects  each  in  the  60  mg  QD 
letermovir  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  This  trial  assessed  prophylaxis  with  letermovir  (compared  to 
placebo) in the prevention of CMV reactivation. 
Following an 84-day treatment period, the incidence of CMV prophylaxis  failure (defined as all patients who 
developed  systemic  detectable  CMV  replication  and/or  CMV  end-organ  disease,  or  discontinued  treatment 
prior  to  Day  84  due  to  other  reasons  [AE,  death,  protocol  non-compliance,  withdrew  consent,  or  other]) 
appeared to decrease across increasing letermovir dose groups (48.5%, 32.3%, and 29.4% of patients in the 
60,  120,  and  240  mg/day  groups,  respectively)  and  was  highest  in  the  placebo  group  (63.6%  of  patients), 
table and figure below. The mean letermovir AUCs, based on the final covariate model presented in the CSR, 
are presented in the following table. 
In the comparison of active treatment groups vs. placebo, a statistically significant reduction in the incidence 
of CMV prophylaxis failure was observed in the 120 mg/day letermovir (p=0.014) and 240 mg/day letermovir 
(p=0.007) groups.

Sensitivity analysis in the per-protocol dataset showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of 
CMV prophylaxis failure in the 240 mg/day letermovir group (p = 0.019). Similar results were observed when 
non-completers due to reasons other than prophylaxis failure were removed from the analysis (p=0.046 and 
p=0.001  in  the  120  and  240  mg/day  letermovir  groups,  respectively),  and  when  controlling  for  centre  and 
country effects.  
No plateau in treatment response was reached before 240 mg. Only patients in the 240 mg group with CsA 
co-administration  (n=18)  are  expected  to  have  had  a  letermovir  exposure  similar  to  what  was  selected  for 
the phase 3 study. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
P001 is a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of letermovir at a dose of 480 mg QD, adjusted to 240 mg QD when co-administered with CsA, 
versus  placebo  in  adult,  CMV-seropositive  allogeneic  HSCT  recipients  (R+).  Treatment  was  administered 
through  Week  14  (~100  days)  post-transplant.  Overall,  570  subjects  were  randomized,  with  376  in  the 
letermovir group and 194 in the placebo group.  This trial assessed prophylaxis with letermovir (compared to 
placebo)  in  the  prevention  of  CMV  reactivation  (i.e.,  prevention  of  clinically  significant  CMV  infection  or 
disease).

Figure 5 
Study overview 
Subjects were monitored for CMV viremia was monitored at weekly intervals during the first 14 weeks post-
transplant. CMV viremia was monitored less frequently thereafter at biweekly intervals through Week 24, as 
the risk for CMV infection and/or disease is considerably reduced during this interval when compared to the 
first 14 weeks post-transplant. 
Patients  were  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  letermovir  or  placebo  at  any  time  from  the  day  of 
transplant  until  28  days  post-transplant.  The  treatment  phase  was  terminated  after  10-14  weeks  of 
prophylaxis (until post-transplant week 14) or when the primary endpoint (clinically significant CMV infection, 
most  often  DNAemia  with  PET-initiation)  was  reached.  As  the  primary  endpoint  was  met  more  often  in  the 
placebo  group,  the  average  number  of  weeks  (and  hence,  exposure)  in  the  treatment  phase  differs 
approximately 25% between study groups. 
Study Participants 
A total of 570 subjects from 67 trial centres in 20 countries were randomized in P001, evaluating letermovir 
in subjects in a population of CMV-seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients (R+). Most subjects were enrolled 
in Europe (50.1%) and North America (41.0%). 
Important inclusion criteria included: 
1.  being ≥18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent. 
2.  had documented seropositivity for CMV (recipient CMV IgG seropositivity [R+]) within 1 year before 
HSCT. 
3.  received a first allogeneic HSCT (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood transplant). 
4.  had undetectable CMV DNA (as confirmed by the central laboratory) from a plasma sample collected 
within 5 days prior to randomization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 67/124 
 
  
 
5.  been within 28 days post-HSCT at the time of randomization. 
Important exclusion criteria included: 
The subject was excluded from participating in the trial if the subject: 
1.  had a history of CMV end-organ disease within 6 months prior to randomization. 
2.  had evidence of CMV viremia (if tested) at any time from either signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF) or the HSCT procedure, whichever was earlier, until the time of randomization. (Note: Evidence 
of CMV viremia as reported by the central laboratory included reporting of test results as “detectable, 
not quantifiable” or “detected” with a numeric value provided.) 
3.  received within 7 days prior to screening or planned to receive during the study any of the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
ganciclovir 
valganciclovir 
foscarnet 
acyclovir (at doses >3200 mg PO per day or >25 mg/kg IV per day) 
valacyclovir (at doses >3000 mg PO per day) 
famciclovir (at doses >1500 mg PO per day) 
4.  had severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child-Pugh Class C; see Appendix 12.5 of the protocol) 
within 5 days prior to randomization. 
5.  had serum aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) >5 x the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) or serum total bilirubin >2.5 x ULN within 5 days prior to randomization. 
6.  had end-stage renal impairment with a creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min, as calculated by 
the Cockcroft-Gault equation using serum creatinine within 5 days prior to randomization. 
7.  had an uncontrolled infection on the day of randomization. 
8.  required mechanical ventilation or was hemodynamically unstable at the time of randomization. 
9.  had a documented positive result for a human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIVAb) test at any 
time prior to randomization, or for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) with detectable HCV 
ribonucleic acid (RNA), or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) within 90 days prior to randomization. 
Of note is that patients with pre-existing CMV viremia (n=84 of 738 screened, 530 included) were not 
included in the study.  
Treatments 
In this study, both oral and IV formulations of letermovir were administered. Note that for this study the IV 
formulation refers to the cyclodextrin-containing IV formulation and the oral formulation refers to the tablets 
administered orally. As conditioning-induced mucositis is expected in this patient group, the iv formulation is 
expected to be of particular value in the first weeks post-transplant. 
Subjects were to initiate study medication as early as the day of transplant, but no later than 28 days post-
transplant.  Study  medication  was  administered  with  or  without  food  and  was  taken  or  administered  at 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017

approximately  the  same  time  each  day.  Interruptions  from  the  protocol-specified  treatment  plan  for  ≥7 
consecutive days required consultation between the investigator and the Sponsor. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective and Hypothesis 
Objective:  To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  letermovir  in  the  prevention  of  clinically  significant  CMV  infection 
through Week 24 (~6 months) post-transplant following administration of letermovir or placebo. 
Hypothesis:  Letermovir  is  superior  to  placebo  in  the  prevention  of  clinically  significant  CMV  infection,  as 
assessed  by  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  CMV  end-organ  disease  or  initiation  of  anti-CMV  PET  based  on 
documented CMV viremia and the subject’s clinical condition through Week 24 (~6 months) post-transplant. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for P001 was the proportion of subjects with clinically significant CMV infection 
through  Week  24  (~6  months)  post-transplant.  Clinically  significant  CMV  infection  was  defined  as  the 
occurrence of either one or the following outcomes: 
- 
onset of CMV end-organ disease 
OR 
- 
initiation  of  anti-CMV  PET  based  on  documented  CMV  viremia  (as  measured  by  the  central 
laboratory)  and  the  clinical  condition  of  the  subject.  Initiation  of  PET  in  the  trial  referred  to 
the  practice  of  initiating  therapy  with  the  following  anti-CMV  agents  when  active  CMV  viral 
replication was documented: GCV, VGCV, foscarnet, and/or cidofovir. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
1.  Proportion  of  subjects  with  clinically  significant  CMV  infection  through  Week  14  (~100  days)  post-
transplant:  For  this  endpoint,  case  counting  used  the  same  definition  as  in  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint. 
Exploratory Endpoints included 
1.  Proportion of subjects with CMV disease through Week 48 post-transplant 
2.  Proportion  of  subjects  with  all-causes  mortality  through  Week  14  post-transplant,  Week  24  post-
transplant, and Week 48 post-transplant 
3.  Proportion  of  subjects  with  opportunistic  infection  other  than  CMV  infection  (i.e.,  systemic  bacterial 
and invasive fungal infection) through Week 14 post-transplant, Week 24 post-transplant, and Week 
48 post-transplant 
4.  Proportion  of  subjects  with  acute  and/or  chronic  GVHD  after  randomization  through  Week  14  post-
transplant, Week 24 post-transplant, and Week 48 post-transplant 
5.  Antiviral resistance to letermovir in prophylaxis failures

The  study  definition  of  clinically  significant  CMV  infection  is  considered  to  be  rather  liberal.  In  the  vast 
majority of cases this criterion is fulfilled by patients initiating pre-emptive ganciclovir therapy based on low-
level  viremia,  making  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  largely  measures  of  the  ganciclovir-saving 
potential of letermovir. This could be of clinical importance due to the safety profile of ganciclovir, but this is 
already to some extent mitigated by the pre-emptive protocol where a majority of patients will have left the 
most  critical  period  post-transplant  (before  and  during  engraftment,  where  myelotoxicity  is  a  particular 
concern) before initiating pre-emptive therapy. 
Of note, all endpoints related to mortality are exploratory. 
Sample size, Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
A  total  of  570  HSCT  recipients  were  randomized  in a  2:1  ratio to  receive letermovir  or placebo  at  any  time 
from the day of transplant until 28 days post-transplant.  
Randomised subjects were stratified by 1) trial centre and 2) risk for CMV reactivation in order to balance any 
effects  of  these  variables  on  letermovir  safety  and  efficacy  across  treatment  groups.  Clinical  practice  with 
regards to HSCT (conditioning regimen used, source of stem cell and immunosuppressant regimen used for 
prevention  and/or  treatment  of  GVHD)  varies  widely  across  centres  and  regions  worldwide.  Among  HSCT 
recipients,  there  is  considerable  variability  in  the  risk  for  CMV  reactivation.  Two  categories  of  risk  groups 
were identified for stratification based on available literature and input from external experts on the Scientific 
Advisory Committee (SAC) as follows: 
1.  High risk: Subjects meeting one or more of the following criteria at the time of randomization: 
-  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related (sibling) donor with at least one mismatch at one of 
the following three HLA-gene loci: HLA-A, -B or –DR, 
-  Haploidentical donor, 
-  Unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA-gene loci: HLA-
A, -B, -C and -DRB1, 
-  Use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source, 
-  Use of ex vivo T-cell-depleted grafts (including ex vivo use of alemtuzumab), 
-  Grade 2 or greater GVHD, requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (defined as the use of 
≥1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid). 
2.  Low risk: All subjects not meeting the definition of high risk. 
The study was double blind. 
Statistical methods 
Study P001 had a primary follow-up period through Week 24 post-transplant with the primary analysis to be 
performed when this period had completed; all available data after week 24 pertaining to mortality and CMV 
disease  was  to  be  provided.  Analyses  were  performed  according  to  protocol  and  supplementary  statistical 
analysis plan.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017

The primary hypothesis was evaluated by comparing letermovir to placebo in the proportion of subjects with 
clinically  significant  CMV  infection  through  Week  24  post-transplant  in  the  FAS  population.  Other  efficacy 
analyses were considered supportive and/or explanatory. 
The FAS consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had no 
detectable CMV viral DNA (measured by the central laboratory) on Day 1 when study therapy was initiated. A 
sensitivity analysis including those subjects who had detectable CMV viral DNA on Day 1 was to be provided.  
The  primary  missing  data  approach  was  the  Non-Completer=Failure  approach.  Non-completers  referred  to 
subjects  who  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study.  A  subject  who  discontinued  study  medication  but 
remained  in  the  study  follow-up  was  not  to  be  considered  as  a  non-completer.  A  secondary  missing  data 
approach  was  the  Data-As-Observed  (DAO);  any  subject  with  missing  value  for  a  particular  endpoint  was 
excluded from the analysis. For the time-to-event analyses, subjects were to be censored at last assessment. 
All-cause mortality was defined as an exploratory endpoint and the proportion of all-cause deaths at different 
time-points  was  only  to  be  displayed  by  treatment  group  using  summary  statistics  and  95%  confidence 
interval.  Kaplan-Meier  plots  was  (according  to  the  SAP)  to  be  provided  but  only  for  the  two  exploratory 
endpoints that initially had been defined as time-to-event endpoints (i.e. time to documented viremia and the 
time  to  onset  of  engraftment  through  Week  24  post-transplant).  The  analyses  presented  (see  under 
“Results”)  are  hence  not  according  to  what  was  initially  planned  with  comparisons  between  the  treatment 
arms  seemingly  post-hoc.  The  additional  analyses  of  mortality  not  only  all-cause,  but  also  non-relapse  and 
CMV-related  mortality,  including  treatment  group  comparisons  and  performed  when  all  subjects  had  either 
completed  or  discontinued  from  the  trial  (described  in  a  separate  document)  was  seemingly  data  driven  as 
justified  by  the  results  from  the  primary  analysis  of  study  P001  indicating  “the  potential  for  letermovir 
prophylaxis  to  provide  a  significant  mortality  benefit  over  placebo  at  week  48  post-transplant”.  Although 
supported that provided, these analyses can formally only be considered exploratory and hence not serve as 
firm evidence for any claims.

Numbers analysed 
Table 26  Subject Accounting for Efficacy Analyses (All Randomized Subjects) 
In  addition  to  patients  who  were  excluded  at  screening  due  to  a  positive  CMV  DNA,  12.8%  and  11.3%  of 
randomised  subjects  in  the  letermovir  and  the  placebo  group  respectively  were  excluded  from  the  FAS 
population due to positive CMV DNA at Day 1. The proportion of patients with detectable CMV DNA at Day 1 
was hence fairly balanced and slightly less than expected and accounted for in the estimation of the sample 
size (i.e. 15%). See further below regarding this subset of patients 
Outcomes and estimation 
Letermovir  showed  superior  efficacy  over  placebo  in  the  primary  endpoint  analysis,  as  well  as  in  several 
secondary endpoints closely related to the primary endpoint. A lower proportion of subjects in the letermovir

group (37.5%) developed clinically significant CMV infection compared to the placebo group (60.6%) through 
Week 24 post-transplant (FAS population, NC=F approach). The estimated difference (95% CI) of -23.5% (-
32.5%,  -14.6%),  adjusted  for  the  stratification  factor  of  high  versus  low  risk  for  CMV  reactivation,  was 
statistically significant (1-sided p value <0.0001).

 † 95% CIs and p-value for the treatment differences in percent response were calculated using stratum-adjusted Mantel-
Haenszel method with the difference weighted by the harmonic mean of sample size per arm for each stratum ( high or 
low risk). A 1-sided p-value ≤0.0249 was used for declaring statistical significance for primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint. Nominal two-sided p-values (not adjusted for multiplicity) are provided for other analyses as a measure of the 
strength of the relationship between treatment and response. 
 ‡ Approach to handling missing values: Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach. With NC=F approach, failure was 
defined as all subjects who developed clinically significant CMV infection or prematurely discontinued from the study or 
had a missing outcome through Week 24/Week 14 post-transplant visit window. 
 § Approach to handling missing values: Data-as-Observed (DAO) approach. With DAO approach, any subject with missing 
value for a particular endpoint was excluded from the analysis. 
 N = Number of subjects in analysis population. 
 n = Number of subjects with outcome.

 ‡ Clinically significant CMV infection was defined as CMV end organ disease or initiation of 
PET based on documented CMV viremia and the clinical condition of the subject. 
 § 95% CIs and p-value for the treatment differences in percent response were calculated 
using stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel method with the difference weighted by the 
harmonic mean of sample size per arm for each stratum (high or low risk). A 1-sided p-value 
≤0.0249 was used for declaring statistical significance. 
 Note: Approach to handling missing values: Non-Completer=Failure (NC=F) approach. With 
NC=F approach, failure was defined as all subjects who developed clinically significant CMV 
infection or prematurely discontinued from the study or had a missing outcome through Week 
24 post-transplant visit window.

Subjects excluded from the FAS population due to detectable CMV DNA on Day 1 
The subjects that were excluded in the primary analysis due to detectable CMV viral DNA on Day 1 have been 
analysed  separately.  A  lower  proportion  of  subjects  with  detectable  CMV  viral  DNA  on  Day  1  developed 
clinically significant CMV infection in the letermovir group (64.6%) compared to the placebo group (90.9%) 
through Week 24 post-transplant. The estimated difference (95% CI for the difference) was -26.1% (-45.9%, 
-6.3%), with a nominal one-sided p-value <0.0048. 
Table 29  
Analysis of Proportion of Subjects with Clinically Significant CMV Infection Through 
Week 24 Post-Transplant Only Subjects with Detectable CMV Viral DNA on Day 1(NC=F 
Approach 
The difference between treatment groups regarding the primary endpoint is driven by a difference in the rate 
of  PET  initiation,  showing  the  ganciclovir-saving  potential  of  letermovir.  This  could  have  a  direct  impact  for 
patients,  reducing  the  need  for  re-hospitalization  as  PET  is  most  commonly  initiated  with  intravenous 
ganciclovir. A lower use of ganciclovir could also result in a total reduction of CMV-treatment-related adverse 
events,  given  that  the  safety  profile  of  letermovir  is  more  beneficial  when  used  in  a  prophylactic  regimen 
compared to ganciclovir-based PET. 
The analysis based on all randomised and treated subjects, i.e. nd including those with detectable CMV Viral 
DNA on Day 1 showed a  very similar outcome. The proportion of failures was 41.0% (153/373) and 64.1% 
(123/192) in the letermovir and placebo arm respectively. The stratum-adjusted difference between the two 
arms was; -23.6 (-31.9, -15.2); p>0.0001. 
In  clinical  practice  some  patients  will  end  up  in  a  similar  situation  to  those  that  had  started  letermovir 
prophylaxis  but  were  excluded  from  the  FAS  population  due  to  a  positive  CMV  DNA  screening  result  in  a

sample  taken  before  initiation  of  letermovir.  Of  note,  the  absolute  efficacy  of  letermovir  in  subjects  with 
positive  CMV-DNA  on  Day  1  is  clearly  lower  than  in  those  without  Day  1  viremia  but  the  numerical  relative 
difference to placebo is similar. Confounding by factors related to immune status cannot be excluded.

The KM plot shows a clear difference in time to onset of CMV infection between letermovir and placebo until 
Week 14, with some catch-up when letermovir is discontinued. However, the clinical implication of CMV 
reactivation is depending on the immune status of the patient. Most, if not all, CMV R+ patients are expected 
to present with CMV DNAemia at some time point post-transplant, but the de-escalation of CMV PCR 
monitoring within this study (and in current clinical practice) means that not all subjects (mostly low-risk) will 
be tested when this occurs. 
Subgroup analyses 
Forest plots were used to assess the consistency of the treatment effect of letermovir in P001 across various 
subgroups  (FAS  population)  based  on  risk  categories  for  CMV  reactivation  (risk  stratum,  stem  cell  source,

degree  of  donor  mismatch,  haploidentical  transplantation),  subject  characteristics  (age,  gender,  weight, 
region,  time  of  randomization  from  the  day  of  transplantation),  and  conditioning  and  concomitant 
immunosuppressive regimen (CsA-containing and tacrolimus-containing) used.  
Overall,  the  treatment  effect  consistently  favored  letermovir  across  subgroups  based  on  subject  baseline, 
epidemiological and clinical characteristics.

Figure 9 Proportion of Subjects with Clinically Significant CMV Infection 
Through Week 24 Post-Transplant by Conditioning Regimen and Immunosuppressive Therapy 
Subgroups (NC=F, FAS Population) 
Differences between letermovir and placebo groups were overall consistent across clinical and epidemiological 
subgroups, although confidence intervals widen in groups with limited data.  
Factors associated with CMV DNAemia up to week 14 (in 13 of 25 cases more than 2 weeks after cessation of 
letermovir)  included  high  risk  for  CMV  reactivation  at  baseline  and  absence  of  GVHD  but  number  are  to 
limited  to  draw  conclusions  regarding  on-treatment  failures.  Factors  associated  with  CMV  DNAemia  after 
cessation  of  letermovir  prophylaxis  up  to  Week  24  post-transplant  among  letermovir-treated  subjects 
included  high  risk  for  CMV  reactivation  at  baseline,  GVHD,  use  of  corticosteroids  and  CMV  positive  donor 
serostatus. Besides a partial correlation to CMV donor serostatus no other factors were identified that could 
explain the apparent moderate difference in treatment effect between men and women. 
CMV donor serostatus has previously been identified as an important risk factor for CMV viremia post HSCT 
also in CMV R+ subjects. In the P001 study, receiving an HSCT from a CMV seropositive donor was correlated 
to a lower the risk for CMV DNAemia in the range of 10-15% in both letermovir and placebo groups. Although 
not formally related to letermovir treatment, this baseline factor is of clinical importance and is described in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Efficacy in relation to exposure and mode of administration 
When comparing letermovir subgroups with immunosuppressive regimens based on CsA vs tacrolimus, there 
is a notable numerical difference in risk reduction. Also, exposure is clearly lower in subjects receiving per 
oral letermovir without CsA. For the 240 mg and 480 mg tablet groups, AUC is approximately 61% and 34% 
of that generated by the 480 mg iv formulation, respectively.

It is noted that all subjects with virologic failure were receiving letermovir orally. However, this was also the 
dominating route of administration in the study. 
The clinical efficacy of the 480 mg oral regimen (without CsA) is numerically lower when comparing the 
primary endpoint during the treatment phase using a data-as-observed approach, which would be the most 
relevant measure of the risk for virologic failure. However, when comparing the primary endpoint at 24 
Weeks post-transplant, efficacy is similar to all other regimens. With only 12 on-treatment failures to 
analyse, random effects cannot be excluded. 
When analysing the primary endpoint in relation to AUC quartiles during the on-treatment phase, using a 
data-as-observed approach, the failure rate in the 4th quartile is numerically lower. This could point towards a 
dynamic dose-response trend in the exposure interval observed in the P001 study, but given the low number 
of true on-treatment failures it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions. When analysing the primary 
endpoint at 24 weeks post-transplant, there are no obvious differences between AUC quartiles with regards 
to the primary endpoint. Given the unexpectedly low AUC generated by the 480 mg tablet, limitations in 
modelling predictions and the relative complicated interaction profile of letermovir, it might be that not all

patients receiving the 480 mg tablet (without CsA) will be above EC90 for an adequate time in clinical 
practice. This could be of particular importance in a situation with DDI perpetrators lowering the letermovir 
AUC. 
Whether the low exposure could still be associated with an increased risk of treatment-associated RAVs 
cannot be formally excluded until the phenotypic resistance testing is completed.  
Secondary endpoints 
Due to the very limited numbers of subjects with CMV end-organ disease, the group with “Initiation of PET for 
documented CMV viremia” is very closely related to the subjects with “Clinically significant CMV infection” and 
are therefore not presented in further detail.  
Overall,  the  incidence  of  CMV  end-organ  disease  in  the  FAS  population  was  low  through  both  the  Week  14 
and Week 24 post-transplant time points, with only 8 cases of confirmed end-organ disease through Week 24 
post-transplant. 
Figure 10  Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to Onset of CMV End-organ Disease Through Week 24 Post-
Transplant (FAS Population) 
Three  subjects  developed  CMV  end-organ  disease  through  Week  14  post-transplant:    1  subject  in  the 
letermovir group and 2 subjects in the placebo group.  All 3 subjects had gastrointestinal (GI) disease. The 
estimated difference (95% CI) in treatment groups was -1.0% (-3.5%, 1.5%) with a nominal 1-sided p-value 
of 0.2258. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 87/124 
 
  
 
 
 
An additional 5 subjects developed CMV end-organ disease through Week 24 post-transplant for a total of 8 
subjects (5 [2.0%] in the letermovir group and 3 [2.4%] in the placebo group). The additional 5 subjects had 
GI CMV end-organ disease. The estimated difference (95% CI) between treatment groups was 0.4% (-4.0%, 
3.2%), with a nominal 1-sided p value of 0.4056.  
The  low  incidence  of  subjects  with  CMV  end-organ  disease  was  expected  in  P001  since  subjects  who 
developed “clinically significant CMV infection” (mostly low-grade CMV DNAemia) were treated with PET and 
hence  not  expected  to  progress  to  developing  CMV  disease.  Although  numbers  are  limited  and  differences 
non-significant,  the  rate  of  CMV  end-organ  disease  were  numerically  lower  in  the  letermovir  group  at week 
14.  
There  is  an  apparent  catch-up  in  the  letermovir  group  between  weeks  14  and  24,  both  in  terms  of  CMV 
DNAemia  and  CMV  disease,  when  prophylaxis  is  discontinued.  GVHD,  use  of  corticosteroids,  high  risk 
classification  at  baseline  and  negative  CMV  donor  serostatus  were  identified  as  independent  factors  for 
meeting  the  primary  endpoint  during  weeks  14-24.  However,  as  the  clinical  consequences  of  CMV 
reactivation in general are decreasing with time post HSCT (and most, if not all, R+ patients will experience 
CMV DNAemia at some time before cellular immunity is sufficiently restored) this is not fully translatable into 
clinical benefit and the lack of efficacy and safety data for extended use of letermovir beyond Day 100 post 
HSCT must be clear to the prescribers.

 n (%) = Number (percent) of subjects in each sub-category. 
Mortality data is available for 97.2% of the FAS population. This is acceptable, although it is noteworthy that 
vital status could not be clarified for all subjects included in the study. 
All-cause mortality was an exploratory endpoint and no approach to the statistical analysis was pre-specified. 
The observed cumulative incidence of death week 24 was 12.3% (40/325) in the letermovir group and 18.8% 
(32/170)  in  the  placebo  group;  at  week  48,  it  was  23.4%  (76/325)  in  the  letermovir  group  and  27.1% 
(46/170) in the placebo group.

CMV-related mortality 
It must be taken into consideration that all analyses of mortality in this single study phase 3 programme are 
exploratory. The mode of analysis as well as type 1 error control was not pre-specified. 
The  MAA  has  provided  KM-plots  regarding  CMV-related  mortality  (data  not  shown).  However,  the  definition 
used was “death due to any reason in subjects who met the primary endpoint”. In most cases the cause of 
death  is  unrelated  to  CMV  infection.  As  the  incidence  of  CMV  infection  is  highly  skewed  between  study 
groups, introducing unacceptable bias and connecting deaths with often unrelated CMV DNAemia, these data 
are not considered scientifically sound and are omitted from the assessment report. 
A  more  interesting  analysis  of  the  impact  of  CMV  reactivation  on  mortality  is  the  post-hoc  analysis  of  all-
cause  mortality  through  Week  48  post-transplant,  in  relation  to  whether  the  primary  endpoint  was  met 
through Week 24. Among subjects with clinically significant CMV infection through Week 24 the mortality rate 
in the letermovir vs. placebo groups was 21.1% vs. 33.8%; and among subjects without clinically significant 
CMV  infection,  the  mortality  rate  in  the  letermovir  vs.  placebo  groups  was  23.9%  vs.  22.2%.  Seemingly, 
subjects  failing  letermovir  prophylaxis  (often  post  Day  100)  presents  with  an  all-cause  mortality  rate 
comparable to study subjects without clinically significant CMV infection. This illustrates the potential benefit 
of  letermovir,  in  delaying  the  onset  of  CMV  reactivation  to  a  phase  where  the  patient  is  less  fragile  and 
Assessment report

immunologically  more  competent.  Subjects  failing  letermovir  prophylaxis  are  expected  to  be  selected  on 
negative  covariates  compared  to  those  failing  placebo;  hence,  the  comparison  should  if  anything 
underestimate the benefit of letermovir.

group,  while  the  median  is  however  similar  between  groups.  Given  the  variability  of  data,  the  overall 
differences are negligible and do not clearly indicate that letermovir prophylaxis will reduce the overall need

of in-patient care compared to a standard-of-care PET approach. 
Resistance 
In  order  to  identify  CMV  variants  that  may  be  associated  with  a  change  in  susceptibility  to  letermovir 
(compared to a reference strain) in subjects failing CMV prophylaxis, genotypic analyses were conducted on 
subjects who met the primary endpoint of clinically significant CMV infection through Week 24 post-transplant 
with documented CMV viremia, and had a plasma sample available for CMV UL56 / UL89 Genotypic Analysis.  
Table 40 Prevalence of UL56 and UL89 Genotypic Variants for Subjects Who Received Letermovir 
or Placebo (Full Analysis Set; GAP) 
The number of letermovir subjects in the FAS GAP with previously characterized, letermovir-resistant GVs is 
listed below. There are 19 UL56 GVs that have previously been shown to shift the EC50 for letermovir ≥ 1.6-
fold  in  cell-culture  models  of  CMV  infection.  These  characterized  GVs  map  to  11  different  amino  acids 
between residues 231 to 369 of the UL56 protein; this region has been described as the letermovir resistance 
“hot spot”.  
The overall rate of UL56 and UL89 polymorphisms are comparable between study groups. However, given the 
length of the sequence this is a highly insensitive measure of resistance development. 
Hitherto, two different RAVs have been identified in the GAP; UL56 V236M was detected in one subject, and 
UL56  C325W  was  detected  in  the  other  subject.    These  substitutions  are  both  in  the  UL56  letermovir 
resistance “hot spot” (AA 231-369), and both are at residues where mutations were previously seen following 
resistance selection in cell-culture models of infection. 
Given  the  novel  mechanism  of  action  and  limited  experience  from  virologic  failure  in  vivo,  also  GVs  outside 
the identified “hot spot” should be carefully assessed for potential impact on virologic control. 
- V236M is a highly relevant RAV (fold change ~ 50). 
- N446del, N446S and A464T are more common in subjects failing letermovir than placebo, but numbers are 
too  limited  to  allow  any  conclusion  without  comparison  to  baseline  CMV  genotype  and  prior  to  phenotypic 
characterization of virologic failure strains. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 94/124 
 
  
 
-  Deviations  at  UL56  positions  425  and  586  are  highly  frequent  in  both  letermovir  and  placebo  groups, 
illustrating that the reference CMV strain used is not completely representative of the clinical isolates, at least 
not those reactivating post HSCT.  
The  Applicant  has  clarified  that there  were  no  study  protocol  defined  collection  of  baseline  samples  suitable 
for  CMV  isolation,  but  are  analyzing  those  that  are  available.  This,  in  adjunction  with  the  phenotypic 
resistance data should be submitted to address CHMP recommendation.  
Summary of main study 
Letermovir  demonstrated  superior  efficacy  over  placebo  in  the  primary  endpoint  analysis,  as  a  lower 
proportion  of  subjects  in  the  letermovir  group  (37.5%)  developed  clinically  significant  CMV  infection 
compared to the placebo group (60.6%) through Week 24 post-transplant (FAS population, NC=F approach). 
The estimated difference (95% CI) of -23.5% (-32.5%, -14.6%), adjusted for the stratification factor of high 
versus low risk for CMV reactivation, was statistically significant (1-sided p value <0.0001). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There  were  a  limited  number  of  subjects  above  65  years  (n=55),  and  only  one  subject  above  75.  This  is 
acceptable,  given  the  currently  proposed  indication  where  local  practice  guidelines  regarding  age  limits  for 
allogenic HSCT are likely to limit the use of letermovir in elderly subjects. As the pharmacologic target is of 
viral  origin  the  pharmacodynamic  response  is  not  expected  to  differ  in  the  elderly  population  per  se,  given 
that exposure is similar. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Letermovir  introduces  a  completely  new  mechanism  of  action  in  the  prophylaxis  of  CMV  reactivation  and 
disease,  targeting  the  CMV  UL56/UL89  terminase  complex.  Biochemical  characterization  and  electron 
microscopy  suggest  that  letermovir  affects  the  formation  of  proper  unit  length  genomes  from  viral  DNA 
concatemers  and  interferes  with  virion  maturation.  According  to  the  Applicant,  letermovir  administration 
leads  to  a  cessation  of  the  production  of  infectious  viral  particles  but  allows  DNA  synthesis  to  occur,  thus 
providing DNA copies that could be detected by CMV DNA assays. It is not clear whether this is applicable to 
analyses of clinical plasma, as circulating virions are considered the major source of CMV DNA. However, as 
there are no validated alternative biomarkers or PET initiation thresholds, the use of CMV DNA for monitoring 
and  standard-of-care  PET  criteria  is  endorsed  although  this  could  hypothetically  be  too  conservative  and 
result in unnecessary termination of letermovir prophylaxis. 
Favourable  safety  data  from  studies  in  phase  1  and  2  allowed  for  a  prophylactic  approach  in  the  phase  3 
program, in contrast to current clinical practice where ganciclovir/valganciclovir is mainly used in pre-emptive 
and  therapeutic  settings  due  to  safety  issues.  Patients  with  pre-existing  viremia  have  however  not  been 
included  in  the  study  or  excluded  from  the  efficacy  analysis  population  (FAS),  depending  on  whether  CMV 
DNA was detected before enrolment or after enrolment but prior to initiation of letermovir prophylaxis.  
The phase 3 program consists of a single multicentre study (P001), enrolling a total of 570 CMV seropositive 
subjects  planned  for  allogenic  stem  cell  transplant,  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  letermovir  or  placebo.  The 
primary  endpoint  is  “clinically  significant  CMV  infection”  at  24  weeks  post-transplant,  where  letermovir 
provides  a  statistically  significant  reduction  from  60.6  to  37.5%  of  subjects  compared  to  placebo.  The 
difference is consistent across epidemiological and clinical subgroups. However, the P001 study definition of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 95/124 
 
  
clinically significant CMV infection is liberal; in the vast majority of cases this criterion is fulfilled by patients 
initiating  pre-emptive  ganciclovir  therapy  based  on  low-level  viremia,  making  the  primary  and  secondary 
endpoints largely measures of the ganciclovir-saving potential of letermovir. This is expected to be of clinical 
importance due to the safety profile of ganciclovir, but is already to some extent mitigated by the currently 
used pre-emptive protocol where a majority of patients will have left the most critical period post-transplant 
(before  and  during  engraftment,  where  myelotoxicity  is  a  particular  concern)  before  initiating  pre-emptive 
therapy with ganciclovir. A reduction in the need of pre-emptive therapy could however reduce the need for 
re-hospitalization, as PET is most commonly initiated with iv ganciclovir, but there were no clear differences 
in  total  in-patient  care  between  letermovir  and  placebo  groups.  See  the  discussion  on  clinical  safety  for 
further details. 
The rates of CMV end-organ disease were overall low, though numerically lower in the letermovir arm while 
on-treatment  (up  to  14  weeks  post-transplant).  Although  numbers  are  limited  and  differences  non-
significant, there is an apparent catch-up in the letermovir group between weeks 14 and 24 when prophylaxis 
is  discontinued  with  the  occurrence  of  a  few  new  cases  of  gastrointestinal  CMV  disease  in  the  letermovir 
group.  Possibly,  in  a  subset  of  patients,  additional  clinical  benefit  could  be  expected  from  prolonged 
letermovir  prophylaxis  beyond  week  14  post-transplant  but  no  clinical  data  from  prolonged  prophylaxis  are 
available to make a recommendation. 
It is noted that all subjects with virologic failure were receiving letermovir orally. However, this was also the 
dominating  route  of  administration  in  the  study.  The  clinical  efficacy  of  the  480  mg  oral  regimen  (without 
CsA) is numerically lower when comparing the primary endpoint during the treatment phase using a data-as-
observed  approach,  which  would  be  the  most  relevant  measure  of  the  risk  for  virologic  failure.  However, 
when comparing the primary endpoint at 24 Weeks post-transplant, efficacy is similar to all other regimens. 
With only 12 on-treatment failures to analyse, random effects cannot be excluded.  
When  analysing  the  primary  endpoint  in  relation  to  AUC  quartiles  during  the  on-treatment  phase,  using  a 
data-as-observed approach, the failure rate in the 4th quartile (highest exposure) is numerically lower. This 
could point towards a dynamic dose-response trend in the exposure interval observed in the P001 study, but 
given  the  low  number  of  true  on-treatment  failures  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any  definitive  conclusions.  When 
analysing the primary endpoint at 24 weeks post-transplant, there are no obvious differences between AUC 
quartiles with regards to the primary endpoint, but this analysis is less sensitive. Whether the low exposure 
could  still  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  treatment-associated  RAVs  cannot  be  formally  excluded 
until the phenotypic resistance testing is completed.  
In  subjects  failing  letermovir  prophylaxis  where  CMV  DNA  could  be  successfully  sequenced,  two  patients 
presented  with  known  resistance-associated  polymorphisms.  In  addition,  a  number  of  genetic  variants  that 
has not been associated with reduced susceptibility to letermovir were found. The current presentation of the 
virologic  dataset  however  lacks  baseline  sequencing  and  phenotypic  resistance  testing,  limiting  the 
conclusions  that  can  be  drawn,  and  this  issue  will  not  be  completely  resolved  within  this  procedure  but  is 
referred to an post-authorization commitment. 
All-cause mortality was an exploratory endpoint, with no statistical analysis plan pre-specified; furthermore, 
vital  status  data  were  not  systematically  gathered  during  the  study..  The  observed  cumulative  incidence  of 
death  week  24  was  12.3%  (40/325)  in  the  letermovir  group  and  18.8%  (32/170)  in  the  placebo  group;  at 
week  48,  it  was  23.4%  (76/325)  in  the  letermovir  group  and  27.1%  (46/170)  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
distribution  of  time  to  all-cause  mortality  through  Week  24  was  slightly  lower  in  the  letermovir  group 
(nominal  two-sided  log-rank  p-value=0.0401,  not  controlled  for  multiplicity),  but  the  difference  was  not 
significant at Week 48.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 96/124 
 
  
An  interesting  finding  is  the  impact  of  CMV  reactivation  on  mortality  in  subjects  who  presented  with  a 
clinically  significant  CMV  infection  through  week  24.  Patients  failing  letermovir  prophylaxis  (or  within  10 
weeks after discontinuation) have an estimated mortality at 48 weeks that is numerically lower compared to 
those in the placebo group who present with clinically significant CMV infection (21.1 vs 33.8%). This results 
in a rate comparable to study subjects without clinically significant CMV infection in the letermovir arm, and 
may illustrate the potential benefit of letermovir in delaying the onset of CMV reactivation to a phase where 
the  patient  is less  fragile and  more  immunocompetent.  Subjects  failing letermovir  prophylaxis  are  expected 
to  be  selected  on  negative  covariates  compared  to  those  failing  placebo;  hence,  this  comparison  could 
underestimate  the  benefit  of  letermovir.  On  the  other  hand,  as  there  is  no  demonstration  that  these 
differences were due to CMV disease, this line of reasoning remains speculative. 
To summarise, it must be taken into consideration that all analyses of mortality in this single study phase 3 
program  are  exploratory  and  neither  the  mode  of  analysis  or  type  1  error  control  were  pre-specified  in  the 
statistical analysis plan. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The use of letermovir prophylaxis until 14 weeks post allogenic stem cell transplant is effective in postponing 
CMV  reactivation  in  CMV  seropositive  patients.  However,  the  ultimate  benefit  to  patients  is  currently  less 
well-established but could, with regards to efficacy, potentially consist of a reduction of days in hospital post-
transplant and decreased morbidity and mortality related directly or indirectly to CMV reactivation. This has 
however not been unambiguously shown in the P001 study, but as CMV reactivation is widely accepted as the 
cause  of  CMV-related  disease  during  the  first  100  days  post-HSCT  it  can  be  concluded  that  letermovir 
provides a clinical benefit to this patient group. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The dose proposed for clinical use, i.e. 480 mg, or 240 mg when CsA is part of co-treatment, was given to 
373 patients in phase 3 (14 weeks), 18 patients in study P020 (phase 2, 14 days treatment). In addition 362 
phase 1 subjects received this dose, mostly as single dose. 
A dose higher than 480 mg qd was given to 86 subjects in phase 1, of whom 17 received such a dose for >10 
days.  
The  mean  and  median  duration  of  letermovir  treatment  in  the  phase  3  study  was  69  and  82  days  for  both 
formulations combined (around 2 weeks for the IV formulation).

Adverse events 
Introduction 
The focus of this section is the safety outcomes in the conducted phase 3 study. The All Subjects as Treated 
(ASaT) population was used for the analysis of safety data (all randomized subjects who received at least one 
dose  of  study  medication).  Short  notes  on  some  safety  findings  in  the  dose  finding  study  are  also  provided 
(P020,  phase  2,  where  letermovir  dosing  of  60  mg  qd,  120  mg  qd  and  240  mg  qd  over  12  weeks  was 
compared to placebo, with around 30 patients per arm). 
In the phase 3 study patients were randomized to letermovir or placebo (2:1). The IV and oral route could be 
used, according to the need as deemed by the investigator. 
Treatment  was  given  for a  maximum  of  14  weeks,  and  had  to  be  started  within  28  days  post-transplant  at 
the latest. In the case of CMV infection/disease (see efficacy section), treatment with letermovir/placebo was 
stopped  (and  not  re-initiated  thereafter),  and  CMV  treatment  (valganciclovir,  ganciclovir,  cidofovir  or 
foscarnet)  was  initiated  in  accordance  with  common  clinical  practice.  The  “treatment  phase”  applies  to 
therapy with letermovir/placebo. 
Monitoring of Adverse Events in the Phase 3 Trial (P001) 
From  the  time  informed  consent  was  signed  until  randomization,  the  following  AEs were  reported:  those 
resulting from protocol-specified procedures or intervention, those resulting in death, and those resulting in a 
subject not being randomized.  
After  randomization  and  initiation  of  study  medication,  AE  monitoring  included  the  collection  of  all  AEs 
through Week 16 post-transplant in all subjects, including those who discontinued study medication early but 
continued  to  be  followed-up  in  the  trial.  Thereafter,  only  drug-related  SAEs  and  SAEs  with  a  fatal  outcome 
were  collected  through  Week  48  post-transplant.  The  tabulated  AE  data  after  Week  16  post-transplant  also 
contained any other types of AEs that were passively reported.  
Presentation of AEs in CSR and Safety Summary (P001) 
Safety  analyses  are  presented  according  to the  protocol-specified  time  points  and/or  analysis  definitions, 
which were based on the timing of collection of AEs in P001 relative to dosing and the status of the study at 
the time of this Application.  
Treatment Phase: All AEs collected from the time of initiation of study medication through 14 days following 
the last dose of study medication were considered as occurring during the Treatment Phase. These data are 
presented under subheading “AEs in treatment phase”.

Through Week 24 Post-Transplant: AEs reported as described above up to week 24 post-transplant.  
Through the Database Lock: AEs reported as described above up to week 48 post-transplant. At the time of 
database lock (DBL), a total of 431 subjects (75.6% of all randomized) had continued beyond Week 24 post-
transplant and 302 (53.0%) of these subjects completed the trial. 
Upon request, all AEs and graded lab toxicity up to week 16 were also presented during the procedure.  
Adverse Events - Treatment Phase 
Common AEs 
Overall,  the  AE  profile  was  similar  in  the  letermovir  and  placebo  groups,  including  proportions  with  serious 
AEs. AEs deemed drug-related were, overall, not more frequent with letermovir, and proportions of patients 
stopping therapy for potentially drug-related AEs were also similar between arms.

Common  AEs  in  this  treatment  population  were-expectedly-very  frequent  (see  following  table).  The  most 
commonly reported AEs (letermovir vs. placebo) during the treatment phase were GVHD (39.1% vs. 38.5%), 
diarrhea  (26.0%  vs.  24.5%),  nausea  (26.5%  vs.  23.4%),  vomiting  (18.5%  vs.  13.5%),  rash  (20.4%  vs. 
21.4%),  and  pyrexia  (20.6%  vs.  22.4%).  Overall,  the  frequency  of  AEs  was  similar  between  arms.  To  be 
noted, in protocol 020 (phase 2, numbers limited), there was no tendency for a higher frequency of AEs with 
higher dosing, regardless of the SOC term. 
The  incidence  of  the  following  AEs  was  higher  in  the  letermovir  group  compared  to  the placebo  group (CI95 
values in brackets). These AEs are marked in the following table, and discussed further in this report.

Of  note,  figures  presented  for  SOC  groups  (e.g.  Blood  and  lymphatic  disorders),  next  table,  would  to  the 
understanding  of  the  Rapporteur  concern  the  actual  number  of  individuals  reported  to  have  had  such  AEs. 
When  summing  up  individual  terms,  the  numbers  may  exceed  that  presented  for  the  SOC  group,  since 
patients may have had >1 type of AE within that group (e.g. both anemia and neutropenia). Numbers may 
also not add up to the total sum for the group, since only AEs seen in at least 4 subjects in either treatment 
arm are presented. 
When looking at “Infections and Infestations” (reported in 64.4% in the letermovir arm vs 72.4 in the placebo 
arm)  it  would  seem  as  if  non-CMV  infections  would  be  considerable  more  common  in  the  letermovir-arm, 
since CMV was reported as AE much more frequently in the letermovir arm (8.3% vs 45.8%). However, this 
seems to be an effect of how frequencies were reported (4 or more subjects with a specific AE, biasing results 
in favor of the smaller control group). When looking AEs reported in >0% of patients in either arm (table not 
presented in this report), non-CMV infections were reported in very similar frequencies when adjusting for the 
25%  difference  in  the  duration  of  treatment  phase  (1.05  events  per  patient  in  the  letermovir-arm  vs  0.84 
events per person in the placebo-arm; 1.05/0.84 =1.25).

AEs  that  had  a  higher  frequency  in  the  letermovir  group  (Cardiac  Disorders,  Ear  and  Labyrinth  Disorders, 
Myalgia,  Hyperkalemia,  Dyspnea)  were  further  analyzed  for  potential  clinical  relevance.  According  the 
applicant,  the  incidence  of  individual  preferred  terms  within  SOCs  did  not  show  a  significant  imbalance  for 
mentioned  SOCs  apart  from  Cardiac  disorders  (discussed  below).  For  the  others,  no  such  episodes  led  to 
discontinuation  of  study  medication  and  these  events  were  not  further  analyzed.  Hyperkalemia  is  further 
discussed in the section on lab chemistry. 
In  addition  to  AEs  just  discussed,  headache  was  numerically  more  common  with  letermovir,  as  well  as 
psychiatric disorders (mainly driven by a higher frequency of insomnia). It summary it seems as if letermovir 
may  not  be  fully  free  from  CNS  side  effects –  mild  to  moderate  for  the  most.  When  looking  at  serious  AEs 
(treatment phase), headache remains to be mentioned for letermovir, n=3 (0.8%), an AE that may of course 
be  related to other  factors  than  letermovir  therapy per  se.  None  of  the psychiatric  events  were  reported  as 
serious AEs. 
Cardiac  SOC  events  were  reported  twice  more  frequently  for  patients  treated  with  letermovir,  overall.    The 
difference mainly concerned events of various kinds of tachyarrhythmia, next table.

The Cardiac SOC AE was graded serious for 8 subjects (letermovir group: 6 [1.6%]; placebo: 2 [1.0%]). Of 
the 6 subjects in the letermovir group, 5 had either pre-existing or active medical conditions associated with 
the cardiovascular system (not the case for the 2 in the placebo group). Letermovir was stopped as a 
consequence in 1 patient (fatal event, not considered drug related). This event occurred after 2 days of 
treatment, and the patient suffered from sepsis at this time point.  
Preclinical studies did not identify a cardiac signal. Overall, ECGs and vital signs were similar with letermovir 
and placebo throughout phase 1-3. Further, there was no exposure dependency for Cardiac Disorders SOC 
AEs over the exposure range. 
The applicant also notified that use of one or more cardiotoxic antineoplastic agents for pre-HSCT 
conditioning is a confounding factor for the analysis of Cardiac Disorders SOC AEs. The applicant concludes 
that there is no evidence for a causal association between intake of letermovir and Cardiac Disorders SOC 
AEs.  
In the phase 2 study called P020 (stems cell recipients), letermovir (60, 120 or 240 mg) was compared to 
placebo during 12 weeks of treatment, with around 30 patients per arm.  Here 1 treatment emergent cardiac 
case was seen with letermovir dosed 240 mg (pericarditis) and no cases in the other arms. 
Drug-related AEs (treatment phase) 
Overall, the incidence of AEs considered potentially drug-related was 17% for the letermovir group versus 
12% with placebo [95% CI: -1.4, 10.6].  The 5% difference was driven by a higher frequency of 
gastrointestinal AEs, mainly nausea (7.2 vs 3.6 %).The majority of these events were mild or moderate in 
intensity.  Of note, gastrointestinal AEs (possibly linked to letermovir) do not seem dose dependent. In 
Assessment report

protocol 020 (the dose finding study) treatment emergent GI disorders were in fact more frequently reported 
in the lowest dose group, 60 mg qd, here with a frequency of such AEs similar to that seen with placebo. 
Gastrointestinal AEs were in fact the lowest in the highest dose group (240 mg qd). 
AEs week 0-16 
AEs and lab toxicity during the treatment phase was the main focus for the safety evalution, that is to say a 
comparison of safety for letermovir versus placebo. In order to understand potential safety advantages with 
letermovir versus that seen with present standard of care (i.e. the therapy that in practice was given in the 
placebo-arm), safety data seen week 0-16 was requested during the procedure. As a reminder, around 7% of 
those allocated to letermovir versus around 40% of those allocated to placebo initiated PET during that time 
frame.  
No relevant difference in AEs or graded lab toxicity was seen between arms during this time frame. Having in 
mind  that  no  main  difference  in  safety  was  seen  between  letermovir  and  placebo  in  the  treatment  phase 
(prior section) this would indicate that available CMV agents are well tolerated the way they are used (short 
term) in pre-emptive therapy.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events (treatment phase) 
The proportion of subjects with at least one SAE reported  was 44.2% in the letermovir group vs. 46.9% in 
the placebo group. SAEs most frequently concerned: 
recurrent acute myeloid leukemia (2.9% vs. 3.6%),  
•  GVHD (9.9% vs. 10.4%),  
• 
•  CMV infection (2.7% vs. 6.8%), 
• 
• 
• 
pyrexia (1.9% vs. 2.1%). 
pneumonia (2.1% vs. 1.6%), and  
acute kidney injury (1.3 % vs. 4.7%) 
As mentioned, Cardiac Disorders SOC were reported as SAEs by 6 subjects (1.6%) in the letermovir group 
and 1 (0.5%) in the placebo group. A numerical imbalance was also noted in the percentage of subjects who 
experienced one or more SAEs of Nervous System Disorders (letermovir: 3.2%; placebo: 0.0%) and Vascular 
Disorders (1.6% vs. 0.5%). 
Proportions stopping therapy due to (any) serious AE was 9.4% vs. 14.1%.  
Deaths through week 48 
Mortality data from the phase 3 study was provided both in the efficacy sections (CSR and Summary), here 
with  a  focus  on  the  FAS  population,  where  deaths  (all  cause,  relapse  and  non-elapse  mortality)  at  certain 
time  points  from  day  of  transplant  were  summarized.  In  the  safety  summaries  (CSR  and  Company  Safety

Summary), the ASaT population was in focus with regards to AEs leading to death, with time points referring 
to onset of these AEs (study day).  
In  order  to  further  understand  the  mortality  data  presented  in  the  efficacy  and  safety  sections,  Excel  data 
including  all  deaths  in  study  P001  (ASaT  population)  was  requested,  with  information  on  “Primary  cause  of 
deaths”  (used  in  the  efficacy  analysis),  time  for  death  (post-transplant),  “fatal  AE(s)  leading  to  death 
(presented  in  the  safety  sections  of  the  application),  and  other  relevant  parameters.  A  complete  table  with 
this information is provided in an Appendix, section 11.  
The mortality rates initially presented by the company did not include all deaths that occurred through week 
48;  patients  who  discontinued  (and  died)  prior  to  week  48  were  not  included.  According  to  the  company, 
sites  were  not  required  to  report  the  vital  status  of  subjects  after  discontinuation  from  the  study.  Upon

 Note: Week 48 post-transplant is defined as 350 days post-transplant (2 weeks post Week 48 visit). Any 
death <=350 days post-transplant was counted as death, and any death >350 days post-transplant 
was counted as alive at Week 48 post-transplant.  n (%) = Number (percent) of subjects in each sub-
category. 
Below  is  the  safety  summary  around  “fatal  AEs”  leading  to  death”  (treatment  phase  followed  by  through 
week  24).  None  of  these  fatal  events  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment.  For  reasons  mentioned, 
sum  figures  do  not  match  the  mortality  rate  shown  above  (through  week  24)  since  time  periods  in  the 
coming  tables  refer  to  onset  of  event,  not  time  of  death.  As  a  reminder,  the  treatment  phase  was  also,  on 
average, longer for patients treated with letermovir. With that in mind, no obvious difference in types of AEs 
leading to death is seen between arms.

Deaths in Protocol 020 (phase 2) 
The study included 98 patients treated with letermovir (3 dose levels) and 33 treated with placebo. Five 
patients died during the trial, whereof 4 were treatment emergent (within 7 days after last dose of study 
medication): 
Letermovir 60 mg:  
2 patients: GVHD + pneumonia day 59; AML recurrent day 109 
Letermovir 120 mg:   1 patient (non-treatment emergent): Pneumonia day 104 
Letermovir 240 mg:   1 patient: Pneumonia day 37 
Placebo: 1 patient:  
Pneumonia day 24.  
Areas of special interest 
Incidence of and time to engraftment  
In P001, engraftment was defined as documented absolute neutrophil counts ≥500/mm3 on 3 consecutive 
days.  At the time of randomization, 63.5% of subjects in the letermovir group and 59.9% of subjects in the 
placebo group had not engrafted. In these patients engraftment failed in 4.6% of those randomized to 
letermovir, as compared to compared to 8.7% of those allocated to placebo. Similar trends were seen in 
subjects at increased risk for delayed engraftment (e.g., cord blood or haploidentical transplant recipients) as 
well as those not at such risk. 
Incidence of selected opportunistic infections other than CMV 
A summary of infections that would be considered opportunistic in this population was provided without any 
marked difference between arms, next table. As discussed in pharmacodynamics section, it is still of interest 
to see complied data on DNA-emia of HHV-6 and EBV, having in vitro effects in mind.

Subjects with laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
The traditional algorithm, i.e. AST or ALT ≥3 x ULN, total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN and, at the same time, ALP < 2 x 
ULN was used to screen for potential DILI cases (treatment phase). 
Overall, 11 subjects met these criteria, 8 (2.1%) in the letermovir group and 3 (1.6%) in the placebo group. 
None was considered related according to the investigators. These conclusions are supported by the 
Rapporteur on the basis of short narratives, since plausible alternative causes (AEs) are found in all 11 cases 
(venoocclusive liver disease (2), sepsis/pneumonia (3), other therapies in patient with Gilbert (1), 
engraftment syndrome (1), severe heart failure (1). In those 5 in the letermovir-arm who survived surviving 
these AEs, liver function tests normalized with continuous letermovir therapy.  
ECGs  
Thorough QT study  
Study P004 evaluated QT effects of single doses of iv letermovir dosed 480 mg or 960 mg 
(supratherapeutic), placebo or 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control). Treatment was double-blinded with 
respect to letermovir, while moxifloxacin was administered open-label. The study (single center) randomized 
38 healthy subjects in a 4-period, 8-sequence crossover design, with a 7 days wash-out period between 
treatments, and a 14 day follow-up after the last treatment. The design was in line with the ICH E14 
guidance. 
The upper limits of the 90% CI for the true mean difference from placebo of the both letermovir doses were 
<10 msec at all time points. The mean difference from placebo of moxifloxacin was 12 msec, in line with the 
expected. In summary, the letermovir did not show a potential for clinically relevant QT effects, including the 
supratherapeutic dose which yielded a 2-fold Cmax and a 2.7-fold AUC as compared to the 480 mg IV dose. 
Phase 3 outcomes. 
ECGs were collected at screening visit, at study Week 2 and at the EOT visit. Subjects were not excluded 
from the study if they had abnormal ECG findings at screening visit. Medications known to prolong QT were 
allowed.  
There was no tendency of QTc prolongation with letermovir (treatment phase), tables next page. Similarly, 
no relevant differences in median PR or QRS-intervals, or beats per minute overtime were seen at these time 
points.  
Laboratory findings 
Graded lab toxicity 
Descriptive statistics for protocol-specified laboratory tests were presented from baseline and Study Weeks 2, 
4, and 8, end of treatment (EOT), Study Week 16, and at the last observed time point (LOTTR). This 
concerned Hematology, common blood chemistry, urinalyses and FSH, LH, testosterone and inhibin B levels 
in males (testicular toxicity seen in rats).

Overall, the frequency of graded toxicity (grade 1-4) for the hematology (Hemoglobin, White blood cell count, 
neutrophils) and chemistry laboratory values were comparable in the letermovir and placebo groups, with the 
exception of the Grade 4 ALT (6 vs 0 cases) and platelet count:  
- Five out of six with ALT grade 4 had alterative explanations or had a negative re-challenge. The sixth case 
(ALT high around week 10) lacked such data, and here the event resolved post treatment.  
- Grade 4 decrease in platelets was somewhat more frequent with letermovir than with placebo (13.5 vs 
9.5%). However, the treatment phase was 25% longer for those allocated to letermovir. Further, the 
proportion of subjects with an “AE of decreased platelet count” during the treatment phase was similar 
between groups (2.9 vs 2.6 %). In addition, mean change from baseline in platelets over time does not 
indicate lower values during therapy with letermovir (next section). Finally, there was no tendency for 
worsened engraftment with letermovir, and the results in other hematology lab parameters (HB, LPK, 
neutrophils) were fully similar between arms. In summary, it seems unlikely that letermovir therapy per se 
carries a risk for thrombocytopenia. 
For creatinine, changes (including the most reported, grade 3) were comparable between groups, consistent 
with the similar incidence of Renal Disorders AEs during the Treatment Phase. 
The table below shows parameters just mentioned. In addition potassium is shown, since hyperkalemia (AE) 
was reported more frequently with letermovir as mentioned in previous section.

The prior table shows data for the treatment phase it does not capture potential toxic effects of pre-emptive 
therapy prior to week 14 (such patients are no longer in the treatment phase).  
To better understand whether letermovir seem to result in less toxicity than does present standard procedure 
(which in practice includes PET given at an earlier stage), graded lab toxicity up to week 16 is of interest 
(discussed in a prior section). As a reminder, during that time period PET was started in around 7% of 
patients in the letermovir arm versus around 40% of those in the placebo arm. No relevant difference in 
graded lab toxicity was seen between arms during that time period. 
It is noted that there was no difference between arms in graded worsening of potassium between arms, a bit 
odd since hyperkalemia (as AE) was more frequently reported for those treated with letermovir than with 
placebo (7% vs 2% of ASaT population, treatment phase). The company could not provide an explanation to 
this mismatch in AE reporting and reports in graded lab toxicity. Further, potassium concentrations over time 
were fully similar between ams. Further, it was shown that reported AEs on hyperkalemia were not linked to 
reports on Cardiac SOC AEs. It is concluded that there is no evidence for hyperkalemia as a letermovir drug 
effect. 
Mean change from baseline in lab chemistry  
No relevant difference in mean change from baseline was seen for pre-specified lab parameters, including 
paramters of particular interest (hematology, creatinine and transaminases).   
Laboratory Evaluation of Testicular Function in Males 
Profound  and  irreversible  effects  on  testicular  function  were  seen  in  rats  (not  in  other  species).  Markers  of 
testicular toxicity were therefore monitored in male subjects in the phase 3 study (Serum inhibin B, LH, FSH, 
and testosterone levels at baseline, EOT (max week 14), and at week 24.   
No clinically relevant effects of letermovir on male sex hormones were seen. While this is the present target 
population, these patients may not be the most sensitive population to demonstrate a lack of effect, having in 
mind prior cancer treatment and frequently abnormal baseline values.  
Since no mechanistic explanation on why testicular toxicity would be species specific have been provided (i.e. 
seen in rats but not in other species, including humans), testicular toxicity remains a concern that has to be 
closely monitored. Biomarkers for testicular toxicity will be studied in an ongoing/coming placebo-controlled 
study in renal transplant patients. Results from this study will be more informative for the issue, since those 
patients have not received the types of other toxic treatment used in the patients in the present study. 
Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a phase 1 renal impairment study, a modest elevation of letermovir exposure (1.5-2 fold) was observed in 
subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to 59 and < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). In phase 
3, a limited number of patients with renal impairment were treated with letermovir (n=6 with a eGFR <50 
ml/min (MDRD equation), none with a clearance <30. A slightly higher number had a baseline clearance < 60 
ml/min (letermovir-arm 32, placebo-arm 19). Out of the 32 in the letermovir-arm, only 5 received letermovir 
IV (highest exposure).  When looking at SOC term Blood creatinine increased (treatment phase) for these 51

patients, this term was (numerically) more common in the LTV-arm, 7/32 (22%) vs 1/19 (5%).  Increases 
were mild to moderate, and seemed to resolve without stopping letermovir. Confounding baseline parameters 
naturally complicates the comparison. 
On the basis of this data, the company does not see a need for dose adjustment.  
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on letermovir pharmacokinetics was evaluated in moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatically impaired female subjects in a Phase 1 trial (P015). The exposure (AUC) 
was 1.6- and 3.8-fold higher than in healthy subjects.  
In the phase 3 study, subjects with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with moderate (Child-Pugh 
B) hepatic impairment and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault 
equation) were excluded.  Numbers actually treated with Child Pugh A (mild) or Child Pugh B (moderate) 
hepatic (but normal renal function) in phase 3 is unclear. In a subgroup analysis on the issue, the company 
defined hepatic impairment as AST/ and or ALT ≥3 times ULN, which certainly would not be parameters with 
adequate sensitivity/specificity for the task. Indeed, patients with severe hepatic impairment may have 
normal or just slightly raised transaminases, and patients with high transaminases may indeed have a normal 
hepatic function. With the use of the chosen definition, only a handful of patients were categorized as having 
hepatic impairment (7 in the letermovir-arm, ASaT population). 
On the basis of this data, the company concludes that letermovir can be given without dose adjustment to 
patients other than those with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, or with moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
hepatic impairment and moderate renal impairment (i.e. the same rule as chosen for the phase 3 study).  
Elderly 
Of the 373 subjects treated with letermovir in the phase 3 study, 56 (15.0%) subjects were 65 years of age 
or older. Safety was similar across older and younger subjects.  
Paediatric population 
No data are available for patients below 18 years of age.  
HIV and hepatitis co-infection 
HIV and or hepatitis B/C co-infection was part of exclusion criteria in the phase 2 and 3 studies. Hence, there 
is no data on such patients. To have the combination of prior stem cell transplant and these infections would 
be rare. The issue for the use of letermovir in such patients would be potential drug interactions (i.e. HIV and 
HBV therapy). Having epidemiology in mind it does not seem reasonable to request specific DDI studies. 
Pharmacology expertise may be used in cases where letermovir would be considered (rather than PET).  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Letermovir is relatively prone to interactions, both as a perpetrator and a victim. Important drug interactions 
for the target population include e.g. effects of CsA on letermovir exposure (half dose to be given), 
substantial effects by OATP-inhibitors (contraindicated, letermovir plasma exposure increased) and lowered 
voriconazole exposures (inducing effect of letermovir). This is listed in the RMP.

No specific safety issues related to drug drug interactions were captured in the phase 3 study. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the blinded comparison of letermovir versus placebo given during maximum 14 weeks in a fair number of 
stem-cell transplant patients (373 vs 192) there was no obvious difference in the pattern and frequencies of 
AEs (in the so-called “treatment” phase).  
It  should  be  taken  into  account  that  these  patients  suffer  from  problems  related  to  the  prior  cancer 
treatment,  as  well  as  the  transplantation,  and  the  assessment  of  AEs  of  an  antiviral  against  such  a 
background is naturally a challenge. A somewhat lower mortality (around 5% lower at weeks 24 and 48) in 
patients who received letermovir was noted in the study. The difference versus placebo was driven by a lower 
rate  in  non-relapse  mortality,  and  further  by  patients  who did  reactivate the CMV  infection.  As  discussed  in 
the efficacy section, the mortality rate was around twice as high in patients who did reactivate CMV-infection 
during  treatment  with  placebo,  as  compared to  the  rate  in  those  who  reactivated  CMV  as  a  “breakthrough” 
during  therapy  with  letermovir,  for  whom  the  mortality  rate  was  similar  to  that  seen  in  those  who  did  not 
reactive the CMV-infection at all. The finding is in line with what has been shown in several studies, namely, 
that early reactivation of CMV (where day 100 has been claimed to be a cut-off) is associated with a higher 
mortality  in  HSCT  recipients,  and  where  letermovir  prophylaxis  may  lower  the  risks  associated  with  CMV 
reactivation, by deferring this event to a later time point. However, data are not sufficiently strong to claim 
this effect. 
None of the AEs leading to death were considered related to therapy by the investigators (either arm). 
For other issues of particular interest such as failure to engraft the transplant and incidence/severity of GVHD 
there  was  no  tendency  for  higher  frequencies  in  those  treated  with  letermovir.  The  incidence  of  infections 
other than CMV, a main problem for this treatment population, did not seem to be affected.  Among common 
AEs  mild  to  moderate  GI  side  effects  were  somewhat  more  common  during  therapy  with  letermovir 
(treatment phase).  
Cardiac  events,  mainly  rhythm  disturbances  (atrial  fibrillation,  flutter  and  tachycardia)  were  seen  more 
frequently during therapy with letermovir than with placebo. This was driven by patients with a prior cardiac 
history.  In  these  patients  such  AEs  were  reported  3  times  more  frequent  during  therapy  with  letermovir 
(difference not significant in the total population). The events were not reported as serious. A time to event 
analysis  was  presented,  where  it  was  shown  that  the  numerical  difference  in  the  frequency  of  these  AEs 
occurred  during  the  first  2  weeks  or  so,  followed  by  a  parallel  incidence  with  letermovir  and  placebo.  A 
thorough analysis on any link to certain cardiac medications was undertaken, without any such finding, ruling 
out unexplained drug drug interactions as a potential cause of the finding. . No cardiac signals were seen in 
pre-clinical  studies,  and  no  relevant  QT  effects  were  seen  in  a  thorough  QT  study  and  the  events  were  not 
related  to  letermovir  exposures  (i.e.  not  higher  in  patients  with  events  as  compared  to  those  without).  .  
Following these further analyses it was concluded that there was no suggestive evidence for letermovir as a 
cause of cardiac AE, and that no specific warnings or recommendations are needed in the SmPC.  
A trend for a higher frequency of headache and insomnia was also noted, where the evidence for causality to 
letermovir is somewhat weak, having the disease state of these patients in mind. The signal was weakened in 
an  exposure-adjusted  analysis,  and  a  difference  was  only  seen  during  early  visits.  In  summary,  at  present 
there are no signs of problematic CNS side effects.

There were no obvious findings in graded toxicity in lab chemistry. 
When looking at all AEs and graded lab toxicity through study week 16, there were still no relevant difference 
between arms.  During this time period PET was initiated in around 7% of those allocated to letermovir and in 
around 40% of those in the placebo arm. The lack of differences between arms, both during treatment phase 
and  during  weeks  0-16,  implies  that  PET  with  available  CMV  agents  (i.e.  standard  of  care)  in  fact  is  well 
tolerated.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of letermovir is considered acceptable.  No relevant difference in AEs or graded lab toxicity 
was seen during treatment with letermovir and placebo (i.e. treatment phase). However, the same is true 
when looking at weeks 0-16, where PET was initiated in around 7% vs 40% of patients. Hence, according to 
the data presented, the safety profile of letermovir prophylaxis per se seems similar to that of present 
standard of care (i.e. PET with available agents).

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.6 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 1 November 2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of letermovir with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers letermovir to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the blister foil label as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The company estimates a very small number of patients affected in the EU (20 to 25 patients per 1 million). 
The rest of the labelling components, including the PL, will be provided in the national languages of the MSs 
concerned. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials 
will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
A request of translation exemption of the vial label as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The request for the English vial label was rejected because the dilution steps were considered too critical for 
the safe administration of the product. 
A request to omit certain particulars from the 30 ml vial label (minimum particulars) as per Art.63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group 
for the following reasons: 
To enable the launch of the intravenous product in two different doses for an extremely low number of 
patients and also to provide it to patients beyond the Western Europe, the company is developing 
multilingual labels for the immediate packaging. However, showing the full set of particulars in this vial label 
profile would heavily impair the readability of the provided information to healthcare professionals, in 
particular in the case of multilingual artworks. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Prevymis (letermovir) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking an indication for the” prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and disease 
in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)”. 
Cytomegalovirus is ubiquitous and generally acquired early in life, with the majority of the adult population 
being CMV-seropositive in most countries worldwide. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) 
recipients are immune-compromised, which increases the risk for CMV infection, mostly due to reactivation of 
latent CMV infection. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with prior CMV infection (R+) are at 
highest risk for developing CMV reactivation and disease, especially during the first 100 days post-transplant. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently two approaches to preventing CMV infection in HSCT recipients: 
1.  prophylaxis with antivirals 
2.  pre-emptive therapy (PET), the practice of active surveillance for viral replication and initiating 
treatment with anti-CMV agents when CMV viremia is detected. 
The most widely used agents ganciclovir (GCV) and valganciclovir (VGCV) are more effective than acyclovir 
and its prodrug valaciclovir. However, GCV/VGCV is associated with myelotoxicity, which is particularly 
problematic in the post-HSCT setting. Due to the concerns of the toxicities associated with anti-CMV agents, 
PET is currently the preferred preventive approach in the majority of centres worldwide, especially during the 
first 100 days post-transplant. Consequently, patients need to be monitored for CMV-DNA very frequently, a 
burden both to patients and prescribers. In fact, CMV reactivation will, over time, in practice occur in all these 
patients, but is less clinically relevant at later time points.  However, CMV viremia is associated with an 
increased risk of overall mortality even after adjustment for PET. 
Considering the challenges for PET as well as the toxicities associated with current anti-CMV agents, there is 
a role for an effective and well-tolerated antiviral agent for the prevention of CMV reactivation and disease in 
allogeneic HSCT recipients.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Letermovir is a new anti-CMV medicine  with a new target, the viral DNA terminase, which plays a key role in 
cleavage and packaging of viral progeny DNA. CMV terminase minimally consists of a large and a small 
subunit that are encoded by two viral genes (UL56 and UL89): Cross-resistance to other CMV drugs is not 
anticipated. 
P001 was a single pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of letermovir at a dose of 480 mg QD, adjusted to 240 mg QD when co-administered 
with CsA, versus placebo in adult, CMV-seropositive allogeneic HSCT recipients (R+). Treatment was 
administered through Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant. Overall, 570 subjects were randomized with 376 
in the letermovir group and 194 in the placebo group. This trial assessed prophylaxis with letermovir 
(compared to placebo) in the prevention of CMV reactivation.

Page 118/124 
 
  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint of P001 was the incidence of “clinically significant CMV infection” through Week 
24 post-transplant in the “FAS population”, that is to say patients who received therapy and had a negative 
CMV-DNA  test  in  plasma  on  day  1  of  treatment.  Clinically  significant  CMV  infection  was  defined  as  the 
occurrence of either CMV end-organ disease, or initiation of anti-CMV PET based on documented CMV DNA-
emia. 
Letermovir demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo in the analysis of the primary endpoint, with 37.5% 
versus  60.6%  of  patients  in  the  letermovir  and  placebo  group  failing  prophylaxis  up  to  24  weeks.  The 
estimated  treatment  difference  was  -23.5%  (95%CI:  -32.5,  -14.6;  one-sided  p-value  <0.0001).  The 
proportions  with  “clinically  significant  CMV-infection  up  to  week  14  was  19.1%  with  letermovir  and  50.0% 
with  placebo;  16%  versus  40%  of  patients  in  the  letermovir  and  placebo  arms  initiated  PET.  1.5%  versus 
1.8%  of  patients  developed  end-organ  CMV  disease.  Efficacy  consistently  favoured  letermovir  across 
subgroups  including  low  and  high  risk  for  CMV  reactivation,  conditioning  regimens,  and  concomitant 
immunosuppressive regimens. 
All-cause mortality was described as an exploratory endpoint without a prespecified statistical analysis plan. 
The proportion for all-cause mortality in the letermovir vs. placebo groups was 12.3% vs. 18.8% at Week 24 
post-transplant,  and  23.4%  vs.  27.1%  at  Week  48  post-transplant.  The  distribution  of  time  to  all-cause 
mortality through Week 24 (nominal two-sided log-rank p-value=0.0401, not controlled for multiplicity) was 
slightly different between the letermovir and placebo groups, but the difference was not significant at Week 
48 (nominal two-sided log-rank p-value=0.2117, not controlled for multiplicity). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
All  analyses  of  mortality  in  this  single  phase  3  study  are  exploratory  The  mode  of  analysis  was  not  pre-
specified and there was no plan for type 1 error control. The statistical strength of evidence for this effect is 
weak.  Therefore,  there  is  uncertainty  on  the  magnitude  of  any  impact  on  mortality  through  letermovir 
prophylaxis rather than a standard PET approach with (val)ganciclovir 
There is a relative increase in the incidence of initiation of PET in the letermovir group between weeks 14 and 
24  when  prophylaxis  is  discontinued.  Furthermore,  although  differences  are  small  and  statistically  non-
significant, there is also the occurrence of a few new cases of gastrointestinal CMV disease in the letermovir 
group.  Traditionally,  in  the  prophylactic  setting,  drugs  have  been  studied  during  the  first  100  days  post-
transplant,  when  the  risk  of  serious  CMV  infection  is  highest.  However,  it  is  possible  that  additional  clinical 
benefit  could  be  expected  in  a  subset  of  patients,  from  prolonged  letermovir  prophylaxis  beyond  week  14 
post-transplant.  Thus  there  is  an  uncertainty  whether  treatment  up  to  100  days  post-transplant  is  most 
appropriate in all cases. There is an interesting finding in the phase 3 study, which seems supportive of the 
limited 14 weeks treatment duration. Namely, all-cause mortality in patients treated with letermovir and who 
still  met  the  primary  endpoint  was  fully  similar  to  the  mortality  in  those  patients  (both  arms)  who  did  not 
reactivate CMV-infection (around 21%). In contrast, the mortality was notably higher in patients allocated to 
placebo and who met the primary endpoint. Although numbers are limited, these figures could be taken to be 
supportive  for  a  beneficial  effect  of  letermovir  (direct  and  indirect)  on  the  basis  of  preventing  early  CMV 
reactivation.  However,  it  is  not  clear  that  the  causes  of  death  would  be  CMV-related,  wherefore  the 
interpretation of this finding is fraught with uncertainty.  
Patients with pre-existing CMV viremia, regardless of level, were not included in the study. Further, patients 
who  reactivated  CMV  between  screening  and  baseline  (i.e.  day  for  start  of  therapy)  stopped  therapy  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/490007/2017 
Page 119/124 
 
  
continued  with  PET,  and  were  not  part  of  the  efficacy  analyses.  However,  such  patients  are  not  explicitly 
excluded in the current labelling.  
In subjects failing letermovir prophylaxis where CMV DNA could be successfully sequenced (n=22), only one 
presented with a known resistance-associated polymorphism. In addition, a number of genetic variants that 
have  not  been  associated  with  reduced  susceptibility  to  letermovir  were  found.  Baseline  target  gene 
sequencing,  as  well  as  phenotypic  resistance  testing  at  failure  is  not  available  at  present,  limiting  the 
conclusions  that  can  be  drawn.  Phenotypic  data,  which  may  be  interpretable  without  paired  baseline  CMV-
DNA  samples  (not  readily  available)  will  be  analysed  and  will  be  submitted  though  a  post-authorization 
commitment, as recommended by CHMP.  
Of  note,  PET  was  initiated  according  to  treatment  guidelines,  that  is  to  say  at  very  low  CMV-DNA  levels. 
Having  the  mechanism  of  action  in  mind,  where  letermovir  blocks  the  CMV  life  cycle  “downstream”  DNA 
replication, it is in fact unclear whether the DNA-emia seen in around 20% of patients treated with letermovir 
actually represents true viremia. In the single phase 2 study where letermovir was given to viraemic patients 
it  was  noted  that  viral  load  decay  was  much  slower  than  that  seen  with  control  therapy  (ganciclovir); 
however, after 14 days of therapy a similar viral load decay was seen with letermovir and ganciclovir.  Hence, 
it is uncertain to what extent letermovir prophylaxis could indeed continue without going to PET also in case 
of “breakthrough” CMV-DNA, and for the same reason it may be that CMV-DNA is not the optimal parameter 
to monitor during letermovir prophylaxis. To some extent requested phenotypic data may shed some light on 
this issue that would be of high interest to study in coming clinical trials. 
It  is  presumed  that  an  important  benefit  of  letermovir  could  be  a  better  safety  profile  compared  to  what  is 
seen  with  GCV/VGCV  or  other  medicines  used  for  PET  (the  PET-sparing  effect  being  the  main  documented 
effect).  However,  the  way  safety  data  was  collected,  with  a  focus  on  a  comparison  to  placebo  during  the 
treatment  phase,  does  not  capture  the  potential  toxicity  associated  with  PET,  not  allowing  for  this  potential 
benefit to be shown. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The dose proposed for clinical use, i.e. 480 mg, or 240 mg when CsA is part of co-treatment, was given to 
373 patients in phase 3 (14 weeks), 18 patients in study P020 (phase 2, 14 days treatment). In addition 362 
phase 1 subjects received this dose, mostly as single dose. A dose higher than 480 mg qd was given to 86 
subjects  in  phase  1,  of  whom  17  received  such  a  dose  for  >10  days.  The  mean  and  median  duration  of 
letermovir  treatment  in  the  phase  3  study  was  69  and  82  days  for  both  formulations  combined  (around  2 
weeks for the IV formulation). 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  seems  acceptable  Six  (1.1%)  subjects  experienced  a  serious  adverse  reaction 
through Week 24 post-transplant, with 3 (0.8%) in the letermovir group and 3 (1.6%) in the placebo group. 
Overall,  similar  proportions  of  subjects  in  each  group  discontinued  study  medication  due  to  an  adverse 
reaction  (4.8%  letermovir  vs.  3.6%  placebo).  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  that  led  to 
discontinuation of letermovir were nausea (1.6%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.5%).  
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  (letermovir  vs.  placebo)  during  the  treatment  phase  were  GVHD  (39.1% 
vs.  38.5%),  diarrhea  (26.0%  vs.  24.5%),  nausea  (26.5%  vs.  23.4%),  vomiting  (18.5%  vs.  13.5%),  rash 
(20.4% vs. 21.4%), and pyrexia (20.6% vs. 22.4%).

The following AEs were more common in the letermovir arm: Cardiac Disorders: 12.6% vs. 6.3% [1.1, 11.1]; 
Ear  and  Labyrinth  Disorders:  4.6%  vs.  1.0%  [0.5,  6.3].  Myalgia:  5.1%  vs.  1.6%  [0.2,  6.5].  Hyperkalemia: 
7.2% vs. 2.1% [1.4, 8.6]; Dyspnea: 8.0% vs. 3.1% [0.8, 8.6] 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Cardiac  events,  mainly  rhythm  disturbances  (atrial fibrillation,  flutter,  tachycardia  that  was  supraventricular 
to  the  extent  that  this  has  been  specified)  were  seen  more  frequently  during  therapy  with  letermovir  than 
with  placebo.  This  was  driven  by  patients  with  a  prior  cardiac  history,  in  whom  such  AEs  were  reported  3 
times more frequent during therapy with letermovir (difference not significant in total population). The events 
were not reported as serious. However, no cardiac signals were seen in pre-clinical studies, and no relevant 
QT effects were seen in a thorough QT study and events were not exposure dependent. Furthermore, there 
was  no  impact  of  letermovir  over  placebo  on  vital  signs.    Thorough  analyses  of  concomitant  cardiac 
medications in patients with and without events ruled out an association to any particular cardiac medication 
or class of cardiac medication. In summary, the totality of evidence did not indicate that these events were 
caused  by  letermovir,  and  no  specific  actions  or  SmPC  wordings  are  deemed  necessary.  The  issue  can  be 
readdressed  in  future  controlled  studies.  Similarly,  the  causal  relation  with  the  other  AEs  seen  more 
frequently in the letermovir is unclear, as the pharmacological mechanism is not fully understood. 
There is little data on safety when used in patients with r hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment. 
In  rat,  major  irreversible  testicular  toxicity  and  decreased  fertility  of  exposed  males  were  observed  and  no 
rat-specific mechanism for these findings has been presented. In study P001 no clinically relevant effects of 
letermovir  on  male  sex  hormones  were  seen.  However,  these  patients  may  not  be  the  most  sensitive 
population to verify a lack of effect, having in mind prior cancer treatment, pre-transplantation conditioning 
and frequently abnormal baseline values. The issue is not deemed relevant in the present target population 
(subject  to  other  very  toxic  agents)  and  is  therefore  not  considered  a  safety  concern  for  the  present 
indication.  
The  applicant  is  proposing  the  use  of  sterile  filtration  in  combination  with  aseptic  processing  instead  of 
terminal  sterilization.  Further  development  work  is  required  to  confirm  whether  the  latter  option  is  feasible 
for  this  product  or  not.  While  the  former  method  is  considered  sufficient  to  ensure  a  positive  benefit-risk 
balance,  with  a  low  risk  of  residual  contamination,  the  latter  is  the  state  of  the  art  method  with  respect  to 
ensuring no microbial contamination, and should be used whenever possible. In order to optimise the sterility 
assurance level (SAL) of the manufacturing process, the marketing authorisation holder should be requested 
to implement the measures outlined in the Post Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP), which has 
been agreed with the CHMP, concerning development, validation and introduction of terminal sterilisation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CMV reactivation and, potentially, subsequent end-organ disease, is an important complication post HSCT. In 
the early days of transplantation, death due to CMV infection was a very considerable risk, which was 
subsequently reduced due to the introduction of prophylaxis, PET and treatment of CMV disease, using 
various agents. The most used agent in this setting is GCV/VGCV; however, due to myelotoxicity this use is 
somewhat complicated, prompting the routine use of PET rather than prophylaxis post HSCT. Apart from

lessen the need for this burden. As long as it is unclear to what extent CMV-DNA breakthrough during 
letermovir prophylaxis is clinically relevant (i.e represents true viremia), this activity would have to be 
maintained also during letermovir prophylaxis.  
Efficacy has been shown for letermovir as prophylaxis against CMV-DNAemia post HSCT. The incidence of 
CMV end-organ disease was similarly low in both arms. The side effect profile of letermovir appears overall 
not distinctly different from placebo, and thus favourable within the relatively complex treatment context. 
The safety profile, with due respect to uncertainties, is the key benefit that has been shown.  
With regard to the interesting finding from an exploratory analysis according to which it appears that there is 
a trend towards lower mortality at week 24 (which is attenuated at week 48), CHMP agreed that this finding, 
from  a  single  pivotal  trial,  is  considered  weak  from  the  statistical  point  of  view  and  is  not  explained  by  a 
direct  impact  on  CMV-  or  ganciclovir-related  mortality.  CHMP  therefore  did  not  agree  to  introduce  this 
information in section 5.1. of the SmPC, as the applicant had proposed.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits shown with letermovir outweigh the risks. The benefit-risk balance of Prevymis in the claimed 
indication is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Prevymis is positive for the claimed indication. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Prevymis  is favourable in the following indication: 
prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of 
an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
In order to optimise the sterility assurance level (SAL) of the manufacturing process, 
the marketing authorisation holder should implement the measures outlined in the 
Post Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) agreed with the CHMP 
concerning development, validation and introduction of terminal sterilisation.

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that letermovir is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

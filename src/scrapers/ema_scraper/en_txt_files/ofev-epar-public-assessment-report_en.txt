2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Idiopathic  pulmonary  fibrosis  (IPF)  is  a  rare  disease  of  unknown  aetiology  that  is  characterized  by 
progressive fibrosis of the interstitium of the lung, leading to decreasing lung volume and progressive 
pulmonary  insufficiency.  The  prevalence  of  IPF  is  estimated  at  not  more  than  3  in  10,000  in  the 
Community, and is most prevalent in middle aged and elderly patients, and usually presents between the 
ages of 40 and 70 years (ATS/ERS 2000).  
Pathophysiology 
The pathophysiology of IPF i.e. the underlying fibroproliferative process remains incompletely 
understood. IPF is assumed to be caused by an unknown insult to the lung that leads to alveolar epithelial 
cell injury and subsequent dysregulated repair, characterised by excessive deposition of extracellular 
matrix (ECM) and loss of normal parenchymal architecture and lung function. Fibroblasts, which produce 
ECM proteins in fibrosing diseases such as IPF, exhibit unregulated proliferation and differentiate into 
myofibroblasts. The latter is considered the hallmark cell in the development and establishment of lung 
fibrosis. 
Patients with IPF may have sub-clinical or overt co-morbid conditions including pulmonary hypertension, 
gastroesophageal  reflux,  obstructive  sleep  apnoea,  obesity,  diabetes  mellitus  and  emphysema.  Most 
patients die of respiratory failure. Median survival, as described across a range of studies, is only 2 to 5 
years after diagnosis.  
Many  patients  experience  long  periods  of  relative  stability  but  acute  episodes  of  rapid  respiratory 
deterioration may result in death. 
Diagnosis 
The histopathological feature of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The major diagnostic criterion is 
a heterogeneous appearance at low magnification in which areas of fibrosis with scarring and honeycomb 
change alternate with areas of less affected or normal parenchyma. These histopathologic changes often 
affect  the  subpleural  and  paraseptal  parenchyma  most  severely.  Inflammation  is  usually  mild  and 
consists of a patchy interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells associated with hyperplasia of 
type  2  pneumocytes  and  bronchiolar  epithelium.  The  fibrotic  zones  are  composed  mainly  of  dense 
collagen,  although  scattered  convex  subepithelial  foci  of  proliferating  fibroblasts  and  myofibroblasts 
(so-called fibroblast foci) are a consistent finding. Areas of honeycomb change are composed of cystic 
fibrotic  airspaces  that  are  frequently  lined  by  bronchiolar  epithelium  and  filled  with  mucus  and 
inflammatory cells. Smooth muscle metaplasia in the interstitium is commonly seen in areas of fibrosis 
and honeycomb change. 
On  high  resolution  computed  tomography  (HRCT)  UIP  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  reticular 
opacities,  often  associated  with  traction  bronchiectasis.  Honeycombing  is  common,  and  is  critical  for 
making a definite diagnosis. Honeycombing is manifested on HRCT as clustered cystic airspaces, typically 
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 9/85  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
of  comparable  diameters  on  the  order  of  3–10  mm  but  occasionally  as  large  as  2.5  cm.  It  is  usually 
subpleural and is characterized by well-defined walls. Ground glass opacities are common, but usually 
less extensive than the reticulation. 
Classification 
IPF is a well-recognised and distinct interstitial lung disease with unique histopathologic, clinical and 
prognostic characteristics (American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS), 2000; 
ATS/ERS, 2002). The natural history of the disease and the factors influencing prognosis are incompletely 
understood. Due to the limited knowledge of the variability in the natural history of IPF there are currently 
no data to support staging approaches i.e. the definition of subpopulations (mild/moderate/severe, 
early/advanced/end-stage, and stabile/progressive). Proposed stages are commonly based on resting 
pulmonary function test measurements and/or extent of radiologic abnormalities. However, it is unknown 
if these staging approaches are relevant to clinical decision making [P11-07084]. 
Existing methods of treatment of IPF 
Conventional IPF treatments such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and azathioprine 
are not approved treatments for IPF, and their efficacy is questionable. Pirfenidone recently became the 
first product to receive EU approval under the tradename Esbriet as a treatment for mild to moderate IPF. 
Pirfenidone has antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity and a demonstrated efficacy and marketing 
authorisation for the treatment of IPF in adults but the treatment effect is modest. 
Lung transplant (LTx) is the only intervention that has been shown to positively impact survival in patients 
with  IPF.  Median  survival  after  LTx  in  IPF  patients  is  approximately  4-5  years,  and  5-year  survival  is 
estimated at 39-50% [R11-5086; R12-2785; R12-3474]. The number of patients transplanted due to IPF 
has increased steadily over the last years, particularly in the US, where IPF has become the most common 
indication for transplantation since the introduction of the Lung Allocation Score [R12-3676; R12-3680; 
R12-3474]. However, broader application of this approach is limited given the scarce availability of donor 
organs.  In  addition,  comorbidities  and  advanced  age  preclude  many  patients  from  referral  to  lung 
transplant given a mean age of IPF patients at presentation of 66 years [R10-2843]. 
About the product 
Nintedanib  is  a  small  molecule  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI)  blocking  vascular  endothelial 
growth factor receptors (VEGFR 1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR 1-3) and platelet-derived 
growth factor receptors (PDGFR) α and β kinase activity in the low nanomolar range. 
Nintedanib binds competitively to the ATP binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular 
signalling which is crucial for the proliferation, migration and fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation of 
lung fibroblasts. In addition Flt-3, Lck and Src kinases are inhibited by nintedanib.  
The  inhibition  of  signalling  pathways  of  several  tyrosine  kinases;  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) involved in lung fibrosis 
is expected to reduce progressive fibrosis and fibroblast foci with interspersed areas of lung sparing and 
minimal excess inflammatory infiltrate in IPF. 
Type of Application and aspects on development

This application concerns a centralised procedure and has been submitted as complete and independent 
application according to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC meaning that it includes complete quality 
data, non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and bibliographic literature 
supporting certain tests or studies. 
Nintedanib was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: the treatment of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
With  regard  to  the  paediatric  development,  a  product  specific  waiver  for  all  subsets  of  the  paediatric 
population has been granted on the grounds that the disease or condition, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, 
for which the specific medicinal product as intended, occurs only in the adult population. 
Protocol Assistance/Scientific advice 
The applicant requested CHMP scientific advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/209064/2007) on aspects of 
non-clinical (need for reproductive toxicity studies) and clinical development for the oncology indication 
(interim analysis of the PFS endpoint). The CHMP recommended to include exploratory analyses directed 
at increasing the knowledge about the mechanism of action of nintedanib and to identify possible 
biomarkers. 
There are no specific CHMP guidelines that are pertinent to the condition of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
In the design of the Phase III pivotal trials to compare nintedanib with placebo, account was taken of the 
EMA paper “EU Standard of Medicinal Product Registration: Clinical Evaluation of Risk/Benefit – the role of 
Comparator Studies” (EMEA/119319/04). At the time CHMP advice was obtained on the absence of an 
active comparator arm in the pivotal trials, there was no authorised medicinal product available in the EU 
for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This approach was therefore acceptable. 
For the development of nintedanib a further Protocol Assistance was received from the CHMP pertaining 
to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier in IPF. CHMP Protocol assistance was provided on 20th 
January  2011  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/18782/2011)  and  was  followed  broadly  with  respect  to  the  planned 
pivotal Phase III trials. As recommended by CHMP, diagnostic criteria for inclusion of patients with IPF 
were broadly in line with American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society (2011) Guidelines 
that rested in essence on diagnostic features on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and / or 
histopathological features on surgical lung biopsy (obtained via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy but not by 
transbronchial biopsy). The recent guidelines therefore obviate the necessity for surgical lung biopsy in 
the  presence  of  characteristic  features  of  IPF  on  HCRT;  surgical  biopsy  becomes  necessary  when 
diagnostic  features  are  not  present  on  HCRT  but  the  patient  otherwise  has  symptoms  of  IPF.  The 
recommendation of CHMP was that HCRT should be conducted no more than 3 months prior to study 
entry; however, the study enrolled patients who had had a diagnostic HCRT performed up to one year 
previously. Given that the disease is irreversible, this is not considered to be a major deviation from the 
advice. Furthermore, the HCRT evidence for all enrolled patients was evaluated centrally by a recognised 
expert in the field. The efficacy endpoints proposed by the Company were broadly endorsed by CHMP 
although it was commented that FVC (the selected primary efficacy variable) is an indirect measure of 
disease progression whereas diffusing capacity may be a more direct measure.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as soft capsules containing 100 mg and 150 mg nintedanib (as esilate) 
as active substance.  
Other ingredients are medium-chain triglycerides, hard fat, lecithin, gelatin, glycerol (85 %), titanium 
dioxide, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow and black ink. The black ink of the capsule has the following 
composition: shellac glaze, iron oxide black and propylene glycol. 
The product is available in Alu/Alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  the  active  substance  is  ethanesulfonic  acid  -  methyl  (3Z)-3-{[(4-{methyl- 
[(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)acetyl]amino}phenyl)amino]-(phenyl)methylidene}-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-in
dole-6-carboxylate (1:1) and has the following chemical structure: 
Nintedanib esilate is a bright yellow powder soluble in water. The solubility increases at lower pH and 
decrease at higher pH due to the non-protonated free base which has a low solubility in water.  
At room temperature, the active substance exists only in one single crystalline form. The active substance 
contains no chiral centres. The double bond at C-3 of the indole moiety allows for E/Z isomerism, but the 
active substance is the Z-isomer. 
The chemical structure elucidation has been performed by infrared spectroscopy, 1H NMR and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, ESI-CID mass spectroscopy, ultraviolet absorption (UV), X-ray powder diffraction and 
x-ray diffraction. The molecular formula is confirmed by elemental analysis.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesised in six steps using well defined starting materials. The final active 
substance is purified by crystallisation.  According to the synthetic process described the active substance 
is consistently obtained as the Z-isomer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 12/85  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been justified with 
respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for carry-over into the final active substance, their 
structural complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final intermediate and the active 
substance, respectively.  
The information provided adequately describes the manufacturing including reactions conditions, 
quantities of raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origins and adequately characterised. The carry-over of impurities, reagents, solvents and catalysts 
from the starting material into the final active substance has been discussed. Adequate in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediates, 
starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The active substance is packed in double low density polypropylene plastic bags (clear) and packed inside 
a fibre drum. The materials in contact with the active substance comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC 
and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR and TLC), 
chromatographic purity (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph Eur), residual solvents (GC), water (KF), sulphated ash 
(Ph Eur), assay (HPLC) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The control tests were carried out according to Ph. Eur. or the relevant in-house procedure. A detailed 
description and full method validation data were provided for the in-house analytical methods in 
accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. The analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the 
quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable from a quality and safety point of view. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided for a range of product scale batches which were 
manufactured according to the proposed synthetic route. The batch analysis data show that the active 
ingredient can be manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three production scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial packaging 
from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long term 
(25°C/60%RH) for up to 60 months and accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 months. The 
active substance used in the primary stability studies was manufactured according to the commercial 
process.  
The following parameters were tested: integrity of the packaging material, appearance, chromatographic 
purity (HPLC), water (KF), assay (HPLC), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), alkyl 
ethanesulfonates, crystalline modification and microbiological purity (HPLC). The analytical methods used 
in the stability studies, which were not included in the specifications, have been adequately described and 
non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 13/85  
  
  
 
 
Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to high temperatures, high 
humidity, light, different pH values and oxidative conditions. Photostability testing following ICH 
guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch of the active substance. The results showed that there are no 
significant changes for any of the evaluated parameters established for the stability studies. 
Nevertheless, the active substance is sensitive to extreme oxidative conditions and high temperatures. 
All stability studies results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the drug development was to develop an immediate release solid oral dosage form, containing 
100 mg and 150 mg of nintedanib as ethanesulfonate salt, considering the physicochemical properties of 
the active substance.  
The selection of the soft capsule formulation was based on the relative high drug load, the properties of 
the active substance and excipient compatibility results. Due to the technology and process available the 
manufacturing process of this pharmaceutical form minimise the exposure of manufacturing personnel to 
the active substance, which is a highly potent compound. 
Due to poor solubility of nintedanib esilate at neutral conditions, the active substance cannot be 
formulated as solution and is therefore suspended in a lipophilic fill mix. Selection of the lipophilic 
excipients mix was generally based on technical and functional formulation requirements and active 
substance stability. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and are commonly used for soft gelatin 
formulations. Their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Relevant 
warnings are included in section 2 and 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the content of soya lecithin. 
 Milled active substance is used to prevent generation of active substance agglomerates in the fill mix. 
The composition of the 2 dosage strengths is proportional. 
Quality  by  Design  principles  were  used  during  development  and  an  acceptable  quality  target  product 
profile was established and the critical quality attributes were defined. A suitable control strategy was 
applied based on risk assessments. The development was used to establish the targets for critical process 
parameters  and  critical  material  attributes  used  for  further  process  validation  and  the  proposed 
commercial  manufacturing.  It  is  important  to  emphasise  that  no  design  space  is  proposed.  The 
formulation development has been acceptably described and the choice of excipients has been justified.  
The composition of the capsule fill has remained practically unchanged during phases 1 to 3 of clinical 
development, and is identical with the final formulation for the commercial product. The composition of 
the capsules shell has changed only with respect to the amount of the used colorants, which was adjusted 
to manufacture the desired colors of the capsule shell. The composition of Ofev capsules 100 mg and 150 
mg used in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials is identical with the composition of the proposed commercial 
product. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. Bioequivalence study was 
performed showing bioequivalence between two batches, represented maximum batch-to-batch 
variability seen in the dissolution rate.

A standard process, utilizing well-established manufacturing technology, is selected for manufacturing of 
OFEV (100 mg and 150 mg) soft capsules.  
The primary packaging is described as stated in the SmPC. The material complies with Ph Eur and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: fill mix preparation, gelatin mass preparation, 
encapsulation, drying, size sorting, washing, printing and packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form.   
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this type of dosage form: 
appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), Uniformity of dosage Units (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC) and microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of 63 commercial batches of the 100 mg strengths and 46 commercial batches of the 
150 mg strength are provided. The results confirm the consistency of the process and its ability to 
manufacture a product complying with the product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three production scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH,  for up to 12 months under at 30ºC / 75% RH  and for up to six months 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The parameters tested are appearance, dissolution, impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbiological 
quality (Ph Eur). The analytical methods used during the stability studies are the same as used for release 
testing of the finished product. 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. In addition stress stability studies were performed on one fully representative 
batch under various extreme conditions of humidity and high temperatures. The finished product exposed 
to high humidity showed a decrease in dissolution, changes in the appearance, and an increase in water 
content of the capsule shell with a corresponding decrease in capsule hardness. The temperature stress 
results in decrease in dissolution and decrease in capsule hardness. No changes attributed to light stress 
were seen. The results obtained for temperature and humidity stress underscore the need for a moisture 
protective packaging material and the restriction in storage temperature. 
Based on the all available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from swine sources is used in the product. It was confirmed that the swine sources are 
from healthy animals fit for human consumption. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The main goal of the drug development was to develop an 
immediate release solid oral dosage form, containing 100 mg and 150 mg of nintedanib as 
ethanesulfonate salt, considering the physicochemical properties of the active substance. The 
development of the medicinal product includes elements of Quality by Design (QbD), but no design space 
has been established or claimed. The manufacturing flow-chart was provided with suitable in-process 
controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated at full scale at the proposed manufacturing 
site and a validation protocol has been presented.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The primary and secondary pharmacodynamics of nintedanib were investigated in a number of in vitro 
and in vivo studies. Pivotal toxicology studies and most of the safety pharmacology studies were 
carried-out in compliance with GLP. 
Scientific advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/209064/2007) has been sought on non-clinical aspects (need for 
reproductive toxicity studies).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
BIBF1120 was tested for its ability to interfere with essential fibrotic processes in a variety of in vitro 
assays and in vivo studies. Potency and selectivity were determined in enzymatic assays using human 
recombinant protein kinase domains. The inhibitory activity of BIBF1120 was confirmed at the cellular 
level in human lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF and from control donors. The in vivo efficacy of BIBF 
1120 was explored in three animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice 
and rats and silica-induced lung fibrosis in mice. The in vitro findings are summarised in Table 1 and 2 and 
the in vivo findings in Table 3, respectively.

Binding of BIBF 1120 to the VEGFR2 and PDGFRα and β kinase domain 
BIBF 1120 was designed to bind to the ATP-binding site of the VEGFR-2. The expected binding mode was 
confirmed by cocrystallization with recombinant VEGFR-2 kinase and X-ray diffraction (resolution 2.1 Å), 
demonstrating that BIBF 1120 binds to the ATP-binding site in the cleft between the N- and C-terminal 
lobes of the kinase domain. The binding mode to the PDGFRα and β was not explored. However, sequence 
comparisons between the VEGFR-2 and the PDGFRα and β kinase domain suggest a similar binding mode 
with the glutamate residue at an equivalent position (PDGFRα: Glu609, PDGFRβ: Glu615) [U11-1947] 
In vitro kinase assays (U02-1109, U02-1310, U08-1683, U12-2457) 
The in vitro potency and selectivity of BIBF 1120 was determined in enzymatic assays using human 
recombinant kinase domains (see Table 1). BIBF 1120 is a potent inhibitor of PDGFRα/β, with IC50 = 59 
nM and 60 nM, respectively. BIBF1120 is also a potent inhibitor of the VEGFR-1, -2 and -3 kinases with 
IC50 values of 34 nM, 21 nM, and 13 nM, respectively. BIBF 1120 inhibits the FGFR family with IC50 
values: FGFR-1, 69 nM; FGFR-2, 37 nM; FGFR-3, 137 nM; FGFR-4, 610 nM. 
More than 20 other kinases were also analysed and showed no inhibition by the compound with the 
exception of three members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases: Src (IC50 156 nM), Lck (IC50 16 nM), 
and Lyn (IC50 195 nM).

Cellular activity (U02-1109, U08-1946, U03-1488) 
The inhibitory effect of BIBF 1120 on in vitro PDGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and cell proliferation 
and migration was explored in both normal human lung fibroblasts and lung fibroblasts explanted from 
patients with IPF.  BIBF 1120 inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated PDGFRα and β autophosphorylation with 
EC50 values of 21.6 nmol/L and 38.7 nmol/L, respectively and PDGF-BB-stimulated cell proliferation with 
an EC50 of 64 nmol/L.  BIBF 1202, the metabolite of BIBF 1120, inhibited PDGFRα and β 
autophosphorylation with EC50 values of 5717 nmol/L and 23,510 nmol/L, respectively (265-fold and 
607-fold less potent than BIBF 1120). 
In human lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF, BIBF 1120 inhibited PDGF-BB-, bFGF-, and 
VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation in a concentration dependent manner with EC50values of 11 nmol/L, 
5.5 nmol/L and less than 1 nmol/L, respectively (Table 2).  In human lung fibroblasts from non-fibrotic 
controls, BIBF 1120 inhibited PDGF-BB-, bFGF-, and VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation in a concentration 
dependent manner with EC50 values of 13 nmol/L, 0.6 nmol/L and less than 1 nmol/L, respectively (Table 
2).  BIBF 1120 inhibited PDGF-BB-, bFGF- and VEGF-stimulated fibroblast migration in a concentration 
dependent manner in human lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF and non-fibrotic control donors 
(Table 2). 
Table 2: Potency [EC50, nmol/L] and selectivity of BIBF 1120 in in vitro cellular assays 
BIBF 1120 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the TGF-ß2-induced αSMA expression in two primary 
lung fibroblast isolates with estimated IC50 values in the range of 100 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L. Inhibition of 
fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation was likely not due to inhibition of TGF-ß signalling as BIBF 1120 
does not block TGF-ß mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation. 
To examine the duration of BIBF 1120 induced inhibition of PDGFRα and β, washout experiments were 
conducted in normal human lung fibroblasts exposed to BIBF 1120 for 30 min at 50 nmol/L. Cells were 
subsequently washed and transferred into new cell culture dishes.  After 4 days BIBF 1120 still showed an 
inhibition  of  the  PDGF-BB-induced  PDGFRα  and  β  autophosphorylation  by  36.3%  and  18.9%, 
respectively.  When cells were washed multiple times after incubation with BIBF 1120, inhibitory activity

on the PDGFRs was still apparent after 8 h (16.9-27.3%). Even after 24 h some remaining inhibitory 
activity could be demonstrated (8.6-16.2%). 
Radioligand receptor assay (U02-1084) 
Affinities for various receptors were determined by radioligand receptor assays for BIBF 1120 at 5 μM. 
Out of 50 receptors tested, BIBF 1120 inhibited A3 adenosine receptors by 66%, NK2 receptors by 84%, 
5HT1B receptors by 102% and L-type Ca2+ channels by 65%. The applicant considers that the measured 
receptor affinity suggests a possibility that BIBF 1120 at higher plasma concentrations (5 μM and above) 
may induce a decrease in blood pressure due to interactions with L-type Ca2+ channels.  However, no 
specific binding was detected at 3 μmol/L when the radioligand receptor assays to determine specific 
binding of BIBF 1120 to 5HT1B receptors was repeated. 
In vivo pharmacology profile 
The  in  vivo  efficacy  of  BIBF  1120  was  explored  in  three  animal  models  of  pulmonary  fibrosis, 
bleomycin-induced  lung  fibrosis  in  mice  and  rats  and  silica-induced  lung  fibrosis  in  mice  (U06-1451, 
U06-1479, U12-2437 and U12-2066). BIBF 1120 was administered orally, once daily in both a preventive 
regimen  starting  directly  after  bleomycin  or  silica  stimulation  till  the  end  of  the  experiment  and  a 
therapeutic regimen starting after the onset of the fibrotic lung alteration in all models. In general, BIBF 
1120  reduced  lung  inflammation  and  lung  fibrosis  in  the  different  animal  models.  The  parameters 
explored and the extent of inhibitory activity was different in each model. A daily dose of 24.9 - 83 mg/kg 
BIBF 1120 in mice and 8.3 – 41.5 mg/kg in rats was efficacious and tolerated when administered for 10 
to 30 days.  In summary, BIBF 1120 reduced lung inflammation demonstrated by reduced lymphocyte 
counts  in  the  bronchoalveolar  lavage  fluid  (BALF),  interleukin-1  ß , chemokine  (C-X-C  motif)  ligand 
1/keratinocyte chemoattractant detected in lung tissue, diminished percentage of myeloid dendritic cells 
in  lung  tissue  and  semiquantitative  histologic  analysis  of  H&E-stained  micrographs  of  the  lungs.  BIBF 
1120 treatment diminished lung fibrosis demonstrated by reduced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 
(TIMP)-1 and total lung collagen levels in lung tissue and by semiquantitative histologic analysis of the 
lungs  and  by  reduction  of  messenger  RNA  expression  of  fibrosis-related  marker  genes  (transforming 
growth factor (TGF)-ß1; procollagen I). A qualitative overview of the results is given in Table 3.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effect on CNS 
Irwin Test: BIBF 1120 chloride was administered in oral doses of 50, 100 and 300 mg/kg to male mice. 
General overt and covert behaviour and body temperature were assessed at 15, 30, 60 minutes, and 24 
hours post-administration. There was no effect on any of the tested behavioural parameter and on body 
temperature. A yellow discoloration of urine was noted 60 min following the 100 and 300 mg/kg dose. 
Nocturnal motility: BIBF 1120 chloride was administered orally in doses of 50, 100 and 300 mg/kg in 
groups of 7 mice. There was no inhibition or activation of locomotion by BIBF 1120 at any of the doses 
tested as compared to vehicle-treated animals (U02-1589). 
Electrophysiological assessment in vitro (U02-1288): Two assays (hERG and action potential 
configuration) assessing the effects of BIBF 1120 base on the electrophysiological parameters in vitro. In 
the hERG assay, concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 µM was tested in triplicate and the mean fraction 
of HERG current (I/I0) obtained was 0.92, 0.83, 0.53 and 0.25 respectively. BIBF 1120 base had an IC50 
value of 4.0 µM on hERG-mediated potassium current in HEK293 cells. 
Action potential configuration: In isolated papillary muscles from guinea pigs, the effect of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 
3.0 and 10.0 µM BIBF 1120 base on action potential duration (ADP) to 10%, 30% and 90% repolarisation 
(ADP10, ADP30 and ADP90 respectively), resting membrane potential, maximal velocity oof phase 0 
upstroke, AP overshoot, AP amplitude and the force of concentration was tested (N=5). In the current 
study setting, BIBF 1120 base had no effect on APD90 in concentrations up to 10 µM, or any other 
measured parameters. No effect was observed on myocardial repolarisation at human therapeutic plasma 
concentrations. 
Effect on Cardiovascular and Respiratory function 
Assessment report

In the study performed in conscious rats (U02-1398), chronically instrumented rats received a single oral 
dose of 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 CL, and the systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, temperature, 
motility and respiration rate and volume were recorded. Systemic arterial blood pressure increased 
dose-dependently. This effect lasted up to the end of the seven hour post-administration observation 
period. The increase in systolic systemic blood pressure was about 15 mm Hg in the highest dose group. 
No effects were observed for the remaining parameters measured. 
Anaesthetised domestic pigs (study U2-1674-02) were administered increasing doses of BIBF 1120 
chloride by intravenous infusion, starting at 3.0 mg/kg, escalating to 10 and 30 mg/kg in 30 minute 
intervals. The following parameters were measured and determined: systolic and diastolic arterial blood 
pressure, maximal left ventricular dP/dt (LVdP/dtmax), heart rate and ECG-intervals (QT, PR, QRS) from 
the electrocardiogram. Decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (see figure 1 below) and in 
LVdP/dt-max (see figure 3 below) was observed after starting the infusion of the highest dose (30 
mg/kg). These effects reversed after the end of dosing. No relevant changes were observed in the 
electrocardiographic parameters (QT-, QRS-, and PR interval). 
Effect on Renal and hepatic function in rats 
 Metabolic markers of renal and liver function were measured in both serum (Day 7 only) and urine (Days 
1 and 6) in rats (study U02-1260) treated orally with BIBF 1120 chloride at doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg 
for 7 days. After 7 days there was an up to 1.6-fold increase in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 
(GPT) in the animals given 100 mg/kg.  Also in this dose group, there was an increase of similar 
magnitude in serum triglyceride concentration.  Serum electrolytes were largely unchanged except for a 
mild increase in calcium at 100 mg/kg. 
BIBF 1120 caused a modest increase in urine volume and urine sodium (1.3-fold and 2.3-fold, 
respectively) between 4 and 8 hours post administration of 100 mg/kg on Day 1. There was also a 
1.5-fold increase in beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (beta-NAG) between 4 and 8 hours 
post-administration on Day 1 and a ~3-fold increase in Ca2+-output between 4 and 8 hours at 30 and 100 
mg/kg. At Day 6, the effects on urine volume, sodium and calcium were absent. 
Effect on Gastrointestinal function in rats (U02-1248, U02-1258 and U02-1259) 
Gastric function and gastrointestinal motility were assessed in male and female rats (N=5 per sex) 
treated orally with 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg of BIBF 1120 chloride (U02-1258). The doses of 10 and 30 
mg/kg induced no statistically significant effects on gastric emptying.  At 100 mg/kg a significant 
inhibition of gastric emptying was observed). Effects on gastric acid output, total acidity, gastric pH and 
volume following intraduodenal administration of 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 chloride to groups of 
7-8 male rats was assessed (U02-1248). No effects on gastric acid output, total acidity, gastric pH and 
volume were observed.  
The effects of BIBF 1120 chloride on gastrointestinal transit was investigated following administration of 
0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 chloride PO to male and female animals (5/sex/group). The 
gastrointestinal transit was determined as the percentage of the intestine length traversed by the test 
meal. BIBF 1120 did not influence gastrointestinal transit at 10 mg/kg PO, but at 30 and 100 mg /kg, 
intestinal transit was does-dependently reduced (U02-1259). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
There was no stand-alone GLP cardiovascular safety study, however, cardiovascular parameters have 
been assessed in non-GLP studies described in secondary pharmacodynamics section performed in rats 
and anaesthetized domestic pigs (U02-1398 and U02-1674). The following safety pharmacology core 
battery assessment was performed according to GLP, either as part of a repeat dose study (cardiovascular 
function in Cynomolgus monkeys) or in single dose studies (CNS and respiratory effects in rats).

Effect on Cardiovascular function (Cynomolgus monkeys - as part of the 4 week repeat dose toxicity study 
U03-1326, GLP) 
In the Cynomolgus monkeys study, dose levels were 0, 3, 15 and 60 mg/kg/day.  Electrocardiography 
(ECG) was recorded for all animals pre-treatment, prior to dosing on Day 1 as well as 2 and 24 hours after 
treatment on Day 1. In week 4 of treatment, all animals in groups 1 to 3 had ECG’s performed 2 and 24 
hours after treatment. Only 2 Group 4 animals were examined, as the remaining animals in this group had 
been terminated on Days 14 and 15 of the study due to clinical signs, and the two remaining animals had 
been of dosing since Day 15 (e.g. 2 weeks recovery). Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) 
measurements were also performed. 
Slight fluctuations were observed in the beats per minute heart rate (HR) on Day 1 pre-dose (HR 
192-270), where most animals exhibited increased heart rate compared to the measurement performed 
earlier in the pre-dose period (HR 156-258). In the high dose group a minor increase in heart rate at 
60 mg/kg/day by 5.7% versus the control group on Day 1 at 2 h post dosing. No other relevant effects on 
electrocardiographic parameters were found. 
Blood pressure data showed a slight tendency to decreased mean systolic pressure in the high-dose males 
and females on Day 1, 2 hours after dosing resulting from the slightly reduced individual values of 2 males 
and 3 females. After 24 hours, their values returned to levels similar to the pre-dose values except for 
female no. 453. Since a slight trend to decreased systolic pressure was also observed in the control group 
and similar values were also observed during the pre-dose period, this finding is considered not to be 
related to treatment.

Effect on respiratory function (in rats using study U03-1465) 
In this study, doses of 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg BIBF 1120 (as base) as a single PO dose was administered to 
male  and  female  Wistar  rats  (8/sex/group).  Morphine  sulphate  (200  mg/kg)  was  used  as  a  positive 
control, to ensure that the assay was performing as expected. The respiratory parameters; respiration 
rate, tidal volume and minute volume, were recorded pre-dose, at 30, 90, 150 and 300 minutes after 
dosing, as well as 24  hours after dosing. The rats  were placed in the chambers for approximately 16 
minutes at each observation time point (from 8 minutes before the time point to 8 minutes after). All 
groups (including the control group) showed the highest group mean respiration rate prior to treatment, 
approximately 350 breaths/minute, and the lowest group mean respiration rates were recorded at 150 
minutes  after  dosing  (158-218  breaths/minute).  However,  the  only  statistically  significant  difference 
observed between the control and treated groups, were at 30 and 90 minutes post dosing in the positive 
control group, treated with morphine sulphate.  
No marked or statistically significant changes following administration of BIBF 1120 were observed with 
regards to respiration rate, tidal volume or minute volume when compared to the vehicle treated animals.  
Effects on general behaviour, body temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity in rats (U02-1537, 
GLP) 
BIBF  1120  ES  was  administered  PO  to  rats  (4  animals/sex/group)  at  doses  of  0,  3,  20,  100  mg/kg. 
Subjective observations performed to assess the behaviour and physiological state of the animals were 
performed  prior  to  dosing,  and  at  30,  90,  150  and  300  minutes  as  well  as  24  hours  after  treatment. 
Assessment of locomotor activity and body temperature (measured rectally) was also performed at the 
same time points. The animals were kept under observation for 7 days after treatment to record signs of 
toxicity or mortalities.  
Oral administration of BIBF 1120 ES at doses of 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg (as base) produced no significant 
test article-induced changes in the behaviour or physiological state of rats. One female rat treated with 20 
mg/kg BIBF 1120 exhibited slight tremor and piloerection at 30 and 90 minutes and slight tremor at 150 
minutes post treatment. As only one animal at the intermediate dose level exhibited these mild changes, 
it was considered to be incidental, and not related to treatment. In addition,  no significant effects on 
locomotor activity or body temperature were recorded in this study.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No investigations on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been submitted.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  non-clinical  pharmacokinetics  and  drug  metabolism  of  BIBF  1120  were  studied  in  mice,  rats, 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  and  Rhesus  monkeys  and  were  compared  to  the  pharmacokinetics  and  drug 
metabolism  of  BIBF  1120  in  humans.  The  species  and  strains  were  identical  with  those  used  in 
pharmacology  and  toxicity  studies.  A  number  of  liquid  chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) assays was developed and validated in order to quantify BIBF 1120, the major metabolites 
BIBF  1202  (M1)  and  BIBF  1202  glucuronide  (M2)  as  well  as  CDBB  213  (BIBF  1120  Anilin)  in  plasma 
samples from several species. A number of non-validated methods were utilized for sample analyses in 
some  range  finding  and  PK  studies;  these  methods  followed  the  same  general  assay  concept  as  the 
validated methods.  
Absorption  
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 23/85  
  
  
 
 
 
In vitro studies of BIBF 1120 absorption in cells showed that permeability through bio-membranes was 
high, e.g. within minutes, the BIBF 1120 radioactivity was associated with the cell fraction in the test 
system, both at 37˚C and 4˚C the transport process was most likely passive.  
Bioavailability was low in humans (4.7%) as well as the non clinical species approximately 11% (rat) to 
23.8% (rhesus monkey). Intestinal P-gp activity was suspected to contribute to the low bioavailability 
due to incomplete absorption form the intestinal tract. In addition, first pass metabolism in the liver and 
intestine further contribute to the low bioavailability observed. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of BIBF 1120 was high in mice, rats and humans, at 97% to 98.5%, and 
slightly  lower  in  the  non-human  primates  Rhesus  and  Cynomolgus  monkeys  (91%  to  93%).  Tissue 
distribution  studies  showed  that  the  high  binding  to  plasma  protein  did  not  restrict  BIBF  1120  to  the 
vascular  compartment,  but  rather  rapid  and  extensive  distribution  of  BIBF  1120  was  apparent  in  rat 
tissues at 5 minutes after IV administration. Repeated oral dosing (30 mg/kg [14C]BIBF 1120) for 13 
days showed a slight accumulation in some tissues (testes, salivary gland, epididymides and liver), albeit 
a similar accumulation in plasma concentrations was not apparent.  
Placental  transfer  of  BIBF  1120  was  not  examined,  although  maternal  exposure  was  determined  in 
embryo-foetal  development  studies,  no  exposure  data  was  generated  for  the  foetuses,  and  no 
conclusions  on  the  possible  placental  transfer  can  be  made.  Excretion  of  BIBF  1120  into  milk  was 
examined in female Wistar rats on Day 12 of lactation, and the average concentration at 1 hour after 
dosing  was  approximately  10-fold  lower  than  the  plasma  concentration  (269  and  2260  ng/mL 
respectively). The total estimated BIBF 1120 radioactivity secreted to milk over a 24 hour period was 
0.18-0.5%. 
Metabolism 
BIBF 1120 showed high clearance in all species. Metabolic elimination was the major clearance pathway, 
with m1 (BIBF 1202) as the primary metabolite excreted via in faeces in all species. Approximately 10 to 
30 % of the orally administered BIBF 1120 was recovered unchanged in the faeces of the  nonclinical 
species, and approximately 20 % was recovered in human faeces. In the tabularised presentation of the 
major  metabolites  in  plasma  (as  %  of  sample  radioactivity),  the  metabolite  M7  is  listed  to  represent 
11.6%.  The  remaining  metabolites  following  oral  administration  of  BIBF  1120  was  present  in  smaller 
amounts less than 10% for most except in mice, where m3 and m4 was present at approximately 10 and 
20 % respectively. 
Excretion 
Excretion and mass balance studies were carried out in mice, rats, Rhesus monkeys and human subjects 
using [14C]-radio-labelled BIBF 1120. Following both IV and PO dosing, the major fraction of radioactivity 
was recovered in faeces. Following IV dose, biliary excretion was the major contributing factor, however, 
following oral dose, the amount secreted in the bile was significantly less. Urinary excretion of BIBF 1120 
associated radioactivity was largest following IV dose (approximately 5% of the dose) whereas following 
PO dose, this was much smaller (1.2, 1.5 and 0.65 % in rat, Rhesus monkey and human respectively). 
This is probably due to incomplete absorption of BIBF 1120 form the intestinal tract.

The major route of excretion of BIBF 1120 following IV dose is faecal and biliary with approximately 5% 
of the dose being excreted via urine. Following PO dose, faecal excretion is higher in the rat, but similar 
in the Rhesus monkey, and urinary excretion decreases to approximately 1.5 % in the nonclinical species. 
Biliary excretion is higher following IV administration than PO administration, indicating together with the 
lower urinary excretion that absorption from the intestinal tract following PO administration is incomplete. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Dose-dependent inhibition of OCT1 by BIBF 1120 was demonstrated, but not of other hepatic transporters 
tested. The IC50 value of BIBF 1120 for OCT1 was estimated to be 0.88 ìM i.e. 15-fold higher than the 
maximum plasma concentration of BIBF 1120 (30 ng/mL: 0.06 ìM) after 150 mg oral administration to 
humans.  Therefore,  potent  inhibition  of  OCT1  by  BIBF  1120  under  in  vivo  conditions  is  considered 
unlikely.  
Efflux transport studies suggest involvement of P-gp in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1120, 
while P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP appear to have little role in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1202.  
BIBF 1202 glucuronide is a substrate of BCRP and MRP2, but not of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and 
OCT1. Transport of BIBF 1202 glucuronide by P-gp was not performed due to experimental limitations.  
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
The pharmacokinetic properties of BIBF 1120 as well as its phase I metabolite BIBF 1202 and the phase 
II metabolite BIBF 1202-glucuronide were investigated in rats after single intravenous doses (U10-2525).  
BIBF  1120  was  additionally  investigated  after  single  oral  doses.  Pharmacokinetics  of  BIBF  1120  is 
characterized by a high volume of distribution (2.86 L/kg for the central compartment and 15.7 L/kg at 
steady state) and a high plasma clearance of 91.8 (mL/min)/kg. 
For  BIBF  1202,  the  volumes  of  distribution  were  markedly  smaller  than  those  for  BIBF  1120 
(approximately 0.4 and 0.3 L/kg, respectively), but still considerably greater than the plasma or blood 
volume of the rat. The clearance of BIBF 1202 was moderate with 25.9 (mL/min)/kg. 
The glucuronide of BIBF 1202 was distributed almost instantaneously into a volume of approximately the 
plasma space of the rat (0.0389 L/kg) and showed an only slightly higher volume of distribution at steady 
state (V(ss) of 0.0556 L/kg).

The oral administration of BIBF 1120 led to absolute bioavailabilities of 10.9% for BIBF 1120, 2.2% for 
BIBF 1202 and 2.5% for BIBF 1202-glucuronide. The metabolites BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202-glucuronide 
were mainly formed pre-systemically after oral dosing of BIBF 1120.

In the rodent studies of longer duration than 14 days, dentopathy was observed at dose levels above 20 
mg/kg/day and consequently lower body weight and body weight gains were also observed. Due to the 
observed dentopathies, powdered diet was offered to the animals.  
13-week (MTD) study in mice (U10-1798) 
The objective of this 13-week toxicity study was to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BIBF 1120, 
when  administered  to  mice  over  13  weeks,  and  to  aid  the  selection  of  dose  levels  for  a  subsequent 
carcinogenicity study. BIBF 1120 was administered at dosages of 0, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day for 13 
weeks to four groups of animals, each comprising 12 male and 12 female CD-1 mice. In order to obtain 
blood samples for toxicokinetics, a further 8 males and females were allocated to the control group, and 
12  male  and  females  to  the  treated  groups.  During  the  study,  clinical  condition,  bodyweight,  food 
consumption,  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  toxicokinetics,  organ  weight,  gross  pathology  and 
histopathology investigations were undertaken. 
At the end of the 13-week administration period, discoloured white incisors were noted from Week 7 for 
animals given 100 mg/kg/day. A broken tooth was also recorded in Weeks 10/11 for one female receiving 
100  mg/kg/day.  Overall  body  weight  gain  was  lower  than  that  of  controls  for  all  treated  groups  in  a 
dose-related manner (males/females: 0.74X/0.75X controls at 10 mg/kg/day, 0.59X/0.85X controls at 
30 mg/kg/day and 0.55X/0.54X controls at 100 mg/kg/day).  Haematology investigations revealed low 
red  blood  cell  count  (max.  effect  0.86X  control),  low  reticulocyte  counts  for  females  receiving  30 or 
100 mg/kg/day (max. effect 0.63X control) and high mean cell haemoglobin and mean cell volume (max. 
effect 1.2X control) for animals receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg/day. Platelet counts were low (max. 0.80X 
control) for males and females receiving 100 mg/kg/day.   
Blood  chemistry  investigations  revealed  slightly  high  bilirubin  concentrations  for  males  receiving  100 
mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 without a histopathological correlate.  Total protein and albumin concentrations 
were slightly low resulting in a slightly low albumin to globulin ratio for females receiving 100 mg/kg/day 
(max. effect 0.94X control). 
Absolute,  body  weight-relative  and  brain  weight-relative  liver  weights  were  low  for  all  treated  female 
groups (max. 0.75X control) and, to a lesser extent, for males receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 
(max. 0.84X control).  Absolute, body weight-relative and brain weight-relative heart weights were low 
for females receiving 100 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 (max. 0.81X control).

Histopathological  changes  were  thickening  of  the  growth  plate  (due  to  increased  hypertrophic 
chondrocytes)  and  increased  swelling  of  chondrocytes  in  the  basal  layers  of  the  articular  cartilage  in 
femur  and  tibia,  cellular  depletion  in  the  bone  marrow,  dentopathy  of  the  incisor  teeth,  increased 
extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen and liver, diffuse cortical hypertrophy in the adrenals, and 
decreased numbers of mature corpora lutea and increased numbers of luteinised follicles in the ovaries. 
In summary, oral administration of BIBF 1120 to CD-1 mice at doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day for 
13 weeks was associated with changes in the bone and bone marrow, teeth and spleen of both sexes, in 
the liver and adrenals of males, and in the ovaries of females receiving 100 mg/kg/day. The dosage of 30 
mg/kg/day was considered to be close to the MTD. NOAEL was not established. 
26-week toxicity study in CrlGlxBrlHan:WI rats (U05-1843) 
Groups of 20 male and 20 female Han Wistar rats received daily oral doses of 0, 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day 
BIBF 1120 over a period of 26 weeks, followed by an 8 week recovery period. In order to obtain blood 
samples for toxicokinetics, a further 6 males and females were allocated to each group, and a further 10 
male and females were allocated to the control and high dose groups to allow for a treatment free period 
(recovery)  at  the  end  of  the  study.  During  the  study,  mortality,  clinical  condition,  bodyweight,  food 
consumption,  ophthalmoscopy,  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  toxicokinetics,  organ  weight,  gross 
pathology and histopathology investigations were performed. 
5 mg/kg/day dose group: No evident adverse effects considered to be drug-related were observed. 
20 mg/kg/day dose group: Two animals (one male, one female) were prematurely sacrificed due to poor 
general  condition  with  histopathological  changes  indicating  a  severe  (incidental)  chronic  progressive 
nephropathy and liver hemosiderosis. In males, body weight gain was slightly reduced.  Clinically, 3/20 
males and 9/20 females had broken incisors (regularly growing back and breaking again) and almost all 
animals showed swelling and reddening of the gingiva. Thymus weight in males was slightly reduced.  
Histopathologically, in some animals there were minimal to slight drug-related effects on the liver, spleen, 
kidneys, bone marrow, thymus, ovaries, epiphyseal growth plates, articular cartilage and incisors.  All 
these findings were dose-related.  They are described below together with those of the 80 mg/kg/day 
dose group. 
80 mg/kg/day dose group: Five males and three females were found dead or were prematurely sacrificed 
due to poor general condition caused by broken incisors and resulting reduced food consumption.  The 
remaining animals were prematurely sacrificed on day 165/166 (except recovery animals) due to poor 
general condition and lack of body weight gain in males. In males, there was no body weight gain from 
Day 50 on.   
Findings from both the 20 and 80 mg/kg/day dose groups: Clinical pathology investigations revealed a 
mild, reversible decrease in red blood cell parameters (red blood cell count, hematocrit and hemoglobin) 
and an increase in reticulocytes. White blood cell count and platelet count were also slightly increased. 
Clinical  chemistry  revealed  a  mild  increase  in  the  activity  of  ALT,  aldolase  and  GLDH  in  both  sexes. 
Urinalysis revealed strongly increased protein concentration and presence of white blood cells in some 
animals.  At  the  end  of  the  recovery  period,  the  activity  of  aldolase  was  still  increased  in  both  sexes. 
Microscopically, there were drug- and dose-related effects on the liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, bone 
marrow, thymus, ovaries, epiphyseal growth plates, joint cartilage, incisors and the main bile duct with 
adjacent  organs.  The  major  findings  were  graded  as  moderate  or  severe.  Almost  all  findings  were 
completely reversible or ameliorated during the recovery period (high-dose group).

Findings which were not observed or not as prominent in previous toxicity studies in rats were periportal 
hemosiderosis in the liver, moderate or severe mineralisation of the capsule and trabecules in the spleen, 
severe  dilatation  of  the  main  extra-hepatic  bile  duct  probably  induced  or  aggravated  by  a  narrow 
duodenal orifice of the duct and accompanied by a moderate to severe inflammation and a pronounced 
hyperplasia of the ductal epithelial cells, minimal to mild signs of unspecific tubular injury in the kidneys, 
slight to severe peliosis/angiectasis and, only in males, diffuse hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex, slight to 
severe cellular depletion in the bone marrow, minimal to mild lymphoid depletion in the spleen, moderate 
involution of the thymus and reduced size and sparse vascularisation of corpora lutea (often associated 
with an increase in number) in the ovaries.

13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey (U05-2245).  
Groups of 3 males and 3 females received doses of 0, 3, 15 or 30 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 by oral gavage. 
A further 2 male and 2 female monkeys were assigned to the Control and high dose groups which were 
retained for a 4 week recovery period following the 13 week treatment period. During the study, clinical 
condition, bodyweight, food consumption, ophthalmic examination, ECG, haematology, blood chemistry, 
toxicokinetics,  urinalysis,  organ  weight,  macroscopic  and  microscopic  pathology  investigations  were 
performed. 
Because of clinical signs of diarrhea and loose/liquid faeces in animals given 30 mg/kg/day, the high dose 
was lowered to 20 mg/kg/day after a 3-day off treatment period.  At 15 and 30/20 mg/kg/day the animals 
showed  reduced  body  weight  gain  or  body  weight  loss.  Pertinent  histopathological  changes  were 
decreased  cellularity  of  the  thymic  cortex  and  fatty  replacement  of  the  bone  marrow.    Though  also 
present  in  some  control  animals,  their  incidence  and  severity  were  increased  in  treated  animals  and 
showed a dosage-related trend.  All bone marrow smears, however, were considered to be normal for 
cellularity, distribution and morphology. 
52-week toxicity study in Rhesus monkey (U07-1875) 
Groups of 4 male and 4 female Rhesus monkeys received doses of 0, 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 
by oral gavage for 52 weeks. Additionally 2 males and 2 females were allocated to the control and high 
dose  groups  and  were  allowed  a  4-week  treatment  free  period  at  the  end  of  the  study  to  observe 
recovery. As a result of adverse clinical signs seen in high dose animals, this group had a 20 day off-dose 
period following the first 4 weeks of treatment. The high dose was reduced stepwise from 60 to 45 and 
then to 30 mg/kg/day. Three weeks of treatment were added at the end of the study with the remaining 
animals from this group. 
During  the  study,  clinical  condition,  bodyweight,  ophthalmic  examination,  EGC,  haematology,  blood 
chemistry,  toxicokinetics,  urinalysis,  immunology,  organ  weights,  macropathology  and  histopathology 
investigations were performed. 
In the high dose group one male and one female were killed due to severe clinical signs including liquid 
faeces,  vomiting,  pale  gums,  salivation,  hypoactivity,  thin  build  and  hunched  posture.  Similar  effects 
were  also  observed  in  the  other  high  dose  animals.  Mixed  coliform  Spp.  (particularly  E.  coli)  and/or 
Campylobacter Spp. bacteria were detected in the rectum and/or faeces, and may have contributed to the 
severity of liquid faeces. Reduced body weight was observed in all treated groups, but only statistically 
significant at the two highest dose levels. Statistically significant reductions of large unstained cells were 
observed  in  all  groups,  while  only  at  the  top  dose  for  basophils,  erythrocytes  and  platelets.  Blood 
chemistry showed elevated levels of chloride (all doses) and reduced levels of albumin and total protein 
(highest dose). Growth plate thickening in the femur, atrophy of adrenal zone fasciculata and reductions 
in spleen weight were present in all dose groups, while significant reductions in lung and bronchi weight 
were seen at the highest dose only. No other effects than growth plate thickening in the femur was still 
present  at  the  end  of  recovery.  Electrocardiography,  ophthalmoscopy,  urinalysis,  peripheral  blood 
leukocyte analysis and macroscopic pathology did not indicate any treatment-related changes. 
In addition, two mini-pig studies were performed in order to evaluate the sensitivity of this non-rodent 
species to liver enzyme elevations induced by BIBF 1120 which have been observed in patients.  
Oral exploratory 2-day toxicity study in mini-pigs (U11-1349, non-GLP) 
An oral dose of 50 mg/kg BIBF 1120 was administered on 2 consecutive days to 1 male and 1 female 
mini-pig. Slight increases in the activity of AST, ALT and GLDH and decreases in bilirubin and triglycerides 
on Day 2 were considered of no biological relevance.

Oral 7-day toxicity study in mini-pigs (U07-2343, non-GLP) 
Oral doses of 0, 50, 70 and 100 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 were administered to a total of 3 male animals, and 
0, 40, and 50 mg/kg/day to a total of 3 female animals. The maximum continuous administration per dose 
was 7 days. Toxicokinetic measurements demonstrated substantial exposure (C(max) of 538 ng/mL and 
AUC(0-24h) of 9010 ng·h/mL at 100 mg/kg/day in the males).  Five of 6 animals had to be sacrificed.  
Despite of the severe clinical signs, only inconsistent increases in AST (up to 123.4 U/L) and ALT (up to 
86.4  U/L)  were  observed  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  period.    No  other  significant  changes  of  liver 
parameters were observed (AP, gamma-GT, LDH, bilirubin).

Fertility and early embryonic development 
Male fertility and subsequent early embryonic development was investigated following administration of 
BIBF 1120 at 0, 3, 20 and 100 mg/kg/day PO to male rats. Treatment started 92 days before mating. The 
females  received  treatment  with  vehicle  only  from  gestation  day  1  through  6.  Clinical  signs,  food 
consumption,  body  weight  were  recorded  for  the  parental  animals.  Copulation,  fertility  and  gestation 
rates were recorded.  
In  the  treated  males,  loose  and  broken  teeth  were  observed  at  20  and  100  mg/kg  (4/24  and  23/24 
animals respectively), and decreased food consumption and bodyweight fluctuations (mid dose group) 
and body weight loss (high dose group) was observed from 20 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120. With respect to 
reproductive  parameters,  all  males  in  all  groups  mated  successfully,  and  copulation,  fertility  and 
gestation indices were all 100% in both control group as well as the treated groups. Litter parameters 
(resorptions, resorption rate and pre-implantation loss) were comparable between control and treated 
groups. Slight decrease in the mean number of corpora lutea (20 mg/kg) and slight increases in the mean 
numbers of total resorptions, early resorptions and resorption rate (all at 3 mg/kg) were within the ranges 
of means in the evaluation studies of Viertel et al. (2004 and 2005). 
Embryo-fœtal development 
Two studies were performed in rats to assess the effects of BIBF 1120 on embryofetal development. In 
the first study doses of 30, 75 and 180 mg/kg were used, and complete loss of embryos was observed at 
all  dose  levels.  Another  study,  with  lower  doses  of  5,  10  and  20  mg/kg/day  with  the  dosing  period 
spanning from gestation day 7 to 16 was performed. In this study, complete resorption of the embryos 
was  observed  at  20  mg/kg  and  at  the  lower  doses,  skeletal  variations  (5  and  10  mg/kg),  as  well  as 
dysmorphogenesis of blood vessels (10 mg/kg) were observed.   
A dose range study was performed in female rabbits treated with BIBF 1120 by oral gavage with 0, 3, 7, 
15, 30, 75, 180 mg/kg/day (6 animals per group) from GD 6 to 18. Maternal toxicity was observed in the 
high dose group (180 mg/kg/day), 1 animal found dead and 2 euthanized due to poor general condition 
on  GD  15.  Unusually  yellow  urine  was  observed  from  doses  of  75  mg/kg/day.  Embryotoxicity  was 
observed  form  75  mg/kg/day,  where  increased  resorption  rate  was  observed,  and  2  females  had 
complete abortions. Complete fetal resorption was also observed at 180 mg/kg/day. No fetal or maternal 
toxicity  was  demonstrated  at  30  mg/kg/day  or  below.  A  teratogenic  effect  was  observed  in  the  75 
mg/kg/day  group.  The  results  in  this  preliminary  study  support  a  dose  proposal  of  15,  30  and  60 
mg/kg/day for low-, mid- and high-dose levels in a subsequent pivotal embryofetal toxicity study. 
Toxicokinetics 
Blood samples for exposure and toxicokinetics were taken in most of the toxicology studies; results of 
AUC and Cmax obtained in the studies summarised in table X. For the calculation of exposure multiples, 
the oral dosage of 250 mg bid as Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD).

Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of BIBF 1120 was assessed in 5 studies, where both dermal tolerance (U05-1395), 
potential  for  eye  irritation  (U03-1151),  injection  either  intravenous  (U08-1862),  intramuscular 
(U08-1862), intra-arterial (08B041) or paravenous (U08-1863) were assessed. In addition a study was 
performed to assess the haemolytic potential of BIBF 1120 formulated in a solution for infusion (09B032).  
In the local tolerance studies performed BIBF 1120 was found to be well tolerated following dermal 
application, in an aqueous solution (0.5 g solubilised in water applied topically to skin of rabbits); ocular 
application of 20 mg powdered administered once in the conjunctival sac of rabbits; intravenous 
administration in rabbits (2 mg/mL in 5 % glucose). Nintedanib was found to cause local irritation 
following intra-arterial administration in rabbits (2 mg/mL in 5% glucose); paravenous administration in 
rats (2 mg/mL in 5% glucose); intramuscular administration in rabbits (2 mg/mL in 5% glucose). The 
haemolytic potential was found to be very low, as only hemolysis of up to 0.5% was observed when 2.0 
mg/mL BIBF 1120 was applied.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunological investigations (phenotyping of lymphoid subpopulations in blood, spleen and thymus, as 
well as determination of spleen natural killer cell activity) were performed in the 4-week toxicity study in 
rats (U04-1812), in the 13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (U05-2245) and in the 52-week 
toxicity study in Rhesus monkeys (U07-1875). 
In  male  rats  of  the  4-week  toxicity  study  (U04-1812),  a  decreased  T-  to  B-lymphocyte  ratio  in  the 
peripheral blood and spleen of all animals given the high dose level of 100 mg/kg/day, an approximate 
30% decrease in T-helper cells (CD3+CD4+) of the blood and a slight increase in natural-killer cell activity 
in the spleen were observed. 
In the 13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (U05-2245), no changes of CD4 and CD8 positive 
T cells and NK cells were observed. In peripheral blood, a mild reduction of B cells was noted in study 
week 13. No changes were present at the end of the recovery period. 
In the 52-week toxicity study in Rhesus monkeys (U07-1875), no consistent changes of peripheral blood 
monocytes,  B  and  T  cell  subsets  and  NK  cells  were  observed.    There  were  also  no  changes  in  the 
percentages of splenic B and T cell subsets and NK cells and no statistically significant changes in NK cell 
function. In animals at 60/45/30 mg/kg/day, however, there was evidence of a decrease in the absolute 
numbers  of  all  cell  types  per  gram  of  spleen  tissue.  No  changes  of  any  parameter  including  NK  cell 
function were present at the end of the recovery period. 
Metabolites 
The major human metabolite is BIBF 1202 (free acid) and BIBF 1202 glucuronide, contributing up to 32 
and  47%  of  total  radioactivity  following  100  mg  BIBF  1120.  Toxicokinetic  analyses  have  revealed 
substantial systemic exposure to BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 glucuronide in the general toxicity studies. 
However, due to low formation of BIBF 1202 in the in vitro genotoxicity studies with BIBF 1120, BIBF 
1202 was tested separately in the in vitro genotoxicity assays (see table below).

Impurities 
A number of potential impurities were identified, classified and genotoxic investigations performed where 
specified according to alerts and classification. Genotoxic impurities which might be present in DS were 
always below 3 ppm corresponding to the TTC of 1.5 µg/day at a maximum daily dose of 250 mg bid of 
BIBF 1120, which is the highest dose level in any of the indications of nintedanib. Therefore, none of these 
genotoxic impurities have been specified.

The impurity CDBB 213 is an intermediate of chemical synthesis and potential degradant of BIBF 1120. It 
has an aromatic amine moiety, which is in general a structural alert for mutagenicity. It may be formed 
under acidic conditions. In the case of delayed gastric emptying, soft gelatine capsules with BIBF 1120 
may stay in the acidic milieu of the stomach for up to 7-8 hours. Based on in vitro data, it is estimated that 
this may result in a maximum degradation of BIBF 1120 to CDBB 213 of approximately 3%. Assuming a 
maximum daily dose of 250 mg bid of BIBF 1120, this percentage of degradation would result in an 
exposure of maximally ~0.3 mg/kg/day or ~1.15 µmol/kg/day of CDBB 213 in human patients. 
CDBB 213 was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Ames test, but showed clastogenic 
effects at very high concentrations in the 24h-incubation experiment in the mouse lymphoma assay.  
CDBB 213 was negative withj respect to genotoxicity endpoints in a 2-week rat toxicity study, where bone 
marrow micronucleus assay and the Comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in the liver, were 
assessed. A NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day was established for CCBB 213 in the 14 day repeat dose toxicity study 
performed. 
Phototoxicity 
In accordance with the OECD Guideline 432, a phototoxicity assay was conducted with Balb/c 3T3 cells 
(U05-2272).  A phototoxic threshold concentration of approximately 0.5 µg/mL was estimated.  At this 
concentration, the Photo Effect (PEC) was around the phototoxicity limit of 0.15. A Photo Irritating Factor 
(PIF) of 18.4 and a Mean Photo Effect (MPE) of 0.554 and 0.560 indicate that BIBF 1120 may have a 
phototoxic potential.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
BIBF 1120 was tested for its ability to interfere with essential processes occurring in fibrotic lung diseases 
like IPF in a variety of in vitro assays and in vivo systems.  
The in vivo activity of BIBF 1120, as a single agent, was investigated in mouse and rat models of lung 
fibrosis.  In all experiments BIBF 1120 was always dosed in a preventive, but also in a therapeutic 
manner, i.e. after onset of fibrotic lung pathology.  In all studies, preventive and therapeutic 
administration of BIBF 1120 reduced both bleomycin and silica induced lung fibrosis and inflammation in 
mice and rats.   
On the molecular level, BIBF 1120 is thought to inhibit the FGFR, PDGFR and VEGFR signalling cascades 
mediating lung fibroblast proliferation and migration by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
binding pocket of the intracellular receptor kinase domain. In vitro, the target receptors are inhibited by 
BIBF 1120 in low nanomolar concentrations. In human lung fibroblasts BIBF 1120 inhibited 
PDGF-stimulated PDGFR activation determined by receptor autophosphorylation. BIBF1202, the main 
metabolite of BIBF 1120 was 265-fold and 607-fold less potent than BIBF 1120 in inhibiting the 
autophosphorylation of PDGFRα and β, respectively. In human lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF 
BIBF 1120 inhibited PDGF-, FGF-, and VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation with EC50 values of 11 nmol/L, 
5.5 nmol/L and less than 1 nmol/L, respectively. BIBF 1202 was not tested in the fibroblast proliferation 
assay. At concentrations between 100 and 1000 nmol/L BIBF 1120 also inhibited PDGF-, FGF-, and 
VEGF-stimulated fibroblast migration and TGF-ß2-induced fibroblasts to myofibroblast transformation. 
The contribution of the anti-angiogenic activity of BIBF 1120 to its mechanism of action in fibrotic lung 
diseases is currently not clarified.

Page 41/85  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, BIBF 1120 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 
(VEGFR 1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR á and ß) and fibroblast growth factor 
receptors (FGFR 1-3) kinase activity. BIBF 1120 binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signaling which is crucial for the migration, 
proliferation and transformation of lung fibroblasts the hallmark cells of IPF. In addition Fms-like 
tyrosine-protein kinase (Flt)-3, Lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase (Lck) and proto-oncogene 
tyrosine-protein kinase src (Src) are inhibited (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The secondary pharmacodynamics of BIBF 1120 was determined in an array of studies where effects of 
treatment with BIBF 1120 by oral gavage at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg in most in vivo studies, except the 
mouse CNS study where doses of 50, 100 and 300 mg/kg, was examined with respect to CNS (general 
behaviour, body temperature and locomotor activity in mice); Cardiovascular effects (hERG assay in 
HEK293 cells and action potential configuration in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle cells, as well as in 
vivo studies in conscious rats and anaesthetized domestic pigs); Gastrointestinal effects, including gastric 
emptying, output, pH and volume and gastrointestinal transit (in rats); Hepatic and renal function. No 
relevant effects were shown. The results of the hepatic function assay were therefore not predictive for 
the hepatotoxic effects of high dosages of BIBF 1120 observed in the clinic (See Discussion on Clinical 
Safety). 
In the core safety pharmacology studies, no significant effects of BIBF 1120 treatment was observed on 
respiratory parameters or in general behaviour, body temperature and locomotor activity in rats. 
Similarly, with respect to cardiovascular parameters, only slight and transient increased heart rate was 
observed in the high dose group 1 and 2 hours after dosing on Day 1 (5.7% increase compared to control 
group), and a slight tendency to decreased mean systolic pressure in the high-dose males and females on 
Day 1, 2 hours after dosing resulting from the slightly reduced individual values of 2 males and 3 females.  
The lack of any specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetic in vitro and in vivo studies describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion of BIBF 1120 in the nonclinical species used, as well as in vitro metabolism data from human 
hepatocytes. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies on the major metabolites BIBF 1202 and BIBF 
1202 glucuronide was also performed. 
In vitro studies of BIBF 1120 absorption in cells showed that permeability through bio-membranes was 
high, e.g. within minutes, the BIBF 1120 radioactivity was associated with the cell fraction in the test 
system, both at 37˚C and 4˚C the transport process was most likely passive.  
Bioavailability was low in humans (4.7%) as well as in the non-clinical species (from approximately 11% 
in rat to 23.8% in rhesus monkey). Intestinal P-gp activity was suspected to contribute to the low 
bioavailability due to incomplete absorption form the intestinal tract. In addition, first pass metabolism in 
the liver and intestine further contribute to the low bioavailability observed. 
The plasma protein binding of BIBF 1120 was high in mice, rats and humans, at 97% to 98.5%, and 
slightly lower in the non-human primates Rhesus and Cynomolgus monkeys (91% to 93%). Tissue 
distribution studies showed that the high binding to plasma protein did not restrict BIBF 1120 to the 
vascular compartment, but rather rapid and extensive distribution of BIBF 1120 was apparent in rat 
tissues at 5 minutes after IV administration. Repeated oral dosing (30 mg/kg [14C]BIBF 1120) for 13 
days showed a slight accumulation in some tissues (testes, salivary gland, epididymides and liver), albeit 
a similar accumulation in plasma concentrations was not apparent.  
Placental transfer of BIBF 1120 was not examined, although maternal exposure was determined in 
embryo-foetal development studies, no exposure data was generated for the foetuses, and no

conclusions on the possible placental transfer can be made. Excretion of BIBF 1120 into milk was 
examined in female Wistar rats on Day 12 of lactation, and the average concentration at 1 hour after 
dosing was approximately 10-fold lower than the plasma concentration (269 and 2260 ng/mL 
respectively). The total estimated BIBF 1120 radioactivity secreted to milk over a 24 hour period was 
0.18-0.5%. In rats, small amounts of radiolabelled nintedanib and/or its metabolites were excreted into 
the milk (≤ 0.5 % of the administered dose) (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
BIBF 1120 showed high clearance in all species. Metabolic elimination was the major clearance pathway, 
with m1 (BIBF 1202) as the primary metabolite excreted via in faeces in all species. Approximately 10 to 
30 % of the orally administered BIBF 1120 was recovered unchanged in the faeces of the nonclinical 
species, and approximately 20 % was recovered in human faeces. In the tabularised presentation of the 
major metabolites in plasma (as % of sample radioactivity), the metabolite M7 is listed to represent 
11.6%. The remaining metabolites following oral administration of BIBF 1120 was present in smaller 
amounts less than 10% for most except in mice, where m3 and m4 was present at approximately 10 and 
20 % respectively. 
The major route of excretion of BIBF 1120 following IV dose is faecal and biliary with approximately 5% 
of the dose being excreted via urine. Following PO dose, faecal excretion is higher in the rat, but similar 
in the Rhesus monkey, and urinary excretion decreases to approximately 1.5 % in the nonclinical species. 
Biliary excretion is higher following IV administration than PO administration, indicating together with the 
lower urinary excretion that absorption from the intestinal tract following PO administration is incomplete. 
Dose-dependent inhibition of OCT1 by BIBF 1120 was demonstrated, but not of other hepatic transporters 
tested. The IC50 value of BIBF 1120 for OCT1 was estimated to be 0.88 ìM i.e. 15-fold higher than the 
maximum plasma concentration of BIBF 1120 (30 ng/mL: 0.06 ìM) after 150 mg oral administration to 
humans. Therefore, potent inhibition of OCT1 by BIBF 1120 under in vivo conditions is considered 
unlikely.  
Efflux transport studies suggest involvement of P-gp in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1120, 
while P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP appear to have little role in the biliary and urinary excretion of BIBF 1202.  
BIBF 1202 glucuronide is a substrate of BCRP and MRP2, but not of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1 and 
OCT1. Transport of BIBF 1202 glucoronide by P-gp was not performed due to experimental limitations.  
An extensive toxicology program has been performed in rodents and non-rodents. For the selection of the 
most relevant non-rodent species for long-term toxicity studies, dogs, mini-pigs, Cynomolgus monkeys 
and Rhesus monkeys were considered. The dog was identified as the most sensitive, however, not 
considered most relevant due to severe gastro-intestinal effects, since the severe gastrointestinal effects 
were considered to prevent this species from attaining sufficient long-term exposure necessary to detect 
potential chronic effects of BIBF 1120 on other organ systems than the GI tract. Further, dogs were 
determined not to be a suitable species to investigate the liver enzyme elevations observed in patients, 
since only moderate increases in transaminase activities were observed. These elevations were seen 
when the dogs were moribund due to the severe adverse gastrointestinal effects (diarrhoea and 
vomiting). The mini-pig was also considered not to be an appropriate species to study liver enzyme 
elevations observed in the clinical setting, as this species showed severe clinical signs, but only slight and 
inconsistent increases in AST and ALT at the end of the treatment period. The Cynomolgus and Rhesus 
monkey also showed gastro-intestinal effects, although not to the same degree as the dog, and was 
therefore chosen as the non-rodent species most relevant for the toxicology program. 
The single dose of 40 mg/kg BIBF 1120 IV or 2000 mg/kg orally was well tolerated in mice and rats. In 
rats treated with 2000 mg/kg orally general, nonspecific, signs of toxicity were observed on the first day 
of treatment, e.g. sedation, staggering gait and diarrhoea, but the signs subsided and all animals 
proceeded to planned necropsy. No changes were observed at gross pathology of the animals. No single

dose studies were performed in non-rodents. This is acceptable according to ICH guideline M3(R2), acute 
toxicity information from two mammalian species dosed both via the clinical route and a parenteral (in 
this case IV) route. 
The toxicity profile of BIBF 1120 was explored in both mice (up to 13 weeks) and rats (up to 26 weeks). 
In the long-term studies LOAEL (mouse) and NOAEL (rat) of <10 and 5 mg/kg/day were found. The most 
prominent treatment related findings which were considered to be related to the pharmacodynamic 
activity of BIBF 1120 as a VEGFR-2 inhibitor was: dentopathies of the continuously growing incisors which 
in turn contributed to the lower body weight and body weight gains observed, the thickening of the growth 
plates in long bones, PAS-positive hyaline intracytoplasmic granules in podocytes and glomerular 
endothelium of the glomeruli of the kidneys and the reduced size/increased number of corpora lutea and 
presence of luteinized follicles in the ovaries and lastly cellular depletion of the bone marrow which may 
be related to the various roles VEGF has in hematopoiesis.  
Single dose toxicity studies in rats and mice indicated a low acute toxic potential of nintedanib. In repeat 
dose toxicology studies in rats, adverse effects (e.g. thickening of epiphyseal plates, lesions of the 
incisors) were mostly related to the mechanism of action (i.e. VEGFR-2 inhibition) of nintedanib. These 
changes are known from other VEGFR-2 inhibitors and can be considered class effects (see section 5.3 of 
the SmPC). 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, 13 weeks treatment with BIBF 1120 by oral gavage at doses of 3 to 30 
mg/kg/day revealed treatment-related changes with a dosage-related trend: 30 mg/kg/day was not 
tolerated; 3 mg/kg/day was well tolerated clinically but resulted in histopathological changes of the 
thymus and bone marrow. Evidence of recovery was seen in animals which had received 30/20 
mg/kg/day after 4 weeks without treatment. NOAEL was not established in this study. BIBF 1120 
administered by oral gavage to Rhesus monkeys for 52 weeks at 60/45/30 mg/kg/day caused 
treatment-related liquid faeces, vomiting and bodyweight loss. The presence of potentially pathogenic 
bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract may have exacerbated the severity of liquid faeces and led to the 
premature death of two high dose animals. Reduced bodyweight gains were observed in animals receiving 
20 mg/kg/day which were considered adverse. Histopathologically, growth plate thickening in the 
femur/tibia and sternum, that was pharmacologically mediated, was seen at all dose levels. All 
treatment-related changes showed complete or partial reversibility. Changes seen at the 10 mg/kg/day 
dose level were either slight (i.e., not considered adverse), of unknown relationship to treatment, or were 
pharmacologically mediated, and as such this dosage level was considered to be the NOAEL. 
Diarrhoea and vomiting accompanied by reduced food consumption and loss of body weight were 
observed in toxicity studies in non-rodents. 
There was no evidence of liver enzyme increases in rats, dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys. Mild liver 
enzyme increases, which were not due to serious adverse effects such as diarrhoea were only observed in 
Rhesus monkeys.  
Toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic data confirm that the non-clinical species were exposed at or above 
expected therapeutic levels with regards to BIBF 1120 as well as the main metabolites BIBF 1202 and 
BIBF 1202 glucuronide. AUC is considered to be the most appropriate parameter since non-clinical toxicity 
mainly was seen upon repeated administration. In the toxicology studies, the observed NOAEL’s give rise 
to low exposure multitudes close to or below 1. This is acceptable in the context of the proposed indication 
of second line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. For the calculation of exposure 
multiples, the oral dosage of 250 mg bid as Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). However, for 
the current application 150 mg bid is specified as the MRHD in the SmPC. The dose-normalized geometric 
mean AUC(0-12h,ss) of BIBF 1120 in advanced cancer patients was 1.21 ng*h/mL (U11-1639). Thus a 
geometric mean daily exposure of twice the AUC(0-12h,ss), i.e. 363 ng*h/mL, can be assumed in 
humans.

The genotoxic potential of BIBF 1120 was assessed by three studies. An determining the potential of BIBF 
1120 to cause gene mutations in bacteria, a study assessing the frequency of gene mutations in 
mammalian cells (), and an in vivo study in rats assessing micronuclei in bone marrow cells, indicative of 
the potential of BIBF 1120 to cause chromosomal aberrations. BIBF 1120  
Genotoxicity studies indicated no mutagenic potential for nintedanib.  
No evidence of carcinogenic potential was identified following long term administration of 30 mg/kg/day 
and 10 mg/kg/day BIBF 1120 in mice and rats respectively. 
The submitted studies on reproductive toxicity are considered adequate. Based on preclinical 
investigations there is no evidence for impairment of male fertility (see section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
There are no human or animal data on potential effects of nintedanib on female fertility available. 
A study of male fertility and early embryonic development to implantation in rats did not reveal effects on 
the male reproductive tract and male fertility following oral treatment with BIBF 1120 at 3, 20 and 100 
mg/kg. However, slight effects on the early embryonic development, e.g. slightly decreased number of 
corpora lutea and slight increases in the mean numbers of total resorptions, early resorptions and 
resorption rate (all at 3 mg/kg). These observed differences between the treated groups and the control 
group were however within the ranges of means in the evaluation studies of Viertel et al. (2004 and 
2005). 
In rats, embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects were observed at exposure levels below human 
exposure, at the MRHD of 250 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). Effects on the development of the axial skeleton and 
on the development of the great arteries were also noted at subtherapeutic exposure levels. The studies 
performed to assess embryo-fetal development in rats, showed that BIBF 1120 at doses exceeding 20 
mg/kg resulted in complete resorption of the embryos. At lower doses skeletal variations (from 5 mg/kg) 
and dysmorphogenesis of blood vessels (10 mg/kg) were observed. The embryotoxicity observed is not 
surprising, as BIBF 1120 inhibits angiogenesis. The dose range finding study performed in rabbits showed 
embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenic effects from 75 mg/kg/day (Day 1 Cmax 498 ng/mL and AUC0-24 
2290 ng*h/mL).  
In rabbits, embryo-foetal lethality was observed at an exposure approximately 8 times higher than at the 
MHRD. Teratogenic effects on the aortic arches in combination with the heart and the urogenital system 
were noted at an exposure 4 times higher than at the MRHD and on the embryo-foetal development of the 
axial skeleton at an exposure 3 times higher than at the MRHD. 
The SmPC text sufficiently describes the observed embryo toxicity in sections 4.4, 4.6 and 5.3, and 
women and men of childbearing potential are advised to use adequate contraception. 
Nintedanib may cause foetal harm in humans (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential being 
treated with Ofev should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Ofev and 
to use adequate contraception during and at least 3 months after the last dose of Ofev. Since the effect 
of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier 
methods should be applied as a second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy. 
There is no information on the use of Ofev in pregnant women, but pre-clinical studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity of this active substance (see section 5.3). As nintedanib may cause foetal 
harm also in humans, it should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition requires 
treatment. Pregnancy testing should be conducted at least prior to treatment with Ofev. 
Female patients should be advised to notify their doctor or pharmacist if they become pregnant during 
therapy with Ofev. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Ofev, she should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the foetus. Termination of the treatment with Ofev should be considered.

There is no information on the excretion of nintedanib and its metabolites in human milk.  
Pre-clinical studies showed that small amounts of nintedanib and its metabolites (≤ 0.5 % of the 
administered dose) were secreted into milk of lactating rats. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Ofev.  
Nintedanib is presented as an oral formulation (oral gelatine capsules). The potential for local irritation 
can be assessed as part of other toxicity tests, and as the intended route of administration, t the local 
effects on the GI canal can be considered adequately addressed in the repeat dose studies. In the 5 local 
tolerance studies and the study on haemolytic potential of BIBF 1120 showed that BIBF 1120 was well 
tolerated following dermal application in aqueous solution, ocular application in the conjunctival sac and 
following intravenous administration (5% glucose) in rabbits. Whereas, on the other hand BIBF 1120 was 
causing local irritation following intra-arterial, intra muscular and paravenous administration in 5% 
glucose. 
Immunological investigations were performed on the 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats, in the 
13-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey and in the 52-week study in Rhesus monkeys. No 
consistent adverse effects on the immune system of the nonclinical species were observed. Similarly, no 
signs of immunosuppression were observed in these studies. 
The metabolite BIBF 1202 is negative in genotoxicity studies in vitro. No in vivo studies have been 
performed. However, toxicokinetic data indicate substantial exposure to BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 
glucuronide following dosing with BIBF 1120. Therefore, no further toxicity studies with BIBF 1202 or 
BIBF 1202 glucuronide is required. 
The impurity CDBB 213, an intermediate of chemical synthesis and potential degradant of BIBF 1120 was 
negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test, the Ames test, and in a 2-week rat toxicity study, where 
bone marrow micronucleus assay and the Comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in the liver, but 
showed clastogenic effects at very high concentrations in the 24h-incubation experiment in the mouse 
lymphoma assay. A NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day was established for CCBB 213 in the 14 day repeat dose 
toxicity study performed. 
The OECD Guideline 432 specifies that; a PIF value > 5, and a MPE value >0.15 predicts phototoxicity. 
Consequently, the 3T3 NRU test indicates that nintedanib is phototoxic. However, as no phototoxic 
potential has been seen in existing human data, the positive in vitro finding is considered to be of low 
clinical relevance. 
Nintedanib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. However, as a precautionary measure the 
Applicant has included the statement: “Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household 
waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help 
protect the environment” in the PL.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Nintedanib reached maximum plasma concentrations approximately 2 - 4 hours after oral administration 
as soft gelatin capsule under fed conditions (range 0.5 - 8 hours).  
Results of the absolute bioavailability analysis in healthy volunteers for AUC0-∞ and AUC0-tz are presented 
below:

Absorption and bioavailability are decreased by transporter effects and substantial first-pass metabolism. 
Dose proportionality was shown by increase of nintedanib exposure (dose range 50 - 450 mg once daily 
and 150 - 300 mg twice daily). Steady state plasma concentrations were achieved within one week of 
dosing at the latest. 
The effect of food on exposure to nintedanib was investigated in study 1199.17. In a single-dose open 
study of 16 male volunteers, the effect of a high fat meal (as administered 30 minutes before drug 
administration) on a single 150mg of nintedanib was investigated (see Table 14). 
Table 14: Geometric mean (and gCV%) pharmacokinetic parameters of BIBF 1120 BS after single oral 
administration of 150 mg nintedanib capsule under fasted and fed conditions to healthy male volunteers 
After food intake, nintedanib exposure increased by approximately 20 % compared to administration 
under fasted conditions (CI: 95.3 - 152.5 %) and absorption was delayed (median t max fasted: 2.00 
hours; fed: 3.98 h) (see SmPC section 5.2).

Distribution 
Nintedanib follows at least bi-phasic disposition kinetics. After intravenous infusion, a high volume of 
distribution during the terminal phase (Vz: 1050 L, 45.0 % gCV) was observed. 
The in vitro protein binding of nintedanib in human plasma was high, with a bound fraction of 97.8 %. 
Serum albumin is considered to be the major binding protein. Nintedanib is preferentially distributed in 
plasma with a blood to plasma ratio of 0.869 (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Elimination 
The prevalent metabolic reaction for nintedanib is hydrolytic cleavage by esterases resulting in the free 
acid moiety BIBF 1202. BIBF 1202 is subsequently glucuronidated by UGT enzymes, namely UGT 1A1, 
UGT 1A7, UGT 1A8, and UGT 1A10 to BIBF 1202 glucuronide.  
Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways with CYP 3A4 being 
the predominant enzyme involved. The major CYP-dependent metabolite could not be detected in plasma 
in the human ADME study. In vitro, CYP-dependent metabolism accounted for about 5 % compared to 
about 25 % ester cleavage. In in vitro receptor binding assays the metabolite BIBF 1202 has a very 
similar affinity for the VEGFR-3 receptor to that of the parent drug (IC50 14.4 nM versus 13 nM). In 
addition, despite the assertion that BIBF 1202 has low membrane permeability, the EC50 of BIBF 1202 in 
an assay of VEGF-stimulated cellular proliferation  (unspecified cell type) was 80 nM which is comparable 
to peak steady state levels of BIBF 1202 in humans treated with oral nintedanib at 150 mg b.i.d. 
In preclinical in vivo experiments, BIBF 1202 did not show efficacy despite its activity at target receptors 
of the substance. 
Total plasma clearance after intravenous infusion was high (CL: 1390 mL/min, 28.8 % gCV). Urinary 
excretion of the unchanged active substance within 48 h was about 0.05 % of the dose (31.5 % gCV) after 
oral and about 1.4 % of dose (24.2 % gCV) after intravenous administration; the renal clearance was 20 
mL/min (32.6 % gCV). The major route of elimination of drug related radioactivity after oral 
administration of [14C] nintedanib was via faecal/biliary excretion (93.4 % of dose, 2.61 % gCV). 
The contribution of renal excretion to the total clearance was low (0.649 % of dose, 26.3 % gCV). 
The overall recovery was considered complete (above 90 %) within 4 days after dosing. The terminal 
half-life of nintedanib was between 10 and 15 h (gCV % approximately 50 %) (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportional behaviour of Cmax and AUC was concluded based on several studies in cancer patients 
investigating doses from 50 to 450 mg qd (1199.1 and 1199.3) and from 150 to 300 mg bid in studies that 
included patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (1199.1, 1199.2, 1199.19, 1199.30). In the 
meta-analyses of PK studies in patients with cancer and IPF there was no evidence of drift in dose 
proportionality for nintedanib and no difference in the fraction metabolised to BIBF 1202 and BIBF 1202 
glucuronide over the investigated dose range. Nintedanib showed dose proportionality for all investigated 
PK parameters. CL/F of nintedanib did not change after multiple dosing compared to single 
administration. The PK of nintedanib can therefore be considered linear with respect to time (i.e. 
single-dose data can be extrapolated to multiple-dose data). Accumulation upon multiple administrations 
was 1.04-fold for Cmax and 1.38-fold for AUCτ. Nintedanib trough concentrations remained stable for 
more than one year (see SmPC section 5.2).

Special populations 
The pharmacokinetic properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and 
patients of the target population. Exposure to nintedanib was not influenced by gender (body weight 
corrected), mild and moderate renal impairment (estimated by creatinine clearance), , alcohol 
consumption, and P-gp genotype. 
Population PK analyses indicated moderate effects on exposure to nintedanib depending on the following 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Based on the high inter-individual variability of exposure observed in the 
clinical trials these effects are not considered clinically relevant.  
Hepatic impairment 
Nintedanib is predominantly eliminated via biliary/faecal excretion (> 90 %, see elimination). The safety, 
efficacy,  and  pharmacokinetics  of  nintedanib  have  not  been  investigated  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment  classified  as  Child  Pugh  B  and  C  (moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  respectively). 
Three  studies  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  are  currently  ongoing  (1199.37,  1199.39  and 
1199.120). The applicant is asked to complete the principal studies - 1199.37 and 1199.39 – and to 
commit to reporting of results by Q1 2015. Therefore, treatment of patients with moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment with nintedanib is not recommended.  
Hepatic impairment and its potential effects on the PK of nintedanib were explored in several analyses 
based on transaminase and bilirubin levels. These included the Phase II/III PopPK, studies 1199.3 and 
1199.19, and the two exploratory PopPK analyses. Pharmacokinetic data for nintedanib was collected in 
patients with abnormalities in hepatic parameters defined by elevations in AST, ALT and bilirubin levels. 
A trend to elevated exposure was observed in patients with AST- and ALT-values (up to 10 x ULN) and 
elevated bilirubin levels (up to 1.5 x ULN) at baseline as compared to patients with normal AST, ALT and 
bilirubin levels. In patients with ALT or AST > 10 x ULN and bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN, data were too limited 
to draw conclusions (see SmPC section 5.2).  
Renal impairment 
No dedicated study in renally impaired patients has been performed. The contribution of renal excretion 
after oral administration of nintedanib both as unchanged drug (about 0.05% of dose) and as drug related 
radioactivity  was  minor  (about  0.6%  of  dose).  As  a  consequence,  adjustment  of  the  starting  dose  in 
patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is not required. 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been studied in patients with severe 
renal impairment (<30 ml/min creatinine clearance). Treatment of patients with severe renal impairment 
is not recommended.  
Gender, ethnicity, body weight, age 
No  formal  studies  were  conducted  to  examine  gender,  ethnicity,  weight  or  age.  Although  females 
appeared to have higher nintedanib exposure compared to males, once body weight was accounted for, 
gender was found to not significantly affect the PK of nintedanib. 
In the Phase II/III PopPK analysis age, race and body weight were found to affect the PK of nintedanib. 
Simulations  revealed  that  none  of  the  individual  covariate  effects  alone  identified  in  the  Phase  II/III 
PopPK analysis caused a change in exposure that exceeded the observed variability range of nintedanib. 
Relevant increases in simulated exposure were only found when considering more than one covariate.  
Exposure to nintedanib increased linearly with age. AUCô,ss decreased by 16 % for a 45-year old patient 
(5th percentile) and increased by 13 % for a 76-year old patient (95th percentile) relative to a patient 
with the median age of 62 years. The age range covered by the analysis was 29 to 85 years representing 
approximately 5 % of the population were older than 75 years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 52/85  
  
  
 
 
An inverse correlation between body weight and exposure to nintedanib was observed. AUCô,ss increased 
by 25 % for a 50 kg patient (5th percentile) and decreased by 19 % for a 100 kg  patient (95th percentile) 
relative to a patient with the median weight of 71.5 kg. 
The geometric mean exposure to nintedanib was 33 % higher in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indian patients 
while it was 22 % lower in Koreans compared to Caucasians (body weight corrected). However, based on 
the high inter-individual variability of exposure these effects are not considered clinically relevant. Data 
from black individuals was very limited but in the same range as for Caucasians. Safety data for Black and 
African American patients are limited (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
No studies in paediatric populations investigating the PK of nintedanib have been performed. IPF has not 
been  reported  in  children.  The  EMA  granted  a  product-specific  waiver  for  paediatric  development  of 
nintedanib  in  IPF  on  29th  October  2010  (EMA/644826/2010).  Studies  in  children  are  therefore  not 
required.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Two well-designed conducted and reported DDI studies in healthy volunteers have been performed to 
assess the clinical relevance of potent P-GP inhibition and induction on the PK of nintedanib.  
Co-administration with the potent P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61-fold 
based on AUC and 1.83-fold based on Cmax in a dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug 
interaction study with the potent P-gp inducer rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3 % 
based  on  AUC  and  to  60.3  %  based  on  Cmax  upon  co-administration  with  rifampicin  compared  to 
administration  of  nintedanib  alone.  If  co-administered  with  nintedanib,  potent  P  gp  inhibitors  (e.g. 
ketoconazole or erythromycin) may increase exposure to nintedanib. In such cases, patients should be 
monitored  closely  for  tolerability  of  nintedanib.  Management  of  side  effects  may  require  interruption, 
dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib. 
Potent  P-gp  inducers  (e.g. rifampicin,  carbamazepine,  phenytoin,  and  St.  John’s  Wort)  may  decrease 
exposure to nintedanib. Co-administration with Ofev should be carefully considered. 
Nintedanib was administered in combination with pirfenidone to Japanese patients with IPF in a parallel 
group design study (1199.31). Exposure to nintedanib decreased to 68.3% based on AUC and to 59.2% 
based  on  Cmax  n  the  group  where  pirfenidone  was  co-administered  (inter-individual  comparison). 
Nintedanib  did  not  have  a  relevant  effect  on  the  PK  of  pirfenidone  (intra-individual  comparison).  The 
applicant  will  perform  a  drug  to  drug  interaction  study  with  pirfenidone  and  the  final  report  will  be 
submitted end of 2016.  
The potential for interactions of nintedanib with hormonal contraceptives was not explored (see SmPC 
section 4.5). 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Inhibition  of  glucuronidation  reactions  by  nintedanib  and  BIBF  1202  was  investigated  in  vitro  using 
human  liver  microsomes  or  expressed  UGT  enzymes  [U06-1744].  The  IC50  for  UGT  1A1  dependent 
ß-estradiol metabolism was 24.5 µM for nintedanib and >200 µM for BIBF 1202. UGT 2B7 dependent 
ß-estradiol metabolism was inhibited by nintedanib with an IC50 of 77.6 µM and an IC50 >200 µM for 
BIBF 1202. 
Results of transporter inhibition experiments are reported in the table below.

The in vitro evaluation of the drug drug interaction (DDI) potential for nintedanib and its metabolites, the 
free acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide does not suggest a clinically 
relevant potential for nintedanib mediated DDI related to, P450 enzymes 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 4A11. Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP 
pathways. The likelihood of drug-drug interactions with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore 
considered to be low (see SmPC section 4.5). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Nintedanib  is  a  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  blocking  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptors 
(VEGFR 1-3),  platelet-derived  growth  factor  receptors  (PDGFR á and ß)  and  fibroblast  growth  factor 
receptors (FGFR 1-3) kinase activity. Nintedanib binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signaling which is crucial for the migration, 
proliferation and transformation of lung fibroblasts. In addition Fms-like tyrosine-protein kinase (Flt)-3, 
Lymphocyte-specific tyrosine-protein kinase (Lck) and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase src (Src) 
are inhibited. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Transforming Growth Factor ß1, -ß2 and -ß3 (TGFß1, ß2 and ß3) and well as the circulating proteins Krebs 
von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and IL-8 may be markers for the course of IPF and were therefore evaluated in 
Study 1199.30 – the results are shown tabulated below.

nintedanib versus sunitinib in previously untreated patients with renal cell cancer where observation 
regarding QT-prolongation was the main purpose of the interim report (enrolled patients =113; analysed 
for primary QTc endpoint= 64). 
In this study single oral doses of 200 mg nintedanib as well as multiple oral doses of 200 mg nintedanib 
administered twice daily for 15 days did not prolong the QTcF interval. The largest meantime-matched 
increase of QTcF at steady state was 3.1 ms (two-sided 90% CI: -0.2, 6.4). 
In exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK)-adverse event analyses, higher exposure to nintedanib tended to be 
associated with liver enzyme elevations, but not with gastrointestinal adverse events. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and 
patients of the target population. The PK studies are orientated towards oncology uses rather than IPF in 
the type of study and numbers studied but the IPF database is adequate. 
Under fed conditions the extent of absorption of nintedanib was increased around 20%. As the decrease 
in systemic exposure under fasted conditions is small, it can be assumed that in case nintedanib is taken 
without food on single occasions the impact on the overall steady state exposure of nintedanib will be 
limited. Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that capsules of nintedanib must be taken orally, with food, 
swallowed whole with water, and must not be chewed or crushed. 
Three different types of capsules were administered to healthy male volunteers. Bioequivalence has only 
been established between two capsule formulations (slow and fast dissolution). However, no clinical 
bioequivalence has been established between these two capsule formulations and the final formulation 
(intended commercial formulation). Although clinical bioequivalence between the final formulation and 
the two capsules (slow and fast) has not been established in an appropriate bioequivalence study, the 
applicant has described and justified in a sufficient way the lack of bioequivalence studies between the 
two capsule formulations (slow and fast dissolving) and the final formulation (intended commercial 
formulation). 
Less than 1 % of a single dose of nintedanib is excreted via the kidney (see section 5.2). Adjustment of 
the starting dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is not required (see SmPC sections 
4.2 and 5.2).  
Nintedanib has not been investigated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.  Hepatic 
impairment and its potential effects on the PK of nintedanib were explored in several analyses based on 
transaminase and bilirubin levels. These included the Phase II/III PopPK, studies 1199.3 and 1199.19, 
and the two exploratory PopPK analyses. All investigations indicated higher exposure to nintedanib in 
patients with elevated laboratory values. The applicant will submit the final data from the on-going trials 
investigating hepatic impairment (1199.37 by Q1 2015, 1199.39 by Q1 2015 and 1199.120 by Q1 2016) 
and discuss the possible influence of hepatic impairment on the PK of nintedanib when available (see 
RMP). 
Nintedanib is predominantly eliminated via biliary/faecal excretion (> 90 %). No adjustment of the 
starting dose is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment based on clinical data (Child Pugh A). 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib have not been investigated in patients with 
hepatic impairment classified as Child Pugh B and C. Therefore, treatment of patients with moderate 
(Child Pugh B) and severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment with Ofev is not recommended (see SmPC 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).

No formal studies were conducted to examine gender, ethnicity, weight or age. In the Phase II/III PopPK 
analysis, age, race and body weight were found to affect the PK of nintedanib. Simulations revealed that 
none of the individual covariate effects alone identified in the Phase II/III PopPK analysis caused a change 
in exposure that exceeded the observed variability range of nintedanib. No a priori dose adjustments are 
required based on intrinsic factors like age, race and body weight as the variability of exposure observed 
is not considered clinically relevant. 
The Applicant has discussed dose adjustment in individuals with more than one covariate present. Data 
showed a significant proportion of patients with more than one covariate present would still have 
nintedanib plasma concentrations in the range observed in patients with no covariate present. The 
recommended posology, starting with a dose of 150 mg bid and then adapting according to the proposed 
dose reduction schemes as outlined in the SmPC seems reasonable. . 
Since the effect of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been investigated, 
barrier methods should be applied as a second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy. 
Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp however it was shown not to be a substrate or inhibitor of OATP-1B1, 
OATP-1B3, OATP-2B1, OCT-2, or MRP-2 in vitro. Nintedanib was also not a substrate of BCRP. Only a 
weak inhibitory potential on OCT-1, BCRP, and P-gp was observed in vitro which is considered to be of low 
clinical relevance. The same applies for nintedanib being a substrate of OCT-1. 
The applicant has provided an in-depth discussion on the possible inhibition of intestinal inhibition of 
CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP. Based on in vitro data, nintedanib is considered a weak inhibitor of BCRP and 
P-gp. No in vitro Ki value against P-gp (max tested concentration 30 μmol/L) was established The crude 
estimate of gut concentration (dose/250 ml) is likely a large overestimation as 1) the solubility of 
nintedanib decreases rapidly with increasing pH and the solubility of nintedanib in different buffer 
solutions at pH values of ≥ 6 is 0.001 mg/ml (approx. 1.85 µM) and 2) as nintedanib is intended to be 
administered with food.  
Further argumentation has also been provided in order to address the inductive effect of nintedanib on 
oral contraceptives. According to the EMA guideline on drug interactions “a potential human teratogen 
needs to be studied in vivo for effects on contraceptive steroids if the drug is intended for use in fertile 
women, regardless of the in vitro induction study results.” Therefore, the lack of a drug-drug interaction 
study investigating the inductive effect of nintedanib on oral contraceptives is acceptable given the 
current indication and patient population of nintedanib. However, if future approval for additional 
indications, where nintedanib is to be used in women of childbearing potential, is sought, it is important 
that a drug-drug interaction study investigating the inductive effect of nintedanib on oral contraceptives 
is performed. In the mean-time, a recommendation to use a barrier method as a second form of 
contraception has been included in the SmPC. 
A clinically relevant drug-drug-interaction based on inhibition of UGT after oral administration of 
nintedanib is considered less likely as all IC50 values are substantially higher than the therapeutic plasma 
concentrations.  
Drug-drug interactions between nintedanib and CYP substrates, CYP inhibitors, or CYP inducers are not 
expected, since nintedanib, BIBF 1202, and BIBF 1202 glucuronide did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes 
in preclinical studies nor was nintedanib metabolized by CYP enzymes to a relevant extent (see SmPC 
section 5.2). 
  The rapporteur considers the issue of co-treatment with pirfenidone to be primarily one of clinical safety 
and efficacy rather than pharmacokinetic, a drug-to-drug interaction study with pirfenidone is going to be 
performed and the final report will be submitted by the end of 2016.

The correlation between exposure to nintedanib with elevations of liver enzymes or bilirubin can be 
tackled by reducing the exposure with down-titration of the nintedanib dose. 
QT-prolongation is a recognised class effect of previously authorised TKIs (Shah et al., 2013), and the 
omission of a thorough QT study to investigate possible QT-prolongation of nintedanib has been justified. 
Additional wording has been included in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1 in order to reflect the possible 
relation between TKIs and QT-prolongation.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology documentation submitted in support of the application for marketing 
authorisation of nintedanib is considered satisfactory. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to clinical pharmacology: 
(see RMP) 
-  Data on nintedanib treatment in patients with hepatic impairment from trials 1199.37 and 
1199.39 (final report due Q1 2015) and trial 1199.120 in Japanese patients (final report due Q1 
2016). 
-  A drug-to drug interaction study with pirfenidone will be performed and the final report is 
expected by end of 2016. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Two pivotal Phase III trials (1199.32 and 1199.34) and a supportive dose-finding Phase II trial 
(1199.30) were submitted in support of clinical efficacy of nintedanib in IPF. Based on the Phase II safety 
and dose-finding trial 1199.30, a nintedanib dose of 150 mg bid was selected for the confirmatory  trials 
(1199.32 and 1199.34).  In the event of adverse effects, the dose could be reduced to 100 mg bid.  
Trials 1199.32 and 1199.34  provided a placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy of nintedanib in 
IPF over a 52 week treatment duration. Additional supportive data for persistence of efficacy beyond this 
time point is provided by the optional, blinded active extension period for trial 1199.30. Trials 1199.32 
and 1199.34 were also submitted to a pre-specified pooled analysis for the purpose of investigating 
survival.  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Determination of maximum tolerated dose in oncology trials: 
The maximum tolerated dose for oral nintedanib as monotherapy had previously been established from 
Phase I oncology trials and was determined to be 250 mg b.i.d. in Caucasians and 200 mg b.i.d. in 
Japanese patients. 
Based on the phase I dose escalation trials with nintedanib monotherapy in patients with solid tumours, 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined as 250 mg b.i.d. in Caucasians and 200 mg b.i.d. in 
Japanese patients. The predominant adverse events were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain 
and fatigue of mostly low to moderate intensity. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were mainly liver enzyme 
elevations which showed a marked dose-dependency. Liver enzyme elevations were reversible upon

treatment discontinuation. Most cases of liver enzyme elevations occurred at doses of 250 mg b.i.d. and 
above, while the incidence was low at doses ≤200 mg b.i.d.  
Phase II dose-finding study in IPF (1199.30) 
A Phase II dose-finding study (1199.30) was conducted in patients with IPF to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of 4 nintedanib doses (50 mg q.d., 50 mg b.i.d., 100 mg b.i.d. and 150 mg b.i.d.) by oral 
administration versus placebo over a 52 week treatment period with an optional active treatment 
extension. The study was of a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design. Higher 
dosage arms were progressively included following Data Monitoring Committee review and approval. The 
main inclusion criteria were the same as for the subsequent Phase III pivotal studies. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was annual rate of decline in FVC (over 52 weeks). Secondary efficacy endpoints included acute 
IPF exacerbations and quality of life as measured by the SGRQ.   
The difference from placebo in the annual rate of decline in FVC was 0.016 L for 50 mg q.d. (95% CI 
-0.086,0.118), -0.020 L for 50 mg b.i.d. (95% CI -0.119, 0.080), 0.028 L for 100 mg b.i.d. (95% CI 
-0.071, 0.128) and 0.131 L for 150 mg b.i.d. (95% CI 0.027, 0.235).  
A closed testing procedure was pre-specified for the primary analysis of the endpoint in order to prevent 
inflation of  the type 1 error. The closed testing assigned equal weight to each dose group and every 
intersection between all dose groups and placebo was tested. A dose was determined to be significantly 
different from placebo (at the 5% level) only if p-values for all tests of all the combinations including this 
dose against placebo were less than 0.05.  
The p-value for the 150 mg b.i.d. dose was 0.0639 using the closed testing procedure and therefore did 
not reach statistical significance. However, when a less stringent hierarchical testing procedure was used, 
the difference between nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. and placebo reached nominal statistical significance (p = 
0.0136). The hierarchical testing procedure was used as a pre-specified sensitivity analysis which tested 
for significance at the highest dose, proceeding to the dose below only if significance was shown.  
The efficacy of nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. in IPF was further supported by a reduced incidence of acute IPF 
exacerbation compared to placebo (2.3% in the nintedanib group versus 13.8% in the placebo group), 
hazard ratio (HR) 0.158 (p=0.0161) in favour of nintedanib. Moreover, nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. was 
associated with a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in the change from baseline 
in SGRQ total score at 52 weeks (6.12 points over placebo, p=0.0071).  
There was also a trend to enhanced survival with nintedanib: the incidence of deaths from any cause was 
numerically lower in the nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. group (8.1%) than in the placebo group (10.3%), HR at 
52 weeks of 0.732 (95% CI 0.271, 1.977) in favour of nintedanib although this was not statistically 
significant. Among respiratory-related deaths (numbers derived by blinded adjudication by an external 
committee) there was also a  trend to improved survival over  the 52 week duration: 9.2% in the placebo 
group versus 2.3% in the nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. group, HR 0.225 (95% CI 0.048, 1.065).   
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study  1199.32  was a 52 week, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety 
and efficacy of oral nintedanib, 150 mg twice daily, on annual forced vital capacity decline, in patients with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
Methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 58/85  
  
  
 
 
 
The principal objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily versus 
placebo in patients with IPF over 52 weeks. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (expressed in mL over 52 weeks). 
The key secondary endpoints were: 
Change from baseline in SGRQ total score at 52 weeks (expressed in points) 
Time  to  first  acute  IPF  exacerbation  (days)  over  52  weeks  an  acute  exacerbation  was  defined  as; 
unexplained worsening or development of dyspnoea within 30 days, new diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on 
chest X-ray, and/or new HRCT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion (new 
ground-glass opacities) since the last visit. Exclusion of alternative causes as per routine clinical practice.  
Inclusion criteria 
Eligible patients were at least 40 years old, with IPF diagnosed (according to ATS/ERS criteria less than 5 
years prior to Visit 2 and  HRCT within 52 weeks of Visit 1 and biopsy (the latter if needed to fulfil ATS/ERS 
criteria)  centrally  reviewed  and  consistent  with  diagnosis.  They  had  FVC  ≥  50 %  of  predicted  normal 
value;  Males:  FVC  predicted  (L)  =  5.76  x  height  (meters)-  0.026  x  age  (years)  -4.34  Females:  FVC 
predicted (L) = 4.43 x height (meters)- 0.026 x age (years) -2.89. For both genders single breath DLCO 
30 - 79% of predicted. 
Exclusion criteria 
The  exclusion  criteria  included  a  series  of  medical  conditions  that  might  have  interfered  with  the 
performance  of  the  study.  The  criteria  also  covered  some  drugs  that  might  have  interfered  with  the 
activity of the study medication.  Continuous oxygen supplementation at randomisation (defined as ≥ 15 
hours supplemental oxygen per day, active infection at screening or randomisation, significant laboratory 
test abnormality, Pregnant women or women who were breast feeding or of child bearing potential not 
using a highly effective method of birth control for at least one month prior to enrolment. 
Statistical analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint (annual rate of decline in FVC) was analysed using a random coefficient 
regression model (random slopes and intercepts) including gender, age, and height as covariates.  
The key secondary endpoint, the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at 52 weeks was analysed 
using  a  Mixed  Effects  Model  for  Repeated  Measures  (MMRM),  with  baseline  SGRQ  total  score  as  a 
covariate.  
The key secondary endpoint, time to first acute exacerbation over 52 weeks was analysed using the log 
rank test and a Cox model, including gender, age and height as covariates, to determine the hazard ratio.  
The  proportion  of  FVC  responders  and  SGRQ  responders  was  analysed  using  a  logistic  regression.  All 
other  continuous  endpoints  were  analysed  using  MMRM  and  all  other  time  to  event  endpoints  were 
analysed using a log rank test and Cox model. Superiority of nintedanib 150 mg bid over placebo was 
tested using a hierarchical procedure for the primary and two key secondary endpoints in order to deal 
with multiplicity.
The consecutive steps of the hierarchy were only considered if the previous step was 
significant at the 1-sided 2.5% level (the order of testing differed in the US and the EU). 
The efficacy and safety analyses were based on the treated set (TS). The TS consisted of patients who 
were dispensed study medication and were documented to have taken at least one dose of investigational 
treatment.

The  sample  size  was  calculated  to  provide  at  least  90%  power  to  detect  a  difference  between  the 
treatment groups in the annual rate of FVC decline of 100 mL. Based on the Phase II data, the common 
standard deviation was assumed to be 300 mL. Assuming 2% of patients would be non evaluable, the 
sample size was calculated as 194 patients in the placebo group and 291 patients in the nintedanib 150 
mg bid group if using a 2 group t-test at a 1-sided 2.5% level. 
Results 
Seven hundred and eighteen patients were screened of whom 515 were randomised; 157 were screening 
failures (patients who did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria) and 46 were not randomised for other 
reasons, 206 were randomised to placebo and 309 to nintedanib 150 bd. In the placebo arm 174 patients 
(85.3%) completed the study and 260 (84.1%) completed the study in the nintedanib arm.  
Demographics 
The majority of patients were male (80.7%). The largest proportion of patients was Caucasian (64.9%), 
followed  by  Asian  patients  (20.9%).  The  mean  and  median  values  for  age  were  similar  between  the 
treatment  groups  (total  mean:  66.9  years;  median:  68.0  years).  The  distribution  of  patients  by  age 
category showed some imbalances, with a higher proportion of younger (<65 years) and elderly patients 
(≥70 years) and a lower proportion of patients between 65 to <75 years in the nintedanib treatment 
group than in the placebo group. Most patients were ex-smokers (70.2% nintedanib; 70.6% placebo) or 
current smokers (6.8% nintedanib; 4.4% placebo), while approximately one quarter of patients never 
smoked. A summary of key demographic characteristics is presented in Table 4.  
Time  since  IPF  diagnosis  was  comparable  across  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  patients  were 
diagnosed with IPF within 3 years prior to randomisation, with a mean time from diagnosis of 1.63 years. 
The majority of patients had an HRCT assessment which was 'consistent with UIP' (97.4% nintedanib; 
97.1%  placebo).  All  patients  who  had  an  HRCT  assessment  rated  as  ‘possible  UIP’  had  a  lung  biopsy 
available for central review which confirmed the diagnosis  Overall, 38.2% of patients
had centrilobular 
emphysema, based on qualitative assessment of HRCT. 
Selected efficacy outcomes are shown in Table 5, and the time course  of FVC decline is in Figure 4. In the 
placebo arm 10 (4.9%) patients died  due to a respiratory cause over 52 weeks and in the nintedanib arm 
the equivalent figure was also 10 (3.2%)  (p = 0.35).  The hazard ratio for time to death due to respiratory 
cause over 52 weeks was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.25, 1.47; p = 0.3515). The proportion of patients who died or 
received a lung transplant or qualified for a lung transplant over 52 weeks was numerically lower in the 
nintedanib group (14.9%) than in the placebo group (18.1%). The hazard ratio for the time to death or 
lung  transplant  or  qualifying  for  lung  transplant  over  52  weeks  was  0.81  (95%  CI  0.52,  1.25;  p  = 
0.3558). 
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline to Week 52 in DLCO (mmol/min/kPa) was -0.380 for 
nintedanib and -0.365 for placebo. No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups 
(-0.015 [95% CI: -0.191, 0.161; p = 0.8650]).

Figure 4 shows the time-course of FVC decline over 52 weeks by 
treatment arm.
Dose reductions (temporary or permanent) were reported for 26.5% of patients in the nintedanib group 
and 4.9% of patients in the placebo group. The mean duration of exposure to the reduced dose was 4.28 
months for the nintedanib group and 3.65 months for the placebo group. The majority of dose reductions 
were  due  to  drug-related AEs:  95.6%  of  dose  reductions  in  the  nintedanib  group  and  90.0%  of  dose 
reductions in the placebo group. Most patients who had at least 1 dose reduction in the nintedanib group 
(60/82  patients)  and  placebo  group  (6/10)  had  their  first  dose  reduction  within  the  first  6  months  of 
treatment. 
The proportion of patients with AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation was higher in the 
nintedanib group (21.0%) compared with the placebo group (10.8%). 
Study  1199.34 was a 52 week, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety 
and efficacy of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily, on annual forced vital capacity decline, in patients with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
Methods 
The primary objective was to assess the reduction in lung function decline, as measured by a change in 
the annual rate of decline in FVC. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (expressed in mL over 52 weeks). 
The key secondary endpoints were:

Eligible patients were at least 40 years old, with IPF diagnosed (according to ATS/ERS criteria less than 5 
years prior to Visit 2 and  HRCT within 52 weeks of Visit 1 and biopsy (the latter if needed to fulfil ATS/ERS 
criteria)  centrally  reviewed  and  consistent  with  diagnosis.  They  had  FVC  ≥  50 %  of  predicted  normal

30 - 79% of predicted. 
Exclusion criteria 
The  exclusion  criteria  included  a  series  of  medical  conditions  that  might  have  interfered  with  the 
performance  of  the  study.  The  criteria  also  covered  some  drugs  that  might  have  interfered  with  the

The key secondary endpoint, time to first acute exacerbation over 52 weeks was analysed using the log 
rank test and a Cox model, including gender, age and height as covariates, to determine the hazard ratio.  
The  proportion  of  FVC  responders  and  SGRQ  responders  was  analysed  using  a  logistic  regression.  All 
other  continuous  endpoints  were  analysed  using  MMRM  and  all  other  time  to  event  endpoints  were 
analysed using a log rank test and Cox model. Superiority of nintedanib 150 mg bid over placebo was 
tested using a hierarchical procedure for the primary and two key secondary endpoints in order to deal 
with multiplicity.
The consecutive steps of the hierarchy were only considered if the previous step was 
significant at the 1-sided 2.5% level (the order of testing differed in the US and the EU). 
The efficacy and safety analyses were based on the treated set (TS). The TS consisted of patients who

mg bid group if using a 2 group t-test at a 1-sided 2.5% level. 
Results 
Seven  hundred  and  ninety-four  patients  were  screened  of  whom  551  were  randomised;  190  were 
screening failures (patients who did not meet in/exclusion criteria) and 53 were not randomised for other 
reasons; three patients were not treated. Of those treated 219 were in the placebo arm and 329 in the 
nintedanib  150  bd  arm.  In  the  placebo  arm  179  (81.7%)  completed  the  study  and  272  (82.7%) 
completed the study in the nintedanib arm.

The majority of patients were male (77.9%). The largest proportion of patients was Caucasian (50.2%), 
followed by Asian (39.2%). The mean and median values for age were similar between the treatment 
groups  (total  mean:  66.6  years;  median:  67.0  years).  The  distribution  of  patients  by  age  categories 
showed  some  imbalances,  with  a  higher  proportion  of  younger  patients  (<65  years)  and  a  lower 
proportion of patients between 65 to <75 years in the nintedanib treatment group compared with the 
placebo group. Most patients were ex-smokers (66.3% nintedanib; 63.5% placebo) or current smokers 
(2.4% nintedanib; 4.1% placebo), approximately one third of patients had never smoked.  
Time since IPF diagnosis was comparable across both treatment groups. The majority of patients were 
diagnosed with IPF within 3 years prior to randomisation, with a mean time from diagnosis of 1.60 years. 
The majority of patients had an HRCT assessment which was ‘consistent with UIP’ (97.6% nintedanib; 
98.2% placebo) as defined by the protocol. All patients who had an HRCT assessment rated as ‘possible 
UIP’  had  a  lung  biopsy  available  for  central  review  which  confirmed  the  diagnosis.  Overall,  40.9%  of 
patients  had  centrilobular  emphysema,  based  on  qualitative  assessment  of  HRCT.    Baseline 
characteristics by treatment arm are shown in Table 6.

The  proportion  of  patients  with  at  least  one  acute  IPF  exacerbation  over  52  weeks,  based  on  all 
investigator-reported  adverse  events,  was  lower  in  the  nintedanib  group  (3.6%)  than  in  the  placebo 
group (9.6%). The time to event analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.77) and was 
statistically  significant  with  p  =  0.0050,  indicating  a  reduced  risk  of  experiencing  a  first  acute  IPF 
exacerbation in patients in the nintedanib group compared with patients in the placebo group. 
Twenty (9.1%) placebo treated patients died over the 52 weeks of the study and 22 (6.7%) nintedanib 
patients died (p = 0.300). Deaths from a respiratory cause were 11 (5.0%) and 14 (4.3%) in the placebo 
and nintedanib groups  respectively (p = 0.67) 
The adjusted mean absolute change from baseline to Week 52 in DLCO (mmol/min/kPa) was -0.286 for 
nintedanib and -0.400 for placebo. The difference between nintedanib and placebo was 0.113 (95% CI: 
-0.084, 0.310; p = 0.2600),

Figure 5 shows the time-course of FVC decline over 52 weeks by 
treatment arm.
Overall, 29.2% of patients in the nintedanib group had a dose reduction from 150 mg bid to 100 mg bid. 
These patients received the lower nintedanib 100 mg bid dose for a mean duration of 4.47 months. In the 
placebo group, 2.7% of patients had dose reductions to 100 mg bid, they received the lower placebo 100 
mg bid dose for a mean duration of 2.42 months. 
Studies  1199.32  and  1199.34  show  a  clear  and  consistent  benefit  in  reducing  the  decline  of  FVC  by 
approximately  125  mL/year  and  94  mL/year  respectively.  The  time  course  for  the  decline  in  FVC  is 
strikingly similar in both studies (Figures 4 and 5) and the divergent slopes of the decline curves suggests 
a real benefit over time rather than a once-off benefit which is then maintained over time (in which case 
the slopes would be parallel). Slightly surprisingly in view of the spirometric effect there was no benefit in 
terms of gas exchange (DLco) in either study.

Divergences between the studies are a lack of benefit on SGRQ and frequency of IPF exacerbations in 
Study 1199.32 both of which have a statistically significant advantage over placebo in Study 1199.34, 
which study may represent reality is impossible to say. However, statistically significant benefits for both 
variables were present in the 150 mg bid treatment arm compared to placebo in the dose ranging study.

The robustness of the effect of nintedanib in reducing the annual rate of decline in FVC was confirmed in 
all pre-specified sensitivity analyses. In patients with missing data, the primary analysis assumes that the 
decline in FVC after the last observed value would be similar to the decline in other patients in the same 
treatment group, which is unlikely to be true if a subject had stopped taking treatment. In a sensitivity 
analysis which allowed for the loss of efficacy expected at treatment withdrawal, by assuming  assumed 
that in patients with missing data at week 52 the FVC decline after the last observed value would be the 
same as in all placebo patients, the adjusted difference in the annual rate of decline between nintedanib 
and placebo was 113.9 mL/year (95% CI 69.2, 158.5) in INPULSIS-1 and 83.3 mL/year (95% CI 37.6, 
129.0) in INPULSIS-2. 
2.1.  Supportive study 
Study  1199.31  was  a  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  evaluation  of  the  safety  and 
pharmacokinetics  of  multiple  rising  doses  of  nintedanib  at  50  mg  b.i.d.  (14  days),  100  mg  b.i.d.  (14 
days),  and  150  mg  b.i.d.  (28  days)  on  top  of  standard  medical  care  with  stratification  according  to 
pirfenidone use, in Japanese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Methods 
The  principal  aims  of  the  study  were  to  investigate  the  safety  and  pharmacokinetics  of  nintedanib  in 
Japanese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with and without pirfenidone background treatment.  
Main criteria for inclusion: 
Diagnosis  of  IPF  according  to  Japan  Respiratory  Society  (JRS)  guideline  Forced  vital  capacity  (FVC) 
≥50%, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) 30-79%.  For patients on pirfenidone, treatment 
with a steady dose (1800 mg/day) for at least 3 months was required. Only for the 150 mg b.i.d. dose 
group, low dose pirfenidone users (controlled with 1200 mg/day or 600 mg/day) for at least 3 months 
were allowed to participate.  
Exclusion criteria 
Patients were not eligible to participate in the study if they met any of the following exclusion criteria;  
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >1.5 x upper limit of normal range 
(ULN)  at  screening.  total  bilirubin  >1.5  x  ULN  at  screening,  relevant  airways  obstruction  (i.e., 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7) at screening, continuous oxygen supplementation (defined as ≥15 
hours  supplemental  oxygen  per  day),  active  infection  at  screening  or  randomisation,  neutrophils 
<1500/mm3  at  screening,  platelets  <100000/mL  at  screening,  haemoglobin  <9.0  g/dL  at  screening, 
being  treated  with  any  of  the  following  concomitant    medications,  oral  corticosteroid  medication  at 
unstable doses (i.e., less than 8 weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 15 mg 
of prednisone per day or 30 mg every other day, ketoconazole or atazanavir, significant co-morbidity. 
Treatments 
Study participants were enrolled in 3 different dose groups. In the nintedanib 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg 
b.i.d dose groups (Cohorts 1 and 2), patients were randomised to nintedanib (50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg 
b.i.d., respectively) or placebo in a 3:1 fashion, and in the nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. dose group (Cohort 
3), nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. or placebo in a 3:1fashion for patients with pirfenidone or in a 6:1 fashion for 
patients without pirfenidone. For the nintedanib 50 mg b.i.d. and 100 mg b.i.d. groups, patients were 
stratified  so  that  one  half  was  with  pirfenidone  and  the  other  half  was  without  pirfenidone.  For  the 
nintedanib 150 mg b.i.d. dose group, patients randomised to nintedanib were also stratified so that one 
half was with pirfenidone and the other half without pirfenidone, whereas patients randomised to placebo 
were stratified so that twice as many were with pirfenidone compared with those without pirfenidone. At 
least 8 patients were to be on pirfenidone1800 mg per day. 
Results 
Of the 50 patients, 35 (70.0%) patients were male and 15 (30.0%) were female. The mean age was 65.2 
years; 36 (72.0%) patients were ex-smokers; 14 patients (28.0%) had never smoked; and none was a 
current smoker.

2.1.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
the design and conduct of the studies was good with the dose ranging and Phase III studies carried out to 
ICH-GCP standards.  Study 1199.30 explored an adequately wide range of doses and was large enough 
and  long  enough  to  provide  a  fairly  convincing  indication  that  150  mg  bid  was  an  effective  dose. 
Nintedanib has evident tolerability problems and in consequence it was reasonable not to push the dose 
above 150 mg bid. 
The Phase III studies evaluated a dose which is probably at the upper end of the tolerability range against 
placebo which is currently the most meaningful comparator. The studies give fairly consistent results for

FVC but inconsistent results for quality of life (SGRQ total score) and IPF acute exacerbations. However, 
overall the clinical database points to nintedanib being a potentially useful treatment in IPF.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Studies  1199.32  and  1199.34  show  a  clear  and  consistent  benefit  in  reducing  the  decline  of  FVC  by 
approximately  125  mL/year  and  94  mL/year  respectively.  The  time  course  for  the  decline  in  FVC  is 
strikingly similar in both studies and the divergent slopes of the decline curves suggests a real benefit 
over time rather than a once-off benefit which is then maintained over time (in which case the slopes 
would be parallel). Slightly surprisingly in view of the spirometric effect there was no benefit in terms of 
gas exchange (DLco) in either study.  
Divergences between the studies are a lack of benefit on SGRQ and frequency of IPF exacerbations in 
Study 1199.32 both of which have a statistically significant advantage over placebo in Study 1199.34, 
which study may represent reality is impossible to say. However, statistically significant benefits for both 
variables were present in the 150 mg bid treatment arm compared to placebo in the dose ranging study. 
The Applicant has analysed the non-Japanese dose ranging and Phase III studies separately, including 
various sensitivity analyses and in pooled analyses. The methods have been appropriate missing data 
have generally not been imputed, the number of endpoints has been limited and diverse variables which 
are  not  interdependent  have  been  chosen.  The  hierarchical  testing  method  to  counteract  multiplicity 
seems quite conservative. The CHMP does not consider further analysis necessary  
2.1.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Nintedanib shows evidence of reduction of the rate of decline in lung function as indicated by absolute 
volume FVC. Percentage predicted FVC is preferred endpoint as it standardises the absolute 
measurement and reduces or eliminates variability due to demographic factors such as age, gender, body 
size which could be different between different treatment arms; the data on change in predicted normal 
are consistent with those on absolute volume which is reassuring.  
The CHMP support a therapeutic indication which does not specify a stage of disease severity. 
The data on quality of life as indicated by SGRQ total score are discordant between the Phase III studies 
with no difference for nintedanib compared to placebo in Study 1199.32 and a significant benefit in Study 
1199.34.  
For acute exacerbations of IPF, two out of three studies show a statistical significant benefit  for 150 mg 
bid. 
2.2.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of nintedanib in patients with IPF has been investigated in seven clinical trials; two Phase II 
trials 1199.30 and 1199.31 (dose ranging and dose ranging in Japanese patients respectively), two Phase 
III trials 1199.32 and 1199.34, and the three phase II/III open extension trials 1199.33, 1199.35, and 
119.40.  
Table 12 summarises the IPF Safety data base. 
Overall,  1061  patients  were  treated  in  the  phase  III  studies  (referred  to  as  SG1.1  in  the  rest  of  the 
document) of whom 423 received placebo and 638 received nintedanib 150 mg bid. About one fifth of the 
Assessment report

patients discontinued treatment prematurely;  placebo: 18.9%, nintedanib: 24.5%. The main reason for 
discontinuation was AE (placebo: 13.9%; nintedanib: 19.9%).

As might be expected in a study of a progressive fatal disease almost all patients experienced adverse 
events. However, investigators attributed causality to treatment more than twice as often in the 
nintedanib arm compared to placebo (Table 14) above. Review of the SOC categorisation suggests that 
nintedanib is toxic to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract The different proportion of patients experiencing 
weight loss by treatment arm probably reflects the GI tolerability and safety problems.   
The Inclusion of IPF as an AE is unexpected as it is an inclusion criterion for entrance to the studies. The 
Applicant has followed a common convention of considering worsening of the disease to be treated as an 
adverse event. In reality it is a lack of efficacy event. This convention which is probably regulatory driven 
confuses safety and efficacy. If the medicinal product is effective, as is the case here there are likely to be 
more ‘AEs’ due to disease worsening in the placebo arm thus the apparent safety profile of the placebo

arm will appear worse than it actually is. Unfortunately, this is not remediable in the present 
circumstances. 
Serious adverse event/deaths  
The analysis of fatal AEs was based on treatment-emergent AEs. This means all AEs with an onset date (or 
worsening) between the first intake of study medication and 28 days after the discontinuation of study 
medication were assigned to treatment even if the death due to this AE occurred after the this period. 
Adverse events leading to death were more frequent in the placebo group (31 patients, 7.3%) than in the 
nintedanib 150 mg bid group (37 patients, 5.8%) of SG-1.1

Safety in special populations 
No overall analysis of safety in special populations is provided.  Pharmacokinetics in renal impairment and 
hepatic impairment is discussed in the clinical pharmacology of the application as is the effect of intrinsic 
factors such as weight, gender, and age.  Hepatic safety is discussed in other section of this report. 
Immunological events 
Despite nintedanib’s potential for interaction at receptors which mediate the immune response infections 
do not seem to be more frequent or of a different pattern to those experienced by placebo treated 
patients; nor are there examples of opportunist infection in the data base. However, as for the potential 
for hepatic injury, the database is too small to throw up rare events.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Because of its metabolic route nintedanib appears to have a low potential for drug-drug interaction, 
probably including pirfenidone but because of the clinical likelihood for coadministration the latter 
represents an important missing information. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Phase III trials overall about one fifth of the patients discontinued treatment prematurely; placebo: 
18.9%, nintedanib: 24.5%. The main reason for discontinuation was AE. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication were more frequent in the nintedanib 150 
mg bid group (19.3%) than in the placebo group (13.0%) of SG-1.1. Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation by SOC that were more common in the nintedanib than the placebo group by at least 1% 
were gastrointestinal disorders (placebo: 1.2%, nintedanib: 7.4%) and investigations (0.5% vs. 2.8%). 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders leading to discontinuation occurred more often in patients 
receiving placebo (6.6%) than in patients receiving nintedanib (3.1%).

2.2.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nintedanib is known from its development in various cancer indications as well as the 
current IPF indication. In the cancer studies it was used at a higher dose than is now proposed for IPF. As 
there  is  good  evidence  that  safety  and  tolerability  are  worse  with  higher  doses  data  from  the  cancer 
studies cannot be extrapolated to IPF; also the co-medications and co-morbidities in the two situations 
are quite different.  The Applicant’s safety analysis is therefore concerned only with the IPF indication and 
this is appropriate. 
The facility for dose reductions and treatment interruptions in the clinical programme was a good one as 
it mimics what might happen in clinical practice and it permits patient retention in clinical practice. The 
availability of a 150 mg and a 100 mg strength capsule is also helpful as it will permit dose flexibility in 
clinical practice. 
Three evident safety/tolerability problems emerge from the data; gastrointestinal toxicity in general and 
diarrhoea in particular, the third being the potential for hepatic injury. The database shows a number of 
non-diarrhoeal events such as bleeding or a perforating peptic ulcer and a better analysis of these events 
was made by the applicant. The applicant considers bleeding as an important potential risk for the 
treatment with nintedanib due to its mode of action.  
. The development of diarrhoea in a patient whose pulmonary status limits mobility is highly undesirable 
for patients and caregivers and is a frequent and causally mediated event in nintedanib treated patients.  
The occurrence of elevated transaminases three to fourfold more frequently in nintedanib versus placebo 
treated patients is of concern and suggests a potential for drug related liver injury. The potential for 
Assessment report

nintedanib to cause liver toxicity is the most serious risk associated with the drug and there is a warning 
in the SmPC regarding the need to monitor hepatic enzymes.  
2.2.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The majority of the reported adverse events of Nintedanib are considered manageable with dose 
reductions. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) specific for nintedanib were 
gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhoea, increased liver enzyme values (ALT and AST).  
All the above side-effects can be dealt with in the product information and the side effect profile presents 
a picture of acceptable tolerability in most patients.  
Because of the clinical likelihood for coadministration with pirfenidone it represents an important missing 
information. Therefore the applicant commits to perform an open-label nintedanib pirfenidone drug-drug 
interaction study in patients with IPF 
2.3.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Studies  1199.32  and  1199.34  show  a  clear  and  consistent  benefit  in  reducing  the  decline  of  FVC  by 
approximately  125  mL/year  and  94  mL/year  -respectively.  The  time  course  for  the  decline  in  FVC  is 
similar in both studies and the divergent slopes of the decline curves suggests a benefit over time rather 
than an initial once-off benefit which is then maintained over time (in which case the slopes would be 
parallel).  Slightly  surprisingly  in  view  of  the  spirometric  benefit  there  was  no  benefit  in  terms  of  gas 
exchange (DLco) in either study.  
Nintedanib shows persuasive evidence of reduction of the rate of decline in lung function as indicated by 
absolute  volume  FVC.  Percentage  predicted  FVC  is  preferred  endpoint  as  it  standardises  the  absolute 
measurement and reduces or eliminates variability due to demographic factors such as age, gender, body 
size which could be different between different treatment arms; the data on change in predicted normal 
are consistent with those on absolute volume which is reassuring. Divergences between the studies are 
seen for SGRQ total score andIPF exacerbations. In Study 1199.32 there is no difference between the 
treatment  groups  for  SGRQ  and  for  exacerbations.    In  contrast  both  have  a  statistically  significant 
advantage  over  placebo  in  Study  1199.34,  which  study  may  represent  reality  is  impossible  to  say. 
However, statistically significant benefits for SGRQ and exacerbation variables were present in the 150 
mg bid treatment arm compared to placebo in the dose ranging study. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
As indicated above the lung function (spirometry) benefit is consistent over three studies for the 150 mg 
bid dose, but there is no quality of life or acute exacerbation for active treatment in Study 1199.32..  In 
the opinion of the CHMP demonstration of the lung function benefit is robust. The pathophysiology and 
symptoms of IPF are largely or entirely due to loss of lung function and to eventual respiratory failure. 
Consequently if the rate of deterioration of lung function is slowed indirect or secondary benefits might be 
expected and this appears to be the case for quality of life and IPF exacerbations. As the disease is quite 
rapidly progressive it is to be expected that quality of life will deteriorate measurably over the course of 
a year for both active and placebo groups. It is important that it should not deteriorate more in the active 
treatment group due to toxicity and the burden of treatment and this may be what was observed in Study 
1199.32. Therefore, the fact that nintedanib is preserving approximately 100 mL of lung capacity relative 
to placebo does not imply that it is slowing progressive disease. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Three evident safety/tolerability problems emerge from the data; gastrointestinal toxicity in general and 
diarrhoea in particular, the third being the potential for hepatic injury. 
The database shows a number of non-diarrhoeal events such as bleeding or a perforating peptic ulcer. The 
development of diarrhoea in a patient whose pulmonary status limits mobility is highly undesirable for 
patients and caregivers and is a frequent and causally mediated event in nintedanib treated patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/76777/2015 
Page 82/85  
  
  
 
 
The occurrence of elevated transaminases three to fourfold more frequently in nintedanib versus placebo 
treated patients is of concern and suggests a potential for drug related liver injury. The potential for 
nintedanib to cause liver toxicity is the most serious risk associated with the drug and there is a warning 
in the SmPC regarding the need to monitor hepatic enzymes.  
There  are  also  additional  suggestions  of  potentially  serious  side  effects  that  might  become  more 
significant over time and would be consistent with the anti-angiogenic action of the drug. These include a 
possible  increased  risk  of  myocardial  infarction,  systemic  hypertension  and  bleeding  (from  the 
anti-PDGFR activity of the drug). Gastrointestinal perforation is an additional potential risk that has been 
identified by the Applicant and is related to mechanism of action.  
All the above side-effects can be dealt with in the product information and the side effect profile presents 
a picture of acceptable tolerability in most patients.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Given the rarity of the condition and the frequent co-morbidities associated with the disease, it can be 
problematic to decipher side-effects that are genuinely arising from drug treatment and therefore there is 
substantial noise in the adverse event profile. The population treated with nintedanib in the IPF clinical 
development is likely to be too small and exposed for too short a time to provide a realistic indication of 
the likelihood of serious drug related liver injury in  clinical practice. However, certain side-effects are 
clearly linked and these include gastrointestinal side-effects and hepatic enzyme elevation that may lead 
to ongoing liver damage.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The slowing of lung function deterioration is scientifically and clinically interesting targeted therapy in IPF. 
It was first achieved through the authorisation of pirfenidone. 
Change in lung function decline is not directly perceptible by IPF patients therefore the secondary benefits 
on quality of life and reduction of the frequency of exacerbations are very important. For quality of life an 
important consideration is ‘first cause no harm’ and this is probably the case for nintedanib two studies 
show  a  benefit  and  one  showed  no  advantage  in  QoL  measurements  –  probably  consistent  with  the 
variability  of  the  measurement.  Frequency  of  exacerbations  is  very  important  as  they  may  lead  to 
hospitalisation and/or death, and in the case of non-fatal hospitalisation it can be expected to require 
weeks rather than days to manage. 
Diarrhoea in a poorly mobile patient may be a major social and symptomatic problem even if it can be 
expected to resolve on treatment cessation. 
Nintedanib appears to be potentially associated with rare but serious gastrointestinal toxicity, peptic ulcer 
and the consequences thereof, perforation and haemorrhage. 
In view of the frequency of abnormalities of liver function enzymes it is to be expected that symptomatic 
hepatitis,  drug  induced  liver  injury,  and  probably  liver  failure  will  occur  in  clinical  practice, there  is  a 
warning in the SmPC regarding the need to monitor hepatic enzymes.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Nintedanib is the second pharmacological treatment shown to have a clinical benefit in, and possibly alter 
the natural history of IPF. As IPF is a disease with a very poor prognosis and a high unmet need, and 
where intervention at an early stage of disease may have more capacity to prevent irreversible scarring 
and extend life. Therefore, the positive effect demonstrated on slowing of deterioration in lung capacity 
can be regarded as very encouraging. 
The CHMP consider that it is an important treatment for patients and physicians who wish to avail of it. It 
is not a curative treatment and its disease modifying potential is modest. 
The side effect profile also presents a picture of acceptable tolerability in most patients.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Ofev ( nintedanib) is not similar to Esbriet (pirfenidone), 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Ofev is indicated in adults for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
(IPF) is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

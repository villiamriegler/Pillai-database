and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing 
Authorisation to Clopidogrel ratiopharm. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Clopidogrel Ratiopharm 75 mg film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product containing the active 
substance clopidogrel as clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate. The reference medicinal product is Plavix 75 
mg film-coated tablets, also containing clopidogrel in the form of hydrogen sulphate. Plavix has been 
centrally authorised on 15 July 1998. Both medicinal products are administered orally. Bioequivalence 
has been demonstrated to the reference medicinal product. 
Clopidogrel is a non-competitive inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the platelet receptors. The 
effect of ADP on platelets is mediated by two G-protein coupled P2Y receptors (P2Y1 and P2Y12) and the 
cation channel-coupled P2X1 receptor. The adenylate cyclase-coupled ADP receptor P2Y12 is the main 
target of clopidogrel and leads to inhibition of platelet activation, aggregation, and Gp IIb/IIIa receptor 
activation. Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine and only the S-enantiomer is pharmacologically active. 
The safety and efficacy profile of clopidogrel has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of 
which can be found in the EPAR for Plavix. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience 
contributing  to  the  knowledge  of  the  clinical  use  of  this  product.  Clopidogrel  Ratiopharm  75  mg 
film-coated tablet contains clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate. Since this application is a generic application 
referring to the reference medicinal product Plavix, summary of the clinical data of clopidogrel hydrogen 
sulphate is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy 
and safety have been conducted with clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate.  
The indication proposed for Clopidogrel Ratiopharm is the same as the authorised indication for the 
reference medicinal product: 
Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in:  
• Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic 
stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.  
• Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome:  
-  Non-ST  segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave  myocardial 
infarction),  including  patients  undergoing  a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).  
-  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction,  in  combination  with  ASA  in  medically  treated 
patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. 
Clopidogrel  is  also  indicated  in  adults  for  the  prevention  of  atherothrombotic  and  thromboembolic 
events in atrial fibrillation in: 
• Patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for vascular events, are not suitable for 
treatment with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and who have a low bleeding risk, clopidogrel is indicated 
in combination with ASA for the prevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events, including 
stroke. 
The  application  for  Clopidogrel  ratiopharm  is  a  duplicate  application  of  Clopidogrel  Teva 
(EMEA/H/C/1053), which was approved on 28.7.2009.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablet  containing  97.875  mg  clopidogrel  hydrogen 
sulphate as active substance corresponding to 75 mg clopidogrel base.  
Other 
ingredients  are: 
(tablet 
core): 
lactose  monohydrate,  microcrystalline 
cellulose, 
hydroxypropylcellulose  (E463),  crospovidone  (type  A),  hydrogenated  vegetable  oil,  sodium 
laurilsulphate, (tablet coating): lactose monohydrate, hypromellose (E464), titanium dioxide (E171), 
macrogol 4000, iron oxide red (E172), iron oxide yellow (E172) and indigo carmine aluminium lake 
(E132). 
The product is available in Alu/Alu perforated unit dose blisters or Alu/Alu peelable perforated unit dose 
blisters or HDPE bottles as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The  chemical  name  for  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  is  methyl(+)-(S)-α-(2-chlorophenyl)- 
-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine-5(4H)-acetate  sulphate  (1:1).  The  active  substance  is  optically 
active and is presented as the S-enantiomer in the finished product. 
Clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  (syn.  clopidogrel  bisulfate)  appears  as  a  white  to  off-white 
non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. The clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate selected is sparingly soluble in 
water at neutral pH, but shows pH dependent solubility (higher solubility in acidic pH).  It is freely is 
soluble in methanol, dissolves sparingly in methylene chloride, and is practically insoluble in ethyl ether.  
It  exists  in  several  crystalline  forms  and  in  an  amorphous  form.  However,  this  medicinal  product 
contains one pure polymorph form and does not contain any detectable amounts of other forms. The 
active  substance  contains  one  single  chiral  centre  and  the  S-enantiomer  is  used  in  the  product. 
Enantiomeric purity control is included in the active substance specification. 
As  there  is  a  monograph  of  Clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulfate  in  the  European  Pharmacopoeia,  the 
manufacturer  of  the  active  substance  has  been  granted  a  Certificate  of  Suitability  of  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph.  Additional specifications have been set for the additional residual solvents that may be 
present due to the route of synthesis. The specification includes additional specific tests and acceptance 
criteria for polymorphic form, particle size, bulk and tapped density. All additional analytical methods 
have been adequately described and validated according to ICH Q2.  
Certificates of analysis of three production scale batches controlled according to the specification were 
provided. All results comply with the proposed specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of 
the product.

EMA/63392/2015  
Page 7/23 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability data on five batches (pilot size up to production scale) of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in packaging simulating the actual container closure system for 60 months under 
long  term  conditions  at  25  °C/60  %  RH  and  for  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at 
40 °C/75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Stability  data  for  another  21  production  scale  batches  under  long  term  conditions  at  2-8  °C 
for 36 months and for 9 production scale batches under accelerated conditions at 25 °C/60 % RH for 
6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The stability indicating parameters investigated were: description, identification by enantiomeric purity 
and polymorphic form, purity and assay. Impurity B (Ph. Eur.) was not tested because this is not a 
degradation  product  and  therefore  it  is  not  expected  to  increase  during  storage.  The  analytical 
procedures  were  the  same  as  those  for  release  with  the  exception  of  method  for  assay  and  all  are 
stability indicating.  
A photostability study in compliance with the ICH Guideline Q1B was done. According to the obtained 
results,  active  substance  is  slightly  sensitive  to light.  The  proposed  packaging  is  shown  suitable  for 
clopidogrel bisulfate storage. 
Based on presented stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  a  stable  immediate-release  tablet, 
bioequivalent with the reference medicinal product, Plavix film-coated tablets. 
Experimental  batches  have  been  prepared  in  order  to  select  the  most  suitable  excipients  and 
manufacturing  method.  The  choice  of  excipients  has  been  justified.    The  excipients  used  in  the 
formulation comply with the monographs of the current Ph. Eur., except hydrogenated vegetable oil 
type  I  and  coating  mixture  Opadry.  Hydrogenated  vegetable  oil  type  I  complies  with  BP.  Opadry  II 
OY-L-34836 pink is specified according to in-house specifications. The ingredients of Opadry, except 
colorants, also comply with Ph. Eur. The coating colorants meet the relevant requirements for colours 
for  use  in  foodstuff.  Certificates  of  analysis  are  provided  for  all  excipients.  Based  on  the  results,  a 
formulation containing hydrogenated vegetable oil type I and sodium laurilsulphate as lubricants and 
crospovidone as disintegrant was selected, manufactured by wet granulation.  
Taking into account the solubility of clopidogrel bisulfate form I, particle size distribution is a critical 
parameter  for  the  performance  of  the  product  therefore  it  is  controlled  in  the  active  substance 
specification with limits set according to the biobatch.  
The  obtained  formulations  have  been  compared  with  Plavix  with  regards  to  in-vitro  dissolution  test 
results and the impurities in the stability studies. The development and selection of the dissolution test 
method  have  been  sufficiently  described  and  justified.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the  dissolution 
method has been demonstrated. Two bioequivalence studies were performed showing bioequivalence 
between the clinical formulation and the reference product. The formulation used in the bioequivalence 
studies is the same as the proposed for commercial batches. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is a standard process and consists of nine steps: premixing, granulation, 
drying, milling, blending, final mixing, compression, coating and packaging. The manufacturing process 
Assessment report  
EMA/63392/2015  
Page 8/23 
 
 
 
 
is satisfactorily described and validated. The critical steps in the manufacture of Clopidogrel Ratiopharm 
(granulation and tableting) are controlled by appropriate in-process controls.  
The  manufacturing  process  demonstrated  to  be  reproducible  and  provides  a  finished  product  that 
complies with the in-process and finished product specifications. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include tests and limits for appearance, identification and assay of 
the active substance (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur. -HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
impurities (HPLC), microbial contamination (Ph. Eur. - not routinely), water content (Karl Fischer) and 
identification of colour (Ph. Eur. / HPLC - not routinely). 
The analytical methods are described in the Ph. Eur. or are developed in-house. The in-house methods 
have been satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Appropriate data have been presented to justify the release specifications for each quality characteristic 
that is controlled. Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable 
from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis results from four pilot batches were submitted (the same batches as for validation of the 
manufacturing process). The results comply with the proposed specification, indicate that the process is 
under control and confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed on 4 pilot scale batches stored for up to 36 months at 25 °C/60 % 
RH and for six months at 40 °C/75 % RH in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines.  All intended 
market containers are included in the study. Bulk stability on one batch has been performed. In the 
stability protocol all stability indicating quality aspects are included: appearance, dissolution, assay, 
impurities, water and microbiological purity. The analytical methods used are the same as for release 
testing and are all stability indicating. 
A photostability study was performed on one batch as per the relevant ICH guideline. Results showed 
that the product is not sensitive to light. 
In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC. 
Adventitious agents 
Clopidogrel Ratiopharm contains only one excipient from animal origin. Lactose monohydrate is derived 
from  milk  sourced  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  conditions  as  milk  collected  for  the  human 
consumption. The supplier has provided the required statements on the risk of BSE/TSE. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The active substance is well-known and is described in a Ph. Eur. monograph. The quality of the active 
substance complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph. The excipients comply with the relevant compendial 
or  adequate  in-house  specifications.  In  comparison  with  the  EU  reference  product,  Clopidogrel 
Ratiopharm  contains  the  same  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  in  terms  of  the  active 
substance,  however  some  excipients  are  different.  Both  the  EU  reference  product  and  Clopidogrel 
Ratiopharm exhibit similar dissolution profiles. The packaging materials are commonly used and well 
documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been adequately described and 
Assessment report  
EMA/63392/2015  
Page 9/23 
 
 
 
 
controlled  with  appropriate  in  process  controls.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH 
guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product 
has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of clopidogrel  hydrogen 
sulphate was provided, which was based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature.  
Clopidogrel  is  a  widely  used  well-known  substance.  Its  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicological properties are well characterised. This generic application contains the same salt of the 
active substance as the reference medicinal product, and the excipients used in the formulation are 
conventional, well known and broadly used in other medicinal products. Therefore, CHMP agreed that 
no further studies were required and that a summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of 
clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate was appropriate.  
Introduction of the medicinal product onto the market is unlikely to result in any significant increase in 
the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  products,  and  would  thus  not  be 
expected to have an adverse effect upon the environment. With this regard and on the basis of CHMP 
Guideline  on  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products 
for  Human  Use 
(CPMP/SWP/4447/00),  a  formal  environmental  risk  assessment  was  not  considered  necessary  -  the 
ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the non-clinical data provided are adequate to support the clinical use of 
Clopidogrel ratiopharm.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate. To support the 
marketing  authorisation  application,  the  applicant  conducted  two  bioequivalence  studies  comparing 
Clopidogrel Bisulfate 75 mg film-coated tablets with the originator Plavix 75 mg film-coated tablets. 
Both studies were performed in fasting subjects, one involved measuring the parent drug and another 
involved  measuring  the  major  (inactive)  metabolite,  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid.  In  addition,  one 
pharmacokinetic  study  of  Plavix  75  mg  film-coated  tablets  was  conducted  in  order  to  estimate  the 
intra-subject variability of selected pharmacokinetic parameters under fasting conditions. 
GCP 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  clinical  studies  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  Good  Clinical 
Practice (GCP) requirements.

Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies (studies 2007-1362 
and 2008-1676), alongside a pharmacokinetic study of Plavix 75 mg film-coated tablets (study 
2008-1706).  Study 2008-1676, which determines the bioequivalence based on the data for clopidogrel 
carboxylic acid, is considered supportive, whereas study 2007-1362 is important for the confirmation of 
bioequivalence.

Population(s) studied   
The  selected  population  in  all  three  clinical  trials  is  in  accordance  with  the  NƒG  on  Investigation  of 
Bioavailability and Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. Subjects participating in the studies were 
of different races and met the inclusion criteria and did not fulfil the exclusion criteria described in the 
study protocol. 
Study code: 2007-1362  
The population in Study 2007-1362 included  non-smoking, male and female volunteers between 18-55 
years of age with a BMI between 19 and 30 kg/m
2
, who were judged to be healthy based on a medical 
examination.  Ninty-seven  (97)  subjects  completed  the  study  and  are  included  in  the  analysis.

and statistical analysis. Drop-outs handling was performed according to the protocol requirements. The 
protocol deviations were not considered to have an impact on the efficacy and safety evaluation.  
Study code: 2008-1706  
The population in Study 2008-1706  included non-smoking, male and female volunteers between 18-55 
2
years of age (inclusive) with a BMI between 19 and 30 kg/m
 (inclusive), who were judged to be healthy 
based on a medical history, ECG, laboratory evaluation and physical examination. Sixteen (16) subjects 
were  dosed,  completed  the  study  and  are  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analysis. 
Drop-outs  handling  was  performed  according  to  the  protocol  requirements.  The  protocol  deviations 
were not considered to have an impact on the efficacy and safety evaluation.  
Analytical methods   
The plasma samples were assayed for clopidogrel and its metabolite using validated LC/MS/MS method. 
The validation of the LC/MS/MS method has been performed before the new guideline came into force 
and  therefore  it  was  not  in  line  with  the  current  Guideline  on  bioanalytical  method  validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009.  
As part of the first round responses, the Applicant has provided the scientific justification of the lack of 
ISR  data 
in  accordance  with  the  requirement  mentioned 
in  the  PKWP  Q&A  document 
(EMA/618604/2008 Rev. 9) and thus justified deviations from the above current guideline requirement. 
CHMP considered that the lack of ISR data was adequately justified. 
In  conclusion,  the  applied  bioanalytical  method  was  adequately  validated  and  showed  acceptable 
performance during analysis of study samples.  
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The main investigated pharmacokinetics parameters were AUC

Statistical methods   
Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  was  performed  on  the  ln-transformed  Cmax,  AUC0-t,  AUCinf    and  to 
untransformed Kel and Thalf parameters. The significance of the sequence, period and treatment effects 
and  the  subject  within  sequence  random  effects  were  tested.  Values  for  the  Tmax  parameter  were 
analyzed by a non-parametric approach.

The following acceptance criteria were set as per clinical study report:

reference product for the ln-transformed parameters AUC
The  90%  confidence  interval  for  the  exponential of  the  difference  between  the  test  and  the

The  90%  confidence  interval  for  the  exponential of  the  difference  between  the  test  and  the 
should be within 75-133%.  
max 
The AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax were considered as primary parameters for bioequivalence conclusion with 
the proposed acceptance range of 80-125% for the AUC and 75-133% for the Cmax defined in the study 
protocol. The 90% confidence intervals for AUCt and AUCinf proposed for study 2007-1362 are in line 
with  the  recommendation  of  the  CHMP  guideline  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1  and  the  observed 
results of the clinical study fulfil this requirement. However, widening of the limits for bioequivalence 
conclusions  for  Cmax  values  was  not  acceptable  according  to  the  current  CHMP  recommendations. 
Nevertheless, since the Cmax results of the study are within the standard 80-125% limits required by 
the NƒG on Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, the proposal 
for widening the confidence intervals for Cmax is not of importance. Differences in tmax between test 
and reference products were not considered to be clinical relevant.

The 90% confidence interval values for the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax, AUCt 
and  AUCinf  are  within  the  acceptance  range  of  80-125%  as  defined  in  the  study  protocol.  Low 
intra-subject  variability  for  all  pharmacokinetics  parameters  has  been  shown.  No  pre-dose  levels  of 
clopidogrel carboxylic acid are observed before period 2 drug administration and no subject reached 
Cmax at the first sample time, indicating that the sampling period is adequate. Tmax is not significantly 
different between test and reference products. Calculated intra-subject variability was reasonably low 
for clopidogrel carboxylic acid.

Pharmacokinetic study 2008-1706 was conducted to establish whether Plavix 75 mg film-coated tablets 
is a medicinal product with a high pharmacokinetic intra-individual variability. Based on the results of 
this single study, Plavix showed an intra-subject variability of >30%. However, the CHMP considered 
that  although  these  data  could  indicate  high  within-subject  variability,  it  has  not  been  definitely 
established that clopidogrel is a “highly variable” drug and the results do not justify such assumption. It 
is  also  unlikely  that  the  power  of  study  2008-1706  could  be  considered  acceptable  to  justify  this 
conclusion, since only a limited number of subjects participated in this trial. 
Safety data  
Study code: 2007-1362 
No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in study 2007-1362. There were 130 adverse events (AEs) 
involving 46 subjects in the study. The most commonly reported AEs associated with clopidogrel were 
blood GGT, AST, ALT increased, loose stool, light-headedness, abdominal pain, elevated urea in blood, 
increased creatinine, headache and other. The AEs were believed not to have a significant impact on the 
safety of the subjects or on the integrity of the study results. Tolerability of the test product was found 
to be acceptable. 
Three  subjects  withdrew;  two  subjects  withdrew  due  to  personal  reasons  and  one  subject  was 
dismissed from the study after period 2 dosing due to missed blood draws. There were post-dose blood 
sampling deviations and one subject refused to provide blood samples for post-study haematology and 
serum chemistry tests. The protocol deviations were not considered to have an impact on the efficacy 
and safety. 
Study code: 2008-1676 
No  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  occurred  during  the  study.  There  were  24  adverse  events  (AEs) 
involving 12 subjects in the study. Amongst the adverse events reported in relation to the drug was 
dizziness, somnolence or increased levels of creatinine. The AEs were believed not to have a significant 
impact on the safety of the subjects or on the integrity of the study results.

One subject was dismissed from the trial prior to check-in for period 2 due to an adverse event rectal 
bleeding.  There  were  some  post-dose  blood  sampling  deviations  greater  than  or  equal  to  1  minute 
deviations from the scheduled sampling time. These were accounted for during the pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  No  other  protocol  deviations  were  noted  in  this  study  and  those  that  occurred  were  not 
considered to have impact on the efficacy and safety evaluation. 
Study code: 2008-1706 
No SAEs occurred during the study 2008-1706. The AEs related to the drug such as headache, vomit, 
nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, fatigue and blurred vision, were reported. None of the AEs had a 
significant impact on the safety of the subjects or on the integrity of the study results. 
Two subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events (headache, nausea, emesis, sore throat, cough, 
dizziness and feeling hot). There were some post-dose blood sampling deviations greater than or equal 
to 1 minute and deviations from the scheduled sampling time. The handling of drop outs was performed 
according to the protocol requirements. Protocol deviations were not considered to have impact on the 
efficacy and safety evaluation. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Clopidogrel ratiopharm is considered bioequivalent with 
Plavix. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
The  clopidogrel  containing  medicinal  products  from  Teva  group  have  been  marketed  in  EEA  and 
non-EEA.  Therefore  post-marketing  data  for  those  products  are  available  for  the  period 
31.1.2007-17.11.2013.  The  assessment  of  safety  data  was  prepared  within  PSUSA  procedure  No. 
PSUSA/00000820/201311. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Application for Clopidogrel ratiopharm is a duplicate application of Clopidogrel Teva 75mg film-coated 
tablets (EMEA/H/C/1053), which was centrally authorised on 28 July, 2009. 
Overall discussion on clinical aspects discussed initially in 2009 and currently is summarised below.  
Two  clinical  bioequivalence  trials  were  provided  for  Clopidogrel  ratiopharm  (clopidogrel  hydrogen 
sulphate) and also one pharmacokinetic study with the reference product. At the time of approval of the 
reference  product  Plavix  (clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate),  there  was  no  reliable  and  validated 
methodology for the determination of the pharmacokinetics of the parent prodrug clopidogrel, or of the 
active  metabolite  clopidogrel  thiol.  Thus,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  was  established  based  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid,  which  is  the  major  non-active  metabolite.  In  the 
meantime, a reliable bio-analytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine has 
been developed. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite is still not well established, 
the CHMP accepted in 2009 the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent compound data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/63392/2015  
Page 18/23 
 
 
 
 
Thus,  study  2008-1676,  which  determines  the  bioequivalence  based  on  the  data  for  clopidogrel 
carboxylic acid, is considered supportive, whereas study 2007-1362 is important for the confirmation of 
bioequivalence.  
The published literature indicated that the bioavailability of a single oral dose of clopidogrel and the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might be increased several fold 
in  the  fed  condition  compared  to the  fasted  condition.  The  currently  presented  clinical  studies  were 
conducted  in  fasted  state  and  thus,  the  CHMP  requested  a  clarification  of  this  approach.  Adequate 
justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be  demonstrated  only  under  fasting 
condition  was  provided.  Bioequivalence  studies  in  fasting  conditions  are  normally  recommended  as 
mentioned  in  the  Questions  &  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  Guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) document as this situation would be more sensitive to differences in 
pharmacokinetics. In addition the dissolution studies using clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate conducted at 
three different pH values (1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) and mimicking the conditions of a fed state did not show any 
major differences between the originator and the generic product.  
The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the 
bioequivalence studies included validation with the analysis of calibration curves and controls at various 
concentrations.  The  CHMP  questioned  whether  there  is  a  potential  for  back-conversion  of  the 
quantitatively  major  metabolite  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  the  parent  drug.  Considering  that  the 
plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a 
minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a huge over-estimation of clopidogrel plasma 
levels  and  would  bias  the  outcome  of  the  bioequivalence  study.  Demonstration  of  the  lack  of 
back-conversion of clopidogrel carboxylic acid metabolite to the parent drug under all conditions for 
sample handling and storage was requested by the CHMP. After review of additional experimental data 
the CHMP considered the issue resolved. 
In  addition,  the  validity  of  the  bioanalytical  method  (lack  of  ISR)  in  the  Bioequivalence  study 
2007-1362.    The  Applicant  has  adequately  justified  the  lack  of  incurred  sample  reanalysis  (ISR) 
therefore CHMP considers this issue to be solved. 
The bioequivalence study 2007-1362 and its statistical evaluation were in accordance with accepted 
standards  for  bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  The  parameters  used  to  establish 
bioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma 
concentration  of  the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these 
parameters were within the recommended 80%-125% range for clopidogrel, as required by the above 
mentioned guideline. 
Study 2008-1706 aimed to demonstrate the proposed high variability of Plavix, however, the CHMP did 
not consider this stand alone clinical trial sufficient to establish Plavix as a drug with a highly variable 
pharmacokinetics  due  to  its  inadequate  design  and  limited  number  of  participants.  Therefore,  the 
proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel Cmax to 75%-133% on the basis that 
clopidogrel belongs to a group of drugs with high variability was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP. 
Nevertheless,  since  the  confidence  intervals  for  Cmax  values  of  clopidogrel  were  within  the  required 
80%-125% range, the need for widening of the intervals was not applicable. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The  application  contains  adequate  review  of  clinical  data  published  in  the  literature  and  the 
bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore 
be concluded.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
User  testing  for  Clopidogrel  ratiopharm  75  mg  film-coated  tablets  was  conducted  with  adequate 
participants. The company that performed the user testing conducted the pilot phase with 2 participants 
before the first round of user testing. 
The questions prepared covered the main safety issues of PIL adequately. The methodology of user 
testing was suitable and results well documented. After two rounds of user testing the criteria for the 
satisfactory test outcome (90% of participants were able to find the requested information in PIL and 
90% of them understood it) were met. No further changes of the tested PIL were necessary. Based on 
the results in both rounds, no further testing is considered necessary. 
Therefore,  the  results  of  the  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet 
submitted by the Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in 
the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
The PIL submitted in the registration procedure EU/H/C/4006 is compliant with the PIL used in user 
testing and is identical in content. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate film-coated tablets. The 
reference product, Plavix 75 mg film-coated tablets, is indicated for: prevention of atherothrombotic 
events in:  
•  Adult  patients  suffering  from  myocardial  infarction  (from  a  few  days  until  less  than  35  days), 
ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.  
• Adult patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome:  
-  Non-ST  segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave  myocardial 
infarction),  including  patients  undergoing  a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).  
-  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction,  in  combination  with  ASA  in  medically  treated 
patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. 
and  
prevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation in: 
• Adult patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for vascular events, are  not 
suitable for treatment with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and who have a low bleeding risk, clopidogrel 
is  indicated  in  combination  with  ASA  for  the  prevention  of  atherothrombotic  and  thromboembolic 
events, including stroke. 
No  non-clinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this  application  but  an  adequate  summary  of  the 
available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
Bioequivalence of the two formulations (Clopidogrel ratiopharm and the reference product Plavix) was 
demonstrated.

The  application  contained  adequate  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data,  and  bioequivalence  was 
shown. Taking into account the Applicant’s responses to the questions throughout the procedure, CHMP 
considers that the benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
Also,  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required 
beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP consider by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Clopidogrel ratiopharm in the approved indications of: 
Prevention of atherothrombotic events in 
• Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic 
stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.  
• Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome:  
-  Non-ST  segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave  myocardial 
infarction),  including  patients  undergoing  a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).  
-  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction,  in  combination  with  ASA  in  medically  treated 
patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. 
and  
Prevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation in 
• Patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for vascular events, are not suitable for 
treatment with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and who have a low bleeding risk, clopidogrel is indicated 
in combination with ASA for the prevention of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic events, including 
stroke 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

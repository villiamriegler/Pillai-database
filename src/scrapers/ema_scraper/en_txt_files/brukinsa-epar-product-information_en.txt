BRUKINSA in combination with obinutuzumab  
Zanubrutinib must be administered orally before obinutuzumab infusion.  The recommended dose is 
obinutuzumab 1,000 mg intravenously on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of every 28-day 
cycle from Cycles 2 to 6. At the discretion of the physician, obinutuzumab may be administered 
100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2 of Cycle 1 instead of 1,000 mg on Day 1 of Cycle 1. 
Obinutuzumab maintenance (one infusion every two months for up to two years) may be prescribed. 
Refer to the obinutuzumab SmPC for additional dosing information, including premedication before 
each infusion.

A double dose should not be taken to make up for a forgotten dose. If a dose is not taken at the 
scheduled time, the next dose should be taken according to the normal schedule. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No specific dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥65 years). 
Renal impairment 
No dose modification is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCl) ≥30 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). There is limited data on patients with 
severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (n=12). Patients with severe renal impairment 
(CrCl <30 mL/min) or on dialysis should be monitored for adverse reactions (see section 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
Dose modifications are not needed in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class B). Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment were treated in 
BRUKINSA clinical studies. The recommended dose of BRUKINSA for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) is 80 mg orally twice daily. The safety of BRUKINSA has not been 
evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Monitor these patients closely for adverse 
events of BRUKINSA (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of BRUKINSA in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
BRUKINSA is for oral use. The hard capsules can be taken with or without food. Patients should be 
instructed to swallow the capsules whole with water, and not to open, break or chew the capsules.

4.3 
Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use  
Haemorrhage 
Serious and fatal haemorrhagic events have occurred in patients treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 3 or 
higher bleeding events including intracranial and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, haematuria and 
haemothorax have been reported in patients (see section 4.8). Bleeding events of any grade including 
purpura and petechiae occurred in patients with haematological malignancies. The mechanism for the 
bleeding events is not well understood.  
BRUKINSA may increase the risk of haemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant 
therapies and patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding. Dose modification may be necessary 
for Grade 3 or greater adverse reactions as recommended (see section 4.2). Warfarin or other 
vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with BRUKINSA. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding and monitor complete blood counts.  Consider the 
risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with BRUKINSA. 
Consider the benefit-risk of withholding zanubrutinib for 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending 
upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. 
Infections 
Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, fungal infections, or sepsis) and opportunistic 
infections (e.g., herpes viral, cryptococcal, aspergillus and pneumocystis jiroveci infections) have 
occurred in patients treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in patients (see 
section 4.8). The most common Grade 3 or higher infection was pneumonia. Infections due to 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have also occurred. Before initiating treatment with 
BRUKINSA, patients’ HBV status should be established. Consultation with a liver disease expert 
physician is recommended for patients who test positive for HBV or have positive hepatitis B 
serology, before initiating treatment. Patients should be monitored and managed according to the 
medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of 
care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.  
Cytopenia 
Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia based on laboratory 
measurements were reported in patients treated with BRUKINSA (see section 4.8). Monitor complete 
blood counts monthly during treatment (see section 4.2).  
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma have occurred in patients treated with 
BRUKINSA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma 
and squamous cell carcinoma of skin). Advise patients to use sun protection. 
Atrial fibrillation and flutter 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have occurred in patients treated with BRUKINSA, particularly in 
patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections and elderly (≥ 65 years). Monitor 
signs and symptoms for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and manage as appropriate.

Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with zanubrutinib monotherapy therapy, 
particularly in patients who were treated for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) Assess relevant 
risks (e.g., high tumour burden or blood uric acid level) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor 
patients closely and treat as appropriate.  
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception while taking 
BRUKINSA (see section 4.6). 
BRUKINSA contains sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A (CYP3A).  
Agents that may increase zanubrutinib plasma concentrations  
Concomitant use of BRUKINSA and medicinal products that strongly or moderately inhibit CYP3A 
can increase zanubrutinib exposure.  
Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
The coadministration of multiple doses of itraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) in healthy 
volunteers increased the Cmax of zanubrutinib by 2.6-fold and AUC by 3.8-fold. The coadministration 
of multiple doses of strong CYP3A inhibitors voriconazole and clarithromycin in patients with B-cell 
malignancies resulted in increased zanubrutinib exposures by 3.30-fold and 1.92-fold for dose-
normalized AUC0-24h and 3.29-fold and 2.01-fold for dose-normalized Cmax, respectively. 
If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be used (e.g., voriconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir), reduce the BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg (one 
capsule) for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor patient closely for toxicity and follow dose 
modification guidance as needed (see section 4.2). 
Moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
The coadministration of multiple doses of moderate CYP3A inhibitors fluconazole and diltiazem in 
patients with B-cell malignancies resulted in increased zanubrutinib exposures by 1.88-fold and 1.62-
fold for dose-normalized AUC0-24h and 1.81-fold and 1.62-fold for dose-normalized Cmax, respectively. 
If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, 
dronedarone, fluconazole, verapamil, aprepitant, imatinib, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges), reduce 
the BRUKINSA dose to 160 mg (two capsules) for the duration of the inhibitor use. Monitor patients 
closely for toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see section 4.2). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild CYP3A inhibitors 
Simulations using fasted conditions suggested that the mild CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine and 
fluvoxamine) may increase the AUC of zanubrutinib by <1.5-fold. No dose adjustment is required in 
combination with mild inhibitors. Monitor patients closely for toxicity and follow dose modification 
guidance as needed.  
Grapefruit and Seville oranges should be used with caution during BRUKINSA treatment, as these 
contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see section 4.2). 
Agents that may decrease zanubrutinib plasma concentrations 
Concomitant use of zanubrutinib and strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A can decrease 
zanubrutinib plasma concentrations. 
CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of multiple doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A inducer) decreased zanubrutinib Cmax 
by 92% and AUC by 93% in healthy subjects.  Co-administration of multiple doses of rifabutin 
(moderate CYP3A inducer) decreased zanubrutinib Cmax by 48% and AUC by 44% in healthy 
subjects. Mild CYP3A inducers may be used with caution during BRUKINSA treatment. 
Gastric acid reducing agents 
No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when 
co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists). 
Agents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by zanubrutinib 
Zanubrutinib is a mild inducer of CYP3A and CYP2C19. Concomitant use of zanubrutinib can 
decrease the plasma concentrations of these substrate medicinal products. 
CYP3A substrates 
Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased midazolam (CYP3A substrate) Cmax by 
30% and AUC by 47%. Narrow therapeutic index medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A 
(e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, 
sirolimus, and tacrolimus) should be used with caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the plasma 
exposures of these medicinal products. 
CYP2C19 substrates 
Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib decreased omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) Cmax 
by 20% and AUC by 36%. Narrow therapeutic index medicinal products that are metabolized by 
CYP2C19 (e.g., S-mephenytoin) should be used with caution, as zanubrutinib may decrease the 
plasma exposures of these medicinal products. 
Other CYP substrates 
No clinically significant differences were observed with S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) 
pharmacokinetics when co-administered with zanubrutinib.

Co-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors 
Co-administration of multiple doses of zanubrutinib increased digoxin (P-gp substrate) Cmax by 34% 
and AUC by 11%. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin 
(BCRP substrate) were observed when co-administered with zanubrutinib. 
The coadministration of oral P-gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin) should be 
done with caution as zanubrutinib may increase their concentrations. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA may cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant 
women (see section 5.3). Women should avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for 
up to 1 month after ending treatment. Therefore, women of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraceptive measures while taking BRUKINSA and for up to 1 month after stopping 
treatment. It is currently unknown whether zanubrutinib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method. 
Pregnancy testing is recommended for women of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy. 
Pregnancy 
BRUKINSA should not be used during pregnancy. There are no data from the use of BRUKINSA in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether zanubrutinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk and no non-
clinical studies were conducted. A risk to breast-fed children cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with BRUKINSA. 
Fertility 
No effect on male or female fertility was noted in rats but morphological abnormalities in sperm and 
increased post-implantation loss were noted at 300 mg/kg/day (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
BRUKINSA has no or negligible influence in the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, 
dizziness, and asthenia have been reported in some patients taking BRUKINSA and should be 
considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive or operate machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects

monotherapy. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile of zanubrutinib monotherapy is based on pooled data from 1550 patients with B-
cell malignancies, including patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (N = 938), Waldenström 
macroglobulinemia (N = 249), mantle cell lymphoma (N = 140), marginal zone lymphoma (N = 93), 
follicular lymphoma (N = 59) and other types of B-cell malignancies (N = 71), treated with 
BRUKINSA in clinical studies with a median duration of exposure of 34.41 months. 
The safety profile of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab is based on ROSEWOOD study 
data from 143 patients with FL treated with BRUKINSA in combination with obinutuzumab in two 
clinical studies with a median duration of exposure of 12.35 months. 
Adverse reactions in patients treated with BRUKINSA as monotherapy or in combination with 
obinutuzumab for B-cell malignancies are listed in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively, by system organ 
class and frequency grouping. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10), common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Elderly 
Of the 1550 patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy, 61.3% were 65 years of age or older. 
The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse events was slightly higher among elderly patients treated 
with zanubrutinib (69.6% of patients age ≥65 versus 62.7% of patients <65 years of age). No 
clinically relevant differences in safety were observed between patients ≥65 years and younger. 
Of the 143 patients treated with BRUKINSA in combination with obinutuzumab, 42.0% were 
65 years of age or older. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse events was slightly higher among 
elderly patients treated with zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab (70.0% of patients age 
≥65 versus 62.7% of patients <65 years of age). No clinically relevant differences in safety were 
observed between patients ≥65 years and younger. 
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of BRUKINSA in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not 
been established. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose  
There is no specific antidote for BRUKINSA. For patients who experience overdose, closely monitor 
and provide appropriate supportive treatment.

5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ATC code: 
L01EL03. 
Mechanism of action 
Zanubrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Zanubrutinib forms a covalent bond 
with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK activity. BTK is a 
signalling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, 
BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, 
chemotaxis, and adhesion.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
BTK occupancy in PBMCs and lymph node biopsies 
The median steady-state BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was maintained at 
100% over 24 hours at a total daily dose of 320 mg in patients with B-cell malignancies. The median 
steady-state BTK occupancy in lymph nodes was 94% to 100% following the recommended dose. 
Effect on QT/QTc interval and cardiac electrophysiology 
At the recommended doses (320 mg once daily or 160 mg twice daily), there were no clinically 
relevant effects on the QTc interval. At a single dose 1.5 times the maximum recommended dose 
(480 mg), zanubrutinib did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent (i.e., 
≥10 msec). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) 
The safety and efficacy of BRUKINSA in WM were evaluated in a randomized, open-label, 
multicentre study comparing zanubrutinib and ibrutinib (ASPEN study, BGB-3111-302) in patients 
who were BTK inhibitor naive.  Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age with a clinical and 
definite histological diagnosis of relapsed/refractory WM or treatment-naïve when considered 
unsuitable for standard chemo-immunotherapy regimens by their treating physician. Patients had to 
meet at least one criterion for treatment according to consensus panel criteria from the Seventh 
International Workshop on Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) and have measurable 
disease, as defined by a serum IgM level >0.5 g/dl. Patients with MYD88 mutation (MYD88MUT) 
were assigned to Cohort 1 (N=201) and were randomized 1:1 to receive either zanubrutinib 160 mg 
twice daily (Arm A) or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily (Arm B) until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. Subjects found to have MYD88 wildtype (MYD88WT) by gene sequencing (estimated to be 
present in approximately 10% of enrolled subjects), were enrolled to Cohort 2 (N = 28) and received 
zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily on a third, non-randomized, study arm (Arm C).  
In Cohort 1 (MYD88MUT), the median age was 70 years (range, 38 to 90 years), with 71% and 60% of 
patients treated with ibrutinib and zanubrutinib respectively being >65 years old. 33% of patients in 
the zanubrutinib arm and 22% in the ibrutinib were >75 years. 67% were male, and 91% were 
Caucasian. At study entry, 44% of patients in the ibrutinib arm and 46% of patients in the 
zanubrutinib arm had an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) high. One hundred and 
sixty-four patients had relapsed or refractory disease; the median number of prior therapies was 1 
(range, 1 to 8).  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary outcome measure was rate of Complete Response (CR) or Very Good Partial Response 
(VGPR), as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) with adaptation of the response 
criteria updated at the Sixth IWWM. The secondary endpoints for Cohort 1 include major response 
rate (MRR), duration of response, rate of CR or VGPR determined by investigator, and progression-
free survival (PFS).  
The testing for the superiority of the primary endpoint of VGPR or CR rate required testing in the 
Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set prior to testing in the ITT Analysis Set. Median follow-up was 
19.4 months. In the relapsed/refractory patients, 19.8% and 28.9% achieved VGPR or CR on the 
ibrutinib and zanubrutinib arms, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was not significant in the 
Relapsed/Refractory Analysis Set (2-sided p=0.1160). Table 5 summarizes the responses as assessed 
by IRC for the Relapsed/Refractory and intent-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set. Responses were observed 
with zanubrutinib across subgroups, including MYD88WT patients (Cohort 2) who had a VGPR or CR 
rate of 26.9% and an MRR of 50%.

Patients with Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) 
The efficacy of zanubrutinib was assessed in a Phase 2 open-label, multicentre, single-arm trial of 68 
patients with MZL who had received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy (MAGNOLIA study, 
BGB-3111-214). Twenty-six (38.2%) patients had extranodal MZL, 26 (38.2%) had nodal MZL, 12 
(17.6%) had splenic MZL, and in 4 (6%) patients, the subtype was unknown. Zanubrutinib was given 
orally at a dose of 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median 
age of patients was 70 years (range: 37 to 95), and 53% were male. The median time since initial 
diagnosis was 61.5 months (range: 2.0 to 353.6). The median number of prior treatments was 2 
(range: 1 to 6), with 27.9 % patients having 3 or more lines of systemic therapy; 98.5% (n=67) 
patients had received prior rituximab-based chemotherapy and 85.3% (n=58) patients had received 
prior treatment with alkylating agents; 5.9% patients (n=4) had prior stem cell transplantation. Sixty-
three (92.6%) patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.  Twenty-two (32.4%) 
patients had refractory disease at study entry.  
Tumor response was according to the 2014 Lugano Classification, and the primary efficacy endpoint 
was overall response rate as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) (Table 6).

In BGB-3111-214, the median time to response was 2.79 months (range: 1.7 to 11.1 months).  After a 
median study follow-up time of 28.04 months (range: 1.64 to 32.89 months), the median duration of 
response (DOR) as assessed by the IRC has not been reached (95% CI 25.0 months to NE), and a total 
of 72.9 % (95% CI 54.4 to 84.9) of responders were estimated to be event-free at 24 months after 
initial response.  
The  overall  response  rates  observed  were  similar  across  three  different  MZL  subtypes  (extranodal,

Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)  
The efficacy of BRUKINSA in patients with CLL was evaluated in two randomized controlled trials. 
SEQUOIA study (BGB-3111-304): An International, Phase 3, Open-label, Randomized Study of 
Zanubrutinib Compared with Bendamustine plus Rituximab (BR) in Patients with Previously 
Untreated CLL. 
15 
 
 
 
 
The SEQUOIA study (BGB-3111-304) is a randomized multicenter, open-label, active controlled 
Phase 3 trial of zanubrutinib monotherapy and bendamustine in combination with rituximab in 479 
patients with previously untreated CLL without 17p deletion (del(17p)) (arms A and B; Cohort 1).  
Arm C (Cohort 2) is a multicenter single-arm trial of zanubrutinib monotherapy in 110 patients with 
previously untreated CLL with centrally confirmed del(17p).   
Both Cohorts enrolled patients 65 years of age or older as well as patients between 18 and 65 years of 
age that were unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab 
(FCR). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arm A (zanubrutinib) and 
arm B (BR) of Cohort 1. In both arms, the median age was 70.0 years, with a slightly higher 
proportion of patients of ≥ 75 years (26.1%) in arm A compared with arm B (22.3%) and a slightly 
lower proportion of patients 65-75 years old (55.2%) in arm A compared with arm B (58.4%). In 
Cohort 1, 92.7% patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (93.7% in arm A and 
91.6% in arm B). In Cohort 2 (arm C zanubrutinib), 87.3% patients had a baseline ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were also generally similar between arm A (zanubrutinib) 
in Cohort 1 and arm C (zanubrutinib) in Cohort 2. 
In Cohort 1, randomisation was stratified by age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C versus A 
or B), immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutational status (mutated vs 
unmutated), and geographic region (North America versus Europe versus Asia Pacific).  A total of 
479 patients were randomized (intent-to-treat [ITT] analysis set), 241 to zanubrutinib continuous 
monotherapy and 238 to 6 cycles of therapy with bendamustine and rituximab (BR).  
In Cohort 1, patients in the zanubrutinib arm A received 160 mg twice daily until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. In arm B, patients received bendamustine at a dose of 90 mg/m2/day on the 
first 2 days of each cycle for 6 cycles and rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 for Cycle 1, and at a dose 
of 500 mg/m2 for Cycles 2 to 6. Each treatment cycle consisted of approximately 28 days. In Cohort 2 
(arm C), patients received zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
For Cohort 1, the primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by an independent 
central review committee (IRC). Secondary endpoints included the overall response rate based on IRC 
assessment. 
In Cohort 1, the median duration of follow-up for PFS was 25.0 months (range: 0.0 to 41.4). The PFS 
rate at 24 months was 85.5% (95% CI: 80.1, 89.6) for zanubrutinib and 69.5% (95% CI: 62.4, 75.5) 
for BR. In Cohort 2, the median duration of follow up for PFS was 27.9 months (range: 1.0 to 38.8) 
and the PFS rate at 24 months 88.9% (95% CI: 81.3, 93.6).   The ORR assessed by IRC in Cohort 2 
was 90.0% (95% CI: 82.8, 94.9). The median time to partial response or higher as assessed by IRC 
was 2.89 months (range: 1.8, 14.2) and 2.86 months (range: 1.9, 13.9) in the zanubrutinib arm of 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively.  
Efficacy results for cohort 1 is presented in Table 7: . The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS for both arms 
in Cohort 1 are shown in

descriptive P<0.0001) in the zanubrutinib arm over the BR arm. Median PFS was not reached with 
zanubrutinib arm and was 39.2 months for BR arm. At 36 months after randomization, 83.6% of 
patients treated with zanubrutinib and 55.1% with BR were estimated to be progression-free and alive. 
With a median follow-up of 35.8 months, the median OS was not reached for both arms; the 36-month

ALPINE study (BGB-3111-305): A Phase 3, Randomized Study of Zanubrutinib Compared with 
Ibrutinib in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) CLL  
The ALPINE study (BGB-3111-305) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3, active 
controlled trial. It enrolled 652 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL after at least one prior 
systemic therapy. The patients were randomized to either zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily or 
ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily, continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Randomization was stratified by age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), geographic region (China versus 
non-China), refractory status (yes or no), and del(17p)/TP53 mutation status (present or absent).  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms in 
ITT analysis set and in the first 415 randomized patients.  
In the ITT analysis set, the median age was 67.0 years in the zanubrutinib arm and 68.0 years in the 
ibrutinib arm. The majority of patients in both arms had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 (97.9% in the 
zanubrutinib arm; 96.0% in the ibrutinib arm).  Similar demographics and baseline characteristics 
were observed in the first 415 randomized patients. The median number of prior lines of systemic 
therapy is 1.0 the zanubrutinib arm (range, 1 to 6) and 1.0 in the ibrutinib arm (range, 1 to 8) in both 
the ITT analysis set and the first 415 randomized patients.  
Patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor were excluded from study 305 and limited data for 
zanubrutinib after prior BCL 2 inhibitor treatment is available.  
Of 652 patients total, 327 were assigned to zanubrutinib monotherapy, 325 to ibrutinib monotherapy. 
The efficacy evaluation is based on the pre-specified interim analysis of the first 415 randomized 
patients of the ITT population. Of these, 207 were randomized to zanubrutinib monotherapy, 208 to 
ibrutinib monotherapy. Efficacy results are presented in Table 8. 
18 
 
 
The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR, defined as partial response or better).  
At the pre-specified ORR interim analysis in the first 415 randomised patients, zanubrutinib 
demonstrated non-inferiority (1-sided p <0.0001) and superiority (2-sided p = 0.0006) to ibrutinib in 
the protocol-specified primary endpoint ORR assessed by investigator. Response as determined by 
IRC also demonstrated non-inferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib (1-sided p < 0.0001).  At the ORR 
final analysis, ORR assessed by the investigator continues to be higher (79.5% versus 71.1%) in the 
zanubrutinib arm compared with the ibrutinib arm (descriptive p = 0.0133); ORR determined by IRC 
was also significantly higher in the zanubrutinib arm compared with the ibrutinib arm, demonstrating 
superiority (80.4% versus 72.9%, respectively; 2-sided p = 0.0264).

Median duration of response as assessed by investigator was not reached in the zanubrutinib arm at interim analysis, median 
study follow-up time was 15.31 months (range: 0.1, 23.1) in zanubrutinib arm and 15.43 months (range: 0.1, 26.0) in

The median time to response as assessed by the investigator at the ORR interim analysis in first 415 
randomised patients was 5.59 months (range: 2.7, 14.1) in zanubrutinib arm and 5.65 months (range: 
2.8, 16.7) in ibrutinib arm. The results assessed by IRC were consistent (5.55 months vs. 5.63 months 
in zanubrutinib and ibrutinib arms respectively). At the ORR final analysis in all 652 randomised 
patients, the median time to response remained unchanged (5.59 months vs. 5.65 months as assessed 
by investigator and 5.52 months vs. 5.62 months as assessed by IRC in zanubrutinib and ibrutinib 
arms respectively).  
In patients with del(17p) mutation in the first 415 randomized patients, the ORR assessed by 
investigator were 83.3% (95% CI 62.5, 95.3; 20 of 24 patients) in the zanubrutinib arm and 53.8% 
(95% CI 33.4, 73.4; 14 of 26 patients) in the ibrutinib arm. Based on IRC assessment, the ORR were 
79.2% (95% CI 57.8, 92.9; 19 of 24 patients) in the zanubrutinib arm and 61.5% (95% CI 40.6, 79.8; 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 of 26 patients) in the ibrutinib arm. At the ORR final analysis in all 652 randomized patients, the 
ORR assessed by investigator were 86.7% (95% CI 73.2, 94.9; 39 of 45 patients with del(17p) 
mutation) in the zanubrutinib arm and 56.0% (95% CI 41.3, 70.0; 28 of 50 patients with del(17p) 
mutation) in the ibrutinib arm. Based on IRC assessment, the ORR were 86.7% (95% CI 73.2, 94.9; 
39 of 45 patients with del(17p) mutation) in the zanubrutinib arm and 64.0% (95% CI 49.2, 77.1; 32 
of 50 patients with del(17p) mutation) in the ibrutinib arm. 
A total of 652 patients were enrolled at the prespecified time of final PFS analysis (cut-off date 8 
August 2022). The median PFS follow-up time was 28.1 months as assessed by investigator and 30.7 
months as assessed by IRC Zanubrutinib showed superiority in PFS over ibrutinib as assessed by both 
investigator and IRC. The efficacy results for PFS are presented in Table 9, and a Kaplan Meier Plot 
as assessed by IRC is provided in Figure 2.

either arm with 17% of patients experiencing an event. 
Patients with Follicular Lymphoma (FL) 
The efficacy of zanubrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab was assessed in 
the ROSEWOOD study (BGB-3111-212), a phase 2 randomized, open-label, multicentre study. 
Overall, 217 patients with relapsed (defined by disease progression after completion of the most 
recent therapy) or refractory (defined as failure to achieve CR or PR to most recent therapy), grade 1-
3a follicular lymphoma (FL) who had previously received at least two prior systemic therapies 
including an anti-CD20 antibody and an appropriate alkylator-based combination therapy, were 
enrolled. Patients were randomized 2:1 to either zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily until 
progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, in combination with obinutuzumab 1000 mg 
intravenously (arm A) or obinutuzumab alone (arm B). Obinutuzumab was given on Day 1, 8, and 15 
of the first cycle, then at Day 1 of cycles 2-6. Each cycle was 28 days long. Patients received optional 
obinutuzumab maintenance, one infusion every other cycle, for a maximum of 20 doses. 
Patients randomized in obinutuzumab arm were allowed to crossover and to receive the combination 
of zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab in case of progressive disease or absence of response (defined by 
stable disease as best response) after 12 cycles. Randomization was stratified by the number of prior 
lines of therapy (2 to 3 versus ˃3), rituximab-refractory status (yes versus no), and geographic region 
(China versus other countries). 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced between the zanubrutinib 
combination arm and the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm in the 217 randomized patients. The 
21 
 
 
 
 
median age was 64 years (range: 31 to 88), 49.8% were male, and 64.1% White. Most (97.2%) of the 
patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 
At screening, most patients were Ann Arbor Stage III or IV (179 patients [82.5%]). Eighty-eight 
patients (40.6%) had bulky disease (defined as >1 baseline target lesion measuring >5 cm diameter). 
One hundred and twenty-three patients (56.7%) met the GELF criteria. 
The median number of prior anticancer therapy was 3 lines (range: 2 to 11 lines). All 217 patients 
received >2 prior lines of therapy that included rituximab therapy (as a monotherapy or in 
combination with chemotherapy), and 59 of the 217 patients (27.2%) received >3 prior lines of 
therapy.  Of the 217 patients, 114 (52.5%) were refractory to rituximab (defined as failure to respond 
to, or progression during, any previous rituximab-containing regimen [monotherapy or combined with 
chemotherapy], or progression within 6 months of the last rituximab dose, in the induction or 
maintenance treatment settings). Twelve (5.5%) patients received prior obinutuzumab. 
Of 217 patients total, 145 were randomized to the zanubrutinib combination arm and 72 were 
randomized to the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm. The median follow-up time on was 20.21 months 
in the zanubrutinib obinutuzumab combination arm and 20.40 months in the obinutuzumab 
monotherapy arm. Median duration of zanubrutinib exposure was 12.16 months. 
Of 72 patients randomized in the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm, 35 did crossover to combination 
therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate (defined partial response or complete 
response) as determined by independent central review using the Lugano Classification for NHL. 
Main secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 10 and Figure 4.

Overall Survival 
Twenty-nine patients (20.0%) in the combination arm and 22 patients (30.6%) in the obinutuzumab 
monotherapy arm died. At 18 months, overall survival rates were 84.6% (95% CI: 77.1, 89.8) in the 
combination arm and 73.5% (95% CI: 60.7, 82.7) in the obinutuzumab monotherapy arm. OS analysis 
may be confounded by 35 patients (48.6%) who crossed over from obinutuzumab monotherapy arm to 
combination arm. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
BRUKINSA in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma and for the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Zanubrutinib maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma drug concentration 
over time curve (AUC) increase proportionally over a dose range from 40 mg to 320 mg (0.13 to 
1 time the recommended total daily dose). Limited systemic accumulation of zanubrutinib was 
observed following repeated administration for one week. 
The geometric mean (%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state daily AUC is 2,099 (42%) ng h/mL following 
160 mg twice daily and 1,917 (59%) ng h/mL following 320 mg once daily. The geometric mean 
(%CV) zanubrutinib steady-state Cmax is 299 (56%) ng/mL following 160 mg twice daily and 533 
(55%) ng/mL following 320 mg once daily. 
Absorption 
The median tmax of zanubrutinib is 2 hours. No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib AUC 
or Cmax were observed following administration of a high-fat meal (approximately 1,000 calories with 
50% of total caloric content from fat) in healthy subjects. 
Distribution 
The geometric mean (%CV) apparent steady-state volume of distribution of zanubrutinib during the 
terminal phase (Vz/F) was 522 L (71%). The plasma protein binding of zanubrutinib is approximately 
94% and the blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.7-0.8.  
Metabolism 
Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450(CYP)3A.  
Elimination 
The mean half-life (t½) of zanubrutinib is approximately 2 to 4 hours following a single oral 
zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg or 320 mg. The geometric mean (%CV) apparent oral clearance (CL/F) 
of zanubrutinib during the terminal phase was 128 (61%) L/h. Following a single radiolabelled 
zanubrutinib dose of 320 mg to healthy subjects, approximately 87% of the dose was recovered in 
faeces (38% unchanged) and 8% in urine (less than 1% unchanged). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Age (19 to 90 years; mean age 65±12.5) had no clinically meaningful effect on zanubrutinib 
pharmacokinetics based on population PK analysis (N=1291). 
Paediatric population 
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with zanubrutinib in patients under 18 years of age. 
Gender 
Gender (872 males and 419 females) had no clinically meaningful effect on zanubrutinib 
pharmacokinetics based on population PK analysis.  
Race 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Race (964 White, 237 Asian, 30 Black, and 25 categorized as Other) had no clinically meaningful 
effect on zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics based on population PK analysis. 
Body weight 
Body weight (36 to 149 kg, mean weight 76.5±16.9 kg) had no clinically meaningful effect on 
zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics based on population PK analysis (N=1291). 
Renal impairment 
Zanubrutinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. Based on population PK analysis, mild and 
moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 mL/min as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault equation) had no 
influence on the exposure of zanubrutinib. The analysis was based on 362 patients with normal renal 
function, 523 with mild renal impairment, 303 with moderate renal impairment, 11 with severe renal 
impairment, and one with ESRD. The effects of severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) and 
dialysis on zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics is unknown.  
Hepatic impairment 
The total AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 11% in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh class A), by 21% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), and by 
60% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) relative to subjects with normal 
liver function. The unbound AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 23% in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class A), by 43% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
class B), and by 194% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) relative to 
subjects with normal liver function. A significant correlation was observed between the Child-Pugh 
score, baseline serum albumin, baseline serum bilirubin and baseline prothrombin time with unbound 
zanubrutinib AUC. 
In vitro studies 
CYP enzymes  
Zanubrutinib is a weak inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Zanubrutinib is not an inducer of CYP1A2.  
Co-administration with transport substrates/inhibitors 
Zanubrutinib is likely to be a substrate of P-gp. Zanubrutinib is not a substrate or inhibitor of OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
An in vitro study showed that the potential pharmacodynamic interaction between zanubrutinib and 
rituximab is low and zanubrutinib is unlikely to interfere with the anti-CD20 antibody-induced 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect. 
In vitro, ex vivo, and animal studies showed that zanubrutinib had no or minimal effects on platelet 
activation, glycoprotein expression, and thrombus formation.

5.3  Preclinical safety data  
General toxicity 
The general toxicologic profiles of zanubrutinib were characterized orally in Sprague-Dawley rats for 
up to 6-month treatment and in beagle dogs for up to 9-month treatment. 
In rat repeat dose studies up to 6-month treatment, test article related mortality was noted at the dose 
of 1,000 mg/kg/day (81x clinical AUC) with histopathologic findings in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Other findings were mainly noted in the pancreas (atrophy, fibroplasia, haemorrhage, and/or 
inflammatory cell infiltration) at the doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (3x clinical AUC), in the skin around the 
nose/mouth/eyes (inflammatory cell infiltration, erosion/ulcer) from the dose of 300 mg/kg/day (16x 
clinical AUC), and in the lung (presence of macrophages in the alveolar) at the dose of 
300 mg/kg/day. All these findings were fully or partially reversed after a 6-week recovery except for 
the pancreatic findings which were not considered clinically relevant.  
In dog repeat dose studies up to 9-month treatment, test article related findings were mainly noted in 
the gastrointestinal tract (soft/watery/mucoid stool), skin (rash, red discoloration, and thickened/ 
scaling), and in the mesenteric, mandibular, and gut associated lymph nodes and spleen (lymphoid 
depletion or erythrophagocytosis) at the doses from 10 mg/kg/day (3x clinical AUC) to 
100 mg/kg/day (18x clinical AUC). All these findings were fully or partially reversed after a 6-week 
recovery. 
Carcinogenicity/genotoxicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with zanubrutinib.  
Zanubrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, nor was it clastogenic in 
an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity 
A combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in rats 
at oral zanubrutinib doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day. No effect on male or female fertility was 
noted but at the highest dose tested, morphological abnormalities in sperm and increased post-
implantation loss were noted. The dose of 100 mg/kg/day is approximately 13-fold higher than the 
human therapeutic exposure. 
Embryo-foetal development toxicity studies were conducted in both rats and rabbits. Zanubrutinib 
was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30, 75, and 
150 mg/kg/day. Malformations in the heart (2- or 3-chambered hearts with the incidence of 
0.3%-1.5%) were noted at all dose levels in the absence of maternal toxicity. The dose of 
30 mg/kg/day is approximately 5-fold higher than the human therapeutic exposure.  
Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at 30, 70, and 
150 mg/kg/day resulted in post-implantation loss at the highest dose. The dose of 70 mg/kg is 
approximately 25-fold higher than the human therapeutic exposure and was associated with 
maternal toxicity. 
In a pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study, zanubrutinib was administered orally to rats at 
doses of 30, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day from implantation through weaning. The offspring from the 
middle and high dose groups had decreased body weights preweaning, and all dose groups had 
adverse ocular findings (e.g., cataract, protruding eye). The dose of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 
5-fold higher than the human therapeutic exposure.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What BRUKINSA is and what it is used for 
BRUKINSA is an anticancer medicine that contains the active substance zanubrutinib. It belongs to a 
class of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors. This medicine works by blocking Bruton's tyrosine 
kinase, a protein in the body that helps cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking this protein, 
BRUKINSA reduces the number of cancer cells and slows down the worsening of the cancer. 
BRUKINSA is used to treat Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (also known as lymphoplasmacytic 
lymphoma), a cancer affecting a type of white blood cells called B lymphocytes or B cells that make 
too much of a protein called IgM. This medicine is used when the disease has come back, or treatment 
has not worked or in patients who cannot have chemotherapy together with an antibody. 
BRUKINSA is also used to treat marginal zone lymphoma. This is a type of cancer that also affects B 
lymphocytes or B cells. In marginal zone lymphoma, the abnormal B cells multiply too quickly and 
live for too long. This may cause enlargement of organs that are part of body’s natural defences such 
as lymph node and spleen. The abnormal B cells may also affect various organs, such as stomach, 
salivary gland, thyroid, eyes, lungs, bone marrow and blood. Patients may have fever, weight loss, 
tiredness and night sweats, but also symptoms that depend on where the lymphoma develop. This 
medicine is used when the disease has come back, or treatment has not worked.  
BRUKINSA is also used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), another type of cancer 
affecting B cells that involves the lymph nodes. This medicine is used in patients who have not 
previously been treated for CLL or when the disease has come back or has not responded to previous 
treatment. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BRUKINSA is also used to treat follicular lymphoma (FL). FL is a slow growing cancer that affects 
the B lymphocytes. When you have FL, you have too many of these B lymphocytes in your lymph 
nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. BRUKINSA is taken together with another medicine called 
‘obinutuzumab’ when the disease has come back or when previously used medicines have not been 
effective. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take BRUKINSA  
Do not take BRUKINSA  
- 
if you are allergic to zanubrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking BRUKINSA: 
• 
if you have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines or supplements that 
increase your risk of bleeding (see section “Other medicines and BRUKINSA”). If you have 
had recent surgery or plan to have surgery, your doctor may ask you to stop taking 
BRUKINSA for a short time (3 to 7 days) before and after your surgery or dental procedure 
if you have an irregular heartbeat or have a history of irregular heartbeat or severe heart 
failure, or if you have any of the following: shortness of breath, weakness, dizziness, light-
headedness, fainting or near fainting, chest pain or swollen legs 
if you have ever been advised that you are at higher risk of infections. You may experience 
viral, bacterial, or fungal infections during treatment with BRUKINSA with the following 
possible symptoms: fever, chills, weakness, confusion, body aches, cold or flu symptoms, feel 
tired or feel short of breath, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). 
if you have ever had or might have hepatitis B. This is because BRUKINSA could cause 
hepatitis B to become active again. Patients will be carefully checked by their doctor for signs 
of this infection before treatment is started 
if you have liver or kidney problems 
if you have recently had any surgery, especially if it might affect how you absorb food or 
medicines from your stomach or gut 
if you recently had low counts of red blood cells, infection-fighting cells or platelets in your 
blood 
if you had other carcinomas in the past including skin cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma or 
squamous cell carcinoma). Please use sun protection 
•

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
taking this medicine. 
Tests and check-ups before and during treatment  
Laboratory tests may show lymphocytosis, an increase in white blood cells (lymphocytes) in your 
blood in the first few weeks of treatment. This is expected and may last for a few months. This does 
not necessarily mean that your blood cancer is getting worse. Your doctor will check your blood 
counts before and during the treatment and in rare cases the doctor may give you another medicine. 
Talk to your doctor about what your test results mean. 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS): Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by the fast 
breakdown of cancer cells have occurred during treatment of cancer and sometimes even without 
treatment. This may lead to changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. Your doctor 
or another healthcare provider may do blood tests to check for TLS. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
BRUKINSA should not be used in children and adolescents, because it is unlikely to work.  
Other medicines and BRUKINSA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, herbal medicines and 
supplements. This is because BRUKINSA may affect the way some medicines work. Also, some 
medicines can affect the way BRUKINSA works. 
BRUKINSA may make you bleed more easily. This means you should tell your doctor if you take 
other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding. This includes medicines such as: 
• 
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as 
ibuprofen and naproxen, 
anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin and other medicines for treating or preventing blood 
clots, 
supplements that may increase your risk of bleeding such as fish oil, vitamin E or flaxseed. 
• 
•

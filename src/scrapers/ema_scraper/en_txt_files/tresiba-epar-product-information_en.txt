CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children from the age of 1 year. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
This medicinal product is a basal insulin for once-daily subcutaneous administration at any time of the 
day, preferably at the same time every day. 
The potency of insulin analogues, including insulin degludec, is expressed in units. One (1) unit of 
insulin degludec corresponds to 1 international unit of human insulin, 1 unit of insulin glargine 
(100 units/mL), or 1 unit of insulin detemir. 
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, this medicinal product can be administered alone or in any 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combination with oral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists and bolus insulin (see 
section 5.1). 
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must be combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin to cover 
mealtime insulin requirements. 
Tresiba is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. It is recommended to optimise 
glycaemic control via dose adjustment based on fasting plasma glucose. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. 
Tresiba 100 units/mL and Tresiba 200 units/mL solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
Tresiba is available in two strengths. For both, the needed dose is dialled in units. The dose steps, 
however, differ between the two strengths of the medicinal product.  
• 
With Tresiba 100 units/mL a dose of 1–80 units per injection, in steps of 1 unit, can be 
administered. 
With Tresiba 200 units/mL a dose of 2–160 units per injection, in steps of 2 units, can be 
administered. The dose is provided in half the volume of 100 units/mL basal insulin products. 
The dose counter shows the number of units regardless of strength and no dose conversion should be 
done when transferring a patient to a new strength. 
• 
Flexibility in dosing time 
On occasions when administration at the same time of the day is not possible, Tresiba allows for 
flexibility in the timing of insulin administration (see section 5.1). A minimum of 8 hours between 
injections should always be ensured. There is no clinical experience with flexibility in dosing time of 
Tresiba in children and adolescents. 
Patients who forget a dose are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily 
dosing schedule. 
Initiation 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
The recommended daily starting dose is 10 units followed by individual dosage adjustments. 
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
Tresiba is to be used once daily with mealtime insulin and requires subsequent individual dosage 
adjustments. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks. Doses and 
timing of concurrent rapid-acting or short-acting insulin products or other concomitant antidiabetic 
treatment may need to be adjusted. 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
For patients with type 2 diabetes taking once-daily basal, basal-bolus, premix or self-mixed insulin 
therapy, changing the basal insulin to Tresiba can be done unit-to-unit based on the previous basal 
insulin dose followed by individual dosage adjustments. 
A dose reduction of 20% based on the previous basal insulin dose followed by individual dosage 
adjustments should be considered when  
- transferring to Tresiba from twice-daily basal insulin 
- transferring to Tresiba from insulin glargine (300 units/mL) 
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
For patients with type 1 diabetes a dose reduction of 20% based on the previous basal insulin dose or 
basal component of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion regimen should be considered with 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subsequent individual dosage adjustments based on the glycaemic response. 
Use of Tresiba in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
When adding Tresiba to GLP-1 receptor agonists, the recommended daily starting dose is 10 units 
followed by individual dosage adjustments. 
When adding GLP-1 receptor agonists to Tresiba, it is recommended to reduce the dose of Tresiba by 
20% to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Subsequently, dosage should be adjusted individually. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years old)  
Tresiba can be used in elderly. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on 
an individual basis (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Tresiba can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and 
the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no clinical experience with the use of this medicinal product in children below the age of 
1 year. This medicinal product can be used in adolescents and children from the age of 1 year (see 
section 5.1). When changing basal insulin to Tresiba, dose reduction of basal and bolus insulin needs 
to be considered on an individual basis in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 
4.4). 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use only. 
Tresiba must not be administered intravenously as it may result in severe hypoglycaemia.  
This medicinal product must not be administered intramuscularly as it may change the absorption.  
This medicinal product must not be used in insulin infusion pumps. 
Tresiba must not be drawn from the cartridge of the pre-filled pen into a syringe (see section 4.4). 
Tresiba is administered subcutaneously by injection in the thigh, the upper arm or the abdominal wall. 
Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of 
lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Patients should be instructed to always use a new needle. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases 
the risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, 
patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for use accompanying the package 
leaflet (see section 6.6). 
Tresiba 100 units/mL and Tresiba 200 units/mL solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
Tresiba comes in a pre-filled pen (FlexTouch) designed to be used with NovoFine or NovoTwist 
injection needles.  
– 
– 
The 100 units/mL pre-filled pen delivers 1–80 units in steps of 1 unit. 
The 200 units/mL pre-filled pen delivers 2–160 units in steps of 2 units. 
Tresiba 100 units/mL solution for injection in a cartridge 
Tresiba comes in a cartridge (Penfill) designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems 
and NovoFine or NovoTwist injection needles. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see 
sections 4.5, 4.8 and 4.9). 
In children, care should be taken to match insulin doses (especially in basal-bolus regimens) with food 
intake and physical activities in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved (e.g. by intensified insulin therapy) may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and must be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with long-standing diabetes. 
Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin 
requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose. 
As with other basal insulin products, the prolonged effect of Tresiba may delay recovery from 
hypoglycaemia. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Administration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. 
Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to 
hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially 
infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement. 
Usually, the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop gradually over a period of hours or days. They 
include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry 
mouth, and loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, untreated 
hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is potentially lethal. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Transferring a patient to another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin must be done under medical 
supervision and may result in the need for a change in dosage. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia.  
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site from an affected to an 
unaffected area, and dose adjustment of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Combination of pioglitazone and insulin medicinal products 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac failure. This should be kept in mind 
if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Tresiba is considered. If the combination is 
used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Eye disorder 
Intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated 
with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control 
decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
Avoidance of medication errors 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between the two different strengths of Tresiba as well as other insulin products.  
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. 
To avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, patients and healthcare professionals should never use 
a syringe to draw the medicinal product from the cartridge in the pre-filled pen. 
In the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for 
use accompanying the package leaflet (see section 6.6). 
Insulin antibodies 
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin 
antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism. 
The following substances may reduce the insulin requirement 
Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOI), beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids 
and sulfonamides. 
The following substances may increase the insulin requirement 
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
The use of Tresiba in pregnant women with diabetes has been investigated in an interventional trial 
(see section 5.1). A moderate amount of clinical trial and post-marketing data in pregnant women 
(more than 400 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity. Animal 
reproduction studies have not revealed any difference between insulin degludec and human insulin 
regarding embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. 
The treatment with Tresiba may be considered during pregnancy, if clinically needed. 
In general, intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually 
decrease in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and third trimesters. After 
delivery, insulin requirements usually return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. Careful monitoring of 
glucose control is recommended and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Breast-feeding 
There is no clinical experience with Tresiba during breast-feeding. In rats, insulin degludec was 
secreted in milk; the concentration in milk was lower than in plasma. 
It is unknown whether insulin degludec is excreted in human milk. No metabolic effects are 
anticipated in the breast-fed newborn/infant. 
Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies with insulin degludec have not revealed any adverse effects on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
This medicinal product has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, the patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. 
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a 
car or using machines). 
Patients must be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is particularly 
important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or 
have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these 
circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia (see section 
‘Description of selected adverse reactions’ below). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
With insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either 
insulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening. 
With Tresiba, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, 
tiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe 
hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or 
permanent impairment of brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur 
suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, 
unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, 
vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, 
swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with 
Tresiba. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued 
treatment. 
Paediatric population 
Tresiba has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation 
of pharmacokinetic properties (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in a long 
term trial in children aged 1 to less than 18 years. The frequency, type and severity of adverse 
reactions in the paediatric population do not indicate differences to the experience in the general 
diabetes population (see section 5.1). 
Other special populations 
Based on results from clinical trials, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions observed in 
elderly and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment do not indicate any differences to the broader 
experience in the general population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined. However, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if a patient is dosed with more insulin than required: 
• 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or other products 
containing sugar. It is therefore recommended that the patient always carries glucose-containing 
products. 
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient is not able to treat himself, can be treated 
with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or 
with glucose given intravenously by a healthcare professional. Glucose must be given 
intravenously if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon 
regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in 
order to prevent a relapse.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. 
ATC code: A10AE06.  
Mechanism of action 
Insulin degludec binds specifically to the human insulin receptor and results in the same 
pharmacological effects as human insulin. 
The blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following the 
binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose 
output from the liver. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Tresiba is a basal insulin that forms soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection, resulting in 
a depot from which insulin degludec is continuously and slowly absorbed into the circulation leading 
to a flat and stable glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba (see figure 1). During a period of 24 hours with 
once-daily treatment, the glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba, in contrast to insulin glargine, was evenly 
distributed between the first and second 12 hours (AUCGIR,0-12h,SS/AUCGIR,total,SS = 0.5). 
Figure 1 Glucose infusion rate profile, smoothed, steady state - Mean profile 0-24 hours - IDeg 
100 units/mL 0.6 units/kg - Trial 1987 
The duration of action of Tresiba is beyond 42 hours within the therapeutic dose range.  
Steady state will occur after 2–3 days of dose administration. 
The day-to-day variability, expressed as the coefficient of variation, in glucose-lowering effect during 
one dosing interval of 0-24 hours at steady state (AUCGIR,τ,SS) is 20% for insulin degludec, which is 
significantly lower  than for insulin glargine (100 units/mL). 
The total glucose-lowering effect of Tresiba increases linearly with increasing doses. 
The total glucose-lowering effect is comparable for Tresiba 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL after 
administration of the same doses of the two products. 
There is no clinically relevant difference in the pharmacodynamics of this medicinal product between 
elderly and younger adult patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
11 multinational clinical trials of 26 or 52 weeks’ duration were conducted as controlled, open-label, 
randomised, parallel, treat-to-target trials exposing 4,275 patients to Tresiba (1,102 in type 1 diabetes 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mellitus and 3,173 in type 2 diabetes mellitus).  
In the open-label trials the effect of Tresiba was tested in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (Table 
2), in insulin naïve patients (insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Table 3) and in previous 
insulin users (insulin intensification in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Table 4) with fixed as well as flexible 
dosing time (Table 5), and the reduction in HbA1c from baseline to end of trial was confirmed to be 
non-inferior in all trials against all comparators (insulin detemir and insulin glargine (100 units/mL)). 
While improvements in HbA1c were non-inferior compared to other insulin products, against sitagliptin 
Tresiba was statistically significantly superior in reducing HbA1c (Table 4).  
In a prospectively planned meta-analysis across seven open-label treat-to-target confirmatory trials in 
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba was superior in terms of a lower number of 
treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes (driven by a benefit in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, see Table 1) and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes compared to insulin glargine 
(100 units/ml) (administered according to label). The reduction in hypoglycaemia was achieved at a 
lower average FPG level with Tresiba than with insulin glargine.

In a 104-week clinical trial, 57% of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with Tresiba (insulin 
degludec) in combination with metformin achieved a target HbA1c <7.0%, and the remaining patients 
continued in a 26-week open-label trial and were randomised to add liraglutide or a single dose of 
insulin aspart (with the largest meal). In the insulin degludec + liraglutide arm, the insulin dose was 
reduced by 20% in order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Addition of liraglutide resulted in a 
statistically significantly greater reduction of HbA1c (-0.73% for liraglutide vs -0.40% for comparator, 
estimated means) and body weight (-3.03 vs 0.72 kg, estimated means). The rate of hypoglycaemic 
episodes (per patient year of exposure) was statistically significantly lower when adding liraglutide 
compared to adding a single dose of insulin aspart (1.0 vs 8.15; ratio: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21). 
Furthermore, two 64-week controlled, double-blind, randomised, cross-over, treat-to-target trials were 
conducted in patients with at least one risk factor for hypoglycaemia and with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(501 patients) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (721 patients). Patients were randomised to either Tresiba or 
insulin glargine (100 units/mL) followed by cross-over. The trials evaluated the rate of hypoglycaemia 
upon treatment with Tresiba compared to insulin glargine (100 units/mL) (see Table 6).

Cardiovascular evaluation 
DEVOTE was a randomised, double-blind, and event-driven clinical trial with a median duration of 2 
years comparing the cardiovascular safety of Tresiba versus insulin glargine (100 units/mL) in 7,637 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk of cardiovascular events.  
The primary analysis was time from randomisation to first occurrence of a 3-component major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or 
non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial to exclude a pre-specified risk margin 
of 1.3 for the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE comparing Tresiba to insulin glargine. The cardiovascular 
safety of Tresiba as compared to insulin glargine was confirmed (HR 0.91 [0.78; 1.06]) (Figure 2).  
Results from subgroup analyses (e.g. sex, diabetes duration, CV risk group and previous insulin 
regimen) was aligned with the primary analysis. 
N: Number of subjects with a first EAC confirmed event during trial. %: Percentage of subjects with a first EAC confirmed event relative to 
the number of randomised subjects. EAC: Event adjudication committee. CV: Cardiovascular. MI: Myocardial infarction. CI: 95% 
confidence interval. 
Figure 2 Forest plot of analysis of the composite 3-point MACE and individual cardiovascular 
endpoints in DEVOTE 
At baseline, HbA1c was 8.4% in both treatment groups and after 2 years HbA1c was 7.5% both with 
Tresiba and insulin glargine. 
Tresiba was superior compared to insulin glargine in terms of a lower rate of severe hypoglycaemic 
events and a lower proportion of subjects experiencing severe hypoglycaemia. The rate of nocturnal 
severe hypoglycaemia was significantly lower for Tresiba compared to insulin glargine (Table 7).

Pregnancy 
Tresiba has been studied in an open-label, randomised, active controlled clinical trial, in which 
pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were treated within a basal-bolus treatment regimen 
with Tresiba (92 women) or insulin detemir (96 women) as basal insulin, both in combination with 
insulin aspart as meal time insulin (EXPECT). 
Tresiba was non-inferior to insulin detemir as measured by HbA1c at last planned HbA1c visit prior to 
delivery after gestational week 16. Moreover, no difference between treatment groups was observed 
for glycaemic control (change in HbA1c, FPG and PPG) during pregnancy. 
No clinically relevant differences were observed between Tresiba and insulin detemir for the maternal 
safety endpoints: hypoglycaemia, pre-term delivery and adverse events during the pregnancy. Pre-
eclampsia was reported in 12 subjects treated with Tresiba (13.2%) and in 7 subjects (7.4%) who were 
treated with insulin detemir. Non-planned caesarean section was reported in 23 subjects (25.3%) 
treated with Tresiba and in 15 subjects (16.0%) treated with insulin detemir. The majority of the 
adverse events reported in both groups were non-serious, mild in severity, unlikely related to the trial 
product and had the outcome “recovered/resolved”. No deaths were reported in the subjects who were 
randomised in the trial. 
No perinatal or neonatal death was reported. No clinically relevant differences were observed between 
Tresiba and insulin detemir for the pregnancy endpoints (early foetal death, presence of major 
abnormalities, neonatal hypoglycaemia, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, foetal macrosomia, 
large for gestational age, and adverse events in the infant during the 30 days after birth). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of trials with Tresiba 
in: 
• 
Neonates and infants from birth to less than 12 months of age with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 
children from birth to less than 10 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus on the grounds that 
the disease or condition for which the specific medicinal product is intended does not occur in 
the specified paediatric subset (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The efficacy and safety of Tresiba have been studied in a 1:1 randomised controlled clinical trial in 
children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus for a period of 26 weeks (n=350), followed by a 
26-week extension period (n=280). Patients in the Tresiba arm included 43 children aged 1–5 years, 
70 children aged 6–11 years and 61 adolescents aged 12–17 years. Tresiba dosed once daily showed 
similar reduction in HbA1c at week 52 and greater reduction in FPG from baseline versus the 
comparator insulin detemir dosed once or twice daily. This was achieved with 30% lower daily doses 
of Tresiba compared to insulin detemir. The rates (events per patient-year of exposure) of severe 
hypoglycaemia (ISPAD definition; 0.51 vs 0.33), confirmed hypoglycaemia (57.71 vs 54.05) and 
nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia (6.03 vs 7.60) were comparable with Tresiba versus insulin 
detemir. In both treatment arms, children aged 6-11 years had a numerically higher rate of confirmed 
hypoglycaemia than in the other age groups. A numerically higher rate of severe hypoglycaemia in 
children aged 6-11 years in the Tresiba arm was observed. The rate of hyperglycaemic episodes with 
ketosis was significantly lower for Tresiba versus insulin detemir, 0.68 and 1.09, respectively. No 
safety issues were identified with Tresiba with respect to adverse events and standard safety 
parameters. Antibody development was sparse and had no clinical impact. Efficacy and safety data for 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been extrapolated from data for adolescent and 
adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results 
support the use of Tresiba in adolescent patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous injection, soluble and stable multi-hexamers are formed creating a depot of insulin 
in the subcutaneous tissue. Insulin degludec monomers gradually separate from the multi-hexamers 
thus resulting in a slow and continuous delivery of insulin degludec into the circulation. 
Steady-state serum concentration is reached after 2–3 days of daily Tresiba administration. 
During a period of 24 hours with once-daily treatment, the exposure of insulin degludec was evenly 
distributed between the first and second 12 hours. The ratio between AUCIDeg,0-12h,SS and AUCIDeg,τ,SS 
was 0.5. 
Distribution 
The affinity of insulin degludec to serum albumin corresponds to a plasma protein binding of >99% in 
human plasma. 
Biotransformation 
Degradation of insulin degludec is similar to that of human insulin; all metabolites formed are 
inactive. 
Elimination 
The half-life after subcutaneous administration of Tresiba is determined by the rate of absorption from 
the subcutaneous tissue. The half-life of Tresiba is approximately 25 hours independent of dose. 
Linearity 
Dose proportionality in total exposure is observed after subcutaneous administration within the 
therapeutic dose range. In direct comparison, requirements for bioequivalence are met for Tresiba 
100 units/mL and Tresiba 200 units/mL (based on AUCIDeg,τ,SS and Cmax,IDeg,SS). 
Gender 
There is no gender difference in the pharmacokinetic properties of this medicinal product. 
Elderly, race, renal and hepatic impairment 
There is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec between elderly and younger adult 
patients, between races or between healthy subjects and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic properties of insulin degludec in children (1-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) 
were at steady state comparable to those observed in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Total 
exposure after a single dose was, however, higher in children and adolescents than in adults with type 
1 diabetes mellitus. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no safety concerns for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction. 
The ratio of mitogenic relative to metabolic potency for insulin degludec is comparable to that of 
human insulin.

D.  CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities 
and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2. of the marketing 
authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
– 
–  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall provide an educational pack prior to launch targeting all physicians and nurses who 
are expected to be involved in the treatment and management of diabetic patients and all pharmacists 
who are expected to dispense Tresiba.  
The educational pack is aimed at increasing awareness about the introduction of a new strength of 
insulin in the European market and describing key differences in the design of the packages and the 
pre-filled pen devices to minimise the risk of medication errors and mix up between the two different 
strengths of Tresiba. 
The educational pack should contain: 
– 
– 
– 
– 
Direct Healthcare Professional Communication letter as described below;  
Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet; 
Poster for display in pharmacies/diabetic units; 
Patient Brochures. 
The MAH shall ensure that healthcare professionals are informed that all patients who have been 
prescribed Tresiba should be provided with a patient brochure and be trained on the correct use of the 
pre-filled pen before prescribing or dispensing Tresiba. 
That Tresiba is available in 2 strengths; 
Key differences in the design of the packages and the pre-filled pen devices; 
The Poster for pharmacies/diabetic units shall contain the following key elements: 
– 
– 
–  When prescribing to make sure that the correct strength is mentioned in the prescription slip; 
– 
Always check the insulin label before dispensing to make sure the correct strength is delivered 
to the patient; 
Always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between the 
two different strengths of Tresiba; 
Do not use outside of the pre-filled pen device (e.g. syringes); 
Reporting of medication errors or any side effects. 
– 
– 
– 
The patient brochure shall contain the following key elements: 
– 
– 
– 
That Tresiba is available in 2 strengths; 
Key differences in the design of the packages and the pre-filled pen devices; 
Always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between the 
two different strengths of Tresiba; 
Patients who are blind or have poor vision must be instructed always to get help/assistance from 
another person who has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device; 
Always use the dose recommended by your healthcare provider;  
– 
– 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
– 
– 
– 
Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to select the dose. Do not count the pen clicks 
to select the dose; 
Check how many units were selected before injecting the insulin; 
The dose counter shows the number of units regardless of strength and no dose conversion 
should be done; 
Reporting of medication errors or any side effects. 
The MAH shall agree on the final text of the Direct Healthcare Professional Communication letter and 
the content of the patient brochure together with a communication plan, with the National Competent 
Authority in each Member State prior to distribution of the educational pack in the Member State.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tresiba is and what it is used for 
Tresiba is a long-acting basal insulin called insulin degludec. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. Tresiba helps your body reduce your blood 
sugar level. It is used for once-daily dosing. On occasions when you cannot follow your regular dosing 
schedule, you can change the time of dosing because Tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect 
(see section 3 for ‘Flexibility in dosing time’). Tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting 
insulin products. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin.  
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid-acting 
insulin medicines. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Tresiba 
Do not use Tresiba 
• 
if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tresiba. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4. 
Switching from other insulin medicines – the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch 
from another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. Talk to your doctor. 
Pioglitazone used together with insulin, see ‘Pioglitazone’ below. 
Eye disorder – fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder. If you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between different strengths of Tresiba as well as other insulin 
products. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Tresiba’). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Tresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. There is no experience with 
the use of Tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Tresiba 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be 
changed. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) 
• 
sulfonamides, for infections 
• 
anabolic steroids, such as testosterone 
• 
beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs 
• 
of too low blood sugar (see section 4 ‘Warning signs of too low blood sugar’) 
acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, for depression 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood 
pressure. 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol, for endometriosis 
oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems 
growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency 
glucocorticoids such as ‘cortisone’, for inflammation 
sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma 
thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). 
Octreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Pioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with 
long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with 
pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor immediately 
if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Tresiba with alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. 
You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be 
changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. 
Avoiding too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Having too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If 
your blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This 
could be dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: 
• 
• 
you often get too low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Tresiba 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Tresiba  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure. 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen 
without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch pre-filled 
pen. 
Tresiba in a pre-filled pen is available in two strengths. “Tresiba 100 units/mL” or “Tresiba 
200 units/mL” is clearly marked on the pen label and packaging. In addition, Tresiba 100 units/mL 
packaging and label are light green, and Tresiba 200 units/mL packaging and label are dark green with 
striping with a red box highlighting the formulation strength. 
For both strengths, the needed dose is dialled in units. The dose steps, however, differ between the two 
strengths of Tresiba. 
The pre-filled pen 100 units/mL can provide a dose of 1–80 units in one injection in steps of 1 unit. 
The dose counter of the pre-filled pen shows the number of units of insulin to be injected. Do not 
make any dose re-calculation.  
Your doctor will decide together with you:  
• 
• 
how much Tresiba you will need each day 
when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. 
Flexibility in dosing time 
• 
• 
• 
Always follow your doctor’s recommendation for dose. 
Use Tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. 
On occasions when it is not possible to take Tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken 
at a different time of day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. There is 
no experience with flexibility in dosing time of Tresiba in children and adolescents. 
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a 
change in diet may alter your need for insulin. 
• 
Based on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. 
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  
Use in elderly (≥65 years old) 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level 
more often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
If you have kidney or liver problems 
If you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
Injecting your medicine  
Before you use Tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled 
pen. 
• 
Check the name and strength on the label of the pen to make sure it is Tresiba 100 units/mL. 
Do not use Tresiba  
• 
• 
• 
in insulin infusion pumps. 
if the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5). 
if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. 
How to inject 
• 
Tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject it into a 
vein or muscle. 
The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist 
(abdomen). 
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
lumps and skin pitting (see section 4). 
Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked 
needles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. 
Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential 
overdose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Detailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet. 
If you use more Tresiba than you should 
If you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 
4 ‘Too low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Tresiba 
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of 
8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your 
next regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. 
If you stop using Tresiba 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin, this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), 
see advice in section 4 ‘Too high blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Hypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect 
more than 1 in 10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much, you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See advice in ‘Too low blood sugar’ below. 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in Tresiba, 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stop using this medicine and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the local reactions spread to other parts of your body 
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating 
you start being sick (vomiting) 
you experience difficulty in breathing 
you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. 
Skin changes at the injection site: 
If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken 
(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the 
injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
Other side effects include: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
Local reactions: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs may include: 
pain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. The reactions usually disappear after a few days. See your 
doctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. Stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away if 
the reactions become serious. For more information, see ‘serious allergic reaction’ above. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Swelling around your joints: When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more 
water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is usually only 
short-lasting. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
This medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, 
nausea, tiredness and itching. 
General effects from diabetes treatment 
• 
Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Too low blood sugar may happen if you: 
drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. 
Warning signs of too low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly: 
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. 
What to do if you get too low blood sugar 
• 
Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry 
glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). 
Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more 
than once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar 
may be delayed.  
Wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has 
settled. Then carry on with your insulin as usual. 
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: 
• 
turn you on your side 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
get medical help straight away 
not give you any food or drink because you may choke. 
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it. 
• 
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. 
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short 
or long-lasting. It may even cause death. 
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out 
you have used an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. 
Talk to your doctor if: 
• 
• 
• 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed. 
• 
Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
Too high blood sugar may happen if you: 
eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without 
talking to your doctor. 
Warning signs of too high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually: 
Flushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, 
feeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death. 
What to do if you get too high blood sugar 
• 
• 
• 
Test your blood sugar level. 
Test your urine or blood for ketones. 
Get medical help straight away. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

Instructions on how to use Tresiba 100 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
(FlexTouch)  
Please read these instructions carefully before using your FlexTouch pre-filled pen. If you do not 
follow the instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high 
or too low blood sugar level. 
Do not use the pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. 
Start by checking your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba 100 units/mL, then look at the 
illustrations below to get to know the different parts of your pen and needle. 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use 
this pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch 
pre-filled pen. 
Your pen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen containing 300 units of insulin. You can select a 
maximum of 80 units per dose, in steps of 1 unit. Your pen is designed to be used with NovoTwist 
or NovoFine single-use disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm.  
Important information 
Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for correct use of the pen. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
54 
 
 
 
1 Prepare your pen 
• 
Check the name and strength on the label of your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba 
100 units/mL. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take 
a wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
• 
Pull off the pen cap. 
• 
Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. 
Look through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen. 
• 
Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. 
• 
Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. 
• 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection to 
correctly remove the needle from the pen. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may 
accidentally stick yourself with the needle. 
A drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the 
insulin flow. 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. 
This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and 
inaccurate dosing. 
  Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
2 Check the insulin flow 
• 
• 
Always check the insulin flow before you start. 
This helps you to ensure that you get your full insulin dose. 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. Make sure the dose counter shows 2. 
• 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. 
A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. 
If no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle 
and repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. 
  Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure 
that the insulin flows. 
If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose counter may move. 
This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
  Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level.  
3 Select your dose 
• 
• 
Make sure the dose counter shows 0 before you start. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need, as directed by your doctor or nurse. 
If you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards to the correct dose. 
The pen can dial up to a maximum of 80 units. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dose selector changes the number of units. Only the dose counter and dose pointer will show how 
many units you select per dose. 
You can select up to 80 units per dose. When your pen contains less than 80 units, the dose counter 
stops at the number of units left. 
The dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of units left. 
Do not count the pen clicks. 
  Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected 
before injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. 
Do not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
4 Inject your dose 
• 
• 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. 
Do not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection. 
Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
You may then hear or feel a click. 
• 
Leave the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you get your full dose. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Pull the needle and pen straight up from your skin. 
If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a cotton swab. Do not rub the area.  
You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your 
dose. 
  Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. 
The dose counter will show the exact number of units. Do not count the pen clicks. Hold the 
dose button down until the dose counter returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose counter stops 
before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood 
sugar level. 
5 After your injection 
• 
Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without 
touching the needle or the outer needle cap. 
• 
• 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on. 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the insulin from light. 
Always dispose of the needle after each injection in an appropriate sharps container. This reduces 
the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the 
needle is blocked, you will not inject any insulin. 
When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, 
pharmacist or local authorities. Do not place the used needle in household waste.  
  Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the 
needle. 
  Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle 
attached. 
This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and 
inaccurate dosing. 
6 How much insulin is left? 
• 
The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
• 
To see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: 
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. 
If it shows 80, at least 80 units are left in your pen. 
If it shows less than 80, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. 
If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two 
pens. 
  Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. 
If in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too 
little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. 
Further important information 
Always keep your pen with you. 
Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you in case of loss or damage. 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tresiba is and what it is used for 
Tresiba is a long-acting basal insulin called insulin degludec. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. Tresiba helps your body reduce your blood 
sugar level. It is used for once-daily dosing. On occasions when you cannot follow your regular dosing 
schedule, you can change the time of dosing because Tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect 
(see section 3 for ‘Flexibility in dosing time’). Tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting 
insulin products. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin.  
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid-acting 
insulin medicines. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Tresiba 
Do not use Tresiba 
• 
if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tresiba. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4. 
Switching from other insulin medicines – the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch 
from another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. Talk to your doctor. 
Pioglitazone used together with insulin, see ‘Pioglitazone’ below. 
Eye disorder – fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder. If you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between different strengths of Tresiba as well as other insulin 
products.  
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Tresiba’). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Tresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. There is no experience with 
the use of Tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Tresiba 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be 
changed. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) 
• 
sulfonamides, for infections 
• 
anabolic steroids, such as testosterone 
• 
beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs 
• 
of too low blood sugar (see section 4 ‘Warning signs of too low blood sugar’) 
acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, for depression 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood 
pressure. 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol, for endometriosis 
oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems 
growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency 
glucocorticoids such as ‘cortisone’, for inflammation 
sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma 
thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). 
Octreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Pioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with 
long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with 
pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor immediately 
if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Tresiba with alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. 
You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be 
changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. 
Avoiding too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Having too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If 
your blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This 
could be dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: 
• 
• 
you often get too low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Tresiba 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Tresiba  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure. 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this pen 
without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch pre-filled 
pen. 
Tresiba in a pre-filled pen is available in two strengths. “Tresiba 100 units/mL” or “Tresiba 
200 units/mL” is clearly marked on the pen label and packaging. In addition, Tresiba 100 units/mL 
packaging and label are light green, and Tresiba 200 units/mL packaging and label are dark green with 
striping with a red box highlighting the formulation strength. 
For both strengths, the needed dose is dialled in units. The dose steps, however, differ between the two 
strengths of Tresiba.  
The pre-filled pen 200 units/mL can provide a dose of 2–160 units in one injection in steps of 2 units. 
The dose counter of the pre-filled pen shows the number of units of insulin to be injected. Do not 
make any dose re-calculation.  
Your doctor will decide together with you: 
• 
• 
how much Tresiba you will need each day 
when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. 
Flexibility in dosing time 
• 
• 
• 
Always follow your doctor’s recommendation for dose. 
Use Tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. 
On occasions when it is not possible to take Tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken 
at a different time of day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. There is 
no experience with flexibility in dosing time of Tresiba in children and adolescents. 
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a 
change in diet may alter your need for insulin. 
• 
Based on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. 
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted.  
Use in elderly (≥65 years old) 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level 
more often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
If you have kidney or liver problems 
If you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
Injecting your medicine  
Before you use Tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the pre-filled 
pen. 
• 
• 
Check the name and strength on the label of the pen to make sure it is Tresiba 200 units/mL. 
The dose counter of your pen shows the exact number of insulin units. Do not make any dose 
re-calculation. 
Do not use Tresiba  
• 
• 
• 
in insulin infusion pumps. 
if the pen is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5 ‘How to store Tresiba’). 
if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. 
How to inject 
• 
Tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject it into a 
vein or muscle. 
The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist 
(abdomen). 
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
lumps and skin pitting (see section 4). 
Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked 
needles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. 
Do not use a syringe to remove the solution from the pen to avoid dosing errors and potential 
overdose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Detailed instructions for use are provided on the other side of this leaflet. 
If you use more Tresiba than you should 
If you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 
4 ‘Too low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Tresiba 
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of 
8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your 
next regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. 
If you stop using Tresiba 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin, this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), 
see advice in section 4 ‘Too high blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Hypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect 
more than 1 in 10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much, you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See advice in ‘Too low blood sugar’ below. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in Tresiba, 
stop using this medicine and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the local reactions spread to other parts of your body 
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating 
you start being sick (vomiting) 
you experience difficulty in breathing 
you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. 
Skin changes at the injection site: 
If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken 
(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the 
injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
Other side effects include: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
Local reactions: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs may include: 
pain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. The reactions usually disappear after a few days. See your 
doctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. Stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away if 
the reactions become serious. For more information, see ‘serious allergic reaction’ above. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Swelling around your joints: When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more 
water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is usually only 
short-lasting. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
This medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, 
nausea, tiredness and itching. 
General effects from diabetes treatment 
• 
Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Too low blood sugar may happen if you: 
drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. 
Warning signs of too low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly: 
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. 
What to do if you get too low blood sugar 
• 
Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry 
glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). 
Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more 
than once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar 
may be delayed.  
Wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has 
settled. Then carry on with your insulin as usual. 
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: 
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side 
get medical help straight away 
not give you any food or drink because you may choke. 
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it. 
• 
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. 
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short 
or long-lasting. It may even cause death. 
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out 
you have used an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. 
Talk to your doctor if: 
• 
• 
• 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed. 
• 
Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
Too high blood sugar may happen if you: 
eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without 
talking to your doctor. 
Warning signs of too high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually: 
Flushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, 
feeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death. 
What to do if you get too high blood sugar 
• 
• 
• 
Test your blood sugar level. 
Test your urine or blood for ketones. 
Get medical help straight away. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

Instructions on how to use Tresiba 200 units/mL solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
(FlexTouch) 
Please read these instructions carefully before using your FlexTouch pre-filled pen. If you do not 
follow the instructions carefully, you may get too little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high 
or too low blood sugar level. 
Do not use the pen without proper training from your doctor or nurse. 
Start by checking your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba 200 units/mL, then look at the 
illustrations below to get to know the different parts of your pen and needle. 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use 
this pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the FlexTouch 
pre-filled pen. 
Your pen is a pre-filled dial-a-dose insulin pen containing 600 units of insulin. You can select a 
maximum of 160 units per dose, in steps of 2 units. The dose counter of your pen shows the exact 
number of insulin units. Do not make any dose re-calculation. Your pen is designed to be used with 
NovoTwist or NovoFine single-use disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm.  
Important information 
Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for correct use of the pen. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
70 
 
 
1 Prepare your pen 
• 
Check the name and strength on the label of your pen to make sure that it contains Tresiba 
200 units/mL. This is especially important if you take more than one type of insulin. If you take 
a wrong type of insulin, your blood sugar level may get too high or too low. 
• 
Pull off the pen cap. 
• 
Check that the insulin in your pen is clear and colourless. 
Look through the insulin window. If the insulin looks cloudy, do not use the pen. 
• 
Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. 
• 
Push the needle straight onto the pen. Turn until it is on tight. 
• 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection to 
correctly remove the needle from the pen. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it back on, you may 
accidentally stick yourself with the needle. 
A drop of insulin may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the 
insulin flow. 
  Always use a new needle for each injection. 
This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and 
inaccurate dosing. 
  Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
2 Check the insulin flow 
• 
• 
Always check the insulin flow before you start.  
This helps you to ensure that you get your full insulin dose. 
Turn the dose selector to select 2 units. Make sure the dose counter shows 2. 
• 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. 
Tap the top of the pen gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top. 
72 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. 
A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. 
If no drop appears, repeat steps 2A to 2C up to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle 
and repeat steps 2A to 2C once more. 
If a drop of insulin still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. 
  Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you inject. This makes sure 
that the insulin flows. 
If no drop appears, you will not inject any insulin, even though the dose counter may move. 
This may indicate a blocked or damaged needle. 
  Always check the flow before you inject. If you do not check the flow, you may get too little 
insulin or no insulin at all. This may lead to too high blood sugar level. 
3 Select your dose 
• 
• 
• 
Make sure the dose counter shows 0 before you start. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
Turn the dose selector to select the dose you need, as directed by your doctor or nurse.  
The dose counter shows the dose dialled in units. Do not make any dose re-calculation. 
If you select a wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forwards or backwards to the correct dose. 
The pen can dial up to a maximum of 160 units. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dose selector changes the number of units. Only the dose counter and dose pointer will show how 
many units you select per dose. 
You can select up to 160 units per dose. When your pen contains less than 160 units, the dose counter 
stops at the number of units left. 
The dose selector clicks differently when turned forwards, backwards or past the number of units left. 
Do not count the pen clicks. 
  Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many units you have selected 
before injecting the insulin. 
Do not count the pen clicks. If you select and inject the wrong dose, your blood sugar level may 
get too high or too low. 
Do not use the insulin scale, it only shows approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
4 Inject your dose 
• 
• 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. 
Do not touch the dose counter with your fingers. This could interrupt the injection. 
Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
You may then hear or feel a click. 
• 
Leave the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you get your full dose. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Pull the needle and pen straight up from your skin. 
If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a cotton swab. Do not rub the area. 
You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your 
dose. 
  Always watch the dose counter to know how many units you inject. 
The dose counter will show the exact number of units. Do not count the pen clicks. Hold the 
dose button down until the dose counter returns to 0 after the injection. If the dose counter stops 
before it returns to 0, the full dose has not been delivered, which may result in too high blood 
sugar level. 
5 After your injection 
• 
Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without 
touching the needle or the outer needle cap. 
• 
• 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap completely on. 
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the insulin from light. 
Always dispose of the needle after each injection in an appropriate sharps container. This reduces 
the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and inaccurate dosing. If the 
needle is blocked, you will not inject any insulin. 
When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed by your doctor, nurse, 
pharmacist or local authorities. Do not place the used needle in household waste.  
  Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may stick yourself with the 
needle. 
  Always remove the needle after each injection and store your pen without the needle 
attached.  
This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of insulin, blocked needles and 
inaccurate dosing. 
6 How much insulin is left? 
• 
The insulin scale shows you approximately how much insulin is left in your pen. 
• 
To see precisely how much insulin is left, use the dose counter: 
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. 
If it shows 160, at least 160 units are left in your pen. 
If it shows less than 160, the number shown is the number of units left in your pen.

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Turn the dose selector back until the dose counter shows 0. 
If you need more insulin than the units left in your pen, you can split your dose between two 
pens. 
  Be very careful to calculate correctly if splitting your dose. 
If in doubt, take the full dose with a new pen. If you split the dose wrong, you will inject too 
little or too much insulin, which can lead to too high or too low blood sugar level. 
Further important information 
Always keep your pen with you. 
Always carry an extra pen and new needles with you in case of loss or damage. 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, especially children. 
Never share your pen or your needles with other people. It might lead to cross-infection. 
Never share your pen with other people. Your medicine might be harmful to their health. 
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles to reduce the risk of needle 
injury and cross-infection. 
Caring for your pen 
Treat your pen with care. Rough handling or misuse may cause inaccurate dosing, which can lead to 
too high or too low blood sugar level. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or too cold. 
Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid. 
Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a 
moistened cloth. 
Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. 
If you drop it or suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the insulin flow before you 
inject. 
Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of. 
Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tresiba is and what it is used for 
Tresiba is a long-acting basal insulin called insulin degludec. It is used to treat diabetes mellitus in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. Tresiba helps your body reduce your blood 
sugar level. It is used for once-daily dosing. On occasions when you cannot follow your regular dosing 
schedule, you can change the time of dosing because Tresiba has a long blood sugar-lowering effect 
(see section 3 for ‘Flexibility in dosing time’). Tresiba can be used with meal-related rapid-acting 
insulin products. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba may be used in combination with tablets for 
diabetes or with injectable antidiabetic medicines, other than insulin.  
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Tresiba must always be used in combination with meal-related rapid-acting 
insulin medicines. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Tresiba 
Do not use Tresiba 
• 
if you are allergic to insulin degludec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tresiba. Be especially aware of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is too low, follow the guidance for low 
blood sugar in section 4. 
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) – if your blood sugar is too high, follow the guidance for 
high blood sugar in section 4. 
Switching from other insulin medicines – the insulin dose may need to be changed if you switch 
from another type, brand or manufacturer of insulin. Talk to your doctor. 
Pioglitazone used together with insulin, see ‘Pioglitazone’ below. 
Eye disorder – fast improvements in blood sugar control may lead to a temporary worsening of 
diabetic eye disorder. If you experience eye problems, talk to your doctor. 
Ensuring you use the right type of insulin – always check the insulin label before each injection 
to avoid accidental mix-ups between Tresiba and other insulin products.  
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have poor eyesight, please see section 3. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to help prevent changes to the fatty tissue under the skin, such as 
skin thickening, skin shrinking or lumps under the skin. The insulin may not work very well if you 
inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area (see section 3 ‘How to use Tresiba’). Tell your doctor 
if you notice any skin changes at the injection site. Tell your doctor if you are currently injecting into 
these affected areas before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor may tell you to check 
your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Children and adolescents 
Tresiba can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above. There is no experience with 
the use of Tresiba in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Tresiba 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines affect your blood sugar level, this may mean your insulin dose has to be 
changed. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
other medicines for diabetes (oral and injectable) 
• 
sulfonamides, for infections 
• 
anabolic steroids, such as testosterone 
• 
beta-blockers, for high blood pressure. They may make it harder to recognise the warning signs 
• 
of too low blood sugar (see section 4 ‘Warning signs of too low blood sugar’) 
acetylsalicylic acid (and other salicylates), for pain and mild fever 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, for depression 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for some heart problems or high blood 
pressure. 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
danazol, for endometriosis 
oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
thyroid hormones, for thyroid problems 
growth hormone, for growth hormone deficiency 
glucocorticoids such as ‘cortisone’, for inflammation 
sympathomimetics such as epinephrine (adrenaline), salbutamol or terbutaline, for asthma 
thiazides, for high blood pressure or if your body keeps too much water (water retention). 
Octreotide and lanreotide: used to treat a rare condition involving too much growth hormone 
(acromegaly). They may increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Pioglitazone: oral antidiabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some patients with 
long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who were treated with 
pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor immediately 
if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Tresiba with alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change. Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall. 
You should therefore monitor your blood sugar level more often than usual. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your insulin dose may need to be 
changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes is needed in pregnancy. 
Avoiding too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is particularly important for the health of your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
Having too low or too high blood sugar can affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If 
your blood sugar is too low or too high, your ability to concentrate or react might be affected. This 
could be dangerous to yourself or others. Ask your doctor whether you can drive if: 
• 
• 
you often get too low blood sugar 
you find it hard to recognise too low blood sugar. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Tresiba 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose. This means that the medicine is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Tresiba  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure. 
If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the pen, do not use this 
insulin product without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the pen. 
Your doctor will decide together with you: 
• 
• 
how much Tresiba you will need each day 
when to check your blood sugar level and if you need a higher or lower dose. 
Flexibility in dosing time 
• 
• 
• 
Always follow your doctor’s recommendation for dose. 
Use Tresiba once each day, preferably at the same time every day. 
On occasions when it is not possible to take Tresiba at the same time of the day, it can be taken 
at a different time of day. Make sure to have a minimum of 8 hours between the doses. There is 
no experience with flexibility in dosing time of Tresiba in children and adolescents. 
If you want to change your usual diet, check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first as a 
change in diet may alter your need for insulin. 
• 
Based on your blood sugar level, your doctor may change your dose. 
When using other medicines, ask your doctor if your treatment needs to be adjusted. 
Use in elderly (≥65 years old) 
Tresiba can be used in elderly, but if you are elderly, you may need to check your blood sugar level 
more often. Talk to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
If you have kidney or liver problems 
If you have kidney or liver problems, you may need to check your blood sugar level more often. Talk 
to your doctor about changes in your dose. 
Injecting your medicine  
Before you use Tresiba for the first time, your doctor or nurse will show you how to use it. 
• 
• 
Please also read the manual that comes with your insulin delivery system. 
Check the name and strength on the label to make sure it is Tresiba 100 units/mL. 
Do not use Tresiba  
• 
in insulin infusion pumps. 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
if the cartridge or the delivery system you are using is damaged. Take it back to your supplier. 
See your delivery system manual for further instructions. 
if the cartridge is damaged or has not been stored correctly (see section 5 ‘How to store 
Tresiba’). 
if the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. 
How to inject 
• 
Tresiba is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject it into a 
vein or muscle. 
The best places to inject are the front of your thighs, upper arms or the front of your waist 
(abdomen). 
Change the place within the area where you inject each day to reduce the risk of developing 
lumps and skin pitting (see section 4). 
Always use a new needle for each injection. Re-use of needles may increase the risk of blocked 
needles leading to inaccurate dosing. Dispose of the needle safely after each use. 
• 
• 
• 
If you use more Tresiba than you should 
If you use too much insulin, your blood sugar may get too low (hypoglycaemia), see advice in section 
4 ‘Too low blood sugar’. 
If you forget to use Tresiba 
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose when discovering the mistake, ensuring a minimum of 
8 hours between doses. If you discover that you missed your previous dose when it is time to take your 
next regular scheduled dose, do not inject a double dose, but resume your once-daily dosing schedule. 
If you stop using Tresiba 
Do not stop using your insulin without talking to your doctor. If you stop using your insulin, this could 
lead to a very high blood sugar level and ketoacidosis (a condition with too much acid in the blood), 
see advice in section 4 ‘Too high blood sugar’. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Hypoglycaemia (too low blood sugar) may occur very commonly with insulin treatment (may affect 
more than 1 in 10 people). It can be very serious. If your blood sugar level falls too much, you may 
become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life-threatening. If 
you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately. 
See advice in ‘Too low blood sugar’ below. 
If you have a serious allergic reaction (seen rarely) to the insulin or any of the ingredients in Tresiba, 
stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away. The signs of a serious allergic reaction are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the local reactions spread to other parts of your body 
you suddenly feel unwell with sweating 
you start being sick (vomiting) 
you experience difficulty in breathing 
you experience rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy. 
Skin changes at the injection site: 
If you inject insulin at the same place, the fatty tissue may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken 
(lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by 
build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The 
insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy, shrunken or thickened area. Change the 
injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes.  
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other side effects include: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
Local reactions: Local reactions at the place you inject yourself may occur. The signs may include: 
pain, redness, hives, swelling and itching. The reactions usually disappear after a few days. See your 
doctor if they do not disappear after a few weeks. Stop using Tresiba and see a doctor straight away if 
the reactions become serious. For more information, see ‘serious allergic reaction’ above. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Swelling around your joints: When you first start using your medicine, your body may keep more 
water than it should. This causes swelling around your ankles and other joints. This is usually only 
short-lasting. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
This medicine can cause allergic reactions such as hives, swelling of the tongue and lips, diarrhoea, 
nausea, tiredness and itching. 
General effects from diabetes treatment 
• 
Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
Too low blood sugar may happen if you: 
drink alcohol; use too much insulin; exercise more than usual; eat too little or miss a meal. 
Warning signs of too low blood sugar – these may come on suddenly: 
Headache; slurred speech; fast heartbeat; cold sweat, cool pale skin; feeling sick, feeling very hungry; 
tremor or feeling nervous or worried; feeling unusually tired, weak and sleepy; feeling confused, 
difficulty in concentrating; short-lasting changes in your sight. 
What to do if you get too low blood sugar 
• 
Eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack, like sweets, biscuits or fruit juice (always carry 
glucose tablets or a high sugar snack, just in case). 
Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. You may need to measure your blood sugar more 
than once, as with all basal insulin products improvement from the period of low blood sugar 
may be delayed.  
Wait until the signs of too low blood sugar have gone or when your blood sugar level has 
settled. Then carry on with your insulin as usual. 
• 
• 
What others need to do if you pass out  
Tell everyone you spend time with that you have diabetes. Tell them what could happen if your blood 
sugar gets too low, including the risk of passing out. 
Let them know that if you pass out, they must: 
• 
• 
• 
turn you on your side 
get medical help straight away 
not give you any food or drink because you may choke. 
You may recover more quickly from passing out with an injection of glucagon. This can only be given 
by someone who knows how to use it. 
• 
• 
• 
If you are given glucagon, you will need sugar or a sugary snack as soon as you come round. 
If you do not respond to a glucagon injection, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
If severe low blood sugar is not treated over time, it can cause brain damage. This can be short 
or long-lasting. It may even cause death. 
Talk to your doctor if: 
• 
• 
• 
your blood sugar got so low that you passed out 
you have used an injection of glucagon 
you have had too low blood sugar a few times recently. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is because the dosing or timing of your insulin injections, food or exercise may need to be 
changed. 
• 
Too high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
Too high blood sugar may happen if you: 
eat more or exercise less than usual; drink alcohol; get an infection or a fever; have not used enough 
insulin; keep using less insulin than you need; forget to use your insulin or stop using insulin without 
talking to your doctor. 
Warning signs of too high blood sugar – these normally appear gradually: 
Flushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, 
feeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). 
These may be signs of a very serious condition called ketoacidosis. This is a build-up of acid in the 
blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar. If not treated, this could lead to diabetic 
coma and eventually death. 
What to do if you get too high blood sugar 
• 
• 
• 
Test your blood sugar level. 
Test your urine or blood for ketones. 
Get medical help straight away.

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine.

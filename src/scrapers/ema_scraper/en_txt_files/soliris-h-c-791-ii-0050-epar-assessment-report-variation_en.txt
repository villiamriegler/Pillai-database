2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity and selectivity to 
human complement protein C5, blocking its cleavage into the proinflammatory, prothrombotic C5a and 
lytic C5b-9 components, while leaving the upstream components of complement, most notably C3b, 
intact to preserve opsonization of pathogens and clearance of immune complexes. 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a debilitating and life-threatening hematopoietic stem 
cell disorder characterized by uncontrolled activation of the complement system leading to chronic 
intravascular hemolysis and an inflammatory prothrombotic state. PNH evolves from the clonal 
expansion of hematopoietic stem cells with resulting in complete or marked loss of the 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked terminal complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 from the 
surface of hematopoietic cells, rendering red blood cells susceptible to terminal complement-mediated 
hemolysis, and white blood cells and platelets susceptible to uncontrolled terminal complement-
mediated activation. 
A total of seven clinical studies (C02-001, E02-001, X03-001, C04-001 [TRIUMPH], C04-002 
[SHEPHERD], E05-001 and C06-002) have been conducted by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in adult 
PNH patients (i.e., 18 years and older) to assess the safety and efficacy of eculizumab therapy. These 
studies have confirmed that eculizumab was safe and well tolerated. Treatment with eculizumab 
modified the clinical course of PNH and was associated with significant reductions in thromboembolism, 
the leading cause of death in PNH, anemia, blood transfusions, and disease-related symptoms that 
included fatigue, pain and dyspnea, as well as improvements in patient functioning and global health 
status. 
On 20 June 2007, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for Soliris (eculizumab) 
for the treatment of PNH based on the above mentioned studies in adult patients. 
Since the granting of the marketing authorisation, the indication of Soliris has also been extended for 
the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS). 
At the time of the granting of the marketing authorisation, the Marketing authorisation Holder (MAH) 
committed to conduct a study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, 
and efficacy of eculizumab in paediatric patients with PNH. 
The design of such a study was further discussed in the Paediatric Investigation Plan of Soliris (EMEA-
000876-PIP01-10 approved on 10 September 2010). The MAH submitted the revised synopsis for 
Study M07-005 on 7 June 2010. This protocol was endorsed by the CHMP on 22 July 2010. 
Soliris

Page 4/28 
 
 
 
The final study report of Study M07-005 was submitted to the CHMP in March 2012 (FUM 014). Further 
to its assessment, the CHMP concluded on 21 June 2012 that the product information should be 
updated to include dose recommendations in paediatric patients.  
This variation application has been submitted to that effect, with the MAH proposal to update sections 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC to include dose recommendations and additional information 
available in paediatric patients with PNH as requested by CHMP further to the assessment of ME2 14.2.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
The formulation, presentation and administration of eculizumab in study M07-005 were identical to 
those tested in the initial development plan and described in the approved SmPC. These have been 
previously described in the original PNH submission. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the CHMP guideline “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, dated 01 June 2006), ‘Vitamins, 
electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Similarly, vaccines and herbal medicinal 
products are also exempted due to the nature of their constituents’. 
Eculizumab is a natural substance (protein), the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, eculizumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
Data in adults with PNH have shown that eculizumab concentrations greater than 35 μg/mL inhibited 
terminal complement formation and prevented intravascular hemolysis. Analyses of data in PNH clinical 
trials, however, demonstrated that terminal complement inhibition was incomplete in approximately 
Soliris 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/126714/2013 
Page 5/28 
 
 
 
 
 
35% of patients after the first (induction) dose of eculizumab. In addition, in approximately 10 – 15% 
of PNH patients, terminal complement inhibition during the maintenance phase (Week 6) was not 
consistently sustained with the 900 mg dose at the 14-day dosing interval. 
In order to maximize the clinical response in children and adolescent PNH patients and to ensure 100% 
complement blockade, concentration of eculizumab of at least 50 to100μg/ml to completely saturate 
C5 binding were targeted. 
This is consistent with its stoichiometric binding to C5 as eculizumab can bind up to two molecules of 
C5 and endogenous concentrations of C5 were reported to range from approximately 70 to 90 μg/mL. 
Since serum eculizumab concentrations of approximately 700 μg/mL have been well tolerated in adult 
PNH patients following acute and long-term treatments, an upper safety level of 700 μg/mL was used 
to optimize treatment in adolescent patients. The target eculizumab concentration in PNH paediatric 
patients is thus >50 μg/mL and <700 μg/mL.  
A population PK model of eculizumab was previously developed based on data collected in a total of 
177 adult PNH patients from 5 studies (C02-001, C04-001, C04-002, E05-001 and C07-001). A one-
compartment model parameterized with clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vc) fitted the 
plasma concentration profiles of eculizumab adequately. Based on this PK model, the following weight-
based dosing strategies were proposed for children and adolescent PNH patients (Table 1). 
Table 01: PNH Dosing Regimen based on PK Model 
The same population PK model was used to determine aHUS paediatric dosing recommendations. 
These doses have been evaluated in paediatric patients during the development of eculizumab in the 
aHUS indication (weight ranges from 4.4 to 127 kg) and it was confirmed that the recommended 
dosing regimen generally resulted as expected in eculizumab concentration between 50 and 700 
μg/mL. 
The proposed weight-based dosing regimen for PNH paediatric patients was to be evaluated in study 
M07-005 to confirm that the PK/PD parameters were as expected in this population.  
Study M07-005 
Methods 
Protocol M07-005 was an open-label, multi-center study of eculizumab that was to include six to eight 
paediatric patients with PNH.  
Main inclusion criteria included: 
• Individuals from 2 to less than 18 years of age with a diagnosis of PNH 
• Patients with >5% GPI deficient red blood cells or granulocytes as confirmed by flow cytometry 
Soliris

• Patients must show evidence of haemolytic anaemia as documented by LDH > ULN or at least one 
transfusion in the past 2 years for anaemia or anaemia-related symptoms 
• Patient must be vaccinated against N. meningitidis, pneumococcus and haemophilus at least 14 days 
prior to study drug initiation or be vaccinated and receive treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 
14 days after the vaccination 
Treatment with eculizumab for 12 weeks (4-week induction phase and eight weeks maintenance 
phase) was deemed adequate to assess if the proposed dosing regimen achieved the target 
therapeutic concentrations in paediatric PNH patients, consistently with the time required to reach at 
least 95% of average steady state (t0.95) and efficacy assessments at Week 12 were to be performed 
under steady-state conditions. 
The protocol required patients to receive doses of eculizumab intravenously (IV) based on their body 
weight according to the regimen described in Table 1 for a duration of 12 weeks. 
The primary objective of Study M07-005 was to evaluate the PK and PD parameter estimates of 
eculizumab in order to confirm the dose regimens for paediatric patients with PNH.  
The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in the 
treatment of paediatric PNH patients. Efficacy endpoints were change in baseline LDH values, Area 
under the curve (AUC) of Change in baseline LDH values, changes in plasma-free hemoglobin levels 
and QoL Assessments. All efficacy endpoints were assessed during the 12-week eculizumab treatment 
period. In addition, although the number of blood transfusions required was not defined in the protocol 
as an efficacy endpoint, transfusions are important in the management of PNH, therefore, the number 
of transfusions before and during eculizumab treatment was assessed. 
Therapeutic effectiveness of eculizumab in paediatric PNH patients was assessed by the change in LDH 
from baseline and the AUC of the change in LDH from baseline up to 12 weeks. Briefly, the changes of 
LDH from baseline up to 12 weeks (Visits 3-6, 8, and 10) were analyzed using a mixed effect model 
with time as fixed effect and patient as random effect. The AUC for the change in LDH from baseline up 
to 12 weeks was calculated for each patient and analyzed using a one sample t-test and nonparametric 
Wilcoxon signed rank test. Additionally, separate mixed effect models Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
were explored that included individual post-hoc PK parameters derived from the population PK 
analyses (i.e., predicted AUC, Cmax, Cmin, t1/2, CL, and Vc) of eculizumab as covariates in order to 
determine whether the changes from baseline in LDH were driven by the exposure to eculizumab. The 
change in plasma-free haemoglobin measurements from baseline at Week 4 and Week 12 was 
analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and one
sample paired
difference t
test. 
‐
QoL measurements included the PedsQLTM 4.0 Generic Core Scales (physical, emotional, social, and 
‐
‐
school functioning) and the PedsQL™ Multidimensional Fatigue questions and scores. In addition, 
although not specified as an efficacy endpoint in the protocol, a comparison of the number of packed 
red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion episodes before and after the start of eculizumab treatment was 
evaluated. 
Results 
Seven paediatric patients (four females and three males) between 11 and 17 years were treated in 
Study M07-005. The median age was 15.6 years old. All patients weighed more than 40 kg, with a 
median weight of 57.2 kg (range of 48.6 to 69.8 kg). These patients represent the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
patient population that was used in the efficacy analyses.

Patients had a median baseline LDH level of 651 U/L that was approximately twice the ULN of 325 U/L. 
With the exception of one patient who had normal baseline plasma-free haemoglobin levels, baseline 
levels were at or greater than the ULN (6.9 mg/dL) for the remaining patients.  
One patient had maximum baseline levels of both LDH (3144 U/L) and plasma-free haemoglobin (>60 
mg/dL). 
All seven patients enrolled received at least one dose of eculizumab and completed 12 weeks of 
treatment as per protocol. Efficacy analyses were performed on the treated population. Six of the 
seven patients elected to continue treatment with commercial eculizumab (Soliris) and five of these 
patients consented to be enrolled in the Soliris PNH Registry (Study M07-001). 
• 
LDH 
Change from baseline LDH values at each visit (Visit 3 though Visit 10) showed a rapid and statistically 
significant reduction in LDH levels that was sustained for the duration of eculizumab treatment in these 
paediatric PNH patients. As shown in Table 2 mean LDH values from baseline markedly decreased 
(reduction of 672 U/L) at the time point following the first eculizumab dose and was sustained at all 
subsequent visits for 12 weeks. The decrease from baseline LDH values after treatment with 
eculizumab (at Week 12) was statistically significant (P-value=0.0156) based on the Wilcoxon 
nonparametric test. Results from the paired t-test were also statistically significant (P-Value=0.0336), 
although the data were not normally distributed (P-Value=0.0031; Shapiro-Wilk test for normality). 
Table 02: M07-005: Summary Statistics of LDH Values and Change from Baseline LDH Values 
by Visit in Paediatric Patients with PNH 
A statistically significant (i.e., P-Value < 0.05) decrease in the AUC of the change from baseline LDH 
was also reported (Table 3).

Mixed effect models (ANOVA) were performed to explore whether the decrease in LDH values from 
baseline in paediatric patients with PNH could be explained by the exposure to eculizumab. Despite the 
small sample size (n=7), the results of the ANOVA showed that the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of 
eculizumab at steady-state were associated with a statistically significant decrease in LDH relative to 
baseline in patients with PNH for all visits (Table 4). These results are expected, as the exposure to 
eculizumab, which targets haemolytic activity, is correlated with LDH levels.

• 
Plasma-free Haemoglobin 
A decreasing trend in plasma-free hemoglobin levels from baseline was observed over the treatment 
period through Week 12 although the mean decrease was not statistically significant. Mean plasma-
free hemoglobin levels were 17.7 mg/dL at baseline and 7.44 mg/dL at Week 12. However, summary 
values at baseline were skewed by one patient with a value of >60 mg/dL at baseline. This patient’s 
plasma-free hemoglobin decreased to 3.3 mg/dL at Week 12. Median decrease in plasma-free 
hemoglobin levels for all patients was from 12.7 mg/dL at baseline to 8.4 mg/dL at Week 12.  
• 
PedsQL™ (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory) 
Mixed model analysis was not performed on QoL measurements due to insufficient data collection, 
including missing data at baseline for some of the patients. Despite the incomplete amount of data 
available, percent mean change from baseline in the PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scale scores ranged 
from 5.4 to 13.3% while the decrease in the PedsQL™ Multidimensional Fatigue scores ranged from -
0.52 to -8.84%. • 
Transfusion Episodes 
Six of seven patients (three with a history of aplastic anaemia) received a total of 11 PRBC 
transfusions before the start of eculizumab. The median haemoglobin value prior to transfusion was 
7.0 g/dL and levels ranged from 2.3 to 8.3 g/dL. During the 12 week-treatment with eculizumab, one 
patient required blood transfusion, which was not unexpected due to underlying aplastic anaemia. Six 
of seven patients remained transfusion-free throughout the Treatment Period and a marked increase in 
mean haemoglobin levels from baseline was observed from Week 4 to Week 8. 
 PK/PD modelling 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data was previously generated in patients with a 
diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical haemolytic-uremic syndrome 
(aHUS). The goal of this population PK analysis of eculizumab was to support the harmonization of the 
eculizumab dosing regimen in paediatric PNH patients < 40 kg to the dosing regimen for paediatric 
aHUS patients < 40 kg as specified in the current Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

A NONMEM dataset was constructed by merging QA’d population PK datasets previously used for the 
modelling of eculizumab in PNH and aHUS patients. The population PK analysis was performed with all 
available PK data for eculizumab in PNH (adults and paediatric patients) and aHUS (adults and 
paediatric patients), which consisted of a total of 155 PNH patients (Studies C02-001, C04-001, C04-
002, E05-001, and M07-005) and 57 aHUS patients (Studies C08-002 A/B, C08-003A/B, and C09-
001R). 
Population PK modelling of eculizumab was performed to assess the PK in PNH and aHUS patients 
separately, while leveraging a single allometric function describing the effect of weight on PK 
parameters. 
The one-compartment model was used to bridge PK information in PNH and aHUS patients to support 
harmonization of dosing in paediatric PNH patients to that in paediatric aHUS patients. The population 
PK model constructed with PNH and aHUS data was used to derive individual (post-hoc) values of 
clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vc). Individual data were summarized with descriptive 
statistics (mean, coefficient of variation CV (%), median, range, and sample size). 
Descriptive statistics of categorical and continuous demographic data of PNH and aHUS patients used 
in the population PK analysis are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.

The wide range of body weight data available in aHUS patients (4.4 to 127 kg) which is unavailable in 
the PNH population, allowed for a robust estimation of the relationship between CL and body weight 
and bridges PK information in PNH and aHUS patients. One paediatric PNH patient below 12 years was 
included in the analysis. However, the body weight for this paediatric PNH patient (48.6 kg) was 
markedly higher than the mean body weight observed in paediatric aHUS patients (16.7 kg). 
Population PK Analysis results 
A total of 2247 concentrations of eculizumab were available to perform this analysis. The distribution of 
the concentrations over each study and age group is provided in Table 7. 
Table 07: Number of Measurable Concentration of Eculizumab Included in the Population PK 
Analysis 
Eculizumab concentration-time data in PNH and aHUS patients were adequately described with the 
population PK model (goodness-of-fits plots retained on file). Typical values of CL and Vc of eculizumab 
in PNH and aHUS patients derived with the population PK model are summarised in Table 8.

Typical CL values of eculizumab in PNH (weight range: 47.6 – 121 kg) and aHUS (weight range: 4.4 – 
127 kg) patients were 0.0202 and 0.0148 L/h, respectively. Typical Vc values of eculizumab in PNH 
and aHUS patients were 6.94 and 5.85 L, respectively. The power function of body weight on CL 
estimated with the same allometric function for both populations was 0.795, with a 95% confidence 
interval of 0.60–0.99, suggesting an important effect of body weight which is in line with the expected 
theoretical value of 0.75.4 The power function of body weight on Vc was estimated to 0.715 for both 
populations with a 95% confidence interval of 0.59–0.84. 
The relationship between individual CL values and body weight in PNH and aHUS patients are 
presented in Figure 1 
Figure 01: Relationship Between Clearance and Body Weight in PNH and aHUS Patients 
The wide range of body weights available in the overall population (4.4 to 127 kg) allowed a robust 
estimation of the effect of body weight on CL and Vc.

Adult patients (≥ 18 years) displayed a considerable overlap in individual CL values in the PNH 
(0.00833 to 0.0732 L/h) and aHUS (0.00795 to 0.00551 L/h) populations. Paediatric patients 12 to < 
18 years also displayed a considerable overlap in individual values in the PNH (0.00727 to 0.0152 L/h) 
and aHUS (0.00921 to 0.0179 L/h) populations. The CL value in the single PNH paediatric patient <12 
years (0.0061 L/h) was consistent with the mean value observed in the aHUS paediatric population 
(0.0050 L/h) and is included in the range of observations (0.00178 – 0.00849 L/h). 
Adult patients (≥ 18 years) also displayed a considerable overlap in individual Vc values in the PNH 
(3.28 to 15.0 L) and aHUS (2.74 to 10.6 L) populations. Likewise, considerable overlap was observed 
in individual Vc values in the PNH (2.91 to 5.31 L) and aHUS (2.69 to 7.18 L) paediatric patients 12 to 
< 18 years  populations. The Vc value in the single PNH paediatric patient < 12 years was consistent 
with the mean value observed in the aHUS paediatric population and included in the range of 
observations (0.772 – 3.46 L).  
The wide range of body weights observed in the PNH and aHUS populations (4.4 to 127 kg) allowed for 
a robust estimation of the effect of body weight on CL and Vc across all age groups and ultimately 
allowed for the bridging of PK information in PNH and aHUS patients. The above results clearly 
demonstrate similarity in CL and Vc of eculizumab in PNH and aHUS adults, paediatric 12 to < 18 
years, and were also consistent for paediatric <12 years patients. Therefore, PNH and aHUS patients 
are expected to display similar exposures of eculizumab following administration of similar doses.  
2.4.3.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Study M07-005 was initially a PK study aimed to confirm the proposed dosing for children with PNH. 
The 4 weeks of induction phase and the 8 weeks for maintenance seem adequate for this purpose. 
Seven patients were included and treated in the study with eculizumab. The dosing regimens studied 
were those previously approved for paediatric patients with aHUS <30kg, but with the currently 
approved dose for adults patients with PNH recommended in this study for children > 30 kg.

Results from this study were consistent with the results and known efficacy profile of eculizumab in 
adult patients with PNH (reduction of intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum LDH level, 
elimination of blood transfusions, and an overall improvement in general function). However, 
considering all patients recruited in this study weighed more than 40 kg, with a median weight of 57.2 
kg (range of 48.6 to 69.8 kg), all subjects actually received the dosing regimen for adult patients and 
no new data in patients <40kg has been provided to support the proposed recommendation in PNH.  
As per the current SmPC, dosing recommendations for paediatric aHUS patients are given according to 
the body weight of patients. As such, it is proposed that the dosing recommendation for paediatric PNH 
patients should be harmonized to the current body weight-based paediatric aHUS dosing 
recommendation. 
The paediatric dosing recommendations for aHUS paediatric patients have also demonstrated adequate 
PD activity (close-to-complete inhibition of % haemolysis and reduction in free C5) as well as efficacy 
and safety of eculizumab treatment for aHUS paediatric patients < 40 kg. At similar eculizumab 
exposures as aHUS paediatric patients < 40 kg, PNH paediatric patients < 40 kg are therefore 
expected to display similar PD activity (close-to-complete inhibition of % haemolysis). 
Population PK analysis have demonstrated some grade of similarity in CL and Vc of eculizumab for PNH 
and aHUS patients, both in adult and paediatric patients (12-18 years).  
Therefore, considering the efficacy for PNH from available data and that these two apparently different 
diseases are going to offer a similar response to eculizumab treatment, since the mechanism of action 
and the implication of eculizumab in the treatment of these two pathologies are basically identical 
(Soliris being a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to the complement protein C5), 
the Applicant’s proposal is acceptable. The registry M07-001 with PNH patients treated with Soliris will 
generate and provide to the CHMP periodic updates of available efficacy data in the subset of children 
<40kg with PNH treated with Soliris. 
In addition section 4.1 was updated to reflect the target population of Soliris for PNH in line with the 
SmPC guideline. This change is also introduced for aHUS although the indication in adults and children 
was granted on 24 November 2011. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
There are limited studies examining the natural history of PNH in paediatric cases. A retrospective 
analysis of 26 paediatric cases1 revealed similarities in the signs and symptoms between childhood and 
adult PNH including intravascular haemolysis, bone marrow failure and thrombosis. 
Paediatric patients with PNH enrolled in Study M07-005 were required to show evidence of haemolytic 
anaemia as documented by LDH levels greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) or at least one 
transfusion in the past two years for anaemia or anaemia related symptoms. Because eculizumab is a 
terminal complement inhibitor, patients receiving eculizumab are at an increased risk of developing 
infections caused by encapsulated bacteria including N. meningitidis. To mitigate the risk of these 
infections, all patients must have been vaccinated against N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and H. 
influenzae at least 14 days prior to first dose of eculizumab or have been vaccinated and have been 
receiving treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 14 days after the vaccination.

Safety was assessed by examination of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, vital signs, and 
physical examination during the 12 weeks of treatment with eculizumab. Patients continued to be 
monitored during a follow-up period of eight weeks after last dose of eculizumab. 
Patient exposure 
Paediatric patients with PNH received a total of nine doses of eculizumab for a median duration of 12 
weeks during the study (Table 10). After completion of the study, six of the seven patients in Study 
M07-005 continued to receive commercial eculizumab. 
Table 10: M07-005: Summary of the Extent of Exposure to Eculizumab 
Table 11: M07-005: Summary of Baseline Characteristics 
Adverse events 
All seven (100%) patients reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the 
study, and two (29%) patients experienced SAEs. The majority of patients (4 of 7) reported TEAEs that 
were mild in severity. Overall, eculizumab was well tolerated in paediatric patients with PNH (Table 
12).

Events by Severity and Relationship to Eculizumab

TEAEs that were reported in ≥2 patients are presented in Table 13 by system organ class and 
preferred term. A total of 69 TEAEs were reported by all seven (100%) patients enrolled in the study. 
The remaining TEAEs were each reported by one patient (14%). 
Table 13: M07-005: TEAEs Occurring in ≥2 Patients by System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term 
Adverse events considered related to study drug (probable or possible) were reported by five of the 
seven patients. There were 2 of 69 (2.9%) TEAEs probably related to eculizumab treatment: upper 
abdominal pain (severe) and hypotension (mild) each reported by one patient. Upper abdominal pain 
resolved 15 days after onset with medical treatment and hypotension (single episode that occurred 
seven days after the first dose of eculizumab) resolved within 24 hours without medical treatment. 
Patients continued eculizumab treatment while AEs resolved. TEAEs considered possibly related to 
eculizumab included headache (mild and moderate) reported by two (29%) patients, and anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, fatigue, pyrexia, pain in extremity, increased blood glucose and decreased appetite

each reported by one patient. Excluding headache, all possibly related TEAEs were mild while 
thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and blood glucose increased (patient was diabetic) were moderate in 
severity. Overall, a low number of AEs (2 of 69 [2.9%]) were considered probably related and none 
were definitely related to eculizumab in Study M07-005.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs were summarised by frequency and are presented in Table 14. Two (29%) patients reported a 
total of 12 SAEs. None of the patients discontinued eculizumab treatment or the trial because of an 
SAE. Three SAEs, anaemia (mild), thrombocytopenia, and headache (moderate) reported by one 
patient were judged possibly related to eculizumab. These three SAEs resolved with medical treatment 
(PRBC transfusion, platelet transfusion and paracetamol, respectively). The PRBC transfusions were 
transient and consisted of one to two treatments every two weeks for a total of seven PRBC 
transfusions and platelet transfusions were administered every two weeks for a total of five 
treatments. 
The remaining nine SAEs were unrelated to eculizumab and mild to moderate in severity, with the 
exception of aplastic anaemia that was severe (patient presented with a history of aplastic anaemia). 
These SAEs required medical treatment and had resolved by the end of the study, with the exception 
of one episode of anaemia which remained ongoing.

Neisseria meningitidis Infection and Other Infections 
There were no meningococcal infections reported in Study M07-005. All patients had been vaccinated 
against N. meningitidis prior to eculizumab treatment. A total of three patients reported a history of 
Soliris 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 17/28 
 
 
 
 
infection that included abscess limb, cellulitis, infectious mononucleosis, sinusitis, and upper 
respiratory tract infection. During the conduct of the study, a total of four (57%) patients reported 
TEAEs for the system organ class “Infections and Infestations”. All infections were mild to moderate in 
severity and judged unrelated to treatment with eculizumab. Infections included acute sinusitis, 
catheter site cellulitis, acute otitis media, and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Each infection 
was reported by one patient except URTI, which was reported by two patients. Patients continued 
treatment with eculizumab while the infections resolved. 
Sepsis and Haemolytic Events 
None of the patients in Study M07-005 experienced sepsis. 
One patient experienced a mild haemolytic event at the end of the follow-up period (Week 8) that was 
unrelated to eculizumab treatment (elevated LDH value of 371 U/L and reduced haemoglobin value of 
98 g/L). This event was attributed to the patient’s underlying PNH disease. Vital signs were within 
normal limits and no medical intervention (e.g., transfusion) was initiated due to this event. No other 
haemolytic events were reported in this study. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no apparent trends in the mean blood chemistry test values over the 12 week Treatment 
Period. Mean values for blood chemistry tests were within normal limits or marginally outside the 
upper and lower limits. During the study, one patient had elevated (three times above the upper limit 
of normal) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at baseline, which decreased to within normal levels for 
the remainder of the study. Three patients with AST levels above the normal range at baseline shifted 
to within the normal range from Week 4 to Week 10. 
Overall, mean values for the haematology tests were within normal limits or marginally outside the 
upper and lower limits of normal except for platelet counts and % reticulocyte. Four patients had 
platelet count >2-fold below the lower limit of normal and % reticulocytes was >2-fold above the 
normal range. At baseline and throughout the study, five of seven patients had platelet counts below 
the normal range while mean % reticulocyte counts were slightly above normal range throughout the 
study. The overall elevated mean % reticulocyte values may be attributed to one patient with % 
reticulocyte values three to six fold above the upper limit of normal at Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8. 
For WBC count, RBC count and %lymphocyte, levels were >2-fold below the lower limit of normal each 
in one patient on one or two visits. Shifts from baseline to low or baseline to high were observed in ≥2 
patients for lymphocyte, MCV, neutrophil, RBC and WBC. These shifts were sporadic and no trends 
were observed over the eculizumab Treatment Period.  
Median haemoglobin levels increased from 96.0 g/L at baseline to 101 g/L (93-124 g/L) by the end of 
the study. A marked decrease from baseline in LDH and plasma-free haemoglobin levels were 
observed during the eculizumab treatment period. LDH and plasma-free haemoglobin values are 
markers of efficacy and are presented and discussed in section 2.4. 
Mean values for the flow cytometry tests (granulocyte PNH clone, PNH monocytes, Type I, Type II, and 
Type III RBC cells) did not demonstrate any major changes from baseline. 
Human Antihuman Antibody (HAHA) 
None of the seven patients developed a human antihuman antibody response after 12 weeks of 
eculizumab treatment. All post-dose results for HAHA were negative (<1.3 μg/mL).

Post marketing experience 
A total of 28 patients with PNH below the age of 18 years received eculizumab treatment between 2 
April 2011 and 1 April 2012 (as reported in the PSUR covering the same period). Of these, 18 patients 
experienced AEs that are reported in 42 individual case safety reports. Overall, these cases do not 
reveal any new safety concern and the safety profile of eculizumab in paediatric PNH population 
appears similar to the adult PNH population. 
2.5.2.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical safety 
Results from were Study M07-005 were similar to the low number of AEs definitely or probably related 
to eculizumab in adult PNH patient trails (2.6% in the TRIUMPH trial and less than 8.0% in the 
SHEPHERD trial). 
SAEs of anaemia and headache reported by paediatric patients in this study were also reported in adult 
PNH patients. Overall, the number of paediatric patients reporting SAEs was low, and consistent with 
the SAE data reported in adult PNH patients (9.3% of patients in the TRIUMPH trial and 12.4% of 
patients in the SHEPHERD trial). 
There were no obvious trends in clinical laboratory results during treatment with eculizumab and this 
was consistent with results obtained in adult PNH patients. 
HAHA frequency reported in these paediatric PNH patients was also consistent with the low frequency 
observed in adult PNH patients (none of the 97 patients in the SHEPHERD study developed 
immunogenicity to eculizumab and weak and transitive immunogenicity results were observed for 2 of 
43 [4.7%] patients in the TRIUMPH study). 
Therefore, although the sample size of the patients included in the study is limited, the safety profile of 
eculizumab appears to be similar to that seen in adults. No new risks and/or toxicities have been 
identified, however for consistency the wording in section 4.4 of the SmPC under “other systemic 
infections” has been aligned with the wording under “meningococcal infection” to reflect the increased 
susceptibility of patients to infections. 
In order to address the limited data available in PNH patients below 40kg with the proposed regimen, 
the MAH will generate and provide to the CHMP periodic updates of available safety data in the subset 
of children <40kg with PNH treated with Soliris and included in the Registry M07-001. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which 
remains unchanged.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan version 7 within this variation procedure. 
Some of the minor changes submitted in this updated version are as follows: 
•  Clinical trial exposure of the PNH clinical study M07-005 and aHUS clinical study (Japan) 
• 
Post marketing exposure 
•  Update of the PNH and aHUS registries status.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that no new pharmacovigilance 
activities in addition to those already being performed were needed to monitor the safety of the 
product. The ongoing PNH registry will therefore include both adult and paediatric patients.  
No new additional risk minimisation activities were required in addition to those already implemented. 
The CHMP endorses this advice without changes. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this extension of the indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC have been updated (new text bold, underlined, deleted text strikethrough). 
4.1 
Therapeutic indication 
Soliris is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of patients with  
- 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit of Soliris in the treatment of patients with PNH is limited to patients with 
history of transfusions. 
- 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (see section 5.1). 
[…] 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Adult Patients: 
In Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (PNH): 
The PNH dosing regimen for adult patients (≥18 years of age) consists of a 4-week initial phase 
followed by a maintenance phase: 
• 
Initial phase: 600 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 45 minute intravenous infusion every 
week for the first 4 weeks. 
•  Maintenance phase: 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25 – 45 minute intravenous infusion 
for the fifth week, followed by 900 mg of Soliris administered via a 25-45 minute intravenous 
infusion every 14 ± 2 days (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric Population 
The safety and efficacy of Soliris in children with PNH aged less than 18 years  have  not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
[…] 
Paediatric patients: 
Paediatric  PNH  andIn paediatric aHUS patients with  body  weight  >40kg  are  treated  with  the 
adult dosing recommendations, respectively;  
In  paediatric  PNH  and  aHUS  patients  with    body  weights    below  40kg  aged  less  than 
18 years, the Soliris dosing regimen consists of:

Soliris has not been studied in patients with PNH who weigh less than 40kg. The posology of 
Soliris for PNH patients less than 40kg weight is based on the posology used for patients 
with aHUS and who weigh less than 40kg.

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
[…] 
Other Systemic Infections: 
Due to its mechanism of action, Soliris therapy should be administered with caution to patients with 
active systemic infections. Patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially 
with encapsulated bacteria. Patients should be provided with information from the Package Leaflet 
to increase their awareness of potential serious infections and the signs and symptoms of them. 
[…] 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
[…] 
Paediatric population  
In children and adolescent PNH patients (aged 11 years to less than 18 years) included in 
the paediatric PNH Study M07-005, the safety profile appeared similar to that observed in 
adult PNH patients. The most common adverse reaction reported in paediatric patients was 
headache.  
[…]

Pharmacodynamic properties 
[…] 
Paediatric aHUS population 
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria 
A total of 7 PNH paediatric patients, with a median weight of 57.2 kg (range of 48.6 to 69.8 
kg) and aged from 11 to 17 years (median age : 15.6 years), received Soliris in study M07-
005.  
Treatment with eculizumab at the proposed dosing regimen in the paediatric population was 
associated with a reduction of intravascular haemolysis as measured by serum LDH level. It 
also resulted in a marked decrease or elimination of blood transfusions, and a trend towards 
an overall improvement in general function. The efficacy of eculizumab treatment in 
paediatric PNH patients appears to be consistent with that observed in adult PNH patients 
enrolled in PNH pivotal Studies (C04-001 and C04-002) (Table 3 and 6).

Overall in pediatric patients with PNH,  treatment with eculizumab modified the clinical course of the 
disease, and is consistent with the therapeutic effectiveness observed in adult patients with PNH. 
Pharmacokinetic properties  
5.2 
[…] 
Paediatric patients 
The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab was evaluated in Study M07-005 including 7 PNH 
paediatric patients (aged from 11 to less than 18 years). 
Weight was a significant covariate resulting in a lower eculizumab clearance 0.0105 L/h in 
the adolescent patients. Dosing for paediatric patients <40 kg is based on paediatric 
patients with aHUS. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Minor editorial changes have been included as part of this variation. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template (version 8.3), 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Eculizumab is currently approved in the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and 
Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Both aHUS and PNH are complement inhibitor deficiency 
disorders characterised by uncontrolled complement activation.  
Up to now, in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria, the safety and efficacy of Soliris in children had 
not been established. Optimal therapeutic alternatives in paediatric patients are lacking. Data from

PNH clinical studies in adults had shown that eculizumab serum concentrations greater than 35 μg/mL 
blocked serum terminal complement activation and resulted in a rapid reduction in intravascular 
haemolysis in the majority of patients. However, elevated LDH levels, indicating breakthrough 
haemolysis and incomplete terminal complement inhibition, were occasionally observed in patients with 
PNH being treated with the PNH specific dose regimen. Due to this fact, in aHUS patients it was 
considered critically important to optimise the induction and maintenance dose of eculizumab to 
maintain complete and sustained terminal complement inhibition and to address the higher free C5 
levels observed in patients. Therefore, a higher target trough level was chosen (e.g., ≥50-100 μg/mL). 
The target Cmax was set at <700 μg/mL which was the highest concentration observed during the 
conduct of the PNH clinical trials and proved to be a safe level of exposure to eculizumab. Based on 
this principles, a weight-based dosing recommendation for children <40kg was proposed for the aHUS 
population. 
On these premises, the study M07-005 was conducted based on the dose regimen already approved 
for aHUS paediatric patients in children and adolescent with PNH. 
Data from the study M07-005 indicate a clinical meaningful response, with reduction of intravascular 
haemolysis as measured by serum LDH level, elimination of blood transfusions, and a positive trend in 
the general function. All the patients followed the inclusion criteria and only one child discontinued 
treatment after 12 weeks. 
In addition to that, the Population PK analysis submitted demonstrated some grade of similarity in CL 
and Vc of eculizumab for PNH and aHUS patients, both in adult and paediatric patients (12-18 years). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The 7 children enrolled in the study were all over 40kg and therefore, only the dosing regimen for adult 
patients could be tested. The aHUS paediatric regimen now proposed for paediatric PNH patients has 
therefore not been evaluated in the target population. This is therefore the main uncertainty of this 
application. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
All seven (100%) patients included in the M07-005 study reported at least one TEAE during the study, 
and two (29%) patients experienced SAEs. The majority of patients (4 of 7) reported TEAEs that were 
mild in severity. Headache was the most common TEAE reported in five (71%) of seven patients, 
followed by upper respiratory tract infection, upper abdominal pain, pyrexia, and cough each reported 
by two patients (29%). 
Two (29%) patients reported a total of 12 SAEs. None of the patients discontinued eculizumab 
treatment or the trial because of an SAE. Three SAEs, anemia (mild), thrombocytopenia, and headache 
(moderate) reported by one patient were judged possibly related to eculizumab. These three SAEs 
resolved with medical treatment (PRBC transfusion, platelet transfusion and paracetamol, 
respectively). 
There were no meningococcal infections reported in Study M07-005. None of the patients experienced 
sepsis.

The sample size is very low in this specific group of patients. Only 7 subjects and all of them > 40 kg 
were recruited into the study.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Data from study m07-005 indicate a clinical meaningful response in paediatric patients with PNH 
between 11 and 17 years of age and weighing more than 30kg, showing a reduction of intravascular 
haemolysis as measured by serum LDH level, elimination of blood transfusions, and an overall 
improvement in general function. Although there are uncertainties related to the extrapolation of the 
efficacy in adolescents/adults to children with PNH and further, whether the experience gained in 
children with aHUS disease can support a similar dosing recommendation in PNH, it has to be 
recognised that in all cases there is a common underlying debilitating and life-threatening disorder 
characterized by uncontrolled activation of the complement system. Eculizumab is able to block this 
cascade by binding to human complement protein C5 and the doses and plasma levels needed to reach 
a sustainable blockade appear well characterised particularly in patients with aHUS.  
The Population PK analysis shows some grade of similarity in CL and Vc of eculizumab for PNH and 
aHUS patients, both in adult and paediatric patients (12-18 years). This fact along with the lack of any 
safety concern, provides reasonable evidence to accept the aHUS dosing regimen for children also for 
children with PNH. Additionally, the efficacy of eculizumab in PNH paediatric patients is not expected to 
be different from that shown in adult patients. Therefore, the proposed dose recommendations for use 
in paediatric patients with PNH is acceptable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
There is still a lack of data in children below 40 kg, however, the proposal of accepting the dosing 
regimen already approved for children with aHUS in PNH children patients, seems reasonable. A 
specific study in this subset of patients (children <40kg) able to support a different dosing regimen 
does not seem feasible. Based on the efficacy data available and the Population PK analysis indicating 
a similarity between PNH and aHUS with regard to CL and Vc, the CHMP considered the Benefit/risk to 
be positive.  There are no safety concerns that could add important uncertainties to this decision, even 
though, data in this population are scarce. Indeed, a paediatric study with the dosing regimen now 
proposed is already on going in aHUS subjects, which will allow the opportunity of collecting more data 
on the safety profile in children.  
Finally, there is already an opened registry enrolling patients with PNH worldwide (M07-001). One of 
the two populations of this registry includes PNH patients of any age, including paediatric patients, that 
are receiving Soliris. This registry could provide more data on efficacy and safety of eculizumab with 
the new regimen proposed for PNH paediatric patients.

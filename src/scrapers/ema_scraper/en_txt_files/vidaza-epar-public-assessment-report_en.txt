SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
MDS  (myelodysplastic  syndrome)  is  a  rare  and  life  threatening  disease  that  can  affect  children  and 
adults, although the highest prevalence occurs in those over 60 years of age.(1) The incidence of MDS 
has been estimated as 4.1/100,000 population. The incidence rises with increasing age: 4.9 for people 
aged 50 to 70 years and 22.8 for people older than 70 years.(1) 
MDS encompasses a group of haematological disorders that is characterised by clonal haematopoietic 
stem  cell  disorder,  usually  of  the  granulocytic,  erythroid  or  platelet  lineage,  that  results  in 
abnormalities in proliferation, differentiation and maturation of the myeloid lineage.(2)  This leads to 
one  or  more  peripheral  cytopenias  and  progressive  bone  marrow  failure.  As  a  result,  patients  with 
MDS are at risk for symptomatic anaemia, infection and bleeding.(3)  
The  clinical  presentation  of  MDS  is  generally  non-specific.  However,  initial  findings  of  MDS  can 
usually  be  attributed  to  the  underlying  cytopenias.  MDS  can  arise  de  novo  (primary  MDS)  or 
following  treatment  with  chemotherapy,  radiation  therapy  or  chemical  injury  (secondary  MDS). 
Depending on the subtype of myelodysplasia, there is a risk of approximately 50% for development of 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is often refractory to standard treatment.  
The  diagnosis  and  classification  of  MDS  can  be  based  on  two  classification  systems,  the  French-
American-British (FAB) classification system and the more recent updated WHO classification system 
(4) (table 1).

The International Prognostic Scoring System issued in 1997 provides a method for evaluating clinical 
prognostic risk factors for patients with MDS (5). The 3 critical factors include risk-based cytogenetic 
subgroups (good, intermediate, and poor), bone marrow blast percentage and cytopenias. Patients are 
grouped into 4 risk categories based on total scores from these prognostic factors (table 2) (1, 3).

Despite  current  treatment  strategies,  approximately  half  of  the  patient  population  with  MDS  dies 
within 4 years. Cure may be achieved only in patients who can receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem 
cell  transplantation  (allo  HSCT)  (5).  However,  depending  on  a  patient’s  age  and  general  health 
condition,  best  supportive  care  (BSC),  consisting  in  transfusions,  growth  factors,  iron  chelation 
therapy,  is  most  frequently  applied.  Otherwise,  low-dose  chemotherapy  or  standard  combination 
chemotherapy may be used for the various subclasses of MDS but without a standard approach of care 
(6). Only intensive chemotherapy followed by allo HSCT was shown to result in improved survival in 
patients with Intermediate-2 or high risk MDS or AML that progressed from MDS (AML-MDS) when 
compared with non-intensive treatment or supportive care only (actuarial survival at 4 years of 26% 
vs. 10%)(7, 8). 
AML  evolving  from  MDS  is  often  less  responsive  to  standard  treatment  than  de  novo  AML.  The 
usually higher age at diagnosis makes these patients more vulnerable to toxic effects from induction 
and consolidation chemotherapy (with e.g., cytarabine, etoposide and idarubicin) and the HSCT. 
Vidaza,  5-azacitidine  (azacitidine  or  5-aza)  is  a  pyrimidine  nucleoside  analogue  of  cytidine,  a 
constituent  of  RNA.  Due  to  its  similarity  to  cytidine,  azacitidine  blocks  the  synthesis  of  DNA  and 
RNA and thus inhibits the growth of tumour cells. Metabolites such as azacitidine are also associated 
with inhibition of DNA-methylation (hypomethylation) and can inhibit tumour growth (9). High-risk 
MDS  shows  a  high  prevalence  of  tumour  suppressor  gene  hypermethylation,  which  induces 
inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. By re-establishing cell cycle control by restoring suppressor 
gene  function  and  antiproliferative  signals,  this  could  contribute  to  re-establish  cell  differentiation 
pathways required for appropriate cellular function. 
The  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Vidaza  was  for  the  following  indication:  “Vidaza  is 
indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  who  are  not  eligible  for  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation with: 
intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International 
 
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), 
chronic  myelomonocytic  leukaemia  (CMML)  with  10-29  %  marrow  blasts  without 
 
myeloproliferative disorder, 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according 
 
to World Health Organisation (WHO) classification.” 
The  recommended  dose  is  75  mg/m2  s.c.  once  daily  for  7  days  every  28  days.  The  drug  can  be 
administered in an outpatient setting and is considered to be a low intensity form of therapy. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Vidaza is presented as a sterile, single use powder for suspension for injection containing 100 mg of 
azacitidine. It must be reconstituted with water for injections before subcutaneous injection.  
The other ingredients include mannitol.  
The finished product is packed in glass vials closed by a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal 
with a plastic button.

  Active Substance 
The active substance is azacitidine, a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine.  
It is a white to off-white solid, sparingly soluble in water. Azacitidine contains 4 chiral centres but it is 
synthesised as a single enantiomer. It is not hygroscopic but it hydrolyses quickly in water (reaction 
pH  and  temperature  dependent).  9  solid-state  forms  have  been  identified:  five  polymorphic  forms, 
three  pseudopolymorphic  forms  and  an  amorphous  form.  Even  if  the  active  substance  is  fully 
solubilised  during  manufacture  of  the  finished  product,  polymorphism  could  be  of  importance  since 
the speed of dissolution of azacitidine could affect its degradation. However, all the polymorphs have 
been shown to convert quickly a single bioavailable pseudopolymorphic form in presence of water via 
rapid  surface  hydration  and  therefore  in  this  case  the  physical  form  of  the  active  substance  is  not 
expected to impact either on the stability or on the performance of the finished product. 
  Manufacture 
The  manufacture  of  azacitidine  comprises  4  main  steps.  All  manufacturing  steps  have  been  well 
described.  
The finalised specifications for starting material 5-azacytosine are considered to be adequate.  There 
are  no  intermediates  isolated  in  purified  form  in  the  manufacturing  process.  There  are  few  process 
related impurities, monoacetyl azacitidine is detectable in the active substance. 
  Specification 
The active substance specification include tests for colour, appearance, identity (IR), optical rotation 
(PhEur),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  sulphated  ash  (PhEur),  heavy 
metals (PhEur), water content (PhEur), microbial limits (PhEur) and bacterial endotoxins (PhEur). 
Satisfactory  batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  to  confirm  compliance  and  uniformity  with  the 
proposed specification. 
Impurity levels have been qualified by relevant toxicological studies. 
  Stability 
Stability data have been provided for 5 batches at accelerated conditions (25±2°C/60% RH) and long-
term  conditions  (5±3°)  respectively.  6-month  and  4-year  data  have  been  provided.  The  parameters 
tested  included  colour,  appearance,  assay,  related  substances,  water  content  and  microbial  limits 
testing.  Analytical  methods  used  in  stability  testing  include  water  content  (PhEur),  microbial  limits 
(PhEur.), assay (HPLC) and related substances (HPLC). An evaluation of polymorphic stability was 
also performed on active substance through 48 months under long-term storage conditions and through 
6 months under accelerated storage conditions. The data demonstrated that no changes in polymorphic 
form were observed under any of the conditions studied for the duration of the evaluation 
The  applicant  claims  a  re-test  period  of  3  years,  if  stored  in  double  polyethylene  bags  secured  in 
HDPE kegs at 2-8°C. No significant changes have been observed among the available stability results; 
no signs of degradation have been noticed. The claimed re-test period can be accepted. 
  Pharmaceutical development 
The  proposed  medicinal  product  is  a  powder  for  suspension  for  injection,  a  sterile,  single-use  drug 
formulation  containing  100  mg  azacitidine  intended  for  reconstitution  with  4  ml  sterile  water  for 
injection to form a suspension prior to subcutaneous injection.  
Azacitidine  rapidly  degrades  in  aqueous  solution  via  hydrolysis.  Due  to  this  instability,  an  aqueous 
formulation  was  not  a  viable  option.  Thus,  a  lyophilized  dosage  form  was  developed  to  minimize 
water activity in the medicinal product.  
Mannitol,  used  as  a  bulking  agent  for  the  lyophilisation  process,  is  the  only  excipient  in  the 
formulation.  It  is  of  PhEur  quality  and  its  compatibility  with  azacitidine  has  been  confirmed  by 
development and long-term stability studies. There is no need to buffer the formulation as the active is 
not a salt and it remains uncharged at the pH of the sterile water for injections used to reconstitute the 
product.  Regarding the TSE risk, the medicinal product does not include any components of ruminant 
origin. 
7/55 
To  minimize  azacitidine  degradation  during  product  manufacturing,  the  manufacturing  process  was 
developed  such  that  compounding,  filtration  and  filling  operations  are  performed  as  a  continuous 
process at reduced temperatures. 
The type I glass vials and the siliconized rubber stopper used as primary packaging material meet the 
PhEur  requirements.  They  are  compatible  with  the  product  and  capable  to  protect  it  from  excessive 
moisture in relation to the proposed specification. Acceptable closure integrity studies (dye penetration 
and microbial challenge studies) have been performed. 
  Manufacture of the Product 
There are two manufacturers.  
The manufacturing process involves the following operations: compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic 
filling, lyophilisation and packaging. A manufacturing overage for azacitidine was included to account 
for an observed loss of the compound during filtration. 
Due  to  the  instability  of  azacitidine  in  aqueous  solution,  control  of  product  temperature  throughout 
compounding, filtration, and filling and holding time are considered critical in order to minimize drug 
degradation.  
The rapid freeze-drying applied leads to the formation of different polymorphs in the finished product. 
However, this has been found acceptable as it does not impact significantly either on the stability or on 
the performance of the finished product (see active substance). Satisfactory operating parameters and 
in-process controls have been defined at each stage of manufacture. The maximum holding time has 
been adequately justified based on azacitidine degradation data and microbiological data. Furthermore, 
manufacturing at reduced temperatures minimizes the risk of increasing bioburden over the short time 
interval. 
Satisfactory validation data have been provided.  
  Product specification 
The  finished  product  specification  includes  tests  for  colour,  appearance,  foreign  matter,  identity  (Ph 
Eur), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), water content (PhEur), 
sterility (PhEur), bacterial endotoxins (PhEur) and colour and appearance of the reconstituted product. 
Batch analysis data provided comply with the specifications and indicate consistent and reproducible 
manufacture. 
  Stability of the product 
Stability of the Product before reconstitution 
Three  batches  of  lyophilized  powder  from  each  of  the  manufacturers  have  been  stored  for  up  to  4 
years (depending upon the manufacturing site), 1 year at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/65% RH and for 6 
months at 40°C/75% RH.  
All  of  the  testing  results  are  well  within  specification  for  product  stored  under  both  accelerated  and 
long-term  storage  conditions.  The  results  presented  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage 
conditions defined in the SPC for the finished product before and after reconstitution. 
In-use stability of the reconstituted solution 
The chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted medicinal product of NMT 45 min at 
25°C and NMT 8 hours at 2-8°C is accepted. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is 
adequate taken into account the properties and the  stability of the active substance. The  excipient is 
commonly  used  for  this  kind  of  formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The 
manufacturing  process  obtains  reproducible  finished  product  batches.  Stability  tests  under  ICH 
conditions indicate that the product is stable for the proposed shelf life.  
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion  there  were  some  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  which  had  no 
impact on the benefit/risk profile.

2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The non-clinical data are based on bibliographical information, applicant-sponsored studies and NCI-
sponsored studies. Most of the non-clinical studies were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s before the 
introduction  of  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  regulations  and  International  Conference  on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. 
Pharmacology 
  Primary pharmacodynamics  
As a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue designed to incorporate into RNA and DNA instead of cytidine, 
azacitidine has a broad spectrum of anti-metabolic effects. The primary pharmacodynamic effects of 
interest in the treatment of MDS are: 
- 
inhibition of DNA methylation.  
cytotoxicity  by  incorporation  of  azacitidine  into  DNA  and  RNA  and  inhibition  of  protein 
- 
synthesis. 
The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does 
not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis (10). 
  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted.  
  Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been submitted.  
  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Most  of  the  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  of  azacitidine  were  conducted  in  the  1960s  using 
non-specific  analytical  methods  available  at  that  time.  Through  a  programme  designed  to  assess  the 
oral  (p.o.)  route,  recent  pharmacokinetic  data  have  been  generated  in  2  animal  models:  in  mice, 
following radiolabelled azacitidine administered p.o and i.v. and in dogs treated with i.v., s.c. and p.o. 
azacitidine. 
  Analytical methods 
The  concentration  of  azacitidine  in  biological  samples  from  animal  studies  were  determined  by 
microbiological and/or radioisotope assays. 
Microbiological assays were conducted with Escherichia coli grown on plates. A standard curve was 
developed  to  plot  the  inhibitory  effect  against  azacitidine  concentration.  The  concentration/response 
curve  was  linear  between  the  concentrations  of  3.12  and  25 μg/ml  and  the  lowest  detectable 
concentration was 2 μg/ml. The limit of assay sensitivity was 0.11 μg/ml of mouse blood. Azacitidine 
was not detectable in solid tissues. 
Tissue  levels  of  azacitidine  were  measured  in  mice  following  14C-azacitidine  administration. 
Azacitidine-associated radioactivity was expressed as CPM (counts per minute) of 14CO2 released on 
combustion of 10 mg fresh tissue or 0.1 ml of blood. Tissue distribution in all major tissues, organs 
and biological fluids was determined using whole-body autoradiography. Tissue concentrations were 
interpolated from standard curves. 
LC-MS/MS methods were developed and validated to detect azacitidine in phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS)  over  the  concentration  range  24.4-1220 ng/ml  (0.1-5 µM)  and  in  dog  plasma  over  the 
concentration range of 1-1000 and 5-2000 ng/ml. The methods involved extraction of azacitidine from 
plasma samples with acetonitrile followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. 
  Absorption 
9/55 
No well-designed study was conducted to evaluate absorption of azacitidine through the s.c. route in 
animal.  In  one  study  performed  in  dogs,  partial  bioavailability  data  were  collected  and  the  absolute 
p.o.  bioavailability  was  approximately  67%  compared  with  the  s.c.  bioavailability  of  approximately 
71%.  There  were  no  consistent  gender  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  following  p.o. 
administration. Systemic exposure increased with increasing dose with little evidence of accumulation 
following repeat administration. Table 3 provides a summary of the available pharmacokinetic data in 
mouse and dog.

  Distribution 
The  first  tissue  distribution  study  in  AKR  mice  treated  i.p.  with  14C-azacitidine  showed  that 
radioactivity  declined  sharply  in  blood  during  the  first  8  hours  but  was  still  present  24  hours  after 
dosing.  Tissue  radioactivity  was  determined  in  thymus,  spleen,  kidney,  liver,  brain,  and  muscle. 
Concentrations  of  radioactivity  were  higher  and  retention  was  longer  in  spleen  and  thymus  than  in 
other tissues. Concentrations in kidney and liver were significantly less than in lymphoid tissues and 
only small amounts of radioactivity were recorded in muscle and brain. 
A  recent  tissue  distribution  study  was  conducted  in  ICR  mice  treated  p.o.  (50  mg/kg)  or  i.v. 
(10 mg/kg) with  14C-azacitidine (25). Using whole body autoradiography, tissues were examined for 
radioactivity content at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours after dosing. Radioactivity was widely distributed 
throughout  all  organs  and tissues.  Other  than  the excretory/metabolic  tissues  (which  include  kidney, 
liver, bile, gall bladder and urinary bladder) and the gastrointestinal system tissues, consequent levels 
of  radioactivity  were  recovered  in  spleen,  bone  marrow,  thymus,  pancreas,  adrenal  gland,  salivary 
gland,  lacrimal  gland,  prostate/uterus,  lung,  diaphragm  and  myocardium.  Most  tissues  showed 
maximal concentrations between 0.5 and 1 hour which declined steadily thereafter. At 48 hours, tissue 
concentrations of radioactivity were higher in i.v. treated animals than in those treated orally. 
  Metabolism 
Azacitidine is transported into the cell by the same facilitated nucleoside transport system as uridine 
and  cytidine.  Intracellular  azacitidine  undergoes  3  sequential  phosphorylation  reactions  resulting  in 
azacitidine  triphosphate.  The  first  phosphorylation  reaction,  the  rate-limiting  step  in  azacitidine 
metabolism, is mediated by the enzyme uridine-cytidine kinase (a.k.a. uridine kinase). This reaction is 
subject  to  feedback  inhibition  by  either  uridine  triphosphate  (UTP)  or  cytidine  triphosphate  (CTP). 
10/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Azacitidine triphosphate may then be incorporated into RNA and DNA resulting in the pharmacologic 
effects of demethylation and cytotoxicity. 
Catabolism of azacitidine is by spontaneous hydrolysis and by deamination. Spontaneous hydrolysis 
of azacitidine results in equilibration with n-formylguanylribosylurea (RGU-CHO) culminating in the 
irreversible formation of guanylribosylurea (RGU). The labile hydrolysis product, RGU-CHO, has a 
biological  activity  approximately  one-fourth  of  the  potency  of  azacitidine.  Although  the  RGU 
degradation product has not been completely characterised, it exhibited no pronounced toxicity using 
in vivo or in vitro test systems. 
Incubation of [14C] 5-azacitidine with mouse hepatic S9 fractions yielded 2 products (RGU-CHO and 
RGU); incubation with human hepatic S9 fractions produced an additional two additional compounds 
identified as ribofuranosylbiuret and formylamidinoribofuranosylbiuret. The formation of metabolites 
was independent of NADPH and occurred at the same rate with either hepatic S9 or denaturated S9 
preparations, implying that metabolism was catalysed by cytosolic enzymes. 
The  metabolic  stability  of  azacitidine  was  evaluated  in  heat-treated  and  untreated  intestinal  tissue 
homogenates prepared from dog, pig and human. All segments from the dog, pig and human intestinal 
tissues  exhibited  esterase  activities  and  showed  that  heat-treatment  abolished  or  reduced  such 
activities. 
  Excretion 
Limited data on the excretion of azacitidine in mice were presented in the paper by Raska et al. (23). 
Urinary excretion was studied in mice and dogs (table 3). In mice administered 14C-azacitidine i.p , 
approximately 45% of the radio-labelled compound was recovered in the urine. Moreover, recovery of 
14C-azacitidine delivered by p.o. or i.v. routes of administration demonstrated that the majority of the 
excreted  radioactivity  was  found  in  urine  (60.5  ±  6.6%  and  67±8.8%  of  the  dose,  respectively)  and 
only a fraction of the dose was recovered in the faeces (17.2±4.5% and 1.3±0.6%, respectively). An 
attempt was made to characterise the major metabolites found in urine with HPLC, GC and MS. Six 
radioactive peaks were identified as summarised in table 4 (29).

A  urinary  metabolic  profiling  study  was  also  performed  with  14C-azacitidine  in  dogs  dosed  at 
0.5 mg/kg i.v.. Recovery of radioactivity in urine during the 4-hour interval after dosing represented 
33% of the dose (30). The same 6 HPLC 14C peaks that were present in mice were present in the dog. 
  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The  potential  for  azacitidine  to  inhibit  human  hepatic  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes  has  been 
evaluated. The following enzymes were used in the evaluation: CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 
3A4. Azacitidine was not found to inhibit isozymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 at a 
maximal concentration of 100 µM (30-fold higher than clinically achievable plasma concentration of 
azacitidine following the recommended dose), although a low to moderate inhibition of CYP1A2 and 
2E1 was observed. In addition, the effects of azacitidine on the expression of cytochrome P450 were 
evaluated. Cultures of human hepatocytes were exposed to azacitidine at various concentrations for 72 
h.  Treatment  of  human  hepatocytes  with  azacitidine  did  not  cause  increased  activity  in  CYP1A2, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 but an unexpected inhibitory effect on 3A4/5 activity was observed at 100 
μM. The inhibitory effect was thought to be due to CYP 3A4/5 protein suppression.

  Genotoxicity 
A number of genotoxicity studies have been submitted in the format of bibliographical references (12, 
18,  39-48).  Azacitidine  had  both  mutagenic  and  clastogenic  activity  in  several  bacterial  and 
mammalian cell systems under the conditions tested. 
  Carcinogenicity 
Four of carcinogenicity studies have been submitted in the format of bibliographical references (49-
51).  Azacitidine  has  carcinogenic  potential  in  rodents  capable  of  inducing  tumours  in  a  variety  of 
organs (lymphoid system, lung, mammary gland, and skin).  
  Reproduction toxicity 
A number of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in mice (i.p.) and rats (i.p.) have been 
submitted in the format of bibliographical references (13, 19, 52-59). Azacitidine was associated with 
significant  risk  to  the  embryo,  foetus  and  male  reproduction  system.  The  reproductive  and 
developmental toxicity of azacitidine results from the cytotoxicity to rapidly dividing cells (S-phase) 
and alterations in gene expression. Spermatogenesis in rats is at risk because of the high level of cell 
proliferation. In embryofoetal development studies, azacitidine caused dose-dependant embryotoxicity 
and  teratogenicity  at  doses  as  low  as  0.3-0.5  mg/kg  (or  3  to  6  mg/m2).    Higher  doses  increased  the 
incidence of foetal malformations and embryolethality.  
  Local tolerance 
Local tolerance studies were conducted.  
  Other toxicity studies 
None submitted 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The majority of azacitidine given subcutaneously is excreted in the urine. The amount of azacitidine 
and its metabolites reaching the environment as a result of the administration of azacitidine powder for 
suspension  for  injection  is  not  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  significantly  change  the  quality  of  the 
human environment. As azacitidine is highly water soluble and the octanol/water partition coefficient 
(log  Ko/w)  is  less  than  0.5  over  a  pH  range  of  2-12,  the  compound  is  most  likely  to  amass 
predominantly in the aquatic environment. Emission patterns will consist mainly of a diffuse release 
into waste  water systems  due to excretion of the  active substance and/or its  metabolites by patients. 
Additional data on the ERA will be provided as a follow up measure.  
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Azacitidine  is  believed  to  exert  its  antineoplastic  effects  by  multiple  mechanisms  including 
cytotoxicity on abnormal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and hypomethylation of DNA. The 
cytotoxic  effects  of  azacitidine  may  result  from  multiple  mechanisms,  including  inhibition  of  DNA, 
RNA  and  protein  synthesis,  incorporation  into  RNA  and  DNA,  and  activation  of  DNA  damage 
pathways. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. Incorporation of azacitidine 
15/55 
 
into DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation of DNA. 
DNA  hypomethylation  of  aberrantly  methylated  genes  involved  in  normal  cell  cycle  regulation, 
differentiation  and  death  pathways  may  result  in  gene  re-expression  and  restoration  of  cancer-
suppressing  functions  to  cancer  cells.  The  relative  importance  of  DNA  hypomethylation  versus 
cytotoxicity or other activities of azacitidine to clinical outcomes has not been established. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. These are well known and described in 
the  literature.  Azacitidine  has  also  immunosuppressive,  antimicrobial,  genotoxic,  embryotoxic, 
teratogenic  and  carcinogenic  effects  (11-20).  These  secondary  effects  are  in  common  with  the 
pharmacologic activity of other pyrimidine analogues used as antiviral and antineoplastic agents (21). 
The absence of additional studies is considered acceptable. 
The  Applicant  has  provided  sufficient  justification  for  the  absence  of  specific  safety  pharmacology 
data. Therefore due to the abundance of clinical data together with the data from the dog toxicity study 
this omission is accepted. 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  studies  were  submitted.  This  is  acceptable  in  view  of  the 
monotherapy indication. Concurrent administration of azacitidine with other antineoplastic agents may 
affect the pharmacodynamics of either compound. 
Systemic  exposure  increased  with  increasing  dose  with  little  evidence  of  accumulation  following 
repeat  administration.  Radioactivity  was  widely  distributed  throughout  all  organs  and  tissues.  Most 
tissues showed maximal concentrations between 0.5 and 1 hour which declined steadily thereafter. In 
mice, recovery of 14C-azacitidine delivered by p.o. or i.v. routes of administration demonstrated that 
the majority of the excreted radioactivity was found in urine (60.5 ± 6.6% and 67±8.8% of the dose, 
respectively) and only a fraction of the dose was recovered in the faeces.  
No  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  were  performed  using  the  s.c.  route,  the  intended  route  of 
administration  in  humans.  Nevertheless,  the  results  obtained  from  i.v.  and  i.p.  administration  are 
considered adequate to characterise the systemic toxicity of azacitidine taking into account the known 
toxic profile of azacitidine. 
Azacitidine has both mutagenic and clastogenic activity. Azacitidine has carcinogenic potential. These 
findings are consistent with that of other nucleoside analogues. 
Azacitidine was associated with significant risk to the embryo, foetus and male reproduction system. 
Azacitidine should not be administered to pregnant women or women of childbearing potential. These 
constraints should also apply to men being treated with azacitidine whose partners are of childbearing 
potential.  These  risks  are  adequately  addressed  in  the  SPC.  MDS  is  a  disease  of  the  elderly  and, 
therefore, no offspring study has been performed. This omission is acceptable. 
Local tolerance studies were submitted. However, the findings from these studies were not relevant as 
none  of  these  studies  were  conducted  using  the  s.c.  route  of  administration.  Sufficient  data  are 
available from the toxicology studies and no further local tolerance studies are required. 
As  the  clinical  data  appears  to  be  sufficient  to  assess  dependency,  no  applicant-sponsored  animal 
studies have been conducted to assess the dependence potential of azacitidine. 
While  studies  have  been  submitted  to  assess  the  degradation  products  of  azacitidine,  no  toxicity 
studies  specifically  designed  to  assess  toxicity  of  individual  azacitidine  metabolites  have  been 
submitted. However, individual impurities have each been limited to 0.15% w/w to correspond with 
the qualification threshold identified by ICH Guidance Q3A (R2). 
The  environmental  risk  assessment  for  azacitidine  cannot  be  completed  based  on  the  assessment 
provided. The applicant committed to submit a phase II assessment as a follow-up measure. 
(CYPs),  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 
Based on in  vitro data,  azacitidine  metabolism does not appear to be  mediated by cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes 
(SULTs),  and 
glutathione  transferases  (GSTs);  interactions  related  to  these  metabolizing  enzymes  in  vivo  are 
therefore  considered  unlikely.  Clinically  significant  inhibitory  or  inductive  effects  of  azacitidine  on 
cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely (see SPC section 5.2). The applicant will conduct a new study 
to evaluate the interaction of azacitidine with CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 isozymes.

Clinical aspects 
16/55 
Introduction 
The clinical development of azacitidine was initiated by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), 
and  clinical  results  were  published  during  the  period  1989  to  2002.  The  main  clinical  study  in  this 
application is study AZA-001, an open-label, parallel-group, randomized, controlled phase 3 clinical 
trial  (AZA-PH-GL-2003-CL-001  later  named  AZA-001).  The  CHMP  granted  an  accelerated 
assessment  procedure  pursuant  to  Article  14  (9)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  for  Vidaza  on  24 
January  2008,  as  the  designation  of  an  unmet  medical  need  in  the  defined  patient  category  was 
fulfilled  (higher-risk-MDS  incidence  estimate  1-2/100,000).  Based  on  the  claims  and  description  of 
the available data provided by the applicant, the product was considered to be of major public health 
interest  from  the  viewpoint  that  it  might  provide  a  treatment  option  that  could  have  supplementary 
value  with  regard  to  the  present  therapeutic  arsenal  for  patients  with  MDS.  However,  due  to  major 
objections at D120, the application reverted to a normal timetable. 
The  proposed  route  of  administration  of  azacitidine  is  subcutaneous,  with  a  recommended  starting 
dose for MDS patients of 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days every 4 weeks. Azacitidine can be administered in 
an outpatient setting and patients should be monitored for haematologic and renal toxicities as dosage 
adjustments may be necessary. The duration of clinical use may be greater than one year. 
GCP 
Some  of  the  clinical  trials  were  originally  conducted  under  prior  to  implementation  of  ICH  GCP 
guidelines. The AZA-PH-GL-2003-CL-001 study was stated to be performed in accordance with GCP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The human pharmacokinetics of azacitidine was initially investigated in the 1970s following treatment 
of  patients  with  the  radiolabelled  drug.  More  recently,  study  AZA-2002-BA-002,  a  multicentre, 
randomised, open-label crossover design in 6 MDS patients comparing the pharmacokinetics of single 
2
dose  s.c.  versus  i.v.  doses  of  azacitidine  75 mg/m .  Additionally,  a  published  report  described  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  s.c.  administered  azacitidine  when  given  with  phenylbutyrate  (by  i.v.  infusion) 
(
62).  Supportive  studies  have  also  been  conducted  to  assess  azacitidine  interaction  with  cytochrome 
P450 enzymes. 
  Absorption 
Bioavailability 
In  study  AZA-2002-BA-002,  azacitidine  was  administered  to  6  MDS  patients.  Patients  received 
either a single dose of 75 mg/m2 administered either s.c. or i.v. over 10 minutes in a randomised 2-way 
crossover design. 
The mean plasma concentration versus time curves for s.c. and i.v. administrations of azacitidine are 
shown in Figure 1 and pharmacokinetic parameters are summarised in table 10.

Time (h)
Azacitidine was rapidly absorbed following s.c. administration with maximum plasma concentrations 
(Cmax)  of  750  ±  403  ng/ml  occurring  at  the  first  post-dose  sampling  time  (0.5  hour).  Following  i.v. 
infusion, Cmax was seen after 5 minutes in 2 of 6 patients and at the end of saline flush (11 minutes) in 
the remaining 4 patients.

was 89% (90% CI 70-112%). 
  Distribution 
Pharmacokinetics in study AZA-2002-BA-002 showed that the mean volume of distribution following 
i.v. dosing was 76 ± 26 l (0.99 ± 0.34 l/kg). 
  Elimination 
Excretion 
Excretion  of  azacitidine  and  metabolites  were  characterised  by  radiotracer  studies  in  patients  with 
advanced  cancer  following  both  i.v.  and  s.c.  administration  (63,  64).  Based  on  total  radioactivity  in 
plasma,  which  represented  parent  drug  plus  circulating  metabolites,  it  was  shown  that  kidneys 
excreted  azacitidine  and/or  its  metabolites,  with  50  (s.c.)  to  100%  (i.v.)  of  the  administered 
radioactivity recovered in the urine over 48 to 72 hours. Following i.v. administration, less than 1% 
was  excreted  in  the  faeces.  The  elimination  half-lives  in  this  study  were  similar  (3.4-6.2 hours)  for 
both modes of administration. 
In  study  AZA-2002-BA-002,  azacitidine  was  rapidly  eliminated  following  either  s.c.  or  i.v. 
administration.  The  mean  half-life  after  i.v.  administration  was  0.36  hours,  while  that  after  s.c. 
administration was slightly longer (0.69 hours). The apparent (s.c.) clearance (167 l/h or 2791 ml/min) 
and  systemic  (i.v.)  clearance  (147  l/h)  of  azacitidine  far  exceeded  literature  values  of  glomerular 
18/55 
 
 
 
 
 
filtration  rate  (approximately  125  ml/min)  and  total  renal  blood  flow  (1200  ml/min)  in  healthy 
patients.  
Metabolism 
No in vivo metabolism studies were submitted.  
Inter-conversion 
Upon reconstitution of the azacitidine medicinal product the conformation of the product were found 
to convert to pseudopolymorphic Form III. Form III is the bioavailable form since it is always formed 
in water regardless of the original polymorphic form of the active substance or medicinal product. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
No studies on the pharmacokinetics of metabolites were submitted. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
No data were submitted.  
  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
No  studies  on  dose  proportionality  have  been  submitted.  This  will  be  addressed  as  a  follow  up 
measure. 
Time dependency 
Based  on  preliminary  analyses,  the  plasma  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  azacitidine  following  7 
consecutive daily doses of azacitidine is essentially super-imposable upon the profile following single 
dose  treatment,  although  there  is  some  variability  at  very  low  concentrations  in  the  tail  end  of  the 
curves (see figure 2). The formal report will be submitted when completed.

following subcutaneous treatment (75 mg/m2)  
  Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.  This 
will be addressed as a follow up measure. 
Impaired hepatic function 
19/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied.  
Gender 
Safety subgroup analyses did not reveal any clinically relevant differences between genders. 
Race 
More  than  90%  of  the  patients  enrolled  in  the  CALGB  and  AZA  studies  were  Caucasian  and, 
therefore, no safety subgroup analysis for race could be made. 
Weight 
The effects of weight on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. 
Elderly 
The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. In the pivotal clinical 
Study AZA-001, a large proportion of patients was over 65 (84/179 > than 65; 38/179 > 75 years of 
age; maximum age, 88 years). Also in the earlier Studies CALGB 8921 and 9221, a large proportion 
of  patients  were  > 75  years  of  age.  Safety  subgroup  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  clinically  relevant 
differences between different age groups. 
Children 
The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been studied. 
  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine were not submitted.  
In  vitro  experimental  data  indicate  that  azacitidine  is  not  metabolised  via  CYPs,  UGTs,  SULTs  and 
GSTs.  Although,  clinical  interactions  involving  these  major  metabolism  pathways  are  not  expected, 
interaction of azacitidine with CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 will be addressed in future studies as a follow up 
measure. 
Pharmacodynamics 
No  clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  submitted.  A  review  of  published  non-clinical  data 
was presented to demonstrate the effect of azacitidine on DNA methylation, gene expression and cell 
differentiation in normal and neoplastic cells. 
The proposed dosage regimen of azacitidine, as used in the major studies supporting this MAA, was 
based on clinical results obtained in the studies CALGB 8421 and CALGB 8921. In the study CALGB 
8421, it was demonstrated that azacitidine is active in the treatment of higher-risk MDS when given 
IV or SC at 75 mg/m2/day for 7 consecutive days every 28 days. This dosage was initially based on the 
clinical  experience  earlier  obtained  with  azacitidine  at  140  mg/day,  for  the  treatment  of  sickle  cell 
anaemia and beta-thalassemia.  
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  azacitidine  were  studied  following  single  75  mg/m2
subcutaneous and intravenous administration. 
  doses  given  by 
Absorption 
Azacitidine  was  rapidly  absorbed  after  subcutaneous  administration  with  peak  plasma  azacitidine 
concentrations  of  750  ±  403  ng/ml  occurring  at  0.5  h  (the  first  sampling  point)  after  dosing.  The 
absolute  bioavailability  of  azacitidine  after  subcutaneous  relative  to  intravenous  administration  was 
approximately 89 % based on area under the curve (AUC). 
Distribution 
Following  intravenous  administration,  the  mean  volume  of  distribution  was  76  ±  26  l,  and  systemic 
clearance was 147 ± 47 l/h. 
Metabolism 
20/55 
 
Based on in  vitro data,  azacitidine  metabolism does not appear to be  mediated by cytochrome P450 
(SULTs),  and 
isoenzymes 
glutathione transferases (GSTs). 
(CYPs),  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 
(UGTs),  sulfotransferases 
Metabolism  of  azacitidine  is  by  spontaneous  hydrolysis  and  by  deamination  mediated  by  cytidine 
deaminase.  In  human  liver  S9  fractions,  formation  of  metabolites  was  independent  of  NADPH 
implying any metabolism would be catalysed by cytosolic enzymes. In vitro studies of azacitidine with 
cultured  human  hepatocytes  indicate  that  at  concentrations  of  1.0  μM  to  100  μM  (i.e.  up  to 
approximately  30-fold  higher  than  clinically  achievable  concentrations),  azacitidine  does  not  induce 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP) 1A2, 2C19, or 3A4 or 3A5. In a study to assess inhibition of a 
series  of  P450  isoenzymes  (CYP  1A2,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  2E1  and  3A4)  incubated  with  100  μM 
azacitidine,  IC50  values  could  not  be  determined,  therefore,  enzyme  inhibition  by  azacitidine  at 
clinically achievable plasma concentrations is unlikely.  
Excretion 
Azacitidine is cleared rapidly from plasma with a  mean elimination half-life (t½) after subcutaneous 
administration of 41 ± 8 minutes. Urinary excretion is the primary route of elimination of azacitidine 
and/or its metabolites. Following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of 14C-azacitidine, 50-
85 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine, while < 1 % was recovered in faeces. 
Special populations 
The  effects  of  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  (see  SPC  section  4.2),  gender,  age,  or  race  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of azacitidine have not been formally studied. 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  have  elucidated  that  the  renal  excretion  of  unchanged 
azacitidine  is  minor  and  that  spontaneous  hydrolysis  products  provides  a  major  portion  of  urinary 
metabolites.  Therefore,  it  is  not  anticipated  that  renal  impairment  will  significantly  alter  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  parent  azacitidine.  However,  as  the  kidney  does  play  a  significant  role  in  the 
excretion  of  azacitidine  and  its  metabolites,  a  study  to  assess  the  effects  of  renal  impairment  on  the 
disposition of azacitidine in adult cancer patients will be submitted. 
The  effects  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  azacitidine  have  not  been  studied. 
Azacitidine appears not to be metabolised by hepatic CYPs, UGTs, SULTs or GSTs and the proposed 
SPC advises caution in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Pharmacogenomics 
The  effect  of  known  cytidine  deaminase  polymorphisms  on  azacitidine  metabolism  has  not  been 
formally investigated. 
Plasma protein binding of azacitidine has not been directly evaluated.  
Azacitidine can reactivate latent viruses such as Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) in vitro (tissue culture) and 
can  induce  EBV  antigen  production  in  EBV+  patients  treated  with  azacitidine.  However,  no  link 
between  re-activation  of  latent  viruses  leading  to  overt  clinical  disease  in  patients  treated  with 
azacitidine has been found.  
No formal clinical drug interaction studies with azacitidine have been conducted. 
The  applicant  committed  to  submit  the  results  of  a  Phase  I,  Open-Label,  Dose-Escalation  Study  to 
Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Azacitidine in Subjects With 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, as a follow-up measure. 
Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  azacitidine  in  the  treatment  of  MDS  was  based  on  4  studies  (table  11):  the  pivotal 
study AZA-001, the Phase III supportive study CALGB 9221 and 2 additional Phase II uncontrolled 
studies CALGB 8921 and CALGB 8421.

  Dose response study (ies) 
The  proposed  dosage  regimen  of  azacitidine  is  based  on  clinical  results  obtained  in  the  supportive 
studies CALGB 8421 and CALGB 8921. It was demonstrated that azacitidine is active in the treatment 
of higher-risk MDS when given i.v. or s.c. at 75 mg/m2/day for 7 consecutive days every 28 days. This 
dosage was initially based on the clinical experience earlier obtained with azacitidine at 140 mg/day, 
for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia and beta thalassemia. 
Study AZA-001 and the Phase III study CALGB 9221 were initiated with the same starting dose for 
azacitidine  (75 mg/m2/day,  subcutaneously,  for  7  days,  q4w)  and  activity  was  observed  with  an 
acceptable toxicity profile.  
In  study  AZA-001,  bone  marrow  samples  for  methylation  testing  were  collected  for  assessing  the 
relationship  between  the  effect  of  azacitidine  with  DNA  demethylation  and  clinical  response  and/or 
adverse events. However, no proper dose response has been formally established. The effects of dose-
response  or  exposure-response  data  of  azacitidine  on  DNA  demethylation  effects  and  data  on  the 
relationship between a level of DNA demethylation and response rate and/or adverse events were not 
investigated in these trials. 
  Main study (ies) 
Study AZA-001 entitled “A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label, Parallel-Group, Phase 3 Trial of 
Subcutaneous Azacitidine Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Conventional Care Regimens Plus Best 
Supportive Care for the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)” is the main pivotal study 
submitted by the applicant to support the claimed indication for azacitidine. 
METHODS 
Study participants 
The study was a controlled, randomized, open label, parallel-group design Phase III study conducted 
in 79 sites from 15 countries. 
The main eligibility criteria were: 
-  Patients ≥ 18 years with a life expectancy ≥ 3 months 
-  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2 
- 
an  IPSS  classification  of  Intermediate-2  (INT-2)  or  high;  primary  MDS  diagnosed  as  RAEB  or 
RAEB-T  (FAB  classification)  or  CMMoL  (modified  FAB  classification)  with  monocytosis  in 
peripheral blood > 1 x 109/l, dysplasia in 1 or more myeloid cell lines, 10 to 29% blasts in the bone 
marrow, and white blood cells < 13,000 x 106/l 
- 
no prior treatment with transplantation or cytotoxic therapy 
22/55 
 
 
- 
unlikely to proceed to bone marrow or stem cell transplantation following remission. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio between the following 2 treatment groups: 
- 
- 
azacitidine 75 mg/m2 s.c. for 7 days every 28 days plus best supportive care (BSC) or 
conventional care treatment regimen (CCR) plus BSC. 
The conventional care treatment regimen consisted of 3 options (one of which was to be determined 
for all patients by the investigator prior to randomisation to avoid potential bias): 
-  BSC only 
-  BSC in addition to low-dose cytarabine SC for 20 mg/m2/day for 14 days every 28 to 42 days until 
the end of the study or 
-  BSC in addition to standard chemotherapy administered for induction, as a continuous intravenous 
infusion  of  cytarabine  100  to  200  mg/m2/day  IV  for  7  days  with  an  anthracycline  (daunorubicin, 
idarubicin  or  mitoxantrone)  on  Day  1,  2  and  3  and  for  those  eligible,  1  or  2  consolidation  cycles 
administered  as  continuous  intravenous  infusions  of  cytarabine  for  3  to  7  days  with  the  same 
anthracycline that was used at induction on days 1 and 2 (each cycle between 28 to 70 days from the 
start of the previous cycle). 
Eligible patients were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups with stratification by FAB and IPSS 
classification (RAEB/INT-2, RAEB/high, RAEB-T/INT-2, or RAEB-T/high) (patients diagnosed with 
CMMoL  were  to  be  randomized  to  the  FAB  stratum  of  RAEB  or  RAEB-T  based  on  their  bone 
marrow blast counts: those with counts 10% to 20% as RAEB, those with 21% to 29% as RAEB-T). 
Treatment options in the conventional care regimens were assigned by the investigator based on local 
practice  and  on  evaluation  of  the  patient’s  underlying  disease  condition  at  the  time  of  screening. 
Treatment assignment was not changed after randomisation. 
Objectives 
Primary study objective was to determine the effect of azacitidine plus BSC as compared with CCR 
plus BSC on overall survival in MDS patients. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  determine  the  effect  of  azacitidine  plus  BSC,  relative  to  that  of  CCR 
plus BSC, on: 
- 
time to AML transformation or death from any cause.  
- 
time-to-transformation  to  AML  defined  as  the  number  of  days  from  the  date  of  randomisation 
until  the  date  of  documented  AML  transformation,  defined  as  a  bone  marrow  blast  count  ≥  30% 
independent of baseline bone marrow count and censored at death 
- 
haematologic status (peripheral counts, need for platelet and red blood cell transfusions and status

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival as defined as defined as the number of days from 
the date of randomisation until the date of death from any cause. 
The secondary endpoints were time to transformation to AML (bone marrow blast > 30% ) or death, 
time to transformation to AML, haematologic response (and improvements) and cytogenetic response 
based on 2000 IWG criteria for MDS, time to disease progression, relapse after CR or PR or death, 
transfusion status and number of on-treatment AE of severe infection.

Sample size 
The protocol specified that 354 patients were to be randomised over an estimated period of 18-months 
and  monitored  for  at  least  12  months  of  treatment  and  follow-up.  This  would  result  in  about 
167 deaths  after  study  duration  of  30  months.  A  log  rank  analysis  of  167  deaths  would  have 
approximately 90% power to detect a difference in overall survival curves characterised by a hazard 
ratio of 0.60 (median overall survival of 18.3 months for azacitidine and 11 months for CCR). 
Randomisation 
This  study  used  blocked  randomisation  that  stratified  patients  by  FAB  and  IPSS  classifications  to 
ensure a balanced assignment of patients to the 2 treatment groups. This randomisation process used a 
remote centralised system. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study is an open-label study, but the haematological response (and its duration) for the primary 
analysis  (though  not  haematological 
the  FAB  and  WHO  diagnoses,  IPSS 
classifications and IWG was performed by a blinded independent central reviewer. 
improvement), 
Statistical methods 
For purposes of time-to-event analyses involving death and transformation to AML, the duration was 
defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the minimum of the date of death or the date of 
censor. The date of censor could be due to administrative censoring (for interim or final analysis), date 
of last contact if the patient was lost to follow-up or date the patient withdrew consent from follow-up. 
For  the  analyses  during  the  treatment  period,  the  censor  date  could  have  been  the  patient’s  last 
treatment study visit (if this was the minimum date among date of death, AML or last contact).

Recruitment 
The  trial  enrolled  738  patients  and  randomised  358  over  30  months  and  the  study  duration  lasted 
44 months. This resulted in 195 deaths (16.8% more deaths than originally planned) and 95% power 
for this trial under the design assumptions of the protocol. 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, 30.2% of patients treated with azacitidine and 39.1% treated with CCR had at least 1 major 
protocol deviation. The most frequently observed protocol deviations are presented in table 12.

The  PP  population  consisted  of  234  (65.4%)  patients,  54  patients  in  the  azacitidine-treatment  group 
and 70 in the CCR group eventually encountered ≥ 1 major protocol violation and were excluded from 
the per protocol population (table 12). 
The safety population is comprised of 340 (95.0%) patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and had at least one post-dose safety assessment. Because BSC-only treatment may consist of blood 
products  or  antibiotics  administered  only  as  needed,  patients  randomised  to  the  CCR  group  and 
assigned to BSC-only were included in the safety population if they had at least 1 post-randomisation 
assessment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  an  analysis  of  OS  (time-to-death  from  any  cause)  for  the  ITT 
population by treatment group as defined by the number of days from randomization date until death 
by  any  cause,  is  provided  in  table  16.  A  Kaplan  Meier  plot  of  time  to  death  from  any  cause  by 
treatment group for the ITT population is presented in figure 4.

The Kaplan Meier median overall survival times were 24.5 months and 15.0 months in the azacitidine 
and combined CCR groups, respectively. Azacitidine was statistically superior to the combined CCR 
group for prolonging survival, with an increase in median survival of 9.4 months (stratified log rank p 
=  0.0001).  The  Kaplan  Meier  time  to  the  first  quartile  was  10.5  and  5.1  months  for  azacitidine  and 
combined CCR, respectively, for a difference of 4.8 months (95% CI 0.8, 8.7 months; p = 0.0178). 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed.  Each  set  of  CCR  subgroup  patients  have  been  compared  with 
either a) all  azacitidine recipients or b) the set of  azacitidine recipients that would have received the 
same CCR treatment if they had been randomised to the control group. Similar to the ITT analysis, the 
Kaplan  Meier  median  time-to-death  was  longer  in  each  of  the  azacitidine  groups  (by  approximately 
9.5 months) compared with the CCR groups within each selection group and the risk of death in the 
azacitidine  group  was  reduced  compared  with  CCR.  The  difference  in  the  survival  curves  was 
statistically different in the BSC selection group; they were not statistically different in the low-dose 
cytarabine and standard chemotherapy selection groups due to the low patient numbers.

An analysis in the PP population by treatment group provided similar survival advantage as observed 
in the ITT population (10.1 vs. 9.4 months, respectively). 
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no meaningful changes to the conclusions regarding the effect of 
azacitidine on overall survival. 
Figure 5: Hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for overall survival by subgroup for 
azacitidine versus combined CCR (ITT population) 
The effect of treatment on the primary endpoint was performed for the pre-specified subgroups of age, 
gender,  FAB  classification,  FAB  classification  and  ≥  65  years  old,  WHO  classification,  IPSS,  IPSS 
cytogenetic  risk  group,  IPSS  cytopenia  risk  group,  IPSS  bone  marrow  blast  risk  group,  -7/del(7q) 
karyotype and LDH and showed that the azacitidine group had a reduced risk of death compared with 
patients in the combined CCR group for all subgroups (the ITT hazard ratio [0.58] is included within 
the confidence interval of all subgroups) (see figure 5).

For the secondary efficacy endpoints, time to transformation to AML or death showed consistent 
results where a median of 13.02 months compared to 7.61 months was observed in the azacitidine and 
combined CCR group, respectively, a difference of 5.41 months. Similar results were obtained in time 
–to–transformation to AML only.   
Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no meaningful changes to the conclusions regarding the effect of 
azacitidine on time –to–transformation to AML. 
The mean haemoglobin concentration in the azacitidine and CCR groups is depicted in figure 6. 
The total number of RBC transfusions was 1799 in the azacitidine group and 1754 in the CCR group. 
When taken into account the number of patient-years, the RBC transfusion rate favoured azacitidine 
group:  10.63  and  18.33  per  patient-year  for  azacitidine-  and  the  CCR  group,  respectively.  Of  the 
111 patients in the azacitidine group who were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline, 45.0% of these 
patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4% of 
the patients in the combined CCR group (p < 0.0001). The 33.6% difference (95% CI 22.4, 44.6) was 
statistically significant (p<0.0001).

The number of platelet transfusions per patient-year was slightly higher in the combined CCR group 
(9.4)  compared  with  the  azacitidine  group  (6.0).  The  percentage  of  patients  who  were  platelet 
transfusion  dependent  at  baseline  and  became  platelet  transfusion  independent  during  the  treatment 
period  was  similar  in  the  azacitidine  (42.1%)  and  CCR  group  (40.7%)  but  remained  longer  platelet 
transfusion  independent  (approximately  7 months)  in  the  azacitidine  group.  In  patients  who  were 
platelet  transfusion  independent  at  baseline,  89.4%  of  the  azacitidine  patients  remained  platelet 
transfusion  independent  during  the  treatment  period,  compared  with  67.1%  of  the  patients  in  the 
combined CCR group (p < 0.0001).

b  Haematologic improvement and cytogenetic response were determined by the IRC 
As determined by the IRC, the overall response rate (CR + PR + SD) was 91% in the azacitidine group 
compared with 78% in the combined CCR group; a statistically significant difference (p =0.0011). The 
median time to disease progression, relapse after CR or PR, or death from any cause was longer in the 
azacitidine group (14.1 months) compared with the combined CCR group (8.8 months), with a median 
increase of 5.3 months with azacitidine treatment (log rank p = 0.0466) investigators assessment. The 
percentage  of  patients  in  the  azacitidine  group  (49%)  with  any  haematologic  improvement  was  1.5-
fold higher compared with the combined CCR group (29%).  
The percentage of patients in the azacitidine group (40%) with a major erythroid response was 3.5-fold 
higher  compared  with  the  combined  CCR  group  (11%).  Similarly,  the  percentage  of  patients  in  the 
azacitidine group (33%) with a major platelet response was 2-fold higher compared with the combined 
CCR group (14%). The median duration of haematologic improvement was longer in the azacitidine

group (13.6 months) compared with the CCR group (5.2 months) (log rank p = 0.0002). The hazard 
ratios of recurrent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 1.16 and 0.95 when azacitidine group was 
compared  to  the  CCR  group.  The  risk  of  recurrent  anaemia  was  reduced  by  11%  in  the  azacitidine 
group compared with the combined CCR group (HR 0.89, p=0.0094). 
Figure 8 provides a plot of mean absolute neutrophil counts over time in the azacitidine and combined 
CCR groups. 
The percentage of patients with a major neutrophil response was similar in the azacitidine (19%) and 
combined CCR (18%) groups. The mean WBC curves for the azacitidine and combined CCR groups 
were generally similar until approximately 17 months, when the number of patients in the CCR group 
became  small.  The  azacitidine  group  generally  remained  constant  until  the  30th  month,  when  the 
number of patients became small.

Study AZA-001 – Mean absolute neutrophil counts over time (ITT) 
The rate of infection requiring i.v. antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral therapy was 1.5-fold higher in the 
combined CCR group compared with the azacitidine group. There were 27 adverse events of infection 
that  required  therapy  during  169  patient-years  for  a  rate  of  0.16  events  per  patient-year  in  the 
azacitidine  group  compared  with  23  adverse  events  of  infection  during  96  patient-years  at  a  rate  of 
0.24 events per patient-year in the CCR group. The relative risk of such infections was 0.67 (95% CI 
0.35, 1.20; p = 0.1327) indicating 33% less risk of such infections for the azacitidine group relative to 
the CCR group. The risk of recurrent of infection requiring IV treatment was reduced by 11 and 21% 
in the azacitidine group and with the CCR-group, respectively. The reduced risk of infection was not 
statistically significantly different between the two groups. 
  Supportive study (ies) 
Supportive  studies  comprise  one  open-label,  controlled,  Phase  III  study  (study  CALGB  9221)  and 
2 open-label, uncontrolled, Phase II studies (studies CALGB 8421 and CALGB 8921). In these studies 
the primary endpoint was defined as the overall response rate (CR + PR). 
Study CALGB 8421 initially planned for enrolment of up to 20 patients; however, based on the results 
of the first 13 patients, the enrolment goal was extended to 45 patients. Eventually 48 patients were 
enrolled to receive azacitidine 75 mg/m2 as a continuous IV infusion for 7 days on a 28-day cycle for a 
minimum of 4 cycles. 
35/55 
 
 
 
 
Study CALGB 8921 initially planned for enrolment of up to 50 patients over the period of 1.5 years; 
patients were to receive 75 mg/m2 azacitidine SC daily for 7 days on a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 
4 cycles. A total of 72 patients were included as ITT population. The mean and median total duration 
of  clinical  response  of  PR  or  better  for  the  responders  was  565 days  (1.5  years)  and  117  days, 
respectively. The median survival times of the responders and of the non-responders were 39.3 and 9.6 
months, respectively. The median times-to-transformation to AML of the responders (excluding AML 
patients)  and  the  non-responders  were  59.1  and  21.8  months,  respectively.  Other  than  Month  12, 
responders  were  transfusion-free  from  the  10th  to  month  18.  Haemoglobin  concentrations  increased 
after the 2nd for all patients. 
Study  CALGB  9221  was  an  open-label,  multicentre,  controlled,  Phase  III  trial,  initiated  in  1994, 
designed  to  compare  azacitidine  plus  supportive  care  with  an  observation  group  receiving  best 
supportive care only in patients with any of the 5 subtypes of MDS per the FAB classification (RA, 
RARS, RAEB, RAEB-T, or CMMoL). The use of a BSC-only group as a control was chosen because 
at the time the study was conducted, there was no approved treatment for MDS. A total of 191 patients 
(99 azacitidine, all of which received study medication, 92 observation) were enrolled and randomised 
in the study at 53 centres. Patients in the azacitidine treatment arm were to receive a starting dose of 
75 mg/m2 azacitidine SC daily for 7 days on a 28-day cycle for a minimum of 4 cycles. 
The primary endpoint, overall response rate, in azacitidine group was 16.2% compared to 0% in the 
observation  group.  The  mean  time  to  transformation  to  AML  in  the  azacitidine  group  was  45.8 
months, compared with 23.5 months for the observation group (p=0.16). Median survival time, which 
was confounded by the cross-over design of this study, for the azacitidine group and observation group 
were respectively 20.1 months and 15.4 months (statistically not significant).

  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  of  Vidaza  were  studied  in  an  international,  multicenter,  controlled, 
open-label,  randomised,  parallel-group,  Phase  3  comparative  study  (AZA  PH  GL  2003  CL  001)  in

System (IPSS), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anaemia with excess blasts 
in transformation (RAEB-T) and modified chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (mCMML) according 
to  the  French  American  British  (FAB)  classification  system.  RAEB-T  patients  (21-30  %  blasts)  are 
now  considered  to  be  AML  patients  under  the  current  WHO  classification  system.  Azacitidine  plus 
best  supportive  care  (BSC)  (n  =  179)  was  compared  to  conventional  care  regimens  (CCR).  CCR 
consisted  of  BSC  alone  (n  =  105),  low-dose  cytarabine  plus  BSC  (n  =  49)  or  standard  induction 
chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25). Patients were pre-selected by their physician to 1 of the 3 CCR prior 
to randomisation. Patients received this pre-selected regimen if not randomised to Vidaza. As part of 
the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 0-2. Patients with secondary MDS were excluded from the study. The primary 
endpoint of the study was overall survival. Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 
75 mg/m2
 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median 
of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 cycles. Within the Intent to Treat population (ITT), the 
median age was 69 years (range 38 to 88 years). 
In the ITT analysis of 358 patients (179 azacitidine and 179 CCR), Vidaza treatment was associated 
with  a  median  survival  of  24.46  months  versus  15.02  months  for  those  receiving  CCR  treatment,  a 
difference  of  9.4  months,  with  a  stratified  log-rank  p-value  of  0.0001.  The  hazard  ratio  for  the 
treatment effect was 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.43, 0.77). The two-year survival rates were 50.8 % in patients 
receiving azacitidine versus 26.2 % in patients receiving CCR (p < 0.0001). 
The survival benefits of Vidaza were consistent regardless of the CCR treatment option (BSC alone, 
low-dose cytarabine plus BSC or standard induction chemotherapy plus BSC) utilised in the control 
arm. 
When IPSS cytogenetic subgroups were analysed, similar findings in terms of median overall survival 
were  observed  in  all  groups  (good,  intermediate,  poor  cytogenetics,  including  monosomy  7).  On 
analyses of age subgroups, an increase in median overall survival was observed for all groups (< 65 
years, ≥ 65 years and ≥ 75 years). 
Vidaza  treatment  was  associated  with  a  median  time  to  death  or  transformation  to  AML  of  13.0 
months versus 7.6 months for those receiving CCR treatment, an improvement of 5.4 months with a 
stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0025. 
Vidaza  treatment  was  also  associated  with  a  reduction  in  cytopenias,  and  their  related  symptoms. 
Vidaza  treatment  led  to  a  reduced  need  for  red  blood  cell  (RBC)  and  platelet  transfusions.  Of  the 
patients  in  the  azacitidine  group  who  were  RBC  transfusion  dependent  at  baseline,  45.0  %  of  these 
patients became RBC transfusion independent during the treatment period, compared with 11.4 % of 
the patients in the combined CCR groups (a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) difference of 33.6 % 
(95  %  CI:  22.4,  44.6).  In  patients  who  were  RBC  transfusion  dependent  at  baseline  and  became 
independent, the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13 months in the azacitidine 
group. 
Response was assessed by the investigator or by the Independent Review Committee (IRC). Overall 
response (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) as determined by the investigator was 29 
% in the azacitidine group and 12 % in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0001). Overall response (CR 
+ PR) as determined by the IRC in AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 was 7  % (12/179) in the azacitidine 
group compared with 1 % (2/179) in the combined CCR group (p = 0.0113). The differences between 
the  IRC  and  investigator  assessments  of  response  were  a  consequence  of  the  International  Working 
Group  (IWG)  criteria  requiring  improvement  in  peripheral  blood  counts  and  maintenance  of  these 
improvements  for  a  minimum  of  56  days.  A  survival  benefit  was  also  demonstrated  in  patients  that 
had  not  achieved  a  complete/partial  response  following  azacitidine  treatment.  Haematological 
improvement (major or minor) as determined by the IRC was achieved in 49 % of patients receiving 
azacitidine compared with 29 % of patients treated with combined CCR (p < 0.0001). 
In patients with one or more cytogenetic abnormalities at baseline, the percentage of patients with a 
major  cytogenetic  response  was  similar  in  the  azacitidine  and  combined  CCR  groups.  Minor 
cytogenetic response was statistically significantly (p = 0.0015) higher in the azacitidine group (34 %) 
compared with the combined CCR group (10 %).  
37/55 
Only  patients  with  de  novo  disease  were  allowed  entry  into  the  AZA-001  study.  Therefore  it  is  not 
possible to assess whether there are any differences in the treatment effect between patients with de 
novo  and  secondary  syndromes.  The  applicant  committed  to  include  patients  with  secondary 
syndromes in future studies. 
Clinical safety 
Azacitidine,  a  cytidine  analogue  that  is  incorporated  into  DNA  and  RNA,  can  be  toxic  to  rapidly 
dividing  cells,  especially  cells  that  form  the  haematopoietic  system  and  mucosal  tissue  such  as  the 
gastrointestinal tract. Additional toxic effects can be expected due to the demethylating capacity of the 
active substance. 
  Patient exposure 
Although the total number of patients who received azacitidine in completed clinical MDS studies at 
the  time  of  submission  is  limited  to  449  patients  (table  20),  the  body  of  safety  information  can  be 
further enlarged by data from patients who have received azacitidine in presently ongoing studies (204 
patients) and from the large number of patients who have received azacitidine and included in other 
data  sources  (approximately  26,938  patients).  The  combined  estimated  total  of  27,591  patients 
provides an extensive experience with azacitidine.

In study AZA-001, of the 358 randomised patients, 340 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and  had  at  least  1  post-dose  safety  assessment  (in  the  BSC-only  group,  safety  evaluable  patients 
received  at  least  1  post-randomisation  safety  assessment).  Baseline  FAB  classifications  as  used  in 
study  AZA-001  were  applied  similarly  in  the  CALGB  studies  in  which  most  patients  had  an 
adjudicated  baseline  diagnosis  of  RAEB  or  RAEB-T  except  for  study  CALGB  9221  which  also 
included patients with RA and RARS. 
In study AZA-001, the majority of patients (86.3%, 151/175) remained on 75 mg/m2 throughout the 
study and few patients required a reduction of their azacitidine dose. In the CALGB studies, increases 
up to 100 mg/m2/day were allowed. 
Patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction were excluded from the studies; therefore, there is limited 
information on these patient populations. 
Patient exposure is presented in table 21.

The  median  prescribed  dose  of  each  of  the  standard  chemotherapy  drugs  in  both  the  induction  and 
consolidation  cycles  was  also  consistent  with  the  protocol:  for  cytarabine,  100 mg/m2  for  induction 
and  200  mg/m2  for  consolidation;  and  for  daunorubicin,  60  mg/m2  for  both  induction  and 
consolidation;  for  idarubicin,  12  mg/m2  for  induction  and  10.5  mg/m2  for  consolidation.  Mean 
prescribed  doses  were  similar  to  the  medians  with  the  exception  of  the  mean  prescribed  dose  for 
cytarabine during consolidation, 389.9 mg/m2 (as the results of accidental overdose in one patient). 
Adjustments in azacitidine dose occurred in 24 patients (13.7%) and in 22 patients (12.6%), toxicity 
lead to discontinuation of study treatment. Moreover, 82 (46.9%) patients had a dose interruption.

The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  for  patients  receiving  azacitidine  in  the  CALGB  studies  were 
anaemia,  nausea  and  thrombocytopenia  (within  study  CALGB  9221,  the  percentage  of  event  of 
anaemia was similar to that of the BSC group). System organ classes (SOC) were similar in studies 
CALGB  8921/9221  (SC)  and  CALGB  8421  (IV),  except  for  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders 
which were more frequent in study 8421. 
In an analysis of TEAE by cycle onset for azacitidine in study AZA-001, findings suggested that the 
first occurrence of events of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, constipation, nausea, injection 
site  erythema  and  injection  site  reaction  were  reported  most  often  in  Cycles  1  and  2;  this  was 
consistent  in  the  CALGB  studies.  The  most  common  events  (>  20.0%)  reported  in  the  azacitidine 
group during Cycles 1 and 2 included those generally associated with the known effects of this drug: 
thrombocytopenia (54.3%), neutropenia (50.3%), constipation (35.4%), nausea (35.4%), injection site 
erythema  (34.9%),  anaemia  (32.6%)  and  injection  site  reaction  (20.6%);  by  Cycles  5  and  6,  the 
percentages  of  these  events  ranged  from  0  (nausea)  to  6.9%  (anaemia).  Within  the  cycle,  the  first 
occurrence  of  the  haematology  events  (thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  anaemia)  occurred  most 
often  within  the  first  3  weeks  of  the  cycle  in  these  studies.  Events  typically  associated  with 
injection  site 
administration  of  azacitidine, 
erythema/reaction/pain,  occurred  within  the  first  week  of  the  cycle,  coinciding  with  the  days  of 
treatment. 
including  nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  and 
When  TEAE  were  summarised  by  dose  in  studies  AZA-001  and  CALGB,  events  of  neutropenia, 
anaemia, nausea, vomiting, constipation and injection site reactions tended to be reported at increasing 
frequencies at higher doses of azacitidine. In study AZA-001, this tendency was also present with the 
reporting of events of thrombocytopenia. 
The most frequent treatment-related events in the azacitidine treatment group are consistent with those 
most often reported from the all TEAEs and listed in the SmPC. The treatment-related events between 
the treatment groups are also consistent. All of the TEAEs listed are either known effects of the active 
substances  used  in  the  study  or  were  associated  with  the  SC  administration  of  azacitidine  (injection 
site erythema/reaction/pain). 
In  study  AZA-001,  there  were  no  patients  that  had  their  dose  of  azacitidine  reduced,  interrupted  or 
discontinued  due  to  renal  toxicities.  However,  abnormalities  in  hepatic  function  lead  to  treatment 
interruption and increased circulating enzymes lead to dose reduction.

a  Multiple reports of the same preferred term or system organ class for a patient are counted only once within each treatment 
group 
  Laboratory findings 
Consistent  with  the  TEAE  and  efficacy  analyses  in  study  AZA-001,  analyses  of  haematology 
parameters over time confirmed that azacitidine has an effect on haematologic parameters. The median 
time  to  nadir  values  across  haematology  parameters  was  14  to  15  days  for  patients  treated  with 
azacitidine  (compared  with  17  to  21  days  for  patients  treated  with  low-dose  cytarabine  and  17  to 
23 days for patients treated with standard chemotherapy). The reduction in haemoglobin and platelets 
diminished  over  time  due  to  the  cytotoxic  effect  of  azacitidine.  The  median  haemoglobin  values  in 
patients treated with azacitidine improved over time, an effect that was not evident with BSC-only. 
Laboratory  analyses  of  chemistry  data  in  study  AZA-001,  including  electrolytes  and  measures  of 
hepatic and renal function, showed that even after prolonged administration, azacitidine had no effects 
on renal or liver function and had only very minor effects on electrolytes over time, which were also 
evident  in  the  BSC-only  group.  Hyperbilirubinaemia  was  reported  in  3  patients  in  the  azacitidine 
treatment group (3/175), but not in the other treatment groups. All of these events were reported within 
the first 3 cycles, and were either Grade 2 or Grade 3 events. In one patient this hyperbilirubinaemia 
appeared unresolved. 
The CALGB studies showed similar results. 
  Safety in special populations 
No specific studies have been conducted in hepatic and renal impairment, pregnancy and lactation, or 
in  children  and  adolescent.  However,  TEAE  were  analysed  by  age,  gender,  baseline  creatinine, 
albumin, bilirubin and FAB, WHO and IPSS. 
In  the  azacitidine  group,  similar  percentages  of  individual  TEAEs  were  noted  for  the  majority  of 
TEAEs  across  the  age  categories.  Although  there  are  2-fold  differences  in  the  frequencies  of 
individual TEAEs between the older age groups (≥ 65 years or ≥ 75 years) compared with < 65 years 
in the azacitidine group, there does not appear to be any clinically relevant differences based on age. 
Also,  with  regard  to  gender,  although  there  are  2-fold  differences  in  the  frequencies  of  individual 
TEAEs between males and females in the azacitidine group, there does not appear to be any clinically 
relevant differences based on gender.

  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been performed. 
  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  Study  AZA-001,  the  overall  percentage  of  patients  with  a  TEAE  leading  to  discontinuation  of 
azacitidine and BSC were 12.6% (22/175) and 3.9% (4/102) respectively. In the CALGB studies, the 
overall  percentage  ranged  from  18.0  to  31.3%.  In  the  MDS  studies,  the  most  common  reason  for 
discontinuation of azacitidine was due to haematological TEAEs (occurring in < 5% of patients). In 
Study  AZA-001,  no  patient  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  any  of  the  common  non 
haematological toxicities (i.e., nausea/vomiting or injection site reactions). 
Treatment was not discontinued in any patient in clinical pharmacology study. 
  Post-marketing experience 
From  a  review  on  data  from  other  additional  clinical  studies,  from  compassionate-use,  from 
post-marketing  data,  most  frequently  reported  AE  were  haematological  (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia),  gastrointestinal  events  (nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhoea) 
and injection site reactions (erythema, pain, bruising). 
Most  often  causes  of  death  were  due  to  haematological  toxicity,  infectious  complications  and 
bleeding. 
Hepatic and renal adverse events were reported infrequently. However, based on early investigations 
with  azacitidine  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic  agents  or  at  higher  doses,  renal  abnormalities, 
including elevated serum creatinine, renal tubular acidosis and renal failure were reported. Published 
reports also described an association between azacitidine and hepatic fatal failure in patients with solid 
tumours and hepatic metastasis, especially those with albumin < 30 g/l. 
  Discussion on clinical safety 
Vidaza treatment should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced 
in the use of chemotherapeutic agents. Patients should be premedicated with anti-emetics for nausea 
and vomiting. 
Vidaza is contraindicated in the following situations: Known hypersensitivity to the active substance 
or  to  any  of  the  excipients,  advanced  malignant  hepatic  tumours  (see  SPC  section  4.4),  or  lactation 
(see SPC section 4.6). 
Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of Vidaza have 
occurred  in  97  %  of  patients.  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  with  azacitidine 
treatment  were  haematological  reactions  (71.4  %)  including  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia  and 
leukopenia (usually Grade 3-4), gastrointestinal events (60.6 %) including nausea, vomiting (usually 
Grade 1-2) or injection site reactions (77.1 %; usually Grade 1-2).  
The most common serious adverse reactions (> 2 %) noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 
CL  001)  and  also  reported  in  the  supporting  studies  (CALGB  9221  and  CALGB  8921)  included 
febrile  neutropenia  (8.0  %)  and  anaemia  (2.3  %).  Other  less  frequently  reported  serious  adverse 
reactions (< 2 %) included neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events 
(e.g. cerebral haemorrhage). 
Haematologic adverse reactions 
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  associated  with  azacitidine  treatment  were 
haematological including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia, and were usually Grade 3 or 
4. There is a greater risk of these events occurring during the first 2 cycles, after which they occur with 
less  frequency  in  patients  with  restoration  of  haematological  function.  Most  haematological  adverse 
reactions  were  managed  by  routine  monitoring  of  complete  blood  counts  and  delaying  azacitidine 
administration in the next cycle, prophylactic antibiotics and/or growth factor support (e.g. G-CSF) for 
neutropenia and transfusions for anaemia or thromobocytopenia as required. 
Infections 
44/55 
Myelosuppression  may  lead  to  neutropenia  and  an  increased  risk  of  infection.  Serious  adverse 
reactions  such  as  neutropenic  sepsis  (0.8  %)  and  pneumonia  (2.5  %)  were  reported  in  patients 
receiving  azacitidine.  Infections  may  be  managed  with  the  use  of  anti-infectives  plus  growth  factor 
support (e.g. G-CSF) for neutropenia. 
Bleeding 
Bleeding  may  occur  with  patients  receiving  azacitidine.  Serious  adverse  reactions  such  as 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  (0.8  %)  and  intracranial  haemorrhage  (0.5  %)  have  been  reported. 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding, particularly those with pre-existing 
or treatment-related thrombocytopenia. 
Hypersensitivity 
Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  (0.25  %)  have  been  reported  in  patients  receiving  azacitidine.  In 
case of an anaphylactic-like reaction, treatment with azacitidine should be immediately discontinued 
and  appropriate  symptomatic  treatment  initiated.  The  majority  of  skin  and  subcutaneous  adverse 
reactions were associated with the injection site. None of these adverse reactions led to temporary or 
permanent  discontinuation  of  azacitidine,  or  reduction  of  azacitidine  dose  in  the  pivotal  study.  The 
majority of adverse reactions occurred during the first 2 cycles and tended to decrease with subsequent 
cycles.  Subcutaneous  adverse  reactions  such  as  injection  site  rash/inflammation/pruritus,  rash, 
erythema  and  skin  lesion  may  require  management  with  concomitant  medicinal  products,  such  as 
antihistamines, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
The most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment 
included  constipation,  diarrhoea,  nausea  and  vomiting.  These  adverse  reactions  were  managed 
symptomatically  with  anti-emetics  for  nausea  and  vomiting;  antidiarrhoeals  for  diarrhoea,  and 
laxatives and/or stool softeners for constipation. 
Overdose 
One  case  of  overdose  with  azacitidine  was  reported  during  clinical  trials.  A  patient  experienced 
diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting after receiving a single intravenous dose of approximately 290 mg/m2, 
almost  4  times  the  recommended  starting  dose.  In  the  event  of  overdose,  the  patient  should  be 
monitored with appropriate blood counts and should receive supportive treatment, as necessary. There 
is no known specific antidote for azacitidine overdose. 
Special Populations 
Renal impairment: No formal studies have been conducted in patients with decreased renal function. 
Patients with severe organ impairment should be carefully monitored for adverse events. No specific 
modification  to  the  starting  dose  is  recommended  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (e.g.  baseline 
serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen [BUN] ≥ 2-fold above upper limit of normal [ULN] or serum 
bicarbonate less than 20 mmol/l) prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be 
based  on  haematology  and  renal  laboratory  values.  If  unexplained  reductions  in  serum  bicarbonate 
levels  to  less  than  20  mmol/l  occur,  the  dose  should  be  reduced  by  50  %  on  the  next  cycle.  If 
unexplained elevations in serum creatinine or BUN to ≥ 2-fold above baseline values and above ULN 
occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and the dose should 
be reduced by 50 % on the next treatment cycle (see SPC section 4.4). 
Renal abnormalities ranging from elevated serum creatinine to renal failure and death were reported 
rarely  in  patients  treated  with  intravenous  azacitidine  in  combination  with  other  chemotherapeutic 
agents.  In  addition,  renal  tubular  acidosis,  defined  as  a  fall  in  serum  bicarbonate  to  <  20  mmol/l  in 
association  with  an  alkaline  urine  and  hypokalaemia  (serum  potassium  <  3  mmol/l)  developed  in  5 
subjects with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) treated with azacitidine and etoposide.  
Patients  with  renal  impairment  should  be  closely  monitored  for  toxicity  since  azacitidine  and/or  its 
metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidney (see SPC section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment: No formal studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see 
SPC  section  4.4).  Patients  with  severe  hepatic  organ  impairment  should  be  carefully  monitored  for 
45/55 
 
adverse events. No specific modification to the starting dose is recommended for patients with hepatic 
impairment prior to starting treatment; subsequent dose modifications should be based on haematology 
laboratory  values.  Patients  with  extensive  tumour  burden  due  to  metastatic  disease  have  been  rarely 
reported to experience progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially in 
such  patients  with  baseline  serum  albumin  <  30  g/l.  Vidaza  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with 
advanced malignant hepatic tumours (see SPC sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Elderly: No specific dose adjustments are recommended for the elderly. Because elderly patients are 
more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.  
Children  and  adolescents:  Vidaza  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  below  18  years  due  to 
insufficient data on safety and efficacy. 
Laboratory tests 
Liver function tests and serum creatinine should be determined prior to initiation of therapy and prior 
to each treatment cycle. Complete blood counts should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and 
as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each treatment cycle.  
Method of administration 
Reconstituted Vidaza should be injected subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen. 
Injection sites should be rotated. New injections should be given at least 2.5 cm from the previous site 
and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, red, or hardened. 
Haematological toxicity 
Treatment with azacitidine is associated with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, particularly 
during the first 2 cycles (see SPC section 4.8). Complete blood counts should be performed as needed 
to monitor response and toxicity, but at least prior to each treatment cycle. After administration of the 
recommended  dose  for  the  first  cycle,  the  dose  for  subsequent  cycles  should  be  reduced  or  its 
administration  delayed  based  on  nadir  counts  and  haematological  response  (see  SPC  section  4.2). 
Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes. Patients and physicians are also advised 
to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding. 
Cardiac and pulmonary disease 
Patients  with  a  history  of  severe  congestive  heart  failure,  clinically  unstable  cardiac  disease  or 
pulmonary disease were excluded from the pivotal clinical study and therefore the safety and efficacy 
of Vidaza in these patients has not been established. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of azacitidine in pregnant women. Studies in mice have shown 
reproductive  toxicity  (see  SPC  section  5.3).  The  potential  risk  for  humans  is  unknown.  Based  on 
results  from  animal  studies  and  its  mechanism  of  action,  azacitidine  should  not  be  used  during 
pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary. The advantages of treatment 
should be weighed against the possible risk for the foetus in every individual case. Men and women of 
childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment. 
Lactation  
It is not known whether azacitidine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to the potential 
serious  adverse  reactions  in  the  nursing  child,  breast-feeding  is  contraindicated  during  azacitidine 
therapy. 
Fertility 
There  are  no  human  data  on  the  effect  of  azacitidine  on  fertility.  In  animals,  adverse  effects  of 
azacitidine on male fertility have been documented (see SPC section 5.3). Men should be advised not 
to  father  a  child  while  receiving  treatment  and  must  use  effective  contraception  during  and  up  to  3 
months after treatment. Before starting treatment, male patients should be advised to seek counseling 
on sperm storage. 
46/55 
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Patients should 
be advised that they may experience undesirable effects such as fatigue, during treatment. Therefore, 
caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machines. 
Adequate special precautions for disposal and other handling are provided in the SPC (see section 6)

2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues which might have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the 
product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Azacitidine  induces  both  gene  mutations  and  chromosomal  aberrations  in  bacterial  and  mammalian 
cell  systems  in  vitro.  The  potential  carcinogenicity  of  azacitidine  was  evaluated  in  mice  and  rats. 
Azacitidine  induced  tumours  of  the  haematopoietic  system  in  female  mice,  when  administered 
intraperitoneally  3  times  per  week  for  52  weeks.  An  increased  incidence  of  tumours  in  the 
lymphoreticular  system,  lung,  mammary  gland,  and  skin  was  seen  in  mice  treated  with  azacitidine 
administered  intraperitoneally  for  50  weeks.  A  tumorigenicity  study  in  rats  revealed  an  increased 
incidence of testicular tumours. 
Early  embryotoxicity  studies  in  mice  revealed  a  44  %  frequency  of  intrauterine  embryonal  death 
(increased resorption) after a single intraperitoneal injection of azacitidine during organogenesis. 
Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before 
closure of the hard palate. In rats, azacitidine caused no adverse effects when given pre-implantation, 
but it was clearly embryotoxic during when given during organogenesis. Foetal abnormalities caused 
during  organogenesis  included:  CNS  anomalies  (exencephaly/encephalocele),  limb  anomalies 
(micromelia, club foot, syndactyly, oligodactyly) and others (micrognathia, gastroschisis, oedema, and 
rib abnormalities). 
Administration  of  azacitidine  to  male  mice  prior  to  mating  with  untreated  female  mice  resulted  in 
decreased  fertility  and  loss  of  offspring  during  subsequent  embryonic  and  postnatal  development. 
Treatment of male rats resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides, decreased sperm 
counts, decreased pregnancy rates, an increase in abnormal embryos and increased loss of embryos in 
mated females (see SPC section 4.4). 
Efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of Vidaza was studied  in a multicenter randomised Phase 3 comparative study. 
Azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) (n = 179) was compared to conventional care regimens 
(CCR). CCR consisted of BSC alone (n = 105), low-dose cytarabine plus BSC (n = 49) or standard 
induction chemotherapy plus BSC (n = 25). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. 
Vidaza was administered at a subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days, followed by a rest 
period of 21 days (28-day treatment cycle) for a median of 9 cycles (range = 1-39) and a mean of 10.2 
cycles.  In  the  ITT  analysis  of  358  patients  (179  azacitidine  and  179  CCR),  Vidaza  treatment  was 
50/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated  with  a  median  survival  of  24.46  months  versus  15.02  months  for  those  receiving  CCR 
treatment, a difference of 9.4 months, with a stratified log-rank p-value of 0.0001. The hazard ratio for 
the  treatment  effect  was  0.58  (95  %  CI:  0.43,  0.77).  The  two-year  survival  rates  were  50.8  %  in 
patients receiving azacitidine versus 26.2 % in patients receiving CCR (p < 0.0001). 
Safety 
Adverse reactions considered to be possibly or probably related to the administration of Vidaza have 
occurred in 97 % of patients. 
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  with  azacitidine  treatment  were  haematological 
reactions  (71.4  %)  including  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia  and  leukopenia  (usually  Grade  3-4), 
gastrointestinal  events  (60.6  %)  including  nausea,  vomiting  (usually  Grade  1-2)  or  injection  site 
reactions (77.1 %; usually Grade 1-2). 
The most common serious adverse reactions (> 2 %) noted from the pivotal study (AZA PH GL 2003 
CL  001)  and  also  reported  in  the  supporting  studies  (CALGB  9221  and  CALGB  8921)  included 
febrile  neutropenia  (8.0  %)  and  anaemia  (2.3  %).  Other  less  frequently  reported  serious  adverse 
reactions (< 2 %) included neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhagic events 
(e.g. cerebral haemorrhage). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  was  adequate  to  monitor  the  safety  of  the  product.  No 
additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.  
  User consultation 
The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  (PIL)  for  Vidaza  (azacitidine)  has  been  tested  in  English  in 
accordance  with  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive 
2004/27/EC. The PIL for Vidaza (azacitidine) was found to contain all the necessary information in a 
way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test. 
It is considered that the tested PIL meets the requirements set for User Testing. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The present assessment of the MAA of azacitidine for the proposed indications in MDS and AML was 
based on the pivotal study AZA-001 in addition to the earlier submitted CALGB studies. 
The  design  of  pivotal  study  AZA-001  was  considered  appropriate  to  investigate  the  benefits  of 
azacitidine  for  the  currently  proposed  indications:  patients  with  intermediate-2  or  high  risk  MDS, 
CMML  (according  to  IPSS)  and  AML  with  20%-30%  blasts  and  multilineage  dysplasia  (WHO). 
Overall results from the AZA-001 study showed that patients in the azacitidine arm, when compared 
with patients with similar clinical characteristics that were treated with currently appropriate therapy, 
had  a  survival  benefit.  Therefore,  the  primary  endpoint  was  met  and  the  difference  in  OS  can  be 
regarded clinically relevant. The results regarding the secondary endpoints are in line with the survival 
benefit.  The  safety  profile  of  azacitidine  is  considered  acceptable.    The  toxicity  of  azacitidine  is 
consistent  with  that  observed  in  general  from  a  cytidine  analogue,  an  antimetabolite.  The  most 
prominent toxicity consisted of myelotoxicity which translated into symptomatic anaemia and, more 
important,  leucopenia  and  thrombocytopenia.  In  conclusion,  the  efficacy  of  azacitidine  can  be 
considered  established  and  the  safety profile  is  acceptable  in  the  claimed  indication,  and  the CHMP 
considers that the benefit risk balance is positive.

Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Vidaza is not similar to Trisenox or Glivec within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
Recommendation 
for  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Vidaza    for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  who  are  not 
eligible 
intermediate-2  and  high-risk 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), 
chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without myeloproliferative 
disorder,  or  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  (AML)  with  20-30  %  blasts  and  multi-lineage  dysplasia, 
according  to  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  classification,  was  favourable  and  therefore 
recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

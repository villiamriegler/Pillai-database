physicians of paediatric HIV-infected patients would be of 
limited impact, following the recent redistribution of 
paediatric educational brochures at the end of 2017 for the 
extension of Truvada indication in HIV-1 infected 
adolescents. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the use of 
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) as part of 
antiretroviral regimens in children and adolescent will 
ultimately be replaced by tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-
containing regimens for which a lesser impact on bone and 
renal function is expected. 
Furthermore, the results of this DUS suggest that there 
were minimal renal or bone safety adverse events across 
all evaluated laboratory measures observed with the 
Viread/TDF-Fixed Dose Combinations treatment groups and 
patients generally recovered within a few weeks of the 
adverse event; reflecting that population of HIV infected 
children and adolescents is kept under close scrutiny by 
paediatricians with frequent visits in clinical practice.

increase (approximately 65%) in the systemic exposure of 
tenofovir (TFV; the metabolite of TDF) was observed 
following coadministration of Harvoni and FTC/TDF+DTG, 
compared with FTC/TDF+DTG alone. The overall tenofovir 
exposures observed in this study were in the range of those 
observed when TDF is administered as part of a boosted 
regimen notably. No clinically significant drug interactions 
were observed between emtricitabine or dolutegravir and 
Harvoni. Accordingly, Truvada and Viread can be 
coadministered with Harvoni without dose adjustment but 
with close monitoring of renal function as the increased 
exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including 
renal disorders.  Renal function should be closely 
monitored.

no dose adjustment is recommended.  The increased 
exposure of tenofovir could potentiate adverse reactions 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including 
renal disorders.  Renal function should be closely 
monitored.

The two studies consisted of 48 weeks of double blind 
data (480 weeks) from two completed Phase 3 
studies in chronic hepatitis B e antigen negative 
(HBeAg−) patients (study GS-US-174-0102) and e 
antigen positive (HBeAg+) patients (Study GS-US-
174-0103). 
GS-US-174-0102 - a randomized, double-blind, 
controlled evaluation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
versus adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of 
presumed pre-core mutant chronic hepatitis B. 
GS-US-174-0103 - a randomized, double-blind, 
controlled evaluation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

positive chronic hepatitis B. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
therapy with Viread 300 mg or Hepsera 10 mg once daily, 
followed by open label treatment with Viread until week 
480. 
Data through week 384 (Year 8) have been previously 
submitted and assessed (EMEA/H/C/000419/II/0143).  
Those long-term data confirmed the potency and high 
genetic barrier of the drug even though mitigated by a 
limited hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) seroconversion 
rate and have been reflected in the SmPC. The current 
report remains limited as only a third of the patients 
remains in the study after Year 8. Virologic suppression was 
maintained in patients with available data through Week 
480 and no mutations associated with resistance to 
tenofovir were detected in patients who received 
tenofovir/disoproxil fumarate for up to 480 weeks.  
The 480 week safety data in both pivotal studies GS-US-
174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 were consistent with the 
known safety profile of the drug, with renal and bone 
adverse events still representing the most commonly drug-
related adverse reactions in TDF-treated patients. The 
CHMP concluded that these results do not warrant an 
update of the SmPC.

relatively stable over 13 years of treatment.  
As regards bone fractures, 8 events were reported during 
the study. All of them were trauma-related, not considered 
related to tenofovir or Truvada and were recovered.  
As regards the renal function, the median change in 
eGFRCG seems not clinically relevant (with no subjects 
experiencing eGFRCG below 50 mL/min) and glomerular 
function remained stable through study. 
No Fanconi syndrome or tubulopathy was reported. The 
only renal SAE reported was kidney pain which was not 
related to study drug.  
No new safety concern was raised from these final study 
results.  No change to the SmPC of TDF-containing 
products is therefore necessary on the basis of these data.

exceedingly low. A position statement on the use of 
antiretroviral therapy to reduce HIV transmission was 
published by the British HIV Association (BHIVA) in January 
2013. As a consequence, the recommendations for post-
exposure prophylaxis have also been changed in recently 
updated HIV treatment guidelines. For example, the 2013 
BHIVA guideline does not generally recommend post-
exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after exposure from a patient 
with well treated HIV. Based on these data, the wording on 
the risk of transmission for HIV products was revised to 
reflect the current scientific knowledge. While effective 
suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to 
substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a 
residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent 
transmission should be taken in accordance with national 
guidelines.

allows for dose adjustment. As a consequence of the 
availability of this new formulation, the CHMP requested to 
provide additional PK simulations to evaluate the adequacy 
of daily dose adjustment in adult patients with moderate

could provide a narrower range of TFV exposures than 
those with dose interval adjustment. Pharmacokinetic 
modelling of single dose pharmacokinetic data in non HIV 
and non HBV infected adult subjects with varying degrees 
of renal impairment was used to determine dose 
adjustment recommendations for adult subjects with 
varying degrees of renal impairment. Based on these 
submitted data, recommendations for daily dose 
adjustments were introduced for patients with moderate

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
for Viread indicated in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B 
(CHB) in adults.  Marketing authorisation of Viread for CHB 
was based primarily on data from 266 adult subjects with 
hepatitis B early antigen positive (HBeAg+) compensated 
CHB and 375 subjects with hepatitis B early antigen 
negative (HBeAg−) compensated CHB who enrolled in the 
similarly designed pivotal studies GS-US-174-0102 
(HBeAg− subjects) and GS-US-174-0103 (HBeAg+ 
subjects).   
For both trials 0102 and 0103, week 288 longer term (open 
label) continuation data has become available.  These data 
are now reflected in the Product Information. It is remarked 
that viral suppression, biochemical and serological 
responses were maintained with continued tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate treatment.  Also, the adverse reactions 
observed with continued treatment for 288 weeks were 
consistent with the known safety profile of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate.  Nevertheless, a worrying trend has 
been detected towards a small but increasing proportion of 
TDF-treated patients experiencing mild to moderate 
decrease in creatinine clearance (Clcr) over the last two 
years of continuous treatment.  The impact of the latter is 
under further assessment. 
It is concluded that the benefit-risk balance in the use of 
Viread in patients with compensated chronic hepatitis B 
remains unchanged.

blind, randomized study comparing tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC) plus 
TDF, and entecavir (ETV) in the treatment of CHB in 
subjects with decompensated liver disease. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to add

all available formulations; and further to SmPC 
Section 3 and Annex IIIa Section 4, for the 123, 163, 
and 204 mg film-coated tablet formulations. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 9. A series of minor linguistic amendments 
are also proposed (DA, ES, IS, SE, and SK language 
Annexes). 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications

primarily on data from 266 adult subjects with hepatitis B 
early antigen positive (HBeAg+) compensated CHB and 375

compensated CHB who enrolled in the similarly designed 
pivotal studies GS-US-174-0102 (HBeAg− subjects) and 
GS-US-174-0103 (HBeAg+ subjects). The application for 
the CHB indication also included supportive safety data, 
blinded with regard to treatment assignment, from Study 
GS-US-174-0108, which is a double-blind, active-controlled 
study of tenofovir DF in subjects with CHB and 
decompensated liver disease. A total of 112 subjects have 
been treated in this study, and the planned primary 
analyses of safety and efficacy, based on the first 48 weeks 
of treatment with tenofovir DF, the fixed-dose combination 
of emtricitabine/tenofovir DF, or entecavir, were previously 
presented and assessed.  On the basis of these study 
results, the MAH received an extension of the indication for 
Viread to include the treatment of patients with 
decompensated chronic hepatitis B. Since the original 
submission of the 48-weeks data, the week 168 final 
clinical study report for Study GS-US-174-0108 has 
become available. These data are now reflected in the 
Product Information.  It is remarked that the study was not 
adequately powered to clearly demonstrate meaningful 
differences in efficacy parameters between groups.  The 
benefit-risk balance in the use of Viread in patients with 
decompensated CHB remains unchanged.

Hepatitis B. In both studies, viral suppression was 
maintained through week 144, reaching 87% in HBeAg- 
and 71% in HBeAg+ patients. Nevertheless, this good 
virological response only translated into a slight increase in 
patients achieving HBeAg loss and seroconversion (around 
25 and 30% had HBeAg loss/seroconversion at week 144 
respectively). Cumulatively, 8% of patients (all HBeAg+ 
patients) achieved HBsAg loss at week 144. No mutations 
associated with resistance to tenofovir were detected. The 
144 week safety data from the two pivotal were in line with 
the known safety profile of the medicinal product and 
raised no new concerns.

tolerability of tenofovir DF monotherapy versus the fixed-
dose combination of emtricitabine /tenofovir DF in subjects 
being treated with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for chronic 
hepatitis B  (CHB) and who had persistent viral replication 
after 24-96 weeks of treatment. The 48 week results 
presented do not allow a direct comparison between the 
both treatment groups beyond week 24 since the study 
design allowed patients with partial response to treatment 
to switch to open label emtricitabine /tenofovir DF. 
Therefore, the SPC is updated with the results at week 24 
which further confirm that tenofovir DF is a potent drug in 
treatment experienced patients with active replication 
under adefovir dipivoxil therapy. Furthermore, resistance 
analysis at 1 year suggests that tenofovir DF has a high 
genetic barrier in treatment-experienced patients. The 
safety profile of tenofovir DF in this study was consistent

the 12 cases with evidence for a positive tenofovir 
dechallenge included osteomalacia. In non-clinical studies 
tenofovir was already associated with osteomalacia in 
monkeys. Osteomalacia was recognised as an adverse 
reaction to tenofovir treatment but for which the frequency 
is currently not known. The muscle events in cases of 
possible fanconi syndrome were also reviewed: in 8 of the 
15 cases describing muscle events, a positive dechallenge 
with clear improvement of the muscle symptoms was 
described. Myopathy is therefore an adverse reaction to 
tenofovir treatment for which the frequency is currently not

inclusion of acute interstitial nephritis as an adverse 
reaction to tenofovir treatment but for which a frequency 
could not be yet determined. Section 4.8 of the SPC and

the safety-related changes to the Company Core 
Safety Information, reviewed in the 4th and 5th 
PSUR covering the period of 01.05.03 to 30.04.04 for 
Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets.  
In addition, the MAH applied for the update of 
section 4.4 "Special warning and special precautions 
for use" regarding the co-administration of tenofovir 
with didanosine, as proposed by the CHMP following 
the assessment of the 5th PSUR and further 
responses of the 4th PSUR.  
In addition, the MAH took this opportunity to update 
section 6.1 "List of excipients" of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics and relevant section of the 
Package Leaflet to add the correspondent "E" 
number.  Moreover, Annex II is amended to be in 
accordance with the latest QRD template. 
Moreover, the French and Greek Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet are amended to 
correct some spelling mistakes. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
30.04.04) PSURs, the Company Core Safety Information 
(CCSI) was updated based on a review of the safety data to 
reactions and to highlight the fact that the ability of 
patients to drive and operate machines may be affected as 
very commonly Viread causes dizziness. Section 4.8 has 
been updated to include the acute tubular necrosis, 
increased transaminases and hepatitis as adverse reactions 
to Viread and section 4.7 as regards dizziness. The PL was 
amended accordingly. 
Further to assessment of the 5th PSUR the CHMP concluded 
that the main safety concerns were the reactions reported 
with the association tenofovir-didanosine (pancreatitis and 
lactic acidosis, including rare fatal cases). Section 4.4 and 
4.5 were updated not to recommend the co-administration 
of tenofovir and didanosine and to specify the careful 
monitoring for efficacy and didanosine related adverse 
reactions if the combination is judged strictly necessary. 
The CHMP requested the MAH to propose a harmonised 
DDL to alert clinicians to maintain a high level of awareness 
for didanosine-related complications in patients treated 
with tenofovir+didanosine regardless the dose of 
didanosine and multitherapies used, the DDL was adopted 
during the February 2005 CHMP meeting.

indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment. 
In most cases the inflammatory reaction towards the 
opportunistic pathogens is not foreseen since the 
opportunistic infection has not been detected/ diagnosed. If 
diagnosed prior to the institution of CART, the treatment 
against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually given 
priority. In particular, this is true for the complications 
most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, generalised 
mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia.  An additional reason for treating the OI and 
the HIV-infection sequentially is the great risk of adverse 
events (toxicity or lack of effect) due to drug interactions.  
The clinical consequence of the reactivation of the immune 
system in patients starting CART cannot be prevented and 
the early recognition and diagnose of these inflammatory 
reaction is considering to be important for the clinical 
handling of the patients. Therefore, further to the 
assessment of the MAH's responses and discussions held at 
the Pharmacovigilance working party and CHMP, the CHMP 
adopted a class labelling text regarding the reactivation of 
the immune system of HIV-infected patients treated with

study comparing tenofovir DF administered in combination 
with lamivudine and efavirenz versus stavudine, lamivudine 
and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve HIV 1 infected 
patients. This study is the follow-up of the 48 week pivotal 
double blind GS-99-903 study supportive of the treatment 
with tenofovir DF in antiretroviral naïve patients.  
The 144-week efficacy data showed a sustained virological 
response in both treatment arms and especially the 
emergence of the critical K65R associated mutation to 
tenofovir DF phenotypic resistance remain limited (<3%). 
The long-term safety profile of tenofovir DF was 
comparable to the safety profile observed through the first 
48 weeks of treatment. No new safety signals were 
identified in the tenofovir DF group.  
The frequent monitoring of the renal function was however 
considered still necessary, particularly during the first year 
of treatment (i.e. every 4 weeks).  
No clinically significant bone abnormalities were associated 
with prolonged use of tenofovir. However, tenofovir induces 
significant decreases in bone mineral density, mainly during 
the first year of treatment, without aggravation over the 
time. The effects on bone biomarkers were statistically 
significantly higher with TDF than with stavudine.  
The long term safety profile regarding lipodystrophy was 
favourable to the tenofovir regimen compared with the 
stavudine regimen, respectively 3% vs 19%.

patients.  
Two EMEA public statements have been issued (July and 
October 2003) relating to this topic. Further discussions on 
these findings have been held at the CHMP as well as at the 
EMEA HIV Ad Hoc Group. Based on the in vivo and in vitro 
data submitted by the MAHs a class labelling warning has 
been adopted by the CHMP in July 2004 to be implemented 
in section 4.4 of the SPC harmonising the information at 
the present stage of knowledge.

and/ or post-natal exposure to NRTIs was first raised in 
1999 following the identification of 8 cases of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in uninfected children included in a clinical trial. 
The MAHs for all NRTIs were asked to provide preclinical 
data on the mitochondrial toxicity and a review of adverse 
reactions potentially attributable to mitochondrial toxicity in 
children exposed in utero and / or post-natally to NRTIs. 
Following the assessment of data submitted and 
discussions held at the PhVWP and CPMP, a class wording 
was agreed at the November 2003 CPMP meeting, to be 
implemented in the product information of all NRTIs.

change section 4.4 (Special warnings and special 
precautions for use) of the SPC, in view of results 
from the study conducted with adefovir dipivoxil. In 
addition, further to the request of the CPMP, the MAH 
has taken this opportunity to update section 4.5 of 
the SPC with regard to the interaction between TDF 
and lopinavir/ritonavir (study GS-01-943) and with 
regard to the interaction between TDF and

In addition, section 4.5 of the SPC for Viread was amended 
to reflect the decrease in atazanavir concentration 
observed when co-administrated with tenofovir. 
Furthermore as requested by the CHMP further to the 
assessment of study GS-01-943 the text regarding the 
interaction with lopinavir/ritonavir has been amended to 
reflect the fact that the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
lopinavir and ritonavir are not affected by tenofovir.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cystic fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease. The mean incidence is reported to be 1 in 2000-
3000  live  Caucasian  births  (WHO  -  2004).  It  is  the  most  common  lethal  genetic  disorder  affecting 
Caucasian  populations.  Cystic  fibrosis  has  several  manifestations,  including  gastrointestinal,  though 
respiratory manifestations are the main and include bronchitis, bronchiolitis and bronchioectasis, which 
can lead to haemoptysis, pneumothorax and cor pulmonale. Lung disease is the most common (>90%) 
cause of death in cystic fibrosis patients. The life span of patients with cystic fibrosis has increased in 
Europe and the median life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients has been estimated in 2000-2003 as 
40  years.  The  increase  in  average  age  of  death  leads  to  increased  proportion  of  adult  CF  patients, 
however, majority of patients are still in the paediatric population.  
Cystic  fibrosis  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  CFTR  (cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  conductance 
regulator)  gene.  The  primary  function  of  the  CFTR  protein  is  as  an  ion  channel  that  regulates  liquid 
volume on epithelial surfaces through chloride secretion and inhibition of sodium absorption. 
One  hypothesis  for  the  pathogenesis  of  lung  disease  in  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  is  that  a  lack  of 
regulation  of  sodium  absorption  and  chloride  secretion  reduces  the  water  content  of  airway  surface 
liquid, resulting in the accumulation of thick, tenacious mucus, and promotes the formation of adherent 
mucus plaques on airway surfaces. In cystic fibrosis patients, the ciliary system is unable to clear this 
mucus,  leading  to  chronic  inflammation  and  infection,  airway  damage,  and  ultimately  respiratory 
failure. 
Pulmonary exacerbations are significant clinical events for patients with cystic fibrosis and lead to lung 
function decline. Pulmonary exacerbations are usually associated with a change in the bacterial density 
of  the  bacterial  flora  residing  in  the  airways.  Lung  infection  and  inflammation  in  cystic  fibrosis  are 
mainly  treated  with  antibiotics.  Other  treatments  include  exercise  and  physical  therapies,  pancreatic 
enzymes  replacement  therapy,  use  of  nutritional  supplements,  bronchodilators,  mucolytics  and  anti-
inflammatory  medicines,  local  hydration  with  inhaled  moisture,  and  in  severe  cases  lung 
transplantation. 
Recombinant  human  DNase  is  currently  registered  as  the  mucolytic  agent  in  the  treatment  of  cystic 
fibrosis.  RhDNase  cleaves  the  DNA  present  in  sputum/mucus  and  degrades  the  large  amount  of  free 
DNA  that  accumulates  within  CF  mucus,  thereby  improving  the  viscoelastic  properties  of  airway 
secretions  and  promoting  airway  clearance.  RhDNase  is  recommended  by  current  guidelines  in  CF 
patients  6  years  and  older  as  it  has  been  shown  to  improve  lung  function  with  a  low  risk  of  adverse 
events.  
Nebulised  hypertonic  saline  (HS)  has  been  proposed  as  an  agent  that  increases  hydration  of  airway 
surface  liquid  in  cystic  fibrosis  by  an  osmotic  gradient  to  improve  mucociliary  clearance  (MCC).  The 
quality  of  evidence  for  the  use  of  HS  in  patients  with  CF  is  limited  to  published  studies.  A  2005 
Cochrane review of hypertonic saline found that overall lung function improved compared with placebo, 
but the improvement was not as great as that seen with dornase alfa. 
Even though currently available therapies have prolonged life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients, it 
is  still  a  progressive  disease  associated  with  increased  mortality  and  significantly  decreased  average

age  of  death;  therefore  there  exists  an  unmet  medical  need  for  new  effective  treatments  for  cystic 
fibrosis. 
The product 
Hyperosmolar agents such as inhaled mannitol are expected to facilitate clearance of mucus by ciliary 
and  cough  action  by  a  number  of  different  mechanisms.  Inhaled  mannitol  is  believed  to  create  an 
osmotic  gradient  that  increases  the  amount  of  water  in  the  airway  lumen  encouraging  hydration  and 
subsequent  restoration  of  the  periciliary  layer  (airway  surface  liquid).  This  is  expected  to  lead  to 
changes  in  surface  properties,  to  improve  ciliary  function  and  mucus  transportability  and  to  increase 
mucociliary  clearance.  The  mucus  load  and  subsequent  inflammation  and  infection  might  therefore 
decrease, resulting in stabilisation of the cystic fibrosis patient’s condition. 
Mannitol  (D-Mannitol)  is  a  naturally  occurring  polyol  (sugar  alcohol).  It  is  used  intravenously  as  an 
osmotic agent for the treatment of cerebral oedema and renal failure and orally as a bowel preparation 
to  alleviate  constipation.  Mannitol  is  also  an  excipient  in  pharmaceutical  formulations,  and  a  food 
additive. Inhaled mannitol has been approved for bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing. 
Bronchitol  has  been  developed  for  both  adults  and  children  with  CF  as  an  osmotic  stimulus  to  lung 
clearance  to  be  used  either  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  rhDNase  or  in  patients  intolerant  to,  or 
inadequately responsive to, rhDNase. 
Bronchitol  is  an  encapsulated  powder  for  inhalation.  The  product  consists  of  hard  gelatine  capsules 
containing 40 mg of respirable mannitol powder delivered to the patient via a dry powder inhaler, to be 
provided in the package of Bronchitol. 
The original indication claimed by the applicant was: 
 
“Bronchitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in both paediatric and adult 
population 6 years and above as either an add-on therapy to rhDNase or in patients intolerant to, 
or inadequately responsive to rhDNase.” 
During  the  evaluation  procedure  the  applicant  has  modified  this  indication  to  exclude  those  below  18 
years of age. 
The posology proposed by the applicant is 400 mg twice a day, which requires inhalation of the content 
of  10  capsules  of  40  mg  via  the  inhaler  device  twice  a  day.  Before  commencing  treatment  with 
Bronchitol,  all  patients  during  administration  of  their  initiation  dose  are  required  to  be  assessed  for 
bronchial  hyperresponsiveness  to  inhaled  mannitol,  which  is  listed  as  a  contraindication  in  the 
proposed SPC. 
Initiation of Bronchitol treatment (at dose 400 mg) is proposed to be done under the supervision and 
monitoring of an experienced physician or another appropriately trained health professional, equipped 
to  monitor  oxygen  saturation  and  able  to  perform  spirometry  and  manage  acute  bronchospasm.  A 
bronchodilator is proposed to be administered 5-15 minutes before Bronchitol is used. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  is  a  complete  independent  application.  The  legal  basis  of  the  application  refers  to  Article  8.3  of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The  applicant  requested  an  accelerated  assessment  for  the  application.  However,  the  CHMP  did  not 
accept  this  request  as  it  could  not  be  assumed  that  the  product  would  be  of  major  public  health 
interest  and  in  particular  from  the  viewpoint  of  therapeutic  innovation.  It  was  noted  that  such  claim 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 10/126
 
 
would  require  substantial  data  to  assess  the  impact  on  reduced  morbidity  and  prolonged  life 
expectancy  data,  given  the  closeness  of  the  therapeutic  principle  of  inhaled  mannitol  to  the  one  of 
available therapies. Based on the available evidence inhaled mannitol was considered not to address a 
major  unmet  need  but  instead  to  offer  an  alternative  to  adjunctive  therapies  used  to  support  the 
therapeutic  algorithm  with  the  aim  of  dislodging  sputum  and  encouraging  its  expectoration.  The 
claimed innovator concept was thus not supported by the Committee. Furthermore, it was considered 
that  a  new  mode  and  method  of  administration  with  a  dry  powder  inhaler  and  small  portable  device 
that would improve compliance could not be recognised to fulfil such criterion. 
Bronchitol, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, has been designated as an orphan medicinal product. 
For  the  development  of  products  for  cystic  fibrosis  a  specific  guideline  has  been  developed  by  the 
CHMP  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008)  and  is  applicable  also  to  the  development  programme  of 
Bronchitol. 
The applicant had obtained protocol assistance, during which it was advised that: 
  A sub-therapeutic dose of mannitol would be acceptable as a control in the Phase 3 study.  
 
The  trial  design  initially  proposed  by  the  applicant  would  not  be  adequate  to  evaluate  efficacy  of 
mannitol  as  both  first  line  and  add  on  therapy  (to  rhDNAse)  in  CF  because  rhDNAse  treated  and 
rhDNAse naïve patients are unlikely to be comparable in terms of severity of disease. 
 
From the data presented during scientific advice procedure, the indication for an add-on to existing 
therapy appears to be the most appropriate indication. 
  Revisions to the protocol, as proposed by the applicant, are acceptable. However, it was noted that 
an  add-on  design  (or  alternatively  a  non-inferiority/superiority  design  against  rhDNAse  for  a  first 
line  indication)  is  recommended  for  the  clinical  development.  It  was  noted  that  the  trial  design 
might benefit from small-scale short-term trials first to determine if the chosen order of mannitol, 
postural drainage and bronchodilator is optimal for this drug. 
 
The FEV 1 would be a suitable primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
In general the applicant has complied with the Protocol Assistance. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Bronchitol  is  an  encapsulated  powder  for  inhalation.  The  product  consists  of  hard  gelatine  capsule 
containing 40 mg of respirable mannitol powder delivered to the patient via a dry powder inhaler. The 
dry  powder  device  is  provided  in  the  package:  type  RS  S01  Inhaler  Model  7  HR,  a  high-resistance 
inhaler manufactured by Plastiape S.p.A.  
Mannitol  (D-Mannitol)  is  a  naturally  occurring  polyol  (sugar  alcohol).  It  is  used  intravenously  as  an 
osmotic agent for the treatment of cerebral oedema and renal failure and orally as a bowel preparation 
to  alleviate  constipation.  Mannitol  is  also  an  excipient  in  pharmaceutical  formulations,  and  a  food 
additive.  Since  2006,  inhaled  mannitol  (Aridol/OsmohaleTM  in  capsules  of  5  mg,  10  mg,  20  mg,  40 
mg) has been used as a bronchial provocation test to measure bronchial responsiveness.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  have  been  submitted  for  the 
marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  quality  of  the  medicinal  product  is  acceptable.  There  were  no  quality  outstanding  issues  on  the 
quality  of  the  active  substance  at  the  time  of  Opinion.  However  one  non-major  issue  remains 
unresolved  regarding  the  quality  of  the  finished  medicinal  product:  the  characterisation  of  the 
preservative  efficacy  of  mannitol  against  species  such  as  Burkholdaria  cepacia,  Aspergillus  fumigatus 
was  not  performed.  These  infective  agents  are  commonly  reported  as  pathogenic  contaminants  in 
cystic fibrosis and therefore this issue required investigation. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  data  consists  of  non-clinical  studies  sponsored  by  the  applicant  and  published  data. 
Since  mannitol  is  a  known  active  substance,  mainly  relevant  published  data  have  been  submitted, 
supplemented  with  a  bridging  programme  of  studies  conducted  to  support  its  use  by  the  inhalation 
route.  The  additional  studies  comprised  of  single  and  repeated  dose  toxicity,  including  toxicokinetics, 
and local tolerance studies, which all were reported to be GLP compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Data from the literature indicate that the primary pharmacodynamic actions of inhaled mannitol relate 
to its osmotic effect on airway secretions. In the isolated ferret trachea1, a solution of 15 g/dl mannitol 
increased  mucin  and  lysozyme  secretion.  Mannitol  appeared  to  induce  mucin  secretion  to  a  greater 
extent  than  saline  solution  with  similar  osmolarity,  although  this  was  not  statistically  significant. 
Mannitol  also  caused  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  respiratory  tract  fluid  output  in  anaesthetised 
beagle dogs2. Overall, both models showed that mucus secretion is markedly stimulated in response to 
hyperosmolarity  and  support  the  hypothesis  that  Inhaled  mannitol  causes  an  osmotic  gradient  in  the 
airway leading to an increase in secretion of water into the airway lumen, which rehydrates the mucus. 
This is expected to result in a change in mucus rheology, promoting mucociliary clearance.

Inhaled d-mannitol aerosol increases osmolarity, which leads to the release of inflammatory mediators 
such  as  histamine,  leukotrienes  and  prostanoids  from  airway  and  inflammatory  cells,  which  in  turn 
results in bronchoconstriction and airway narrowing. This is the pharmacological activity of mannitol as 
the  challenge  agent.  It  is  also  relevant  for  patients  receiving  inhaled  mannitol,  therefore  pertinent 
information has been included in the proposed SPC. 
Taking  into  account  the  clinical  experience  with  mannitol  as  a  challenge  agent,  no  further  secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies are required. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
Safety pharmacology aspects have been investigated in repeat-dose toxicology studies. No evidence of 
respiratory or cardiovascular treatment-related effects was seen in the mannitol inhalation repeat-dose 
toxicology studies conducted. Cardiovascular and respiratory functions were monitored during the dog 
2-week inhalation toxicity study and no changes in cardiovascular or respiratory functions were seen at 
doses  up  to  789 mg/kg/day.  In  the  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies,  inhalation  of  mannitol  at  up  to  9 
(rats)  and  54  (in  dogs)  times  the  maximum  recommended  human  dose  did  not  cause  any  notable 
effects on the central nervous system. In addition, no reports of altered respiratory, cardiovascular or 
CNS  functions  were  found  despite  widespread  human  and  animal  exposure  to  mannitol,  except  at 
systemic  doses  that  are  in  excess  of  the  recommended  dose  proposed  in  this  application 
(800 mg/day). Therefore, further safety pharmacology studies are not considered required. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non clinical studies on pharmacodynamic interactions have not been performed, which can be accepted 
in  the  light  of  available  clinical  and  literature  data  and  the  wide  experience  in  administration  of 
mannitol. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  specific  pharmacokinetic  studies  by  the  inhalation  route  were  conducted  but  toxicokinetic 
measurements were included for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in the toxicity studies 
in the dog and for BAL fluid in two studies in the rat, which are discussed under Toxicology below. The 
absence  of  specific  non  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  is  acceptable.  Additional  data  from  the 
literature are presented in this section below. 
Orally, mannitol is slowly and poorly absorbed, with a bioavailability of 17-20% and it exerts a laxative 
effect because of its osmotic effects. In addition, the literature provides some evidence that mannitol 
can  be  absorbed  systemically  from  the  lungs.  Mannitol  administered  by  inhalation  or  intratracheal 
administration  in  mice,  rats  and  rabbits  was  absorbed  relatively  rapidly  from  the  lung,  in  a  manner 
suggesting  first-order  kinetics  with  a  half-life  of  26.5  minutes  in  the  rat.  Mannitol  does  not  cross  the 
blood-brain barrier. 
A percentage of systemically absorbed mannitol undergoes hepatic metabolism to glycogen and carbon 
dioxide and the compound is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine or faeces. A minor proportion 
might  be  excreted  as  carbon  dioxide  in  the  expired  air  following  complete  metabolism  by 
dehydrogenation  to  fructose  and  through  the  glycolytic  pathway.  No  toxic  metabolites  are  found  and 
there is no evidence of accumulation. 
Excretion  following  intravenous  administration  is  mainly  as  unchanged  mannitol  via  the  urine;  this 
would also apply to mannitol systemically absorbed following inhalation. 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

It  is  expected  that  a  significant  proportion  of  mannitol  might  be  swallowed  by  patients  using  Inhaled 
mannitol and that it will be excreted unchanged in the faeces. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A  single-dose  study  in  rats  and  repeat-dose  studies in  rats  and  dogs  were  performed  to  examine  the 
local respiratory tract tolerance and the systemic effects of inhaled mannitol. Ocular toxicity has been 
assessed  in  two  studies;  a  rabbit  eye  irritation  study  and  a  bovine  corneal  opacity  and  permeability 
study. 
Literature  references  were  reviewed  for  repeat-dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  and 
reproduction toxicity data. 
Single dose toxicity  
One  single  dose  toxicity  study  by  inhalation  administration  was  conducted  in  rats  where  male  and 
female rats (5 per group) received 17.6, 80 or 98.1 mg/kg mannitol via inhalation. Slight reduction in 
body  weight  gain  at  17.6  and  80 mg/kg  dose  and  statistically  significant  at  98.1 mg/kg,  as  well  as 
slight reduction in food consumption at 98.1 mg/kg dose was observed in male rats. In females body 
weight loss 1 day after dosing at 80 and 98.1 mg/kg was noted. Differences in body weight gain were 
explained by not balanced age of animals in the different groups. At post mortem, the weights of lungs 
and  bronchi  of  the  treated  male  animals  were  lower  than  those  of  the  controls,  achieving  statistical 
significance  in  the  80  and  98.1 mg/kg  groups.  The  findings  were  not  consistent  between  genders. 
Some  microscopic  findings  including  arterial  mural  mineralization  in  lungs  and  bronchi,  submucosal 
inflammatory  cells  in  nasal  turbinates  and  loss  of  cilia  in  trachea  were  noted  primarily  in  high  dosed 
animals.  Study  results  do  not  raise  any  serious  toxicological  concerns.    A  No  Adverse  Effect  Level 
(NOAEL) from this study was defined by the applicant as 98.1 mg/kg/day, which is 7 times higher than 
the anticipated dose in humans. 
Information  about  single  dose  toxicity  in  mannitol  via  other  administration  routes  is  available  in  the 
literature. 
A  single-dose  toxicity  study 3   in  6-week  old  F344/N  rats  (50)  and  B6C3F1  mice  (50)  has  been 
conducted. On day one, each group of 10 (5F, 5M) was offered, ad libitum in their water, either 6,000, 
12,500, 25,000, 50,000, or 100,000 ppm of mannitol. They were observed twice daily for survival and 
other  physical  signs  up  to  day  16.  All  animals  survived,  and  no  compound-related  effects  were 
observed.  
According  to  published  data 4   mannitol  has  low  acute  toxicity  by  the  oral,  intravenous  (IV)  or 
intraperitoneal (IP) routes:

Repeat dose toxicity  
2-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies in rats and dogs, 7-day and 13-week inhalation toxicity 
studies in rats and a 26-week inhalation toxicity study in beagle dogs have been conducted. 
Two-week  repeat-dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  were  conducted  and  considered 
pivotal:  13-week  inhalation  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  a  26-week  inhalation  toxicity  study  in  beagle 
dogs. The choice of the beagle dog for the pivotal 26-week study was justified on the basis of greater 
exposure  achieved  in  the  respiratory  tract  in  this  species.  The  dog  also  showed  signs  indicative  of  a 
more relevant pharmacodynamic effect, in the form of pulmonary oedema and frothing in the trachea. 
The  repeat-dose  inhalation  studies  indicated  no  local  toxicity  to  the  respiratory  tract,  nor  was  any 
evidence of systemic toxicity noted. Mannitol by inhalation was generally well tolerated in rats for 13 
weeks under a regimen of dosing at up to 210 mg/kg/day for 180 minutes daily and in dogs at doses 
up to 713 mg/kg/day for two 1-hour periods per day. Lymphocytosis was seen in the 2-week and 13-
week rat studies and plasmacytosis was also seen in the 13-week rat study. In the 2-week rat study, 
some findings were also observed in tissues other than the respiratory tract in the high-dose animals, 
such  as  increased  incidence  of  inflammatory  cells  in  the  myocardium  and  epididymides,  and  cortical 
renal tubular basophilia. 
A minor increase in lung weight was evident at the end of the 2-week dog study and was thought to 
reflect  the  pharmacological  response  to  the  high  mannitol  load  in  the  lungs  and  the  time  of  death 
relative  to  the  end  of  dosing.  (Note:  In  contrast  to  all  other  studies  reported,  the  dogs  were  killed 
immediately  after  exposure  to  assess  the  peak  lung  mannitol  burden  in  this  study).  No  similar 
treatment-related effects were seen in the 26-week dog study where the dogs were killed 20-24 hours 
after the last exposure when any pharmacological effects of mannitol had disappeared. 
Also  in  the  13-week  rat  study,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  both  the  percentage  and  absolute 
number of natural killer cells in the 210 mg/kg group and the value remained increased at the end of 
the  4-week  recovery  period.  There  were  no  other  notable  effects  on  lymphocyte  subpopulations,  nor 
any evidence of immunotoxicity; the persisting slight increase in natural killer cells is not considered to 
indicate any risk for clinical use. 
In  dogs,  BAL  cell  count investigations at  26  weeks  revealed  an  increase  in  absolute  white  cell  counts 
for mannitol-treated animals but this did not persist into the recovery period. This finding is consistent 
with the observations made following the use of mannitol as a diagnostic agent for hyper-reactivity of 
the lungs and is not considered to represent a significant toxic risk. Coughing and enlarged local lymph 
nodes were found but did not persist during the recovery period. 
In rats a slight increase in NK cells was seen however the elevated levels were within historic control 
ranges for the laboratory. In addition there was no evidence of immunotoxicity in the dogs or humans. 
There  were  no  treatment-related  effects  on  organ  weights  and  there  were  no  necropsy  or  histology 
findings that could be attributed to administration of mannitol. 
Published  data  on  repeat-dose  toxicity  from  mice,  rats  and  monkeys  did  not  show  any  toxicologically 
relevant signs of toxicity associated with the systemic administration of mannitol. 
Genotoxicity 
Scientific literature was reviewed for genotoxicity data. There  was no evidence of genotoxicity on the 
part of mannitol in any of the available studies, which include reports on Bacterial Reverse Mutagenesis 
Test, Mouse Lymphoma TK assay, Sister Chromatid Exchange and Chromosome Aberration test, Mouse 
Micronucleus Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Study, Drosophila Sex-Linked Recessive Lethal Study,

In vivo Cytogenetics Chromosome Aberration study and others. On the basis of the published studies 
and  the  fact  that  mannitol  is  an  approved  pharmaceutical  excipient,  there  are  no  concerns  over 
genotoxicity. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long term studies 
A long-term (104-107 weeks) toxicity and carcinogenicity study in the Wistar rat has been reported in 
the literature. Male and female rats were fed mannitol at doses of 4.4 and 5.2 g/kg respectively (10% 
in the diet). No toxicologically significant events or alteration in tumour incidence was seen5. 
In another study6 F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed mannitol at doses of 25,000 and 50,000 ppm 
(5%  limit  dose)  for  103  weeks.  Mannitol  was  not  carcinogenic  in  these  studies.  Mild  nephrosis  (focal 
vacuolisation  of  renal  tubular  epithelium)  was  noted  in  mice  and  a  treatment  related,  but  not  dose 
related,  increased  incidence  of  dilatation  of  the  gastric  fundal  gland  was  detected  in  the  low-  and 
high-dose female rats. Retinopathy and cataracts occurred at increased incidences. 
Medium and short term studies 
A carcinogenicity study in transgenic animals is reported in the literature. The study used p53-deficient 
mice that were fed mannitol at a dose of 5% in food for a period of 26 weeks. At the end of the study, 
mannitol was classified as non-carcinogenic7. However, it should be noted that also the positive control 
did not induce any tumours in this study. 
Embryonic  turkey  and  quail  livers  were  examined  after  exposure  to  known  non-carcinogens  and 
carcinogens.  The  known  carcinogen  diethylnitrosamine  induced  preneoplastic  liver  lesions,  whereas 
mannitol  caused  no  histological  changes  in  the  embryonic  livers 8 .  The  authors  noted  that  these 
findings correlate with traditional long-term rodent bioassays. 
There was no evidence of carcinogenicity of mannitol in the presented studies. On the basis of this and 
the  fact  that  mannitol  is  an  approved  pharmaceutical  excipient,  there  are  no  concerns  over 
carcinogenicity.  Furthermore,  there  were  no  proliferative  lesions  seen  in  the  inhalation  studies 
conducted  on  behalf  of  the  applicant  and  there  is  no  reason  to  assume  that  mannitol  will  be 
carcinogenic by the inhalation route. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Literature  data  on  the  reproductive  toxicity  of  mannitol  have  been  adduced  to  demonstrate  the 
absence of effects on fertility, embryo-foetal development and pre- and post-natal development. While 
the data were derived from different dosing routes and the study designs were not in accordance with 
current  guidelines,  nonetheless,  the  data  indicate  that  there  is  no  serious  risk  to  reproduction 
associated with mannitol. In some investigations, mannitol even had been used as a negative control 
because  of  its  lack  of  teratogenicity.  It  is  also  accepted  as  an  excipient  for  use  by  the  intravenous 
route. The available data do not preclude the use of inhaled mannitol during pregnancy.

Toxicokinetic data 
Table 1.  Studies providing toxicokinetic data 
Analytical methods for the quantification of mannitol in dog serum and BAL fluid were developed and 
validated satisfactorily.  
An issue of potential contamination of some pre-trial and control toxicokinetics samples in the 2-week 
dog  study  was  identified.  Even  though  no  clear  explanation  for  this  finding  was  identified,  based  on 
consistency  of  results  it  is  accepted  that  it  is  possible  to  draw  valid  conclusions  from  the  study.  It  is 
also accepted that it is unlikely that an explanation can be provided for this finding. 
BAL  samples  were  obtained  for  the  rat  investigative  study  for  3  animals  per  sex  per  group.  BAL 
analysis  indicated  that  concentrations  were  in  the  range  12600-60100 ng  mannitol/mL  for  the 
low-dose  (592-706 mg/kg/day)  group  and  10400-58900 ng  mannitol/mL  for  the  high-dose  (878-
1347 mg/kg/day)  group.  There  was  large  variability  noted  in  mannitol  levels  between  animals  from 
both groups, but animals had clearly been exposed to mannitol.   
In the 13-week repeat-dose study in rats, BAL was performed on satellite animals on day 1 and during 
weeks  7  and  13  and  the  resulting  fluid  assayed  for  mannitol  content.  The  applicant  reports  that  the 
data showed clear and dose-dependent levels of mannitol in the BAL fluid and thus provides “proof of 
exposure” for the study. 
Toxicokinetic analysis was performed in the investigative study in dogs on 3 sampling occasions (days 
1,  2  and  5).  Serum  concentration  levels  demonstrated  a  dose-related  increase  with  maximum  levels 
being reached within 0.5-1 hour post-dose. Pre-dose samples taken on days 2 and 5 of study indicated 
that there were very low residual levels of mannitol present. 
Bioanalysis investigations on day 1 and during weeks 13 and 26 of 26-week repeat-dose study in dogs 
revealed  that  all  low-  and  high-dose  group  animals  had  been  exposed  to  mannitol  as  evinced  by  the 
presence  of  test  item  in  serum.  The  serum  concentrations  showed  a  dose-related  increase  with 
maximum mean concentrations of approximately 280,000 ng/ml being reached within 1 hour post dose 
for  each  daily  dose  session.  There  were  no  substantive  gender  differences  in  serum  mannitol 
concentrations and there was no evidence of accumulation. Lung lavage data demonstrated there was 
a very low level of mannitol in the lungs 20-24 hours after the final exposure indicating rapid clearance

from the lungs. Overall, the toxicokinetic serum data clearly demonstrated good exposure of low- and 
high-dose animals to mannitol. 
In  the  rat  investigative  study,  BAL  analysis  indicated  that  concentrations  were  in  the  range  12600-
60100 ng  mannitol/mL 
for 
the 
low-dose  (592-706 mg/kg/day)  group  and  10400-58900 ng 
mannitol/mL  for  the  high-dose  (878-1347 mg/kg/day)  group.  For  the  13-week  repeat-dose  study  in 
rats,  the  applicant  reports  that  the  data  showed  clear  and  dose-dependent  levels  of  mannitol  in  the 
BAL fluid and thus provides “proof of exposure” for the study. 
In  the  2-  and  26-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  dogs,  it  was  noted  that  all  dosed  animals  had 
been  exposed  to  test  item  as  evidenced  by  the  presence  of  mannitol  in  serum  and  BAL  washes.  The 
serum  concentrations  detected  showed  a  dose-related  increase  with  maximum  mean  concentrations 
being  reached  within  1  hour  post-dose  for  each  of  the  two  daily  dosing  sessions.  Lung  lavage  data 
demonstrated  that  there  was  a  very  low  level  of  mannitol  in  the  lungs  20-24  hours  after  the  final 
exposure, indicating rapid clearance from the lungs. The increases in Cmax and AUC values (0-t and 0-
inf)  for  the  high-dosed  animals  compared  to  intermediate-dosed  animals  were  greater  than  the 
corresponding  increase  in  dose  (165  to  750  mg/kg/day)  indicating  saturation  of  elimination 
mechanisms and non-linear kinetics at doses above 165 mg/kg/day. 
Local Tolerance 
Local  tolerance  was  investigated  in  a  bovine  corneal  opacity  and  permeability  assay  and  an  eye 
irritation study in the rabbit, to cover the possibility of accidental delivery of the powder to the eyes. 
In a bovine corneal opacity and permeability assay corneal opacity and permeability were assessed and 
the scores combined to give an in vitro score that was assessed against a positive control (imidazole) 
and a saline negative control group. Mannitol, as a 20%w/w solution, was classified as negative in this 
assay and thus considered not a potential eye irritant. 
In an eye irritation study performed three New Zealand White strain rabbits were given a single ocular 
dose  of  78 mg  (0.1 ml)  of  mannitol  and  then  observed  for  reactions  to  instillation  during  a  period  of 
four  days.  Initial  instillation  induced  a  slight  pain  response  and  a  minimal  response  (injection  of  the 
conjunctival  blood  vessels)  in  all  animals  one  hour  after  dosing.  This  sign  persisted  overnight  in  two 
rabbits  but  all  rabbits  reverted  to  normal within  48 hours.  Mannitol was  assessed  as  “not  irritating  to 
the eyes”. 
There was no evidence of local irritation in either the respiratory tract in the repeat-dose studies or in 
the bovine corneal assay and the eye irritation study in the rabbit. 
Other toxicity studies 
The  identified  impurities  are  primarily  sorbitol,  maltitol  and  isomaltitol,  which  all  are  approved 
sweeteners.  The  levels  specified  for  impurities  have  been  adequately  justified  and  additional  toxicity 
studies are not considered necessary. 
Assessment  for  the  potential  for  immunotoxicity  was  undertaken  by  the  applicant  and  was  based  on 
the following studies: 26-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs with a 4-week recovery period and also 
in the 13-week rat study. The results of the flow cytometry examinations do not suggest any effects of 
treatment,  nor  were  there  any  effects  on  the  bone  marrow  that  would  indicate  immunotoxicity.  It  is 
concluded that there is no need for additional, specialised studies.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, mannitol is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant’s use of published data is deemed adequate in this case to support the pharmacodynamic 
action  of  the  product,  which  is  considered  to  be  via  hydration  of  the  pulmonary  secretions.  The  data 
cited support the conclusion that mannitol appears to induce mucin secretion to a greater extent than 
saline solution with similar osmolarity, although this difference was not statistically significant. Mucus 
secretion is markedly stimulated in response to hyperosmolarity. 
Published  data  on  repeat-dose  toxicity  from  rats,  mice  and  monkeys  did  not  show  any 
toxicologically-relevant signs of toxicity associated with the systemic administration of mannitol.  
The  bridging  programme  of  toxicity  studies  conducted  by  the  applicant  to  supplement  the  previously 
available data on other dosing routes is in line with the CHMP advice and is considered acceptable to 
support a marketing authorisation.  The study programme is considered adequate. 
Mannitol by inhalation was generally well tolerated in rats for 13 weeks under a regimen of dosing at 
doses up to 210 mg/kg/day for 180 minutes daily and in dogs at doses up to 713 mg/kg/day for two 1-
hour periods per day, although these were not no-effect doses. 
In  dogs,  BAL  cell  count investigations at  26  weeks  revealed  an  increase  in  absolute  white  cell  counts 
for mannitol-treated animals but this did not persist into the recovery period.  This finding is consistent 
with the observations made following the use of mannitol as a diagnostic agent and is not considered 
to represent a significant toxic risk. Coughing and enlarged local lymph nodes were found but did not 
persist during the recovery period.   
Most  findings  could  be  related  to  the  inhalation  of  a  large  particulate  load  and  were  generally 
reversible.  There was no specific target-organ or delayed toxicity in either species.   
There  was  an  issue  with  what  was  judged  to  be  contamination  of  some  pretrial  and  control 
toxicokinetics samples in the 2-week dog study.  There is no clear explanation for this finding but it is 
accepted  that  it  is  possible  to  draw  valid  conclusions  from  the  study.    It  is  also  accepted  that  it  is 
unlikely that a clear explanation can be provided for this finding.   
Literature data on the reproductive toxicity of mannitol have been adduced to demonstrate its absence 
of effects on fertility, embryo-fetal development and pre- and post-natal development.  While the data 
were derived from different dosing routes and the study designs were not in accordance with current 
guidelines, nonetheless, the data indicate that there is no risk to reproduction with mannitol.  In some 
instances, mannitol had been used as a negative control because of its lack of teratogenicity.  It is also 
accepted as an excipient for use by the intravenous route.   
There are no issues in respect of local tolerance, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  applicant  has  conducted  an  acceptable  non-clinical  bridging  programme  in  line  with  the  advice 
given by the CHMP in order to supplement the published data.

Pharmacodynamic action of the product is considered to be via hydration of the pulmonary secretions. 
Inhaled  mannitol  was  generally  well  tolerated;  most  findings  could  be  related  to  the  inhalation  of  a 
large  particulate  load  and  were  generally  reversible.  There  was  no  specific  target-organ  or  delayed 
toxicity of any concern in either species. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme of inhaled mannitol consisted or several studies, which include 5 
phase I studies, 3 phase II studies and 2 phase III studies. Two additional phase III studies in another 
indication provide supplementary information. 
GCP 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The  CHMP  requested  a  GCP  inspection  of  the  pivotal  clinical  study  DPM-CF-301.  The  GCP  inspection 
was  carried  out  at  one  investigator  site  in  the  United  Kingdom  (dates  of  inspection:  2nd  March  -  5th 
March  2010)  and  at  one  investigator  site  in  Ireland  (dates  of  inspection:  24th  February  –  26th 
February  2010).  Overall,  compliance  with  ICH  GCP  and  European  and  National  legislation  was 
considered satisfactory at both sites and the data presented in the application appear to be acceptable. 
None  of  the  inspection  findings  and  observations  were  thought  to  have  critical  consequences  for  the 
overall reliability of data.

*Bronchiectasis clinical trials DPM-B-201, 202 and 301 provide only safety data relevant for this MAA. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Mannitol is a known substance, since it has been used for decades as a pharmaceutical excipient and 
therapeutic  agent,  both  orally  and  intravenously.  It  has  been  approved  also  as  a  diagnostic 
pharmaceutical product for the inhalation route. This data are sufficient for not conducting full formal 
PK characterisation of the compound. 
The  applicant  has  submitted  two  studies  which  generated  pharmacokinetic  data  regarding  the  use  of 
inhaled  mannitol  relevant  to  its  use  in  cystic  fibrosis.  These  studies,  DPM-PK-101  (in  healthy 
volunteers)  and  DPM-PK-102  (in  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis)  used  inhaled  mannitol  in  doses 
representative of those proposed for use in the clinical setting. 
Study DPM-PK-101, a PK and bioavailability study of mannitol in healthy subjects, had an open-label, 
randomised,  three-way  crossover  design,  in  which  each  subject  received  mannitol  powder  as 
inhalation, orally and intravenously. All subjects were screened by receiving 635 mg mannitol powder 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 24/126
 
 
for inhalation (maximum dose administered clinically during the course of a negative challenge test) as 
the  mannitol  challenge  and  subjects  who  had  a  negative  test  result  and  satisfied  all  other  eligibility 
criteria were assigned to receive the three study treatments in random order. There was a minimum 7 
day  wash-out  period  between  Screening  and  Visit  1,  and  between  study  drug  administrations.  Blood 
samples  for  the  determination  of  mannitol  in  serum  were  started  at  12  hours  before  treatment. 
Samples were collected at -12 and -0.5 hr pre-dose and at 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 
and 24 hours post-dose. The trial population consisted of healthy male volunteers, 18-65 years of age 
with  no  history  of  asthma  or  other  chronic  diseases  which  could  compromise  the  airways  or  gut 
absorption.  According  to  the  protocol  18  subjects  would  enter  the  study  to  allow  15  subjects  to 
complete treatment. No subjects withdrew from the trial during the treatment period. The data from all 
subjects were analysed for pharmacokinetics and safety. 
Study  DPM-PK-101  results,  presented  below,  showed  only  relatively  minor  differences  in  dose-
normalised  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  a  635 mg  inhaled,  a  500 mg  oral  and  500 mg 
intravenous dose of mannitol.

Study DPM-PK-102, a PK study of inhaled mannitol after single and multiple dosing in CF patients, was 
a  multiple-centre,  open-label  study,  in  which  adult  and  paediatric  cystic  fibrosis  patients  received

mannitol powder for inhalation using a dry powder inhaler. Initially, as a part of the screening process, 
all  patients  were  to  receive  400  mg  mannitol  powder  for  inhalation  as  the  Mannitol  Tolerance  Test 
(MTT).  Patients  who  had a  negative  test  result  for airway  hyperresponsiveness  and  satisfied  all  other 
eligibility criteria were entered into the study to receive the study treatment. The treatment phase of 
the  study  lasted  for  7  days.  A  single  dose  of  400 mg  of  inhaled  mannitol  was  administered  on  the 
morning of Day 1 and then twice daily from Day 2 to 6 and the last multiple dose on the morning of 
Day 7. During the treatment period, patients attended the study centre for at least two visits. Patients 
were confined to the study centre for at least 12 hours on Days 1 and 7 for intensive blood sampling, 
while  additional  PK  samples  were  taken  on  the  mornings  of  Days  2  and  8  (24  hours  post-dose).  The 
trial population consisted of adult (18+ years) and adolescent (12-17 years) cystic fibrosis patients. 18 
patients (6 adult, 6 adolescent and 6 paediatric) were planned, while 9 (6 adults, 3 adolescents) were 
actually dosed and analysed. 
Study  DPM-PK-102  results,  presented  below,  showed  that  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  a  single 
dose  of  inhaled  mannitol  in  cystic  fibrosis  patients  did  not  show  significant  differences  from  healthy 
volunteers,  although  the  applied  dose  was  lower  (635 mg  in  healthy  volunteers  and  400 mg  in  cystic 
fibrosis patients). The pharmacokinetic properties in adults and adolescents were comparable. 
Table 4.  Mean (SD) serum PK parameters, study DPM-PK-102 
Absorption 
The systemic exposure to mannitol with the inhaled powder was investigated in healthy volunteers as 
well as in patients with cystic fibrosis. The absorbed fraction after inhalation (approximately 50-60 %) 
in healthy volunteers is comparable to that observed with the oral route.  
Based on the available data, no unexpected accumulation has been observed in cystic fibrosis patients. 
Distribution 
Since the low level of accumulation noted in the DPM-PK-102 is not significant, and there is no other 
evidence of accumulation in the body, distribution of inhaled mannitol was not specifically investigated 
in human PK studies. From literature data, oral mannitol distributes almost entirely in the extracellular 
fluid. 
Elimination 
Since the low level of accumulation noted in the DPM-PK-102 is not significant, and there is no other 
evidence of accumulation in the body, the metabolic pathway of inhaled mannitol was not specifically 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 26/126
 
 
 
investigated in human PK studies. From literature data, oral mannitol is mainly eliminated unchanged 
in the urine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Different  doses  of  mannitol  have  been  investigated  by  the  applicant  in  a  Phase  2  trial  (see  Dose 
response study below). 
Special populations 
Very limited data are available in paediatric patients (3 adolescent subjects) and no investigation was 
carried  out  in  younger  children.  Based  on  this  data  no  sound  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the 
pharmacokinetics in the paediatric population. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
PK  interaction  studies  have  not  been  performed  by  the  applicant,  justified  by  the  nature  and 
endogenous presence of mannitol. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Studies using human biomaterials have not been performed since they are deemed not relevant to the 
formulation. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic properties have been addressed with references to published literature. 
Mechanism of action 
Inhaled mannitol has two mechanisms of action that are particularly relevant to this application – as a 
hyperosmolar  agent  creating  a  osmotic  gradient  in  the  airways  and  as  an  agent  which  can  induce 
bronchospasm. 
Mannitol’s intended mechanism of action is related to its potential as a hyperosmolar agent to create 
an osmotic gradient in airways that facilitates an efflux of water into the airway lumen. This efflux of 
water  is  thought  to  increase  the  water  content  in  the  ASL,  and  thus  decrease  viscosity  of  sputum  to 
promote the clearance of the mucus by cilia. 
Induction of bronchospasm is the opposite pharmacodynamic effect to that intended for patients with 
CF (an increase in FEV 1). Published data indicate that inhaled mannitol increases the osmolarity in the 
airways  which  results  in  a  release  of  different  bronchoconstriction  mediators  from  inflammatory  cells 
within the airways. 
Inhaled mannitol is licensed in the EU to identify bronchial responsiveness in subjects with a baseline 
FEV 1 of >70% predicted. Ascending doses are given from 5 mg up to a maximum cumulative dose of 
635  mg.  To  circumvent  the  difficulty  of  bronchospasm  induction,  patients  with  asthma  are  excluded 
from  the  requested  indication  and  patients  are  required  to  undergo  an  initial  challenge  with  inhaled 
mannitol with close supervision of airway function. Before treating with mannitol, patients are also pre-
medicated with an inhaled beta agonist. Despite excluding patients with a history of asthma and pre-
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 27/126
 
 
medicating with an inhaled beta agonist, one published trial in CF found that 6 of 49 subjects still had a 
fall in FEV 1 of >15% (mean 17%) with a mean provocative dose of mannitol of 270 mg9. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Results of a published study10 showed that neither mannitol nor hypertonic saline (HS), combined with 
coughing,  improved  bronchial  mucus  clearance  during  intervention  period,  but  after  90  minutes  the 
total clearance was significantly higher for both mannitol and HS compared to control treatments. The 
mean  clearance  at  the  end  of  the  study  (i.e.  120  minutes)  was  28%  and  19%  for  the  mannitol  and 
empty capsule plus coughing, respectively (p < 0.01). The mean clearance was 31% and 21% for HS 
and physiological saline plus coughing, respectively (p < 0.01). The authors concluded that dry powder 
mannitol is a potential mucoactive agent in CF patients. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  two  studies  presented  in  this  submission  show  that  inhaled  mannitol  presents  very  similar 
pharmacokinetic properties to those seen with a similar oral dose and intravenous delivery systems. No 
significant  differences  were  seen  in  healthy  volunteers.  Of  importance  the  second  study  establishes 
that  at  the  proposed  dose  of  circa  400 mg  cystic  fibrosis  patients  present  similar  PK  characteristics 
seen with healthy volunteers.  
Published data indicate that inhaled mannitol increases the osmolarity in the airways which results in a 
release  of  different  bronchoconstriction  mediators  from  inflammatory  cells  within  the  airways. 
Therefore,  a  mannitol  tolerance  test  (MTT)  is  required  to  exclude  patients  with  bronchial 
hyperreactivity from the treatment with inhaled mannitol. This requirement is stated as a prerequisite 
measure  in  the  SPC  proposed  by  the  applicant.  A  positive  test  to  mannitol  is  stated  as  a 
contraindication  of  the  product.  The  MTT  criteria  proposed  in  the  SPC  of  Inhaled  mannitol  are  in 
accordance  with  the  MTT  criteria  adopted  for  currently  approved  inhaled  mannitol  for  diagnostic  use 
i.e.  threshold  of  fall  in  FEV1  i.e.    20%  from  baseline  for  considering  the  MTT  as  positive.  This 
corresponds  to  the  criteria  applied  in  Phase  3  studies.  Of  note,  a  fall  of  20%  in  FEV1  is  considerably 
greater than the mean benefit in FEV1 as demonstrated in the Phase 3 trials.  
Hyper-responsiveness  was  not  controlled  further  during  the  course  of  the  clinical  studies  that  were 
submitted and several patients withdrew with symptoms that might have been induced by mannitol. It 
is  not  clear  if  the  timing  of  the  pre-medication  with  an  inhaled  beta  agonist  adequately  reversed  the 
bronchoconstrictor  effect  of  mannitol  over  the  whole  treatment  course.  Thus  mannitol  induced 
bronchoconstriction  may have  been  more  marked  than  at  the  time  of  spirometry.  Whether  long  term 
treatment with mannitol would have any impact on bronchial reactivity in cystic fibrosis patients is not 
documented.  Such  a  survey  should  be  part  of  the  safety  assessment  for  the  chronic  use  of  inhaled 
mannitol.  
In  the  clinical  studies  submitted  by  the  applicant,  the  rate  of  positive  mannitol  tolerance  test  at 
screening varied from 8 % to 30 % of the recruited patients. Patients with severe illness were excluded 
and were not tested. It is foreseen that in clinical practice mannitol treatment would be contraindicated 
in a significant proportion of patients. Patients who showed less than a 20% fall in FEV1 on screening 
may show a greater fall in FEV1 during an exacerbation and this possibility has not been investigated. 
Adverse  events  during  the  trial  and  during  12  month's  open  label  use  suggest  that  symptoms

attributable  to  pharyngeal  and  bronchial  irritation  may  be  common.  It  is  possible  that  the  thorough 
pre-treatment  bronchoprovocation  screening  and  pre-medication  with  a  bronchodilator  might  not  be 
carried out as thoroughly in clinical practice as they were in the clinical trial. 
The  applicant  has  claimed  a  sustained  effect  compared  to  hypertonic  saline,  but  this  claim  is  not 
supported with adequate data. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
PK  characteristics  of  inhaled  mannitol  in  CF  patients  are  in  line  with  PK  characteristics  in  healthy 
volunteers and other routes of administration (oral and intravenous). 
References  to  published  literature  justify  the  absence  of  pharmacodynamic  studies  with  inhaled 
mannitol. 
The impact of long term treatment with mannitol on bronchial hyperresponsiveness is not documented 
in  the  dossier  and  therefore  remains  unclear.  This  is  especially  important  for  clinical  practice,  where 
pre-treatment  bronchoprovocation  screening  and  pre-medication  with  a  bronchodilator  might  not  be 
carried out as thoroughly as in clinical trials. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  main  studies  for  clinical  efficacy  evaluation  are  a  dose  response  phase  II  study  DPM-CF-202,  a 
phase II study in children DPM-CF-203, a phase II study DPM-CF-201 and the pivotal phase III studies 
DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302.

Study DPM-CF-202: A Phase IIa Randomised, Open Label, Dose Response Study to 
Determine the Optimum Dose of Dry Powder Mannitol Required to Generate Clinical 
Improvement in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis 
This was a phase IIa, randomised open label, dose response, cross-over, multicenter study in which 48 
cystic  fibrosis  patients  (ITT  population)  received  4  doses  of  inhaled  mannitol:  40 mg  (1  x  40 mg 
capsule),  120 mg  (3  x  40 mg  capsules),  240 mg  (6  x  40 mg  capsules)  and  400 mg  (10  x  40 mg 
capsules) twice daily via a dry powder inhaler device for 2 weeks in a random order. Patients in the ITT 
population  were  aged  from  6  to  68  years  including  19  adults  (older  than  18  years)  and  29 
children/adolescents  (6  to  11  years:    n  =  18;  12  to  17  years:  n  =  11).  The  study  objective  was  to 
determine  the  dose  of  dry  powder  Mannitol  required  to  generate  clinical  improvement  in  FEV1  in 
subjects with cystic fibrosis. Duration of the study  was 13 weeks, including four treatment periods of 
two weeks with one week washout.

Figure 2.  Percent change in FEV1 by dose arm, study DPM-CF-202, ITT population 
A clear dose effect between 40 mg to 400 mg was observed in this study as well as a dose dependent 
improvement in lung function as measured by absolute FEV1 value and FVC. The 400 mg dose was the 
most efficacious whereas the 40 mg dose did not demonstrate any efficacy. The 120 mg and 240 mg 
doses  showed  some  efficacy,  however,  the  effect  was  smaller  than  that  of  400  mg.  It  cannot  be 
established whether the 400 mg dose reached the plateau effect as no higher doses were tested. There 
were few differences between the doses in other spirometric measurements evaluated (FEF 25-75 and 
PEF). 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study DPM-CF-301: Long Term Administration of Inhaled Dry Powder Mannitol in Cystic 
Fibrosis – A Safety and Efficacy Study 
Methods 
This  was  a  multicenter,  26  week  double  blind,  randomised,  2  parallel  groups,  controlled,  trial  to 
compare  inhaled  mannitol  400  mg  twice  daily  to  a  control  group  receiving  inhaled  mannitol  in  a 
“subtherapeutic” dose of 50 mg twice daily. 
Study Participants 
This  study  included  patients  from  6  years  of  age  with  mild  to  moderate  cystic  fibrosis  but  excluded 
severe  conditions  and  advanced  stage  of  the  disease.  Subjects  needed  to  have  FEV1  >30  and  <90% 
predicted  and  to  pass  the  mannitol  tolerance  test  to  enter  the  study.  Pregnant,  breast-feeding  and 
intolerant to mannitol or beta-agonists subjects and subjects with concomitant use of beta blockers or 
hypertonic saline were excluded.

Treatments 
Patients in the active group received 400 mg (10 x 40 mg capsule) of mannitol twice daily, and in the 
control group 50 mg (10 x 5 mg capsules) of mannitol twice daily. Patients received the therapy for 26 
weeks via CE marked DPI Type RS01 Model 7 HR. 
RhDNase  use  was  permitted  and  the  randomisation  was  stratified  on  rhDNase  status  at  baseline 
(rhDNase user or rhDNase non users). If rhDNase use was initiated or ceased during the course of the 
study, the stratum was not adjusted. 
Objectives 
The study was aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of inhaled mannitol for treatment of CF. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the change in absolute FEV1 over 26 weeks of therapy. 
Secondary Efficacy endpoints were: 
  Change from baseline in absolute FEV1 by rhDNase treatment over 26 weeks 
  Responders  at  week  26  on  the  basis  of  a  100  ml  or  >5%  change  in  FEV1  or  total  cohort  and  by 
rhDNase use 
 
Pulmonary exacerbations – protocol defined and all exacerbations for total cohort and by rhDNase 
use 
  Hospital admissions – protocol defined and all pulmonary exacerbations 
  Quality of Life Scores using Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- R for total cohort and by rhDNase use 
  Responders at week 26 on the basis of a change in QoL which is ≥ 5 points for total cohort and by 
rhDNase use; Rescue antibiotics use (number of agents, course and days of use)  
  Change from baseline in FVC, FEF25-75 over 26 weeks overall and by rhDNase use 
  Days in hospital due to pulmonary exacerbations – protocol defined and all exacerbations 
A  protocol  defined  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PDPE)  was  any  exacerbation  treated  with  IV  antibiotics 
and  associated  with  at  least  four  of  the  following  signs  and  symptoms:  change  in  sputum  production 
(volume,  colour,  consistency),  dyspnoea,  new  or  increased  haemoptysis,  malaise  fatigue  or  lethargy, 
fever  >38  degrees  Celsius,  anorexia  or  weight  loss,  sinus  pain  or  tenderness,  change  in  sinus 
discharge,  FVC  or  FEV1  decreased  by  >10%  from  previous  recorded  value,  radiographic  signs 
indicative of pulmonary infection, increased cough, changes in physical examination of the chest. 
A pulmonary exacerbation (PE) did not have to meet the aforementioned additional criteria. 
Sample size 
340  subjects  were  intended  to  be  randomised  to  treatment.    Approximately  two  thirds  of  these 
subjects  were  expected  to  be  using  rhDNase  and  approximately  20%  of  subjects  were  forecasted  to 
withdraw  prior  to  week  26.  Therefore,  approximately  163  evaluable  subjects  were  estimated  to 
complete  the  mannitol  treatment  and  109  evaluable  subjects  in  the  control  treatment.  It  was 
estimated that of these evaluable subjects, approximately 109 subjects in the mannitol group and 73 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 32/126
 
 
subjects in the control group would be taking concurrent rhDNase. The study was powered to detect a 
FEV 1 change of 70 mL from baseline in the ITT population at week 26. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was to be applied to subjects who passed the mannitol tolerance test in a ratio of 3:2 
(mannitol  400mg  BD:  control).  The  randomisation  was  stratified  by  rhDNase  use  and  region  (Europe 
vs.  Australia)  but  not  by  sites,  age  or  severity  of  the  disease.  250  randomisation  numbers  (150 
mannitol and 100 control) were generated for each stratum, in blocks of 5. The randomisation number 
was assigned sequentially within each stratum. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  investigators,  site  staff,  pharmacists,  subjects,  monitors,  project  managers  and  data  managers 
were  blinded  throughout  the  study.  Both  active  and  control  treatments  consisted  of  ten  identical 
capsules. The use of opaque capsules was aimed at masking the difference in the capsule fill volume. 
Statistical methods 
For change in FEV1 an analysis of this endpoint at Visit 2/Week 6, Visit 3/Week 14 and Visit 4/Week 26 
was conducted using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The following main effect 
terms were specified in the applied model: treatment group, visit week, gender, rhDNase user status 
at screening, region of participation, baseline FEV1, baseline percent predicted FEV 1, and age. 
An AR(1) covariance structure was used. For each study visit, the difference between treatments was 
determined  as  the  difference  in  least  squares  means  for  mannitol  –  control  and  was  presented  with 
95% confidence limits. Overall, the statistical significance of the difference was estimated using the P-
value for the term for treatment in the model.  
A further model was fitted with a term for treatment-by-time interaction to obtain least square means 
(with  95%  confidence  limits)  for  each  treatment  group  for  each  timepoint.  The  analyses  described 
above were repeated by rhDNase use (using a three way interaction model for time-by-treatment-by-
rhDNase  use).  Data  summaries  are  also  provided  for  the  paediatric/adolescent  population  but  no 
analyses were undertaken. 
No  imputation  for  missing  data  was  planned.  Analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  conducted 
using a mixed model (within SAS PROC Mixed) where all available data are used. The applicant states 
that  missing  values  are  not  problematic,  provided  the  data  are  missing  at  random.  The  only  missing 
data  for  FEV1  was  due  to  premature  withdrawal  of  subjects.  A  Kaplan  Meier  plot  was  produced  to 
explore the pattern of withdrawal. 
For the key secondary endpoints apart from FEV1, namely pulmonary exacerbations and antibiotic use, 
the  time  in  the  study  was  incorporated  in  the  analysis  through  the  use  of  a  negative  binomial  model 
with exposure time as an offset variable. Hence no imputation for missing data was considered to be 
required. 
ITT population was defined as those subjects randomised who had completed study visit 1 at week 0, 
i.e. received at least one dose of study medication.

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted from 5 April 2007 to 24 April 2009 in 40 study sites in UK, Australia, Ireland 
and New Zealand. 
2  amendments  to  study  protocol  were  made  prior  to  study  initiation  and  included  administrative 
changes  and  changes  recommended  during  scientific  advice/protocol  assistance  (adding  MTT  test, 
removing  200 mg  group,  introducing  stratification  by  rhDNase  use,  defining  PDPE  criteria  and 
removing CRP analysis and chest X-ray). There have been 2 amendments to Study Protocol during the 
study, increasing number of participants, introducing interim safety evaluation, administrative changes 
and open-label extension phase.

Table 5.  Demographic Characteristics of ITT Population, study DPM-CF-301 
Numbers analysed 
389  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  324  of  those  were  randomised.  The  ITT  population 
consisted  of  295  subjects  (177  mannitol,  118  control)  and  the  PP  population  –  of  200  subjects  (111 
mannitol, 89 control). 
Approximately a quarter of the patients on mannitol treatment (45 of 177, 25.4%) were excluded from 
the PP population because of failure to record both a baseline (Visit 1) lung function measurement or 
at least one measurement at a timepoint (Visits 2, 3 or 4) during treatment.  For the control arm the 
percentage was considerably lower (15 of 118, 12.7%), although still relatively high.

Outcomes and estimation 
The  analysis  submitted  by  the  applicant  showed  a  significant  treatment  effect  at  week  26  as  change 
from baseline in absolute FEV 1: + 92.9 ml as compared to the control group (p<0.001).  
Figure 4.  Absolute Change in FEV 1 (mL) by Timepoint 
The overall treatment effect over 26 weeks (defined primary efficacy endpoint) was 54.17 ml (95% CI: 
24.73, 83.60) and was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
When the analysis was performed in stratified subgroups defined by the rhDNase status at screening, 
the between groups difference in FEV 1 at week 26 was statistically significant in the so called rhDNase 
users strata (108 ml) but not in the so called rhDNase non users strata (69 ml). However, it appears 
that the mean change in absolute FEV1 was higher in the strata of rhDNase non users as compared to 
the strata of rhDNase users.

Similar  patterns  were  seen  in  other  spirometric  parameters  but  the  absolute  change  from  baseline  in 
FEF25-75 and PEF were not found to be significantly different between the 2 groups. 
The  secondary  parameters  associated  with  pulmonary  exacerbation  rate,  hospitalisations,  Quality  of 
Life  and  use  of  systemic  antibiotics  did  not  show  any  significant  differences  between  patients  using 
rhDnase  with  mannitol  or  mannitol  alone.  However,  trends  were  noted  in  favour  of  the  patients 
receiving rhDNase and mannitol together as compared with mannitol alone.

Ancillary analyses 
A post hoc analysis of the rate of responders was performed in the population of patients completing 
the 26 weeks study with both baseline and visit 4 values for FEV 1 (responders were defined as mean 
improvement from baseline in FEV 1 of >100 ml or >5% (relative to baseline), or >5% relative change 
in % predicted were considered as responders. Among the completers receiving mannitol 400 mg BD 
only  41.4  %  (n=48  patients/116  completers)  had  more  than  5%  increase  in  FEV1  %  predicted.  This 
represents 48/177 = 27 % of the ITT population initially randomised to mannitol 400 mg BD. The rate 
of responders to mannitol 400 mg BD, as determined in a post hoc analysis, appears to be rather low. 
Upon request from the CHMP the applicant performed analysis of change in FEV1 efficacy outcomes in 
% predicted, which are presented below.

Since approximately 30% of the patients discontinued from the study, in some cases without providing 
any post baseline value of FEV 1, a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to handle missing data. 
Figure 10.  Sensitivity analysis for primary endpoint in study CF-301 
The  applicant  has  provided  an  ancillary  analysis  in  the  adolescent/paediatric  population.  The  ITT 
(safety) population included 105 patients consisting of 48 paediatrics from 6 to 11 years (mannitol 400 
mg : 31) and 57 adolescents from 12 to 17 years (mannitol 400 mg: 32). There was also a high rate of 
premature withdrawals more in adolescent (31.5%) than in paediatrics (25%), and the 2 groups were 
unbalanced  (no  stratification  was  planned  by  age).  Few  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  this  analysis. 
Basically, no significant difference was shown on FEV 1 between the treatment groups. For the FEF 25-
75  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  even  lesser  in  the  mannitol  400  mg  group  as  compared  to  the 
control group.

Methods 
This  was  a  multicenter,  26  week  double  blind,  randomised,  2  parallel  groups,  controlled,  trial  to 
compare  inhaled  mannitol  400  mg  twice  daily  to  a  control  group  receiving  inhaled  mannitol  in 
“subtherapeutic” dose of 50 mg twice daily. 
Study Participants 
This  study  included  patients  above  6  years  of  age  with  mild  to  moderate  cystic  fibrosis  but  excluded 
severe  conditions  and  advanced  stage  of  the  disease.  Subjects  needed  to  have  FEV1  >40  and  <90% 
predicted  and  to  pass  mannitol  tolerance  test  to  enter  the  study.  Pregnant,  breast-feeding  and 
intolerant to mannitol or beta-agonists subjects and subjects with concomitant use of beta blockers or 
hypertonic saline were excluded, as well as subjects who have had a significant episode of haemoptysis 
(> 60 ml) in the previous three months or had selected serious health conditions.

Treatments 
Patients  in  active  group  received  400  mg  (10  x  40  mg  capsule)  of  mannitol  twice  daily,  and  in  the 
control group 50 mg (10 x 5 mg capsules) of mannitol twice daily. Patients received the therapy for 26 
weeks via CE marked DPI Type RS01 Model 7 HR.  
RhDNase  use  was  permitted  and  the  randomisation  was  stratified  on  rhDNase  status  at  baseline 
(rhDNase user or rhDNase non users). If rhDNase use was initiated or ceased during the course of the 
study, the stratum was not adjusted. 
Objectives 
The study was aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of inhaled mannitol for treatment of CF. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint was change in absolute FEV1 over 26 weeks of therapy. 
Secondary Efficacy endpoints were: 
 
 
FEV 1 change from baseline (ml) in the rhDNase group 
Pulmonary exacerbations in those taking rhDNase as a sub-group and in the total cohort 
  Quality of life scores using Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-R 
  Rescue antibiotic use (number of agents, course and days of use) 
  Change in absolute FVC, FEF25-75 from baseline 
  Number of days in hospital due to pulmonary exacerbations 
  Qualitative sputum microbiology  
  Quantitative sputum microbiology for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa 
Sample size 
300  subjects  were  intended  to  be  randomised  to  treatment.    Approximately  two  thirds  of  these 
subjects  were  expected  to  be  using  rhDNase  and  approximately  30%  of  subjects  were  forecasted  to 
withdraw  prior  to  week  26.  Therefore,  approximately  126  evaluable  subjects  were  estimated  to 
complete the mannitol treatment and 84 evaluable subjects in the control treatment. It was estimated 
that  of  these  evaluable  subjects,  approximately  84  subjects  in  the  mannitol  group  would  be  taking 
concurrent rhDNase.  
The study was planned to have 98% powered to detect a FEV1 change of 120 mL in the ITT population 
at week 26 and 80% power in the rhDNase users.  
Randomisation 
Randomisation  was  to  be  applied  to  subjects  who  passed  mannitol  tolerance  test  in  a  ratio  of  3:2 
(mannitol 400mg BD: control). The randomisation was stratified by rhDNase use and country but not 
by  sites,  age  or  severity  of  the  disease.  300  randomisation  numbers  (180  mannitol  and  120  control) 
were generated for each stratum, in blocks of 5 which were paired for rhDNase users and non-users.

Blinding (masking) 
The  investigators,  site  staff,  pharmacists,  subjects,  monitors,  project  managers  and  data  managers 
were  blinded  throughout  the  study.  Both  active  and  control  treatments  consisted  of  ten  identical 
capsules. The use of opaque capsules was aimed at masking the difference in the capsule fill volume. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods were similar to the methods applied in study CF-301. In addition, for primary 
endpoint  analysis  a  treatment  group  by  visit  week  interaction  was  also  included  in  the  MMRM  model. 
The analysis also did not include week 0 in assessment of the treatment effect, which was included in 
the pre-defined analysis for study CF-301.

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted from 3 September 2008 to 12 April 2010 in 53 study sites in USA, Canada, 
Argentina, Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. 
There  have  been  2  amendments  to  Study  Protocol,  increasing  number  of  participants,  introducing 
minor changes in MTT, randomisation and unblinding procedures as well as administrative changes. 
Baseline data 
The overview of baseline data of subjects has been provided by the applicant for the safety population 
which is identical to defined (modified) ITT population (all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study medication).

Outcomes and estimation 
Change  in  absolute  FEV 1  across  the  study  duration  is  presented  below.  At  week  26  the  difference 
between treatments was 72.19 ml. 
Figure 14.  Absolute Change in FEV 1 (ml) by timepoint, study CF-302 
The analysis of primary endpoint showed overall treatment effect over 26 weeks in change in absolute 
FEV 1 of 54.14 ml as compared to the control group, which was not statistically significant (p=0.059). 
The  applicant  performed  a  post  hoc  corrected  baseline  analysis  (based  on  average  of  screening  and 
baseline FEV1) using the MMRM model. 
Table 10.  Overall Treatment Effect FEV1 (mL), study CF-302 
The applicant has presented results also as FEV1 in % predicted, which showed treatment difference of 
2.42 % predicted at 26 weeks (p=0.024).

Table 11.  Overall Treatment Effect on FEV1 (% predicted), study CF-302 
When the analysis was performed in stratified subgroups defined by the rhDNase status at screening, 
the  between  groups  difference  in  FEV1  at  week  26  was  not  statistically  significant  in  either  of  strata, 
while the trend was favourable for mannitol (overall treatment effect in rhDNase users 43.49 ml, p = 
0.177,  and  in  non-users  86.5  ml,  p=0.124).  As  in  study  CF-301,  also  in  this  study  it  appears  that 
effect  on  absolute  FEV1  was  higher  in  the  strata  of  rhDNase  non  users  as  compared  to  the  strata  of 
rhDNase users.

There  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  mean  change  over  baseline  for  either  treatment  group  or 
between treatment groups for any of the QoL domains. 
Ancillary analyses 
In  order  to  address  the  high  number  of  patients  discontinued  from  the  study  (though  lower  than  in 
study CF-301), a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to handle missing data.

Effect of treatment on absolute change in FEV1 (ml) was 81.13 (95% CI -45.30 to 207.57, p=0.21) in 
children  aged  6  –  11  years,  -9.50  (95%  CI  -108.86  to  89.86,  p=0.85)  in  adolescents  aged  12  –  17 
years and 85.94 (95% CI 4.63 to167.26, p=0.038) in adults. 
Treatment effect on FVC (ml) in children was 71.63 (95% CI -63.8 to 207.1, p=0.299), in adolescents 
6.64 (95% CI -100.3 to 113.6, p=0.903) and in adults 113.77 (95% CI 26.14 to 201.4, p=0.011). 
Effect of treatment on FEF25-75 (ml/s) was 58.69 (95% CI-158.43 to 275.82, p =0.59) in children, -
49.92 (95% CI -222.09 to 122.25, p=0.569) in adolescents and 71.51 (95%CI -69.40 to 212.42, p= 
0.319) in adults.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The applicant has presented efficacy analysis across phase 3 trials. For the change in FEV1 the results 
are  presented  below  in  comparison  to  the  results  of  individual  studies.  For  pooled  data  the  overall 
treatment effect over 26 weeks is estimated for FEV1 as 2.12 % predicted. However as the results of 
the two studies are not consistent a pooled analysis is not considered appropriate.

Clinical studies in special populations 
One phase II study was conducted in children. 
Study DPM-CF-203: A cross-over comparative study of inhaled Mannitol, alone and in 
combination with daily rhDNase, in children with cystic fibrosis 
This  was  an  open  label,  multicentre,  randomised,  cross-over,  comparative  study.  After  satisfying 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  subjects  were  given  the  mannitol  tolerance  test  to  screen  for  airway 
hyper-reactivity.  Those  with  a  negative  MTT  test  result  were  randomised  to  one  of  three  cross-over 
treatments  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  for  12  weeks  either  400  mg  Mannitol  twice  daily,  2.5  mg 
rhDNase  daily,  or  400  mg  Mannitol  twice  daily  plus  2.5  mg  rhDNase  daily  according  to  one  of  six 
treatment  schedules,  which  were  also  randomly  assigned.  All  subjects  received  all  three  treatments. 
There was a two week washout period prior to each treatment.

Treatment presented in 
incorrect order: 
No statistically significant differences in FEV 1 or FVC changes were observed when comparing rhDNase 
treatment  to  either  Mannitol  or  rhDNase  plus  Mannitol  treatment.  No  other  spirometry  results  were 
significantly different between the arms. The change in FEV1 was smaller in the Mannitol plus rhDNase 
arm than either the rhDNase or Mannitol alone arms (0.8% vs 9.1% vs 6.4% in ITT analysis and 1.0% 
vs 9.3% and 8.3% in the PP analysis). The rhDNase and Mannitol alone treatments resulted in similar 
spirometry improvements. 
However,  there  was  a  trend  for  a  smaller  effect  when  rhDNase  and  mannitol  were  both  used  as 
compared  to  rhDNase  used  alone  (mean  percentage  change  in  FEV1  between  mannitol+rhDNase  and 
rhDNase alone = - 4.3 %; [95% CI: -14.1 to +6.5]). The same trends were also shown on FEF 25-75

Figure 18.  FEV 1 (l) by visit and treatment arm in ITT population, study DPM-CF-203 
No significant differences were noted in Quality of Life CFQ-R scores when the rhDNase treatment arm 
was compared to either of the Mannitol or rhDNase plus Mannitol arms. The Mannitol plus rhDNase arm 
showed the biggest reduction in score (worsening of symptoms). No significant differences were noted 
for  any  respiratory  symptoms  questions  between  the  comparator  treatment,  rhDNase,  and  the  other 
two treatment arms. The comparison between the rhDNase and Mannitol treatment arms for tiredness, 
while  not  significant,  had  a  probability  of  0.078,  with  subjects  reporting  less  tiredness  during  the 
Mannitol treatment arm. 
Sputum microbiology results showed no notable changes in microbial growth in any treatment arm. 
The  rhDNase  arm  had  3  (14.3%)  patients  who  reported  an  exacerbation,  while  there  were  also  3 
(13.0%)  patients  (p  =  1.000)  in  the  mannitol  arm  and  6 (26.1%)  patients  (p  =  0.2568)  in  the 
rhDNase  plus  mannitol  arm.  These  observations  would  rather  suggest  a  lesser  efficiency  of  the 
mucocilliary clearance when mannitol was associated to rhDNase. 
Supportive study 
DPM-CF-201 A Phase 2 Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Dry Powder 
Mannitol in Cystic Fibrosis 
This  was  a  randomised,  multicentre,  double-blinded,  controlled,  crossover,  phase  II  study  primarily 
determining  the  efficacy  of  inhaled  mannitol  in  improving  lung  function  and  quality  of  life  in  subjects 
with cystic fibrosis. Study included subjects with a known diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, of either gender, 
aged  8 years, having a baseline FEV1 of between 40% and 80% of the predicted normal value or a 
decline in FEV 1 of greater than 20% in the last twelve months. This study was conducted in a sample 
of  37  patients  (ITT)  aged  from  8  to  48  years  (mean:  19  years)  who  received  420  mg  BD  inhaled 
mannitol and non-respirable mannitol (average particle diameter 68 microns, fine particle fraction less 
than 2%) for 2 weeks in a cross over design. At visits 2 and 4 the initial dose of study medication was 
administered i.e. 30mg of Inhaled mannitol or control x 14 capsules (a dose of 420mg) twice a day. A 
bronchodilator (salbutamol 100 mcg, 4 puffs) was inhaled 15 minutes prior to a treatment. Dry powder 
inhaler  devices  were  used  for  administration.  The  DPM-CF-201  protocol  was  amended  twice  before

enrolment  commenced.  The  main  changes  in  these  amendments  were  the  lowering  of  entry  age  to 8 
years. 
Primary  Objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine  the  effect  of  two  weeks  twice  daily  treatment  with 
Inhaled mannitol (inhaled mannitol) on FEV 1 in subjects with cystic fibrosis. 
Figure 19.  Subject Disposition in study DPM-CF-201 
Treatment with Inhaled mannitol led to a 7.0 ± 1.9% (mean ± SE) increase in the FEV1 (p<0.001) and 
this  increase  was  significant  compared  to  the  change  on  placebo  treatment  (p<0.01).  The  absolute 
increase in FEV 1 on Inhaled mannitol treatment was 121 ± 33 ml (mean ± SE). The mean FEV1 % of 
normal  predicted  increased  from  62%  at  baseline  to  66%  i.e.  LS  mean  FEV 1  (expressed  as  %  of 
normal predicted value) change from baseline was + 3.86% (SD  1.08).  
Although  statistically  significant  (p<0.01)  as  compared  to  the  control  group  (LS  mean  change  from 
baseline  in  the  control  group=  -  0.09),  the  improvement  from  baseline  appeared  very  weak.  The 
change  from  baseline  of  FEV1  %  of  predicted  was  under  the  threshold  of  5%  usually  considered  as 
clinically  significant.  FEV1/FVC,  FEF25-75  and  PEF  increase  were  not  significant  on  inhaled  mannitol 
treatment  group  as  compared  to  control  (p=0.3).  The  differences  in  respiratory  symptoms  and 
respiratory domains of CF QOL questionnaire were very small and not clinically relevant.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  are  of  identical  design  (multicenter,  26  week  double  blind, 
randomised,  2  parallel  groups,  controlled,  trial  to  compare  inhaled  mannitol  400  mg  twice  daily  to  a 
control group receiving inhaled mannitol in a “subtherapeutic” dose of 50 mg twice daily).  
Subjects less than 6 years of age were not considered for Phase 3 trials since mannitol tolerance test 
(MTT)  and  reliable  spirometry  measurements  are  not  adequately  achievable  in  children  and  infants 
Bronchitol

below this age. This is justified since children below 6 years of age are generally not able to use a dry 
powder inhaler.  
During  the  assessment  the  applicant  limited  the  proposed  indication  to  adults  (aged  18  years  and 
above) only, however data on all age groups is being analysed in order to assess the consistency. 
The  doses  of  400  mg  for  the  active  treatment  and  50  mg  for  control  group  were  chosen  by  the 
applicant based mainly on the results from the dose response 2 week Phase II trial DPM-CF-202 where 
the 400 mg dose was shown to be the most efficacious whereas the 40 mg dose did not demonstrate 
any efficacy. The applicant stated that the 40 mg fill capsules were chosen for the phase 3 studies as 
this  was  the  largest  dose  that  could  effectively  be  delivered  via  the  intended  inhaler  device.  With 
consideration  that  utilizing  more  than  10  capsules  may  overly  compromise  subject’s  compliance  with 
treatment,  the  applicant  considered  that  400  mg  dose  was  the  most  appropriate  balance  between 
acceptability/tolerability and efficacy. Because the control had to be delivered across 10 capsules and 5 
mg was the smallest available fill, a final dose of 50 mg (5 mg x 10) was selected as control group for 
this  study.  During  study  DPM-CF-202,  however,  the  plateau  was  not  reached  and  it  is  therefore  not 
known, what effect higher doses would have. 
In  study  DPM-CF-302  better  training was  provided  to  study  personnel  at  the  sites  which led  to  fewer 
dropouts  (a  decrease  from  around  30%  to  around  15%  in  study  DPM-CF-302).  The  other  main 
difference between the two studies was the percentage of patients under 18 which was around 50% in 
study DPM-CF-302 compared to approximately 36% in study DPM-CF-301. 
The population in study DPM-CF-301 included patients aged from 6 to 59 years.  However no attempt 
was  made  to  stratify  the  randomisation  into  different  age  ranges  or  to  ensure  that  the  sample  size 
provided sufficient patients in each age group. However it was recognised that children (aged 6 - 11), 
adolescents  (aged  12  –  17)  and  adults  aged  18  years  and  above  formed  three  clear  subgroups.  
Furthermore  it  has  been  suggested  in  the  literature  that  treatment  for  cystic  fibrosis  has  improved 
considerably in recent years so that children born more recently will possibly have received better care 
immediately  after  diagnosis  improving  their  lung  function  more  than  what  was  possible  for  patients 
born  earlier.  Also  the  choice  of  the  primary  endpoint  based  on  lung  function  is  problematic  in  such 
broad  population  as  FEV 1  will  naturally  increase  as  children  and  adolescents  grow  in  height,  thereby 
increasing the size of lung. 
Although the block size chosen for the randomisation scheme in study DPM-CF-301 was small and the 
majority (30) of the 40 centres recruited 5 or more patients, the randomisation was not stratified by 
centre resulting in an imbalance in the majority of centres. This is considered to be a serious deficiency 
in  the  study  and  prevents  adjustment  of  the  statistical  analysis  for  any  possible  centre  effects. 
Furthermore, no estimates of treatment difference by centre have been presented making it difficult to 
confirm  the  homogeneity  of  effect  across  the  centres.  No  justification  for  use  of  region  as  a 
stratification factor instead of study centre has been provided by the applicant. In addition, it is unclear 
if other methods of stratification were considered such as division into centres recruiting children only, 
adults only or both age groups of patients by region. 
Approximately  30%  of  patients  discontinued  study  DPM-CF-301  before  the  end  of  the  randomised 
treatment  period  of  26  weeks,  while  the  statistical  methods  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary 
endpoint  are  not  considered  adequate  to  account  for  the  large  amount  of  missing  data.  Overall  the 
handling  of  missing  data  was  limited  and  a  number  of  additional  analyses  and  investigations  are 
necessary to confirm that the results reported from the MMRM analysis are robust and reliable over the 
totality  of  this  heterogeneous  population.  It  is  not accepted  that  the  pre-specified  MMRM  model  itself 
provided robust estimates of treatment differences in both studies (as claimed by the applicant) as it 
likely  would  overestimate  the  effect  in  Study  DPM-CF-301  where  a  large  percentage  of  patients 
discontinued early resulting in high levels of missing data.  
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 61/126
 
 
The  sensitivity  analysis  used  10  different  methods  to  handle  missing  data.  It  should  be  noted  that 
analysis  Method  10  is  not  appropriate.  Although  for  study  DPM-CF-302  results  this  was  used  by  the 
applicant  to  reanalyse  the  primary  endpoint  which  had  failed  to  achieve  statistical  significance  in  the 
pre-specified  analysis,  the  reason  for  including  the  average  of  screening  and  baseline  FEV1  as  a 
covariate  is  not  accepted.  The  use  of  the  baseline  value  as  a  covariate  is  considered  the  appropriate 
method of adjustment only for an endpoint based on change from baseline. 
The indication sought by the applicant includes two distinct groups of patients and it is unclear how the 
findings  reported  apply  to  both.  Furthermore,  the  investigation  of  the  effect  in  different  important 
subgroups  has  not  been  sufficiently  carried  out.  Although  the  subgroups  by  rhDNase  use  have  been 
analysed  and  suggest  a  difference  in  effect  between  the  two,  consistency  of  effect  across  subgroups 
according to age has not been established (see below).  
The  study  design  does  not  allow  to  establish  whether  rhDNase  non  users  at  baseline  were  indeed 
patients who did not derive benefit from rhDNase i.e. inadequately responsive to rhDNase as claimed 
in  the  indication  of  the  proposed  SPC.  Study  DPM-CF-203  is  the  only  study  with  a  direct  comparison 
between rhDNase and Mannitol 400 mg bd in a cross over design. The results presented, however, do 
not  allow  to  establish  whether  mannitol  can  be  an  alternative  in  those  patients  who  will  not  obtain 
benefit  with  rhDNase  since  it  is  not  known  if  included  patients  actually  did  not  obtain  benefit  from 
rhDNase treatment. Furthermore, results indicate that combination of mannitol and rhDNase does not 
convey additional benefit. It therefore cannot be determined from this study whether or not mannitol 
will provide better benefit (or even worsening) in patients not fully responding to rhDNase. 
It should be noted that the most appropriate presentation of the results for the overall population aged 
6 years and over is considered to be in terms of FEV1 as percent predicted normal not the unadjusted 
FEV 1 value that was applied according to study protocols. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  study  DPM-CF-201,  the  effect  of  inhaled  mannitol  420  mg  appeared  rather  weak,  although  an 
effect is shown as compared to the control group. This study is presented by the applicant as a proof of 
concept  study  and  no  direct  conclusion  can  be  drawn  as  it  was  performed  with  different  doses  of 
mannitol (420 mg x 2 daily), different capsules of mannitol (filling with 30 mg powder), and different 
dry powder inhaler than those proposed for use in the present application for inhaled mannitol. About 
half  of  the  studied  population  was  treated  with  rhDNase  at  baseline  (18  patients  out  of  39),  but  no 
interpretation  can  be  provided  on  the  results  obtained  in  patients  with  concomitant  use  of  RhDNase 
and those not using concomitant rhDNase as the study was not designed for this consideration. 
The pivotal study DPM-CF-301 showed a statistically significant increase of 92 ml in FEV1 by 26 weeks 
compared to the control group. This translates in an improvement of 2 to 3 % of FEV1 as expressed as 
FEV 1  %  predicted.  The  clinical  relevance  was  questioned  because  of  the  large  drop  out  rate,  the 
statistical  methods  used  to  assess  this  change,  and  the  large  effect  noted  in  the  subgroup  where 
mannitol  was  used  in  conjunction  with  rhDNase  (change  of  108 ml)  compared  with  those  using 
mannitol alone (69 ml). 
The analysis of the primary endpoint in study DPM-CF-302, change from baseline in absolute FEV1, in 
the  overall  population  failed  to  achieve  statistical  significance  (p=0.059)  using  the  pre-specified 
statistical  analysis  method.  Similarly  the  analysis  of  change  from  baseline  of  FEV 1  as  percentage  of 
predicted normal did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p=0.052).  It is of note that 
the European guideline on multiplicity issues in clinical trials (CPMP/EWP/908/99) concludes that claims 
on statistically significant and clinically relevant findings based on subgroups are possible only after the 
primary objective has been achieved and if pre-specified. This is not the case in this study.

The  applicant  has  argued  that  an  unexpectedly  large  change  between  screening  and  baseline  in  the 
control group had contributed to a reduced treatment effect in the primary endpoint of study DPM-CF-
302.  Although  this  may  be  true,  it  is  not  acceptable  to  conduct  a  second  analysis  using  a  post-hoc 
baseline  correction  using  the  average  of  the  screening  and  baseline  values  in  order  to  obtain  a 
significant  result.  As  described  in  current  European  guidance  on  adjustment  for  baseline  covariates 
(CPMP/EWP/2863/99) the analysis of change from baseline without adjusting in the model for baseline 
as a covariate is not appropriate. There is no scientific rationale to support the adjustment used in the 
post-hoc analysis which is not accepted. 
It  is  unclear  if  the  problem  of  high  rates  of  missing  data  was  limited  to  a  particular  subgroup  of 
patients  such  as  children  or  if  it  was  distributed  evenly  across  all  subgroups  of  the  population.  This 
raises concerns over the quality of the data provided, especially by study DPM-CF-301.  
Sensitivity  analysis  clearly  indicates  the  lack  of  consistency  of  the  estimated  treatment  difference  in 
study DPM-CF-301. The discontinuation rate for study DPM-CF-302 is considerably lower than for study 
DPM-CF-301,  although  certainly  not  negligible,  being  slightly  less  than  15%.  However  the  sensitivity 
analysis  for  study  DPM-CF-302  presents  more  consistent  estimates  of  treatment  difference  using  the 
same  analysis  methods  as  applied  for  study  DPM-CF-301,  although  somewhat  lower  around  2%  in 
terms of change from baseline in percentage predicted normal FEV1. 
Thus  it  may  be  argued  that  the  important  issue  is  not  which  analysis  method  provides  the  most 
appropriate estimate but whether the different methods of handling the missing data have a profound 
effect  on  the  estimate  or  whether  it  remains  fairly  consistent  indicating  that  the  results  are  robust.  
Therefore it is considered that due to the high discontinuation rate from study DPM-CF-301 the results 
are  less  reliable  than  those  from  study  DPM-CF-302  where  the  applicant  admits  that  higher  levels  of 
training were provided to the study centres based on the experience gained from the earlier study. As 
the quality of the two studies is considered to be different the pooled data does not necessarily provide 
better estimates of the treatment difference. 
The relevance of the improvement in FEV 1 seen in the rhDNase and mannitol users’ strata is not clear. 
As  the  actual  use  in  the  rhDNase  strata  during  the  study  period  is  not  clarified  by  the  applicant,  no 
reliable conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of mannitol alone or as add on therapy to rhDNase 
can  be  drawn  from  the  results  presented  by  the  applicant.  If  it  is  assumed  that  included  patients 
maintained rhDNase use unchanged during the study, several issues arise. 
Firstly, the sub therapeutic dose of the control group, inhaled mannitol 50 mg bid, is questionable. In 
the control group of rhDNase non users strata (assumed to correspond to mannitol 50 mg BD as the 
sole  mucoactive  drug  being  administered)  least  squares  means  estimates  for  FEV1  absolute  change 
from  baseline  at  week  26  was  88.7  ml  (95%  CI  32.12,  145.27)  in  study  DPM-CF-301  and  78.44  ml 
(95%  CI  -41.50,  198.38)  in  study  DPM-CF-302.  However,  patients  were  pre-treated  with  a  beta 
agonist, which might increase FEV 1 by 10-15%. In this subgroup, the change from baseline in absolute 
FEV 1 reached the threshold that was defined as clinically significant in the statistical analysis plan (>70 
ml  was  the  threshold  of  statistical  hypothesis).  Therefore  the  effect  of  50  mg  might  not  be  sub-
therapeutic, as a significant effect was observed. The adequacy of the control is questionable especially 
with  regards  to  the  between  groups  comparison  of  the  incidences  of  adverse  events,  where  the 
sensitivity would be limited and no reliable conclusion can be drawn on safety assessment. The dose of 
50  mg  is  in  the  middle  of  the  range  used  as  a  bronchoprovocation  test  and  may  induce 
bronchoconstriction during exacerbations even if initial falls in FEV1 at screening were below 20%. 
When considering the effect on change in absolute FEV 1 from baseline, the change from baseline with 
mannitol  400  mg  bd  appeared  lower  in  the  rhDNase  users  than  in  the  rhDNase  non  user  strata.  This 
suggests that the addition of mannitol to rhDNase could possibly produce a smaller effect as compared 
to mannitol alone. This cannot be excluded, as it was evoked in the small phase II DPM-CF-203 study.

The  only  conclusion  that  would  be  allowed  is  that  the  combination  of  both  treatments  needs  further 
evidence. 
Moreover,  there  is  a  concern  over  the  unexpected  heterogeneity  across  the  age  groups,  especially  in 
study  DPM-CF-302  where  the  applicant  has  been  unable  to  explain  the  total  lack  of  effect  in  the 
adolescent subgroup compared with the subgroups of children and adults.  
The table below presents the number of patients in each subgroup by age and rhDNase use.

Results for the overall population as well as the subgroups by age for the change from baseline in FEV1 
as  percentage  of  predicted  normal  are  summarised  below.  Although  the  table  above  indicates  the 
numbers  of  patients  in  each  subgroup,  the  numbers  included  in  the  analysis  presented  in  the  table 
below  have  not  been  provided  by  the  applicant.  As  the  trial  has  not  been  powered  for  individual 
subgroups by age, the p-values for the subgroups are not important. However, the lack of consistency 
of effect across age groups with different patterns in the two studies is clearly shown.

It is important to note that although the percentage of children and adolescents in study DPM-CF-301 
is relatively small with two thirds of the patients 18 years or over, in study DPM-CF-302 over 30% of 
the patients are in the adolescent subgroup with almost a further 20% under 12 years.  Therefore, the 
subgroups  by  age  are  fairly  well  represented  although  the  study  is  not  powered  for  statistical 
significance in the subgroups. 
A possible explanation could be lack of compliance in the adolescent population. Although information 
has  been  provided  for  the  overall  population  which  would  suggest  that  average  compliance  was 
reasonably  high  at  94%,  unfortunately  this  information  has  not  been  provided  by  age  subgroup,  but 
the data on compliance provided do not indicate there was an issue with it. Furthermore, estimation of 
compliance is  possibly  unreliable  since  it  was  based  only  on  counting  returned  unused  mediation  and 
empty blister packaging. Moreover, lack of compliance cannot justify the differences in results seen in 
children  under  12  in  the  two  studies.  A  reasonable  explanation  for  these  heterogenic  results  seen  in 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

patients under 18 can not be found; this renders the results of both phase III studies – including the 
results in the adults only group – unreliable, as there is not sufficient confidence that the consistency 
seen in adults was not by chance. 
Overall,  the  FEF  25-75  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  lesser  in  the  mannitol  400  mg  group  as 
compared to the control group for both adolescent and paediatric groups. This observation is worthy to 
be considered since FEF25-75 is generally more accurate to assess the small airways. The evidence of 
improvement  of  clearance  of  mucus  in  distal  and  small  airways  is  lacking.  In  the  presented  data  in 
children the 50 mg dose has a significant effect on FEV1 and overall the FEF25-75 results were lowered 
with the full dose of 400 mg mannitol as compared to mannitol 50 mg. It could also suggest that the 
mannitol  400 mg  might  be  rather  deleterious  as  compared  to  lower  dose  of  50  mg  in  children  with 
small airways, maybe due to a elevated dose that would exert a “too great increased in viscosity” with 
inefficient  mucociliary  clearance.  Clearly  the  appropriate  dose  in  paediatrics  need  to  be  further 
investigated to be determined. 
The pivotal studies (DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302) do not provide adequate evidence of efficacy. The 
change  in  FEV 1  %  predicted  is  very  small  (around  2-3%)  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect 
observed  on  FEV 1  has  not  been  established.    The  magnitude  of  the  effect  size  is  very  small  and  not 
clinically significant. In clinical practice such small differences in FEV1 are not detected and cumulative 
benefit was not demonstrated. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  both  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  the  effect  size  for  FEV 1  is  very  small  and  cannot  be  recognised  as 
clinically significant.    
The lack of consistency across the trials in the individual age groups questions the value of the pooled 
analysis.  Moreover  there  is  serious  concern  over  the  lack  of  consistency  both  within  the  trials  across 
age groups and between the two studies. 
There  is  a  serious  concern  over  the  differences  in  effect  across  the  age  groups  which  have  not  been 
explained and therefore raise concerns about the confidence in results of pivotal studies in general.  
Studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 do not establish the benefit of inhaled mannitol 400 mg BD as 
add on therapy to rhDNase, nor as alternative to rhDNase, in the claimed population of cystic fibrosis 
patients. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  use  of  400 mg  inhaled  mannitol  has  been  studied  in  Cystic  Fibrosis  patients  in  studies,  DPM-CF-
201, DPM-CF-202, DPM-CF-203, DPM-CF-301 and DPM-302 with a total of 511 patients exposed.  The 
applicant has also been studying this dose in patients with bronchiectasis in studies DPM-B-201, DPM-
B-202  and  at  dose  of  320 mg  bd  in  study  DPM-B-301,  with  a  total  of  289  patients  exposed.  This 
indicates  that  the  overall  safety  sample  represents  800  patients.  In  the  bronchiectasis  study  DPM-B-
301 a further 99 patients were exposed to inhaled mannitol for 1 year. 
The  applicant  has  reported  that  as  of February  2011  256  patients  have  received  inhaled  mannitol  for 
treatment of Cystic fibrosis outside clinical studies.  
Adverse events

Inhaled  mannitol  at  a  dose  of  400 mg  bd  has  been  associated  with  adverse  events  which  affect  the 
respiratory  tract  (area  it  is  delivered  in)  as  well  as  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  The  most  common 
respiratory tract adverse event is cough, haemoptysis, pharyngolaryngeal pain. When mannitol is used 
in association with rhDNase there is a higher frequency of reports of cough, wheezing and haemoptysis 
(for  the  cough  the  difference  is  twice).  Gastrointestinal  tract  associated  adverse  events  are  clearly 
linked to some of the inhaled mannitol being swallowed by the patient, abdominal pain being the most 
common event.

Table 20.  Treatment Emergent AEs ≥  5% by SOC and PT Through the 26-Week Double-blind Phase, by 
rhDNase Use (Studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302; Safety Population) 
Of note spontaneous adverse event reports have been received for 21 patients (out of estimated 256 
exposed) in named-patient and special access schemes. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Three  deaths  have  been  reported  (two  in  study  DPM-B-301  due  to  pneumonia  and  acute  myocardial 
infarction;  one  in  study  DPM-CF-302  after  its  completion  due  to  pneumothorax),  but  were  thought 
probably  (pneumonia)  or  definitely  (myocardial  infarction  and  pneumothorax)  not  to  be  related  to 
treatment. 
In  pivotal  studies,  during  the  26-week  randomised  treatment  phase,  77  (21.3%)  and  65  (27.2%) 
patients in the inhaled mannitol and control groups, respectively, experienced SAEs. The most common 
by  SOC  were  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  with  60  (16.6%)  and  45  (18.8%) 
patients in the inhaled mannitol and control groups, respectively, experiencing SAEs in this SOC, all of 
which were condition aggravated, which was the PT chosen to indicate an exacerbation of pulmonary

More  SAEs  were  experienced  by  rhDNase  users  than  non-users  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  most 
common PT was condition aggravated, which occurred in 49 (21.0%) and 30 (18.9%) rhDNase users 
in the inhaled mannitol and control groups, respectively, and 11 (8.6%) and 15 (18.8%) rhDNase non-
users in the respective treatment groups.

reported  in  7  (1.9%)  patients  and  one  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  inhaled  mannitol  and  control  groups, 
respectively, of which all except one bronchospasm report were haemoptysis. 
Table 23.  Treatment-related SAEs by SOC and PT through the 26-week double-blind phase (DPM-CF-

Four  fatal  cases  have  been  reported  in  named-patient  and  special  access  schemes,  one  involving 
respiratory failure. It is, however, difficult to determine inhaled mannitol's role in this fatality because 
there is no indication of the seriousness of the respiratory decline in the patient concerned. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no important abnormalities in laboratory tests in the data sets submitted. 
Immunological events 
There have been no immunological events reported. 
Safety in special populations 
66 paediatric patients and 88 adolescent patients received inhaled mannitol in Phase 3 CF trials. For all 
age  groups,  the  three  most  commonly  reported  treatment  related  AEs  were  condition  aggravated, 
headache and cough.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There was no indication of safety concerns due to drug-drug interactions. It should, however, be noted 
that  an  increased  reporting  rate  of  some  adverse  events  (such  as  wheezing)  was  observed  when 
rhDNase and mannitol were used together. This observation requires further investigation. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
42 patients (11.6%) in the inhaled mannitol group and 15 (6.3%) in the control group withdrew from 
Phase 3 CF studies due to treatment-related adverse events.

The frequency of withdrawal from the study due to adverse events was low and the causes are in line 
with what could be expected from use of the product. There, however, is a concern since the studies 
(especially DPM-CF-301) had high drop out rate. 
Post marketing experience 
Bronchitol  has  not  been  marketed.  The  applicant,  however,  has  provided  some  post  marketing 
surveillance  data  for  product  inhaled  mannitol  used  for  bronchoprovocation  testing,  which  includes  8 
spontaneous  adverse  reaction  reports  and  raise  no  concerns.  The  exposure  to  inhaled  mannitol  for 
bronchoprovocation testing as of April 2010 is estimated to be 59,812 patients.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No  treatment  related  fatal  or  life  threatening  adverse  events  were  reported  in  clinical  trials. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were the most frequent disorders. 
The applicant was requested by the CHMP to discuss in detail the adverse events of interest from the 
two  phase  3  studies  –  namely  haemoptysis  and  bronchospasm.  The  latter  is  important  also  because 
mannitol is also used to provoke bronchoconstriction. 
Haemoptysis was reported in considerably more patients in the inhaled mannitol arm compared to the 
control  arm.  In  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  combined,  any  haemoptysis  was  reported  in 
9.4% in the inhaled mannitol arm compared to 5.4% in the control arm. Of these severe were 1.1% in 
the  inhaled  mannitol  arm  compared  to  0.4%  in  the  control  arm.  The  applicant  then  examined  the 
frequency  of  haemoptysis  either  as  a  stand  alone  AE  or  as  a  reported  symptom  of  a  pulmonary 
exacerbation  (PE).  The  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  (15.8% 
versus  14.6%  for  the  Inhaled  mannitol  and  control  arms,  respectively).  However,  as  the  applicant  is 
claiming  that  inhaled  mannitol  reduces  the  rate  of  PE  this  should  have  lead  to  less  reporting  of 
haemoptysis  due  to  PE  following  the  reduction  of  the  rate  of  PE.  Therefore,  there  is  a  possible  link 
between inhaled mannitol and haemoptysis and further close monitoring of haemoptysis is necessary. 
The applicant has analysed the reports of bronchoconstriction and associated events such as wheezing, 
dyspnoea and chest discomfort from the safety population of studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302.  In 
the  overall  population  events  of  this  type  were  reported  in  6.1%  in  the  inhaled  mannitol  group 
compared  to  5%  in  the  control  group.  There  appears  to  be  a  similar  number  of  reports  related  to 
bronchoconstriction.  Patients  are  advised  to  receive  a  dose  of  bronchodilator  5  to  15  minutes  before 
each  dose  of  inhaled  mannitol.  The  CHMP  had  a  concern  whether  with  long  term  use  patients  may 
become  sensitised  and  not  respond  to  bronchodilators,  therefore  additional  discussion  was  requested 
from the applicant. The applicant had included bronchodilator response tests both at weeks 0 and 26 to 
demonstrate whether airways are sensitised by chronic use of inhaled mannitol. There was no change 
in both arms in the majority of patients (<92%), but the data was dichotomised (change from <12% 
to ≥12% reversibility) and therefore  did not show the actual magnitude of the changes,  which would 
have been more informative. Therefore no definitive conclusion can be made on this issue.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  data  so  far  does  not  indicate  a  big  difference  in  events  associated  with  bronchoconstriction 
between the two groups. However, since inhaled mannitol is being used to provoke bronchoconstriction 
risk of bronchoconstriction requires close further monitoring. 
There  appears  to  be  a  possible  link  between  haemoptysis  and  use  of  mannitol,  which  requires  close 
further monitoring. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.  
Risk management plan 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 76/126
 
 
The applicant submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan. 
The RMP version 1.3 proposed additional pharmacovigilance activities and additional risk minimisation 
activities.  During  the  evaluation  the  CHMP  has  questioned  the  methodology  proposed  to  be  used  to 
verify  the  success  of  the  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  and  some  aspects  of  the  design 
proposed for the CF registry study. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application was of the opinion that it was not 
appropriate to conclude on pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation activities at the time of adoption 
of CHMP opinion and in view of benefit-risk balance conclusions and CHMP recommendations in section 
3 below. 
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Inhalation  treatment  with  mannitol  is  intended  to  improve  mucociliary  clearance  by  creating  an 
osmotic gradient that leads to changes in surface properties in the airways. In the armamentarium of 
medicinal products for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, inhaled mannitol would therefore be placed as a 
mucolytic  agent.  In  general,  a  clinically  relevant improvement  of  lung  function  through measurement 
of FEV 1 is considered adequate for the demonstration of efficacy for such products. 
Two  phase  3  studies  of  similar  design  have  been  performed  (DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302), 
investigating the dose of inhaled mannitol 400 mg twice daily compared to a “subtherapeutic” dose of 
50 mg twice daily. The studies allowed the use of rhDNase. Study DPM-CF-301 showed a statistically 
significant overall treatment effect of 54.17 ml in FEV1 over 26 weeks compared to the control group 
(p<0.001).  The  pre-specified  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  in  study  DPM-CF-302  showed  overall 
treatment  effect  over  26  weeks  in  change  in  absolute  FEV 1  of  54.14  ml  as  compared  to  the  control 
group,  which  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.059);  additional  post-hoc  analyses  were  presented 
by the applicant.  
Overall  treatment  with  mannitol  showed  an  improvement  of  approximately  2-3%  compared  with  the 
control  group  over  26  weeks  in  terms  of  percent  predicted  FEV 1.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  minor 
improvement  has  not  been  established.  Compared  to  the  effect  size  of  other  treatments,  such  as 
bronchodilators  or  inhaled  tobramycin,  the  size  of  the  effect  of  inhaled  mannitol  on  lung  function  is 
considered  small  and  with  questionable  clinical  importance.  Moreover,  there  was  no  significant 
difference  on  the  secondary  parameters  as  exacerbation  rate,  use  of  systemic  antibiotics, 
hospitalisations and quality of life as compared to the comparator group. 
Stratification by rhDNase at screening showed in study DPM-CF-301 a statistically significant difference 
in FEV1 at week 26 in the so called rhDNase users stratum (108 ml) but not in the so called rhDNase 
non-users  stratum  (69 ml).  In  study  DPM-CF-302  the  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  in 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 77/126
 
 
either stratum. There appears however in both studies to be a trend that the mean change in absolute 
FEV 1 was higher in the stratum of rhDNase non-users as compared to the stratum of rhDNase users. 
Patients above the age of 6 years were included in these two studies. Based on the available data, and 
in the absence of stratification, there appear to be three subgroups in terms of treatment effect, 6-11 
years, 12-17 years and adults. However, given the limitation of the data in the paediatric population, 
the applicant revised the claimed indication during the procedure to use only in adults. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The major uncertainty is the fact that the reliability of the results from the two pivotal studies (DPM-
CF-301 and DPM-CF-302) is questionable. 
  Study DPM-CF-301 has failed to provide robust evidence of efficacy due to the high drop-out rate 
of  approximately  30%.  The  pre-defined  statistical  methods  are  not  deemed  suitable  for  dealing 
with  high  drop-out  rates  seen  in  this  study.  Sensitivity  analyses  clearly  indicate  the  lack  of 
consistency of the estimated treatment difference in this study. 
  Study  DPM-CF-302  failed  to  reach  statistical  significance  for  its  primary  endpoint,  which  prevents 
from  drawing  conclusions  about  the  results  in  study  population  subgroups.  The  post-hoc  analysis 
proposed  by  the  applicant  was  not  considered  acceptable.  Furthermore,  this  study  also 
demonstrated  lack  of  consistency  across  age  groups  despite  different  groups  being  fairly  well 
represented, which is a cause for concern since it questions the reliability of the estimates for both 
the overall population and the adult subgroup. The effect in children was found to be higher than in 
either adults or adolescents, with no effect in the adolescent subgroup. 
Overall, there is a lack of consistency between the two studies in the estimated treatment effect in the 
overall population and, in particular, in children and adolescents (though the estimates for adults were 
similar  between  the  two  studies)".  As  the  quality  of  the  two  pivotal  studies  is  considered  to  be 
different, the pooled data is not expected to provide better estimates of treatment difference. 
With regard to the comparator, the effect of 50 mg of inhaled mannitol might not be sub-therapeutic, 
as  a  significant  effect  was  observed  in  rhDNase  non  users  in  study  DPM-CF-302,  which  raises  doubts 
about the adequacy of the chosen control medication dose. 
The  applicant  claims  an  indication  as  add-on  treatment  to  DNAse  as  well  as  the  use  in  patients 
ineligible,  intolerant,  or  inadequately  responsive  to  rhDNase.  However,  the  design  of  phase  3  studies 
has not defined the subgroup of rhDNase users the same way as in the proposed indication. During the 
studies  it  was  not  established  upon  inclusion  of  non-users  of  rhDNase  if  they  would  or  would  not 
benefit  from  it,  were  they  taking  rhDNase.  The  actual  use  of  rhDNase  by  subjects  during  the  pivotal 
trials is unknown; therefore no reliable conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety of mannitol alone 
or  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  rhDNase  can  be  drawn from  the  results  presented.  In  addition,  the  large 
effect  in  the  subgroup  of  rhDNase  non-users,  as  compared  to  the  users,  has  not  been  sufficiently 
explained. This raises also concerns of a possible decrease in efficacy of inhaled mannitol when used in 
combination with rhDNase. 
Given  the  uncertainties  around  the  available  efficacy  data,  the  appropriateness  of  the  actual  dose  of 
inhaled  mannitol  studied  in  the  pivotal  studies  remains  questionable.  The  potential  effects  of  higher 
doses of inhaled mannitol have not been investigated.

3.2.  Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most important adverse effects were respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. 
Mannitol  is  already  used  in  the  EU  as  an  inhaled  product  to  test  for  bronchial  hyper-responsiveness. 
Although  a  bronchocontrictor  response  to  mannitol  was  used  as  an  exclusion  criterion  in  the  main 
trials,  the  use  of  such  an  exclusion  test  may  not  be  so  rigorous  outside  a  clinical  trial.  In  addition, 
given that airway hyper-responsiveness is common in cystic fibrosis, a patient who is negative to such 
a challenge may become positive during an exacerbation, in which case treatment with mannitol would 
increase the potential severity of the exacerbation. 
The  major  adverse  event-related  concern  was  an  increase  in  bronchoconstriction  when  mannitol  was 
used in patients receiving inhaled rhDNase. There was also a small increase in haemoptysis which was 
consistently seen in both pivotal studies.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The increase in wheezing/bronchoconstriction among patients receiving mannitol within rhDNase users’ 
strata  highlights  the  potential  increased  risk  related  to  the  use  of  these  two  therapies  together.  It  is 
therefore uncertain whether the product should be used with or without rhDNase. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
There  is  a  small  potential  benefit  in  FEV1,  without  supporting  clinical  endpoint  evidence,  in  two  trials 
that  have  design  limitations.  The  clinical  relevance  of  this  small  potential  benefit  has  not  been 
established.  The  heterogeneity  of  the  results  seen  across  age  groups  in  both  studies  raises  serious 
concerns  about  the  overall  validity  of  the  results,  recognising  that  the  claimed  indication  is  in  adults 
only.  In  addition,  the  benefits  of  the  use  together  with  rhDNase  are  uncertain  given  the  observed 
inconsistencies. 
There  is  an  identified  risk  for  potentially  serious  adverse  events  such  as  bronchoconstriction  and 
haemoptysis, which with the uncertainties on the magnitude of effect renders the risk benefit balance 
negative. 
The evidence of favourable risk benefit is lacking. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Given  the  uncertainties  with  efficacy  in  the  claimed  patient  population  and  the  identified  risks  of 
bronchoconstriction  and  haemoptysis  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  inhaled  mannitol  in  the  proposed 
indication is considered negative.

3.3.  Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis  requires  a  multidisciplinary  approach.  With  regard  to  the  pulmonary 
management,  the  mainstay  being  inhaled  and  systemic  antibiotics  to  prevent  or  treat  pulmonary 
infections,  and  therapy  with  mucoactive  drugs  to  improve  airway  mucosal  clearance  of  lower-airway 
secretions and treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  
Inhaled  mannitol  was  developed  as  mucus  rehydrating  drug  for  the  treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis. 
However,  the  two  pivotal  studies  failed  to  demonstrate  robust  evidence  of  efficacy.  In  particular,  the 
large drop out in study DPM-CF-301 limits the confidence in the effect size seen, which in any case was 
of  questionable  clinical  relevance.  Study  DPM-CF-302  was  essentially  a  failed  study  as  statistical 
significance in the primary endpoint was not achieved using the pre-specified analysis. Furthermore, in 
this study the results were inconsistent across the age groups with little or no effect in adolescents and 
not  consistent  with  the  findings  in  study  DPM-CF-301.  Therefore  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  on 
the robustness of the results seen in the two pivotal studies. 
The  applicant  initially  claimed  the  use  of  the  product  also  in  the  paediatric  population,  but  has 
subsequently  restricted  the  use  in  adults  only  given  the  concerns  expressed  by  the  CHMP  about  the 
available data below the age of 18 years. With regard to the use with or without rhDNase as claimed 
by  the  applicant,  i.e.  add-on  therapy  to  rhDNase,  and  in  adults  ineligible,  intolerant,  or  inadequately 
responsive to rhDNase, the available evidence is considered insufficient and inconsistent.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  limited  efficacy  is  considered  not  to  outweigh  the  observed 
and potential safety concerns, relating primarily to bronchoconstriction events and haemoptysis, such 
that a favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded. 
Some  CHMP  members  expressed  a  divergent  view  stating  that  available  clinical  data  from  the  two 
pivotal  studies  show  an  effect  on  FEV 1  which  is  small  but  nevertheless  considered  to  be  of  clinical 
relevance. This particularly because the product is complementary to existing expectorant treatments 
due  to  its  mechanism  of  action hence  providing  an  alternative  treatment  in  a  complex  and 
individualised  treatment  strategy.  The  remaining  uncertainties  with  respect  to  the  magnitude  of  the 
effect  are  accepted  in  this  context.  The  principal  adverse  events  associated  with  its  use,  cough  and 
minor  haemoptysis  may  be  considered  as  tolerability  rather  than  safety  problems  and  are  not  a 
sufficient ground to refuse an authorisation.

4.   Recommendations 
4.1.  Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  for  Bronchitol  in  the  treatment  of 
cystic  fibrosis,  the  CHMP  considered  by  majority  decision  that  the  efficacy  of  the  above  mentioned 
medicinal  product  was  not  sufficiently  demonstrated,  and,  therefore  recommended  the  refusal  of  the 
granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  above  mentioned  medicinal  product.  The  CHMP 
considered that: 
The pivotal studies (DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302) are considered not to provide adequate evidence of 
efficacy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy 
to rhDNase, and in adults ineligible, intolerant, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase. In particular: 
 
The clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed on FEV1 has not been established.  
  Uncertainties  remain  in  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  following  treatment  with  Bronchitol.  In  study 
DPM-CF-301  a  high  proportion  of  patient  withdrawals  complicates  inference.  The  pattern  of 
estimated  treatment  effects  is  inconsistent  within  each  study  across  important  subgroups  defined 
by  age  (children,  adolescents  and  adults)  and  the  pattern  of  effects in  each  age  group  is 
inconsistent  between  studies.   In 
light  of  the 
limited  effects  observed,  these 
internal 
inconsistencies  result  in  unacceptable  uncertainty  in  the  estimated  treatment  effect  for  the 
proposed population. 
The limited efficacy, of uncertain magnitude, is considered not to outweigh the observed and potential 
safety  concerns,  relating  primarily  to  bronchoconstriction  events  and  haemoptysis,  such  that a 
favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded. 
Due  to  the  aforementioned  concerns  a  satisfactory  summary  of  product  characteristics,  labelling, 
package leaflet, risk management plan and conditions to address other concerns as outlined in the list 
of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage. 
4.2.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 23 June 2011 
Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  Bronchitol  was  not  approvable  for  the  following  indication: 
“Treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to rhDNase, 
and  in  adults  ineligible,  intolerant,  or  inadequately  responsive  to  rhDNase”,  the  applicant  submitted 
detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal on 19 August 2011.  
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an ad-
hoc  expert  meeting  on  3  October  2011  inviting  the  experts,  including  patients  representatives,  to 
provide  their  views  on  the  questions  posed  by  the  CHMP  in  relation  to  the  marketing  authorisation 
application, taking into account the applicant’s response to the grounds for refusal. 
The applicant presented their detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation 
to the CHMP on 17th October 2011.

Ground 1:  The clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed on FEV1 has not been established. 
Applicant´s position: (summarised) 
The  applicant  provided  the  following  evidence  to  support  the  clinical  relevance  of  Bronchitol’s 
treatment effects: 
 
The clinical relevance of the FEV1 benefit noted in both pivotal studies in the overall population and 
across age subgroups is supported by expert opinion. 
  A sustained FEV1 benefit observed with Bronchitol is highly meaningful in the context of declining 
lung function in CF 
  Bronchitol’s size of effect in FEV1 is comparable to existing CF therapies 
  Secondary  endpoints  all  support  the  primary  FEV1  including  significant  improvements  in  FVC, 
increased mucus clearance and reductions in exacerbations. 
Although  the  last  proposed  indication  at  the  time  of  the  re-examination  was  for  adults  only,  as  the 
CHMP had concerns regarding restriction of the indication, overall population data was presented in the 
following sections alongside both age and rhDNase subgroup data. 
Estimated Treatment Effect size 
In  the  grounds  for  refusal  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  obtained  using  Bronchitol  has  been 
questioned, rather than an absence of treatment effect. The uncertainty of exact treatment effect size 
then led to difficulty in determining clinical relevance 
Data  presented  in  the  following  sections  was  generated  using  the  mixed  model  analysis  of  repeated 
measures  as  the  estimate  of  Bronchitol’s  efficacy  from  this  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  defined 
primary model. It is representative of a number of sensitivity analyses performed to take into account 
missing  data  due  to  withdrawals.  It  is  also  supported  using  analyses  based  on  last  and  baseline 
observation carried forward (LOCF & BOCF), as requested by CHMP.

The  treatment  effects  estimated  by  MMRM  model  from  both  studies  are  consistent  with  those 
estimated based on cross-sectional analysis (ANCOVA) of Week 26 data, which are imputed by LOCF or 
BOCF  as  requested  by  CHMP.  All  age  and  rhDNase  subgroups  from  both  studies  provide  estimates  of 
treatment effect which consistently favour Bronchitol. The overlap of the 95% CIs among all subgroups 
is  substantial,  which  indicates  that  there  is  no  statistical  evidence  to  support  the  concept  that  the 
treatment effects are not consistent across the subgroups.  
The results consistently demonstrate Bronchitol’s benefit on top of current standard of care (including 
rhDNase)  in  this  orphan  designated  indication.  The  adult  population  similarly  showed  benefit  in  both 
the  rhDNase  user  and  rhDNase  unsuitable  subgroups.  The  observed  relatively  larger  variation  among 
children and adolescents subgroups is what would be expected with the small sample sizes included in 
these subgroups and expected sampling variation.  
Both studies were designed to assess the treatment effect for the overall population and in light of the 
evidence above, Pharmaxis believe that the overall treatment effect of around 3.6% relative change in 
% predicted for both studies is representative of the best estimate of treatment effect for all subgroups 
in these studies.  
Sustained FEV 1 benefit observed with Bronchitol 
Another  important  component  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  Bronchitol’s  efficacy  is  that  it  has  been 
demonstrated to be sustained out to 52 weeks in both pivotal studies. The FEV 1 change (in relative % 
predicted) in those patients who entered the open label phase of both pivotal studies was plotted over 
time to show a sustained improvement for the Bronchitol arm across 52 weeks (Figure 4). 
Although the change in FEV1 in the Bronchitol arm decreases from 26 to 52 weeks in both studies, the 
change in FEV 1 at week 52 is still well above 0 demonstrating the sustained improvement in FEV1 over 
time. This is despite the predicted decline over one year expected in a CF population.

Comparison of Bronchitol’s size of effect in FEV1 to existing CF therapies 
Further  evidence  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  Bronchitol’s  effect  is  provided  when  it  is  compared  with 
other  CF  therapies  currently  used  in  the  EU.  The  pooled  effect  of  Bronchitol  by  change  from  baseline 
from  both  studies  was  comparable  with  rhDNase,  and  larger  than  that  reported  for  hypertonic  saline 
(HS) (Table 2).  
Although  inhaled  antibiotics  are  less  appropriate  comparators,  due  to  their  antibacterial  mode  of 
action,  these  have  been  included  here  to  demonstrate  the  variability  in  the  FEV 1  benefit  noted  with 
tobramycin.  When  the  original  studies  were  performed  large  FEV1  benefits  (12%)  were  noted  as 
patients  were  naive  to  treatment  for  P.  Aeruginosa,  whereas  recent  studies,  which  are  more 
representative of how CF patients are currently treated, have shown more modest FEV1 improvements 
(2.6%).  More  recent  trials  of  inhaled  aztreonam  have  examined  only  the  first  month  of  drug,  when 
benefit may be most apparent. This is in contrast to Bronchitol which has shown continued benefit out 
to 52 weeks.

Secondary Endpoints Support FEV1 Improvement 
Improvement in other spirometry measures 
An  increase  in  FVC  reflects  increased  opening  of  airways  as  a  result  of  the  clearing  of  distal  airway 
mucus  blocking,  and  reduced  air  trapping  behind  this  mucus.  The  tidal  volume  is  also  increased  as  a 
result, so potentially improving exercise capacity. The secondary endpoint of FVC (relative change in % 
predicted)  from  both  pivotal  studies  and  pooled  data  supports  the  primary  endpoint  of  FEV1.  Both 
DPM-CF-301 and 302 showed statistically significant improvements of 3.03% (95% CI: 0.76, 5.29) and 
3.07%  (95%  CI:  0.48,  5.66)  relative  change  in  %  predicted  FVC  respectively  compared  to  control 
across 26 weeks of treatment in the overall ITT population. Pooled data of both studies also showed an 
improvement of 3.00% (95% CI: 1.27, 4.74) relative change in % predicted. The FVC improvements 
correlate  with  FEV1  changes,  indicating  that  an  improved  lung  capacity  is  driving  the  FEV 1 
improvement.  
Quantitative Microbiology 
In study DPM-CF-302 based on quantitative microbiological results, Bronchitol treatment was shown to 
both reduce the incidence of P. aeruginosa infection and reduce the bacterial burden in those that were 
infected. The incidence of P. aeruginosa infection was 52.9% at baseline and 58.2% after 26 weeks on 
treatment  in  control  patients,  with  the  average  bacterial  burden  in  infected  patients  increasing  from 
6.1 to 6.3 log units (CFU/g). In contrast the incidence of infection fell over 26 weeks of treatment in 
the Bronchitol group from 48.1% to 41.5%, with a reduction in ave
rage bacterial burden from 6.9 to 
6.
4 log units (CFU/g) (from 7,943,282 CFU/g to 2,511,886 CFU/g).  
Reduction in exacerbations 
Exacerbation  prevention  is  an  important  goal  of  CF  therapy.  Not  only  do  exacerbations  carry  an 
immediate morbidity and mortality risk, but they have also been shown to lead to permanent declines 
in lung function. Exacerbations are relatively uncommon events so although clinically very important, 
are  not  a  sensitive  tool.  Therefore  exacerbation  was  included  as  a  secondary  variable,  but  the 
individual studies were not powered to test this endpoint. The larger population provided by the pooled 
data  is  therefore  of  particular  importance.  It  was  consistently  observed  that,  compared  with  the 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 85/126
 
 
 
 
 
 
control,  Bronchitol  was  associated  with  a  reduction  in  pulmonary  exacerbations,  antibiotic  use  and 
hospitalisations. In the pooled studies, the incidence of exacerbations and associated rescue antibiotic 
use  was  reduced  by  29%  (relative  risk  0.71,  95%  CI:  0.51,  0.98,  p=0.039)  and  30%  (relative  risk 
0.70, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97, p=0.033), respectively in the Bronchitol group compared with control. This 
reduction in incidence is considered to be clinically meaningful, and similar to the reductions originally 
reported using rhDNase, at a time when other concomitant therapies were not available. The reduction 
in exacerbations was supported by trends in reduced hospitalisations (relative risk 0.78, 95% CI: 0.53, 
1
.16). These findings are generally consistent with the findings in the individual studies (Table 5). 
Ground 2: Uncertainties remain in the magnitude of the effect following treatment with Bronchitol
. In 
study DPM-CF-301 a high proportion of patient withdrawals complicates inference. The pattern of 
estimated treatment effects is inconsistent within each study across important subgroups defined b
y 
age (children, adolescents and adults) and the pattern of effects in each age group is inconsisten
t 
between studies. In light of the limited effects observed, these internal inconsistencies re
sult in 
unaccepta
ble uncertainty in the estimated treatment effect for the proposed population. 
Applicant´s position: (summarised) 
In order to address the concerns regarding magnitude of effect size which were raised during the MAA 
assessment,  the  Applicant  presented  FEV 1  as  relative  change  in  %  predicted.  This  is  stated  by  the 
CHMP as the preferred endpoint.  
Uncertainty Associated with Patient Withdrawal and Use of MMRM Model 
While acknowledging that there is a treatment effect with Bronchitol, the CHMP stated in the grounds 
for  refusal  that  “uncertainties  remain  in  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  following  treatment  with 
Bronchitol”. These uncertainties arose due to a relatively higher than expected patient withdrawal rate, 
and the use of MMRM model and possible different effects in different subgroups. 
Data from at least 90% of the patients contributed to the estimation of treatment effect. Although the 
overall  withdrawal  rate  was  higher  than  anticipated  in  study  DPM-CF-301,  there  is  a  significant 
proportion  of  the  subjects  (Bro
nchitol:  89.8%,  control:  95.8%)  who  contributed  at  least  one  post-
baseline observation (Table 6). 
This  is  similar  to  Study  DPM-CF-302,  where  96.2%  of  Bronchitol  subjects  and  99.2%  of  control 
subjects  provided  at  least  one  post-baseline  observation.  The  overall  withdrawal  rate  underestimates 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 86/126
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the amount of data included in the primary analysis, thus could over emphasize the potential impact of 
the withdrawals. 
As pointed out by CHMP and acknowledged by the applicant, the MMRM model could be associated with 
uncertainty  in  the  estimation  of  the  treatment  effect,  and  missing  data  could  further  complicate  the 
inference. In light of this, in order to assess the sensitivity of the primary analysis, missing data were 
imputed  by  various  methods  including  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  and  baseline 
observation carried forward as requested by CHMP. The data were subsequently analyzed by Analysis 
of  Covariance  (cross-sectional  analysis  at  Week  26)  or  MMRM  (longitudinal  analysis  across  the 
treatment  period),  to  compare  results  with  those  from  the  primary  analysis  which  were 3.51%  (95% 
CI:  0.96,  6.06)  and  3.59%  (95%  CI:  0.29,  6.90)  respectively  for  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  302. 
Comprehensive and systematic sensitivity analyses focused on the most relevant methods and results 
were reported to address
 possibly different missing mechanisms.  
In this section, the following
 approaches were used to handle the missing data for the relative change 
in % of predicted FEV1: 
CHMP requested methods: 
• LOCF: missing data at Week 26 were imputed by last observation carried forward. This is likely to be 
conservative  in  DPM-CF-301,  particularly  because  –  as  recognized  by  CHMP  –  patients  tended  to 
withdraw  earlier  from  the  Bronchitol  arm  than  the  control  arm.  Hence,  early  withdrawals  are  more 
likely  to  have  only  minimal  improvement  from  baseline.  The  imputed  Week  26  data  were  then 
analyzed by Analysis of Covariance. 
• BOCF: missing data at Week 26 wer
e imputed by baseline observation carried forward. This will also 
b
e  conservative  in  DPM-CF-301,  but  possibly  even  more  so  than  LOCF.  The  imputed  Week  26  data 
were then analyzed by AN
COVA. 
Other methods: 
• MI: missing data across the treatment period, namely Week 6 to Week 26, were imputed by multiple 
imputation  (MI)  for  50  times.  Each  imputed  longitudinal  dataset  was  then  analyzed  by  MMRM  model. 
Finally  the  MMRM  estimates  of  the  50  imputed  datasets  were  combined  for  inference  following  the 
approach as reported by Rubin. 
•  Pattern  Mixture  Model  (via  Multiple  Imputation):  missing  data  across  the  treatment  period,  namely 
Week  6  to  Week  26,  were  first  imputed  by  multiple  imputation  for  50  times.  Then  a  further  penalty 
was  given  to  patients  with  multiple  missing  data,  as  these  patients  could  less  likely  benefit  from  the 
Bronchitol

treatment.  That  is  20mL  was  removed  per  missing  visit  (20mL  at  1st 
missing  visit,  40mL  at  2nd 
m
issing  visit,  and  60mL  at  3rd  missing  visit).  The  impute
d  longitudinal  data  were  then  analyzed  by 
MMRM model as above. 
The analysed results are plotted as forest plot in Figure 10. 
It  has  been  acknowledged  by  both  CHMP  and  the  applicant  that  no  single  correct  way  to  impute  the 
missing data exists. Therefore the above sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty 
associated  with  the  estimates  from  the  primary  analysis  using  MMRM  model.  As  mentioned  above, 
LOCF and BOCF were requested by CHMP to be used to impute the missing data at Week 26, and then 
ANCOVA  was  used  to  analyse  the  imputed  data  at  Week  26  cross-sectionally.  Though  not  directly 
comparable between the longitudinal analysis (MMRM) and the cross-sectional analysis (ANCOVA), for 
both  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  302,  the  results  based  on  LOCF  (ANCOVA)  and  BOCF  (ANCOVA)  give 
similar estimates of effect size (of the order of 3% for study DPM-CF-301 and 4% for study DPM-CF-
302).  LOCF  and  BOCF  do,  however,  still  lead  to  the  same  conclusion  as  that  based  on  the  primary 
analysis  (MMRM).  Their  results  indicate  that,  at  Week  26,  there  was  a  positive  effect  favouring 
Bronchitol  for  the  comparison  between  Bronchitol  versus  control.  Much  of  the  uncertainty  associated 
with  the  estimates  from  MMRM  arises  from  possibly  inappropriate  assumptions  of  the  MMRM  model; 
the results based on LOCF (ANCOVA) and BOCF (ANCOVA) should alleviate those concerns. 
Multiple  imputation  and  pattern  mixture  model  (via  MI)  were  also  used  to  account  for  the  possible 
missing mechanisms in the data such as missing at random (MAR) or not missing at random (NMAR), 
which  unfortunately  cannot  be  directly  tested  or  verified.  As  the  imputed  data  were  subsequently 
analysed  by  MMRM,  the  results  are  provided  for  reference  purpose  only.  The  imputation  by  MI  and 
Pattern Mixture (via MI) introduced extra variation into the data to account for the uncertainty due to 
the  imputation  of  missing  data.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  their  95%  CIs  will  be  wider  than  oth
er 
estimates. However, this is less applicable to DPM-CF-302, as the quantity of missing data for DPM-CF-
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

302 is far less than that for DPM-CF-301. Even with the presence of all these uncertainties mentioned 
above, the results based on MI and Pattern Mixture (via MI) still favour Bronchitol. 
In summary, the applicant accepts the concern raised by CHMP with regards to the estimates based on 
the primary analysis using MMRM model. The withdrawals in both studies could further complicate the 
inference  based  on  MMRM  model.  The  applicant  followed  the  analysis  approaches  requested  by  the 
CHMP  –  i.e.  that  the  missing  data  at  Week  26  should  be  imputed  by  LOCF  or  BOCF,  and  the  data 
subsequently analysed by ANCOVA cross-sectionally. The methods recommended by the CHMP lead to 
th
e  same  conclusion  as  that  from  the  primary  analysis,  which indicate  that  the  treatment  is  effective 
and  that  this  conclusion  is  reliable  even  with  the  presence  of  the  uncertai
nty  associated  with  the 
primary analysis. The evidence for the presence of the treatment effect is not
 highly dependent on the 
selected analysis methods. 
Consistency of Estimated Treatment Ef
fects Across Subgroups and Studies
A  further  CHMP  concern  regarding  the  magnitude  of  Bronchitol’s  effect  was  that  “the  pattern  of 
estimated  treatment  effects  is  inconsistent  within  each  study  across  important  subgroups  defined  by 
age  (children,  adolescents  and  adults)  and  the  pattern  of  effects  in  each  age  group  is  inconsistent 
between studies”. 
In an effort to demonstrate the consistency of the treatment effects across subgroups and studies, the 
applicant stated that the treatment effect as measured by the relative change in % of predicted FEV 1 
was  estimated  for  the  age  subgroups  for  both  DPM-CF-301  and  302  studies,  based  on  the  estimates 
from  the  primary  analysis  using  MMRM  model.  It  is  acknowledged  that  heterogeneity  should  not  be 
claimed on the basis of the observed treatment-effect sizes withi
n each subgroup alone, while there is 
uncertainty of these estimates. Therefore, the age subgroup data are plotted as a forest plot for initial 
visual  inspection.  The  forest  plot  for  the  treatment  effects  of  the  three  age  subgroups  in  each  of  the 
two  studies  (DPM-CF-301  and  302)  was  presented  by  the  applicant  showing  the  actual  number  of 
patients used in the estimation of treatment effect (Figure 11). 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 89/126
 
 
 
 
To further address the concern of the uncertainty associated with the MMRM  estimates, the applicant 
presented the subgroup estimates based on the ANCOVA analysis of Week 26 data i
mputed by LOCF or 
BOCF. 
While  acknowled
ging  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  estimates  from  MMRM  model,  Figure  11 
s
hows  that  the  95%  CIs  for  the  treatment  effects  of  the  six  subgroups  have  substantial  overlap  with 
each other. More importantly, all the point estimates are well above unity of 0, except for the children 
in study DPM-CF-301 and adolescents in study DPM-CF-302. Due to the overlap in the 95% CIs among 
the  subgroups,  it  should  not  be  concluded  that  the  effect  of  Bronchito
l  on  children  in  study  DPM-CF-
301 or adolescents in study DPM-CF-302 are different from other subgroups. Th
e sample sizes in the 
children  and  adolescents  subgroups  are  quite  small  which,  as  would  be  expected,  contributes  to  the 
larger uncertainty in the estimated treatment effects for these subgroups. 
The patterns of the treatment effects for all subgroups, regardless of the imputation methods (LOCF or 
BOCF) are very similar to those observed in Figure 11. The treatment effects among the age subgroups 
all consistently favour Bronchitol. Therefore, it can be concluded that the t
reatment effects estimated 
a
mong the subgroups are independent of the analysis methods. 
In general, in the presence of an overall effect, real (as opposed to simply observed) discrepancies in 
subgroups are rare. When such discrepancies are seen, a usual approach to understanding whether or 
not  they  are  real  is  to  look  at  other  studies  and  see  if  the  discrepancy  is  replicated.  Neither  of  the 
apparent discrepancies (the children in study DPM-CF-301 or the adolescents in study DPM-CF-302) is 
replicated  in  the  complimentary  study.  Based  on  visual  inspection  of  the  forest  plots,  it  should  be 
concluded  that  the  treatment  effects  in  all  age  subgroups  are  largely  consistent,  and  the  pattern  of 
treatment effects predominantly favours Bronchitol.

Statistical Assessment of Uniformity of Treatment Effects among Age Subgroups 
Interaction Test 
To  formally  assess  whether  the  treatment  effect  is  consistent  across  the  age  subgroups  within  each 
s
tudy,  the  interaction  between  treatment  and  age  groups  was  tested  for  each  of  the  studies.  The 
results from the Sum
mary of Clinical Efficacy are extracted as follows: 
  DPM-CF-301: interaction between treatment and age group, p-value=0.551  
  DPM-CF-302: interaction between treatment and age group, p-value=0.384  
The  above  analyses  were  based  on  MMRM  model.  The  interaction  between  treatment  and  age  group 
has  also  been  assessed  by  using  ANCOVA  to  analyse  Week  26  data  imputed  by  LOCF  or  BOCF,  as 
requested by CHMP. The p-values of these interaction tests are as follows: 
The  interaction  test  takes  into  account  the  point  estimate  of  the  treatment  effect  and  the  variation 
associated with the estimates. It is acknowledged that the interaction test might suffer from the small 
sample size in each subgroup, and accordingly the test might not identify a true interaction due to lack 
of  power.  Therefore,  despite  the  general  agreement  that  an  insignificant  test  result  does  not  exclude 
the  possibility  of  true  interaction,  nevertheless  an  insignificant  interaction  does  not  support  that  the 
treatment  effect  is  heterogeneous  across  the  age  subgroups.  The  evidence  from  interaction  tests 
supports a
 homogeneous treatment effect, regardless of the data or statistical models used. 
Heterogeneity test 
To further assess if there is heterogeneity of treatment effects across the studies and age subgroups, a 
heterogeneity test as proposed by Cochran (1954) was used, following the meta-analysis approach. 
It is assumed that the treatment effects estimated from each subgroup are independent. Though this 
assumption  is  not  strictly  true  in  this  case  (as  subgroup  data  were  collected  within  the  two  studies 
sepa
rately),  a  minor  violation  of  this  assumption  should  not  invalidate  the  test.  Therefore,  age 
subgroups  from  both  studies  are  used  for  the  heterogeneity  test.  The  p-values  for  the  heterogeneity 
test  are  0.715,  0.558  and  0.682  respectively  for  LOCF,  BOCF  and  the  primary  analysis. Although  the 
heterogeneity  test  (like  the  interaction  test)  suffers  from  a  small  sample  size  (six  subgroups  in  this 
case),  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  an  assertion  that  the  treatment  effect  is  not  consistent  across 
the studies and age groups.

Normal Quantile Plot 
The question of whether the underlying treatment effects from each age group can all be considered as 
being  drawn  from  the  same  (single)  population  or  from  heterogeneous  populations  can  be  further 
explored  with  a  normal  quantile  plot.  In  this  method  a  standardised  treatment  effect  (z-score)  is 
calculated  for  each  age  group  in  each  study.  The  standardised  treatment  effect  is  equal  to  the  point 
estimate  divided  by  the  standard  error  of  the  estimate,  so  takes  into  account  the  uncertainty  of  the 
estimate. 
Wang and Bushman (1998) show how a normal quantile plot can be used to assess whether subgroups 
are  all  from  one  population,  or  not.  Each  standardized  effect-size  estimate  should  have  a  standard 
deviation of 1. If the subgroups do all come from the same population, then the distribution of effect 
size estimates will be approximately normal. Thus, the plotted line in the normal quantile plot for the 
age subgroup data should be straight and should have a slope close to 1. If the slope is substantially 
less than one, this indicates unusually little variability between subgroups – a fact that in itself would 
be unexpected. The normal quantile plots for each of the missing data methods are reported in Figure 
14. 
For each of the different methods, all the observed standardised treatment effects fall within their 95% 
confidence  bands  and  are  close  to  their  respective  straight  line.  In  all  cases  the  mean  of  the 
standardised treatment effects is well above 0 (0 would indicate no treatment effect). The slopes of the 
regression  line  for  LOCF  and  BOCF  are  less  than  1  (both  are  approximately  0.81),  as  expected, 
because  these  two  methods  could  reduce  the  variation  in  the  data  when  change  from  baseline  is 
calculated.  The  slope  for  the  primary  analysis  is  1.03.  Thus,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  treatment 
effects across the studies and age subgroups are from the same population.

Finally,  a  simulation  has  been  conducted  to  further  explore  whether  or  not  the  observed  treatment 
effects  among  the  six  subgroups  are  from  the  same  population.  The  mean  (standard  error)  for  the 
relative change in % of predicted FEV 1 was estimated to be 5.81 (0.78) and 2.26 (0.89) respectively 
for  the  Bronchitol  and  control  groups,  based  on  the  MMRM  analysis  of  the  combined  data.  Individual 
patient  data  for  each  age  group  were  drawn  randomly  from  populations  with  the  following 
distributions: 
Bronchitol Normal (mean=5.81, standard deviation=0.78√361) 
Control Normal (mean=2.26, standard deviation=0.89√239), 
where  361  and  239  were  the  sample  sizes  for  the  Bronchitol  and  control  groups,  respectively,  as 
reported in the combined studies. This generates  samples assuming that all the age groups have the 
same underlying mean effect. In each sampling, the same number of patients as that reported in the 
studies  was  randomly  drawn  for  each  age  subgroup.  The  treatment  effect  within  each  age  subgroup 
and the range of the treatment effect (max minus min) among the six subgroups were calculated for 
each  sampling.  This  process  was  repeated  10000  times.  The  observed  range  of  treatment  effects 
among the age subgroup in the trials is approximately 5.71 (6.13-0.42, Figure 11), which falls within 
the 10% and 90% percentiles of the simulation distribution. This shows that effect sizes as divergent 
as those seen, even when the true underlying effect size is the same in all subgroups, is wholly to be 
expected. Thus, this further supports the assertion that the treatment effects among the six subgroups 
are from the same population. 
In  summary,  although  each  single  piece  of  evidence  alone  cannot  be  considered  conclusive,  the 
combined evidence from the forest plots, interaction tests, the heterogeneity tests, the normal quantile 
plots  and  the  simulations  do  not  support  the  conclusion  that  the  treatment  effect  is  not  the  same 
across studies and age groups. It is therefore concluded that the observed variation is due to expected 
sampling  variation  rather  than  true  differences.  All  the  evidence  collectively  supports  that  the 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

treatment effects are consistent across the studies and subgroups. Further, this supports the statistical 
validity of combining the two study populations for analysis. 
Assessing Possible Control Effect in Children and Adolescent Subgroups 
As  evidenced  in  the  previous  section,  the  variation  noted  in  treatment  effect  estimates  between 
subgroups and across studies is consistent with expected sampling variation. 
When  looking  at  the  Bronchitol  arm,  there  is  consistently  a  significant  improvement  within  all  age 
subgroups across both studies showing a ≥4% relative change from baseline in % predicted FEV1. 
However, it is acknowledged that there does appear to be more variation in the control effect (Figure 
16).  Control  in  both  pivotal  studies  comprised  50mg  b.i.d.  of  respirable  mannitol.  Notably  the  adult 
subgroup which was the subject of the CHMP opinion did not show any control effect in either study, 
whereas there was a suggestion of a control effect in the younger age groups.  
In the first pivotal study, DPM-CF-301, there was a suggestion that there may have been an effect at 
the  lower  dose  in  children  (possibly  due  to  their  smaller  lung  size).  However,  when  children  and 
adolescents  receiving  control  in  DPM-CF-301  were  examined  by  FEV1  improvement  against  height  (a 
surrogate for lung volume), no relationship was seen. This lack of correlation was supported by DPM-
CF-302 data, where children showed a meaningful effect versus control, but adolescents  did not. The 
earlier phase II, two week dosing studies did not show efficacy in children or adolescents at a dose of 
40 mg b.i.d. 
The  more  variable  control  response  in  children  and  adolescents  is  consistent  with  sampling  variation 
alone  but  the  applicant  acknowledges  that  other  expl
anations  are  possible.  There  are  a  number  of 
a
dditional hypotheses which could contribute to this type of control effect.

 
Firstly, it is known that CF management in adolescents can be particularly erratic, although study 
drug  compliance  appeared  to  be  similar  between  Bronchitol  and  Control  arms  in  all  age  groups 
(Children  –  86.5  vs  87.3%,  Adolescents  –  80.1  vs  83.0%,  Adults  –  78.3  vs  82.2%  respectively). 
However,  improved  compliance  in  pre-existing  therapy  due  to  study  participation  could  be 
contributing. 
  Secondly,  although  study  DPM-CF-202  suggested  t
hat  the  50mg  control  dose  was  subtherapeutic 
in all ages, som  effect in young patients over a longer time course cannot be excluded, and only a 
e
study  in  children  and  adolescents  performed  using  non-respirable  rather  than  respirable  mannitol 
as  placebo  might  confirm  this.  If  the  control  did  have  an  effect,  then  the  effect  size  in  patients 
under 18 would be an underestimation. 
 
Lastly,  a  control  effect  may  be  more  apparent  in  children  because  of  their  inherent  difficulty  in 
initiating  an  effective,  productive  cough  at  will,  to  assist  mucus  clearance.  As  both  doses  of 
mannitol provoke some cough, this may have been more impactful in children, despite this being 
secondary to the main MCC mechanism of action. 
Apparent  treatment  differences  by  age  in  cystic  fibrosis  are  not  unique  to  Bronchitol,  and  in  a 
tobramycin 
pivotal  study  there  were  large  differences  in  the  placebo  arm  of  children  compared  to 
adolescents (Ramsey et al, 1999).  
It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  in  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  when  patients  switched  to 
Bronchitol  treatment  after  26  weeks  of
  control  treatment  an  improvement  in  FEV1  was  noted  during 
the subsequent 6 months during the open label phase. 
The increase in FEV1 attained in the Bronchitol treated ex-control arm in the open label phase is similar 
to  the  level  of  improvement  noted  with  the  Bronchitol  arm  in  the  double  blind  phase.  This  strongly 
suggests  that  control  patients  have  not  achieved  maximal  FEV1  benefits  on  control  and  provides 
further evidence of Bronchitol’s effectiveness.  
In summary, Bronchitol’s magnitude of effect can be determined with sufficient certainty to confirm it 
is clinically meaningful. It has been shown that the effect size provided by the DPM-CF-301 study has 
not been overestimated to any meaningful extent despite patient withdrawals, and 
regardless of which 
analyses  model  is  used  Bronchitol  provides  clear  FEV   improvement.  This  is  further  confirmed  by 
1
sensitivity analyses. There is no statistical evidence of internal inconsistencies amongst age groups or 
between studies, as the variability is consistent with expected sampling variation within this CF patient 
population. 
CHMP position on grounds 1 and 2  
The  main  studies  in  support  of  this  application  are  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302,  which 
included  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  and  used  absolute  change  from  baseline  in  lung  function 
(FEV ) as the primary efficacy variable. Mean (SD) baseline FEV  percent predicted in study DPM-CF-

301 (safety population, N= 295) was 62.4 (SD:16.45) and 61.4 (SD:16.13) in the mannitol and control 
groups,  respectively.  These  figures  for  study  DPM-CF-302  (N=305)  are  as  follows:  65.24  (SD:13.90) 
and  64.35  (SD:15.29).  In  study  DPM-CF-301  64.4  %  of  the  patient  population  were  adults  while  in 
study  DPM-CF-302  this  figure  was  49.5%.  Fifty  five  %  of  patients  were  receiving  rhDNase  in  study 
DPM-CF-301  while  in  study  DPM-CF-302  this  number  was  75%.  The  percentage  of  patients  receiving 
inhaled antibiotics was 55% in study DPM-CF-301 and 56% in study DPM-CF-302.  
During  the  initial  evaluation  procedure,  the  CHMP  raised  a  number  of  concerns  regarding  the 
methodology, conduct and interpretation of the two pivotal trials. The concerns remaining at the end of

that  procedure,  following  a  GCP  inspection  that  raised  no  critical  issues,  related  to  the  impact  of  the 
non-negligible  amount  of  missing  data  due  to  patient  withdrawals  and  the  consequent  uncertainty  in 
understanding  the  true  effect  of  treatment  with  Bronchitol,  also  to  the  apparent  heterogeneity  within 
the trial results.  These uncertainties were considered unacceptable in light of the conclusion that the 
clinical relevance of the treatment effect was questionable. During the re-examination procedure, the 
view of CHMP on the clinical relevance of the results was changed following consultation of an ad-hoc 
expert group (discussed below). The applicant presented a range of statistical analyses to investigate 
the  robustness  of  the  estimated  trea
tment  effect  to  different  assumptions  on  how  to  handle  the  data 
that were missing. In lig t of the revised view on the clinical relevance of the estimated effects,
h
 these 
a
nalyses  were  accepted  as  comprehensively  addressing  concerns  over  the  uncertain
ty  introduced 
because  of  missing  data  due  to  patient  withdrawal.

According to the study reports of studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302, the number of subjects with at 
least  one  protocol  defined  pulmonary  exacerbation  (PDPE,  defined  by  the  presence  of  at  least  4 
symptoms and signs plus the use of intravenous antibiotics) was 18.1% in the mannitol arm and 28% 
in the control arm in study DPM-CF-301 (ITT population). In study DPM-CF-302 15.2% of the subjects 
in  the  mannitol  arm  and  19%  of  the  subjects  in  the  control  had  a  PDPE.  The  PDPE  mean  (SD)  rate 
(events  per  subject  per  year)  was  0.78  (1.976)  in  the  mannitol  group  and  1.05  (2.148)  events  per 
subject per year (rate ratio [95% CI] 0.74 [0.47, 1.18]). In study DPM-CF-302 the rate ratio [95% CI] 
was  0.85,  [0.51,  1.41].  This  is  consistent  with  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  PDPE  in  the  mannitol 
arms by approximately 25% in study DPM-CF-301 and by 15% in study DPM-CF-302. However, a six-
month  period  of  treatment  is  not  sufficiently  lengthy  as  to  permit  an  adequate  assessment  of  this 
variable.  
The  change  in  FEV 1  can  be  measured  as  the  absolute  change  from  baseline  (in  litres),  the  relative 
change (as percent change from baseline), or the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1. While the 
predefined  primary  endpoint  in  the  two  phase  3  pivotal  studies  is  the  change  from  baseline  in  FEV1 
(mL) in the response to the CHMP gro
unds for refusal, the results are discussed as the relative change 
in FEV 1 predicted of normal. This is also in line with the expert group’s position received. They noted 
that the assessment based on relative % predicted change is better than the use of absolute change in 
mL, the latter being not considered appropriate for the study. However, the experts also noted that the 
absolute % predicted change would have been even better and this was endorsed by the CHMP. 
It is not controversial that the effect size for FEV 1 observed in studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302, 
which  investigated  the  dose  of  400  mg  bid,  is  small.  Overall  treatment  with  mannitol  showed  an 
improvement  of  approximately  2-3%  compared  with  the  control  group  over  26  weeks  in  terms  of 
percent predicted FEV 1. The clinical relevance of such a marginal effect size needs to be established in 
the overall context of CF management and prognosis. The experts group confirmed that benchmarking 
for  a  product  impacting  on  sputum  clearance  like  inhaled  mannitol  would  need  to  consider  the 
respective  mode  of  action.  In  ge
neral,  a  comparison  against  antibiotics  has  limitations.  Based  on  the 
expected effect on the volume of liquid on the airway surface it would appear that nebulised hypertonic 
saline (HS) seems the medicinal product most closely related to inhaled mannitol; however the use of 
nebulised HS in cystic fibrosis is not an approved therapy and all the evidence for the use of nebulised 
HS in  patients  with  CF is limited  to  published  studies.  This view  was  shared by  the  expert  group  and 
subsequently endorsed by the CHMP. 
The expert group confirmed that the effect size observed with inhaled mannitol is small and based on 
the  available  data  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  whether  the  treatment  effect  is  clinically  relevant. 
Nevertheless  the  expert  group  unanimously  ag
reed  that  in  the  overall  treatment  approach  for  cystic 
fibrosis  patients  any  improvement  in  lung  function  can  be  of  relevance  in  an  individual  patient  given 
the deterioration of FEV 1 inherent to the disease progression. Since the lung function is progressively 
declining in cystic fibrosis patients over time, any intervention that slightly improves lung function can 
be  of  relevance  for  the  long-term  management  of  these  patients  in  clinical  practice.  The  CHMP 
accepted the experts’ opinion that even the small improvement in lung function that was observed on 
average across the population included in the clinical trials, which might normally not be detectable in 
an individual patient in clinical practice, is of clinical importance to cystic fibrosis patients where lung 
function deteriorates over time. 
Another  issue  raised  by  the  CHMP  was  the  heterogeneity  between  and  within  studies  with  respect  to 
benefit  on  lung  function.  While  study  DMP-CF-301  showed  a  statistically  significant  benefit  for  FEV1 
(mL),  study  DPM-CF-302  did  not,  at  least  in  terms  of  the  primary  analysis.  Furthermore,  there  were 
differences in outcome for children, adolescents, and adults. The applicant has presented a number of 
statistical  analyses  to  address  the  internal  inconsistency  observed  in  the  pattern  of  effect  across  age 
groups  and  between  studies.  The  limitations  of  any  such  approach  have  been  acknowledged.    It  is

concluded that the inconsistencies seen in subgroups can be attributed to the inherent variability and 
to the fact that the overall effect size is small.  
Based  on  the  available  data,  any  such  effect  can  only  be  considered  demonstrated  in  the  adult 
population. In studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 relative % predicted FEV1 compared to control in 
children (6-11 years) was improved by 0.44% (95% CI -5.90, 6.77, N=43) and 6.1% (95% CI -1.28, 
13.54, N=59) over 26 weeks (p=0.892 and 0.104) respectively. In adolescents (12-17 years) relative 
change in % predicted FEV 1 compared to control improved by 3.31% (95% CI -2.29, 8.90, N=55) and 
0.42% (95% CI -5.45, 6.29, N=94) over 26 weeks (p=0.245 and 0.888) respectively. In principle it is 
not  expected  that  efficacy  differs  between  children/adolescents  and  adults;  however,  the  data  from 
studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 do not support this. Particularly the results in adolescents were 
considered surprising by the expert group from a clinical perspective as this is the patient population 
where normally benefits are clearly demonstrated, which seems not to be the case across both pivotal 
studies.  The  available  data  in  children  and  adolescents  does  however  not  demonstrate  the  benefit  of 
inhaled  mannitol  in  this  population.  During  the  evaluation  procedure  the  applicant  restricted  the 
applied indication to the use in adults. It is therefore considered appropriate to limit any use of inhaled 
mannitol  to  the  adult  population,  given  that  the  effect  size  in  the  adult  population  was  similar  in  the 
two  pivotal  studies  and  that  this  effect  was  consistent  with  the  2  supportive  studies  all  showing  a 
similar  benefit  in  FEV 1  (for  both  Phase  III  studies  there  was  a  statistically  significant  benefit  in  the 
primary  efficacy  variable,  change  in  FEV1  from  baseline  to  study  end,  for  Bronchitol  compared  to 
control treatment arms). This suggests that the benefit is real, and is unlikely to be an artefact of the 
subgroup  analyses  presented  by  age.  In  addition  it  is  considered  that  the  effect  has  been  measured 
with  acceptable  precision,  and  it  is  recognised  by the  ad-hoc  expert  group  cystic  fibrosis experts  and 
the  CHMP  to  be  small,  but  of  clinical  relevance.  Moreover,  the  differential  response  according  to 
patients’  age  may  be  due  to  clinical  trials  conducted  in  a  refractory  disease,  in  a  relatively  small 
number  of
  patients.  Taking  the  above  information  into  account,  the  CHMP  concludes  that  the  studies 
are considered reliable. 
Nevertheless,  it  is  recognized  that  the  main  studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  included  children, 
adolescents,  and  adults,  thereby  the  overall  patient  population  relevant  for  the  condition  “cystic 
fibrosis”. Given the prevalence in individuals below the age of 18 years, treatment of this population is 
of  particular  relevance.  Whilst  this  is  the  population  for  which  a  clinical  benefit  can  be  established,  it 
remains paramount from a clinical perspective and for the benefit risk assessment of the use of inhaled 
mannitol in this condition to further investigate the efficacy and safety of inhaled mannitol in children 
and  adolescents  with  cystic  fibrosis.  The  applicant  is  therefore  requested  as  a  condition  to  the 
marketing authorization to perform a study in this regard. A first draft synopsis was presented by the 
applicant  during  the  evaluation;  it  was  noted  that  it  would  be  important  to  assess  the  effect  of 
treatment by use of inhaled antibiotics, which are often used in an "on cycle" (4 weeks) and in an "off 
cycle"  (4  weeks),  and  that  the  duration  of  the  observation  period  would  need  to  account  for  such 
treatment regimen.  The study protocol shall be agreed with the CHMP prior to the start of the study 
and  the  final  results  provided  to  the  CHMP  and  EMA  by  June  2015.  The  submission  of  the  study 
protocol is  envisaged  for Q2  2012.  It  is  highly  recommended  to  obtain  scientific  advice  for  this  study 
protocol.  
It  was  also  raised  previously  that  the  differentiation  between  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  has 
limitations  due  to  the  study  design  and  the  results  obtained.  In  rhDNase  users  in  study  DPM-CF-301 
the relative change in FEV1 % predicted from baseline across 26 weeks of treatment was  2.83 (95% 
CI  -0.62,  6.27).  For  non-users  the  relative  change  was  4.30  (95%  CI  0.53,  8.07).  In  study  DPM-CF-
302 the relative change (95% CI) for rhDNase use
rs and non-users was 3.21 (-0.61, 7.03) and 4.73 (-
1.93,  11.40),  respectively.  It  needs  to  be  acknowledged  that  the  studies  were  not  powered  for  the 
analysis of these two subgroups. When experts were requested to provide their opinion on what would

constitute an adequate definition of patients intolerant to, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase, they 
stated  that  the  criteria  for  the  subgroups  related  to  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  not  pre-
specified  for  both  studies  which  rendered  the  interpretation  of  the  results  very  difficult.  Moreover, 
studies  DPM-CF-301  and  DPM-CF-302  were  not  powered  to  make  such  stratifications.  From  a  clinical 
perspective,  the  proposed  distinction  between  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  appeared  difficult  given 
that  in  practice  the  (non-)use  of  rhDNAse  is  also  subject  to  patient’s  choice,  hence  the  definition  of 
rhDNAse  non-users  appeared  not  appropriate.  Therefore,  to  overcome  this  obstacle  the  claimed 
indication was changed by the applicant to refer to the add-on therapy to best standard of care. This 
change was deemed acceptable by the CHMP in light of
 the fact that although the effect size appears to 
b
e  smaller in  the  rhDNase  users,  both rhDNase  users  and  non-users  can  benefit  from  the  addition  of 
mannitol to their treatment regime. The clinical experts from the ad hoc expert group highlighted that 
even a small effect size can be considered relevant. The data on FEV1 are given greater weight in the 
assessment  than  the  QoL  data,  where  the  absence  of  effect  is  perhaps  not  surprising  in  light  of  the 
commonly accepted insensitivity of these scales.  
Both  Phase  III  studi
es  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  in  the  primary  efficacy  variable, 
change in FEV 1 from baseline to study en
both rhDNase users and non-users. These data supersede the rather equivocal and difficult to interpret 
d, for Bronchitol compared to the control treatment arms, for 
data from phase II studies given that the phase III studies are larger and better reflect clinical practice 
since  both  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  included.  The  CHMP  conclusion  is  that  the  effect  in 
rhDNAse users and non-users is established, that clinical benefit in both rhDNAse users and non-users 
is positive and that benefits in both groups are considered clinically relevant.  
In conclusion, further to the assessment of the applicant’s responses to the grounds for refusal the and 
to  the  advice  provided  by  the  ad-hoc  expert  group,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  grounds  for  refusal 
No. 1 and No. 2 had been adequately addressed. 
Ground  3:  The limited efficacy, of uncertain magn
itude, is considered not to outweigh the observed 
and potential safety concerns, relating primarily to bronchoconstriction events and haemoptysis, such 
that a favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded.  
Applicant´s position: (summarised) 
The  overall  AE  incidence,  including  SAEs,  was  very  similar  between  treatment  groups,  irrespective  of 
age  group  or  concomitant  rhDNase  use.  The  remaining  safety  concerns  raised  in  the  grounds  for 
refusal  related  primarily  to  risks  of  bronchoconstriction  or  haemoptysis.  The  applicant  wanted  to  
demonstrate that the level of haemoptysis noted in pivotal studies is in line
 with that expected in a CF 
population  and  that  the  proposed  initiation  dose  assessment  and  prophylactic  bronchodilator  use 
adequately minimises the risk of bronchoconstriction. The applicant believes that both of these safety 
concerns  can
  be  further  allayed  with  the  proposed  SPC  and  RMP  activities  including  close  monitoring 
(with re-testing for bronchial hyper-reactivity after six weeks if indicated) and cumulative re
views of all 
adverse events associated with both of these AEs. 
Bronchospasm i
s not a high risk 
Inhaled mannitol is a known bronchoconstrictive agent, specifically in sensitive patients with bronchial 
hyper-responsiveness.  Because  of  this,  mandated  steps  were  introduced  to  minimize  risk  in  the 
Bronchitol  development  programme;  namely,  a  mannitol  tolerability  screening  test  (MTT)  to  detect 
reactive bronchoconstriction to mannitol, and prophylactic bronchodilator use prior to administration of 
mannitol.  While  it  is  true  that  acute  bronchoconstriction  can  potentially  occur  during  treatment  in 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

susceptible CF patients, the findings in the pivotal studies show bronchoconstriction is infrequent and if 
bronchoconstriction does occur, it is not severe, responds to treatment which is available to the patient 
(e.g. salbutamol), and is temporary. 
The following issues raised by the CHMP were addressed by the applicant: 
  Bronchitol  does  not  increase  the  incidence  of  bronchoconstriction  in  patients  more  likely  to  be  at 
risk 
  Bronchitol does not increase the incidence of bronchoconstriction during exacerbations 
 
The risk of bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) developing does not increase with chronic use of 
Bronchitol. 
Wheeze  and  dyspnoea  are  features  of  airways  disease  in  cystic  fibrosis,  and  may  result  from 
bronchospasm  as  well  as  other  causes  of  airway  obstruction.  Obstructive  lung  disease  is  a  major 
source  of  disability  in  CF,  and  wheezing  and  exercise  intolerance  are  commonly  described.  Although 
bronchial  hyperreactivity may  be  present,  in  most  patients  the  obstruction  relates  to  excessive  viscid 
secretions,  inflammation  of  airway  walls,  and  increased  compressibility  of  airways  during  expiration. 
This contrasts with asthmatics, in whom bronchial hyper-reactivity leading to bronchoconstriction is the 
common factor. Because of this, Bronchitol would lead to a degree of bronchial narrowing in more than 
80%  of  asthmatics  if  untreated  with  steroids  or  bronchodilators.  This  contrasts  with  an  earlier 
Bronchitol  study  in  cystic  fibrosis  (DPM-CF-202)  in  which  patien
ts  did  not  receive  pre-treatment 
bronchodilator,  12%  of  these  CF  patients  (6/52)  had  an  FEV1  decrease  exceeding  20%  at  screening. 
Furthermore,  no  fall  exceeded  25%.  In  the  two  pivotal  cystic  fibrosis  studies,  in which  pre-treatment 
bronchodilator was used, about 6% of patients failed a test of mannitol tolerability at screening. 
A  risk  in  the  CF  population  is  therefore  recognized,  but  in  the  six  month  pivotal  studies  which 
mandated screening and prophylaxis, bronchospasm related events were infrequently reported and not 
severe in intensity. 
Bronchoconstriction risk si
milar between study arms 
Bronchospasm itself was a rare event in the Phase 3 studies, reported by only 2 pati
ents. Both patients 
were adults in study DPM-CF-301, and both were in the Bronchitol group (1 rhDNase user and 1 non-
rhDNase user). Both events were considered treatment-related and both led to study discontinuation. 
One of these events was reported as an SAE; the patient was symptom free and recovered to baseline 
FEV 1  within  half  an  hour.  He  was  an  rhDNase  non-user  who  had  an  FEV 1  fall  of  16%  from  baseline 
(21%  from  post-bronchodilator  FEV1)  after  study  drug  at  the  time  of  first  study  drug  administration. 
he  fall  in  FEV1  was  only  1  percent  more  than  that  considered  acceptable  to  continue 
Notably  t
medication. There were no other bronchoconstriction related SAEs. 
Since  wheeze,  chest  discomfort  and  dyspnoea  are  signs  or  symptoms  that  can  result  from 
bronchoconstriction,  these  events  were  also  closely  examined  and  all  found  to  be  infrequent  in  the 
pooled Phase 3 data (Table 8). These have been grouped to the term ‘bronchoconstriction related AEs’ 
(although  such  AEs  might  also  result  from  other  causes).  In  the  overall  population  of  the  pooled 
studies  there  was  a  similar  incidence  of  bronchoconstriction  related  AEs  between  arms  with  6.1%  on 
Bronchitol  vs  5.0%  on  control.  There  were  no  severe  bronchoconstriction  related  AE’s  reported  in 
either study.  
There were no trends for these AEs that suggest greater risk for any age group. 
Similar  findings  are  seen  in  the  rhDNase  user  subgroups.  In  rhDNase  users,  the  incidence  of 
bronchoconstriction related AEs was 7.3% on Bronchitol, and 5.0% on control. In rhDNase non-users 
the incidence was 3.9% on Bronchitol and 3.8% on control. N
otably though in rhDNase users a medical

history  of  asthma  was  more  common  in  Bronchitol  than  the  control  group  (32.6%  vs  20.1%),  which 
would  predict  a  higher  incidence  of  bronchoconstriction  related  AE’s  in  the  Bronchitol  arm  during  the 
studies.  
Bronchoconstriction risk comparable to expected background rate 
The  incidence  of  bronchoconstriction  or  associated  events  is  similar  between  Bronchitol  and  control 
arms.  However,  the  CHMP  have  previously  raised  concerns  that  a  control  using  subtherapeutic 
mannitol might lead to an underestimation of difference between groups, even though incidence is low. 
The expected background of bronchoconstriction can also be estimated from the placebo arms of other 
CF studies, in particular when they are of similar length and disease severity. It should be noted that 
the  aztreonam  data  was  collected  over  4  weeks  whereas  6  month  data  is  presented  for  Bronchitol, 
tobramycin and rhDNase. 
When  Bronchitol  is  compared  with  studies  using  other  inhaled  CF  agents  (rhDNase,  aztreonam,  TOBI 
and  TIP),  the  incidence  of  dyspnoea,  wheeze,  chest  discomfort,  or  bronchospasm  events  on  ei er 
th
B
ronchitol (400 mg B.I.D.) or control (50 mg B.I.D.) did not exceed the background rates based on the 
placebo arms in other studies (shaded columns in Table 8). 
In addition, Bronchitol, tobramycin and aztreonam trial data allowed comparison of acute falls in FEV1 
immediately  after  study  drug  administration.  The  data  suggests  that  Bronchitol  results  in  a  lower 
incidence of significant acute FEV 1 falls than either tobramycin or aztreonam (Table 8). 
In summary, the overall incidence of bronchoconstriction events does not suggest any increased risk of 
Bronchitol over control, and these rates are consistent with that expected in a CF population. 
However, there were concerns that the prolonged use of Bronchitol, or particularly susceptible patients 
or disease exacerbations may increase the risk. Assessment of these issues did not show any evidence 
that these posed any particular risks for bronchoconstriction as summarised in the following sections. 
Bronchoconstriction events are not increased after long term treatment 
If  the  sensitivity  to  bronchoconstriction  increased  with  long  term  treatment,  then  acute  falls  in  FEV1 
after Bronchitol administration would also be expected to increase over time. However, the FEV1 falls 
post  dose  at  the  early  study  visits  were  similar  to  those  observed  during  visits  after  26  weeks  of 
treatment. In the pooled studies, 246 patients could be analysed and the majority (135 (54.9%)) had 
a smaller fall in FEV1 after 26 weeks of treatment. Consistent with this, the overall mean falls in FEV  
1

at each of these visits were similar. Thus, the data is not suggestive of increased bronchial reactivity 
after long term Bronchitol treatment. 
As  supportive  evidence,  similar  results  were  seen  when  looking  at  bronchodilator  reversibility  at  the 
beginning and end of the treatment period. Increasing reversibility over time to a bronchodilator might 
also  suggest  an  increase  in  BHR.  In  the  combined  studies,  7/246  (2.8%)  Bronchitol  patients  and 
11/170 (6.5%) control patients changed from < 12% reversibility to ≥ 12% reversibility in FEV 1 from 
Week 0 to Week 26. In contrast, 12/246 (4.9%) Bronchitol patients and 1/170 (0.6%) control patients 
changed from ≥ 12% reversibility to < 12% reversibility in FEV1 from Week 0 to Week 26. Thus falls in 
FEV 1  after  drug  administration  and  reversibility  to  bronchodilator  shows  no  evidence  of  increased 
susceptibility to bronchoconstriction after long term use of Bronchitol. 
Bronchoconstriction events are not increased significantly during exacerbations 
Patients  with  meaningful  reactivity  to  mannitol  at  screening  were  excluded  from  the  studi
es,  and  the 
patient  group  continuing  with  therapy  did  not  then  exhibit  bronchial  reactivity  while  on  treatment. 
However  it  is  conceivable  that  increased  bronchial  hyper-reactivity  could  become  apparent  with 
worsening  airway  inflammation  at  the  time  of  pulmona
ry  exacerbations.  However,  it  was  found  that 
Bronchitol does not worsen the degree of bronchoconstriction at the time of CF exacerbations. 
Falls in FEV 1 in response to Bronchitol at the time of exacerbations (within 7 days) were examined, as 
a meaningful number of patients (N=64) experienc
ed exacerbations within a week of study visits. 
Only in  five patients  out  of  58  (2  out  of  30  in  Bronchitol  group  and  3  out  of  28  in
  control  group)  did 
FEV 1  fall  more  than  10%  following  Bronchitol  or  control  drug  administration  at  the  time  of  an 
exacerbation.  Falls  of  10%  are  not  considered  excessive,  thus  only  two  patients  (6.7%)  experienced 
notable falls in FEV 1 around the time of an exacerbation while on Bronchitol treatment. In no case did 
the fall exceed 20% and most were close to 10%. 
Further to the lack of increased FEV 1 falls in response to study drug, falls in FEV1 and dyspnoea were 
also recorded 
as components of an exacerbation, and these were both reported in similar proportions 
of  patients  experiencing  exacerbations  in  the  Bronchitol  and  control  arms.  If  there  was  increased 
bronchial reactivity in the Bronchitol arm at the time of an exacerbation it would be expected that they 
would therefore show a higher frequency of these events. The data is not indicative of this. 
In  addition,  out  of  the  64  patients  experiencing  an  exacerbation  in  either  treatment  arm,  only  7 
(10.9%) had 
bronchoconstriction related AEs reported at the same time, which is similar to the rates of 
these events seen outside the period of exacerbations. 
Thus, while reasonable hypothetical concerns were raised regarding increased airway-reactivity at the 
time  of  exacerbations,  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  higher  frequency  or  greater  severity  of 
bronchoconstriction events during exacerbations. 
Patients with potential susceptibility show no increased risk of bronchoconstriction 
Patients who might potentially be most at risk of increased hyper-reactivity during the study were also 
specifically examined i.e. those
 patients with a degree of bronchoconstriction (FEV1 fall ≥10%) during 
the screening test dose of mannitol but who still went into the study. Patients with a less than 10% fall 
in FEV 1 after the test dose had a similar incidence of bronchoconstriction related AEs to those with at 
least a 10% fall in FEV  (6.3% vs 6.5% respectively) indicating no increase in bronchoconstri
ction risk 
1
in this group. 
Furthermore,  patients  who  had  post  mannitol  falls  in  FEV1  of  10%  or  more  during  their  mannitol 
tolerability  test  at  screening,  had  long-term  FEV 1  improvements  that  were  similar  to  the  rest  of  the 
study  population.  In  this  group  the  falls  in  FEV   post-dose  at  all  visits  were  similar,  and  showed  no

Page 102/126
 
 
change in average fall in FEV1, despite hypothetically being more vulnerable to lung function drops on 
treatment. 
In conclusion an evaluation of more than six hundred patients in both pivotal trials for risks associated 
with bronchospasm, found that the MTT appeared to be a safe and effective screening procedure, since 
bronchoconstriction events during the treatment period were not notable. Although bronchoconstriction 
remains  a  potential  risk,  if  the  recommended  strategy  of  a  screening  test  to  assess  tolerability  in 
addition  to  the  prophylactic  use  of  a  pre-treatment  bronchodilator  is  used,  then  the  apparent  risk  of 
bronchospasm with therapeutic Bronchitol is low. The applicant suggested a reference to the initiation 
dose assessment in section 4.2 of the SPC which is expected to provide an effective safety measure in 
the post authorisation setting. 
Since  bronchospasm  during  and  after  the  initiation  dose  assessment  and  also  during  long  term  use 
were identified as potential risks, a precaution was proposed in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
In addition to the SPC precaution outlined above, it is proposed to include in the product information, 
as  part  of  a  stopping  rule,  that  physicians  will  enquire  whether  patients  experience  an  increase  in 
bronchoconstriction symptoms at the end of the initial treatment period. If symptoms are present then 
it  will  be  recommended  that  the  patient  is  re-assessed  for
  bronchial  hyperresponsiveness  to  inhaled 
mannitol by taking a further 
tolerability test prior to continuing with treatment. If this test is positive 
treatment would be stopped. This would further minimise the risk of bronchospasm. 
Furthermore,  routine  and  additional  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities  have  been 
outlined  in  the  RMP  (Module  1.8.2)  addressing  the  risk  of  bronchospasm  during  and  after  the 
assessment as well as during long-term use. These include as additional risk minimisation activities a 
healthcare  professional  leaflet  addressing  definition,  identification/monitoring  and  information  related 
to these potent
ial risks. 
In  summary,  bronchospasm  is  an  event  uncommonly  reported  across  both  phase  3  studies  and 
bronchoconstriction  related  events  are  reported  at  similar  levels  between  treatment  groups  in  all  age 
and  rhDNase  subgroups  assessed.  Furthermore  an  assessment  of  bronchoconstriction  risk  with  long 
term treatment and in at-risk situations such as during exacerbations, confirmed that there is not an 
increased  risk  of  bronchoconstriction.  However,  bronchospasm  during  and  after  the  initiation  dose 
assessment  and  during  long  term  use  are  identified  as  potential  risks  in  the  Bronchitol  RMP.  The 
proposed labelling includes the assessment for bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled mannitol and 
prophylactic  bronchodilator  use.  These,  together  with  RMP  activities  including  close  monitoring  and 
cumulative 
reviews, will minimise any potential risks. 
Haemoptysis risk is not high
Haemoptysis  is  common  for  patients  with  CF,  although  typically  the  bleeding  is  scant  or  mild.  CF 
patients have chronically inflamed and friable airways and in this pathological situation haemoptysis is 
to  be  expected,  and  is  not  an  unusual  occurrence.  Haemoptysis  can  be  of  varying  cause  for  concern 
depending  on  the  extent  of  bleeding  occurring;  sputum  streaking  has  very  different  implications  to  a 
large haemorrhage. Massive haemoptysis occurs more commonly in older patients with more advanced 
lung disease.  
Overall  the  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  similar  between  the  two  treatment  groups  (15.8%  versus 
14.6% for the Bronchitol and control groups, respectively) in the pooled Phase 3 studies. Haemoptysis 
was  reported  as  an  AE  that  was  outside  an  exacerbation  more  frequently  in  the  Bronchitol  group 
(6.1%)  than  in  the  control  group  (3.8%).  However,  haemoptysis  is  frequently  associated  with  CF 
exacerbations.  Indeed,  two-thirds  (61/92)  of  the  total  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  associated  with 
pulmonary exacerbation. Haemoptysis occurring during an exacerbation was commonly captured as a 
symp
tom  of  the  exacerbation,  and  not  therefore  reported  as  a  separate  AE.  When  all  events  were 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/435462/2012 
Page 103/126
 
 
 
appropriately  included,  the  total  incidence  of  haemoptysis  was  similar  between  treatment  groups 
(Table 9). 
Most  of  the  haemoptysis  events  noted  with  Bronchitol  were  mild  or  moderate,  with  only  1.1%  and 
0.4%  of  patients  reporting  severe  events  of  haemoptysis  in  the  Bronchitol  and  Control  arms 
respectively.  Treatment  emergent  massive  haemoptysis  occurred  infrequently,  in  study  DPM-CF-301 
there  was  one  case  in  each  arm  and  in  study  DPM-CF-302  one  case  in  the  Bronchitol  arm.  This  is 
consistent with the expected rate of massive haemoptysis of 0.9%/year based on reviews published in 
CF. 
Haemoptysis incidence consistent with background rate 
A
s well as the incidence being similar in the Bronchitol and control arms, the incidence of haemopt sis 
y
does  not  exceed  expected  background  rates  based  upon  incidence  observed  in  the  placebo  arms  of 
published therapeutic studies. In patients of simila
r disease severity, the incidence of haemoptysis was 
21%  and  31%  over  6  months  with  rhDNase  and  TOBI  placebo  groups  respectively,  and  was  already 
8%  in  the  Aztreonam  placebo  group  after  1  month  (shaded  columns  in  Table  10).  Thus  the  data 
suggest that the incidence of haemoptysis in the Bronchitol development program is
 not a significant 
risk associated with Bronchitol treatment, but rather a risk consistent with the disease state. 
Although  the  risk  of  haemoptysis  does  not  appear  elevated,  it  is  an  identified  risk.  Therefore  a 
precaution is proposed in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
Furthermore,  routine  and  additional  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities  have  been 
outlined in the RMP (Module 1.8.2) addressing the identified risk of haemoptysis. 
In summary, although the level of haemoptysis noted in pivotal studies is in line with that expected in 
CF, this is an identified risk in the Bronchitol RMP. Therefore the proposed labelling and RMP activities 
including close monitoring and cumulative reviews are in place to minimise this risk. 
Optimisation of benefit/risk – justification for a stopping rule 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

The  applicant  believes  that  adequate  benefit/risk  has  already  been  demonstrated  in  the  overall 
population  of  the  pivotal  studies.  However,  there  are  approaches  which  might  allow  further 
e
nhancement that is either reliably identifying patients who are more likely to respond, or limiting long 
term therapy to those who demonstr
ate a response. 
Firstly, pre-treatment criteria (predicting whether or not a patient will respond long-term to treatment 
based  upon  baseline  characteristics)  were  explored.  For  any  criteria  to  be  useful it  should  reduce  the 
exposure  to  drug  for  patients  that  will  not  experience  any  benefit,  but  also  ensure  that  patients  who
can potentially experience meaningful benefit are not excluded. 
The  second  approach,  to  minimise  any  potential  risks  and  increase  benefit,  involves  a  stopping  rule 
after a trial of therapy to ensure that patients achieve a minimum level of response before continuing 
further  treatment  with  Bronchitol.  A  formal  review  of  response  is  also  an  opportunity  to  question 
patients specifically for signs or symptoms of bronchoconstriction, and investigate further if required. 
Following  an  evaluation  of  over  16  variables  including  age,  disease  severity,  and  lung  infection 
comorbidity,  no  pre-treatment  criteria  were  found  in  which  both  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  were 
high enough to be clinically useful. The alternative approach of a trial of therapy with a stopping rule 
was  therefore  explored,  and  this  is  described  in  the  following  section.  It  was  found  that  an  FEV1 
response after 6
 weeks of treatment was highly predictive of response over the whole 6 months of the 
double  blind  studies,  and  a  stopping  rule  at  6  weeks  for  patients  showing  early  signs  of  response 
therefore offers an attractive option. 
Trial of Therapy with Stopping Rule 
A  trial  of  therapy  with  a  stopping  rule  is  particularly  applicable  if  an  early  response  can  be  shown  to 
reasonably predict a long term response. This in turn minimises exposure in non-responding patients, 
and hence only patients who are likely to continue to respond (‘responders’) continue with treatment. 
To increase objectivity, the assessment was based on an improvement from baseline in FEV1, after a 
fixed  period  of  time.  For  Bronchitol,  a  treatment  period  of  6  weeks  was  explored  to  assess  its 
sensitivity and specificity to predict a sustained response, as this was the earliest time point assessed 
in  the  pivotal  studies,  but  is  also  reasonably  in  keeping  with  the  timing  in  clinical  practice  for  a  first 
follow-up assessment of a new therapy, and does not expose non-responders to unreasonable risk.  
Currently there is no globally accepted threshold for FEV  improvement i
1
n CF, and CHMP guidelines do 
not  define  a  threshold.  European  CF  experts  consulted  considered  that  because  lung  function  is 
continually declining in CF, any statistically significant benefit in lung function is meaningful. Therefore 
a  range  of  response  thresholds  were  explored  from  >  0  to  ≥  12%  relative  improvements  in  % 
predicted FEV 1
. 
Calculations  have  been  performed  regarding  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  each  threshold  for  a 
responder from the pooled clinical studies, thereby providing a measure of how predictive the week 6 
response was for a sustained response out to week 26. This data suggests that most of the thresholds 
explored  are  reasonable;  for  example,  a  response  of  ≥  6%  provides  a  good  balance  of  sensitivity 
(86.5%) and specificity (83.0%), and would lead to 41.3% of patients continuing Bronchitol beyond 6 
weeks.  As  e
xperts  view  any  sustained  benefit  as  meaningful,  thresholds  above  6%  are  unnecessarily 
high to ensure meaningfulness, and also start to lose sensitivity, without much gain in specificity.  
Continuing  with  the  same  example,  (i.e.  a  6%  threshold),  when  the  mean  relative  change  from 
baseline in % predicted in the Bronchitol arm of the overall pooled ITT population was compared with 
that using the 6% threshold, the mean relative change from baseline in % predicted over the 26 week 
study  period  increased  from  4.8%  to  16.3%.  This  provides  an  indication  of  the  enhanced  level  of 
Bronchitol

effectiveness in FEV 1 which can be expected over 26 weeks in a responder population, if the example 
of a stopping rule using a 6% threshold at 6 weeks was introduced. 
The  applicant  proposes  to  implement  the  stopping  rule  by  amending  the  product  information.  It  is 
proposed  that  patients  undergo  a  trial  of  therapy  for  6  weeks,  at  the  end  of  which  the  change  from 
b
aseline  in  FEV 1  will  be  assessed.  Only  if  the  threshold  (to  be  determined)  is  met,  will  patients 
continue with therapy. 
It  is  also  proposed  to  include  an  additional  safety  step  in  the  product  information  as  part
  of  the 
stopping  rule  to  further  minimise  bronchospasm  risk.  Physicians  will  ask  patients  at  the  end  of  th
e 
initial 6 week treatment period whether they have experienced new or increased signs or symptoms of 
bronchoconstriction.  If  present,  it  will  be  recommended  that  the  patient  be  re-assessed  for  bronchial 
hyperresponsiveness  to  inhaled  mannitol  by  taking  a  further  tolerability  test  prior  to  continuing 
Bronchitol. 
In  conclusion,  using  a  stopping  rule  which  includes  a  response  threshold  (to  be  determined)  after  6 
weeks  of  treatment  increases  positive  benefit/risk  by  stopping  treatment  in  non-responders  and 
ensuring  patients  being  treated  meet  a  level  of  FEV   improvement  considered  clinically  meaningful.

The inclusion of a re-test for bronchial hyper-re
activity if bronchoconstriction signs or symptoms arise 
will further reduce the risk of bronchospasm. This type of approach also addresses concerns regarding 
inconsistency  of  effect  as  patients  are  assessed  for  effectiveness  and  only  proceed  if  the  threshold  is 
met,  irrespective  of  age  or  concomitant  rhDNase  use.  Therefore,  the  response  threshold  with  a  
stopping  rule  provides  an  approach  that  improves  the  certainty  of  response,  minimises  risk  and  is  in 
line with the individualised treatment strategy which is used for CF patients. 
CHMP position on ground 3  
The two main safety issues identified by the CHMP were bronchoconstriction and haemoptysis.  
Since  inhaled  dry  powder  mannitol  is  known  to  cause  bronchoconstriction  in  suscept
ible  patients,  all 
patients underwent a mannitol tolerance test (MTT) prior to randomised treatment. In stu
dy DPM-CF-
301, 378 subjects were enrolled and underwent the MTT. Of these 324 were randomised to treatment. 
Of those that failed to progress to randomisation, 27 had a >20% fall in FEV1 following the MTT (7.5% 
of those tested), despite premedication with 400mcg salbutamo
l (mean maximum fall in FEV1 26.4%, 
range 18 – 39). In addition there were 19 subjects who failed to complete the mannitol tolerance test, 
with cough (9/19), bronchoconstriction symptoms (5/19) and nausea (4/19) being the most common 
symptoms associated with incomplete testing.  
Of  the  342  patients  who  underwent  MTT  in  study  DPM-CF-302,  18  (5.3%)  had  a  positive  MTT  and  8 
patients had an incomplete test due to mannitol induced cough or other unspecified reasons. The mean 
maximum fall in FEV 1 was 26.3%. The most frequently reported adverse events reported in association 
with  the  MTT  were  cough  (12.6%)  and  wheeze  (0.9%).  Bronchoconstriction  was  an  expected  effect 
during the MTT and was not considered as an adverse event unless the bronchoconstriction caused a 
>50%  fall  in  FEV   or  the  subject  desaturated  to  <89%.  If  at 
1
any  other  time  during  or  immediately 
following  the  administration  of  the  mannitol/control  powder,  the  subject  experienced  a  fall in  FEV1  of 
>20%  due  to  bronchoconstriction,  the  subject  was  monitored  for  30  minutes  before  having  the  FEV1 
measurement  repeated.  Subjects  who  had  not  recovered  their  FEV1  to  <  20%,  at  this  point  and 
provisos 1 and 2 (below) had been met, did not receive further study medication. 
1) A suitable bronchodilator was taken prior to administration of the mannitol/control;

2)  The  investigator  determined  that  the  fall  in  FEV1  was  bronchoconstriction  and  not  due  to  mucus 
plug or floppy airway collapse. This was to be tested by administering positive pressure via a PEP mask 
or Acapella device or similar and repeating the FEV 1 manoeuvres. 
The  applicant  concludes  that  the  MTT  appeared  to  be  a  safe  and  effective  screening  procedure  since 
subsequent  airway  reactivity  during  the  treatment  period  was  not  a  notable  event,  i.e.  there  were  2 
cases  of  bronchospasm  in  the  phase  III  trials,  both  in  the  Bronchitol  group,  that  lead  to  treatment 
discontinuation. However, bronchoconstriction related events (wheeze, chest discomfort and dyspnoea) 
had a similar incidence in both treatment groups (6.1% in patients on Bronchitol and 5.0% on control).  
The applicant has provided a table comparing the frequency of bronchospasm and bronchoconstriction 
related  events  of  Bronchitol  with  that  of  other  inhaled  agents  for  CF  (rhDNase,  TOBI,  aztreonam, 
tobramycin inhalation powder).  
Furthermore, the applicant argued that bronchospasm events are consistent with rates to be expected 
in  a  CF  population  and  arise  from  the  underlying  disease  rather  than  its  treatment.  According  to  the 
expert group bronchospasm is probably inherent to the treatment with inhaled mannitol and not to the 
disease; nevertheless, the panel concluded that this safety issue is manageable in clinical practice.  
Overall,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  view  that  the  data  provided  suggest  that  bronchoconstriction  can 
reasonably  be  prevented  with  the  use  of  the  mannitol  tolerance  test
  and  a  pre-treatment 
bronchodilator.  Whether  patients  with  pulmonary  exacerbations  are  at  increased  risk  of  this  adverse 
event  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out  but  the  overall  frequency  of  reporting  does  not  suggest  it.  In 
addition to the instructions given in section 4.2 in relation to the performance of the mannitol tolerance 
test, the use of a bronchodilator pre-treatment etc. prior the initiation of treatment with Bronchitol, the 
applicant  proposed  that  all  patients  should  be  formally  reviewed  after  approximately  six  weeks  of 
Bronchitol treatment to assess for signs and symptoms suggestive of drug induced bronchospasm. This 
precautionary measure in sectio
n 4.4 of the proposed SPC is endorsed.  
Bronchospasm  is  considered  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  Routine 
pharmacovigilance  for  monitoring  this  adverse  event  as  well  as  several  risk  minimisation  activities 
(statements  in  the  SPC,  educational  pack  -  healthcare  professional  leaflet)  are  proposed.  These 
measures cover the occurrence of such events during and after the initiation dose assessment, as well 
as  during  long-term  (chronic)  use  of  inhaled  mannitol.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considers  that  this 
identified risk is adequately addressed. 
With regard to haemoptysis, the overall incidence was similar in patients on Bron
chitol and on control 
(15.8%  and  14.6%  respectively)  in  the  pooled  main  studies.  However,  when  haemoptysis  was 
reported  as  a  stand  alone  AE  (outside  of  pulmonary  exacerbations)  the  incidence  was  higher  in  the 
Bronchitol group (6.1% versus 3.8%) suggesting that haemoptysis may be related to treatment rather 
than  the  disease.  Similar  percentages,  however,  are  shown  for  haemoptysis  related  to  exacerbations 
(9.7% for patients on Bronchitol and 10.9% in patients in the control group).  
To explore how haemoptysis in the Bronchitol and control group compares with that reported in other 
trials a table quoting the percentage of haemoptysis for different inhaled medicinal products commonly 
used  by  pat
ients  with  cystic  fibrosis  is  provided.  Comparisons  across  trials  may  provide  some  insight 
but  the  data  should  be  considered  with  caution  due  to  limitations  related  to  the  trial  population, 
disease severity and whether patients with previous antecedents of haemoptysis were permitted to be 
enrolled in these trials or not.  
Co-administered  inhaled  products  which  have  been  associated  with  reports  of  haemoptysis  include 
dornase alpha and hypertonic saline. Hypertonic saline was not permitted in studies DPM-CF-301 and 
DPM-CF-302.  The  Clinical  Study  Reports  provide  the  following  information:  in  study  DPM-CF-301 
haemoptysis was reported by 13 (13.5%) and 7 (10.4%) rhDNase users and 8 (9.9%) and 3 (5.9%) 
Bronchitol

non-users in the mannitol and control groups respectively. In study DPM-CF-302, 12 of the 13 subjects 
who  had  haemoptysis  recorded  as  an  adverse  event  in  the  mannitol  group  in  the  overall  safety 
population  were  rhDNase  users.  Therefore,  the  co-administration  of  dornase  alpha  increases  the 
incidence of haemoptysis (and also that of other adverse events such as cough).  
The  expert  group  was  of  the  opinion  that  haemoptysis  as  seen  in  the  main  studies  is  manageable  in 
clinical  practice.  Hence  it  is  considered  that  haemoptysis  needs  to  be  monitored  in  patients  receiving 
inhaled mannitol hence a precautionary statement is included in section 4.4 of the SPC. Haemoptysis is 
considered  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  Risk  Man
agement  Plan.  Routine  pharmacovigilance  for 
monitoring  this  adverse  event  as  well  as  several  risk  minimisation  activities  (statements  in  the  SPC, 
educational  pack  -  healthcare  professional  leaflet)  are  proposed.  The  above-mentioned  view  of  the 
experts  was  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  and  therefore  considered  that  thi
s  identified  risk  is  adequately 
addressed. 
To further optimise the benefit risk balance of the product, the applicant proposed the introduction of a 
stopping  rule  using  an  early  predi
ctor  of  long-term  response.  Based  on  an  evaluation  of  data  from 
s
tudies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-302 and the analysis of a variety of variables to serve as predictor, a 
stopping rule after a trial of therapy was proposed based on the change in  FEV1 after 6 weeks as this 
was  identified  as  highly  predictive  of  response  over  the  whole  6  months  of  double-blind  treatment. 
However,  further  to  considering  the  above-mentioned  proposal  from  the  applicant,  the  CHMP 
concluded that this stopping rule, which is based on post-hoc review of the data, cannot be considered 
as  a  valid  instrument  for  the  intended  purpose.  In  fact,  the  proposed  stopping  rule  was  considered 
more to reflect clinical practise rather than a product specific approach. The proposal was therefore not 
accepted.  Nevertheless,  the  two  main  safety  issues  –  namely  bronchoconstriction  and  haemoptysis  – 
can  be  addressed  adequately  through  the  risk  minimisation  activities  discussed  above,  and  without 
such stopping rule. 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  collection  of  post-marketing  safety  data  through  the  UK  CF  registry  is  an 
important additional pharmacovigilance activity. During the procedure, the applicant provided a study 
synopsis, which is part of the Risk Management Plan. 
The applicant is requested to submit periodic analysis of the CF study every 6 months for 3 years and 
annually for 2 years. The final report is expected in Q1 2018. 
In conclusion, further to the assessment of the applicant’s responses to the grounds for refusal and to 
the advice provided by the ad-hoc expert group, the CHMP concluded that the ground for refusal No. 3 
had been adequately addressed.

4.2.2.  Ad Hoc Expert Group meeting 
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an ad-
hoc  expert  meeting  on  3  October  2011  inviting  the  experts,  including  patients  representatives,  to 
provide  their  views  on  the  questions  posed  by  the  CHMP  in  relation  to  the  marketing  authorisation 
application,  taking  into  account  the  applicant’s  response  to  the  grounds  for  refusal.  The  above-
mentioned questions, together with the experts’ conclusions, are shown below: 
Experts’ input on the CHMP questions: 
Mechanism of action 
1.  The applicant considers that the mechanism of action is through the osmotic properties of mannitol 
increasing  airways  epithelial  lining  fluid,  and  thus  reducing  sputum  viscosity.  However,  an 
alternative  mechanism  which  could  contribute  to  sputum  clearance  is  through  increase  in  cough. 
Could the group comment? 
Experts’ response: It is the unanimous view of the experts that the predominant mechanism of action 
is  the  change  in  osmolarity  hence  the  hypothesis  of  hyperosmolarity  due  to  administration  of  inhaled 
mannitol  leading  to  reduced  sputum  viscosity  is  accepted.  With  regard  to  cough  there  is  a  need  to 
differentiate  between  productive  and  reactive  events.  Productive  cough  can  be  supportive  as  it  can 
contribute to sputum clearance. Reactive cough is solely a side effect. 
Efficacy 
2.  There  is  considerable  heterogeneity  between  and  within  studies  with  respect  to  benefit  on  lung 
function.  Study  DPM-CF-301  showed  a  statistically  significant  benefit  for  FEV1  (mL).  Study  DPM-
CF-302  did  not,  at  least  in  terms  of  the  primary  analysis.  Furthermore,  there  were  differences  in 
outcome  for  children,  adolescents,  and  adults.  From  a  clinical  point  of  view,  are  the  observed 
differences  surprising  or  expected  (e.g.  as  a  result  of  small  study  numbers  and  varied 
demographics)? If the heterogeneity is surprising, could the group say why? 
Experts’ response: There is heterogeneity between the subgroups in studies DPM-CF-301 and DPM-CF-
302 and depending on the type of analysis performed (absolute change in FEV1, relative % predicted, 
absolute  %  predicted).  However,  the  experts  noted  that  the  two  studies  were  not  powered  for  such 
subgroup  analysis  hence  this  heterogeneity  is  not  considered  of  relevance.  At  the  same  time,  the 
experts indicated that the studies should ideally have been stratified for such subgroup analysis since it 
is clinically plausible to detect differences.  
Furthermore  for  the  present  application,  the  group  did  not  consider  the  inconsistency  of  the  results 
seen in the different age groups as an issue since the claimed indication is restricted to adults only. In 
contrast,  the  experts  raised  concerns  about  the  fact  that  the  indication  proposed  by  the  applicant 
includes rhDNAse users and non-users even if the studies were not powered for the analysis of these 
two subgroups (see below). 
3.  In both pivotal Phase 3 studies the effect size for FEV 1 is small and of debatable clinical relevance. 
The  applicant  argues  that  any  improvement  in  lung  function  in  the  population  studied  is  clinically 
relevant. Please provide your opinion on the clinical relevance of the observed treatment effect for 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

each  population  (children,  adolescents  and  adults)  as  well  as  the  overall  population.  The  experts 
are also invited to discuss whether the rate of the decline in lung function in CF patients changed 
over  the  past  years  and  what  should  be  the  benchmark  for  a  product  impacting  on  sputum 
clearance (and not an antibiotic) like inhaled mannitol. 
Experts’ response: The effect size is considered small and based on the available data it is difficult to 
ascertain whether the treatment effect is clinically relevant. However, the experts also noted that even 
a small benefit can be of relevance in an individual patient given the deterioration of FEV1 inherent to 
the  disease  progression.  The  results  in  adolescents  were  considered  surprising  from  a  clinical 
perspective as this is the patient population where normally benefits are clearly demonstrated, which 
seems not to be the case across both pivotal studies. 
Regarding  benchmarking  the  experts  agreed  that  the  mechanisms  of  action  need  to  be  considered. 
Therefore, for inhaled mannitol a different approach should be taken compared to antibiotics. Acting on 
sputum clearance constitutes an additional approach but this cannot be compared versus antibiotics. In 
general the experts indicated that FEV 1 remains an important outcome parameter for studies in cystic 
fibrosis; from a patients’ perspective a relief in symptoms is very important. 
4.  The change in FEV 1 can be measured as the absolute change from baseline (in litres), the relative 
change (as percent change from baseline), or the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1. While 
the predefined primary endpoint in the two phase 3 pivotal studies is the change from baseline in 
FEV 1 (mL) in the response to the CHMP grounds for refusal the results are discussed as the relative 
change  in  FEV 1  predicted  of  normal.  While  using  FEV 1  (%  predicted)  is  endorsed  if  children  and 
adolescents  are considered it is believed that the  results to be taken into consideration are those 
corresponding  to  the  absolute  change  in  percent  predicted  FEV 1.  Could  the  experts  provide  their 
opinion on the above issue? 
Experts’  response:  The  assessment  based  on  relative  %  predicted  change  is  better  than  the  use  of 
absolute change in mL, the latter being not considered appropriate for the study. However, the experts 
also noted that the absolute % predicted change would have been even better. 
5.  The  applicant  claims  an  indication  for  the  use  either  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  rhDNase  or  in 
patients  intolerant  to,  or  inadequately  responsive  to,  rhDNase.  The  experts  are  invited  to  discuss 
whether from the clinical perspective the data in all or part of these subgroups related to rhDNase 
use are compelling. Additionally, while analysis by non-use/use  of rhDNase was predefined in the 
statistical  analysis  plans  of  studies  DMP-CF-301  and  302  there  was  an  assumption  that  all  non 
rhDNase users would reflect, and therefore be representative of the subpopulation of non rhDNase 
users who were “intolerant to, or inadequately responsive to rhDNase”. Could the experts provide 
their  opinion  on  what  would  constitute  an  adequate  definition  of  patients  intolerant  to,  or 
inadequately responsive to rhDNase? 
Experts’  response:  The  criteria  for  the  subgroups  related  to  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  not 
pre-specified for both studies, which renders the interpretation of the results very difficult. Moreover, 
studies  DMP-CF-301  and  DMP-CF-302  were  not  powered  to  make  such  stratifications.  From  a  clinical 
perspective, the proposed distinction between rhDNAse users and non-users appear difficult given that 
in  practice  the  (non-)use  of  rhDNAse  is  also  subject  to  patient’s  choice,  hence  the  definition  of 
rhDNAse non-users appears not appropriate. 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 110/126
 
 
 
 
As  mentioned  above,  a  general  issue  is  the  fact  that  the  studies  were  powered  only  for  the  overall 
population but the indication claims an effect on both rhDNAse users and non-users. It may be more 
appropriate not to specifically indicate in the indication the rhDNAse use. 
Safety 
6.  Bronchospasm  and  haemoptysis  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  Bronchitol  than  the  control 
treatment arms of the studies. The applicant argues that these events are consistent with rates to 
be  expected  in  a  CF  population  and  arise  from  the  underlying  disease  rather  than  its  treatment. 
Could the group provide their view? 
Experts’  response:  It  is  likely  that  bronchospasm  is  inherent  to  the  treatment  with  inhaled  mannitol 
and  not  to  the  disease.  Regardless  of  this,  the  safety  issues  observed  are  not  a  major  problem  from 
the  clinicians’  point  of  view.  It  was  noted  however  that  patients  might  be  concerned  by  an  event  of 
haemoptysis hence education is necessary. 
4.2.3.  Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant in writing and in the oral explanation and considered the views of the ad-hoc expert group.  
The applicant has conducted two six month, placebo controlled, phase III clinical trials of dry-powder 
inhaled mannitol in the treatment of cystic fibrosis involving a total of 600 patients. Studies DPM-CF-
301  and  DPM-CF-302  included  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  and  used  absolute  change  from 
baseline in lung function (FEV 1) as the primary efficacy variable. The studies show an effect of inhaled 
mannitol on lung function.   
The  uncertainties  regarding  the  methodology,  conduct  and  interpretation  of  the  two  pivotal  trials 
identified by the CHMP in the initial assessment were considered unacceptable in light of the conclusion 
that  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  treatment  effect  was  questionable.  During  the  re-examination 
procedure, the view of CHMP on the clinical relevance of the results was changed following consultation 
of  an  ad-hoc  expert  group  and  the  statistical  analyses  presented  by  the  applicant  were  accepted  as 
comprehensively addressing concerns over the uncertainty introduced because of missing data due to 
patient  withdrawal.  Regarding  the  issue  of  apparent  heterogeneity  in  the  trial  results,  the  applicant 
used a proper set of available statistical methodologies to explore these effects, ‘interaction tests’ and 
subgroup  analyses,  complemented  by  discussion  on  the  biological  plausibility  of  observing 
heterogenous  results.  These  arguments  were  accepted  by  the  CHMP  to  conclude  that  the  effect 
demonstrated  in  adults,  across  multiple  trials,  was  robust.  Taking  into  account  the  arguments 
presented  during  the  re-examination,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  studies  were  fit  for  purpose  and 
any  residual,  minor  methodological  concerns  were  of  no  consequence  to  demonstration  of  efficacy, 
assessment of safety or judgement on benefit-risk. 
The  predominant  mechanism  of  action  of  inhaled  mannitol  is  understood  to  be  the  change  in 
osmolarity,  particularly  the  hyperosmolarity  due  to  administration  of  inhaled  mannitol  leading  to 
reduced sputum viscosity. Productive cough can be supportive as it can contribute to sputum clearance 
and reactive cough is solely a side effect. These assumptions were confirmed by the expert group. 
In both main studies the effect size for FEV1 is small. Overall, the treatment with mannitol showed an 
improvement  of  approximately  2-3%  compared  with  the  control  group  over  26  weeks  in  terms  of 
percent  predicted  FEV 1.  The  clinical  relevance  of  such  a  marginal  effect  is  difficult  to  acertain. 
Therefore,  this  critical  question  was  posed  to  an  ad-hoc  expert  group.  Acknowledging  that  the  effect 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 111/126
 
 
 
size  is  small,  the  experts  nevertheless  agreed  unanimously  that  any  improvement  in  lung  function  in 
the  population  studied  can  be  of  relevance  in  an  individual  patient  given  the  deterioration  of  FEV1 
inherent to the disease progression. The above was subsequently endorsed by the CHMP. 
The CHMP had raised concerns regarding the observed heterogeneity between and within studies with 
respect  to  benefit  on  lung  function.  While  study  DPM-CF-301  showed  a  statistically  significant  benefit 
for FEV1 (mL), study DPM-CF-302 did not, at least in terms of the primary analysis. Furthermore, there 
were differences in outcome for children, adolescents, and adults. From the view of the expert group 
the  fact  that  the  study  was  not  stratified  for  the  various  sub-groups  is  a  limitation  since  certain 
variability is clinically plausible. The inconsistency across age groups was considered less of a concern. 
This  is  because  the  effect  size  in  the  adult  population  was  similar  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  and  was 
consistent  with  the  2  supportive  studies,  all  showing  a  similar  benefit  in  FEV 1  and  it  was  considered 
that  the  available  data  could  support  an  indication  in  adults  (for  both  Phase  III  studies  there  was  a 
statistically  significant  benefit in  the  primary  efficacy  variable, change  in  FEV1  from  baseline  to  study 
end, for Bronchitol compared to control treatment arms). This suggests that the benefit is real, and is 
unlikely to be an artefact of the subgroup analyses presented by age. In addition it is considered that 
the  effect  has  been  measured  with  acceptable  precision,  and  it  is  recognised  by  the  ad-hoc  expert 
group  cystic  fibrosis  experts  and  the  CHMP  to  be  small,  but  of  clinical  relevance.  Moreover,  the 
differential response according to patients’ age may be due to  clinical trials conducted in a refractory 
disease, in a relatively small number of patients. Taking the above information into account, the CHMP 
concluded that the studies are considered reliable. 
The  previously  claimed  indication  made  a  difference  between  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users.  This 
proposal  has  limitations  from  a  methodological  view  point  in  terms  of  definition  and  stratification,  as 
well as from the results. In clinical practice the definition of rhDNAse users appears not appropriate, as 
stated  by  the  experts.  The  applicant  changed  the  proposed  indication  to  add-on  therapy  to  best 
standard  of  care,  which  the  CHMP  considered  acceptable;  there  was  evidence  of  efficacy,  which  is 
regarded as being of clinical relevance, also in this subgroup although the effect size appeared smaller 
in the RhDNase subgroup. 
Both  Phase  III  studies  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  in  the  primary  efficacy  variable, 
change in FEV 1 from baseline to study end, for Bronchitol compared to the control treatment arms, for 
both rhDNase users and non-users. These data supersede the rather equivocal and difficult to interpret 
data from phase II studies given that the phase III studies are larger and better reflect clinical practice 
since  both  rhDNAse  users  and  non-users  were  included.  The  CHMP  conclusion  is  that  the  effect  in 
rhDNAse users and non-users is established, that clinical benefit in both rhDNAse users and non-users 
is positive and that benefits in both groups are considered clinically relevant.  
Children  and  adolescents  were  included  in  the  patient  population  in  the  two  main  studies.  However, 
based on the available data the efficacy in this paediatric population has not been demonstrated. From 
a  clinical  perspective  –  given  the  demographics  of  CF  patients  –  such  reliable  data  in  the  paediatric 
population  appears  paramount;  these  data  will  further  establish  the  benefit  risk  of  the  product.  The 
applicant is therefore requested by the CHMP as a condition to the marketing authorisation to conduct 
a  study  to  investigate  efficacy  and  safety  data  of  Bronchitol  in  children  and  adolescents  with  cystic 
fibrosis.  
With  regard  to  the  safety  of  Bronchitol,  two  main  safety  issues  have  been  identified  by  the  CHMP: 
bronchoconstriction and haemoptysis.  
Regarding the risk of bronchoconstriction, the CHMP is of the view that the data provided suggest that 
can  reasonably  be  prevented  with  the  use  of  the  mannitol  tolerance  test  and  a  pre-treatment 
bronchodilator.  Furthermore,  the  product  information  includes  an  additional  measure,  i.e.  that 
physicians  should  formally  review  patients  after  approximately  six  weeks  of  Bronchitol  treatment.  If 
Bronchitol 
CHMP assessment report

Page 112/126
 
 
symptoms  of  Bronchitol  induced  bronchospasm  are  presented  patients  should  undergo  the  mannitol 
tolerance  test  again;  if  this  test  is  positive  treatment  would  be  stopped.  This  would  further  minimise 
the  risk  of  bronchospasm.  According  to  the  expert  group  bronchospasm  is  probably  inherent  to  the 
treatment  with  inhaled  mannitol  and  not  to  the  disease;  nevertheless,  the  panel  concluded  that  this 
safety issue is manageable in clinical practice. Overall, bronchospasm is considered as an identified risk 
in the Risk Management Plan. Routine pharmacovigilance for monitoring this adverse event as well as 
several risk minimisation activities (statements in the SPC, educational pack - healthcare professional 
leaflet)  are  proposed.  These  measures  cover  the  occurrence  of  such  events  during  and  after  the 
initiation  dose  assessment,  as  well  as  during  long-term  (chronic)  use  of  inhaled  mannitol.  Therefore, 
the CHMP considers that this identified risk is adequately addressed. 
The  expert  group  concurred  that  haemoptysis  as  seen  in  the  main  studies  is  manageable  in  clinical 
practice. Hence it is considered that haemoptysis needs to be  monitored in patients receiving inhaled 
mannitol  hence  a  precautionary  statement  is  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC.  Haemoptysis  is 
considered  as  an  identified  risk  in  the  Risk  Management  Plan.  Routine  pharmacovigilance  for 
monitoring  this  adverse  event  as  well  as  several  risk  minimisation  activities  (statements  in  the  SPC, 
educational  pack  -  healthcare  professional  leaflet)  are  proposed.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considers  that 
this identified risk is adequately addressed. 
For additional post-marketing safety data collection, the applicant has proposed a study using the UK 
CF registry. This proposal is endorsed by the CHMP. 
At the time of the initial, negative CHMP opinion, there was a quality issue that was not fully addressed 
by  the  applicant.  The  issue  relates  to  the  preservative  efficacy  of  mannitol  and  its  potential  as  a 
microbiological  growth  substrate  in  an  in-use  context  for  cystic  fibrosis  pathogens  e.g.  Burkholdaria 
cepacia, Aspergillus fumigatus, etc. No data were provided in the MAA that explicitly address this issue. 
However, considering that the inhaler device is to be used for 7 days only and that clear instructions 
on how to clean the device are included in the package leaflet, this issue was not considered a major 
objection at the time of neither the first CHMP opinion nor the re-examination CHMP opinion, as it does 
not compromise change the positive benefit-risk conclusion. It is therefore not considered necessary to 
have the results from this study prior to authorisation.  
Nevertheless,  due  to  the  potential  risk  of  “Microbial  infection  via  a  contaminated  inhaler  device”  the 
preservative  efficacy  of  mannitol  should  be  monitored  through  additional  studies  and  data  collection 
through  risk management.  Therefore,  the  applicant  should investigate  whether  potentially  pathogenic 
species for CF patients could survive and whether they could replicate within the residual mannitol in 
the inhaler. The applicant should perform appropriate in-vitro microbiological studies reflecting 'in-use' 
conditions  to  assess  the  duration  of  survival  and  changes  in  numbers  of  organisms  to  help  evaluate 
the potential  risk  that  important  species  such  as  Burkholderia  spp.  and  Aspergillus  spp.  could  be 
transmitted to patients from the inhaler. 
In  conclusion,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  small  treatment  effect  observed  on  FEV1  is  considered 
established  given  the  deterioration  of  FEV 1  inherent  to  the  disease  progression  of  this  chronic 
condition. This is accepted for the use in adults in the dose of 400 mg bid on top of best standard of 
care. The safety issues are considered adequately addressed with the proposed pharmacovigilance and 
risk  minimisation  activities,  respectively,  and  are  manageable  in  clinical  practice.  The  benefit/risk 
conclusion for inhaled mannitol is therefore deemed positive.

degree  of  bronchoconstriction  that  occurs  following  sequential  administrations  of 
mannitol. 
o  How  to  perform  the  Bronchitol  initiation  dose  assessment  safely  and  how  long  to 
monitor the patient for.  
o  How to interpret the results of the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment as Pass, Fail or 
Incomplete. 
o  That therapeutic doses of Bronchitol should only be prescribed if the patient has passed 
the initiation dose assessment. 
o  The  need  of  pre-medication  by  a  bronchodilator  5-15  minutes  before  the  Bronchitol 
initiation dose assessment and before each therapeutic administration of Bronchitol. 
o  The need to check that the patient knows how to correctly use the bronchodilator. 
o  The  need  to  review  the  patient  after  approximately  six  weeks  to  assess  for  signs  and 
symptoms of bronchospasm. 
o  The  risk  of  bronchospasm  during  long  term  treatment  even  if  the  Bronchitol  initiation 
dose assessment was initially passed and the need to reiterate it in case of doubt. 
 
The risk of haemoptysis during treatment 
o  That  Bronchitol  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  a  history  of  significant 
haemoptysis (>60 ml) in the previous three months.  
o  The need for monitoring and when to withhold treatment. 
 
The potential risk of cough related sequelae during treatment 
o  The  need  to  train  the  patient  to  minimise  cough  during  administration  in  using  the 
correct inhalation technique. 
4.2.5.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  re-examined  its  initial 
opinion  and  in  its  final  opinion  concluded  by  majority  decision  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of 
Bronchitol  in  the  “treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  in  adults  aged  18  years  and  above  as  an  add-on 
therapy  to  best  standard  of  care  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the

The  educational  material  for  Healthcare  Professionals  should  be  a  leaflet  that  includes  information  on 
the following key elements: 
 
The risk of bronchospasm during treatment  
o  The need to perform the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment to identify patients who 
have bronchial hyperresponsiveness in response to inhaled mannitol by measuring the 
degree  of  bronchoconstriction  that  occurs  following  sequential  administrations  of 
mannitol. 
o  How  to  perform  the  Bronchitol  initiation  dose  assessment  safely  and  how  long  to 
monitor the patient for.  
o  How to interpret the results of the Bronchitol initiation dose assessment as Pass, Fail or 
Incomplete. 
o  That therapeutic doses of Bronchitol should only be prescribed if the patient has passed 
the initiation dose assessment. 
o  The  need  of  pre-medication  by  a  bronchodilator  5-15  minutes  before  the  Bronchitol 
initiation dose assessment and before each therapeutic administration of Bronchitol. 
o  The need to check that the patient knows how to correctly use the bronchodilator.

o  The  need  to  review  the  patient  after  approximately  six  weeks  to  assess  for  signs  and 
symptoms of bronchospasm. 
o  The  risk  of  bronchospasm  during  long  term  treatment  even  if  the  Bronchitol  initiation 
dose assessment was initially passed and the need to reiterate it in case of doubt. 
 
The risk of haemoptysis during treatment 
o  That  Bronchitol  has  not  been  studied  in  patients  with  a  history  of  significant 
haemoptysis (>60 ml) in the previous three months.  
o  The need for monitoring and when to withhold treatment. 
 
The potential risk of cough related sequelae during treatment 
o  The  need  to  train  the  patient  to  minimise  cough  during  administration  in  using  the 
correct inhalation technique.

Divergent Positions 
The  undersigned  members  of  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  CHMP’s  opinion  recommending  the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Bronchitol.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
The pivotal studies (301  and 302) are considered  not to provide adequate evidence of efficacy in the 
treatment  of  cystic  fibrosis  (CF)  in  adults  aged  18  years  and  above  as  an  add-on  therapy  to  best 
standard of care. In particular: 
- the clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed on FEV1 has not been established. 
- uncertainties remain in the magnitude of the effect following treatment with Bronchitol. In Study 301 
a  high  proportion  of  patient  withdrawals  complicates  inference.  The  pattern  of  estimated  treatment 
effects  is  inconsistent  within  each  study  across  important  subgroups  defined  by  age  (children, 
adolescents and adults) and the pattern of effects in each age group is inconsistent between studies.  
In light of the limited effects observed, these internal inconsistencies result in unacceptable uncertainty 
in the estimated treatment effect for the proposed population. 
The limited efficacy, of uncertain magnitude, is considered not to outweigh the observed and potential 
safety  concerns,  relating  primarily  to  bronchoconstriction  events  and  haemoptysis,  such  that  a 
favourable benefit-risk cannot be concluded.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Postpartum haemorrhage 
Physiological mechanisms are in place to limit postpartum blood loss after placental separation. In normal 
situations, haemostasis is initiated when uterine bleeding occurs from spiral arteries after placental 
separation, occurring after delivery of the baby. This is controlled by a combination of two mechanisms: 
•  Contractions of the myometrium, which compress the blood vessels supplying the placental bed and 
causes mechanical haemostasis. 
• 
Local haemostatic factors in the decidual cells of the endometrium (tissue factor, type-1 plasminogen 
activator inhibitor, systemic coagulation factors [e.g., platelets, increased circulating clotting 
factors]), will initiate endometrial haemostasis. 
The pathogenesis of most cases of post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) is uterine atony, i.e. failure of uterine 
contractions. The potential for massive haemorrhage due to failure of normal physiologic mechanisms at 
delivery is high, as in late pregnancy uterine artery blood flow is 500 to 700 mL/min and accounts for 
approximately 15 percent of cardiac output. 
In this application, the MAH proposes to add the following new indication: 
“Severe postpartum haemorrhage 
NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of severe postpartum haemorrhage.” 
The following indication has been agreed by CHMP: 
“Severe postpartum haemorrhage 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 7/120 
 
 
 
 
 
NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of severe postpartum haemorrhage when uterotonics are 
insufficient to achieve haemostasis.” 
The following separate posology is proposed for this new indication: 
Severe postpartum haemorrhage 
“Dose range and dose interval 
The recommended dose range for the treatment of bleeding is 60 – 90 µg per kg body weight 
administered by intravenous bolus injection. Peak coagulant activity can be expected at 10 minutes. A 
second dose can be administered based on clinical response of the individual patient.  
It is recommended that in case of insufficient haemostatic response, a second dose can be administered 
after 30 minutes.” 
Epidemiology  
The global incidences of PPH and severe PPH are estimated to be 6−11% and 1−3% of all births, 
respectively, but with substantial variations across regions. PPH continues to be the leading preventable 
cause of maternal illness and death globally. Worldwide, postpartum haemorrhage accounts for 8% of 
maternal deaths in developed regions of the world and 20% of maternal deaths in developing regions 
(WHO syst. Analys., Lancet 2014). 
Risk factors PPH 
A personal or family history of previous PPH, advanced age, obesity, high parity. Despite efforts to 
identify patients who are at increased risk for PPH, this life-threatening complication often occurs in 
women who have no identifiable risk factors. 
Biologic features 
Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is an obstetric emergency and the most common form of major 
obstetric haemorrhage. The traditional deﬁnition of primary PPH is the loss of 500 ml or more of blood 
from the genital tract within 24 hours of the birth of a baby. PPH can be minor (500–1000 ml) or major 
(more than 1000 ml). Major can be further subdivided into moderate (1001–2000 ml) and severe (more 
than 2000 ml). In women with lower body mass (e.g. less than 60 kg), a lower level of blood loss may 
already be clinically signiﬁcant (Guideline Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Causes of PPH 
The causes of PPH can be summarised by the four “T’s”: tone (uterine atony), trauma (lacerations or 
uterine rupture), tissue (abnormal or retained placenta or clots), and thrombin (pre-existing or acquired 
coagulopathy). The most common cause is uterine atony (accounting for approximately 70% of cases), 
followed by obstetrical lacerations (approximately 20%), retained placental tissue (approximately 10%), 
and clotting-factor deficiencies (<1%). (American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (AGOG) 
2017, Bienstock et al, NEJM 2021). 
Focal or diffuse atony  
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 8/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Uterine atony (i.e., lack of effective uterus contractions after delivery), is the most common cause of PPH 
(>80 percent of cases). Placental disorders (e.g. abnormal implantation of the placenta, placenta previa, 
abruptio placentae), retained products of conception, and uterine inversion may result in PPH because 
these inhibit effective uterine contraction. With diffuse atony, blood loss can be much greater than 
observed because a flaccid and dilated uterus may contain a significant amount of blood. With focal 
localised atony, the fundal region may be well contracted while the lower uterine segment is dilated 
(ballooning) and atonic. Although diffuse uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH, it is often 
responsive to administration of additional uterotonic drugs; thus, it is not the most common reason for 
massive transfusion at delivery.  
Trauma  
Trauma-related bleeding can be due to lacerations (including uterine rupture) or surgical incisions. 
Coagulopathy  
Coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction can contribute to PPH in women with an inherited or acquired 
bleeding disorder. Women with von Willebrand disease are especially at risk for PPH because von 
Willebrand factor levels, which typically increase during pregnancy, decline rapidly after delivery. Acute 
acquired coagulopathies can be caused by amniotic fluid embolism, placental abruption, preeclampsia 
with severe features, or HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets). 
Coagulopathy can also be a result of PPH when there is a severe reduction of clotting factors due to 
persistent heavy bleeding and haemodilution of the remaining clotting factors. 
Postpartum haemorrhage can lead to severe anaemia requiring blood transfusion, disseminated 
intravascular coagulopathy, hysterectomy, multisystem organ failure and death (Royal College of 
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG)). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The typical clinical signs and symptoms of hypovolemia due to PPH include hypotension and tachycardia. 
However, signs and symptoms of hypovolemia due to PPH may not appear until blood loss exceeds 25% 
of total blood volume (>1500 ml during late pregnancy). 
The traditional definition of postpartum hemorrhage is blood loss of more than 500 ml after a vaginal 
delivery or more than 1000 ml after a caesarean delivery. More recently, postpartum hemorrhage has 
been redefined as a cumulative blood loss of 1000 ml or more or blood loss associated with signs or 
symptoms of hypovolemia, irrespective of the route of delivery, see table 1 of main definitions PPH below 
(UptoDate2021).

Management 
Prophylactic measurements of PPH 
In women without risk factors for PPH and delivering vaginally, oxytocin is administered for prophylaxis of 
PPH in the third stage of labour (period after delivery of the infant up to delivery of the placenta). 
Treatment of PPH 
The treatment options for PPH relate to the underlying cause of haemorrhage.  
A combination of pharmacological, blood products, mechanical and surgical interventions are used 
presently; additionally, clinicians can consider the use of haemostatic agents. 
First line treatments 
Several medical products are approved for treatment of PPH due to uterine atony, of which oxytocin is 
considered first choice. Additional medicinal products include methergine, prostaglandin E2 agonists 
(dinoprost, sulprostone). Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 agonist, is used off-label, but has less efficacy 
than oxytocin. Additionally, also intravenous tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is used off-label, 
since the WOMAN trial (Shakur et al, Lancet), at the time of uterotonic treatment, has been included in 
many PPH management protocols. 
Second line therapies 
If bleeding persists after uterotonics, clinicians can use a combination of haemostatic agents (fibrinogen), 
transfusion of blood products (RBC, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate), fluid replacement and minimally 
invasive mechanical interventions (removal of retained placenta, intrauterine balloon tamponade, etc) 
(RCOG 2016). Non-invasive mechanical methods such as uterine compression and aortic compression 
may be applied concomitantly as needed.  
There are no firm criteria for the timing of initiation of blood product transfusion or haemostatic agents; 
consequently, the decision is based primarily on clinical, but also laboratory assessments including blood 
count and coagulation/haemostasis parameters. First-line invasive procedures in the form of uterine 
compression sutures are also considered appropriate if bleeding continues. In cases where uterine 
compression sutures are inadequate to control bleeding, selective arterial embolisation or uterine/iliac 
artery ligation may be performed as second-line interventions. In the event of uncontrolled haemorrhage 
that becomes life-threatening, emergency hysterectomy may be implemented as a life-saving measure. 
Various international and national guidelines have been developed for the management of PPH, based on 
collective experience and results from registry studies. Protocols for the management of PPH have 
developed over many years and there are variations across guidelines. A simplified overview is given of 
Novoseven II/116 -

the principles of treatment in recent guidelines, illustrated in Figure 1. The various treatments (including 
off-label use of NovoSeven) are often applied in parallel.

A plasma fibrinogen level of greater than 2 g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH (RCOG 2016). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
NovoSeven is an activated recombinant coagulation factor VII produced in baby hamster kidney cells by 
recombinant DNA technology. NovoSeven is structurally similar to human plasma factor VIIa except for a 
difference in glycosylation. NovoSeven was authorised in the EU in February 1996 and was approved in 
the US in March 1999. 
Mechanism of action 
The biological activity of NovoSeven is identical to plasma-derived FVIIa. The mechanism of action 
includes the binding of NovoSeven to exposed tissue factor (TF) at the site of vessel injury or tissue 
damage. This complex activates factor IX into factor IXa, and factor X into factor Xa, leading to the initial 
conversion of small amounts of prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin leads to the activation of platelets 
and factor V and VIII at the site of injury, and to the formation of the haemostatic plug by converting 
fibrinogen into fibrin. Pharmacological doses of NovoSeven activate factor X directly on the surface of 
activated platelets, localised to the site of injury, independent of tissue factor. This results in the 
conversion of prothrombin into large amounts of thrombin, thereby aiding coagulation and the arrest of 
bleeding. Accordingly, the pharmacodynamic effect of NovoSeven gives rise to an increased local 
formation of factor Xa, thrombin and fibrin. As the haemostatic effect of NovoSeven is localised to the site 
of vascular injury where tissue factor is exposed, and platelets are activated, NovoSeven does not induce 
systemic activation of coagulation. 
Current off-label use of NovoSeven in severe postpartum haemorrhage 
NovoSeven is not currently approved for use in severe PPH. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of 
evidence from off-label use, including patient registries and literature reports, describing the use of 
NovoSeven for the treatment of women with severe PPH. Reviews of published clinical studies and case 
reports suggest a beneficial role for NovoSeven in the management of severe PPH (Francini 2007, 2010). 
When used earlier in the treatment cascade, as shown by a RCT (trial 4816; included in this submission) 
where NovoSeven was used after uterotonics failure. (Lavigne-Lissalde, J Throm Haemost 2015). The 
control of bleeding may prevent progression to more invasive interventions such as uterine or iliac artery 
Novoseven II/116 -

Page 11/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression sutures and/or hysterectomy. 
Coagulopathy in PPH may arise due to dilutional coagulopathy (replacement of blood loss with crystalloids 
and colloids leading to dilution of coagulation factors and platelets), localised consumption, disseminated 
consumption and/or increased fibrinolysis. (Collins et al, J Thromb Haemost 2016). 
Thus, in addition to optimising obstetric management, correction of coagulopathy by replacement of 
coagulation factors and treatment with haemostatic drugs such as NovoSeven may improve outcomes in 
women with severe PPH. An analysis of individual patient data from women requiring massive transfusion 
for major obstetric haemorrhage, prospectively collected across population-based studies from Europe 
and Australia, found that NovoSeven use was variable, ranging from 8-16%. (McCall et al, PLoS One 
2021).  
Recommendations for the use of NovoSeven for treatment of severe PPH are included in some national 
guidelines based on professional consensus and results from registry studies. Those guidelines that 
describe off-label use of NovoSeven for management of severe PPH often recommend its use rather late 
in the treatment cascade, in order to avoid a hysterectomy or for life-saving situations. Recommendations 
in current guidelines also differ regarding dosage and number of doses of NovoSeven, but generally 
recommend 60 μg/kg, 90 μg/kg or 60−90 μg/kg and between 1 and 3 doses, see table 2 below.

NovoSeven is recommended to be 
used before and after hysterectomy 
only for an uncontrolled hemorrhage 
after the failure of conventional 
treatment and after having 
undertaken the correction of platelet 
levels and other hemostasis 
parameters. 
Used only in situations of 
uncontrolled blood loss and always 
in multidisciplinary consultation with 
anaesthesiologist/intensivist and 
haematologist 
The use of NovoSeven may be 
considered as a treatment for life-
threatening PPH but should not 
delay or be considered a substitute 
for a life-saving procedure, such as 
embolization or surgery, or transfer 
to a referral centre. 
Last-line nonsurgical intervention, if 
bleeding persists after 
correction of fibrinogen 
concentration and other 
physiological parameters (acidosis, 
hypocalcaemia, 
hypothermia, thrombocytopenia, 
and hyperfibrinolysis). 
Compassionate use. Before 
proceeding to hysterectomy, 
NovoSeven use must be considered

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
This application presents data on the clinical efficacy and safety of NovoSeven, when used for the 
treatment of women with severe PPH. Pivotal data are provided from 1 open-label RCT (trial 4816), 
published in 2015 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jth.12844. Together with observational 
evidence from 4 non-interventional studies. The non-interventional studies were based on patient-level 
data from a single hospital centre (study 4729), partly published by Colluci et al, 2018, national-level 
data from 3 countries (study 4733) and data from 2 registries covering 3 countries describing off-label 
use of NovoSeven (studies 4731 and 4732). Data are also provided from the Novo Nordisk safety 
database (Argus) and from a literature review of published clinical studies (including a meta-analysis) and 
case-reports of women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven, depicted in figure 2.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
As stated by the MAH, the randomised controlled trial was conducted in accordance with ICH GCP. The 2 
epidemiological studies and the 2 registries are stated to have been conducted in accordance with the 
Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices, and claimed to include elements of the EMA draft 
guideline on registry-based studies were retrospectively implemented when the draft guideline was 
published in September 2020. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the guideline “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for 
human use”, an environmental risk assessment is not required for substances like amino acids, peptides, 
proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Therefore, no ERA is required for this extension of indication for NovoSeven.  
2.2.2.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical phase 3 trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the authors.  
The 2 epidemiological studies and the 2 registries are stated to have been conducted in accordance with 
the Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices.

the propensity score matching (studies 4729 and 4733). 
b  A total of 51 women were exposed to NovoSeven in trial 4816: 42 women randomised to NovoSeven, 8 women in 
reference group that received NovoSeven on compassionate basis after the treating physician had decided to proceed 
with hysterectomy (after assessment of the primary endpoint) and 1 woman in reference group that received 
NovoSeven at randomisation in error.  
c  It was planned to also include data from France. However, these data could not be collected primarily due to the 
burden on hospital staff due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time. 
d  A total of 111 women with PPH were exposed to NovoSeven but this includes 24 women for whom severe PPH was 
not confirmed (blood loss <1500 mL or missing information on blood loss).

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of NovoSeven in women with severe postpartum haemorrhage has not been 
investigated. 
2.2.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The biological activity of NovoSeven is identical to plasma-derived FVIIa. The mechanism of action 
includes the binding of NovoSeven to exposed tissue factor. This complex activates factor IX into factor 
IXa, and factor X into factor Xa, leading to the initial conversion of small amounts of prothrombin into 
thrombin. Thrombin leads to the activation of platelets and factor V and VIII at the site of injury, and to 
the formation of the haemostatic plug by converting fibrinogen into fibrin. Pharmacological doses of 
NovoSeven activate factor X directly on the surface of activated platelets, localised to the site of injury, 
independent of tissue factor. This results in the conversion of prothrombin into large amounts of 
thrombin, thereby aiding coagulation and the arrest of bleeding. Accordingly, the pharmacodynamic effect 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 17/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of NovoSeven gives rise to an increased local formation of factor Xa, thrombin and fibrin. As the 
haemostatic effect of NovoSeven is localised to the site of vascular injury where tissue factor is exposed, 
and platelets are activated, NovoSeven does not induce systemic activation of coagulation. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic data have been submitted within the dossier. However, although the PD profile 
of NovoSeven in women with severe PPH has not been investigated, time to peak coagulant activity has 
been studied in healthy subjects and haemophilia patients. 
A PK/PD study in 22 healthy subjects (n=22), who received a single intravenous dose of NovoSeven (90 
μg/kg), showed maximal FVIIa activity at 5-10 minutes after dosing.  
Two PK/PD studies have evaluated the time to peak coagulant activity after NovoSeven administration in 
haemophilia patients. The first study, which evaluated single (270 μg/kg) and multiple (90 μg/kg × 3) 
intravenous doses of NovoSeven in haemophilia A and B patients (n=6), showed that time to clot 
formation, velocity of clot formation, maximum clot strength and peak thrombin generation were maximal 
at 10 minutes after NovoSeven administration (for both single and multiple doses). The second study in 
haemophilia A and B patients with inhibitors (n=13) showed that the time to peak coagulant activity 
occurred 10 minutes after a single intravenous injection (35-70 μg/kg) of NovoSeven.  
Based on the available PD data, the time to peak coagulant activity of NovoSeven is approximately 10 
minutes. 
The proposed 30 minute dose-interval was based on available PD data of NovoSeven, PPH guidelines 
recommending a second dose 15-30 minutes after the first dose of NovoSeven1,2 as well as the RCT 
where clinical response was evaluated within 30 minutes of NovoSeven administration. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of NovoSeven in women with severe postpartum haemorrhage has not been 
investigated. No new pharmacodynamic studies have been presented for this new indication. However, 
based on the available PD data in healthy volunteers and haemophilia patients, the time to peak 
coagulant activity of NovoSeven is approximately 10 minutes. 
Considering the different dose recommendations proposed for this indication, i.e. a different dose interval 
of 30 minutes in case of insufficient response, this information is reflected in section 4.2 and section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
The recommended dose range for the treatment of bleeding is 60 – 90 µg per kg body weight 
administered by intravenous bolus injection. Peak coagulant activity can be expected at 10 minutes. A 
second dose can be administered based on clinical response of the individual patient.  
It is recommended that in case of insufficient haemostatic response, a second dose can be administered 
after 30 minutes. 
The SmPC reflects that the Pharmacokinetics of NovoSeven in patients with severe postpartum 
haemorrhage have not been investigated.

2.2.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of NovoSeven in women with severe postpartum haemorrhage has not been 
investigated. No new pharmacodynamic studies have been presented for this new indication. However, 
based on the available PD data in healthy volunteers and haemophilia patients, the time to peak 
coagulant activity of NovoSeven is approximately 10 minutes, which is important considering the different 
dose recommendations proposed for this indication. 
Considering the different dose recommendations proposed for this indication, i.e. a different dose interval 
of 30 minutes in case of insufficient response, this information is reflected in section 4.2 and section 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
2.3.1.  Dose response study 
No formal studies were performed for the evaluation of dose-response in the currently applied indication.   
Regarding the dose selected in the pivotal randomised trial (study 4816), patients received one early 
single intravenous dose of 60 μg/kg rhuFVIIa. This rhuFVIIa dose was, according to literature data, the 
lowest dose with clinical effect in the setting of severe PPH and was chosen to reduce, as far as possible, 
the thrombotic risk associated with Novoseven. This dose is lower than the minimum dose of 90 μg/kg 
that is approved for NovoSeven in the currently authorised indications. 
2.3.2.  Main studies 
The data set to support the efficacy of the new indication consists of pivotal data provided from 1 open-
label RCT (trial 4816), together with supportive observational data from 4 non interventional studies. The 
data from the non-interventional studies were based on patient-level data from a single hospital centre 
(study 4729), national-level data from 3 countries (study 4733) and data from 2 registries covering 3 
countries describing off-label use of NovoSeven (studies 4731 and 4732). 
Study 4816 (RCT) 
As noted previously, Study 4816 (RCT) is the pivotal study to support the proposed indication.

Methods 
Study design 
This was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group trial in which women with severe PPH 
were randomised to treatment with NovoSeven or to no concurrent treatment (reference), following 
failure of sulprostone to control the bleeding. The RCT was open-label in design because, in the 
investigators’ opinion, the emergency conditions of obstetrical haemorrhage onsets did not allow for a 
double-blind design. The trial was conducted in accordance with ICH GCP. Both groups received standard 
of care treatment in accordance with the treatment guidelines in place at the time of the trial, see Figure 
4 below. 
Figure 4 
Trial design 
*No need for specific second-line therapy embolization or ligation (primary outcome). **Need for specific second-line 
therapies (compression sutures and/or uterine artery embolization and/or vascular ligations and/or hysterectomy) 
depending on availability (primary outcome). ***Hysterectomy. 
Study participants 
A total of 84 women with severe PPH were planned to be randomised 1:1 to treatment with NovoSeven 
(in addition to standard of care) or to reference therapy (standard of care alone), see sample size 
calculations below. The care of patients at each site was according to the local care guidelines for severe 
PPH. The enrolment criterion was sulprostone failure 1 h after the infusion onset (or before the end of this 
period). 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 20/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe primary PPH was defined as the loss of more than 1500 mL of blood within 24 h after birth. The 
contribution of any fluid used for washing was taken into account to prevent blood loss overestimation. 
According to French practice guidelines, first-line therapies for PPH included: fluid resuscitation, bladder 
catheterisation, manual removal of retained placenta, genital tract examination, uterine exploration, 
oxytocin (20–30 IU every 10–30 min) and finally one sulprostone infusion (500 μg within 1 h). 
Inclusion criteria/exclusion criteria 
These are reflected in the table 4. 
Table 4 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria - trial 4816 RCT 
Treatments 
After consent, the woman’s platelet count was assessed and if the count was ≤50 × 109/L, an APC 
transfusion (containing platelets and plasma) was ordered, according to the immediate life-threatening 
emergency procedure.  
One group received one early single intravenous dose of 60 μg/kg body weight rhuFVIIa (NovoSeven 
intervention arm) on top of standard care and the other group did not (standard care arm). This rhuFVIIa 
dose was, according to literature data, the lowest dose with clinical effect in the setting of severe PPH and 
was chosen to reduce, as far as possible, the thrombotic risk associated with this drug.  
The NovoSeven group received a single dose of approximately 60 μg/kg via slow IV injection (2mL/min) 
immediately after randomisation whereas women in the reference group did not receive NovoSeven at the 
time of randomisation. 
A compassionate use protocol was also established so that women in the reference group could receive 
NovoSeven after a decision had been made to perform a haemostatic hysterectomy (after assessment of 
the primary endpoint), if haemorrhage persisted and was not controlled by standard of care treatment. 
The NovoSeven dose was determined according to the woman’s ‘maternal’ bodyweight, calculated as her 
measured bodyweight at term (prior to delivery) minus 5 kg (or 7 kg in the case of twin pregnancies) to 
account for foetal-placental weight. To facilitate the emergency treatment with complete Novoseven 
packaging units (1.2, 2.4 and 4.8 mg vials), the theoretical rhuFVIIa dose was tabulated and adapted as 
described in Table 5. For example, a woman with calculated maternal weight of 60 kg would have a dose 
of 3.6 mg (administered as one 1.2-mg vial and one 2.4-mg vial); a woman with calculated maternal 
weight of 80 kg would have a dose of 4.8 mg (administered as one 4.8-mg vial). This table was not 
included in the protocol but was provided separately to the sites.

Table 5 
NovoSeven planned dose according to maternal weight 
Standard of care treatment: 
According to French practice guidelines, first-line therapies for PPH included: fluid resuscitation, bladder 
catheterization, manual removal of retained placenta, genital tract examination, uterine exploration, 
oxytocin (20–30 IU every 10–30 min) and finally one sulprostone infusion (500 μg within 1h). 
Definition of treatment success 
Haemorrhage volume was to be measured at 30 minutes to 1 hour after the start of the injection of 
NovoSeven for patients in the NovoSeven group and at the end of conventional treatment (after 
embolisation or vascular ligation) for the reference group. Bleeding was considered to have stopped (i.e. 
treatment success) if the estimated blood flow decreased to less than 50 mL per 10 min within the 30 min 
following randomization.  
Initiation invasive second line treatment 
At any time and in both arms, invasive second-line treatments were considered if bleeding was 
uncontrolled (blood flow higher than 50 mL per 10 min) or intractable (defined as PPH > 2500 mL, or 
blood flow > 500 mL per 30 min, or haemorrhagic shock refractory to standard care). 
Replacement therapy 
• 
• 
• 
Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were indicated if patient’s haemoglobin concentration was lower than 
8 g/dL.  
Platelet concentrates (PC) were administered when the platelet count was lower than 50 x 109/L. 
Fibrinogen concentrates were administered if the plasma fibrinogen concentration was lower than 1 
g/L.  
•  Haemostatic drugs are not recommended and not routinely used as first-line intervention in PPH: 
therefore, they were not used in this RCT.  
• 
The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) (0.5–1 g intravenously) was left to the attending physician’s 
discretion.  
•  Vascular volume expansion was achieved using 500 mL of crystalloid and 500 mL of colloid expander 
for the first litre of blood loss, and thereafter an infusion, mostly of gelatine, was administered to 
compensate for the subsequent blood loss (vol/vol).  
• 
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was infused by the attending anaesthetist, if clinically indicated. 
TXA and fibrinogen data were collected for the time interval before randomisation and in hourly intervals 
for 7 hours after randomisation.

Thrombosis prophylaxis following PPH 
Thromboprophylaxis initiated 6 h after the end of PPH (4000 IU enoxaparin, once a day). 
Removal of patients from therapy and assessment 
A woman could withdraw consent at will at any time. 
At any time and in both groups, invasive second-line treatments were to be considered if bleeding was 
uncontrolled (blood flow higher than 50 mL per 10 min) or intractable (defined as PPH >2500 mL, or 
blood flow >500 mL per 30 min, or haemorrhagic shock refractory to standard care). 
Duration of use 
Single dose trial.  
Follow-up: 
The initial observation period was 5 days due to the limited NovoSeven biological half-life (4–6 h). To 
identify symptomatic venous thromboembolism events up to 6 weeks after PPH, data from the initial 
medical records were extracted and patients had to fill in a simple questionnaire concerning the first 6 
weeks postpartum. 
Objectives 
Protocol primary objective (original protocol based primary objective) 
To evaluate the interest in using NovoSeven in the treatment of severe PPH unresponsive to conventional 
treatment and to define, if applicable, the number of interventional embolisation procedures, vascular 
ligations, hysterectomies and transfusions prevented due to the early use of NovoSeven. 
Protocol secondary objective 
The various investigative University Hospitals for this project are reference centres for their region. Nimes 
University Hospital participates in a network aimed at improving the care of pregnant women in Gard 
Department. The secondary objective of this study is to propose within the network a protocol for the 
proper use of recombinant rFVIIa in severe refractory postpartum haemorrhages. This agreement on the 
proper use of rFVIIa in PPH could be useful in organising patient transfers from peripheral hospitals to the 
University Hospital, before arterial embolisation or the surgical procedure (vascular ligation) and, if 
applicable, in avoiding a haemostatic hysterectomy. In effect, it could be posited that the early 
administration of rFVIIa at the peripheral centres might allow both a reduction in the number of transfers 
by reducing the frequency of failures of conventional treatment and the transfer of these patients in a 
better hemodynamic condition. 
Publication primary objective: 
Treatment success was defined as the absence of need for specific second-line therapies. Interventional 
haemostatic procedures included uterine compression sutures (B-Lynch surgical technique or its various 
modifications), ligation of the uterine or iliac arteries, uterine artery embolisation and peripartum 
hysterectomy and the Bakri Balloon.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint protocol: 
1. 
absolute reduction in need for specific second-line therapies (rate of embolisation and/or ligation) 
in the rFVIIa (Novoseven) group versus the reference group.  
2. 
relative reduction in the need for specific second-line therapies by number of subjects treated 
before reaching an embolisation or ligation. 
Primary endpoint publication:  
• 
Reduction in the need for specific second-line therapies (at least one ligation, suture, 
embolisation, intra-uterine balloon tamponade and/or hysterectomy). 
Secondary outcomes (publication only) 
• 
• 
number (percentage) of patients in each arm who received PRBCs, FFP units or PC;  
all replacement treatments (infusion of colloids/crystalloids, transfusions of blood components 
such as PRBCs, FFP and PC, and additional procoagulant treatments such as TXA, fibrinogen concentrates 
and aprotinin) were recorded. 
• 
Biological measures were collected before delivery and within the first 12 h after PPH. 
Sample size 
In the reference group, the expected rate of embolisation or surgical procedure, such as vascular ligature, 
is approximately 70% (Lédée et al, 2001, Mignon et al, 2004; Aledort et al, 2004; Tourné G et al, 2003). 
A 30% absolute decrease in the embolisation or vascular ligature rate is expected, that is, a 40% rate 
when rFVIIa is administered early after the conventional medical treatment. In order to show a 
statistically significant difference with a 5% bilateral risk and an 80% power, 42 patients were required in 
each group, that is, 84 patients for the study. The investigators chose to focus on an absolute reduction 
of only 30% based on their limited inclusion capacities. 
Randomisation 
A randomisation list stratified by site was prepared using the SAS software (Version 9.3, SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NJ, USA) by the Department of Medical Information at Nîmes University Hospital and 
accordingly, the eligible patients with severe PPH were randomised 1:1 to either of the 2 groups. As 
directed by the protocol, patients were randomised approximately 1 hour after sulprostone failure to 
control their bleeding. This was an open-label trial because in the investigators’ opinion, the emergency 
conditions of PPH onset did not allow for a double-blind therapeutic trial. 
Blinding (masking) 
The RCT was open-label in design because, in the investigators’ opinion, the emergency conditions of 
obstetrical haemorrhage onsets did not allow for a double-blind design. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis sets were defined in accordance with ICH E9: 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 24/120 
 
 
 
 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) – included all randomised patients. In exceptional cases patients from the 
FAS may be excluded. In such cases the exclusion was to be justified and documented. The patients in 
FAS would contribute to the evaluation ‘as randomised’. 
• 
Per protocol (PP) analysis set – included all patients in the full analysis that did not have any 
major protocol violations including the violation of entry criteria. 
The analysis for the primary endpoint, was done by calculating the relative risk (NovoSeven group versus 
reference group) with a 95% CI. The p-value was based on chi-square test for testing the equality of two 
proportions for NovoSeven and reference groups. If number of patients in either group was less than 5, 
this test was planned to be based on Fisher’s exact test. All the tests were two-sided and assessed at the 
5% significance level. 
Relative risk = r1 / r0, 95% CI for relative risk was calculated by the method of Wald. 
In addition, Risk difference (95% CI by the method of Wald), Relative reduction and Number of patients 
to be treated to prevent a studied endpoint event (NNT) were calculated. 
Risk difference (RD) = r0 – r1 
Relative reduction = 1 – Relative risk = (r0 - r1) / r0 = 1 – (r1/r0) 
NNT = 1/(absolute Risk difference) 
where r0 = proportion of reference group, r1 = proportion of NovoSeven group. 
All analyses were performed based on the FAS. In addition, the primary endpoint and supportive endpoint 
analyses were repeated with the PP analysis set as post hoc analyses. 
Quantitative variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation if the distribution is Gaussian. 
Otherwise, they will be expressed as median and 25th and 75th percentiles. Qualitative variables will be 
expressed as number and percentage. The qualitative endpoints of the two groups will be compared with 
the help of a Chi2 test or a Fisher’s exact test if the conditions for Chi2 are not met. The quantitative 
endpoints of the two groups will be compared by a Student’s test or a Kruskall-Wallis test if the conditions 
for applying Student’s test are not met. In the event of an imbalance between the two groups in one or 
more prognostic factors considered significant, an unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis 
will be performed to explain the embolization or ligation rate (primary endpoint). 
The 1st species risk will be set at 5% for all analyses. No interim analysis is planned for the study.  
Analysis Primary (and secondary) endpoints publication: 
Quantitative data are reported as medians with lower quartile (Q25%) and upper quartile (Q75%) values. 
Qualitative variables are reported as numbers and percentages. All analyses were performed based on 
the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The primary (and secondary outcomes) were compared between 
arms by estimating the relative risk (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with a 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI), providing a P-value from the associated Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. The 
existence of treatment by centre interactions for the primary outcome was assessed using the Breslow-
Day test, first applied to the eight centres and then only to the five centres that enrolled at least five 
patients. Among all the presented analyses, only the treatment by centre interaction and the effect of the 
delivery mode on the primary outcome were ‘post hoc’ analyses. All tests were two sided and assessed at 
the 5% significance level.

Recruitment 
A total of 84 women with severe PPH were included in this trial; 42 patients were randomised to the 
NovoSeven group and 42 patients to the reference group. All women were considered to have completed 
the trial, that is, completed treatment for PPH.  
Sixty patients were included 1 h after sulprostone infusion. Among the 24 remaining patients, the median 
randomization time (lower quartile–upper quartile) was 40 min (30–45 min) for the intervention arm and 
30 min (30–30 min) for the standard care arm (P = 0.93).

Conduct of the study 
Two important protocol deviations were identified (post hoc) from the available monitoring reports. They 
were as follows: 
• 
One woman in the reference group did not meet the inclusion criteria (she had already responded 
to sulprostone). 
• 
One woman in the NovoSeven group had ligation performed prior to NovoSeven injection. 
In addition, one woman was randomised to the reference group, but received NovoSeven due to an error 
in reading the randomisation envelope. 
Baseline data 
All 42 women in the NovoSeven group were exposed to a single dose of NovoSeven. In addition, 8 
women in the reference group received a single dose of NovoSeven after the treating physician had 
decided to proceed with hysterectomy, under the compassionate use protocol. One woman randomised to 
the reference group received NovoSeven in error. Therefore, a total of 51 women were exposed to 
NovoSeven. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics of women with severe PPH enrolled in the trial are presented in 
Table 6. The distribution of women across age classes was similar between treatment groups with half of 
the patients being in the age range of 31-40 years. Proportion of women above 35 years was numerically 
higher in the NovoSeven group compared to the reference group (40.5% versus 26.2%). The median 
maternal weight was also comparable between the two groups. 
Approximately, 50% of women had a caesarean delivery with 54.8% (23/42 women) in the NovoSeven 
group and 47.6% (20/42 women) in the reference group. Seven women (16.7%) in each group had twin 
births. 
A single cause of PPH was reported for majority of women, with more women in the NovoSeven group 
having multiple causes of PPH than in the reference group (31.0% versus 11.9%). Overall, uterine atony 
was recorded as the most common cause of PPH (89.3%) followed by AIP (16.7%).

Fibrinogen 
The median fibrinogen levels at T0 were above the threshold of 2 g/L in both the NovoSeven (2.4 g/L) 
and reference group (3.2 g/L). 
Details on tranexamic acid and fibrinogen use before and after randomisation 
The time intervals before randomisation and during the first hour after randomisation are summarised in 
Table 7 below, since these data represent the concomitant use that potentially influences the efficacy of 
NovoSeven. For these two time intervals, data were available for approximately half the women which 
indicate either a specific dose or no dose.

Exposure 
All 42 women in the NovoSeven group were exposed to a single dose of NovoSeven. In addition, 8 
women in the reference group received a single dose of NovoSeven after the treating physician had 
decided to proceed with hysterectomy, under the compassionate use protocol. One woman randomised to 
the reference group received NovoSeven in error. Therefore, a total of 51 women were exposed to 
NovoSeven. 
Dosing 
The median dose of NovoSeven was 57.6 μg/kg, with a range of 32 to 73 μg/kg, with most women 
receiving a dose between 55 and 65 μg/kg. The median dose of NovoSeven was similar between 
subgroups by concomitant use of tranexamic acid (TXA) and/or fibrinogen at T0, concomitant use of TXA 
and/or fibrinogen from T1H to T7H, fibrinogen level at T0 and PPH cause. 
Planned doses by maternal weight are presented in Table 5 above. One woman received a dose higher 
than the planned dose (a woman with maternal weight of 66 kg received NovoSeven 4.8 mg, equating to 
73 μg/kg). Ten women received doses lower than the planned dose for their maternal weight; actual dose 
for these women ranged between 32 and 60 μg/kg.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results 
An overview of primary efficacy endpoints is presented in table 9 below. 
•  Protocol primary efficacy endpoint of at least one embolisation and/or ligation: 
In the analysis of the primary endpoint, fewer women, 50% (21/42) in the NovoSeven group had at 
least one embolisation and/or ligation procedure compared to women in the standard care arm, 83% 
(35/42), with a statistically significant 40% relative reduction in risk compared to the reference group 
(21 vs 35 women; RR = 0.60 (95% CI, 0.43-0.84), p=0.0012). 
The mean number of patients who needed to be treated (NNT) with rhu-FVIIa (number needed to 
treat, NNT) to avoid one composite outcome was 3. 
•  Publication primary efficacy endpoint of at least one ligation, suture, embolisation, balloon 
and/or hysterectomy: 
In the analysis of the publication primary endpoint, fewer women, 52% (22/42) in the NovoSeven 
group had at least one embolisation, ligation, suture, balloon and/or hysterectomy procedure 
compared to women in the standard care arm, 93% (39/42), with a statistically significant 43.6% 
Novoseven II/116 -

relative reduction in risk compared to the reference group (22 vs 39 women; p<0.001), RR = 0.56; 
(95% CI, 0.42–0.76).  
The mean number of patients who needed to be treated with rhu-FVIIa (number needed to treat, 
NNT) to avoid one composite outcome was 2.6. 
Outcome per individual type of invasive procedure (publication) 
Only the number of arterial embolisation procedures was significantly lower in the intervention arm than 
in the standard care arm. The percentage of peripartum hysterectomies was 7% (n = 3) in the 
intervention arm and 19% (n = 8) in the standard care arm (RR = 0.375 (0.107–1.32); P = 0.11). 
Compassionate treatment with NovoSeven (publication information) 
In the standard care arm, salvage peripartum hysterectomy was considered after vascular 
embolization or ligation failure. Therefore, eight of the 42 patients received late rhuFVIIa as a 
compassionate treatment in an attempt to avoid surgery. Peripartum hysterectomy was avoided in two 
cases.

Outcome by delivery mode, i.e. vaginal delivery and caesarean section (publication endpoint) 
The primary efficacy outcome measures were not affected by the delivery mode (absolute risk difference 
= 44% for vaginal delivery and 39% for Caesarean section). The significantly lower frequency of 
interventional haemostatic procedures in the intervention arm was confirmed also when these patients 
were classified based on the delivery mode (vaginal delivery, RR = 0.52, 95% CI, 0.32–0.81; Caesarean 
section, RR = 0.6, 95% CI, 0.41–0.86). 
Relationship between rhuFVIIa dose and efficacy (publication endpoint) 
The median rhuFVIIa dose infused into patients was 57.6 μg/kg (inter-quartile range, 52.9–60.8; range, 
31.6–72.7 μg/kg). The infused rhuFVIIa dose was based on the conversion of the theoretical weight-
adjusted dose into discrete total doses corresponding to the use of a number of complete product vials. 
Eight patients were categorized as ‘under-treated’ and one as ‘over-treated’. The primary efficacy 
outcomes were not different between ‘over-treated or appropriately treated’ women (n = 34) and ‘under-
treated’ women (n = 8) (P = 0.45, Fisher's exact test). The median value of the difference between 
theoretical rhuFVIIa dose and infused rhuFVIIa dose was −1.64 μg/kg for women who required some 
form of second-line intervention, and −3.2 μg/kg for successfully treated women who recovered without 
any second-line intervention (P = 0.55). 
Time to initiation of a second-line treatment (publication endpoint) 
The time to initiation of a second-line treatment was not different between groups: the median delay was 
30 min (95% CI, 15–80 min) for the 39 patients in the standard care arm and also 30 min (95% CI, 22 
min: 60 min; P = 0.93) for the 22 patients in the intervention arm who did not respond to rhuFVIIa. 
Blood loss collection  
In deviation from the trial protocol, blood loss collection failed to be measured. The use of a plastic 
collector bag to quantify postpartum blood loss was encouraged; the devices were provided to the 
different healthcare teams, but were only marginally used, thus rendering the systematic measurement of 
blood loss volumes impossible. 
Requirement of blood products 
To determine the proportion of patients in the two arms who required blood products, the transfusion 
needs were assessed before and after randomization. Before randomization, the absolute numbers of 
transfused PRBCs and FFP were (median value [Q25–Q75%] values): 0 [0–1] vs. 0 [0–2] in the standard 
care arm and 0 [0–0] vs. 0 [0–0] in the intervention group. The percentages of patients who required 
PRBCs, FFP and PC were 26% vs. 38% (P = 0.24), 14% vs. 14% and 4.8% vs. 2.4% in the standard care 
and in the intervention arm, respectively. After randomization, the absolute numbers of transfused PRBCs 
and FFPs were (median value [Q25–Q75%] values): 2 [0–4] vs. 2 [0–3] and 0 [0–4] vs. 0 [0–3] in the 
standard care and intervention arm, respectively.  
The percentages of women requiring PRBCs, FFP and PC were 67% vs. 60%, 48% vs. 45% and 31% vs. 
26%, respectively. No between-group difference was thus observed in the absolute numbers of 
administered blood products.

intervention arm had received fibrinogen concentrates; the percentages were identical for TXA. Aprotinin 
was administered to one patient only in each arm.  
After T0, 67% (10/24) of the evaluable patients in the standard care arm and 48% (10/21) of those in 
the intervention arm received fibrinogen concentrates; 47% (7/15) of women in the standard care arm 
and 44% (8/18) in the intervention arm received TXA. Aprotinin was administered to 14% (2/14) of 
women in the standard care arm and to 6% (1/16) of patients in the intervention arm. 
•  Haemoglobin concentration (publication endpoint) 
The fall in haemoglobin (Hb) concentration between T0 and T30 was significantly different between 
groups (P = 0.0377), with a median decrease of −0.2 g/dL (IQ = [−1, 1.8]) in the intervention arm and 
of −0.9 g/dL (IQ = [−2.3, 0.1]) in the standard care arm. The Hb concentration fall was thereafter 
categorized as higher than 2 g/dL vs. all the other values. The highest haemoglobin falls (> 2 g/dL) were 
detected in 15% (5/33) of patients in the intervention group and in 30% (8/27) in the standard care arm 
(P = 0.18).

Summary of Efficacy for trial 4816 (RCT) 
Title: Chronological place of the administration of recombinant activated factor VII in maternal 
salvage in severe postpartum haemorrhage: before or after invasive second-line therapies 
(embolisation, vascular ligation and haemostatic hysterectomy) 
Study identifier 
NCT00370877 
Design 
A therapeutic, prospective, controlled, multi-centre (Nimes, 
Nice, Cochin, Clamart, Montpellier and Lille and Geneva University Centres) 
multidisciplinary (obstetricians, anaesthetists and haematologists / 
haemostasis specialists), randomized trial conducted over a 4-year period. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the interest in using NovoSeven in the 
treatment of severe PPH unresponsive to conventional treatment and to 
define, if applicable, the number of interventional embolisation 
 procedures, vascular ligations, hysterectomies and transfusions prevented 
due to the early use of NovoSeven.

There was no run-in phase, but time 
between the administration of 
sulprostone and enrolment into the trial 
was to be 1 hour. 
There was no extension phase 
Follow-up was 5 days based on NovoSeven 
half-life (4–6 h). To identify symptomatic 
VTE up to 6 weeks after PPH, data from 
initial medical records were extracted and 
patients had to fill in a questionnaire 
concerning the first 6 weeks postpartum. 
Hypothesis 
Exploratory: hypothesis of relatively early use of NovoSeven may, in some 
patients, avoid having recourse to invasive haemostasis procedures, save on 
transfusions or avoid transferring the patient to a referral centre in a 
hemodynamically unstable condition in order to improve the known mortality 
related to patient transfer.

Data from four non-interventional studies were collected from information of routine clinical practice to 
provide supportive data to the pivotal evidence, trial 4816 (RCT). Two non-interventional studies, study 
4729 (Bern) and study 4733 (PPH consortium), included both women treated with NovoSeven and women 
not treated with NovoSeven; whilst the other two non-interventional studies (registries), study 
4731(UniSeven) and study 4732 (ANZHR), only included women treated with NovoSeven. The results of 
these studies are summarised below. 
• 
Study 4729 (Bern) 
Title: Clinical outcomes of NovoSeven treatment in severe postpartum haemorrhage – a 
retrospective single-centre cohort study at the University Hospital of Bern. 
Study design and methodology 
The current study was a single-centre, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study of women with 
severe PPH who were treated with NovoSeven or other standard of care during the period of January 
2006 to April 2016 at Bern University Hospital, Switzerland. The present study included data of 165 
women from 4 cohorts of women with severe PPH: historical cohort 1 (2006 to 2007), historical cohort 2 
(2008 to 2010), study cohort (2010 to 2012) and new cohort (2013 to 2016). The treatment of sPPH in 
the 4 cohorts differed in study periods and PPH management protocols as shown Table 11, and described 
below:

•  Historical cohort 1: women were treated according to an in-house guideline including use of 
uterotonics, fluid management, red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and/or fibrinogen 
and platelet transfusion according to current practice. If massive bleeding persisted, women were to 
receive NovoSeven at a dose of 60 μg/kg body weight and a second dose could be given if blood loss 
was still ongoing. 
•  Historical cohort 2: no specific treatment guidelines were followed. 
•  Study cohort: women were treated with a standardised management protocol which included early 
administration of uterotonics, fluids, and tranexamic acid (TXA). If bleeding persisted, an emergency 
package containing RBC, FFP, platelets, fibrinogen and NovoSeven (60 μg/kg body weight) was 
administered. 
•  New cohort: women were treated with a similar standardised management protocol to ‘study cohort’, 
except that the dose of NovoSeven was increased to 90 μg/kg body weight.

Setting 
The study was performed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital and 
University of Bern, Switzerland. The study is based on data already recorded in historical medical records. 
Data collection (extraction of data from historical medical records) was performed during the period 29 
June 2020 to 13 January 2021. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
• 
To compare, in a propensity score (PS) matched population of women with severe PPH, the 
occurrence of any invasive procedure after first treatment with NovoSeven with the occurrence of any 
invasive procedure without treatment with NovoSeven. Invasive procedures were defined as uterine 
or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression sutures or 
hysterectomy. 
Estimand 
The estimand addressed the relative effect of NovoSeven compared to PS matched controls on the 
occurrence of invasive procedures in women with severe PPH. The estimand was defined as follows: 
A.  The treatment conditions were NovoSeven versus PS matched controls. 
B.  The treatment effect was estimated for women with severe PPH defined by the inclusion criteria in 
the 4 cohorts exposed to NovoSeven and their matched controls. 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 35/120 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  The treatment effect was assessed by the occurrence of invasive procedures within 20 minutes to 
24 hours following time0 (where time0 was equal to the period from onset of severe PPH to time 
of first administration of NovoSeven for the woman for whom she was a matched control). 
D.  Intercurrent events were handled by a hypothetical strategy or a treatment policy strategy (see 
below). 
E.  The treatment effect was quantified by the conditional odds ratio. 
Handling of intercurrent events for the hypothetical estimand 
Secondary objectives 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To compare frequency of thromboembolic events (TEs) in women with an event of severe PPH treated 
with NovoSeven versus women with an event of severe PPH not treated with NovoSeven. 
To compare the relative reduction in blood transfusions in women with an event of severe PPH treated 
with NovoSeven versus women with an event of severe PPH not treated with NovoSeven. 
To compare the relative reduction in blood loss in women with an event of severe PPH treated with 
NovoSeven versus women with an event of severe PPH not treated with NovoSeven. 
To compare the incidence of hysterectomy in women with an event of severe PPH treated with 
NovoSeven to the incidence of hysterectomy in women with an event of severe PPH not treated with 
NovoSeven.

Time0 was defined as time of first administration of NovoSeven. It occurred ‘x’ minutes after onset of 
severe PPH. For matched controls: time0 was derived from the matching process. It was equal to the 
period from onset of severe PPH to time of first administration of NovoSeven for the patient for whom she 
was a matched control. 
Diagnosis, Inclusion/exclusion  criteria 
Inclusion criteria: 
1.  Severe PPH, defined as continuous bleeding of at least 1500 mL within 24 hours after delivery. 
2.  Inclusion in one of the 4 cohorts (historical cohort 1, historical cohort 2, study cohort and new 
cohort). 
Exclusion criteria 
None. 
Sample size 
There was no formal power calculation and the study included all women at the study site who were 
eligible according to the inclusion criteria.  
Statistical analyses 
Analysis sets 
• 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS): defined as all women who met the inclusion criteria for the study, i.e., all 
women with severe PPH (a subpopulation in the FAS is used for post-hoc analysis of a common 
project endpoint was analysed in the FAS, discussed in section analysis across studies). 
Propensity score (PS) analysis set: defined as all women in the FAS who were matched in the 
propensity scoring. 
•  Supplementary PS analysis set: defined as the PS analysis set excluding matched controls who were 
exposed to NovoSeven after time0. 
The PS analysis was a pre-specified analyse as per SAP. For the PS analysis set it was possible that a 
woman could be selected as a control before the timepoint when she was exposed to NovoSeven. In such 
a case, the woman could be counted in both groups, once as a control and later as an exposed case, both 
with separate values for time0. In the FAS the two groups were mutually exclusive. 
Propensity score matching 
This non-interventional study 4729 (Bern) (and 4733 - PPH consortium) collected patient level 
information from hospital records both on women exposed to NovoSeven and women not exposed to 
NovoSeven. In an attempt to enhance the comparability between the two groups, subgroups were 
selected from women who were exposed and not exposed to NovoSeven via time dependent propensity 
score matching. The purpose of propensity score matching was to counteract the natural imbalance 
(confounding by indication) present between women exposed and not exposed to NovoSeven in the FAS 
from these real world data sources. The propensity score reflected the estimated probability of being 
exposed to NovoSeven at a given point in time during the course of severe PPH. The propensity score 
matching process selected two subgroups of women that had a comparable course of PPH up to 
exposure/matching time based on the recorded data. In this way exposed women and their controls were 
comparable because of similar development of severe PPH at the same (specific) time0 based on recorded 
data.  
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 37/120 
 
 
 
 
 
For NovoSeven exposed women, time0 was defined as time of first administration of NovoSeven, 
occurring x minutes after onset of severe PPH. For matched controls, time0 was equal to the period from 
onset of severe PPH to time of first administration of NovoSeven for the woman for whom she was a 
matched control. Both studies used the same approach for the propensity score matching process, 
adapted to the amount and type of data available within each study.  
Characteristics that could be included as covariates are (not an exhausted list): gestational age, multiple 
pregnancy, cause of PPH, volume of blood loss at time of intervention, and haemostatic drugs used (other 
than NovoSeven) that had already been applied at the time of intervention. A matching algorithm for the 
propensity score will be used to match women with an event of sPPH exposed to NovoSeven with women 
with an event of sPPH that are not at that timepoint. Women will be censored when they have been 
hysterectomised, died, or stopped having PPH. Further details of the propensity score model will be 
defined in the SAP. 
Matching will be done within patients with the same delivery mode with up to 1:4 matching with a calliper 
of 0.1. If this is not possible a calliper of 0.2 will be used instead. The criteria for switching to 0.2 will be 
described in the SAP. 
A PS for every woman with severe PPH was estimated from time of start/diagnosis of severe PPH by a 
Cox proportional hazard regression model with NovoSeven as the dependent variable. A hazard was 
calculated for each woman at risk for each minute following onset of severe PPH. Covariates associated 
with initiation of NovoSeven administration were included in the model to calculate PS. 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary endpoint (invasive procedures) was compared between women who were exposed to 
NovoSeven and matched controls in the PS analysis set, using an exact conditional logistic regression to 
calculate the odds ratio, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), with conditional meaning that the pairing of 
patients based on the PS matching was taken into account. The test assessing the odds ratio was two-
sided and assessed at the 5% significance level. 
Secondary endpoint analysis 
To address the secondary objectives, the comparisons were made using the matched women from the PS 
matching described above.

a: After database lock for PS matching, 2 women that were originally included as eligible for matching as exposed were no longer eligible for 
matching and 1 woman became eligible for matching as exposed. 
b: One matched control had hysterectomy in the conjoint period and was excluded from the primary analysis. Therefore 42 matched controls were 
included in the primary analysis. 
Patient characteristics 
For the PS analysis set, women were matched based on delivery type, therefore, the percentage of 
women with delivery by caesarean section and vaginal delivery was identical between NovoSeven and 
matched controls (caesarean section was 88.9% for both groups). The two groups of women were 
broadly similar with regard to other patient characteristics except there were some imbalances in the 
proportions of women with obesity (33.3% vs 19.0% for NovoSeven and matched controls, respectively), 
singleton birth (72.2% vs 91.2% for NovoSeven and matched controls, respectively), 
preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP (11.1% vs 4.2% for NovoSeven and matched controls, respectively) and 
pre-existing coagulation disorder (11.1% vs 0% for NovoSeven and matched controls, respectively). 
Regarding primary cause of PPH, there were some imbalances in the PS analysis set in the proportions of 
women with uterine atony (72.2% vs 46.8% for NovoSeven and matched controls, respectively). 
Proportions of women with AIP were similar for NovoSeven and matched controls (22.2% vs 27.8%, 
respectively). The numbers of women with trauma or other causes of PPH were small in both groups. No 
woman in the PS analysis set had placental retention as primary cause of PPH. 
NovoSeven dose in study 4729 
In the Propensity Score analysis set, 17 (94.4%) women who were treated with NovoSeven received one 
dose and 1 (5.6%) woman received two doses. Median first and total doses of NovoSeven were both 65 
μg/kg (IQR 62 to 74 μg/kg).

For the 18 women exposed to NovoSeven in the PS analysis set, the first dose was <60 μg/kg for 2 
(11.1%) women and 60-90 μg/kg for 16 (88.9%) women; no woman in the PS analysis set received a 
first dose >90 μg/kg.

Results primary endpoint PS analysis 
• 
• 
In the PS analysis set, the occurrence of any invasive procedure in the period from 20 minutes to 24 
hours following time0 was 16.7% (3/18) for NovoSeven exposed women compared to 31.5% 
(5.6/17.8) for matched controls, among women who were at risk of further invasive procedures (see 
Section 1.5 for definition of population). The odds ratio of any invasive procedure was 0.33, 
numerically favouring NovoSeven, though this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.2691).  
The odds ratio of hysterectomy from 20 minutes to 24 hours after time0 was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.05 to 
3.03; p=0.6815) in women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven compared to matched controls. 
Table 14 
Invasive procedures in the period from 20 minutes to 24 hours after time0 – 
statistical analysis – PS analysis set 
Supplementary analyses also supported the findings of the primary analysis. In the analysis in which 
women selected as matched controls who were later exposed to NovoSeven were excluded (7 family 
clusters excluded), the adjusted odds ratio was 0.22a (95% CI: 0.00 to 1.30; p=0.1667). 
Control of bleeding 
In the PS analysis set, the mean rates of transfusion (units per hour) for RBC and FFP were lower after 
time0 than before or at time0 for both NovoSeven exposed women and matched controls. The reductions 
in rates (rate ratios, i.e., after time0/before or at time0) were numerically greater for NovoSeven 
exposed women compared to matched controls for RBC (NovoSeven exposed: 0.19; matched controls: 
0.33) and FFP (NovoSeven exposed: 0.21; matched controls: 0.35) transfusions, with a relative rate ratio 
after time0 of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.29, 1.17; p=0.1253) and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.32; p=0.2044), 
respectively. 
In the PS analysis set, the duration of bleeding (from onset of severe PPH to stop of severe PPH) was 
numerically shorter for NovoSeven exposed women (median: 167.5 minutes; IQR: 101.0, 235.0 minutes) 
than matched controls (median: 250.0 minutes; IQR: 138.0, 673.5 minutes). However, the duration of 
bleeding in the FAS was numerically longer for the NovoSeven group than the no NovoSeven group. 
For the small number of women in the PS analysis set, the study did not show a reduction in the 
occurrence of any invasive procedure in the NovoSeven exposed women compared to matched controls 
(odds ratio: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.75), though there was a numerical treatment effect in favour of 
NovoSeven.

Study 4733 (PPH consortium) 
Title: Clinical use and outcome of NovoSeven treatment in severe postpartum haemorrhage – 
experiences from an observational multi-country (UK, DK, FR, NL) retrospective cohort study  
Study based on established cohort data from Denmark (DK), The Netherlands (NL), and the United 
Kingdom (UK). In each country, data were collected either nationally or from multiple regions on a 
population basis. Data analysis is performed at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology of the Leiden 
University Medical Centre, The Netherlands. 
Study design 
The current study, NN7711-4733, was a retrospective non-interventional cohort study of women with 
severe PPH who were treated with NovoSeven or other standard of care. The analyses were done utilising 
retrospective data that were collected for other purposes from three previously established cohorts in DK, 
NL and UK. Data analyses were performed at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology of the Leiden 
University Medical Centre. 
Setting 
The data include three previously established cohorts from three countries (DK, NL and UK). The study is 
based on secondary use of data. 
•  DK - data were identified and collected from the Danish Medical Birth Registry (DMBR) and the Danish 
Transfusion Database (DTD) over the period 2001-2009. 
•  NL – data were identified and collected from TeMpOH-1, a national retrospective cohort study 
conducted between January 2011 and January 2013, which included 75% of all hospitals in the 
Netherlands 
•  UK– data were identified and collected from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System, a 
national surveillance database, during the period between July 2012 to June 2013. 
Follow-up 
Duration of follow-up was up to 6 months from delivery for the DK cohort, from delivery up to discharge 
or death for the UK cohorts and from delivery to end of bleeding for the NL cohort.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Inclusion in one of the four cohorts (DK, FR1, NL, UK). Women from each cohort were identified as PPH 
patients using specific identification criteria: 
Denmark – women who had a birth identified in the DMBR and had transfused 10 or more units of RBC 
within 24 hours identified from DTD were included in study 
The Netherlands - women who experienced an obstetric haemorrhage and had received at least one of 
the following were included: received ≥4 units of red blood cells (RBC), multicomponent blood transfusion 
(RBC and fresh frozen plasma and/or platelet concentrates), plasma in addition to RBCs as a result of 
obstetric haemorrhage 
United Kingdom - women who fulfilled the following criteria were included: received ≥8 units of RBC 
transfused within 24 hours, 20 or more weeks of gestation. 
Exclusion criteria: None. 
Sample size 
The identification of women with severe PPH in each of the datasets was based on being an obstetric case 
and requirement for transfusion of blood or blood products. There was no formal power calculation and 
the study included all women from the datasets who were eligible according to the inclusion criteria.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS): defined as all women who met the inclusion criteria for the study, i.e., all 
women with severe PPH (a subpopulation in the FAS is used for post-hoc analysis of a common 
project endpoint was analysed in the FAS, discussed in section analysis across studies). 
•  Data from DK and NL include time varying information and data from these two countries were 
included in the time varying propensity score (PS) matched analyses.  
Propensity score matching 
The PS analysis was a pre-specified analyse as per SAP and identical to study 4729 (Bern) 
Primary endpoint analysis 
Identical to study 4729 (Bern) 
Secondary endpoint analysis 
To address the secondary objectives, the comparisons were made using the matched women from the 
propensity score matching described above (data from DK and NL). A significance level (alpha) of 0.05 
was used.  
Control of bleeding: 
• 
The total number of blood products (RBC and FFP, separately) units was analysed using a negative 
binomial regression with treatment, period (pre/post time0) and the interaction between treatment 
and period as factors. Subject and matched groups (defined as an exposed woman and her matched 
controls) were included as a random effect, and (log) duration of each period was included as an 
offset. The interaction term gave a statistical test for difference in the relative change in blood 
product use pre and post time 0 between the two groups. Ratio of the relative reduction was 
presented with 95% CI and two-sided p-value. A similar analysis was performed with only post time0 
count as outcome and the pre-count divided by the (log) duration of the pre-period as covariates.

•  Several women did not have repeated blood loss measurements before and after time0, therefore, 
the secondary endpoint “Estimated volume of blood loss” could not be analysed. 
Hysterectomy: 
• 
The comparison of the incidences was analysed using same approach as for the primary endpoint. 
After matching, women with a hysterectomy in the conjoint period (defined as the period from 20 
minutes before and 20 minutes after time0) were excluded. 
Results 
Patient disposition 
PS analysis set 
PS matching was done for women in the DK and NL cohorts. PS matching could not be done for the UK 
cohort due to lack of time varying data. 
The FAS for the DK and NL cohorts combined included 1499 women and 1482 of these women were 
eligible for PS matching, of which 53 were exposed to NovoSeven. A total of 17 women were not eligible 
for PS matching due to hysterectomy before onset of severe PPH (12 women) or pre-planned 
hysterectomy (5 women). In addition, 21 exposed women had hysterectomy before NovoSeven 
administration; these women were not eligible for matching in the exposed group of women but were 
eligible for matching as controls. 
For the DK and NL cohorts combined, a total of 40 exposed women (75.5% of the 53 exposed women 
eligible for PS matching) were included in the PS analysis set as matched exposed and 115 women were 
included as matched controls (1 to 4 controls per exposed woman) based on the final PS model. Thirteen 
NovoSeven exposed women could not be matched in the final PS model. 
Nine of the matched controls were later exposed to NovoSeven after matching at time0 but only 5 of 
these women were included in the matched exposed group (i.e., included in both the matched control and 
matched exposed groups with different time0 for each group). 
Patient characteristics PS 
In the PS analysis set, the two groups were comparable in terms of age, previous caesarean section, 
previous PPH, parity, and multiple birth. The most common cause of PPH was uterine atony with its 
proportions being similar between the two groups (NovoSeven exposed: 57.5%; matched controls: 
60.2%). Some difference was observed in the proportions of women with AIP as the primary cause for 
PPH (6/40 women (15.0%) and 3.5/40 women (8.8%) for NovoSeven and matched controls, 
respectively). Patient characteristics for the PS analysis (DK + NL) sets are presented below in Table 15.

NovoSeven dose 
No information was available on number of doses of NovoSeven administered in DK. Where number of 
doses was available in the NL data, most patients (28 of 36 patients; 77.8%) received a single dose. 
Median dose for DK and NL cohorts combined was 5 mg (IQR 2.4−7.2 mg) in the PS analysis set. Median 
time from onset of severe PPH to first dose of NovoSeven for DK and NL cohorts combined was 144 
minutes in the PS analysis set. 
Primary efficacy endpoint PS analysis 
•  Among women who were at risk of further invasive procedures, 57.9% (22/38) of NovoSeven 
exposed women had an invasive procedure in the period from 20 minutes to 24 hours following time0 
compared to 35.1% (13.3/38) of matched controls, with an odds ratio of 2.46 (95% CI: 1.06, 5.99; 
p=0.0355) favouring matched controls. The odds ratio was 2.23 (95% CI: 0.84, 6.05) for 
hysterectomy. The results of the PS analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint and other endpoints are 
presented in Table 16.

In the subgroup of women who had not received any invasive procedure before concurrent period, 
54.8% (17/31) of NovoSeven exposed women had an invasive procedure in the period from 20 
minutes to 24 hours following time0 compared to 40.7% (12.3/30.1) of matched controls, with an 
odds ratio of 1.66 (95% CI: 0.63; 4.62; p=0.3681). 
The sensitivity analysis that excluded matched controls that were exposed to NovoSeven after 
matching broadly supported the findings of the primary statistical analysis (OR 2.62 [1.11, 6.54]) 
Control of bleeding 
DK plus NL cohort (PS analysis set): For RBC and FFP, the mean rates of transfusion (units per hour) 
were lower after time0 than before time0 for both NovoSeven exposed women and matched controls. The 
rate ratios (after time0/before time0) were similar between NovoSeven exposed women and the matched 
controls both for RBC and FFP transfusions, with relative rate ratio after time0 of 1.09 (95% CI: 0.70, 
1.69; p=0.694) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.28; p=0.297), respectively. 
•  Study 4731 (UniSeven) 
Title: Clinical use and outcome of NovoSeven treatment in severe postpartum haemorrhage – a 
retrospective cohort study of Czech women from the UniSeven registry 
Study design 
The current study NN7711-4731, was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical use of 
NovoSeven and clinical outcomes in Czech women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven. The 
study analysed the data from the UniSeven registry that were evaluated retrospectively. 
Data source 
UniSeven is a retrospective observational data registry that was established in 2004 to collect data on 
NovoSeven administration in non-haemophiliac people from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and 
Hungary. The registry recorded data on off-label use of NovoSeven between July 2003 to April 2014. The 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 46/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data in the UniSeven registry were owned by the Institute of Biostatistics and Analysis at the Masaryk 
University in the Czech Republic. The registry was multinational; however, the current study (NN7711-
4731) included data on women only from the Czech Republic as this subset of data had undergone data 
quality control. 
Setting 
The UniSeven registry recorded data on various off-label use of NovoSeven, however, the current study 
analysed the variables which are relevant to PPH. Data collection was performed between 27 July 2020 
and 31 July 2020. 
Study period 
The UniSeven registry recorded off-label use of NovoSeven between July 2003 to April 2014. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
The primary objective was to describe the proportion of women with an event of sPPH that avoided 
invasive procedures (uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine 
compression sutures, and hysterectomy) following treatment with NovoSeven. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
To describe the frequency of TEs in women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven 
To describe the proportion of women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven that achieve 
control of bleeding (as assessed by the health care professional [HCP] as decreased or ceased 
bleeding) after the last NovoSeven dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
•  Occurrence of invasive procedures (yes/no) in the study population following NovoSeven 
administration (within a timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following NovoSeven administration). 
Invasive procedures were defined as: uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, 
uterine compression sutures, or hysterectomy. The population for primary analysis included women 
who did not have any invasive procedure before or concurrent with NovoSeven administration. 
A 20 minutes lag-time was chosen due to the following reasons: 
• 
• 
Peak coagulation ability is attained approximately 10 minutes after NovoSeven administration. A 20 
minute lag time was chosen to allow leeway for circulation of the drug and time for observers to 
appropriately assess any decrease in blood loss. 
The 20 minutes lag-time is chosen to disregard any case where a conjoint decision has been taken to 
administer NovoSeven and perform an invasive procedure consecutively. 
•  Cases where decision to perform invasive procedure is taken simultaneous with administration of 
NovoSeven, NovoSeven would not have had sufficient time to be effective and the procedure is 
performed with in the lag time, these are avoided to be considered as lack of efficacy of NovoSeven. 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 47/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Occurrence of thromboembolic events, yes/no From first administration of NovoSeven to end of 
hospitalisation 
•  Control of bleeding, yes/no Within 24h after NovoSeven administration. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Inclusion criteria: 
•  Czech women Treated with NovoSeven due to sPPH, defined as ≥1,500 mL blood loss within the 
period of 24h after delivery, registered in UniSeven, identified as PPH patients from UniSeven registry 
using the following identification criteria: postpartum/postpartal haemorrhage, delivery/caesarean 
section, or birth (relating to giving birth), amniotic embolism, eclampsia, or a known cause of PPH in 
the comments (in English or Czech), ICD10 codes belonging to the group O60-O75 (“Complications of 
labour and delivery”) or O80-O84 (“Delivery”). 
Exclusion criteria: none. 
Product and mode of administration 
Patients were treated with commercially available NovoSeven according to local routine clinical practice at 
the discretion of the treating physician. 
Statistical methods 
Data were summarised for the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which included all women who met the inclusion 
criteria for the study. No other analysis sets were used. 
Main statistical methods 
This was a retrospective, single-cohort, observational study and hence no formal testing of statistical 
hypotheses was performed. Evaluation of data was based upon descriptive statistics, i.e. summary tables 
and figures. Continuous variables were summarised using standard statistical measures, i.e. number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median (IQR), minimum and maximum. Categorical data were 
summarised by frequency tables. 
Primary endpoint analysis  
• 
The primary endpoint was analysed by summarising the number and proportion of women who 
received NovoSeven and underwent or not underwent any invasive procedure within a time-frame of 
20 mins to 24 hours following the first NovoSeven administration. This was calculated for the 
population at risk for invasive procedure, which is defined as the women who were at the risk of 
invasive procedure after the first NovoSeven administration. Women who had a hysterectomy before 
or conjoint with first NovoSeven administration were considered to be no longer at risk of invasive 
procedure and thus excluded from the population at risk.  
•  Additionally, the number and proportion of women, who received at least one invasive procedure at 
the time of NovoSeven administration and again received any invasive procedure within a time-frame 
of 20 mins to 24 hours following NovoSeven administration, were summarised.  
•  An overall summary of women with or without any invasive procedure prior to first NovoSeven 
administration but receiving any invasive procedure after the first NovoSeven administration was also 
provided.

Secondary endpoint analyses 
The proportion of the study population with severe PPH that achieved control of bleeding within 24 hours 
after administration of NovoSeven was calculated. Control of bleeding was defined as achieved/not 
achieved as assessed by the health care professional. 
Results 
Patient disposition 
A total of the 993 Czech patients were registered with UniSeven registry during the period from July 2003 
to April 2014. Of these, 111 women treated with NovoSeven were identified as PPH patients. Of these 
111 women, 24 women did not fulfil the inclusion criteria #2 and were excluded from the FAS: 9 due to 
blood loss <1500 mL (0-1440 mL) and 15 due to no information on blood loss (Data on file). Thus, FAS 
included a total of 87 women with sPPH who had ≥1,500 mL blood loss within the period of 24 hours prior 
to first dose of NovoSeven administration, see figure 6.

*inclusion criterion #2: treated with Novoseven due to severe PPH, defined as >1500 ml blood loss within the period of 
24 hours prior to the first dose of NovoSeven administration 
Patient demographic and characteristics 
The mean (SD) age at delivery was 31.7 (5.1) years; the majority of women were aged between 25 to 44 
years (56.3% in 25-34 age category and 32.2% in 35-44 age category). The mean maternal body weight 
was 73.5 kg. Overall, 46.0% (40/87) of women had caesarean section as mode of delivery, 8.0% (7/87) 
had vaginal delivery and for 46.0% (40/87) the information was missing. Overall, 44.8% (39/87) of 
women had singleton births, 3.4% (3/87) had twin babies, 3.4% (3/87) had multiple babies (gave birth 
to more than one child, but information on number of children was not available) and the information was 
missing for 48.3% (42/87) of women. 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 49/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 64.4% (56/87) of the women had a single cause of PPH; 19.5% (17/87) of the women had 
multiple causes of PPH and the cause of PPH was missing for 16.1% (14/87) of the women. The most 
common cause of PPH were “other’ (36.8% [32/87]) and uterine atony (27.6% [24/87]) followed by 
abnormally invasive placenta (AIP) (18.4% [16/87]). 
The mean (SD) estimated blood loss before NovoSeven administration was 3687.9 (1927.3) mL (range: 
1500 to 12000 mL).  
NovoSeven dose 
Number of doses: 
−  Majority of women (72.4% [63/87]) received only one dose;  
−  23.0% (20/87) women received exactly two doses  
−  4.6% (4/87) women received exactly three doses. 
Dose per kg: 
• 
• 
• 
The median first dose in the FAS was 105 μg/kg (range: 50-200 μg/kg). 
The median second (100 μg/kg; range: 28-140 μg/kg) and third doses (100 μg/kg, range: 85-110 
μg/kg) in the FAS were similar. 
For approximately two-thirds (65/87) of women the first dose of NovoSeven was >90 μg/kg, for 17 
women the first dose was 60-90 μg/kg, and for 5 women it was <60 μg/kg. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 87 women included in the FAS, a total of 44 women were excluded from the primary endpoint 
analysis due to a hysterectomy performed before or conjoint with NovoSeven administration. Thus, the 
population at risk of further invasive procedures included 43 women. Of the 43 women, 7 women had an 
invasive procedure (other than hysterectomy) and 36 women did not have any invasive procedure prior 
to or conjoint with first NovoSeven administration; these 36 women were included in the primary 
analysis. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
•  Of the 36 women who did not have any invasive procedures before or conjoint with NovoSeven 
administration included in the primary analysis, 10 (27.8%, 95% CI: 14.2; 45.2) had an invasive 
procedure 20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven administration. This suggests that after 
NovoSeven treatment invasive procedures were avoided in 72.2% (26/36) of women who did not 
have any invasive procedure prior to or conjoint with first NovoSeven administration. 
•  Of the 43 women who were at risk of further invasive procedures after first NovoSeven 
administration, 33 (76.7%) did not have an invasive procedure after the first NovoSeven 
administration (irrespective of whether they had an invasive procedure [other than hysterectomy] 
prior to first NovoSeven administration) and 10 women (23.3%, CI: 11.8; 38.6) had an invasive 
procedure after the first NovoSeven administration. 
Of the 10 women who had invasive procedures following NovoSeven administration, 9 underwent 
hysterectomy and 1 underwent radiological arterial embolisation.

Secondary endpoints 
Control of bleeding 
•  Of the 87 women included in the FAS, 85 (97.7%) women achieved control of bleeding and 2 (2.3%) 
women did not achieve control of bleeding within 24 hours of NovoSeven administration. 
• 
The mean estimated blood loss decreased after NovoSeven administration (blood loss after 
NovoSeven administration, mean [SD]: 868.14 [974.73] mL and blood loss before NovoSeven 
administration, mean [SD]: 3688 [1927] mL). Women who required more than one dose of 
NovoSeven lost more blood (1239 mL and 1936 mL in women receiving 2 doses and 3 doses of 
NovoSeven, respectively) than women who required only one dose (670 mL). The mean estimated 
blood loss was the highest in women who received more than 2 doses of NovoSeven. 
Summary  
A total of 111 women with PPH registered in the UniSeven registry, of these, 87 women with severe PPH 
met the inclusion criteria of the study. Analysis of the use of NovoSeven as a haemostatic agent in the 87 
women with severe PPH demonstrated: 
• 
The median first dose of NovoSeven was 105μg/kg, the median second and third doses were 100 
μg/kg each. The median total dose of NovoSeven was 120 μg/kg. The majority of women (72.4% 
[63/87]) received only one dose of NovoSeven; 23.0% (20/87) women received two doses and 4.6% 
(4/87) women received three doses of NovoSeven. 
•  36 women did not have any invasive procedure prior to or during NovoSeven administration. Of 
these, 27.8%, (10/36) had and 72.2% (26/36) did not have any invasive procedures after 
NovoSeven administration. 
•  97.7% (85/87) women achieved control of bleeding within 24 hours following NovoSeven 
administration.

Study 4732 (ANZHR) 
Title: Clinical use and outcome of NovoSeven treatment in severe postpartum haemorrhage – a 
retrospective cohort study of women from the Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis 
Registry 
Study design 
The current study NN7711-432, was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical use of NovoSeven 
and clinical outcomes in women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven using data collected from 
the ANZHR. The study population was treated according to local routine clinical practice at the discretion 
of the treating physician. The study protocol and analysis plan were co-developed by Monash University 
and Novo Nordisk. 
Setting 
The ANZHR recorded data on various off-label uses of NovoSeven, however, the current study analysed 
the variables which are considered relevant for PPH.  
For this study NN7711-4732, the Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) team at 
Monash University was responsible for patient registration, data collection and data analyses and the 
study clinician made causality assessments of the adverse events. 
Novoseven II/116 -

Data source 
The ANZHR is a comprehensive registry documenting off-label use of NovoSeven in patients who do not 
have congenital haemophilia at participating hospitals throughout Australia and New Zealand. The ANZHR 
was established by the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University 
(Australia) and funded through an educational grant from Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd., 
Baulkham Hills, NSW, Australia. The registry began receiving data in May 2005 and included retrospective 
data from the period 2000–2009, with the first use of NovoSeven in obstetric haemorrhage reported in 
2002.  
Ninety-six hospitals participated across Australia and New Zealand. These included all major metropolitan 
hospitals in the two countries and were estimated to account for more than 95% of off-label use of 
NovoSeven during the period.24 Patients receiving NovoSeven to prevent or treat critical bleeding 
episodes outside the approved indications were eligible for inclusion in the registry. Of the 96 
participating hospitals, 75 hospitals from Australia and New Zealand contributed data, the remaining 21 
hospitals did not use NovoSeven for off-label conditions. Patients were identified by local investigators at 
each hospital using blood bank and/or pharmacy records. It was mandated by the registry that 
participating hospitals register each case of off-label use of NovoSeven at their institution. 
Data collected as part of the registry were managed according to guidelines stipulated by the Australian 
Therapeutic Goods Administration and conformed to Commonwealth and State privacy principles. 
Study period:  
The Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) recorded off-label use of NovoSeven 
between 2000 and 2009. Publication by Phillips LE, 2009. 
Primary objective: 
• 
The primary objective was to describe the proportion of women with an event of sPPH that avoided 
invasive procedures following treatment with NovoSeven. Invasive procedures are defined as: uterine 
or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression sutures (e.g. B-lynch 
sutures), and hysterectomy. Avoided does not infer causality, but rather should be understood as “did 
not have”. 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
To describe the frequency of thromboembolic events (TEs) in women with an event of sPPH treated 
with NovoSeven 
To describe the proportion of women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven that achieve 
control of bleeding (as assessed by the health care professional as decreased or ceased bleeding) 
after the last NovoSeven dose. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
•  Occurrence of invasive procedures (yes/no) between 20 min-24 hours following NovoSeven 
administration. Invasive procedures included uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial 
embolisation, uterine compression sutures (e.g. B-lynch sutures) or hysterectomy. 
A 20 minutes lag-time was chosen for the same reasons as presented for study 4731 (UniSeven): 
−  Peak coagulation ability is attained approximately 10 minutes after NovoSeven 
administration. 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 52/120 
 
 
 
 
−  A 20 minute lag time was chosen to allow leeway for circulation of the drug and time for 
observers to appropriately assess any decrease in blood loss.28 
−  The lag-time was chosen to disregard any case where a decision had been taken to 
administer NovoSeven and perform an invasive procedure concurrently. 
−  Cases where the decision to perform invasive procedure is taken simultaneously with 
administration of NovoSeven, where NovoSeven would not have had sufficient time to be 
effective if the procedure is performed within the lag time, are not considered as lack of 
efficacy of NovoSeven. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Occurrence of thromboembolic events, from first administration of NovoSeven until 7 days after last 
administration of NovoSeven 
•  Control of bleeding, yes/no After last dose of NovoSeven as reported in the data collection sheet 
Criteria for inclusion/exclusion 
The study population included women from Australia and New Zealand with an event of sPPH, treated 
with NovoSeven due to a critical bleed and were registered in the ANZHR. 
Inclusion criteria 
• 
Treated with NovoSeven due to severe PPH defined as an obstetric case with a registration of a 
delivery in ANZHR 
Exclusion criteria 
•  Delivery at <24 weeks of gestational age 
Product and mode of administration 
Patients were treated with commercially available NovoSeven according to local routine clinical practice at 
the discretion of the treating physician. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Data were summarised for the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which included all women who met the inclusion 
criteria for the study. 
Main statistical methods 
This was a retrospective, single-cohort, observational study and hence no formal testing of statistical 
hypotheses was performed. Evaluation of data was based upon descriptive statistics, i.e. summary tables 
and figures. Continuous variables were summarised using standard statistical measures, i.e. number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median (IQR), minimum and maximum. Categorical data were 
summarised by frequency tables. 
Exploratory univariate analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of different factors on the 
control of bleeding after the first and last dose of NovoSeven. 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary endpoint was analysed by summarising the number and proportion of women who received 
NovoSeven and did undergo any invasive procedure within a timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 53/120 
 
 
 
 
 
the first administration. This was calculated for the population at risk of invasive procedure after the first 
NovoSeven administration. Women who had a hysterectomy before or concurrent with first NovoSeven 
administration were considered to be no longer at risk of invasive procedure and thus excluded from the 
population at risk. Women, where the timing of an invasive procedure compared to first NovoSeven 
administration was unknown, were also excluded. 
For the main analysis all women who had any invasive procedure prior to the first NovoSeven 
administration were excluded. The results of this analysis are also presented by number of NovoSeven 
doses received.  
The analysis of the primary endpoint was repeated for the subgroup of women that had an “other 
invasive procedure” (not hysterectomy) prior to their first NovoSeven administration. 
Secondary endpoint analyses 
The proportion of the study population with severe PPH that achieve control (yes/no) of bleeding after the 
last dose of NovoSeven were reported. Control of bleeding was defined as an assessment by the health 
care professional of decreased or ceased bleeding. Whether control of bleeding was achieved (yes/no) in 
women with an event of severe PPH was summarised by subgroups based on doses of NovoSeven 
(receiving one dose of NovoSeven, two doses of NovoSeven and more than two doses of NovoSeven). 
Results 
Patient disposition 
Patient disposition in the ANZHR is illustrated in Figure 7. A total of 3314 patients were registered in the 
ANZHR. Of these, 177 women treated with NovoSeven were identified as obstetric patients with a delivery 
recorded in ANZHR. Of the 177 women, 11 were excluded because the gestational age that was recorded 
was <24 weeks. The remaining 166 women were included in the FAS for this study. 
Figure 7 
 Patient disposition in the ANZHR 
Demographics and patient characteristics 
The mean age at delivery was 32.3 years, with the majority (59.6%, 99/166) of women aged between 31 
and 40 years. The mean maternal body weight was 68.8 kg and the mean gestation period was 36.6 
weeks. In total, 70.5% of deliveries were by caesarean section: 52.4% by emergency caesarean section 
and 18.1% by elective caesarean. Singleton births were recorded in 158 of the women (95.2%) while 8 
women (4.8%) gave birth to twins. The most common causes of PPH (more than one cause could be

indicated) were “other’ (52.4%) and uterine atony (23.5%) followed by AIP (16.9%). The cause of PPH 
was missing for 24 women (14.5%).  
NovoSeven dose 
Number of doses: 
The majority of women (76.5%, 127/166) received only one dose; 16.3% (27/166) of women received 
two doses and 7.2% (12/166) of women received three or more doses. 
−  The median time from onset of bleeding to first dose of NovoSeven was 291 minutes IQR: 160- 525 
minutes. 
−  The median time between the first and the second dose of NovoSeven was 105 minutes IQR: 46-300 
minutes and the median time between the second and third dose was 175 minutes (IQR: 60-310 
minutes). 
Dose per kg: 
−  The median first dose in the FAS was 96 μg/kg (interquartile range (IQR): 74 - 109 μg/kg). The 
median second (83 μg/kg, IQR: 62 - 97 μg/kg) and third doses (80 μg/kg, IQR: 44 - 96 μg/kg) were 
lower than the median first dose. 
− 
For 60% (81/135) of women the first dose of NovoSeven was >90 μg/kg, for 34 women the first dose 
was 60-90 μg/kg, and for 20 women it was <60 μg/kg. 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 166 women included in the FAS, a total of 92 women were excluded from the primary endpoint 
analysis due to a hysterectomy performed before or concurrent with NovoSeven administration (n=54) or 
a missing timing of an invasive procedure (n=38). Thus, the population at risk of further invasive 
procedures included 74 women. Of the 74 women, 14 women had an invasive procedure (other than 
hysterectomy) and 60 women did not have any invasive procedure before first NovoSeven administration; 
these 60 women were included in the primary efficacy analysis. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
•  Of the 74 women who were at risk of further invasive procedures after first NovoSeven 
administration, 52 (70%) did not require an invasive procedure after the first NovoSeven 
administration (irrespective of whether they had an invasive procedure [other than hysterectomy] 
prior to first NovoSeven administration) and 22 women (30%, 95% CI: 20%; 41%) required an 
invasive procedure 20 minutes to 24 hours after the first NovoSeven administration. 
•  Subgroup analysis: 
Of the 60 women included in the primary analysis who had not any invasive procedures before 
NovoSeven administration, 21/60 (35%, 95% CI: 23%; 48%) had an invasive procedure 20 minutes 
to 24 hours after first NovoSeven administration. No invasive procedures were required for 65% 
(39/60) of the women who had not had any invasive procedure before first NovoSeven 
administration. 
Additional analysis in women with confirmed severe PPH 
The primary endpoint analyses were repeated in the subgroup of women with confirmed severe PPH. The 
results were consistent with the results from the FAS.

Additional analysis by number of doses 
Of the 60 women included in the primary endpoint analysis, 44 women received one dose, 12 women 
received 2 doses and 4 women received more than 2 doses. 
−  Of the 44 women who received one dose of NovoSeven, 12 (27%) had an invasive procedure within a 
timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following the NovoSeven administration. Therefore 32 (73%) 
women did not have an invasive procedure within a timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following the 
NovoSeven administration. 
−  Of the 12 women who received 2 doses of NovoSeven, 6 (50%) had an invasive procedure within a 
timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following first NovoSeven administration. Therefore 6 (50%) 
women did not have an invasive procedure within a timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following the 
first NovoSeven administration. 
−  Of the 4 women who received more than 2 doses of NovoSeven, 3 (75%) had an invasive procedure 
within a timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours following the NovoSeven administration. Therefore 1 
(25%) woman did not have an invasive procedure within a timeframe of 20 mins to 24 hours 
following the first NovoSeven administration. 
Secondary endpoints 
Control of bleeding 
Control of bleeding was assessed by the treating physician following the last NovoSeven dose in 142 
women while no information was available for 24 women. These 24 women with no information have 
been excluded from the analysis of bleeding control but are included in the various subgroup analyses as 
“missing”. 
•  Bleeding was controlled after the last NovoSeven administration in 73.9% of women (105/142). 
NovoSeven dose. 
• 
• 
The proportion of women with confirmed severe PPH who achieved bleeding control was 73% 
(94/128). 
The proportion of women with confirmed severe PPH who achieved bleeding control was 76% (75/99) 
in those women who only received a single dose of NovoSeven and 65% (15/23) in those women who 
received 2 doses of NovoSeven. 
Summary  
A total of 166 women with sPPH met the inclusion criteria of the study. Analysis of the use of NovoSeven 
as a haemostatic agent in the 166 women with sPPH demonstrated: 
• 
The median first dose of NovoSeven was 96 μg/kg. The median second was 83 μg/kg and the median 
third dos was 80 μg/kg. The median total dose was 103 μg/kg. The majority of women (127/166; 
76.5%) received only one dose; 16.3% (27/166) women received two doses and 7.2% (12/166) 
women received three or more doses. 
•  60 women had not had any invasive procedure before first NovoSeven administration. Of these, 39 
(65%) did not have any invasive procedures after NovoSeven administration. 
•  74 women had not had a hysterectomy before or concurrent with the first NovoSeven administration. 
Of these 52 (70%) did not have any invasive procedures after NovoSeven administration. 
•  73.9% (105/142) women achieved control of bleeding following the last NovoSeven administration.

Of the 60 patients who had not any invasive procedures before NovoSeven administration, 21/60 (35%, 
95% CI: 23%; 48%) had an invasive procedure 20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven 
administration. This outcome suggests that after NovoSeven treatment invasive procedures were avoided 
for 65% (39/60) of the women who had not had any invasive procedure before first NovoSeven 
administration. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Post-hoc analysis of a common primary efficacy endpoint (project endpoint) in RCT and non-
epidemiological studies  
Project endpoint 
To support the regulatory submission, a common ‘project endpoint’ was defined by the MAH, in 
accordance with regulatory guidance from NL and FR and external experts across relevant medical 
specialties, to evaluate efficacy of NovoSeven both in RCT and non-interventional studies.  
• 
• 
The predefined RCT protocol endpoint was defined as: 
the absolute and relative reduction in the need for specific second-line therapies (rate of embolisation 
and/or ligation).  
The primary endpoint in the RCT publication was defined as: 
reduction in the need of specific second line therapies (uterine compression sutures, uterine artery 
embolization, vascular ligation or peripartum hysterectomy).  
• 
The MAH defined ‘project endpoint’ as:  
“occurrence of any invasive procedure after first treatment with NovoSeven”, where invasive 
procedure was defined as uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine 
compression sutures, and/or hysterectomy”  
Data sources 
For trial 4816 (RCT), study 4729 (Bern) and study 4731 (UniSeven), Novo Nordisk had access to 
anonymised/pseudonymised patient-level data and performed descriptive and statistical analyses of the 
data as relevant. For study 4733 (PPH consortium) and study 4732 (ANZHR), descriptive and statistical 
analyses were performed by academic institutions (Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden 
University Medical Centre and Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, 
respectively) based on patient-level data. These academic institutions then provided population-level data 
to Novo Nordisk for reporting purposes.  
These analyses of the project endpoint were conducted of all exposed women in the FAS who were at risk 
of further invasive procedures after NovoSeven administration (i.e., the population of women at risk).  
Additionally, analyses of the project endpoint were conducted for the subpopulation of women who did 
not receive any invasive procedure before first NovoSeven administration. These analyses were either 
prespecified in the SAP (UniSeven, NZ) or were conducted post hoc (RCT, Bern, PPH consortium) for 
consistency across the data sources. 
Trial 4816 (RCT) 
In trial 4816 (RCT), efficacy of NovoSeven was evaluated post hoc through the ‘project endpoint’ to be 
consistent with other data sources, and not by the protocol defined primary endpoint of rate of 
embolisation and/or ligation, but both endpoints were based on the primary objective of the trial. 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 57/120 
 
 
 
 
For the RCT, the post hoc analysis included: 
• 
• 
‘project endpoint’ (at least one uterine or iliac arterial ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, 
uterine compression suture, and/or hysterectomy)  
the new secondary endpoint of occurrence of hysterectomy. 
As directed by the RCT protocol, patients were randomised approximately 1 hour after sulprostone failure 
to control their bleeding. The intention of the RCT was to administer NovoSeven before any invasive 
procedure in those randomised to NovoSeven. The ‘project endpoint’ was assessed at the encircled time 
point in Figure 8 below. 
Figure 8 
Trial design  
Note: The figure is based on the publication by Lavigne-Lissalde et al. The ‘project endpoint’ was assessed at the 
encircled time point. Second-line treatment includes uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, 
uterine compression sutures, and/or hysterectomy. Abbreviations: IC = confidence interval; IV = intravenous 
aTime to initiation of a second-line treatment was same for both groups. Median delay was 30 minutes (95% CI: 15 
minutes to 80 minutes) in the reference group and 30 minutes (95% CI:22 minutes to 60 minutes) in the NovoSeven 
group. 
bNo need for specific second-line therapies; cNeed for specific second-line therapies; dHysterectomy 
Statistical analysis of ‘project endpoint’ in RCT 
The ‘project endpoint’ was analysed post hoc at any time point after randomisation until stop of PPH. 
Analysis for occurrence of hysterectomy was also added. As directed by the RCT protocol, patients were 
randomised approximately 1 hour after sulprostone failure to control their bleeding. The intention of the 
RCT was to administer NovoSeven before any invasive procedure in those randomised to NovoSeven.  
The occurrence of invasive procedures and hysterectomy was compared between the NovoSeven and 
reference groups by the relative risk, the risk difference, and the relative reduction, and presented with 
95% CI. For the relative risk, the p-value was calculated from the chi-square test. All tests and 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 58/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence intervals were two-sided, assessed at 5% significance level and were performed in the FAS. To 
facilitate alignment with the analyses in the other data sources, the odds ratio was estimated with a 
logistic regression analysis also providing a p-value and a 95% CI. 
CTR follows all the data decision made by the original trial team outside Novo Nordisk (Nîmes University 
Hospital). However, one woman in the NovoSeven group underwent a ligation (invasive procedure) prior 
to NovoSeven administration and she had no further invasive procedures after NovoSeven administration. 
This case was counted by the investigators as having an invasive procedure following NovoSeven dose. 
This issue was subsequently addressed post hoc by the study group at Novo Nordisk by not counting the 
woman with prior ligation to have an invasive procedure post NovoSeven administration and was 
subsequently removed from the numbers of the ‘project endpoint’. Furthermore, she was not included in 
the subpopulation of ‘women without any invasive procedure prior to randomisation’.  
Summary of various qualitative and quantitative characteristics for both groups (NovoSeven and 
reference) were presented using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics of categorical data were 
summarised by frequency tables (number and proportion) while continuous data were summarised by 
mean (SD), median (IQR), minimum and maximum value. Additional statistical and post hoc analyses 
were also carried out and additional endpoints defined. 
Four non-interventional studies 
• 
For the four non-interventional studies, the ‘project endpoint’ was evaluated within a timeframe of 
20 minutes to 24 hours following first administration of NovoSeven. The pattern of NovoSeven 
administration in the non-interventional studies was different to the RCT with women receiving 
NovoSeven at any time in the course of PPH. 
Populations included: 
studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium)  
• 
In both studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium), the 'project endpoint' was evaluated for 
NovoSeven exposed women who were at risk of further invasive procedures after NovoSeven 
administration (population at risk). The subpopulation of the FAS was defined post hoc as:  
o  For studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium-DK and NL cohort): The population of patients 
at risk was defined as women in the FAS who received NovoSeven without pre-planned 
hysterectomy, or hysterectomy performed before onset of severe PPH, or insufficient data to be 
part of the PS matching, or hysterectomy before or concurrent with NovoSeven administration, or 
with PPH stop before receiving NovoSeven. 
o  For study 4733 (PPH consortium-UK cohort): The population of patients at risk was defined as 
women in the FAS without hysterectomy before or concurrent with first administration of 
NovoSeven.  
This subpopulation represents those women in the FAS that, after receiving NovoSeven, were still 
relevant for evaluating the 'project endpoint' of occurrence of invasive procedure after the concurrent 
period. This population was added post hoc, as it was not anticipated that a number of patients would 
have an order of events that made the evaluation of the primary endpoint not at all meaningful or with 
limited meaning after NovoSeven administration. Women who received NovoSeven after PPH stop due to 
restart of a bleed or other reasons were also excluded as they might have a different risk profile. This 
post hoc analysis was added to have a subgroup aligned with the data from studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 
4732 (ANZHR).

Page 59/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR) 
• 
Pre-specified analyses: The primary endpoint for both studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR) 
was occurrence of invasive procedures (i.e. uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial 
embolisation, uterine compression sutures, and/or hysterectomy) within a timeframe of 20 minutes to 
24 hours following NovoSeven administration.  
It is to be noted that the studies did not pre-specify an estimand but it was defined post hoc to be 
consistent with the predefined estimands for studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium), with 
relevant modification due to study design. The estimand was defined by the following five inter-
related attributes as outlined in the ICH E9 (R1): 
−  Treatment conditions: NovoSeven treatment. 
−  Population of interest: The ‘population at risk’ without any invasive procedure before treatment 
with NovoSeven (see below how ‘before’ was defined for each study). 
−  Endpoint of interest: Occurrence of invasive procedures (uterine or iliac artery ligation, 
radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression sutures, and/or hysterectomy) within a 
timeframe of 20 minutes to 24 hours following NovoSeven administration. 
−  Approach to handle intercurrent events: Intercurrent events of death and exposure to additional 
doses of NovoSeven were handled by a hypothetical strategy and a treatment policy strategy 
respectively. 
−  Population level summary: The observed proportion of women with invasive procedures. 
This estimand was also used for the post hoc analysis in studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH 
consortium) for the population at risk. 
Statistical analysis of ‘project endpoint’ in non-interventional studies 
The post hoc analysis for study 4729 (Bern) and study 4733 (PPH consortium) was added to have a 
subgroup aligned with the data from studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR).  
Across the non-interventional studies, women meeting the inclusion criteria during the study period were 
included as part of the FAS to analyse the clinical outcomes in women treated with NovoSeven for severe 
PPH.  
The clinical outcomes of invasive procedures (‘project endpoint’) were evaluated within a timeframe of 20 
minutes to 24 hours following first administration of NovoSeven. A lag-time of 20 minutes following 
NovoSeven administration was implemented based on inputs from external experts across relevant 
medical specialties. The rationale for this decision is described below: 
• 
• 
• 
It would take 10 minutes for NovoSeven to reach peak coagulation ability. 
The 20-minute lag-time was chosen to disregard any case where the decision for both invasive 
procedure and NovoSeven was taken concurrently, with the execution being short time interval apart.  
For cases where the decision to perform an invasive procedure was taken simultaneously with 
administration of NovoSeven, NovoSeven would not have had sufficient time to be effective. 
To reflect the decision relating to this 20 minute lag, a concurrent period was defined across the non-
interventional studies. It corresponds to the period between 20 minutes before and 20 minutes after 
NovoSeven administration (for studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR)) or time0 (for studies 4729 
(Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium); see below for definition of time0). It corresponds to the period 
between 20 minutes before and 20 minutes after NovoSeven administration (for studies 4731 (UniSeven) 
and 4732 (ANZHR)) or time0 (for studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium).

General considerations regarding the clinical data sources  
The variety of data sources included in this application enable an evaluation of NovoSeven usage across a 
broad population of women with severe PPH, including pivotal data from an RCT and data from real world 
clinical practice. However, there are differences across the RCT and observational data, including the 
eligibility criteria, dose of NovoSeven, number of doses, and timing of NovoSeven administration in the 
treatment cascade, that should be considered when comparing and interpreting the results.  
•  Definition of trial/study populations  
In trial 4816 (RCT), study 4729 (Bern) and study 4731 (UniSeven), severe PPH was defined as blood loss 
of at least 1500 mL within 24 hours after delivery or within the period of 24 hours prior to first dose of 
NovoSeven administration.  
•  Dose size, number of doses and timing of NovoSeven  
In trial 4816 (RCT), a single dose of NovoSeven 60 µg/kg was administered early in the treatment 
cascade (after failure of sulprostone). The intention by trial design was that NovoSeven should be 
administered before any invasive procedure. A clinical trial in the setting of severe PPH with a baseline 
later than “failure of uterotonics” would be difficult to conduct.  
In the non-interventional studies, the dose of NovoSeven, number of doses, and timing of administration 
relative to an invasive procedure (before, with, or after invasive procedure) were at the discretion of the 
treating physician, local clinical practice, or regional/hospital guidelines in place at the time the patient 
was treated. In some cases, women were treated late in the treatment cascade as a uterus- or life-saving 
measure. Factors concerning timing of NovoSeven administration relative to invasive procedures, dose 
and number of doses have been evaluated to the extent possible in this application. 
•  Data collection  
The course of severe PPH is an acute and highly dynamic situation which can be difficult to capture, both 
in prospective clinical trials and retrospective observational studies. The data recorded in the non-
interventional studies reflected routine clinical practice rather than mandatory assessments at pre-
specified time points. Details in the medical records may not exactly match the complete set of 
information of interest for evaluation of study endpoints. Data in the non-interventional studies were also 
masked or anonymised, as per data transfer agreements, to prevent identification of individual patients. 
Consequently, in some cases, only partial information is available for some events. 
•  Severity or progression of PPH at time of NovoSeven administration  
Current treatment guidelines in severe PPH that recommend the use of NovoSeven often do so as a last 
resort just before or after hysterectomy, which may bias the group of NovoSeven treated women toward 
more severe or more progressed cases. Thus, in the real world, women treated with NovoSeven may 
have a worse or more progressed event of severe PPH than women not treated with NovoSeven, which 
phenomenon is referred to as ‘confounding by indication’. This is reflected in the meta-analysis conducted 
as part of the literature review by the fact that on average 41.5% of women treated with NovoSeven had 
a hysterectomy performed before NovoSeven was administered, while only 27.7% of the women with 
severe PPH who were not treated with NovoSeven had a hysterectomy performed at any point.  
To reduce the effects of confounders in the observational data, propensity score matching was used in 
studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium), see separate summaries of these studies in section 
supportive studies.

•  Historical context  
Data from the sources presented were collected over a period from 1996 onwards, with much of the data 
being collected more than 5 years ago. Treatment for PPH, including the use of fibrinogen and tranexamic 
acid (TXA), has developed over recent years. The standard of care for PPH is continually being updated. 
Results 
Patient disposition RCT and non-interventional studies 
Overall, in the FAS across these clinical data sources (4816, 4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732), a total of 437 
women were included in the NovoSeven group and 1726 women were included in the no NovoSeven 
group. In the RCT, 9 women in the reference group also received NovoSeven (8 women on a 
compassionate use basis and 1 woman in error). An overview of the numbers of women with severe PPH 
in the FAS in the RCT and 4 non-interventional studies is presented in Table 17. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics RCT and non-interventional studies 
The eligibility criteria applied in trial 4816 (RCT) facilitated an evaluation of the early use of NovoSeven 
(after failure of sulprostone) in women with severe PPH. The eligibility criteria applied in the 4 non-
interventional studies were broad and reflected populations of women with severe PPH in clinical practise.  
An overview of demographic and baseline characteristics for women with severe PPH across the different 
clinical data sources is presented in Table 17. Not all characteristics are available for each study due to 
the different anonymisation/pseudonymisation requirements and data collection specifications for the 
individual studies. 
•  Causes of PPH across data sources varied with 11.9−31.0% of women having multiple causes. 
Overall, the most common primary causes of PPH were uterine atony and AIP, but a substantial 
proportion of women in study 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR) had a missing cause of PPH. 
• 
• 
In the RCT, there was an approximately even distribution on mode of delivery (caesarean or vaginal); 
while across the non-interventional studies (except for the NL cohort of study 4733 (PPH consortium)) 
more women tended to have caesarean delivery (range 46.0−76.9%) than vaginal delivery. 
Timing of NovoSeven administration: Women in the non-interventional studies were in a more severe 
or more progressed condition at the time of NovoSeven administration than women in the RCT. In the 
RCT, women with severe PPH could be included in the trial if sulprostone had failed to control their 
bleeding after 60 minutes, or a shorter period if the anaesthetist’s subjective assessment was that 
the PPH was not controlled following use of sulprostone. In the non-interventional studies, the median 
(IQR) time from onset of severe PPH to first dose of NovoSeven ranged from 127.5 (71.0−290.5) 
minutes in study 4729 (Bern) to 291.0 (160.0−525.0) minutes in study 4732 (ANZHR).

Invasive procedures (project endpoint) 
Population of women with or without any previous invasive procedure, except hysterectomy, 
prior to NovoSeven administration: 
In trial 4816 (RCT), the proportion of women at risk with any invasive procedure, 50% of women 
underwent an invasive procedure after NovoSeven treatment. In the non-interventional studies, a similar 
or lower proportion of women at risk had an invasive procedure after receiving NovoSeven.  
An overview across the RCT and 4 non-interventional studies of the occurrence of any invasive procedure 
(project endpoint) after NovoSeven administration for women in the FAS at risk of invasive procedure is 
presented in Figure 9:

Population of women without any invasive procedure prior to NovoSeven administration: 
In trial 4816 (RCT), in the population of women without any prior invasive procedure, the number of 
women with an invasive procedure after NovoSeven administration was 51%.  
In non-interventional studies, these proportions varied between 64% and 25%.  
In table 18, the outcome of the proportion of women requiring an invasive procedure after NovoSeven 
administration analysed in both populations is presented:

Data on occurrence of any invasive procedure was captured after randomisation for trial 4816 (RCT), for the period 
between 20 minutes to 24 hours after time0 (i.e., after concurrent period) in studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH 
consortium) or after first NovoSeven administration in 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR).

b Project endpoint’ was evaluated for a subpopulation of women from the population at risk who did not receive any 
invasive procedure before first NovoSeven administration across all the non-interventional studies except for study 
4733 (PPH consortium-DK and NL cohort), where it was defined as women who did not receive any invasive procedure 
before the concurrent period.  
c For trial 4816 (RCT), the updated numbers for the ‘project endpoint’ are presented by addressing for the woman in 
the NovoSeven group who underwent ligation prior to NovoSeven administration but was counted to have an invasive 
procedure following NovoSeven dose (see Section 1.4.7.3 for details). 
d Project endpoint’ was evaluated post hoc for this subpopulation of woman without any invasive procedure before first 
NovoSeven administration.

Pivotal data from trial 4816 (RCT)  
Invasive procedures (project endpoint) 
Trial 4816 (RCT) provides pivotal evidence for the efficacy of NovoSeven in the treatment of severe PPH. 
There was a 44.7% relative reduction in risk of invasive procedure after randomisation for the NovoSeven 
group compared to the reference group (21/42 vs 38/42 women; p<0.0001) (Table 19).  
Similar results were observed for the subpopulation of women without any invasive procedure before 
randomisation, with a relative reduction in risk of 43.4% for the NovoSeven group compared to the 
reference group (21/41 vs 38/42 women; p<0.0001, see Table 18.

(p=0.1944). 
Non-interventional studies 
• 
• 
The proportions of women at risk having an invasive procedure following first NovoSeven dose from 
study 4733 (PPH consortium) were similar to the proportions noted in the RCT, ranging between 
41.7% to 55.0% across the 3 cohorts (DK 55%, NL 50%, and UK 41.7%).  
Proportions of women at risk having an invasive procedure following first NovoSeven dose were lower 
in the other 3 non interventional studies to the proportions noted in the RCT, varying between 20.5% 
to 29.7% (Bern 20.5%, UniSeven 23.3%, ANZHR 29.7%).  
•  A similar pattern was also observed for the subpopulation of women without any invasive procedure 
prior to NovoSeven administration (Table 18), except for this subpopulation in the DK cohort from 
study 4733 (PPH consortium), in which women 64% of women underwent an invasive procedure 
following first dose of NovoSeven. 
Summary of separate study results of non-interventional studies: 
Studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium) 
•  Study 4729 (Bern) 
In study 4729 (Bern), 39/52 women treated with NovoSeven in the FAS were at risk of further invasive 
procedures after NovoSeven administration. Of these, 20.5% (8/39) had an invasive procedure after the 
concurrent period (post hoc summary). 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022

For those women in the FAS without any invasive procedure prior to or concurrent with first NovoSeven 
administration, 16.7% (2/12) had an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hours after first 
NovoSeven administration.  
•  Study 4733 (PPH consortium) 
In study 4733 (PPH consortium), 62/90 women treated with NovoSeven in the FAS across all 3 countries 
were at risk of further invasive procedures after NovoSeven administration. Of these, 50.0% (31/62) 
women had an invasive procedure after the concurrent period (post hoc summary). 
For those women in the FAS without any invasive procedure prior to or concurrent with first NovoSeven 
administration, 64% (9/14 DK), 50% (11/22 NL), and 50% (5/10 UK) had an invasive procedure between 
20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven administration.  
Studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR)  
•  Study 4731 (UniSeven) 
In study 4731 (UniSeven), for those women in the FAS at risk of further invasive procedure, 23.3% 
(10/43) had an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven administration.  
For those women in the FAS without any invasive procedure prior to or concurrent with first NovoSeven 
administration, 27.8% (10/36) had an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hours after first 
NovoSeven administration.  
•  4732 (ANZHR)  
In study 4732 (ANZHR), for those women in the FAS at risk of further invasive procedure, 29.7% (22/74) 
had an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven administration (Figure 
9).  
For those women in the FAS without any invasive procedure prior to first NovoSeven administration, 
35.0% (21/60) had an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven 
administration. 
Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations  
The MAH has presented a separate analysis of dose and dose frequency used and an overview of the dose 
recommendations for NovoSeven in the treatment of severe PPH used in all studies.  
RCT single dose study 
In the pivotal evidence, trial 4816 (RCT), a single target dose of 60 μg/kg NovoSeven was chosen. This 
rhuFVIIa dose was, according to literature data, the lowest dose with clinical effect in the setting of 
severe PPH and was chosen to reduce, as far as possible, the thrombotic risk associated with this drug. 
However, there was some variation around the target dose due to full vials being administered. The 
median NovoSeven dose administered in the RCT trial was 58 µg/kg, with 25 women receiving <60 µg/kg 
dose, 17 women receiving 60-90 μg/kg dose and none receiving >90 µg/kg (Table 20).  
Non-interventional studies 
In contrast, based on the FAS from the non-interventional studies, it was observed that physicians often 
administered higher NovoSeven doses, as indicated from median first dose of 63 μg/kg to 105 μg/kg. 
Furthermore, in some cases more than one dose was administered. Proportion of women who received ≥2 
doses of NovoSeven was between 11.5% and 27.6% across the non-interventional studies. The majority 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 69/120 
 
 
 
 
 
of the women in study 4729 (Bern) received a NovoSeven dose of 60-90 μg/kg (71.2%); whilst the other 
2 non interventional studies, 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR), had most patients in the >90 µg/kg 
dose interval (Table 20). 
The non-interventional studies showed administration of higher doses of NovoSeven and some women 
were administered more than one dose. These dose intervals were selected based on the dosing 
recommendations found in various guidelines (see table 1). For studies 4729 (Bern), 4731 (UniSeven), 
and 4732 (ANZHR), data on clinical outcome of invasive procedures (‘project endpoint’) are provided here 
for the population at risk in the FAS (Table 20). Data from study 4733 (PPH consortium) are not 
presented as information on dose per kg body weight was not available; however, the median total dose 
of NovoSeven was 5 mg (corresponding to 71 µg/kg in a woman weighing 70 kg. 
First dose 
The proportion of women receiving a first dose of NovoSeven of <60 µg/kg, 60−90 µg/kg and >90 µg/kg 
varied across data sources. The 60−90 µg/kg dose range was administered to between 19.5% and 71.2% 
of women by trial/study.  
Second and third dose (median) 
In the non-interventional studies, median second and third doses in the FAS for those women who 
received more than one dose ranged from 73 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg across studies, and were therefore 
broadly similar to first dose in these studies (63 µg/kg to 105 µg/kg). 
In the literature review, most women received a single dose of NovoSeven. Doses usually ranged 
between 50 and 100 μg/kg.

In trial 4816 (RCT), on administration of target NovoSeven single dose of 60 μg/kg (median dose: 58 
µg/kg), there was significant reduction in risk of invasive procedures (‘project endpoint’) after 
randomisation in the NovoSeven group compared to the reference group (relative reduction = 44.7%; 
p<0.0001). 
For the non-interventional studies, data on invasive procedures (‘project endpoint’) for different dose 
intervals of the first NovoSeven dose, i.e., <60 µg/kg, 60 90 µg/kg, and >90 µg/kg are presented in 
Table 21. The groups cannot be directly compared due to lack of randomisation to different dose groups. 
It was observed that for women who received a first dose of 60-90 μg/kg, 0% to 33.3% received an 
invasive procedure after the first administration of NovoSeven, which was numerically lower than for the 
group of women that received a first dose of <60 μg/kg. 
This is in line with the median first dose of NovoSeven administered across data sources (58 µg/kg to 105 
μg/kg) and it would also be aligned with clinical practice of using entire vials; for example, for a 70 kg 
patient (approximate median weight of women across presented data sources), one 5 mg vial would 
correspond to 71 µg/kg.

Rationale for posology of NovoSeven in severe PPH  
The recommended posology for NovoSeven for the currently approved indications (except for factor VII 
deficiency) is an initial dose of 90 µg/kg with further injections administered approximately every 2−3 
hours, depending on indication, to secure haemostasis.  
The proposed posology for NovoSeven in severe PPH is an initial dose of 60–90 µg/kg body weight 
administered by intravenous bolus injection. Peak coagulant activity can be expected at 10 minutes. A 
second dose can be administered based on clinical response of the individual patient. It is recommended 
that in case of insufficient haemostatic response, a second dose can be administered after 30 minutes. 
Efficacy by first dose 
In trial 4816 (RCT), where a single planned dose of approximately 60 μg/kg NovoSeven was 
administered, there was a significant reduction in risk of invasive procedures (project endpoint; post hoc 
analysis of the population at risk) in the NovoSeven group compared to the reference group (relative 
reduction = 44.7%; p<0.0001; Table 19).  
For three non-interventional studies (Bern, UniSeven, ANZHR), data on the project endpoint are 
presented by dose interval for the population at risk in Table 21, see above. Between 0% and 33.3% of 
women in the 60−90 μg/kg dose interval received an invasive procedure.  
TEs by dose 
In the RCT and non-interventional studies, TEs were reported in 7 women treated with NovoSeven across 
the dose range. The doses of NovoSeven were 32, 55, 104 and 125 µg/kg for 4 women, 3.6 and 5 mg for 
2 women (where bodyweight was unknown; assuming a bodyweight of 70 kg, these doses equate to 51 
and 71 µg/kg) and not available for 1 woman. Six of the 7 women with TEs received a single dose of 
NovoSeven; number of doses was not available for 1 woman (dose was recorded as 3.6 mg).  
There was no evidence of a pattern of association between dose size and TEs. 
Dose range 60−90 µg/kg recommendation 
The proposed dose range for NovoSeven in severe PPH is 60−90 µg/kg. This dose range is based on the 
doses used in the RCT and non-interventional studies and on treatment guidelines on use of NovoSeven 
in PPH, which generally recommend 60 µg/kg, 90 µg/kg, or 60−90 µg/kg (see PPH guidelines Table 2). 
Across the data sources in this submission, there was no evidence of a pattern of association between 
dose size and TEs in women with severe PPH. The proposed dose range is also aligned with the current 
off-label use of NovoSeven where physicians usually prescribe doses higher than that used in RCT trial 
4816 (60 µg/kg). The proposed dose range of 60−90 µg/kg provides flexibility for physicians to adjust 
the dose according to individual patient need and is consistent with the clinical practice of using entire 
vials which leads to some variation in the µg/kg dose.  
Timing of NovoSeven relative to other interventions  
Evidence from already approved indications in various clinical settings indicates that NovoSeven should be 
given as early as possible after the start of a bleeding episode (SmPC NovoSeven). The same principle 
applies in severe PPH, where women with massive ongoing haemorrhage and associated complications 
(such as dilutional coagulopathy) benefit from early intervention. For women with severe PPH, the key 
goal of treatment is to stop bleeding as soon as possible to limit the risk to life and reduce the need for 
hysterectomy, which can be life-changing.  
Trial 4816 (RCT) demonstrated that administration of NovoSeven early in the treatment cascade (after 
failure of uterotonics and before any invasive procedure) was effective in reducing the risk of invasive 
procedures and in reducing duration of bleeding.  
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 72/120 
 
 
 
 
In the non-interventional studies, NovoSeven was used at the treating physician’s discretion and was 
used at different timepoints in the treatment cascade (before, during or after invasive procedure). 
NovoSeven was generally used later in the course of PPH in the non-interventional studies than in the 
RCT. In the non-interventional studies, median time from start of severe PPH to NovoSeven 
administration was between 127.5 and 291.0 minutes (Table 17), whereas in the RCT, NovoSeven was 
administered within 60 minutes after start of PPH. 
Together, the RCT and non-interventional studies showed that there were no safety concerns with either 
early or later use of NovoSeven.  
Although the non-interventional studies (with their inherent limitations) did not show a reduction in the 
occurrence of invasive procedures when NovoSeven was used later in the course of PPH, the MAH 
believes that, given the lack of safety concerns, timing of NovoSeven should not be limited to early in the 
treatment cascade and should be at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Rationale for repeat dosing  
The course of severe PPH varies considerably from patient to patient and, while a single dose of 
NovoSeven may be sufficient for most patients, it may be necessary to repeat the dose to gain control of 
bleeding for some patients. Most of the PPH treatment guidelines that offer advice on the use of 
NovoSeven recommend 1 to 2 doses, with one set of guidelines (Bern 2018) recommending up to 3 
doses. 
In the non-interventional studies, most women received a single dose of NovoSeven. Repeat dosing of 
NovoSeven was observed in the non-interventional studies for between 11.5% and 27.6% of women 
across the studies. A small proportion of women in study 4731 (4/87 women; 4.6%) and study 4732 
(12/166 women; 7.2%) received 3 or more doses (Table 20). 
Based on this information, it is proposed that a second dose of NovoSeven can be administered if control 
of bleeding is not achieved with the first dose. 
Timing of repeat dosing  
The proposed label will recommend that a second dose can be given after 30 minutes if bleeding has not 
been controlled by the first dose. This increases the effect of NovoSeven in the short term. The proposed 
30-minute interval allows time for clinical assessment of the haemostatic effect of the first dose. Dose 
interval should be based on clinical response and adapted to the individual patient.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main efficacy data for this type II application to extend the indication with treatment of severe PPH 
consisted of pivotal data are provided from 1 French open-label RCT (trial 4816) sponsored by Nîmes 
University Hospital and conducted in 2 countries (France: 7 University hospital sites, Switzerland: 1 site) 
the trial is published in 2015 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jth.12844  
The pivotal data is supported with observational evidence from 4 non-interventional studies based from a 
single hospital centre in Bern (study 4729), national-level data from 3 countries (PPH consortium study 
4733) and data from 2 registries covering 3 countries describing off-label use of NovoSeven, including 
treatment of PPH (studies 4731 and 4732). 
Support for the recommended dose regimen in this new indication was collected from the RCT trial and 
supportive data from non-interventional studies. 
For trial 4816 (RCT), study 4729 (Bern) and study 4731 (UniSeven), the MAH had access to 
anonymised/pseudonymised patient-level data and performed descriptive and statistical analyses of the 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 73/120 
 
 
 
 
data as relevant. For study 4733 (PPH consortium) and study 4732 (ANZHR), descriptive and statistical 
analyses were performed by academic institutions (Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden 
University Medical Center and Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, 
respectively) based on patient-level data. These academic institutions then provided population-level data 
to the MAH for reporting purposes. Based on these patient-level data, an analysis was made of a common 
primary endpoint, i.e. project endpoint. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Pivotal evidence 
Pivotal RCT 4816 
Of note, in the publication of this RCT, an extended primary objective and primary endpoint were 
selected, i.e. the number of specific second-line therapies is increased with at least one ligation, suture, 
embolisation, intra-uterine balloon tamponade and/or hysterectomy. Although, the CSR is the leading 
document, in this case, the CHMP considered that the data of the publication provide additional 
supportive information, and therefore the results as described in the publication are taken into account. It 
should be noted that while the protocol primary endpoint was predefined, the publication primary 
endpoint was defined post hoc, and therefore should be viewed as exploratory. 
Study design 
This was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group trial with a randomisation ratio of 1:1. A 
total of 84 women with severe PPH receiving standard of care were randomised to treatment with 
NovoSeven or to no concurrent treatment (reference), following failure of sulprostone to control the 
bleeding. The rationale of the investigators that the emergency conditions of obstetrical haemorrhage 
onsets did not allow for a double-blind design are agreed. Both groups received standard of care 
treatment in accordance with the treatment guidelines in place at the time of the trial, which is 
considered acceptable. 
Of note, NovoSeven was administrated in addition to standard of care not as a replacement for any part 
of the conventional standard of care for severe PPH. 
The 60 μg/kg NovoSeven selected dose in the RCT in the treatment of severe PPH was not based on a 
formal dose response study, but was, according to literature data, the lowest dose with clinical effect in 
the setting of severe PPH and was chosen to reduce, as far as possible, the thrombotic risk associated 
with this drug. This is considered acceptable for this setting. 
Standard of care was given according to French practice guidelines of which first-line therapies for PPH 
included: fluid resuscitation, bladder catheterization, manual removal of retained placenta, genital tract 
examination, uterine exploration, oxytocin (20–30 IU every 10–30 min) and finally one sulprostone 
infusion (500 μg within 1 h). 
The following replacement therapies were allowed in the study: 
Fibrinogen concentrates were administered if the plasma fibrinogen concentration was <1 g/L.  
Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were indicated if patient’s Hb concentration was <8 g/dL.  
Platelet concentrates (PC) were administered when the platelet count was lower than 50 x 109/L. 
• 
• 
• 
•  Use of tranexamic acid (TXA) (0.5–1 g intravenously) was left to the attending physician’s discretion.  
•  Vascular volume expansion was achieved using 500 mL of crystalloid and 500 mL of colloid expander 
for the first litre of blood loss, and thereafter an infusion, mostly of gelatine, was administered to 
compensate for the subsequent blood loss (vol/vol).  
• 
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was infused by the attending anaesthetist, if clinically indicated. 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 74/120 
 
 
 
 
Based on the description of first line therapies, replacement therapies and second line invasive therapies 
applied, the management of severe PPH in this study in general is in agreement with current guidelines 
on PPH.  
Study participants 
The enrolment criterion was sulprostone failure 1 h after the infusion onset (or before the end of this 
period). Key inclusion criteria were women who delivered their babies after the end of the 27th week of 
amenorrhoea with severe primary PPH defined as more than 1500 mL blood loss within 24 h after birth; 
key exclusion criterion was a history of thromboembolic events. The follow-up period after delivery was 5 
days. 
Efficacy endpoints (protocol and publication endpoint) 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the RCT study protocol and the primary endpoint applied in the 
publication varied in the selection of invasive procedures. Both selected the absolute and relative 
reduction in need of specific second-line invasive therapies, but the protocol endpoint was more 
restrictive with including only a reduction in the rate of embolisation and/or ligation, while in the 
publication a reduction in the need all relevant invasive procedures were taken into account ((at least one 
ligation, suture, embolisation, intra-uterine balloon tamponade and/or hysterectomy). The publication 
endpoint is considered supportive for the protocol-defined endpoint and has added value from a clinical 
point of view.  
The RCT protocol did not select secondary endpoints, while in the publication secondary endpoints 
included the number (percentage) of patients in each arm who received PRBCs, FFP units or PC; all 
replacement treatments (infusion of colloids/crystalloids, transfusions of blood components, and 
additional procoagulant treatments such as TXA, fibrinogen concentrates and aprotinin), and biological 
measures were collected before delivery and within the first 12 h after PPH. While not pre-specified, these 
are considered of additional value as these reflect the background conditions of the patients treated in 
both arms. The secondary endpoints were: 
• 
• 
Time point of evaluation of treatment success: Bleeding was considered to have stopped (i.e., 
treatment success) if the estimated blood flow decreased to less than 50 mL per 10 min within the 30 
min following randomization.  
Initiation invasive second line treatment was started at any time and in both arms, invasive second-
line treatments were considered if bleeding was uncontrolled (blood flow higher than 50 mL per 10 
min) or intractable (defined as PPH > 2500 mL, or blood flow > 500 mL per 30 min, or haemorrhagic 
shock refractory to standard care). 
Assumptions for the sample size calculation were based on public literature indicating that in the 
reference group the expected rate of embolization or surgical procedure, such as vascular ligature, is 
approximately 70% (Lédée et al, 2001, Mignon et al, 2004; Aledort et al, 2004; Tourné G et al, 2003). 
The investigators focused on a 30% absolute decrease in the embolization or vascular ligature rate based 
on their limited inclusion capacities, i.e. a 40% rate when rFVIIa is administered early after the 
conventional medical treatment. In order to show a statistically significant difference with a 5% bilateral 
risk and an 80% power, 42 patients were required in each group. The assumed treatment effect of 30% 
is considered acceptable, as well as the sample size calculation. 
The statistical methods contained only a general description in the protocol and no statistical analysis 
plan. There is no multiplicity adjustment and therefore no type I error control for secondary analyses.  
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 75/120 
 
 
 
 
 
As acknowledged by the MAH, there was no separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) prepared by the trial 
sponsor (Nîmes Univeristy Hospital). In the absence of any further statistical documentation, the protocol 
is the only source of analysis specification. As a consequence, any analysis that was not described in the 
original protocol should be considered post-hoc and viewed as exploratory. This would for example apply 
to the publication primary endpoint, or the project endpoint. 
Nevertheless, study design is relatively simple and analysis straightforward. The analysis sets and the 
statistical analysis of the endpoints of the study protocol, using Chi-square statistics, and publication, 
using Mantel-Haenszel, are considered standard and acceptable. 
Of note, pivotal study 4816 was conducted during the period of 2007-2010, main results were published 
in 2015, and the data cut-off date for this application was on 14 April 2021.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient flow 
As planned, a total of 84 women with severe PPH were included in this trial; 42 patients were randomised 
to the NovoSeven group and 42 patients to the reference group. All women were considered to have 
completed the trial, that is, completed treatment for PPH.  
Sixty patients were included 1 h after sulprostone infusion. Among the 24 remaining patients, the median 
randomization time (lower quartile–upper quartile) was 40 min (30–45 min) for the intervention arm and 
30 min (30–30 min) for the standard care arm (P = 0.93). These results indicate that it is manageable to 
provide this treatment within a certain time frame despite the serious circumstances of this possibly life 
threatening condition. Two important protocol deviations were identified from the available monitoring 
reports. One woman in the reference group did not meet the inclusion criteria (she had already responded 
to sulprostone), and one woman in the NovoSeven group had ligation performed prior to NovoSeven 
injection, which was not noted by the investigators. In addition, one woman was randomised to the 
reference group, but received NovoSeven due to an error in reading the randomisation envelope. In the 
post-hoc analysis of the MAH, the patient with a ligation prior to NovoSeven administration has been 
taken into account. 
Demographics and disease characteristics 
Generally, the recruited patients reflect a hospital population of women with severe PPH regarding 
demographics, and patient characteristics, and causes of severe PPH, with the majority due to atony, are 
well distributed across the two treatment groups. There is a comparable distribution of patients who had 
vaginal delivery and caesarean section, with no relevant differences between groups in delivery mode. 
There were only minor imbalances between the randomised groups for some baseline characteristics 
(age, multiple causes of PPH, fibrinogen level, RBC transfusions). 
Primary efficacy analyses 
In the protocol primary efficacy analysis of at least one embolization and/or ligation, fewer patients  
(50%, n=21/42) in the NovoSeven group had at least one embolisation and/or ligation procedure, 
compared to patients in the standard care group (83%, n=35/42), RR = 0.60 (0.43;0.84), corresponding 
with a statistically significant 40% relative reduction in risk compared to the reference group; p=0.0012). 
The mean number of patients who needed to be treated with NovoSeven (number needed to treat, NNT) 
to avoid one ligation or embolization was 3. 
In the publication primary efficacy analysis of the post-hoc, composite endpoint of ligation, suture, 
embolization, balloon and/or hysterectomy, fewer patients (52%, n=22/42)) in the NovoSeven group 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 76/120 
 
 
 
 
required an invasive procedure compared to patients in the standard care group (93%, n= 39/42, RR = 
0.56; 95% CI, 0.42–0.76), corresponding with a 44% relative reduction in risk compared to the reference 
group; nominal p<0.001). The mean number of patients who needed to be treated with NovoSeven 
(number needed to treat, NNT) to avoid one composite endpoint was 2.6. In both analysis, this effect was 
independent from the delivery mode (vaginal delivery or caesarian section). 
Based on the results of both analyses, a significant and clinically relevant beneficial effect has been 
shown that with early infusion of one single rhuFVIIa dose after sulprostone failure the need for specific 
second-line interventions can be reduced from 93% (in the standard of care arm) to 52% (absolute 
difference of 41%). This was further supported by the low number of NNT to avoid at least one second-
line therapy of 2.6 and 3. Further, this positive effect was independent from the delivery mode (caesarian 
section or vaginal delivery).  
In the reference group, the rate of embolization or surgical procedure in Study 4816 was 83% and 93% 
according to protocol and project primary endpoint respectively, which were higher than that initially 
expected: 70% derived from literature (Lédée et al, 2001, Mignon et al, 2004; Aledort et al, 2004; 
Tourné G et al, 2003) (cf sample size calculation).  
Supportive evidence from non-interventional studies 
Data from four non-interventional studies were collected from information of routine clinical practice to 
provide supportive data to the pivotal evidence, trial 4816 (RCT). In these non-interventional studies, use 
of NovoSeven was more varied than its early use, after failure of sulprostone, in study 4816 (RCT), with 
physicians choosing to administer NovoSeven at different timepoints in the treatment cascade of PPH, 
both in women who already had an invasive procedure and those without any previous invasive 
procedure. Two non-interventional studies, study 4729 (Bern) and study 4733 (PPH consortium), included 
both women treated with NovoSeven and women not treated with NovoSeven; whilst the other two non-
interventional studies (registries), i.e. study 4731(UniSeven) and study 4732 (ANZHR), only included 
women treated with NovoSeven. The efficacy results of these studies are discussed below. 
Due to substantial differences in terms of inclusion criteria, dose, timing of NovoSeven administration, 
severity of PPH, standard of care associated, data collection methods, etc., all these non-interventional 
studies are considered exploratory in nature when comparing and interpreting the results. 
Study 4729 (Bern) the study design was a single-centre, non-interventional retrospective cohort study 
of women with severe PPH who were treated with NovoSeven or other standard of care at the department 
of obstetrics and gynaecology of the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland during the period of January 
2006 to April 2016. Data for the current study included women with severe PPH from 4 cohorts (2 
historical cohorts, 1 prospective study cohort and a new cohort), through review of medical patient chart 
and electronical medical records. Inclusion criterion was severe PPH defined as continuous bleeding of at 
least 1500 mL within 24 hours after delivery, while exclusion criteria were none. Duration of follow-up: 
from time of diagnosis of severe PPH (including baseline data) until end of hospitalisation. The 
recommended dose in the 2 historical cohorts was 60 µg/kg or at discretion of the physician, while the 
more recent cohorts followed hospital guidance, 60 µg/kg and 90 µg/kg.  
The primary objective was to compare, in a propensity score matched population of women with severe 
PPH, the occurrence of any invasive procedure after first treatment with NovoSeven with the occurrence 
of any invasive procedure without treatment with NovoSeven evaluated within a timeframe of 20 minutes 
to 24 hours following first administration of NovoSeven. Invasive procedures are defined as: uterine or 
iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression sutures, or hysterectomy. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the “occurrence of any invasive procedure in the period from 20 
minutes to 24 hours following time0 (was defined as time of first administration of NovoSeven) among 
women who were at risk of further invasive procedures”. For matched controls: time0 was derived from 
Novoseven II/116 -

the matching process and was equal to the period from onset of severe PPH to time of first administration 
of NovoSeven for the patient for whom she was a matched control).  
Statistical methods NovoSeven exposed women were compared to their matched controls by the method 
of propensity score (PS) matching. The purpose of propensity score matching was to counteract the 
natural imbalance (confounding by indication) present between women exposed and not exposed to 
NovoSeven in the FAS from these real world data sources. A PS score was estimated for each woman by 
a Cox proportional hazard regression model with NovoSeven as the dependent variable. In general, using 
PS matching is an acceptable approach in the analysis of 2 observational datasets. Women were matched 
within delivery mode, and variables included in the final model were cumulative RBC, cumulative blood 
loss, cumulative number of invasive procedures including balloon, cumulative FFP and cumulative 
crystalloids and colloids. The matching on delivery mode, and selection of variables are considered 
adequate. However, the proposed estimand and study populationis not completely endorsed. Matched 
control patients can receive NovoSeven after their matching date and although this would lead to a bias 
towards the null and can be considered conservative, it is unclear whether it gives a realistic view on the 
effect of NovoSeven. Furthermore, matched control patients could be re-used as case patients as well, if 
they indeed received NovoSeven at a later timepoint.  
Results: A total of 165 women were included in the Bern University hospital database of which 52 women 
received NovoSeven and 113 women did not receive NovoSeven. Of these, 18 NovoSeven exposed 
women were compared to 43  matched controls by the method of PS matching. Participants in PS set in 
both the groups were broadly similar with regard to different patient characteristics, though some 
differences were noted with regard to proportions of women with singleton and women with uterine atony 
as primary cause of PPH. The median first dose was 63 µg/kg, the median second dose was 73 µg/kg.  
Outcome primary analysis: In the PS analysis set, among women who were at risk of further invasive 
procedures, 16.7% (3/18) of NovoSeven exposed women had an invasive procedure in the period from 
20 minutes to 24 hours following time0 compared to 31.5% (5.6/17.8) of matched controls, with an odds 
ratio of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.03, 1.75) numerically favouring NovoSeven, but this difference was not 
statistically significant (p=0.2691). Further, the applied method for collection of matched control patients 
was prone to bias and matched controls could be re-used as case patients. Thus the data in the analysis 
is not always independent. This hampers the interpretation of results and the study can therefore only be 
regarded as supportive at most.  
Study 4733 (PPH consortium) the study design was a retrospective non-interventional cohort study of 
women with severe PPH who were treated with NovoSeven or other standard of care. The study utilised 
retrospective data that were collected for other purposes from three previously established cohorts in DK, 
NL and UK. From these cohorts women with severe PPH were selected. Inclusion criteria for severe PPH 
were ≥10 or more units of RBC within 24 hours after birth (DK), ≥4 units of RBC, multicomponent blood 
transfusion (RBC and fresh frozen plasma and/or platelet concentrates), plasma in addition to RBCs (NL), 
women who had a birth received ≥8 units of RBC transfused within 24 hours (UK). Exclusion criteria were 
none. The NovoSeven dose used in these patients with severe PPH was at the discretion of the physician 
and as per the local clinical practice. Duration of follow-up was up to 6 months from delivery for the DK 
cohort, from delivery up to discharge or death for the UK cohorts and from delivery to end of bleeding for 
the NL cohort. Data analyses were performed at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology of the Leiden 
University Medical Center. This study protocol and analysis plan were developed by Novo Nordisk.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint selected and applied statistical analysis based on PS matching were similar to 
study 4729 (Bern), see above. These were collected from the DK and NL cohorts, PS matching could not 
be done for the UK cohort due to lack of time varying data. Similar to study 4729 (Bern), matched 
controls were allowed to receive NovoSeven after the matching date, and these same patients could be 
re-used as case patients in the analysis. Thus the data in the analysis is not always independent. This 
hampers the interpretation of results.

Results Based on final PS model, 40 NovoSeven exposed women were matched to 115 controls (matched 
controls) and were included in the PS analysis set for the DK plus NL cohort. Participants in PS set in both 
the groups were broadly similar with regard to different patient characteristics. Dose: Median NovoSeven 
first dose was slightly higher in NL (6 mg) than in DK (5 mg).  
Outcome primary analysis: Among women who were at risk of further invasive procedures, 57.9% 
(22/38) of NovoSeven exposed women had an invasive procedure in the period from 20 minutes to 
24 hours following time0 compared to 35.1% (13.3/38) of matched controls, with an odds ratio of 2.46 
(95% CI: 1.06, 5.99; p=0.0355) favouring matched controls. The results of this PS analysis did not 
favour NovoSeven, further, the applied method for collection of matched control patients was prone to 
bias and matched controls could be re-used as case patients. Thus the data in the analysis is not always 
independent. This hampers the interpretation of results.   
Study 4731 (UniSeven) Study design: retrospective cohort study describing the off-label use of 
NovoSeven and clinical outcomes in Czech women with severe PPH. The study utilised data from the 
UniSeven registry, which captured off-label use of NovoSeven non-haemophiliac patients for multiple 
conditions during the period July 2003 to April 2014. Inclusion criterion: Czech women treated with 
NovoSeven due to severe PPH, defined as ≥1,500 mL blood loss within the period of 24h after delivery, 
registered in UniSeven; exclusion criteria were none. The NovoSeven dose was at the discretion of the 
treating physician. The post-hoc defined, alternative primary efficacy endpoint was similar to those used 
in both comparative cohort studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH consortium). Statistical methods: 
Evaluation of data was based upon descriptive statistics. 
Results A total of the 993 Czech patients were registered with UniSeven registry during July 2003 to April 
2014. Of these, 87 fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having ≥1,500 mL blood loss within 24 hours prior to 
first dose of NovoSeven administration and were included in the FAS. Of these women, 44 women were 
excluded from the primary endpoint analysis due to a hysterectomy performed before or concurrent with 
NovoSeven administration. Thus, the population at risk of further invasive procedures included 43 
women. The population for primary analysis included women who did not have any invasive procedure 
before or concurrent with NovoSeven administration comprised of 36 women. Dose: not specified for the 
population selected for the primary efficacy analysis. Outcome of the post-hoc defined, alternative, 
primary analysis: Of the 36 women selected, 27.8% (10/36) had and 72.2% (26/36) did not have an 
invasive procedure within 20 minutes to 24 hours after first NovoSeven administration. However, results 
are not interpretable in the absence of an adequate control and no information on dose in relation to 
efficacy is available, except that it fell within the range of 50-200 μg/kg as recorded for the FAS. 
Study 4732 (ANZHR) Study design: retrospective cohort study describing the clinical use of NovoSeven 
and clinical outcomes in women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven utilising data collected 
from the Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR). The ANZHR recorded data on 
various off-label uses of NovoSeven in non-haemophilic patients at participating hospitals throughout 
Australia and New Zealand, including its use in obstetric haemorrhage during the period 2000-2009. 
Inclusion criterion: treated with NovoSeven due to severe PPH defined as an obstetric case with a 
registration of a delivery in ANZHR, exclusion criteria included a delivery at <24 weeks of gestational age. 
The NovoSeven dose was according to local routine clinical practice at the discretion of the treating 
physician. The study protocol and analysis plan were co-developed by Monash University and Novo 
Nordisk. The primary efficacy endpoint was similar to the original primary endpoint selected in the study 
4731 (UniSeven), see above. Statistical methods: Evaluation of data was based upon descriptive 
statistics. 
Results: Of the 166 women included in the FAS, 92 women were excluded from the primary endpoint 
analysis due to a hysterectomy performed before or concurrent with NovoSeven administration (n=54) or 
a missing timing of an invasive procedure (n=38). Thus, the population at risk of further invasive 
Novoseven II/116 -

procedures included 74 women, for whom 60 women did not have any invasive procedure before first 
NovoSeven administration and were included in the primary analysis. Dose: not specified for the 
population selected for the primary efficacy analysis. Outcome primary analysis: Of the 60 women 
selected, 65.0% (39/60) did not have an invasive procedure within 20 minutes to 24 hours after first 
NovoSeven administration. However, results are not interpretable in the absence of an adequate control 
and no information on dose in relation to efficacy is available, except that fell within the (interquartile) 
range (IQR): 74 - 109 μg/kg. 
Based on the efficacy data provided by the 4 non-interventional studies that utilised retrospective data 
from different cohorts in Europe and Australia/New Zealand the following is concluded: 
• 
• 
The results of the PS analyses failed suggest an effect in favour of NovoSeven with regard to 
reduction in invasive procedures, but the applied method for collection of matched control patients 
was prone to bias and further matched control patients could be re-used as case patients. This 
hampers the interpretation of results. Therefore, these studies can therefore only be regarded as 
supportive at most. 
For the retrospective cohort studies, the results of the analyses utilising data collected from registries 
in the Czech Republic (NovoSeven) and Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) 
are not interpretable in the absence of an adequate control. Also, no adequate information on the 
dose is available. 
Supportive evidence from analyses performed across trials 
Post-hoc analysis of a common primary efficacy endpoint (project endpoint) in RCT and non-
epidemiological studies  
Project endpoint 
To support the regulatory submission for this new indication, the MAH defined a common ‘project 
endpoint’, in accordance with SA from NL and FR and external experts, to evaluate efficacy of 
NovoSeven across the RCT and non-interventional studies. The ‘project endpoint’ was defined as follows: 
“occurrence of any invasive procedure after first treatment with NovoSeven”, where invasive procedure 
was defined as uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression 
sutures, and/or hysterectomy”. To be evaluated within a timeframe of 20 minutes to 24 hours following 
first administration of NovoSeven. 
The project endpoint differs from the protocol primary efficacy endpoint and the publication endpoint of 
the RCT, as in these analyses, only women without previous invasive procedures were included, i.e. 
following failure of sulprostone to control the bleeding. The project endpoint includes also women who 
could have had a previous invasive procedure prior to NovoSeven administration. However, subgroup 
analyses were also presented for those women with no invasive procedure prior to the NovoSeven 
administration, i.e. the primary endpoint applied in the publication of the RCT. This approach to define a 
common endpoint across all available data to further support the RCT with data from the 4 non-
interventional studies that contain additional information on the current off-label use of NovoSeven in 
severe PPH is accepted. However, as is also indicated by the MAH, such approach has its limitations as 
there are distinct differences across the RCT and observational data, including the eligibility criteria, dose 
of NovoSeven applied, number of doses, and timing of NovoSeven administration in the treatment 
cascade. The project point analyses were either prespecified in the SAP (UniSeven, ANZHR) or were 
conducted post hoc (RCT, study 4729 Bern, study PPH consortium). Data sources For trial 4816 (RCT), 
study 4729 (Bern) and study 4731 (UniSeven), the MAH had access to anonymised/pseudonymised 
patient-level data and performed descriptive and statistical analyses. For study 4733 (PPH consortium) 
and study 4732 (ANZHR), analyses were performed by academic institutions (Department of Clinical 
Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center and Department of Epidemiology and Preventive 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 80/120 
 
 
 
 
Medicine, Monash University, respectively) based on patient-level data. These academic institutions then 
provided population-level data to Novo Nordisk for reporting purposes. Patient disposition The analyses of 
the project endpoint were conducted on all exposed women with severe PPH in the FAS who were at risk 
of further invasive procedures after NovoSeven administration. Additionally, analyses of the project 
endpoint were conducted for the subpopulation of women without any invasive procedure before first 
NovoSeven administration (endpoint of the publication of the RCT). 
Statistical methods: For the RCT, the ‘project endpoint’ was analysed post hoc at any time point after 
randomisation until stop of PPH. Analysis for occurrence of hysterectomy was also added. The occurrence 
of invasive procedures and hysterectomy was compared between the NovoSeven and reference group by 
relative risk, risk difference, and relative reduction, with 95% CI. For the non-interventional studies, 
the project endpoint based on the FAS was analysed as per SAP in the two registries, and as a post hoc 
analysis for study 4729 (Bern) and study 4733 (PPH consortium) to have a subgroup aligned with the 
data from studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR). Across the non-interventional studies, the clinical 
outcomes of invasive procedures (‘project endpoint’) were evaluated within a timeframe of 20 minutes to 
24 hours following first administration of NovoSeven. A lag-time of 20 minutes following NovoSeven 
administration was implemented based on inputs from external experts. The rationale for this decision is 
that it would take 10 minutes for NovoSeven to reach peak coagulation ability, to disregard any case 
where the decision for both invasive procedure and NovoSeven was taken concurrently, with the 
execution being short time interval apart and for cases where the decision to perform an invasive 
procedure was taken simultaneously with administration of NovoSeven, NovoSeven would not have had 
sufficient time to be effective. Further, to reflect the decision relating to this 20 minute lag, a concurrent 
period was defined across the non-interventional studies, corresponding to the period between 20 
minutes before and 20 minutes after NovoSeven administration (for studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 
(ANZHR)) or time0 (= time of 1st NovoSeven administration for studies 4729 (Bern) and 4733 (PPH 
consortium). Based on the presented argumentation, the selected time frame can be considered 
acceptable. 
Results: Overall, in the FAS across these clinical data sources (4816, 4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732), a total 
of 437 women were included in the NovoSeven group and 1726 women were included in the no 
NovoSeven group. In the RCT, 9 women in the reference group also received NovoSeven (8 women on a 
compassionate use basis and 1 woman in error). 
• 
• 
In study 4733 (PPH consortium), the proportions of women in the population at risk of further 
invasive procedure in whom an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hour after first 
NovoSeven dose could not be prevented were similar to the proportions noted in the RCT, ranging 
between 41.7% to 55.0% across the 3 cohorts (DK 55%, NL 50%, and UK 41.7%). 
In the three other non-interventional studies, the proportions in the population of women at risk of 
further invasive procedures in whom an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hour after first 
NovoSeven dose could not be prevented were lower to the proportions noted in the RCT, varying 
between 20.5% to 29.7% (Bern 20.5%, UniSeven 23.3%, ANZHR 29.7%). 
A similar pattern was also observed for the subpopulation of women without any invasive procedure prior 
to NovoSeven administration, except for this subpopulation in the DK cohort (64%) from study 4733 (PPH 
consortium): 
• 
In study 4733 (PPH consortium) the proportions in the subpopulation of women without any invasive 
procedure prior to NovoSeven in whom an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hour after 
first NovoSeven dose could not be prevented were 50% in the NL, and 50% in the UK 50% and 
comparable to the percentage in the RCT, while in the DK cohort (64%) the percentage was higher. 
Novoseven II/116 -

• 
In the three other cohorts the proportions in the subpopulation of women without any invasive 
procedure prior to NovoSeven in whom an invasive procedure between 20 minutes to 24 hour after 
first NovoSeven dose could not be prevented were lower than observed in the RCT, 16.7% (Bern 
16.7%, UniSeven 27.8% (UniSeven) and ANZHR 35.0%. 
Based on above, it can be concluded that, as expected, the outcome of analysis of the pivotal data of the 
RCT based on the project point is comparable with the results of the per-protocol (and publication) 
primary efficacy analysis in the RCT. In the non-interventional studies, the analyses based on the project 
endpoint were generally supportive of the results observed in the RCT. However, the general comments 
made with regard to the presented efficacy data from the non-interventional studies also apply to the 
additional analysis of a common project endpoint based on the FAS populations, i.e. these are considered 
of limited value to further support efficacy of NovoSeven in severe PPH. 
Dose selection and dose interval 
The posology for NovoSeven for currently approved indications (except for factor VII deficiency) is an 
initial dose of 90 µg/kg with further injections administered approximately every 2−3 hours, depending 
on indication, to secure haemostasis.  
The proposed posology for the treatment of severe post-partum bleeding is 60 – 90 µg kg body weight 
administered by intravenous bolus injection. Peak coagulant activity can be expected at 10 minutes. A 
second dose can be administered based on clinical response of the individual patient. It is recommended 
that in case of insufficient haemostatic response, a second dose can be administered after 30 minutes.. 
The proposed dose range is based on the doses used in the RCT and non-interventional studies and on 
current treatment guidelines on use of NovoSeven in PPH, which generally recommend 60 µg/kg, 90 
µg/kg, or 60−90 µg/kg. Across the data sources in this submission, there was no suggestion of a dose-
related pattern of risk of TEs in women with severe PPH, which is agreed, though the low number of cases 
and large variation in dose do not allow definite conclusions (see safety section). In the pivotal evidence, 
trial 4816 (RCT), a single target dose of 60 μg/kg NovoSeven was chosen. This rhuFVIIa dose was, 
according to literature data, the lowest dose with clinical effect in the setting of severe PPH and was 
chosen to reduce, as far as possible, the thrombotic risk associated with this drug. There was some 
variation around the target dose due to full vials being administered. The median NovoSeven dose 
administered in the RCT trial was 58 µg/kg, with 25 women receiving <60 µg/kg dose, 17 women 
receiving 60-90 μg/kg dose. In the RCT, the use of this dose range demonstrated a statistical and 
clinically relevant reduction in the need of second line interventions. Therefore, the proposed dose range 
of 60−90 µg/kg is acceptable. In addition, it provides flexibility for physicians to adjust the dose 
according to individual patient need and is consistent with the clinical practice of using entire vials which 
leads to some variation in the µg/kg dose. 
Use of NovoSeven in relation to other interventions: The RCT demonstrated that administration of 
NovoSeven within 60 minutes after start of PPH after failure of uterotonics and before any invasive 
procedure, was effective in reducing the risk of invasive procedures. In the non-interventional studies, 
NovoSeven was generally used later in the course of PPH, i.e. before, during or after invasive procedure, 
with median time from start of severe PPH to NovoSeven administration between 127.5 and 291.0 
minutes. During the evaluation, it was agreed to revise the proposed indication to be in line with the 
population as studied in the RCT: “NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of severe postpartum 
haemorrhage when uterotonics are insufficient to achieve haemostasis”. 
Repeat dosing Most of the PPH treatment guidelines that offer advice on the use of NovoSeven 
recommend 1 to 2 doses, with one set of guidelines (Bern 2018) recommending up to 3 doses. The RCT 
was a single dose study. In the non-interventional studies, most women received a single dose of 
NovoSeven, while repeat dosing of NovoSeven varied between 11.5%-27.6% of women, and in study 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 82/120 
 
 
 
 
4731 4.6% and study 4732 7.2% received 3 or more doses. Based on this information, it is proposed that 
a second dose of NovoSeven can be administered if control of bleeding is not achieved with the first dose.  
Timing of repeat dosing The proposed label recommends that a second dose can be given after 30 
minutes if bleeding has not been controlled by the first dose. This increases the effect of NovoSeven in 
the short term. The proposed 30-minute interval allows time for clinical assessment of the haemostatic 
effect of the first dose. The evidence of non-interventional studies suggest that dose interval varies 
widely. Data from studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR) suggest that a longer dosing interval is 
more common than a short dosing interval. In study 4729 (Bern), median interval between first and 
second dose was shorter, at 40 minutes. PPH treatment guidelines that offer advice on repeat dosing of 
NovoSeven indicate a second dose could be administered 15−30 minutes after the first dose (table 2).  
The rationale for a second dose in case of insufficient response can be accepted. The selected 30 minute 
dose-interval is considered adequately supported by the available pharmacodynamic data of NovoSeven 
indicating time to maximum coagulant effect at 10 minutes after dosing, PPH guidelines recommending a 
second dose 15-30 minutes after the first dose of NovoSeven3,4 as well as the RCT where clinical 
response (evaluation of treatment effect) was evaluated within 30 minutes of NovoSeven administration. 
Considering the different dose recommendations proposed for this indication, i.e. a different dose interval 
of 30 minutes in case of insufficient response, this information is reflected in section 4.2 and section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Finally, a recommendation is also made in section 4.2 of the SmPC that it is recommended that in case of 
insufficient haemostatic response, a second dose can be administered after 30 minutes.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the pivotal evidence of the RCT in patients with severe PPH, a significant and clinically relevant 
40% reduction in need of invasive procedures (ligation or embolisation) was noted on top of standard 
therapy. This is supported by the results for the publication endpoint with a 43% reduction in need of 
invasive procedures extended (at least one ligation, suture, embolisation, intra-uterine balloon 
tamponade and/or hysterectomy). The applied standard of care management is generally in line with the 
recommendations present in most recent guidelines (RCOG 2017).The support for efficacy of Novoseven 
in severe PPH from the 4 non-interventional studies of different sources across Europe and from 
Australia/New Zealand, is very limited. 
Efficacy of haemostatic products such as NovoSeven will be limited when fibrinogen levels or platelet 
count are low. Maintenance of adequate fibrinogen concentration and platelet count is recommended in 
order to optimise the benefit of NovoSeven treatment (see SmPC section 4.2). 
In conclusion, it can be considered sufficiently substantiated that NovoSeven when used early in the 
treatment cascade of PPH could relevantly reduce the risk of an invasive procedure in a target population 
as studied in the RCT. The revised indication reflects the target population as studied in the RCT, i.e. after 
failure of uterotonics and before start of invasive treatment. The selected dose-interval of 30 minutes for 
a second dose in case of insufficient control of bleeding is sufficiently substantiated.

2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of NovoSeven reported in the current indications: 
NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those 
undergoing surgery or invasive procedures in the following patient groups: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX > 5 Bethesda 
Units (BU) 
in patients with congenital haemophilia who are expected to have a high anamnestic response to 
factor VIII or factor IX administration 
in patients with acquired haemophilia 
in patients with congenital FVII deficiency 
in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia with past or present refractoriness to platelet 
transfusions, or where platelets are not readily available. 
Known safety profile in above mentioned indications (extracted from the SmPC of NovoSeven) 
Clinical trials conducted in 484 patients (including 4297 treatment episodes) with haemophilia A and B, 
acquired haemophilia, factor VII deficiency or Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia have shown that adverse 
drug reactions are common (≥1/100 to < 1/10). The most frequent adverse drug reactions are pyrexia 
and rash (uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to < 1/100), and the most serious adverse drug reactions are 
thromboembolic events (venous and arterial thrombo-embolic events). In post-marketing experience, 
there have been no reports of inhibitory antibodies against NovoSeven or FVII in patients with 
haemophilia A or B. Development of inhibitory antibodies to NovoSeven has been reported in a post-
marketing observational registry of patients with congenital FVII deficiency. 
Safety data in support of the new indication of treatment of severe PPH 
Safety data are presented from the RCT and non-interventional studies, literature review and Novo 
Nordisk safety database (Argus). Some women in the RCT and non-interventional studies overlapped with 
the patient population included in the published studies. With overlap taken into account, at least 834 
women were exposed to NovoSeven across the RCT, studies and literature review. 
In support of the assessment of the safety profile of NovoSeven in the requested new indication, i.e. 
NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of severe postpartum haemorrhage, the main focus of the MAH 
is on thromboembolic events (TEs). In the context of the NovoSeven safety profile, TE is an identified 
risk. TEs were captured in the RCT and non-interventional studies, together with other maternal 
outcomes. Other AEs were reported in some studies, but the data were not captured consistently across 
data sources. 
Risk of thromboembolic events in pregnancy and post-partum period 
Pregnancy and the post-partum period is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombo-embolic 
events. Pregnancy is associated with a shift of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems towards 
hypercoagulability, which leads to an increase in the risk of thromboembolic complications during 
pregnancy and the puerperal period. Additionally, many of the clinical conditions associated with PPH are 
known contributing factors for thromboembolic risk (e.g. delivery, severe haemorrhage, transfusions, 
DIC, surgery/invasive procedures and coagulopathy). In the peri- and postpartum period, factors such as 
caesarean section, body mass index >30 kg/m2, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, systemic infection, surgery 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 84/120 
 
 
 
 
and immobilisation in the perioperative period also increase the risk of venous TEs. When compared to 
non-pregnant women, the incidence of venous TEs was significantly higher during the first postpartum 
week, declining rapidly thereafter. Women with obstetric complications are at highest risk of postpartum 
venous TEs, and this risk remains elevated throughout the first 12 weeks after delivery.   
The incidence of TEs in women with PPH in general has been reported to range from <1−7.8% and in 
women with PPH treated with NovoSeven to range from 2.5−4.8% (Bouma et al, 2008; Francini, 2010; 
Abdul Sultan, Blood 2014. 
Rationale MAH for focussing on TEs 
Due to its mechanism of action, promoting the coagulation cascade, there is theoretically an even higher 
risk of TEs when NovoSeven is administered to women who are already in a hypercoagulable state. 
Therefore, the assessment of the safety of NovoSeven in women with severe PPH focussed on TEs, and 
whether there was an increased risk of TEs following NovoSeven administration.   
Given the variation in clinical outcomes used and reported in PPH trials, Meher et al. defined a core 
clinical outcome set for PPH trials, based on a Delphi consensus study (Meher S, et al. Core outcome sets 
for prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage: an international Delphi consensus study, 
BJOG. 2019). One of the core outcomes related to safety in the consensus study was adverse effects 
defined as “number of women (and babies if relevant) with intervention-specific side effects and serious 
adverse effects as considered by triallists as appropriate”. Based on guidance from the Delphi consensus 
study and the safety events captured in clinical data sources, this safety summary focuses on TEs to 
assess safety of NovoSeven in women with severe PPH. 
Data sources 
The MAH presented the following clinical, patient-level data sources: 
1.  Pivotal data for the application are provided from an open-label RCT (trial 4816).  
2.  The pivotal data are supported with observational data derived from 4 non-interventional studies 
based on single hospital level data from a single centre (study 4729), national or population level 
data from 3 countries (study 4733) and 2 registries covering 3 countries describing off-label use of 
NovoSeven (study 4731 and study 4732).  
3.  Supportive data are also provided from the Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) and from a 
literature review (of published clinical studies and case-reports) that report safety data of women with 
severe PPH treated with NovoSeven. 
Trial 4816 (RCT) 
Nîmes University Hospital, France was the sponsor of the randomised clinical trial and was responsible for 
the design, protocol, conduct, and original analysis of trial 4816. Novo Nordisk reproduced the analysis as 
per the protocol and further performed exploratory analysis on data from this study. The clinical trial 
recorded AEs occurring from T0 (time of inclusion in the protocol, pre-dose NovoSeven) up to 5 days after 
T0, as a part of safety assessments. SAEs were reported on the SAE page in the CRF. Death and all 
unexpected symptoms that occurred during the trial or within a maximum period of 5 days postpartum 
(which were life threatening, required extended hospitalisation, or involved injuries or after-effects) were 
considered as a serious adverse event. The occurrence of thrombosis with onset after NovoSeven 
administration was considered an SAE. Appearance of thrombosis was systematically screened based on 
clinical signs and symptoms after delivery, and supplemented, if there was any clinical doubt, with an 
Echo Doppler. This complication was treated with the appropriate intensive care measures.

Study (Bern) 
This non-interventional study was based on original database collected at University Hospital of Bern, 
Switzerland, of women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven or other standard of care. This study 
included data on 4 cohorts, of which part of the data covering the first 3 cohorts (historical cohort 1 and 
2, and prospective study cohort) has already been published, with the supplemental data of a ‘new 
cohort’ retrospectively collected for the current study from electronic medical records. Additionally, 
information on timing of different interventions for the women in the first 3 cohorts was collected for this 
study. The MAH provided a data collection sheet for capture of study specific data. The data included in 
the study covered the period from hospitalisation for delivery (including baseline data) until the end of 
hospitalisation. The current study was based on data collected retrospectively from medical records of 
women with severe PPH. Only data captured in the medical records concerning TEs, cardiac arrest, 
allergic reactions, haemorrhagic shock, and maternal death occurring until end of follow-up period i.e., 
end of hospitalisation or death, were reported as AEs in the report.  
Study 4733 (PPH consortium)   
This study was based on data collected from 3 previously established cohorts from 3 countries (DK, NL 
and UK), which included women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven or other standard of care. This 
study was based on secondary use of data and therefore individual case safety reporting was not 
performed. Maternal deaths were captured in all cohorts. Cardiac arrest and TEs were captured in the DK 
and UK cohorts but not in the NL cohort. However, in the NL cohort, TEs that occurred as complications of 
embolisation procedure were recorded. Therefore, data on TEs were incomplete in NL and hence not 
suitable for statistical analysis. Follow up time was up to 6 months after delivery (DK), up to end of 
bleeding (NL) and up to death or discharge (UK). 
Study 4731 (UniSeven)  
This study was based on a subset of data on Czech women with severe PPH from UniSeven registry, 
which is a multinational registry that recorded data on off label use of NovoSeven. The study was based 
on secondary use of data and therefore individual case safety reporting was not performed. However, TEs 
and maternal deaths occurring from first NovoSeven administration to end of hospitalisation were 
captured in the registry. Events of DIC and superficial thrombophlebitis were reported separately; 
however, they were not designated as a TE as per the protocol. 
Study 4732 (ANZHR)  
This study was based on a subset of data on obstetric cases of women with severe PPH in the ANZHR, 
which is a comprehensive registry documenting off-label use of NovoSeven at participating hospitals 
throughout Australia and New Zealand. The study was based on secondary use of data from registry and 
therefore individual case safety reporting was not performed. However, all TEs occurring up to 28 days 
from first NovoSeven administration were reported. Events of DIC were reported separately; however, 
they were not designated as a TE as per the protocol. 
Literature review report MAH  
ProQuest and Insight Meme databases were used to search and identify published clinical studies as well 
as case-reports in women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven or other therapies. The literature 
search was performed for a period between 01 January 1996 (the start date was based on the marketing 
authorisation of NovoSeven in EU) to 01 July 2020 with no limits on geography, language, publication 
types or study type. The search excluded guidelines, search websites specialising in guidelines, reviews, 
publication on abortions, publications on approved indications of NovoSeven and non-clinical studies. 
Based on this search strategy and process, retrieved publications were manually assessed for duplicates 
and relevancy. Publications with PPH population with ≥5 women with an event of PPH and information on 
Novoseven II/116 -   
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 86/120 
 
 
 
 
TE and mortality were shortlisted for the review. Case-reports were defined as publications having <5 
women with PPH. The detailed search strings for the literature search were provided in Appendix 1 of the 
literature review. The search retrieved 18 publications which reported data from clinical studies on 
women with sPPH treated with NovoSeven and the number of women included in each study ranged from 
5-108. For women with PPH not treated with NovoSeven, in total 47 publications reported data from 
clinical studies and the number of women included in each study ranged from 7-20762. In women not 
treated with NovoSeven, 29 publications reported data from women with severe PPH, 5 publications from 
women with mixed PPH severity, 1 publication from women with non-severe PPH and in 12 publications, 
PPH severity was not reported. The studies originated from 6 regions with most of the reports originating 
from Europe. There were 6 publications which reported clinical study data both from women with PPH 
treated with NovoSeven and from women not treated with NovoSeven. In addition, 3 publications23-25 
reported clinical study data both from women treated with NovoSeven and from women not treated with 
NovoSeven but the number of women treated with NovoSeven was <5 and, therefore, data from the 
women treated with NovoSeven were described among the case reports and data from the women not 
treated with NovoSeven were included in the meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed and the raw 
and adjusted proportion (95% (prediction intervals (PI)) of TEs, VTEs, ATEs (and maternal mortalities, 
see further below) was estimated for women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven and those not 
treated with NovoSeven. Prediction intervals (PIs) are presented due to the substantial heterogeneity of 
the data. For estimating the proportions, a generalized linear mixed model was used based on the 
binomial distribution, with study as random effect. 
Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) report  
Cases reported to the Argus database, where NovoSeven was used off-label to treat women with severe 
PPH, cumulatively from approval of NovoSeven in 1996 in EU until 30 June 2020 were retrieved, 
evaluated, and reviewed, retrospectively. It should be noted that AEs recorded in the Argus database 
represent an unknown fraction of the true number of AEs due to under-reporting in the post-marketing 
setting. Cases were reported for indications outside the 4 approved indications for NovoSeven. Cases 
reporting abortions and gynaecologic or obstetric cases unrelated to PPH were excluded from the dataset. 
Cases with all AEs in women with PPH receiving NovoSeven during the reporting period were reviewed 
with focus on TEs and cases with a fatal outcome that were manually screened.

Patient exposure 
Studies 4816 (RCT), 4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732 
A total of 446 women with severe PPH combined across the RCT (study 4816) and the four non 
interventional studies (4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732) were exposed to NovoSeven (Table 22).  
Literature review 
In the literature review, 672 women with severe PPH were reported as having been exposed to 
NovoSeven. Some patients in the RCT and non-interventional studies overlapped with the patient 
population included in the published studies. With overlap taken into account, at least 834 women were 
exposed to NovoSeven and are reported in the trial, studies and literature review. 
Dosing 
Details of exposure in terms of total median NovoSeven dose, number of NovoSeven doses, median first, 
second and third dose, time from onset of severe PPH to NovoSeven and time between NovoSeven doses 
for all the clinical data-sources (4816 (RCT), 4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732) are summarised in the Table 
17. 
Trial 4816 (RCT) 
This was a single dose study. 
Non-interventional studies (4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732) 
Across the non-interventional studies, majority of women required only a single dose of NovoSeven; 
information on number of doses administered was not available for DK and UK cohorts in the study 4733 
(PPH consortium). The proportion of women receiving only one dose of NovoSeven ranged from 
36.4%−88.5% across the non-interventional studies; proportion of women receiving a second dose 
ranged from 7.8%−23.0%; and proportion of women receiving a third dose ranged from 1.3%−5.4%. 
Women requiring more than 3 doses of NovoSeven was observed rarely; the proportion of women 
requiring >3 doses of NovoSeven in study 4732 and study 4733 were 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively. 
Total exposure first dose:  
Across the RCT and non-interventional studies, the median first dose of NovoSeven in the FAS ranged 
from 58 µg/kg in trial 4816 (RCT) to 105 µg/kg in study 4731 (UniSeven). In study 4729 (Bern), most 
women received a first dose of 60-90 µg/kg, whereas in studies 4731 (UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR), 
most women received a first dose >90 µg/kg. The proportion of women receiving a first dose of 
NovoSeven of <60 µg/kg, 60−90 µg/kg and >90 µg/kg varied across data sources. The 60−90 µg/kg 
dose range was administered to between 19.5% and 71.2% of women by trial/study.  
Total exposure second and third dose (median) 
In the non-interventional studies, median second and third doses in the FAS for those women who 
received more than 1 dose ranged from 73 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg across studies, and were therefore 
broadly similar to first dose in these studies (63 µg/kg to 105 µg/kg).

Literature review reported dose 
The systematic literature review identified 18 published studies and 68 case-reports with 672 and 100 
women with severe PPH, respectively, who received treatment with NovoSeven. Of the 672 women, 
number of doses administered was reported only for 494 women (14 studies). Most women (80.0%) 
received only 1 dose of NovoSeven, 16% of women received 2 doses, and 3% of women received 3 
doses. More than 2 doses were rarely given. The dose of NovoSeven and number of doses varied between 
the studies. The administered NovoSeven doses usually ranged between 50 and 100 µg/kg but as low 
doses such as 9 µg/kg and as high as 139 µg/kg were also administered. In many studies, only the mean 
or median or total dose in mg were reported without any information about the maternal body weight and 
therefore the actual range of given doses may even be larger than 9 to 139 μg/kg. 
In case-reports, the dose of NovoSeven ranged from 15−120 μg/kg; most cases reported use of only one 
dose of NovoSeven. 
Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) reported dose  
The Argus database had 123 post-marketing cases of women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven. In 
the NovoSeven treated group with TEs (N=39); the median total dose was 130 μg/kg for cases reporting 
dose in μg/kg (n=7) and was 6 mg for cases reporting dose in mg (n=23). Of the 21 women with 
information about the number of doses in this group, 11 women (28.2%) received 1 dose, 7 women 
(17.9%) received two doses and 3 women (2.6%) received ≥3 doses; dosing data were missing for 
46.2% of women. In the NovoSeven treated group that did not report any TEs (N=84); the median total 
dose was 90 μg/kg for cases reporting dose in μg/kg (n=17) and was 6 mg or cases reporting dose in mg 
(n=38). In this group too, the majority of women received only one dose (Novo Nordisk safety database 
(Argus) report. 
Grouping and pooling of trials and data  
The data sources included enable an evaluation of safety of NovoSeven across a broad population of 
women with severe PPH. As the data sources varied in nature, some differences across the data sources, 
such as definition of severe PPH, data collection methods, severity of PPH at the time of NovoSeven 
administration, dose size and timing of NovoSeven in the treatment cascade were observed. Moreover, 
Novo Nordisk did not have access to patient-level data from all the clinical data sources. Therefore, it was 
not possible to universally pool data across the data sources. Exposure, disposition, demographic data, 
overview of TEs and deaths are presented individually and side-by-side to provide an overview across 
clinical data sources. 
Meta-analyses were performed for occurrence of any TEs, VTEs, ATEs in all NovoSeven exposed patients 
across the clinical data sources. 
The data from the literature review and Argus report are described separately and are not pooled with 
other clinical data sources as some of the women were overlapping between these two and between them 
and the other clinical data sources. Some of the published studies included in literature review had 
women who were also included in the trial 4816 (RCT) and the non-interventional studies (studies 4729, 
4731 and 4732). Similarly, some cases from the Argus report partially overlapped with the RCT and non-
interventional studies, but the full extent of overlap is unknown.

The safety evaluation of the MAH is based on the following data: 
• 
Extent of exposure 
•  Study population: disposition, demography and baseline characteristics 
•  Safety assessments 
• 
Type and frequency of TEs: overall, and by VTEs and ATEs 
o  Maternal mortality along with the cause 
o  Any other AEs (cardiac arrest, allergic reactions and haemorrhagic shock) and SAEs (SAEs 
were planned to be captured only in trial 4816)  
• 
Laboratory assessment: baseline laboratory parameters (antithrombin, fibrinogen, platelets, D-dimer 
levels) and pH 
•  Vital signs: baseline body temperature 
Patient disposition 
All data sources included women that had received NovoSeven treatment in event of severe PPH. All data 
sources except studies 4731 and 4732 included data for non-exposed women.  
An overview of disposition of women with severe PPH by analysis sets in the RCT and non-interventional 
studies is presented in Table 24. Overall, in the FAS across the clinical data-sources (trial 4816, study 
4729, 4733, 4731, 4732), a total of 446 women were exposed to NovoSeven (including 8 women in the 
RCT exposed under the compassionate use protocol and 1 woman exposed in error) and 1726 women 
were not exposed to NovoSeven. Due to geographical location and study period, it is unlikely that there is 
any overlap between the RCT and non-interventional studies or between any of the non-interventional 
studies. For comparative analyses (in trial 4816, study 4729 and study 4733), a total of 100 women were 
included in the NovoSeven group and 200 women were included in the Control group.

There was a partial overlap of cases (11 cases) from the Argus report with other published data sources, 
all of which were also included in the literature review. Out of the 11 cases (13 TEs), 2 cases (2 TEs) 
overlapped with 2 women reported in study 4732. The overlapping cases were included in the Argus 
report not to miss any safety information, but the exact extent of overlap is unknown.  
Similarly, a partial overlap of at least 284 women was also observed between clinical data sources (trial 
4816, and studies 4729, 4731 and 4732) and the population included in literature review. With overlap 
taken into account, a total of at least 834 women were exposed to NovoSeven and are reported in the 
trial, studies, and literature review. 
Patient characteristics 
Patient characteristics of full analysis set are presented in table 17, see above. 
Summary safety data set and dose applied 
A total of 446 women with severe PPH were exposed to NovoSeven across the trial/studies (4816, 4729, 
4733, 4731 and 4732). A total of 672 women were also exposed and reported in the literature review and 
103 in the safety database Argus. With overlap taken into account, at least 834 women were exposed to 
NovoSeven and are reported in the trial, studies, and literature review. The exact total of unique women 
exposed cannot be calculated because, although there was no overlap between the trials/studies, there is 
insufficient information to trace the full extent of the overlap of the literature and database with the 
trial/studies.  
The median total dose of NovoSeven ranged between 57.6 −120.0 μg/kg across the trial/studies (4816, 
4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732). All women in trial 4816 received only one dose of NovoSeven, as per the 
protocol. Across the non-interventional studies (4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732), the proportion of women 
requiring only 1 dose of NovoSeven ranged from 36.4%−88.5%, a second dose from 7.8%−23.0%, and 
third dose from 1.3%-5.4%

a“No NovoSeven” women who did not receive NovoSeven (studies 4729 and 4733). 
b9 women from the reference group were exposed to NovoSeven and thus the total of women exposed to NovoSeven 
was N=51 
cFor DK cohort, 1 ATE was reported in NovoSeven treated women; however, it occurred prior to (15 mins) NovoSeven 
administration and hence considered not relevant. The ATE is not included in the above table or for calculation of 
proportions. 
dTE data were missing for 9 of the 199 women who did not receive NovoSeven in the DK cohort. 
eFor NL (FAS), no data on TEs were available except reported as complication of embolisation procedure; type of TEs 
are based on the clinical expert assessment of the available data (data on file) 
fA total of 111 women with PPH were exposed to NovoSeven but this includes 24 women for whom severe PPH was not 
confirmed (blood loss <1500 mL or no blood loss information) 
Pivotal Study 4816 (RCT) 
In the RCT, 2 of 42 women in the NovoSeven group developed a total of 2 VTEs: 
• 
• 
The woman had severe PPH following delivery of twins by CS. Information on blood transfusions or 
haemostatic treatments was not available. Two days after NovoSeven injection, a CT scan revealed 
an ovarian vein thrombosis, which resolved on enoxaparin treatment. Due to the time course of the 
TE, it was assessed as unlikely related to NovoSeven by the investigators and sponsor physician. 
The woman had severe PPH following CS delivery performed due to placental abruption and 
intrauterine foetal death. Severe PPH developed due to uterine atony. Blood transfusion and 
NovoSeven did not control bleeding. A DVT and associated PE was diagnosed by echo doppler, 5 days 
after NovoSeven treatment that resolved on enoxaparin and warfarin treatment. In the opinion of the 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 96/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
investigators, low dose of NovoSeven (32 μg/kg) was unlikely to be related to TEs; additionally, 
placental abruption, intrauterine foetal death, CS and transfusion may have contributed to events. 
No woman developed a VTE in the reference group. No women developed an ATE in either of the groups.  
In the reference group, 8 women received NovoSeven on compassionate use basis after the primary 
endpoint was evaluated and just before hysterectomy; also, 1 woman from the reference group received 
NovoSeven in error at time of randomisation) developed a TE. Therefore, a total of 51 women (42 
randomised treatment and 9 exposed later) were exposed to NovoSeven in this trial.  
The proportion of women with TEs and VTEs accounting for the total women exposed to NovoSeven in the 
RCT was 2/51 (3.9%) versus 0% in the women non-exposed to NovoSeven. 
Non-interventional studies 
Study 4729 (Bern)  
In this study, none of the 52 women in the FAS who received NovoSeven developed a TE. One of 113 
women (0.9%) in the FAS, who did not receive NovoSeven, developed a TE (VTE) (Table 25). The VTE 
was a PE that occurred on day 13 after delivery. The woman had received TXA and underwent a 
hysterectomy. 
Study 4733 (PPH consortium)  
DK cohort 
In this cohort, 2 out of 40 women in the FAS who received NovoSeven developed a total of 2 TEs. Of 
these, one TE (an ATE) developed in a woman 15 minutes prior to NovoSeven administration and hence 
was not related to NovoSeven. The second TE (a PE) occurred in 1 of the 40 women (2.5%) and had 
onset and/or diagnosis 35 days after receiving NovoSeven. Three of 190 women (1.6%) in the FAS who 
did not receive NovoSeven, developed 4 TEs; one woman had an ATE and 2 women had a total of 3 VTEs. 
NL cohort 
In this cohort, data on TEs were only collected for the subset of women who had ‘complication after 
embolisation’, ie. an invasive procedure. Hence, NL cohort data was not combined with the other data 
sources.  
Of 23 women who received NovoSeven and underwent embolisation, 1 woman (4.3%) developed a TE 
(time of diagnosis of severe PPH not known). Of the 144 women in the FAS, who did not receive 
NovoSeven but had an embolisation, 3 women (2.1%) developed a total of 3 TEs (one each), time of 
diagnosis was not known. It was not known whether the TEs reported post embolisation were arterial or 
venous except for 1 NovoSeven treated woman had a VTE. 
UK cohort 
In this cohort, none of 13 (0.0%) women in the FAS who received NovoSeven developed a TE. Four of 
149 women (2.7%) who did not receive NovoSeven developed TEs (all VTEs). 
Study 4731 (Uniseven)  
In this study, no records of women developed TE after receiving NovoSeven.  
Study 4732 (ANZHR)  
In this study, 5 of 166 women in the FAS developed TEs (one each). Of these, one was a cerebrovascular 
accident, and another was a PE; both TEs developed prior to NovoSeven administration and hence were 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 97/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
not related to NovoSeven. The remaining 3 TEs occurred in 3 women after NovoSeven treatment (Table 
25). One of 166 women (0.6%) developed an ATE (acute MI); the time of onset and/or diagnosis of TE 
was within 36 minutes of NovoSeven administration. The women eventually died due to uncontrolled 
haemorrhage. Two out of 166 women (1.2%) developed VTEs (DVT and PE); both had onset and/or 
diagnosis within 7 days of NovoSeven administration.  
Meta-analysis of pooled data from RCT and non-interventional studies 
In the meta-analysis, the proportion (95% PI) of women with a TE from meta-analysis pooled data for 
RCT and non-interventional studies was calculated.  
The overall adjusted proportion (95% PI) of women with a TE from meta-analysis using pooled data from 
the FAS for RCT and non-interventional studies was 0.015 (0.007, 0.032) in NovoSeven treated women 
and 0.016 (0.008, 0.033) in women not treated with NovoSeven, indicating no increase in TE risk 
following NovoSeven administration. (Please note: In the NL cohort of study 4733, a TE was only 
recorded if it was a complication of an embolisation, therefore, TE data from the NL cohort are excluded 
from the meta-analysis), see figure 10.

Literature review report  
In the literature review, a total of 14 TEs were reported in 13/669 women with severe PPH who received 
NovoSeven and a total of 22 TEs were reported in 1558 women with severe PPH who did not receive 
NovoSeven. As expected, the majority of the TEs were VTEs. The predominance of women reporting VTEs 
versus ATEs was more pronounced in women with sPPH treated with NovoSeven than in women with 
severe and mixed PPH severity not treated with NovoSeven. Furthermore, the proportion of women with 
ATEs was less in the severe group of women treated with NovoSeven (7.7%) than the severe group not 
treated with NovoSeven (27.3%).  
In all regions, the adjusted proportions of women with sPPH reporting ATEs and VTEs were 0.15% and 
1.6%, respectively, in women with sPPH treated with NovoSeven. In women with sPPH not treated with 
NovoSeven, the adjusted proportions of women reporting ATEs and VTEs were 0.005% and 0.5%, 
respectively.  
Additional details of adjusted proportion for all TEs, VTEs and ATEs of each individual publication included 
in meta-analysis is included in Figure 11.

Women not treated with NovoSeven 
A majority of the TEs were VTEs in both the groups. One of 13 women who received NovoSeven group 
had an ATE (asymptomatic MI) and the remaining 12 of 13 women had VTEs (7 DVT and 7 PE). Six of 22 
women in the No NovoSeven group had ATEs (1 MI and 5 TEs in iliac or femoral artery) and the 
remaining 16 of 22 women had VTEs (10 DVT and 7 PE). 
In case-reports from literature review, 6 TEs were reported in 4 women who received NovoSeven; all 
were VTEs. Onset and/or diagnosis of TEs after NovoSeven administration ranged from 3 hours to 4 
weeks (time was not known in one case). 
VTEs are more commonly reported than ATEs in women with sPPH, however, ATEs still occur in some 
women, as PPH increases the risk of both venous and arterial TEs. The predominance of VTEs versus ATEs 
was also confirmed in the present meta-analysis. It can be seen that there were modest differences in the 
occurrences of TEs (both for overall events, ATEs and VTEs) between the 2 populations with adjusted 
proportions of TEs generally being higher in the women treated with NovoSeven compared with women 
not treated with NovoSeven. However, both the prediction intervals (PIs) of the adjusted TE proportions 
of the women treated with NovoSeven in the studies and those not treated with NovoSeven overlapped 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 100/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
and the adjusted proportion of the women treated with NovoSeven laid within the PIs of those not treated 
with NovoSeven. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that there is a difference between the occurrence of 
TE in these populations. 
Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) report 
A search performed in the Novo Nordisk safety database yielded 123 postmarketing cases of women with 
sPPH treated with NovoSeven (hereafter referred to as sPPH cases). The first case was reported in 
January 2003 and the latest in April 2020. The countries reporting the highest number of cases were 
France (21%), Lebanon (16%) and the United States (11%). Thirty-two of the 123 sPPH cases (26%) 
were reported as off-label use without an associated AE (i.e., off-label use with no harm). Off-label use 
without an associated AE is not considered a safety information. However, if such information is reported 
to Novo Nordisk or identified in the literature, it will still be recorded in the safety database. 
Thirty-nine women with severe PPH experienced at least one TE (total 46 TEs) after being treated with 
NovoSeven. Of these, 21 women had a VTE, 13 women had ATEs and 5 women had multiple TEs (5 ATEs 
and 7 VTEs). Additional details of TEs are provided in the report. 
Onset/diagnosis of TE: the timing of the first TE was reported in 27 of the 39 cases. Eleven TEs had an 
onset and/or were diagnosed within 48 hours after treatment with NovoSeven, whereas the rest of the 
TEs had an onset and/or were diagnosed within 4-28 days after treatment with NovoSeven. According to 
the label, the half-life of NovoSeven is 3.9 to 6.0 hours in healthy subjects. Therefore, it is considered 
unlikely that TEs appearing more than 48 hours after treatment are caused by NovoSeven. However, 
some of the TEs could have occurred days before they were diagnosed. 
Dosing regimen: The dosing of NovoSeven varied between the cases. Of the 21 women, where 
information about the number of doses was available, 11 women (52.4%) received 1 dose, 7 women 
(33.3%) received two doses and 3 women (14.3%) received ≥3 doses. For cases reporting dose in 
milligram (n = 23), the median total dose was 6 mg. For cases reporting dose in μg/kg (n = 7), the 
median total dose was 130 μg/kg. The risk of TEs was confounded by several patient related risk factors, 
concomitant conditions, use of invasive procedures and development of complications.  
Risk factors: The risk of TEs was confounded by several patient related risk factors, concomitant 
conditions, use of invasive procedures and development of complications. The most common risk factors 
identified in the case narratives were major abdominal surgery (e.g., caesarean section, hysterectomy 
and laparotomy), massive transfusions and DIC. Most of the women (≥70%) underwent invasive 
procedures (i.e., uterine or iliac artery ligation, radiological arterial embolisation, uterine compression 
sutures or hysterectomy) and/or received massive blood transfusions. NovoSeven was often given late in 
the management of sPPH (i.e. during/after hysterectomy) at a time when the women were at an even 
further increased risk of developing TEs. 
A causality assessment of the TE was provided by the reporter in most cases; 4 TEs were assessed as 
‘probably related to NovoSeven’, 23 TEs were assessed as ‘possibly related to NovoSeven’ and 10 TEs 
were assessed as ‘unlikely related to NovoSeven’. 
Causality assessment of TE by MAH 
Of the 7 TEs reported after NovoSeven administration in the RCT and non-interventional studies, 5 TEs (4 
VTEs and 1 ATE) were assessed as unlikely to be related and the remaining 2 TEs (both VTEs) were 
assessed as possibly related to NovoSeven, per reporter's assessment. Per Novo Nordisk assessment, 1 
of 7 TEs (a VTE) was assessed as possibly related and the remaining 6 TEs (1 ATE and 5 VTEs) were 
assessed as unlikely to be related to NovoSeven, see table 26 below.

Overview of maternal mortality 
Causes of death in women with severe PPH include bleeding, organ failure, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, 
DIC and other reasons. Key contributory factors to severe maternal outcomes (including death) in women 
with severe PPH may include demographics (maternal age, education), clinical variables (parity, 
gestational age, maternal anaemia, caesarean section delivery), late presentation, referral from another 
facility, and poor infrastructure. Interventions used in the treatment cascade, such as hysterectomy and 
massive transfusion can result in complications of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multiple 
organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) / MOF and shock that may result in a fatal outcome. Massive 
transfusion alone is an independent predictor of multiorgan failure (MOF), systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (SIRS) and increased mortality as it can precipitate a triad of acidosis, hypothermia, 
and coagulopathy. 
An overview of maternal mortality in women with sPPH across data sources is presented in table 27 
below.

aData sources include trial 4816, studies 4729, 4733, 4731, 4732 and published studies from literature review. 
b9 women from the reference group were exposed to NovoSeven which means that the total number of women exposed 
to NovoSeven was 51. 
cNo NovoSeven group includes women not treated with NovoSeven in the FAS (trial 4816, study 4729 and 4733). 
dA total of 111 women with PPH were exposed to NovoSeven but this includes 24 women for whom severe PPH was not confirmed 
(blood loss <1500 mL or no blood loss information), hereof one women died. 
•  Studies (RCT and non-interventional studies) 
Trial 4816 (RCT) 
No maternal deaths were reported in any of the groups. 
Study 4729 (Bern) 
No maternal deaths were reported in any of the groups. 
Study 4733 (PPH consortium)  
in DK cohort, no death was reported among women who were treated with NovoSeven while 2 deaths 
were reported among women who were not treated with NovoSeven. 
In NL cohort, two deaths were reported among women who were treated with NovoSeven, while 5 deaths 
were reported among women who were not treated with NovoSeven. Cause of the death was not reported 
for the 2 women who died after treatment with NovoSeven in the NL cohort. As per the study clinician, a 
causal relationship between NovoSeven and the fatal outcome was ‘possible’; as per the company 
assessment, both the deaths were considered ‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven. 
For UK cohort, no deaths were reported among women who were treated with NovoSeven, while 2 deaths 
were reported in women who were not treated with NovoSeven. 
Study 4731 (UniSeven) 
One woman died after NovoSeven treatment. This woman did not have confirmed severe PPH as her 
blood loss before NovoSeven was not reported. Therefore, she was not included in the FAS. The data 
from this study were published earlier (Blatný J. et al, 2011), and the publication reported 2 maternal 
deaths; however, during further analysis it was confirmed that only one woman in this study died as 
described above. This woman died due to shock after NovoSeven treatment. The causal relationship with

NovoSeven of the fatal outcome was not reported in the study. As per company assessment, the death 
was ‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven 
Study 4732 (ANZHR) 
A total of 13 maternal deaths were reported in the NovoSeven treated women with severe PPH. In this 
study 4732, a registry, there was remarkably higher maternal mortality (13/166 (7.8%)) as compared to 
the maternal mortality reported in other data-sources. The reason for the higher mortality rate in study 
4732 (ANZHR) is not known, but patient risk factors, geographical location (e.g., remoteness from 
speciality care), social and/or cultural factors may be involved. A summary of maternal mortality events 
is presented in Table 28.

aOther as causes of PPH included, 3 women with pre-eclampsia; 2 women with intrauterine foetal death; 1 woman each 
with severe SLE, APLS and arthritis; HELLP syndrome; ruptured splenic artery aneurysm; ruptured subcapsular 
hematoma; and one woman with other cause not known. 
bSome women can have more than one (multiple) cause of PPH 
Subgroup analyses of the deaths by concomitant medication, fibrinogen level, timing of first dose with 
respect to start of bleeding and timing of first dose with respect to first invasive procedure showed that 
the deaths were spread between the subgroups with no obvious pattern or the numbers in one of the 
subgroups was too low to allow comparison. A clinician affiliated with Monash University assessed all 13 
deaths as ‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven. Also as per company assessment, all the 13 death were 
‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven. 
•  Literature review 
In literature review, a total of 27 maternal deaths were reported among women with severe PPH treated 
with NovoSeven. A total of 15 maternal deaths were reported among women with severe PPH not treated 
with NovoSeven (No NovoSeven group). The adjusted proportion (PI) of maternal mortality was 1.8% 
(0.1, 26.9) in women who received NovoSeven and 0.2% (0.0, 25.0) in the ‘No NovoSeven group’. Four 
women who received NovoSeven died during severe PPH as described in 4 case reports in the literature 
review.  
Of 27 deaths reported in NovoSeven treated women the most reported causes of deaths were ‘organ 
failure or sepsis’ (26%), ‘missing cause of death’ (26%) or ‘obstetric haemorrhage or hypovolemic shock’ 
(22%) in women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven. One death in women with severe PPH treated 
with NovoSeven was due to a TE and this was a ‘multisystem failure after emergency pulmonary 
embolectomy’, a procedure which was performed before NovoSeven was administered. This woman was 
also included in the publication based on ANZHR.25 The causal relation to NovoSeven to 4 maternal 
deaths in NovoSeven treated women from case-reports were not reported by the authors. After company 
assessment, 3 of the 4 maternal deaths were assessed to be ‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven. One death 
from a case-report could not be assessed as information was insufficient. 
•  Argus safety report 
In ARGUS report, a total of 28 maternal deaths were reported in women with severe PPH. According to 
the MAH, the high number of fatal cases is most likely due to bias introduced by the nature of post-
marketing reporting; the more serious an event, the more likely it is to be reported, the long reporting 
duration (since 1995 to 2020) and global reporting. The most common risk factors for fatal outcomes, as 
identified in the case narratives, were major abdominal surgery (e.g., caesarean section, hysterectomy, 
and laparotomy), DIC, cardiac arrest, haemorrhagic shock, coagulopathy and multiple organ failure. The 
cause of maternal death was missing in approximately 50% of the fatal cases, however, the most 
commonly reported causes of deaths were multiple organ failure (4 cases) and DIC (3 cases). In 3 of the 
28 fatal cases, the women had one or multiple TEs. The time of death after NovoSeven administration 
was reported in very few cases. 
Summary of maternal deaths across data presented 
Across the trial/studies, 16 maternal deaths were reported in women treated with NovoSeven, 13 of 
which were in study 4732 (ANZHR). The one death reported in study 4731 (UniSeven) was included in the 
exposed population but was not confirmed as a case of severe PPH. A total of 27 maternal deaths of 
women treated with NovoSeven were reported in the literature review. One death in the literature review 
was assessed to be due to a TE (‘multisystem failure after emergency pulmonary embolectomy’). All but 
one death were assessed to be ‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven as per company assessment, with the one 
death unable to be assessed. In cases reported in the Argus database, causality assessment was provided 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 105/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
by the reporter in most of the Argus cases; 4 TEs were assessed as ‘probably related’, 23 TEs were 
assessed as ‘possibly related’ and 10 TEs were assessed as ‘unlikely related’ to NovoSeven. 
Other serious adverse events  
•  Studies (RCT and non-interventional studies) 
No protocols planned to capture SAEs other than trial 4816 (RCT). However, in study 4729, apart from 
TEs, additional cardiac arrest, allergic reactions and haemorrhagic shock were captured.  
Trial 4816 (RCT)  
No SAEs were reported in the NovoSeven treated women. 
Study 4729 (Bern)  
In this study, apart from TEs, additional AEs of cardiac arrest, allergic reactions and haemorrhagic shock 
were captured. Cardiac arrest is an expected AE as an outcome of uncontrolled severe PPH and is not 
related to NovoSeven treatment. It was reported in 1 of 52 (1.9%) women who were treated with 
NovoSeven and 1 of 113 (0.9%) women who were not treated with NovoSeven. Two of 52 (3.8%) women 
who were treated with NovoSeven experienced allergic reactions, while none of the 113 women who were 
not treated with NovoSeven experienced any allergic reactions. Six of 52 (11.5%) women who were 
treated with NovoSeven and 4 of 113 (3.5%) women who were not treated with NovoSeven had an event 
of haemorrhagic shock recorded. One woman in the NovoSeven group had a prolonged hospital stay due 
to acute renal failure. The woman was hospitalised prior to delivery due to pre-eclampsia. Caesarean 
section was performed pre-term after start of PPH. 
Study 4733 (PPH consortium)  
Cardiac arrest was reported for 2/40 (5.0%) women who were treated with NovoSeven and 6/199 (3.1%) 
women who were not treated with NovoSeven in the DK cohort.  
Cardiac events were not collected for the NL cohort.  
In the UK cohort, no cardiac events (defined as cardiac arrest, cardiac infection or cardioversion and 
inotropic support) were reported for women treated with NovoSeven (0/40, 0%) whereas 8/149 (5.4%) 
women not treated with NovoSeven experienced a cardiac event. 
In the NL cohort, of the 37 women treated with NovoSeven in the FAS, 31 (83.8%) women experienced 
haemorrhagic shock; 1 did not experienced haemorrhagic shock and data was missing for 5 (13.5%) 
women prior to time0. 
•  Other adverse events in Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) report  
In the Argus report, apart from TEs, the other most frequently reported AEs in women with severe PPH 
receiving NovoSeven were drug ineffective/drug ineffective in unapproved indication (14 AEs), multiple 
organ dysfunction syndrome (8 AEs) and DIC (6 AEs). The majority of the AEs were only reported only 
once. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology and coagulation monitoring are routinely performed during severe PPH considering the risk 
of associated morbidity and mortality with uncontrolled bleeding. In the clinical data sources presented in 
this application, the available results of haematological laboratory parameters are presented, i.e. 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 106/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
fibrinogen levels, platelet count and pH that are relevant to safety have been captured and are described 
in this section. 
Role of fibrinogen levels, platelet count and pH in severe postpartum haemorrhage  
• 
Efficacy of haemostatic products such as NovoSeven will be limited when fibrinogen levels or platelet 
count are low (RCOG 2017). Additionally, acidosis (i.e., pH <7.2) may exacerbate dilutional 
coagulopathy and impair the haemostasis. 
• 
Fibrinogen levels >2 g/L are required for clot formation and stabilisation. Fibrinogen level ≤2 g/L and 
decreased platelet count has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of severe PPH.  
•  Acidosis can impair coagulation by delaying clot formation and reducing clot strength, thereby 
worsening the risk of serious haemorrhage. Furthermore, massive transfusion often exacerbates 
acidosis as stored blood has a reduced pH and can lead to dilution coagulopathy. A study showed that 
a reduction in pH from 7.4 to 7.0 nearly abolished FVIIa activity and severely reduced activity of 
FXa/FVa complex. 
Current guidelines recommend maintaining fibrinogen concentration ≥2 g/L and platelet count ≥50 × 
109/L with correction of acidosis, during ongoing PPH (RCOG 2017, Muñoz M et al, 2019).

aFor trial 4816, baseline refers to T0 samples collected immediately after randomisation and pre-dose NovoSeven; for 
study 4729, baseline refers to closest values to time0 within a time frame of 60 minutes before time0; and for studies 
4731 and 4732, baseline refers to closest values prior to first NovoSeven dose 
In the trial 4816 (RCT), median fibrinogen levels (2.4 g/L and 3.2 g/L) were above the threshold of 2 g/L 
and the median platelet counts (136.0 × 109/L and 145.0 × 109/L) were similar, at T0 in the NovoSeven 
and reference groups, respectively. The median fibrinogen level and platelet count in the 2 groups 
suggested that the women had comparable clinical severity at baseline. The majority of women had a 
fibrinogen level ≥2 g/L in the NovoSeven group (64.3%) and the reference group (78.6%), at T0. 
Similarly, the majority of women had platelet count ≥50 × 109/L in the NovoSeven group (90.5%) and 
the reference group (97.6%), at T0. These optimum levels observed were likely due to early use of 
NovoSeven in this study (within 1 hour of sulprostone failure), before the condition of women worsened 
due to bleeding. 
In study 4729 (Bern), the majority of women had baseline fibrinogen level less than the threshold of 2 
g/L (54.5%) and platelet count higher than the minimum threshold of 50 × 109/L (76.0%).  
In study 4731 and study 4732 were 1.54 g/L and 1.50 g/L, respectively, the majority of women in both 
studies had baseline fibrinogen level less than the threshold of 2 g/L and platelet count higher than the 
minimum threshold of 50 × 109/L. In both studies, the majority of women had baseline measurement pH 
≥7.2 (85.1% and 50.6%). Overall, the baseline fibrinogen levels in the single-cohort non-interventional 
studies were lower, suggesting that the women in these real-world studies were clinically more severe at 
baseline as compared to the women in trial 4816 (RCT).

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As NovoSeven is on the EU market since 1996, previous safety experience collected in the approved 
indications is available. As part of this application, the safety data set to support safety of NovoSeven use 
in women with severe PPH included: 
• 
• 
Pivotal data from the open-label RCT (trial 4816).  
Supportive data from 4 non-interventional studies based on single hospital level data from a 
single centre (study 4729, Bern, Switzerland), national or population level data from UK, DK, and 
NL (study 4733 PPH consortium) and 2 registries describing off-label use of NovoSeven (study 
4731 in CZ and study 4732 in New Zealand and Australia).  
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 108/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
• 
Supportive data from the Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) and from a literature review (of 
published clinical studies and case-reports) that report safety data of women with severe PPH 
treated with NovoSeven. 
Although limited, the key safety data are considered to be derived from the RCT, which are further 
supported with the data from the non-interventional studies. With the additionally provided literature 
review (including a meta-analysis) on incidence of thrombosis, and the safety database of the MAH, it is 
considered that most of the available data on the safety of NovoSeven in the treatment of PPH have been 
captured. 
Rationale MAH for focussing on thrombo-embolic events (TEs) 
Due to its mechanism of action, promoting the coagulation cascade, a relevant safety concern with the 
use of NovoSeven in severe PPH is the likelihood of developing TEs due to potential overstimulation of the 
coagulation system. In pregnancy and during the postpartum period, women are already in a 
hypercoagulable state and the incidence of TEs is higher in all patients during the first 6 weeks after 
delivery, and also factors such as caesarean section, PPH or a body mass index of >30 kg/m2 may 
further increase the risk. The incidence of venous TEs has been reported to range from <1−7.8% in 
women with PPH and from 2.5−4.8% in women with PPH treated with NovoSeven. Therefore, the 
assessment of the safety of NovoSeven in women with severe PPH focussed on TEs, and whether there 
was an increased risk of TEs following NovoSeven administration. The argumentation to specifically focus 
on the risk of TE in the population of women with severe PPH is supported, taking into account that this 
population is already at increased risk of VTE. The general safety pattern of NovoSeven, which is on the 
market since 1996, is considered sufficiently known. The VTE and (ATE) risk is currently reflected as a 
warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
In addition, also Maternal mortality along with the cause and any other AEs (cardiac arrest, allergic 
reactions and haemorrhagic shock) and SAEs (SAEs were planned to be captured only in trial 4816) were 
evaluated. 
Patient exposure A total of 446 women with severe PPH combined across the RCT (study 4816) and the 
four non-interventional studies (4729, 4733, 4731 and 4732) were exposed to NovoSeven. In the 
literature review, 672 women with severe PPH were reported as having been exposed to NovoSeven. 
Some patients in the RCT and non-interventional studies overlapped with the patient population included 
in the published studies. With overlap taken into account, at least 834 women were exposed to 
NovoSeven and are reported in the trial, non-interventional studies, and literature review. This exposure 
exceeds the requirements of ICH-E1 and is considered sufficient for adequate assessment of the safety 
profile of NovoSeven in this new indication. As to dosing, the RCT was a single dose study of 60 μg/kg, 
although some variation occurred, varying between 60-90 μg/kg, due to the use of whole vials.  
Across the non-interventional studies, majority of women required only a single dose of NovoSeven; the 
proportion of women receiving a second dose ranged from 7.8%−23.0%; and proportion of women 
receiving a third dose ranged from 1.3%−5.4%. Based on the FAS from the non-interventional studies, 
the median first dose of 63 μg/kg to 105 μg/kg. The majority of the women in study 4729 (Bern) received 
a NovoSeven dose of 60-90 μg/kg (71.2%); whilst the other 2 non interventional studies, 4731 
(UniSeven) and 4732 (ANZHR), had most patients received >90 µg/kg. median second and third doses in 
the FAS for those women who received more than one dose ranged from 73 µg/kg to 100 µg/kg across 
studies. In the literature review, most women received a single dose of NovoSeven, in which doses were 
between 50 and 100 μg/kg. 
AEs of special interest: thromboembolic events 
In the pivotal trial 4816 (RCT), 2/42 women in the NovoSeven group developed a VTE; a VTE in the 
ovarian vein 2 days after NovoSeven treatment, and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) + pulmonary 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 109/120 
 
 
 
 
  
embolism (PE) 5 days after NovoSeven treatment, while no VTE occurred in the reference group. No 
women developed an ATE in either of the groups. No TEs occurred in the 8 women from the reference 
group received NovoSeven on compassionate use basis after the primary endpoint was evaluated and just 
before hysterectomy, and 1 woman from the reference group received NovoSeven in error at time of 
randomisation. Based on a total of 51 women (42 randomised to Novoseven treatment and 9 exposed 
later in the reference group (in an attempt to avoid salvage peripartum hysterectomy), the proportion of 
women with TEs and VTEs accounting for the total women exposed in this trial was 2/51 (3.9%). 
Causality assessment: Both VTEs were considered unlikely related to the exposure to NovoSeven by the 
hospital investigators and sponsor physician: the first case was considered unlikely related due to the 
time course of the VTE, i.e. two days after administration of NovoSeven, the second case was considered 
unlikely related due to the low dose (32 μg/kg) and additional circumstances of placental abruption, 
intrauterine foetal death, caesarean section and transfusion may have contributed to events. As a 
contribution of NovoSeven to the occurrence of these VTEs cannot be ruled out, SmPC section 4.8 reflects 
that in an open-label randomised clinical trial, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 2 of 51 
patients treated with a single dose of NovoSeven (median dose 58 μg/kg) and none of 33 patients not 
treated with NovoSeven; no arterial thromboembolic events were reported in either group. 
Non-interventional studies: in these (studies 4729, 4731, 4732 and 4733), 5 TEs were reported in 395 
women after administration of NovoSeven in the FAS (including 1 TE in the NL cohort of study 4733, not 
included in the meta-analysis). Of these 5 TEs, 1 event was a fatal ATE of acute myocardial infarction in 
study 4732 (ANZHR). The remaining 4 events were VTEs: 2 VTEs in study 4733 (PPH consortium) (PE; 
not reported), and 2 VTEs in study 4732 (ANZHR) (DVT; PE). Causality assessment: Of the 5 TEs 
reported after NovoSeven administration in the non-interventional studies, 3 TEs (2 VTEs and 1 ATE) 
were assessed as unlikely to be related and the remaining 2 TEs (both VTEs) were assessed as possibly 
related to NovoSeven, per reporter's assessment. Per Novo Nordisk assessment, 1 of 5 TEs (a VTE) was 
assessed as possibly related and the remaining 4 TEs (1 ATE and 3 VTEs) were assessed as unlikely to be 
related to NovoSeven. It can be debated whether or not the relationship to NovoSeven is possibly related 
or unlikely related, as most women with TEs had confounding factors that may have contributed to 
development of thrombosis, including HELLP syndrome/pre-eclampsia, emergency caesarean section, 
intra-uterine foetal death, twin birth or large volume of transfusions. Further, some women were had 
decreased mobility due to hospitalisation. Also, the temporal relationship between NovoSeven 
administration and the TE is not always clear in the women with TEs after NovoSeven treatment. 
Nevertheless, despite confounding factors, a contribution of NovoSeven to occurrence of TEs cannot be 
ruled out. SmPC section 4.4 reflects that in severe postpartum haemorrhage and pregnancy, the clinical 
conditions (delivery, severe haemorrhage, transfusion, DIC, surgery/invasive procedures and 
coagulopathy) are known contributing factors to the thromboembolic risk; and in particular venous 
thromboembolic risk associated with the administration of NovoSeven. Section 4.8 of the SmPC reflect 
that in 4 non-interventional studies, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 3 of 358 (0.8%) 
patients treated with NovoSeven (median dose range 63-105 µg/kg) and arterial thromboembolic events 
were reported in 1 (0.3%) patient treated with NovoSeven. 
In the meta-analysis, performed on pooled data from the FAS of the RCT and non-interventional studies 
estimated an overall adjusted proportion (95% PI) of women with a TE of 0.015 (0.007, 0.032) in 
NovoSeven treated women and 0.016 (0.008, 0.033) in women not treated with NovoSeven, indicating 
no increase in TE risk following NovoSeven administration. (note: In the NL cohort of study 4733, a TE 
was only recorded if it was a complication of an embolisation, therefore, TE data from the NL cohort are 
excluded from the meta-analysis.) 
In the literature review, a total of 14 TEs were reported in 13/669 women with severe PPH who 
received NovoSeven. Twenty-two TEs (in 22 women) were reported in 22/1558 women with severe PPH 
who did not receive NovoSeven. The overall adjusted proportion for all TEs, VTEs and ATEs after a meta-
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 110/120 
 
 
 
 
  
analysis of all published studies is 1.6% (0.4%, 6.6%). In women with severe PPH not treated with 
NovoSeven, the adjusted proportion of women reporting TEs was 0.8% (0.05%, 12.7%)95% PI with 
adjusted proportions of ATEs and VTEs of 0.005% and 0.5%, respectively. As there was a large overlap 
between the PIs of the adjusted proportion of TEs (also for ATEs and VTEs) for the populations of women 
treated with NovoSeven and not treated with NovoSeven, it cannot be concluded that there is a difference 
between the occurrence of TE in these populations. 
In the Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus), 39 women experienced at least one TE among the 123 
post-marketing cases of women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven since 1996. Of these, 21 
women had a VTE, 13 women had an ATE and 5 women had multiple TEs (5 ATEs and 7 VTEs). The 
timing of the first (or only) TE was reported in 27 of the 39 cases. Eleven (11) TEs had an onset and/or 
were diagnosed within 48 hours after treatment with NovoSeven, whereas the rest of the TEs had an 
onset and/or were diagnosed within 4 to 28 days after treatment with NovoSeven. The risk of TEs was 
confounded by several patient related risk factors, concomitant conditions, use of invasive procedures 
and development of complications. Further, NovoSeven was often given late in the management of 
severe PPH (i.e., during/after hysterectomy) at a time when the women were at an even further 
increased risk of developing TEs. A causality assessment of the TE was provided by the reporter in most 
cases; 4 TEs were assessed as ‘probably related to NovoSeven’, 23 TEs were assessed as ‘possibly related 
to NovoSeven’ and 10 TEs were assessed as ‘unlikely related to NovoSeven’. 
Maternal mortality  
Worldwide, postpartum haemorrhage accounts for 8% of maternal deaths in developed regions of the 
world and 20% of maternal deaths in developing regions (WHO syst. Analys., Lancet 2014). Causes of 
death in women with PPH include bleeding, organ failure, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, DIC and other 
reasons. 
Trial 4816 (RCT) No maternal deaths were reported in any of the groups. 
In the non-interventional studies, a total of 16 maternal deaths were reported for women who received 
NovoSeven. The maternal death rate ranged from 0% to 7.8% in the NovoSeven group and from 0% to 
1.3% in the no NovoSeven group. It cannot be concluded that there is a difference between the 
occurrence of maternal deaths in these 2 groups of women since a randomised control was only included 
in trial 4816 (RCT), where no deaths occurred. It might be hypothesised, that the rates in the non-
interventional studies results might be affected by ‘confounding by indication’, i.e. women who are 
treated with NovoSeven often have a more severe condition than women who are not treated with 
NovoSeven and might therefore be at risk of higher mortality. However, considering the variety of 
background complications, it is not possible to draw definite conclusions. The reporter assessment of 
causal relationship to NovoSeven was ‘unlikely’ for 13 of the 16 deaths in NovoSeven-treated women, 
‘possible’ for 2 deaths and not available for the remaining death. The Novo Nordisk assessment of causal 
relationship to NovoSeven was ‘unlikely’ for all 16 maternal deaths.  
The maternal death rate was higher in study 4732 (ANZHR) (7.8% [13/166]) than in the RCT and the 
other 3 non interventional studies. The reason for the higher mortality rate in study 4732 (ANZHR) is not 
known, but patient risk factors, geographical location (e.g., remoteness from speciality care), social 
and/or cultural factors may be involved. All 13 deaths in study 4732 (ANZHR) were assessed as unlikely 
related to NovoSeven by a physician affiliated with Monash University.  
The most commonly reported causes of death were ‘multiple organ failure’ (2 women), ‘cerebral 
ischaemia’ (2 women) and cardiac arrest (4 women in total: ‘cardiac arrest’, ‘cardiac arrest due to 
uncontrolled bleeding’, ‘cardiac arrest secondary to pulmonary embolism’. Other causes of death (1 
woman each) were ‘shock’, ‘sepsis’, ‘secondary to uncontrolled haemorrhage’ and ‘uncontrolled blood 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 111/120 
 
 
 
 
  
loss’. Cause of death was not available for 4 women. Conditions that could have contributed to a fatal 
outcome were reported in most cases. 
Literature review In literature review, 27 maternal deaths were reported among women with severe 
PPH treated with NovoSeven, and 15 maternal deaths were reported among women with severe PPH not 
treated with NovoSeven (No NovoSeven group). The adjusted proportion (PI) of maternal mortality was 
1.8% (0.1, 26.9) in women who received NovoSeven and 0.2% (0.0, 25.0) in the ‘No NovoSeven group’. 
Of 27 deaths reported in NovoSeven treated women, the most reported causes of deaths were ‘organ 
failure or sepsis’ (26%), ‘missing cause of death’ (26%) or ‘obstetric haemorrhage or hypovolemic shock’ 
(22%), and one death was due to a TE (a ‘multisystem failure after emergency pulmonary embolectomy’) 
performed before NovoSeven administration.  
Argus safety report In ARGUS report, 28 maternal deaths were reported in women with severe PPH. 
The high number of fatal cases is most likely due to bias introduced by the nature of post-marketing 
reporting i.e. the more serious an event, the more likely it is to be reported, the long reporting duration 
(since 1995 to 2020) and global reporting. The most common risk factors for fatal outcomes, as identified 
in the case narratives, were major abdominal surgery (e.g., caesarean section, hysterectomy, and 
laparotomy), DIC, cardiac arrest, haemorrhagic shock, coagulopathy and multiple organ failure. The 
cause of maternal death was missing in approximately 50% of the fatal cases, however, the most 
commonly reported causes of deaths were multiple organ failure (4 cases) and DIC (3 cases). In 3 of the 
28 fatal cases, the women had one or multiple TEs. The time of death after NovoSeven administration 
was reported in very few cases. 
Other serious adverse events No protocols planned to capture SAEs other than trial 4816 (RCT). Trial 
4816 (RCT):  No SAEs were reported in the NovoSeven treated women. 
In Study 4729 (Bern) additional AEs of cardiac arrest, allergic reactions (known adverse event of 
NovoSeven) and haemorrhagic shock were captured. Cardiac arrest is an expected AE as an outcome of 
uncontrolled severe PPH and is not related to NovoSeven treatment. Cardiac arrest was reported in 1/52 
(1.9%) in the NovoSeven group  vs. 1/113 (0.9%) in the non-treated group. Haemorrhagic shock was 
noted in 6/52 (11.5%) in the NovoSeven group vs. 4/113 (3.5%) non-treated group. Although these 
reports suggest numerical higher number of SAEs in the NovoSeven group vs the non-treated group of 
women with severe PPH, data are too limited to draw any conclusions. In Study 4733 (PPH consortium) 
additionally cardiac AEs were captured, which was reported for 2/40 (5.0%) women treated with 
NovoSeven and 6/199 (3.1%) women who were not treated with NovoSeven (DK cohort). In the UK 
cohort, no cardiac events (defined as cardiac arrest, cardiac infection or cardioversion and inotropic 
support) were reported for women treated with NovoSeven (0/40, 0%) whereas 8/149 (5.4%) women 
not treated with NovoSeven experienced a cardiac event. In the NL cohort, 31/37 (83.8%) women 
treated with NovoSeven experienced haemorrhagic shock, which was defined as “at least one 
measurement of systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg and/or a heart rate ≥120 beats per minute from start 
of haemorrhage until time of diagnosis of persistent PPH” according to the WHO guideline on evaluating 
the quality of care for severe pregnancy complications.5 However, the percentage of women with 
haemorrhagic shock at any time (period from delivery to 24 hours after childbirth) was comparable 
between the 2 groups in the full analysis set (FAS) (NovoSeven: 32/37 (86.5%) versus No NovoSeven: 
1052/1223 (86.0%), indicating no increased rates of haemorrhagic shock in the NovoSeven exposed 
group. The high proportion of women with haemorrhagic shock might be related with the more 
progressed course of severe PPH observed in this NL population as indicated by their inclusion criteria, 
i.e., women with obstetric haemorrhage who had either received ≥4 units of red blood cells (RBC), 
multicomponent blood transfusion (RBC, fresh frozen plasma and/or platelet concentrates) or plasma in 
addition to RBCs.

2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
As NovoSeven is on the EU market since 1996, previous safety experience collected in the approved 
indications is available. Due to its mechanism of action, i.e. promoting the coagulation cascade, the most 
relevant safety concern with the use of NovoSeven in severe PPH is the likelihood of developing TEs due 
to potential overstimulation of the coagulation system. In this respect, due to pregnancy and during the 
postpartum period, this patient group is already in a hypercoagulable state. The increased risk of TE, 
which is largely concerning an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) is also established 
in this new treatment population. Although the higher baseline risk of VTE in this specific patient group 
will have contributed, this increased risk of VTE is considered the most important safety issue. It can be 
debated whether or not the relationship to NovoSeven is possibly related or unlikely related, as most 
women with TEs had confounding factors that may have contributed to development of thrombosis. 
Therefore, the increased risk is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, despite confounding factors, a 
contribution of NovoSeven to occurrence of TEs cannot be excluded. This has been adequately reflected in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
NovoSeven is an activated recombinant coagulation factor VII which is structurally similar to human 
plasma factor VIIa authorised in the EU in 1996 and in the US in 1999. The approved indications include 
the treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those undergoing surgery or 
invasive procedures in patients with congenital or acquired haemophilia, haemophilia with inhibitors to 
coagulation factors VIII or IX, in patients with congenital FVII deficiency, and in patients with 
Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. The recommended initial dose, administered by intravenous bolus injection, 
is 90 μg/kg body weight. 
In this application, the indication of NovoSeven is proposed to be extended with the treatment of severe 
postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). The recommended dose range is 60 – 90 µg per kg body weight. Dose 
and dose interval are proposed to be based on clinical response and adapted to the individual patient. In 
case of insufficient haemostatic response, a second dose is proposed to be administered after 30 minutes.  
Current off-label use of NovoSeven in severe postpartum haemorrhage 
NovoSeven is not currently approved for use in severe PPH. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of 
evidence from off-label use, including patient registries and literature reports, describing the use of 
NovoSeven for the treatment of women with severe PPH. Reviews of published clinical studies and case 
reports suggest a beneficial role for NovoSeven in the management of severe PPH (Francini 2007, 2010, 
Lavigne 2015 (included in this dossier)). Off-label use of NovoSeven as a haemostatic agent in the 
treatment of PPH is recommended in several local guidelines on PPH. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of severe postpartum haemorrhage when uterotonics are 
insufficient to achieve haemostasis. 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 114/120 
 
 
 
 
  
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of PPH 
The treatment options for PPH relate to the underlying cause of haemorrhage. A combination of 
pharmacological, blood products, mechanical and surgical interventions are used presently; additionally, 
clinicians can consider the use of haemostatic agents. Several medicinal products are approved for 
treatment of PPH due to uterine atony, of which oxytocin is considered first choice. Additional medicinal 
products include methergine, prostaglandin E2 agonists (dinoprost, sulprostone). Misoprostol is used off-
label, but has less efficacy than oxytocin. Additionally, also intravenous tranexamic acid is used off-label, 
since the WOMAN trial (Shakur et al, Lancet), at the time of uterotonic treatment, has been included in 
many PPH management protocols.  
If bleeding persists after failure of uterotonics, clinicians can use a combination of haemostatic agents 
(fibrinogen), transfusion of blood products (RBC, FFP, platelets, cryoprecipitate), fluid replacement and 
minimally invasive mechanical interventions (removal of retained placenta, intrauterine balloon 
tamponade, etc) (RCOG 2016). Non-invasive mechanical methods such as uterine compression and aortic 
compression may be applied concomitantly as needed.  
It is noted that, although guidelines in standard of care will have been updated over time, in general, first 
line and second line treatments generally have not relevantly changed since the last decade, though 
existing techniques of invasive procedures will have been further refined. 
It’s agreed that there is an unmet need for approved non-invasive treatments to improve the standard of 
care in severe PPH and to avoid a hysterecrtomy or for life-saving situations. 
Additionally, Novoseven, which consists of the coagulation factor VIIa, is used off-label as an haemostatic 
agent. Various international and national guidelines have been developed for the management of PPH, 
based on collective experience and results from registry studies, in which in several the use of Novoseven 
is also included as an option. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single randomized, parallel-group, open-label multicentre 
clinical outcome trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of NovoSeven, when added to background 
standard of care in subjects with severe post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) defined as having > 1500 ml 
blood loss within 24 hours after delivery who were randomised following failure of sulprostone to control 
the bleeding one hour after onset of infusion. Further, the patient should have a gestation of > 27 weeks 
and aged 18 years or older. Patients with a personal risk of thrombosis (VTE or ATE) were excluded. 
The study included 2 treatment groups (NovoSeven versus standard therapy, 1:1 randomization). The 
Novoseven group received a single dose of approximately 60 μg/kg via slow IV injection (2mL/min) 
immediately after randomisation. The protocol primary endpoint was the absolute and relative reduction 
in need for specific second-line therapies (rate of embolisation and/or ligation) in the rFVIIa (Novoseven) 
group versus the reference group. The primary endpoint applied in the subsequent publication consisted 
of the “Reduction in the need for specific second-line therapies (at least one ligation, suture, 
embolisation, intra-uterine balloon tamponade and/or hysterectomy)”. 
The results of 4 non-interventional studies provided additional efficacy (and safety) data. These were 
based on single hospital level data from a single centre (study 4729, Bern, Switzerland), national or 
population level data from UK, DK, and NL (study 4733 PPH consortium) and 2 registries describing off-
label use of NovoSeven in non-haemophilic patients (study 4731 in CZ and study 4732 in New Zealand 
and Australia).  
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 115/120 
 
 
 
 
  
Further, data from the Novo Nordisk safety database (Argus) and from a literature review (of published 
clinical studies and case-reports) that report safety data of women with severe PPH treated with 
NovoSeven have been provided. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint RCT protocol. In the pivotal study RCT, treatment with Novoseven following failure 
of sulprostone to control the bleeding resulted in a significant relative risk reduction of 40% in the need 
for specific second-line therapies (at least one ligation or embolisation) (RR 0.60 [0.43;0.84]); 0.0012. 
The absolute risk reduction was 33.3% (14.47; 52.19). The NNT to avoid at least one second-line therapy 
was 2.6. This positive effect was independent from the delivery mode (vaginal delivery or caesarean 
section). 
Primary endpoint RCT publication. For the adapted primary endpoint in the subsequent publication of 
this RCT, treatment with NovoSeven resulted in a relative risk reduction of 44% in the need for specific 
second-line therapies (at least one ligation, suture, embolisation, intra-uterine balloon tamponade and/or 
hysterectomy) (RR 0.56 [0.42;0.76]). The absolute risk reduction was 41% (18; 63). The NNT to avoid at 
least one second-line therapy was 3. This positive effect was independent from the delivery mode. 
Secondary endpoints RCT publication. The protocol of the RCT did not include secondary endpoints. 
In the publication of the RCT, the components of the primary endpoint were tested (although not defined 
a secondary endpoints), without multiplicity correction, and therefore these analyses are considered 
exploratory. The analyses showed that the significant beneficial effect is mainly driven by a reduction in 
arterial embolisation, the procedure which was applied most frequently. In deviation from the RCT trial 
protocol, blood loss was not measured. Determination of the transfusion needs were assessed before and 
after randomization showed no between-group difference in absolute numbers of administered blood 
products (RBCs, FFP (fresh frozen plasma), and PCs (platelet cells)). Analysis of replacement treatments 
(fibrinogen concentrates, tranexamic acid (TXA), aprotinin), showed no clear between group difference in 
the use of these products. A significant greater fall in Hb concentration between T0 and T30 was noted, 
with a median decrease of −0.2 g/dL in the intervention arm and of −0.9 g/dL in the standard care arm. 
Laboratory data In the RCT, baseline fibrinogen concentration was ≥2 g/L and baseline platelet count 
were ≥50 × 109/L) in the majority of women, according to PPH guidelines (RCOG 2017). Efficacy of 
haemostatic products such as NovoSeven will be limited when fibrinogen levels or platelet count are low. 
Supportive data. Data from 4 non-interventional studies of different sources across Europe and from 
Australia/New Zealand have been provided. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Novoseven was used in addition to standard of care. At T0, the median fibrinogen levels were above the 
threshold of 2 g/L in both the NovoSeven (2.4 g/L) and reference group (3.2 g/L). After T0, the use of 
tranexamic acid and fibrinogen was permitted in the SoC in the pivotal trial. The MAH presented an 
overview of the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) and fibrinogen as additional treatment in the pivotal trial 
during the first hour after Novoseven treatment. However, the information on TXA and fibrinogen is 
incomplete as there is a substantial amount of missing data on fibrinogen and TXA. Therefore, the exact 
concomitant use of TXa and fibrinogen remains uncertain. Nevertheless, this information is considered of 
importance for prescribers and information that data collection on fibrinogen and TXA was incomplete is 
included in section 5.1 the SmPC.  
The additional data, consisting of 4 non-interventional studies of different sources across Europe and from 
Australia/New Zealand, have provided limited evidence for efficacy. Also, the non-interventional studies 
EMA/559898/2022 
Page 116/120 
 
 
 
 
  
did not provide information on dose in relation to efficacy. Hence, these studies can only be considered as 
supportive and the main evidence of efficacy comes from the RCT study 4816. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Thromboembolic events  
Due to its mechanism of action, promoting the coagulation cascade, the most relevant safety concern 
with the use of NovoSeven in severe PPH is the likelihood of developing TEs, including VTEs. In the 
pivotal trial 4816 (RCT), the incidence of VTE was increased (4.8% (2/42)) in comparison to non-treated 
patients (0% (0/42)). No TEs occurred in the 8 women in the reference group who received NovoSeven 
for compassionate use, and 1 woman in reference group received NovoSeven in error at time of 
randomisation. Based on this total of 51 women (42 randomised treatment and 9 exposed later), the 
proportion of women with TEs and VTEs accounting for the total women exposed in this trial was 2/51 
(3.9%).  
Section 4.4 of the SmPC provides the following recommendation: In severe postpartum haemorrhage and 
pregnancy, the clinical conditions (delivery, severe haemorrhage, transfusion, DIC, surgery/invasive 
procedures and coagulopathy) are known contributing factors to the thromboembolic risk; and in 
particular venous thromboembolic risk associated with the administration of NovoSeven. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
It can be debated whether or not the relationship to NovoSeven is possibly related or unlikely related, as 
most women with TEs had confounding factors that may have contributed to development of thrombosis. 
Nevertheless, despite confounding factors, a contribution of NovoSeven to occurrence of TEs cannot be 
ruled out and this will be followed-up post-approval via PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There remains a significant unmet need to optimise standard of care of severe PPH and reduce the need 
for hysterectomy and other invasive procedures. Several local guidelines describe off-label use of 
NovoSeven for management of severe PPH rather late in the treatment cascade, to avoid a hysterectomy 
or for life saving situations.  
The current application to extend the indication of NovoSeven r(FVIIa) with the treatment of severe PPH 
when uterotonics are insufficient to achieve haemostasis is primarily based on the results of a single 
pivotal well-conducted randomised controlled study, in which 8 French and Swiss hospitals participated, 
sponsored by the University of Nimes, France. The investigated primary endpoint is considered a robust 
objective outcome and highly relevant to patients in an emergency situation of severe post-partum 
haemorrhage (PPH). In the intervention arm, Novoseven treatment with 60 μg/kg was initiated when, 
according to applied French practice guidelines, first-line therapies for PPH failed.  
The results demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant reduction of 40% in need of invasive 
procedures (ligation or embolisation) when Novoseven was used on top of standard therapy. This was 
supported by the results of the publication endpoint with a reduction of 44% in invasive procedures 
extended (at least one ligation, suture, embolisation, intra-uterine balloon tamponade and/or 
hysterectomy).  
As to the relevancy of the efficacy and safety data collected in the pivotal RCT performed more than 10 
years ago, it is noted that based on the description of first line therapies, replacement therapies and 
second line invasive therapies applied, the management of severe PPH in this study in general is in 
agreement with current guidelines on management of PPH. Therefore, these results are still able to 
inform the benefit/risk of NovoSeven assessed in this study when taking into account the updated current 
standard of care for severe PPH. 
As to the dose range of 60-90 μg/kg proposed in the posology, it is noted that there was some variation 
around the target dose in the RCT (60 μg/kg) due to full vials being administered. The median NovoSeven 
dose administered in the RCT trial was 58 µg/kg, with 25 women receiving <60 µg/kg dose, 17 women 
receiving 60-90 μg/kg dose. Therefore, the proposed dose range of 60−90 µg/kg is acceptable. In 
addition, it provides flexibility for physicians to adjust the dose according to individual patient need and is 
consistent with the clinical practice of using entire vials which leads to some variation in the µg/kg dose. 
The indication was revised during the evaluation of this application to reflect the population treated in the 
RCT, i.e. the treatment of severe PPH when uterotonics are insufficient to achieve haemostasis.  
Further, the recommendation of a second dose in case of insufficient haemostatic response is considered 
acceptable, and the recommended dose interval of 30 minutes is considered adequately justified. 
As NovoSeven is on the EU market since 1996, previous safety experience collected in the approved 
indications is available. Safety data in this dossier are primarily based on the data of the RCT, but 
supported with data from the 4 non-interventional studies. Further, data from the Novo Nordisk safety 
database (Argus) and from a literature review (of published clinical studies and case-reports) that report 
safety data of women with severe PPH treated with NovoSeven. Due to its mechanism of action, 
promoting the coagulation cascade, the most relevant safety concern with the use of NovoSeven in 
severe PPH is the likelihood of developing TEs, including VTEs.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefit of NovoSeven is established in terms of a significant reduction in the need for specific second line 
therapies compared to patients on standard treatment when administered early after failure of 
conventional medical treatment in patients with severe PPH. The exact contribution of NovoSeven in the 
development of VTE in severe PPH cannot be established as both the treated patient has increased 
baseline risk due to her pregnancy/delivery status, and the condition of PPH itself and other complications 
such as caesarean section may further increase the risk of VTE. Nevertheless, VTE can be considered a 
manageable risk in most cases, and considering that this is an emergency situation to be treated within a 
hospital setting, the risk of delay in diagnosis and treatment is expected to be low. Therefore, the 
benefit/risk balance is considered positive for the treatment of severe postpartum haemorrhage when 
uterotonics are insufficient to achieve haemostasis. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Although not investigated in the RCT, the clinical relevance of a second dose is acknowledged. The 
selected 30 minute dose-interval is considered adequately supported by the available pharmacodynamic 
data of NovoSeven indicating time to maximum coagulant effect at 10 minutes after dosing, PPH 
guidelines recommending a second dose 15-30 minutes after the first dose of NovoSeven6,7 as well as the 
RCT where clinical response (evaluation of treatment effect) was evaluated within 30 minutes of 
NovoSeven administration. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Novoseven is positive for the treatment of severe PPH when uterotonics are insufficient 
to achieve haemostasis.

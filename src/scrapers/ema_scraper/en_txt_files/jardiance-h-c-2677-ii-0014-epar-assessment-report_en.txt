Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease. Recent estimates suggest that the number of people 
worldwide with diabetes is currently 382 million and is expected to reach at least 592 million within the next 
25 years. The most common form is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is characterized by insulin 
resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased glucose production by the liver.  
Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with comorbidities that exacerbate cardiovascular (CV) risk, such as 
obesity and hypertension. The risk of CV disease is increased approximately 2 to 4-fold in adults with 
diabetes. The risk of heart failure is increased more than 2-fold in patients with T2DM, and heart failure in 
these patients is associated with a poor prognosis. Recommended strategies for reducing CV risk in patients 
with T2DM include glucose management, lipid lowering, blood pressure (BP) control, smoking cessation, and 
weight loss [R14-0344]. There is a clear association between microvascular complications such as 
albuminuria and an increased risk of CV events in patients with T2DM, and improved glycaemic control has 
been associated with a reduction in microvascular events. However, the impact of reducing blood glucose 
and the potential benefit of specific glucose-lowering agents on CV events in patients with T2DM remains 
unclear and highly controversial. Thus, there is a strong clinical need to identify antihyperglycaemic agents 
that are safe and can potentially reduce cardiovascular and microvascular complications. 
Empagliflozin is a novel, orally administered, potent, and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor developed by Boehringer 
Ingelheim (BI). Empagliflozin is currently indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction 
with diet and exercise, as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to other oral antidiabetic treatments or insulin. 
Empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg once daily is approved in more than 50 countries including the EU and the 
US. 
In this application, the proposed new indications, as initially proposed by the applicant, are to reduce the risk 
of all-cause mortality by reducing CV deaths and to reduce the risk of CV death or hospitalisation for heart

failure, in patients with T2DM and high CV risk. The proposed indications are based on the results from the 
EMPA-REG OUTCOME (trial 1245.25). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non- clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided a justification for not submitting an environmental assessment update.   
As the target population and the maximum daily dose (25 mg) are not changed as a result of this variation, 
the CHMP agrees that the ERA submitted with the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In this dossier, (only) the results of the cardiovascular outcome trial are presented. In this outcome trial, 
limited PK data were collected. The design of the trial is discussed below under clinical efficacy. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Limited pharmacokinetic data were collected during the EMPA-REG trial. No changes to the product 
documentation are proposed. 
Steady-state morning trough concentrations of empagliflozin were evaluated on Days 85 and 364. In this 
study patients were treated with Empagliflozin 10mg or 25mg once daily. Empagliflozin trough 
concentrations were similar within each dose group at both time points indicating that steady-state 
concentrations of empagliflozin were maintained during the course of the trial. The increase in empagliflozin 
exposure with dose was roughly proportional to dose. 
Empagliflozin exposures were generally similar in men and women at both dose levels. There were no 
relevant changes in empagliflozin exposure with an increase in gender, age or body weight. No specific 
trends were observed by geographic region or country. There were no major differences in exposure in 
different races or ethnicities. Empagliflozin exposure increased with a decrease in renal function. These 
findings are consistent with the results of the previous population pharmacokinetic analysis.

In subjects with renal insufficiency, dose-normalised geometric mean plasma trough concentrations are 
increased up to 2.8 fold in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with a normal renal 
function (Figure 1). These results are in line with the previously observed higher AUCss of empagliflozin in 
patients with renal impairment as reflected in the current SmPC. 
Figure 1.  Comparison of dose normalised plasma through concentrations of empagliflozin after multiple 
oral administration in patients by renal impairment. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacodynamic data were submitted. For results regarding HbA1c and FPG, please refer to the 
section on Further Efficacy endpoints (see section 2.4.1). 
Mechanism of action 
The current SmPC contains information about the regulation of glucose by empagliflozin. However, the 
proposed CV prevention indication likely has another mode of action that is not directly related to glycaemic 
control. This is even more relevant in subjects with renal insufficiency, where the effect on glycaemic control 
was limited but the effect for CV prevention is preserved. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
In this application, a single trial is submitted (EMPA-REG, 1245.25). This trial is discussed below and 
summarised in Table 16.

of BI 10773 (10 mg and 25 mg administered orally once daily) compared to usual care in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus patients with increased cardiovascular risk. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study was performed in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk who had insufficient glycaemic 
control despite diet and exercise and were either treatment-naïve (drug-naïve) or receiving any antidiabetic 
background therapy.  
The inclusion criteria specify a population at high risk for CV events, specified by the combination of T2DM 
and a history of CV disease, defined as at least one of the following:  
 
 
confirmed history of myocardial infarction (MI) (>2 months prior to informed consent);  
evidence of coronary artery disease (in ≥2 major coronary arteries or single vessel coronary artery 
disease (significant stenosis with positive non-invasive stress test or with previous hospitalisation 
for unstable angina); last episode of unstable angina >2 months prior to informed consent);  
  history of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke (>2 months prior to informed consent);  
  presence of peripheral artery disease (symptomatic or not).  
Patients could only be included if glycaemic control was insufficient (HbA1c 7-9% for treatment-naïve 
patients, 7-10% for patients already on glucose-lowering therapy). 
Contrary to the current SmPC of Jardiance, subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR between 30 
and 60 ml/min 1.73m2) were fully eligible for all treatments. 
Treatments 
Empagliflozin was administered in 10 mg or 25 mg doses once daily and compared to placebo. The study 
treatment is in line with the current SmPC of Jardiance for subjects with normal renal function or mild renal 
impairment (eGFR > 60 ml/min 1.73m2).  
However, according to the SmPC for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR between 45 and 
60 ml/min 1.73m2) only the 10 mg dose should be used and therapy should not be initiated. Therapy should 
be withdrawn if the eGFR remains below 45 ml/min 1.73m2. 
All patients received trial medication on top of standard-of-care treatment, which could be adapted if 
indicated. Background antidiabetic medication was to be kept stable in the first 12 weeks but could be 
changed thereafter to achieve standard of care according to investigator’s discretion and local guidelines. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this event-driven study was to determine non-inferiority (with a non-inferiority 
margin of 1.3) and subsequently superiority of empagliflozin treatment (2 pooled doses, 10 mg once daily 
and 25 mg once daily) vs. placebo based on the composite of 3 major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE): cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal MI in patients with T2DM and increased 
cardiovascular risk. The procedure guaranteed control of the type 1 error. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of 3-point MACE (major adverse cardiovascular 
events; composite of any of the following: cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction). The key secondary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of 4-point MACE (cardiovascular 
death, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris). 
Assessment report  
EMA/11728/2017 
Page 10/62 
 
  
  
 
These events were prospectively adjudicated using pre-specified definitions by an independent clinical 
events committee (CEC), blinded to treatment allocation.  
In addition, around 40 secondary and other endpoints were analysed. 
Sample size 
The primary hypothesis originally aimed to assess the non-inferiority of empagliflozin versus placebo based 
on a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the hazard ratio but later this was amended (see below) to a 
non-inferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 1.3 and 90% power, 
with a significance level of 0.025 (one-sided), with the empagliflozin and placebo patients in 2:1 ratio, a 
minimum of 691 events were required to achieve the primary aim of the trial (using a Haybittle-Peto 
boundary that preserved 0.0249 of the alpha for the final analysis). The trial would continue until a minimum 
of 691 patients had experienced an adjudicated primary outcome event. 
While the number of required events was independent of the accrual and follow-up time and independent of 
the yearly event rates, the number of patients to be randomised was dependent on these parameters. To 
obtain the minimum 691 events, based on 7000 patients, assuming an accrual period of 24 months, a yearly 
event rate of 1.5%, and a randomisation rate of 3500 patients/year, the trial duration was anticipated to be 
just under 8 years. The planned treatment duration of the patients was therefore up to 8 years, with 
approximately 8 years (approximately 420 weeks) as the planned total duration of trial. With a minimum of 
691 events, the trial would have at least 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.785 (corresponding to a 
21.5% risk reduction in cardiovascular outcome events) for the primary endpoint. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (empagliflozin 10 mg; empagliflozin 25 mg; 
placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified in a balanced ratio for HbA1c (<8.5 or ≥8.5% at 
screening), BMI (<30 or ≥30 kg/m2 at randomisation), geographical regions (North America, Latin America, 
Europe, Africa, and Asia), and renal function at screening (normal: eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2; mild 
impairment: eGFR 60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2; moderate impairment: eGFR 30 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73m2).  
Blinding (masking) 
The placebo run-in period of this trial was performed open-label, i.e. both the investigator and the patient 
knew that the patient received placebo during the run-in period. The randomised period of this trial was 
performed double-blind according to current standards. The interim analysis was performed by a separate 
team. 
Statistical methods 
For confirmatory testing, the hazard ratio (HR) of empagliflozin (10 mg and 25 mg combined; designated as 
“all empagliflozin” in the document) to placebo was to be analysed with a Cox proportional hazards 
regression model. Non-inferiority on the primary endpoint was to be tested based on the non-inferiority 
margin of 1.3 and the overall significance level of alpha=0.025 (1-sided). If non-inferiority for the primary 
endpoint could be established for the 1.3 margin, non-inferiority would be tested for the key secondary 
endpoint based on the same margin. If non-inferiority was established for both endpoints, superiority was to 
be tested for the primary endpoint and then the key secondary endpoint. The significance level of the final 
analysis was slightly adapted due to an interim analysis of the trial data.  
The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested for non-inferiority and superiority using a 4-step 
hierarchical testing strategy, which will protect the overall type I error. The non-inferiority margin was set at 
1.3.  
A number of additional secondary and further endpoints related to CV safety and microvascular safety were 
analysed in an exploratory manner, based on adjudicated events, reported adverse events, or laboratory

data. These included the components of the composite CV and microvascular endpoints as individual 
endpoints, as well as a composite of heart failure requiring hospitalisation or CV death, all-cause mortality, 
and a composite of new or worsening nephropathy. 
The main analysis for each endpoint followed the “intent-to-treat (ITT)” principle, using the treated set (TS) 
and including all events up to individual trial completion. In addition, on-treatment analyses for CV 
endpoints based on the “treatment-emergent” principle were performed using the on-treatment set (OS, 
included only patients with at least 30 days of cumulative treatment and considered only events up to 30 
days after treatment stop). Furthermore, analyses using the TS with various lengths of follow-up time (such 
as 7 or 30 days) after treatment stop were performed for CV endpoints (see Figure 2 below). 
Figure 2.  Illustration of the analyses based on the TS and OS 
The primary analysis will be on the ITT population and performed with a Cox proportional hazards model, 
stratified by age, sex, baseline categories of BMI, baseline HbA1c, baseline eGFR values and geographical 
region, performed on the ITT population. This is considered standard for time to event endpoints. For 
sensitivity analyses, the primary endpoint was further tested in the on-treatment set and the per-protocol 
set. Secondary and exploratory time-to-event endpoints used the same analysis model as the primary 
endpoint. UACR and eGFR were analysed with the mixed model repeated measures approach (MMRM), using 
the observed data. Other categorical endpoints were analysed using an ANCOVA model with LOCF. An 
interim analysis was performed in 2012 to provide data for a cardiovascular meta-analysis submitted in the 
initial marketing application. The overall type I error rate was maintained at a one-sided significance level of 
0.025 using a Haybittle-Peto correction, resulting in α=0.0001 for the interim analysis and 0.0249 for the 
final analysis, to protect the overall type I error at 0.025 one-sided.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 7020 patients treated with randomised trial medication, 97.0% of the patients completed the trial. 
Vital status information at the end of the trial was available for all but 53 patients (0.8%). Disposition in 
terms of trial completion and the availability of vital status was balanced across the 3 treatment groups 
(Figure 3). The proportions of patients who prematurely discontinued trial medication were higher in the 
placebo group than in the empagliflozin groups; the most frequent reasons were adverse events (placebo: 
13.0%; empagliflozin 10 mg: 11.4%; empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.7%).

Recruitment 
This trial was a multi-centre trial conducted globally. A total of 11531 patients signed informed consent, i.e. 
were screened or enrolled, at 609 centres in 42 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Latin 
America and Australia/New Zealand (the last 2 countries were grouped with North America for the purpose 
of the analyses). The first patient was enrolled into this trial on 26 Aug 2010. The last on-site visit of a 
patient took place on 13 Apr 2015. The last contact date with any patient in the trial was 21 Apr 2015.  
The majority of randomised patients came from Europe (41.1%) and North America (19.8%).  
Conduct of the study 
This trial was conducted according to the original trial protocol dated 10 May 2010 and its revisions. There 
were 4 global protocol amendments leading to 4 global protocol revisions (dated 22 Sep 2010, 22 Apr 2011, 
29 Dec 2011, 15 Oct 2013).  
With amendment nr 3, prior to the interim analysis, the non-inferiority margin was reduced from 1.8 to 1.3 
and the sample size increased accordingly from 4000 to 7000 patients to meet regulatory requirements. The 
required number of events increased from 137 to 691. The anticipated treatment duration of the patients 
was changed from 3-4 years to 6-8 years.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11728/2017 
Page 13/62 
 
  
  
 
Also with amendment nr 3, the primary endpoint was reworded to make it clear that silent MI was not 
included in the definition (time to the first occurrence of MACE-3). 
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced across the 3 treatment groups. For brevity, 
only overall data are shown and no breakdown per group (Table 1). 
Of note, slightly fewer patients in the placebo group compared to ‘all empagliflozin’ reported a history of

In the placebo group, more medications were introduced during the trial, especially antidiabetic (31.5% 
placebo v. 19.5% empagliflozin) and anti-hypertensive (51.0% v 44.5%).

Numbers analysed 
Several analysis sets were defined for the various analyses in this trial. An overview of the number of 
patients in each analysis set is provided in the table below. The treated set (TS) was used for the primary 
analysis. It comprised all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and thus 
excluded 8 randomised but not treated patients.

Table 2.  Patient analysis sets 
The RS, TS, FAS, PPS and OS all included at least 98.2% of randomised patients in each group and thus 
largely overlap. 
According to the disposition of patients, 1780 (25.4%) of patients prematurely discontinued trial medication. 
In line with the ITT principle these patients were followed up and remained in the trial. The results in these 
patients were consistent with the on-treatment and per protocol analyses. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: 3-point MACE 
The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death (including fatal stroke and 
fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The primary analysis based on the TS 
showed superiority of “all empagliflozin” treatment to placebo (Table 3).

Exploratory analyses were performed for the individual empagliflozin doses. The results were consistent with 
those for “all empagliflozin”, with no relevant differences observed between the 2 doses. The similarity of the 
hazard ratio point estimate of “all empagliflozin” and the 2 doses supports the robustness of the primary 
analysis. Due to the smaller sample size (thus a loss of statistical power) in the analysis for the individual 
doses, the p-values of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg vs. placebo treatment were not significant (p>0.05;

The primary analysis based on TS described above included all events until individual trial completion, 
following the ITT principle. Results from the sensitivity and additional analyses (such as on-treatment 
analysis and analysis based on the per-protocol set) were generally consistent with the results of the primary 
analysis, but in the per protocol analysis statistical significance was not reached (Table 3 and Table 5 
below).  
The breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 3-point MACE for 
empagliflozin was primarily due to the lower frequency of CV death (Table 6 below). Assessments of the

Key secondary endpoint: 4-point MACE 
The key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, 
non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris. Empagliflozin (doses pooled) was 
non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo based on this endpoint (Table  7 below). The result of the additional 
component in the 4-point MACE, hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris, showed no significant 
difference between empagliflozin and placebo treatment.

1 Based on the reduced alpha level of 0.0249 resulting from the interim analysis 
The results from the analyses of the individual empagliflozin doses vs. placebo were consistent with those for 
“all empagliflozin”, with no relevant differences observed between the 2 doses. Results from all sensitivity 
analyses were consistent with the results of the main analysis following the ITT principle. 
Component: CV death (and all-cause mortality) 
The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and the 
individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences between the 
two empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, but also non-CV death was 
numerically reduced in the empagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group (Table 8 below). The 
additional analyses using an on-treatment approach showed results consistent with the main analyses 
following the ITT analysis principle. Also, an analysis for time to all-cause mortality assuming all 36 patients 
lost to follow up in the empagliflozin groups as deceased further confirmed the robustness of the main 
analysis (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93; post hoc). The analyses of subgroups (including by age, sex, renal 
function, glucose control and medication use at baseline; performed for CV death and all-cause mortality 
post hoc) showed consistent results across all subgroups. 
The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths were “other CV death”, including fatal events deemed 
not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and 
worsening of heart failure (30). The majority of the non-CV deaths at system organ class (SOC) level were 
benign, malignant and unspecified neoplasms (incl. cysts and polyps; 69 of 154 patients with non-CV 
deaths) and infections and infestations (37). 
For both CV death and all-cause mortality, the separation of the event rates between empagliflozin and 
placebo started shortly after trial onset and was maintained throughout the trial (Figure 8).

Component: Stroke and Cerebrovascular disease-related outcomes 
For stroke (fatal/non-fatal), non-fatal stroke, and transient ischaemic attack (TIA), no significant difference 
was observed between empagliflozin and placebo (Table 10). Strokes were classified into ischaemic, 
haemorrhagic, and type not assessable by the CEC neurology. The majority of confirmed strokes were 
ischaemic.

Although not statistically significant, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was above 1. Therefore 
stroke results were further investigated. In the TS analysis including all events up to individual trial 
completion, the Kaplan-Meier estimates showed almost no difference between empagliflozin (both doses) 
and placebo in the probability of stroke up to Day 600; thereafter, empagliflozin 10 mg started to separate 
from placebo, and empagliflozin 25 mg after about Day 900 (Figure 9). For patients in Europe, the 
differences are larger and the separation appears earlier (around Day 180) for both doses (Figure 10). 
When analysing treatment-emergent stroke using a cut-off for the observation period after treatment stop 
(7, 30, 90 days after treatment stop on TS; 30 days after treatment stop on OS; see Figure 2), the results 
showed no significant differences between empagliflozin and placebo, and the hazard ratio point estimate 
shifted towards unity when compared with the analysis of all events following the ITT analysis principle 
(Figure 10). The difference between empagliflozin and placebo in the ITT analysis was largely caused by 
more events occurring beyond 90 days after treatment stop in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 11 patients 
with stroke; 25 mg: 7 patients) than in the placebo group (3 patients). 
In the subgroup analyses of time to first stroke, a nominal treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-value <0.05 
was observed for the parameters baseline HbA1c and geographic region.

Heart failure-related outcomes 
Heart failure endpoints were analysed in exploratory manner. The risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” 
group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences 
between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups (Table 11). The additional analyses using an on-treatment 
approach showed results consistent with the main analyses which followed the ITT principle. The analyses of 
subgroups (including by age, sex, renal function, glucose control, cardiac failure based on SMQ, diuretics 
and other medication use at baseline; performed for the first 2 heart failure endpoints) showed consistent 
results across all subgroups. Moreover, the frequencies of patients with AEs requiring hospitalisation (a 
criterion for SAE) were numerically lower in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 32.0%; 25 mg: 34.9%) than 
placebo (36.5%)

Composite microvascular endpoints 
The composite microvascular outcome was defined as the time to first occurrence of any of the following 
nephropathy or eye related events: 
  New or worsening nephropathy defined as any of the following: 
o  New onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) 
o  Doubling of serum creatinine level accompanied by an eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73m2  
o 
Initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy  
o  Death due to renal disease 
  Diabetic eye complications 
o 
Initiation of retinal photocoagulation 
o  Vitreous haemorrhage 
o  Diabetes-related blindness (included any blindness reported) 
For the two composite microvascular outcome endpoints, the risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” 
group compared with the placebo group (patients with event placebo: 424 (20.5%); all empa: 577 (14.0%); 
HR 0.62 95% CI: 0.54, 0.70). There was a similar treatment effect for the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. The 
majority of the events of the microvascular outcome endpoints were new onset of nephropathy (see the 
section below). For all diabetic eye complication endpoints, the incidence rates were low 
(<5/1000 patient-year) and no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo.

Nephropathy-related endpoints 
Nephropathy composite endpoints and components as independent endpoints 
For the composite nephropathy endpoints (“new or worsening nephropathy” and “new or worsening 
nephropathy or CV death”), the risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and the individual dose 
groups compared with the placebo group. There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin 
dose groups (Table 12). The Kaplan-Meier estimation of cumulative probability of events are shown in Figure 
13 and for the composite “new or worsening nephropathy” Figure 14. The analyses of subgroups (including 
by age, sex, renal function, glucose control and medication use at baseline; post hoc) showed consistent 
beneficial treatment effects across all subgroups.

New onset of albuminuria (UACR ≥30 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/g) 
While the risk of new onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR>300 mg/g) was reduced in the empagliflozin groups 
compared with the placebo group (Table 12), no significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo 
was observed for new onset of albuminuria (UACR ≥30 mg/g; Table 13 below).

Reversibility of albuminuria 
For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) at 
baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin 
than with placebo, which started shortly after trial onset and was maintained throughout the trial. There 
were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups (Table 14 below)

eGFR change over time 
When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo 
group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the 
empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than in 
the placebo group after about a year (Figure 15). About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased 
from the last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m2 in the empagliflozin groups, while no change 
was seen in the placebo group.

Further Efficacy endpoints 
This outcome study was designed to investigate the long-term CV safety of empagliflozin. The analyses of 
HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP considered all available data including values obtained 
post-treatment and after the intake of rescue medication (OC-AD), to match the analyses used for the 
outcome events following the ITT analysis principle.  
Of note, in this trial, adjustments to concomitant medications, including those that affect glycaemic control, 
blood pressure, etc., could be made at the discretion of the investigator to achieve best standard of care. 
Reductions in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP, and DBP were seen for empagliflozin compared with placebo at 
Week 94 (52 for body weight), the time point corresponding to the treatment duration all patients could 
reach in this trial (Table 15 below). The higher dose showed better efficacy, but the differences were small.

Ancillary analyses 
Ancillary analyses 
The subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3A (defined as eGFR 45 to 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and CKD stage 3B (30 to <45 ml/min/1.73 m2) are described in detail because 
currently, empagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients with persistent eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 
and the MAH seeks authorisation for use in these patients.  
The CV and nephropathy endpoints were analysed according to the eGFR categories ≥90, 60 to <90, 45 to 
<60, <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. In total 1249 patients had a baseline eGFR in the category of CKD 3A (45 to 
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2). In total 570 patients had a baseline eGFR of <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, of whom 543 had 
30 to <45 ml/min/1.73 m2. Although eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 at screening was an exclusion criterion, 27 
patients had an eGFR value of <30 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline, which was measured about 3 weeks after 
screening. These 27 patients were pooled with patients with eGFR of 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline 
which can be considered conservative. 
For the CV endpoints analysed, the treatment differences between the eGFR subgroups were small and 
treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were >0.05. The hazard ratio point estimates for patients with 
CKD 3A or 3B were in line with subjects with better renal function.  
Also for new or worsening nephropathy, no relevant treatment differences were observed between the eGFR 
subgroups and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were >0.05. The hazard ratio point estimates 
for patients with CKD 3A and 3B were similar to those of the overall study population

Design 
A Phase III, multicentre, international, randomised, parallel group, double blind 
cardiovascular safety study of BI 10773 (10 mg and 25 mg administered orally once daily) 
compared to usual care in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with increased cardiovascular risk. 
The EMPA-REG OUTCOME Trial 
EudraCT 2009-016178-33  
BI Trial Number: 1245.25 
This was a randomised, double-blind, multinational, parallel group, event driven study with 3 
treatment groups. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to empagliflozin 10 mg once daily, 
empagliflozin 25 mg once daily, or placebo, as add-on to standard of care treatment, 
including for diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. After screening, all eligible patients 
underwent a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period before randomisation. The end of 
study visit was to take place within ±7 days of a scheduled visit date after the last dose of 
study medication for patients who prematurely discontinued or at study closure for patients 
ongoing when the required number of outcome events was anticipated to have been reached 
for the trial. A final follow-up visit was planned 30 days after the end of treatment visit. 
Patients who discontinued or withdrew from trial medication after randomisation (Visit 3 and 
beyond) were to be followed up until the end of the study using the same visit schedule until 
the end of the trial. The observational period for a patient was from randomisation until the 
last visit after study closure announcement (including 30 days after the last ontreatment 
visit). The planned treatment duration was anticipated to be approximately 6 and 8 years 
(approximately 300 to 420 weeks), depending on the expected accrual period of 2 years and 
the assumed 3-point MACE event rate and the different times at which patients were 
randomised. The actual study duration depended on the first occurrence of primary outcome 
events; a minimum of 691 patients with adjudicated primary outcome events were required 
for the primary analysis. 
An independent external committee (Clinical Event Committee) was established to adjudicate 
centrally and in a blinded fashion, all fatal events and events suspected of stroke, myocardial 
ischaemia (incl. myocardial infarction), cardiac failure, and coronary revascularization 
procedures, as detailed in the CEC charter. Additionally, specified events of cancer and 
hepatic events were adjudicated by external independent committees. A project based data 
monitoring committee (DMC), independent of the sponsor was established to monitor patient 
safety across several phase IIb/III empagliflozin trials, and to advise the sponsor whether to 
continue, modify, or stop one or all trials involved. A Steering Committee was established to 
provide scientific leadership for the design and conduct of this study and interpretation of 
data.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of the clinical study 
EMPA-REG was a cardiovascular outcome trial in type 2 diabetes patients. The primary objective of such trial 
is to exclude a harmful effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. MACE-3 was the primary endpoint for 
the trial, which is the preferred endpoint for safety studies according to EMA guidance(Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 
Rev. 1)). MACE-4 was assessed as key secondary endpoint which can be accepted. The primary and key 
secondary endpoints were assessed for both non-inferiority and superiority. 
The inclusion criteria specify a population with T2DM at especially high risk for CV events, specified by a 
history of at least one CV event such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease or significant 
coronary artery disease. Contrary to the current SmPC of Jardiance, subjects with moderate renal 
insufficiency (eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min 1.73m2) were fully eligible for treatment both with 10 mg and 
25 mg empagliflozin OD. Patients could only be included if glycaemic control was insufficient.  
The population that was actually investigated, included 41.1% subjects from Europe and 44.6% of subjects 
were above 65 years of age. This is considered representative for the European T2DM population with 
documented atherosclerotic disease. The previously excluded population with eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 
was represented by 570 (8.1%) of subjects. 
The sample size estimations are considered adequate. The event rates were around 4 %/year and higher 
than anticipated (2%/year). This emphasizes that the patients were at very high risk indeed. Compared to 
the original planning, the trial was shorter and retention was higher than expected as the trial was ended 
(according to plan) when a sufficient number of events was observed. 
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (empagliflozin 10 mg; empagliflozin 25 mg; 
placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified in a balanced ratio for HbA1c (<8.5 or ≥8.5% at 
screening), BMI (<30 or ≥30 kg/m2 at randomisation), geographical regions (North America, Latin America, 
Europe, Africa, and Asia), and renal function at screening (normal: eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2; mild 
impairment: eGFR 60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2; moderate impairment: eGFR 30 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73m2). As 
these factors are prognostically important, this stratification helped to ensure baseline comparability of the 
treatment groups. There are no concerns related to randomisation or blinding or group differences in 
baseline characteristics. 
The type-I error was adequately preserved for the primary and key secondary endpoints (MACE-3 and 
MACE-4) by a hierarchical approach including both non-inferiority and superiority testing. However, the 
results of all other endpoints were exploratory and should be considered hypothesis-generating. According 
to the Points to consider on application with 1. meta-analyses; 2. one pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), 
the minimum requirement for authorisation is generally one controlled study with statistically compelling 
and clinically relevant results and it is regulatory practice that evidence from a single pivotal trial is generally 
required to be stronger than the nominal level used in an application with multiple pivotal trials. In addition, 
internal and external validity, clinical relevance, data quality and internal consistency should be supportive. 
The phase-3 results submitted with the original MAA are primarily supportive for safety. While the primary 
endpoint and the mortality data are considered highly reliable, all endpoints besides MACE-3 and MACE-4 in 
EMPA-REG were exploratory and for these exploratory results the effect of chance findings is an important 
concern.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) showed superiority of “all empagliflozin” treatment to placebo. The 
results were similar in exploratory analyses for both empagliflozin doses. Due to the wider confidence 
intervals, these results were not statistically significant. The exploratory breakdown of the first event for 
3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 3-point MACE for empagliflozin was primarily due to the 
lower frequency of CV death. The results of the per protocol analysis (PPA) and sensitivity analyses were 
generally consistent, but in the PPA statistical significance was not reached. 
Some subgroups of the primary endpoint deserve further attention: 
 
The results for the subgroups age: 50-<65 years and weight: 70-80 kg were inconsistent with both 
lower and higher subgroups. There was, however, no trend in the results across age and weight 
classes (Figure 5, 6).  
 
The results in users of thiazolidinediones and DPP4-inhibitors showed trends in the wrong direction 
(HR 1.13 and 1.27 respectively for all empa, see also Figure 7). This is especially surprising as these 
products have been linked to cardiac failure in the past. For thiazolidinediones the mortality results 
were in line with the overall trial result, but for DPP-4 inhibitors the estimate of the HR for CV 
mortality was > 1. 
 
The results in Black or African American patients (n = 357; HR: 1.48) showed trends in the wrong 
direction.  This was driven by strokes and MI, while the effects on CV mortality and HF were 
apparently maintained. However, as also the trend for all-cause mortality was unfavourable, the 
uncertainties regarding this subgroup have been mentioned in 4.4 (SmPC). 
 
The results in subjects with normal renal function (eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) were less favourable 
than the results with impaired renal function, especially on the component ‘stroke’ (see below). 
 
The benefits in Europe and North America were smaller than in Latin America and Asia (see below).  
In the end, the results in these subgroups were considered consistent with the overall trial results based on 
statistical considerations. 
For the key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) empagliflozin (doses pooled) was non-inferior, but not 
superior, to placebo. The results for 10 and 25 mg were similar. 
The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and 
the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group. Again, there were no obvious differences 
between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. The majority of all deaths were CV deaths, and non-CV death was 
numerically reduced in the empagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group.  
Although mortality (all-cause and non-CV) was only tested in an exploratory way, the results are considered 
robust. Both CV-mortality and non-CV mortality favoured empagliflozin. Vital status information was 
available for all but 53 patients. The benefit for empagliflozin was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis 
assuming all empagliflozin treated-patients lost to follow up had died. 
The mortality results were obtained in addition to standard of care which included blood pressure-lowering 
medications (used by 95% of patients at baseline), lipid-lowering medications (81%), and anticoagulants 
(89%, in the vast majority anti-platelets), most of which have been proven to decrease CV death. The 
reduction in the risk of death can be translated into a number needed to treat (NNT) of 39 to prevent 1 death 
in 3.1 years. There was a rapid response to empagliflozin treatment, with a lower probability of death for 
empagliflozin with the curves separating from placebo as early as the first month based on the Kaplan-Meier 
estimates. The probability of death continued to separate throughout the observation period. The magnitude 
of the effect is in line with that seen in the outcome trials that established the use of statins or ACEi /ARBs. 
(angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers).

The positive effect of antidiabetics on macrovascular complications has until now only been demonstrated 
for metformin (UKPDS 34 study). This is the first time since 1998 that the efficacy of an antidiabetic 
medicinal product in decreasing cardiovascular events has been shown in a large clinical trial. In the case of 
EMPA-REG the effect on MACE-3 was largely driven by the effect on cardiovascular death. Cardiovascular 
mortality is the most important mortality in type 2 diabetes. 
For all myocardial infarction-related endpoints, no significant difference was observed between 
empagliflozin and placebo, but the point estimate slightly favoured empagliflozin (non-fatal MI, HR: 0.87; 
95% CI 0.70, 1.09). Silent MI, defined as single flagged ECG and not confirmed by the adjudication 
committee, was not part of the primary endpoint. All of these flagged ECG cases were sent to the central 
adjudication committee for assessing any outcome events. The outcome of unconfirmed single flagged ECG 
favoured placebo (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.70, 2.33). The unconfirmed single flagged ECG defined as ‘silent MI’ 
was only assessable in a limited number of patients, as it required an ECG at baseline without major 
abnormalities and excluded patients with prior MI-related adjudicated outcome events. The fact that the 
primary endpoint was reworded regarding silent MIs raised questions as to whether this could have been a 
modification potentially based on unblinded data, and not a clarification as described in the study report. The 
MAH clarified that silent MI had never been a part of the primary endpoint and justified the reasons for this. 
Although not statistically significant in the primary analysis, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was 
clearly above 1 (non-fatal stroke; HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.92, 1.67). The MAH has compared the On-treatment 
set (+30 days) with the Treated set and concludes that this result is driven by events during observation 
after treatment (23 empa, 3 placebo). In the subgroup of patients in Europe, the adverse effect was larger, 
is already evident in the Kaplan-Meijer curve at 180 days and even reached statistical significance (HR 2.04, 
95% CI 1.26-3.29). In light of this finding, the results for other selected endpoints (as reported in the study 
report) in Europe were summarized (Figure 17). This shows that the results for MACE-3 and all its 
components, and also, MACE-4 in Europe (and North America) are less favourable than the overall trial 
results. No plausible explanation for the findings in Europe was found, which may be attributable to chance. 
In general, the excess of strokes during treatment with empagliflozin (if not chance) may be partly related 
to the decrease of circulating blood volume, which can be seen as an increased haematocrit in the 
empagliflozin treated groups. This latter finding has been described in 4.8 (SmPC). 
Apparently, the mortality benefits are not explained by a risk reduction for atherosclerotic events. Instead, 
the MAH suggests that a reduction of heart failure related events may be one of the factors driving the 
benefit. The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths were “other CV death”, including fatal events 
deemed not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and 
worsening of heart failure (30). This pattern could indeed be compatible with mortality from heart failure. 
Heart failure is highly prevalent in patients with diabetes (e.g. 22% of those aged ≥65 years) and associated 
with increased mortality (in the referenced study a 5-year survival rate of only 12.5%) [Bertoni AG, Diabetes 
Care 2004]. Heart failure related endpoints were predefined (but exploratory) in the EMPA-REG study. For all 
heart failure endpoints, the risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and the individual dose groups 
compared with the placebo group (Hospitalisation for heart failure: HR: 0.65). 
The exploratory composite nephropathy endpoint “new or worsening nephropathy” was reduced for both 
empa doses (HR all empa: 0.61 ). This was primarily driven by “New onset of macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 
mg/g)”. No obvious difference between empagliflozin and placebo was observed for new onset of 
albuminuria (HR 0.95 ).  
For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) at 
baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin 
than with placebo (patients with improvement, HR > 1 favours empa: microalbuminuria HR 1.43 ; 
macroalbuminuria: HR 1.82 ). There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. 
These results are maintained in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency.

All patients had cardiovascular disorders, and it seems obvious that this patient population had also 
nefrangioscleroses. Moreover, most patients in this trail were already diagnosed with a renal insufficiency. 
Although the incidence rates for decreased renal function were lower in the empagliflozin group, the 
microvascular endpoint ‘nephropathy’ should be taken with special consideration, since: 
  19,5% of the included patients were diagnosed with a ‘diabetic nephropathy’, and were equally 
divided in different groups. Since however the diagnosis of nephropathy was based on the 
measurement of eGFR and not based on a pathological diagnosis due to a renal biopsy, the 
distinction between a diabetic nephropathy and an ischemic nephropathy due to cardiovascular 
diseases could not be made. Moreover, in practice only a subset of patients with diabetes type II 
have typical diabetes glomerulopathy in biopsies. Therefore it is not sure how many patients indeed 
had a diabetic nephropathy in this study population 
  Microalbuminuria is a common feature of aging and can be associated with a large number of acute 
and chronic inflammatory as well as vascular pathologies. Furthermore, microalbuminuria is often 
transient and reversible. Therefore, the adverse event of albuminuria should be taken with some 
reservation, albuminuria is not a specific parameter for renal insufficiency. 
When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo 
group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the 
empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than in 
the placebo group after about a year. About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from the 
last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m2 in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was seen 
in the placebo group. These data suggest that the initial decrease seen with empagliflozin treatment is 
haemodynamic in nature.  
Taken together, prevention of new albuminuria, reversal of existing albuminuria and prevention of the usual 
decline of eGFR in type 2 diabetes patients all suggest that empagliflozin may be important in the prevention 
and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. This result was an exploratory finding in EMPA-REG and requires 
further confirmation. Many questions are still open, e.g. the development of eGFR in subjects with impaired 
renal function and how these potential benefits interact with other medicinal products, either usually 
beneficial (ACE-inhibitors) or detrimental (NSAIDs). 
The underlying nephro-protective mechanism of empagliflozin is not clear but may at least partly be due to 
the attenuation of renal hyperfiltration via tubulo-glomerular feedback mechanisms [Skrtic M, Diabetologia, 
2014; Cherney DZI, Circulation, 2013]. Renal hyperfiltration results in increased glomerular pressure and 
can lead to albuminuria, renal function decline, and renal impairment. Altered hemodynamics may also 
explain the improvement seen in the occurrence of heart failure and either directly or indirectly contribute to 
the improvement of cardiovascular mortality.  
In EMPA-REG, patients could be included with any eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73m2 and they were eligible for both 
dose levels of empagliflozin. The MAH proposes to lift the restriction for use in patients with moderate renal 
insufficiency based on these results. 
Based on the analysis of MACE-3, all-cause and CV mortality, it can be agreed that the results for moderate 
renal insufficiency are in line with the overall trial results. Exploratory results for heart failure requiring 
hospitalisation and new or worsening nephropathy suggest that the efficacy is at least maintained with 
worsening renal function.  
Efficacy for glycaemic control in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency was similar to previous results. In 
these patients, no clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control has been shown. Although empagliflozin has 
shown beneficial CV effects in these patients, the inclusion in SmPC section 4.2  (as proposed by the 
applicant) of patients with eGFR below 45 ml/min/1.73m2  was not supported by the CHMP, as glycaemic 
Assessment report

efficacy is considered essential for any diabetes product. Therefore, the posology in patients with renal 
impairment should remain unchanged. 
The efficacy data for both dose levels tested were highly comparable for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. There were slight advantages for the higher dose in parameters like, HbA1c, FPG, blood pressure 
and weight; only in subjects with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73m2. For the proposed CV prevention indication, the 
higher dose has no advantages. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
EMPA-REG was a well-designed and well-conducted trial. The trial showed superiority of empagliflozin to 
placebo on the primary outcome MACE-3, which was driven by benefits on CV mortality; effect shown on 
all-cause mortality was consistent. Exploratory results suggest that prevention of heart failure and less 
worsening nephropathy may explain the findings. However, for an application based on a single pivotal trial, 
the inconsistent additional endpoints (stroke, silent MI) and inconsistent subgroups (especially Europe) raise 
concerns. The included population was at especially high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the results cannot 
be directly extrapolated to the entire diabetic population. 
In the population with eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73m2, in which empagliflozin is currently not 
recommended, the benefits seem maintained. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In phase 3, the overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with empagliflozin was similar to 
placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was hypoglycaemia when used with sulphonylurea 
or insulin. Increased urination and volume depletion are directly related to the mode of action. Genital and 
urinary tract infections are common. 
Although CV and microvascular outcome events are defined as safety endpoints in the trial protocol, their 
analyses are described in the efficacy section in this document  
Patient exposure 
The median observation period was about 3.1 years for each treatment group. The total observation time 
per treatment group was at least 6794 years (Table 17). The total exposure to treatment per group was at 
least 5747 years (Table 18).

Adverse events 
The incidence rates for any AE and for SAEs (and fatal SAEs) were lower for patients treated with 
empagliflozin than placebo. The incidence rates for drug-related AEs as defined by the investigator were 
higher for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. For other categories of AEs, including those 
leading to discontinuation of study medication, there was no marked imbalance between the 3 treatment 
groups (Table 19 below).

Most frequently reported Adverse Events 
Of the most frequently reported AEs at PT level, similar rates across the 3 treatment arms were reported for 
urinary tract infection and hypoglycaemia. Lower incidence rates for hyperglycaemia were reported for 
patients treated with empagliflozin (10 mg: 3.86/100 patient-years; 25 mg: 3.55/100 pt-yrs) compared 
with placebo (8.51/100 pt-yrs). Of the less frequently reported AEs, imbalances in incidence rates between 
empagliflozin and placebo groups were observed for PTs associated with genital infections, or with other AEs 
known to occur with empagliflozin (such as dysuria, pollakisuria, and polyuria). The rate for PT thirst was 
higher in the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 0.12/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 0.32/100 pt-yrs) than placebo 
(0.09/100 pt-yrs). Urinary tract infections were reported slightly more frequently in the placebo group, but 
lead to discontinuation more among empagliflozin users (Table 20). 
The most frequently reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation at the PT level were myocardial 
infarction and acute myocardial infarction, with similar rates in all treatment groups.  
The overall incidence rates of AEs assessed as drug-related by the investigators were higher for both 
empagliflozin groups than the placebo group. This was largely due to higher incidence rates for AEs in the 
SOCs reproductive system and breast disorders, renal and urinary disorders, and investigations. At the PT 
level, slight imbalances in incidence rates between the empagliflozin and placebo groups followed the 
differences in the SOCs, with higher incidence rates for the empagliflozin groups compared with placebo 
observed, for example, for balanoposthitis, vulvovaginal pruritus, genital pruritus, decreased weight, 
pollakisuria, and polyuria. 
The most frequently reported AEs with severe intensity were in the SOCs cardiac disorders and infections 
and infestations. The frequency of severe cardiac disorders was slightly lower for patients treated with 
empagliflozin (10 mg: 6.9%; 25 mg: 7.3%) than placebo (9.4%). The frequencies of severe events at the PT 
level within the SOC cardiac disorders were generally slightly lower for the empagliflozin groups than for 
placebo. For infections and infestations, the most frequently reported PT, pneumonia, was reported at a 
slightly lower frequency for patients in the empagliflozin groups than placebo. With regard to severe nervous 
system disorders, the frequency of ischaemic stroke was slightly lower for the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 
0.4%; 25 mg: 0.2%) than placebo (0.6%) while the frequency of cerebrovascular accident was slightly 
higher for the empagliflozin groups (10 mg: 0.8%; 25 mg: 0.9%) than placebo (0.5%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The overall incidence rates for fatal AEs were lower for patients treated with empagliflozin than for patients 
treated with placebo (Table 19). At the PT level, the most frequently reported fatal AEs were myocardial 
infarction and cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure were less 
frequently reported for patients treated with empagliflozin than placebo. Incidence rates for the other most 
frequently reported PTs (≥0.2% in any group) were generally similar between the empagliflozin and placebo 
treatment groups or slightly lower for empagliflozin than placebo. As for most of the AE analyses in this trial, 
the fatal AE analyses were based on a follow-up period of 7 days after treatment stop, and therefore the 
numbers of patients with fatal AEs differ from the numbers for all-cause mortality (for which the follow-up 
was until individual trial end). Nonetheless, the reduction in deaths in the empagliflozin groups is seen in 
both analyses.

The incidence rates of SAEs (which included fatal and non-fatal SAEs) were slightly lower for patients treated 
with empagliflozin than for patients treated with placebo (Table 19), largely due to lower incidence rates of 
serious cardiac disorders in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. At the PT level, a number of 
SAEs had slightly lower incidence rates for patients on empagliflozin than on placebo (angina unstable, 
cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, cardiac failure congestive, myocardial ischaemia, bradycardia, 
cardiac arrest, pneumonia). Other PTs had slightly higher incidence rates for patients on empagliflozin than 
for patients on placebo (urosepsis, cerebrovascular accident). 
The overall incidence rates for SAEs that were immediately life-threatening were slightly higher in the 
empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group, largely due to the higher incidence rates of cardiac disorders 
that were immediately life-threatening (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.47/100 pt-yrs; empagliflozin 25 mg: 
0.57/100 pt-yrs; placebo: 0.40/100 pt-yrs). However, the incidence rates for combined fatal or 
immediately-life-threatening SAEs, overall and for the SOC cardiac disorders, were lower for both 
empagliflozin groups (overall 10 mg: 2.35/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 2.21/100 pt-yrs) than for the placebo group 
(2.68/100 pt-yrs). 
Adverse Events of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (serious or non-serious) was an AE of scientific, medical, or regulatory 
concern. A total of 11 categories of adverse events of special interest were analysed in this trial (Table 20). 
The incidence rates of genital infections were higher in the empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg groups than in 
the placebo group. Although non-serious urinary tract infections were similar among all groups, serious or 
complicated UTIs occurred more with the 25 mg dose, but not with the 10 mg dose. 
Although the incidence rate of hepatic injury was slightly lower in both empagliflozin groups than the placebo 
group, there were slightly more serious cases. 
Five patients in total were reported with diabetic ketoacidosis (placebo: 1, empa 10mg: 3, 
empa 25mg: 1). The frequencies of confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events were comparable in all 
groups, including frequencies for events where the patient required assistance.  
Bone fractures occurred more frequently in the placebo group compared to the empagliflozin groups. 
The overall frequencies and incidence rates for malignancy up to trial termination were somewhat higher for 
the empagliflozin-treated groups; the same was true for patients with malignancy with an onset after 6 
months of exposure to study medication (Table 20). 
Laboratory findings 
There were increases in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol in all 
treatment groups from baseline to Week 28. Thereafter, values continued to increase slightly until Week 80. 
The increase was greater in the empagliflozin 25 mg group than in the empagliflozin 10 mg group, and 
increases were greater in both empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. There were also increases in 
Haemotocrit in the Empa groups versus placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
AEs in patients with CKD 3A/B were similar between treatment groups although higher than in ‘all patients’. 
For most SOCs, events for placebo were numerically higher (Table 21). 
The incidence of AEs and SAEs increases with age, but similarly in placebo and empagliflozin-treated groups. 
No new risks are identified for elderly patients who use empagliflozin (Table 22).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in trial 1245.25 is consistent with the known safety profile of 
empagliflozin. Only thirst is proposed by the MAH as a new side effect after their assessment of all available 
clinical data and in light of the new data from trial 1245.25. Thirst was not included in the definition of 
volume depletion as used by the MAH and therefore evaluated separately. In the pooling of all 
placebo-controlled trials with a treatment duration of 18 to 24 weeks (not including 1245.25), which was 
designated for side-effects labelling, the PT thirst was reported for 1.3% of the patients in either 
empagliflozin group (10 mg or 25 mg), while not reported in the placebo group. These data are consistent 
with the results from the largest safety pooling supporting the initial marketing application and from trial 
1245.25 (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.8%; placebo: 0.2%). The addition of thirst is therefore 
agreed. Besides, elderly patients, who are often exposed to multi drug treatments, including diuretics and 
ACE-inhibitors are vulnerable for volume depletion. Therefore, a special warning should be added in section 
4.4 of the SmPC  
The new data about AEs that were collected are in line with previous knowledge about empagliflozin as 
documented in the SmPC. This also applies to the AEs of special interest. Although this was a large trial, the 
numbers of rare events are still too low to draw definite conclusions. Of note: 
  Hepatic events were carefully assessed by a blinded committee. Although infrequent, serious hepatic 
injury and/or patients with ALT/AST ≥5x ULN were higher for patients in the empagliflozin groups 
(increased AST/ALT: 10 mg: 0.7%; 25 mg: 0.6%) than placebo (0.3%). No definite cases of DILI were 
identified as according to the committee confounding factors were present. 
 
In total, 7 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients (0.5%) in the empagliflozin 
25 mg group had PT urosepsis or sepsis possibly originated from the urinary tract, compared with 5 
patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. However, the overall incidence rate of (complicated) UTIs was 
similar in the empagliflozin groups and the placebo group. The text regarding UTI in Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC is still acceptable. 
 
The frequency of confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events was similar in all treatment groups within 
each subgroup (e.g. by age, renal impairment, use of insulin at baseline), except for the subgroup with 
SU at baseline. It is somewhat surprising that concomitant use of SUs is associated with less 
hypoglycaemias (with SU: 24.5% for empagliflozin 10 mg, 25.0% for empagliflozin 25 mg, 23.4% for 
placebo; without SU: 30.5 % for empagliflozin 10 mg, 29.7 % for empagliflozin 25 mg, 31.2 % for 
placebo).  
  Use of loop diuretics was associated with a higher risk of volume depletion in the empagliflozin groups 
(10 mg: 4.92/100 pt-yrs; 25 mg: 4.45/100 pt-yrs) than in the placebo group (3.69/100 pt-yrs). This 
association is already mentioned in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
 
There was no clear increase in the incidence of keto-acidosis. 
  Malignancies occurred more frequently with empagliflozin treatment (4.3%) compared to placebo 
treatment (3.3%), also when taking into account only cases after at least 6 months of exposure. 
However, no specific group of malignancies seems to explain this and after detailed classification the 
groups become very small. 
The MAH summarised AE data for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency and for older patients. Although 
in these groups the overall rate of AEs is higher than in the overall population, the AE profile is comparable 
to the total population.

The following additional laboratory value changes should be added to the Jardiance SmPC because these 
safety issues are now confirmed in empa-reg and other trials with FDC: 
 
 
Increase in haematocrit should be added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Increase in serum lipids should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The established safety profile, as described in the SmPC is confirmed. Thirst can be added as a common 
adverse reaction. The SmPC should be extended with information on the increase in haematocrit (section 4.4 
and section 4.8) and serum lipids (section 4.8). 
The safety profile in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency who use empagliflozin is comparable to 
placebo, although the AE rates are higher than in subjects with normal renal function. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP):

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Jardiance is currently indicated to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. In this type 2 variation, and 
based on the results of the EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial, the MAH initially sought an additional 
indication for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and established 
cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of 
 
 
all-cause mortality by reducing cardiovascular death and 
cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure (see section 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/11728/2017 
Page 54/62 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Also, the MAH sought to expand recommended use in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency 
(eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1.73m2).  
During the CHMP assessment, the MAH limited the claim for additional indication to patients with type 2 
diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death.  
Also during the assessment, use in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency was sought for the claim with 
regard to reduction of cardiovascular death only, but not for the glycaemic control part of the proposed 
indication. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial included 7028 diabetic patients with established cardiovascular 
disease (high cardiovascular risk defined as at least one of the following risk factors: myocardial infarction or 
CVA within 2 months before inclusion, coronary heart disease, instable angina pectoris, peripheral arterial 
disease) who were randomised between placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg OD and empagliflozin 25 mg OD. 
Patients were followed up for a median of 3.1 years. The trial was stopped according to plan after 691 events 
had been observed. 
The primary endpoint (3-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death (including fatal stroke 
and fatal MI), non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The primary analysis [based on the 
treated set population] showed superiority of “all empagliflozin” treatment to placebo. Patients with events 
were 282/2333 (12.1%) for placebo and 490/4687 (10.5%) for all empagliflozin treated patients. The HR 
was 0.86 (95.02% CI: 0.74, 0.99; p (2-sided) = 0.0382). The results were similar (although not statistically 
significant) in exploratory analyses for both empagliflozin doses (patients with events 10 mg: 243/2345 
(10.4%), 25mg: 247/2342 (10.5%)).  
The exploratory breakdown of the first event for 3-point MACE indicated that the lower frequency of 3-point 
MACE for empagliflozin was primarily driven by a lower frequency of CV death (placebo: 107 (4.6%), all 
empa: 143 (3.1%); HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77). The most prevalent categorisation of the CV deaths was 
“other CV death”, including fatal events deemed not assessable by the CEC (129 of 309 patients with CV 
death), followed by sudden deaths (91) and worsening of heart failure (30). For all myocardial 
infarction-related endpoints, no significant difference was observed between empagliflozin and placebo, 
although the point estimate favoured empagliflozin (non-fatal MI, HR: 0.87; 95% CI 0.70, 1.09). Silent MI 
was not part of the primary endpoint, but the outcome favoured placebo (HR 1.28; 95% CI 0.70, 2.33). 
However, the hazard ratio point estimate for stroke was above 1 (non-fatal stroke; HR 1.24; 95% CI 0.92, 
1.67; not statistically significant). In Europe, the HR for stroke was statistically significant (HR 2.04, CI: 
1.26, 3.29). 
The key secondary endpoint (4-point MACE) was the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, 
non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris. Empagliflozin (doses pooled) was 
non-inferior, but not superior, to placebo based on this endpoint (HR 0.89 (95.02% CI 0.78, 1.01); 
p = 0.0795). The results for 10 and 25 mg were similar. 
The risk of CV death and all-cause mortality was significantly reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and 
the individual dose groups compared with the placebo group (all-cause mortality: placebo: 194 (8.3%), 
empa: 269 (5.7%)). There were no obvious differences between the two empagliflozin dose groups. The 
majority of all deaths were CV deaths, and non-CV death was numerically reduced in the empagliflozin 
Assessment report

groups compared with the placebo group. The result was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis assuming all 
empagliflozin-treated-patients lost to follow up had died. 
The efficacy data for both dose levels tested were highly comparable for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. There were slight advantages for the higher dose in parameters like HbA1c, FPG, blood pressure 
and weight.  
Results in this trial confirmed previous data for glycaemic control in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment.  
Additional data were obtained with regard to pharmacokinetic through levels reflecting on exposure. These 
data confirm the PK information in the current SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Heart failure related endpoints were exploratory by design in this trial. For all heart failure endpoints, the 
risk was reduced in the “all empagliflozin” group and the individual dose groups compared with the placebo 
group (Patients with events of hospitalisation for heart failure: Placebo 4.1%, All empa 2.7%; HR: 0.65, 
95% CI: 0.50, 0.85). 
The exploratory composite nephropathy endpoint “new or worsening nephropathy” was reduced for both 
empa doses (HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.70). This was primarily driven by “new onset of macro-albuminuria”. 
However, no obvious difference between empagliflozin and placebo was observed for new onset of 
albuminuria.  
For patients with microalbuminuria (UACR 30 to 300 mg/g) or macro-albuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g) at 
baseline, more patients showed sustained reversal of their proteinuria after treatment with empagliflozin 
than with placebo. There were no obvious differences between the 2 empagliflozin dose groups. These 
results were maintained in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency. 
When mean eGFR values were analysed over time, there was a steady decrease in eGFR in the placebo 
group, indicative of natural disease progression. In contrast, the initial decreases in eGFR in the 
empagliflozin groups were reversible over time, with eGFR values higher in the empagliflozin groups than in 
the placebo group after about a year. About 30 days after the stop of treatment, eGFR increased from the 
last value on treatment by about 3.5 ml/min/1.73m2 in the empagliflozin groups, while no change was seen 
in the placebo group.  
Although most subgroups with regard to the primary endpoint were consistent with the main analysis, there 
were some exceptions. In the analysis of Black or African American patients, the HR for MACE-3 favoured 
placebo (HR: 1.48). The results in users of thiazolidinediones and also DPP4-inhibitors showed trends in the 
wrong direction (HR 1.13 and 1.27). In these same subgroups, the HRs for CV mortality were 0.77, 0.60 and 
1.23 respectively. In Black or African American patients, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.25. 
The benefits in Europe and also North America were smaller than in Latin America and Asia. The HR for 
MACE-3 in Europe (41.1% of the patients) was 0.97 for the 10 mg dose and 1.07 for the 25 mg dose, for 
North America (19.9% of the patients) this was 0.78 and 1.01 respectively.  
The results for MACE-3 in subjects with normal renal function (eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) were also slightly 
less favourable than the results in subjects with impaired renal function. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG trial was consistent with the known safety profile of 
empagliflozin. The overall incidence of adverse events in patients treated with empagliflozin was similar to 
placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was hypoglycaemia when empagliflozin was used

with sulphonylurea or insulin. Increased urination and volume depletion are directly related to the mode of 
action. There was no clear increase in the occurrence of keto-acidosis (placebo: 1, empa 10 mg: 3, 
empa 25mg: 1). In EMPA-REG, thirst occurred more frequently with empagliflozin than with placebo 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.3%; 25 mg: 0.8%; placebo: 0.2%). This ADR is not completely covered by the 
potentially related entity of ‘volume depletion’, and has thus been added to SmPC section 4.8. 
The MAH summarised AE data for subjects with moderate renal insufficiency and for older patients. Although 
in these groups the overall rate of AEs is higher than in the overall population, the AE profile is comparable 
to the total population. EMPA-REG confirmed increases in haematocrit and serum lipids. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
For some rare AEs of special interest, the numbers of events were low despite the size of the trial. Of note: 
  Serious hepatic injury and/or patients with ALT/AST ≥5x ULN were higher for patients in the 
empagliflozin groups (increased AST/ALT: 10 mg: 0.7%; 25 mg: 0.6%) than placebo (0.3%). No 
definite cases of DILI were identified as according to the hepatic events committee confounding factors 
were present. 
 
In total, 7 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 12 patients (0.5%) in the empagliflozin 
25 mg group had PT urosepsis or sepsis possibly originated from the urinary tract, compared with 5 
patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. The overall incidence rate of (complicated) UTIs was similar in the 
empagliflozin groups and the placebo group.  
  Malignancies occurred more frequently with empagliflozin treatment (4.3%) compared to placebo 
treatment (3.3%), also when taking into account only cases after at least 6 months of exposure. 
However, no specific group of malignancies seems to explain this and after detailed classification the 
groups become very small.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The EMPA-REG trial is a large, well-designed and well-conducted cardiovascular outcome trial. There are no 
major concerns related to group differences in baseline characteristics. The trial demonstrated superiority 
(p=0.04) of empagliflozin over placebo on the primary endpoint of MACE-3. When analysed by the individual 
components, this result is driven primarily by a benefit in CV death, starting to be significant as early as 
day 59. The components non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke showed statistically 
non-significant, heterogeneous differences, with a positive trend for non-fatal MI and a negative trend for 
stroke. The reduction in CV mortality appears largely independent of HbA1c and change from baseline in 
HbA1c, being even observed in subjects with baseline HbA1c < 7, and with similar results obtained for 
subjects with a reduction in HbA1c <0.3% or even an increase as compared to subjects with a 
decrease >0.3%. This separation of glucose lowering effect and reduction in CV mortality was confirmed by 
additional analyses and may suggest a different mode of action. 
All-cause mortality in these patients is mainly attributable to CV causes, but also non-CV causes favoured 
empagliflozin (although not statistically significant). This positive effect of antidiabetics on macrovascular 
complications had previously only been demonstrated for metformin (UKPDS 34 study). This was the first 
time since 1998 that efficacy of an antidiabetic drug was demonstrated in decreasing cardiovascular events 
in a large clinical trial. The effect size for the reduction in the risk of death expressed as the number needed 
to treat (NNT) was 39 to prevent 1 death in 3.1 years and is considered clinically relevant. Results are 
considered reliable as follow-up information for vital status was almost complete (>99%, only 53 patients 
missing) and the parameter is free from bias. 
This type 2 variation is based on the results of a single, but large pivotal clinical trial. The primary and key 
secondary endpoints were assessed for non-inferiority and superiority. These tests were defined in a 
hierarchical testing procedure. All other outcomes of the trial are considered exploratory, but show 
supportive results. This applies in particular to the heart failure and nephropathy related outcomes where 
significant and potentially clinically relevant results were observed. 
The results for stroke remain unexplained. This result was significant in the European population, leading to 
a neutral HR for the primary endpoint of MACE-3 in Europe (see Figure 17). However, trends were different 
for North and South America, and overall the HR was non-significant. With regards to the overall trial 
population, the MAH has provided data to show that part of the effect on stroke can be attributed to 
off-treatment events occurring late in the trial. There was no evidence of an association between stroke and 
volume depletion adverse events that occurred prior to a stroke nor with haemo-concentration. A similar 
trend is not seen for transient cerebral ischaemia (TIA). Also, no relevant difference in baseline 
characteristics was identified that could be related to such regional differences. 
Many subjects were included in the study with an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73m2. The results are 
largely in line with the overall trial population. The established mode of action, related to glycaemic control, 
does seem not to confer the mortality benefits. In this group of patients, the CV prevention effect has been 
shown, but the effect on glycaemic control is limited. 
The safety profile confirms prior knowledge, no unexpected adverse effects occurred. As usual for this class 
of products, genital infections were more frequent among empagliflozin users. Urinary tract infections were 
balanced between groups. Bone fractures were not more frequent in empagliflozin treated patients. 
Ketoacidosis occurred in only 5 cases with only a numerical increase in the 10 mg group (3 vs. 1 in the other 
groups). Malignancies occurred slightly more frequently in the empagliflozin-treated groups, but no specific 
malignancy was noticeable after classification, the numbers were too small.

Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit in terms of reduction in cardiovascular deaths by treating DM patients with a history of a 
cardiovascular event with empagliflozin is considered clinically relevant and outweighs the risks. The small 
increase in non-ischemic stroke remains an uncertainty, but could be due to chance. The question is whether 
the over-all improved CV outcome justifies a new indication. This will be discussed further below. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Results of EMPA-REG indicate that the subgroup of T2DM patients with established CV disease may benefit 
in terms of cardiovascular outcome. The issue discussed as part of this CHMP assessment was whether these 
patients and their goals of treatment should be mentioned in section 4.1. 
The indication proposed by the MAH was defining two T2DM populations, one large (T2DM) and one more 
restricted (patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease), aiming at two different goals of 
treatment (glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular death). Important in this regard is the view 
that the cardiovascular benefit appears to be not only explained by the glucose lowering effect of 
empagliflozin. The MAH supported this by arguments such as the time course of the effect observed with an 
early benefit, the independence of the size of the glucose lowering effects and the beneficial effects in 
patients with an eGFR between 30 and 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 where the glucose lowering effects are marginal. 
It is therefore unlikely that the effect is only based on an effect on atherosclerosis, glycaemia control or 
blood pressure. However, the exact mechanism of action remains speculative. Renal effects may play a role 
but further studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanism(s) and to confirm these beneficial 
effects. 
Apart from the mechanism of action, the MAH gave other arguments to separate glycaemic control and the 
reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the indication. Mentioning results only in section 5.1 would not be 
clear for the prescriber for whom sections 4.1 and 4.2 are more important. The posology proposed is 
different, as the 25 mg dose has no additional advantages (compared to the 10 mg dose) for CV prevention. 
In modern CV outcome trials investigating three different DPP-4 inhibitors and two GLP-1 analogues, modest 
differences in glucose control did not translate to improved CV outcomes, with the exception of the LEADER 
trial with liraglutide that was recently published (N Engl J Med 2016; 375:311-322). Finally, there are also 
precedents with other risk reducing therapies, such as the statins and ACE-inhibitors where a distinction in 
goals of treatment has been made in the indication between the metabolic/haemodynamic endpoint and the 
clinical outcome. 
An oral explanation was held by the applicant presenting the rationale for their proposed indication 
(discussed above). The CHMP concluded that while EMPA REG is a positive cardiovascular outcome trial, 
treatment of T2DM may cover treatment and/or prevention of many co-morbidities. CHMP is of the view that 
in the indication section of the SmPC the patient population eligible for treatment with empagliflozin should 
be mentioned, i.e. patients with T2DM, without mentioning any goal of treatment, i.e. neither improvement 
of glycaemic control, nor reduction of the risk of cardiovascular death. This means that the wording of the 
indication will refer to the patient population for whom treatment with empagliflozin is intended, i.e. patients 
with T2DM, and the information on the EMPA-REG study including the heterogeneity of the MACE-3 
endpoint, will be included in section 5.1. The rationale for CHMPs decision is that the improvement in glucose 
control and reduction of cardiovascular events are the main goals of treatment for T2DM and should not be 
separated. These have now been demonstrated in the EMPA-REG trial for patients with established CV 
disease and may also apply to other T2DM patients.

In line with the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics with regard to wording of the indication(s), 
the CHMP was of the view that the population studied in the EMPA-REG i.e. T2DM patients with established 
CV disease, is a sub-population of the already approved T2DM population for Jardiance and that the 
demonstrated effect of reduction of CV mortality is covered by the general indication “treatment of type 2 
diabetes”; similarly, achievement of glycemic control is covered. Thus, the effect on CV mortality does not 
constitute a separate (prevention) indication. Therefore CHMP did not grant a separate CV prevention 
indication but deleted the endpoint “glycaemic control” from section 4.1 to clarify that the treatment goal for 
empagliflozin is not limited to glycaemic control. The results of the EMPA-REG are reflected in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Furthermore, in the case of the current empagliflozin application based on a single pivotal trial some further 
considerations were: 1) EMPA-REG was primarily a safety study and the primary endpoint resulted in a p for 
superiority of only 0.04, 2) patients with established cardiovascular disease are only a subgroup of the total 
(T2DM) population with overlap between the two indications claimed, 3) the effect on the MACE-3 endpoint 
was inconsistent with an increase in stroke, and 4) the pharmacological principle is new and the mode of 
action for the latter effect has not been established. 
CHMP also reflected whether to delete the restriction of the indication to patients for whom use of metformin 
is considered inappropriate and to grant a broad indication of monotherapy and combination therapy in 
patients with T2DM. The main reason for this restriction has been that only metformin had demonstrated a 
CV benefit in T2DM, but now this also applies to empagliflozin where 20% of the patients in the EMPA-REG 
study did not receive metformin and showed an even higher benefit. CHMP finally decided that it is too early 
for this decision, especially as the safety profile of empagliflozin is not completely mature yet. 
A final issue discussed was the inclusion (as proposed by the applicant) of patients with eGFR below 
45 ml/min/1.73m2. In these patients, no clinically relevant effect on glycaemic control has been shown but 
CV events may be prevented. This extension was not granted, as the CHMP considered glycaemic efficacy is 
essential for any diabetes product. Therefore, the posology in patients with renal impairment remained 
unchanged. 
The final wording for the modified indication in SmPC section 4.1 as agreed by the CHMP is as follows (new 
text shown in bold; removed text as strikethrough):  
“Jardiance is indicated for in the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes 
mellitus to improve glycaemic control in adults as : 
Monotherapy 
When an adjunct to diet and exercise 
•   as monotherapy when alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of 
metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance 
Add-on combination therapy 
•   In combination with in addition to other glucose-lowering medicinal products for the treatment of 
diabetes including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control 
(For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different 
combinations).”

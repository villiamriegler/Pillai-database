1.  Introduction 
On 27th  September 2023, the MAH submitted two completed paediatric studies for RXULTI 
(brexpiprazole), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation 
measure. Short critical expert overviews have also been provided. 
Rxulti tablets was approved in EU in 2018 and is currently indicated for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the two clinical Trials, 331-201-00148 and 331-201-00191 are part of a 
commitment with the US FDA, under a Paediatric Written Request, and were conducted beyond 
the studies included in the EU PIP. This combined Article 46 submission of two study reports 
within 6- month post-last patient last visit (LPLV) of Trial 331-201-00191 was agreed with the 
Agency on 21 December 2022. 
The two studies were conducted in children and adolescents with irritability associated with 
autism spectrum disorder (iASD) to assess the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole treatment. No 
regulatory consequences were identified by the MAH. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studyies 
The following marketed dosage formulations of brexpiprazole were used in Trial 331-201-00148 
and Trial 331-201-00191: 0.25-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3-mg tablets for oral use. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted final reports for:

Description 
Trial 331-201-00148 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
8- week trial, designed to evaluate the effects of flexibly-dosed brexpiprazole 0.25 to 3 mg/day, 
compared with placebo on irritability in children and adolescent subjects, ages 5 to 17 years, 
with a diagnosis of ASD according to DSM-5. 
Methods 
The trial consisted of a 1 to 28 day screening period, followed by an 8 week double-blind 
treatment period, and a 21-day post-treatment safety follow-up period. The trial was conducted 
on an outpatient basis. 
Subjects who continued to meet entrance criteria at the baseline visit (Day 1) were randomized 
1:1 to receive brexpiprazole or placebo daily. On Day 1 of the treatment period, subjects began 
titration to a target minimum dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP). The target dose 
range of IMP was determined for each individual subject based on body weight. 
During the double-blind treatment phase, evaluations were planned on Day 1 (baseline) and at 
Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a protocol addendum was added 
stating that screening and baseline visits were required to be in office and all other visits could 
be virtual visits. 
Where the investigator and caregiver made the decision to conduct a visit virtually, the visit was 
conducted by means of telecommunications technology. The caregiver and subject remained in 
their own home and completed trial assessments and questionnaires via an online technology. 
The caregiver and subject interacted with trial personnel using online communication tools which 
incorporated telemedicine. During virtual interactions (and at any other time), the trial personnel 
were able to assess the subject and determine if an additional in-office visit for a physical 
evaluation was required  at the discretion of the investigator. 
A schematic of this trial design is provided in figure below. 
Study participants 
A total of 260 subjects were screened for this trial and 119 subjects were randomized to double-

blind IMP. The Safety Sample comprised of 115 subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP. 
One subject (in the placebo group) was included in the Safety Sample but not the Efficacy 
Sample (the subject’s baseline ABC assessment occurred 3 days after the date of their first IMP 
dose and was not considered a valid baseline efficacy assessment). 
Subjects had to meet the following key inclusion criteria at both baseline and screening: 
• Male and female subjects 5 to 17 years of age, with a current primary DSM-5 diagnosis of 
ASD, as determined by the investigator and supported by the Autism Diagnostic Interview - 
Revised (ADI-R). 
• Subjects with an ABC-I subscale score ≥ 18 and with a CGI-S scale score ≥ 4 pertaining to 
irritability at screening and at baseline (Day 1). 
• Subjects must have had a mental age of ≥ 2 years, as determined by the investigator 
based on school participation, social history, or medical records. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were allocated in a 1:1 ratio at randomization to one of the following two 
treatment groups: 
• 
• 
Flexibly-dosed brexpiprazole (0.25- 3 mg/day, weight based) 
Placebo 
All doses of brexpiprazole and matching placebo were taken orally once daily, preferably in the 
morning, and were administered without regard to meals. 
The target dose range of IMP was determined for each individual subject based on body weight. 
Subjects with body weight < 50 kg received a target dose range of 1 to 1.5 mg, and subjects 
with body weight ≥ 50 kg received a target dose range of 1.5 to 3 mg. Body weight at the time 
of randomization determined dose/titration requirements throughout the trial. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
brexpiprazole in reducing irritability in children and adolescents ages 5 to 17 years with a 
diagnosis of ASD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was the mean change from baseline to Week 8 in the 
Aberrant Behavior checklist Irritability (ABC-I) subscale score. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The key secondary endpoint of this trial was the mean change from baseline to Week 8 in 
Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI-S) score for irritability. 
Safety Endpoints 
Safety was assessed by the following standard endpoints for clinical trials and trials of

antipsychotic drugs: 
• Frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (clinical and 
laboratory), and discontinuation from the trial due to AEs 
• Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference 
• Clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) 
• Vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters 
• Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) scale scores: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) 
• Potential suicide events recorded on suicidality scale scores (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale [C-SSRS]) 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included: 
Sample size 
Determination of Sample Size: Approximately 102 subjects were estimated to be randomized 
(51 per treatment arm). A sample size of 51 subjects per arm provided at least 85% power at a 
nominal 2- sided alpha level of 0.05 to detect a 6.0-point reduction in change from baseline in 
ABC-I subscale score for brexpiprazole versus placebo, assuming a standard deviation (SD) = 
10. 
Subject Samples: The following analysis samples were defined for this trial: 
• Randomized Sample: All subjects who were randomized into the trial. Subjects were 
considered randomized when they were assigned a treatment number by interactive research 
technology (IRT) at the end of the screening period. Subjects receiving trial treatment outside 
of the IRT were not considered randomized, but such subjects were included into the Safety 
Sample as defined below. 
• Safety Sample: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP. Subjects were excluded from 
this population only if there was documented evidence (ie, drug dispensed = drug returned or no 
trial drug dispensed) that the subjects did not take IMP. If a subject was dispensed trial 
medication and was lost to follow up, he/she was considered exposed to IMP. Of note, a subject 
was deemed enrolled into the trial if the Informed Consent Form / Informed Assent Form had 
been obtained from the subject or his/her legally acceptable representative. 
• Efficacy Sample: Comprised all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of the IMP, and 
had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy variable ABC-I 
subscale score during the double-blind treatment phase

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Treatment assignments were obtained by accessing eSource. Based on computer generated 
randomization, eligible subjects were allocated in a 1:1 ratio at randomization to 1 of the 
following 2 treatment groups: 
• Flexibly-dosed brexpiprazole (0.25 - 3 mg/day, weight based) 
• Placebo 
Neither the investigator nor the subject was aware of the treatment assignment. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 8 in the ABC-I 
subscale score. The primary statistical comparison of interest was the difference between 
brexpiprazole and placebo at Week 8, analyzed using a mixed-model repeated measures 
(MMRM) analysis with an unstructured variance covariance matrix for within subject variation. 
The model will include fixed-class effect terms of treatment, trial center, visit week, and an 
interaction term of treatment by visit week, and includes the interaction term of baseline values 
of ABC-I subscale score by visit week as a covariate. 
The primary comparison between brexpiprazole and the placebo arm at Week 8 was estimated as the 
difference between least squares means. 
To ensure that trial was adequately powered, the estimate of the trial variability was obtained in 
a blinded fashion upon approximately 75% of the subjects having completed or discontinued 
from the trial. The variability was estimated based on a blinded and pooled analysis of all 
treatment arms and sample size could be further increased. 
Safety: The incidence of AEs and the incidence of abnormal findings in vital signs, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory tests, safety scales, and physical examinations were analyzed. 
Results 
Baseline data and Number analysed 
A total of 260 subjects were screened for this trial and 119 subjects were randomized to double-
blind IMP. The Safety Sample comprised of 115 subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP. 
One subject (in the placebo group) was included in the Safety Sample but not the Efficacy 
Sample (the subject’s baseline ABC assessment occurred 3 days after the date of their first IMP 
dose and was not considered a valid baseline efficacy assessment). 
In the Randomized Sample (N = 119), 15 subjects (12.6%) discontinued during the 
trial. The subject disposition is reported in table 10.1-1.

aPercentages were based on the number of randomized subjects. 
bRandomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication were included in the safetyanalysis. 
cRandomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had a baseline and one post-baseline ABC-I 
subscale score. 
The mean (SD) age at baseline was 9.9 (3.0) years and 96 subjects were in to 5- to 12-year-
old age group versus 23 subjects in the 13- to 17-year-old age group. The mean (SD) weight at 
baseline was 
43.6 (21.8) kg and 84 subjects were in the < 50 kg weight group versus 35 subjects in the ≥ 50 kg 
weight group. There was a lower proportion of female subjects (12.6%) than male subjects 
(87.4%) randomized in this trial. The proportion of black or African American subjects was 
10.9% and of Hispanic or Latino subjects was 12.6% in this trial. Demographics and baseline 
characteristics were similar for most parameters between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups. 
The baseline mean (SD) for ABC-I subscale score was 29.1 (7.8) and for CGI-S score was 4.8 
(0.7). The baseline mean ABC-I subscale and CGI-S scores were similar between the 
brexpiprazole and placebo groups. 
Efficacy results 
Treatment with brexpiprazole did not demonstrate efficacy relative to placebo in reducing irritability in 
children and adolescents ages 5 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ASD. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline to Week 8 in ABC-I subscale score 
did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement for the treatment with brexpiprazole 
compared to placebo with a treatment difference -1.22 (95% CI -4.49, 2.05), p = 0.4597, 
MMRM). A numerical reduction from baseline to Week 8 in mean ABC-I subscale score was seen 
in both the brexpiprazole (least squares [LS] mean standard error [SE] = −10.1 [1.28]) and 
placebo (LS mean [SE] = −8.87 [1.25]) groups. 
A summary of efficacy results at week 8 is reported in table 11.4.1.1.1-1 
According to the prespecified hierarchical testing sequence, since the statistical test for the 
primary efficacy endpoint did not reach statistical significance, further formal statistical testing 
did not proceed for the key secondary endpoint, mean change from baseline to Week 8 in CGI-S 
score. A numerical reduction from baseline to Week 8 in mean CGI-S score was seen in both the 
brexpiprazole (LS mean [SE] = −1.16 [0.15]) and placebo (LS mean [SE] = −1.09 [0.15]) 
groups with a nominal p = 0.7315, MMRM (please refer to table below), showing that treatment 
with brexpiprazole did not demonstrate improvement compared to placebo.

Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
-  Change From Baseline in Other Aberrant Behavior Checklist Subscale Scores 
Numerical reductions from baseline to Week 8 in the ABC-I subscale scores for social withdrawal, s 
tereotypic behavior, hyperactivity or noncompliance, and inappropriate speech were seen in both the 
brexpiprazole and placebo groups. 
-  Response Rate 
Response was defined as having ≥ 25% improvement (reduction) in ABC-I subscale score and ≥ 
1 point improvement (reduction) in CGI-S score compared to baseline. There was no appreciable 
difference between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups in response rate at Week 8 or any of 
the study visits (LOCF [last observation carried forward] analysis). Responders were seen in 
both brexpiprazole and placebo groups. 
-  Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
There was no appreciable difference between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups for mean 
change from baseline to Week 8 in PedsQL generic core scale score. There was a numerically 
greater LS mean (SE) change from baseline to Week 8. in PedsQL generic core scale score for 
the brexpiprazole group (14.13 [2.50]) compared to the placebo group (8.91 [2.37]; LS mean 
difference = 5.22 [95% CI: 
−0.66, 11.11], p = 0.0808). Nominally greater LS mean (SE) change from baseline to Week 8 
for brexpiprazole vs placebo was observed for PedsQL Emotional Function score (LS mean 
difference = 8.54 [95% CI: 1.73, 15.35], p = 0.0147; CT-5.6.4) and Social Function score (LS 
mean difference = 10.07 [95% CI: 0.85, 19.28], p = 0.0327; CT-5.6.5). 
-  Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: Family Impact 
Total Score 
There was no appreciable difference between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups for mean 
change from baseline to Week 8 in PedsQL Family Impact Module score. The baseline mean 
(SD) Family Impact Module score was 43.80 (15.67) in the brexpiprazole group, compared to 
47.55 (21.19) in the placebo group. There was a numerically greater LS mean (SE) change from 
baseline to Week 8 in PedsQL Family Impact Module score for the brexpiprazole group (14.22 
[2.58]) compared to the placebo group (9.16 [2.37]; LS mean difference = 5.06 [95% CI: 
−0.95, 11.08], p = 0.0976). 
-  Change From Baseline in Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale 
There was no appreciable difference between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups for mean 
change from baseline to Week 8 in PARS total score. The baseline mean (SD) PARS total score 
was 10.62 (5.88) in the brexpiprazole group, compared to 11.79 (5.40) in the placebo group. 
There were similar LS mean (SE) changes from baseline to Week 8 in PARS total score for the 
brexpiprazole (−2.63 [0.85]) and placebo (−2.56 [0.77]) groups (LS mean difference = −0.07 
[95% CI: −2.04, 1.91], p = 
0.9443). 
Safety results 
A summary of the safety results from the administration of brexpiprazole in children and 
adolescents (ages 5 to 17 years) with iASD in Trial 331 201-00148 were as follows: 
•  No deaths or serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in this trial.

•  A total of 30 subjects (51.7%) in the brexpiprazole group and 20 subjects (35.1%) 
in the placebo group experienced TEAEs. 
•  None of the TEAEs reported in this trial were severe. Twenty-two subjects (37.9%) in the 
brexpiprazole group and 17 subjects (29.8%) in the placebo group had TEAEs that were 
mild in severity. Fifteen subjects (25.9%) in the brexpiprazole group and 7 subjects 
(12.3%) in the placebo group had TEAEs that were moderate in severity. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred at an incidence of at least 5% in the 
brexpiprazole group and greater than the placebo group were vomiting, headache, 
and somnolence. 
Three (2.6%) subjects had TEAEs leading to discontinuation, 2 subjects in 
(3.4%) in brexpiprazole group, and 1 subject (1.8%) in placebo group. 
The incidence of subjects with potentially drug-related TEAEs was 29.3% in the 
brexpiprazole group compared with 15.8% in the placebo group. In the brexpiprazole 
group, the only potentially drug-related TEAE that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects was 
somnolence (12.1% vs 5.3% for placebo). 
In the brexpiprazole group, 1 subject (1.7%) discontinued due to the TEAE of mental 
disorder. In the placebo group, 1 subject (1.8%) discontinued due to the TEAE of 
aggression. 
•  A total of 4 subjects (6.9%) in the brexpiprazole group and 2 subjects (3.5%) in the 
placebo group experienced EPS-related TEAEs. None of the TEAEs were serious or led to 
discontinuation. No clinically significant changes from baseline were observed in SAS, 
AIMS, or BARS scores. 
•  No TEAEs related to suicidality were reported. There were no clinically meaningful 
changes from baseline based on the review of the C-SSRS data. No suicidality was 
reported during the treatment or follow-up period based on the C-SSRS. 
•  Weight related TEAEs occurred in 1 subject (1.7%) in the brexpiprazole group (weight 
increased) and 1 subject (1.8%) in the placebo group (weight decreased). None of the 
TEAEs were serious or led to discontinuation. 
•  No meaningful differences between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups were 
observed for clinical laboratory results, vital signs, or ECGs.

Title: Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label Trial to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Tolerability of 
Brexpiprazole in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Irritability Associated with 
Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
Description 
Trial 331-201-00191 was a multicenter, open-label trial conducted to evaluate the long-term 
safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole in children and adolescent subjects with irritability in ASD 
who have completed the corresponding double-blind, phase 3 efficacy trial, Trial 331-201-00148 
(8 weeks of treatment) and, in the investigator’s judgment, could potentially benefit from 
continued investigational treatment with oral brexpiprazole.

Methods 
The trial was conducted as follows: 
Screening/Baseline: Subjects who completed the treatment period of the double-blind trial and 
were deemed compliant with the protocol were screened for eligibility at the last visit of the 
double-blind trial (Week 8). A separate fully executed informed consent/assent was obtained for 
Trial 331-201- 00191 before any procedures specific to the open-label trial were performed. The 
assessments from the last visit of the double-blind trial served as the baseline measures for 
Trial 331-201-00191 for any assessment that was not unique to the open-label trial. Medical 
history was updated, if necessary. 
Open-label Treatment Phase: Eligible subjects from Trial 331-201-00148 received 26 weeks of 
daily treatment with open-label brexpiprazole in Trial 331-201-00191. Visits occurred at the end 
of Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 18, 22, and 26. The baseline, Week 2, Week 14, and Week 26 visits 
occurred in the clinic. All other visits may have been conducted either virtually or in-clinic. Where 
the investigator and caregiver made the decision to conduct a visit virtually, the visit was 
conducted by means of telecommunications technology. The caregiver and the subject were to 
remain in their own home and complete trial assessments and questionnaires via an online 
technology. The caregiver and subject interacted with trial personnel using online communication 
tools which incorporated telemedicine. 
During virtual interactions (and at any other time), the trial personnel were able to assess the 
subject and determine if an additional inoffice visit for a physical evaluation was required at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
Follow-up: Subjects had a follow-up contact 21 (± 2) days after the last dose of open-label 
brexpiprazole. 
A schematic of this trial design is provided in figure below.

A total of 95 subjects were enrolled and treated in this trial. The Safety Sample comprised 95 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP. One subject (in the prior brexpiprazole group) was 
included in the Safety Sample but not the Efficacy Sample (subject was missing an Aberrant 
Behavior checklist [ABC] score at baseline). 
The trial population included: 
• Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, could potentially benefit from administration 
of oral brexpiprazole for the treatment of irritability associated with ASD and who completed 
Trial 331-201- 00148. 
• Male and female subjects 5 to 17 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed 
consent/assent. Subjects who turned 18 years old during Trial 331-201-00148 were 
permitted in this trial. 
Treatments 
Brexpiprazole was supplied by the sponsor or designated agent in child-resistant blister cards, 
each containing sufficient tablets for 7 (+2) days. All doses of open-label brexpiprazole were 
taken orally once daily and could be administered without regard to meals. Every effort should 
have been made to administer the open-label brexpiprazole at the same time every day, 
preferably in the morning. 
The first dose of open-label brexpiprazole was taken the following day after the last dose of 
double- blind investigational medicinal product (IMP) was taken in the parent trial so that 
treatment continued without interruption. Whenever possible, it was anticipated that the last 
dose of IMP in the double- blind, phase 3 efficacy trial was taken on the day of the baseline visit 
for the open-label trial. Subjects should not have been dosed using double-blind and open-label 
IMP on the same day. 
The titration/dosing schedule was based on body weight. Body weight at the Week 8 double-
blind visit/baseline visit for Trial 331-201-00191 was used to determine the starting dose. 
Those subjects with body weight < 50 kg received a target dose range of 1 to 1.5 mg, and 
those subjects with body weight ≥ 50 kg received a target dose range of 1.5 to 3 mg. 
Brexpiprazole was supplied as 0.25-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3-mg tablets and matching placebo tablets. 
Each subject received 2 tablets every day independent of the dose levels. For low dose levels, 
one of the tablets was placebo. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole 
monotherapy in children and adolescents with irritability in ASD. 
The secondary objective was to assess the long-term efficacy of brexpiprazole monotherapy in 
children and adolescents with irritability in ASD.

2) electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, 3) clinical laboratory tests (including 
prolactin) and urinalysis, and 4) physical examination findings. 
•  Analysis of potential suicide events recorded on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C- SSRS). 
•  Changes from baseline to post-baseline time points in results from EPS scales (Simpson 
Angus Scale [SAS], Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale [AIMS], and Barnes Akathisia 
Rating Scale [BARS]). 
Percentage of subjects with clinically significant changes in weight (gain or loss) from 
baseline to specified time points. 
Time to discontinuation.

• 
Secondary Endpoint 
Efficacy: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 26 in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Irritability 
(ABC-I) subscale score. 
•  Change from baseline to Week 26 in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale 
score targeted on irritability. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
Sample size 
The sample size was not based on statistical considerations, but rather on the number of 
subjects rolling over from the parent trial (Trial 331-201-00148). The trial population was 
derived from eligible subjects who completed the parent trial. The sample size of this open-label 
trial was limited by the number of subjects enrolled into the parent trial. 
Subject Samples: 
• Enrolled Sample: Consists of subjects who completed the double-blind treatment period of the 
parent trial and who gave consent/assent for participation into this open-label trial and who also 
met all the eligibility criteria for this trial. 
• Safety Sample: Consisted of all Enrolled subjects who took at least one dose of the IMP as 
indicated on the dosing records of this open-label extension trial. A subject will be excluded from 
this population only if there is documented evidence that the subject has not taken the IMP (ie, 
number of tablets/capsules dispensed = number of tablets/capsules returned, or no IMP 
dispensed). If a subject is dispensed trial medications but subsequently lost to follow-up, the 
subject will be considered exposed to the IMP. 
• Efficacy Sample: All subjects in the Safety Sample who have a baseline assessment and at 
least one post-baseline assessment of the ABC-I subscale score. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the OC data only. The OC data refer to the actual 
observations or assessments of the outcomes that are recorded at all visits (including the ET 
visits) during the double-blind treatment phase, without imputation of any missing observations

or assessments. 
The trial naturally seeks to clarify the efficacy of brexpiprazole in improving the ABC-I subscale 
in the idealistic scenario of full adherence to the assigned treatment in all subjects, through an 
hypothetical estimand. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label trial and blinding procedures are not applicable. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: The secondary endpoints for this trial were the ABC-I subscale score and the CGI-S 
score. Each of these variables and the change from baseline to Week 26 in each of them were 
summarized on the observed case data by visit and additionally on the last observation carried 
forward data by using descriptive statistics for continuous variables. 
Safety: The incidence of AEs and the incidence of abnormal findings in vital signs, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory tests, and physical examinations were analyzed. In addition, data of extrapyramidal 
symptom (EPS) scales including SAS, AIMS, and BARS were analyzed. Potential suicide events 
recorded on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) were analyzed. Percentage of 
subjects with clinically significant changes in weight and time to discontinuation were assessed. 
Results 
Baseline data and Number analysed 
A total of 95 subjects were enrolled in this trial. All 95 (100.0%) subjects were analyzed for 
safety, and 94 (98.9%) subjects were analyzed for efficacy. One subject (in the prior 
brexpiprazole group) was included in the Safety Sample but not the Efficacy Sample (subject was 
missing an ABC score at baseline). A total of 25 subjects (26.3%) discontinued during the trial, 
including 10 (20.4%) prior brexpiprazole subjects and 15 (32.6%) prior placebo subjects. There 
were no deaths in the trial. 
Primary reasons for discontinuations included withdrawal by caregiver (11 subjects) and AE (6 
subjects). 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age at baseline was 10.0 (3.1) years and 75 subjects were ages 
5 
- 12 years versus 20 subjects were ages ≥  13 years. The mean (SD) weight at baseline was 
42.9 (18.1) kg and 65 subjects had a body weight of < 50 kg versus 30 subjects had a body 
weight of ≥ 50 kg. There was a lower proportion of female subjects (12.6%) than male subjects

(87.4%) randomized in this trial. The majority of subjects were White (75 [78.9]) and not 
Hispanic or Latino (81 [85.3%]). Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar for 
most parameters between the prior brexpiprazole and prior placebo groups. 
The baseline mean (SD) for ABC-I subscale score was 19.1 (9.9) and for CGI-S score was 3.6 
(1.1). The baseline mean ABC-I subscale and CGI-S scores were similar between the prior 
brexpiprazole and prior placebo groups, as shown in figure below. 
Safety results (primary endpoint) 
• 
The safety results from administration of brexpiprazole in children and adolescents 
with irritability associated with ASD are consistent with the known safety profile of 
brexpiprazole. 
•  No deaths were reported in this trial. 
•  A total of 47 subjects (49.5%) overall, with 23 subjects (46.9%) in the prior 
brexpiprazole group, and 24 subjects (52.2%) in the prior placebo group 
experienced TEAEs. 
•  Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Fifteen subjects (30.6%) in the prior 
brexpiprazole group and 19 subjects (41.3%) in the prior placebo group had TEAEs that 
were mild in severity. Eleven subjects (22.4%) in the prior brexpiprazole group and 12 
subjects (26.1%) in the prior placebo group had TEAEs that were moderate in severity. 
Severe TEAEs occurred in 2 subjects (4.1%) in the prior brexpiprazole group and 2 
subjects (4.3%) in the prior placebo group. 
• 
Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred at an incidence of at least 5% were weight 
increased, increased appetite, and somnolence. 
•  Serious TEAEs occurred in 3 subjects (3.2%); 2 subjects (4.1%) in the prior 
brexpiprazole group (dyskinesia and suicidal ideation), and 1 subject (2.2%) in the 
prior placebo group (affective disorder).

•  Six subjects (6.3%) had TEAEs leading to discontinuation. In the prior brexpiprazole 
group, 2 subjects (4.1%) discontinued investigational medicinal product (IMP) due to the 
TEAEs of weight increased and irritability. In the prior placebo group, 4 subject (8.7%) 
discontinued IMP due to the TEAE of weight increased, affective disorder, anxiety, and 
blunted affect. 
• 
The incidence of subjects with potentially drug-related TEAEs was 27.4% overall, with 
24.5% in the prior brexpiprazole group compared to 30.4% in the prior placebo group. 
The potentially drug-related TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of subjects were weight 
increased (11.6% [10.2% in the prior brexpiprazole versus 13.0% in the prior placebo]), 
increased appetite (6.3%, [4.1% 
in the prior brexpiprazole versus 8.7% in the prior placebo]), and somnolence (5.3%, 
[8.2% in the prior brexpiprazole versus 2.2% in the prior placebo]). 
•  A total of 6 subjects (6.3%) reported EPS-related TEAEs; 2 subjects (4.1%) in the prior 
brexpiprazole group and 4 subjects (8.7%) in the prior placebo group. None of the TEAEs 
were serious or led to discontinuation. No clinically significant changes from baseline 
were observed in SAS, AIMS, or BARS scores. 
•  One serious TEAE of suicidal ideation was reported during the trial. Based on the C-
SSRS, no suicidal behavior was reported during the treatment or follow-up period; 
however, suicidal ideation was reported for 6 subjects (6.3%) overall, with 4 subjects 
(8.2%) in the prior brexpiprazole group and 2 subjects (4.3%) in the prior placebo 
group. None of the suicidal ideations reported in the C-SSRS were considered a TEAE. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline based on the review of the 
C-SSRS data. 
•  Weight-related TEAEs occurred in 13 subjects (13.7%) overall; 5 subjects (10.2%) in 
the prior brexpiprazole group and 8 subjects (17.4%) in the prior placebo group. None 
of the TEAEs were serious, but 1 TEAE of increased weight resulted in the 
discontinuation of IMP. 
• 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory results, vital signs, or ECGs. 
•  While brexpiprazole is known to impact prolactin levels, very few subjects were 
assessed post baseline, precluding any conclusions from these data. 
•  Efficacy results (secondary endpoint) 
• 
• 
• 
For the secondary endpoint change from baseline to Week 26 in the ABC-I subscale 
score, a change from baseline to Week 26 in mean (SD) ABC-I subscale score was seen 
overall −6.14 (8.16) and in both the prior brexpiprazole (−5.47 [8.06]) and prior 
placebo (−7.0 [8.36]) groups. 
For the secondary endpoint change from baseline to Week 26 in CGI-S scale score 
targeted on irritability, a change from baseline to Week 26 in mean (SD) CGI-S subscale 
score was seen overall (−0.73 [0.96]) and in both the prior brexpiprazole (−0.78 
[0.99]) and prior placebo (−0.68 [0.94]) groups. 
Exploratory analyses showed results consistent with the other efficacy endpoint analyses. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in reciprocal

social communication and social interaction (verbal and nonverbal), as defined by the Diagnostic 
and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  5th  edition  (DSM-5).  The  severity  of  ASD  is  defined 
by the degree of restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. Symptoms 
are  present  from  early  childhood  and  contribute  to  difficulties  in  developing,  maintaining,  and 
understanding relationships. 
In  addition  to  the  core  symptoms  that  characterize  the  disorder,  children  and  adolescents  with 
ASD often suffer from problem behaviours such as symptoms of irritability and aggression, which 
may manifest as tantrums, self-injury, and aggressive behaviours toward others. Approximately 
20%  of  people  with  ASD  exhibit 
irritability  and  aggression  with  >  50%  exhibiting 
significant  emotion dysregulation. Irritability and aggression often negatively affect the lives of 
people with ASD and their families. 
Globally,  there  are  few  to  no  therapeutic  options  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  iASD. 
Risperidone and aripiprazole are the only two medications approved in the US and Japan for the 
treatment of iASD. There are no medications approved in the EU or UK for the treatment of this 
condition. 
Two trials have been conducted to ascertain the effects of brexpiprazole on irritability in children 
and adolescent subjects, ages 5 to 17 years, with a diagnosis of ASD (Trial 331-201-00148) and 
to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  brexpiprazole  in  children  and  adolescent 
subjects with irritability in ASD who have completed the corresponding phase 3 efficacy trial. 
Trial 331-201-00148 
Trial  331-201-00148  was  a  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
8- week trial, designed to evaluate the effects of flexibly-dosed brexpiprazole 0.25 to 3 mg/day, 
compared with placebo on irritability in children and adolescent subjects, ages 5 to 17 years, with 
a diagnosis of ASD. 
The  trial  consisted  of  a  1  to  28  day  screening  period,  followed  by  an  8  week  double-blind 
treatment period, and a 21-day post-treatment safety follow-up period. 
Subjects  were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  brexpiprazole  or  placebo  daily.  On  day  1  of  the 
treatment period, subjects began titration to a target dose range of IMP based on body weight. 
The study design is compliant with EMA Guidelines (EMA/CHMP/598082/2013). 
Trial population: A total of 119 subjects were randomized. 
Subjects (5 to 17 years of age,  with a current primary DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD) with an ABC-I 
subscale score ≥  18 and with a CGI-S scale score ≥  4 pertaining to irritability at screening and at 
baseline were enrolled. 
The eligibility criteria are considered adequate. 
Demographics  baseline  characteristics  were  similar  for  most  parameters  between  the 
brexpiprazole  and placebo groups as well as the baseline mean ABC-I subscale and CGI-S. 
Statistical  methods:  Approximately  102  subjects  will  be  randomized  (51  per  treatment  arm).  A 
sample size of 51 subjects per arm  will provide at least 85% power at a nominal 2-sided alpha 
level of 0.05 to detect a 6.0-point reduction in change from baseline in ABC-I subscale score for 
brexpiprazole  versus  placebo,  assuming  a  standard  deviation  (SD)  =  10.  This  assumption  for 
calculation is considered acceptable.

The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the OC data only. The OC data refer to the actual 
observations  or  assessments  of  the  outcomes  that  are  recorded  at  all  visits  (including  the  ET 
visits) during the double-blind treatment phase, without imputation of any missing observations 
or assessments. 
As  the  first  confirmatory  clinical  trial  of  brexpiprazole  in  autistic  children  and  adolescents,  the 
proposed  trial  naturally  seeks  to  clarify  the  efficacy  of  brexpiprazole  in  improving  the  ABC-I 
subscale in the idealistic scenario of full adherence to the assigned treatment in all subjects. In 
clinical trial practice, however, instances of non-adherence such as treatment discontinuation are 
likely  to  occur  before  the  study  endpoint  (ie,  the  Week  8  visit  for  this  trial).  Therefore,  the 
hypothetical estimand is considered appropriate to use for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Primary  endpoint:  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  this  trial  was  the  mean  change  from 
baseline to Week 8 in the Aberrant Behavior checklist Irritability (ABC-I) subscale score. 
The  ABC-I  is  widely  in  use  in  clinical  trials  in  the  population  of  interest  and  its  use  as  primary 
endpoint is considered adequate for the aim of the study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement for the 
treatment with brexpiprazole compared to placebo showing a treatment difference of -1.22 (95% 
CI - 4.49, 2.05, p = 0.4597, MMRM). 
Secondary  endpoints:  The  key  secondary  endpoint  of  this  trial  was  the  mean  change  from 
baseline  to  Week  8  in  Clinical  Global  Impressions  Severity  (CGI-S)  score  for  irritability.  The 
choice of GGI-S, largely used is CNS trials, is supported. 
Due  to  the  hierarchical  testing  sequence  established,  further  formal  statistical  testing  did  not 
proceed for the key secondary endpoint. Only a numerical reduction from baseline to Week 8 in 
mean  CGI-S  score  was  seen  in  both  the  brexpiprazole  (LS  mean  [SE]  =  −1.16  [0.15])  and 
placebo (LS mean [SE] 
=  −1.09  [0.15])  groups,  nominal  p  =  0.7315,  MMRM  thus  not  supporting  the  effect  of 
brexpiprazole on CGI-S as compared to placebo. 
Safety:  in  331-201-00148  study,  safety  was  assessed  by  standard  endpoints  for  clinical  trials 
and trials of antipsychotic drugs. 
Brexpiprazole  was  found  to  be  well  tolerated  as  evidenced  by  the  high  and  comparable 
completion  rates  in  subjects  treated  with  brexpiprazole  and  placebo  (86.7%  and  88.1%, 
respectively). No deaths, serious TEAEs, or severe TEAEs were reported in this trial.  Mild TEAEs 
occurred  in  37.9% of  the subjects  in  the  brexpiprazole  group  and  29.8%  of  the  subjects  in  the 
placebo group. Moderate TEAEs occurred in 25.9% of the subjects in the brexpiprazole group and 
12.3%  of  the  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  The  TEAE  with  the  highest  incidence  was 
somnolence,  which  occurred  in  12.1%  of  subjects  in  the  brexpiprazole  group  and  5.3%  of 
subjects in the placebo group. 
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  related  to  EPS  after  brexpiprazole  treatment  was  low.  The  most 
frequently reported TEAEs related to EPS in the brexpiprazole group were akathisia and tremor, 
which  occurred  in  2  subjects  (3.4%)  each.  All  TEAEs  related  to  EPS  were  considered  mild  and 
none of them led to discontinuation. 
Evaluation  of  ECGs,  vital  signs,  laboratory  measurements  (including  liver  function  tests  and 
bilirubin,  hematology;  and  serum  lipids)  and  urinalysis  did  not  show  any  clinically  meaningful 
differences between the brexpiprazole and the placebo groups. No incidence of suicidal behavior 
or ideation was reported after brexpiprazole treatment.

Safety  results  of  Trial  331-201-00148  were  consistent  with  the  current  known  safety  profile  of 
brexpiprazole. 
Trial 331-201-00191 
Trial  331-201-00191  was  a  multicenter,  open-label  trial  conducted  to  evaluate  the  long-term 
safety  and tolerability of brexpiprazole in children and adolescent subjects with irritability in ASD 
who have completed the corresponding double-blind, phase 3 efficacy trial, Trial 331-201-00148 
and,  in  the  investigator’s  judgment,  could  potentially  benefit  from  continued  investigational 
treatment with oral brexpiprazole. 
Eligible  subjects  received  26  weeks  of  daily  treatment  with  open-label  brexpiprazole,  with  a 
follow-up contact 21 days after the last dose of open-label brexpiprazole. 
Trial  population:  A  total  of  95  subjects  were  enrolled  and  treated  in  this  trial.  The  Safety 
Sample comprised 95 subjects who received at least 1 dose of IMP. 
Statistical methods: The sample size planned for this open-label extension trial is not based on 
considerations of statistical power. 
Safety was assessed by standard primary and secondary endpoints for clinical trials and for trials 
with antipsychotic drugs. 
All  AEs  will  be  coded  by  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  and  Preferred  Term  (PT)  according  to  the 
latest version (Version 25.0 or newer) of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Safety results (primary endpoint) 
Brexpiprazole  was  found  to  be  well  tolerated  as  evidenced  by  the  high  and  comparable 
completion  rates in subjects previously treated with brexpiprazole and placebo (73.7% overall). 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  this  trial.  Serious  TEAEs  were  reported  for  a  total  of  3  subjects 
(3.2%)  and  were  dyskinesia,  suicidal  ideation,  and  affective  disorder.  The  serious  TEAE  of 
suicidal ideation was considered not related to IMP and was recovered/resolved. The incidence of 
TEAEs was slightly higher in the prior placebo group (52.2%) compared to the prior brexpiprazole 
group (46.9%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The overall incidence of subjects 
with  severe  TEAEs  was  4.2%,  similar  in  the  prior  brexpiprazole  group  and  the  prior  placebo 
group. 
With  regard  to  weight  increase,  the  TEAE  occurred  in  13.7%  of  subjects  overall,  and  was  more 
common in the prior placebo group (17.4%) than in the prior brexpiprazole group (10.2%). 
None  of  the  TEAEs  related  to  weight  gain  were  serious,  but  1  TEAE  related  to  weight  gain 
resulted in the discontinuation of IMP. 
Of the enrolled subjects, 73.9% had gained ≥7% of their body weight by Week 26. 
A  total  of  6  subjects  (6.3%)  reported  EPS-related  TEAEs.  All  of  which  were  considered  mild  to 
moderate in severity. 
Evaluation  of  ECGs,  vital  signs,  laboratory  measurements  (including  liver  function  tests  and 
bilirubin,  hematology;  and  serum  lipids)  and  urinalysis  did  not  show  any  clinically  meaningful 
differences between the prior brexpiprazole and the prior placebo groups. 
Of note, while brexpiprazole is known to impact prolactin levels, very few subjects were assessed 
post baseline, precluding any conclusions from these data.

Overall, trial 331-201-00191 showed that brexpiprazole at a dose of 0.25 mg to 3 mg was safe 
and  well tolerated in children and adolescents when taken for up to 26 weeks. 
Efficacy results (secondary endpoint) 
Overall,  subjects  had  a  mean  (SD)  change  from  baseline  of  −6.14  (8.16) to  Week  26  in  ABC-I 
subscale  score,  with  62/94  subjects  completing  the  Week  26  visit.  Thus,  there  was  minimal 
difference between prior brexpiprazole subjects and prior placebo subjects (−5.47 [8.06] vs −7.0 
[8.36]) at Week 26. 
In addition, subjects had a mean (SD) change from baseline of −0.73 (0.96) to Week 26 in CGI-
S  scale score, with 64/94 subjects completing the Week 26 visit. Prior brexpiprazole subjects had 
a mean (SD) change from baseline of −0.78 (0.99) and prior placebo subjects had a change of 
−0.68  (0.94)  at  Week  26.  The  mean  change in this  endpoint  appears to  be  consistent  between 
prior brexpiprazole subjects and prior placebo subjects. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
Trial 331-201-00148 did not meet its primary endpoint thus failing to demonstrate Brexpiprazole 
efficacy in the treatment of children and adolescents with iASD. 
Therefore, there is no data to support an indication for brexpiprazole in the treatment of iASD. 
In the open label trial 331-201-00191, brexpiprazole at a dose of 0.25 mg to 3 mg was safe and 
well tolerated in children and adolescents (ages 5 to 17 years) when taken for up to 26 weeks. The 
safety  results from  Trial  331-201-00148  and  Trial  331-201-00191  are  consistent  with  the  known 
safety profile of brexpiprazole. No new safety signals for brexpiprazole have been observed. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given in either two or three divided doses. 
Neuropathic pain 
Pregabalin treatment can be started at a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. 
Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day 
after an interval of 3 to 7 days, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an 
additional 7-day interval. 
Epilepsy 
Pregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. 
Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day 
after 1 week. The maximum dose of 600 mg per day may be achieved after an additional week. 
Generalised anxiety disorder 
The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given as two or three divided doses. The need for treatment 
should be reassessed regularly. 
Pregabalin treatment can be started with a dose of 150 mg per day. Based on individual patient 
response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to 300 mg per day after 1 week. Following an 
additional week the dose may be increased to 450 mg per day. The maximum dose of 600 mg per day 
may be achieved after an additional week. 
Discontinuation of pregabalin 
In accordance with current clinical practice, if pregabalin has to be discontinued, it is recommended 
this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week independent of the indication (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
Pregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. 
As pregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2), dose 
reduction in patients with compromised renal function must be individualised according to creatinine 
clearance (CLcr), as indicated in Table 1 determined using the following formula:

Pregabalin is removed effectively from plasma by haemodialysis (50% of drug in 4 hours). For 
patients receiving haemodialysis, the pregabalin daily dose should be adjusted based on renal function. 
In addition to the daily dose, a supplementary dose should be given immediately following every 
4 hour haemodialysis treatment (see Table 1).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Pregabalin Pfizer in children below the age of 12 years and in adolescents 
(12-17 years of age) have not been established. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Elderly 
Elderly patients may require a dose reduction of pregabalin due to a decreased renal function (see 
section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Pregabalin Pfizer may be taken with or without food. 
Pregabalin Pfizer is for oral use only. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Diabetic patients 
In accordance with current clinical practice, some diabetic patients who gain weight on pregabalin 
treatment may need to adjust hypoglycaemic medicinal products. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
There have been reports in the postmarketing experience of hypersensitivity reactions, including cases 
of angioedema. Pregabalin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as 
facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) 
SCARs including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can 
be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported rarely in association with pregabalin treatment. At the 
time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for 
skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, pregabalin should be 
withdrawn immediately and an alternative treatment considered (as appropriate).

Dizziness, somnolence, loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment 
Pregabalin treatment has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the 
occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in the elderly population. There have also been postmarketing 
reports of loss of consciousness, confusion and mental impairment. Therefore, patients should be 
advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicinal product. 
Vision-related effects 
In controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than 
did patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. In the 
clinical studies where ophthalmologic testing was conducted, the incidence of visual acuity reduction 
and visual field changes was greater in pregabalin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients; the 
incidence of fundoscopic changes was greater in placebo-treated patients (see section 5.1). 
In the postmarketing experience, visual adverse reactions have also been reported, including loss of 
vision, visual blurring or other changes of visual acuity, many of which were transient. 
Discontinuation of pregabalin may result in resolution or improvement of these visual symptoms. 
Renal failure 
Cases of renal failure have been reported and in some cases discontinuation of pregabalin did show 
reversibility of this adverse reaction. 
Withdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products 
There are insufficient data for the withdrawal of concomitant anti-epileptic medicinal products, once 
seizure control with pregabalin in the add-on situation has been reached, in order to reach 
monotherapy on pregabalin. 
Congestive heart failure 
There have been postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure in some patients receiving 
pregabalin. These reactions are mostly seen in elderly cardiovascular compromised patients during 
pregabalin treatment for a neuropathic indication. Pregabalin should be used with caution in these 
patients. Discontinuation of pregabalin may resolve the reaction. 
Treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury 
In the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury the incidence of adverse reactions 
in general, central nervous system adverse reactions and especially somnolence was increased. This 
may be attributed to an additive effect due to concomitant medicinal products (e.g. anti-spasticity 
agents) needed for this condition. This should be considered when prescribing pregabalin in this 
condition. 
Respiratory depression 
There have been reports of severe respiratory depression in relation to pregabalin use. Patients with 
compromised respiratory function, respiratory or neurological disease, renal impairment, concomitant 
use of CNS depressants and the elderly may be at higher risk of experiencing this severe adverse 
reaction. Dose adjustments may be necessary in these patients (see section 4.2). 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in 
several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled studies of anti-epileptic drugs 
has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is 
not known. Cases of suicidal ideation and behaviour have been observed in patients treated with 
pregabalin in the postmarketing experience (see section 4.8). An epidemiological study using a 
self-controlled study design (comparing treatment periods with non-treatment periods within an 
individual) showed evidence of an increased risk of new onset of suicidal behaviour and death by 
suicide in patients treated with pregabalin 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal 
ideation or behaviour emerge. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour 
and appropriate treatment should be considered. Discontinuation of pregabalin treatment should be 
considered in case of suicidal ideation and behaviour. 
Reduced lower gastrointestinal tract function 
There are postmarketing reports of events related to reduced lower gastrointestinal tract function (e.g. 
intestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, constipation) when pregabalin was co-administered with 
medications that have the potential to produce constipation, such as opioid analgesics. When 
pregabalin and opioids will be used in combination, measures to prevent constipation may be 
considered (especially in female patients and elderly). 
Concomitant use with opioids 
Caution is advised when prescribing pregabalin concomitantly with opioids due to risk of CNS 
depression (see section 4.5). In a case-control study of opioid users, those patients who took pregabalin 
concomitantly with an opioid had an increased risk for opioid-related death compared to opioid use 
alone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.19 – 2.36]). This increased risk was observed at low 
doses of pregabalin (≤ 300 mg, aOR 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04 – 2.22]) and there was a trend for a greater risk 
at high doses of pregabalin (> 300 mg, aOR 2.51 [95% CI 1.24 – 5.06]). 
Misuse, abuse potential or dependence 
Pregabalin can cause drug dependence, which may occur at therapeutic doses. Cases of abuse and 
misuse have been reported. Patients with a history of substance abuse may be at higher risk for 
pregabalin misuse, abuse and dependence, and pregabalin should be used with caution in such patients. 
Before prescribing pregabalin, the patient’s risk of misuse, abuse or dependence should be carefully 
evaluated. 
Patients treated with pregabalin should be monitored for symptoms of pregabalin misuse, abuse or 
dependence, such as development of tolerance, dose escalation and drug-seeking behaviour. 
Withdrawal symptoms 
After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with pregabalin, withdrawal symptoms 
have been observed. The following symptoms have been reported: insomnia, headache, nausea, anxiety, 
diarrhoea, flu syndrome, nervousness, depression, suicidal ideation, pain, convulsion, hyperhidrosis and 
dizziness. The occurrence of withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of pregabalin may 
indicate drug dependence (see section 4.8). The patient should be informed about this at the start of the 
treatment. If pregabalin should be discontinued, it is recommended this should be done gradually over a 
minimum of 1 week independent of the indication (see section 4.2). 
Convulsions, including status epilepticus and grand mal convulsions, may occur during pregabalin use 
or shortly after discontinuing pregabalin. 
Concerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence and 
severity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related. 
Encephalopathy 
Cases of encephalopathy have been reported, mostly in patients with underlying conditions that may 
precipitate encephalopathy. 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Pregabalin Pfizer use in the first-trimester of pregnancy may cause major birth defects in the unborn 
child. Pregabalin should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly 
outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective 
contraception during treatment (see section 4.6). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lactose intolerance 
Pregabalin Pfizer contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product.  
Sodium content 
Pregabalin Pfizer contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule. Patients on low sodium 
diets can be informed that this medicinal product is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism 
in humans (< 2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), does not inhibit drug metabolism 
in vitro, and is not bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, 
pharmacokinetic interactions. 
In vivo studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Accordingly, in in vivo studies no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed 
between pregabalin and phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, lorazepam, 
oxycodone or ethanol. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that oral antidiabetics, diuretics, 
insulin, phenobarbital, tiagabine and topiramate had no clinically significant effect on pregabalin 
clearance. 
Oral contraceptives, norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol 
Co-administration of pregabalin with the oral contraceptives norethisterone and/or ethinyl oestradiol 
does not influence the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either substance. 
Central nervous system influencing medical products 
Pregabalin may potentiate the effects of ethanol and lorazepam. 
In the postmarketing experience, there are reports of respiratory failure, coma and deaths in patients 
taking pregabalin and opioids and/or other central nervous system (CNS) depressant medicinal 
products. Pregabalin appears to be additive in the impairment of cognitive and gross motor function 
caused by oxycodone. 
Interactions and the elderly 
No specific pharmacodynamic interaction studies were conducted in elderly volunteers. Interaction 
studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment (see 
section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats (see section 5.2). Pregabalin may cross the 
human placenta. 
Major congenital malformations 
Data from a Nordic observational study of more than 2700 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin in the 
first trimester showed a higher prevalence of major congenital malformations (MCM) among the 
paediatric population (live or stillborn) exposed to pregabalin compared to the unexposed population 
(5.9% vs. 4.1%). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The risk of MCM among the paediatric population exposed to pregabalin in the first trimester was 
slightly higher compared to unexposed population (adjusted prevalence ratio and 95% confidence 
interval: 1.14 (0.96-1.35)), and compared to population exposed to lamotrigine (1.29 (1.01–1.65)) or to 
duloxetine (1.39 (1.07–1.82)). 
The analyses on specific malformations showed higher risks for malformations of the nervous system, 
the eye, orofacial clefts, urinary malformations and genital malformations, but numbers were small 
and estimates imprecise. 
Pregabalin Pfizer should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the 
mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). 
Breast-feeding 
Pregabalin is excreted into human milk (see section 5.2). The effect of pregabalin on newborns/infants 
is unknown. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
pregabalin therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of pregabalin on female fertility.  
In a clinical trial to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm motility, healthy male subjects were 
exposed to pregabalin at a dose of 600 mg/day. After 3 months of treatment, there were no effects on 
sperm motility.  
A fertility study in female rats has shown adverse reproductive effects. Fertility studies in male rats 
have shown adverse reproductive and developmental effects. The clinical relevance of these findings 
is unknown (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pregabalin Pfizer may have minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Pregabalin Pfizer may cause dizziness and somnolence and therefore may influence the ability to drive 
or use machines. Patients are advised not to drive, operate complex machinery or engage in other 
potentially hazardous activities until it is known whether this medicinal product affects their ability to 
perform these activities. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The pregabalin clinical programme involved over 8,900 patients exposed to pregabalin, of whom over 
5,600 were in double-blind placebo controlled trials. The most commonly reported adverse reactions 
were dizziness and somnolence. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity. In all 
controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12% for patients receiving 
pregabalin and 5% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in 
discontinuation from pregabalin treatment groups were dizziness and somnolence. 
In table 2 below all adverse reactions, which occurred at an incidence greater than placebo and in more 
than one patient, are listed by class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable 
effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The adverse reactions listed may also be associated with the underlying disease and/or concomitant 
medicinal products. 
In the treatment of central neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury the incidence of adverse reactions 
in general, CNS adverse reactions and especially somnolence was increased (see section 4.4).

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with pregabalin withdrawal symptoms 
have been observed. The following symptoms have been reported: insomnia, headache, nausea, 
anxiety, diarrhoea, flu syndrome, convulsions, nervousness, depression, suicidal ideation, pain, 
hyperhidrosis and dizziness. These symptoms may indicate drug dependence. The patient should be 
informed about this at the start of the treatment. Concerning discontinuation of long-term treatment of 
pregabalin, data suggest that the incidence and severity of withdrawal symptoms may be dose-related 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The pregabalin safety profile observed in five paediatric studies in patients with partial seizures with 
or without secondary generalisation (12-week efficacy and safety study in patients 4 to 16 years of 
age, n=295; 14-day efficacy and safety study in patients 1 month to younger than 4 years of age, 
n=175; pharmacokinetic and tolerability study, n=65; and two 1 year open label follow on safety 
studies, n=54 and n=431) was similar to that observed in the adult studies of patients with epilepsy. 
The most common adverse events observed in the 12-week study with pregabalin treatment were 
somnolence, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, increased appetite, weight increased, and 
nasopharyngitis. The most common adverse events observed in the 14-day study with pregabalin 
11 
 
 
 
 
treatment were somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, and pyrexia (see sections 4.2, 5.1 and 
5.2). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the postmarketing experience, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed when 
pregabalin was taken in overdose included somnolence, confusional state, agitation, and restlessness. 
Seizures were also reported. 
In rare occasions, cases of coma have been reported. 
Treatment of pregabalin overdose should include general supportive measures and may include 
haemodialysis if necessary (see section 4.2 Table 1).

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anti-epileptics, other anti-epileptics ATC code: N03AX16 
The active substance, pregabalin, is a gamma-aminobutyric acid analogue 
[(S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid].  
Mechanism of action 
Pregabalin binds to an auxiliary subunit (α2-δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central 
nervous system. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Neuropathic pain  
Efficacy has been shown in trials in diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and spinal cord 
injury. Efficacy has not been studied in other models of neuropathic pain. 
Pregabalin has been studied in 10 controlled clinical trials of up to 13 weeks with twice a day dosing 
(BID) and up to 8 weeks with three times a day (TID) dosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles 
for BID and TID dosing regimens were similar. 
In clinical trials up to 12 weeks for both peripheral and central neuropathic pain, a reduction in pain 
was seen by Week 1 and was maintained throughout the treatment period. 
In controlled clinical trials in peripheral neuropathic pain 35% of the pregabalin treated patients and 
18% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score. For patients not experiencing 
somnolence, such an improvement was observed in 33% of patients treated with pregabalin and 
18% of patients on placebo. For patients who experienced somnolence the responder rates were 48% 
on pregabalin and 16% on placebo. 
In the controlled clinical trial in central neuropathic pain 22% of the pregabalin treated patients and 
7% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score.

Epilepsy 
Adjunctive Treatment 
Pregabalin has been studied in 3 controlled clinical trials of 12 week duration with either BID or TID 
dosing. Overall, the safety and efficacy profiles for BID and TID dosing regimens were similar. 
A reduction in seizure frequency was observed by Week 1. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive treatment for epilepsy in paediatric patients below 
the age of 12 and adolescents has not been established. The adverse events observed in a 
pharmacokinetic and tolerability study that enrolled patients from 3 months to 16 years of age (n=65) 
with partial onset seizures were similar to those observed in adults. Results of a 12-week 
placebo-controlled study of 295 paediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years and a 14-day placebo-controlled 
study of 175 paediatric patients aged 1 month to younger than 4 years of age performed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures and 
two 1 year open label safety studies in 54 and 431 paediatric patients respectively, from 3 months to 
16 years of age with epilepsy indicate that the adverse events of pyrexia and upper respiratory 
infections were observed more frequently than in adult studies of patients with epilepsy (see sections 
4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). 
In the 12-week placebo-controlled study, paediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) were assigned to 
pregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (maximum, 150 mg/day), pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum, 
600 mg/day), or placebo. The percentage of subjects with at least a 50% reduction in partial onset 
seizures as compared to baseline was 40.6% of subjects treated with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day 
(p=0.0068 versus placebo), 29.1% of subjects treated with pregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.2600 versus 
placebo) and 22.6% of those receiving placebo. 
In the 14-day placebo-controlled study, paediatric patients (1 month to younger than 4 years of age) 
were assigned to pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Median 24-hour 
seizure frequencies at baseline and at the final visit were 4.7 and 3.8 for pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, 5.4 
and 1.4 for pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, and 2.9 and 2.3 for placebo, respectively. Pregabalin 
14 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the log-transformed partial onset seizure frequency versus placebo 
(p=0.0223); pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day did not show improvement relative to placebo.  
In a 12-week placebo-controlled study in subjects with Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic (PGTC) 
seizures 219 subjects (aged 5 to 65 years, of which 66 were aged 5 to 16 years) were assigned to 
pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day (maximum 300 mg/day), 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day) or placebo as 
adjunctive therapy. The percentage of subjects with at least a 50% reduction in PGTC seizure rate was 
41.3%, 38.9% and 41.7% for pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day, pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day and placebo 
respectively.  
Monotherapy (newly diagnosed patients) 
Pregabalin has been studied in 1 controlled clinical trial of 56 week duration with BID dosing. 
Pregabalin did not achieve non-inferiority to lamotrigine based on the 6-month seizure freedom 
endpoint. Pregabalin and lamotrigine were similarly safe and well tolerated. 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
Pregabalin has been studied in 6 controlled trials of 4-6 week duration, an elderly study of 8 week 
duration and a long-term relapse prevention study with a double-blind relapse prevention phase of 
6 months duration. 
Relief of the symptoms of GAD as reflected by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was 
observed by Week 1. 
In controlled clinical trials (4-8 week duration) 52% of the pregabalin treated patients and 38% of the 
patients on placebo had at least a 50% improvement in HAM-A total score from baseline to endpoint. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In controlled trials, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin reported blurred vision than 
did patients treated with placebo which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. 
Ophthalmologic testing (including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated 
funduscopic examination) was conducted in over 3600 patients within controlled clinical trials. In 
these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 6.5% of patients treated with pregabalin, and 4.8% of 
placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 12.4% of pregabalin-treated, and 11.7% 
of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 1.7% of pregabalin-treated and 
2.1% of placebo-treated patients. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pregabalin steady-state pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy volunteers, patients with epilepsy 
receiving anti-epileptic drugs and patients with chronic pain. 
Absorption 
Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered in the fasted state, with peak plasma concentrations 
occurring within 1 hour following both single and multiple dose administration. Pregabalin oral 
bioavailability is estimated to be ≥ 90% and is independent of dose. Following repeated 
administration, steady state is achieved within 24 to 48 hours. The rate of pregabalin absorption is 
decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25-30% and a delay 
in tmax to approximately 2.5 hours. However, administration of pregabalin with food has no clinically 
significant effect on the extent of pregabalin absorption. 
Distribution  
In preclinical studies, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats, and 
monkeys. Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating 
rats. In humans, the apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral administration is 
approximately 0.56 l/kg. Pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation  
Pregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. Following a dose of radiolabelled pregabalin, 
approximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged pregabalin. The 
N-methylated derivative of pregabalin, the major metabolite of pregabalin found in urine, accounted 
for 0.9% of the dose. In preclinical studies, there was no indication of racemisation of pregabalin 
S-enantiomer to the R-enantiomer. 
Elimination 
Pregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug.  
Pregabalin mean elimination half-life is 6.3 hours. Pregabalin plasma clearance and renal clearance are 
directly proportional to creatinine clearance (see section 5.2 Renal impairment). 
Dose adjustment in patients with reduced renal function or undergoing haemodialysis is necessary (see 
section 4.2 Table 1). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Pregabalin pharmacokinetics are linear over the recommended daily dose range. Inter-subject 
pharmacokinetic variability for pregabalin is low (< 20%). Multiple dose pharmacokinetics are 
predictable from single-dose data. Therefore, there is no need for routine monitoring of plasma 
concentrations of pregabalin. 
Gender 
Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma 
concentrations of pregabalin. 
Renal impairment 
Pregabalin clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. In addition, pregabalin is 
effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis (following a 4 hour haemodialysis treatment 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma pregabalin concentrations are reduced by approximately 50%). Because renal elimination is the 
major elimination pathway, dose reduction in patients with renal impairment and dose 
supplementation following haemodialysis is necessary (see section 4.2 Table 1). 
Hepatic impairment 
No specific pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in patients with impaired liver function. Since 
pregabalin does not undergo significant metabolism and is excreted predominantly as unchanged drug 
in the urine, impaired liver function would not be expected to significantly alter pregabalin plasma 
concentrations. 
Paediatric population 
Pregabalin pharmacokinetics were evaluated in paediatric patients with epilepsy (age groups: 1 to 
23 months, 2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 years and 12 to 16 years) at dose levels of 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg/day 
in a pharmacokinetic and tolerability study. 
After oral administration of pregabalin in paediatric patients in the fasted state, in general, time to 
reach peak plasma concentration was similar across the entire age group and occurred 0.5 hours to 
2 hours postdose. 
Pregabalin Cmax and AUC parameters increased in a linear manner with increasing dose within each 
age group. The AUC was lower by 30% in paediatric patients below a weight of 30 kg due to an 
increased body weight adjusted clearance of 43% for these patients in comparison to patients weighing 
≥30 kg. 
Pregabalin terminal half-life averaged about 3 to 4 hours in paediatric patients up to 6 years of age, 
and 4 to 6 hours in those 7 years of age and older. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that creatinine clearance was a significant covariate of 
pregabalin oral clearance, body weight was a significant covariate of pregabalin apparent oral volume 
of distribution, and these relationships were similar in paediatric and adult patients. 
Pregabalin pharmacokinetics in patients younger than 3 months old have not been studied (see sections 
4.2, 4.8 and 5.1). 
Elderly 
Pregabalin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age. This decrease in pregabalin oral clearance 
is consistent with decreases in creatinine clearance associated with increasing age. Reduction of 
pregabalin dose may be required in patients who have age related compromised renal function (see 
section 4.2 Table 1). 
Breast-feeding mothers 
The pharmacokinetics of 150 mg pregabalin given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) was evaluated 
in 10 lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum. Lactation had little to no influence on 
pregabalin pharmacokinetics. Pregabalin was excreted into breast milk with average steady-state 
concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated infant dose from breast 
milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) of women receiving 300 mg/day or the 
maximum dose of 600 mg/day would be 0.31 or 0.62 mg/kg/day, respectively. These estimated doses 
are approximately 7% of the total daily maternal dose on a mg/kg basis. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In conventional safety pharmacology studies in animals, pregabalin was well-tolerated at clinically 
relevant doses. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys CNS effects were observed, 
including hypoactivity, hyperactivity and ataxia. An increased incidence of retinal atrophy commonly 
observed in aged albino rats was seen after long-term exposure to pregabalin at exposures ≥ 5 times 
the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended clinical dose. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregabalin was not teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits. Foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits occurred only 
at exposures sufficiently above human exposure. In prenatal/postnatal toxicity studies, pregabalin 
induced offspring developmental toxicity in rats at exposures > 2 times the maximum recommended 
human exposure. 
Adverse effects on fertility in male and female rats were only observed at exposures sufficiently in 
excess of therapeutic exposure. Adverse effects on male reproductive organs and sperm parameters 
were reversible and occurred only at exposures sufficiently in excess of therapeutic exposure or were 
associated with spontaneous degenerative processes in male reproductive organs in the rat. Therefore 
the effects were considered of little or no clinical relevance. 
Pregabalin is not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. 
Two-year carcinogenicity studies with pregabalin were conducted in rats and mice. No tumours were 
observed in rats at exposures up to 24 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended 
clinical dose of 600 mg/day. In mice, no increased incidence of tumours was found at exposures 
similar to the mean human exposure, but an increased incidence of haemangiosarcoma was observed 
at higher exposures. The non-genotoxic mechanism of pregabalin-induced tumour formation in mice 
involves platelet changes and associated endothelial cell proliferation. These platelet changes were not 
present in rats or in humans based on short-term and limited long-term clinical data. There is no 
evidence to suggest an associated risk to humans. 
In juvenile rats the types of toxicity do not differ qualitatively from those observed in adult rats. 
However, juvenile rats are more sensitive. At therapeutic exposures, there was evidence of CNS 
clinical signs of hyperactivity and bruxism and some changes in growth (transient body weight gain 
suppression). Effects on the oestrus cycle were observed at 5-fold the human therapeutic exposure. 
Reduced acoustic startle response was observed in juvenile rats 1-2 weeks after exposure at > 2 times 
the human therapeutic exposure. Nine weeks after exposure, this effect was no longer observable.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pregabalin Pfizer is and what it is used for 
Pregabalin Pfizer belongs to a group of medicines used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain and 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. 
Peripheral and central neuropathic pain: Pregabalin Pfizer is used to treat long lasting pain caused 
by damage to the nerves. A variety of diseases can cause peripheral neuropathic pain, such as diabetes 
or shingles. Pain sensations may be described as hot, burning, throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, 
cramping, aching, tingling, numbness, pins and needles. Peripheral and central neuropathic pain may 
also be associated with mood changes, sleep disturbance, fatigue (tiredness), and can have an impact 
on physical and social functioning and overall quality of life. 
Epilepsy: Pregabalin Pfizer is used to treat a certain form of epilepsy (partial seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation) in adults. Your doctor will prescribe Pregabalin Pfizer for you to help treat 
your epilepsy when your current treatment is not controlling your condition. You should take 
Pregabalin Pfizer in addition to your current treatment. Pregabalin Pfizer is not intended to be used 
alone, but should always be used in combination with other anti-epileptic treatment. 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder: Pregabalin Pfizer is used to treat Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
(GAD). The symptoms of GAD are prolonged excessive anxiety and worry that are difficult to control. 
GAD can also cause restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued (tired), having 
difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, feeling irritable, having muscle tension or sleep 
disturbance. This is different to the stresses and strains of everyday life.

2.  What you need to know before you take Pregabalin Pfizer 
Do not take Pregabalin Pfizer 
If you are allergic to pregabalin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and Precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pregabalin Pfizer. 
•  Some patients taking Pregabalin Pfizer have reported symptoms suggesting an allergic reaction. 
These symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat, as well as diffuse skin rash. 
Should you experience any of these reactions, you should contact your physician immediately. 
•  Serious skin rashes including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have 
been reported in association with pregabalin. Stop using pregabalin and seek medical attention 
immediately if you notice any of the symptoms related to these serious skin reactions described in 
section 4. 
•  Pregabalin Pfizer has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the 
occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in elderly patients. Therefore, you should be careful until 
you are used to any effect the medicine might have. 
•  Pregabalin Pfizer may cause blurring or loss of vision, or other changes in eyesight, many of 
which are temporary. You should immediately tell your doctor if you experience any changes in 
your vision. 
•  Some patients with diabetes who gain weight while taking pregabalin may need an alteration in 
their diabetic medicines. 
•  Certain side effects may be more common, such as sleepiness, because patients with spinal cord 
injury may be taking other medicines to treat, for example, pain or spasticity, that have similar 
side effects to Pregabalin and the severity of these effects may be increased when taken together. 
•  There have been reports of heart failure in some patients when taking Pregabalin Pfizer; these 
patients were mostly elderly with cardiovascular conditions. Before taking this medicine you 
should tell your doctor if you have a history of heart disease. 
•  There have been reports of kidney failure in some patients when taking Pregabalin Pfizer. If while 
taking Pregabalin Pfizer you notice decreased urination, you should tell your doctor as stopping 
the medicine may improve this. 
•  Some patients being treated with anti-epileptics such as Pregabalin Pfizer have had thoughts of 
harming or killing themselves or shown suicidal behaviour. If at any time you have these thoughts 
or show such behaviour, immediately contact your doctor. 
•  When Pregabalin Pfizer is taken with other medicines that may cause constipation (such as some 
types of pain medicines) it is possible that gastrointestinal problems may occur (e.g. constipation, 
blocked or paralysed bowel). Tell your doctor if you experience constipation, especially if you are 
prone to this problem. 
•  Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been dependent on 
alcohol, prescription medicines or illegal drugs; it may mean you have a greater risk of becoming 
dependent on Pregabalin Pfizer. 
•  There have been reports of convulsions when taking Pregabalin Pfizer or shortly after stopping 
Pregabalin Pfizer. If you experience a convulsion, contact your doctor immediately. 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  There have been reports of reduction in brain function (encephalopathy) in some patients taking 
Pregabalin Pfizer when they have other conditions. Tell your doctor if you have a history of any 
serious medical conditions, including liver or kidney disease. 
•  There have been reports of breathing difficulties. If you have nervous system disorders, respiratory 
disorders, renal impairment, or you are older than 65, your doctor may prescribe you a different 
dosing regimen. Contact your doctor if you experience trouble breathing or shallow breaths. 
Dependence  
Some people may become dependent on Pregabalin Pfizer (a need to keep taking the medicine). They 
may have withdrawal effects when they stop using Pregabalin Pfizer (see section 3, “How to take 
Pregabalin Pfizer” and “If you stop taking Pregabalin Pfizer”). If you have concerns that you may 
become dependent on Pregabalin Pfizer, it is important that you consult your doctor.  
If you notice any of the following signs whilst taking Pregabalin Pfizer, it could be a sign that you 
have become dependent: 
•  You need to take the medicine for longer than advised by your prescriber  
•  You feel you need to take more than the recommended dose  
•  You are using the medicine for reasons other than prescribed  
•  You have made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to quit or control the use of the medicine 
•  When you stop taking the medicine you feel unwell, and you feel better once taking the medicine 
again  
If you notice any of these, speak to your doctor to discuss the best treatment pathway for you, 
including when it is appropriate to stop and how to do this safely. 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) has not been established 
and therefore, pregabalin should not be used in this age group. 
Other medicines and Pregabalin Pfizer 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.  
Pregabalin Pfizer and certain other medicines may influence each other (interaction). When taken with 
certain other medicines which have sedative effects (including opioids), Pregabalin Pfizer may 
potentiate these effects, and could lead to respiratory failure, coma and death. The degree of dizziness, 
sleepiness and decreased concentration may be increased if Pregabalin Pfizer is taken together with 
medicines containing: 
Oxycodone – (used as a pain-killer) 
Lorazepam – (used for treating anxiety) 
Alcohol  
Pregabalin Pfizer may be taken with oral contraceptives. 
Pregabalin Pfizer with food, drink and alcohol 
Pregabalin Pfizer capsules may be taken with or without food.  
It is advised not to drink alcohol while taking Pregabalin Pfizer. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Pregabalin Pfizer should not be taken during pregnancy or when breast-feeding, unless you are told 
otherwise by your doctor. Pregabalin use during the first 3 months of pregnancy may cause birth 
defects in the unborn child that require medical treatment. In a study reviewing data from women in 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nordic countries who took pregabalin in the first 3 months of pregnancy, 6 babies in every 100 had 
such birth defects. This compares to 4 babies in every 100 born to women not treated with pregabalin 
in the study. Abnormalities of the face (orofacial clefts), the eyes, the nervous system (including the 
brain), kidneys and genitals have been reported. 
Effective contraception must be used by women of childbearing potential. If you are pregnant or 
breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Pregabalin Pfizer may produce dizziness, sleepiness and decreased concentration. You should not 
drive, operate complex machinery or engage in other potentially hazardous activities until you know 
whether this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities. 
Pregabalin Pfizer contains lactose monohydrate  
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
Pregabalin Pfizer contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per hard capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Pregabalin Pfizer 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. Do not take more medicine than prescribed. 
Your doctor will determine what dose is appropriate for you. 
Pregabalin Pfizer is for oral use only. 
Peripheral and central neuropathic pain, epilepsy or Generalised Anxiety Disorder:  
•  Take the number of capsules as instructed by your doctor.  
•  The dose, which has been adjusted for you and your condition, will generally be between 150 mg 
and 600 mg each day.  
•  Your doctor will tell you to take Pregabalin Pfizer either twice or three times a day. For twice a 
day take Pregabalin Pfizer once in the morning and once in the evening, at about the same time 
each day. For three times a day take Pregabalin Pfizer once in the morning, once in the afternoon 
and once in the evening, at about the same time each day. 
If you have the impression that the effect of Pregabalin Pfizer is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
If you are an elderly patient (over 65 years of age), you should take Pregabalin Pfizer normally except 
if you have problems with your kidneys. 
Your doctor may prescribe a different dosing schedule and/or dose if you have problems with your 
kidneys. 
Swallow the capsule whole with water. 
Continue taking Pregabalin Pfizer until your doctor tells you to stop.  
If you take more Pregabalin Pfizer than you should 
Call your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency unit immediately. Take your box or bottle of 
Pregabalin Pfizer capsules with you. You may feel sleepy, confused, agitated, or restless as a result of 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
taking more Pregabalin Pfizer than you should. Fits and unconsciousness (coma) have also been 
reported. 
If you forget to take Pregabalin Pfizer 
It is important to take your Pregabalin Pfizer capsules regularly at the same time each day. If you 
forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is time for your next dose. In that case, 
just carry on with the next dose as normal. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Pregabalin Pfizer 
Do not suddenly stop taking Pregabalin Pfizer. If you want to stop taking Pregabalin Pfizer, discuss 
this with your doctor first. They will tell you how to do this. If your treatment is stopped it should be 
done gradually over a minimum of 1 week. After stopping a short or long-term treatment with 
Pregabalin Pfizer, you need to know that you may experience certain side effects, so-called withdrawal 
effects. These effects include, trouble sleeping, headache, nausea, feeling anxious, diarrhoea, flu-like 
symptoms, convulsions, nervousness, depression, thoughts of harming or killing yourself, pain, 
sweating, and dizziness. These effects may occur more commonly or severely if you have been taking 
Pregabalin Pfizer for a longer period of time. If you experience withdrawal effects, you should contact 
your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Becoming dependent on Pregabalin Pfizer (‘drug dependence’). 
After stopping a short or long-term treatment with Pregabalin Pfizer, you need to know that you may

Pfizer”). 
If you experience swollen face or tongue or if your skin turns red and starts to blister or peel, 
you should seek immediate medical advice. 
Certain side effects may be more common, such as sleepiness, because patients with spinal cord injury

Pregabalin and the severity of these effects may be increased when taken together. 
The following adverse reaction has been reported in the postmarketing experience: Trouble breathing, 
shallow breaths. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system

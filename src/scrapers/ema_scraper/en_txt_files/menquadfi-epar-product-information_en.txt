CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older 
against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Individuals 12 months of age and older: One single dose (0.5 mL). 
Primary vaccination: 
• 
Booster vaccination: 
• 
A single 0.5 mL dose of MenQuadfi may be used to boost subjects who have previously received a 
meningococcal vaccine containing the same serogroups (see section 5.1). 
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with MenQuadfi are available up to 7 
years after vaccination (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
• 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
There are no data available to indicate the need for or timing of a booster dose of MenQuadfi (see 
section 5.1). 
Other paediatric population 
The safety and immunogenicity of MenQuadfi in individuals under 12 months of age have not yet been 
established.  
Method of administration 
For intramuscular injection only, preferably in the deltoid region or anterolateral thigh depending on the 
recipient's age and muscle mass. 
For instructions on handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or after previous 
administration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
MenQuadfi should not be administered subcutaneously, intravascularly or intradermally. 
It is good clinical practice to precede vaccination by a review of the medical history (especially with 
regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable effects) and a clinical examination. 
Hypersensitivity 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily 
available in case of an anaphylactic event following administration of the vaccine. 
Intercurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. However, 
the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination. 
Syncope 
Syncope (fainting) and other anxiety‐related reactions can occur following or even before any 
vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent 
falling or injury and to manage syncope.  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
MenQuadfi should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs 
the risk of administration. 
Protection 
MenQuadfi will only protect against Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y. The vaccine will not 
protect against any other Neisseria meningitidis groups.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with any vaccine, vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all vaccine recipients. 
Waning of serum bactericidal antibody titres against serogroup A when using human complement in the 
assay (hSBA) has been reported for MenQuadfi and other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. The 
clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. However, if an individual is expected to be at particular 
risk of exposure to serogroup A and received a dose of MenQuadfi more than approximately one year 
previously, consideration may be given to administering a booster dose. 
Lower hSBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) against serogroup A have been observed after a single dose 
of MenQuadfi was administered to toddlers who previously received serogroup C meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM) during infancy. Nevertheless, seroprotection rates were comparable 
between treatment groups (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. This 
aspect might be considered for individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC-CRM 
vaccine in their first year of life.  
Immunodeficiency 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with 
immunodeficiency, an adequate immune response may not be elicited (see section 4.5). Persons with 
familial complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) and persons receiving treatments 
that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk of invasive 
disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W, and Y, even if they develop antibodies 
following vaccination with MenQuadfi. No data on immunocompromised patients are available. 
Tetanus immunisation 
Immunisation with MenQuadfi vaccine does not substitute for routine tetanus immunisation. 
Co-administration of MenQuadfi with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine does not impair the response to 
tetanus toxoid or impact the safety. 
Sodium content 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Use with other vaccines 
Injection sites on separate limbs and separate syringes must be used in the case of concomitant 
administration. 
For ages 12-23 months, MenQuadfi can be co-administered with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine 
(MMR) + varicella vaccine (V), combined diphtheria - tetanus - acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, 
including combination DTaP vaccines with hepatitis B (HBV), inactivated poliovirus (IPV) or 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) such as DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib (Hib conjugated to tetanus toxoid) 
vaccine and 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine (PCV-13). 
For ages 10-17 years, MenQuadfi can be co-administered with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, 
component) vaccine (adsorbed, reduced antigen(s) content) (Tdap) and human papillomavirus vaccine 
(recombinant, adsorbed) (HPV).  
There was no impact on the immune response to MenQuadfi when a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 
was co-administered. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MenQuadfi can be administered concomitantly with PCV-13. Lower hSBA GMTs on day 30 post-dose 
for serogroup A has been observed when given concomitantly. The clinical relevance of this observation 
is unknown. As a precaution in children 12-23 months of age at high risk for serogroup A disease, 
consideration might be given for administration of MenQuadfi and PCV-13 vaccines separately. 
Meningococcal vaccine naïve children aged 10-17 years had non inferior response for PT and lower 
antibody responses to FHA, PRN and FIM when Tdap vaccine was administered concomitantly with 
MenQuadfi and HPV compared to co-administration with HPV vaccine alone. The clinical implications 
of the observed pertussis antigen responses also observed with the existing quadrivalent meningococcal 
conjugate vaccines are unknown. 
Concomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably 
contralateral.  
Concomitant administration of MenQuadfi and other vaccines than those listed above has not been 
studied. 
Use with systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment an adequate immune response 
may not be elicited (see also section 4.4). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is limited amount of data on the use of MenQuadfi in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
MenQuadfi should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefits for the mother outweigh the 
potential risks, including those for the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether MenQuadfi is excreted in human milk. MenQuadfi should only be used during 
breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the potential risks. 
Fertility 
A developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rabbits. There were no effects 
on mating performances or female fertility. No study was conducted on male fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
MenQuadfi has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may temporarily affect 
the ability to drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi in individuals 12 months of age and older was evaluated in 
seven randomized, active-controlled, multi-centre pivotal studies.  In these studies, 6,308 subjects 
received either a primary dose (N=5,906) or a booster dose (N=402) of MenQuadfi and were included in 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the safety analyses. This included 1,389 toddlers aged 12 through 23 months of age, 498 children aged 2 
through 9 years, 2,289 adolescents aged 10 through 17 years, 1,684 adults aged 18 through 55 years, 
199 older adults aged 56 through 64 years, and 249 elderly aged 65 years and older. Of these, 
392 adolescents received MenQuadfi co-administered with Tdap and HPV, and 589 toddlers received 
MenQuadfi co-administered with MMR+V (N=189), DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib (N=200) or PCV-13 (N=200). 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions within 7 days after vaccination with a single dose of 
MenQuadfi alone in toddlers 12 through 23 months of age were irritability (36.7%) and injection site 
tenderness (30.6%) and in ages 2 years and above were injection site pain (38.7%) and myalgia (30.5%). 
These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. 
Rates of adverse reactions after a booster dose of MenQuadfi in adolescents and adults at least 15 years of 
age were comparable to those seen in adolescents and adults who received a primary dose of MenQuadfi. 
Rates of adverse reactions within 7 days following vaccination among toddlers were comparable when 
MMR+V were given concomitantly with or without MenQuadfi, and when DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib was given 
with or without MenQuadfi. Overall, the rates of adverse reactions were higher in toddlers who received 
PCV-13 given concomitantly with MenQuadfi (36.5%) than in toddlers who received PCV-13 alone 
(17.2%). 
In one additional clinical study, adolescents and adults 13-26 years of age primed with MenQuadfi 3-6 
years previously received MenQuadfi co-administered with meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) vaccine, 
Trumenba (N=93) or Bexsero (N=92). Rates and intensity of systemic reactions within 7 days following 
vaccination tended to be higher when MenQuadfi was given concomitantly with MenB vaccine than when 
MenQuadfi was given alone. The most common solicited systemic reaction was myalgia, of mild 
intensity, which was experienced more frequently in adolescents and adults who received MenQuadfi and 
MenB vaccine concomitantly (Trumenba, 65.2%; Bexsero, 63%) compared to those who received 
MenQuadfi alone (32.8%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions, as listed below, have been identified from clinical studies conducted 
with MenQuadfi when given alone to subjects 2 years of age and older. The safety profile observed in 
toddlers aged 12 through 23 months is presented in the paediatric population section. 
The adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories: 
Very common (≥1/10); 
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10);  
Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100);  
Rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000).  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Paediatric population 
The safety profile of MenQuadfi in children and adolescents 2 through 17 years of age was generally 
comparable to that in adults. Injection site erythema and swelling at the MenQuadfi injection site were 
reported more frequently in children 2 through 9 years of age (very common) than in the older age 
groups. 
In toddlers 12 through 23 months of age, injection site erythema and swelling (very common) at the 
MenQuadfi injection site, vomiting (common) and diarrhoea (common), were reported more frequently 
than in the older age groups. The following additional reactions, as listed below in Table 2, have been 
reported very commonly or commonly following administration of MenQuadfi in toddlers during clinical 
trials:

Older population 
Overall, within 7 days after vaccination with a single dose of MenQuadfi, the same injection site and 
systemic adverse reactions were observed in older (≥56 years of age) and younger adults (18 through 
55 years old) but at lower frequencies; except for injection site pruritus, which was more frequent 
(common) in older adults. These adverse reactions mostly were mild or moderate in intensity. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Overdose with MenQuadfi is unlikely due to its presentation as a single dose vial. In the event of 
overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended..

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: meningococcal vaccines 
ATC code: J07AH08  
Mechanism of action 
Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal diseases via complement 
mediated bactericidal activity.  
MenQuadfi induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for primary vaccination in toddlers (12-23 months of 
age), children and adolescents (2-17 years of age), adults (18-55 years of age) and older adults (56 years 
and above) was assessed in six pivotal studies and in one additional study in toddlers (12-23 months of 
age). The immunogenicity of a single dose of MenQuadfi for booster vaccination (subjects 15-55 years of 
age) was assessed in one pivotal study. In addition, antibody persistence after primary vaccination and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose was assessed in three studies in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents 
and adults (13-26 years of age), and older adults (≥59 years of age).    
Primary immunogenicity analyses were conducted by measuring serum bactericidal activity (SBA) using 
human serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA). Rabbit complement (rSBA) data are 
available in subsets in all age groups and generally follows the trends observed with human complement 
(hSBA) data. In addition, all subjects were assessed for primary immunogenicity measured by hSBA and 
rSBA for serogroup C in MEQ00065 study [NCT03890367]. 
Clinical data on the persistence of antibody response ≥3 years after primary vaccination with MenQuadfi 
in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents and adults (13-26 years of age), and older adults (≥ 59 years of 
age) are available. Clinical data on booster vaccination with MenQuadfi in those subjects are also 
available.  
Immunogenicity in toddlers 12 to 23 month of age 
Immunogenicity in subjects 12 through 23 months of age was evaluated in three clinical studies (MET51 
[NCT02955797], MET57 [NCT03205371] and MEQ00065 [NCT03890367]). 
MET51 was conducted in subjects who were either meningococcal vaccine naïve or had been primed with 
monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccines in their first year of life (see table 3).

** Non-inferiority criterion met 
Response in subjects previously vaccinated with MenC conjugate vaccines in their first year of life: 
The majority of monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine primed toddlers (12 through 23 months 
of age) in study MET51 (NCT02955797) had hSBA titres ≥1:8 in the MenQuadfi group (N=198) (≥ 
86.7%) and in MenACWY-TT group (N=99) (≥ 85.7%) at D30 post-vaccination. These toddlers received 
during their infancy MenC-TT or MenC-CRM vaccines. Post-vaccination seroprotection rates were 
comparable between MenQuadfi and MenACWY-TT for all serogroups regardless of the priming 
background.  
In MenC-CRM primed subjects the GMTs for serogroup A were lower in the MenQuadfi group (n=49) 
than in the MenACWY-TT group (n=25) [12.0 (8.23; 17.5) vs 42.2 (25.9; 68.8)]. After administration of 
MenQuadfi seroprotection rates (hSBA titres ≥1:8) for subjects primed with MenC-CRM were lower but 
still comparable for serogroups A and W compared with those in the MenACWY-TT group [A: 68.8% 
(53.7; 81.3) vs 96.0% (79.6; 99.9); W: 68.1% (52.9; 80.9) vs 79.2% (57.8; 92.9)]. The rates for serogroup 
Y were higher but still comparable with those in the MenACWY-TT group [95.8% (85.7; 99.5) vs 80.0% 
(59.3; 93.2)]. The rates for serogroup C were comparable in both groups [95.7% (85.5; 99.5) vs 92.0% 
(74.0; 99.0)]. The clinical relevance of these results is unknown. This aspect might be considered for 
individuals at high risk for MenA infection who received MenC-CRM vaccine in their first year of life. 
MET57 (NCT03205371) was conducted in meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers 12 through 23 months 
of age to assess the immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with paediatric 
vaccines (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib or PCV-13). Overall, the post-vaccination hSBA seroprotection 
rates in subjects who received MenQuadfi was high for all serogroups (between 88.9% and 100%). 
Seroresponse and seroprotection rates for serogroup A were comparable when MenQuadfi was co-
administered with PCV-13 and alone (56.1%, [95% CI 48.9; 63.2] and 83.7% [95% CI 77.7; 88.6] vs 
71.9% [95%CI 61.8; 80.6] and 90.6% [95%CI 82.9; 95.6]). There were differences in the hSBA GMTs 
for serogroup A when MenQuadfi was co-administered with PCV-13 (n=196) compared with MenQuadfi 
10 
 
 
 
 
administered alone (n=96) (24.6 [95%CI 20.2; 30.1] and 49.0 [95%CI 36.8; 65.3]).) The clinical 
relevance of these results is unknown but this observation might be taken into consideration for 
individuals at high risk for MenA infection and consequently vaccinations with MenQuadfi and PCV13 
might be performed separately. 
MEQ00065 (NCT03890367) study was conducted in meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers 12 through 
23 months of age to assess the immunogenicity of serogroup C using hSBA and rSBA assays following 
administration of a single dose of MenQuadfi compared to MenACWY-TT or to MenC-TT. 
Superiority of MenQuadfi was demonstrated in comparison to MenACWY-TT vaccine for the hSBA 
seroprotection rate and hSBA and rSBA GMTs to meningococcal serogroup C. Non-inferiority was 
demonstrated for the rSBA seroprotection rate to meningococcal serogroup C. 
Superiority of MenQuadfi was also demonstrated in comparison to MenC-TT vaccine for the rSBA and 
hSBA GMTs to meningococcal serogroup C and non-inferiority was demonstrated for the rSBA and 
hSBA seroprotection rates to meningococcal serogroup C (see table 4).

Immunogenicity in children 2 through 9 years of age 
Immunogenicity in subjects 2 through 9 years of age was evaluated in study MET35 (NCT03077438) 
(stratified by ages 2 through 5 and 6 through 9 years) comparing seroresponses following administration 
of either MenQuadfi or MenACWY-CRM. 
Overall, for subjects 2 through 9 years of age, immune non-inferiority, based on hSBA seroresponse, was 
demonstrated for MenQuadfi as compared to MenACWY-CRM for all four serogroups.

Immunogenicity in children and adolescents 10 through 17 years of age 
Immunogenicity in subjects aged 10 through 17 years of age was evaluated in two studies comparing 
seroresponses following administration of MenQuadfi compared to either MenACWY-CRM (MET50 
[NCT02199691]) or MenACWY-DT (MET43 [NCT02842853]). 
MET50 was conducted in meningococcal vaccine naïve subjects and seroresponse was evaluated 
following administration with either MenQuadfi alone, MenACWY-CRM alone, MenQuadfi co-
administered with Tdap and HPV or Tdap and HPV alone.

Persistence of immune response and MenQuadfi booster response 
Antibody persistence after primary vaccination and immunogenicity of a MenQuadfi booster dose was 
assessed in three studies in children (4-5 years of age), adolescents and adults (13-26 years of age), and 
older adults (≥59 years of age).

Persistence of immune response and MenQuadfi booster response in children 4 through 5 years of age 
MET62 (NCT03476135) evaluated the antibody persistence of a primary dose, immunogenicity and  
safety of a booster dose of MenQuadfi in children 4 through 5 years of age. These children were primed  
with a single dose of MenQuadfi or MenACWY-TT 3 years before as part of the phase II study MET54  
when they were 12 through 23 months old. The antibody persistence prior to the MenQuadfi booster dose 
and the booster immune response were assessed according to the vaccine (MenQuadfi or MenACWY-TT) 
children had received 3 years ago (see table 10). 
For all serogroups, hSBA GMTs were higher at D30 post-primary dose than at D0 pre-booster dose for 
MenQuadfi or MenACWY-TT. The pre-booster GMTs were higher than the pre-primary dose, indicative 
of long-term persistence of immune response.  
After the booster dose, seroprotection rates were nearly 100% for all serogroups in children primed with 
MenQuadfi.

Persistence of immune response and MenQuadfi booster response in adolescents and adults 13 through 26 
years of age 
MET59 (NCT04084769) evaluated the antibody persistence of primary dose, immunogenicity and safety 
of a booster dose of MenQuadfi in adolescents and adults 13 through 26 years of age who had received a 
single dose of MenQuadfi in study MET50 or MET43 or MenACWY-CRM in study MET50 or outside 
of Sanofi Pasteur trials 3-6 years prior. The antibody persistence prior to the MenQuadfi booster dose and 
the booster immune response were assessed according to the vaccine (MenQuadfi or MenACWY-CRM) 
subjects had received 3-6 years previously (see Table 11). 
For all serogroups, hSBA GMTs were higher at D30 post-primary dose than at D0 pre-booster for 
MenQuadfi and MenACWY-CRM primed subjects. The pre-booster GMTs were higher than the pre-
primary dose, indicative of long-term persistence of immune response. 
After the booster dose, seroprotection rates were nearly 100% for all serogroups in adolescents and adults 
primed with MenQuadfi.

and persistence in adolescents and adults (13 through 26 years) primed with MenQuadfi or

Persistence of immune response and MenQuadfi booster response in adults 59 years of age and older 
MEQ00066 (NCT04142242) evaluated the antibody persistence of primary dose, immunogenicity, and 
safety of a booster dose of MenQuadfi in adults ≥59 years of age who had received a single dose of 
MenQuadfi or MenACWY-PS ≥3 years previously in study MET49 or MET44.   
3 year persistence  
The antibody persistence prior to the MenQuadfi booster dose and the booster immune response were 
assessed according to the vaccine (MenQuadfi or MenACWY-PS) subjects had received 3 years 
previously in MET49 (Table 12).

For all serogroups, hSBA GMTs were higher at D30 post-primary dose than at D0 pre-booster dose for 
both MenQuadfi-primed and MenACWY-PS-primed adults. In addition, for both primed groups, the pre-
booster GMTs were higher than the pre-primary dose for serogroups C, W and Y (indicative of long-term 
persistence of immune response for these serogroups) and were comparable for serogroup A.

6-7 year persistence 
The antibody persistence was assessed according to the vaccine (MenQuadfi or MenACWY-PS) subjects 
had received 6-7 years previously in study MET44 (Table 13). 
For all serogroups, hSBA GMTs were higher at D30 post-primary dose than at D0 pre-booster dose for 
MenQuadfi-primed adults. The pre-booster GMTs were higher than the pre-primary dose for serogroup C, 
W, and Y in MenQuadfi-primed adults, indicative of long-term persistence of immune response for these 
serogroups, and were comparable for serogroup A.

1.  What MenQuadfi is and what it is used for 
MenQuadfi (MenACWY) is a vaccine that can be given to children from 1 year of age, adolescents and 
adults.  
MenQuadfi helps to protect against infections caused by a type of bacteria (germs) called “Neisseria 
meningitidis”, specifically against types A, C, W and Y.  
Neisseria meningitidis bacteria (also called meningococci) can be passed from person to person and can 
cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections, such as:  
 
 
Both infections can result in serious disease with long lasting effects or possibly death.  
Meningitis – an inflammation of the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord; 
Septicaemia – an infection of the blood.  
MenQuadfi should be used in accordance with official national guidelines. 
How the vaccine works 
MenQuadfi works by stimulating the vaccinated person natural defence (immune system), to produce 
protective antibodies against the bacteria. 
MenQuadfi only helps to protect against illnesses caused by Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W and Y.  
 
 
It does not protect against infections caused by other types of Neisseria meningitidis. 
It does not protect against meningitis or septicaemia caused by other bacteria or viruses.  
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given MenQuadfi 
Do not have MenQuadfi if you or your child  
 
are allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in 
section 6) or have experienced a previous allergic reaction to this vaccine.  
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you or your child are given 
MenQuadfi. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before vaccination with MenQuadfi if you or your child have: 
 
an infection with high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies, the vaccination will be given after 
the infection is under control. There is no need to delay vaccination for a minor infection such as a 
cold. However, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse first. 
a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
ever fainted from an injection. Fainting, sometimes accompanied by falling, can occur (mostly in 
adolescents) after, or even before, any injection. 
a weak immune system (such as due to HIV infection, other disease, or use of a medicine that 
affect the immune system), as you or your child may not fully benefit from having MenQuadfi. 
 
 
 
If any of the above apply to you or your child (or you are not sure whether they apply), talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you or your child are given MenQuadfi. 
As with any vaccine, MenQuadfi may not fully protect all the people who are vaccinated.  
Other medicines and MenQuadfi 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you or your child are taking, have recently taken or might take 
any other vaccines or medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you or your child are taking any medicines that 
affect your immune system, such as:  
high-dose corticosteroids  
 
chemotherapy  
 
MenQuadfi may be given at the same time as other vaccines at a separate injection site during the same 
visit. These include measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus 
influenzae type b, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, human papillomavirus and Neisseria meningitidis type B 
vaccines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant, breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before receiving MenQuadfi. 
Driving and using machines  
MenQuadfi is not likely to affect your ability to drive, cycle or use machines. However, do not drive, 
cycle or use any machines if you are not feeling well. 
MenQuadfi contains sodium  
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, this means that it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How MenQuadfi is given 
MenQuadfi is given by a doctor or nurse as a 0.5 ml injection in the muscle. It is given in the upper arm 
or in the thigh depending on the age and how much muscle you or your child have.  
4.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Chronic heart failure (HF) is a progressive syndrome characterised by the inability of the heart to provide 
adequate blood supply to meet the metabolic demand of different tissues, or the heart can only provide 
adequate blood supply at the expense of elevated left ventricular filling pressure. HF occurs due to failure 
of the heart to pump adequately (systolic dysfunction) and/or impaired relaxation (diastolic dysfunction).  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The claimed indication that is under assessment reads as follows (in bold the proposed extension of the 
indication): 
Heart failure 
Jardiance is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure independent of left 
ventricular with reduced ejection fraction.  
In the first assessment round, the CHMP concluded that the wording of the indication should be adjusted. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 9/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As  the  indication  for  the  treatment  of  heart  failure  is  for  all  types  of  heart  failure,  the  wording  “for  the 
treatment  of  symptomatic  chronic  heart  failure”  was  considered  more  appropriate.  In  the  response,  the 
Applicant has adjusted the wording of the indication in accordance with the comments. 
The approved indication reads as follows (in strikethrough the proposed extension of the indication):  
Heart failure 
Jardiance is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction.  
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Worldwide, heart failure has a prevalence of 1% to 2% and affects over 64 million people as of 2017. In 
the US alone the prevalence is 6.2 million, and this number has been projected to grow to over 8 million 
by 2030. HF is associated with premature mortality and frequent hospitalisations. HF contributes to 1 in 9 
deaths,  and  the  estimated  5-year  survival  is  about  50%  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  In  addition,  HF  is  the 
leading cause of hospitalisation in patients above 65 years of age. In the US, more than 1 million patients 
annually are hospitalised with a primary diagnosis of HF. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Symptoms of HF include dyspnoea (shortness of breath), oedema (build-up of fluid in the body tissues), 
persistent  coughing  and  wheezing  (due  to  build-up  of  fluid  in  the  lungs),  tiredness  or  fatigue,  reduced 
appetite  or  nausea,  confusion,  disorientation,  and  increased  heart  rate.  The  most  commonly  used 
classification system, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification, places patients in 
one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity. The classes range from 
I, i.e. no limitation of physical activity, to IV, i.e. unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. 
Patients with HF are categorised according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); patients with LVEF 
≤40% are considered to have HFrEF, and those with LVEF >50% are considered to have HFpEF. LVEF of 
>40% to <50% is considered as HFpEF in many clinical trials and registries, although more recently, the 
term  HF  with  “mid-range”  EF  (HFmEF)  was  introduced  to  categorise  this  group  separately.  The  relative 
prevalence of HFpEF among HF patients is approximately 50% and appears to be increasing. 
HFrEF and HFpEF differ in several aspects, including underlying aetiologies, demographics, co-morbidities, 
and responses to treatment. For example, patients with HFpEF tend to be older, more often women, and 
more likely to have a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation than patients with HFrEF. In addition, 
although  HFpEF  and  HFrEF  have  similarly  profound  impacts  on  patient  quality  of  life  and  prognosis, 
historically, therapies shown to improve prognosis in patients with HFrEF do  not seem to be effective in 
patients with HFpEF. 
In addition to a substantial risk of mortality and hospitalisation, HF is shown to have a major impact on all 
aspects of quality of life, and particularly on patients’ mobility and usual activities. Poor quality of life scores 
independently predicts higher mortality and hospitalisation. Despite guideline-directed medical therapy, the 
quality of life in patients with HF remains greatly impaired. 
Management 
Heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction can be treated with drugs that attenuate the overactivation 
of  endogenous  neurohormonal  systems.  However,  the  therapeutic options  for  patients  with  heart  failure 
and a preserved ejection fraction are limited. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 10/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Recommendations for the treatment of HFrEF include the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEi),  angiotensin  receptor  blockers  (ARB),  angiotensin  receptor-neprilysin  inhibitors  (ARNi),  beta-
blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and the use of implantable devices like ICD and 
CRT, all of which have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF.  
For patients with HFpEF, no therapy has been proven to be superior to control based on the pre-specified 
primary endpoint in any prior pivotal clinical outcome study in patients with HFpEF. According to the current 
guidelines, the management of HFpEF involves controlling congestive symptoms, usually with diuretics, and 
treating co-morbidities. A lack of therapeutic options that can reduce the risk of mortality and hospitalisation 
in these patients represents an unmet medical need. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Empagliflozin  (Jardiance)  is  an  orally  administered,  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  the  human  sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2) developed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). By inhibition of SGLT 2 in the 
kidneys,  empagliflozin  reduces  the  reabsorption  of  glucose  by  the  kidneys  leading  to  increased  urinary 
glucose  excretion  and,  consequently,  to  a  lowering  of  blood  glucose.  Empagliflozin  is  approved  for  the 
treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  worldwide  as  an  adjunct  therapy  to  diet  and  exercise  to 
improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. In the United States and several other countries, 
it is also approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in patients with T2DM and established 
CV disease. The results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial 
in  Type  2  Diabetes  Mellitus  Patients)  showed  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  composite 
cardiovascular  outcome  (MACE-3)  and  significant  reductions  in  cardiovascular  death,  hospitalization  for 
heart  failure  (HHF)  as  well  as  death  from  any  cause  as  compared  to  standard  of  care.  These  beneficial 
cardiovascular effects were found to be largely independent of the glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin. 
On  17  Jun  2021,  empagliflozin  was  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  heart  failure  with  reduced 
ejection fraction based on the EMPEROR-Reduced study (1245.121) results. 
Empagliflozin  exerts  its  effect  by  preventing  sodium  and  glucose  reabsorption.  While  natriuresis  will  be 
compensated within days of drug administration through changes in tubulo-glomerular feedback, glucosuria 
will last for as long as the medication is used. This leads to long-lasting hemodynamic changes associated 
with modest osmotic diuresis, blood pressure-lowering effect, improvement in arterial stiffness, reduction 
in  oxidative  stress,  and  decrease  in  rate  pressure  product,  an  indirect  measure  of  myocardial  oxygen 
demands, with no increase in HR and no effect on sympathetic nerve activity. Therefore, the non-glycosuric 
physiological  and  hemodynamic  adaptations  under  empagliflozin  may  benefit  patients  with  HF  with  or 
without diabetes. 
Based  on  the  results  of  trial  1245.25  (EMPA-REG  OUTCOME)  in  patients  with  T2DM  and  established  CV 
disease,  BI  initiated  a  phase  III  program  for  empagliflozin  10  mg  once  daily  in  chronic  heart  failure 
regardless of diabetes status. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The development programme 
BI initiated a Phase III program for empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in chronic heart failure regardless of 
diabetes status. There are two CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR”), two functional capacity trials (“EMPERIAL”), 
and a mechanistic Phase III trial (“EMPA-VISION”) in patients with HFrEF (reduced ejection fraction) and 
HFpEF (preserved ejection fraction). All 5 trials are placebo-controlled, randomised (empagliflozin 10 mg

to placebo 1:1), double-blind, and parallel-group by design. 
The  EMPEROR  trials  are  pivotal  outcome  trials  that  investigate  the  long-term  effect  of  empagliflozin  in 
reducing the risk of hospitalisation for HF and of cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure. The 
EMPERIAL trials are additional trials that investigated the short-term (12 weeks) effect of empagliflozin on 
functional  capacity,  signs and  symptoms  of  heart  failure,  and  quality  of  life.  The  EMPA-VISION  trial is  a 
supporting  trial  investigating  the  short-term  (12  weeks)  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  mechanistic  cardiac 
physiology and metabolism. All 5 trials have been completed and the clinical trial reports are available.  
The EMPEROR-Reduced and the EMPERIAL trials have been previously submitted. The EMPEROR-Preserved 
trial results are described in this document. In addition, a meta-analysis of both EMPEROR trials for efficacy 
endpoints was prespecified. 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
The most relevant CHMP guideline is “Clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of chronic 
heart failure” (CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2). The compliance with this guideline is addressed in the discussion 
of the design of the trial.  
Scientific advice 
The Applicant requested scientific advice for both the EMPEROR-preserved and EMPEROR-reduced trial in 
procedure in 2016, Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2969/2/2016/II. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
GLP 
Not applicable 
GCP 
According to the Applicant, the trials are carried out in compliance with the CTP, in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the ICH GCP, and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and BI’s standard operating procedures. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Empagliflozin is approved in many countries globally as an adjunct therapy to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. 
In  the  EMPA-REG  OUTCOME  trial  (Empagliflozin  Cardiovascular  Outcome  Event  Trial  in  Type  2  Diabetes 
Mellitus  Patients),  empagliflozin  significantly  improved  the  primary  composite  cardiovascular  outcome 
(MACE-3: composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction (excluding silent 
myocardial infarction), or nonfatal stroke) and significantly reduced cardiovascular death, hospitalization 
for heart failure (HHF) as well as death from any cause as compared to standard of care. In the EMPEROR-
Reduced trial, empagliflozin significantly improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with heart

failure  with  reduced  ejection  fraction,  independent  of  baseline  diabetes  status.  Interestingly,  these 
beneficial  cardiovascular  effects  were  found  to  be  largely  independent  of  the  glucose-lowering  effect  of 
empagliflozin. 
The beneficial cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin in clinical studies may result – at least in part - from 
an  influence  on  neurohumoral  pathways,  such  as  RAAS  inhibition  via  tubulo-glomerular  feedback 
mechanisms and from a reduction of cardiac pre- and afterload by natriuretic and osmotic effects. Further, 
an  increased haematocrit,  decrease  in  blood  pressure  and  cardiac  sympathetic  nerve  activity  have  been 
observed with empagliflozin and may contribute to the effects on the cardiovascular system. 
Effects  of  empagliflozin  on  pathophysiological  processes  in  the  cardiovascular  system  were  studied  in 
various pharmacological experimental settings, in particular in models of heart failure induced by different 
stimuli. Furthermore, effects of empagliflozin were studied in vitro in cardiac tissue of patients with HFpEF, 
respectively, as well as in tissues taken from mice. 
In vivo studies were performed in different species like mice, rats and pigs in order to reproduce aspects 
of the beneficial results of the clinical studies and to better understand the mode of action of empagliflozin 
on the cardiovascular system. Importantly, studies were done in normoglycemic animals and in animals 
with pre-existing diabetes. 
This  document  is  an  Addendum  to  the  Nonclinical  Overview  [U12-3933-01]  submitted  with  the  initial 
Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). Since the initial MAA, three nonclinical study reports with the 
corresponding Addendum to Nonclinical Overview were submitted to provide: 
- results of a nonclinical study looking at the effect of empagliflozin on blood ketone level at refeeding after 
a fasting period and comparison between refeeding with glucose or fat [n00253114-01] 
-  results  of  an  in  vitro  study  investigating  the  inhibition  of  UGT2B7,  UGT1A3,  UGT1A8,  and  UGT1A9  by 
empagliflozin [n00234868-01] 
- results from a nonclinical juvenile toxicity study in the rat [n00231757-01]. 
Empagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor that reduces the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney resulting in the 
increased  urinary  glucose  excretion  and  subsequent  lowering  of  the  blood  glucose.  Empagliflozin  also 
showed beneficial cardiovascular effects in the clinical trials with patients with heart failure, which appear 
to be independent of its glycaemic control action. Empagliflozin is currently approved for the treatment of 
patients  with  heart  failure  with  reduced  ejection  fraction  (HFrEF).  The  current  application  concerns  the 
extension of the indication to the patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The 
applicant  has  submitted  an  addendum  (dated  29  July  2021)  to  the  previously  provided  non-clinical 
overview,  including  the  pre-clinical  studies  conducted  to  investigate  the  cardiovascular  effects  of 
empagliflozin in vitro in vivo, to provide the rationale for the envisaged extension. As the clinical effects 
were shown to be independent of the well-documented glucose-lowering effects of empagliflozin, the pre-
clinical studies were performed in normoglycaemic animals as well as in animals with pre-existing diabetes 
mellitus.  The  addendum  was  prepared  by  Dr.  Michael  Paul  Pieper  and  consists  of  17  pages  with  23 
references. The CV of Dr. Pieper has been provided. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the human sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2). By 
inhibition of SGLT 2 in the proximal tubules empagliflozin reduces the reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys

leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and, in consequence, to a lowering of blood glucose under 
hyperglycaemic as well as normoglycemic conditions. 
The results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial as well as the EMPEROR-Reduced trial clearly demonstrated 
the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the cardiovascular system. 
In this section, pre-clinical studies are compiled that investigated the cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin 
in vitro and in vivo in various species and different experimental settings. As the clinical effects were shown 
to be independent of the well-documented glucose-lowering effects of empagliflozin, the pre-clinical studies 
were performed in normoglycemic animals as well as in animals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus. 
Effects of empagliflozin in vitro/ex vivo 
Potential direct effects of 500 nmol/L empagliflozin on myocardial tissue were investigated in LV myocardial 
biopsies obtained from patients with HFpEF and compared to samples from non-failing hearts [P20-04305]. 
Inflammation  markers  including  ICAM-1,  VCAM-1,  TNF-a,  and  IL-6  were  higher  in  human  HFpEF 
myocardium than controls. Empagliflozin significantly reduced the inflammatory markers assessed both by 
ELISA  and  immunoblots.  Empagliflozin  lowered  the  pathophysiologically  increased  cardiomyocyte  Ca2+-
independent passive force (Fpassive), a measure for cardiomyocyte stiffness, in cardiomyocytes from patients 
with  HFpEF  in  vitro.  GSH  administration  resulted  in  a  further  additional  effect  on  Fpassive.  In  contrast, 
empagliflozin did not induce additional effects on Fpassive on top of GSH indicating an antioxidative effect of 
empagliflozin in cardiomyocytes. 
Experiments were performed in murine papillary muscles from diabetic BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J mice 
showing a typical diabetic cardiomyopathy phenotype [P18-09844]. Empagliflozin significantly reduced the 
excessive diastolic tension by 
19.1 % in these isolated organs in vitro. This effect was reversible upon 
wash-out. 
∼
Thus, empagliflozin caused direct effects on the myocardium of patients with HFpEF and similar effects in 
mice  with  diabetic  cardiomyopathy  by  improving  diastolic  stiffness  that  may  translate  in  an  improved 
diastolic  function.  Furthermore,  empagliflozin  reduced  myocardial  inflammation  and  oxidative  stress  in 
cardiomyocytes from patients with HFpEF compared to tissue from non-failing hearts. 
Effects  of  empagliflozin  on  endothelial  dysfunction  and  cardiac  remodelling  were  tested  in  obese  Zucker 
diabetic fatty/spontaneously hypertensive heart failure F1 hybrid (ZSF1)-HFpEF rats, experimentally used 
as a model of metabolic syndrome. Rats develop a dysfunction in endothelium-dependent relaxations and 
cardiac remodelling. Lean rats were used as controls [P20-01824]. Rats were treated with empagliflozin via 
a  diet  admixture  at  a  daily  dose  of  30  mg/kg  for  6  weeks.  Ex  vivo,  empagliflozin  restored  the  normal 
endothelium-dependent  relaxations  and  blunted  endothelium-dependent  contractile  responses  to 
acetylcholine.  Further,  empagliflozin  reduced  the  increased  heart  weight  as  well  as  the  increased  left 
ventricle volume in ZSF1 rats. Interestingly, SGLT2 protein expression was detected in vascular endothelial 
cells under stress conditions in this model. 
Effects of empagliflozin in animals with diabetes: 
Effects  of  empagliflozin  on  diabetic  cardiovascular  injury  was  tested  in  male  db/db  mice  and  male 
nondiabetic and lean db/m mice as control [P14-15469]. Mice were fed a standard diet containing 0.03% 
empagliflozin for 10 weeks. Empagliflozin significantly ameliorated cardiac interstitial fibrosis, peri-coronary 
arterial  fibrosis,  coronary  arterial  thickening,  cardiac  interstitial  macrophage  infiltration,  and  cardiac 
superoxide levels in db/db mice. Further, empagliflozin significantly ameliorated the impairment of vascular 
endothelial function compared with control db/db mice. 
In summary, empagliflozin ameliorated cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, coronary arterial remodelling, and 
vascular dysfunction in db/db diabetic mice.

Effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular function was tested in db/db mice on a high fat diet as a model 
of severe type 2 diabetes [P20-03987]. Mice were fed a high fat western-type diet (high fat diet (HFD), 39 
kJ% fat, 41 kJ% carbohydrates and 20 kJ% protein) with or without 150 mg/kg empagliflozin. Empagliflozin 
induced  glycosuria  and  reduced  blood  glucose  levels.  The  increased  expression  of  hepatic  inflammatory 
cytokines  in  db/db  mice  was  significantly  reduced  by  empagliflozin  treatment.  Empagliflozin  reduced 
mortality in db/db mice: while 54 % of db/db mice on HFD died after 4.5 weeks, all heterogeneous wild 
type mice as well as all empagliflozin-treated db/db mice on HFD were alive. Hemodynamic investigations 
revealed  that  empagliflozin  significantly  improved  cardiac  relaxation  as  an  indicator  of  diastolic  function 
while numerically affecting systolic left ventricular function. Heart rate was unaffected by empagliflozin. No 
change in ketone bodies or branched-chain amino acids were observed in this study. 
In summary, empagliflozin improved diastolic cardiac function and reduced mortality in db/db mice on a 
high fat diet. 
Effects of empagliflozin on myocardial oxidative stress and fibrosis were tested in the genetic type 2 diabetic 
KK-Ay  mouse  model  [P19-01258].  Levels  of  blood  glucose  levels  as  well  as  HbA1c  levels  in  mice  were 
significantly decreased by empagliflozin after 8 weeks of treatment. After 8 weeks of HFD, the LV mass/body 
weight ratio in mice with diabetes mellitus (DM) was significantly lower than that in control and diabetic 
mice  treated  with  empagliflozin  (DM+EM).  Empagliflozin  treatment  largely  restored  the  ejection  fraction 
(EF), the fractional shortening (FS), the fractional area change (FAC), and the ratio between early (E)-to-
late (A) diastolic mitral inflow (E/A ratio) in DM mice, which were similar to those in the control group. LV 
mass  was  decreased  in  all  of  the  diabetic  groups  compared  with  the  control  group.  However,  the  LV 
mass/body  weight  ratio  in  DM  mice  was  significantly  lower  than  that  in  control  and  DM  +  EM  mice. 
Empagliflozin inhibited the reduction of left ventricular internal dimension in diastole (LVIDd) and decreased 
interventricular  septum  thickness  in  diastole  (IVSd)  as  compared  to  the  control  group.  There  were, 
however, no significant differences in the values of left ventricular internal dimension in systole (LVIDs) 
and  interventricular  septum  thickness  in  systole  (IVSs)  among  the  three  groups.  In  the  DM  group,  lipid 
hydroperoxide concentration and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were significantly higher than in control and 
DM + EM groups treated with empagliflozin. Furthermore, decreased levels of the antioxidant enzymes SOD 
and GSHPx were restored by empagliflozin. Thus, empagliflozin almost completely inhibited the increase in 
MDA that is considered a biomarker of oxidative stress. 
DM mice showed a massive accumulation of extracellular matrix and myocardial fibrosis demonstrated by 
histology using Masson’s trichrome staining as well as immunohistochemistry. Empagliflozin inhibited the 
increase in TGF-ß1-, collagen type I-, collagen type III- and connective tissue fraction- positive areas as 
compared to DM mice significantly. 
Thus, empagliflozin inhibited LV dysfunction and remodelling and inhibited myocardial fibrosis and oxidative 
stress in the type 2 diabetic KK-Ay mice model. 
Echocardiography in obese diabetic rats (ZDF) revealed a mild diastolic dysfunction (HFpEF) in comparison 
to their lean controls [P18-09844]. A prolonged isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), reduced E/A ratio and 
mild cardiac hypertrophy (increased wall thickness) was observed in the diseased rats. Empagliflozin after 
intravenous injection of 0,25 mg/kg significantly shortened IVRT (to 27.0±3.6 ms) and increased E/A ratio 
(to 1.6±0.4), indicating an improved diastolic function. The systolic contractile function as measured by 
ejection fraction was not altered. Further, the microvascular inflammation was reduced by empagliflozin in 
ZDF rats [P20-04305]. Empagliflozin reduced markers for oxidative stress, namely H2O2, 3-nitrotyrosine, 
and lipid peroxide and restored the antioxidant GSH to control levels. The NO–sGC–cGMP–PKG pathway 
was restored as well. 
In summary, empagliflozin improved functional parameters of heart failure, induced anti-inflammatory as 
well as anti-oxidative effects and restored the NO bioavailability in vivo.

Cardiac energy deficiency is characterized by a decreased cardiac phosphocreatinine-to–ATP ratio (PCr/ATP) 
and has been proposed to play a major role in the development of heart failure. Male diabetic C57BL/Ks 
db/db mice received a single oral dose of empagliflozin (30 mg/kg) after 4 hours of fasting [P18-09761]. 
After  further  2  hours  of  fasting  plasma  glucose  and  ketone  levels  (ß-hydroxybutyrate)  were  measured. 
Thereafter in vivo cardiac PCr/ATP and function were measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS)  and  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  respectively.  Empagliflozin  lowered  plasma  glucose  and 
increased plasma ketone levels compared to placebo-treated mice. Cardiac PCr/ATP ratio was 45% higher 
in empagliflozin-treated mice compared to placebo. Empagliflozin reduced this ratio to a value measured in 
nondiabetic db/+ mice in a separate study. The cardiac PCr/ATP ratio correlated with plasma ketone but 
not with plasma glucose levels. Empagliflozin-treated mice showed a lower end-diastolic and stroke volume 
compared with placebo, whereas ejection fraction and end-systolic volume were not significantly affected. 
In summary, the increase in plasma ketone levels by a single oral dose of empagliflozin is associated with 
an improvement of cardiac energetics and cardiac function in fasting diabetic db/db mice, suggesting a role 
for ketones in the energy supply in cardiometabolic health. 
Effects of empagliflozin in animals without diabetes: 
As clinical studies indicate that empagliflozin exerts beneficial cardiovascular effects independently of the 
glucose-lowering  effects,  pre-clinical  pharmacological  studies  in  HF  models  were  performed  in  animals 
without diabetes mellitus. 
There are multiple ways to induce heart failure in pre-clinical experimental settings, e.g. HF secondary to 
myocardial infarction  (MI)  induced by  ischemia-reperfusion  or  ligation/occlusion  of  coronary  arteries,  HF 
induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and by injections of the anti-cancer compound doxorubicin 
all of them demonstrating aspects of the human heart failure pathophysiology. 
Doxorubicin is a marketed drug for the treatment of different types of cancer. A serious, well-known side 
effect of doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. Thus, Doxorubicin is 
experimentally  used  to  induce  cardiomyopathy  in  different  animal  models.  Doxorubicin-induced 
cardiotoxicity  is  characterized  by  left  ventricular  dysfunction  and  cardiac  hypertrophy,  which  lead  to 
congestive HF. In vivo experiments were performed after a single administration of doxorubicin as well as 
after  repeated  administration  for  12  days  [P19-10933].  In  both  settings,  mice  were  randomized  into  4 
groups,  each:  Control  group,  empagliflozin-treated  group,  control  group  +  doxorubicin,  empagliflozin-
treated group + doxorubicin. For compound administration, mice were fed a normal chow diet containing 
300 mg/kg empagliflozin. Empagliflozin reduced doxorubicin-induced myocardial fibrosis in mouse hearts 
as histologically demonstrated by Masson’s trichrome staining in both acute and chronic settings.  Mouse 
hearts  showed  hypertrophic  changes  after  12  days  of  doxorubicin  treatment.  Empagliflozin  significantly 
improved ejection fraction, reduced fractional shortening, left ventricular diastolic and systolic dimension 
and  significantly  reduced  LV  mass  compared  with  the  sham-treated  doxorubicin  group.  Serum  levels  of 
ketone bodies, namely ß-hydroxybutyrate (ßOHB), were significantly elevated in empagliflozin-treated mice 
with or without single doxorubicin injection. 
In order to investigate the effects of ketones (ßOHB), H9C2 cardiac myocytes were treated with ßOHB at 
concentrations  of  100  μM,  1  mM,  10  mM  and  30  mM in  vitro  and  exposed  to  5  μM  doxorubicin.  The 
doxorubicin increased ROS production in H9C2 cells was significantly decreased by pretreatment with ßOHB 
for  2  hours.  Further,  ßOHB  restored  the  doxorubicin-induced  decrease  of  tetramethylrhodamine  methyl 
ester  (TMRM).  This  result  suggests  that  ßOHB  protects  cardiomyocytes  from  doxorubicin-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, ßOHB significantly increased intracellular levels of ATP in H9C2 cardiac 
myocytes.

Effects of ßOHB were thereafter tested in vivo in single-dose doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. 
ßOHB preserved myofibril structure and reduced cardiac fibrosis in the left ventricles of mice exposed to 
doxorubicin. 
In summary, empagliflozin attenuated doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in mice. Doxorubicin-induced 
cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis was reduced in empagliflozin diet-fed mice in the acute and 
chronic setting. Empagliflozin increased serum levels of ketone bodies. Ketone bodies were shown to induce 
cardioprotective  effects.  Thus,  this  study  provides  evidence  that  increased  levels  of  ketone  bodies  may 
mediate these beneficial effects of empagliflozin. 
Effects of empagliflozin on left ventricular dysfunction were tested in non-diabetic male Sprague–Dawley 
rats with myocardial infarction (MI) induced by permanent coronary artery ligation. Control rats underwent 
sham surgery [P19-03653]. Rats received a chow containing empagliflozin resulting in an average intake 
of 30 mg/kg/day or a control chow. Treatment started either 2 days before (early) or 2 weeks after surgery 
(late). Rats were stratified according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 2  weeks post-surgery to 
ensure similar baseline cardiac function between the groups. The average infarct size in the left ventricle 
was 33 % and did not differ between the MI groups. MI induced a significant dilatation of the left ventricle 
and a reduction in LVEF. LVEF was  significantly higher in both empagliflozin early and empagliflozin late 
group  as  compared  to  the  respective  sham-treated  MI  groups.  Thus,  empagliflozin  prevented  the 
progressive deterioration of cardiac function after MI. After MI, a marked cardiac hypertrophy was observed 
with  a  10  %  increase  in  ventricular  mass  and  an  81  %  increase  in  cardiomyocyte  cross-sectional  area. 
Empagliflozin attenuated the increase in LV mass both after early and late treatment and diminished the 
cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area compared to the sham-treated MI group. 
The  three-fold  increase  in  myocardial  fibrosis  in  the  non-infarcted  left  ventricle  was  also  markedly 
attenuated  by  empagliflozin  treatment.  Empagliflozin-induced  reductions  in  fibrosis  were  paralleled  by 
similar reductions in the expression of the fibrosis markers collagen 1 and pro-collagen. 
Empagliflozin  restored  mitochondrial  DNA  (mtDNA)  damage,  increased  mtDNA/nuclear  DNA  ratio  and 
restored PGC1-αα expression, a critical mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis, indicating an attenuation of 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Cardiac ATP levels were significantly reduced in the MI-vehicle group and were 
significantly restored in the MI-EMPA-early group, and there was a trend towards increased ATP levels in 
the MI-EMPA-late group. 
While the glucose and fatty acid oxidation is disrupted in the failing heart, ketone bodies are increasingly 
utilized as a fuel source. Empagliflozin increased circulating ketone levels and urinary ketone excretion in 
sham  and  MI  groups.  In  parallel,  ketone  utilization  was  increased  by  empagliflozin  as  measured  by 
expression of proteins involved in myocardial ketolysis: Ketone body transporter (MCT1), ketogenic enzyme 
ββ-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) and succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT). 
In  summary,  empagliflozin  improved  cardiac  function  and  remodelling  in  non-diabetic  rats  with  LV 
dysfunction after MI. This effect was associated with substantial improvements in cardiac energy production 
measured as increased ATP levels. 
Heart failure was induced in nondiabetic, female Yorkshire pigs by 2-h balloon occlusion of the proximal left 
anterior descending (LAD) artery followed by reperfusion [P19-03216]. Myocardial damage was confirmed 
by  3-dimensional  (3D)  echocardiography  and  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  (CMR).  Animals  were  then 
randomized to receive either 10 mg empagliflozin daily orally or placebo for 2 months. After this treatment 
period,  3D  echo  and  CMR  were  repeated.  Simultaneous  blood  samplings  from  coronary  arteries  and 
coronary sinus were performed to assess myocardial metabolite consumption and to calculate myocardial 
oxygen consumption and myocardial work efficiency. Tissue samples were collected for the assessment of 
myocardial energetics and molecular markers of cardiac metabolism.

Animals in the treatment group showed marked glycosuria demonstrating effective SGLT 2 inhibition in the 
kidneys  of  non-diabetic  pigs.  Empagliflozin  ameliorated  adverse  cardiac  remodelling  and  HF.  In  detail, 
empagliflozin  reduced  LV  end-systolic  and  end-diastolic  volumes  detected  with  CMR  and  3D 
echocardiography.  Further,  mean  LV  mass  measured  by  both  CMR  and  direct  weight  immediately  after 
necropsy  and  the  3D-sphericity  index  were  significantly  lower  in  the  empagliflozin-treated  animals 
compared to the control group. Two months post-MI, control animals showed a myocardial metabolic switch 
characterized  by  marked  reduction  in  FFA  and  enhanced  glucose  consumption  compared  to  the  non-MI 
group.  Glucose  was  mainly  metabolized  through  anaerobic  metabolism,  as  confirmed  by  increased  net 
myocardial  lactate  production.  Empagliflozin  modified  the  cardiac  energy  metabolism  by  switching  away 
from  glucose  towards  ketone  bodies  and  free  fatty  acids  as  a  source  of  energy.  Empagliflozin-treated 
animals  exhibited  higher  myocardial  ATP  (adenosine  triphosphate)  content.  In  summary,  empagliflozin 
improved LV systolic and diastolic function and ameliorated adverse LV remodelling. This effect is likely to 
be - at least in part - mediated by switching the energy metabolism towards ketone bodies and free fatty 
acids, thus improving cardiac energy supply in pigs with heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction. 
Empagliflozin is a SGLT2 (sodium-glucose transport protein 2) inhibitor that reduces the reabsorption of 
glucose by the kidney resulting in increased urinary glucose excretion and subsequent lowering of the blood 
glucose.  Empagliflozin  also  showed  beneficial  cardiovascular  effects  in  patients  with  heart  failure,  which 
appear to be independent of its glycaemic control action. The pharmacological mechanism of this effect is, 
however,  not  completely  elucidated.  In  order  to  justify  the  proposed  extension  of  the  indication  to  the 
patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) the applicant has provided an addendum 
to  the  previously  provided  nonclinical overview,  consisting  of  public  literature data  that  investigated  the 
effects  of  empagliflozin  on  the  cardiac  function  in  myocardial  samples  of  HFpEF  patients,  as  well  as  in 
various pharmacological models of heart failure in different species (mice, rats and pigs). The investigations 
included both normoglycemic animals and animals with pre-existing diabetes. 
SGLT2  inhibitors  reduce  blood  glucose  concentrations  by  inhibiting  the  main  glucose  transporter  on  the 
luminal surface of the proximal tubule in the kidneys, thus increasing urinary glucose excretion. The process 
works  as  a  co-transport  of  glucose  molecules  and  sodium  ions  (ratio  1:1),  resulting  in  an  increased 
concentration of sodium in the distal tubule and at the macula densa. Regulatory processes at the macula 
densa may influence neurohormonal pathways, such as RAAS inhibition, which together with a reduction of 
cardiac pre- and afterload by natriuretic and osmotic effects, may at least partially explain the beneficial 
cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin observed in clinical studies. 
The  provided  literature  overview  demonstrated  that  in  cardiomyocytes  from  the  LV  myocardial  samples 
obtained from patients with HFpEF empagliflozin was shown to reduce the inflammation markers (ICAM-1, 
VCAM-1,  TNF-α  and  IL-6)  compared  to  the  samples from  non-failing  hearts  and  attenuated  pathological 
oxidative  parameters  (H2O2,  3-nitrotyrosine,  GSH,  lipid  peroxide)  in  the  cardiomyocytal  cytosol  and 
mitochondria’s. The observed effects were explained as being possibly related to the reduced inflammation 
and oxidative stress due to the improved eNOS phosphorylation and NO bioavailability in the myocardium, 
as empagliflozin was demonstrated to increase the NO levels, sGC activity, sGMP concentration and PKGIα 
activity.  Empagliflozin  was  also  shown  to  reduce  cardiomyocyte  stiffness,  measured  as  cardiomyocyte 
Ca2+-independent passive force (Fpassive), in cardiomyocytes from patients with HFpEF and in the treated 
in vivo murine ZDF obese rats, used as a model of HFpEF. In db/db mice on a high fat diet used as a type 
2  diabetes  mellitus  model,  empagliflozin  improved  left  ventricular  function  and  reduced  mortality. 
Empagliflozin also improved functional parameters like ejection fraction, fractional shortening and the ratio 
between early (E)-to-late (A) diastolic mitral inflow (E/A ratio) in the genetic T2DM KK-Ay mouse model. 
In  non-diabetic  animals  empagliflozin  improved  cardiac  function  in  models  of  heart  failure  in 
ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction in pigs, in doxorubicin-induced heart failure in mice and 
in coronary artery ligation-induced heart failure in rats. Further, empagliflozin increased the plasma levels

of ketone bodies, namely ß-hydroxybutyrate, which have been suggested to play a role as an alternative 
fuel for failing hearts with less oxygen consumption compared to glucose oxidation. 
In summary, beneficial cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin have been demonstrated in vitro in cardiac 
tissue of patients with HFpEF, as well as in a number of animal heart disease models, both in normoglycemic 
and in diabetic animals. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the beneficial effects of empagliflozin 
in these in vitro/ex vivo models remains unclear. It could be related to increasing tubuloglomerular feedback 
and reducing intraglomerular pressure lowering both pre- and postload of the heart, and downregulating of 
sympathetic activity. Other contributing mechanisms, such as reduced inflammation and oxidative stress 
and the increased plasma levels of ketone bodies, can also not be excluded. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new information has been provided.  
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
No new information has been provided. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  for  empagliflozin  was  submitted  with  the  initial  MAA  and  an 
updated ERA after the completion of an additional study. The risk assessment resulted in the conclusion 
that no significant impact on the environment is expected. 
In the current ERA, the estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of empagliflozin in 
the various environmental compartments is based on the default market penetration factor (Fpen = 0.01), 
as  provided  in  the  EMA  guideline,  and  the  highest  maximum  daily  dose  of  25  mg.  The  recommended 
maximum  daily  dose  of  the  newly  proposed  indication  (heart  failure  in  patients  with  preserved  ejection 
fraction, HFpEF) will only be 10 mg. 
The  default  Fpen  is  based  on  a  very  conservative  worst-case  estimation,  meaning  that  1%  of  all  EU 
inhabitants are treated 365 d/a with the recommended maximum daily dose. The market penetration factor 
was not refined though, e.g. by using the much smaller actual amount of substance placed on the market. 
Therefore, the effects on the environment by adding the new intended heart failure indication (HFpEF) with 
a much smaller patient group are considered negligible and well covered by the used Fpen.  
In previously submitted procedures, a full ERA of empagliflozin was submitted, including the determination 
of physical-chemical properties, Phase I and, due to the exceeded PECsw threshold limit (of 0.125), also 
the Phase II environmental fate studies. The conclusion of this ERA was that empagliflozin is neither PBT 
nor vPvB, and no unacceptable adverse effects for the surface water, groundwater, STP (sewage treatment 
plant) and sediment are expected from the prescribed use of empagliflozin. According to the MAH, the ERA 
submitted  with  the  initial  MAA  remains  valid  for  the  current  type  II  variation  covering  the  additional 
proposed indication. It is agreed with the MAH that, considering the lower maximum recommended dose, 
the PEC/PNEC ratios for the surface water, groundwater and STP will not increase more than twice and will 
therefore  still  be  below  the  threshold  level  for  Tier  B  (ratios  for  the  single  indication  were  0.00052, 
≤0.0000125 and ≤0.000003125). Still, the MAH was requested to submit an updated ERA table with the 
new PECsurfacewater value. The summary ERA table submitted with the initial MAA was updated with the 
new PECsurfacewater values. The MAH was also requested to amend the ERA table by deleting the data on

Additionally, the MAH was requested to include data on toxicity to sediment dwelling organisms.

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The current application concerns an extension of the indication of Jardiance to patients with heart failure 
with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The active substance empagliflozin is a SGLT2 (sodium glucose 
transport  protein  2)  inhibitor  that  reduces  the  reabsorption  of  glucose  by  the  kidney  resulting  in  the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

increased  urinary  glucose  excretion  and  subsequent  lowering  of  the  blood  glucose.  Empagliflozin  also 
showed beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with heart failure, which appear to be independent of 
its  glycaemic  control  action.  The  pharmacological  mechanism  of  this  effect  is,  however,  not  completely 
elucidated.  The  applicant  has  provided  an  addendum  to  the  previously  submitted  non-clinical  overview 
based on public literature data that demonstrated beneficial cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin in vitro 
in  cardiac  tissue  of  patients  with  HFpEF  and  in  a  number  of  animal  heart  disease  models,  both  in 
normoglycemic  and  in  diabetic  animals.  It  has  been  concluded  that  these  effects  could  be  related  to 
increasing  tubuloglomerular  feedback  and  reducing  intraglomerular  pressure,  lowering  both  pre-  and 
postload of the heart, and downregulating of sympathetic activity. Other contributing mechanisms, such as 
reduced inflammation and oxidative stress and the increased plasma levels of ketone bodies, can also not 
be excluded.   
It  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  ERA  conclusions  based  on  the  previous  ERA  of  empagliflozin  remain 
unchanged. The DT50-values for the total system, sediment and water normalised to 12 °C for empagliflozin 
and the relevant transformation products M3, M1 and M12 are included in the updated ERA as well as the 
proposed molecular structures of M3 and M1. It is also mentioned in the ERA that M3 is proposed to be a 
stereoisomer of the active substance empagliflozin and thus might be pharmacologically active. The MAH 
was however asked to submit an updated ERA table with the new PECsurfacewater value, deletion of the 
data  on  readily  biodegradability  and  addition  of  information  data  on  persistence  derived  in  the 
water/sediment study and data on toxicity to sediment dwelling organisms. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Although several factors have been mentioned that may contribute to the positive actions of empagliflozin 
on  heart  function,  the  precise  molecular  mechanisms  of  these  effects  are  not  clear.  Several  possible 
mechanisms may play a role, such as a reduced sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubules, resulting in 
reduced intraglomerular pressure and lowered cardiac pre- and afterload; increased level of ketone bodies, 
improving cardiac energy supply by increasing cardiac uptake and oxidization of β-hydroxybutyrate. It is 
currently not clear which of the numerous potential mechanisms of action are of clinical relevance or which 
one would be the dominant one. The provided information is endorsed.  
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of empagliflozin.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new information has been provided with regard to basal pharmacokinetics. This is all described in 
previous applications. 
Additionally, pharmacokinetic data from trial 1245.110 was compared with the data from trial 1245.121. 
As a measure of systemic drug exposure to empagliflozin, steady-state trough PK samples were taken in 
the EMPEROR-preserved trial in a subset of patients (overall number of patients with valid PK samples: 
N=519). The PK of empagliflozin in patients with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in 
the EMPEROR-preserved trial was presented. Additionally, pharmacokinetic data from trial 1245.110 was 
compared with the data from trial 1245.121. 
Comparison of PK trial 1245.110 and 1245.121 
After demographic and baseline characteristic stratifications, similar results were observed in patients 
with HFpEF when compared to patients with HFrEF: Empagliflozin exposure in both trials increased with a 
decrease in renal function or an increase in age and decreased with an increase in body weight or BMI. 
There were only minor differences in empagliflozin exposures between trials regarding all further 
demographic or baseline characteristics.  
For all subgroups, the gMean steady state trough concentrations of empagliflozin 10 mg in trial 1245.110 
were similar (0.71 to 1.24-fold) to those of empagliflozin 10 mg in trial 1245.121.

Empagliflozin exposure in trial 1245.110 increased with a decrease in renal function (up to a 3.01-fold 
difference in gMean) or an increase in age (up to a 1.38-fold difference in gMean); This increase in 
exposure is correlated as average renal function decreases with an increase in age. In addition, 
empagliflozin exposure decreased with an increase in body weight (up to a 1.54-fold difference in gMean) 
or BMI (up to a 1.26-fold difference in gMean).  
After demographic and baseline characteristic stratifications, similar results were observed in patients 
with HFpEF compared to patients with HFrEF. In addition, there were no differences (<1.25-fold 
difference in gMean) in empagliflozin exposure by sex, race (comparison Asian versus White or Black 
versus White), NYHA classification, diabetes status or use of ARNi at baseline. 
Differences in empagliflozin exposures were observed among different groups of geographic region (up to 
1.38-fold difference in gMean) or investigator country (up to a 1.44-fold difference in gMean). 
However, when all data from special groups were compared with results from trial 1245.121, the gMean 
steady-state trough concentration of empagliflozin 10 mg was not higher than that of empagliflozin 25 mg 
in any corresponding subgroup in 1245.25 [c32077394]. Since the gMean steady-state trough 
concentrations were similar between 1245.110 and 1245.121 in all subgroups, these data support that 
dose adjustment based on PK is not needed for renal function, age, body weight, BMI, sex, race, smoking 
status, or alcohol use. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
There were no new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies.  
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of sodium-
glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for 
glucose transport into peripheral tissues and is 5000 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the 
major transporter responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in the kidney, 
whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. As the predominant transporter, it is responsible 
for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. In patients with type 
2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia, a higher amount of glucose is filtered and reabsorbed. 
Empagliflozin  improves  glycaemic  control  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  by  reducing  renal  glucose 
reabsorption.  The  amount  of  glucose  removed  by  the  kidney  through  this  glucuronic  mechanism  is 
dependent on blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with type 2 diabetes 
and hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the urine. In addition, initiation of empagliflozin 
increases excretion of sodium, resulting in osmotic diuresis and reduced intravascular volume. 
Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The mechanism of action of 
empagliflozin is independent of beta-cell function and insulin pathway, and this contributes to a low risk of 
hypoglycaemia.  Improvement  of  surrogate  markers  of  beta-cell  function,  including  Homeostasis  Model 
Assessment-β (HOMA-β) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated 
with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied 
by diuresis, which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure. Empagliflozin 
may  impact  on  multiple  pathophysiological  pathways  common  for  both  HFrEF  and  HFpEF.  Empagliflozin 
reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence 
several physiological functions including, but not restricted to: increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and 
reducing  intra-glomerular  pressure,  lowering  both  pre-  and  afterload  of  the  heart,  downregulating 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 25/120 
 
 
 
 
sympathetic activity, and reducing left ventricular wall stress as evidenced by lower NT-proBNP values with 
further beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling, filling pressures and diastolic function.  
The exact molecular mechanisms of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of empagliflozin are, however, 
still under intense pharmacological investigation. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  mode  of  action  and  pharmacodynamics  of  SGLT2i  for  the  treatment  of  T2DM,  in  general,  are  well 
known. For the treatment of HFrEF, modes of action have also been described and discussed in a previous 
application.  For  HFrEF,  it  is  thought  that  SGLT2i  reduce  sodium  reabsorption,  increase  tubuloglomerular 
feedback  and  consequently  lower  both  pre-  and  afterload  of  the  heart  and  downregulating  sympathetic 
activity.  The  Applicant  also  described  mechanisms  of  action  relevant  for  both  HFrEF  and  HFpEF,  e.g. 
reduction in left ventricular wall stress with further beneficial effects on cardiac remodelling, filling pressures 
and diastolic function.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Not applicable. 
Based on the data for the indication of T2DM and HFrEF it is acceptable that no dose-finding study has been 
performed, but it cannot be excluded that a lower dose than 10 mg is effective for the current indication. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
BI initiated a Phase III program for empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in chronic heart failure regardless of 
diabetes status. There are two CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR”), two functional capacity trials (“EMPERIAL”), 
and a mechanistic Phase III trial (“EMPA-VISION”) in patients with HFrEF (reduced ejection fraction) and 
HFpEF (preserved ejection fraction). All 5 trials are placebo-controlled, randomised (empagliflozin 10 mg 
to placebo 1:1), double-blind, and parallel-group by design (Table 2. ). 
The EMPEROR trials are pivotal outcome trials investigating the long-term effect of empagliflozin in reducing 
the risk of hospitalisation for HF and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure. The EMPERIAL trials 
are  additional  trials  that  investigated  the  short-term  (12  weeks)  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  functional 
capacity, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life. The EMPA-VISION trial is a supporting 
trial investigating the short-term (12 weeks) effect of empagliflozin on mechanistic cardiac physiology and 
metabolism. All 5 trials have been completed and the clinical trial reports are available. 
The EMPEROR-Reduced and the EMPERIAL trials have been previously submitted. The EMPEROR-Preserved 
trial results are described in this document, along with a brief summary of EMERIAL and EMPA-VISION and 
the pre-specified meta-analysis of efficacy endpoints based on both EMPEROR trials. Safety assessments in 
this document mainly focuses on pooled results from all 5 trials. 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial 1245.110 (EMPEROR-Preserved), BI sought a new indication for 
empagliflozin in adult patients with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with preserved ejection fraction. 
Where the indication for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction has already been approved 
(which  was  based  on  the  previously  submitted  pivotal  trial  1245.121,  EMPEROR-Reduced),  BI  aims  to

Title of Study: EMPEROR-preserved (1245.110) 
Methods 
Study participants 
Trial 1245.110 was carried out at 622 clinical sites in 23 countries in Europe, Latin America, North America, 
Asia, and other (South Africa, Australia, India). In total, 5988 patients were randomised to double-blind 
empagliflozin 10 mg (2997 patients) or placebo (2991 patients) once daily treatment. Randomisation was 
stratified  by  region,  diabetes  history,  LVEF,  and  eGFR  (CKD-EPI)cr  at  screening.  All  but  3  randomised 
patients (1 in the empagliflozin 10 mg group and 2 in the placebo group) were treated with at least 1 dose 
of study medication. 
Inclusion criteria 
The key eligibility criteria for the EMPEROR-Preserved (1245.110), in comparison with EMPEROR-Reduced 
(1245.121), are shown in Table 3.

Treatments 
Trial 1245.110 is a placebo-controlled, randomised (empagliflozin 10 mg to placebo 1:1), double-blind, and 
parallel-group  by  design.  Patients  were  to  be  treated  with  randomised  study  medication  in  addition  to 
standard of care (in accordance with local/international guidelines) until the required number of patients 
with adjudicated primary endpoint events was expected to be reached. The median observation time of the 
trial was about 26 months, with the median exposure to study medication about 23 months. After the last 
intake of study medication, patients were to be followed up for 30 days.

Design of EMPEROR trials in patients with chronic heart failure 
CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR-Reduced/Preserved”) 
qd,  once  daily;  LVEF,  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction;  6MWT,  6-minute  walk  test;  CMR,  cardiac  magnetic  resonance;  CPET, 
cardiopulmonary exercise test 
Objectives 
The  EMPEROR-Preserved  trial  is  a  pivotal  CV  outcome  trial  that  investigates  the  long-term  effect  of 
empagliflozin  in  reducing  the  risk  of  hospitalisation  for  HF  and  of  cardiovascular  death  in  patients  with 
HFpEF.  The  objective  of  this  event-driven  trial  is  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  empagliflozin  10  mg 
versus  placebo  in  patients  with  symptomatic,  chronic  HF  and  preserved  ejection  fraction  (LVEF  >  40%) 
under stable treatment of HF symptoms.

NT-proBNP, albuminuria, body weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, HbA1c, FPG, etc.  
Sample size 
For the sample size calculation, a yearly event rate in the placebo group of 10% is assumed. The assumption 
is based on the CHARM-Preserved study and part of the TOPCAT study from the Americas. The annual event 
rates in CHARM-Preserved were 8.1% in the candesartan group and 9.1% in the placebo group. The annual 
rates from the Americas in the TOPCAT study were 10.4 in the spironolactone group and 12.6 in the placebo 
group. The trial is designed to achieve a power of 90% for a two-sided test at level α = 0.05. The number 
of  required  events  together  with  the  number  of  to  be  randomised  and  treated  patients  were  calculated 
assuming an accrual period of 18 months and a follow-up period of 20 months. The follow-up period was 
not fixed, but the trial would continue until the necessary number of events has been observed, which are 
confirmed  by  the  adjudication  committee.  A  hazard  ratio  of  0.8  was  chosen  as  a  conservative  estimate 
based on the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial drop-out rate from the trial is assumed to be low (< 
1%  per  year)  and  is  therefore  not  further  considered  for  the  determination  of  sample  size.  An  interim 
analysis  was  performed  by  the  independent  DMC.  The  EMPEROR-preserved  trial  included  5988  subjects 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: 2997 patients, placebo: 2991 patients). 
Randomisation 
Subjects who fulfilled all eligibility criteria were randomized double
blind in a 1:1 manner. Randomisation 
was performed with a permuted block design and was stratified by geographic region, diabetes status, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface 
area or 60 ml or more per minute per 1.73 m2, and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50% or 
‐
50% or more; all measured at screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, Investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in this 
double-blind trial remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after database 
lock. The DMC is provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review efficacy and safety and to 
fulfil their tasks as outlined in the data monitoring committee charter. An independent team, not otherwise 
involved in the conduct of the trial, provided the unblinded results to the DMC. The randomisation code is 
kept secret by Clinical Trial Support up to database lock.

Statistical methods 
The EMPEROR-Preserved (1245.110) trial was designed to have a power of 90% for the primary endpoint 
at two-sided α of 0.05 to detect a hazard ratio of 0.8 between empagliflozin and placebo, which required 
at least 841 adjudicated primary endpoint events. After 494 events (planned approximately 500 events or 
about 60% of anticipated events), an interim analysis was performed by the independent DMC. Based on 
the interim results, the DMC recommended continuing the trial as planned. The α-level for the final analysis 
was 0.0497 (2-sided). A hierarchical procedure (see Figure 2) was applied to the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. If a confirmatory endpoint was successful (i.e. empagliflozin superior to placebo), the α would 
be used for the subsequent step(s). If a confirmatory endpoint was not successful, all subsequent endpoints 
would  be  evaluated  in  an  exploratory  manner.  After  evaluation  of  the  first  key  secondary  endpoint 
(recurrent  HHF),  α  was  to  be  split  into  0.001  (two-sided)  for  the  analysis  of  eGFR  slope,  and  the  rest 
transferred to an efficacy meta-analysis. If the eGFR slope analysis was successful, the α of this branch 
would also be transferred to the meta-analysis.

Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses followed the ITT principle and included all randomised patients 
(RS; treatment assigned as randomised) and all available data up to the planned treatment discontinuation 
(including “off-treatment” data during unplanned treatment interruptions and after premature treatment 
discontinuations). Unless otherwise specified, the outcome events were based on adjudication results from 
the clinical event committee (CEC), according to prespecified definitions in the CEC charter.

Primary endpoint (time to adjudicated CV death or HHF) 
The  primary  analysis  was  a  Cox  regression  with  factors  treatment,  region  (Asia,  Europe,  Latin  America, 
North America, and other), baseline status of DM (diabetic, pre-diabetes, and normal), age (continuous), 
sex, LVEF (continuous), and baseline eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr(continuous). Region, status of DM, LVEF (<50% 
or  ≥ 50%),  and  eGFR  (CKD-EPI)cr  (<60  or  ≥ 60  mL/min/1.73  m ² )  at  screening  are  randomisation 
stratification factors. Following the ITT principle, all data up to the end of the planned treatment period 
(including the data after the end of treatment for patients not completing the treatment period as planned) 
from  all  randomised  patients  were  used.  Patients  without  a  specific  endpoint  event  were  considered 
censored  at  the  last  date  the  patient  was  known  to  be  free  of  the  event  or  at  the  end  of  the  planned 
treatment period, whichever was earlier. Cumulative incidence function curves that account for competing 
risks  (i.e.  non-CV  deaths)  and  Kaplan-Meier  curves  of  time  to  censoring  were  displayed.  The  individual 
components that contributed to the primary endpoint were summarised descriptively. Subgroup analyses 
by predefined demographic and baseline characteristics (e.g. comorbidities, risk factors, and background 
medications) were carried out. 
Key secondary endpoint 1 (adjudicated recurrent HHF) 
The  analysis  for  recurrent  HHF  used  a  joint  frailty  model  that  accounts  for  the  dependence  between 
recurrent HHF and CV death, with the same covariates used for the primary endpoint. All data up to the 
end  of  the  planned  treatment  period  (including  the  data  after  the  end  of  treatment  for  patients  not 
completing the treatment period as planned) from all randomised patients were used. The number of HHF 
events  per  patient  was  summarised  descriptively.  Negative  binomial  models  were  additionally  fitted  for 
recurrent  HHF  events.  The  mean  cumulative  incidence  was  displayed  for  adjudicated  recurrent  HHF. 
Subgroup analyses were carried out. 
Key secondary endpoint 2 (eGFR slope of change from baseline) 
The analysis was a random coefficient model allowing for random intercept and random slope per patient, 
with  the  same  factors  used  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  additional  factors  “time”,  “treatment-by-time 
interaction”, and “baseline eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr-by-time interaction”. Only “on-treatment” data from treated 
patients (i.e. measurements up to 1 day after the last intake of study medication) were used. Subgroup 
analyses were carried out. 
Other secondary and further endpoints (exploratory) 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints were analysed in the following way in general: 
• 
Time-to-event  endpoints:  similar  to  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint.  Subgroup 
analyses were performed for time to CV death and time to first HHF 
•  Recurrent events endpoints: similar to the primary analysis of the first key secondary Endpoint 
•  Continuous endpoints: a mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis 
•  Categorical endpoints: descriptive

About half of the screened patients (48.3%) were not randomised, most commonly because of NT-proBNP 
levels being below protocol-specified thresholds at screening (37.6% of screened patients) (Table 5.) 
Of the 5988 randomised patients, 5816 patients (97.1%) had complete follow-up for the primary endpoint 
and the final vital status was known for 5952 patients (99.4%); see Table 5. Of the 5985 patients treated 
with study medication, 1888 patients prematurely discontinued treatment (31.5%, including patients who 
died).  
The most common reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was an AE (10.6% of patients 
with non-fatal events and 8.2% with fatal events). The next most common reason was refusal to continue 
study medication, which was balanced across the placebo (10.2%) and empagliflozin (9.5%) groups.

1 Patients with primary event (HHF or CV death) or follow-up for the primary endpoint until study end/death. 
2 Including patients from Site no. 1156007 (see [CTR 1245.110, c31803238, Section 9.6]) and closed sites (who did not complete the

trial or die and did not withdraw consent). 
3 Patients not from a closed site who discontinued all trial activities but did not withdraw consent to vital status collection at treatment 
termination. 
4 Other patients with incomplete follow-up for the primary endpoint. 
5 Includes 7 patients from closed sites. 
Patients who discontinued study medication prematurely were to be followed up for outcome events and 
vital status until the end of the trial. Vital status was known for 99.4% of the randomised patients, and 
97.1%  completed  follow  up  for  the  primary  endpoint,  with  balanced  distribution  between  groups.  The 
proportion  of  patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  study  medication  (including  due  to  death)  was 
balanced between the empagliflozin group and the placebo group (both 31.5%), with the most frequent 
reasons to discontinue study medication being adverse events (10.6% of total patients with non-fatal events 
and 8.2% with fatal events) and refusal to continue (9.8%). 
The number of subjects that prematurely discontinued study medication was similar between empagliflozin 
vs placebo.   
Conduct of the study 
The Applicant states that the trials are carried out in compliance with the clinical trial protocol (CTP), in 
accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki,  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  GCP,  and  in 
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and BI’s standard operating procedures. 
Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical visits and study medication supply 
Before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, 5896 patients (98.5%) had been randomised in this trial, and 
92 patients were randomised thereafter. 
Information  on  the  disruption  due  to  COVID-19  to  the  clinical  visits  and  study  medication  supply  was 
collected on the CRF and summarised. About one-third of patients (31.8%) had at least one visit affected 
by COVID-19. The majority of these patients (25.7% overall) had at least one visit performed by phone 
instead of on-site, and 4.6% had at least one visit performed outside the protocol-defined window. A total 
of 1.4% of patients had an interruption of trial medication for more than 7 days due to COVID-19 and 0.8% 
had permanent treatment discontinuation due to COVID-19 infection. 
Baseline data 
Slightly more than half of the patients were men (55.3%). The majority of the patients were White (75.9%) 
and elderly (64.1% of patients were ≥70 years old). See Table 6.  for details.

Baseline characteristics and variables 
Patients with an LVEF of >40% could participate in the trial. The mean LVEF was 54.3%. About a third of 
patients were in each of the predefined LVEF categories (LVEF <50%, 50 to <60%, and ≥60%). Median 
NT-proBNP was 974 pg/mL (Q1, Q3 499, 1731). The majority of patients had SBP <140 mmHg and DBP 
<90 mmHg.  eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73  m2  was 
reported 
for  49.9%  of  patients,  with  eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 reported for 309 patients (5.2%). Normal UACR was reported for 58.0% of patients, 
while 31.1% had microalbuminuria and 10.5% had macroalbuminuria. A history of atrial fibrillation or atrial 
flutter was reported for 52.4% of patients. Half of the patients were reported with type 2 diabetes, and 
10 patients (0.2%) were reported with type 1 diabetes (Table 7. ).

Heart failure-related medical history 
To qualify for this trial, patients had to have chronic HF with preserved ejection fraction as defined in the 
inclusion criteria of the trial protocol.  
Most patients were in NYHA class II (81.5%). About 30% of patients had been diagnosed with HF more 
than 5 years before the trial. The cause of HF was ischaemic for 35.4% of patients and hypertensive for 
36.5% of patients. With regard to conditions met for inclusion into the trial, the majority of patients (77.1%) 
had structural heart disease only, 6.4% of patients had HHF within 12 months of screening only, and 16.4% 
of patients met both of these conditions (Table 8. ).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome, CV death or HHF 
The primary endpoint was the time to the first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated hospitalisation 
for heart failure. 
CV death or HHF occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (415 of 2997 patients, 
13.8%) than in the placebo group (511 of 2991 patients, 17.1%), and the risk of CV death or HHF was 
significantly  reduced  with  empagliflozin  treatment  compared  with  placebo  (HR  empagliflozin  vs  placebo 
0.79; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90, p = 0.0003; Table 13. ).

The separation of the estimated cumulative incidence of CV death or first HHF (considering non-CV death 
as  a  competing  risk)  between  empagliflozin  and  placebo  started  shortly  after  randomisation  and  was 
maintained throughout the trial (0). The cumulative probability for censoring of patients without endpoint 
events was similar between treatment groups. The number of patients with a HHF or CV death during the 
30 days after treatment discontinuation was similar in each treatment arm (empagliflozin: 147 patients, 
5.1%; placebo: 153 patients, 5.3%).

Key secondary outcomes, first and recurrent HHF and eGFR slope 
Key secondary endpoint 1: first and recurrent HHF 
The first key secondary endpoint in the hierarchical testing procedure was the occurrence of adjudicated 
HHF (first and recurrent). 
The primary analysis consisted of a joint frailty model that accounted for the dependence between recurrent 
HHF  and  CV  death  and  was  based  on  all  data  up  to  the  end  of  the  planned  treatment  period  from  all 
randomised patients. 
Adjudicated HHF occurred in fewer patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The total 
number of HHF events (first and recurrent) was also lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo 
group.  The  risk  of  recurrent  HHF  was  significantly  reduced  for  empagliflozin  versus  placebo  (HR  0.73, 
95.03% CI 0.61 to 0.88, p = 0.0009). The hazard of recurrent HHF was positively correlated to that of CV 
death (indicated by a frailty exponent >0). For further information, refer to Table 14.

Key secondary endpoint 2: eGFR slope 
The  second  key  secondary  endpoint  in  the  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was  eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr  slope  of 
change from baseline. The primary analysis was a random coefficient model allowing for random intercept 
and random slope per patient. Only ‘on-treatment’ data (based on TS and using measurements up to 1 day 
after the last intake of study medication) were included.

In the empagliflozin group, there was an initial dip in eGFR [mL/min/1.73 m2] (intercept -3.016, 95% CI -
3.280,  -2.752).  Thereafter,  the  estimated  slope  was  -1.253  per  year  (95% CI  -1.465,  -1.041).  In  the 
placebo group, eGFR declined more steeply over time, with an estimated slope of -2.616 per year (95% CI

than in the placebo group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.363 per year (99.9% CI 0.861, 1.865;

See below for renal outcome endpoints, including sustained eGFR. 
The change of eGFR slope from baseline was a key secondary endpoint and showed a slower decline in 
eGFR in the empagliflozin group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.363 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year 
vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.861 to 1.865; p<0.0001). The Applicant also analysed change form baseline 
using ANCOVA, comparable to the previous application for the HFrEF indication. This will be discussed 
below (Secondary/Exploratory endpoints). 
As discussed above, the effect on the renal composite endpoint is actually preferred for the evaluation of 
renal effects. Results on this endpoint will be discussed below. The effect on slope data should support the 
effect  on  the  renal  composite  endpoint  and  will  be evaluated  in  conjunction.  If  this  confirms  the  overall 
treatment effect on GFR change, the primary analysis model can be reported in section 5.1 of the product 
information;  however,  the  complete  model  should  be  presented,  i.e.  change  in  intercept  and  slope,  to 
inform the prescriber on both the initial dip and subsequent change in slope. 
Mortality endpoints 
Fewer patients were reported with CV death and more patients were reported with non-CV death in the 
empagliflozin  group  than  in  the  placebo  group,  and  the  treatment  differences  were  not  significant.  The 
incidence of all-cause mortality was similar between treatment groups (0). 
A little more than half of all deaths (55% total) were due to CV causes and most of the CV deaths were 
classified  as  sudden  cardiac  death  (empagliflozin:  99  patients,  3.3%;  placebo:  114  patients,  3.8%)  and

heart  failure  death  (empagliflozin:  40  patients,  1.3%;  placebo:  51  patients,  1.7%),  as  expected  in  a 
population with heart failure.

Source data: [CTR 1245.110, c31803238, Section 11.1.2.4] 
All-cause mortality was similar in both treatment groups (HR 1.00, 95%CI 0.87 – 1.15). The number of 
non-CV  death  was  larger  with  empagliflozin,  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
(empagliflozin  203/2997,  placebo  183/2991,  HR  1.13,  95%CI  0.92  –  1.38).  The  Applicant  provided  an 
evaluation of the causes of non-CV death and could not show a specific increase in a cause of death during 
empagliflozin treatment. 
Secondary/Exploratory endpoints 
Other HHF-related endpoints 
Exploratory HHF-related endpoints corroborated the treatment benefit of empagliflozin on reducing the risk 
of first and recurrent HHF (0).

Source data: [CTR 1245.110, c31803238, Sections 11.1.2.1 and 11.1.2.3] 
The HHF results were supported by a higher win ratio for empagliflozin vs placebo (1.25,  95% CI 1.08, 
1.42) when accounting for clinical hierarchies, where CV death was considered more important than HHF. 
In  line  with  the  improvements  in  HF  outcomes,  there  was  a  decrease  in  NT-proBNP  levels  in  the 
empagliflozin  group  compared  with  placebo  (adjusted  gMean  ratio  of  the  relative  change  to  baseline  at 
Week 52 for empagliflozin vs placebo 0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99). 
Hospitalisation endpoints 
The  total  number  of  hospitalisation  events  was  lower  with  empagliflozin  treatment  than  with  placebo. 
Treatment with empagliflozin reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalisations based on the time to the first 
event (0). The treatment effect of empagliflozin started to appear after about 90 days after randomisation 
and was maintained throughout the trial.

Further eGFR analyses 
An  exploratory  MMRM  analysis  of  eGFR  change  from  baseline  including  on-treatment  values  showed  a 
similar trend of slowing of eGFR decline over time, consistent with the results of the slope analysis.  
In  the  empagliflozin  group,  there  was  an  initial  dip  in  eGFR  at  Week  4  of  about  4 mL/min/1.73  m2. 
Thereafter, a slower decrease in the empagliflozin group compared with placebo was observed. Due to the 
initial dip, the slower decrease in eGFR in the empagliflozin group resulted in a higher mean eGFR than in 
the placebo group only after about 148 weeks (Figure 9).

returned towards the baseline level in the empagliflozin group at the follow-up visit, about 30 days after 
treatment stop, while the decrease in eGFR in the placebo group persisted. The placebo-corrected eGFR 
change over the total study duration, i.e. from pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (follow-up visit),

Further renal outcomes 
The composite renal endpoint (chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or sustained reduction in eGFR) occurred 
in similar proportions of patients in both groups. For most patients, the first recorded renal event was a 
sustained reduction in eGFR from a baseline of ≥40% (Table 17. ).

In this trial, 629 patients (10.5%) had macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g), 1860 patients (31.1%) had 
microalbuminuria (30 to ≤300 mg/g), and 3474 patients (58.0%) had normoalbuminuria (<30 mg/g) at 
baseline. There were improvements in the empagliflozin group versus placebo with regard to progression 
to or reversal of macroalbuminuria. Fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (220 of 2666 patients, 8.3%) 
than in the placebo group (267 of 2668 patients, 10.0%) progressed to macroalbuminuria from normo- or 
microalbuminuria at baseline (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68, to 0.98). More patients in the empagliflozin group 
(123  of  318  patients,  38.7%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (96  of  311  patients,  30.9%)  reversed  from 
macroalbuminuria to sustained normo- or microalbuminuria (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06, 1.83). 
An initial dip in eGFR was observed with empagliflozin treatment, followed by a slower decrease in eGFR 
over time. This is in line with other trials performed with SGLT2i. As described above, the key secondary 
renal endpoint was the eGFR slope, but the effect on slope can only be interpreted if seen in conjunction 
with intercept. The applicant, therefore, provided an analysis of change from baseline using ANCOVA. This 
resulted  in  a  larger  of  similar  decrease  in  eGFR  for  empagliflozin  vs  placebo  (change  from  baseline: 
empagliflozin -6.4, placebo -6.0, comparison -0.4 (-1.2, 0.3)). But after the 30 day follow up period after 
treatment  stop,  the  decrease  in  eGFR  was  smaller  for  the  empagliflozin  group  (change  from  baseline: 
empagliflozin -3.3, placebo -5.7, comparison 2.4 (1.6, 3.2)), supporting that the initial dip is reversible.   
As described above, the effect on the renal composite endpoint is preferred to evaluate renal effects. The 
effect  of  empagliflozin  on  the  eGFR  slope  is  not  supported  or  confirmed  by  the  observed  effects  on  the 
composite renal endpoint (i.e. chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or sustained reduction in eGFR), as the 
results are similar for empagliflozin vs. placebo (empagliflozin 108/2997 (3.6%), placebo 112/2991 (3.7%), 
HR 0.95 95%CI 0.73, 1.24). The effect on renal endpoints are therefore not robust. However, the proportion

of  patients  progressing  to  macroalbuminuria  was  less  with  empagliflozin  vs.  placebo,  but  this  is  also  as 
expected from other trials with SGLT2i. 
Patient-reported outcomes measured by KCCQ at Week 52 
The KCCQ comprises 7 domains and 3 summary scores as shown in 0Each patient was also asked to identify 
the domain that was the most difficult to cope with at baseline (patient-preferred outcome). The scores of 
the KCCQ domains and summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better outcome. 
KCCQ individual domains and summary scores 
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  improved  the  KCCQ  clinical  summary  score  (an  exploratory  secondary 
endpoint) from baseline to Week 52 compared with placebo (placebo-corrected adjusted mean change from 
baseline 1.32, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.19; 0). The score was higher at the first post-baseline assessment (Week 
12)  in  the  empagliflozin  group  than  the  placebo  group,  and  the  difference  was  sustained  up  to  the  last 
assessment (Week 52; 0 green box). 
At Week 52, more patients in the empagliflozin group (1126 patients, 41.7%) than in the placebo group 
(1034 patients, 38.7%) showed a clinically meaningful improvement in KCCQ clinical summary score of at 
least 5 points from baseline (odds ratio empagliflozin vs placebo 1.120, 95% CI 0.996, 1.259). Consistently, 
a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (820 patients, 30.3%) than in the placebo group 
(906 patients, 33.9%) showed clinically meaningful deterioration of at least 5 points from baseline (odds 
ratio 0.852, 95% CI 0.759, 0.957).  
The  favourable  effect  of  empagliflozin  vs  placebo  in  clinical  summary  score  was  mainly  driven  by  the 
domains symptom frequency and symptom burden; a positive trend in favour of empagliflozin was observed 
for the third component domain, physical limitation. Supportive analyses of other KCCQ summary scores 
(overall summary score and total symptoms score) were in line with these results (Figure 12 and Figure 
13).

The improvement in HF symptoms was in line with the HF clinical outcome results and consistent with the 
observed  improvements  in  NYHA  class  with  empagliflozin treatment.    More  patients  in  the  empagliflozin 
group (609 patients, 22.6%) than in the placebo group (490 patients, 18.3%) improved in NYHA class from 
baseline to Week 52, and fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (92 patients, 3.4%) than in the placebo 
group (130 patients, 4.8%) worsened.

KCCQ  summary  scores  and  domains  change  from  baseline  MMRM  results,  trial  1245.110  −  TS  (on-
treatment) 
The summary scores were based on the domains enclosed by the matching coloured boxes, also see 0. 
The  change  from  baseline  in  KCCQ  clinical  summary  score  at  Week  52  was  a  secondary/exploratory 
endpoint. The mean treatment difference in change was 1.32, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.19. Although statistically 
significant,  the  treatment  difference  appears  modest,  and  the  clinical  relevance  is  questionable.  The 
Applicant also provided the proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant change (i.e. 5 points). This 
endpoint  was  not  defined  as  a  secondary  endpoint  but  resulted  in  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  with 
clinically  relevant  change  (empagliflozin  1126 patients,  41.7%;  placebo  1034  patients,  38.7%),  but  the 
difference  in  percentage  is  small.  For  other  KCCQ  scores,  a  treatment  difference  was  also  observed, 
supporting a consistent finding. Nevertheless, the treatment differences are again considered small and not 
clinically relevant. 
Other efficacy endpoints 
Diabetes-related endpoints 
The onset of DM in patients with pre-DM occurred in fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (120 of 1001 
patients, 12.0%) than in the placebo group (137 of 979 patients, 14.0%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65, 1.07). A 
reduction  in  HbA1c  of  about  0.2%  was  only  seen  in  the  empagliflozin  group  compared  with  placebo  in 
patients with diabetes at baseline. The results for the onset of DM in patients with pre-DM and in patients 
without  DM  in  the  meta-analysis  of  the  EMPEROR  trials  showed  consistent  favourable  trends  for 
empagliflozin.

Other clinical cardiovascular outcome events 
The following clinical events are described in this section: 
•  3-point MACE (adjudicated CV death, adjudicated non-fatal MI, or adjudicated nonfatal 
stroke) 
•  Adjudicated MI (fatal or non-fatal) 
•  Composite of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated non-fatal MI 
•  Adjudicated stroke (fatal or non-fatal) 
•  Composite of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated non-fatal stroke 
•  Adjudicated TIA 
• 
Time to new onset of atrial fibrillation (as ECG findings or as AEs with PT “atrial fibrillation”) 
The results for both treatment groups were similar for all endpoints as based on Cox 
regression analysis and estimated cumulative incidence analysis; see Table 18.

NYHA class change from baseline 
More patients in the empagliflozin group (609 patients, 22.6%) than in the placebo group (490 patients, 
18.3%)  had  an  improved  NYHA  class  at  Week  52  compared  with  baseline,  and  fewer  patients  in  the 
empagliflozin group (92 patients, 3.4%) than in the placebo group (130 patients, 4.8%) had a worsened 
NYHA class.

Body weight change from baseline 
There was a small decrease in body weight in the empagliflozin group, with a placebo-corrected adjusted 
mean change at Week 52 from baseline of -1.28 kg (95% CI -1.54, -1.03). 
Blood pressure change from baseline 
There  was  no  marked  change  in  blood  pressure  in  the  empagliflozin  group,  with  a  placebo-corrected 
adjusted mean change at Week 52 from baseline of -1.2 mmHg (95% CI -2.1, -0.3) for SBP and -0.2 mmHg 
(95% CI -0.7, 0.3) for DBP. 
The  effects  of  empagliflozin  were  accompanied  by  effects  on  body  weight,  improvement  in  NYHA 
classification and reduction in systolic blood pressure. This is in line with previous observations with SGLT2i 
treatment. The HR > 1 for myocardial infarction and strokes will be discussed in the safety section. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Primary endpoint: CV death or HHF 
The  consistency  of  the  treatment  effect  was  investigated  in  predefined  subgroups  by  demographics, 
baseline characteristics, and baseline medications. The results were consistent across the subgroups, with 
the interaction p-values above 0.05 for all analysed subgroups, including diabetes status and LVEF (0 and 
0).  Note  that  the  subgroup  analyses  were  not  adjusted  for  multiple testing  and  that  effects observed  in 
small subgroups are more prone to random variation. Age (interaction p-value = 0.5162), eGFR (interaction 
p-value = 0.6331),  or  LVEF  (interaction  p-value  =  0.4333)  analysed  as  a  continuous  variable  had  no 
relevant impact on the results of the primary analysis. (Figure 14, 15 and 16)

Key secondary endpoint 1: first and recurrent HHF 
In general, the subgroup analyses of first and recurrent HHF showed similar trends to those observed for 
the primary endpoint. Forest plots of the subgroup analyses are presented in Figure 17 and 0 Interaction 
p-values of <0.05 were observed in the subgroup analyses by LVEF and the use of MRAs. 
Patients  with  LVEF  <60%  at  baseline  appeared  to  have  a  greater  effect  of  empagliflozin  versus  placebo 
than patients with LVEF values ≥60%. When the time to first HHF was analysed (i.e. not including recurrent 
events), this trend was less pronounced. With regard to the use of MRAs, patients taking MRAs at baseline 
showed a smaller effect of empagliflozin vs placebo than patients who were not taking MRAs. However, the 
HR was below 1 for both subcategories, and there was considerable overlap in the confidence intervals.

Post hoc analyses of HF outcomes by LVEF 
The Applicant analysed subgroups by LVEF in more detail for the HF outcomes, using a 5% increment of 
LVEF to categorise patients. Patients with LVEF ≥70% (N = 319; max 88%) were grouped together to 
avoid very small subgroups. No consistent trend by LVEF is observed for any endpoint analysed, with all 
trend test p-values >0.05, indicating that the results for the subgroups were consistent with the results in 
the overall trial population. However, only for patients with LVEF of 65 to <70%, was the HR above 1 for 
the first HHF and the occurrence of HHF (first and recurrent). The HR for CV death was consistent across 
the subgroups. As the majority of the primary endpoint events were HHF, accordingly the HR for the 
primary endpoint in the subgroup with LVEF of 65 to <70% for HHF or CV death was also above 1 
(Figure 19). For the analysis of the first HHF, a numerically higher proportion of patients in the 
empagliflozin arm (33 of 263, 12.5%) than in the placebo arm (22 of 283, 7.8%) had an event in the 
subgroup with LVEF of 65 to <70%, while it was the opposite for all other subgroups (e.g. in the 
subgroup with LVEF ≥70%: 15 of 165 patients, 9.1% in the empagliflozin arm and 23 of 154 patients, 
14.9% in the placebo arm had HHF). The incidence rates per 100 patient-years among the subgroups 
were similar within the respective treatment arm (ranging from 3.67 to 4.44 in the empagliflozin arm and 
5.55 to 7.75 in the placebo arm), except in the subgroup with LVEF of 65 to <70%. In this subgroup, the 
incidence rate was highest (6.49) among all subgroups in the empagliflozin arm while lowest (3.96) 
among all subgroups in the placebo arm (Figure 19).

Subgroup analyses of HF outcomes by baseline LVEF – RS, post hoc 
Overall, for patients who had HHF events, fewer in the empagliflozin arm had 1, 2, and 3 HHF events, but 
a similar number had 4 or more HHF events compared with placebo (Figure 20 upper part). For patients 
who had 4 or more events, in the subgroup of LVEF of 65 to <70%, 6 patients in the empagliflozin arm 
had 31 events while 1 patient in the placebo arm had 5 events, which substantially contributed to the 
imbalance in the analysis of the first and recurrent HHF in this subgroup (Figure 20 lower part).

Key secondary endpoint 2: eGFR slope 
The  results  for  the  eGFR  slope  analysis  were  generally  consistent  across  the  predefined  subgroups  by 
demographics, baseline characteristics, and baseline medications (Figure 21. and 0). Patients with diabetes 
showed a larger effect of empagliflozin vs placebo than patients without diabetes. However, in both of these 
subgroups, the eGFR decline was slower with empagliflozin treatment than with placebo.

Primary endpoint sensitivity analyses 
The sensitivity analyses were exploratory, and the results were generally consistent with the results of the 
primary analysis. The treatment effect was more pronounced for the period before COVID-19 outbreak, i.e. 
before the dates specified in the TSAP (01 Dec 2019 for China and 01 Jan 2020 for all other countries). As 
shown  by  the  sensitivity  analyses  including  events  after  the  end  of  treatment  until  individual  trial 
completion, the modification of the primary analysis had no impact on the results (0). 
Sensitivity  analyses  for  the  primary  endpoint:  time  to  the  first  event  of  adjudicated  CV  death  or  HHF,

COVID-19 onset dates are 01 Dec 2019 for China and 01 Jan 2020 for all other countries. 
SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined by broad scope BIcMQ SARS-CoV-2 infection including PT ‘Suspected Covid-19’. 
* There is no single definition of number of patients with an event because each imputation can produce a different number of events; 88 patients in the placebo group and 84 patients in the 
empagliflozin groups were lost to follow-up for the primary endpoint (prematurely discontinued trial) and had imputed data [CTR 1245.110, c31803238, Tables 10.1: 2 and 15.2.1.2: 3].

In the sensitivity analyses the treatment effect for the primary endpoint appears larger before vs. after 
COVID-19 outbreak (before HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.59-0.83; after HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.76-1.13), with a similar 
number of subjects included before and after. The treatment difference may, at least partly, be explained 
by that during COVID outbreak, less patients were accepted for hospitalisation, but this is speculative.

Meta-analysis of EMPEROR trials (1245.121 and 1245.110) 
The two outcome trials were conducted globally in 24 countries. A total of 9718 randomised patients from 
the two  trials  were  included  in this  meta-analysis.  Vital  status  was  known  for  99.4%  of  the  randomised 
patients. The median observation time (Q1, Q3) up to the end of the planned treatment period was about 
21 (15, 29) months. Disposition, demographics, and baseline characteristics were balanced between the 
treatment groups; some differences were observed between EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPEROR-Reduced 
studies.  The  meta-analysis  was  carried  out  using  individual  patient  data  after  both  trials  had  been 
completed. The methods in the meta-analysis were consistent with those used at trial level.

Results 
Since empagliflozin was superior to placebo based on all confirmatory endpoints in the hierarchical testing 
in  both  trials,  all  alpha  of  the  final  analysis  from  the  2  trials  (0.0496  from  1245.121  and  0.0497  from 
1245.110) was transferred to this meta-analysis. The actual α for the meta-analysis was 0.0496 (2-sided). 
In  this  meta-analysis,  the  hierarchical  testing  stopped  after  the  primary  endpoint  (the  composite  renal 
endpoint), which did not show a statistically significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo. The 
3 key secondary endpoints were therefore analysed in an exploratory manner.  
For the primary endpoint, the pooled HR estimates are considered not meaningful as the 2 EMPEROR trials 
showed different results (treatment-by-trial interaction p = 0.0157; Figure 24). The risk was reduced with 
empagliflozin compared with placebo in trial 1245.121 (HFrEF) but not in 1245.110 (HFpEF; also see Figure 
16), which may be attributed to differences in patient characteristics between the two studies.

Time to composite renal endpoint, overall and by trial – RS 
Estimates for the trial level results in the pooled analysis could differ slightly from the results in the individual trial reports due to the combined analysis and 
different covariate adjustments. 
Source data: [MA report, c31556490, Appendix 10, Figure 2.1.4.1.1] 
For the 3 key secondary endpoints (exploratory), there was no interaction in the by-trial subgroup analyses 
and the pooled results showed that CV death or onset of diabetes (in patients with pre-diabetes) occurred 
in numerically fewer patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The results for all-cause 
mortality were similar between empagliflozin and placebo. 
As a secondary endpoint (exploratory), the onset of diabetes in patients without diabetes also occurred in 
numerically fewer patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70, 
1.02), which was consistent between trials. 
As  another  secondary  endpoint  (exploratory),  eGFR  [mL/min/1.73  m2]  decline  (i.e.  chronic  slope)  was 
shown to be slower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (difference to placebo 1.45 per 
year, 95% CI 1.18, 1.73), which was supported by a weighted ANCOVA analysis (difference to placebo 1.03 
per year, 95% CI 0.71, 1.34) of annualised change from pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (follow-
up). These results were consistent between the trials. 
A  meta-analysis  of  the  EMPEROR-reduced  and  -preserved  was  performed,  with  as  primary  endpoint  the 
time to the first event in the composite renal endpoint. The hierarchical testing stopped after the primary 
endpoint, which did not show a statistically significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo. The 
Applicant describes that the pooled HR estimates are considered not meaningful as the 2 EMPEROR trials 
showed different results (treatment-by-trial interaction p = 0.0157).  Based on the additional data provided 
by  the  Applicant,  there  is  a  smaller  treatment  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  the  eGFR  slope  in  EMPEROR-
Preserved compare to in the EMPEROR-Reduced. Explanations for this finding are speculative but may be 
related  to  the  higher  SBP  in  patients  with  HFpEF,  which  may  lead  to  different  vessel  architecture  or 
intrarenal  patho-mechanisms  such  as  less  inflammation.  This  could  be  important  in  view  of  anti-
inflammatory effects being proposed for SGLT2i. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
A  subgroup  analysis  based  on  age  was  performed  (see  above).  This  showed a  similar  or  possible  larger 
treatment effect on the primary endpoint for patients ≥70 years vs <70 years (<70 years HR 0.88, 95%CI 
0.70 – 1.11; ≥70 years HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.64 – 0.87). 
The applicant was requested to discuss if the recommendation in section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC for the 
population aged ≥85 years is still suitable based on the efficacy and safety data collected for empagliflozin 
and if this may differ per indication. In the response, the applicant provided the efficacy data below.

As pre-specified in the individual EMPEROR CTRs, the subgroup analyses showed consistent results for the 
confirmatory  endpoints  by  age  categories  (<  and  ≥65  years  in  EMPEROR-Reduced;  <  and  ≥70  years in 
EMPEROR-Preserved).  Moreover,  age  analysed  as  a  continuous  variable  had  no  relevant  impact  on  the 
results  of  the  primary  endpoint  (treatment-by-age  interaction  p  =  0.2366  for  EMPEROR-Reduced  and 
0.5162 for EMPEROR-Preserved). 
In the two EMPEROR trials, a meaningful number of patients aged ≥85 years were included (a total of 483 
patients),  with  fewer  patients  from  EMPEROR-Reduced  (58  patients  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  41 
patients  in  the  placebo  group)  than  EMPEROR-Preserved  (178  and  206  patients)  [CTR  1245.121, 
c28576542, Table 15.1.4: 1; CTR 1245.110, c31803238, Table 15.1.4: 1].  
In order to increase the sample size for more precise estimations in smaller subgroups, the two trials were 
pooled  for  the  analyses  by  age  using  5  categories.  The  results  showed  that  the  beneficial  effects  of 
empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo were independent of age (see Figure 25).

Supportive study(ies) 
EMPA-VISION (trial 1245.1480) 
Trial  1245.148  (EMPA-VISION)  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  12-
week trial to assess the effect of empagliflozin on cardiac physiology and metabolism. A total of 72 patients 
were randomised, with 36 each in the HFrEF cohort (LVEF ≤40%) or the HFpEF cohort (LVEF ≥50%), in a 
1:1 ratio to empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo within the cohort. The primary endpoint was the change from 
baseline  to  Week  12  in  phosphocreatine  to  adenosine  triphosphate  (PCr/ATP)  ratio  in  the  resting  state 
measured by 31P cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The primary analysis was based on the per-
protocol set of patients with PCr/ATP measurements at baseline and Week 12, and using an ANOVA model.  
In the HFrEF cohort, 17 patients in the empagliflozin group and 18 in the placebo group were assessed for 
the  primary  endpoint.  There  was  no  significant  difference  between  empagliflozin  and  placebo,  with  an 
adjusted mean change of -0.179 (SE 0.117) for empagliflozin vs 0.068 (SE 0.114) for placebo. The adjusted 
mean treatment difference was -0.247 (95% CI: -0.582, 0.087; p = 0.1418).  
In the HFpEF cohort, 13 patients in the empagliflozin group and 11 in the placebo group were assessed for 
the primary endpoint. The most common reason for missing data at Week 12, and consequent exclusion 
from the primary analysis, was that due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, patients were unable to attend 
face-to-face visits from 24 Mar 2020 onwards. There was no significant difference between empagliflozin 
and placebo, with an adjusted mean change of 0.100 (SE 0.143) for empagliflozin vs 0.259 (SE 0.156) for 
placebo. The adjusted mean treatment difference was -0.159 (95% CI: -0.604, 0.286; p = 0.4650).  
Imbalances in important baseline characteristics, a study population with fewer than expected patients with 
a history of diabetes, along with fewer patients than planned contributing to the HFpEF analysis (due to 
COVID-19 restrictions), may have limited the efficacy findings of interest in this trial. 
EMPERIAL-preserved (1245.167) 
The EMPERIAL-preserved trial (1245.167) was described in a previous application for the indication 
chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Trial 1245.167 was a randomised, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week trial to assess the effect of empagliflozin on functional capacity. The 
eligibility criteria in the EMPERIAL-preserved trial were generally similar to those in the EMPEROR-
preserved trial. The additional EMPERIAL trial was comparable regarding the screening and treatment, 
except for the treatment duration. The EMPERIAL trials were not event-driven but were designed to 
investigate the short-term (12 weeks) effect of empagliflozin on functional capacity, signs and symptoms 
of heart failure, and quality of life. Therefore, a treatment duration of 12 weeks was implemented. The 
EMPERIAL-preserved trial included 315 subjects.  
The following endpoints were pre-specified: 
Primary endpoint:  
• 
change from baseline to Week 12 in the 6-minute-walk test (6MWT) distance 
Key secondary endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in KCCQ-TSS (, total symptom score) 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in CHQ-SAS (chronic heart failure questionnaire self-
administered standardised format) dyspnoea score 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

In 1245.167, of the 315 randomised patients treated with study medication, 301 (95.6%) completed the 
trial, and 291 (92.4%) completed the treatment with study medication. There were no relevant 
differences between the treatment groups.  
The primary endpoint (change from baseline to Week 12 in the 6MWT distance) did not show a 
statistically significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo. The two key secondary endpoints 
(change from baseline to Week 12 in KCCQ-TSS and in CHQ-SAS dyspnoea score) were therefore tested 
in an exploratory fashion. No meaningful differences between treatment groups were observed in the 
efficacy endpoints in 1245.167 (HFpEF). 
The EMPERIAL-preserved trial was designed to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo 
on functional capacity and HF-related symptoms. The results of these studies address whether 
symptomatology improves after short-term treatment. The primary endpoint (change from baseline to 
Week 12 in the 6MWT distance) did not show a statistically significant difference between empagliflozin 
and placebo. This, therefore, does not support a beneficial effect of empagliflozin on functional capacity. 
The EMPA-VISION was a trial to assess the effect of empagliflozin on cardiac physiology and metabolism 
and included a small number of subjects (empagliflozin n=17, placebo n=18). In this trial also, there was 
no significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo. The Applicant describes that imbalances in 
important baseline characteristics and the small number of subjects may have hampered the efficacy 
results.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant states that the trial was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, in accordance with the ICH GCP.  
No dose finding study has been performed. This is considered acceptable based on the data for the indication 
of T2DM and HFrEF, but it cannot be excluded that a lower dose than 10 mg is effective for the current 
indication.  
The EMPEROR-preserved trial (1245.110) is a pivotal outcome trial and is an international, multi-centre, 
placebo-controlled, randomised (empagliflozin 10 mg to placebo 1:1), double-blind, and parallel-group by 
design in patients with HFpEF with or without T2DM. The aim of the trial is to demonstrate superiority of 
empagliflozin  10  mg  versus  placebo  (empagliflozin  10 mg  to  placebo  1:1)  in  reducing  the  risk  of 
hospitalisation for HF and of cardiovascular death in patients with symptomatic, chronic HF and preserved 
ejection fraction (LVEF > 40%) under stable treatment of HF symptoms. The trial consisted of an event-
driven study duration, followed by a 30-days period off study-drug. The design of the trial is acceptable 
and in line with the EMA guideline “Clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of chronic 
heart failure” (CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2).  
The inclusion criteria consisted of age ≥ 18 years, eGFR ≥ 20 and a LVEF >40%. Although HFpEF has been 
defined from a LVEF >40%, the range between 40 and 50% is currently considered HFmEF and this group 
of  patients  may  differ  in  the  aetiology  and  treatment  response  compared  to  patients  with  LVEF 
>50%/HFpEF. Retrospective analyses have suggested that the benefits of neurohormonal antagonists in 
patients with HFrEF extend to those with a mildly reduced ejection fraction (Dewan P et al. Eur J Heart Fail 
2020). This may affect the interpretation of the overall efficacy results. However, stratified randomisation 
was performed for LVEF subgroups (i.e. LVEF <50%, LVEF 50-<60% and LVEF ≥60%).  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022

Known causes for HFpEF are infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis, but this was an exclusion criteria.  
The Applicant has put forward several reasons for excluding these subjects from the study (diagnosis 
made quite late, poor prognosis or [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy] could completely resolve). It was 
assessed that patients known to have one of these conditions would have a substantially different risk of 
a primary outcome event than the rest of the study population. This implies that the B/R could be quite 
different from the rest of the study population and it has not been studied specifically. The Applicant 
included a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC, describing that efficacy in these patients has not been 
established. This is acceptable. 
The other described exclusion criteria are in general reasonable and do not seem to hamper the 
translation of the trial results to the general HFrEF population at large in clinical practice.   
The primary endpoint, i.e. combined CV endpoint of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF, is considered 
adequate for the current application and in line with the EMA guideline (CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2). For the 
key  secondary  renal  endpoint,  the  eGFR  (CKD-EPI)cr  slope  of  change  from  baseline  was  analysed.  This 
endpoint has the limitation that a long treatment period, i.e. more than 2 years, is considered needed to 
confirm a beneficial effect. A combined renal endpoint (i.e. chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or sustained 
reduction in eGFR) would have been preferred, although it is acknowledged that an analysis based on this 
clinical endpoint is difficult in this population with a broad eGFR range and considering the time frame and 
number of patients needed to demonstrate any reasonable effect.  
COVID-19 had effect on the conduct of the study as 31.8% of patients had at least one visit affected by 
COVID-19 and these visits were often performed by phone instead of on-site. It is not considered likely 
that this affected the primary endpoint or other endpoints related to HHF or CV death/all-cause mortality. 
The adjudication of outcome events by the CEC was performed based on uploaded source documents. The 
adjudicated endpoints were therefore protected from being impacted. Also, for the other endpoints, it is 
not  considered  likely  that  it  affected  the  outcome,  as  data  are  considered  to  be  missing  completely  at 
random.   
Statistical methods 
The  statistical  analyses  in  the  trial  design  are  based  on  an  intention  to  treat  analysis,  and  the  primary 
analysis was a Cox regression with adjudicated CV death or HHF as the primary endpoint with non-CV death 
as a competing event. This is acceptable. The secondary endpoint of recurrent hospitalisations is analysed 
using a joint frailty model. This will adjust the analysis of recurrent hospitalisations for the competing event 
of CV death and is acceptable. The MAH performed additional analyses testing the influence of using CV or 
overall  mortality  in  the  primary  and  key  secondary  composite  endpoints,  and  the  effect  of  the  analysis 
model incorporating recurrent events in the secondary endpoint.  
Cumulative incidence function curves that account for competing risks (i.e. non-CV deaths) and Kaplan-
Meier curves of time to censoring were displayed. 
The secondary endpoint eGFR slope is analysed with a random coefficient model. Since this allows for a 
random intercept, testing a difference in the (random) slope will not reflect the overall treatment effect, 
since the initial dip will be largely incorporated in the intercept. As a sensitivity analysis, an ANCOVA was 
performed to analyse the overall treatment effect of the change from baseline ignoring the path taken and 
this is considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Trial 1245.110 included a large number of subjects (n=5988). Demographics and baseline characteristics 
were balanced between the treatment groups. The proportion of female subjects (44.7%) is remarkably 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 76/120 
 
 
 
 
larger compared to trials performed with HFrEF and the EMPEROR-reduced trial (i.e. 23.9% female). This 
is not unexpected, as HFpEF is more common than HFrEF in female patients. The average age was 71.9 
years (SD 9.4) and the majority of patients was White; 75.9% White, 13.8% Asian, and 4.3% Black/African 
American. About half of patients (48.9%) had T2DM, 10 patients (0.2%) had T1DM. Half of the patients 
(49.9%) had an eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and half of the subjects had atrial fibrillation (51.0%). The 
majority of the patients were in NYHA class II (81.5%) and the cause of HF was hypertensive (36.5%) or 
ischaemic  (35.4%).  This  appears  in  line  with  the  target  population,  supporting  external  validity  of  the 
results.   
The distribution of patients between the LVEF subgroups was also equal between the three subgroups (LVEF 
<50% n=1983 (33.1%), LVEF 50%-<60% n=2058 (34.4%), LVEF >60% n=1947 (32.5%)). As the group 
of LVEF <50% may be considered as HFmEF and not comparable to the higher LVEF subgroups, it is relevant 
that the higher LVEF subgroups consist of a large proportion of the overall sample size.   
Median exposure to study medication was about 23 months in both treatment groups, with 84% of patients 
treated for at least 1 year. This is an acceptable duration to evaluate the treatment effects on efficacy and 
safety for this application.   
CV death or HHF (primary endpoint) occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group (empagliflozin 415/2997, 13.8%; placebo 511/2991, 17.1%), and the risk of CV 
death  or  HHF  was  reduced  with  empagliflozin  treatment  compared  with  placebo  (HR  empagliflozin  vs 
placebo 0.79; 95%CI 0.69 to 0.90, p = 0.0003). This effect appears similar to the effect of empagliflozin 
in patients with HFrEF in the EMPEROR-reduced trial (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.65 - 0.86), but with higher NNT 
(EMPEROR-preserved  NNT  31,  EMPEROR-reduced  NNT  19).  The  separation  of  the  estimated  cumulative 
incidence of CV death or first HHF between empagliflozin and placebo started shortly after randomisation 
and  was  maintained  throughout  the  trial.  These  findings  support  a  beneficial  effect  of  treatment  with 
empagliflozin. The difference in treatment effect appears mainly due to the decrease in HHF, as CV death 
as  the  first  did  not  differ  between  the  treatment  groups  (empagliflozin  n=156  (5.2%),  placebo  n=159 
(5.3%)), but the total number of CV death (described below) was lower with empagliflozin vs placebo, but 
the difference was not statistically significant (empagliflozin 219/2997, placebo 244/2991, HR 0.91, 95%CI 
0.76 – 1.09).   
All-cause mortality was similar in both treatment groups (HR 1.00, 95%CI 0.87 – 1.15). The number of 
non-CV  death  was  larger  with  empagliflozin,  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
(empagliflozin  203/2997,  placebo  183/2991,  HR  1.13,  95%CI  0.92  –  1.38).  The  Applicant  provided  an 
evaluation of the causes of non-CV death, and this did not show a specific increase in a cause of death 
during empagliflozin treatment.  
An initial dip in eGFR was observed with empagliflozin treatment, followed by a slower decrease in eGFR 
over time. This is in line with results in previous trials performed with SGLT2i. The change of eGFR slope 
from  baseline  was  a  key  secondary  endpoint  and  showed  a  slower  decline  in  eGFR  in  the  empagliflozin 
group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.363 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.861 
to 1.865; p<0.0001). But the effect on slope can only be interpreted if seen in conjunction with intercept. 
The  applicant  also  provided  an  analysis  of  change  from  baseline  using  ANCOVA,  similar  to  the  previous 
application for the HFrEF indication. This resulted in a larger or similar decrease in eGFR for empagliflozin 
vs. placebo (change from baseline: empagliflozin -6.4, placebo -6.0, comparison -0.4 (-1.2, 0.3)). But after 
the 30 day follow-up period after stop of treatment, the decrease in eGFR was smaller for the empagliflozin 
group (change from baseline: empagliflozin -3.3, placebo -5.7, comparison 2.4 (1.6, 3.2)), supporting that 
the initial dip is reversable. The effect on the renal composite endpoint is, however, considered preferred 
for  evaluation  of  renal  effects.  In  the  current  trial,  the  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  the  eGFR  slope  is  not 
supported or confirmed by the observed effects on the composite renal endpoint (i.e. chronic dialysis, renal 
transplant,  or  sustained  reduction  in  eGFR),  as  the  results  are  similar  for  empagliflozin  vs.  placebo 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

(empagliflozin  108/2997  (3.6%),  placebo  112/2991  (3.7%),  HR  0.95  95%CI  0.73,  1.24).  However,  the 
Applicants supports the findings with other additional pre-specified analyses, i.e. eGFR change from pre-
treatment  (baseline)  to  post-treatment  (follow-up; FU)  analysed  with  ANCOVA,  “true  slope”  (annualised 
change  from  pre-treatment  to  post-treatment  weighted  by  time  of  FU  squared)  and  progression  to  or 
reversal from macro-albuminuria. Although all exploratory, these findings indicate a consistent finding and 
this appears clinical relevant.  
A meta-analysis of the EMPEROR-reduced and -preserved was performed with as primary endpoint the time 
to  the  first  event  in  the  composite  renal  endpoint.  The  hierarchical  testing  stopped  after  the  primary 
endpoint, which did not show a statistically significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo. The 
Applicant describes that the pooled HR estimates are considered not meaningful as the 2 EMPEROR trials 
showed different results (treatment-by-trial interaction p = 0.0157). This composite of major adverse renal 
outcomes was significantly lower in the EMPEROR-Preserved trial than in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial. Based 
on the additional data provided by the Applicant, there is a smaller treatment effect of empagliflozin on the 
eGFR slope in EMPEROR-Preserved than in EMPEROR-Reduced. Explanations for this finding are speculative 
but may be related to the higher SBP in patients with HFpEF. 
The  effects  of  empagliflozin  were  accompanied  by  effects  on  body  weight,  improvement  in  NYHA 
classification and reduction in systolic blood pressure. This is in line with previous observations with SGLT2i 
treatment.   
The change from baseline in KCCQ clinical summary score at Week 52 was a secondary/exploratory 
endpoint. The mean treatment difference in change was 1.32, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.19. Although statistically 
significant, the treatment difference appears modest, and the clinical relevance is questionable. The 
Applicant also provided the proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant change (i.e. 5 points). 
This endpoint resulted in a larger proportion of patients with clinically relevant change (empagliflozin 
1126 patients, 41.7%; placebo 1034 patients, 38.7%), but the difference in percentage is small. For 
other KCCQ scores, a treatment difference was also observed, supporting a consistent finding, but the 
treatment differences are again considered small and not clinically relevant.  
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary and key secondary endpoints. Important is the 
subgroup analyses for LVEF. Although p for interaction was not significant (p=0.2098) for the primary 
endpoint (CV death or HHF), the effect was more pronounced in patients with LVEF <50% compared to 
≥60%, but was positive for all LVEF subgroups and still significant for the group LVEF 50-<60% (LVEF 
<50% empagliflozin 145/995, placebo 193/988, HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.57-0.88; LVEF 50-<60% 
empagliflozin 138/1028, placebo 173/1030, HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.64-0.99; LVEF >60% empagliflozin 
132/974, placebo 145/973, HR 0.87, 95%CI 0.69-1.10). As the effect of empagliflozin on the primary 
endpoint was beneficial for all LVEF subgroups, the indication for the treatment of heart failure in patients 
with HFpEF is acceptable. As the indication for the treatment of heart failure is for all types of heart 
failure, the wording “for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure.” is considered acceptable. 
It could, however, be suggested that there is a modification of the treatment effect in subjects with 
higher LVEF for the key secondary endpoint, i.e. adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent), where the point 
estimate for the subgroup LVEF ≥60% is HR 1.06 (95%CI 0.76-1.46) and p for interaction 0.0077. This 
could indicate that patients with LVEF ≥60% benefit less from treatment with empagliflozin. The Applicant 
performed additional post-hoc analyses with subgroups by LVEF in more detail for the HF outcomes, using 
a 5% increment of LVEF to categorise patients for this secondary endpoint and for the primary endpoint. 
For first HHF in the subgroup LVEF 60 to <65% the hazard ratio was 0.75 (95%CI 0.51 – 1.10). The HR 
was >1 in subgroup LVEF 65 to <70% (HR 1.57, 95%CI 0.92 – 2.70), but in subgroup LVEF ≥70% the 
HR was again <1 (HR 0.55, 95%CI 0.29 to 1.06). Notably, the number of subjects is low in this latter 
subgroup (subjects n=319), but the lower HR in the subgroup ≥70%, contradicts the suggestions of a 
decrease in effect in higher LVEF subgroup. For the analyses of total occurrence of HHF (first and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 78/120 
 
 
 
 
recurrent), the HR was >1 for two subgroups, i.e. subgroup LVEF 60 to <65% (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.66 – 
1.65) and LVEF 65 to <70% (HR 1.86, 95%CI 1.03 – 3.35). But again, the subgroup LVEF ≥70% had a 
HR <1 (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.20 - 0.88). The recurrent HHF appears to mainly contribute to the finding of a 
higher hazard ratio for the subgroup LVEF ≥60% in the secondary endpoint. The analyses on the 
contribution of HHF events by number of events experienced per patient showed that for patients who 
had 4 or more events, in the subgroup of LVEF of 65 to <70% 6 patients in the empagliflozin arm had 31 
events while 1 patient in the placebo arm had 5 events. This may contribute to the imbalance in the 
analysis of the recurrent HHF in this subgroup. This may be related to chance. Based on these findings it 
is not considered supported that there is a decrease in efficacy in patients with higher LVEF.  
Although effectiveness of treatment with ACEi/ARB, MRA’s and/or ARNI’s have not been demonstrated in 
patients with HFpEF, the majority of the patients used these treatments during the trial, i.e. ACEi/ARB’s, 
82.6%, MRA’s 46.0%, ARNI’s 4.4%. Empagliflozin was, therefore, evaluated on top of these medication, 
but these medications are not registered for the treatment of HFpEF. The Applicant described the baseline 
use of these agents in the trial population in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. The subgroup analysis for baseline 
use of ACEi/ARB/ARNI's and/or MRA's resulted in a similar risk reduction with empagliflozin vs. placebo for 
the primary and key secondary endpoints for patients using these agents compared to patients not using 
these  agents  at  baseline.  As  the  efficacy  of  empagliflozin  appears  consistent  with  vs  without  the  use  of 
these agents, it is acceptable that the indication for the treatment of HFpEF is independent of the baseline 
use of these agents. 
In  elderly  patients,  i.e.  age  ≥  70  years,  the  point  estimate  of  treatment  effect  was  larger  compared  to 
patients < 70 for the primary endpoint (age ≥70 years HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.64-0.95, age <70 years HR 0.88, 
95%CI 0.70-1.11) and key secondary endpoint (HHF) (age ≥70 years HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.52-0.82, age <70 
years HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.67-1.26). This supports a beneficial effect in elderly patients.  
In  the  sensitivity  analyses  the  treatment  effect  for  the  primary  endpoint  appears  larger  before  vs.  after 
COVID-19 outbreak (before HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.59-0.83; after HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.76-1.13), with a similar 
number of subjects included before and after. The treatment difference may, at least partly, be explained 
by that during COVID outbreak, less patients were accepted for hospitalisation, but this is speculative.  
The EMPERIAL-preserved trial (n=315) was designed to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg versus 
placebo on functional capacity and HF-related symptoms. The results of these small sized studies address 
whether symptomatology improves after short-term treatment. The primary endpoint (change from 
baseline to Week 12 in the 6MWT distance) did not show a statistically significant difference between 
empagliflozin and placebo. This, therefore, does not support a beneficial effect of empagliflozin on 
functional capacity.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the well-designed pivotal outcome trial 1245.110 showed a risk reduction with 
empagliflozin vs. placebo in patients with HFpEF for the combined cardiovascular endpoint (HHF or CV 
death). For the primary endpoint, this was observed across the LVEF subgroups. The wording of indication 
is considered acceptable. The Applicant included a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC, describing that 
efficacy in patients with infiltrative diseases has not been established. This is acceptable.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Currently, empagliflozin is registered for the treatment of T2DM and for chronic heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction. Based on the placebo-controlled trials and post-marketing experience, known side-effects 
of treatment with empagliflozin are o.a. genital infections, keto-acidosis, hypoglycaemia, volume depletion 
and urinary tract infections. See also the table below from Section 4.8 of the current SmPC of Jardiance 
(Table 20).

a In the EMPEROR-Reduced heart failure study, one case (<0.1%) of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier´s gangrene) was observed in a patient with 
heart failure and diabetes mellitus treated with empagliflozin. 
The main objective of the below described safety evaluation is to present and evaluate safety data on the 
clinical  use  of  empagliflozin  in  patients  with  chronic  heart  failure.  The  trials  included  patients  with  and 
without T2DM. 
The described safety analyses followed the “treatment-emergent” principle and included all treated patients 
(TS).  Unless  otherwise  specified,  treatment  was  assigned  as  randomised  and  the  analyses  of  AEs  were 
based on the number of patients with AEs. AE analyses were restricted to “on-treatment” AEs, defined as

AEs with an onset date between the first trial medication intake and 7 days after the last intake, unless 
otherwise stated. Exposure-adjusted AEs were also displayed as incidence rates per 100 patient-years.  
In addition to the safety analyses of trials 1245.110 (EMPEROR-Preserved) and 1245.148 (EMPA-VISION) 
presented in CTRs, safety data of 5 trials in patients with chronic HF were pooled as “SAF-HF1”, regardless 
of LVEF category.  
Patient exposure 
In SAF-HF1, 10408 patients were treated. The majority of the patients were from the two EMPEROR trials 
(Table 21).

Of the 10408 treated patients in SAF-HF1, 7472 patients (71.8%) completed treatment as planned, and 
2936 patients prematurely discontinued study medication (28.2%, including patients who died). The most 
common reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was AE (17.7%, including fatal events;

Adverse events 
In SAF-HF1, the frequencies of patients with at least one AE, severe AEs, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation  were  similar  between  empagliflozin  and  placebo.  The  frequency  of  investigator-defined 
drug-related AEs was higher in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The frequency of patients 
with SAEs was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (Table 24. ). The most frequent 
events in these categories are described below.

Most frequently reported AEs 
Adverse events were most frequently reported in the SOCs cardiac disorders (empagliflozin 1548 patients, 
29.7%  vs  placebo  1822  patients,  35.0%),  infections  and  infestations  (1700 patients,  32.7%  vs  1732 
patients, 33.3%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (1241 patients, 23.8% vs 1446 patients, 27.8%) 
(Table 25). On the PT level, the most frequently reported AE were cardiac failure (795 patients, 15.3% vs 
1065 patients,  20.5%), hypotension  (372  patients,  7.1%  vs  313 patients,  6.0%),  and  renal impairment 
(320 patients, 6.1% vs 312 patients, 6.0%). Preferred terms with a higher frequency in the empagliflozin 
group  than  in  the  placebo  group  were  urinary  tract  infection  and  hypotension.  Adverse  events  with  PTs 
reported in ≥5.0% of patients in at least one group are summarised in the table below

The number of AEs and severe AEs were similar for empagliflozin compared to placebo, but the number of 
cardiac events is lower for empagliflozin vs. placebo, and the similar number of total AEs could therefore 
result in a larger number of other AEs. Based on the most frequently reported AEs, this number of events 
is  also  similar  for  empagliflozin  compared to  placebo,  except  for hypotension (empagliflozin  372  (7.1%) 
placebo  313  (6.0%))  and  urinary  tract  infections  (empagliflozin  314  (6.0%)  placebo  259  (5.0%)). 
Hypotension is a known side-effect for SGLT2i treatment and can be related to other symptoms, such as 
syncope and fall, discussed below. Urinary tract infections are also known side effects of SGLT2i treatment. 
AEs by worst intensity 
Adverse events were primarily of mild or moderate intensity (Table 26). The frequencies of patients with 
severe AEs were similar between treatment groups. On the PT level, proportions of patients with AEs of

1  Deaths  not  attributed  to  another  PT  by  the investigator.  The  frequencies  of  patients  with  fatal  AEs  were  balanced  between  treatment.  Source  data:  [SCS 
appendix 2, c35146126, Table 2.1.1.4] 
The number of AEs with worst intensity were not more frequent during empagliflozin treatment compared 
to placebo. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and specific AEs 
The safety analyses were also focused on AESIs and specific AEs that represent specific medical concepts 
of interest with all relevant PTs analysed together. 
In SAF-HF1, the overall frequencies of patients with acute renal failure, ketoacidosis, AEs leading to LLA, 
confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events,  bone  fractures,  and  urinary  tract  malignancies  were  similar  in  the 
empagliflozin group and in the placebo group (Table 27). Urinary tract infections, genital infections, and 
volume depletion, including hypotension, were more common in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo 
group. Fewer patients in the empagliflozin group had hepatic injury events. The frequencies of patients with 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were below 1% in any category of AESIs or specific AEs except 
for acute renal failure (which was balanced between groups).

Decreased renal function 
The frequencies of patients with acute renal failure (narrow SMQ) were similar in the empagliflozin group 
and  in  the  placebo  group;  see  Table  28.  The  most  frequently  reported  PT  within  the  SMQ  was  renal 
impairment.  Of  note,  the  PT  acute  kidney  injury  was  reported  for  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
empagliflozin group than in the placebo group.

The frequency of patients with SAEs of acute renal failure was also lower in the empagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication were reported with similar 
frequencies in the empagliflozin group and in the placebo group.

Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  by  age,  sex,  race,  and  baseline  eGFR,  diabetes  status,  and  use  of 
certain medications (i.e. ACE-inhibitors/ARB/ARNi, diuretics, loop/high-ceiling diuretics).  
Investigator-defined decreased renal function (reported as AESI) was reported for 2.7% of patients (133 
of 4894) in the empagliflozin group and 4.0% of patients (197 of 4888) in the placebo group.  
In the analysis of safety laboratory parameters, the frequencies of patients with serum creatinine ≥2x the 
baseline value and above the normal range were 1.7% in the empagliflozin group and 2.1% in the placebo 
group. 
Hepatic injury 
The frequency of patients with hepatic injury (narrow SMQs) was lower in the empagliflozin group than in 
the  placebo  group  (Table  29).  The  most  frequent  PTs  were  liver  injury,  hepatic  function  abnormal,  and 
hepatic steatosis. All other PTs were reported for ≤0.2% of patients in either treatment group.  
Similar  frequencies  between  groups  or  lower  frequencies  in  the  empagliflozin group  than  in  the  placebo 
group were observed for serious hepatic injury, for events leading to discontinuation of study medication, 
and  for  all  hepatic  injury  events  when  considering  a  longer  period  of  up  to  30 days  after  treatment 
discontinuation. Patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes showed the same trend as the overall 
population.

Hepatic events (occurring up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation) were adjudicated; adjudication 
results  with  patient  details  are  summarised  in  the  CTRs.  No  hepatic  events  that  met  the  criteria  for 
adjudication were reported in trials 1245.168 and 1245.148. 
Ketoacidosis 
For a comprehensive analysis, ketoacidosis was investigated using both broad and narrow BIcMQs. Based 
on  the  broad  BIcMQ,  events  suggestive  of  ketoacidosis  were  reported  for  63 patients  (1.2%)  in  the 
empagliflozin group and for 77 patients (1.5%) in the placebo group; see Table 31. .  Metabolic acidosis 
was  the  most  frequent  PT  of  the  broad  BIcMQ;  there  was  no  relevant  increase  in  frequency  with 
empagliflozin treatment. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

All  events  in  the  broad  BIcMQ  were  adjudicated  (except  for  the  PTs  ‘abnormal  blood  bicarbonate’  and 
‘decreased blood bicarbonate’ in trial 1245.110, which were added to the broad BIcMQ as part of a MedDRA 
update  while  the  trial  was  ongoing).  One  patient  in  each  group  had  an  event  which  was  adjudicated  as 
certain ketoacidosis by the independent CEC (both patients had T2DM at baseline). The event was of mild 
severity  in  the  patient  treated  with  empagliflozin  and  of  moderate  severity  in  the  patient  treated  with 
placebo. 
The narrow BIcMQ ketoacidosis included 4 patients (0.1%) in the empagliflozin group and 6 patients (0.1%) 
in the placebo group. Subgroups (by diabetes status and sex) and ketoacidosis leading to discontinuation 
of study medication were analysed based on the narrow BIcMQ (Table 31. )

AEs leading to lower limb amputation (LLA) 
These  events  were  only  analysed  for  trials  with  a  duration  of  longer  than  12  weeks  (i.e.  1245.110  and 
1245.121). The frequencies of patients with investigator-defined AEs leading to LLA up to trial completion 
were similar in the empagliflozin group (29 patients, 0.6%) and in the placebo group (33 patients, 0.7%); 
see Table 27. . Amputations were mostly minor (e.g. toe[s]) rather than major (empagliflozin: 8 patients 
[0.2%], placebo: 7 patients [0.1%]; e.g. above the knee). Most common reasons for the first LLA were 
untreatable/necrotising infection and ischaemic reasons.  
Investigator-defined AEs leading to LLA (reported as AESIs during the on-treatment period) were reported 
for 21 patients (0.4%) in the empagliflozin group and 23 patients (0.5%) in the placebo group. 
Subgroups  were  analysed  by  baseline  eGFR,  diabetes  status,  presence  of  a  previous  amputation,  and 
history of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The results were consistent with the main analysis of AEs 
leading to LLA.

Urinary tract infection 
The frequency of patients with urinary tract infection (narrow sub BIcMQ) was higher in the empagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group (Table 32. ). The most frequently reported PT was urinary tract infection, 
which was mainly driving the difference between groups. Other PTs were reported with similar and/or low 
(≤0.2%) frequencies in both treatment groups.  
A similar trend as for urinary tract infection (narrow BIcMQ) was observed for the frequencies of patients 
with  complicated  urinary  tract  infections  and  patients  with  urinary  tract  infections  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation (Table 32. ).

Subgroup analyses were performed by age, sex, race, and baseline eGFR, diabetes status, and history of 
chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection. The results of the subgroup analyses were generally similar to 
the main analyses of urinary tract infections.  
Investigator-defined urinary tract infections (including urosepsis and acute pyelonephritis) were reported 
for 403 patients (7.7%) in the empagliflozin group and 338 patients (6.5%) in the placebo group. Urinary 
tract  infections  were  predominantly  infections  of  the  lower  urinary  tract  (bladder  and  below)  or 
asymptomatic bacteriuria. Most patients in both treatment groups had a single episode rather than multiple 
episodes of urinary tract infection.  
The trend observed in the analysis, including the PT urosepsis and pyelonephritis based on the narrow sub 
BIcMQ (empagliflozin: 30 patients [0.6%], placebo: 21 patients [0.4%]; Table 33. ) was similar to what 
was observed for urinary tract infection (narrow BIcMQ; presented above). Subgroup analyses by sex and 
diabetes status were performed for the PT urosepsis and pyelonephritis (narrow sub BIcMQ). The results 
showed an imbalance in female patients with urosepsis or pyelonephritis, with a higher frequency in the 
empagliflozin group than in the placebo group, and that events occurred in both patients with diabetes and 
patients without diabetes (Table 33. ).

Events of investigator-defined sepsis with source urinary tract infection or non-urinary tract infection were 
collected only in trials 1245.110, 1245.121, and 1245.148. Sepsis with an origin other than urinary tract 
infections  (investigator-defined)  was  reported  for  76  patients  (1.6%)  in  the  empagliflozin  group  and  for 
56 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group. The two EMPEROR trials contributed differently to the analysis of 
the pooled safety data (see below). No events were reported in trial 1245.148. 
In trial 1245.121, sepsis with an origin other than urinary tract infections (investigator-defined, including 
those with missing origin) was reported for 28 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and for 14 patients 
(0.8%) in the placebo group. The difference in frequency could not be attributed to specific PTs. All cases 
were medically reviewed, and no clear pattern regarding the source of non-urinary tract infection sepsis 
could  be  observed.  In  trial 1245.110,  the  frequencies  of  patients  with  sepsis  with  an  origin  other  than 
urinary  tract  infections  (investigator-defined)  were  balanced  between  treatment  groups  (empagliflozin: 
48 patients [1.6%], placebo: 43 patients [1.4%]). 
Genital infection 
Genital  infections  (based  on  narrow  BIcMQ)  were  reported  for  more  patients  in  the  empagliflozin  group 
than in the placebo group (Table 34. ). The most frequent PTs in the empagliflozin group were vulvovaginal 
mycotic  and  vulvovaginal  candidiasis.  Genital  infections  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  were 
infrequent, although they showed the same trend. No difference between treatment groups was observed 
in the frequencies of patients with complicated genital infections (Table 34. ).

Investigator-defined  genital  infections  were  reported  for  115  patients  (2.2%)  in  the  empagliflozin  group 
and  32  patients  (0.6%)  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  patients  with  genital  infections  had  a  single episode 
rather than multiple episodes. 
Volume depletion and hypotension 
The frequency of patients with volume depletion (narrow BIcMQ), including hypotension (BIcMQ, subset of 
volume depletion), was higher in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (Table 36. ). The most 
frequently reported PT was hypotension, which was also analysed separately as BIcMQ. Hypotension based 
on the BIcMQ was reported for 499 patients (9.6%) in the empagliflozin group and for 430 patients (8.3%) 
in the placebo group. In the BIcMQ analysis, there was no other PT which predominantly accounted for the 
difference in frequencies. The same trend as in the analysis of all events was observed in the analysis of 
volume depletion (narrow BIcMQ) or hypotension (BIcMQ) leading to treatment discontinuation (which were 
infrequent) and in the analysis of serious volume depletion (narrow BIcMQ) or serious hypotension (BIcMQ; 
Table 36. ).

Subgroup analyses for hypotension (BIcMQ) were performed by age, sex, race, baseline eGFR, diabetes 
status, blood pressure, and use of certain medications. The results of the subgroup analyses were consistent 
with the main analysis of hypotension. 
The  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  for  volume  depletion  (narrow  BIcMQ;  by  age,  sex,  race,  baseline

the main analysis of volume depletion and with those for hypotension.  
The analysis of clinically relevant investigator-defined symptomatic hypotension events (Table 37. ) showed 
the same trend as the analysis of hypotension (BIcMQ) presented above.

Hypoglycaemia 
The frequencies of patients with confirmed hypoglycaemic events were balanced between treatment groups 
(Table 27. ). No imbalance in confirmed hypoglycaemic events was observed in the subgroup analysis by 
diabetes status. The remaining subgroup analyses (i.e. by age, sex, race, and baseline eGFR) also showed 
no relevant difference between treatment groups.  
Consistent  results  were  obtained  for  the  SMQ-based  analysis:  124 patients  (2.4%)  in  the  empagliflozin 
group and 134 patients (2.6%) in the placebo group had hypoglycaemic events based on the narrow SMQ.  
Investigator-defined  hypoglycaemic  events  were  reported  for  122  patients  (2.3%)  in  the  empagliflozin 
group and 132 patients (2.5%) in the placebo group. Of those patients, similar proportions in both groups 
had  hypoglycaemic  events  that  required  assistance  (empagliflozin:  30 patients  [0.6%],  placebo:  28 
patients [0.5%]). Most patients had 1 or 2 confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes rather than ≥3 episodes). 
The  severity  of  hypoglycaemic  AEs  (investigator-defined)  was  summarised  by  diabetes  status.  The 
proportions of patients with severe hypoglycaemic events that required assistance were similar between 
treatment groups, and the events occurred predominantly in patients with T2DM (empagliflozin: 28 patients 
[1.1%], placebo: 26 patients [1.0%]) rather than in patients with pre-diabetes (empagliflozin: 1 patient 
[0.1%], placebo: 2 patients [0.1%]) or in patients without (pre-) diabetes (empagliflozin: 1 patient [0.1%], 
placebo: none).  
Symptomatic hypoglycaemic  episodes  with  a blood  glucose  level  <54  mg/dL  and  no  assistance  required 
were less frequently reported in the empagliflozin group (32 episodes, 0.40 episodes/100 pt-yrs) than in 
the  placebo  group  (128  episodes,  1.61 episodes/100  pt-yrs).  For  other  categories  of  symptomatic  or 
asymptomatic  hypoglycaemic  episodes,  there  was  no  marked  imbalance  in  the  frequencies  between 
treatment groups.  
Bone fracture 
The frequencies of patients with bone fracture (BIcMQ) were similar between treatment groups (Table 39. 
).  No  relevant  difference  between  treatment  groups  was  observed  for  bone  fractures  leading  to 
discontinuation, or reported as SAEs, or when including the events up to trial completion (Table 27. ). There 
were no relevant differences between treatment groups in subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, baseline 
eGFR, and diabetes status. 
Investigator-defined bone fractures were reported for 179 patients (3.4%) in the empagliflozin group and 
for 171 patients (3.3%) in the placebo group. Bone fractures were more frequently classified as traumatic 
rather than as non-traumatic (Table 39. ).

Urinary tract malignancy 
The frequencies of patients with urinary tract malignancies (broad sub BIcMQs) were similar between the 
empagliflozin group (18 patients, 0.4%) and the placebo group (14 patients, 0.3%; Table 27. ) in patients 
with a cumulative exposure of ≥6 months when events up to trial completion were considered. Consistent 
results were obtained for the overall population regardless of exposure (empagliflozin: 28 patients [0.5%], 
placebo: 22 patients [0.4%]; analysis also considered events up to trial completion; Table 27. ). 
Constipation 
In SAF-HF1, the PT constipation was reported for more patients in the empagliflozin group (153 patients, 
2.9%) than in the placebo group (107 patients, 2.1%). Few patients had serious events or events leading 
to treatment discontinuation (Table 40. ). The trend was generally observed in both EMPEROR trials and 
across all subgroups, including by diabetes status.

Unexpected AEs 
Fall 
Previously,  in  trial  1245.121  (EMPEROR-Reduced),  the  PT  fall  was  reported  for  more  patients  in  the 
empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. However, this imbalance was not observed in trial 1245.110 
(EMPEROR-Preserved). When all 5 trials in patients with HF were pooled in SAF-HF1, the EMPEROR trials 
contributed almost all events of fall, and no obvious imbalance in fall was observed (Table 41. ).

Considering the late divergence in falls between treatment groups (after about 8 months in trial 1245.121), 
the  lack  of  a  plausible  pathophysiological  cause  related  to  empagliflozin’s  mode  of  action  (e.g.  via 
hypotension,  volume  depletion,  hypoglycaemia),  and  the  lack  of  consistency  between  the  clinical  trial 
results  (of  trials  1245.121  and  1245.25),  the  small  numerical  imbalance  in  the  PT  fall  observed  in  trial 
1245.121  was  likely  due  to  random  variation  associated  with  a  large  number  of  comparisons  between 
treatment groups in the safety analyses. 
No obvious pattern in the PT fall was observed in the subgroup analyses of the EMPEROR trials. Numerically 
more patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group experienced fall in the Asian subgroup 
in both trials, while in the White and Black/African American subgroups of trial 1245.110, the trend was 
opposite with fewer patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (Table 42. ).

In Asian patients, no event led to treatment discontinuation and serious events were infrequent (Table 43. 
).

15.3.1.2.4: 5] 
In addition, each event of fall in the Asian patients of trial 1245.110 was extensively medically reviewed 
for  the  origin  of  the  fall.  The  incidence  of  fall  started  to  diverge  between  treatment  groups  after  about 
1 year.  No  plausible  pathophysiological  cause  related  to  empagliflozin’s  mode  of  action  (e.g.  via 
hypotension, volume depletion, hypoglycaemia) could be identified. The imbalance appeared to be mainly 
due to accidental falls, i.e. reported by the investigator as “accidental fall” or “mechanical fall” which implied 
an external force (e.g. environmental) or due to other causes (e.g. “slipped”, “stumbled”, etc.).  
In conclusion, considering the late divergence in falls between treatment groups, the lack of a plausible 
pathophysiological  cause  related  to  empagliflozin’s  mode  of  action,  and  the  lack  of  consistency  in  other 
subgroups (including other races), the small numerical imbalance in the PT fall observed in Asian patients 
was  likely  due  to  random  variation  associated  with  a  large  number  of  comparisons  between  treatment 
groups and among subgroups in the safety analyses. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The overall frequency of patients with SAEs was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. 
Serious adverse events were most commonly reported in the SOC cardiac disorders. On the PT level, cardiac 
failure,  pneumonia,  acute  kidney  injury,  atrial  fibrillation,  and  cardiac  failure  congestive  were  most 
common. All other SAEs by PT were reported for <2.0% of patients in either group (Table 44. ). 
In  addition,  all-cause  and  HF-related  hospitalisations  and  all-cause  mortality  were  analysed  as  efficacy 
endpoints  in  the  two  EMPEROR  trials.  In  both  trials,  the  risks  of  heart  failure  hospitalisations,  recurrent 
heart failure hospitalisations, and investigator-defined CV hospitalisations were reduced with empagliflozin 
treatment compared with placebo. Also, in both trials, the cause of each death was adjudicated by the CEC, 
and the incidences of all-cause mortality were similar between treatment groups.

1  Deaths not  attributed  to  another  PT  by  the  investigator.  The  frequencies  of  patients  with fatal  AEs  were  balanced  between treatment  groups  (see  Error! 
Reference source not found.) 
Source data: [SCS appendix 2, c35146126, Table 2.1.1.7] 
Laboratory findings 
A  summary  of  patients  with  elevated  serum  creatinine  in  SAF-HF1  is  provided  above  (Decreased  renal 
function). Renal function parameters were also analysed as efficacy endpoints in the long-term outcome 
trials.  A  summary  of  patients  with  elevated  liver  enzymes  in  SAF-HF1  is  also  provided  above  (Hepatic 
injury). 
Safety  laboratory  analyses  at  trial  level  are  presented  in  CTRs.  In  trials  1245.110  and  1245.121, 
haemoglobin and haematocrit values increased on treatment and then partially returned to baseline after 
treatment discontinuation in the empagliflozin group, with small decreases observed in the placebo group. 
There  was  a  decrease  in  uric  acid  (urate)  values  in  the  empagliflozin  group  compared  with  the  placebo 
group.  After  treatment  discontinuation,  uric  acid  values  returned  towards  baseline  in  the  empagliflozin 
group. There were no relevant alterations in the other safety laboratory parameters. In the 12-week trials, 
the trends were consistent with those observed in 1245.110 and 1245.121. 
Vital sign, physical findings and other observation related to safety 
No meaningful changes in blood pressure (systolic or diastolic) or in heart/pulse rate were observed with 
empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo in any of the HF trials. There were no relevant differences

in new ECG findings after baseline between empagliflozin and placebo. No pregnancy was reported other 
than a spontaneous abortion as an AE in trial 1245.121. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of AEs were carried out by demographic and baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, 
geographic  region,  ethnicity,  diabetes  status  at  baseline,  baseline  eGFR,  baseline  blood  pressure,  and 
baseline use of ACE-inhibitor/ARB/ARNi, diuretics, or loop/high-ceiling diuretics). 
In  SAF-HF1,  the  AE  profile  in  subgroups  was  generally  consistent  with  that  of  the  overall  population, 
including the subgroups by diabetes status and by eGFR categories at baseline (including patients with an 
eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). No relevant difference in the AE profile was observed between patients with 
HFrEF and patients with HFpEF.  
Age 
Adverse events by age categories were generally consistent with the overall AE profile of the pooled safety 
data (Table 45. ).

Source data: [SCS, c35218777, Section 5.1.6] 
Use in pregnancy and lactation  
The use of empagliflozin during pregnancy and lactation was not specifically studied in the HF trials. See 
the currently approved product information of empagliflozin for more information. 
A spontaneous abortion was reported as an AE in trial 1245.121. No pregnancies were reported in trials 
1245.168, 1245.167, 1245.148, or 1245.110. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug  interactions  were  not  specifically  studied  in  the  HF  trials.  See  the  currently  approved  product 
information of empagliflozin for more information. For subgroup analyses by certain medications (i.e. ACE-
inhibitors/ARB/ARNi, diuretics, loop/high-ceiling diuretics) at baseline, see below.

On  17 Jun  2021,  empagliflozin  was  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  in  patients  with  HFrEF  (with  or  without 
T2DM). There has been no substantial post-marketing experience in these patients. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  SAF-HF1,  10408  patients  were  treated,  and  28.2%  of  patients  prematurely  discontinued  study 
medication (including patients who died). More than 70% of patients had an exposure for at least 52 weeks. 
The exposure is considered acceptable to perform a safety evaluation.  
The number of AEs and severe AEs were similar for empagliflozin compared to placebo, but the number of 
cardiac events were lower for empagliflozin vs. placebo. A similar number of total AEs could therefore result 
from a larger number of other AEs. Based on the most frequently reported AEs, this number of events is 
also  similar  for  empagliflozin  compared  to  placebo,  except  for  hypotension  (empagliflozin  372  (7.1%) 
placebo  313  (6.0%))  and  urinary  tract  infections  (empagliflozin  314  (6.0%)  placebo  259  (5.0%)). 
Hypotension is a known side-effect for SGLT2i treatment and can be related to other symptoms, such as 
syncope and fall, discussed below. Urinary tract infections and genital infections are also known side effects 
of SGLT2i treatment.  
The safety analyses in SAF-HF1 were also performed focused on AESIs and specific AEs. The numbers of 
events  with  acute  renal  failure  (empagliflozin 547  (10.5%),  placebo  587  (11.3%)),  keto-acidosis  (broad 
BIcMQ:  empagliflozin  63  (1.2%),  placebo  77  (1.5%);  narrow  BIcMQ:  empagliflozin  4  (0.1%),  placebo 6 
(0.1%))  and  hepatic  injury  (empagliflozin  197  (3.8%),  placebo  248  (4.8%))  were  not  larger  for 
empagliflozin compared to placebo. The number of AEs leading to LLA was also similar between placebo 
and  empagliflozin  treatment  (empagliflozin  29  (0.6%),  placebo  33  (0.7%)),  both  for  patients  with  and 
without  diabetes.  The  numbers  of  bone  fractures  (empagliflozin  179  (3.4%),  placebo  171  (3.3%))  and 
confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  (empagliflozin  101  (1.9%),  placebo  108  (2.1%))  were  also  similar  for 
empagliflozin  vs.  placebo,  except  for  hypoglycaemic  events  in  T1DM,  but  this  consisted  of  a  very  small 
number  of  events  and  therefore  not  contributing  to  the  evaluation  (empagliflozin  2/5  (40%),  placebo 
1/5(20%)).  
As expected from previous safety evaluation and reported ADRs, urinary tract infections (empagliflozin 402 
(7.7%), placebo 335 (6.4%)) and genital infections (empagliflozin 101 (1.9%), placebo 35 (0.7%)) were 
more common in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The number of complicated urinary 
tract  infections,  urosepsis  or  pyelonephritis,  was  also  more  in  the  empagliflozin  group  vs  placebo.  The 
treatment difference was most pronounced in female patients for urosepsis or pyelonephritis (empagliflozin 
20/1895 (1.1%), placebo 6/1915 (0.3%)) and for patients without diabetes (empagliflozin 15/2633 (0.6%), 
placebo 8/2620 (0.3%)). It is known that female subjects are more susceptible for urinary tract infection, 
and  this  may  partly  explain  the  increased  incidence  in  female  subjects  with  empagliflozin  treatment. 
Patients  without  diabetes  normally  do  not  have  glucosuria,  but  this  is  altered  by  SGLT2i  treatment  and 
could  therefore  increase  the  risk  of  urinary  tract infection.  The number  of  complicated  genital infections 
was similar between empagliflozin and placebo (empagliflozin 14 (0.3%), placebo 14 (0.3%)). Urinary tract 
infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, and genital infections are included in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. The current observations are in line with the described ARD in the SmPC.   
Volume depletion was also more frequent with empagliflozin treatment (empagliflozin 566 (10.9%), placebo 
483  (9.3%)),  including the  number of  symptomatic  hypotension  and  syncope.  Serious  volume  depletion 
events  were  also  more  frequent  with  empagliflozin  treatment  (empagliflozin  113  (2.2%),  placebo  91 
(1.7%)).  During  treatment  with  empagliflozin,  the  intensity  of  diuretic  therapy  or  non-diuretic  anti-
hypertensive therapy was more frequently reduced. Volume depletion, including hypotension, is described 
in  Section  4.4  and  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  The  current  observations  are  in  line  with  de  described  ARD  in  the 
SmPC.

In the EMPEROR Reduced trial, falls were reported for more patients in the empagliflozin vs the placebo 
group. In the current SAF-HF1, the treatment difference in the number of reported falls is less pronounced 
(empagliflozin 261 (5.0%), placebo 249 (4.8%)). In the EMPEROR preserved trial, the number of falls is 
similar for the empagliflozin group vs placebo (empagliflozin 213 (7.1%), placebo 219 (7.3%)), but falls 
were  reported  much  more  frequent  in  the  EMPEROR  preserved  trial  compared  to  the  EMPEROR-reduced 
(empagliflozin 43 (2.3%), placebo 27 (1.4%)). This is probably due to a difference in the study population 
(e.g. difference in percentage of female subjects). The difference between treatments in reported falls in 
the SF-HF1 and EMPEROR-preserved is considered small. The number of falls was also more frequent in 
the  Asian  subgroup  with  empagliflozin  vs  placebo.  This  was  present  in  both  the  EMPEROR-reduced 
(empagliflozin 6/337 (1.8%), placebo 1/334 (0.3%)) and EMPEROR-preserved trial (empagliflozin 39/413 
(9.4%), placebo 26/411 (6.3%)). The Applicant describes that each event of fall in the Asian patients of 
EMPEROR-preserved trial was extensively medically reviewed for the origin of the fall and that this did not 
lead  to  plausible  pathophysiological  causes  and  was  not  related  to  empagliflozin’s  mode  of  action 
(hypotension, volume depletion, hypoglycaemia), but mainly due to accidental falls. 
Constipation is consistently more frequently reported in the empagliflozin group compared to placebo 
group and is included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
In the SAF-HF1, the number of serious adverse events was not larger for empagliflozin compared to placebo 
(empagliflozin 2250 (43.1%), placebo 2502 (48.1%)).The reported number of myocardial infarctions and 
ischaemic  stroke  was  slightly  more  for  empagliflozin  vs  placebo  (myocardial  infarction:  empagliflozin  53 
(1.0%), placebo 44 (0.8%); ischaemic stroke: empagliflozin 61 (1.2%), placebo 55 (1.1%)). However, the 
differences between treatments are considered very small. This finding may be related to chance and this 
will not be pursued further.  
The Applicant performed subgroup analyses to evaluate safety in special populations. As expected, the 
total number of AEs are reported more frequently in the older age groups, but similar for empagliflozin 
compared to placebo treatment. Volume depletion and genital infection are in general more frequent in 
the empagliflozin group, but the difference in frequency empagliflozin vs. placebo appears more 
pronounced in elderly patients (>75years). Elderly patients appear, therefore, more vulnerable for these 
side effects. The increased risk for volume depletion in elderly patients is described in Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. For genital infections (Age 50-<65 empagliflozin 19 (1.6%), placebo 8 (0.7%); age 65-<75: 
empagliflozin 32 (1.7%), placebo 10 (0.5%); age 75-<85 empagliflozin 43 (2.6%), placebo 11 (0.7%)), 
the increased risk in elderly is considered only mildly elevated and is not deemed necessary to be 
included in section 4.8.   
As  expected,  the  number  of  AEs  is  more  in  the  lower  eGFR  subgroups  compared  to  the  higher  eGFR 
subgroups,  as  the  low  eGFR  subgroups  represent  a  more  vulnerable  patient  population.  The  effect  of 
empagliflozin treatment on volume depletion appears larger in the eGFR subgroup 45-<60 compared to the 
higher eGFR subgroups (eGFR 60 - <90: empagliflozin 185 (8.6%), placebo 175 (8.2%); eGFR 45-<60: 
empagliflozin 182 (13.8%), placebo 121 (9.1%)). However, in the eGFR subgroup 30 -<45 (empagliflozin 
117  (12.0%),  placebo  122  (12.4%)),  there  was  no  difference  in  volume  depletion  frequency  between 
empagliflozin and placebo and the observation for the eGFR subgroup 45 -<60 is therefore not consistently 
observed.    
There  was  no  difference  in  the  number  or  the  type  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  between  the 
empagliflozin group and the placebo group. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with HF, with or without diabetes, appears in general similar 
to the safety profile in patients with HFrEF and/or T2DM. No new large safety issues have been identified.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic  heart  failure  is  a  progressive  syndrome  characterised  by  the  inability  of  the  heart  to  provide 
adequate blood supply to meet the metabolic demand of different tissues, or the heart can only provide 
adequate  blood  supply  at  the  expense  of  elevated  left  ventricular  filling  pressure.  Symptoms  include 
dyspnoea (shortness of breath), oedema (build-up of fluid in the body tissues), persistent coughing and 
wheezing (due to build-up of fluid in the lungs), tiredness or fatigue, reduced appetite or nausea, confusion, 
disorientation, and increased heart rate. 
Worldwide, heart failure has a prevalence of 1% to 2% and affects over 64 million people as of 2017. In 
the US alone the prevalence is 6.2 million, and this number has been projected to grow to over 8 million 
by 2030. HF is associated with premature mortality and frequent hospitalisations. HF contributes to 1 in 9 
deaths, and the estimated 5-year survival is about 50% at the time of diagnosis. HF is the leading cause 
of hospitalisation in patients above 65 years of age.  
Patients  with  HF  are  categorised  according  to  measurements  of  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF); 
patients with LVEF ≤40% are considered to have HFrEF, and those with LVEF >50% are considered to have 
HFpEF. LVEF of >40% to <50% is considered as HFpEF in many clinical trials and registries, although more 
recently, the term HF  with “mid-range” EF (HFmEF) was introduced to categorise this group separately. 
The relative prevalence of HFpEF among HF patients is approximately 50% and appears to be increasing. 
HFrEF and HFpEF differ in several aspects, including underlying aetiologies, demographics, co-morbidities, 
and responses to treatment. Patients with HFpEF tend to be older, more often women, and more likely to 
have a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation than patients with HFrEF. Although HFpEF and HFrEF 
have  similarly  profound  impacts  on  patient  quality of  life  and  prognosis,  historically,  therapies  shown to 
improve prognosis in patients with HFrEF do not seem to be effective in patients with HFpEF. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
HFrEF  can  be  treated  with  drugs  that  act to  attenuate  the  overactivation of  endogenous neurohormonal 
systems. The therapeutic options for patients with HFpEF are limited. 
Recommendations for the treatment of HFrEF include the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEi),  angiotensin  receptor  blockers  (ARB),  angiotensin  receptor-neprilysin  inhibitors  (ARNi),  beta-
blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and the use of implantable devices like ICD and 
CRT, all of which have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF.  
For patients with HFpEF, no therapy has been proven to be superior to control based on the pre-specified 
primary endpoint in any prior pivotal clinical outcome study in patients with HFpEF. According to the current 
guidelines, the management of HFpEF involves control of congestive symptoms, usually with diuretics, and 
the  treatment  of  co-morbidities.  A  lack  of  therapeutic  options  that  can  reduce  the  risk  of  mortality  and 
hospitalisation in these patients represents an unmet medical need. 
Empagliflozin 
Empagliflozin  (Jardiance)  is  an  orally  administered,  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  the  human  sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2) developed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). By inhibition of SGLT 2 in the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022

kidneys,  empagliflozin  reduces  the  reabsorption  of  glucose  by  the  kidneys  leading  to  increased  urinary 
glucose excretion and, in consequence, to a lowering of blood glucose. Empagliflozin is approved for the 
treatment of T2DM worldwide as an adjunct therapy to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in 
adults with type 2 diabetes. In the United States and several other countries, it is also approved to reduce 
the risk of CV death in patients with T2DM and established CV disease. On 17 Jun 2021 empagliflozin was 
approved in the EU for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction based on the EMPEROR-
Reduced study (1245.121) results. 
Empagliflozin  exerts  its  effect  by  preventing  sodium  and  glucose  reabsorption.  While  natriuresis  will  be 
compensated within days of drug administration through changes in tubulo-glomerular feedback, glucosuria 
will last for as long as the medication is used. This leads to long-lasting hemodynamic changes associated 
with modest osmotic diuresis, blood pressure-lowering effect, improvement in arterial stiffness, reduction 
in  oxidative  stress,  and  decrease  in  rate  pressure  product,  an  indirect  measure  of  myocardial  oxygen 
demands,  with  no  increase  in  HR  and  no  effect  on  sympathetic  nerve  activity.  The  non-glycosuric 
physiological  and  hemodynamic  adaptations  under  empagliflozin  may,  therefore,  provide  benefits  for 
patients with HF with or without diabetes. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Based  on  the  results  of  trial  1245.25  (EMPA-REG  OUTCOME)  in  patients  with  T2DM  and  established  CV 
disease,  BI  initiated  a  phase  III  program  for  empagliflozin  10  mg  once  daily  in  chronic  heart  failure 
regardless of diabetes status, including two pivotal CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR”) in patients with HFrEF 
and HFpEF. 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial 1245.110, BI sought an extension of indication, i.e. for the treatment 
of symptomatic chronic heart failure.  
EMPEROR-preserved – trial 1245.110 
Trial 1245.110 was carried out at 622 clinical sites in 23 countries in Europe, Latin America, North America, 
Asia, and others (South Africa, Australia, India). In total, 5988 patients were randomised to double-blind 
empagliflozin 10 mg (2997 patients) or placebo (2991 patients) once-daily treatment. Randomisation was 
stratified by region, diabetes history, LVEF, and eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr at screening. Patients were to be treated 
with randomised study medication in addition to standard of care (in accordance with local/international 
guidelines) until the required number of patients with adjudicated primary endpoint events was expected 
to be reached. The median exposure to study medication was about 23 months. After the last intake of 
study medication, patients were to be followed up for 30 days.  
The aim of the EMPEROR-preserved trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin versus 
placebo on top of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with HFpEF. The primary endpoint was the 
time  to  the  first  event  of  adjudicated  CV  death  or  adjudicated  HHF.  The  two  key  secondary  endpoints

Patients  in  this  trial  represented  a  population  with  chronic  heart  failure  with  preserved  ejection  fraction 
(LVEF: 33.1% of patients had <50%, 34.4% had 50 to <60%, and 32.5% had ≥60%; mean 54.3%, SD 
8.8) with a NYHA class of II (81.5%), III (18.1%), or IV (0.3%, 18 patients). The average age was 71.9 
years (SD 9.4); 44.7% were women, 75.9% White, 13.8% Asian, and 4.3% Black/African American. About 
half of patients (48.9%) had T2DM; 10 patients (0.2%) had T1DM. Half of the patients (49.9%) had an 
eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (of whom 309 patients, 5.2%, had an eGFR of <30) at baseline. At study 
baseline,  patients  were  treated  with  drugs  for  symptoms  and  co-morbidities;  80.7%  of  patients  were

treated with ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNi, 86.3% with beta-blockers, 86.2% with diuretics (37.5% MRAs) and 
70.8%  with  lipid-lowering drugs.  Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  between  the 
treatment groups.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Cardiovascular endpoints 
CV death or HHF (primary endpoint) occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group (empagliflozin 415/2997, 13.8%; placebo 511/2991, 17.1%), and the risk of CV 
death  or  HHF  was  reduced  with  empagliflozin  treatment  compared  with  placebo  (HR  empagliflozin  vs 
placebo 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90). Adjudicated HHF (first or recurrent, key secondary endpoint) occurred 
in fewer patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88). 
Fewer patients were reported with CV death with empagliflozin versus placebo, but this difference was not 
statistically significant (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09). 
Renal endpoints 
An initial dip in eGFR was observed with empagliflozin treatment, followed by a slower decrease in eGFR 
over time. The change of eGFR slope from baseline (key secondary endpoint) showed a slower decline in 
eGFR in the empagliflozin group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.363 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year 
vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.861 to 1.865). The results for the composite renal endpoint (i.e. chronic dialysis, 
renal  transplant,  or  sustained  reduction  in  eGFR;  secondary/exploratory  endpoint)  are  similar  for 
empagliflozin  vs.  placebo  (empagliflozin  108/2997  (3.6%),  placebo  112/2991  (3.7%),  HR  0.95  95%  CI 
0.73  to  1.24).  The  proportion  of  patients  progressing  to  macroalbuminuria  (secondary/exploratory 
endpoint) was less with empagliflozin vs. placebo (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68, to 0.98).  
Mortality  
All-cause mortality was similar in both treatment groups (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15). The number of 
CV  death  are  described  above.  The  number  of  non-CV  death  was  larger  with  empagliflozin,  but  this 
difference was not statistically significant (empagliflozin 203/2997, placebo 183/2991, HR 1.13, 95% CI 
0.92 to 1.38). 
Patient reported outcomes 
The change from baseline in KCCQ clinical summary score was a secondary/exploratory endpoint. The mean 
treatment  difference  in  change  was  1.32,  95%  CI  0.45  to  2.19.  The  proportion  of  patients  achieving  a 
clinically  relevant  change  (i.e.  5  points)  was  larger  in  the  empagliflozin  group  compared  to  placebo 
(empagliflozin 1126 patients, 41.7%; placebo 1034 patients, 38.7%). 
Elderly patients 
In  elderly  patients,  i.e.  age  ≥  70  years,  the  point  estimate  of  treatment  effect  was  larger  compared  to 
patients  <  70  for  the primary  endpoint  (age  ≥70 years  HR  0.75,  95%  CI  0.64-0.95,  age  <70  years  HR 
0.88, 95% CI 0.70-1.11) and key secondary endpoint (HHF) (age ≥70 years HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82, 
age <70 years HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.67-1.26).

In addition, the applicant discussed efficacy results and the safety data of both EMPEROR trials in patients 
aged ≥85 years. The number of patients aged ≥85 years that were included is 483 patients. The data do 
not  suggest  that  patients  aged  ≥85  years  benefit  less  form  treatment  of  the  indication  of  chronic 
symptomatic heart failure. The efficacy in general appears similar. The safety profile also appears similar 
across the age groups. The applicant therefore concluded that “limited therapeutic experience” in the elderly 
population is no longer suitable and amended sections 4.2 and 4.4 in the SmPC and the Package Leaflet to 
remove the warning. The amendments proposed by the MAH are considered acceptable. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Effects independent of LVEF 
Although  HFpEF  has  been  defined  from  a  LVEF  >40%,  the  range  between  40  and  50%  is  currently 
considered HFmEF, and this group of patients may differ in the aetiology and treatment response compared 
to  patients  with  LVEF  >50%/HFpEF.  Retrospective  analyses  have  suggested  that  the  benefits  of 
neurohormonal antagonists in patients with HFrEF extend to those with a mildly reduced ejection fraction 
(Dewan P et al. Eur J Heart Fail 2020). This may affect the interpretation of the overall efficacy results. 
Stratified  randomisation  was  performed  for  LVEF  subgroups  (i.e.  LVEF  <50%,  LVEF  50-<60%  and  LVEF 
≥60%),  and  the  number  of  patients  was  equally  distributed  between  the  LVEF  subgroups.  Subgroup 
analyses for LVEF were performed for the primary and key secondary endpoints. Although the p value for 
interaction was not significant (p=0.2098) for the primary endpoint (CV death or HHF), the effect was more 
pronounced in patients with LVEF <50% compared to ≥60%, but was still significant for the group LVEF 
50-<60% and remained positive for LVEF≥60% (LVEF <50% HR 0.71, 95%CI 0.57-0.88; LVEF 50-<60%, 
HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.64-0.99; LVEF >60%, HR 0.87, 95%CI 0.69-1.10). As the effect of empagliflozin on the 
primary endpoint was beneficial for all LVEF subgroups, the indication for the treatment of heart failure in 
patients with HFpEF is acceptable. As the indication for the treatment of heart failure is for all types of heart 
failure, the wording “for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure.” is considered acceptable.  
It could, however, be suggested that there is a modification of the treatment effect in subjects with 
higher LVEF for the key secondary endpoint, i.e. adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent), where the point 
estimate for the subgroup LVEF ≥60% is HR 1.06 (95%CI 0.76-1.46) and p for interaction 0.0077. This 
could indicate that patients with LVEF ≥60% benefit less from treatment with empagliflozin. The lower HR 
in the subgroup ≥70%, however, contradicts this suggestion, although the number of subjects was small 
in this subgroup. The analyses on the contribution of HHF events by number of events experienced per 
patient showed that only a small number of patients contributed to the high number of recurrent HHF in 
the empagliflozin group, which may contribute to the imbalance in the analysis of the first and recurrent 
HHF in this subgroup. This may be related to chance.   
Renal endpoints 
The change of eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr slope from baseline was a key secondary endpoint and showed a slower 
decline in eGFR in the empagliflozin group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.363 mL/min/1.73 m2 
per year. This endpoint has the limitation that a long treatment period, i.e. more than 2 years, is considered 
needed to confirm a beneficial effect. The effect on the renal composite endpoint is preferred for evaluation 
of renal effects. The effect of empagliflozin on the eGFR slope is not supported or confirmed by the observed 
effects on the composite renal endpoint (i.e. chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or sustained reduction in 
eGFR),  as  the  results  are  similar  for  empagliflozin  vs.  placebo  (empagliflozin  108/2997  (3.6%),  placebo 
112/2991 (3.7%), HR 0.95 95%CI 0.73, 1.24). However, the finding in the eGFR slope was supported by 
other additional pre-specified analyses, i.e. eGFR change from pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 113/120 
 
 
 
 
(follow-up;  FU)  analysed  with  ANCOVA,  “true  slope”  (annualised  change  from  pre-treatment  to  post-
treatment  weighted  by  time  of  FU  squared)  and  progression  to  or  reversal  from  macro-albuminuria. 
Although all exploratory, these findings indicate a consistent finding and this appears clinical relevant.  
Mortality 
All-cause mortality was similar in both treatment groups (HR 1.00, 95%CI 0.87 – 1.15). The number of 
non-CV  death  was  larger  with  empagliflozin,  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant 
(empagliflozin  203/2997,  placebo  183/2991,  HR  1.13,  95%CI  0.92  –  1.38).  The  Applicant  provided  an 
extensive evaluation of the causes of non-CV death and could not show a specific increase in a cause of 
death during empagliflozin treatment. A beneficial effect on all-cause mortality with empagliflozin treatment 
in patients with HFpEF could not be demonstrated.  
Patient reported outcomes 
A larger difference in change from baseline in KCCQ clinical summary was observed in the empagliflozin vs. 
placebo group. Although statistically significant, the treatment difference appears modest, and the clinical 
relevance is questionable. The proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant change (i.e. 5 points) 
was  not  defined  as  a  secondary  endpoint  and  resulted  in  a  larger  proportion  of  patients  with  clinically 
relevant change, but the difference in percentages is small. The treatment effects are considered small.  
Combined treatment  
Although effectiveness of treatment with ACEi/ARB, MRA’s and/or ARNI’s have not been demonstrated in 
patients with HFpEF, the majority of the patients used these treatments during the trial, i.e. ACEi/ARB’s, 
82.6%, MRA’s 46.0%, ARNI’s 4.4%. Empagliflozin was, therefore, evaluated on top of these medication, 
but these medications are not registered for the treatment of HFpEF. The Applicant described the baseline 
use of these agents in the trial population in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. The subgroup analysis for baseline 
use of ACEi/ARB/ARNI's and/or MRA's resulted in a similar risk reduction with empagliflozin vs. placebo for 
the primary and key secondary endpoints for patients using these agents compared to patients not using 
these  agents  at  baseline.  As  the  efficacy  of  empagliflozin  appears  consistent  with  vs  without  the  use  of 
these agents, it is considered acceptable that the indication for the treatment of HFpEF is independent of 
the baseline use of these agents. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In SAF-HF1, 10408 patients were treated and 28.2% of patients prematurely discontinued study medication 
(including  patients  who  died).  More  than  70%  of  patients  had  an  exposure  for  at  least  52  weeks.  The 
exposure is considered acceptable to perform a safety evaluation.  
Adverse events 
The  number  of  AEs  and  severe  AEs  were  similar  for  empagliflozin  compared  to  placebo  (any  AE; 
empagliflozin 81.4%, placebo 80.0%, severe AE; empagliflozin 26.5%, placebo 24.3%). Based on the most 
frequently reported AEs, this number of events is also similar for empagliflozin compared to placebo, except 
for hypotension (empagliflozin 372 (7.1%) placebo 313 (6.0%)) and urinary tract infections (empagliflozin 
314 (6.0%) placebo 259 (5.0%)).

Deaths, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
In the SAF-HF1, the number of serious adverse events was not larger for empagliflozin compared to placebo 
(empagliflozin 43.1%, placebo 48.1%). The frequencies of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study  medication  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  (empagliflozin  17.5%,  placebo  17.3%).  There 
was not a difference between the type of AEs leading to discontinuation between the empagliflozin group 
and the placebo group. Number of deaths/mortality did not differ between the treatment groups.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Urinary tract infections 
Urinary  tract  infections  (empagliflozin  402  patients  (7.7%),  placebo  335  patients  (6.4%))  were  more 
common in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The number of complicated urinary tract 
infections, urosepsis or pyelonephritis, was also more in the empagliflozin group vs placebo. The treatment 
difference was most pronounced in female patients for urosepsis or pyelonephritis (empagliflozin 20/1895 
(1.1%),  placebo  6/1915  (0.3%))  and  for  patients  without  diabetes  (empagliflozin  15  patients  (0.6%), 
placebo 8 patients (0.3%)). 
Genital infections 
Genital infections (empagliflozin 101 patients (1.9%), placebo 35 patients (0.7%)) were more common in 
the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The number of complicated genital infections was similar 
between empagliflozin and placebo (empagliflozin 14 patients (0.3%), placebo 14 patients (0.3%)). Genital 
infections with empagliflozin treatment were reported slightly more frequently in elderly patients (Age 50-
<65 empagliflozin 19 (1.6%), placebo 8 (0.7%); age 65-<75: empagliflozin 32 (1.7%), placebo 10 (0.5%); 
age 75-<85 empagliflozin 43 (2.6%), placebo 11 (0.7%)). 
Volume depletion  
Volume  depletion  was  also  more  frequent  with  empagliflozin  treatment  (empagliflozin  566  patients 
(10.9%), placebo 483 patients (9.3%)), including the number of symptomatic hypotension and syncope. 
Serious volume depletion events were also more frequent with empagliflozin treatment (empagliflozin 113 
patients (2.2%), placebo 91 patients (1.7%)). During treatment with empagliflozin, the intensity of diuretic 
therapy or non-diuretic anti-hypertensive therapy was more frequently reduced. 
Keto-acidosis 
Based on the broad BIcMQ, events suggestive of ketoacidosis were reported for 63 patients (1.2%) in the 
empagliflozin  group  and  for  77 patients  (1.5%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  narrow  BIcMQ  ketoacidosis 
included 4 patients (0.1%) in the empagliflozin group and 6 patients (0.1%) in the placebo group. 
Lower limb amputation 
The number of AEs leading to LLA was similar between placebo and empagliflozin treatment (empagliflozin 
29 (0.6%), placebo 33 (0.7%)), both for patients with and without diabetes. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 115/120 
 
 
 
 
Decreased renal function  
The numbers of events with acute renal failure (empagliflozin 547 patients (10.5%), placebo 587 patients 
(11.3%)) were not larger in the empagliflozin group compared to placebo.  
Hepatic injury 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  hepatic  injury  was  not  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  group  (197  patients 
(3.8%)) than in the placebo group (248 patients (4.8%)). The most frequent PTs were liver injury, hepatic 
function abnormal, and hepatic steatosis. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The numbers of confirmed hypoglycaemic events (empagliflozin 101 patients (1.9%), placebo 108 patients 
(2.1%)) were similar for empagliflozin vs. placebo, except for hypoglycaemic events in T1DM (empagliflozin 
2/5 (40%), placebo 1/5(20%)).  
Constipation 
Constipation was reported for more patients in the empagliflozin group (153 patients (2.9%)) than in the 
placebo  group  (107  patients  (2.1%)).  The  number  of  serious  events  or  events  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation was low in both treatment groups.   
Laboratory findings 
In trials 1245.110 and 1245.121, haemoglobin and haematocrit values increased on treatment and then 
partially  returned  to  baseline  after  treatment  discontinuation  in  the  empagliflozin  group,  with  small 
decreases  observed  in  the  placebo  group.  There  was  a  decrease  in  uric  acid  (urate)  values  in  the 
empagliflozin  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  After  treatment  discontinuation,  uric  acid  values 
returned towards baseline in the empagliflozin group.  
Vital signs 
No meaningful changes in blood pressure (systolic or diastolic) or in heart/pulse rate were observed with 
empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo in any of the HF trials. There were no relevant differences 
in new ECG findings after baseline between empagliflozin and placebo. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with HF, with or without diabetes, appears in general similar 
to  the  safety  profile  in  patients  with  T2DM.  However,  uncertainties  remain  about  several  unfavourable 
effects: 
Urinary tract infection 
Urinary tract infections were more common in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group and the 
difference was most pronounced in female patients for urosepsis or pyelonephritis. It is known that female 
subjects are more susceptible for urinary tract infection, and this may partly explain the increased incidence 
in  female  subjects  with  empagliflozin  treatment.  Urinary  tract  infections,  including  urosepsis  and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/102340/2022 
Page 116/120 
 
 
 
 
pyelonephritis,  are  included  in  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  The  current  observations  are  in  line  with  the 
described ADRs in the SmPC.   
Hypoglycaemia 
The  numbers  of  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  were  similar  for  empagliflozin  vs.  placebo,  except  for 
hypoglycaemic events in T1DM. But the latter consisted of a very small number of events (empagliflozin 
2/5 (40%), placebo 1/5(20%)) and does therefore not contribute to the evaluation for increased risk.  
Elderly patients 
As expected, the total AEs are reported more frequently in the older age groups, but similar for empagliflozin 
compared to placebo treatment. Volume depletion and genital infection are in general more frequent in the 
empagliflozin  group,  but  the  difference  in  frequency  vs.  placebo  appears  more  pronounced  in  elderly 
patients  (>75years).  Elderly  patients  appear,  therefore,  more  vulnerable  for  these  side  effects.  The 
increased risk for volume depletion in elderly patients is described in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. The increased 
risk for genital infections is not described in the SmPC, but this risk is considered only mildly elevated in 
elderly patients and is not deemed necessary to be included in section 4.8.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
HF is a progressive syndrome with a high global prevalence. A treatment-induced decrease in HF-related 
complications  such  as  HHF  and  CV  death  is  therefore  important.  Especially  for  patients  with  HFpEF,  the 
registered  treatment  options  are  limited.  The  finding  in  the  EMPEROR-preserved  trial  of  decreased 
occurrence of HHF or CV death with empagliflozin treatment (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.69 to 0.90) is considered 
an important benefit. During the trial period, the number of patients who would need to have been treated 
with  empagliflozin  to  prevent  one  primary  event  (NNT)  was  31  (95%CI  20  to  69).  Although  this  effect 
seems  mainly  due  to  the  decrease  in  HHF  and  to  a  lesser  extent  to  the  decrease  in  CV  death,  it  is  still 
regarded  as  clinically  relevant,  especially  as  the  normal  progression  of  HF  is  still  associated  with  a  high 
frequency  of  rehospitalizations.  Importantly,  there  was,  however,  no  benefit  on  all-cause  mortality.  The 
number of non-CV death was larger with empagliflozin, but this difference was not statistically significant. 
The Applicant provided an extensive evaluation of the causes of non-CV death and could not show a specific 
increase in a cause of death during empagliflozin treatment.  
This current application is an indication for the treatment of chronic heart failure independent of LVEF. For 
the primary endpoint a positive effect of empagliflozin treatment was observed overall and in all the pre-
defined  LVEF  subgroups. The  p  for  interaction  was  not  significant.  However,  for  the  secondary  endpoint 
(first and recurrent HHF) the HR point estimate and the level of precision for the subgroup LVEF ≥60% is 
1.06 (95%CI 0.76-1.46, p for interaction p=0.0077). This finding in subjects with LVEF ≥60% could indicate 
a decrease in efficacy in the higher LVEF subgroups for this endpoint. The lower HR in the subgroup ≥70%, 
however, contradicts this suggestions, although the number of subjects was small in this subgroup. The 
analyses on the contribution of HHF events by number of events experienced per patient showed that only 
a small number of patients contributed to the high number of recurrent HHF in the empagliflozin group, 
which may contribute to the imbalance in the analysis of the first and recurrent HHF in this subgroup. This 
may be related to chance. Based on these findings it is not considered supported that there is a decrease 
in efficacy in patients with higher LVEF.   
The finding of a slower eGFR slope decline with empagliflozin treatment (estimated difference in slope of 
1.733 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.669, 2.796; p<0.0001)), could be regarded as 
not convincing. Although this endpoint was a key secondary endpoint, the slope analysis modelling is better 
suited in providing descriptive information on renal outcomes than providing definitive statistical and clinical 
evidence of a renal effect as it is used now. The data on the eGFR slope were not supported by a beneficial 
effect  on  the  preferred  renal  composite  (secondary/exploratory)  outcome  endpoint  (i.e.  chronic  dialysis,

renal transplant, or sustained reduction in eGFR) (HR 0.95 95%CI 0.73 to 1.24). The results are also not 
fully  in  line  with  earlier  observations  in  patients  with  HFrEF  or  T2DM.  However,  the  finding  in  the  eGFR 
slope  was  supported  by  other  additional  pre-specified  analyses,  i.e.  eGFR  change  from  pre-treatment 
(baseline) to post-treatment (follow-up; FU) analysed with ANCOVA, “true slope” (annualised change from 
pre-treatment  to  post-treatment  weighted  by  time  of  FU  squared)  and  progression  to  or  reversal  from 
macro-albuminuria. Although all exploratory, these findings indicate a consistent finding and this appears 
clinical relevant. 
In  the  EMPEROR-preserved  trial,  the  KCCQ  ‘clinical  summary  score’  was  used  to  measure  as  a 
secondary/exploratory  endpoint  of  a  patient-reported  outcome.  Although  statistically  significant,  the 
treatment difference appears modest, and the clinical relevance is questionable. The Applicant also provided 
the proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant change (i.e. 5 points), but again the difference in 
percentages  is  small.  The  potential  beneficial  effects  of  empagliflozin  on  HF-related  symptoms  are  not 
established robustly and are, therefore, of questionable importance. 
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  in  patients  with  HFpEF  generally  revealed  no  new  large  safety  findings 
compared with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF and/or T2DM. The numbers 
of  reported  AEs  and  SAEs  were  equally  distributed  between  the  treatment  groups.  As  expected,  genital 
infections,  urinary  tract  infections  and  volume  depletion  were  more  reported  during  empagliflozin 
treatment, but these are known side-effects and included in the SmPC. They have previously not affected 
the benefit-risk balance to a negative ratio for the indication for the treatment of HFrEF and/or T2DM.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH agreed to amend the initially applied indication i.e.  
The final agreed indication is: 
Heart failure 
Jardiance is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction.  
The reduced incidence of HHF or CV death is an important benefit and significantly contributes to a positive 
B/R ratio. It is important to point out that this finding is mainly driven by an effect on HHF, as no relevant 
reduction in CV death was observed.  
A beneficial effect on the primary endpoint was observed across all LVEF subgroups and the indication for 
the treatment of heart failure in patients with HFpEF is acceptable. As the indication for the treatment of 
heart failure is for all types of heart failure, the wording “for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart 
failure.” is considered acceptable.  
Results on the key secondary endpoint, i.e. first and recurrent HHF, could indicate that there a decrease in 
effect in patients with higher LVEF (≥60%). Additional analyses, i.e. further subgroup analyses based on 
LVEF and analyses on the contribution of HHF events by number of events experienced per patient, suggest 
that this finding is related to chance.  
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  in  patients  with  HFpEF  generally  revealed  no  new  large  safety  findings 
compared with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF and/or T2DM.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Jardiance in the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to add the treatment of treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure based on 
the results from the clinical study 1245.110 EMPEROR-preserved. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and sections 1, 2 and 4 of the PIL are 
updated accordingly.  
Further, the MAH applied for an additional year of market protection. The updated RMP v 16.0 has also 
been submitted. 
In addition, the statement 'sodium free' was re-located from section 2 of the SmPC to section 4.4. to 
comply with EMA'S QRD guidance and minor linguistic changes to the national translations are included in 
this submission. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

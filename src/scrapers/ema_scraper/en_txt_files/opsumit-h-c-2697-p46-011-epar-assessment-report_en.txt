1.  Introduction 
On 01 July 2022, the MAH submitted a completed study including a subset of paediatric patients 
(Study No./acronym: AC-055H302/RUBATO OL) for Opsumit (macitentan), in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
Of the 111 patients (age range: 13 to 49 years) enrolled, 12 (10.8%) were paediatric subjects (age 
range: 13 to less than 18 years). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Macitentan (Opsumit) is an orally active endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), active on both 
endothelin (ET) ETA and ETB receptors, approved for marketing in the EU through the centralised 
procedure on 20 December 2013. Macitentan is currently approved by the European Commission as 10 
mg film-coated tablet for oral use for the following indication:  
“Opsumit, as monotherapy or in combination, is indicated for the long-term treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III. 
Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH 
associated with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple 
congenital heart disease (see section 5.1)”.  
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, the initial marketing authorisation 
application included an EMA Decision (P/0087/2012) on the agreement of an EU Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP; EMEA-001032-PIP01-10-M01) for oral use of macitentan as dispersible tablet 
and film-coated tablet for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) indication. The last 
EMA Decision (P/0480/2021) corresponding to the acceptance of a modification of an agreed PIP for 
macitentan for the treatment of PAH (EMEA-001032-PIP01-10-M04) was issued by December 2021.  
In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, Janssen-Cilag International NV 
hereby submits to the EMA a final study report for the study number AC-055H302 (acronym: RUBATO 
open-label [OL]).  
The MAH stated that study number AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) “Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, 
open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of macitentan in 
Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects” is a standalone study. As such, a line listing is not 
provided. 
AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) was a Phase 3 extension of the AC-055H301 (RUBATO double-blind [DB]) 
study. The results of Study AC-055H301/RUBATO DB, which did not meet the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints, were already submitted to the EMA for Opsumit (EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/010) in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006. 
Both AC-055H301/RUBATO DB and AC-055H302/RUBATO OL studies are part of the PIP for oral use of 
macitentan as dispersible tablet and film-coated tablet agreed upon for the treatment of functional 
single ventricle heart disease with total cavo-pulmonary connection indication (EMEA-001032-PIP03-
19; [Decision P/0242/2021]), but not for the PIP agreed to the treatment of PAH indication (EMEA-
001032-PIP01-M04; [Decision P/0480/2021]).

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The formulation of macitentan used in the study was the same as the product approved in the EU (i.e., 
10 mg film-coated tablets), which is intended to treat adult patients with PAH from World Health 
Organization FC II and III.  
No paediatric formulation was used. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study number AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL): “Prospective, multi-
center, single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of 
macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects”. 
AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) was a Phase 3 extension of the AC-055H301 (RUBATO double-blind [DB]) 
study. The OL study was stopped prematurely because the main DB study did not meet the primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Only 12/111 (10.8%) participants were paediatric subjects (age range: 13 to less than 18 years). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL): Prospective, multi-
center, single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, 
tolerability, and effectiveness of macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and 
adolescent subjects 
Description 
The RUBATO open-label (OL) study was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 3 extension of 
the RUBATO double-blind (DB) study to assess the long-term use of macitentan 10 mg in Fontan-
palliated adult and adolescent participants beyond the 52 weeks of treatment (macitentan 10 mg or 
placebo) in the RUBATO DB study. Participants were rolled over from the DB study to this OL study 
without knowledge of their previous study treatment. The RUBATO OL analyses included safety 
endpoints and exploratory efficacy endpoints.  
The study comprised the following 4 consecutive periods: 
- Enrollment period:  
The enrollment period for a participant began with the visit at Week 52 in the RUBATO DB study and 
signing of the informed consent form and lasted until the administration of the first dose in the 
RUBATO OL study (Visit 1). 
- Treatment period:  
The treatment period started with the administration of the first dose of macitentan 10 mg in the OL 
study and lasted until whichever of the following occurred first:

•  104 weeks (2 years) of study treatment for each participant after the last participant 
completed the RUBATO DB treatment period. 
The participant or investigator decided to discontinue the study intervention. 
The sponsor decided to stop the RUBATO OL study. 
• 
• 
- Safety follow-up (S-FU) period:  
For an individual participant, S-FU started on the day after the last dose of OL study intervention and 
ended 30 to 35 days thereafter with the EOS visit. 
- End-Of-Study:  
For an individual participant, the study was completed with the EOS visit. For all participants, EOS 
corresponded to the last visit performed in this RUBATO OL study. 
A diagrammatic representation of the study design is presented in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Study Design 
Where administration of RUBATO OL study intervention did not immediately follow End-of-Treatment 
(EOT) in the RUBATO DB study, the participant was to enter the normal DB S-FU period until 
administration of the first dose of the OL study intervention occurred.

Other Objectives: 
−  To assess the effect of macitentan on time to first occurrence of clinical worsening (or morbidity) 
events and VO2 at ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT). Due to the early termination of the 
study, other objectives (efficacy on other endpoints related to exercise capacity, effect on N-
terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and effect on pharmacoeconomic endpoints 
related to hospitalization) were not assessed. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
−  The primary endpoint for this study was safety and tolerability. 
Safety Endpoints

Results 
Participant flow 
In this OL extension study (Study Period: 03 May 2019 [first participant first visit] to 18 January 2022 
[last participant last visit]), 111 participants from de RUBATO DB study (54 participants from the 
placebo group [hereafter, DB-placebo] and 57 participants from the macitentan group [hereafter, DB-
macitentan]) were enrolled and received macitentan 10 mg once daily. Of these, 110 (99.1%) 
participants prematurely discontinued study intervention (Table 2) and study (Table 3).  
The main reason for premature study intervention discontinuation and study discontinuation was 
sponsor’s decision to terminate the OL study because the main DB study did not meet the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints (93/111 [83.8%] participants). Other reasons included death (1 
participant in the DB-placebo group) and COVID-19 related other non-medical reasons (1 participant in 
the in the DB-macitentan group).

Number analysed 
A total of 111 participants from the DB study (placebo group: 54, macitentan group: 57) were enrolled 
and received macitentan 10 mg in the OL study. 
Populations Analyzed 
The definitions of the analysis sets used in the OL extension study are described in Table 1. 
The RUBATO Pool Full Analysis Set included all 137 participants who were randomized in the DB study, 
irrespective of their enrollment in the OL extension study (Table 9). 
The RUBATO OL Extension Set included 111 participants from the DB study who enrolled in the OL 
extension study and received at least 1 dose of OL study treatment, i.e., macitentan 10 mg. The 
treatment group placebo/macitentan 10 mg corresponds to DB-placebo and macitentan 10 
mg/macitentan 10 mg corresponds to DB-macitentan 10 mg (Table 9). 
The Total Macitentan Analysis Set (Macitentan 10 mg pool) included 122 participants who received 
macitentan 10 mg in the DB study but did not enroll into the OL study (n=11), participants who 
received macitentan 10 mg in the DB as well as OL study (n=57), and participants who received 
macitentan 10 mg only in the OL study (n=54) (Table 9).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Macitentan is currently approved by the European Commission as 10 mg film-coated tablet for oral use 
for the following indication: “Opsumit, as monotherapy or in combination, is indicated for the long-term 
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II 
to III. Efficacy has been shown in a PAH population, including idiopathic and heritable PAH, PAH 
associated with connective tissue disorders, and PAH associated with corrected simple congenital heart 
disease”.  
This Article 46 procedure of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, concerns the submission of a stand-alone 
study, which is the AC-055H302 (RUBATO open-label [OL]) study named: “Prospective, multi-center, 
single-arm, open-label long-term study assessing the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of 
macitentan in Fontan-palliated adult and adolescent subjects”.   
AC-055H302/RUBATO OL study, was a Phase 3 extension of the already sumitted AC-
055H301/RUBATO double-blind (DB) study (Procedure No EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/010.1) to assess the 
long-term use of macitentan 10 mg for up to 104 weeks (2 years) in Fontan-palliated participants 
beyond 52 weeks (1 year) of treatment in the RUBATO DB study. Adult and adolescent participants 
were rolled over from the DB study to this OL study to receive macitentan 10 mg without knowledge of 
their previous study treatment (macitentan 10 mg or placebo, randomized in a 1:1 ratio). Both DB and 
OL RUBATO studies are part of an agreed PIP for macitentan for the treatment of functional single 
ventricle heart disease with total cavo-pulmonary connection indication (EMEA-001032-PIP03-19 
[Decision P/0242/2021]; PIP study 1 and PIP study 2, respectively). The primary objective of the 
hereby submitted study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability whereas the secondary and 
other objectives were to assess efficacy endpoints in an exploratory manner. The efficacy exploratory 
endpoints were the effect of macitentan on exercise capacity (change in Peak VO2) and on daily 
Physical Activity measured by Accelerometer (PA-Ac) as well as the effect on endpoints related to 
clinical events (time to first occurrence of clinical worsening or morbidity) and on change in VO2 at 
ventilatory anaerobic threshold [VAT]). The study design as well as the proposed objectives seem 
adequate for an OL extension study to describe the long-term effects of macitentan 10 mg in a target 
population where there are no approved medications for treatment. 
In this OL extension study (03 may 2019 [first participant first visit] to 18 January 2022 [last 
participant last visit]), 111 participants from de RUBATO DB study (54 participants from the placebo 
group [hereafter, DB-placebo group] and 57 participants from the macitentan group [hereafter, DB-
macitentan group]) were enrolled and received macitentan 10 mg film-coated tablets administered 
orally once-daily. Of the 111 participants enrolled, 10.8% of participants (12/111; DB-placebo group: 
6, DB-macitentan group: 6) were adolescents (12 to <18 years). All enrolled participants except 1 
(110/111 [99.1%]) prematurely discontinued the study intervention as well as the study. The main 
reason for premature study intervention discontinuation and study discontinuation was sponsor’s 
decision to terminate the OL study because the main DB study did not meet the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints (93/111 [83.8%] participants). With the exception of 1 adolescent participant (DB-
macitentan) who terminated study participation prematurely because of lack of efficacy, 11/12 
(91.7%) adolescent participants discontinued the study intervention and the study because of the 
sponsor’s decision. 
The majority of participants were white (87/111 [78.4%]) and male (77/111 [69.4%]). The median 
age at OL study start was 23.0 years (age range: 13 to 49 years). At OL study start, the median time 
since Fontan palliation completion was 19.46 years and 69/111 (62.2%) participants had lateral tunnel 
total cavopulmonary connection. A higher proportion of participants had an associated dominant left 
ventricular morphology (62/111 [55.9%]) compared with right/mixed morphology ( 49/111[44.1%]).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

At OL baseline, the majority of adolescent participants were in NYHA Class II (11/12 [91.7%]; DB-
macitentan group included the only subject in FC I) and the median (IQ range) peak VO2 at OL 
baseline was 24.20 (18.55, 29.50) mL/kg/min. The mean (SD) count per minute of daily PA-Ac at OL 
baseline was 288.69 (63.986) in the DB-placebo group (n=4) and 305.35 (146.667) in the DB-
macitentan group (n=6). No adolescent patients were on PAH specific therapies at baseline. The 
applicant has not provided information for the OL study in adolescents with respect to baseline 
characteristics such as time since Fontan palliation completion, type of primary TCPC Fontan 
completion or associated dominant ventricular morphology. However, it has to be kept on mind that as 
it was stated in the EMEA/H/C/002697/P46/010.1 assessment report for the completed rubato DB 
study, differences as regards baseline characteristics between paediatric and adult studied populations, 
which not only include the age, but also the type of TCPC or the type of functional ventricular heart 
among others, could still interfere with the interpretation of the treatment response. Therefore, it is 
considered that no further information is required. 
The exploratory efficacy variables were analyzed on the RUBATO Pool Full Analysis Set (N=137;  
participants enrolled in the OL study who received at least 1 dose of OL study intervention [i.e., 
macitentan 10 mg]) and RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111; data from the same participants 
randomized in DB were concatenated with their data from the OL extension study). For the analyses of 
the effect of macitentan on efficacy endpoints, obtained data were similar between the DB-placebo and 
DB-macitentan. These results are in line with those observed in the main DB study where the primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints were not met. 
Safety data were analyzed using the RUBATO OL Extension Set (N=111) and the Total Macitentan 
Analysis Set (macitentan 10 mg pool; included 122 participants who received macitentan 10 mg in the 
DB study but did not enroll into the OL study [n=11], participants who received macitentan 10 mg in 
both DB and OL studies [n=57], and participants who received macitentan 10 mg only in the OL study 
([n=54]). The median (IQ range) study intervention duration (regardless of interruption) and total 
exposure to study intervention (excluding interruptions) was 84.29 (52.14 to 110.86) weeks and 80.29 
(52.14 to 107.29) weeks, respectively. For adolescent participants, the median (IQ range) study 
intervention duration (regardless of interruption) Study treatment duration (weeks) and total exposure 
to study intervention (excluding interruptions) Total exposure to treatment was 105.00 (74.14 to 
130.71) weeks and 103.86 (73.86 to 122.29) weeks, respectively. Although RUBATO OL study did not 
last enough to be considered a purely long-term study, the obtained data are considered relevant to 
support data obtained from the RUBATO DB study.  
For RUBATO OL Extension Set, the proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE 
was 61.3% (68 participants; DB-placebo: 36/54 [66.7%], DB-macitentan: 32/57 [56.1%]). The most 
frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs (≥5% all participants) were COVID-19 (14 [12.6%] 
participants; DB-placebo: 6/54 [11.1%], DB-macitentan: 8/57 [14.0%]), headache (8 [7.2%] 
participants; DB-placebo: 4/54 [7.4%], DB-macitentan: 4/57 [7.0%]), fatigue (7 [6.3%] participants; 
DB-placebo: 3/54 [5.6%], DB-macitentan: 4/57 [7.0%], and palpitations (7 [6.3%] participants; DB-
placebo: 2/54 [3.7%], DB-macitentan: 5/57 [8.8%]). When adolescent particpants were assessed, the 
proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent AE was 66.7% (8/12 participants; DB-
placebo: 5, DB-macitentan: 3). The proportion of adolescent participants who had at least 1 
treatment-emergent SAE was 25.0% (3/12 participants; DB-placebo: 1, DB-macitentan: 2). No 
adolescent patients experienced AEs leading to death, related serious AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment. Overall, no unexpected or new safety findings were observed 
during the OL extension study. 
According to the submitted data, the AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) study results confirmed no clinically 
meaningful difference favouring macitentan that would provide treatment benefit to Fontan-palliated

patients. Moreover, safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of macitentan, with 
no new safety findings reported/observed during the study.  
Since the MAH does not claim for use of macitentan in Fontan-palliated patients on the basis of the 
lack of benefit versus placebo shown in the AC-055H301 (RUBATO DB) study and given that safety 
data reported in the RUBATO study are in line with the approved EU summary product characteristics 
(SmPC) for macitentan, it is considered that no further regulatory action is required.  
3.  CHMP Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The AC-055H302 (RUBATO OL) study submitted within this procedure was a Phase 3 extension of the 
AC-055H301 (RUBATO double-blind [DB]) study that was prematurely stopped because the main DB 
study did not meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Safety findings were in line with the 
known safety profile of macientan.  
Of the 111 patients (age range: 13 to 49 years) enrolled, 12 (10.8%) participants were paediatric 
subjects (age range: 13 to less than 18 years). 
Recommendation 
Since the MAH does not claim for use of macitentan in Fontan-palliated patients on the basis of the 
lack of benefit versus placebo shown in the AC-055H301 (RUBATO) study and given that safety data 
reported in the RUBATO study are in line with the approved EU summary product characteristics 
(SmPC) for macitentan, it is considered that no further regulatory action is required. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Actual dates 
30 January 2020 
Rituximab (MabThera) is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to B-lymphocyte 
antigen CD20, a transmembrane protein that is present on B-lymphocytes which are implicated in 
lymphoma, leukemia and specific autoimmune diseases such as anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody 
(ANCA)-associated vasculitis which include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA).  The binding of rituximab to CD20 on B-lymphocytes promotes B-cell lysis via a 
number of different possible mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis.  
Mabthera is currently registered in the following indications: 
Non Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
MabThera is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III IV follicular 
lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy.  
MabThera maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients 
responding to induction therapy.  
MabThera monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III IV follicular lymphoma who 
are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy.  
MabThera is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
prednisolone) chemotherapy.  
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
MabThera in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously 
untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for 
patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including MabThera or patients refractory to 
previous MabThera plus chemotherapy. 
See section 5.1 for further information. 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
MabThera in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other disease 
modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor 
therapies. 
MabThera has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X ray and 
to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 6/102 
 
 
 
 
MabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
Pemphigus vulgaris 
MabThera is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV). 
Childhood- and adult-onset GPA and MPA are rare, potentially life- and organ-threatening systemic 
autoimmune diseases affecting small and medium-sized blood vessels. The most commonly affected 
organs in GPA and MPA include the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and trachea), kidneys, lungs 
and skin.  Blood vessels in affected organs may become inflamed, and clusters of certain cells 
(granulomas) may occur.  The onset of GPA or MPA may be slow with few symptoms, or rapid with 
severe progression. If untreated, GPA and MPA progress from limited disease processes (e.g., 
inflammation centred on the upper respiratory tract or lung) to a generalized phase characterized by 
multiple systemic or renal complications of small-vessel vasculitis.  
Paediatric patients with GPA and MPA often present with clinical features of the disease similar to that 
of adult patients and share many signs and symptoms of the disease with adults (Calatroni et al. 
2017).  Childhood-onset GPA is associated with a higher prevalence of renal disease and nasal 
deformities at presentation and a higher overall incidence of subglottic stenosis over time than GPA in 
adults.  In comparison to adult patients, paediatric patients are more likely to have multiple organ 
involvement, renal involvement, lower respiratory tract manifestations, and subglottic stenosis (Cabral 
et al. 2009, Akikusa et al. 2007).   
Epidemiology 
The incidence of GPA in paediatric patients in Europe ranged from 1.2 to 1.4 per million. The incidence 
of MPA in paediatric patients in Europe ranged from 1 to 1.4 per million.  Within the US, the prevalence 
of GPA in paediatric patients ranged from 6.33 to 7.71 per million, and the prevalence of MPA in 
paediatric patients ranged from 2.73 to 3.51 per million.  The evidence suggests that GPA and MPA are 
extremely rare in populations <18 years. 
Current Treatment Options 
In current adult practice, induction therapy typically consists of high dose glucocorticoids combined 
with either cyclophosphamide or rituximab, in order to rapidly reduce inflammation, ideally induce 
disease remission, and prevent permanent organ damage.  In general, adverse effects of 
cyclophosphamide, including infertility, cytopenias, infections, bladder injury, and cancer, as well as 
the multiple adverse effects of lengthy courses of oral glucocorticoid treatment, are major causes of 
long-term morbidity and death. 
Currently, there are no specific guidelines or recommendations for the treatment of paediatric GPA and 
MPA and treatment is adapted from available adult data with no clear guidance on dosage or duration 
of therapy in paediatric patients.  Treatment decisions are based on clinical features of disease activity 
(as indicated by signs and symptoms of vasculitis) or remission, and corresponding laboratory tests 
including urinalysis for assessment of proteinuria, hematuria and worsening renal function. 
Unmet medical need 
There is a significant need to improve treatment options, as well as safety and efficacy outcomes, in 
paediatric GPA and MPA patients. Clinical trials and long-term outcome studies in paediatric vasculitis 
are lacking, except for retrospective analyses.  As there are no guidelines for the treatment of 
paediatric patients with GPA or MPA, treatment of paediatric GPA or MPA relies on the studies 
performed in adults (Calatroni et al. 2017).  The patients are often exposed to cytotoxic therapies for 
long periods along with high percentage of treatment failures and disease relapses. In clinical practice, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 7/102 
 
 
 
while paediatric patients respond to cyclophosphamide standard of care treatment, parents and 
caregivers frequently refuse treatment with cyclophosphamide and as a result, patients experience 
disease relapses and in some cases renal failure adding to the urgent need for acceptable alternative 
treatment options.   Paediatric patients with GPA or MPA have limited treatment options and major 
unmet medical needs such as correct and early diagnosis, improved clinical remission rates, longer 
periods of disease control (prevention of disease flares), and reduction of toxicities associated with 
conventional glucocorticoids and current immunosuppressant therapies.  These patients require access 
to safe and effective treatments that have been appropriately evaluated in the paediatric population 
within clinical trial settings. 
Rituximab, already approved in adult patients with GPA and MPA for remission induction and as follow-
up treatment to control disease activity/maintenance treatment, offers a therapy with a mode of action 
that could be associated with significant clinical benefits in paediatric patients with GPA and MPA. 
Study WA25615 (also known as Paediatric Polyangiitis and Rituximab Study [PePRS]) was conducted 
to fullfil the measure of the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP: EMEA-000308-PIPO2-11) agreed upon 
in the context of rituximab development for treatment of adult patients with GPA and MPA (RAVE 
study).  The PIP was initially agreed in 2012 with subsequent modification approved on 18 March 
2016.  The data supporting this application are based on the safety, PK/PD, and exploratory efficacy 
results from Study WA25615.  In fulfillment of the Article 46 requirement, the MAH submitted the final 
CSR for study WA25615 via an Article 46 procedure P-46 97. The MAH then submitted the present 
application. 
With this application, the MAH has sought the following indication: 
MabThera, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients 
(aged ≥ 2 to < 18 years old) with active GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The pharmacologically active substance in MabThera, Rituximab, is a recombinant immunoglobulin-G 
monoclonal antibody with a molecular mass of approximately 145 kD. As an unaltered protein, 
Rituximab is predicted to be metabolised by regular proteinolysis in the patient and biodegraded in 
sewage treatment, as shown for other monoclonal antibodies. Also, the antibodies tested for acute 
ecotoxicity for labelling and classification purposes were not noticeably ecotoxic. Rituximab is unlikely 
to cause a significant risk to the environment and therefore does not need a formal ERA according to 
the EMA 2006 Guideline [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2]. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to 
a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of rituximab. 
Considering the above data, rituximab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A primary objective of study WA25615 was to evaluate the PK parameters of rituximab in paediatric 
patients with severe GPA or MPA. Similar to the RAVE study in adults, the rituximab dosing regimen for 
induction of remission was 4 weekly IV doses of 375 mg/m2. The paediatric study included 
measurement of rituximab concentrations, anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), CD19+ B cells and also 
explored any potential relationship between rituximab exposure and safety or efficacy.   
The PK data in paediatric population were analysed with those obtained in adults with GPA or MPA to 
confirm the suitability of the dosing regimen in paediatric patients and through extrapolation of the 
adult data, support a new indication for the treatment of paediatric patients with GPA or MPA. 
The approved rituximab IV infusion drug was also used in Study WA25615.  No change was made to 
the manufacturing process or formulation. 
Validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure drug levels in serum as 
well as measurements of serum ADA. 
Pediatric study WA25615 
Study WA25615 was a Phase IIa, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study where 25 pediatric 
patients, were enrolled with a median age of 14 years (range 6 to 17 years) across 11 sites in 6 
countries. Children aged 2 to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years were eligible in the 
study, however, no children < 6 years of age were included in the study. An overview of demographic 
and baseline characteristics is provided in Table 1. The majority of patients were female (20 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 10/102 
 
 
 
 
 
[80%]), White (17 patients [68%]) and between 12 and 17 years of age (19 patients [76%]). The 
median body surface area was 1.45 m2 (range: 0.88-1.9 m2). 
Table 1 Demographic and baseline characteristics patients in study WA25615 
Patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GPA or MPA received 4 intravenous (IV) rituximab infusions 
of 375 mg/m2 BSA (at screening) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with a tapering course of oral prednisolone 
or prednisone. 
Serum samples for measurement of rituximab concentrations were collected prior to the first, second, 
third, and fourth infusions and after completion of the first and fourth infusions; and then subsequently 
on days 29 (Month [M]1), 60 (M2), 120 (M4), 180 (M6), 270 (M9), and 545 (M18). 
Blood samples to determine ADAs were collected at baseline, M4, M6, M9, M18, and every 3 months 
following the M18 assessments. 
Blood samples for CD19+ cell counts were collected at baseline, at Week 2, M4, M6, M9, M12, M15, 
and M18. 
In the PK analysis population, non-linear mixed-effects modelling technique was used to analyse the 
PK data with the population PK model developed from adult patients with GPA and MPA in the RAVE 
study. The primary PK parameters were CL and volume of distribution. The secondary PK parameters 
(AUC0-inf, Cmax) were calculated for each patient. PK concentrations were summarized by visit. PK 
parameters were tabulated and summarized (i.e., by mean, SD, coefficient of variation, median, and 
minimum and maximum). PK exposure and response relationships were also explored graphically and

Population PK analysis report No 1090451 
In the Pop PK analyses, rituximab clinical pharmacology in pediatric patients with GPA or MPA, from 
the WA25615 study were combined with the data from the RAVE study (adult patients with ANCA-
Associated Vasculitis (Study ITN021AI)).  
A total of 204 PK serum concentrations from the Remission Induction Phase of Study WA25615 were 
pooled with 487 serum concentrations from 97 adult patients from the RAVE. As not all patients 
received further rituximab doses after the Remission Induction Phase, the PK analysis was restricted to 
induction only. In total, 691 samples from 122 patients with GPA or MPA who received at least 4 
weekly IV doses of 375 mg/m2 of rituximab were included in a population PK analysis (Table 5).

Samples for rituximab concentration levels taken after the end of the first treatment period (37 non-
BLQ concentrations from 17 paediatric patients) and samples below limit of quantification (BLQ) taken 
before the first dose were excluded from the analysis and from all summaries. There were 258 (27.2% 
of all observations) post-dose BLQ samples. A large fraction of BLQ observations is due to the

extensive sampling during times where concentrations are expected to be BLQ (up to 4 years post-
dose). Specifically, among 258 BLQ samples 43 were within 180 days post-dose (or less) while 155 
were collected at post-dose time points exceeding 1 year. 
Model development 
The population PK analysis was conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with the NONMEM 
software, Version 7.4.1 (ICON Development Solutions). Graphical and all other statistical analyses, 
including evaluation of NONMEM outputs, were performed using R for Windows (R project, 
http://www.r-project.org/). The first-order conditional estimation with INTERACTION option (FOCEI) 
method in NONMEM was employed for all model runs. 
In adult GPA and MPA patients from the RAVE study, rituximab pharmacokinetics was described by a 
two-compartment linear model. Sex and ADA were significant covariates on rituximab clearance, while 
sex and BSA were impacting central volume of distribution. Therefore, the two-compartment linear 
model was used in the current pooled analysis.  
Structural model refinement was driven by the data and was based on various goodness-of-fit 
indicators, including visual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots (observed vs. predicted concentration, 
conditional weighted residual vs. predicted concentration or time, histograms of individual random 
effects, etc.), plausibility of parameter estimates, precision of the parameter estimates, the minimum 
objective function value (OF) and the number of estimated parameters. 
Potential covariate-parameter relationships were identified based on scientific interest, mechanistic 
plausibility, and exploratory graphics, and added to the full model. Interpretation and refinement of 
the covariate model were based on point estimates, confidence intervals, diagnostic plots of the 
covariate effects, and on the objective function value. Covariate effects not supported by the data 
(effects close to null value, with high relative standard error and with the 95% confidence intervals 
[CI] that included the null value) were excluded. 
Individual rituximab serum concentration profiles observed in paediatric and in adult GPA or MPA 
patients following 4 weekly IV doses of 375 mg/m2 of rituximab are shown in the figure below:

Rituximab serum concentrations were in both children adults described by a 2-compartment PK model 
with linear elimination. In the population PK model previously developed in adults with GPA or MPA, 
sex and ADA were significant covariates on rituximab clearance, while sex and BSA were impacting 
central volume of distribution. In this updated analysis, model parameters were similar to the ones 
from the RAVE population PK model. The final model is described in the Table below.

Model parameters for a typical patient (BSA=1.9 m2 and absence of ADA), i.e., clearance (258 
mL/day), inter-compartment clearance (317 mL/day), central volume (3070 mL), peripheral volume 
(4160 mL), and terminal half-life (25.6 days) were in the typical range for monoclonal antibodies.  
The visual predictive check plots (Figure 3) and NPDE plots (Figure 4) indicate a good agreement 
between the simulated and observed data during the first treatment period and the absence of any 
covariate trends. After accounting for covariate dependencies, the model correctly predicts the central 
trend of the data for both studies. Variability seems to be slightly higher in observed data for the 
paediatric Study WA25615 but this could be related to the small sample size of this study. Result of 
model evaluation indicated that the final model (Model 014) provided a good description of data 
observed during the remission induction phase, and it can be used to predict rituximab exposure for 
the exposure response analyses.

Impact of Body Surface Area and ADA on rituximab PK  
Body surface area (BSA) and presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were the only two significant 
covariates impacting rituximab exposure.  
Clearance (CL), and central volume of distribution (VC) values were 39.5% lower for BSA of 1.12 m2 
and 24.9% higher for BSA of 2.4 m2 compared to the respective values of patients with BSA=1.9 m2. 
Patients with detected ADA had 38.2% higher clearance resulting in 27.6% lower AUC.  
As a consequence of the BSA effect on rituximab PK parameters, the clearance of paediatric patients 
was lower than for adult patients; but the exposures of paediatric and adult patients were similar. As 
the dose administered to each patient was proportional to BSA, it was lower in the paediatric patients, 
compensating for lower clearance. 
Rituximab clearance increase with BSA, as shown in figure 3 for the overall (i.e. paediatric and adult) 
antibody positive and antibody negative populations is described by the following relationship: 
CL= θCL X (BSA/1.9) 0.952 X 1.38*ADA where θCL is a typical value of clearance in milliliters per day 
(mL/day) for a typical patient (i.e., Body Surface Area [BSA] of 1.9 m2 and absence of anti-rituximab 
antibodies [ADAs]) and is equal to 258 mL/day).  The strong relationship between BSA and CL can also 
be seen in the exponent value of 0.952, which describes the BSA CL relationship. 
CL=rituximab clearance.  Red: predicted individual CL values for paediatric study; Blue: predicted individual CL values 
for adult study; Green line: model prediction of CL.  All four patients considered ADAs positive in the entire study 
included.  CL= θCL X (BSA/1.9) 0.952 X 1.38*ADA with θCL, the typical value of clearance in (mL/day) for a typical 
patient (i.e., BSA of 1.9 m2 and absence of ADA) and is equal to 258 mL/day) 
Figure 5 Relationships of Rituximab Clearance with Body Surface Area in Paediatrics and Adults, 
by ADA Detection Categories 
While rituximab clearance increases with BSA, since rituximab is administered based on mg/m2, the 
exposure is the same across the entire range of BSA values, as shown in the figure below.

The CHMP noted that as in adults, BSA has a significantly impact on volume of distribution and 
clearance in paediatric subjects. Rituximab CL and volume of distribution were lower in paediatric 
patients than in adults.  
The lower BSA in paediatric subjects compared to adult subjects is compensated for by the BSA-
adjusted dosing regimen. Therefore, the BSA-adjusted dosing regimen of 4 weekly IV doses of 
rituximab 375 mg/m2 ensured similar exposure between adult and paediatric patients with GPA or 
MPA. 
The Pop PK model has adequately confirmed that a similar rituximab dosing regimen result in similar 
paediatric and adult rituximab exposure.

Patients’ individual PK parameters estimated from Model 014 were used for the summary.  
CV was computed as standard deviation of the log-transformed data. 
Since rituximab is administered based on BSA, the dosing results in matching exposure when 
comparing the pediatric and adult populations with median AUC0-180 of 9787 and 10302 µg/mL∙day for 
the pediatric and adult populations, respectively.  The variability in exposure was similar across the 
BSA range, further supporting the matching exposure in pediatric population and adults, when 
rituximab is dosed based on BSA.  Therefore, matching the pediatric and the adult exposure is 
achieved with the 375 mg/m2 once weekly x 4 regimen according to the MAH. 
The CHMP noted that as in adults, BSA has a significant impact on volume of distribution and clearance 
in pediatric subjects. Rituximab CL and volume of distribution were lower in pediatric patients than in 
adults. The lower BSA in pediatric subjects compared to adult subjects is compensated for by the BSA-
adjusted dosing regimen. Therefore, the BSA-adjusted dosing regimen of 4 weekly IV doses of rituximab 
375 mg/m2 ensured similar exposure between adult and pediatric patients with GPA or MPA. The Pop 
PK model has adequately confirmed that a similar rituximab dosing regimen result in similar pediatric 
and adult rituximab exposure. 
Extrapolation of PK and dose recommendation to children 2 - 6 years of age 
Although the paediatric study enrolled patients of ≥6 years of age, and the lowest BSA was 0.876, 
based on the fact that BSA and rituximab clearance are strongly correlated (exponent of 0.952 in the 
power model describing BSA and CL), it is expected that the slope of the BSA CL relationship is the 
same in paediatric patients ≥2 to <6 years of age as in older/larger paediatric patients, as shown in the 
figure below.

Therefore, according to the MAH, administration of 375 mg/m2 weekly x 4 in paediatric patients ≥2 to 
<6 years of age is expected to result in similar exposure as in the ≥ 6 year old paediatric patients.  This 
is supported by the fact that the FcRn receptor, responsible for the long half-life of IgGs (Ghetie and 
Ward, 2002, Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007), as well as rituximab (half-life of approximately 22-25 
days), can be found in fetuses, infants, children and adults and thus the elimination half-life is 
expected to be the same in paediatric patients ≥2 to <6 years of age as in the older paediatric patients 
(Israel EJ et al, 1997, Shah U et al, 2003). 
At the CHMP’s request, the MAH submitted rituximab PK data in paediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) 
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma to support the proposed dosing regimen in the younger age group.  PK 
data from 35 paediatric subjects in the age range 3-17 years are available including 9 children 3 to 6 
years of age. AUC and Cmin were similar across the BSA range 0.5 to 2 m2. A trend toward higher 
Cmax was seen for lower BSA values, but still within a range seen in adults. The pharmacokinetic data 
in paediatric patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of 
rituximab was not different in 3-5 years old compared to 6-18 year old paediatric patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
There is strong evidence of a crucial role for B cells in the pathogenesis of GPA and MPA (Fauci et al. 
1971, 1974; Fauci and Wolff 1973; Wolff et al. 1974) and the number of activated B cells has been 
shown to correlate with the extent of active disease (Popa et al. 1999). Similar to adults, short-lived 
plasma cells in paediatric patients are thought to be the primary source of pathogenic autoantibodies 
such as ANCAs to PR3 and MPO. Because short-lived plasma cells are the terminally differentiated 
progeny of antigen-specific B cell precursors, they disappear after approximately 2 weeks when the 
precursor cells are no longer available (Reff et al. 1994).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 21/102 
 
 
 
 
 
The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can 
recruit immune effector functions that mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector mediated 
cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on the surface of granulocytes, macrophages 
and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD 20 antigen on B lymphocytes has also been demonstrated to 
induce cell death via apoptosis. 
Peripheral B cell counts declined below normal following completion of the first dose of rituximab. In 
adult patients with GPA or MPA, the number of peripheral blood B cells decreased to <10 cells/μL after 
two weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most patients up to the 6 
month time point. The majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell return, with counts >10 
cells/μL by month 12, increasing to 87% of patients by month 18. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
B-cell levels 
Treatment with rituximab resulted in complete and sustained CD19+ peripheral B-cell depletion which 
persisted until at least Month 6, and in the majority of cases throughout the duration of follow-up, in 
which repeat rituximab infusions could be administered (Figure below). By Month 18, CD19 levels had 
increased but still remained below baseline levels with a median (min-max) of 58 (0.0 – 600)/μL. 
Patients in the age group of ≥2 to <12 years (n=6), had baseline CD19 counts in the same range as 
paediatric patients aged ≥12 to ≤17 years [n=19]) and depleted similarly to 0 cells/µl after rituximab 
treatment.

Auto-antibody levels 
At baseline (Month 0), 7 out of 25 patients (28%) were reported to be MPO-ANCA positive. This 
proportion had decreased to 5 out of 25 patients (20%) at Month 1, 1 out of 25 patients (4%) at 
Month 6 and 0 out of 24 patients at Month 12. At Month 18, 2 out of 23 patients (8.7%) were reported 
to be MPO-ANCA positive.

Page 22/102 
 
 
 
 
At baseline, 14 out of 25 patients (56%) were PR3-ANCA positive. This proportion had decreased to 13 
out of 25 patients (52%) at Month 1, 8 out of 25 patients (32%) at Month 6 and 5 out of 24 patients 
(20.8%) at Month 12. At Month 18, 6 out of 23 patients (26.1%) were reported to be PR3-ANCA 
positive. 
Immunogenicity 
No paediatric patients in study WA25615 tested positive for anti-drug antibodies to rituximab at 
baseline. A total of 4 out of 21 evaluable patients (19%) developed treatment-induced ADA during the 
study period: one patient first tested positive for ADA at Month 4 and continued to have positive titres 
at subsequent study visits (Months, 6, 9 and 18). Three additional patients first tested positive for ADA 
at Month 18. 
Individual rituximab serum concentration profiles observed in paediatric patients following 4 weekly IV 
doses of 375 mg/m2 of rituximab are shown in Figure 2. Paediatric patients with ADA (N=4/25) are 
highlighted. 
In the adult study, 20 out of 97 subjects were ADA positive (Figure below). 
Figure 9 Observed individual serum concentration for patients with and without ADA study U2639s 
The CHMP noted that the Pop PK analysis, patients with detected ADA had 38.2% higher clearance 
resulting in 27.6% lower AUC. Four paediatric patients out of 21 were ADA positive in the paediatric 
study. One patient with ADAs had fast decline in rituximab concentration indication higher clearance. 
No obvious difference in the individual serum concentrations of the three additional subjects with ADAs 
indicate major differences in exposure between ADA positive and negative subjects, but numbers are 
small. Development of ADAs has been shown in the Pop PK analyses to cause higher clearance and 
lower exposure which may have an impact on efficacy. In the RAVE study, 20 of 97 adult subjects were

ADA positive. There is no apparent differences between adult and paediatric subjects in 
immunogenicity. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Four different individual exposure measures were predicted by simulations from the final PK model 
using patients’ actual dosing history over the first 180 days and individual PK parameters: CMAX, 
C180, AUC180, and AUCinf. All exposure measures were highly correlated, AUC180 was used for the 
graphical exposure-response analysis. Exposure categories were defined by the values of AUC180. Low 
(high) exposure category included 13 (12) patients with AUC180 less or equal (greater) than the 
median of AUC180 values in patients of Study WA25615 (equal to 9787 μg*day/mL). 
 CD19+ B cells in Paediatrics and adult Patients with GPA and MPA 
Graphical analyses demonstrated that rituximab administration in paediatric and adult patients induced 
rapid and prolonged peripheral CD19+ B-cell depletion which persisted until at least Month 6, and there 
were no differences in B-cell depletion or start of time to repletion between adult and paediatric 
patients, as shown in the figure below. 
Note: Red lines show B-cell counts over time for paediatric patients. B-cell counts equal to zero are assigned value 
0.05 on the semi-log scale plots. Note: The data are presented for first 6 months.

(bottom graph) 
The CHMP noted that B-cell depletion is fast and remain for most paediatric subjects until month 6. 
The time-course of observed B-cell counts by exposure categories in paediatric patients is shown in the 
figure below. Visually, there were no differences between B-cell time course of patients in low and high 
exposure categories, but a longer B-cell suppression was observed in patients with higher exposures. 
Similar results were observed in adults.

Exposure-response relationship in paediatric patients  
Four different individual exposure measures were predicted by simulations from the final PK model 
using patients’ actual dosing history over the first 180 days and individual PK parameters: CMAX, 
C180, AUC180, and AUCinf. Patients from each study separately and from the two studies combined 
were categorized to low or high exposure group compared to median exposure. All exposure measures 
were highly correlated and did not depend on study, sex, age, weight, or BSA. 
Efficacy 
In the paediatric population, the efficacy parameters included in the analysis were:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Paediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS) remission at Month 6,  
PVAS remission by Month 6,  
cumulative number of PVAS flares,  
cumulative glucocorticoids dose, and  
levels of MPO- antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and PR3-ANCA auto-antibodies. 
Relationships between rituximab exposure and paediatric vasculitis score 
The figure below illustrates distributions of PVAS scores at baseline and at 6 months. The median PVAS 
score decreased from about 9 at baseline to about 1 at 6 months. The plots suggested that PVAS 
significantly improved during the study (WA25615) without appreciable differences between the 
exposure groups.

Boxes indicate the inter-quartile range (IQR). Whiskers represent 1.5*IQR. Outliers are marked 
outside of the whiskers by circles. 
There was only 1 patient with flares in the high exposure group, while 5 patients in the low exposure 
group experienced at least one flare during the study. The exposure of patients with flares was lower 
than in patients without flares. However, there were no obvious relationships between exposure and 
probability of flares events in the logistic regression models (p-values > 0.1).

Safety 
The relationship between rituximab exposure and safety was assessed for the following events: serious 
adverse events (SAEs), Grade ≥3 AEs, serious infections, infusion related reactions (IRRs), laboratory 
abnormalities of prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia (table below). 
While the sample size was small (N=25), there were no increases in the occurrence of any of these AEs 
when comparing patients with lower rituximab exposure (i.e., AUC0−180 less than the median) to 
those with higher exposure (i.e., AUC0−180 greater than the median).  The observed rituximab 
concentrations were also similar for patients with and without each type of AEs.  When using logistic 
regressions, the occurrence of any of these AEs did not show any significant relationships with 
exposure (p-values >0.05). 
Table 10 Occurrences of AEs, study WA25615 
The CHMP noted that the exposure-response analysis did not identify an exposure-response relationship 
for either efficacy or safety, but numbers are small. The rituximab exposure in paediatric subjects was 
adequate  to  induce  rapid  and  prolonged  B-cell  depletion,  confirming  suitability  of  the  BSA-adjusted 
dosing regimen of weekly IV doses of rituximab 375 mg/m2 to treat both adult and paediatric patients 
with GPA or MPA from 6 years of age. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This application is based on results from one study WA25615 in paediatric patients with severe 
granulomatosis with GPA/MPA. Although efficacy and safety data are collected in paediatric patients 
with GPA/MPA, because of the limited number of patients, the role of the pharmacokinetics in this 
application is to show comparable rituximab pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients 2-18 years of age 
with the pharmacokinetics in adults in order to bridge the efficacy and safety from adults with 
GPA/MPA of age to children 2-18 years of age. For that purpose, an updated popPK analysis is 
presented combining pharmacokinetic data in paediatric and adult patients with GPA/MPA. In addition, 
exploratory exposure-effect analysis for CD19 B-cell suppression, paediatric vasculitis activity score 
and safety were submitted. 
Rituximab pharmacokinetics was described by a two-compartment linear model. In this updated 
analysis, model parameters for adult patients were similar to the ones from the RAVE population PK 
model. The popPK analysis predicted the exposures in paediatric and adult patients well.  Clearance of 
rituximab was lower in paediatric patients than for adult patients. As the dose administered to each 
patient was proportional to BSA, the dose administered was lower in the paediatric patients resulting in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 27/102 
 
 
 
 
 
comparable exposures in paediatric and adult patients. Predicted rituximab exposure parameters 
AUC0-180 days, Cmax and C180 days were comparable in paediatric and adult patients following once 
weekly administration x4 of 375 mg/m2 rituximab. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 25 children (6-17 years old) with GPA and MPA 
who received 375 mg/m2 MabThera once weekly for four doses, the estimated median terminal 
elimination half life was 22 days (range, 11 to 42 days).  Rituximab mean clearance and volume of 
distribution were 0.221 L/day (range, 0. 0996 to 0.381 L/day) and 2.27 L (range 1.43 to 3.17 L), 
respectively.  Maximum concentration during the first 180 days (Cmax), minimum concentration at 
Day 180 (C180) and cumulative area under the curve over 180 days (AUC180) were (median [range]) 
382.8 (270.6-513.6) µg/mL, 0.9 (0-17.7) µg/mL and 9787 (4838-20446) µg/mL*day, respectively. 
The rituximab dose employed for paediatric patients in study WA25615 was 375 mg/m2 iv given once 
weekly, for 4 consecutive weeks. This is the same dose as approved for adults with GPA and MPA, that 
was used in the pivotal RAVE study. In RAVE, a population PK analysis showed that body surface area 
(BSA), gender and presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) influenced rituximab pharmacokinetics. 
Therefore, it was expected that BSA-adjusted dosing would provide similar exposure in adult and 
paediatric patients. In adult patients with GPA or MPA in the RAVE study, a 375 mg/m2 dose regimen 
achieved uniform pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures across a wide range of body weights or BSA. The 
allometric scaling method indicated that 375 mg/m2 would be adequate in paediatric patients. 
Study WA25615 was not designed to evaluate rituximab in the maintenance setting, but only the 
induction of remission. Maintenance treatment and repeat remission-induction treatment with 
rituximab, as has been established in adult patients has not been studied in the paediatric patients but 
was given at the discretion of the investigator, per their clinical judgement (including dose and 
treatment regimen) based on disease activity, previous response to treatment, and the investigator’s 
assessment of the benefit/risk of additional rituximab treatment.  Approximately 68% (17/25) received 
additional rituximab treatment post month 6. However, this was at the discretion of the physician, and 
different doses and treatment regimens were used. Furthermore, in the majority of the cases, the 
intention was to induce remission, not to maintain a response. The MAH also provided a post-hoc 
analysis PVAS in patients only receiving induction treatment vs. those patients who also received 
treatment beyond month 6. In this analysis, no major differences are seen. However, no firm 
conclusions can be based on such small number of patients.  
Rituximab exposure following the 4 weekly IV infusions of 375 mg/m2 rituximab regimen induced rapid 
and prolonged B-cell depletion in paediatric patients. This was reached with one course of remission-
induction. The depletion (B-cell count < 5x106 cells/L) appeared to last longer in patients with higher 
exposure. Similar effects were observed in adult patients.  
The median PVAS score decreased from about 9 at baseline to about 1 at 6 months. A similar reduction 
was observed in paediatric patients with low or high rituximab exposure. Rituximab exposure of 
patients with flares appeared to be lower than in patients without flares. However, there were no 
obvious relationships between exposure and probability of flares events in the logistic regression 
models (p-values > 0.1). Overall, no association between rituximab exposure and clinical efficacy or 
safety was observed. Similar findings were reported for adults with GPA or MPA from the RAVE trial. 
Pharmacokinetics of rituximab showed a comparable exposure in adult and paediatric patients, 
supporting the dosing regimen. It appears that the MAH had not set criteria for similarity in exposure 
between paediatric and adults to allow bridging to efficacy and safety established in adult patients. 
Since mean/median rituximab exposures and variability in paediatric patients and adults was 
comparable as was B-cell depletion, this issue was not pursued by CHMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 28/102 
 
 
 
Only patients ≥ 6 years of age were enrolled in the study. Hence pharmacokinetics of rituximab in 
patients ≥2 years of age and < 6 years of age are missing.  Simulations of rituximab exposure in ≥ 2 to 
< 6 years old children and older patients with GPA or MPA with different methods to estimate PK 
parameters indicated similar exposure across age groups. This was further supported by rituximab PK 
data in paediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  PK data from 35 
paediatric subjects in the age range 3-17 years are available including 9 children 3 to 6 years of age. 
AUC and Cmin were similar across the BSA range 0.5 to 2 m2. A trend toward higher Cmax was seen 
for lower BSA values, but still within a range seen in adults. The pharmacokinetic data in paediatric 
patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rituximab was not 
different in 3-5 years old compared to 6-18 year old paediatric patients. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that it has been adequately justified that a body size based dosing regimen in GPA/MPA will 
provide similar and acceptable exposure in the youngest children ≥ 2 to < 6 years of age even though 
no clinical data in this age group are available. 
The CHMP noted that the Pop PK analysis, patients with detected ADA had 38.2% higher clearance 
resulting in 27.6% lower AUC. Four paediatric patients out of 25 were ADA positive in the paediatric 
study. One patient with ADAs had fast decline in rituximab concentration indication higher clearance. 
No obvious difference in the individual serum concentrations of the three additional subjects with ADAs 
indicate major differences in exposure between ADA positive and negative subjects, but numbers are 
small.  Development of ADAs has been shown in the Pop PK analyses to cause higher clearance and 
lower exposure which may have an impact on efficacy. In the RAVE study, 20 of 97 adult subjects were 
ADA positive. There are no apparent differences between adult and paediatric subjects in 
immunogenicity. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK parameters of rituximab in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA were similar to those in adults 
with GPA or MPA, once taking into account the BSA effect on clearance and volume of distribution 
parameters. 
The CHMP concluded that the body size body regimen was adequate for children from 2 years onwards 
in GPA/MPA. Section 4.2 of the SmPC therefore recommends a dosage of MabThera for the treatment 
of paediatric patients with severe, active GPA or MPA is 375 mg/m2 BSA, administered as an IV 
infusion once weekly for 4 weeks..  
Limited data shows there was no trend observed in the adverse reactions reported in ADA positive 
patients. There was no apparent trend or negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy 
in the paediatric GPA and MPA clinical trials.

anti-CD22, or anti-B-lymphocyte stimulator [BLys]/BAFF) within 6 months prior to baseline 
visit 
5.  Previous treatment with other cell-depleting therapies 
Treatments 
Rituximab 
Rituximab was given as an IV infusion of 375 mg/m2 once a week for 4 consecutive weeks, starting at 
the baseline visit. The dose for rituximab was calculated according to the patient’s body surface area 
(BSA) at the screening visit after the patient’s eligibility had been established, and remained the same 
for all four infusions. Each patient’s actual body height and weight, measured during the 28-day period 
before baseline (i.e., during the 28 days before the start of administration of open-label rituximab) was 
used to calculate a patient’s BSA according to the Dubois formula.  
Patients were to be medicated pre-infusion with paracetamol/acetaminophen and cetirizine 
hydrochloride (or similar antihistamine), both according to locally approved age-related doses, which 
were given 1 hour (±15 minutes) before each infusion of rituximab. Subject to investigator’s 
discretion, corticosteroid premedication with an IV infusion of 100 mg of methylprednisolone could be 
administered at least 30 minutes prior to infusion of rituximab (but not prior to clinical assessments) if 
the patient had experienced an IRR with a previous rituximab infusion. 
Facilities for immediate emergency intervention, including resuscitation in case of an anaphylactic 
reaction, were to be available. Vital signs (i.e., pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 
temperature) were taken pre-infusion. During the infusions, vital signs were to be assessed every 15 
minutes for 1 hour, then every 30 minutes, and at least 1 hour after the completion of the infusion. A 
physician was available on site. Rituximab was not to be administered as an IV push or bolus due to 
the possibility of occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. After infusion, the IV line was to remain in 
the patient for at least 1 hour to enable the administration of any necessary medication, as applicable.  
Methylprednisolone 
Patients were to receive three daily doses of 30 mg/kg of methylprednisolone (up to 1 g/day) or the 
equivalent dose of other glucocorticoids by IV infusion, which could occur at any time, up to and 
including Day 1. If clinically indicated, and at the discretion of the investigator, additional doses (up to 
three) of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg, up to 1 g/day, or equivalent) could be given by IV infusion. 
No more than six doses of methylprednisolone in total were to be given. All methylprednisolone doses 
had to be completed prior to the first rituximab infusion. The first rituximab infusion had to occur no 
longer than 14 days after the final IV glucocorticoid dose; the final IV glucocorticoid dose could be 
given on Day 1 (prior to the first rituximab infusion). Compliance was assessed according to 
completion of a glucocorticoid log. 
Prednisolone or Prednisone 
On Day 1 and following completion of IV glucocorticoids, all patients were to receive concomitant oral 
prednisolone or prednisone (1 mg/kg/day or up to 60 mg/day or equivalent, whichever was lower), the 
dose of which was to be tapered to a minimum of 0.2 mg/kg/day (or 10 mg/day, whichever was 
lowest) no later than Month 6. The general guidance on the suggested oral steroid dose-tapering 
schedule was to taper from 1 mg/kg/day (60 mg/day, maximum) at the start of treatment, to 0.8 
mg/kg/day by Month 1, and then by 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day each month to 0.2 mg/kg/day (or 10 mg/day, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 31/102 
 
 
 
 
whichever was lowest), which was to be reached no later than Month 6. Oral prednisone (used in some 
non-UK sites) could be substituted for prednisolone at the same dose as long as there was no hepatic 
impairment. The steroid-tapering practice was specific to a particular patient and as such was to be 
tailored individually for each patient at the time of study entry, at the discretion of the investigator. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
The primary safety objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rituximab in 
paediatric patients with severe GPA or MPA. The primary PK objective of this study was to evaluate the 
PK parameters of rituximab in paediatric patients with severe GPA or MPA. 
Exploratory objectives 
The efficacy objective for this study was exploratory and was to assess the efficacy of rituximab for the 
induction of remission in paediatric patients with severe GPA or MPA. 
Other exploratory objectives for this study were as follows: 
1.  To explore the PD parameters of rituximab in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA 
2.  To explore the effect of rituximab on patient quality of life and disability/functioning, as assessed 
using the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire

Other Efficacy Endpoints 
The following efficacy endpoints were summarized descriptively: 
1.  The cumulative glucocorticoid dose for patients at Months 6, 12, and 18. 
2.  The change from baseline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (calculated using the Schwartz 
formula) to Month 6. 
3.  The PGADA, which was completed at screening, baseline and then at each visit starting from Month 
1. 
4.  The PVDI (Paediatric Vasculitis Damage Index), which was assessed at screening, baseline and then 
six-monthly until the end of the Follow-Up Phase, or at early withdrawal. PVDI evaluated cumulative 
organ damage (persisting for ≥ 3 months) for any item developing since the onset of vasculitis. The 
total PVDI score was the number of symptoms present from a list of 72 symptoms divided into 10 
categories  (there  was  also  a  separate  four-category  scale  regarding  days  of  school  absence).  At 
baseline, missing individual PVDI scores were replaced by the corresponding screening value, when 
given. At all visits, if any of the sets of symptoms were not assessed, including any missing at both 
baseline and screening, then it was assumed that the symptoms were not present. The total PVDI 
scores and their changes from baseline were summarized descriptively by 6-monthly intervals. The 
days of school absence scale were cross-tabulated as counts at baseline versus each 6- monthly 
assessment score. 
The CHMP noted that MAH has defined multiple clinically relevant endpoints. Since these are all 
exploratory endpoints, there is no adjustment for multiplicity. Although the efficacy objective is 
declared as exploratory by the MAH, it is implied that PVAS remission at month 6 is the outcome of 
main interest, which is agreed. PVAS remission was defined as a PVAS of 0 and achieved glucocorticoid 
taper to 0.2 mg/kg/day (or 10 mg/day, whichever was lower) or a PVAS of 0 on two consecutive 
readings at least 4 weeks apart irrespective of glucocorticoid dose. This is endorsed as a clinical 
relevant outcome in children’s GPA and MPA. Though not finally validated, PVAS is considered to have 
face validity and it can be relied on the validity and acceptance of the BVAS/WG in GPA/MPA. Results 
on BVAS/WG remission as defined for in adults can be used for robustness.  The Physician’s Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity (PDGA), Cumulative glucocorticoid dose, Children’s Stanford Health 
Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) disability index, are especially useful to support clinical relevance 
and robustness of findings on PVAS. While the efficacy outcomes are also assessed after month 6 
(months 12 and 18), it is more difficult to interpret their value, because follow-up treatment was at the 
discretion of the treating physician (patients and families).

Sample size 
Study WA25615 was an open-label, single-arm study, with the primary objective of evaluating safety 
and PK of rituximab in paediatric patients with severe GPA or MPA. PD and efficacy were exploratory 
endpoints. There was no formal statistical hypothesis testing for any of the study endpoints. 
The planned sample size of 25 patients was determined on the basis of the occurrence paediatric GPA 
and MPA and on information from existing patient cohorts. The number of paediatric patients that 
would be eligible for treatment with rituximab and that could be expected to be enrolled within a 
reasonable timeframe was taken into account. The planned sample size was considered to be sufficient 
to provide a reasonable estimate of variability for the mean PK parameters based on the observed 
intra-patient variability from the RAVE study. The planned sample size should have ensured a 95% 
probability of observing at least one AE when the underlying incidence of that event is ≥ 11%. The 
planned sample size was also chosen to allow estimation of the percentage of patients in remission at 
6 months to lie within 20% of the point estimate (the distance from the point estimate to the upper or 
lower limit of a 95% CI). 
The CHMP noted that the planned sample size seems to be driven by the time frame and prevalence 
available. The MAH describes the precision that can be obtained with this sample size. In fact, 95%-CI 
for the estimated standard deviation (SD) of a PK parameters (on log scale) would be from 0.78*SD to 
1.39*SD, so a relative precision of 22%. Also, the 95%-CI for the percentage (perc) of responder 
would be typically from perc -20% to perc +20% (this is what probably is meant by the 
uninterpretable formulation “estimation of the percentage of patients in remission at 6 months to lie 
within 20% of the point estimate (the distance from the point estimate to the upper or lower limit of a 
95% CI).”) This somehow limits the comparison between adult and pediatric data. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was not applied, it was a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The clinical assessors were not blinded, it was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Study WA25615 was an open-label, single-arm study, with the primary objective of evaluating safety 
and PK of rituximab in paediatric patients with severe GPA or MPA. PD and efficacy were exploratory 
endpoints. There was no formal statistical hypothesis testing for any of the study endpoints, the Data 
Analysis Plan was finalized prior to final analysis. 
There is an interim analysis for this study where the study data for the remission induction phase (6-
month time-point) is analyzed when the last patient has reached the 6 month visit and the data have 
been cleaned with the relevant parts of the database locked for editing. 
Primary analysis will be done once all of the data, up until the follow-up visit subsequent to the 
common closeout date (the Withdrawal visit), has been entered into the study database, cleaned and 
the database locked for editing. A final analysis will be reported once the extended follow-up for all 
appropriate patients has been completed, with all data entered into the database, cleaned and the 
database fully locked.

Descriptive statistics will be used. The proportions of patients in remission and partial remission, 
according to the various definitions will be summarized as counts and percentages, together with 95%-
CI based on the binomial distribution. 
The CHMP noted that in the absence of pre-specification of tests, the efficacy endpoints and in 
particular their 95%-CI can only be interpreted descriptively. Also, no order of importance of the 
efficacy endpoints was planned. The interim analysis was not planned to stop the study and not of 
influence on multiple testing as no testing was performed in this study. It is reassuring that the interim 
was after the most relevant part of the study. As discussed for the sample size above, the precision in 
this study is limited.

Recruitment 
A total of 25 patients were enrolled into the study. The first patient was enrolled in May 2013 and last 
patient was enrolled in November 2016. Patients were enrolled at 11 investigational sites across 6 
countries, over a 3.5 year period. A total of 17 patients (68%) were enrolled in Europe and 8 patients 
(32%) in North America. A majority of 13 patients (52%) was enrolled at 3 sites in the United 
Kingdom. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
Four patients (16%) had a total of 4 major protocol deviations during the study. A per-protocol 
analysis was not performed for this open-label study. Major deviations were primarily related to 
concomitant medications (3 patients), which included 1 patient not receiving methylprednisolone doses 
prior to rituximab treatment per protocol; 1 patient not receiving pre-medications prior to rituximab 
infusion; and 1 patient continuing to receive a prohibited concomitant medication (mycophenolate 
mofetil) for their pre-existing severe chronic renal disease as suspension of the treatment, in the 
Investigator’s opinion could have exposed the patient to a risk of potential renal damage. In addition, 
one major deviation for a patient fulfilling an exclusion criterion (IgM below LLN at baseline) was 
reported. These deviations were not considered to have any significant impact on overall interpretation 
of safety or efficacy results of the study.

There were four protocol amendments to the original Protocol WA25615 Version 1, which was released 
on 2 July 2012. 
Protocol Version 2 
Study protocol WA25615 Version 2 was released on 13 October 2012. The main changes to the protocol 
were as follows: 
1.  The tool used for the exploratory endpoint of the measurement of childhood primary vasculitis from 
the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) was changed to the Paediatric Vasculitis Damage Index (PVDI), 
which  had  just  become  available.  The  tool  was  modified  from  the  existing  adult  version  and 
considered  more  relevant  to  paediatric  patients  and  enabled  collection  of  more  relevant  patient 
data. 
2.  The  quality  of  life  (QOL)  instrument  the  Child  Health  Questionnaire  (CHQ)  was  added  to  the 
exploratory  outcome  measures  in  order  to  assess  both  QOL  and  disability/functioning.  The 
description  of  the  Childhood  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire  (CHAQ),  an  instrument  for 
disability/functioning, was corrected since it was previously incorrectly described as an instrument 
for QOL assessment. 
Protocol Version 3 
Study  protocol  WA25615 Version 3  was  released on  31  May  2013.  The  main changes  to the protocol 
were as follows: 
•  New safety information was provided on severe skin reactions (e.g., Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
and  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome)  based  on up-to-date  information in  the  context  of  the use  of 
rituximab. 
• 
The exclusion limit of ALT or AST levels was increased in order to align the inclusion criteria with 
the RAVE study.  
•  Definitions  of  progressive  disease,  disease  relapse/flare,  and  major  and  minor  items  for 
Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) for Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) BVAS/WG and 
Paediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS) were provided to facilitate more robust data analysis. 
Additional  exploratory  efficacy  outcome  measures/endpoints  were  included  and  clarifications 
provided. 
• 
• 
• 
Two  additional  exploratory  endpoints  were  added  to  provide  a  more  stringent  definition  for 
investigation of remission, if remission was sustained for ≥4 weeks: 
Proportion of patients in remission by Month 6, defined as a BVAS/WG of 0 on two consecutive 
readings at least 4 weeks apart, irrespective of glucocorticoid dose. 
 Proportion  of  patients  in  remission  by  Month  6,  defined  as  a  PVAS  of  0  ontwo  consecutive 
readings at least 4 weeks apart, irrespective of glucocorticoid dose. 
Protocol Version 4 
Study protocol WA25615 Version 3 was released on 27 March 2015. The main changes to the protocol 
were as follows: 
• 
Further information on posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in the Disease 
Background Section (Section 1.1) was added. These changes were made to provide additional 
information  about  this  serious  condition  and  to  refer  physicians  to  the  information  already 
available in the IB and SmPC. 
Protocol Version 5 
Study protocol WA25615 Version 5 was released on 26 April 2016. The main changes to the protocol 
were as follows: 
• 
The exclusion criteria relating to general health, prior medications and laboratory findings were 
modified. Changes were made to extend the possibility of entry into the study to a wider range 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 37/102 
 
 
 
of suitable GPA and MPA patients, who would otherwise have limited treatment options. The 
changes  to  exclusion  criteria  required  the  treating  physician  to  assess  benefit/risk,  prior  to 
patient  study  entry.  The  changes  allowed  a  small  proportion  of  patients  who  were  not 
previously eligible the opportunity to participate in this study. 
Changes in Data Analysis Plan 
Exploratory PVAS remission by Month 12 and 18 were added to provide alignment with the assessment 
of other efficacy endpoints at the same study visits. 
The CHMP noted that there were 4 protocol amendments during the conduct of the study, but none of 
the amendments are considered critical with regards to study design and conduct of the study.

Previous and Concurrent Diseases (Other than GPA / MPA) and previous medication 
For the 24 patients (96%) who had their previous/concurrent disease status recorded at baseline, all 
patients had at least 1 concomitant disease other than GPA or MPA (see summary of previous medical 
history). Sixteen patients (67%) had 3 or more concurrent conditions at baseline. The majority of 
concomitant diseases, excluding underlying vascular diseases (GPA or MPA), were gastrointestinal (GI) 
disorders (9 patients [36%]), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (9 patients [36%]), and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (7 patients [28%]). 
The majority of patients did not have history of passive immunization (immunoglobulin) for tetanus, 
hepatitis B, hepatitis A, rabies or varicella zoster (see summary). A summary of vaccination history, 
including active immunizations, is additionally provided. The most commonly reported active 
vaccinations at baseline were typical of those received in childhood and included tetanus (18 patients 
[72%]), measles, mumps, rubella and diphtheria (each reported in 17 patients [68%]). The 
vaccination compliance overall reflected that in the real world being <100%.

Table 19 Previous medications for GPA/MPA, safety-evaluable patients 
Concomitant Treatments for GPA/MPA and Diseases Other than GPA/MPA 
All patients (100%) received at least one concomitant treatment for diseases other than GPA/MPA 
during the study. The most frequently reported concomitant treatments included antihistamines (147 
treatments in 25 patients [100%]), analgesics (166 treatments in 24 patients [96%]) and steroids (99 
treatments in 21 patients [84%]). Five patients (20%) received treatment with immunosuppressants 
for diseases other than GPA/MPA (azathioprine [3 patients, 12%] and mycophenolate mofetil [2 
patients, 8%]). Three patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). 
The CHMP noted that while concomitant immunosuppressive treatment was explicitly allowed in the 
Follow-up Phase, it seems that 5 patients received immunosuppressive treatment in the Remission-
Induction Phase (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide). The MAH explained how in 
the remission-induction period 3 (not 5) patients received additional immunosuppressive treatment, 
which was mycophenolate in all cases. In one of the patients, use was 18 days between months 2 and 
3 and will not have impacted the assessment at month 6. Two of the patients used mycophenolate up 
to month 6, one of them reached PVAS remission while the other one did not. Consequently, it is 
considered that the overall efficacy results at month 6 are not meaningfully impacted by concomitant

therapy in these three patients. Combination therapy with different immunosuppressive agents and 
corticosteroids is common practice in the treatment of auto-immune-disorders, mainly to reduce the 
dose levels of potential toxic drugs.

Rituximab treatment 
In the Remission Induction Phase, all 25 patients (100%) completed the 4 scheduled rituximab 
infusions (four weekly IV infusions of 375 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22). In accordance with the 
protocol, per investigator’s discretion, patients could receive subsequent rituximab infusions on or after 
Month 6 to maintain remission and/or to control disease activity (including disease flares). Eight out of 
25 patients received the induction regimen of 4 x 375 mg/m2 infusions only, and no further treatment 
with rituximab (Figure below). Seventeen patients (68%) received additional rituximab infusions on or 
after Month 6 until the Common Close-out date (Figure below), nine patients (36%) received a 5th 
infusion at Month 6. 
Figure 15 Rituximab administration over the course of the study 
During the Overall Study Period (Remission Induction Phase + Follow-up Phase), patients received 
between 4 and 28 infusions of rituximab (up to 4.5 yrs [53.8 months]). In the Follow-up period, 5 
patients received 375 mg/m2 once weekly x 4 rituximab infusions approximately every 6 months; 5 
patients received one 375mg/m2 rituximab infusion every 6 months and a further 7 patients received 
other varied rituximab doses/regimens.  The CHMP noted that in the figure above it can clearly be seen 
that the period from baseline to month 6 is the most informative part of the study.  After month 6, 
several patterns arise, which appear to vary from repeating a course of 4 weekly infusions as reaction 
to a flare, to what may look like maintenance treatment of regular single infusions with a view to 
prevent a flare. 
Numbers analysed 
All of the 25 patients enrolled contributed to the safety, PK and efficacy analyses (see Table below).

Number of Major and Minor PVAS Relapses/ Flares 
At month 6, 2 patients (8%) were reported to have one major PVAS flare, 1 patient (4%) had ≥5 
minor PVAS flares, and 1 patient (4%) had one minor PVAS flare. At Month 12, 0 patients had major 
flares and 1 patient (4%) had one minor PVAS flare. At Month 18, 0 patients had PVAS flares. The 
number of major and minor PVAS relapses/flares at Months 6, 12, and 18 are provided. 
PVAS Overall Score 
Median baseline PVAS was 8 (IQR 5-15). At Month 6, 12 and 18, the median PVAS overall score was 0. 
The median change from baseline was -7.5 (IQR: -16.0 - -3.5) at Month 6, -7 (IQR: -15.0 - -5.0) at 
Month 12, and -8 (IQR: -19.0 - -5.0) at Month 18, indicating a clinically significant decrease in current 
vasculitis disease activity as shown by the overall decrease in PVAS scores from baseline. 
PVAS Remission and ADA Status 
A total of 4 out of 21 evaluable patients (19%) developed treatment-induced ADA during the Overall 
Study Period (see Section 6.1). One patient first tested positive for ADA at Month 4 and continued to 
have a positive titer at subsequent study visits (Months, 6, 9 and 18). Three additional patients first 
tested positive for ADA at Month 18. All of these 4 patients had achieved PVAS remission by Month 6 
and by Month 12 and 18.

Other efficacy endpoints 
Cumulative Glucocorticoid Dose 
A decrease in median overall oral glucocorticoid (prednisone or equivalent) use was observed over 
time, from Week 1 to Month 18 (figure below).  A clinically meaningful decrease in median oral 
glucocorticoid use was observed from Week 1 (median=45 mg [IQR: 35 – 60]) prednisone equivalent 
dose to Month 6 (median = 7.5 mg [IQR: 4-10])) during the protocol-defined oral steroid taper, which 
was subsequently maintained at Month 12 (median = 5 mg [IQR: 2-10])) and Month 18 (median = 
5 mg [IQR: 1-5]).).  
Figure 16 Median Glucocorticoid Use Over Time (Oral Administration) 
Glomerular Filtration Rate 
There was a slight decline in the median GFR between Months 6 and 18, possibly due to variations in 
disease activity in selected patients; however, by Month 18 it had returned to almost baseline levels.

Assessment of Damage: Paediatric Vasculitis Damage Index 
PVDI measures cumulative assessment of organ dysfunction, damage or scarring that has been 
present for at least 3 months and has occurred since the onset of vasculitis.  As time progresses, the 
damage index score can only either remain stable or deteriorate. PVDI had a median value of 2 at 
Months 6, 12 and 18, with median change from baseline equal to 0, indicating that after an initial 
increase between baseline and Month 6, the median PDVI damage index score subsequently remained 
stable between Months 6 and 18 (Table below).

Evaluation of Anti-Drug Antibodies on Efficacy Outcomes 
A total of 4 out of 21 evaluable patients (19%) developed treatment-induced ADA during the Overall 
Study Period (see CSR WA25615).  One patient first tested positive for ADA at Month 4 during the 
Remission Induction Phase, after the first 4 rituximab infusions, and continued to have a positive titer 
at subsequent study visits (Months, 6, 9 and 18).  Three other patients tested positive for ADA for the 
first time at Month 18. The PopPK analysis conducted in adult and paediatric patients showed that 
patients with detected ADA had 38.2% higher clearance, resulting in 27.6% lower AUC during the 
Remission Induction Phase; however, this had no impact on efficacy outcomes.  All 4 patients with 
detected ADA had achieved PVAS remission by Months 6, 12 and 18.  
Autoantibody Levels 
A total of 22 out of 25 patients (88%) were ANCA positive as measured by cytoplasmic 
immunofluorescence staining at baseline.  Of the 3 patients reported to be ANCA negative at baseline, 
1 patient was a relapsed patient who was ANCA negative at baseline but was pANCA and MPO positive 
at the time of original diagnosis, 1 patient was a relapsed patient who was ANCA negative at baseline 
but MPO positive at the time of original diagnosis, and 1 patient was newly diagnosed who was ANCA 
negative at baseline but positive for pANCA 51 days prior to baseline (outside of the 30 day window for 
baseline laboratory values).  Seropositivity for PR3-ANCA (56% of patients at baseline and 32% and 
21% by Months 6 and 12, respectively) and MPO-ANCA autoantibodies (28% at baseline and 4% and 
0% by Months 6 and 12, respectively) decreased over time from baseline.  Likewise, seropositivity for 
P-ANCA (16.7% of patients at baseline and 0% at Month 12) and C-ANCA (50% of patients at baseline 
and 13.6% at Month 12) decreased from baseline.   
CHQ-PF28 
On average, CHQ-PF28 improved between baseline and month 6 in the subscales: Physical 
Functioning, Role/Social Limitations – Emotional/Behavioral, Role/Social Limitations – Physical, Bodily

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses for the main efficacy outcome of interest, PVAS remission at month 6, was 
performed for ANCA status, disease state and Age class at baseline (Table below). There was one 
patient developing ADA before month 6, PVAS remission at 6 months is therefore not presented.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
As agreed with the PDCO the MAH has provided one pivotal single-arm trial, Study WA25615, in 
paediatric patients with severe GPA or MPA. Despite the uncontrolled nature of this study, the design is 
fully acceptable in this very rare disease setting. The MAH clearly defined the objectives of this study. 
The study’s primary objectives are safety and PK, while exploratory endpoints were efficacy objectives. 
The study design consisted of an initial 6-month remission induction phase, with a minimum 18-month 
follow-up, up to a maximum of 54 months (4.5 years) overall.  Patients were to receive a minimum of 
3 doses of IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 1 g/day) prior to the first MabThera 
IV infusion. If clinically indicated, additional daily doses (up to three), of IV methylprednisolone could 
be given. The remission induction regimen consisted of four once weekly IV infusions of MabThera at a 
dose of 375 mg/m2 BSA, on study days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in combination with oral prednisolone or 
prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/day minimum (max 10 mg/day) 
by Month 6.  After the remission induction phase, patients could, at the discretion of the investigator, 
receive subsequent MabThera infusions on or after Month 6 to maintain PVAS remission and control 
disease activity (including progressive disease or flare) or to achieve first remission. 
Patients were diagnosed using EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for GPA or Chapel Hill Consensus 
Conference criteria for MPA. This is fully acceptable from a clinical point of view. Both newly diagnosed 
and relapsing patients were included in the study: Eighteen patients (72%) had newly diagnosed 
disease upon study entry (13 patients with GPA and 5 patients with MPA) and 7 relapsing disease (6 
patients with GPA and 1 patient with MPA). The exclusion criteria clearly exclude any patient with 
limited or very severe and extensive disease, concomitant disease, etc. 
Patients were treated with four weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2 rituximab. This body-surface-area dose 
regimen was based on the assumption that mechanism of clearance and linear PK properties, and that 
PK of rituximab in children are expected to be similar to those in adults. The dose regimen is 
considered acceptable (see clinical pharmacology). 
Patients received IV methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone/prednisone in order to avoid severe 
infusion related reactions (IRRs). The doses used are fully acceptable from a clinical point of view. 
Adequate recommendations on premedication and prophylactic medications have been included in 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The MAH has defined multiple clinically relevant endpoints. Since these are all exploratory endpoints, 
there is no adjustment for multiplicity. 
There were 4 protocol amendments during the conduct of the study, but none of the amendments are 
considered critical with regards to study design and conduct of the study. After amendment (protocol 
version 5) it was allowed to include patients who had previously been treated with rituximab or other 
biologic B cell−targeted therapy (e.g., anti-CD19, anti-CD20, anti-CD22, or anti-B-lymphocyte 
stimulator [BLys]/BAFF), except if within 6 months prior to baseline visit. This was done to facilitate 
recruitment but may lead to a positive selection of included patients. However, as it appeared no 
patients with previous B-cell depleting therapy were included. 
Four patients had a total of 4 major protocol deviations. Three of the deviations were related to 
concomitant medication. One patient was included in the study despite fulfilling an exclusion criterion. 
These deviations did not have any significant impact on safety and efficacy results.  
All 25 patients completed all four once weekly IV infusions for the 6-month remission induction phase.  
A total of 24 out of 25 patients completed at least 18 months of follow-up.

Most of the patients were female, white and aged 12-17 years. There were 6 patient aged 2-11; 
however, min and max were 6 and 17 years. Children below the age of 6 did not happen to be included 
in the study, the use of rituximab in patients of the age between 2 and 6 will rely on extrapolation 
from PK/PD data. Based on similarity of the pathogenesis over age and the absence of an age effect in 
reaching PVAS remission this is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Patients below the age of 2 were not eligible for the study and will not be eligible for treatment with 
rituximab according to the SmPC. The reason is that rituximab is potentially unsafe for children in 
whom the immune system is not fully developed. 
Three patients were ANCA negative at baseline, however, one patient was a relapsed patient that was 
pANCA/MPO positive at diagnosis, the second patient was MPO positive at diagnoses, and the third 
patient was newly diagnosed and negative at baseline but became pANCA positive during treatment. 
The majority of the patients had severe disease; however, the MAH applied for an indication in “active” 
GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA. Since the disease can present itself in different degree of severity, no solid 
arguments have been provided by the MAH to treat paediatric patient with slow and few symptoms. B-
cell depletion is a serious matter and it would be inappropriate to start with rituximab in patients with 
few and mild symptoms. The inclusion criteria of study WA25615 appropriately describe children with 
‘active severe’ GPA/MPA. Mabthera is indicated in severe, active GPA / MPA in the adult population. 
Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has revised the indication accordingly. 
The majority of the patients are diagnosed with GPA, while only 6 patients had MPA. Furthermore, 
most patients were newly diagnosed. However, the CHMP acknowledged that MPA and GPA overlap as 
disease entities and that the numbers are low as it is a very rare disease. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Twenty-four out of 25 patients (96%) in Study WA25615 achieved oral glucocorticoid taper to 0.2 
mg/kg/day (or less than or equal to 10 mg/day, whichever was lower) at or by Month 6 during the 
protocol-defined oral steroid taper. 
A decrease in median overall oral glucocorticoid use was observed from Week 1 (median = 45 mg 
prednisone equivalent dose [IQR: 35 – 60]) to Month 6 (median = 7.5 mg [IQR: 4-10]), which was 
subsequently maintained at Month 12 (median = 5 mg [IQR: 2-10]) and Month 18 (median =5 mg 
[IQR: 1-5]). 
Clinically encouraging results were observed in terms of PVAS and BVAS. The proportion of patients 
with PVAS remission was 52% at month 6, 72% at month 12 and 72% at month 18. The mean 
duration of response 71.67 weeks, where the min and max are 6.9 and 193.4 weeks respectively. The 
number of major and minor PVAS relapses/flares at different time-points decreased over time, as 
expected. By month 12 no patients had PVAS flares. Similar results were observed in terms of BVAS. 
The CHMP noted that the effect in MPA and GPA patients cannot be disentangled. 
Looking at other exploratory efficacy endpoints, the median oral glucocorticoid use declined rapidly 
over the first weeks of treatment, and by month 6 it reaches a very low plateau, median 7.5 mg. 
Patients were subsequently maintained on 5 mg as per protocol. 
With regards to GFR, slight decrease was observed at month 6, but by month 18 the GFR rate was 
almost at the same level as at baseline. The paediatric vasculitis damage index (PVDI), which is a 
measure for cumulative organ damage, dysfunction or scarring, showed that from baseline to month 6, 
there is an increase in median value to 2; however, subsequently the PVDI value remained stable after 
month 6. Thus, indicating that after an initial increase in organ damage/dysfunction/scarring treatment

with rituximab stabilises the disease and thereby organ damage. Changes in CHQ-PF28 are difficult to 
interpret in meaning, and the clinical relevance unclear. 
The CHMP noted that only few patients were ANCA negative at baseline, results are difficult to interpret 
for this subgroup. It is reassuring that efficacy appears to be similar for patients with new disease or 
with a relapse of established disease (see table 28). There is no clear indication for an age effect, due 
to small numbers. Given the lack of patients between 2 and 6, the higher response proportion in the 
lower age group (see table 28) is reassuring. 
The study was not designed to evaluate rituximab in the maintenance setting, but only the induction of 
remission. Although, in the absence of comparative clinical data on maintenance strategies in children, 
the CHMP agreed that the efficacy in the maintenance regimen may be supported by the PK and 
clinical data of the RAVE and WA25615 studies. However, the lack of data on long-term safety in the 
maintenance setting was of major concern to the CHMP. The MAH was asked repeatedly to make a 
proposal, present the outline and commit to conducting a PASS study post-approval in order to 
address the concerns related to long-term safety in the maintenance setting. Regrettably, the MAH 
could not commit to conducting a PASS study in the maintenance setting. Section 4.1. has been limited 
to the induction setting.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The totality of evidence, including Mechanism of Action, disease pathophysiology, approved use in 
adults and the observed efficacy results in Study WA25615 can be considered clinically meaningful. 
Although the efficacy outcomes for this study were exploratory, they were as expected and in line with 
the results observed in the adult population. 
The majority of the patients had severe disease; however, the MAH applied for an indication in “active” 
GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA. Since the disease can present itself in different degree of severity, no solid 
arguments have been provided by the MAH to treat paediatric patient with slow and few symptoms. B-
cell depletion is a serious matter and it would be inappropriate to start with rituximab in patients with 
few and mild symptoms. The inclusion criteria of study WA25615 appropriately describe children with 
‘active severe’ GPA/MPA. Mabthera is indicated in severe, active GPA / MPA in the adult population. 
Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has revised the indication accordingly. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Study WA25615 represents the first global clinical trial investigating safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and/or pharmacodynamics (PD), and effectiveness of rituximab in paediatric patients with GPA or MPA.  
The number of patients planned and recruited into the study is reflective of GPA and MPA being rare 
diseases.  The safety and tolerability of rituximab is described for the initial 6-month Remission 
Induction Phase and the Overall Study Period (period of Remission Induction Phase together with the 
12-months Follow-up Phase with data reported until the common closeout date [CCO]).  The CCO 
occurred on 10 May 2018, 18 months after enrolment of the last patient. 
Additionally, post-marketing safety data reported in the company global safety database and in the 
published literature from paediatric patients treated with rituximab for GPA or MPA are summarized to 
further support the evaluation of safety data in pediatric patients.

Patient exposure 
All patients (100%) completed the 4 scheduled rituximab infusions (four weekly intravenous 
[IV] infusions of 375 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in the Remission Induction Phase.  Five 
patients (20%) had rituximab infusions, which were interrupted or modified (rate slowed or adjusted 
primarily due to IRRs) upon first exposure.  The mean total cumulative dose during the Remission 
Induction Phase was 2301.5 mg (range: 1290 – 3413 mg).  In accordance with the protocol, per 
investigator’s discretion, patients could receive subsequent rituximab infusions on or after Month 6 to 
maintain remission and/or to control disease activity (including disease flares). 
During the Overall Study Period, patients received between 4 and 28 infusions of rituximab (up to 4.5 
years [53.8 months]). Seventeen out of 25 patients (68%) received additional rituximab infusions on 
or after Month 6 until the CCO. Five patients received 375 mg/m2 once weekly x 4 rituximab infusions 
approximately every 6 months; 5 patients received one 375 mg/m2 rituximab infusion approximately 
every 6 months and a further 7 patients received other varied rituximab doses/regimens (e.g. one 
infusion or cycle of 4 infusions, or other dose combination at Month 9, Month15, or other time-point) 
according to their treating physician. Dosing of rituximab was weight-based (375 mg/m2) and actual 
dose received in ‘mg’ was calculated according to the patient’s body surface area (BSA) at screening as 
this is the only time it was captured in the database. Therefore, there may be a slight under 
representation of actual dose administered, as it is expected that height and weight were measured 
locally before dosing and they likely increased with age over the study duration. 
The majority of patients (68%) were followed in the study for between 18 months and 3 years.  Six 
patients (24%) were followed for over 3 years, up to a maximum of 4.5 years. The total duration of 
observation for all patients was 61.1 patient years.

The CHMP noted that the pattern of common AEs and of grade 3-4 AEs in the Remission-Induction 
Period is in line with the safety experience in adults.  
The common AEs can also be found in section 4.8 of the SmPC for adults, except for epistaxis. 
However, epistaxis and cough may well occur as manifestations of GPA/MPA. The MAH used a cut-point 
of ≥10% to denote “common AEs” for this study. This was agreed by the CHMP, as for this study it 
means that AEs occurred in more than 2 patients (of 25).  
There were 11 AEs of grade 3-4 in 7 patients, most of them (3) infections. There were 3 AEs that are 
identical to (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, vasculitis) or may be associated with (rhinalgia) the 
indication. One of the grade 3-4 AEs was an infusion-related reaction. When analysed per infusion the 
occurrence of Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) decreases from 32% to 8%, but in total 60% of the 
patients had an IRR. In the adult remission-induction RAVE study, the incidence of IRRs was the 
highest during the first infusion and decreased with subsequent infusions. It is known for rituximab 
that generally the occurrence of IRRs decreases with the number of infusions. 
In the RTX group, the proportion of patients experiencing an IRR was 12.1%, 5.1%, 4.1%, and 1.1% 
following the first, second, third, and fourth infusions, respectively. The same kind of decrease is 
noticed following the 4 infusions in the remission-induction phase in study WA25615. Use of pre-
medication to prevent infusion related reactions was applied in adults (RAVE) and in children 
(WA25615) as is described in the SmPC. The Applicant explains that a difference in definitions of IRR 
(investigator-attributed in RAVE or predefined definitions ‘Roche standard AEGT basket for 
IRRs+hypersensitivity’) may have contributed to a difference in occurrence of IRR. RAVE definitions for 
IRR were applied post-hoc to study WA25615, leading to a lower occurrence of IRR with n=6 (24%) 
children experiencing ≥1 IRR. Hence, it is likely that the occurrence of IRR in children is not higher than 
for adults with GPA/MPA.  
In the overall treatment period, the most common AEs were also GI related (as above), IRR and 
infections (primarily upper respiratory tract infections). These AEs are in line with the known safety 
profile of rituximab. Furthermore, the majority of these AEs are clinically manageable, e.g. pre-
treatment with corticosteroids before IV infusion of rituximab in order to avoid IRR.

The CHMP noted that looking at AEs deemed to be related to study treatment by the investigators, a 
similar pattern as described above is seen. Half of the patients experienced at least one AE and the 
most common AEs were IRR, GI related and infections.

  Investigator text for AEs is coded using MedDRA version 22.0.                               
  Percentages are based on N.                                                                 
  For frequency counts by preferred term, multiple occurrences of the same AE in an           
  individual are counted only once. For frequency counts of 'Total number of events' rows,    
  multiple occurrences of the same AE in an individual are counted separately.                
  The grading is based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse   
  Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.

The CHMP noted that with regards to Grade 3-4 AEs, 15 patients (60%) experienced at least one 
Grade3-4 AE. The most common AEs were infections, respiratory (bronchostenosis, hypoxia, rhinalgia 
and laryngeal obstruction) and vascular disorders (GPA). The MAH clarifies that during the remission 
induction phase no Grade 4 AEs were reported, while 11 Grade 3 AE occurred in 7 patients. Of these 
11 AEs, 10 resolved without sequelae and only one AE resolved with sequelae. There were 2 Grade 4 
AEs during the follow-up period and both resolved without sequelae.

Adverse events of special interest 
Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) 
IRRs were predominantly seen with the first rituximab infusion (8 patients [32%]).  The incidence of 
IRRs subsequently decreased thereafter with the number of rituximab infusions (20% with the second 
infusion, 12% with the third infusion and 8% with the fourth infusion).  Overall, a total of 15 patients 
(60%) experienced at least one IRR at any time during the Remission Induction Phase, irrespective of 
the infusion number. 
The most frequently reported symptoms of IRRs during the four rituximab infusions in the Remission 
Induction Phase were rash (3 events in 2 patients [8%]), headache (2 events in 2 patients [8%]), 
rhinorrhoea (2 events in 2 patients [8%]) and pyrexia (2 events in 2 patients [8%]).  For the majority 
of IRRs in the Remission Induction Phase, the rituximab dose remained unchanged (16 out of 29 
events) or was interrupted (12 out of 29 events). 
During the Overall Study Period, the incidence of IRRs decreased over time with the number of 
rituximab infusions (figure below). The most frequent symptoms of IRRs reported in the Overall Study 
Period were rash (5 events in 2 patients [8%]), urticaria (4 events in 1 patient [4%]), and vomiting (3 
events in 2 patients [8%]). The majority of IRRs during both the Remission Induction Phase and the 
Overall Study Period were Grade 1 and Grade 2 in severity.  One serious Grade 2 IRR symptom (PT: 
Generalized oedema) was reported which resolved with treatment and is discussed in the CSR.

Infections 
Infections during the Remission Induction Phase and Overall Study Period are summarized in the table 
below.  A total of 31 infection AEs (serious + non-serious) in 17 patients (68%) were reported in the 
Remission Induction Phase.  The most frequently reported infections were upper respiratory tract 
infections (4 patients [16%]).  A majority of the infections (28 out of 31 infections [90%]) were Grade 
1 or Grade 2, non-serious, and resolved with or without treatment.  Three infections during the 
Remission Induction Phase were serious and of Grade 3 severity and resolved. 
During the Overall Study Period, 105 infection AEs (serious +non-serious) were reported in 23 patients 
(92%) of which the majority (96 out of 105 AEs [91%]) were reported to be non-serious.  Similar to 
the Remission Induction Phase, the most frequently reported infections during the Overall Study Period 
were upper respiratory tract infections (12 patients [48%]) all of which were non-serious. 
There were no cases of PML or other opportunistic infections reported during the study.

Serious Infections 
Serious infections during the Remission Induction Phase and Overall Study Period are summarized in 
the Table below.  A total of 3 serious infections in 3 patients (12%) were reported in the Remission 
Induction Phase and included influenza (1 patient [4%]), lower respiratory tract infection (1 patient 
[4%]), and gastroenteritis (1 patient [4%]).  One event of serious infection (influenza) was assessed 
by the investigator as related to study treatment.  
During the Overall Study Period, 9 serious infections were reported in 7 patients (28%) and included 
influenza (2 patients [8%]) and lower respiratory tract infection (2 patients [8%]) as the most 
frequently reported events. 
Overall, the majority of serious infections resolved (8 out of 9 events) and one event resolved with 
sequelae (a serious bacterial eye infection due to Ureaplasma urealyticum).

Serious Infections with Laboratory Abnormalities of Prolonged Low Ig Levels in the Overall 
Study Period 
During the Overall Study Period, 18 patients (72%) had prolonged low IgG levels. Of these 18 
patients, 6 patients (33%) had serious infections during or after prolonged low IgG.  A total of 7 
serious infections (PTs: lower respiratory tract infection [2 cases], eye infection bacterial, 
gastroenteritis norovirus, influenza [2 cases], and sinusitis) were reported in these 6 patients during or 
after prolonged IgG.  During the Overall Study Period, 19 patients (76%) had prolonged low IgM. Of 
these 19 patients, 6 patients (32%) had serious infections during or after prolonged IgM. A total of 8 
serious infections (PT: lower respiratory tract infection [2 cases], device related sepsis, gastroenteritis 
viral, influenza [2 cases], sinusitis, gastroenteritis norovirus) were reported in these 6 patients during 
or after prolonged IgM.  Most of the infections were reported as unrelated to study treatment.  In 
summary, there was no evidence of association between prolonged low IgG or IgM and increase of 
serious infections. 
Cardiac Events 
One cardiac event (Grade 1 aortic valve incompetence) was reported in one patient during the Overall 
Study Period.  This event was reported as non-serious and unrelated to study treatment. 
Table 43 Cardiac events during remission induction phase and overall, safety-evaluable patients 
Malignancies 
No malignancies were reported in the study.  One patient experienced an AE of Grade 1 benign 
tracheal neoplasm (from the SOC Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified [including cysts and 
polyps]), which was reported on 3 different study days as non-serious, and was assessed by the 
investigator as unrelated to study treatment, with GPA being the possible etiological factor.

Hypogammaglobulinaemia 
Three patients experienced AEs of hypogammaglobulinaemia, and all of them received treatment with 
IV immunoglobulin. All 3 patients had both prolonged low IgG and IgM levels during the study as 
indicated by IgG and/or IgM laboratory values below LLN for 4 months or longer and further details are 
provided in the CSR.  
Pregnancies 
No pregnancies were reported during the study.  
Adverse Events by Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Status 
No patients were tested positive for ADA to rituximab at baseline.  A total of 4 out of 21 evaluable 
patients (19%) developed treatment-induced ADA during the Overall Study Period, of whom 1 patient 
(4%) developed ADA during the Remission Induction Phase.  This patient tested positive for ADA at 
Month 4 (Day 125), whilst 3 patients tested positive for ADA for the first time at Month 18.  All of the 4 
ADA positive patients (100%) experienced an IRR before testing positive for ADA.  One out of these 4 
patients also experienced IRRs after testing positive for ADA.  Based on available data, the occurrence 
of ADA does not appear to have a negative effect on safety.  No serious IRRs and no increase in the 
occurrence of IRRs were observed after the development of ADA. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No patients died during the study up to the CCO date.

The CHMP noted that 7 patients (28%) experienced a SAE during the remission induction phase, and 
the most common SAEs were infections. In the overall study period 12 patients (48%) experienced a 
SAE, and the most common AE was also infections. Interestingly one patients experienced suicidal 
ideation. This patient was treated with a cycle of rituximab and experienced suicidal ideation on study 
day 866. The patient was previously treated with steroids, which are known to cause psychiatric 
disorders. No firm conclusions can be drawn.  Apparently, only one SAE (influenza) was deemed 
treatment related by the investigators. As discussed previously, there were a total of 27 SAEs. It is 
seen that SAEs occur from study day 8 to 1404. All SAEs resolved. Most of the events resolved without 
sequelae, while only a few resolved with sequelae; GPA, laryngeal obstruction and bacterial eye 
infection. The two first SAEs are related to the underlying disease. 
Anti-drug Antibodies 
No patients tested positive for ADA to rituximab at baseline.  A total of 4 out of 21 evaluable patients 
(19%)  developed  treatment-induced  ADA  during  the  Overall  Study  Period,  of  whom  1  patient  (4%) 
developed ADA during the Remission Induction Phase, at Month 4 (Day 125). The 3 other patients tested 
positive for ADA for the first time at Month 18.  All of the 4 ADA positive patients (100%) experienced 
an IRR before testing positive for ADA.  One out of these 4 patients also experienced IRRs after testing 
positive for ADA.  No serious IRRs and no increase in the occurrence of IRRs were observed after the 
development of ADA. 
The CHMP noted that 4 patients tested ADA positive in the course of treatment. Due to the low patient 
numbers, further analysis of the relation between ADA positivity and safety (notably IRR) is not pursued 
by the CHMP. There are no signals from the post-marketing data regarding ADA.

Study WA25615-B-Cells  
Consistent with its mode of action, treatment with rituximab resulted in complete and sustained 
CD19+ peripheral B-cell depletion which persisted until at least Month 6, and in the majority of cases 
throughout the duration of follow-up, with administration of repeat rituximab infusions. The median 
CD19 absolute B-cell count at Day 1 baseline was 599.00 cells/µL (range: 197-2173), and mean CD19 
absolute B-cell count at Day 1 baseline was 827.55 cells/µL (SD 559.48), this deceased rapidly after 
the first infusion by Week 1 (mean 2.59 cells/µl; median 1 cell/µl). B cells depletion was sustained 
through Month 6 (mean 41.77 cells/µl; median 1 cell/µl), after which, there was some evidence of slow 
return of circulating B cells (Month 12; mean 92.82/µL; median 6 cells/µL). By Month 18, CD19 levels 
had increased but still remained below baseline levels (mean: 160.10/µL, median: 58/µL).  
Study WA25615-Immunoglobulins  
A decrease in IgA, IgG, IgM and total immunoglobulin concentrations from baseline during the Overall 
Study Period was observed. Levels of IgG decreased to below the lower limit of normal (LLN) within

the first month of treatment but then returned to normal levels. Prolonged low IgG (defined as IgG 
levels <LLN for at least a 4 month period) was observed in 18 patients (72%) during the Overall Study 
Period. Median IgM levels decreased to below the LLN by Month 2 and remained under the LLN until 
Month 18. Median IgA levels remained within the normal laboratory reference ranges throughout the 
study.

Chemistry 
Table 51 Summary of chemistry parameter shifts from baseline levels of grade 0, 1, 2 to the most 
severe grade of 3, 4 
The mean CRP level at baseline was 10.12 mg/L (SD: 12.17); Q1-Q3 was 1.8 – 14.90 (IQR = 13.10). 
The mean CRP varied throughout the first 6 months and there was interpatient variability. By month 6, 
the mean CRP had increased to 22.41 mg/L (SD 73.88); Q1-Q3 1.4-6.5 (IQR=5.10). By month 12 and 
month 18, the mean CRP had decreased to 7.25 mg/L (SD18.48); Q1-Q3 1.1 -5.00 (IQR 3.90) and 
4.12 (SD 2.96); Q1-Q3 1.10 -5.00 (IQR=3.90), respectively, and there was less interpatient 
variability. At baseline, the median CRP level was 5.00 mg/L (range 0.3 – 46.0). By month 6, the 
median CRP level was 1 mg/L lower than baseline (median range in change from baseline varied from -
33.3 to 336 mg/L). By month 18, the median change from baseline remained at 1 mg/L lower than 
baseline (median range in change from baseline varied from -40.0 to 11.1 mg/L. 
One patient had elevated ALT and AST levels in combination with elevated bilirubin levels, which were 
not reported as an AESI by the investigator because of the patient’s medical history of hepatitis and 
sickle cell disease as causes of these significant laboratory abnormalities. 
Urinalysis  
There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in urine analyses. 
VITAL SIGNS, PHYSICAL FINDINGS AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS RELATED 
TO SAFETY 
Vital Signs  
There were no clinically relevant effects on vital signs (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, 
or heart rate) over the course of the study.  No abnormal changes in the BSA, height, or weight were 
observed. 
ECGs  
All screening ECGs were normal and no AEs resulting from any ECG abnormalities were reported over 
the course of the study

Chest X-rays  
Twenty patients had chest X-rays performed at screening (note, in accordance with the study protocol, 
chest X-rays were not required for all patients at screening).  Nine out of 20 patients had abnormal X-
rays at screening, corresponding with the observation that 44% of patients had pulmonary 
involvement related to their vasculitis disease at baseline. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No AE led to withdrawal of the study treatment.  
Table  52  Adverse  events  leading  to  infusion  dose  modification  or  interruption  during  remission 
induction phase and overall, safety-evaluable patients 
The CHMP noted that there were no discontinuations due to AEs. This seems to reflect the fact that the 
AEs related to rituximab are clinically manageable with dose modifications or interruptions in this patient 
population.  There  was  a  total  of  12  patients  with  at  least  one  AE  (25  AEs  in  total)  leading  to  a  dose 
modification or interruption during the overall study period. The majority of the AEs were IRR. 
Post marketing experience 
Since the rituximab International Birth Date (IBD) (26 November 1997) until 30 September 2018 (data 
lock point of the most recent Rituximab Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report Number 1090384), 
approximately 6,371,208 patient-market exposures worldwide have been estimated for rituximab and 
exposure by indications is summarized in table below.

Evidence from Company global Safety Database 
A total of 1680 cases from the company global safety database, reporting 4315 AEs in paediatric 
patients with non-oncology indications, were analysed.  A total of 41/1680 (2.4%) cases reporting 173 
AEs (4.0%) were from patients with GPA or MPA.  Of these 41 cases, 31 cases (75.6%) reported 
events already described as ADRs for rituximab in the adult population, such as IRRs and related 
signs/symptoms, infections, and hypogammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulins below the LLN). Of the 
remaining 10 cases with AEs not known as ADRs in adult patients, in seven cases (17.1%), any causal 
relationship to rituximab was highly unlikely as there were alternative explanations and risk factors 
(events were either manifestations of the underlying condition GPA or MPA or were associated with 
past/concomitant immunosuppressants) present. In the remaining three (7.3%) cases, there was 
insufficient information for an adequate assessment. Overall, in 16/41 (39.0%) cases, the majority of 
the events appeared to be manifestations of the underlying condition GPA or MPA. 
From the total of 4315 AEs analysed, 97 (2.2%) fatal AEs were reported in non-oncology indications, 
of which, five were in GPA or MPA.  Approximately 37% of the overall fatal events reported were 
related to infections.   Out of the 4315 total AEs analysed, there were 895 infection events (20.7%) 
(27 out of 173 events [15.6%] were in GPA or MPA), 927 events (21.5%) reported as IRRs or IRR 
related signs/symptoms (21 out of 173 events [12.1%] were in GPA or MPA), 125 (2.9%) 
hypogammaglobulinemia events (five out of 173 events [2.9%] in GPA or MPA),of which, 49 (1.1%) 
hypogammaglobulinemia events were reported with infections (three out of 173 events [1.7%] in GPA 
or MPA).  In eight cases overall, the infection events occurred during/post hypogammaglobulinemia.  A 
total of 13 (0.3%) malignant events were reported and none were in GPA or MPA.  One hundred and 
sixty-four (3.8%) cardiac events were reported including nine events (5.2%) in GPA or MPA.  
The AEs were mainly reported in the age groups ≥2 years to <12 years (48.5%), and ≥12 years to <18 
years (47.1%).  The safety profile of rituximab was mostly comparable between these two age groups 
except for SOC Infections and infestations with higher proportion of AEs in patients aged ≥2 years to < 
12 years as compared to ≥12 years to <18 years paediatric patients (25.4% vs 15.8%). This difference 
could be explained by an increased susceptibility to infections in younger paediatric patients. Some 
SOCs showed a different reporting ratio (RR), which could mostly be attributed to the low number of 
AEs and/or to the differences between the number of AEs reported across the age-groups. Overall, 
4.4% AEs were reported in infants and neonates (<2 years) and were in other non-oncology 
indications.  No AEs were reported in infants and neonates in GPA and MPA. 
The evaluation also included post-marketing data from ≥2 to <6 year old patients (from a total of 257 
cases, majority of these cases [~99%] were from other non-oncology conditions).  The safety profile 
of rituximab observed in the paediatric population from post-marketing sources was overall consistent 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 85/102 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the well-known safety profile in the adult populations for the approved autoimmune indications. 
The AEs that were not known ADRs of rituximab either had alternative explanations and risk factors or 
had insufficient information for an adequate assessment. 
Evidence from Literature 
Of the 982 articles retrieved from the literature search, 90 were found relevant (i.e. articles that 
provided safety findings in paediatric patients exposed to rituximab) and the reviewed literature did 
not provide any new safety findings. The majority of the reported AEs (e.g. infections, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, IRRs) were consistent with the safety findings from the post-marketing data 
retrieved from the company global safety database, and with the known safety profile of rituximab in 
adults for the approved autoimmune indications.  
Overall there was no evidence of an increased risk of serious infections associated with 
hypogammaglobulinemia.  No specific conclusions could be made for the 2-6 years old GPA and MPA 
patients, as the reviewed publications with GPA and MPA patients included mostly patient aggregate 
data and very limited data on individual patients’ age. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Study WA25615 was an open-label, single arm study was conducted in 25 paediatric patients with 
severe, active GPA or MPA.  The overall study period consisted of a 6-month remission induction phase 
and with a minimum 18-month follow-up phase, up to 4.5 years overall.  During the follow-up phase, 
MabThera was given at the discretion of the investigator (17 out of 25 patients received additional 
MabThera treatment).  Concomitant treatment with other immunosuppressive therapy was permitted. 
All patients received the planned rituximab infusion (4 in total). At the discretion of the investigators, 
patients could continue rituximab treatment in order to keep patients in remission or control disease 
activity. The majority of patients were followed for 18 to 36 months, and 6 patients were followed for 
more than 36 months. Overall, all patients have been exposed to rituximab and followed for a 
sufficient period of time in order to allow an assessment of safety in the proposed patient population. 
Safety data are very sparse in the extended follow-up period. There were no SAE, no malignancies, no 
deaths or discontinuations due to AEs. No new safety findings. 
The most common infections in the overall phase were: upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) 
(48%), influenza (24%), conjunctivitis (20%), nasopharyngitis (20%), lower respiratory tract 
infections (16%), sinusitis (16%), viral URTIs (16%), ear infection (12%), gastroenteritis (12%), 
pharyngitis (12%), urinary tract infection (12%).  Serious infections were reported in 7 patients 
(28%), and included: influenza (2 patients [8%]) and lower respiratory tract infection (2 patients 
[8%]) as the most frequently reported events. 
Every patient experienced at least one AE during the course of the study. During the induction of 
remission phase the most common AEs were related to GI (nausea, abdominal pain and constipation), 
infections (upper respiratory tract infections) and infusion related reactions (IRR). In the overall 
treatment period, the most common AEs were also GI related (as above), IRR and infections (primarily 
upper respiratory tract infections). These AEs are in line with the known safety profile of rituximab.  
With regards to Grade 3-4 AEs, 15 patients (60%) experienced at least one Grade3-4 AE. The most 
common AEs were infections, respiratory (bronchostenosis, hypoxia, rhinalgia and laryngeal 
obstruction) and vascular disorders (GPA).  
Concerning AESI (IRR, infections, serious infections, cardiac, malignancies and 
hypogammaglobulinaemia) there were no unexpected findings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 86/102 
 
 
 
The reported IRRs were predominantly seen with the first infusion (8 patients [32%]), and then 
decreased over time with the number of MabThera infusions (20% with the second infusion, 12% with 
the third infusion and 8% with the fourth infusion).  The most common IRR symptoms reported during 
the remission of induction phase were: headache, rash, rhinorrhea and pyrexia (8%, for each 
symptom).  The observed symptoms of IRRs were similar to those known in adult GPA or MPA patients 
treated with MabThera.  The majority of IRRs were Grade 1 and Grade 2, there were two non-serious 
Grade 3 IRRs, and no Grade 4 or 5 IRRs reported.  One serious Grade 2 IRR (generalized oedema 
which resolved with treatment) was reported in one patient. 
Ninety one percent (91%) of reported infections were non-serious and 90% were mild to moderate.  
No malignancies were reported with a follow-up period of up to 54 months. 
The rate of overall infections and serious infections was not increased after the development of low 
IgA, IgG or IgM. 
During the overall study period, 3/25 (12%) patients reported an event of hypogammaglobulinaemia, 
18 patients (72%) had prolonged (defined as Ig levels below lower limit of normal for at least 4 
months) low IgG levels (of whom 15 patients also had prolonged low IgM).  Three patients received 
treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IV-IG).  Based on limited data no firm conclusions can be 
drawn regarding whether prolonged low IgG and IgM led to an increased risk of serious infection in 
these patients. The consequences of long-term B cell depletion in paediatric patients are unknown. 
There is an existing warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC which states that rituximab should not be used 
if patients have an active severe infection or are severely immunocompromised. Treatment should be 
used with caution if patients have a history of recurrent infections, or with underlying predisposing 
conditions e.g. hypogammaglobulinaemia. It is recommended that immunoglobulin levels are 
determined prior to initiating treatment with MabThera. Regarding treatment of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia, the treatment with IV IG should always be at the discretion of the treating 
physician per common clinical practice and local country guidelines, as required. 
Immunoglobins (IgA, IgG, IgM, total) decreased during the course of the study, and as discussed 
above, three patients received IV immunoglobulins due to hypogammaglobulinaemia. Chemistry: One 
patient had elevated ALT, AST and bilirubin levels. The patient had a medical history of hepatitis and 
sickle cell disease. The MAH has provided brief case narrative for this patient. No firm conclusions can 
be drawn. Therefore, this issue was not be pursued any further by the CHMP. 
It is noted that two patients had a shift in uric acid from Grade 1-2 to Grade 3. Data are too limited to 
draw any firm conclusions. Therefore, this issue was not be pursued any further by the CHMP. 
No patients died during the study up to the CCO date, but 7 patients (28%) experienced a SAE during 
the remission induction phase, and the most common SAEs were infections. In the overall study period 
12 patients (48%) experienced a SAE, and the most common AE was also infections. There were a 
total of 27 SAEs.  
There were no discontinuations due to AEs. This seems to reflect the fact that the AEs related to 
rituximab are clinically manageable with dose modifications or interruptions in this patient population. 
There was a total of 12 patients with at least one AE (25 AEs in total) leading to a dose modification or 
interruption during the overall study period. The majority of the AEs were IRR. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated with a recommendation to bring up-to-date all immunisations in 
agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating MabThera therapy. 
As discussed in the efficacy section, the lack of data on long-term safety in the maintenance setting 
was of major concern to the CHMP. The MAH was asked repeatedly to make a proposal, present the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 87/102 
 
 
 
outline and commit to conducting a PASS study post-approval in order to address the concerns related 
to long-term safety in the maintenance setting. Regrettably, the MAH could not commit to conducting 
a PASS study in the maintenance setting. Section 4.1. has been limited to the induction setting. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, all patients have been exposed to rituximab and followed for a sufficient period of time in 
order to allow an assessment of safety in the induction of remission setting. There were no 
malignancies, no deaths or discontinuations due to AEs. No new safety findings. 
The safety profile of MabThera in paediatric GPA or MPA patients in the induction of remission setting  
was consistent in type, nature and severity with the known safety profile in adult patients in the 
approved autoimmune indications with approved autoimmune diseases, including adult GPA or MPA. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 20.1 is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 1, 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.5, 8 of the SmPC 
have been updated for MabThera 100 mg and 500mg concentrate for solution for infusion. The PL was 
updated accordingly. In addition, the product information for the MabThera 100 mg and 500mg 
concentrate for solution for infusion have been combined. 
The request for combined PL was reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Childhood onset GPA and MPA are rare, potentially life and organ-threatening systemic autoimmune 
diseases affecting small and medium-sized blood vessels. If untreated, GPA and MPA progress from 
limited disease processes (e.g., inflammation centered on the upper respiratory tract or lung) to a 
generalized phase characterized by multiple systemic or renal complications of small-vessel vasculitis. 
Paediatric patients with GPA and MPA often present with clinical features of the disease similar to that 
of adult patients and share many signs and symptoms of the disease with adults (Calatroni et al. 
2017). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, there are no specific guidelines or recommendations for the treatment of paediatric GPA and 
MPA and treatment is adapted from available adult data with no clear guidance on dosage or duration 
of therapy in paediatric patients.  Treatment decisions are based on clinical features of disease activity 
(as indicated by signs and symptoms of vasculitis) or remission, and corresponding laboratory tests 
including urinalysis for assessment of proteinuria, haematuria and worsening renal function. 
There is a significant need to improve treatment options, as well as safety and efficacy outcomes, in 
paediatric GPA and MPA patients. As there are no guidelines for the treatment of paediatric patients 
with GPA or MPA, treatment of paediatric GPA or MPA relies on the studies performed in adults.  The 
patients are often exposed to cytotoxic therapies for long periods along with high percentage of 
treatment failures and disease relapses. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study WA25615 (PePRS) was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled study in 25 paediatric 
patients (≥ 2 to < 18 years old) with active GPA or MPA.  The median age of patients in the study was: 
14 years (range: 6-17 years) and the majority of patients (20/25 [80%]) were female.  A total of 19 
patients (76%) had GPA and 6 patients (24%) had MPA at baseline.  Eighteen patients (72%) had 
newly diagnosed disease upon study entry (13 patients with GPA and 5 patients with MPA) and 7 
relapsing disease (6 patients with GPA and 1 patient with MPA). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75432/2020  
Page 96/102 
 
 
 
The study design consisted of an initial 6-month remission induction phase, with a minimum 18-month 
follow-up, up to a maximum of 54 months (4.5 years) overall.  Patients were to receive a minimum of 
3 doses of IV methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 1 g/day) prior to the first MabThera 
IV infusion. If clinically indicated, additional daily doses (up to three), of IV methylprednisolone could 
be given. The remission induction regimen consisted of four once weekly IV infusions of MabThera at a 
dose of 375 mg/m2 BSA, on study days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in combination with oral prednisolone or 
prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) tapered to 0.2 mg/kg/day minimum (max 10 mg/day) 
by Month 6.  After the remission induction phase, patients could, at the discretion of the investigator, 
receive subsequent MabThera infusions on or after Month 6 to maintain PVAS remission and control 
disease activity (including progressive disease or flare) or to achieve first remission. 
All 25 patients completed all four once weekly IV infusions for the 6-month remission induction phase.  
A total of 24 out of 25 patients completed at least 18 months of follow-up.  
The objectives of this study were to evaluate safety, PK parameters, and efficacy of MabThera in 
paediatric GPA and MPA patients (≥ 2 to < 18 years old) in the induction of remission setting.  The 
efficacy objectives of the study were exploratory and principally assessed using the Pediatric Vasculitis 
Activity Score (PVAS). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The CHMP considered the dosing regimen proposed by the MAH for the induction of remission 
acceptable. The PK and PD effects of the proposed dose were evaluated in study WA25165 and the 
paediatric data were included in a popPK model with adults from the RAVE study. 
Twenty-four out of 25 patients (96%) in Study WA25615 achieved oral glucocorticoid taper to 0.2 
mg/kg/day (or less than or equal to 10 mg/day, whichever was lower) at or by Month 6 during the 
protocol-defined oral steroid taper. A decrease in median overall oral glucocorticoid use was observed 
from Week 1 (median = 45 mg prednisone equivalent dose [IQR: 35 – 60]) to Month 6 (median = 7.5 
mg [IQR: 4-10]), which was subsequently maintained at Month 12 (median = 5 mg [IQR: 2-10]) and 
Month 18 (median =5 mg [IQR: 1-5]). 
Clinically encouraging results were observed in terms of PVAS and BVAS. The proportion of patients 
with PVAS remission was 52% at month 6, 72% at month 12 and 72% at month 18. The mean 
duration of response 71.67 weeks. The number of number of major and minor PVAS relapses/flares at 
different time-points decreased over time, as expected. By month 12 no patients has PVAS flares. 
Similar results were observed in terms of BVAS. 
Looking at other exploratory efficacy endpoints, the median oral glucocorticoid use declines rapidly 
over the first weeks of treatment, and by month 6 it reaches a very low plateau, median 7.5 mg. 
Patients were subsequently maintained on 5 mg as per protocol. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The majority of the patients are diagnosed with GPA, while only 6 patients had MPA. Furthermore, 
most patients were newly diagnosed. However, the CHMP acknowledged that MPA and GPA overlap as 
disease entities. 
The popPK analysis predicted the exposures in paediatric and adult patients adequately; however, only 
patients ≥ 6 years of age were enrolled in the study and pharmacokinetics of rituximab in patients ≥2 
years of age and < 6 years of age are missing. Simulations of rituximab exposure in ≥ 2 to < 6 years 
old children and older patients with GPA or MPA with different methods to estimate PK parameters also 
indicated similar exposure across age groups. Rituximab PK data in children down to 3 years of age in

other indications have also indicated comparable PK in the youngest children. Therefore, the CHMP 
considers that it has been adequately justified that a body size-based dosing regimen in GPA/MPA will 
provide similar and acceptable exposure in the youngest children ≥ 2 to < 6 years of age even though 
no clinical data in this age group are available. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, all patients have been exposed to rituximab and followed for a sufficient period of time in 
order to allow an assessment of safety in the induction of remission setting. There was  no 
malignancies, no deaths or discontinuations due to AEs. No new safety findings. 
Limited data shows there was no trend observed in the adverse reactions reported in ADA positive 
patients. There was no apparent trend or negative impact of the presence of ADA on safety or efficacy 
in the paediatric GPA and MPA clinical trials. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited, but the observed findings are in line with the well-known safety profile 
of rituximab in the induction of remission setting. 
The lack of data on long-term safety in the maintenance setting was of major concern to the CHMP. 
The MAH was asked repeatedly to make a proposal, present the outline and commit to conducting a 
PASS study post-approval in order to address the concerns related to long-term safety in the 
maintenance setting. Regrettably, the MAH could not commit to conducting a PASS study in the 
maintenance setting. Section 4.1. has been limited to the induction setting.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Childhood onset GPA/MPA is rare and serious disease. The current treatment options include high dose 
glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide. There is a high unmet need in this patient 
population. 
Study WA25615 shows that rituximab seems to offer paediatric patients with GPA/MPA a valuable 
treatment option, where fast and sustained remission induction is achieved by 4 doses.  However, this 
comes at cost of risk of IRR and serious infections, but these risks do not outweigh the benefits. The 
safety profile of rituximab is well-known due to wide clinical use in both malignant and benign 
conditions, and the majority of the AEs related to rituximab are clinically manageable. This is also 
supported by the fact that no patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. 
The majority of the patients had severe disease; however, the MAH applied for an indication in “active” 
GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA. Since the disease can present itself in different degree of severity, no solid 
arguments have been provided by the MAH to treat paediatric patient with slow and few symptoms. B-
cell depletion is a serious matter and it would be inappropriate to start with rituximab in patients with 
few and mild symptoms. The inclusion criteria of study WA25615 appropriately describe children with 
‘active severe’ GPA/MPA. Mabthera is indicated in severe, active GPA / MPA in the adult population. 
Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH has revised the indication accordingly. 
Study WA25615 main objectives were safety and PK/PD. Efficacy objectives were exploratory. The 
study was not designed to evaluate rituximab in the maintenance setting, but only the induction of 
remission.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP considers a body size-based dosing regimen in GPA/MPA will provide similar and acceptable 
exposure even in the youngest children ≥ 2 to < 6 years of age although no clinical data in this age 
group are available. 
The totality of evidence, including Mechanism of Action, disease pathophysiology, approved use in 
adults and the observed efficacy results in Study WA25615 can be considered clinically meaningful. 
Although the efficacy outcomes for this study were exploratory, they were as expected and in line with 
the results observed in the adult population.

The safety profile of MabThera in paediatric GPA or MPA patients in the induction of remission setting 
was consistent in type, nature and severity with the known safety profile in adult patients in the 
approved autoimmune indications with approved autoimmune diseases, including adult GPA or MPA. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of rituximab is positive in the indication “MabThera, in combination with 
glucocorticoids, is indicated for the induction of remission in paediatric patients (aged ≥ 2 to < 18 
years old) with severe, active GPA (Wegener’s) and MPA”. 
4.  Recommendations

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Instanyl is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in adults already receiving maintenance 
opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of pain that 
occurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain. 
Patients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral 
morphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg oxycodone 
daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week 
or longer. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
management of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of 
abuse, misuse, addiction and overdose of fentanyl (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
Patients should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable 
adverse drug reactions. Patients must be carefully monitored during the titration process. 
Titration to a higher dose necessitates contact with the health care professional. In absence of adequate 
pain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be 
considered (see section 4.4). 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dose of Instanyl for treatment of breakthrough pain was independent of the daily maintenance 
dose of opioid in the clinical studies (see section 5.1). 
Maximum daily dose: Treatment of up to four breakthrough pain episodes, each with no more than 
two doses separated by at least 10 minutes. 
Patients should wait 4 hours before treating another breakthrough pain episode with Instanyl during 
both titration and maintenance therapy. On exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, 
patients can use Instanyl to treat it but they must wait at least 2 hours before doing so. Dose 
adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered if the 
patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or with 
more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours. 
Dose titration 
Before patients are titrated with Instanyl, it is expected that their background persistent pain is 
controlled by use of chronic opioid therapy and that they are experiencing no more than four episodes 
of breakthrough pain per day. 
Method of titration 
The initial strength should be one dose of 50 micrograms in one nostril, titrating upwards as necessary 
through the range of available strengths (50, 100, and 200 micrograms). If adequate analgesia is not 
achieved, redosing of the same strength may be administered at the earliest after 10 minutes. Each 
titration step (dose strength) should be evaluated in several episodes. 
Start at 50 micrograms 
- Use one dose of Instanyl 
- Wait 10 minutes 
Adequate pain relief with one dose of Instanyl 
Yes 
No 
Dose obtained 
Redose with same 
strength.  
Consider next higher 
strength for next episode 
Maintenance therapy 
Once the dose has been established according to the steps described above, the patient should be 
maintained on this strength of Instanyl. If the patient has insufficient pain relief, redosing with same 
strength can be undertaken at the earliest after 10 minutes. 
Dose adjustment 
Generally, the maintenance strength of Instanyl should be increased when a patient requires more than 
one dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes. 
Dose adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered 
if the patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or 
with more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the strength should be reduced or treatment with 
Instanyl be replaced by other analgesics. 
Discontinuation of therapy 
Instanyl should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain 
episodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed. 
If discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the 
physician as gradual downward opioid titration is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt 
withdrawal effects. 
Special populations 
Elderly and Cachectic population 
Limited data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety are available for the use of Instanyl in patients 
above 65 years of age. Elderly patients may have a reduced clearance, a prolonged half-life and higher 
sensitivity to fentanyl than younger patients. Limited data on pharmacokinetics are available for the 
use of fentanyl in cachectic (debilitated) patients. Cachectic patients may have reduced clearance of 
fentanyl. Caution should therefore be taken in treatment of elderly, cachectic or debilitated patients. 
In clinical trials elderly patients tend to titrate to a lower effective strength than patients less than 
65 years of age. Particular caution should be exercised when titrating Instanyl in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
Instanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
(see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Instanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Instanyl in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Instanyl is intended for nasal use only. 
It is recommended that the patient sit or stand in upright position when administrating Instanyl. 
Cleaning of the nasal spray tip is required after each use. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Before using Instanyl for the first time, the nasal spray must be primed until a fine mist appears; 3 to 
4 actuations of the nasal spray are usually required. 
If the product has not been used for a period of more than 7 days, the nasal spray must be primed again 
by actuating once before the next dose is taken. 
During the priming process product will be expelled. Therefore, the patient must be instructed that the 
priming should be conducted in a well ventilated area, pointing away from the patient and other 
people, and away from surfaces and objects that could come into contact with other people, 
particularly children. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression. 
Treatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain. 
Patients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions. 
Previous facial radiotherapy. 
Recurrent episodes of epistaxis (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Respiratory depression 
Clinically significant respiratory depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be observed 
for these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to 
respiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may be reduced. 
The use of concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory 
depression (see section 4.5). 
Chronic pulmonary disease 
In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may have more severe adverse 
reactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive. 
Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
Concomitant use of Instanyl and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs may 
result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, concomitant 
prescribing with these sedative medicines should be reserved for patients for whom alternative 
treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe Instanyl concomitantly with 
sedative medicines, the lowest effective dose should be used, and the duration of treatment should be 
as short as possible. The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory 
depression and sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their 
caregivers to be aware of these symptoms (see section 4.5). 
Impaired renal or hepatic function 
Fentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal 
impairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Instanyl have 
not been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has shown to 
be altered due to hepatic and renal impairment caused by alterations in metabolic clearance and 
plasma proteins. 
Increased intracranial pressure 
Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, 
impaired consciousness or coma. 
Instanyl should be used with caution in patients with cerebral tumour or head injury. 
Cardiac disease 
Fentanyl use may be associated with bradycardia. Fentanyl should therefore be used with caution in 
patients with previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. Opioids may cause hypotension, especially in 
patients with hypovolaemia. Instanyl should therefore be used with caution in patients with 
hypotension and/or hypovolaemia. 
Serotonin syndrome 
Caution is advised when Instanyl is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the 
serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant 
use of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair 
metabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within 
the recommended dose. 
Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), 
autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
abnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Instanyl should be discontinued. 
Hyperalgesia 
As with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, 
the possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or 
discontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated. 
Nasal conditions 
If the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking Instanyl, an 
alternative administration form for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered. 
Common cold 
The overall extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with common cold without prior treatment with 
nasal vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. For concomitant use of nasal 
vasoconstrictor see section 4.5. 
Opioid use disorder (abuse and dependence) 
Tolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration 
of opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is 
known to occur in the treatment of cancer related pain. 
Repeated use of Instanyl may lead to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Abuse or intentional misuse of 
Instanyl may result in overdose and/or death. The risk of developing OUD is increased in patients with 
a personal or a family history (parents or siblings) of substance use disorders (including alcohol use 
disorder), in current tobacco users or in patients with a personal history of other mental health 
disorders (e.g. major depression, anxiety and personality disorders). 
Patients will require monitoring for signs of drug-seeking behaviour (e.g. too early requests for refills). 
This includes the review of concomitant opioids and psycho-active drugs (like benzodiazepines). For 
patients with signs and symptoms of OUD, consultation with an addiction specialist should be 
considered. 
Withdrawal symptoms 
Withdrawal symptoms may be precipitated through the administration of substances with opioid 
antagonist activity, e.g. naloxone, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic (e.g. pentazocine, 
butorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and 
sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients 
who present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Coadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake 
Inhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase 
Inhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening 
condition. 
Instanyl is not recommended for use in patients who have received Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors 
(MAOIs) within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs inhibitors has been 
reported with opioid analgesics. 
Fentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), 
therefore potential interactions may occur when Instanyl is given concurrently with medicinal products 
that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 activity may 
reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. The concomitant use of Instanyl with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, 
and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious 
adverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression. 
Patients receiving Instanyl concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be 
carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be done with caution. 
In a pharmacokinetic interaction study it was found that the maximum plasma concentration of nasally 
applied fentanyl was reduced about 50% by the concomitant use of oxymetazoline, while the time to 
reach Cmax (Tmax) was doubled. This may reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. It is recommended that 
concomitant use of nasal decongestants is avoided (see section 5.2). 
The concomitant use of Instanyl with other central nervous system depressants (including opioids, 
sedatives, hypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, sedating antihistamines and 
alcohol), skeletal muscle relaxants and gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may produce 
additive depressant effects: hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, respiratory depression, 
coma or death may occur. Therefore, the use of any of these medicinal products concomitantly with 
Instanyl requires special patient care and observation. 
The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive CNS 
depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). 
The concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, 
pentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low 
intrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce 
withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. 
Concomitant use of Instanyl with other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered 
via the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. It is recommended that alternative 
administration forms should be considered for concomitant treatment of concurrent diseases that can 
be treated via nasal administration.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Instanyl 
should not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks. 
Following long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant. 
It is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because 
fentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn (neonate). If 
Instanyl has been administered, an antidote for the child should be readily available. 
Breast-feeding 
Fentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed 
child. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted 
until at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl. 
Fertility 
There are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male and female fertility was 
impaired at sedative doses (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
opioid analgesics are known to impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or 
operating machinery. Patients undergoing treatment with Instanyl should be advised not to drive or 
operate machinery. Instanyl can cause somnolence, dizziness, visual disturbances or other adverse 
reactions which may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Typical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Instanyl. Frequently, most of these will cease 
or decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product. The most serious adverse 
reactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory 
depression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these. 
The adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly related to treatment in the clinical trials of 
Instanyl are included in the table below. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological 
actions e.g. lethargy, coma and severe respiratory depression. Other signs may be hypothermia, 
decreased muscle tonus, bradycardia and hypotension. Signs of toxicity are deep sedation, ataxia, 
miosis, convulsions and respiratory depression, which is the main symptom. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cases of Cheyne Stokes respiration have been observed in case of fentanyl overdose, particularly in 
patients with history of heart failure. 
Treatment 
For management of respiratory depression immediate countermeasures should be started including 
physical or verbal stimulation of the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a 
specific opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Respiratory depression following an overdose may outlast 
the duration of action of the opioid antagonist. The half-life of the antagonist may be short, therefore 
repeated administration or continuous infusion may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may 
result in acute onset of pain and release of catecholamines. 
If the clinical situation warrants, a patent airway should be established and maintained, possibly with 
an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube and oxygen should be administered and respiration 
assisted or controlled, as appropriate. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be 
maintained. 
If severe or persistent hypotension occurs, hypovolemia should be considered and the condition should 
be managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, opioids, ATC code: N02AB03 
Mechanism of action 
Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic interacting primarily with the opioid μ-receptor as a pure agonist with 
low affinity for the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. The primary therapeutic action is analgesia. The 
secondary pharmacological effects are respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, 
miosis, physical dependence and euphoria. 
Clinical safety and efficacy 
The efficacy and safety of Instanyl (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) have been assessed in two 
randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pivotal studies in 279 opioid-tolerant adult 
cancer patients (age 32-86 years) with breakthrough pain (BTP). The patients had an average of 1 to 
4 episodes per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. Patients in the second pivotal study had 
earlier participated in the Instanyl pharmacokinetic study or in the first pivotal study. 
The clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Instanyl. No distinct correlation between 
the maintenance opioid dose and Instanyl doses have been established, however in the second pivotal 
study patients receiving low maintenance opioid dose tended to achieve effective pain relief with a 
lower strength of Instanyl compared to patients taking higher levels of maintenance opioid dose. This 
observation was most distinct for patients receiving Instanyl 50 micrograms. 
In the clinical studies in cancer patients, the most frequent strengths used were 100 and 
200 micrograms; however, patients should be titrated to the optimal dose of Instanyl for treating BTP 
in cancer (see section 4.2). 
All three strengths of Instanyl demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.001) higher pain intensity 
difference at 10 minutes (PID10) compared with placebo. Furthermore, Instanyl was significantly 
superior to placebo in BTP relief at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes following administration. The results of 
summary of PID at 60 minutes (SPID0-60) showed that all strengths of Instanyl had significantly higher 
mean SPID0-60 scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) demonstrating better pain relief of Instanyl 
compared to placebo during 60 minutes. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety and efficacy of Instanyl have been evaluated in patients taking the medicinal product at the 
onset of a breakthrough pain episode. Instanyl should not be used pre-emptively. 
The clinical experience with Instanyl in patients with background opioid treatment equivalent to 
≥ 500 mg/day morphine or ≥ 200 micrograms/hour transdermal fentanyl is limited. 
Instanyl in doses above 400 micrograms have not been evaluated in clinical trials. 
Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be 
seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical 
signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Fentanyl is highly lipophilic. Fentanyl exhibits three compartment distribution kinetics. Animal data 
shows that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and 
spleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl 
is approximately 80%. The absolute bioavailability of Instanyl is approximately 89%. 
Clinical data show that fentanyl is absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa. Administration of 
Instanyl in single doses ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms fentanyl per dose in opioid tolerant cancer 
patients produces a rapid Cmax level of 0.35 to 1.2 ng/ml. The corresponding median Tmax are 
12-15 minutes. However, higher values for Tmax were observed in a dose-proportionality study in 
healthy volunteers. 
Distribution 
After intravenous administration of fentanyl the initial distribution half-life is approximately 6 minutes 
and a similar half-life is seen after the nasal administration of Instanyl. The elimination half-life is 
approximately 3-4 hours for Instanyl in cancer patients. 
Biotransformation 
Fentanyl is metabolised primarily in the liver via CYP3A4. The major metabolite, norfentanyl is 
inactive.  
Elimination 
About 75% of fentanyl is excreted into the urine, mostly as inactive metabolites, with less than 10% as 
unchanged active substance. About 9% of the dose is recovered in the faeces primarily as metabolites. 
Linearity 
Instanyl shows linear kinetics. Dose linearity from 50 micrograms to 400 micrograms of Instanyl has 
been demonstrated in healthy subjects. 
A drug-drug-interaction study was performed with a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline). Subjects 
with allergic rhinitis received oxymetazoline nasal spray one hour prior to Instanyl. Comparable 
bioavailability (AUC) of fentanyl was achieved with and without oxymetazoline, while fentanyl Cmax 
decreased and Tmax increased by a factor two when oxymetazoline was administered. The overall 
extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with allergic rhinitis without prior treatment with nasal 
vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of nasal vasoconstrictor 
should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bioequivalence 
A pharmacokinetic study has shown that Instanyl single-dose and multi-dose nasal spray are 
bioequivalent. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at 
high doses (300 µg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal 
studies. Furthermore, studies in female rats revealed reduced fertility and enhanced embryonal 
mortality. More recent studies showed that effects on the embryo were due to maternal toxicity and 
not to direct effects of the substances on the developing embryo. In a study on pre- and postnatal 
development the survival rate of offspring was significantly reduced at doses which slightly reduced 
maternal weight. This effect could either be due to altered maternal care or a direct effect of fentanyl 
on the pups. Effects on somatic development and behaviour of the offspring were not observed. 
Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated. 
Local tolerance studies with Instanyl in mini-pigs demonstrated that Instanyl administration was well 
tolerated. 
Carcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year 
subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of 
oncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain 
lesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to 
humans is unknown.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Instanyl is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in adults already receiving maintenance 
opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of pain that 
occurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain. 
Patients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral 
morphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg oxycodone 
daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week 
or longer. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
management of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of 
abuse, misuse, addiction and overdose of fentanyl (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
Patients should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable 
adverse drug reactions. Patients must be carefully monitored during the titration process. 
Titration to a higher dose necessitates contact with the health care professional. In absence of adequate 
pain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be 
considered (see section 4.4). 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dose of Instanyl for treatment of breakthrough pain was independent of the daily maintenance 
dose of opioid in the clinical studies (see section 5.1). 
Maximum daily dose: Treatment of up to four breakthrough pain episodes, each with no more than 
two doses separated by at least 10 minutes. 
Patients should wait 4 hours before treating another breakthrough pain episode with Instanyl during 
both titration and maintenance therapy. On exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, 
patients can use Instanyl to treat it but they must wait at least 2 hours before doing so. Dose 
adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered if the 
patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or with 
more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours. 
Dose titration 
Before patients are titrated with Instanyl, it is expected that their background persistent pain is 
controlled by use of chronic opioid therapy and that they are experiencing no more than four episodes 
of breakthrough pain per day.  
Method of titration 
The initial strength should be one dose of 50 micrograms in one nostril, titrating upwards as necessary 
through the range of available strengths (50, 100, and 200 micrograms). If adequate analgesia is not 
achieved, redosing of the same strength may be administered at the earliest after 10 minutes. Each 
titration step (dose strength) should be evaluated in several episodes. 
Start at 50 micrograms 
- Use one dose of Instanyl 
- Wait 10 minutes 
Adequate pain relief with one dose of Instanyl 
Yes 
No 
Dose obtained 
Redose with same 
strength.  
Consider next higher 
strength for next episode 
Maintenance therapy 
Once the dose has been established according to the steps described above, the patient should be 
maintained on this strength of Instanyl. If the patient has insufficient pain relief, redosing with same 
strength can be undertaken at the earliest after 10 minutes. 
Dose adjustment 
Generally, the maintenance strength of Instanyl should be increased when a patient requires more than 
one dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes. 
Dose adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered 
if the patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or 
with more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the strength should be reduced or treatment with 
Instanyl be replaced by other analgesics. 
Discontinuation of therapy 
Instanyl should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain 
episodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed. 
If discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the 
physician as gradual downward opioid titration is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt 
withdrawal effects. 
Special populations 
Elderly and Cachectic population 
Limited data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety are available for the use of Instanyl in patients 
above 65 years of age. Elderly patients may have a reduced clearance, a prolonged half-life and higher 
sensitivity to fentanyl than younger patients. Limited data on pharmacokinetics are available for the 
use of fentanyl in cachectic (debilitated) patients. Cachectic patients may have reduced clearance of 
fentanyl. Caution should therefore be taken in treatment of elderly, cachectic or debilitated patients. 
In clinical trials elderly patients tend to titrate to a lower effective strength than patients less than 
65 years of age. Particular caution should be exercised when titrating Instanyl in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
Instanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
(see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Instanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Instanyl in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Instanyl is intended for nasal use only. 
It is recommended that the patient’s head is in upright position when administrating Instanyl. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression.  
Treatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain. 
Patients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate. 
Severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions. 
Previous facial radiotherapy. 
Recurrent episodes of epistaxis (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Respiratory depression 
Clinically significant respiratory depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be observed 
for these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to 
respiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may be reduced. 
The use of concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory 
depression (see section 4.5). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronic pulmonary disease 
In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may have more severe adverse 
reactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive. 
Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
Concomitant use of Instanyl and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs may 
result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, concomitant 
prescribing with these sedative medicines should be reserved for patients for whom alternative 
treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe Instanyl concomitantly with 
sedative medicines, the lowest effective dose should be used, and the duration of treatment should be 
as short as possible. The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory 
depression and sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their 
caregivers to be aware of these symptoms (see section 4.5). 
Impaired renal or hepatic function 
Fentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal 
impairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Instanyl have 
not been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has shown to 
be altered due to hepatic and renal impairment caused by alterations in metabolic clearance and 
plasma proteins. 
Increased intracranial pressure 
Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, 
impaired consciousness or coma. 
Instanyl should be used with caution in patients with cerebral tumour or head injury. 
Cardiac disease 
Fentanyl use may be associated with bradycardia. Fentanyl should therefore be used with caution in 
patients with previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. Opioids may cause hypotension, especially in 
patients with hypovolaemia. Instanyl should therefore be used with caution in patients with 
hypotension and/or hypovolaemia. 
Serotonin syndrome 
Caution is advised when Instanyl is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the 
serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. 
The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant 
use of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair 
metabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within 
the recommended dose. 
Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), 
autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
abnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Instanyl should be discontinued. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hyperalgesia 
As with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, 
the possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or 
discontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated. 
Nasal conditions 
If the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking Instanyl, an 
alternative administration form for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered. 
Common cold 
The overall extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with common cold without prior treatment with 
nasal vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. For concomitant use of nasal 
vasoconstrictor see section 4.5. 
Opioid use disorder (abuse and dependence) 
Tolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration 
of opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is 
known to occur in the treatment of cancer related pain. 
Repeated use of Instanyl may lead to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Abuse or intentional misuse of 
Instanyl may result in overdose and/or death. The risk of developing OUD is increased in patients with 
a personal or a family history (parents or siblings) of substance use disorders (including alcohol use 
disorder), in current tobacco users or in patients with a personal history of other mental health 
disorders (e.g. major depression, anxiety and personality disorders). 
Patients will require monitoring for signs of drug-seeking behaviour (e.g. too early requests for refills). 
This includes the review of concomitant opioids and psycho-active drugs (like benzodiazepines). For 
patients with signs and symptoms of OUD, consultation with an addiction specialist should be 
considered. 
Withdrawal symptoms 
Withdrawal symptoms may be precipitated through the administration of substances with opioid 
antagonist activity, e.g. naloxone, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic (e.g. pentazocine, 
butorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine). 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and 
sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients 
who present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Coadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake 
Inhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase 
Inhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening 
condition. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instanyl is not recommended for use in patients who have received Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors 
(MAOIs) within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs inhibitors has been 
reported with opioid analgesics. 
Fentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), 
therefore potential interactions may occur when Instanyl is given concurrently with medicinal products 
that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 activity may 
reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. The concomitant use of Instanyl with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, 
and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious 
adverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression. 
Patients receiving Instanyl concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be 
carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be done with caution. 
In a pharmacokinetic interaction study it was found that the maximum plasma concentration of nasally 
applied fentanyl was reduced about 50% by the concomitant use of oxymetazoline, while the time to 
reach Cmax (Tmax) was doubled. This may reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. It is recommended that 
concomitant use of nasal decongestants is avoided (see section 5.2). 
The concomitant use of Instanyl with other central nervous system depressants (including opioids, 
sedatives, hypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, sedating antihistamines and 
alcohol), skeletal muscle relaxants and gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may produce 
additive depressant effects: hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, respiratory depression, 
coma or death may occur. Therefore, the use of any of these medicinal products concomitantly with 
Instanyl requires special patient care and observation. 
The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive CNS 
depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). 
The concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, 
pentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low 
intrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce 
withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. 
Concomitant use of Instanyl with other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered 
via the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. It is recommended that alternative 
administration forms should be considered for concomitant treatment of concurrent diseases that can 
be treated via nasal administration. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Instanyl 
should not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks. 
Following long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant. 
It is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because 
fentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn (neonate). If 
Instanyl has been administered, an antidote for the child should be readily available. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Fentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed 
child. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted 
until at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl. 
Fertility 
There are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male and female fertility was 
impaired at sedative doses (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
opioid analgesics are known to impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or 
operating machinery. Patients undergoing treatment with Instanyl should be advised not to drive or 
operate machinery. Instanyl can cause somnolence, dizziness, visual disturbances or other adverse 
reactions which may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Typical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Instanyl. Frequently, most of these will cease 
or decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product. The most serious adverse 
reactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory 
depression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these. 
The adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly related to treatment in the clinical trials of 
Instanyl are included in the table below. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological 
actions e.g. lethargy, coma and severe respiratory depression. Other signs may be hypothermia, 
decreased muscle tonus, bradycardia and hypotension. Signs of toxicity are deep sedation, ataxia, 
miosis, convulsions and respiratory depression, which is the main symptom. 
Cases of Cheyne Stokes respiration have been observed in case of fentanyl overdose, particularly in 
patients with history of heart failure. 
Treatment 
For management of respiratory depression immediate countermeasures should be started including 
physical or verbal stimulation of the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a 
specific opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Respiratory depression following an overdose may outlast 
the duration of action of the opioid antagonist. The half-life of the antagonist may be short, therefore 
repeated administration or continuous infusion may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may 
result in acute onset of pain and release of catecholamines. 
If the clinical situation warrants, a patent airway should be established and maintained, possibly with 
an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube and oxygen should be administered and respiration 
assisted or controlled, as appropriate. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be 
maintained. 
If severe or persistent hypotension occurs, hypovolemia should be considered and the condition should 
be managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy.

5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, opioids, ATC code: N02AB03 
Mechanism of action 
Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic interacting primarily with the opioid μ-receptor as a pure agonist with 
low affinity for the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. The primary therapeutic action is analgesia. The 
secondary pharmacological effects are respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, 
miosis, physical dependence and euphoria. 
Clinical safety and efficacy 
The efficacy and safety of Instanyl (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) have been assessed in two 
randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pivotal studies in 279 opioid-tolerant adult 
cancer patients (age 32-86 years) with breakthrough pain (BTP). The patients had an average of 1 to 
4 episodes per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. Patients in the second pivotal study had 
earlier participated in the Instanyl pharmacokinetic study or in the first pivotal study. 
The clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Instanyl. No distinct correlation between 
the maintenance opioid dose and Instanyl doses have been established, however in the second pivotal 
study patients receiving low maintenance opioid dose tended to achieve effective pain relief with a 
lower strength of Instanyl compared to patients taking higher levels of maintenance opioid dose. This 
observation was most distinct for patients receiving Instanyl 50 micrograms. 
In the clinical studies in cancer patients, the most frequent strengths used were 100 and 
200 micrograms; however, patients should be titrated to the optimal dose of Instanyl for treating BTP 
in cancer (see section 4.2). 
All three strengths of Instanyl demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.001) higher pain intensity 
difference at 10 minutes (PID10) compared with placebo. Furthermore, Instanyl was significantly 
superior to placebo in BTP relief at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes following administration. The results of 
summary of PID at 60 minutes (SPID0-60) showed that all strengths of Instanyl had significantly higher 
mean SPID0-60 scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) demonstrating better pain relief of Instanyl 
compared to placebo during 60 minutes. 
The safety and efficacy of Instanyl have been evaluated in patients taking the medicinal product at the 
onset of a breakthrough pain episode. Instanyl should not be used pre-emptively. 
The clinical experience with Instanyl in patients with background opioid treatment equivalent to 
≥ 500 mg/day morphine or ≥ 200 micrograms/hour transdermal fentanyl is limited. 
Instanyl in doses above 400 micrograms have not been evaluated in clinical trials. 
Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be 
seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical 
signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Fentanyl is highly lipophilic. Fentanyl exhibits three compartment distribution kinetics. Animal data 
shows that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and 
spleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl 
is approximately 80%. The absolute bioavailability of Instanyl is approximately 89%. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical data show that fentanyl is absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa. Administration of 
Instanyl in single doses ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms fentanyl per dose in opioid tolerant cancer 
patients produces a rapid Cmax level of 0.35 to 1.2 ng/ml. The corresponding median Tmax are 
12-15 minutes. However, higher values for Tmax were observed in a dose-proportionality study in 
healthy volunteers. 
Distribution 
After intravenous administration of fentanyl the initial distribution half-life is approximately 6 minutes 
and a similar half-life is seen after the nasal administration of Instanyl. The elimination half-life is 
approximately 3-4 hours for Instanyl in cancer patients. 
Biotransformation 
Fentanyl is metabolised primarily in the liver via CYP3A4. The major metabolite, norfentanyl is 
inactive.  
Elimination 
About 75% of fentanyl is excreted into the urine, mostly as inactive metabolites, with less than 10% as 
unchanged active substance. About 9% of the dose is recovered in the faeces primarily as metabolites. 
Linearity 
Instanyl shows linear kinetics. Dose linearity from 50 micrograms to 400 micrograms of Instanyl has 
been demonstrated in healthy subjects. 
A drug-drug-interaction study was performed with a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline). Subjects 
with allergic rhinitis received oxymetazoline nasal spray one hour prior to Instanyl. Comparable 
bioavailability (AUC) of fentanyl was achieved with and without oxymetazoline, while fentanyl Cmax 
decreased and Tmax increased by a factor two when oxymetazoline was administered. The overall 
extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with allergic rhinitis without prior treatment with nasal 
vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of nasal vasoconstrictor 
should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Bioequivalence 
A pharmacokinetic study has shown that Instanyl single-dose and multi-dose nasal spray are 
bioequivalent. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at 
high doses (300 µg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal 
studies. Furthermore, studies in female rats revealed reduced fertility and enhanced embryonal 
mortality. More recent studies showed that effects on the embryo were due to maternal toxicity and 
not to direct effects of the substances on the developing embryo. In a study on pre- and postnatal 
development the survival rate of offspring was significantly reduced at doses which slightly reduced 
maternal weight. This effect could either be due to altered maternal care or a direct effect of fentanyl 
on the pups. Effects on somatic development and behaviour of the offspring were not observed. 
Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated. 
Local tolerance studies with Instanyl in mini-pigs demonstrated that Instanyl administration was well 
tolerated. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year 
subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of 
oncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain 
lesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to 
humans is unknown.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Instanyl is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in adults already receiving maintenance 
opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of pain that 
occurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain. 
Patients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral 
morphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg oxycodone 
daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week 
or longer. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
management of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential of 
abuse, misuse, addiction and overdose of fentanyl (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
Patients should be individually titrated to a dose that provides adequate analgesia with tolerable 
adverse drug reactions. Patients must be carefully monitored during the titration process.  
Titration to a higher dose necessitates contact with the health care professional. In absence of adequate 
pain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be 
considered (see section 4.4). 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The dose of Instanyl for treatment of breakthrough pain was independent of the daily maintenance 
dose of opioid in the clinical studies (see section 5.1). 
Maximum daily dose: Treatment of up to four breakthrough pain episodes, each with no more than 
two doses separated by at least 10 minutes. 
Patients should wait 4 hours before treating another breakthrough pain episode with Instanyl during 
both titration and maintenance therapy. On exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, 
patients can use Instanyl to treat it but they must wait at least 2 hours before doing so. Dose 
adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered if the 
patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or with 
more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours. 
Dose titration 
Before patients are titrated with Instanyl, it is expected that their background persistent pain is 
controlled by use of chronic opioid therapy and that they are experiencing no more than four episodes 
of breakthrough pain per day. 
Method of titration 
The initial strength should be one dose of 50 micrograms in one nostril, titrating upwards as necessary 
through the range of available strengths (50, 100, and 200 micrograms). If adequate analgesia is not 
achieved, redosing of the same strength may be administered at the earliest after 10 minutes. Each 
titration step (dose strength) should be evaluated in several episodes. 
Start at 50 micrograms 
- Use one dose of Instanyl 
- Wait 10 minutes 
Adequate pain relief with one dose of Instanyl 
Yes 
No 
Dose obtained 
Redose with same 
strength.  
Consider next higher 
strength for next episode 
Maintenance therapy 
Once the dose has been established according to the steps described above, the patient should be 
maintained on this strength of Instanyl. If the patient has insufficient pain relief, redosing with the 
same strength can be undertaken at the earliest after 10 minutes. 
Dose adjustment 
Generally, the maintenance strength of Instanyl should be increased when a patient requires more than 
one dose per breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes. 
Dose adjustment of the background opioid therapy following pain reassessment should be considered 
if the patient frequently presents with breakthrough pain episodes that are less than 4 hours apart or 
with more than four breakthrough pain episodes per 24 hours. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the strength should be reduced or treatment with 
Instanyl be replaced by other analgesics.  
Discontinuation of therapy 
Instanyl should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain 
episodes. The treatment for the persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed.  
If discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the 
physician as gradual downward opioid titration is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt 
withdrawal effects. 
Special populations 
Elderly and Cachectic population 
Limited data on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety are available for the use of Instanyl in patients 
above 65 years of age. Elderly patients may have a reduced clearance, a prolonged half-life and higher 
sensitivity to fentanyl than younger patients. Limited data on pharmacokinetics are available for the 
use of fentanyl in cachectic (debilitated) patients. Cachectic patients may have reduced clearance of 
fentanyl. Caution should therefore be taken in treatment of elderly, cachectic or debilitated patients. 
In clinical trials elderly patients tend to titrate to a lower effective strength than patients less than 
65 years of age. Particular caution should be exercised when titrating Instanyl in elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
Instanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
(see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
Instanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Instanyl in children aged below 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Instanyl is intended for nasal use only. 
It is recommended that the patient sit or stand in upright position when administrating Instanyl. 
Cleaning of the nasal spray tip is required after each use. 
Instanyl incorporates an electronic dose counter, and a lock out period between doses to minimise the 
risk of accidental overdose, misuse and abuse and to provide some reassurance to patients regarding 
these risks. Following administration of two doses within 60 minutes, Instanyl will lock for a period of 
2 hours, from the first dose taken, before another dose can be administered. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Before using Instanyl for the first time, the nasal spray must be primed. A priming sequence of 5 
actuations of the nasal spray container is required, indicated by ‘P5’, ‘P4’, ‘P3’, ‘P2’ and ‘P1’ in the 
display.  
If the product has not been used for a period of more than 7 days, the nasal spray must be primed 
again, by actuating once before the next dose is taken, this is indicated by ‘P’ in the display. 
During the priming process product will be expelled. Therefore, the patient must be instructed that the 
priming should be conducted in a well ventilated area, pointing away from the patient and other 
people, and away from surfaces and objects that could come into contact with other people, 
particularly children.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression. 
Treatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain. 
Patients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate. 
Severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions. 
Previous facial radiotherapy. 
Recurrent episodes of epistaxis (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Respiratory depression 
Clinically significant respiratory depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be observed 
for these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to 
respiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may be reduced. 
The use of concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory 
depression (see section 4.5). 
Chronic pulmonary disease 
In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may have more severe adverse 
reactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive. 
Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
Concomitant use of Instanyl and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs may 
result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, concomitant 
prescribing with these sedative medicines should be reserved for patients for whom alternative 
treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe Instanyl concomitantly with 
sedative medicines, the lowest effective dose should be used, and the duration of treatment should be 
as short as possible. The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory 
depression and sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their 
caregivers to be aware of these symptoms (see section 4.5). 
Impaired renal or hepatic function 
Fentanyl should be administered with caution to patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal 
impairment. The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Instanyl have 
not been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has shown to 
be altered due to hepatic and renal impairment caused by alterations in metabolic clearance and 
plasma proteins. 
Increased intracranial pressure 
Fentanyl should be used with caution in patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, 
impaired consciousness or coma. 
Instanyl should be used with caution in patients with cerebral tumour or head injury. 
Cardiac disease 
Fentanyl use may be associated with bradycardia. Fentanyl should therefore be used with caution in 
patients with previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. Opioids may cause hypotension, especially in 
patients with hypovolaemia. Instanyl should therefore be used with caution in patients with 
hypotension and/or hypovolaemia. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serotonin syndrome 
Caution is advised when Instanyl is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the 
serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. 
The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant 
use of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair 
metabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within 
the recommended dose. 
Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), 
autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
abnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with Instanyl should be discontinued. 
Hyperalgesia 
As with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, 
the possibility of opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or 
discontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated. 
Nasal conditions 
If the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking Instanyl, an 
alternative administration form for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered. 
Common cold 
The overall extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with common cold without prior treatment with 
nasal vasoconstrictor is comparable to that in healthy subjects. For concomitant use of nasal 
vasoconstrictor see section 4.5. 
Opioid use disorder (abuse and dependence) 
Tolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration 
of opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is 
known to occur in the treatment of cancer related pain. 
Repeated use of Instanyl may lead to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Abuse or intentional misuse of 
Instanyl may result in overdose and/or death. The risk of developing OUD is increased in patients with 
a personal or a family history (parents or siblings) of substance use disorders (including alcohol use 
disorder), in current tobacco users or in patients with a personal history of other mental health 
disorders (e.g. major depression, anxiety and personality disorders). 
Patients will require monitoring for signs of drug-seeking behaviour (e.g. too early requests for refills). 
This includes the review of concomitant opioids and psycho-active drugs (like benzodiazepines). For 
patients with signs and symptoms of OUD, consultation with an addiction specialist should be 
considered. 
Withdrawal symptoms 
Withdrawal symptoms may be precipitated through the administration of substances with opioid 
antagonist activity, e.g. naloxone, or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic (e.g. pentazocine, 
butorphanol, buprenorphine, nalbuphine). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and 
sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients 
who present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). 
Coadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic agent, such as a Selective Serotonin Re-uptake 
Inhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a Monoamine Oxidase 
Inhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening 
condition. 
Instanyl is not recommended for use in patients who have received Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors 
(MAOIs) within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAOIs inhibitors has been 
reported with opioid analgesics. 
Fentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), 
therefore potential interactions may occur when Instanyl is given concurrently with medicinal products 
that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 activity may 
reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. The concomitant use of Instanyl with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, 
and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma concentrations, potentially causing serious 
adverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory depression. 
Patients receiving Instanyl concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be 
carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be done with caution. 
In a pharmacokinetic interaction study it was found that the maximum plasma concentration of nasally 
applied fentanyl was reduced about 50% by the concomitant use of oxymetazoline, while the time to 
reach Cmax (Tmax) was doubled. This may reduce the efficacy of Instanyl. It is recommended that 
concomitant use of nasal decongestants is avoided (see section 5.2). 
The concomitant use of Instanyl with other central nervous system depressants, (including opioids, 
sedatives, hypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, sedating antihistamines and 
alcohol), skeletal muscle relaxants and gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may produce 
additive depressant effects: hypoventilation, hypotension, profound sedation, respiratory depression, 
coma or death may occur. Therefore, the use of any of these medicinal products concomitantly with 
Instanyl requires special patient care and observation. 
The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive CNS 
depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). 
The concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, 
pentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low 
intrinsic activity and therefore partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce 
withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. 
Concomitant use of Instanyl with other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered 
via the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. It is recommended that alternative 
administration forms should be considered for concomitant treatment of concurrent diseases that can 
be treated via nasal administration.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Instanyl 
should not be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks. 
Following long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant. 
It is advised not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because 
fentanyl passes through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the newborn (neonate). If 
Instanyl has been administered, an antidote for the child should be readily available. 
Breast-feeding 
Fentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed 
child. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breastfeeding should not be restarted 
until at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl. 
Fertility 
There are no human data on fertility available. In animal studies, male and female fertility was 
impaired at sedative doses (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies of the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
opioid analgesics are known to impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or 
operating machinery. Patients undergoing treatment with Instanyl should be advised not to drive or 
operate machinery. Instanyl can cause somnolence, dizziness, visual disturbances or other adverse 
reactions which may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Typical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with Instanyl. Frequently, most of these will cease 
or decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product. The most serious adverse 
reactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory 
depression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these. 
The adverse reactions considered to be at least possibly related to treatment in the clinical trials of 
Instanyl are included in the table below. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following categories are used to rank the undesirable effects by frequency of occurrence: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1000); and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of fentanyl overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological 
actions e.g. lethargy, coma and severe respiratory depression. Other signs may be hypothermia, 
decreased muscle tonus, bradycardia and hypotension. Signs of toxicity are deep sedation, ataxia, 
miosis, convulsions and respiratory depression, which is the main symptom. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cases of Cheyne Stokes respiration have been observed in case of fentanyl overdose, particularly in 
patients with history of heart failure. 
Treatment 
For management of respiratory depression immediate countermeasures should be started including 
physical or verbal stimulation of the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a 
specific opioid antagonist such as naloxone. Respiratory depression following an overdose may outlast 
the duration of action of the opioid antagonist. The half-life of the antagonist may be short, therefore 
repeated administration or continuous infusion may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may 
result in acute onset of pain and release of catecholamines. 
If the clinical situation warrants, a patent airway should be established and maintained, possibly with 
an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube and oxygen should be administered and respiration 
assisted or controlled, as appropriate. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be 
maintained. 
If severe or persistent hypotension occurs, hypovolemia should be considered and the condition should 
be managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, opioids, ATC code: N02AB03 
Mechanism of action 
Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic interacting primarily with the opioid μ-receptor as a pure agonist with 
low affinity for the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. The primary therapeutic action is analgesia. The 
secondary pharmacological effects are respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, 
miosis, physical dependence and euphoria. 
Clinical safety and efficacy 
The efficacy and safety of Instanyl (50, 100 and 200 micrograms) have been assessed in two 
randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled pivotal studies in 279 opioid-tolerant adult 
cancer patients (age 32-86 years) with breakthrough pain (BTP). The patients had an average of 1 to 
4 episodes per day while taking maintenance opioid therapy. Patients in the second pivotal study had 
earlier participated in the Instanyl pharmacokinetic study or in the first pivotal study. 
The clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Instanyl. No distinct correlation between 
the maintenance opioid dose and Instanyl doses have been established, however in the second pivotal 
study patients receiving low maintenance opioid dose tended to achieve effective pain relief with a 
lower strength of Instanyl compared to patients taking higher levels of maintenance opioid dose. This 
observation was most distinct for patients receiving Instanyl 50 micrograms. 
In the clinical studies in cancer patients, the most frequent strengths used were 100 and 
200 micrograms; however, patients should be titrated to the optimal dose of Instanyl for treating BTP 
in cancer (see section 4.2). 
All three strengths of Instanyl demonstrated statistically significant (p < 0.001) higher pain intensity 
difference at 10 minutes (PID10) compared with placebo. Furthermore, Instanyl was significantly 
superior to placebo in BTP relief at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes following administration. The results of 
summary of PID at 60 minutes (SPID0-60) showed that all strengths of Instanyl had significantly higher 
mean SPID0-60 scores compared with placebo (p < 0.001) demonstrating better pain relief of Instanyl 
compared to placebo during 60 minutes. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety and efficacy of Instanyl have been evaluated in patients taking the medicinal product at the 
onset of a breakthrough pain episode. Instanyl should not be used pre-emptively. 
The clinical experience with Instanyl in patients with background opioid treatment equivalent to 
≥ 500 mg/day morphine or ≥ 200 micrograms/hour transdermal fentanyl is limited. 
Instanyl in doses above 400 micrograms have not been evaluated in clinical trials. 
Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be 
seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical 
signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Fentanyl is highly lipophilic. Fentanyl exhibits three compartment distribution kinetics. Animal data 
shows that following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and 
spleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles and fat. The plasma protein binding of fentanyl 
is approximately 80%. The absolute bioavailability of Instanyl is approximately 89%. 
Clinical data show that fentanyl is absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa. Administration of 
Instanyl in single doses ranging from 50 to 200 micrograms fentanyl per dose in opioid tolerant cancer 
patients produces a rapid Cmax level of 0.35 to 1.2 ng/ml. The corresponding median Tmax are 
12-15 minutes. However, higher values for Tmax were observed in a dose-proportionality study in 
healthy volunteers. 
Distribution 
After intravenous administration of fentanyl the initial distribution half-life is approximately 6 minutes 
and a similar half-life is seen after the nasal administration of Instanyl. The elimination half-life is 
approximately 3-4 hours for Instanyl in cancer patients. 
Biotransformation 
Fentanyl is metabolised primarily in the liver via CYP3A4. The major metabolite, norfentanyl is 
inactive.  
Elimination 
About 75% of fentanyl is excreted into the urine, mostly as inactive metabolites, with less than 10% as 
unchanged active substance. About 9% of the dose is recovered in the faeces primarily as metabolites. 
Linearity 
Instanyl shows linear kinetics. Dose linearity from 50 micrograms to 400 micrograms of Instanyl has 
been demonstrated in healthy subjects. 
A drug-drug-interaction study was performed with a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline). Subjects 
with allergic rhinitis received oxymetazoline nasal spray one hour prior to Instanyl. Comparable 
bioavailability (AUC) of fentanyl was achieved with and without oxymetazoline, while fentanyl Cmax 
decreased and Tmax increased by a factor two when oxymetazoline was administered. The overall 
extent of fentanyl exposure in subjects with allergic rhinitis without prior treatment with nasal

Bioequivalence 
A pharmacokinetic study has shown that Instanyl single-dose and multi-dose nasal spray are 
bioequivalent. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at 
high doses (300 µg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal 
studies. Furthermore, studies in female rats revealed reduced fertility and enhanced embryonal 
mortality. More recent studies showed that effects on the embryo were due to maternal toxicity and 
not to direct effects of the substances on the developing embryo. In a study on pre- and postnatal 
development the survival rate of offspring was significantly reduced at doses which slightly reduced 
maternal weight. This effect could either be due to altered maternal care or a direct effect of fentanyl 
on the pups. Effects on somatic development and behaviour of the offspring were not observed. 
Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated. 
Local tolerance studies with Instanyl in mini-pigs demonstrated that Instanyl administration was well 
tolerated. 
Carcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year 
subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not reveal any findings indicative of 
oncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain 
lesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate. The relevance of these findings to 
humans is unknown.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Instanyl is and what it is used for 
Instanyl contains the active substance fentanyl and belongs to a group of strong painkillers called 
opioids. Opioids act by blocking the pain signals to the brain.  
Instanyl acts rapidly and is used for relieving breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients already treated 
with opioids for their usual pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden pain that occurs despite 
you having taken your usual opioid pain relieving medicines. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Instanyl 
Do not use Instanyl 
- 
if you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, 
hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least 
a week, to control your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not 
use Instanyl, because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow 
and/or shallow, or even stop. 
If you are taking a medicine which contains sodium oxybate. 
if you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain. 
if you have serious difficulties breathing or suffer from a serious obstructive lung disease. 
if you have previously received facial radiotherapy. 
if you suffer from recurrent episodes of nose bleeding. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Instanyl, especially: 
- 
if you suffer from a long-term obstructive lung disease, your breathing may be impaired by 
Instanyl. 
if you have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate, low blood pressure or low 
blood volume.

- 
if you have problems with your liver or kidneys. 
if you have problems with your brain function, e.g. due to a brain tumour, a head injury or 
increased intracranial pressure. 
if you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) 
with opioid use. 
if you or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs (“addiction”). 
if you are a smoker. 
if you have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or 
have been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses. 
if you take sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs (please also refer to the 
section ‘Other medicines and Instanyl’). 
if you take antidepressants or antipsychotics (please also refer to the section ‘Other medicines 
and Instanyl’). 
if you take medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and 
pentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain) as you may experience symptoms of withdrawal 
syndrome. Please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and Instanyl’ for more information. 
if you use other nasal spray products, e.g. for common cold or allergy. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Instanyl can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. 
If you experience difficulties breathing while being treated with Instanyl, it is very important 
that you contact your doctor or hospital immediately. 
Consult your doctor while using Instanyl, if: 
- 
- 
you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. 
you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a 
potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the 
adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. 
If you experience recurrent nose bleeding or nasal discomfort whilst being treated with Instanyl, you 
must contact your doctor, who will consider alternative treatment for your breakthrough pain. 
Repeated use of Instanyl may lead to dependence and abuse which may result in life-threatening 
overdose. If you think you are becoming dependent on Instanyl, it is important that you consult your 
doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Instanyl should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.  
Other medicines and Instanyl 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Instanyl may affect or be affected by other medicines. 
Special care should be taken if you are treated with any of the following medicines: 
- 
Other medicines for pain and some painkillers for nerve pain (such as gabapentin and 
pregabalin). 
any medicines which might normally make you sleepy (have a sedative effect) such as sleeping 
pills, sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related medicines, medicines to treat 
- 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anxiety, antihistamines, or tranquillisers, skeletal muscle relaxants and gabapentinoids 
(gabapentin and pregabalin). The use of such other medicines at the same time as Instanyl, may 
cause risk of drowsiness, deep sedation and affect your ability to breathe (respiratory 
depression), which may lead to coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant 
use should only be considered when other treatment options are not possible.  
However if your doctor does prescribe Instanyl together with sedative medicines the dose and 
duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. 
Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor’s 
dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of 
the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Instanyl, 
such as: 
• 
ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV 
infection); 
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole (used for treatment 
of fungal infections); 
troleandomycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin (medicines for treatment of bacterial 
infections); 
aprepitant (used to treat severe nausea); 
diltiazem and verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart 
diseases). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
medicines called Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) used for severe depression, even if 
you have been treated with one in the past 2 weeks. 
The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or 
antipsychotics. Instanyl may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental 
status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature 
above 38 °C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, 
muscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether Instanyl is suitable for you. 
medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine 
(medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating). 
other medicines taken via the nose, especially oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and similar 
medicines, which are used for relief of nose congestions. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Instanyl with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not drink alcohol whilst being treated with Instanyl, as it can increase the risk of experiencing 
dangerous side effects. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Instanyl should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor. 
Instanyl should not be used during childbirth because fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems 
in the new-born child. 
Fentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use 
Instanyl if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the 
last dose of Instanyl. 
Driving and using machines 
You should not drive or use machinery whilst being treated with Instanyl. Instanyl can cause 
dizziness, drowsiness and visual disturbances, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How to use Instanyl 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
The dose of Instanyl is independent of your usual cancer pain treatment. 
When you first start using Instanyl, your doctor will work with you to find the dose that will relieve 
your breakthrough pain. 
The initial dose is one puff of 50 micrograms in one nostril each time you have an episode of 
breakthrough pain. During the determination of your right dose, your doctor may instruct you to 
change to a higher dose.  
If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 10 minutes, you may use only one puff more for this 
episode. 
Generally you should wait 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. On 
exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, you can use Instanyl to treat it but you must 
wait at least 2 hours before doing so. If you regularly have breakthrough pain episodes that are less 
than 4 hours apart, contact your doctor as your usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed. 
You can use Instanyl to treat up to four episodes of breakthrough pain per day. 
If you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day, contact your doctor, as your 
usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed. 
In order to keep track of the number of doses of Instanyl used, you should use the tick-boxes in the 
booklet placed on top of the child-resistant outer box. 
Do not change the dose of Instanyl or your other pain medicines on your own. Change in dose must be 
done together with your doctor. 
Instanyl is for nasal use. 
Please read the instruction for use at the end of this leaflet to learn how to use Instanyl. 
If you use more Instanyl than you should or if you think someone has accidentally used Instanyl 
You should contact your doctor, hospital or emergency room for assessment of the risk and for advice 
if you have taken more Instanyl than you should. 
Symptoms of overdose are: 
Sleepiness, drowiness, dizziness, reduced body temperature, slow heart beat, difficulties coordinating 
arms and legs. 
In serious cases taking too much Instanyl may cause coma, sedation, convulsions or severe breathing 
difficulties (very slow or shallow breathing). 
If you feel any of the above symptoms you should seek immediate medical assistance. 
Note to carers 
If you see the person taking Instanyl suddenly acting slowly, having difficulties breathing or if you 
have difficulties waking the person up: 
- 
- 
you should immediately call for emergency help. 
while waiting for the emergency help, you must try to keep the person awake by talking to or 
gently shaking the person every now and then. 
if the person has difficulty breathing, you should prompt the person to breathe in every 
5-10 seconds. 
if the person has stopped breathing, you should attempt to resuscitate her/him until emergency 
help arrives. 
- 
- 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you think someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, please seek immediate medical assistance. Try to 
keep the person awake until emergency help arrives. 
If someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, they may have the same symptoms as described above for 
overdose. 
If you forget to use Instanyl 
If the breakthrough pain is still ongoing, you may take Instanyl as prescribed by your doctor. If the 
breakthrough pain has stopped, do not take Instanyl until the next episode of breakthrough pain 
occurs. 
If you stop using Instanyl 
You should discontinue Instanyl when you no longer have any breakthrough pain. You should 
however continue to take your usual pain relieving medicine to treat your cancer pain. Contact your 
doctor to confirm the correct dose of your usual medicine if you are not sure. 
You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side effects of Instanyl when 
discontinuing Instanyl. If you experience withdrawal symptoms, you should contact your doctor. Your 
doctor will evaluate if you need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

which separates the nostrils. 
Prolonged treatment with fentanyl during pregnancy may cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn 
which can be life-threatening (see section 2) 
You should tell your doctor if you experience recurrent episodes of nose bleeding or nasal discomfort. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
5.  How to store Instanyl 
The pain-relieving medicine in Instanyl is very strong and can be life-threatening to children. 
Instanyl must be kept out of the sight and reach of children. Always place the nasal spray in the 
child-resistant box after use. 
Do not use Instanyl after the expiry date which is stated on the bottle after EXP. The expiry date refers 
to the last day of the month. 
Store below 30 °C. Keep the nasal spray stored upright. Do not freeze. If Instanyl nasal spray is frozen 
the spray pump may crack. If uncertain of how the pump has been stored, you should check the spray 
pump before use.  
Instanyl that has passed the expiry date or is no longer required, may still contain enough medicine to 
be harmful to other people, especially children. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or 
household waste. Any used or unused nasal spray should be returned systematically and suitably in the 
child-resistant outer box and discarded according to local requirements or returned to the pharmacy. 
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to 
protect the environment.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF INSTANYL NASAL SPRAY 
Please read the following instructions carefully to learn how to use Instanyl nasal spray: 
Preparing Instanyl nasal spray for use: 
- 
It must be pumped 3 or 4 times (primed) until a fine mist appears. 
Before using the nasal spray for the first time:  
• 
During this priming process medicine will be expelled. Therefore: 
• 
Priming should be performed in a well ventilated area. 
• 
Do not point the nasal spray in the direction of yourself and other people. 
• 
Do not point in the direction of surfaces and objects that could come into contact 
with other people, particularly children. 
If you have not used Instanyl for more than 7 days the pump must be primed again by spraying 
once before the next dose is taken. 
- 
- 
Instanyl nasal spray should be used in the following way: 
1.  Blow your nose if it feels blocked or you have a cold. 
2.  You should sit or stand in upright position. 
3.  Remove the protective cap from the spray. 
4.  Hold the nasal spray upright. 
5.  Bend your head slightly forward. 
6.  Close one nostril by placing your finger against the side of your nose and insert the spray tip into 
the other nostril (approximately 1 cm). It does not matter which nostril you use. If you have to 
take a second dose after 10 minutes to get sufficient pain relief, this dose should be taken in the 
other nostril. 
7.  Press the pump down quickly and completely with two fingers, once, while breathing in through 
your nose. You must make sure the pump is pressed all the way down. You may not feel the dose 
in your nose, but you have received it when you have pressed the pump. 
8.  Clean the nasal spray tip after use with a clean tissue, and then throw away the tissue afterwards. 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If after 10 minutes you need a second dose of Instanyl to relieve your pain, repeat steps 1 to 8 in the 
other nostril. 
Always place Instanyl in the child-resistant box after use. Keep out of the sight and reach of 
children. 
Keep track of how many doses you have used and how many you have left in your nasal spray by 
using the dose-counting card provided with Instanyl nasal spray. Every time you use Instanyl nasal 
spray, make sure you or your carer fills in the information on the card.  
If Instanyl nasal spray is blocked or does not spray properly: 
• 
If it is blocked, aim the nasal spray away from you (and any other people) and push firmly down 
on the pump. This should clear any blockage.  
If your nasal spray is still not working properly, talk to your pharmacist. Never try to fix the 
nasal spray yourself or take it apart. This is because it may then give you the wrong dose.

1.  What Instanyl is and what it is used for 
Instanyl contains the active substance fentanyl and belongs to a group of strong painkillers called 
opioids. Opioids act by blocking the pain signals to the brain.  
Instanyl acts rapidly and is used for relieving breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients already treated 
with opioids for their usual pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden pain that occurs despite 
you having taken your usual opioid pain relieving medicines. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Instanyl 
Do not use Instanyl 
- 
if you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, 
hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least 
a week, to control your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not 
use Instanyl, because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow 
and/or shallow, or even stop.

if you have problems with your liver or kidneys. 
if you have problems with your brain function, e.g. due to a brain tumour, a head injury or 
increased intracranial pressure. 
if you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) 
with opioid use. 
if you or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs (“addiction”). 
if you are a smoker. 
if you have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or 
have been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses. 
if you take sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs (please also refer to the 
section ‘Other medicines and Instanyl’). 
if you take antidepressants or antipsychotics (please also refer to the section ‘Other medicines 
and Instanyl’). 
if you take medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and 
pentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain) as you may experience symptoms of withdrawal 
syndrome. Please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and Instanyl’ for more information. 
if you use other nasal spray products, e.g. for common cold or allergy. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Instanyl can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. 
If you experience difficulties breathing while being treated with Instanyl, it is very important 
that you contact your doctor or hospital immediately. 
Consult your doctor while using Instanyl, if: 
- 
- 
you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. 
you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a 
potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the 
adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. 
If you experience recurrent nose bleeding or nasal discomfort whilst being treated with Instanyl, you 
must contact your doctor, who will consider alternative treatment for your breakthrough pain. 
Repeated use of Instanyl may lead to dependence and abuse which may result in life-threatening 
overdose. If you think you are becoming dependent on Instanyl, it is important that you consult your 
doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Instanyl should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Instanyl 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Instanyl may affect or be affected by other medicines. 
Special care should be taken if you are treated with any of the following medicines:  
- 
Other medicines for pain and some painkillers for nerve pain (such as gabapentin and 
pregabalin). 
any medicines which might normally make you sleepy (have a sedative effect) such as sleeping 
pills, sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related medicines, medicines to treat 
- 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anxiety, antihistamines, or tranquillisers, skeletal muscle relaxants and gabapentinoids 
(gabapentin and pregabalin). The use of such other medicines at the same time as Instanyl, may 
cause risk of drowsiness, deep sedation and affect your ability to breathe (respiratory 
depression), which may lead to coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant 
use should only be considered when other treatment options are not possible. 
However if your doctor does prescribe Instanyl together with sedative medicines the dose and 
duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. 
Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor’s 
dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of 
the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Instanyl, 
such as: 
• 
ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV 
infection); 
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole (used for treatment 
of fungal infections); 
troleandomycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin (medicines for treatment of bacterial 
infections); 
aprepitant (used to treat severe nausea); 
diltiazem and verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart 
diseases). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
medicines called Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) used for severe depression, even if 
you have been treated with one in the past 2 weeks. 
The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or 
antipsychotics. Instanyl may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental 
status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature 
above 38 °C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, 
muscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether Instanyl is suitable for you. 
medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine 
(medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating). 
other medicines taken via the nose, especially oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and similar 
medicines, which are used for relief of nose congestions. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Instanyl with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not drink alcohol whilst being treated with Instanyl, as it can increase the risk of experiencing 
dangerous side effects. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Instanyl should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor. 
Instanyl should not be used during childbirth because fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems 
in the new-born child. 
Fentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use 
Instanyl if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the last 
dose of Instanyl. 
Driving and using machines 
You should not drive or use machinery whilst being treated with Instanyl. Instanyl can cause 
dizziness, drowsiness and visual disturbances, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.

3.  How to use Instanyl 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
The dose of Instanyl is independent of your usual cancer pain treatment. 
When you first start using Instanyl, your doctor will work with you to find the dose that will relieve 
your breakthrough pain. 
The initial dose is one puff of 50 micrograms in one nostril each time you have an episode of 
breakthrough pain. During the determination of your right dose, your doctor may instruct you to 
change to a higher dose.  
If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 10 minutes, you may use only one puff more for this 
episode. 
Generally you should wait 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. On 
exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, you can use Instanyl to treat it but you must 
wait at least 2 hours before doing so. If you regularly have breakthrough pain episodes that are less 
than 4 hours apart, contact your doctor as your usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed. 
You can use Instanyl to treat up to four episodes of breakthrough pain per day. 
If you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day, contact your doctor, as your 
usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed. 
Do not change the dose of Instanyl or your other pain medicines on your own. Change in dose must be 
done together with your doctor. 
Instanyl is for nasal use. 
Please read the instruction for use at the end of this leaflet to learn how to use Instanyl. 
If you use more Instanyl than you should or if you think someone has accidentally used Instanyl 
You should contact your doctor, hospital or emergency room for assessment of the risk and for advice 
if you have taken more Instanyl than you should. 
Symptoms of overdose are:  
Sleepiness, drowiness, dizziness, reduced body temperature, slow heart beat, difficulties coordinating 
arms and legs. 
In serious cases taking too much Instanyl may cause coma, sedation, convulsions or severe breathing 
difficulties (very slow or shallow breathing). 
If you feel any of the above symptoms you should seek immediate medical assistance. 
Note to carers 
If you see the person taking Instanyl suddenly acting slowly, having difficulties breathing or if you 
have difficulties waking the person up: 
- 
- 
you should immediately call for emergency help. 
while waiting for the emergency help, you must try to keep the person awake by talking to or 
gently shaking the person every now and then. 
if the person has difficulty breathing, you should prompt the person to breathe in every 
5-10 seconds. 
if the person has stopped breathing, you should attempt to resuscitate her/him until emergency 
help arrives. 
- 
- 
If you think someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, please seek immediate medical assistance. Try to 
keep the person awake until emergency help arrives. 
103 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, they may have the same symptoms as described above for 
overdose. 
If you forget to use Instanyl 
If the breakthrough pain is still ongoing, you may take Instanyl as prescribed by your doctor. If the 
breakthrough pain has stopped, do not take Instanyl until the next episode of breakthrough pain 
occurs. 
If you stop using Instanyl 
You should discontinue Instanyl when you no longer have any breakthrough pain. You should 
however continue to take your usual pain relieving medicine to treat your cancer pain. Contact your 
doctor to confirm the correct dose of your usual medicine if you are not sure. 
You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side effects of Instanyl when 
discontinuing Instanyl. If you experience withdrawal symptoms, you should contact your doctor. Your 
doctor will evaluate if you need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF INSTANYL SINGLE-DOSE NASAL SPRAY 
Please read the following instructions carefully to learn how to use Instanyl single-dose nasal spray: 
•  Each single-dose container is sealed in a child-resistant blister. Do not open the blister before you 
are ready to use the spray. Each single-dose container contains only one dose of Instanyl. Do not 
test before use. 
•  To open cut with scissors along the line (above the scissors symbol) on the blister. Hold the edge 
of the foil, peel the foil back and take the nasal spray out. 
•  Blow your nose if it feels blocked or you have a cold. 
•  Gently hold the single-dose container with your thumb supporting it at the plunger at the bottom 
and your index and middle finger on either side of the spray tip (see drawing). Do not press the 
plunger yet.  
•  Block one nostril by placing your other index finger against the side of your nose and insert the 
spray tip into the other nostril (approximately 1 cm). It does not matter which nostril you use. If 
you have to take a second dose after 10 minutes to get sufficient pain relief, this dose should be 
taken in the other nostril. 
•  Keep your head upright 
•  Press the plunger upwards firmly to release the dose with your thumb while inhaling gently 
through the nose and then remove the spray container from the nose. You may not feel the dose in 
your nose, but you have received it when the plunger has been pressed up. 
Your single-dose container is now empty

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Instanyl is and what it is used for 
Instanyl contains the active substance fentanyl and belongs to a group of strong painkillers called 
opioids. Opioids act by blocking the pain signals to the brain.  
Instanyl acts rapidly and is used for relieving breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients already treated 
with opioids for their usual pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden pain that occurs despite 
you having taken your usual opioid pain relieving medicines. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Instanyl 
Do not use Instanyl 
- 
if you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, 
hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least 
a week, to control your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not 
use Instanyl, because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow 
and/or shallow, or even stop. 
If you are taking a medicine which contains sodium oxybate. 
if you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain. 
if you have serious difficulties breathing or suffer from a serious obstructive lung disease. 
if you have previously received facial radiotherapy. 
if you suffer from recurrent episodes of nose bleeding. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Instanyl, especially: 
- 
if you suffer from a long-term obstructive lung disease, your breathing may be impaired by 
Instanyl. 
if you have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate, low blood pressure or low 
blood volume.

if you have problems with your liver or kidneys. 
if you have problems with your brain function, e.g. due to a brain tumour, a head injury or 
increased intracranial pressure. 
if you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) 
with opioid use. 
if you or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs (“addiction”). 
if you are a smoker. 
if you have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or 
have been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses. 
if you take sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs (please also refer to the 
section ‘Other medicines and Instanyl’). 
if you take antidepressants or antipsychotics (please also refer to the section ‘Other medicines 
and Instanyl’). 
if you take medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and 
pentazocine (medicines for treatment of pain) as you may experience symptoms of withdrawal 
syndrome. Please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and Instanyl’ for more information. 
if you use other nasal spray products, e.g. for common cold or allergy. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Instanyl can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. 
If you experience difficulties breathing while being treated with Instanyl, it is very important 
that you contact your doctor or hospital immediately. 
Consult your doctor while using Instanyl, if: 
- 
- 
you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. 
you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a 
potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the 
adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. 
If you experience recurrent nose bleeding or nasal discomfort whilst being treated with Instanyl, you 
must contact your doctor, who will consider alternative treatment for your breakthrough pain. 
Repeated use of Instanyl may lead to dependence and abuse which may result in life-threatening 
overdose. If you think you are becoming dependent on Instanyl, it is important that you contact your 
doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Instanyl should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Instanyl 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
Instanyl may affect or be affected by other medicines. 
Special care should be taken if you are treated with any of the following medicines: 
- 
Other medicines for pain and some painkillers for nerve pain (such as gabapentin and 
pregabalin). 
any medicines which might normally make you sleepy (have a sedative effect) such as sleeping 
pills, sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related medicines, medicines to treat

(gabapentin and pregabalin). The use of such other medicines at the same time as Instanyl, may 
cause risk of drowsiness, deep sedation and affect your ability to breathe (respiratory 
depression), which may lead to coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant 
use should only be considered when other treatment options are not possible. 
However if your doctor does prescribe Instanyl together with sedative medicines the dose and 
duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. 
Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor’s 
dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of 
the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
any medicines that might have an effect on the way in which your body breaks down Instanyl, 
such as: 
• 
ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and fosamprenavir (medicines that help control HIV 
infection); 
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole (used for treatment 
of fungal infections); 
troleandomycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin (medicines for treatment of bacterial 
infections); 
aprepitant (used to treat severe nausea); 
diltiazem and verapamil (medicines for treatment of high blood pressure or heart 
diseases). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
medicines called Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) used for severe depression, even if 
you have been treated with one in the past 2 weeks. 
The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or 
antipsychotics. Instanyl may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental 
status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature 
above 38 °C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, 
muscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether Instanyl is suitable for you. 
medicines called partial agonist/antagonists e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine and pentazocine 
(medicines for treatment of pain). You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating). 
Other medicines taken via the nose, especially oxymetazoline, xylometazoline and similar 
medicines, which are used for relief of nose congestions.

- 
Instanyl with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not drink alcohol whilst being treated with Instanyl, as it can increase the risk of experiencing 
dangerous side effects. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Instanyl should not be used during pregnancy unless you have discussed this with your doctor. 
Instanyl should not be used during childbirth because fentanyl may cause serious breathing problems 
in the new-born child. 
Fentanyl can get into breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed infant. Do not use 
Instanyl if you are breast-feeding. You should not start breast-feeding until at least 5 days after the 
last dose of Instanyl. 
Driving and using machines 
You should not drive or use machinery whilst being treated with Instanyl. Instanyl can cause 
dizziness, drowsiness and visual disturbances, which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.

3.  How to use Instanyl 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
The dose of Instanyl is independent of your usual cancer pain treatment. 
When you first start using Instanyl, your doctor will work with you to find the dose that will relieve 
your breakthrough pain. 
The initial dose is one puff of 50 micrograms in one nostril each time you have an episode of 
breakthrough pain. During the determination of your right dose, your doctor may instruct you to 
change to a higher dose. 
If your breakthrough pain is not relieved after 10 minutes, you may use only one puff more for this 
episode.  
Generally you should wait 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain. On 
exceptional occasions where a new episode occurs earlier, you can use Instanyl to treat it but you must 
wait at least 2 hours before doing so. If you regularly have breakthrough pain episodes that are less 
than 4 hours apart, contact your doctor as your usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed. 
You can use Instanyl to treat up to four episodes of breakthrough pain per day. 
If you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day, contact your doctor, as your 
usual cancer pain treatment may have to be changed. 
Do not change the dose of Instanyl or your other pain medicines on your own. Change in dose 
must be done together with your doctor. 
Instanyl incorporates an electronic dose counter, and a lock out period between doses to reduce the 
risk of overdose, and helps you to use it adequately. The dose counter enables you, and your doctor, to 
monitor and adapt your use. After two doses are taken within 60 minutes, Instanyl will lock for a 
period of 2 hours, from the first dose taken, until another dose can be administered.  
Instanyl is for nasal use. 
Please read the instructions for use on the back of this leaflet to learn how to use the nasal spray. 
If you use more Instanyl than you should or if you think someone has accidentally used Instanyl 
You should contact your doctor, hospital or emergency room for assessment of the risk and for advice 
if you have taken more Instanyl than you should. 
Symptoms of overdose are: 
Sleepiness, drowiness, dizziness, reduced body temperature, slow heart beat, difficulties coordinating 
arms and legs. 
In serious cases taking too much Instanyl may cause coma, sedation, convulsions or severe breathing 
difficulties (very slow or shallow breathing). 
If you feel any of the above symptoms you should seek immediate medical assistance. 
Note to carers 
If you see the person taking Instanyl suddenly acting slowly, having difficulties breathing or if you 
have difficulties waking the person up: 
- 
- 
you should immediately call for emergency help. 
while waiting for the emergency help, you must try to keep the person awake by talking to or 
gently shaking the person every now and then. 
if the person has difficulty breathing, you should prompt the person to breathe in every 
5-10 seconds. 
- 
112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
if the person has stopped breathing, you should attempt to resuscitate her/him until emergency 
help arrives. 
If you think someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, please seek immediate medical assistance. Try to 
keep the person awake until emergency help arrives. 
If someone has accidentally taken Instanyl, they may have the same symptoms as described above for 
overdose. 
If you forget to use Instanyl 
If the breakthrough pain is still ongoing, you may take Instanyl as prescribed by your doctor. If the 
breakthrough pain has stopped, do not take Instanyl until the next episode of breakthrough pain 
occurs.  
If you stop using Instanyl 
You should discontinue Instanyl when you no longer have any breakthrough pain. You should 
however continue to take your usual pain relieving medicine to treat your cancer pain. Contact your 
doctor to confirm the correct dose of your usual medicine if you are not sure. 
You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side effects of Instanyl when 
discontinuing Instanyl. If you experience withdrawal symptoms, you should contact your doctor. Your 
doctor will evaluate if you need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

5.  How to store Instanyl 
The pain-relieving medicine in Instanyl is very strong and can be life-threatening to children. 
Instanyl must be kept out of the sight and reach of children. Always close after use by putting 
the child-resistant cap back on to the nasal spray. 
Do not use Instanyl after the expiry date which is stated on the nasal spray after EXP. The expiry date 
refers to the last day of the month. 
Store below 30 °C. Keep the nasal spray stored upright. Do not freeze. If Instanyl nasal spray is frozen 
the spray pump may crack. If uncertain of how the pump has been stored, you should check the spray 
pump before use. 
Instanyl that has passed the expiry date or is no longer required, may still contain enough medicine to 
be harmful to other people, especially children. 
This instrument is labelled in accordance with the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Directive (WEEE). Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household 
waste. Any used or unused nasal spray should be returned to the pharmacy or disposed 
according to other local requirements. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines you no 
longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment.

Re-priming the Instanyl nasal spray (after 7 days or more) 
If you have not used Instanyl for 7 days or more, the nasal spray must be

the display. 
3. The display will show a ‘P’ without the lock symbol, indicating that the 
device can be primed. 
4. Hold the nasal spray upright and pump the nasal spray once in the air. 
Warning: During this priming process some medicine will be expelled. 
Therefore:  
•  Priming must be performed in a well ventilated area.  
•  Do not point the nasal spray in the direction of yourself or other 
people. 
•  Do not point the nasal spray in the direction of surfaces and 
objects that could come into contact with other people, particularly 
children. 
5. Once primed, the display shows the number of doses left and the nasal 
spray is ready for use again. 
How to use Instanyl nasal spray

120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  Close one nostril by placing your finger against the side of your nose 
and insert the spray tip into the other nostril. 
8.  Press the pump down completely with two fingers one time while 
breathing through the nose. 
Note: You will hear a ‘click’ sound when the pump is pressed down 
completely and the nasal spray has delivered the dose. 
9.  The display counts down one number and the lock symbol is displayed 
shortly.  
10.  If after 10 minutes you need a second dose of Instanyl to relieve your 
pain, repeat step 1 to 8 in the other nostril. 
11.  Clean the nasal spray tip after each use with a clean tissue, and then 
discard the tissue afterwards. 
12.  Re-attach the child-resistant cap by placing it on the nasal spray tip and 
turning the cap clockwise. 
Remember to press and release the white button on the side before 
pumping the nasal spray. 
Remember to always put the child-resistant cap back on to the nasal 
spray and close it after use. 
Remember to keep the nasal spray in an upright position at all times. 
The nasal spray allows for up to two doses per breakthrough pain episodes. 
After the second dose, which may be taken 10 minutes after the first dose the 
nasal spray will be locked. The lock symbol appears in the display together 
with a countdown-clock symbol, which shows the remaining time left of the 
locking period before you can use the nasal spray again (each black mark 
equals 10 minutes). 
When the time has passed the lock symbol starts flashing. The nasal spray is 
now ready for use, when the next breakthrough pain episode occurs.  
You should wait for 4 hours before treating the next episode of breakthrough 
pain.  
You can use Instanyl to treat up to 4 episodes of breakthrough pain per day. 
If you experience more than 4 episodes of breakthrough pain per day, you 
should contact your doctor as your usual cancer pain treatment may have to 
be changed. 
When the nasal spray is empty the display will show ‘0’ and the lock symbol 
will appear. 
Disposal 
Do not throw away Instanyl nasal spray via wastewater or household waste. 
Any used or unused nasal spray should be returned to the pharmacy or 
disposed according to other local requirements. Ask your pharmacist for 
further guidance regarding disposal. 
Low Battery 
If the display shows a battery symbol, this means that the battery life is about 
to run out. The number of doses on the display will change to ‘5’. This is the 
approximate number of doses that can be delivered from the nasal spray, 
before the battery is too low and the display turns off.  
121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the battery symbol appears in the display, it is recommended that you 
contact your doctor or pharmacist to get a new nasal spray.  
Explanation of the symbols in the electronic display  
The nasal spray must be pumped 5 times (primed), before it can be used (see 
section ‘Preparing the Instanyl nasal spray’). The display counts downward 
after each pump (P5, P4, P3, P2 and P1). The nasal spray is ready, when the 
display shows the number of doses (i.e. 20, 30 or 40 doses). 
When priming, please refer to the above safety warning instructions (See 
section above “Priming steps”). 
The nasal spray has not been used for 7 days or more and must be primed 
again by pumping once in the air in a well-ventilated area before use (see 
below). 
The ‘P’ symbol will disappear from the display when the nasal spray is 
primed again. 
When re-priming, please refer to the above safety warning instructions (See 
section above “Re-priming steps”). 
LOCK symbol 
The nasal spray is locked and cannot be used. 
When the locking period is over, the lock symbol will start flashing. The lock 
symbol will disappear from the display when the white button on the side of 
the nasal spray is pressed; the nasal spray can now be used again when an 
episode of breakthrough pain occurs. 
COUNTDOWN-CLOCK symbol 
Shows how much time is left of the locking period. 
The countdown-clock is counting downwards. Each black mark equals 
10 minutes; the maximum locking period is 2 hours. It is recommended that 
you wait for 4 hours before treating the next episode of breakthrough pain. 
The COUNTDOWN-CLOCK symbol is displayed together with the 
LOCK-symbol. 
The number of doses left in the nasal spray is shown. After each dose, the 
number is counting downwards on the display. Depending on the nasal spray, 
the starting number can be 20, 30 or 40. 
BATTERY symbol 
The battery life is about to run out. The number of doses in the display 
changes to 5. This is the approximate number of doses that can be delivered 
from the nasal spray, before the battery is too low and the display turns off. 
The battery cannot be replaced and you will need to contact your doctor or 
pharmacist to get a new nasal spray. 
If you experience that the nasal spray does not work as described in the “Instructions for use” 
please contact your doctor or pharmacist.

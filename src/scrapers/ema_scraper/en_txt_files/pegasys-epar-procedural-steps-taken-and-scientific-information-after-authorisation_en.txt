A section on predictability of response is introduced in the 
information on the predictive value of on-treatment 
biomarkers for final treatment response based on the 
SmPC. A patient-level meta-analysis of 9 Pegasys clinical 
studies (n=1,423) in CHB HBeAg positive and HBeAg-

final report from a systematic review and individual 
patient data meta-analysis of PEG-IFN studies. A 
cross-reference is added to section 4.2 of the SmPC 
accordingly. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
negative patients demonstrated that HBsAg and HBV DNA 
levels at Week 12 of treatment, are predictive of final 
treatment outcome at Week 24 post-treatment in certain 
genotypes. Operating characteristics of these biomarkers 
are presented in Table 11. No single biomarker with a cut-
off can be identified to optimize all the operating 
characteristics (negative predictive value [NPV], sensitivity, 
specificity) and practical characteristics (simplicity, 
convenience). Consideration for early treatment 
discontinuation should be evaluated in the context of a 
particular clinical situation. 
For HBeAg-positive patients with HBV genotype B and C 
infection, HBsAg > 20,000 IU/mL or HBV DNA > 8 log10 
IU/mL at Week 12 following commencement of treatment is 
associated with high likelihood of failure to achieve HBeAg 
seroconversion and HBV-DNA <2,000 IU/mL at 24 week 
post-treatment (NPV > 90%). For HBV genotype A and D, 
subgroup size was insufficient to be analyzed.  
For HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype D 
infection, HBsAg > 20,000 IU/mL or HBV DNA > 6.5 log10 
IU/mL at Week 12 following commencement of treatment is 
associated with high likelihood of failure to achieve HBV-
DNA <2,000 IU/mL and ALT normalization at Week 24 post 
treatment. HBV genotype A subgroup size was insufficient 
to be analyzed. No biomarker can be identified with 
acceptable performance for HBeAg-negative patients with 
HBV genotype B or C infection.  
Other published on-treatment biomarkers that are 
predictive of the final outcome of Pegasys treatment may 
be considered.

and paternal exposure to ribavirin has been carried out. 
Only a limited number of cases are available. However, a 
large number of data would be necessary to draw a 
definitive conclusion on the teratogenic potential of 
ribavirin. The malformative risk is possible in human, but it 
is not confirmed. For paternal exposure, the malformative 
risk is unlikely in humans. Taking into account the number 
of reference cases outnumbering 300 after paternal 
exposure with no increase of congenital anomaly risk, it is 
recommended to remove the requirement of double 
contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male 
patient. For female patients, the CHMP agreed that they 
should be instructed to use an effective contraceptive. For 
male patients, the CHMP recommended that either male 
patients or their female partners of childbearing age must 
be advised to use an effective contraceptive.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
ribavirin in patients with genotype 2/3 treated for 24 weeks 
is considered sufficiently solid, as comparative studies have 
not clearly demonstrated any efficacy advantage of a 
higher dose, to outweigh a higher risk of exposure related 
adverse effects. No comparative data are presently 
available concerning the relative efficacy of an 800 mg flat 
dose and a higher, weight based regimen in patients 
treated for a shortened duration, the CHMP therefore 
considered that it is unclear what dose of ribavirin should 
be used if treatment is started in a patient where a 
shortened duration of therapy is planned in case of a Rapid 
Viral Response. This is reflected in the SPC.

cardiomyopathy, vasculitis, rhabdomyolysis and renal 
insufficiency, a cumulative search of the MAH database was 
performed. For bacterial, fungal and viral infections, the  
MAH compiled safety data from pivotal HCV and HBV trials 
to address the CHMP request. 
Based on this review, 313 viral events, 72 fungal events, 
and 242 bacterial events were identified. Regarding 
cerebral ischemia, 92 cases were identified. There were 29 
Pegasys related cases of retinal detachment and Vogt-
Koyanagi-Harada disease. A review carried out by the MAH 
identified that only the serous type of retinal detachment 
may be associated with the use of alpha interferons in HCV 
patients. As such serous retinal detachment has been 
included in the SPC.  Regarding cardiomyopathy and 
vasculitis, 30 cases and 36 cases were identified 
respectively.

treatment may be an alternative option for this subgroup. 
However 16 weeks of treatment may be associated with a 
lower chance of treatment response and is associated with 
a higher risk of relapse than treatment for 24 weeks. The 
overall long-term clinical impact associated with a 
shortening of the treatment duration from 24 to 16 weeks 
remains unknown. This has been reflected in the SPC.

Interferon and ribavarin containing products. In addition 
the warning that psychiatric disorders may also occur after 
termination of treatment was included in the Pegasys SPC 
to align with the Interferon-alfa-2b products and ribavarin. 
Due to differences in the indications of these products it 
was not possible to propose a class labelling "text" for all 
these products. Rather the existing paragraphs pertaining 
to psychiatric disorders in the SPCs and Package Leaflets 
have been moved to the beginning of the corresponding

The CHMP noted differences in the SPC's of Ribavarin and 
contraindication of Pegasys during pregnancy and 
lactation. Section 4.6 of the SPC will also be 
amended regarding the recommendations on 
pregnancy and lactation. This change follows the 
adoption of a class labelling by the CHMP on 26th 
January 2006 for the Interferons and Ribavirin for 
pregnancy and lactation. Corresponding revisions to 
the Package Leaflet are made. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
alfa-Interferon containing products regarding the 
contraindication to pregnancy and lactation, the 
recommendations on the duration of contraception and the 
recommendations on lactation. The CHMP agreed that in 
view of the available teratogenicity data for the alfa-
Interferons products it should be made clear that the strict 
contraindication of Pegasys during pregnancy and lactation 
is not justified. Therefore the CHMP agreed to the 
withdrawal of the contraindication to pregnancy and 
lactation for Pegasys. However it is noteworthy that 
pregnancy and lactation are not recommended with use of 
alfa-Interferons. Further, regarding lactation, the CHMP 
agreed that given the importance of the treatment to the 
mother, prescribers should not be given a choice between 
initiating  treatment or  breastfeeding.  Rather a warning 
Page 34/40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be included in Section 4.6 "Pregnancy and 
Lactation" that breast-feeding should be discontinued prior 
to treatment.  
The CHMP further agreed that given the teratogenic 
potential demonstrated for ribavirin in animal species the 
duration of recommended contraception following the 
termination of treatment should be based on the calculation 
of the elimination of Ribavarin that uses a maximal value of 
half life. Further, the CHMP maintained that separate 
recommendations should exist for female patients and male 
patients and their female partners. This is because the 
advantage of having consistent recommendations for all 
patients is outweighed by the fact that female patients 
would be advised to use contraception for 2 months more 
than necessary. Therefore the CHMP concluded that when 
Pegasys and other alfa-Interferons are used in combination 
with Ribavarin contraceptive measures should be used 
during treatment and for 4 months after treatment 
discontinuation in female patients and during treatment 
and for 7 months after treatment discontinuation in male 
patients and their female partners.

Labelling and 
extension of the therapeutic indication of all the 
PL 
formulations of Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) to include 
treatment in combination with ribavirin of adult patients 
with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and persistently normal 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels with consequential 
changes to Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC. 
In addition the SPC, labelling and PL were updated in

accordnace to the SPC guideline and the latest QRD 
template. 
It has been estimated that 30% of patients with CHC have 
persistently normal ALT (defined by detectable hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) RNA, HCV antibodies and at least three ALT 
values within the normal reference range over a 6 month 
period). There appears to be no major difference in terms 
of viral load or genotype (incl. quasispecies) as compared 
to patients with CHC and increased ALT. Predictive factors 
for persistently normal ALT in case of CHC include female 
sex, age >40 years, no alcohol use and low body mass 
index. The long-term prognosis is ill defined. 
Multiple factors, relating to both the virus and the 
individual, may influence the benefit/risk ratio of initiating 
treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C. These factors 
should be considered in the evaluation of each individual 
patient's suitability for treatment and normal ALT status per 
se should no longer be considered a barrier to treatment if 
other factors support this intervention. 
No additional information on clinical pharmacology was 
obtained during the clinical development programme 
presented in this application. 
The pivotal study designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy 
and safety of a pegylated IFN alfa plus ribavirin for the 
treatment of CHC in patients with persistently normal ALT 
activity was a multicentre (70), randomised, open label 
study (study NR16071) comparing 3 groups:

and 5.2 of the SPC. 
The MAH applied to remove the term "histologically proven" 
from the section 4.1 of the SPC referring to the French 
Consensus Conference on Hepatitis C where it is stated that 
biopsy may not be necessary if a decision to treat has been 
made on other grounds and the primary objective is viral 
eradication.  This is also largely in line with other National 
Guidelines.  The viral eradication rate is sufficiently high for 
patients with genotype 2/3 that treatment is indicated in 
many cases even if the histology turns out to be benign.  
Therefore histology is not always needed.  
The CPMP agreed that the term "histologically proven" 
should be removed from section 4.1 but requested that a 
warning be added to section 4.4: "All patients in the 
chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before 
Page 38/40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inclusion, but in certain cases (ie patients with genotype 2 
or 3), treatment may be possible without histological 
confirmation.  Current treatment guidelines should be 
consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to 
commencing treatment."  
The main focus of the variation was the results of study 
NV15942, a randomised, double blind trial comparing 24 
and 48 weeks of therapy and two dosages of ribavirin in 
combination with Pegasys (Peg-IFN) in patients with 
chronic hepatitis C.  As a result of the study, the MAH 
proposed changes to section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SPC.

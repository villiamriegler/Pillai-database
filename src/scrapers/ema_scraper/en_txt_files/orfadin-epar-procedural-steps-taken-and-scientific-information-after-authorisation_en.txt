SmPC and PL 
New information on in vivo and in vitro interactions were 
on interaction with medicinal products with a narrow 
therapeutic window metabolized through CYP2C9 and 
information based on  in vitro and in vivo drug drug 
interaction studies investigating effects of nitisinone 
on cytochromes CYP2C9,CYP2D6, CYP2E1, OAT1, 
OAT3, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5, P-gp, 
BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT2-mediated 
transport. This update is following PRAC conclusions 
on PSUSA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002169/201802) 
adopted on 6 September 2018. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
added to the Product Information. This included a warning 
that nitisinone, as a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, may 
result in increased plasma concentrations of co-
administered medicinal products metabolized primarily via 
CYP2C9. Nitisinone treated patients who are concomitantly 
treated with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic 
window metabolized through CYP2C9, such as warfarin and 
phenytoin,  should be monitored for toxicity of the co-
administered medicinal products.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II, Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Orfadin continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
Orfadin remains the only therapeutic treatment so far 
available for the treatment of the rare disease tyrosinemia 
type 1 and the risk/benefit of Orfadin in the treatment of 
the approved indication continues to be favourable. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the renewal could be 
granted with unlimited validity.

opinion that the follow-up visits should take place at 
shorter intervals. Therefore, the CHMP requested to the 
MAH to include a warning in section 4.4 of the SPC 
recommending monitoring visits every 6 months or shorter 
intervals in case of AEs. The MAH submitted this type II 
variation to update the SPC as requested by the CHMP.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Tasmar is indicated in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in 
patients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to 
respond to or are intolerant of other catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (see section 5.1). 
Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute liver injury, Tasmar should not be considered as a first-
line adjunct therapy to levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
Since Tasmar should be used only in combination with levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa, 
the prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is also applicable to their concomitant use 
with Tasmar. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Paediatric population 
Tasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety 
or efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) 
Tasmar is contraindicated for patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. 
Renal impairment (see section 5.2) 
No dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min or greater). Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <30 ml/min) should be treated with caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone 
in these populations is available (see section 5.2)

Method of administration 
The administration of Tasmar is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced 
in the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Tasmar is administered orally three times daily. 
Tasmar may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
Tasmar tablets are film-coated and should be swallowed whole because tolcapone has a bitter taste. 
Tasmar can be combined with all pharmaceutical formulations of levodopa/benserazide and 
levodopa/carbidopa (see also section 4.5). 
The first dose of the day of Tasmar should be taken together the first dose of the day of a levodopa 
preparation, and the subsequent doses should be given approximately 6 and 12 hours later. Tasmar 
may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
The recommended dose of Tasmar is 100 mg three times daily, always as an adjunct to 
levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Only in exceptional circumstances, when the 
anticipated incremental clinical benefit justifies the increased risk of hepatic reactions, should the dose 
be increased to 200 mg three times daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If substantial clinical benefits are 
not seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment (regardless of dose) Tasmar should be 
discontinued. 
The maximum therapeutic dose of 200 mg three times daily should not be exceeded, as there is no 
evidence of additional efficacy at higher doses. 
Liver function should be checked before starting treatment with Tasmar and then monitored every 2 
weeks for the first year of therapy, every 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. 
If the dose is increased to 200 mg tid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the 
dose and then be reinitiated following the same sequence of frequencies as above (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). 
Tasmar treatment should also be discontinued if ALT (alanine amino transferase) and/or AST 
(aspartate amino transferase) exceed the upper limit of normal or symptoms or signs suggest the onset 
of hepatic failure (see section 4.4). 
Levodopa adjustments during Tasmar treatment 
As Tasmar decreases the breakdown of levodopa in the body, side effects due to increased levodopa 
concentrations may occur when beginning Tasmar treatment. In clinical trials, more than 70 % of 
patients required a decrease in their daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa was >600 mg 
or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before beginning treatment. 
The average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 30 % in those patients requiring a levodopa 
dose reduction. When beginning Tasmar, all patients should be informed of the symptoms of excessive 
levodopa dose and what to do if it occurs. 
Levodopa adjustments when Tasmar is discontinued  
The following suggestions are based on pharmacological considerations and have not been evaluated 
in clinical trials. Levodopa dose should not be decreased when Tasmar therapy is being discontinued 
due to side effects related to too much levodopa. However, when Tasmar therapy is being 
discontinued for reasons other than too much levodopa, levodopa dose may have to be increased to 
levels equal to or greater than before initiation of Tasmar therapy, especially if the patient had large 
decreases in levodopa when starting Tasmar. In all cases, patients should be educated on the 
symptoms of levodopa under-dose and what to do if it occurs. Adjustments in levodopa are most likely 
to be required within 1-2 days of Tasmar discontinuation.

4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Tasmar therapy should only be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of advanced 
Parkinson’s disease, to ensure an appropriate risk-benefit assessment. Tasmar should not be prescribed 
until there has been a complete informative discussion of the risks with the patient. 
Tasmar should be discontinued if substantial clinical benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the 
initiation of the treatment regardless of dose. 
Liver injury 
Because of the risk of rare but potentially fatal acute liver injury, Tasmar is only indicated for use in 
patients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to 
respond to or are intolerant of other COMT inhibitors. Periodic monitoring of liver enzymes cannot 
reliably predict the occurrence of fulminant hepatitis. However, it is generally believed that early 
detection of medicine-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect 
medication enhances the likelihood for recovery. Liver injury has most often occurred between 1 
month and 6 months after starting treatment with Tasmar. Additionally late onset hepatitis after 
approximately 18 months of treatment has been reported rarely. 
It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver injury (see section 4.8).  
Before starting treatment: If liver function tests are abnormal or there are signs of impaired liver 
function, Tasmar should not be prescribed. If Tasmar is to be prescribed, the patient should be 
informed about the signs and symptoms which may indicate liver injury, and to contact the physician 
immediately.  
During treatment: Liver function should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first year of therapy, 
every 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. If the dose is increased to 200 mg 
tid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose and then be re-initiated 
following the sequence of frequencies as above. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if 
ALT and/or AST exceed the upper limit of normal or if symptoms or signs suggesting the onset of 
hepatic failure (persistent nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, right upper 
quadrant tenderness) develop. 
If treatment is discontinued: Patients who show evidence of acute liver injury while on Tasmar and are 
withdrawn from the medicinal product may be at increased risk for liver injury if Tasmar is re-
introduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment. 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) 
In Parkinson`s patients, NMS tends to occur when discontinuing or stopping dopaminergic-enhancing 
medications. Therefore, if symptoms occur after discontinuing Tasmar, physicians should consider 
increasing the patient’s levodopa dose (see section 4.2). 
Isolated cases consistent with NMS have been associated with Tasmar treatment. Symptoms have 
usually onset during Tasmar treatment or shortly after Tasmar has been discontinued. NMS is 
characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus and tremor), mental status changes (agitation, 
confusion, stupor and coma), elevated temperature, autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, 
tachycardia) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) which may be a consequence of 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
myolysis. A diagnosis of NMS should be considered even if not all the above findings are present. 
Under such a diagnosis Tasmar should be immediately discontinued and the patient should be 
followed up closely.  
Before starting treatment: To reduce the risk of NMS, Tasmar should not be prescribed for patients 
with severe dyskinesia or a previous history of NMS including rhabdomyolysis or hyperthermia (see 
section 4.3). Patients receiving multiple medications with effects on different central nervous system 
(CNS) pathways (e.g. antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticholinergics) may be at greater risk of 
developing NMS.  
Impulse control disorders 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and 
carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic 
treatments such as Tasmar in association with levodopa. Review of treatment is recommended if such 
symptoms develop. 
Dyskinesia, nausea and other levodopa-associated adverse reactions 
Patients may experience an increase in levodopa-associated adverse reactions. Reducing the dose of 
levodopa (see section 4.2) may often mitigate these adverse reactions. 
Diarrhoea 
In clinical trials, diarrhoea developed in 16 % and 18 % of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg tid and 
200 mg tid respectively, compared to 8 % of patients receiving placebo. Diarrhoea associated with 
Tasmar usually began 2 to 4 months after initiation of therapy. Diarrhoea led to withdrawal of 5% and 
6% of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg tid and 200 mg tid respectively, compared to 1 % of patients 
receiving placebo. 
Benserazide interaction 
Due to the interaction between high dose benserazide and tolcapone (resulting in increased levels of 
benserazide), the prescriber should, until more experience has been gained, be observant of dose-
related adverse reactions (see section 4.5). 
MAO inhibitors 
Tasmar should not be given in conjunction with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors 
(e.g. phenelzine and tranylcypromine). The combination of MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors is 
equivalent to non-selective MAO-inhibition, therefore they should not both be given concomitantly 
with Tasmar and levodopa preparations (see also section 4.5). Selective MAO-B inhibitors should not 
be used at higher than recommended doses (e.g. selegiline 10 mg/day) when co-administered with 
Tasmar.  
Warfarin 
Since clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, coagulation 
parameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. 
Special populations 
Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) should be treated with 
caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone in these populations is available (see section 
5.2). 
Tasmar contains lactose and sodium 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Tasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered 
levodopa. The consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic adverse 
reactions observed after treatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased 
dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep 
disorders, somnolence, hallucination. 
Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of 
sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very 
rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating 
machines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an 
episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines (see section 4.7). 
Furthermore a reduction of levodopa dose or termination of therapy may be considered.  
Catechols and other drugs metabolised by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
Tolcapone may influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolised by COMT. No effects were seen 
on the pharmacokinetics of the COMT substrate carbidopa. An interaction was observed with 
benserazide, which may lead to increased levels of benserazide and its active metabolite. The 
magnitude of the effect was dependent on the dose of benserazide. The plasma concentrations of 
benserazide observed after co-administration of tolcapone and benserazide-25 mg/levodopa were still 
within the range of values observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. On the other hand, after co-
administration of tolcapone and benserazide-50 mg/levodopa the benserazide plasma concentrations 
could be increased above the levels usually observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. The effect of 
tolcapone on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolised by COMT such as -methyldopa, 
dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline and isoprenaline have not been evaluated. The prescriber should 
be observant of adverse reactions caused by putative increased plasma levels of these drugs when 
combined with Tasmar. 
Effect of tolcapone on the metabolism of other drugs 
Due to its affinity for cytochrome CYP2C9 in vitro, tolcapone may interfere with drugs whose 
clearance is dependent on this metabolic pathway, such as tolbutamide and warfarin. In an interaction 
study, tolcapone did not change the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide. Therefore, clinically relevant 
interactions involving cytochrome CYP2C9 appear unlikely. 
Since clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, coagulation 
parameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. 
Drugs that increase catecholamines 
Since tolcapone interferes with the metabolism of catecholamines, interactions with other drugs 
affecting catecholamine levels are theoretically possible. 
When Tasmar was given together with levodopa/carbidopa and desipramine, there was no significant 
change in blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma concentrations of desipramine. Overall, the frequency 
of adverse reactions increased slightly. These adverse reactions were predictable based on the known 
adverse reactions to each of the three drugs individually. Therefore, caution should be exercised when 
potent noradrenaline uptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline, or venlafaxine are 
administered to Parkinson’s disease patients being treated with Tasmar and levodopa preparations.  
In clinical trials, patients receiving Tasmar/levodopa preparations reported a similar adverse reaction 
profile independent of whether or not they were also concomitantly administered selegiline (a MAO-B 
inhibitor).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of tolcapone in pregnant women. Therefore, Tasmar should 
be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
In animal studies, tolcapone was excreted into maternal milk. 
The safety of tolcapone in infants is unknown; therefore, women should not breast-feed during 
treatment with Tasmar. 
Fertility 
In rats and rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity was observed after tolcapone administration (see section 
5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects of Tasmar on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.  
There is no evidence from clinical studies that Tasmar adversely influences a patient’s ability to drive 
and use machines. However patients should be advised that their ability to drive and operate machines 
may be compromised due to their Parkinson’s disease symptoms.  
Tasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered 
levodopa. The consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side 
effects observed after treatment with COMT inhibitors. Patients being treated with Levodopa and 
presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or 
engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury 
or death (e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see 
also section 4.4)  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Tasmar, occurring more 
frequently than in placebo-treated patients are listed in the table below. However, Tasmar, as a COMT 
inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered levodopa. The consequent 
increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side effects observed after 
treatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased dyskinesia, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep disorders, somnolence, 
hallucination. 
The only adverse reaction commonly leading to discontinuation of Tasmar in clinical trials was 
diarrhoea (see section 4.4).

three times daily. Increases were approximately two times more likely in females. The increases 
usually appeared within 6 to 12 weeks of starting treatment, and were not associated with any clinical 
signs or symptoms. In about half the cases, transaminase levels returned spontaneously to baseline 
values whilst patients continued Tasmar treatment. For the remainder, when treatment was 
discontinued, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels. 
Hepatocellular injury 
Rare cases  of severe hepatocellular injury resulting in death have been reported during marketed use 
(see section 4.4).  
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex 
Isolated cases of patients with symptoms suggestive of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom 
Complex (see section 4.4) have been reported following reduction or discontinuation of Tasmar and 
following introduction of Tasmar when this was accompanied by a significant reduction in other 
concomitant dopaminergic medications. In addition, rhabdomyolysis, secondary to NMS or severe 
dyskinesia, has been observed.  
Urine discolouration 
Tolcapone and its metabolites are yellow and can cause a harmless intensification in the colour of the 
patient’s urine. 
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic 
treatments such as Tasmar in association with Levodopa (see section 4.4 `special warnings and 
precautions for use´). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V*. 
4.9 
Overdose 
Isolated cases of either accidental or intentional overdose with tolcapone tablets have been reported. 
However clinical circumstances of these cases were so diverse, that no general conclusions can be 
drawn from the cases. 
The highest dose of tolcapone administered to humans was 800 mg three times daily, with and without 
levodopa coadministration, in a one week study in healthy elderly volunteers. The peak plasma 
concentrations of tolcapone at this dose were on average 30 µg/ml (compared to 3 and 6 µg/ml with 
100 mg tid and 200 mg tid of tolcapone respectively). Nausea, vomiting and dizziness were observed, 
particularly in combination with levodopa. 
Management of overdose 
Hospitalisation is advised. General supportive care is indicated. Based on the physicochemical 
properties of the compound, hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: NO4BX01  
Mechanism of action 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tolcapone is an orally active, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
inhibitor. Administered concomitantly with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase 
inhibitor (AADC-I), it leads to more stable plasma levels of levodopa by reducing metabolism of 
levodopa to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD). 
High levels of plasma 3-OMD have been associated with poor response to levodopa in Parkinson’s 
disease patients. Tolcapone markedly reduces the formation of 3-OMD. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that tolcapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte COMT 
activity after oral administration. The inhibition is closely related to plasma tolcapone concentration. 
With 200 mg tolcapone, maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is, on average, greater 
than 80 %. During dosing with Tasmar 200 mg three times daily, erythrocyte COMT inhibition at 
trough is 30 % to 45 %, with no development of tolerance.  
Transient elevation above pretreatment levels of erythrocyte COMT activity was observed after 
withdrawal of tolcapone. However, a study in Parkinson’s patients confirmed that after treatment 
discontinuation there was no significant change in levodopa pharmacokinetics or in patient response to 
levodopa compared to pretreatment levels. 
When Tasmar is administered together with levodopa, it increases the relative bioavailability (AUC) 
of levodopa approximately twofold. This is due to a decrease in clearance in L-dopa resulting in a 
prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of levodopa. In general, the average peak 
levodopa plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time of its occurrence (tmax) were unaffected. The onset 
of effect occurs after the first administration. Studies in healthy volunteers and parkinsonian patients 
have confirmed that the maximum effect occurs with 100 – 200 mg tolcapone. Plasma levels of 3-
OMD were markedly and dose-dependently decreased by tolcapone when given with 
levodopa/AADC-I (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase - inhibitor) (benserazide or carbidopa). 
Tolcapone’s effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics is similar with all pharmaceutical formulations of 
levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa; it is independent of levodopa dose, levodopa/AADC-I 
(benserazide or carbidopa) ratio and the use of sustained-release formulations. 
Clinical Efficacy and Safety 
Double blind placebo controlled clinical studies have shown a significant reduction of approximately 
20 % to 30 % in OFF time and a similar increase in ON time, accompanied by reduced severity of 
symptoms in fluctuating patients receiving Tasmar. Investigator’s global assessments of efficacy also 
showed significant improvement. 
A double-blind trial compared Tasmar with entacapone in Parkinson's disease patients who had at least 
three hours of OFF time per day while receiving optimised levodopa therapy. The primary outcome 
was the proportion of patients with a 1 or more hour increase in ON time (see Table 1).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In the therapeutic range, tolcapone pharmacokinetics are linear and independent of levodopa/AADC-I 
(benserazide or carbidopa) coadministration. 
Absorption 
Tolcapone is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of an 
oral administration is around 65 %. Tolcapone does not accumulate with three times daily dosing of 
100 or 200 mg. At these doses, Cmax is approximately 3 and 6 µg/ml, respectively. Food delays and 
decreases the absorption of tolcapone, but the relative bioavailability of a dose of tolcapone taken with 
a meal is still 80 % to 90 %. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vss) of tolcapone is small (9 l). Tolcapone does not distribute widely into 
tissues due to its high plasma protein binding (>99.9 %). In vitro experiments have shown that 
tolcapone binds mainly to serum albumin. 
Biotransformation/Elimination 
Tolcapone is almost completely metabolised prior to excretion, with only a very small amount (0.5 % 
of dose) found unchanged in urine. The main metabolic pathway of tolcapone is conjugation to its 
inactive glucuronide. In addition, the compound is methylated by COMT to 3-O-methyl-tolcapone and 
metabolised by cytochromes P450 3A4 and P450 2A6 to a primary alcohol (hydroxylation of the 
methyl group), which is subsequently oxidised to the carboxylic acid. The reduction to a putative 
amine, as well as the subsequent N-acetylation, occurs to a minor extent. After oral administration, 
60 % of drug-related material is excreted into urine and 40 % into faeces. 
Tolcapone is a low-extraction-ratio drug (extraction ratio = 0.15), with a moderate systemic clearance 
of about 7 L/h. The t1/2 of tolcapone is approximately 2 hours. 
Hepatic impairment 
Because of the risk of liver injury observed during post-marketing use, Tasmar is contraindicated in 
patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. A study in patients with hepatic impairment has 
shown that moderate non-cirrhotic liver disease had no impact on the pharmacokinetics of tolcapone. 
However, in patients with moderate cirrhotic liver disease, clearance of unbound tolcapone was 
reduced by almost 50 %. This reduction may increase the average concentration of unbound drug two-
fold. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of tolcapone have not been investigated in patients with renal impairment. 
However, the relationship of renal function and tolcapone pharmacokinetics has been investigated 
using population pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. The data of more than 400 patients have 
confirmed that over a wide range of creatinine clearance values (30-130 mL/min) the 
pharmacokinetics of tolcapone are unaffected by renal function. This could be explained by the fact 
that only a negligible amount of unchanged tolcapone is excreted in the urine, and the main 
metabolite, tolcapone-glucuronide, is excreted both in urine and in bile (faeces). 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.  
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis 
3 % and 5 % of rats in the mid- and high- dose groups, respectively, of the 24-month carcinogenicity 
study were shown to have renal epithelial tumours (adenomas or carcinomas). However, no evidence 
of renal toxicity was observed in the low-dose group. An increased incidence of uterine 
adenocarcinomas was seen in the high-dose group of the rat carcinogenicity study. There were no 
similar renal findings in the mouse or dogs carcinogenicity studies.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mutagenesis 
Tolcapone was shown not to be genotoxic in a complete series of mutagenicity studies. 
Toxicity to reproduction 
Tolcapone, when administered alone, was shown to be neither teratogenic nor to have any relevant 
effects on fertility.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Tasmar is indicated in combination with levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa for use in 
patients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to 
respond to or are intolerant of other catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (see section 5.1). 
Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute liver injury, Tasmar should not be considered as a first-
line adjunct therapy to levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
Since Tasmar should be used only in combination with levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa, 
the prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is also applicable to their concomitant use 
with Tasmar. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Paediatric population 
Tasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety 
or efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for elderly patients. 
Hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) 
Tasmar is contraindicated for patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. 
Renal impairment (see section 5.2) 
No dose adjustment of Tasmar is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance of 30 ml/min or greater). Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <30 ml/min) should be treated with caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone 
in these populations is available (see section 5.2) 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
The administration of Tasmar is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced 
in the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. 
Tasmar is administered orally three times daily. 
Tasmar may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
Tasmar tablets are film-coated and should be swallowed whole because tolcapone has a bitter taste. 
Tasmar can be combined with all pharmaceutical formulations of levodopa/benserazide and 
levodopa/carbidopa (see also section 4.5). 
The first dose of the day of Tasmar should be taken together the first dose of the day of a levodopa 
preparation, and the subsequent doses should be given approximately 6 and 12 hours later. Tasmar 
may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
The recommended dose of Tasmar is 100 mg three times daily, always as an adjunct to 
levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Only in exceptional circumstances, when the 
anticipated incremental clinical benefit justifies the increased risk of hepatic reactions, should the dose 
be increased to 200 mg three times daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If substantial clinical benefits are 
not seen within 3 weeks of the initiation of the treatment (regardless of dose) Tasmar should be 
discontinued. 
The maximum therapeutic dose of 200 mg three times daily should not be exceeded, as there is no 
evidence of additional efficacy at higher doses. 
Liver function should be checked before starting treatment with Tasmar and then monitored every 2 
weeks for the first year of therapy, every 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. 
If the dose is increased to 200 mg tid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the 
dose and then be reinitiated following the same sequence of frequencies as above (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). 
Tasmar treatment should also be discontinued if ALT (alanine amino transferase) and/or AST 
(aspartate amino transferase) exceed the upper limit of normal or symptoms or signs suggest the onset 
of hepatic failure (see section 4.4). 
Levodopa adjustments during Tasmar treatment 
As Tasmar decreases the breakdown of levodopa in the body, side effects due to increased levodopa 
concentrations may occur when beginning Tasmar treatment. In clinical trials, more than 70 % of 
patients required a decrease in their daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa was >600 mg 
or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before beginning treatment. 
The average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 30 % in those patients requiring a levodopa 
dose reduction. When beginning Tasmar, all patients should be informed of the symptoms of excessive 
levodopa dose and what to do if it occurs. 
Levodopa adjustments when Tasmar is discontinued  
The following suggestions are based on pharmacological considerations and have not been evaluated 
in clinical trials. Levodopa dose should not be decreased when Tasmar therapy is being discontinued 
due to side effects related to too much levodopa. However, when Tasmar therapy is being 
discontinued for reasons other than too much levodopa, levodopa dose may have to be increased to 
levels equal to or greater than before initiation of Tasmar therapy, especially if the patient had large 
decreases in levodopa when starting Tasmar. In all cases, patients should be educated on the 
symptoms of levodopa under-dose and what to do if it occurs. Adjustments in levodopa are most likely 
to be required within 1-2 days of Tasmar discontinuation.

4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Tasmar therapy should only be initiated by physicians experienced in the management of advanced 
Parkinson’s disease, to ensure an appropriate risk-benefit assessment. Tasmar should not be prescribed 
until there has been a complete informative discussion of the risks with the patient. 
Tasmar should be discontinued if substantial clinical benefits are not seen within 3 weeks of the 
initiation of the treatment regardless of dose. 
Liver injury 
Because of the risk of rare but potentially fatal acute liver injury, Tasmar is only indicated for use in 
patients with levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, who failed to 
respond to or are intolerant of other COMT inhibitors. Periodic monitoring of liver enzymes cannot 
reliably predict the occurrence of fulminant hepatitis. However, it is generally believed that early 
detection of medicine-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect 
medication enhances the likelihood for recovery. Liver injury has most often occurred between 1 
month and 6 months after starting treatment with Tasmar. Additionally late onset hepatitis after 
approximately 18 months of treatment has been reported rarely. 
It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver injury (see section 4.8). 
Before starting treatment: If liver function tests are abnormal or there are signs of impaired liver 
function, Tasmar should not be prescribed. If Tasmar is to be prescribed, the patient should be 
informed about the signs and symptoms which may indicate liver injury, and to contact the physician 
immediately.  
During treatment: Liver function should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first year of therapy, 
every 4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks thereafter. If the dose is increased to 200 mg 
tid, liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose and then be re-initiated 
following the sequence of frequencies as above. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if 
ALT and/or AST exceed the upper limit of normal or if symptoms or signs suggesting the onset of 
hepatic failure (persistent nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, right upper 
quadrant tenderness) develop. 
If treatment is discontinued: Patients who show evidence of acute liver injury while on Tasmar and are 
withdrawn from the medicinal product may be at increased risk for liver injury if Tasmar is re-
introduced. Accordingly, such patients should not be considered for re-treatment. 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) 
In Parkinson`s patients, NMS tends to occur when discontinuing or stopping dopaminergic-enhancing 
medications. Therefore, if symptoms occur after discontinuing Tasmar, physicians should consider 
increasing the patient’s levodopa dose (see section 4.2). 
Isolated cases consistent with NMS have been associated with Tasmar treatment. Symptoms have 
usually onset during Tasmar treatment or shortly after Tasmar has been discontinued. NMS is 
characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus and tremor), mental status changes (agitation, 
confusion, stupor and coma), elevated temperature, autonomic dysfunction (labile blood pressure, 
tachycardia) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) which may be a consequence of 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
myolysis. A diagnosis of NMS should be considered even if not all the above findings are present. 
Under such a diagnosis Tasmar should be immediately discontinued and the patient should be 
followed up closely.  
Before starting treatment: To reduce the risk of NMS, Tasmar should not be prescribed for patients 
with severe dyskinesia or a previous history of NMS including rhabdomyolysis or hyperthermia (see 
section 4.3). Patients receiving multiple medications with effects on different central nervous system 
(CNS) pathways (e.g. antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticholinergics) may be at greater risk of 
developing NMS.  
Impulse control disorders 
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. Patients and 
carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic 
treatments such as Tasmar in association with levodopa. Review of treatment is recommended if such 
symptoms develop. 
Dyskinesia, nausea and other levodopa-associated adverse reactions 
Patients may experience an increase in levodopa-associated adverse reactions. Reducing the dose of 
levodopa (see section 4.2) may often mitigate these adverse reactions. 
Diarrhoea 
In clinical trials, diarrhoea developed in 16 % and 18 % of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg tid and 
200 mg tid respectively, compared to 8 % of patients receiving placebo. Diarrhoea associated with 
Tasmar usually began 2 to 4 months after initiation of therapy. Diarrhoea led to withdrawal of 5% and 
6% of patients receiving Tasmar 100 mg tid and 200 mg tid respectively, compared to 1 % of patients 
receiving placebo. 
Benserazide interaction 
Due to the interaction between high dose benserazide and tolcapone (resulting in increased levels of 
benserazide), the prescriber should, until more experience has been gained, be observant of dose-
related adverse reactions (see section 4.5). 
MAO inhibitors 
Tasmar should not be given in conjunction with non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors 
(e.g. phenelzine and tranylcypromine). The combination of MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors is 
equivalent to non-selective MAO-inhibition, therefore they should not both be given concomitantly 
with Tasmar and levodopa preparations (see also section 4.5). Selective MAO-B inhibitors should not 
be used at higher than recommended doses (e.g. selegiline 10 mg/day) when co-administered with 
Tasmar.  
Warfarin 
Since clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, coagulation 
parameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. 
Special populations 
Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) should be treated with 
caution. No information on the tolerability of tolcapone in these populations is available (see section 
5.2). 
Tasmar contains lactose and sodium 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-
galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Tasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered 
levodopa. The consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic adverse 
reactions observed after treatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased 
dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep 
disorders, somnolence, hallucination. 
Levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset. Sudden onset of 
sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported very 
rarely. Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating 
machines during treatment with levodopa. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an 
episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines (see section 4.7). 
Furthermore a reduction of levodopa dose or termination of therapy may be considered.  
Catechols and other drugs metabolised by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
Tolcapone may influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolised by COMT. No effects were seen 
on the pharmacokinetics of the COMT substrate carbidopa. An interaction was observed with 
benserazide, which may lead to increased levels of benserazide and its active metabolite. The 
magnitude of the effect was dependent on the dose of benserazide. The plasma concentrations of 
benserazide observed after co-administration of tolcapone and benserazide-25 mg/levodopa were still 
within the range of values observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. On the other hand, after co-
administration of tolcapone and benserazide-50 mg/levodopa the benserazide plasma concentrations 
could be increased above the levels usually observed with levodopa/benserazide alone. The effect of 
tolcapone on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolised by COMT such as -methyldopa, 
dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline and isoprenaline have not been evaluated. The prescriber should 
be observant of adverse reactions caused by putative increased plasma levels of these drugs when 
combined with Tasmar. 
Effect of tolcapone on the metabolism of other drugs 
Due to its affinity for cytochrome CYP2C9 in vitro, tolcapone may interfere with drugs whose 
clearance is dependent on this metabolic pathway, such as tolbutamide and warfarin. In an interaction 
study, tolcapone did not change the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide. Therefore, clinically relevant 
interactions involving cytochrome CYP2C9 appear unlikely. 
Since clinical information is limited regarding the combination of warfarin and tolcapone, coagulation 
parameters should be monitored when these drugs are co-administered. 
Drugs that increase catecholamines 
Since tolcapone interferes with the metabolism of catecholamines, interactions with other drugs 
affecting catecholamine levels are theoretically possible. 
When Tasmar was given together with levodopa/carbidopa and desipramine, there was no significant 
change in blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma concentrations of desipramine. Overall, the frequency 
of adverse reactions increased slightly. These adverse reactions were predictable based on the known 
adverse reactions to each of the three drugs individually. Therefore, caution should be exercised when 
potent noradrenaline uptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline, or venlafaxine are 
administered to Parkinson’s disease patients being treated with Tasmar and levodopa preparations. 
In clinical trials, patients receiving Tasmar/levodopa preparations reported a similar adverse reaction 
profile independent of whether or not they were also concomitantly administered selegiline (a MAO-B 
inhibitor).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of tolcapone in pregnant women. Therefore, Tasmar should 
be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
In animal studies, tolcapone was excreted into maternal milk. 
The safety of tolcapone in infants is unknown; therefore, women should not breast-feed during 
treatment with Tasmar. 
Fertility 
In rats and rabbits, embryo-foetal toxicity was observed after tolcapone administration (see section 
5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects of Tasmar on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
There is no evidence from clinical studies that Tasmar adversely influences a patient’s ability to drive 
and use machines. However patients should be advised that their ability to drive and operate machines 
may be compromised due to their Parkinson’s disease symptoms.  
Tasmar, as a COMT inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered 
levodopa. The consequent increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side 
effects observed after treatment with COMT inhibitors. Patients being treated with Levodopa and 
presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or 
engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury 
or death (e.g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see 
also section 4.4)  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Tasmar, occurring more 
frequently than in placebo-treated patients are listed in the table below. However, Tasmar, as a COMT 
inhibitor, is known to increase the bioavailability of the co-administered levodopa. The consequent 
increase in dopaminergic stimulation can lead to the dopaminergic side effects observed after 
treatment with COMT inhibitors. The most common of these are increased dyskinesia, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, syncope, orthostatic complains, constipation, sleep disorders, somnolence, 
hallucination. 
The only adverse reaction commonly leading to discontinuation of Tasmar in clinical trials was 
diarrhoea (see section 4.4).

Increase of alanine aminotransferase

three times daily. Increases were approximately two times more likely in females. The increases 
usually appeared within 6 to 12 weeks of starting treatment, and were not associated with any clinical 
signs or symptoms. In about half the cases, transaminase levels returned spontaneously to baseline 
values whilst patients continued Tasmar treatment. For the remainder, when treatment was 
discontinued, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels. 
Hepatocellular injury 
Rare cases  of severe hepatocellular injury resulting in death have been reported during marketed use 
(see section 4.4).  
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom Complex 
Isolated cases of patients with symptoms suggestive of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Symptom 
Complex (see section 4.4) have been reported following reduction or discontinuation of Tasmar and 
following introduction of Tasmar when this was accompanied by a significant reduction in other 
concomitant dopaminergic medications. In addition, rhabdomyolysis, secondary to NMS or severe 
dyskinesia, has been observed.  
Urine discolouration 
Tolcapone and its metabolites are yellow and can cause a harmless intensification in the colour of the 
patient’s urine. 
Impulse control disorders 
Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive spending or buying, binge eating 
and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic 
treatments such as Tasmar in association with Levodopa (see section 4.4 `special warnings and 
precautions for use´). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V*. 
4.9 
Overdose 
Isolated cases of either accidental or intentional overdose with tolcapone tablets have been reported. 
However clinical circumstances of these cases were so diverse, that no general conclusions can be 
drawn from the cases. 
The highest dose of tolcapone administered to humans was 800 mg three times daily, with and without 
levodopa coadministration, in a one week study in healthy elderly volunteers. The peak plasma 
concentrations of tolcapone at this dose were on average 30 µg/ml (compared to 3 and 6 µg/ml with 
100 mg tid and 200 mg tid of tolcapone respectively). Nausea, vomiting and dizziness were observed, 
particularly in combination with levodopa. 
Management of overdose 
Hospitalisation is advised. General supportive care is indicated. Based on the physicochemical 
properties of the compound, hemodialysis is unlikely to be of benefit.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: Anti-Parkinson drugs, other dopaminergic agents, ATC code: NO4BX01  
Mechanism of action 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tolcapone is an orally active, selective and reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
inhibitor. Administered concomitantly with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase 
inhibitor (AADC-I), it leads to more stable plasma levels of levodopa by reducing metabolism of 
levodopa to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD). 
High levels of plasma 3-OMD have been associated with poor response to levodopa in Parkinson’s 
disease patients. Tolcapone markedly reduces the formation of 3-OMD. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that tolcapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte COMT 
activity after oral administration. The inhibition is closely related to plasma tolcapone concentration. 
With 200 mg tolcapone, maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is, on average, greater 
than 80 %. During dosing with Tasmar 200 mg three times daily, erythrocyte COMT inhibition at 
trough is 30 % to 45 %, with no development of tolerance.  
Transient elevation above pretreatment levels of erythrocyte COMT activity was observed after 
withdrawal of tolcapone. However, a study in Parkinson’s patients confirmed that after treatment 
discontinuation there was no significant change in levodopa pharmacokinetics or in patient response to 
levodopa compared to pretreatment levels. 
When Tasmar is administered together with levodopa, it increases the relative bioavailability (AUC) 
of levodopa approximately twofold. This is due to a decrease in clearance in L-dopa resulting in a 
prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of levodopa. In general, the average peak 
levodopa plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time of its occurrence (tmax) were unaffected. The onset 
of effect occurs after the first administration. Studies in healthy volunteers and parkinsonian patients 
have confirmed that the maximum effect occurs with 100 – 200 mg tolcapone. Plasma levels of 3-
OMD were markedly and dose-dependently decreased by tolcapone when given with 
levodopa/AADC-I (aromatic amino acid decarboxylase - inhibitor) (benserazide or carbidopa). 
Tolcapone’s effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics is similar with all pharmaceutical formulations of 
levodopa/benserazide and levodopa/carbidopa; it is independent of levodopa dose, levodopa/AADC-I 
(benserazide or carbidopa) ratio and the use of sustained-release formulations. 
Clinical Efficacy and Safety 
Double blind placebo controlled clinical studies have shown a significant reduction of approximately 
20 % to 30 % in OFF time and a similar increase in ON time, accompanied by reduced severity of 
symptoms in fluctuating patients receiving Tasmar. Investigator’s global assessments of efficacy also 
showed significant improvement. 
A double-blind trial compared Tasmar with entacapone in Parkinson's disease patients who had at least 
three hours of OFF time per day while receiving optimised levodopa therapy. The primary outcome 
was the proportion of patients with a 1 or more hour increase in ON time (see Table 1).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In the therapeutic range, tolcapone pharmacokinetics are linear and independent of levodopa/AADC-I 
(benserazide or carbidopa) coadministration. 
Absorption 
Tolcapone is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of an 
oral administration is around 65 %. Tolcapone does not accumulate with three times daily dosing of 
100 or 200 mg. At these doses, Cmax is approximately 3 and 6 µg/ml, respectively. Food delays and 
decreases the absorption of tolcapone, but the relative bioavailability of a dose of tolcapone taken with 
a meal is still 80 % to 90 %. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vss) of tolcapone is small (9 l). Tolcapone does not distribute widely into 
tissues due to its high plasma protein binding (>99.9 %). In vitro experiments have shown that 
tolcapone binds mainly to serum albumin. 
Biotransformation/Elimination 
Tolcapone is almost completely metabolised prior to excretion, with only a very small amount (0.5 % 
of dose) found unchanged in urine. The main metabolic pathway of tolcapone is conjugation to its 
inactive glucuronide. In addition, the compound is methylated by COMT to 3-O-methyl-tolcapone and 
metabolised by cytochromes P450 3A4 and P450 2A6 to a primary alcohol (hydroxylation of the 
methyl group), which is subsequently oxidised to the carboxylic acid. The reduction to a putative 
amine, as well as the subsequent N-acetylation, occurs to a minor extent. After oral administration, 
60 % of drug-related material is excreted into urine and 40 % into faeces. 
Tolcapone is a low-extraction-ratio drug (extraction ratio = 0.15), with a moderate systemic clearance 
of about 7 L/h. The t1/2 of tolcapone is approximately 2 hours. 
Hepatic impairment 
Because of the risk of liver injury observed during post-marketing use, Tasmar is contraindicated in 
patients with liver disease or increased liver enzymes. A study in patients with hepatic impairment has 
shown that moderate non-cirrhotic liver disease had no impact on the pharmacokinetics of tolcapone. 
However, in patients with moderate cirrhotic liver disease, clearance of unbound tolcapone was 
reduced by almost 50 %. This reduction may increase the average concentration of unbound drug two-
fold. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of tolcapone have not been investigated in patients with renal impairment. 
However, the relationship of renal function and tolcapone pharmacokinetics has been investigated 
using population pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. The data of more than 400 patients have 
confirmed that over a wide range of creatinine clearance values (30-130 mL/min) the 
pharmacokinetics of tolcapone are unaffected by renal function. This could be explained by the fact 
that only a negligible amount of unchanged tolcapone is excreted in the urine, and the main 
metabolite, tolcapone-glucuronide, is excreted both in urine and in bile (faeces). 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.  
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis 
3 % and 5 % of rats in the mid- and high- dose groups, respectively, of the 24-month carcinogenicity 
study were shown to have renal epithelial tumours (adenomas or carcinomas). However, no evidence 
of renal toxicity was observed in the low-dose group. An increased incidence of uterine 
adenocarcinomas was seen in the high-dose group of the rat carcinogenicity study. There were no 
similar renal findings in the mouse or dogs carcinogenicity studies.  
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mutagenesis 
Tolcapone was shown not to be genotoxic in a complete series of mutagenicity studies. 
Toxicity to reproduction 
Tolcapone, when administered alone, was shown to be neither teratogenic nor to have any relevant 
effects on fertility.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tasmar is and what it is used for 
For the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, Tasmar is used together with the medicinal product levodopa 
(as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa). 
Tasmar is used when all other alternative medicines cannot stabilise your Parkinson’s disease.  
For the treatment of your Parkinson’s disease you already take levodopa. 
A natural protein (enzyme) in your body, the (COMT) Catechol-O-methyltransferase breaks down the 
levodopa. Tasmar blocks this enzyme and thus slows the breakdown of levodopa. This means when it 
is taken together with levodopa (as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa) you should have an 
improvement in the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Tasmar 
Do not take Tasmar: 
- 
- 
- 
if you have liver disease or increased liver enzymes 
if you have severe involuntary movement (dyskinesia) 
if you have a previous history of severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental 
confusion (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Symptom Complex) and/or if you have 
damage of skeletal muscle tissue (non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis) or fever (hyperthermia) 
if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance tolcapone or to any of the other 
ingredients of Tasmar 
if you have a special type of tumour in the adrenal medulla (Phaeochromocytoma) 
if you take a certain medication to treat depression and anxiety, called non-selective mono 
amino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors  
- 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasmar. 
You should not start taking Tasmar until your doctor 
- 
- 
- 
has described the risks of treatment with Tasmar 
has explained the measures necessary to minimise those risks 
has answered any questions you may have 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits 
of taking Tasmar during pregnancy. The effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You 
should not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Tasmar. 
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and 
can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments. 
You should only receive Tasmar if your Parkinson’s disease is not adequately controlled by the use of  
other therapies. 
In addition, your doctor will stop Tasmar treatment if after 3 weeks you do not improve enough to 
justify the risks of continuing treatment. 
Liver Injury 
Tasmar may cause rare but potentially fatal liver injury. Liver injury has occurred most often after 1 
month and before 6 months. It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver 
injury. Therefore, the following preventive measures have to be considered. 
Before beginning treatment:  
To reduce the risk of liver injury you should not use Tasmar if  
- 
you have a liver disease  
- 
in case of elevated liver function tests in the blood test done before starting treatment (tests 
of alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)).  
While receiving treatment: 
During treatment, blood tests will be done in the following time intervals: 
- 
- 
- 
The treatment will be stopped, if these blood tests become abnormal.  
every 2 weeks during the first 12 months of therapy, 
every 4 weeks during the following 6 months of therapy, 
every 8 weeks during further treatment. 
The treatment with Tasmar may sometimes lead to disturbances in the way the liver works. Therefore, 
you should contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, 
pain in your stomach (particularly over the liver in the right upper area), loss of appetite, weakness, 
fever, darkening of urine, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) or if you tire more easily. 
If you have been already treated with Tasmar and developed acute liver injury during treatment,  
Tasmar should not be re-introduced again. 
NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)  
Symptoms of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur during Tasmar treatment. 
The NMS consists of some or all of the following: 
- 
severe muscle stiffness, jerking movements of muscles, arms or legs, and soreness of muscles.  
Muscle injury can sometimes cause dark urine. 
other important symptoms are high fever and mental confusion. 
- 
Rarely, after abruptly reducing or stopping Tasmar or other antiparkinsonian drugs, you may 
experience severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental confusion. If this happens notify 
your doctor. 
The following preventive measures have to be considered. 
Before beginning treatment: 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To reduce the risk of NMS you should not use Tasmar if your doctor says you have severe involuntary 
movement (dyskinesia) or a previous illness that may have been NMS. 
Inform your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medications as the risk of NMS may be 
increased if you are taking some specific medications. 
While receiving treatment: 
If you develop any symptoms as described above, that you think may be NMS, you should report them 
to your doctor immediately.  
Do not stop Tasmar or any other Parkinson’s medications without telling your doctor as this may 
increase the risk of NMS. 
Inform your doctor also: 
- 
- 
- 
if you have any illnesses other than Parkinson’s disease 
if you are allergic to other medicines, food and dyes 
if soon after beginning and during treatment with Tasmar you have symptoms which may be 
caused by levodopa such as involuntary movement (dyskinesia) and nausea.

How to take Tasmar 
Always take Tasmar exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are unsure.  
Dose and frequency of administration 
Your doctor should always begin your treatment with the standard dose of 3 times daily 1 tablet 
(100 mg (1 tablet)).

discontinued. 
To improve efficacy your doctor should only increase the dose to 3 times daily 2 tablets (200 mg three 
times a day) if the increase in how your Parkinson’s disease symptoms are controlled outweighs the 
expected increase in side effects. The side effects at the higher dose can often be severe and affect 
your liver. If you do not get better at the higher dose after a total of 3 weeks, your doctor should stop 
your treatment with Tasmar.  
When beginning and during treatment with Tasmar, your dose of levodopa may need to be changed. 
Your doctor will advise you what to do. 
How to take the medication: 
Swallow Tasmar with 1 glass of water. 
Do not break or crush the tablets. 
The first tablet Tasmar is to be taken in the morning together with your other parkinsonian medicine 
‘levodopa’.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Tasmar is and what it is used for 
For the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, Tasmar is used together with the medicinal product levodopa 
(as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa). 
Tasmar is used when all other alternative medicines cannot stabilise your Parkinson’s disease.  
For the treatment of your Parkinson’s disease you already take levodopa. 
A natural protein (enzyme) in your body, the (COMT) Catechol-O-methyltransferase breaks down the 
levodopa. Tasmar blocks this enzyme and thus slows the breakdown of levodopa. This means when it 
is taken together with levodopa (as levodopa/benserazide or levodopa/carbidopa) you should have an 
improvement in the symptoms of your Parkinson’s disease.  
2.  What you need to know before you take Tasmar 
Do not take Tasmar: 
- 
- 
- 
if you have liver disease or increased liver enzymes 
if you have severe involuntary movement (dyskinesia) 
if you have a previous history of severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental 
confusion (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Symptom Complex) and/or if you have 
damage of skeletal muscle tissue (non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis) or fever (hyperthermia) 
if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance tolcapone or to any of the other 
ingredients of Tasmar 
if you have a special type of tumour in the adrenal medulla (Phaeochromocytoma) 
if you take a certain medication to treat depression and anxiety, called non-selective mono 
amino oxidase (MAO) inhibitors  
- 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Tasmar. 
You should not start taking Tasmar until your doctor 
- 
- 
- 
has described the risks of treatment with Tasmar 
has explained the measures necessary to minimise those risks 
has answered any questions you may have 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits 
of taking Tasmar during pregnancy. The effects of Tasmar have not been studied in infants. You 
should not breast-feed your infant during treatment with Tasmar. 
Tell your doctor if you or your family/carer notices you are developing urges or cravings to behave in 
ways that are unusual for you or you cannot resist the impulse, drive or temptation to carry out certain 
activities that could harm yourself or others. These behaviours are called impulse control disorders and 
can include addictive gambling, excessive eating or spending, an abnormally high sex drive or a 
preoccupation with an increase in sexual thoughts or feelings. Your doctor may need to review your 
treatments. 
You should only receive Tasmar if your Parkinson’s disease is not adequately controlled by the use of  
other therapies. 
In addition, your doctor will stop Tasmar treatment if after 3 weeks you do not improve enough to 
justify the risks of continuing treatment. 
Liver Injury 
Tasmar may cause rare but potentially fatal liver injury. Liver injury has occurred most often after 1 
month and before 6 months. It should also be noted that female patients may have a higher risk of liver 
injury. Therefore, the following preventive measures have to be considered. 
Before beginning treatment:  
To reduce the risk of liver injury you should not use Tasmar if  
- 
you have a liver disease  
- 
in case of elevated liver function tests in the blood test done before starting treatment (tests 
of alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST)).  
While receiving treatment: 
During treatment, blood tests will be done in the following time intervals: 
- 
- 
- 
The treatment will be stopped, if these blood tests become abnormal.  
every 2 weeks during the first 12 months of therapy, 
every 4 weeks during the following 6 months of therapy, 
every 8 weeks during further treatment. 
The treatment with Tasmar may sometimes lead to disturbances in the way the liver works. Therefore, 
you should contact your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, 
pain in your stomach (particularly over the liver in the right upper area), loss of appetite, weakness, 
fever, darkening of urine, jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) or if you tire more easily. 
If you have been already treated with Tasmar and developed acute liver injury during treatment,  
Tasmar should not be re-introduced again. 
NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome)  
Symptoms of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur during Tasmar treatment. 
The NMS consists of some or all of the following: 
- 
severe muscle stiffness, jerking movements of muscles, arms or legs, and soreness of muscles.  
Muscle injury can sometimes cause dark urine. 
other important symptoms are high fever and mental confusion. 
- 
Rarely, after abruptly reducing or stopping Tasmar or other antiparkinsonian drugs, you may 
experience severe symptoms of muscle stiffening, fever or mental confusion. If this happens notify 
your doctor. 
The following preventive measures have to be considered. 
Before beginning treatment: 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To reduce the risk of NMS you should not use Tasmar if your doctor says you have severe involuntary 
movement (dyskinesia) or a previous illness that may have been NMS. 
Inform your doctor about all prescription and non-prescription medications as the risk of NMS may be 
increased if you are taking some specific medications. 
While receiving treatment: 
If you develop any symptoms as described above, that you think may be NMS, you should report them 
to your doctor immediately.  
Do not stop Tasmar or any other Parkinson’s medications without telling your doctor as this may 
increase the risk of NMS. 
Inform your doctor also: 
- 
- 
- 
if you have any illnesses other than Parkinson’s disease 
if you are allergic to other medicines, food and dyes 
if soon after beginning and during treatment with Tasmar you have symptoms which may be 
caused by levodopa such as involuntary movement (dyskinesia) and nausea. 
If you feel unwell, you should contact your doctor because you may need to take less  levodopa. 
Children and adolescents 
Tasmar is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety 
or efficacy. There is no relevant indication for use in children and adolescents.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant The Medicines Company UK Ltd submitted on 4 December 2013 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kengrexal, through the centralised procedure under 
Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by 
the EMA/CHMP on 25 April 2013.  
The applicant applied for the following indication. 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
Kengrexal is a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events 
(including stent thrombosis) in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI). 
During the pre-operative period when oral P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery (‘Bridging’) 
Kengrexal is also indicated to maintain P2Y12 inhibition in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes or in 
patients with stents who are at increased risk for thrombotic events (such as stent thrombosis) when oral 
P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery (‘Bridging’). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
cangrelor was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0210/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0210/2013 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0210/2013.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)  with  stent  implantation  is  widely  used  to  decrease  death  or 
myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to reduce angina and improve 
quality of life in patients with stable angina [Bhatt et al, 2004; Mehta et al, 2005; Bavry et al, 2006; De Bruyne 
et  al,  2012].  Despite  advances  in  adjunctive  pharmacotherapy,  thrombotic  complications  such  as  stent 
thrombosis (ST) during and immediately after PCI remain a major concern [Desai and Bhatt, 2010].  
Arterial injury at the site of PCI exposes the thrombogenic subintimal layer to platelets, activates the coagulation 
system, and serves as a potent stimulus for thrombin formation. The reactivity of platelets to agonists plays a 
central  role  in  the  genesis  of  thrombosis  during  and  following  PCI.  PCI  and  stent  implantation  can  involve 
significant localised injury to the vascular endothelium [Thomas et al, 2009], even in stable patients [Babu et al, 
2011].  This  vascular  trauma  is  prothrombotic  and  inflammatory  and  can  result  in  ischaemic  complications 
including  ST  [Bonello  et  al,  2006].  Stent  thrombosis  occurring  after  PCI  is  an  infrequent  but  serious 
complication. The incidence of ST is known to be increased in patients undergoing PCI in the setting of an ACS 
and in those who discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy [Iakovou et al, 2005; Airoldi et al, 2007; Schulz et al 
2009; Urban et al, 2011]. 
Antiplatelet therapies, in particular the P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, reduce ischaemic events, including MI and ST 
[Wiviott et al, 2007; Wallentin et al, 2009; Yousuf and Bhatt, 2011]. To date, only oral P2Y12 inhibitors have 
been available. While older IV antiplatelet agents such as glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa inhibitors are able to reduce 
MI successfully, their use has not been associated with a lower risk of ST, but rather a later onset of ST [Assali 
et al, 2000; Rinaldi et al, 2008]. Additionally, their effect cannot be quickly reversed and they can cause an 
increase in bleeding complications [Bhatt and Topol, 2000].  
Oral platelet P2Y12 inhibitors have been shown to reduce ischaemic events including death in patients with ACS 
and in patients undergoing PCI in a series of adequate and well controlled trials [CAPRIE Steering Committee 
1996; Steinhubl et al, 2002; Fox et al, 2004; Wiviott et al, 2007; Wallentin et al, 2009].  
A meta-analysis of 42,198 patients from five randomised, placebo-controlled trials that compared new P2Y12 
antagonists (prasugrel, ticagrelor, cangrelor) with clopidogrel in PCI confirmed that new P2Y12 platelet inhibitors 
Assessment report

Page 11/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  ST  (by  40%,  p=0.001)  and  death  (by  15%,  p=0.008)  following  PCI 
[Bellemain-Appaix et al, 2010].  
Stent  thrombosis  is  a  device-induced,  arterial  thrombosis.  Stent  thrombosis  is  a  potentially  catastrophic 
complication of PCI [Holmes et al, 2010]. Stent thrombosis can present as ST-segment elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI) or cardiogenic shock, with case fatality reaching as high as 45% in some studies [Iakovou et 
al, 2005; Airoldi et al, 2007; Schulz et al, 2009; Urban et al, 2011]. These striking data are among the main 
reasons for recommendations to initiate and prolong without interruption dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) to 12 
months or even longer in those undergoing PCI with stents, especially after ACS [Farb and Boam, 2007; Levine 
et al, 2011]. 
Limitations of oral P2Y12 inhibitors in an acute PCI  setting include delayed onset of action, an unpredictable 
response, and poor reversibility.  
Available therapies include clopidogrel  and more potent oral agents such as prasugrel and ticagrelor are also 
subject to limitations [Bonello et al, 2011; Alexopoulos et al, 2012; Agrawal and Bhatt, 2013; Parodi et al, 2013; 
Steg et al, 2013]. 
To overcome some of these limitations, clopidogrel pretreatment (ie, treatment given in sufficient time before 
catheterisation to be effective) is often administered. The largest randomised clinical trial of pretreatment did 
not find a statistically significant benefit of pretreatment with 300 mg of clopidogrel [Steinhubl et al, 2002] and 
extrapolations regarding the 600 mg clopidogrel dose are assumptions made on the basis of PK and PD alone 
and have not been proven clinically [CURRENT OASIS-7 Investigators et al, 2010]. The PRAGUE-8 trial also 
showed no improvement between pre-treatment >6 hours before and on-table clopidogrel administration, but 
did  find  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding  [Widimsky  et  al,  2008].  Furthermore,  pre-treatment  can  either  delay 
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or increase unnecessarily the risk of bleeding in patients who in the 
end do not need revascularisation or who go  to  the  operating room  immediately after undergoing coronary 
angiography.  
Bridging. A treatment dilemma currently exists in patients receiving oral platelet P2Y12 inhibitors for coronary 
artery  disease  who  require  surgery.  Product  labelling  and  treatment  guidelines  for  all  oral  P2Y12  platelet 
inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) include  the  warning that premature discontinuation of oral 
P2Y12 platelet inhibitors confers a high risk for thrombotic cardiac events, such as ST, MI, and death.  
Complicating matters further, product labelling and treatment guidelines also  recommend discontinuation of 
these agents at least five to seven days prior to any surgery to avoid the high risk of surgical bleeding known to 
be associated with oral P2Y12 inhibitors when taken at the time of surgery. 
Continuing oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy during the perioperative period is associated with an increased incidence 
of major haemorrhagic complications by as much as 50% [Douketis et al, 2012].  A meta-analysis of three 
prospective randomised studies and 17 observational studies showed that recent exposure to clopidogrel before 
CABG is associated with increased risk of postoperative death (relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02–1.67), and 
re-operations for bleeding (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.37–2.58) [Biancari et al, 2012]. A systematic review of 37 
studies comparing postoperative outcomes in patients exposed to clopidogrel in the five days before surgery, vs 
those who were not exposed showed a higher incidence of reoperation for bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 2.62; 95% 
CI, 1.96-3.49), and all-cause mortality (OR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.13-1.69) [Au et al, 2012].  
Further increased bleeding risk has also been demonstrated with the more potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors. In the 
TRITON thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI)-38 trial, prasugrel was associated with a 4-fold increased 
relative risk (absolute difference, 10.2%; p< 0.001)  of CABG-related bleeding compared  with clopidogrel  in 
patients  with  ACS  [Wiviott  et  al,  2007].  While  PLATO  demonstrated  no  difference  between  ticagrelor  and 
clopidogrel major/fatal/life-threatening CABG-related bleeding with respect to time from last intake of study 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 12/113 
 
  
  
drug before surgery [Held et al, 2011], the data reported do demonstrate a 1.6 to 3- fold increased risk in CABG 
bleeding for those patients who continued oral P2Y12 in the 2 days prior to CABG surgery compared to those 
patients who waited the labeled 5 to 7 days. Accordingly, recommendations are to delay surgery for at least 
seven days and ideally longer after discontinuation of prasugrel [Van de Werf et al, 2008; Wijns et al, 2010; 
Ferraris et al, 2011; Hamm et al, 2011;  Hillis et al, 2011; Efient SmPC 2013]. 
There  are  currently  no  treatment  strategies  available  that  provide  consistent  and  effective  platelet  P2Y12 
inhibition that can be turned on when it is needed (such as in an acute PCI setting) and that can be turned off 
when it is not, thus avoiding increasing bleeding risk, which is particularly important in patients who require 
surgery.  
Cangrelor  is  a  novel,  intravenous  (IV),  direct-acting,  P2Y12  receptor  antagonist  that  blocks  adenosine 
diphosphate  (ADP)-induced  platelet  activation  and  aggregation.  Cangrelor  provides  fast-onset,  potent,  and 
consistent P2Y12 inhibition, with reversible binding and a half-life of 3 to 6 minutes. During its development, 
cangrelor  has  been  identified  as  FPL-69931MX,  ARL  69931MX,  and  AR-C69931MX  for  the  tetrasodium  salt, 
ARL-69931XX  for  the  free  acid,  and  ARL-69712XX  for  the  major  plasma  nucleoside  metabolite  (currently 
AR-C69712XX).  The  chemical  structure  is  similar  to  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP).  The  chemical  name  of 
cangrelor  is  tetrasodium  salt  of  N6-[2-(methylthio)ethyl]-2-[(3,3,3  trifluoropropyl)thio]-5´-adenylic  acid, 
monoanhydride with (dichloromethylene) bisphosphonic acid..

stent thrombosis) in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI). 
During the pre-operative period when oral P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery (‘Bridging’)  
Kengrexal is also indicated to maintain P2Y12 inhibition in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes or in 
patients with stents who are at increased risk for thrombotic events (such as stent thrombosis) when oral P2Y12 
therapy is interrupted due to surgery (‘Bridging’).  
Proposed Dosage Form, Route of Administration, and Dosing Regimen: 
Kengrexal 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for injection or infusion. Kengrexal is intended for 
intravenous (IV) use, only after reconstitution and dilution. 
The proposed posology is as follows: 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
The  recommended  dose  of  Kengrexal  for  patients  undergoing  PCI  is  a  30  µg/kg  intravenous  bolus  followed 
immediately  by  4  µg/kg/min  intravenous  infusion.  The  bolus  and  infusion  should  be  initiated  prior  to  the 
procedure and continued for at least 2 hours or for the duration of the procedure, whichever is longer. At the 
discretion of the physician, the infusion may be continued for a total duration of 4 hours. 
During the pre-operative period when oral P2Y12 therapy is interrupted (‘Bridging’)  
Kengrexal  should  be  administered  as  a  0.75  µg/kg/min  intravenous  infusion  as  soon  as  possible  after  the 
discontinuation of oral P2Y12 inhibition and continue the infusion during the bridging period. The infusion can be 
continued until one hour prior to the administration of anesthesia for surgery when it should be discontinued. 
Kengrexal at this dose has been studied in clinical trials for bridging periods up to 7 days.

The application is mainly based on the CHAMPION clinical studies, which comprises three phase III studies. Two 
of these studies (CHAMPION PCI and CHAMPION PLATFORM) have been prematurely terminated due to the low 
likelihood of reaching their primary endpoint. The only complete phase III study is CHAMPION-PHOENIX. To 
support the bridging indication, a phase 2 study "BRIDGE" is submitted. 
In this application, the point to Consider on the clinical investigation of new medicinal products for the treatment 
of  acute  coronary  syndrome  without  persistent  ST  segment  elevation  (CPWP/EWP/570/98)  is  applicable. 
Compliance with this guidance is discussed later.  
No  Scientific  advice  was  requested  from  the  EMA.  No  reference  is  made  to  any  scientific  advice  from  other

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for injection or infusion  containing 
cangrelor tetrasodium  equivalent to 50 mg cangrelor as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: mannitol, sorbitol and sodium hydroxide. 
The product is available in 10 ml single use Type I glass vials  closed with a Flurotec coated butyl rubber stopper 
and sealed with crimped aluminium seal. The product needs to be reconstituted in 5 ml WFI and further diluted 
in 500 ml 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose intravenous infusion bags. After reconstitution 1 ml concentrate 
contains 10 mg cangrelor. After dilution 1 ml of solution contains 200 micrograms cangrelor. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of cangrelor tetrasodium is 
dichloro(((((2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-2-(6-(2-(methylthio)ethylamino)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylthio)-purin
-9-yl)tetrahydrofuran-5-yl)methoxy)(hydroxy)phosphoryloxy) (hydroxy)phosphoryl)methylphosphonic acid, 
tetrasodium salt and it  has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 14/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The structure was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR, MS and HR-MS and FT-IR. 
Cangrelor tetrasodium is a lyophilised, amorphous, white to off-white powder. Cangrelor tetrasodium is 
hygroscopic, however, under normal handling conditions associated water levels remain below 10% (the active 
substance specification limits) and do not impact stability or physical properties of cangrelor tetrasodium. The 
substance is very soluble in water, practically insoluble in ethanol and acetone and insoluble in methanol.   
Cangrelor tetrasodium exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 4 chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. Polymorphism has not been discussed. Taking into account the 
finished product pharmaceutical form it was considered justified.   
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cangrelor tetrasodium is synthesised in seven main steps using commercially available well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
The choice of the two starting materials has been sufficiently justified on the basis of their impact on the final 
active substance stereochemistry and their impact on its impurities profile. Especially with regard to the latter 
sufficient information has been provided regarding the origin and fate of potential genotoxic impurities (GTIs) 
arising from the starting materials. They are adequately controlled in the stage 4 intermediate and in addition it 
has been shown that any potential GTIs are purged in the downstream process. 
Crude cangrelor tetrasodium is purified by column chromatography and lyophilised. The different steps of 
cangrelor tetrasodium manufacture are performed by two different sites, one for the synthesis and another one 
for the lyophilisation. 
Holding time for intermediates have been established. 
The stereochemistry of cangrelor is defined by the stereochemistry of the starting material, which is controlled 
by appropriate specification. Information has been presented to show that under the manufacturing conditions, 
epimerization during the process is highly unlikely. 
The fate of genotoxic impurities arising from raw material has been discussed and appropriate in-process 
controls were put in place. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 15/113 
 
  
  
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (FTIR, HPLC), sodium identification 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, IC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
specific rotation (Ph. Eur.)  heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), microbial limits test (Ph. Eur.), specific microorganisms ( 
Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur). 
Potential genotoxic impurities are adequately controlled in the stage 4 intermediate product ensuring that their 
levels in final active substance will not exceed the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of 1.5 μg/day.  
Therefore, there is no need to monitor genotoxic impurities in final active substance. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The stereochemistry of the active substance is defined by the starting materials and the manufacturing process 
for the synthesis of cangrelor does not give rise to any isomerization. Therefore, monitoring chiral impurities in 
final active substance is considered not necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data (three pilot scaled and 6 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 4 production scale batches and one pilot scale batch of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer were provided.  One batch was packaged in the intended commercial package. Other batches 
were packaged in less protective packaging. The batches were stored for 36 months under long term conditions 
at -20 ± 5 ˚C and for up to 6 months at 5 ± 3 ˚C according to the ICH guidelines.  
The following parameters were tested: physical description, pH, assay, water content, related substances. In 
addition, bacterial endotoxins was tested annually on two batches. Microbial enumeration test was conducted on 
three batches at 24 and 36 months.  The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. 
All data generated under long-term storage condition (-20 ± 5 °C) met the proposed specification requirements. 
Satisfactory data were obtained under elevated temperature conditions (2-8 °C) for all batches up to 6 months 
except for one batch, for which an out of specification result was observed at 6 months. These data support the 
short term excursion outside the proposed label storage conditions (-20 ± 5°C) during shipping or handling.

A photostability study was conducted as part of the assay and impurity method validation according to ICH QIB. 
The product was found to be photo sensitive and should be protected from light during storage. 
A freeze/thaw study for three cycles was performed on one batch and assay and related impurities were 
analysed for. No difference in results was observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a sterile formulation for injection or infusion. 
Cangrelor is highly soluble in water but degrades primarily by hydrolysis and lacks adequate solution stability. It 
was therefore developed as a lyophilized dosage form which requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for 
Injection and further dilution prior to administration.  
For finished product development, several dosage strengths, ranging from 10 mg to 300 mg of cangrelor per 
vial, were developed throughout clinical phase I and II. All the formulations were prepared in the same manner 
and contained the same qualitative composition as the proposed commercial formulation for Cangrelor for 
Injection. These formulations were used in different clinical studies. Only the 50 mg per vial dosage strength was 
further developed for all future Phase III Clinical Trials. 
Mannitol is used in the formulation as bulking agent to produce a firm, homogeneous cake. Sorbitol is included 
in the formulation to avoid formation of crystalline mannitol. Sorbitol also helps to stabilise the formulation and 
produce an isotonic solution after reconstitution. The amount of sorbitol required to minimise crystallisation of 
mannitol was determined by using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The formulation with 1:1:3 ratio of 
active substance, sorbitol and mannitol respectively was found to provide optimal characteristics with respect to 
lyophilised cake while demonstrating acceptable chemical stability. This formulation showed an acceptable 
tonicity 287-290 mOsM/kg. 
A pH of 8.0-9.5 was selected for the formulation to be close to the physiological range as well as to improve 
stability in aqueous solution. The bulk formulation pH is adjusted with 0.1N sodium hydroxide. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur.  standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
The manufacturing process development has been adequately explained and contained studies on the 
compatibility with manufacturing parts and filters, light stability, hold time studies and lyophilisation process 
settings.  Considering the active substance instability to heat the choice of the sterilisation method is considered 
justified. 
A 4 % overfill was use to compensate for the displacement volume created by the solid content of the 
formulation upon reconstitution.  
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 17/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
All formulations used during clinical development were prepared in the same manner and contained the same 
qualitative composition as the proposed commercial formulation for Cangrelor for Injection.  
The stability results of the reconstituted and diluted product have been provided and show in-use stability up to 
24 hrs at room temperature. However the following statement is included in the SmPC “After opening the vial 
the powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to dilution and use. Do not refrigerate. From a 
microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution/dilution precludes the risk of microbiological 
contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and 
conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user.” 
Compatibility with 103 intravenous medicines has been tested and 15 were found to be incompatible with 
cangrelor for co-administration. However, as results of assay / degradation products of the admixtures have not 
been provided, it has not been shown that the other 88 products are fully compatible with Cangrelor. This is 
reflected in the SmPC in section 6.2 “in the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be 
mixed with other medicinal products”. 
The primary packaging is a 10 ml glass vials (Type 1) closed with a Flurotec coated butyl rubber stopper and 
sealed  with  crimped  aluminium  seal.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  requirements.  The  choice  of  the 
container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of seven main steps: thawing of the active substance, preparation of 
cangrelor bulk solution, bioburden reduction by filtration, sterile filtration and aseptic filling, lyophilisation and 
stoppering, capping and secondary packaging.  Critical steps have been defined and the in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. The process has been validated and 
results of three commercial scale validation batches have been provided showing compliance to the 
requirements. Holding times have been set based on the validation runs and/or media fill results. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in 
a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and are the 
following: appearance (visual), description of constituted solution (visual), reconstitution time (visual), pH (Ph. 
Eur.), moisture content (KF), identification (HPLC, UV), assay and degradation products (HPLC), particulate 
matter (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and  uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur., HPLC). The 
release and shelf-life limits are identical except for one specified impurity and total degradants.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
The analytical methods have been adequately described and validated.  
Batch analysis results are provided for 2 production scale batches and 1 pilot batch manufacture at the proposed 
manufacturing site confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  Additional batch analysis results are provided for batches manufactured at other 
manufacturing sites.

Stability of the product 
Stability data of two commercial scale and six pilot scale development batches of finished product stored under 
long term conditions for 48 months at 25 ºC / 60 % RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40 ºC / 75 % RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are representative to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in 10 ml type I glass vials with bromobutyl rubber stoppers. 
Samples were tested according to the shelf life specifications. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. The finished product was shown to be stable in the clear glass vial without label and 
is considered to be not light-sensitive. 
Additional stability study on one batch demonstrated that the finished product was stable after freezing (-10°C 
to -20°C) for up to 14 days. However no data were provided to demonstrate that the reconstituted/diluted 
solution could be refrigerated therefore “Do not refrigerate” is included in the storage conditions of the SmPC for 
reconstituted and diluted product. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin are used in the product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics such as sterility, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction  
The non clinical part of this application is based on studies in animals where pharmacodynamics, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology of cangrelor have been characterized. Cangrelor is pharmacologically active in 
both rats and dogs, and is metabolized similarly in rats, dogs, and humans. 
All pivotal toxicity studies were performed in compliance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
that were in place at time of conduct. Some early studies do not claim GLP compliance although they were 
conducted in a GLP compliant environment. However, the pre-clinical safety program was conducted in the mid 
1990s. During this time, ICH safety pharmacology guidelines were not in place. As a result, most of the safety 
pharmacology studies including CNS evaluation in mice and cardiovascular evaluation in dogs did not contain 
written assurance of GLP compliance with the exception of a single-dose cardiovascular and respiratory study in 
rats. The non-GLP status of the safety pharmacology studies was not considered to compromise the scientific 
integrity or affect the experimental results. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Cangrelor has a highly selective profile for inhibition of the ADP-dependent platelet aggregation; its 
pharmacology can be characterised as being an inhibitor of platelet aggregation in vitro, in various species, rat 
dog and human, with the rat as a less sensitive animal species. Dose-related pharmacodynamic (PD) platelet 
inhibitory effects of cangrelor have been characterized too in vivo, and these data support cangrelor’s 
therapeutic potential. Cangrelor has shown to be a short-acting, reversible antithrombotic agent in an animal 
disease model of arterial thrombosis.  
In addition, the safety, potency, and efficacy of cangrelor was compared to other IV platelet inhibitors including 
the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, Ro 449883 (also known as lamifiban) and GR 144053, in a canine model of 
thrombosis, and potential PD interactions between cangrelor and other thrombolytic and anticoagulant agents 
commonly employed in thrombotic-related disorders were studied. Cangrelor is also highly effective in 
preventing ADP-induced platelet aggregation including when administered in combination with 
tissue-plasminogen activator.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The nonclinical pharmacology screening of cangrelor indicated no important secondary PD actions such as 
physiological processes and organ functions unrelated to platelet function including activity on P1 purinergic 
receptors, adrenergic, dopaminergic (D2), histaminergic, and serotonergic receptor mediated functions, as well 
as neutrophil activation. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology program consisted of studies in conscious and anesthetized mice, rats, cats, and dogs, 
which evaluated autonomic, cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous system (CNS), and behavioral 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 20/113 
 
  
  
 
 
responses to continuous IV infusions of cangrelor for various durations of dosing ranging from 10 minutes to 
several days. The main findings are described below: 
Cangrelor is associated with some CNS-effects, despite the fact that in a distribution study in rats (at much lower 
doses: about 1-1.5 mg/kg) almost no distribution to the brain has been observed. The latter fact support the 
conclusion that a considerable margin of safety is expected for this effect of cangrelor, compared with the 
therapeutic dose. 
Cangrelor does not induce cardiovascular effects in dogs, which might be sufficiently predictive for the human 
situation. Other data suggest that cangrelor showed an interaction with tissue plasminogen activator, which can 
interpreted as contributing to the therapeutic effect. Negative pharmacodynamic interactions have not been 
identified thus far. An hERG-assay, has not been conducted. The lack of this type of data has been justified. 
In conclusion, the results of the safety pharmacology studies did not indicate a special safety risk for cangrelor 
use in humans. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The methods used in the pivotal toxicity studies were not always the validated versions described in the 
pharmacokinetics section. Moreover, in spite of the fact that stability of the parent compound was only shown for 
storage periods of 4-8 weeks, and stability of the metabolite in plasma samples could not be established, in the 
toxicokinetics studies the samples were stored for up to several months. Considering the very variable plasma 
concentrations of parent compound, and lack of stability data of the metabolite in plasma over the periods of 
storage of the samples, it must be concluded that overall the reported toxicokinetic data probably are inaccurate 
and may either under- or overestimate the actual exposure. A satisfactory explanation of the observed 
variability has not been provided. The possibility that the toxicokinetic data may either under- or overestimate; 
the actual exposure should be kept in mind when interpreting the data. The applicant indicated that the 
analytical methods were not technically the same due to the fact the assays have different extraction and 
detection methods. This has been mentioned in the nonclinical overview. 
Absorption 
In general, plasma pharmacokinetic properties of cangrelor and its main metabolite AR-C69712XX are similar 
between rats and dogs, and are linear and dose-proportional. In rats and dogs, steady-state plasma levels of 
cangrelor were observed at the time the first blood sample was taken and remained stable until the infusion was 
stopped. After infusion, plasma cangrelor levels declined rapidly with an initial plasma elimination half-life of less 
than 2 min in the rat and less than 1 min in the dog. Approximately 90% of a total dose of cangrelor was cleared 
from the plasma during the initial elimination phase. This was followed by a more prolonged terminal elimination 
phase for the remaining 10% of infused drug. The plasma concentration profile in rabbits declined in a biphasic 
manner similar to rats and dogs, however, the half-life of the initial phases was significantly longer (~20 
minutes). In addition, the exposure (AUC) in rabbits was higher compared to rats and dogs. Plasma clearance 
differed between the species examined, varying from low in rabbits to moderate in rat and dog. The volume of 
distribution indicates low distribution into tissues in rabbit, and female dogs, and moderate tissue distribution in 
rat and male dog. Cangrelor terminal half-life, Vd and AUC values were consistently greater in males compared 
to females in rats and dogs, however duration of infusions in males was also longer than in the females. The 
exposure to the main plasma metabolite AR-C69712XX varied between species: 4% of cangrelor in rabbits, 18% 
of cangrelor in rats, 26% of cangrelor in humans and 52% of cangrelor in dogs. Following repeated infusions, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 21/113 
 
  
  
exposure to cangrelor increased approximately dose-proportional. Cangrelor or its metabolites are not retained 
in the body, nor do they accumulate with successive infusions. 
Distribution 
Cangrelor was highly bound to plasma proteins in vitro in rat, dog and human, with a plasma protein binding of 
~97-98% in rats, ~92-93% in dogs and ~97-98% in humans, respectively. ARL-69712XX is also highly bound, 
though less than cangrelor, to plasma proteins, ~88-89% in rats and ~85-86% in dogs. In humans, the plasma 
protein binding of ARL-69712XX is ~88-89%. The free fraction of cangrelor and ARL-69712XX in dogs at the 
tested concentrations is therefore a factor 3-4 higher than in rat and human.  
Radiolabelled cangrelor in rats quickly distributed to highly vasculated and excretory organs, like liver, kidney, 
heart, lung and spleen. In addition, high concentrations were found in the pancreas and intestinal tract. 
Radioactivity in most organs and tissues decreased quickly after infusion, but in the intestinal tract, radioactivity 
increased further for up to 6 hours, after which it decreased too. The high concentrations in intestinal content 
can be considered due to biliary excretion. The kidneys also showed high levels for prolonged time. Brain, spinal 
cord and eyes contained negligible quantities at all time points. There was no evidence of binding to melanine in 
the eyes. However, it is noted that at very high doses (≥100 mg/kg/day), neurotoxicity was observed. At 6 
hours, signs of renal tubular toxicity were seen and radioactivity increased in the order: renal medulla < renal 
inner cortex < renal pelvis < urine. No specific cellular location of the radioactivity in inner cortex and papilla 
could be distinguished. Animals predosed with unlabelled cangrelor showed a distinctive pattern of distribution, 
with radioactivity concentrated in the lumen and adjacent cells of tubules scattered throughout the cortex, this 
seemed associated with renal tubular degeneration and necrosis. Increased levels of radioactivity in discrete 
areas of renal pelvis and bladder were consistent with an urothelial distribution and suggest that cangrelor 
and/or its metabolites were higher at this location than in the surrounding tissue. At 24 hours post dose, most 
radioactivity had been eliminated from the kidneys. 
Only low quantities of radioactivity were detectable in the foetal body. Since the highest concentration in the 
foetal body was observed 30 minutes after infusion, it was assumed that this radioactivity was due to 
metabolites more lipophilic than the parent compound crossing the placenta. In the embryo-foetal toxicity 
studies embryofoetal toxicity was observed at all tested doses. It cannot be excluded that the more prolonged 
infusion in these studies resulted in higher embryo-foetal exposure than observed in the distribution study.  
Metabolism 
Cangrelor is rapidly metabolised in the circulation by dephosphorylation to a nucleoside metabolite, 
AR-C69712XX. The initial inactivation step is followed by metabolism to various products, mainly sulphoxides, 
which are eliminated. The primary enzyme systems responsible for the metabolism of cangrelor have not been 
identified. Metabolism of cangrelor was studied in rats and dogs and was similar in both species with no sex 
differences. The metabolic profile of cangrelor in the examined animals is similar to that in humans.  
Excretion 
Rats and dogs of both sexes excreted most of the dose within the first 24 hrs and excretion was almost complete 
after 48 hrs. Overall recovery was >90% for most subgroups. Metabolites are excreted mainly via the feces 
(male rat 60%, female rat 77%, dog 85%) with a small proportion excreted in the urine (male rat 30%, female 
rat 18%, dogs of both sexes 11%). This is consistent with a biliary route of excretion as the major pathway of 
elimination for cangrelor. No unchanged drug could be detected in excreta. The major metabolite in feces was 
AR-C90441XX, the S-oxide of the purine base of cangrelor. This metabolite was also the major component found 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 22/113 
 
  
  
 
in bile. A major component in urine was AR-C90439XX, the S-oxide derivative of AR-C69712XX, the nucleoside 
metabolite of cangrelor. No milk excretion studies were performed. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The metabolites AR-C69712XX and AR-C90439XX are inhibitors of CYP2C19. However, AR-C69712XX is not an 
inhibitor of CYP2C19 at clinically relevant maximal systemic concentrations. For AR-C90439XX no maximal 
systemic concentration could be calculated; since the Cmax is lower than for AR-C69712XX it can be concluded 
that the observed inhibition is not clinically relevant. Cangrelor and AR-C69712XX were inducers of CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4, but not at clinically relevant systemic concentrations. There was no evidence of CYP inhibition or 
induction by cangrelor or its metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations, indicating that cangrelor does not 
interfere with the CYP metabolism of other concomitantly administered drugs.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose studies were conducted in mice and rats. Cangrelor was administered by bolus IV injection.  
In mice, the maximum non-lethal dose ranged from 100-200 mg/kg and in rats from 200-400 mg/kg. Animals 
that died on study died immediately of within a few minutes after dosing. In surviving animals, overt symptoms 
were  noted  directly  or  developed  within  3-30  minutes.  These  symptoms  included  neurological  effects  and 
transient hypothermia. The latter is a class effect, associated with administration of adenosine and adenosine 
analogues (metabolites of cangrelor are adenosine analogues).  
Recovery was generally within 1-2 hours after dosing. No obvious dose dependence was demonstrated, except 
for the duration of the effects that was prolonged at higher doses. 
At  the  end  of  the  2-weeks  observation  period,  necropsy  revealed  no  specific  findings  in  mice.  In  rats, 
histopathological findings were noted in the kidneys including basophilic tubules associated with cortical tubular 
degeneration, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration, and tubules distended with colloid.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs. Non-GLP 3-day and 1-week dose range-finding 
studies were conducted to identify appropriate doses for pivotal GLP toxicology studies in which cangrelor was 
administered by continuous IV infusion for 1 month. 
The pivotal studies showed that the kidneys, the urinary tract and the liver were target organs of toxicity. 
Important for interpretation of the rats studies is the fact that rats are rather insensitive for the 
pharmacodynamics of cangrelor. In dogs, adverse effects by pharmacodynamics were limited to occasional 
slight increases APTT times. This effect was toxicologically not relevant.  
The adverse effects on the kidneys and the urinary tract consisted of injury to renal tubules, renal pelvis, and 
ureter. Histopathology changes included tubular dilatation, tubular necrosis, tubular regeneration, basophilic 
tubules, interstitial nephritis, pelvic inflammation, urothelial hyperplasia and urothelial necrosis. Renal 
dysfunction was also indicated by elevated plasma creatinine and urea levels and urinary 
N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase and proteinuria. Injury to the urinary tract exhibited evidence of being reversible 
following cessation of infusion.  
Investigative studies in rats suggested that the cangrelor-related toxicity to the kidneys and urinary tract is 
essentially of two types, distinguished by absolute exposure and duration of exposure. Single IV bolus dosing 
studies at high doses (>200 mg/kg) produced damage to proximal tubules in renal cortex. Apparently, at high 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 23/113 
 
  
  
doses of cangrelor, metabolites already reach cytotoxic concentrations in the proximal tubules leading to tubular 
necrosis and interstitial damage. The renal pelvis and ureters were unaffected with this dosing regimen.  
Continuous intravenous infusion at lower doses of 25 or 75 µg/kg/min for 7 and 28 days produced a different 
pathology in which the lesion was localized to the renal pelvis and upper ureter. Apparently, at lower doses, 
cytotoxic concentrations of metabolites are reached in later parts of nephron. Renal effects were demonstrated 
within 7 days of treatment. The primary insult appeared to be to the transitional epithelium in the pelvic region, 
manifested by epithelial ulceration and necrosis, associated reactive epithelial hyperplasia and submucosal 
inflammation. Depending on the severity of the lesion, necrosis and inflammation extended into the renal 
parenchyma, connective tissue of the renal hilus and into the peri-ureteral connective tissue. Evidence of 
reversal of renal pathology was seen after 28 days off-dose. 
The mechanism by which cangrelor or metabolites may cause toxic effects on the kidney and urinary tract in rats 
and dogs is unknown. These effects may be related to the exposure of the urinary tract to AR-C90441XX, a 
sulphoxide of the purine base. Another possible mechanism may be related to an interaction of the main plasma 
metabolite AR-C69712XX with the  adenosine A1 receptor. With regard to the PCI setting, margins of safety for 
effects on renal histopathology and function in rats and dogs are high, indicating little clinical relevance. With 
regard to the BRIDGE setting, however, margins of safety for effects on renal/lower urinary tract histopathology 
in rats and dogs are moderate (13- and 11-fold for cangrelor and AR-C69712XX, respectively), and for effects 
on renal function are low (3- and 2-fold for cangrelor and AR-C69712XX, respectively), indicating a potential 
clinical relevance.   
The pivotal toxicity studies in rats and dogs also showed an increase in liver function enzymes. In rats, serum 
chemistry changes included dose-related increases in AST and ALT as well as increases in urea, and slight 
reductions in triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Liver weights showed a slight dose-related decrease. Liver 
necrosis occurred in a few animals of the high dose groups, but no histological changes were found at doses of 
3 or 12 µg/kg/min. An investigative study in rats on liver toxicity showed that the increase in AST and ALT in 
plasma coincided with an increase in ALP and with slight increases in gamma glutamate dehydrogenase and 
5'nucleotidase and a rise in bile acids. In addition, there was a slight increase of gamma glutamyltransferase in 
serum and a remarkable reduction of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase staining. These data 
suggest that cangrelor adversely affects the hepato-biliary system by an adverse effect on mitochondrial 
function. Increased ALP levels in plasma suggest bile duct obstruction.  In addition, a publication of Serhan et al 
(2013) indicates that cangrelor has partial agonistic properties for the P2Y13 receptor. The underlying 
mechanism on cholesterol and lipid metabolism is not entirely clear. Activation of this receptor by cangrelor 
principally targets HDL metabolism in mice by stimulating hepatic HDL uptake and biliary bile acid excretion, 
with some differences between intravenous bolus administration versus continuous delivery of cangrelor.  
Whereas intravenous bolus administration of cangrelor promotes the secretion of all biliary lipids (cholesterol, 
bile acids and phospholipids) without any change in plasma lipid levels, continuous delivery of 70 µM cangrelor 
at a rate of 0.5 µL/h (≈35 μg/kg BW/day) weight for 3 days only increases biliary secretion of bile acids, 
suggesting metabolic adaptations might occur under continuous activation of P2Y13 receptor (Serhan et al, 
2013). The absence of effect of cangrelor continuous delivery on biliary secretion of other lipids is intriguing 
since it is usually reported that biliary secretion of bile acids is coupled to biliary secretion of phospholipid and 
cholesterol. However, the effect of cangrelor on lipid metabolism reported by Serhan et al in animal studies has 
not been observed in clinical studies.  
Slightly increased weights and/or vacuolation of adrenals in rats and the reduced weights of thymus and the 
pituitary gland in rats and dogs were observed in the 7-day and 1-month studies in rats. This could mean that 
cangrelor has some interaction with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This could be a class effect. 
But it seems not to be clinically relevant, since it was only observed the high-dose groups. For ticagrelor, a 
Assessment report

Page 24/113 
 
  
  
medicinal compound of the same class, inhibition of corticosterone synthesis has been demonstrated at clinical 
relevant concentrations, but there were no signs of any effects on the adrenal glands in clinical trials. 
In dogs, target organs of toxicity were essentially the same as those in rats: the kidney, the urinary tract and the 
liver.  
Additional findings in dogs included gastritis and inflammatory changes in the gut. These effects are most likely 
the consequence of the fact that cangrelor and its metabolites are primarily eliminated via the bile. Dogs are 
generally more sensitive for effects on the gastrointestinal tract than rats.  
2.3.4.1.  Genotoxicity 
A battery of genotoxicity tests were performed with cangrelor and two metabolites AR-C69712XX and 
AR-C71301XX. They gave sufficient indications that Cangrelor has no potential to be mutagenic or clastogenic in 
the tested situations. Exposure in the in vivo mouse study has not been measured, but can be assumed to be 
sufficient as the high dose of 500 mg/kg is far in excess of the bolus dose for humans of 30 µg/kg. Slight 
antibacterial property was observed in the Ames test for the major (nucleoside) metabolite AR-C69712XX at a 
concentration of 400 ug/plate and higher. The minor (base) metabolite AR-C71301XX caused precipitation at a 
concentration of 250 ug/plate, and therefore higher concentrations could not be tested. It can be concluded that 
both metabolites do not possess any mutagenic potential up to the tested concentrations of 400 and 250 
µg/plate respectively.  
2.3.4.2.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not provided, this is acceptable since cangrelor is intended for short-term 
administration. 
2.3.4.3.  Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility  
Toxic effects of cangrelor on fertility and early embryonic development were assessed in rats. Male rats 
administered 48 μg/kg/min for a minimum of 8 weeks showed pre-implantation loss, abnormal sperm 
morphology and several morphologic effects on reproduction organs (epididymis, testes, seminal vesicles). 
However, all of the males allocated to the treatment-free period in this dose group produced a pregnancy in at 
least one female and all but one male at this dose showed sperm of normal appearance at the end of the 
treatment-free period indicating that the functional effects are reversible. At the NOAEL of 12 µg/kg/min steady 
state plasma concentrations were similar to those in humans. 
Female rats administered 48 μg/kg/min showed reduced post-implantation survival of embryos, which could 
have been secondary to maternal toxicity, although direct embryo-toxicity cannot be ruled out. There were no 
treatment related effects at 12 μg/kg/min or below. When post-implantation losses are taken into account, 
exposure at the NOAEL in females is similar to that in humans  
Embryonic and Foetal development 
Studies on embryo- and foetal development in rats and rabbits showed no teratogenic effects. Rats showed a 
slight retardation in development of some foetuses at all dose levels (3, 12, and 48 μg/kg/min), indicated by 
slight reductions in fetal weights and increased incidence of unossified hind limb metatarsals. These effects were 
in the absence of any overt maternal toxicity. The high-dose group showed also an increased incidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 25/113 
 
  
  
incomplete ossification of skull and sternebrae bone. Since no fetal NOAEL was determined in this study, no 
safety margin for fetal toxicity is determined.  
Cangrelor administered to rabbit resulted in foetotoxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity. Rabbits dosed 
with 4, 12, or 36 µg/kg/min cangrelor showed reversible maternal toxicity (decreased food and water 
consumption &  body weigh) and intrauterine losses /abortion in the low (1 case) mid (4 cases) and high (3 
cases) dose groups. Offspring in 36 μg/kg/min dosed group showed growth retardation occurred at decreased 
foetal weight (female offspring 9%). In all groups a slight reduction in ossification and a slight increase in 
skeletal variants were observed. A NOAEL could not be determined.  
Based on these observations, cangrelor should not be administered to pregnant women. 
Pre and postnatal development 
Female rats were dosed with (continuously IV) 3, 9 and 30 µg/kg/min cangrelor. Three dams from the 30 
µg/kg/min dose group were euthanized (no clear cause of condition) before termination. The increase in the 
mortality incidence for this group tends to suggest that there was a relationship to the administration of 
cangrelor. However, pregnancy rates, gestation index, length of gestation, sex ratio, and the live birth index 
were unaffected by drug treatment at all dose levels. No effects upon cangrelor administration to the F0 
Generation dams were seen in F1 Generation pups and adults apart from a very slight non significant but dose 
dependent reduction in F1 birth weight, consistent with the delay in development seen in the embryo-foetal 
toxicity study. In F2 Generation pups, viability, clinical condition, litter size, and body weights showed no effects 
of administration of cangrelor to the F0 generation. NOAEL for maternal toxicity is 9 µg/kg/min and for offspring  
F1 and F2 generation 30 µg/kg/min. No toxicokinetics were done in this study, but extrapolation from other 
studies indicate that at the NOAEL for fetal toxicity (highest dose of 30 µg/kg/min), exposure in terms of steady 
state concentration is sufficiently in excess of clinical exposures. 
2.3.4.4.  Local tolerance 
Separate local tolerance studies were not conducted. However, histopathological findings at the injection sites of 
rats and dogs administered cangrelor by continuous infusion for 1 month at doses up to 48 and 60 μg/kg/min, 
respectively, demonstrated that the type, incidence, and severity of injection-site lesions were comparable 
among cangrelor and vehicle treated groups. Several of the more frequently noted findings in both groups 
included inflammation, thrombus formation, and vasculitis. 
2.3.4.5.  Antigenicity 
The antigenicity of cangrelor was investigated in Hartley strain guinea pigs by their active systemic anaphylaxis 
(ASA) and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PSA) reactions. The results showed no signs of antigenic potential. 
2.3.4.6.  Impurities 
Seven identified impurities in the drug substance exceed the recommended ICH Q3A (R2) identification 
threshold of 0.10% in the drug substance. Three of these impurities exceed the qualification threshold of 0.15% 
for drug substances with a maximum daily dose of ≤2 g. These impurities are: 3312H (AR-C125263XX) at a limit 
≤0.3%, 3312P (AR-C88558XX) at a limit ≤0.3%, and 3312.U (AR-C90334XX) at a limit of ≤0.2%.  DEREK 
analyses did not demonstrate any alerts for genotoxicity, mutagenicity, chromosome damage or 
carcinogenicity. In addition, these impurities were qualified by using a forced degraded drug substance in a male 
fertility study in rats. 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 26/113 
 
  
  
Tributylamine en triethylphosphate are residual solvents in the drug substance limited at ≤1000 ppm and at 
≤500 ppm, respectively, in the drug substance. These impurities are not classified by the current ICH guidelines 
on residual solvents. However, based on available information on toxicology, the proposed limit of 500 ppm for 
tributylamine and 1000 ppm for triethylphosphate in the drug substance are agreed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Cangrelor tetrasodium possesses five sites of ionization, four acidic groups and the basic nitrogen of the 
adenosine ring. The first three ionizations correspond to phosphate groups and are acidic, with the pKa values 
being ≤2. Therefore these pKa values are not measured using standard techniques. The pKa for the 
deprotonation of the nitrogen of the adenosine ring was determined by a spectroscopic method and the pKa for 
the terminal phosphate group was determined. 
Based on the log Dow cangrelor tetrasodium is not expected to be PBT, nor vPvB. The applicant has determined 
distribution coefficients (log D) for cangrelor tetrasodium in octanol/water at low pH values. The results show 
that above pH 2.2, the compound is highly ionized and therefore extremely hydrophilic, beyond the limits of 
quantification. The applicant concludes that at physiological pH 7.4, the compound will exist as the tetra-anion 
and at this pH the log D has been estimated to be <-16. 
The PEC surfacewater of cangrelor is 0.008 µg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A further 
assessment is not deemed necessary.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Cangrelor pharmacology can be characterized as being an inhibitor of platelet aggregation in vitro, in various 
species, rat dog and human, with the rat as a less sensitive animal species.

There are no major objections against the non-clinical part of the dossier, a marketing authorization can be

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The drug substance cangrelor is chemically similar to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The empirical formula of 
cangrelor (as the tetrasodium salt) is C17H21N5Cl2F3Na4O12P3S2 and the molecular weight is 864.3 grams 
(g)/mole. Cangrelor is highly soluble in water. The recommended dose of cangrelor for patients undergoing PCI 
is a 30 µg/kg intravenous bolus followed immediately by 4 µg/kg/min intravenous infusion. The recommended 
dose of cangrelor for the bridging indication is 0.75 µg/kg/min intravenous infusion. A total of 9 studies and 
population pharmacokinetic modelling have been performed.  
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods were validated HPLC/MS methods, the pharmacokinetic analyses and statistics are 
acceptable. Several analytical methods were used for the determination of cangrelor and its main circulating 
metabolite. The Applicant has not submitted any data to support cross-validation, however, it was confirmed 
that the analytical methods gave comparable results. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was included using 
data from 8 different studies. In this model cangrelor was described using a two compartment model with an 
allometric coefficient for body weight. 
Absorption 
Cangrelor is a solution for intravenous (IV) administration. Therefore, bioavailability, comparative 
bioavailability, or bioequivalence studies that would be conducted with oral drugs were not relevant for this 
product. Hence, there are no study reports provided under this heading. The final formulation of cangrelor 
administered IV throughout the clinical program was a solution diluted in sterile saline. Based on the consistency 
of key PK parameters within and across studies, there is no evidence that the use of different Drug Product 
batches resulted in any differences in performance of cangrelor. 
Cangrelor is a solution for intravenous (IV) administration. Therefore the influence of food has not been 
investigated.

Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vz) was investigated in study TMC-Can-04-02, for 2 comparable groups of subjects 
at different dose levels. The Vz was estimated as the ratio of total administered dose and the product of terminal 
elimination rate constant and AUCinf. 
For the cangrelor 15 μg/kg IV bolus + 2 μg/kg/min (1 hour) group, the Vz was determined to be 5.57 ± 0.549 
L and for the cangrelor 30 μg/kg IV bolus + 4 μg/kg/min (1 hour) to be 3.88 ± 1.18 L. 
The level of plasma protein binding was determined in study SE 10009. In this in vitro study, the extent of 
plasma protein binding was investigated for rat, dog and human plasma at target concentrations of 20, 100 and 
400 ng/ml. The study demonstrated a high amount of plasma protein binding in human plasma of 97.3-98.1%. 
In summary, the volume of distribution is estimated 3.9 L, most likely confined to the blood compartment. 
Plasma protein binding is high, demonstrated to be 97-98% with no concentration dependency. 
Elimination 
The elimination of cangrelor has been investigated using a mass balance study, SC-931-9017. Total recovery of 
the radioactivity was about 93%, primarily recovered in the urine (58%) and a smaller part in the faeces (35%). 
Cangrelor was not recovered unchanged in urine and faeces. The very rapid initial elimination phase with a half 
life of 3-6 minutes was followed by a terminal elimination phase starting about 30 hour after the infusion, with 
a half-life of 51.7 ± 12.7h. 
Metabolism 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 29/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The metabolism of cangrelor is quick and extensive with a very rapid initial elimination phase of the parent. None 
of the metabolites demonstrate significant activity. The main metabolite is AR-C69712XX formed by rapid 
de-phosphorylation of the parent. This metabolite demonstrates a Cmax about 26% of that of the parent and is 
further metabolized to AR-C90439XX, only traces are recovered in faeces and urine. Its sulphoxide metabolite 
AR-C90439XX demonstrated a Cmax of about 16% of the parent and is the main excreted metabolite, 27% was 
recovered in urine and 7% in faeces. Minor other metabolites are recovered in faeces and urine such as 
AR-C90441XX and AR-C71301XX. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The primary metabolite AR-C69712XX demonstrated a Cmax of about 26% of the parent, metabolite 
AR-C90439XX demonstrated a Cmax of about 16% of the parent as above mentioned. The half-life of both these 
metabolites was considerably longer than the half-life of the parent, respectively 2.7 ± 0.2 h and 1.0 ± 0.1 h. 
Plasma pharmacokinetics parameters for metabolite AR-C90441XX were not determined. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Only limited pharmacokinetics assessment has been performed in the patient populations. The presented 
analyses do not indicate a difference in pharmacokinetic profile between patients and healthy volunteers. The 
presence of such a difference is not expected based on the pharmacokinetic properties of cangrelor. 
Administration of cangrelor in the target population for the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) setting, 30 
μg/kg + 4 μg/kg/min has been studied and characterized. 
Special populations 
Study SC-931-5109 demonstrated that clearance is decreased for both the parent and the metabolites in renally 
impaired subjects. For this study, renally impaired patients were defined as having a creatinine clearance of 20 
- 70 ml/min and healthy volunteers >90 ml/min. The usual creatinine clearance subdivision for renal 
impairment, as described by the European guidelines is; normal renal function >80 ml/min, mild renal 
impairment 50-80 ml/min, moderate renal impairment 30-<50 ml/min and severe renal impairment <30 
ml/min. Pharmacokinetic data of study SC-931-5109 should have been stratified in accordance with the usual 
subdivision of renal impairment. 
The data available do indicate that renal impairment is not likely to significantly alter the pharmacokinetics.  
The clearance of the inactive metabolites was decreased by approximately 2 fold in renally impaired subjects. 
Also, for the parent compound a small tendency for decreased clearance was observed in patients with 
decreased renal function. 
The influence of an impaired hepatic function has not been investigated by the applicant.  
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation did not identify a covariate effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of 
cangrelor, nor is it expected based on the specific metabolism of cangrelor.  
The population pharmacokinetic modelling approach indicated weight to be a covariate, other factors race, 
gender, and age did not identify as a covariate effect. 
The influence of weight on the pharmacokinetics of cangrelor has been investigated more thoroughly in the 
pharmacokinetic modelling approach, the effect is estimated to be modest and below 10% at the extremes of 
the modelled weights. 
Interaction 
In vitro studies were performed which demonstrate no evidence of CYP inhibition or induction by cangrelor or 
AR-C69712XX at clinically relevant concentrations, indicating that cangrelor does not interfere with the CYP 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 30/113 
 
  
  
metabolism of other concomitantly administered drugs. Transporter interaction studies for both cangrelor and 
AR-C69712XX at clinically relevant concentrations have been performed. With the exception of BCRP, none of 
the findings could indicate a potential clinical interaction with transporter proteins. 
The in vivo study demonstrates that pharmacokinetics of cangrelor for the parent and AR-C69712XX are 
unaffected by the concomitant administration of aspirin, heparin or nitroglycerin. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of Action 
Cangrelor is a novel, intravenous (IV), P2Y12 receptor antagonist that blocks adenosine diphosphate 
(ADP)-induced platelet activation and aggregation. Cangrelor was specifically designed as a direct-acting, 
competitive, reversible antagonist of the P2Y12 receptor. These properties clearly differentiate cangrelor from 
the thienopyridine class of P2Y12 inhibitors, exemplified by clopidogrel and prasugrel, which require metabolic 
conversion to exhibit P2Y12 inhibition and, due to a covalent interaction with the receptor, result in irreversible 
inhibition that is maintained even when parent drug and active metabolite have been cleared. The requirement 
for metabolic conversion is also one of the contributory factors to the large inter-individual variability in 
response seen with the thienopyridine class of P2Y12 inhibitors, but not with cangrelor, or the oral, direct acting 
P2Y12 antagonist, ticagrelor. The latter agent, although direct acting and reversible at the receptor level, 
requires a number of hours to achieve steady state P2Y12 inhibition, and a period of hours to days following 
cessation of treatment for full recovery of platelet responsiveness to ADP. 
Primary Pharmacology 
Inhibition of Platelet aggregation 
In two studies, dose-related reduction of platelet responses to ADP, measured ex vivo, was observed, with over 
80% inhibition achieved at doses of 0.5 µg/kg/min and above. Inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation was 
maintained during the plateau infusion, and generally restored to control values when measured at 20 and 60 
minute post-infusion, respectively, for all dose levels.

Figure PD1 illustrates the group mean responses at each infusion rate, and post infusion, for percentage 
inhibition of ADP induced aggregation after 57 minutes into each infusion.  Dose-related reduction of platelet 
responses to ADP, measured ex vivo, was observed, with over 80% inhibition achieved at doses of 0.5 
µg/kg/min and above. Inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation was maintained during the plateau infusion, and 
generally restored to control values when measured at 20 and 60 minute post-infusion, respectively, for all dose 
levels.  
Consistency of effect of cangrelor  
In study [SC-931-9064], 8 healthy male volunteers received clopidogrel 75 mg/d for 11 days. Blood samples 
were taken on Days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 11. Each blood sample was split and ADP-induced platelet aggregation was 
measured either in the blood sample as taken or after addition in vitro of cangrelor (500 nM, 386 ng/mL). 
In the absence of cangrelor, reduction of platelet reactivity to ADP by clopidogrel is dependent upon duration of 
treatment and, even after 11 days clopidogrel treatment, residual platelet reactivity to 10 µM ADP ranged from 
8 to 86%. Addition of cangrelor in vitro resulted in substantial reduction of platelet responses to ADP at 
concentrations of up to 30 µM, in all cases, at all time-points, regardless of the effect of clopidogrel. However, 
a response could still be induced by further increases in the ADP challenge (approximately 30% of maximum 
baseline response at the highest concentration of ADP (300 µM) (Figure PD2).

Onset and offset of action of cangrelor in PCI  
In study SC-931-5129, cangrelor produced a dose-related reduction in the platelet response to ADP (3 µM) in 
patients undergoing PCI. Platelet responses returned toward baseline within 15 minutes of discontinuation of 
infusion in all treatment groups, except for those receiving 4 µg/kg/min of cangrelor where it remained 
significantly inhibited at 15 minutes (Figure PD3) but had recovered by the next time point assessed (24 hours). 
This study demonstrated that cangrelor provides potent and consistent platelet P2Y12 inhibition during IV 
infusion, with rapid offset of effect following cessation of infusion in PCI patients.

Secondary Pharmacology 
Effect of cangrelor on the QT/QTc interval in healthy volunteers [TMC-CAN-08-01] 
An initial phase of the study established the safety of a supratherapeutic dose of cangrelor (60 µg/kg IV bolus 
plus 8 µg/kg/min IV infusion for 3 hours) in 6 healthy volunteers. In the main phase, 71 subjects were treated 
in a 4-way crossover design: all receiving cangrelor at therapeutic (30 µg/kg IV bolus plus 4 µg/kg/min of IV 
infusion for 3 h plus) and supratherapeutic (60 µg/kg IV bolus plus 8 µg/kg/min IV infusion for 3 h) doses.  
Based on assessment of individual corrected QT: individual corrected QT interval of the electrocardiogram 
(QTcI), Fridericia corrected QT: Fridericia corrected QT interval of the electrocardiogram (QTcF), and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology analysis, it was concluded that neither therapeutic nor supratherapeutic 
doses of cangrelor affected cardiac repolarization or ECG morphology.  
The submitted data from study TMC-CAN-08-01 demonstrate that cangrelor has no relevant effect on QTc even 
in the supratherapeutic dose of 60 µg/kg IV bolus plus 8 µg/kg/min IV infusion for 3 h.  
In a thorough QT study  therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of cangrelor infusion were administered for 
three hours. Compared to placebo no prolongation of QT, regardless of analysis method, was revealed; the 
upper bound of each 90% CI did not exceed 5 msec in any of the time points. Oral moxifloxacin was used as a 
positive control (Tmax ~2-4h).  
Cangrelor did not seem to prolong QT interval. Control treatment with moxifloxacin 400mg slightly prolonged QT 
interval. At two time points, namely at 2h and 4h post dose, the lower limit of the 90%CI of the prolongation in 
QT interval was above 5 msec, but remained below 5 msec for all other time points. Tmax of moxifloxacin is 
2-4h. No increase in the QT interval was seen for cangrelor supratherapeutic doses. Although the assay 
sensitivity is not well established, since the lower limit of 90%CI exceeded 5 msec only at two time points, it is 
agreed with the Applicant that cangrelor does not appear to increase the QT interval.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
Transition strategy between cangrelor and oral P2Y12 inhibitors 
Separate set of studies were designed to determine the optimal strategy for transitioning from P2Y12 inhibition 
with cangrelor during the acute peri-procedural period to post procedural maintenance P2Y12 inhibition with 
clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel. 
  Clopidogrel 
 Study [TMC-CAN-04-02] in healthy volunteers (groups C and D)  
Ten healthy volunteers received a 600 mg oral loading dose of clopidogrel and then underwent serial platelet 
function monitoring for 6 h. Two weeks later these same individuals received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose 
simultaneously with a cangrelor IV bolus (30 μg/kg) and a 2-hour infusion (4 μg/kg/min). A separate group of 
ten volunteers received a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose after administration of a cangrelor bolus and a 1-hour 
infusion.  
In this study cangrelor and clopidogrel alone achieved the expected levels of platelet inhibition. However, the 
sustained platelet inhibition anticipated for clopidogrel treatment did not occur when cangrelor was initiated 
simultaneously. No such effect was found when clopidogrel was started upon completion of the cangrelor 
infusion.

  CHAMPION Platelet Substudy [TMC-CAN-05-02-S1/TMC-CAN-05-03-S1] in PCI patients 
A total of 234 patients were enrolled into the substudy, of which 167 had valid or evaluable samples for the 
primary endpoint (% patients in each treatment group who achieved less than a 20% change in PRU 
(VerifyNow® P2Y12 assay) from pre-to post-clopidogrel levels at least 10 h after PCI). Platelet function 
parameters were measured using the VerifyNow® P2Y12Assay (for the primary endpoint), and at selected sites, 
using LTA. 
The pre-specified primary endpoint was not met, the percentage of patients with <20% change in PRU from 
baseline at >10 hour after discontinuation of study drug infusion was not statistically different between arms 
cangrelor ([32/84, 38.1%]; clopidogrel [21/83, 25.3%], difference: 12.79% [95% CI: -1.18%, 26.77%] 
p=0.076). However, cangrelor provided effective P2Y12 inhibition during infusion, with platelet reactivity well 
below thresholds associated with a risk of thrombotic events in patients undergoing PCI. 
Baseline, on-infusion and post-infusion (up to 24 hour) PRU values are shown in figure PD4. This illustrates the 
significant reduction in PRU during cangrelor infusion, and the similar course followed in the cangrelor and 
clopidogrel groups post-infusion. No evidence of a rebound “overshoot” in platelet reactivity after cessation of 
cangrelor infusion.

 
Two phase 2 studies designed to demonstrate that patients treated with cangrelor can be transitioned to 
oral  prasugrel  (MDCO-CAN-13-01  (N=12))/ticagrelor  (MDCO-CAN-12-03  (N=12))  and  that  patients 
treated with prasugrel/ticagrelor can be transitioned to cangrelor without a significant interruption of 
platelet P2Y12 inhibition. 
Prasugrel. In study MDCO-CAN-13-01, CAD patients received a bolus plus 2 hour infusion of cangrelor on day 
1. Subjects received a 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel during or immediately after infusion of cangrelor. After 
Day 1, subjects took a maintenance dose of 10 mg of prasugrel every 24 h for either 5 (n=6) or 6 (n=6) doses, 
thus, discontinuing prasugrel either 48 h or 24 h prior to Day 8 dosing. On study Day 8, subjects received 
another bolus plus 2 h infusion of cangrelor (figure PD5). Pharmacodynamic effects (platelet aggregation in

response to 20 μM ADP) were assessed. The goal was to determine the time of administration that leads to 
lowest residual platelet reactivity (greatest inhibition) throughout transition. 
During Day 1 cangrelor infusion, extensive platelet inhibition was observed as limited residual platelet reactivity 
(<4% aggregation) and greater than 95% inhibition for the primary endpoint of final response to 20 µM ADP 
assessed by LTA. The PD effect of cangrelor was not attenuated by concomitant or previous treatment with 
prasugrel. In the overall patient population (n=12), no limitation by prasugrel of the inhibitory effect of 
cangrelor was apparent during the infusion of cangrelor.  
On Study Day 1, a loading dose of prasugrel given at 30 minutes before end of cangrelor infusion preserved 
antiplatelet effects to a greater extent than when prasugrel was given at 1 hour before the end of the cangrelor 
infusion or at end of cangrelor infusion (2 h).  For each prasugrel dosing regimen, recovery of platelet reactivity 
was temporary, and substantial antiplatelet effects were apparent by 3.5 hours after cangrelor was stopped 
(Figure  PD5).

For the transition between prasugrel and cangrelor on Day 8, there was no apparent interaction between the 
drugs regardless of whether the prasugrel had been discontinued 24 or 48 hours prior to initiation of the 
cangrelor infusion.

Ticagrelor. Study MDCO-CAN-12-03 is comparable in design to study MDCO-CAN-13-01, but investigates 
transition from and to ticagrelor instead. CAD patients received a bolus plus 2 hour infusion of cangrelor. 
Subjects received a 180 mg dose of ticagrelor either 0.5 hours (n=6) or 1.25 hours (n=6) after initiation of 
cangrelor. Subjects took 90 mg of ticagrelor twice daily for either 6 (n=6) or 7 (n=6) doses. On study Day 5, 
subjects received another bolus plus 2 hour infusion of cangrelor. Pharmacodynamic effects (primary endpoint 
platelet aggregation in response to 20 μM ADP) were assessed. 
During the cangrelor infusion, extensive platelet inhibition was observed as reflected by limited residual platelet 
reactivity (<4% aggregation). No limitation of the inhibitory effect of cangrelor by ticagrelor was apparent. 
When cangrelor was discontinued on Day 1, the residual platelet reactivity increased during the first 30 minutes 
and decreased thereafter. When ticagrelor was administered at 0.5 hours (n=6) or 1.25 hours after initiation of 
cangrelor (n=6), the average final aggregation (primary endpoint) increased to 16% and 21% respectively. This 
minimal recovery of function is most likely a reflection of the onset of effect with ticagrelor. For the transition 
between ticagrelor and cangrelor on Day 5, there was no observed interaction between the drugs regardless of 
whether the ticagrelor had been discontinued 12 or 24 hours prior to initiation of the cangrelor infusion (figure 
PD7).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The key structural attributes of cangrelor allow its rapid inactivation in the circulation by de-phosphorylation to 
an inactive nucleoside metabolite AR-C69712XX. Pharmacokinetics parameters have only been investigated to 
a certain limit in special populations. In principle this could be acceptable, as the highly specific metabolism of 
cangrelor is expected to be independent of such influencing factors. 
Dose proportionality for cangrelor has been demonstrated, dose linearity has been confirmed up to an infusion 
rate of 4 µg/kg/min. 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 37/113 
 
  
  
 
The main metabolite of cangrelor is AR-C69712XX formed by rapid de-phosphorylation of the parent compound. 
The rapid loss of circulating parent drug by de-phosphorylation is likely mediated through ectonucleotidase 
activity in the blood vessel wall and so independent of organ function. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
cangrelor and metabolites support the proposed metabolism pathway by endothelial ecto-nucleoside 
triphosphate di-phosphohydrolase 1.  Pharmacokinetics of the main metabolite AR-C69712XX and metabolite 
AR-C90439XX have been characterized, but not for the metabolite AR-C90441XX. The limited investigation is 
acceptable as the metabolites demonstrate no relevant activity and have lower plasma levels (exposure) than 
the parent drug. 
The inter-individual variability of cangrelor clearance has been estimated between 14 – 22%.  
Limited pharmacokinetic assessment has been performed in the patient populations. However, the presented 
analyses do not indicate a difference in pharmacokinetic profile between patients and healthy volunteers.  
Administration of cangrelor as proposed in the bridge setting initially proposed indication, 0.75 μg/kg/min, has 
not specifically been studied in patients or healthy volunteers. However, cangrelor demonstrates good dose 
linearity, and dosing at 0.5 μg/kg/min and 1.0 μg/kg/min has been studied. Population pharmacokinetics 
estimates the Css of 68.33 µg/ml at the proposed bridge dosing of 0.75 µg/kg/min. 
Pharmacokinetics parameters have only been investigated to a certain extent in special populations (see below).   
The renal impairment study SC-931-5109 lacked a proper subdivision to the degree of renal impairment and in 
the therapeutic dose group (4 µg/kg/min) only one subject with severe renal impairment was included. The 
Applicant presented data from the renal impairment study by severity of renal impairment (mild, moderate and 
severe), data from two dose levels were combined and dose normalised data (together with eGFR for each renal 
impairment group) in comparison to healthy volunteers and data from the Phase III studies were included in the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis. These data showed a moderate effect of renal impairment considered 
clinically insignificant. However limited information is available in particular in severe renal impairment. (see 
efficacy and safety sections).  
Hepatic impairment studies have not been performed, which can be acceptable as it is not likely to significantly 
influence pharmacokinetics of the parent or the metabolites and the minimal amount excreted in faeces 
(approximately 0% unchanged and 35% of total radioactivity). 
Regarding other intrinsic factors only weight was found to be a covariate. Other factors like race, gender, and 
age were not identified as a covariate effect on the pharmacokinetics of cangrelor, nor was that expected based 
on the specific metabolism of cangrelor.  
The influence of weight on the pharmacokinetics of cangrelor has been investigated more thoroughly in the 
pharmacokinetic modelling approach. The effect is estimated to be modest and below 10% at the extremes of 
the modelled weights when dosed on weight base. The Applicant submitted data from the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis which showed that a flat dose regimen does increase the variability considerably.  
Due to the highly specific metabolism of cangrelor by de-phosphorylation to an inactive nucleoside metabolite 
AR-C69712XX, interactions have only been investigated to a certain extent. 
In vitro studies demonstrate no evidence of CYP inhibition or induction by cangrelor or AR-C69712XX at clinically 
relevant concentrations, indicating that cangrelor does not interfere with the CYP metabolism of other 
concomitantly administered drugs. 
No inhibition or induction potential towards CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 were found. Regarding transporter interactions, 
it is agreed that no further (in vivo) studies are required. However, findings for BCRP inhibition are reflected in 
the SmPC.   
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 38/113 
 
  
  
The in vivo study demonstrates that pharmacokinetics of cangrelor for the parent and AR-C69712XX are 
unaffected by the concomitant administration of aspirin, heparin or nitro glycerine. 
All relevant information is included in the SmPC sections 5.2 and 4.2.  
Primary Pharmacology  
The studies show the rapid onset of action of cangrelor on ADP induced platelet aggregation which offers an 
advantage in acute settings. The mechanism of action is competitive inhibition at the P2Y12 receptor, which can 
be reversed by high concentrations of ADP. There is a rapid offset of action, with return of platelet function within 
60 minutes after discontinuation of the infusion , which implies that cangrelor infusion can be continued until one 
hour prior to the administration of anaesthesia for surgery when it should be discontinued.  
Data on QTc do not indicate that cangrelor is associated with QT prolongation. Some PD data regarding 
transition of cangrelor from and to other P2Y12 receptor antagonists are available, which is currently reflected in 
the SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Clopidogrel.  
Regarding switching from cangrelor to clopidogrel, PD data show that the efficacy of clopidogrel is diminished in 
samples pre-incubated with cangrelor. The presented PD data do not clearly indicate when clopidogrel is fully 
effective following cangrelor. However, PD results show that platelet reactivity is comparable in patients 
administered clopidogrel and those administered cangrelor. In addition, clinical trial experience from the main 
submitted study C-PHOENIX indicate that such transition was successfully implemented, with no relevant 
difference between clinical events in patients maintained on clopidogrel throughout the study compared to 
patients administered cangrelor followed by clopidogrel. The advice implemented in the SmPC (section 4.2) is to 
start clopidogrel loading dose immediately after stopping the cangrelor infusion.   
Prasugrel.  
Pharmacodynamic results show that transition is best accomplished when prasugrel is administered 30 minutes 
prior to the end of the cangrelor administration. The differences between the transition to clopidogrel or 
prasugrel take into consideration their differences in PK/PD properties. Administering prasugrel earlier than 30 
min before the end of cangrelor infusion will not offer any advantage because of receptor occupancy. Accordingly 
the proposed time of 30 min appears optimal. 
Regarding transition from prasugrel to cangrelor as during bridging, submitted data are difficult to interpret. As 
depicted in figure PD7, there are differences in PRU when prasugrel is discontinued 24 or 48 hours prior to 
cangrelor, though at the measured point of 1 hour, the results are comparable. The rationale of safe 
transitioning is that which would ensure a continuation of the platelet inhibitory activity achieved by prasugrel 
when the patient is transitioned to cangrelor (see below under ticagrelor).  
Ticagrelor.  
The submitted PD data demonstrate minimal effect on the platelet reactivity when ticagrelor is co-administrated 
with cangrelor. To maintain adequate platelet inhibition during transition from cangrelor to ticagrelor, the most 
important issue appears to be the onset of action of ticagrelor. With maximal receptor occupancy, as what 
happens with full doses of cangrelor and ticagrelor, no further PD or safety issues are expected. In line with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 39/113 
 
  
  
PK/PD data of ticagrelor, platelet inhibition appears to be better maintained when ticagrelor is administered as 
early as the first half hour of cangrelor infusion. 
In conclusion, the SmPC recommendation with regards to transition to oral P2Y12 inhibitors  is as follows :   For 
transition, a loading dose of oral P2Y12 therapy (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) should be administered 
immediately following discontinuation of cangrelor infusion. Alternatively, a loading dose of ticagrelor or 
prasugrel, but not clopidogrel, may be administered up to 30 minutes before the end of the infusion, see section 
4.5.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic properties have been adequately investigated. Although the investigations 
regarding the metabolism, special populations and drug interactions are limited, in general the pharmacokinetic 
results can be accepted. The limited investigation is in general acceptable due the specific metabolism of 
cangrelor, the rapid inactivation in the circulation by de-phosphorylation.  
Pharmacodynamics 
The submitted data demonstrate that cangrelor is a competitive inhibitor of the P2Y12 receptor, with a rapid 
onset and offset of action. Data on QTc do not indicate that cangrelor is associated with QT prolongation. Some 
PD data regarding transition of cangrelor from and to other P2Y12 receptor antagonists are available, which is 
currently reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy

The three CHAMPION studies (CHAMPION PHOENIX, CHAMPION PLATFORM and CHAMPION PCI) 
are described and discussed later. The BRIDGE study is described separately reflecting the last CHMP discussion 
before the withdrawal of the indication by the MAH. 
The company initially applied for a PCI and bridge indication as follows :  
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
Kengrexal is a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events 
(including stent thrombosis) in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI). 
During the pre-operative period when oral P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery (‘Bridging’) 
Kengrexal is also indicated to maintain P2Y12 inhibition in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes or in 
patients with stents who are at increased risk for thrombotic events (such as stent thrombosis) when oral 
P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery (‘Bridging’). 
The bridge indication was further withdrawn by the applicant at D180 of the procedure further concerns 
expressed by the Committee described later in the efficacy and safety parts of this report.  Additionally, the 
initially applied PCI indication was further restricted.  
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
2.5.1.1.  Dose response for PCI indication 
The Dose regimen for PCI is a 30µg/kg IV bolus followed by 4 µg/kg/min IV infusion for 2 hours to 4 hours. The 
key study leading to this selection was the Phase I study, TMC-CAN-04-02 (Groups A and B), supported by 
results from the Phase II studies in ACS (SC-931-5058, SC 931 5060) and PCI (SC-931-5129 Part 1, and Part 2)

10% (3/29) at 4 μg/kg/min (table E3). In the PCI setting, the Company decided to take forward as high a dose 
as possible from a tolerability perspective (4 μg/kg/min IV) to minimize residual platelet reactivity in as high a 
percentage of the population as possible.

The rationale for the 4 μg/kg/min IV infusion in the PCI indication is further supported by the output from the PD 
model based on P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) data from TMC-CAN-05-2-S1 and TMC-CAN-08-02, in which a 
higher dose of cangrelor appeared to be required in the PCI population compared to the BRIDGE population 
(Cangrelor Pop PK/PD Model). 
Rationale for IV bolus plus IV infusion regimen in PCI 
In studies SC-931-5058 and SC-931-5129, cangrelor was administered by IV infusion without an initial bolus 
loading dose. This resulted in an onset of action at the earliest time-points assessed (30 minutes in 
SC-931-5058, 15 minutes in SC-931-5129). Consistent with the half-life of cangrelor (3 to 6 minutes), up to 30 
minutes of infusion would be required to achieve steady-state without a loading dose and, in a small number of 
individuals, the half-life was up to 9 minutes. Consequently, for the PCI indication and CHAMPION program, a 
Assessment report

bolus plus infusion regimen was introduced, with the aim of achieving immediate and substantial reduction of 
platelet responsiveness to ADP in the acute interventional setting.  
Study [TMC-CAN-04-02] Groups A and B. After bolus administration, a consistent and complete inhibition of 
platelet responsiveness to ADP, as measured by whole blood impedance aggregometry (WBIA), was achieved 
immediately (within 2 minutes) The inhibition was more complete and consistent throughout the infusion in the 
high dose group. Platelet responsiveness recovered by 50% within 10 to 30 minutes of stopping the infusion, 
with full recovery in most subjects approximately 60 minutes after infusion cessation.  
The profile observed using WBIA in Groups A & B was confirmed using flow cytometry for ADP-induced P-selectin 
expression (figure E1).

BRIDGE [TMC-CAN-08-02] was designed to demonstrate that, after discontinuation of oral P2Y12 inhibitors and 
compared to placebo, cangrelor maintains low levels of platelet reactivity as expected when an oral P2Y12 
inhibitor had not been discontinued up until the time of surgery without increasing surgical bleeding.   
In stage 1 of the study, a cangrelor dose infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/min prior to surgery maintained platelet inhibition 
above 60% in only 76.5% of patient samples and a dose of 0.75 μg/kg/min maintained platelet inhibition above 
60% in 94.4% of patient samples (primary endpoint met). When measuring platelet inhibition during infusion 
according to the Working Group on Platelet Reactivity consensus, 80% of patients in Cohort I and 100% of 
patients in Cohort II had all on-infusion samples <240 PRU during the cangrelor infusion. There were no 
safety-related concerns with cangrelor administration at this dose. A cangrelor dose of 0.75 μg/kg/min was 
selected for further evaluation in the randomized, double-blind phase (Stage II). 
In stage II, the patients were randomized to treatment with either cangrelor or matching IV placebo. 
Double-dummy techniques were used to maintain the double blind. Study drug infusion was initiated 
immediately after randomization (within 72 hours of last dose of oral P2Y12 inhibitor) and maintained throughout 
the pre-operative period for a minimum of 48 hours. Infusion durations of up to 7 days were allowed. Sites were 
instructed to discontinue the infusion 1 to 6 hours prior to surgical incision. Study drug was not administered 
during or after cardiac surgery (figure E2).

2.5.1.2.  Dose response for Bridge indication  
The Dose regimen proposed for the BRIDGE indication was an IV infusion of 0.75 µg/kg/min. This was based on 
the results of the BRIDGE study.  
  Bridge study design  
The BRIDGE [TMC-CAN-08-02] study was designed to demonstrate that, after discontinuation of oral P2Y12 
inhibitors and compared to placebo, cangrelor maintains low levels of platelet reactivity as expected when an 
oral P2Y12 inhibitor had not been discontinued up until the time of surgery without increasing surgical bleeding.   
In stage 1 of the study, a cangrelor dose infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/min prior to surgery maintained platelet inhibition 
above 60% in only 76.5% of patient samples and a dose of 0.75 μg/kg/min maintained platelet inhibition above 
60% in 94.4% of patient samples (primary endpoint met). When measuring platelet inhibition during infusion 
according to the Working Group on Platelet Reactivity consensus, 80% of patients in Cohort I and 100% of 
patients in Cohort II had all on-infusion samples <240 PRU during the cangrelor infusion. There were no 
safety-related concerns with cangrelor administration at this dose. A cangrelor dose of 0.75 μg/kg/min was 
selected for further evaluation in the randomized, double-blind phase (Stage II). 
In stage II, patients were randomized to treatment with either cangrelor or matching IV placebo in a double 
blind fashion. Study drug infusion was initiated immediately after randomization (within 72 hours of last dose of 
oral P2Y12 inhibitor) and maintained throughout the pre-operative period for a minimum of 48 hours. Infusion 
durations of up to 7 days were allowed. Sites were instructed to discontinue the infusion 1 to 6 hours prior to 
surgical incision. Study drug was not administered during or after cardiac surgery (figure E2). 
Figure E2: Stage II study design 
CABG = coronary artery bypass graft. PRU = P2Y12 Reaction Unit(s). kg = kilograms. min = minutes. µg = micrograms. 
In Stage II, 44 of 93 (47.3%) patients in the cangrelor group presented with ACS versus 54 of 90 (60%) 
patients in the placebo group. In the cangrelor group, 49 of 93 (52.7%) presented with stents while 36 of 90 
(40%) in the placebo group had stents. Overall, approximately 13.5% of patients enrolled were STEMI patients. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (Stage II) was the percentage of patients with all samples during the infusion 
achieving P2Y12 Reaction Unit (PRU) <240, as determined by VerifyNow™ P2Y12 test, measured during study 
drug infusion pre-surgery. This endpoint was selected as it is considered by consensus of the Working Group on 
Platelet Reactivity to be the threshold for the level of platelet inhibition required to maintain a low risk of 
coronary thrombosis and cardiac ischaemic events [Bonello et al, 2010]. No clinical study has correlated specific 
values of platelet inhibition by any one assay to thrombotic events and qualitative test results cannot be used to 
“fine-tune” inhibition. However, cutoff levels for various assays of platelet reactivity associated with increased 
clinical risk were suggested [Bonello et al, 2010; Tantry et al 2013]. The most important information obtained 
from assays measuring platelet function might be whether the assay can provide evidence of P2Y12 inhibition 
with a high degree of specificity and selectivity. The VerifyNow™ P2Y12 test at a cutoff of 230 PRU has 
Assessment report

demonstrated an 87% sensitivity and an 88% specificity for the presence of P2Y12 inhibition [Dahlen et al, 
2012]. The VerifyNow™P2Y12 test is known to be well correlated with maximal light transmittance 
aggregometry with oral P2Y12 inhibitors clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor [Jeong 2008; Malinin 2007, von 
Beckerath 2006, Jakubowski 2008]  
  Bridge study results  
The primary efficacy endpoint was met in 98.8% of cangrelor-treated patients maintaining target levels of 
platelet inhibition (<240 PRU) for all time points measured over the bridging period compared to 19.0% of 
placebo patients (relative risk [RR], 5.2 [95% CI, 3.3-8.1] p <0.001) (Table E4).

After discontinuation of the infusion (1 to 6 hours before surgery), platelet function prior to surgery was similar 
for cangrelor and placebo groups (p=0.212). This rapid return of platelet function is consistent with the short 
half-life of cangrelor (3 to 6 min). Platelet reactivity during the overall study time course is illustrated in Figure 
E3.

2.5.1.3.  Discussion on Dose and Efficacy of the BRIDGING indication 
The BRIDGE study was submitted to support both the dose for the bridging indication, as well as the indication 
itself. The study was conducted in two phases: a dose finding phase with dosages up to 1.5 µg/kg/min in which 
the  dose  of  0.75  µg/kg/min  was  selected  for  further  assessment  in  stage  II.  Administration  of  this  dose  is 
associated with 100% on-infusion samples <240 PRU, with no significant bleeding events. The choice of a cut off 
of <240 PRU to assess optimal dose is supported by adequate references, and is defendable. No patients were 
administered the highest dose of 1.5 µg/kg/min as the endpoint was reached by the previous dose.  
The choice of the same endpoint as an efficacy parameter is however not supported. This is a PD parameter that 
can  inform  about  efficacy,  but  cannot  substitute  for  it.  The  results  of  the  second  phase  shows  a  significant 
difference in this parameter between patients who were bridged from clopidogrel to cangrelor, compared to 
bridging from clopidogrel to placebo.  This should have been further confirmed using efficacy parameters such 
as: death, MI, stroke, stent thrombosis, without tipping the balance by more bleeding. In addition, the chosen 
dose itself (0.75 µg/kg/min) is much lower than that used in the PCI indication during infusion (4 µg/kg/min), 
questioning if such a dose would offer adequate protection against major cardiovascular outcomes during the 
bridging period. The proposed dose of 0.75 ug/kg/min is shown to be associated with a low residual platelet 
reactivity of < 240 PRU, which is even lower than  that achieved with maintenance doses of clopidogrel and 
comparable to that of ticagrelor and prasugrel.  
It is acknowledged that doses of antithrombotics in different indications are based on PD data, but confirmation 
in clinical efficacy and safety data is necessary as direct extrapolation of efficacy and safety is not possible. It can 
therefore be agreed that the dose in a bridging period could be smaller than that used during PCI, but the exact 
dose  should  be  further  verified  by  clinical  data.  There  is  no  actual  clinical  experience  with  bridging  from 
ticagrelor or prasugrel to cangrelor. Maintenance of adequate platelet inhibition depends on the PK/PD profile of 
the oral P2Y12 inhibitor. Regarding the duration of infusion, the actual experience in the BRIDGE study includes 
one patient with the longest administration of 6.7 days. With the relatively low dose investigated in BRIDGE 
study, the total exposure is smaller than encountered in the CHAMPION studies.

The CHAMPION trials were three randomized (1:1), double-blind, double-dummy trials designed to test whether 
cangrelor IV (30 µg/kg bolus, 4 µg/kg/min infusion for 2 to 4 hours) at the time of PCI followed by transition to 
oral clopidogrel is superior to oral clopidogrel therapy alone at reducing thrombotic events during and 
immediately after PCI. The three Phase III CHAMPION trials were very similar in design as shown in Figure E4.  
Figure E4: 
The CHAMPION study designs 
SA = stable angina. NSTE-ACS = non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. STEMI = ST-segment elevation 
myocardial infarction. PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention. mg = milligrams. mITT = modified intent-to-treat. 
CHAMPION PLATFORM and CHAMPION PCI (implemented 2006 to 2009) were terminated early following 
the  PLATFORM  70%  interim  analysis,  due  to  a  low  likelihood  of  reaching  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  per 
pre-specified  stopping  rules.  No  safety  issues  were  identified  that  contributed  to  the  decision  of  study 
discontinuation. However available results showed some efficacy for cangrelor, which led to the hypothesis that 
the definition of MI was not specific enough to discriminate between MI that was already developing before and 
those during PCI. 
CHAMPION PHOENIX (implemented from 2010 to 2013) applied the contemporary endpoint definitions for MI 
and ST that had not been published at the time of CHAMPION PCI and CHAMPION PLATFORM study design. 
The current AR focuses on the C-PHOENIX study, as it is the only completed phase III study that has achieved 
its primary objective. Differences in design (timing of clopidogrel administration) and endpoints (definitions of 
MI and stent thrombosis) between these studies are pointed out as appropriate.

platelet inhibition. 
Methods  
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 47/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The main methods are described above. 
Study Participants 
The main inclusion criteria for the C-PHOENIX was patients undergoing PCI for: 
a.  Stable  angina  (SA)  with  diagnostic  coronary  angiography  within  90  days  prior  to  randomization 
demonstrating atherosclerosis. 
b.  Non-ST-Segment  Elevation  Acute  Coronary  Syndrome  (NSTE-ACS)  with  diagnostic  coronary  angiography 
within 72 hours prior to randomization demonstrating atherosclerosis. 
c. ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) patients (diagnostic angiography not required). 
C-PLATFORM recruited mainly patients requiring PCI for either NSTEMI or unstable angina (UA). C-PCI recruited 
both NSTEMI and STEMI.  
The  exclusion  criteria  included  prior  stroke  (ischaemic  or  haemorrhagic).  In  addition,  C-PHOENIX  excluded 
patients who were administered any P2Y12 inhibitor at any time in the 7 days preceding randomisation. 
Treatments 
Cangrelor IV was administered as a 30 µg/kg IV bolus followed immediately by a 4 µg /kg/min IV infusion. 
Cangrelor infusion had to be continued for at least 2 hours or until the end of the index PCI procedure, whichever 
was longer. Patients were administered a transition dose of 600 mg clopidogrel following the discontinuation of 
the infusion. The active comparator in the CHAMPION program was clopidogrel. 
A loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg or 300 mg) was the control therapy in the CHAMPION programme. In 
C-PHOENIX, either dose was allowed, per investigator discretion. In the C-PCI and C-PLATFORM trials, 
clopidogrel loading dose of 600 mg administered either immediately before (C-PCI) or after (C-PLATFORM) PCI, 
respectively. 
Timing of administration. In the CHAMPION programme, the timing of treatment with P2Y12 inhibition was 
dependent on first delineating coronary anatomy through diagnostic angiography and confirming suitability for 
PCI. An initial diagnostic angiogram was required for all except STEMI patients in the trial population.  
Outcomes/endpoints: 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  C-PHOENIX  was  a  composite  incidence  of  all-cause  mortality,  MI, 
ischaemia-driven  revascularization  (IDR)  and  stent  thrombosis  (ST)  in  the  48  hours  after  randomization. 
Incidence  of  stent  thrombosis  at  48  hours  post-randomization  was  a  key  secondary  endpoint.  The  other 
CHAMPION studies did not include ST in the primary composite endpoint. In all three of the CHAMPION trials, ST, 
IDR, and MI were adjudicated by an independent CEC through 30 days after randomization. Mortality was also 
adjudicated for cardiovascular cause of death in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial. 
Myocardial  infarction:  The  PHOENIX  trial  was  designed  with  these  criteria  to  avoid  confounding 
peri-procedural MIs with evolving pre-procedural MIs in patients with elevated biomarkers, based on previous 
experience with the earlier CHAMPION trials. The definition of peri-procedural MI in the PHOENIX trial required 
assessment of patients’ baseline biomarker status. In patients with elevated biomarkers at presentation, only 
MIs that could clearly be discerned as a complication of the PCI, according to the Universal Definition of MI 
(UDMI), were included as PCI-related MI endpoints.  
Specifically to assess PCI-related MI (Type 4a), this definition requires assessment of patients’ baseline status 
that was determined based on a combination of troponin samples as well as  ischaemic symptoms and  ECG 
changes to be baseline normal, abnormal, or unknown. For patients with normal baseline status, MI after PCI is

easy to measure (defined as a creatine phosphokinase - myocardial band [CK-MB] mass ≥3 × upper limit of 
normal  [ULN]).  For  patients  determined  to  be  baseline  abnormal  (ie,  baseline  MI  confirmed  or  cannot  be 
excluded),  more  restrictive  criteria  to  define  MI  after  PCI  are  required  (defined  by  a  combination  of  CKMB 
re-elevation  with  supportive  evidence  of  ischaemia  including  ECG  changes,  angiographic  evidence,  and 
ischaemic symptoms) [Brener et al, 2013].  
Patients determined to have STEMI at baseline (including patients with normal baseline cardiac markers who 
were confirmed by CEC adjudication to have baseline STEMI ECG) were not reviewed by the CEC for 
peri-procedural MI. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized via IV/WRS in the order that they qualified. Patient randomization was stratified by 
study site, planned clopidogrel loading dose in the clopidogrel treatment arm (600 mg or 300 mg), and patient 
baseline status (normal ischemic status, abnormal ischemic status) among other factors. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
Placebo in IV and oral form and double-dummy techniques were employed to ensure study blinding. 
Statistical Methods 
Determination of Sample Size The composite event rate was assumed to be 5.1% in the clopidogrel arm and 
3.9%  in  the  cangrelor  arm  (24.5%  reduction  in  odds  ratio)  based  on  results  from  the  CHAMPION  PCI  and 
PLATFORM  studies.  This  assumption  took  into  consideration  that  the  interim  efficacy  analysis  was  to  be 
performed after 70% of patients had completed 48-hour follow-up and event adjudication, using Gamma family 
alpha  spending  function  (with  gamma  =  -5).  A  sample  size  of  approximately  5,450  patients  in  each  arm 
(approximately 10,900 in total) was considered to provide a power of 85% to detect this estimated difference at 
the two-sided overall Type I error of 0.05. 
The primary analysis is adjusted for baseline patient status, one of the three stratification factors. If more that 
15% of the patients were designated to receive a loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel, then the analysis was also 
adjusted for designated loading dose. According to the Applicant the primary analysis was not adjusted for the 
stratification  factor  study  site  because  of  the  large  number  of  sites,  as  adjustment  would  lead  to  statistical 
inefficiency due to  many “zero cell” strata. Exploratory subgroup analyses comparing top enrolling sites with 
other sites did not indicate a significant interaction, and a post-hoc analysis that did adjust for study site did not 
change the effect on the primary efficacy endpoint. For the same reason, the Applicant would not adjust for 
stratification factor designated loading dose unless at least 15% of patients had a clopidogrel loading dose of 
300 mg. As this was the case, the final SAP was updated accordingly before database lock and the primary 
analysis was adjusted for this stratification factor. 
Interim  analysis  One  interim  efficacy  analysis  was  planned  for  the  purpose  of  overwhelming  efficacy  and 
sample size re-estimation after approximately 70% of the enrolled patients had undergone adjudication of the 
48-hour primary composite endpoint. 
Populations The ITT population was used to summarize patient disposition. The primary efficacy analysis was 
based on the mITT population with supportive analyses in the ITT and PP populations. All safety analyses were 
performed on the Safety population. 
Efficacy  analysis  A  logistic  regression  model  adjusted  for  baseline  patient  ischemic  status  (normal  vs 
abnormal) and intended clopidogrel loading dose designated by investigators at randomization (600 vs 300 mg) 
was  used  to  analyze  the  primary  endpoint.  As  sensitivity  analysis,  logistic  regression  without  baseline 
adjustment  was  also  performed.  Adjustment  for  additional  risk  factors  was  explored  through  multivariate

logistic  regression.  Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  Hierarchical  fixed 
sequence testing methodology was applied to test the key secondary endpoint (ST) and other components of the 
primary composite endpoints.  
  Study results 
 Participant flow in C-PHOENIX 
A total of 11,145 patients were enrolled into the trial and were randomized (Figure E5).  No patients in the 
randomized  population  were  excluded  from  the  ITT  population.  Among  those  in  the  ITT  population,  109 
patients in the cangrelor arm and 94 patients in the placebo arm did not receive study drug or did not undergo 
the index PCI procedure and were therefore excluded from the mITT population.  Within each of these analysis 
populations, at least 99.9% of patients in both treatment arms completed the 48-hour time point, and at least 
99.7% of patients in both treatment groups were considered to have completed the study at 30 days.

Table E5: Patient demographic and other baseline characteristics (ITT population) 
Major deviations from the study protocol were limited and comparable between the study treatment arms. The 
presented baseline data of the recruited patients are in line with the studied population in clinical practice; with 
the majority of males (72%), and a good representation of patients above 65 years (48%). However, the 
majority were indicated for elective PCI (55%); with only around 19% of the patients indicated for PCI with 
STEMI.  
A total of 4347/10,942 (39.7%) subjects were enrolled in Europe, with 2172 (39.7%) in the cangrelor arm and 
2175 (39.8%) in the clopidogrel arm. This percentage would adequately reflect EU practice in the clinical trial. 
The associated comorbidities are also reflective of patients with CAD. According to the protocol, patients had to 
be P2Y12 naïve, or discontinued P2Y12 for 7 days prior to randomisation. This advice appears at odds with the 
recruited population, who has previous history of MI/PCI/CABG in almost one third of them. The applicant 
explained that precise data on recruited patients who may have been candidates for dual antiplatelet therapy is 
not available. Presented data for patients with previous PCI/MI within 30 days who are candidates for such 
therapy shows that they were very limitedly recruited (1%). It can be agreed with the company that patients 
with previous MI/PCI were only included in the trial after they had already completed their 
guidelines-recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy.

Although the protocol excludes patients with prior history of stroke, around 5% of the patients are reported to 
have had cerebrovascular accidents. The applicant explained that the exclusion criteria were ischemic stroke 
within the last year or any previous haemorrhagic stroke. However, the CRF did not capture the type of stroke 
or its timing. Therefore, it should be assumed that all of these other past events were either ischaemic occurring 
>1 year prior to randomisation or, when occurring within 30 days of randomisation, were an event such as a TIA 
that did not meet the exclusion criteria.  
Table E6: Medical history (ITT population) 
Characteristics of the index PCI are summarized in table E7. CABG was performed as the index procedure for 
only 0.3% of cangrelor-treated patients and 0.2% of clopidogrel-treated patients during the trial, most often 
due to the patient’s coronary anatomy being evaluated as unsuitable for PCI (11/19 cangrelor patients, 4/9 
clopidogrel).

Concomitant Medications 
Prior  medications.  Nearly  all  patients  were  reported  to  be  treated  with  aspirin  (95%  cangrelor-treated 
patients, 94% clopidogrel-treated patients). Unfractionated heparin was the next most common concomitant 
anticoagulant medication administered (78% of patients for both treatment arms) followed by bivalirudin (23% 
for both treatment arms).  
Periprocedural  GP  IIb/IIIa  inhibitor  administration  for  use  as  bailout  was  reported  for  129/5581  (2.3%) 
cangrelor patients, and for 194/5564 (3.5%) clopidogrel patients. The numerical increase in GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor 
bailout  for  clopidogrel-treated  patients  suggests  numerically  fewer  procedural  complications  leading  to  GP 
IIb/IIIa inhibitor bailout occurred in the cangrelor treatment arm.  
Post-procedural concomitant medications were balanced between treatment groups, with nearly all patients 
(97% in each treatment group) received clopidogrel 75 mg for 48 hours post-PCI and  the majority of patients 
(79% in both groups) received post-procedural aspirin. 
At  discharge,  nearly  all  patients  were  receiving  aspirin  (99%  in  both  groups)  and  long-term  maintenance 
clopidogrel therapy (96% in both groups). Prasugrel was administered to 1.5% of cangrelor-treated patients 
and 1.6% of clopidogrel-treated patients, and ticagrelor was administered to 0.4% of patients in both treatment 
groups, among other therapeutic options reported by investigators. 
There is a comparable use of prior medications. Most of the patients were co-administered ASA. A slightly higher 
increase of peri-procedural GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use is recorded in the clopidogrel arm. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The composite incidence of death/MI/IDR/stent thrombosis among mITT patients was 4.7% in the cangrelor 
treatment arm and 5.9% in the clopidogrel treatment arm. For adjusted analysis using logistic regression to 
control for the potential confounding factors of patient baseline status and clopidogrel loading dose, OR: 0.78 
(95% CI: 0.66, 0.93), p=0.005; for unadjusted analysis, OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.93), p=0.006 (table E8).

Secondary  endpoints.  Analysis  of  the  individual  incidence  of  the  components  of  the  primary  efficacy 
composite endpoint and related secondary endpoints demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of MI 
between cangrelor-treated patients (3.8%) and clopidogrel-treated patients (4.7%), with OR 0.80, 95% CI: 
0.67, 0.97; p=0.022, in addition to the significantly lower incidence of stent thrombosis for cangrelor-treated 
patients (Table E11). Numerical differences between treatment groups for Q-wave MI and IDR were consistent

with these results. The incidence of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death was the same (0.3%) between 
treatment groups, with all deaths adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths (Table E9).

 A) Subgroup analyses 
A number of subgroup analyses at 48hours and at D30 were performed by the applicant or requested during the 
assessment. There are presented below.  
Cangrelor efficacy was demonstrated in subgroup analysis among patients presenting with SA, NSTE-ACS, and 
STEMI, and among patients with either 600 mg or 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose, or clopidogrel loading before 
or  after  PCI  start  (Figure  E6).  Of  note,  medical  history  of  peripheral  artery  disease  showed  a  statistically 
significant  interaction  with  cangrelor  (p=0.003)  without  adjustment  for  multiplicity  although  cangrelor’s 
protective effect remained evident in both groups (with or without PAD history).

Clopidogrel dose. A total 74% patients were assigned a 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose by investigators at 
randomization. In this subgroup, the composite incidence of the primary endpoint was significantly reduced in 
patients who received cangrelor compared with patients receiving clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose (4.3% vs. 
5.6%; OR: 0.77; CI: 0.63,0.94; p=0.009)(Table E10).

One patient in the cangrelor arm and two in the clopidogrel arm had both ARC ST and IPST.  
Note: 3 patients have no efficacy data at 48 h.  
Further analysis of C-PHOENIX shows that efficacy outcomes are significantly worse in patients with IPST at 30 
days (Table E12), which could support their importance.

For MI, using a higher threshold of post-PCI elevation of CK-MB of ≥ 10xULN, the results show the superiority of 
cangrelor (0.7%) over clopidogrel (1.1%) (table E13). These results are reassuring, although the absolute 
difference is quite small.

against clopidogrel (2.9%) [OR:0.65 (0.51- 0.83); p <0.0007].  
Ancillary Analysis 
The incidence of the 30-day composite efficacy endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI, IDR or stent 
thrombosis remained significantly lower among cangrelor-treated patients (6%) than clopidogrel-treated 
patients (7%; OR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.99; p=0.035)(table E15). By protocol, patients were to be treated with 
maintenance P2Y12 inhibition on the morning after the index PCI procedure and through 30 days, and most mITT 
patients (96.5% in the cangrelor treatment arm, and 96.6% in the clopidogrel treatment arm) were discharged 
with clopidogrel as P2Y12 inhibition therapy.

Subgroup analysis. Analysis of the primary endpoint in different subgroups showed general consistency in 
benefits as observed with the main cohort. There was interaction only for patients with history of peripheral 
artery disease (PAD)(p=0.003) with cangrelor showing more benefits in these patients. The Forest plot shows 
that the superiority is mainly driven by the results of the subgroup of stable CAD, while the subgroup of STEMI 
showed non-significant results, but in the same direction of the main cohort (OR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.46- 1.25). 
Even when combining STEMI/NSTEMI and increasing the database (table E16), the results are still not 
significant, though favouring cangrelor.

Ancillary Analysis. Generally the beneficial results of primary composite endpoint observed at 48 hours, were 
maintained at 30 days. There were significantly lower incidences of MI and stent thrombosis in the cangrelor 
group. However, there is a slight numerical increase in the reported CV deaths in the cangrelor group (0.9%; 
48/5462) compared to the clopidogrel group (0.8%; 46/5457; RR:1.04 95% CI:0.69-1.57). It is acknowledged 
that the observed difference in mortality at 30 days is not significant and the incidence is comparable. Longer 
term results (1 year) are available from the 2 other CHAMPION studies, which show better mortality results for 
cangrelor (3.3%) vs clopidogrel (3.7%). This is reassuring. The most frequent causes of death according to the 
study report (table E18) are reported as follows:

term, sorted by frequency (safety population)

The most frequent Death related events (cardiogenic shock and MI) are described below:  
Cardiogenic shock  
A total of nine deaths were reported under cardiogenic shock in PHOENIX. Of these the majority (six patients) 
presented to the hospital with STEMI. The remainder included one patient with NSTE-ACS and two with stable 
angina. The medical history in all nine of these patients was typical of patients with coronary artery disease. Of 
the six patients with STEMI, four were from the same site in Russia. All had risk factors for cardiogenic shock 
including female gender, a medical history of hypertension and a presentation with STEMI. Two of the 4 patients 
had a history of prior MI or prior PCI, and one patient had a history of insulin dependent diabetes.  
One patient who was admitted with NSTE-ACS and underwent PCI of the left anterior descending artery 
developed dyspnoea followed by rapid progression to pulmonary oedema. The patient died from cardiogenic 
shock two days after presentation.  
Of the two patients with stable angina, one subject was a 62 year old female who suffered a coronary artery 
perforation of the left anterior descending artery during the PCI resulting in ACUITY Major/GUSTO moderate 
bleeding and a myocardial infarction. The coronary artery perforation was a procedural complication secondary 
to a guidewire that led to cardiac tamponade, bradycardia and respiratory arrest. The cardiac tamponade may 
have been exacerbated by treatment with cangrelor. She died three days after the PCI.  
Another SA patient was 55 year old female who suffered a stent thrombosis after PCI, requiring an IDR and 
resulting in an MI. She died within 48 hours of the PCI. 
Myocardial Infarction 
A total of eight deaths were reported under myocardial infarction in PHOENIX. Of these, three patients presented 
to the hospital with STEMI, two with NSTE-ACS and three with stable angina. The medical history in all eight of 
these patients was typical of patients with coronary artery disease.  
Four patients had stent thrombosis between 48 hours and 30 days and subsequently died. One subject was a 46 
year old female who underwent PCI for stable angina. After stent placement she experienced abrupt closure with 
severe spasm which would not resolve, resulting in ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest and death. The patient 
died in the catheterisation laboratory. 
Another patient was an 81 year old male with NSTE-ACS. His medical history included hypertension, prior 
history of smoking, and family history of coronary artery disease. Nine days after discharge from hospital the 
patient died due to sudden cardiac death and MI, as reported from an autopsy result. 
Of the bleeding events that occurred, 2 patients had a ≥  5cm haematoma, which may have been associated with 
cangrelor treatment but are not known to be clinically correlated with adverse outcomes. 
In conclusion, cangrelor may have contributed to the events of cardiac tamponade subsequent to coronary 
artery perforation and retroperitoneal haematoma resulting in cardiogenic shock and death. Cangrelor may also 
have contributed to the events of ≥ 5cm haematoma but it is unlikely these events were associated with the 
subsequent myocardial infarction and death in these patients. 
Table E19 presents the 48 hrs and 30 days deaths for the different PCI subgroups. The differences whether 
favouring cangrelor in ACS in 48 hours, or favouring clopidogrel in the same group at 30 days are very marginal. 
In conclusion the CHMP considered that the numbers are too limited and it is difficult to draw robust conclusions.

Analysis performed across trials 
The applicant presented data from the CHAMPION pooled efficacy analysis (N=24,910 mITT) to further support 
efficacy of C-PHOENIX. The MI component for the integrated efficacy analysis of the CHAMPION trials included, 
MI as defined per protocol in CHAMPION PHOENIX and, as ascertained retrospectively from CHAMPION 
PLATFORM and CHAMPION PCI using the UDMI definition based on adjudicated results. The PCI population (ITT) 
studied in the CHAMPION trials covered the spectrum of CAD including SA (31%), NSTE-ACS (57%), and STEMI 
(12%). At baseline, 50% of the CHAMPION Pooled patient population had at least one troponin sample >ULN 
suggesting an MI was ongoing or resolving before the PCI. The mean age was 63 years: 45% of patients were 
≥65 years old, most were male (72%) and white (86%). Comorbidities common among patients with CAD, at 
frequencies typical of a general PCI population, were observed. Overall, 30% of patients presented with diabetes 
mellitus, 76% had a history of hypertension, and 65% of hyperlipidemia, and 23% had a history of previous MI. 
Twenty-three percent (23%) of patients had a history of previous PCI/stent and 12% were being treated with 
oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy prior to PCI. 
Two formal interim analyses were conducted in both trials. The first interim review was conducted by the Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) when approximately 50% of subjects were enrolled and included a 
stopping rule for both efficacy and futility. The second interim review was conducted when approximately 70% 
of patients were enrolled and included additional rules for adaptation of the study that included sample size 
re-estimation and enrichment, as defined in the Interim Analysis Review Committee (IARC) charter.

Demographic and baseline characteristics observed within the individual CHAMPION trials were similar to those 
observed in the pooled population. The proportion of SA patients (56%) was higher in the CHAMPION PHOENIX 
[TMC-CAN-10-01] trial compared to the CHAMPION Pooled population. 
Results.  A  significant  19%  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  death/MI/IDR/ST  at  48  hours  was  also  observed,

The BRIDGE study was designed to demonstrate that cangrelor can maintain a low level of platelet reactivity 
without increasing the bleeding risk, when oral P2Y12 inhibitors have to be discontinued prior to surgery. 
In the cangrelor group, 44 of 93 (47.3%) patients presented with ACS versus 54 of 90 (60%) patients in the 
placebo group. In the cangrelor group, 49 of 93 (52.7%) presented with stents while 36 of 90 (40%) in the 
placebo group had stents. Overall, approximately 13.5% of patients enrolled were STEMI patients. 
In  this  study,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  met  with  98.8%  of  cangrelor-treated  patients  maintaining 
target levels of platelet inhibition (<240 PRU, as determined by VerifyNow™ P2Y12 test) for all time points 
measured over the bridging period compared to 19.0% of placebo patients (relative risk [RR], 5.2 [95% CI, 
3.3-8.1] p <0.001). 
The chosen dose is much lower than that recommended for the PCI indication (30 µg bolus+ 4 µg/kg/min). 
However, the currently proposed dose (0.75 µg/kg/min) is not adequately defined.  
The choice of a PD parameter as primary endpoint to support efficacy in the BRIDGING indication is not 
accepted by the CHMP. Inhibition of platelet aggregation is a relevant parameter but can not substitute for 
clinical data indicating thrombosis like myocardial infarction. This point is even more critical considering the low 
dose used. 
BRIDGING data from ticagrelor and prasugrel are missing; in the BRIDGE study patients were mainly on 
clopidogrel.  
Clinical efficacy in PCI indication: 
The three CHAMPION studies are submitted to support the indication of PCI. Both C-PCI and C-PLATFORM are 
incomplete studies, prematurely terminated due to the low likelihood of achieving their primary aim (superiority 
of cangrelor to clopidogrel). The discussion will mainly focus on C- PHOENIX, the only complete study which has 
achieved its primary objective.  
Design of clinical studies 
The C-PHOENIX recruited the three categories indicated for PCI (stable CAD, STEMI and NSTEMI). This is not an 
optimal design considering the different risk factors and thrombotic risk in the chronic (stable CAD) versus the 
acute setting (STEMI/NSTEMI), in addition to the difference in the standard of care. The exclusion of patients 
with prior stroke limits the external validity of the study, and this is reflected in the SmPC (section 4.3). 
Choice of active comparator 
The choice of clopidogrel as the only active comparator across the different indications for PCI is debatable. 
According to the relevant ESC guidelines, either ticagrelor or prasugrel are the preferred agents because of their 
superior efficacy to clopidogrel. Clopidogrel should only be used when these agents are not available. However, 
it can be agreed, based on utilization data, that clopidogrel is still currently used for PCI in EU across the different 
subgroups. In addition, clinical guideline differ regarding the preference of prasugrel/ticagrelor over clopidogrel 
in the acute PCI setting: the American guidelines give no preference, whereas the ESC favours 
prasugrel/clopidogrel. Specifically ticagrelor was not available at the time of initiation of C-PHOENIX. 
Accordingly, the CHMP questioned, whether clopidogrel was a valid comparator in the acute setting and this 
issue was discussed with the CV SAG experts. (see later) 
Dose of and timing clopidogrel used in the study 
Regarding the chosen clopidogrel dose, it can be agreed with the MAH that the current EU SmPC recommends 
a loading dose of 300 mg. However, as already mentioned in most recent guidelines the superior efficacy of the 
600 mg is acknowledged. For example, 600 mg loading dose/150 mg maintenance dose in the first week was 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 66/113 
 
  
  
superior to the 300/75 mg regimen in the subset of patients undergoing PCI in (OASIS) 7 trial (Mehta et al., 
2010). High clopidogrel loading doses have been demonstrated to achieve more rapid inhibition of the ADP 
receptor. Likewise, in PCI for NSTEMI, 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel (or a supplementary 300-mg dose at 
PCI following an initial 300-mg loading dose) is recommended for patients scheduled for an invasive strategy. 
The results comparing cangrelor to 600 mg clopidogrel are therefore more relevant. In comparison, all patients 
in the cangrelor arm received 600 mg clopidogrel directly following the cangrelor infusion. The possible 
disadvantages for the clopidogrel arm with the chosen dose and time of initiation was further addressed by the 
applicant. Analyses by dose show comparable results, with even better results when the 600 mg dose is used 
(table E22).

Significant results for the primary endpoint in favour of cangrelor were shown against the clopidogrel 600 mg 
loading dose [cangrelor (4.3%) vs clopidogrel (5.6%) OR: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.94)]; but not against the 
clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose  [cangrelor (5.8%) vs clopidogrel (6.8%) OR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62,  1.14)]. 
Significant  results  were  shown  when  clopidogrel  was  administered  before  PCI  start  [cangrelor  (4.8%)  vs 
clopidogrel  (6.0%)  OR:  0.80  (95%  CI:  0.64,  0.98)]  but  not  when  administered  after  PCI  start,  but  with 
consistent effect on the OR [cangrelor (4.3%) vs clopidogrel (5.4%). OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.06)]. 
The switch dose in the cangrelor arm was consistently 600 mg, which may have favoured the results in this arm. 
However, the applicant explained that most of the events occurred before this dose was given (90% of the 
events occurred during the first 2 hours after randomisation).  
Regarding the possible influence of time of clopidogrel administration, most of the patients were administered 
clopidogrel before PCI (63.4%), with less than a third administered it during PCI (36.5%), and almost none after 
PCI (0.1%). These data compare favourably with those from TRITON-38 where clopidogrel was administered 
mostly during PCI (74%).  
The results presented by time of clopidogrel administration (table E23) show that superiority of cangrelor is not 
dependent on the timing of clopidogrel administration. Further analysis show that clopidogrel efficacy in 
C-PHOENIX is not compromised by later administration. These data are reassuring.

Further analysis of the dose and time of initiation of clopidogrel was submitted.  
The timing of clopidogrel administration in relation to PCI by patient type is represented in table E16. In the 
acute situations clopidogrel was mostly administered before or during PCI; while in the stable angina subgroup, 
it was almost equally divided between before and during PCI. The results generally do not point to any trend 
regarding later administration of clopidogrel, which would have biased the results favouring cangrelor. In 
addition, considering the time of onset of action of clopidogrel (2-4 hours), it should be administered well 
upfront of the PCI which may not always be possible in the acute setting.  The SAG experts were also invited to 
comment on the dose and timing of clopidogrel administration.

Efficacy Endpoints.  
The definitions used for the endpoints are overall acceptable. The endpoints were adjudicated, which is 
important for endpoints like IDR. The MI definition is in line with the third universal definition of MI.  
The prognostic value of the type 4a MI definition is, however, contested in medical literature. Peri-procedural 
myocardial injury or infarction may occur at some stages in the instrumentation of the heart that is required 
during mechanical revascularization procedures, manifesting as elevated cTn values. 
C- PHOENIX used a threshold of 3x ULN elevation in CK-MB to diagnose a new Type 4a MI, based on the available 
literature at the time. The "Third universal definition of MI" (Thygesen et al., 2012) proposed an arbitrary 
definition of elevation of cTn values >5 x 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values or a rise of 
cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated. This is in addition to symptomatic, new ECG, angiographic 
or imagining evidence of new MI. However, the prognostic value of such parameters is debated in an Expert 
consensus document supporting a higher threshold of post-PCI elevation of CK-MB of ≥ 10xULN.

Page 68/113 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, the inclusion of stent thrombosis as a separate component of the primary composite endpoint with 
other clinical outcome measures is debatable. In the older CHAMPION studies, it was assessed only in patients 
with IDR, which appears to be the more appropriate approach. Furthermore, there is limited regulatory 
experience with investigating ST as a part of the primary endpoint, (eg, registration studies: PLATO, TIMI-38 or 
HORIZONS-AMI). In ATLAS-ACS, stent thrombosis was analyzed retrospectively. Furthermore, the ARC 
document addressing clinical trial endpoints did not propose inclusion of ST in the primary composite endpoints 
(Cutlip et al., 2007). 
The applicant clarified that the protocol-defined ST comprised 2 entities: ARC ST (definite) and intraprocedural 
stent thrombosis IPST. The current duration of 48 hours covers the acute period (0-24 hours), but not the 
subacute period (>24 hours to 30 days), during which ST has a more prognostic value (Heestermans et al. J 
Thromb Haemost 2010; 8: 2385–93).  
There is limited experienced with IPST in clinical literature. However, 2 recent publications adequately describe 
the prognostic value of IPST, even if resolved within the procedure (Brener et al 2013 and Xu et al. 2013), which 
supports the collection of such data. However till further evidence is established about the clinical relevance of 
IPST, it would be preferable to address them separately from ST. 
In the relevant EMA guideline [Point to Consider on the clinical investigation of new medicinal products for the 
treatment of acute coronary syndrome without persistent ST segment elevation (CPWP/EWP/570/98)], the 
recommended endpoint is a composite of death and MI. If refractory angina is added to the composite it should 
be very strictly defined. Neither IDR nor ST were components of the primary endpoints in the PLATO, 
TRITON–TIMI 38 or HORIZONS-AMI investigating the use of ticagrelor prasugrel or bivaliurdin respectively in 
PCI. These studies used the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, or stroke (and revascularisation in 
HORIZONS-AMI).  
Additionally, the applicant explained that stroke was excluded as the trial duration was only 48 hours; a period 
where stroke was not expected to contribute to the outcome. This argumentation is not totally supported, as the 
duration of the study is considered too short in the first place to capture all events that can be temporally 
attributed to the administration of cangrelor.  The SAG discussed further the clinical relevance of the 
investigated endpoints, see later. 
Statistical methods and sample size 
The statistical methods and sample size are considered acceptable. The primary analysis was based on the mITT 
population, with supportive analyses on the ITT and PP population. Definitions of the analysis sets are 
considered acceptable. 
Results.  
Major deviations from the study protocol were limited and comparable between the study treatment arms. The 
recruited patients are in line with the studied population in clinical practice. However, the majority were 
indicated for elective PCI (55%); with only around 19% of the patients indicated for PCI with STEMI. This is quite 
limited considering that this is expected to be the main target population.  
According to the protocol, patients had to be P2Y12 naïve, or discontinued P2Y12 for 7 days prior to 
randomisation. Presented data for patients with previous PCI/MI within 30 days who are candidates for such 
therapy shows that they were very limitedly recruited (1%). It can be agreed with the company that patients 
with previous MI/PCI were only included in the trial after they had already completed their 
guidelines-recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy.  
Regarding experience in emergency situations of ACS where patients are already on oral P2Y12 and cangrelor 
has to be given, the applicant referred to C-PCI data, where patients on P2Y12 inhibition therapy where included.

Efficacy results show superiority of cangrelor over clopidogrel in the primary efficacy endpoint measuring the 
composite of death, MI, IDR, and stent thrombosis at 48 hours.  (4.7% versus 5.9%). Using logistic regression 
to control for the potential confounding factors of patient baseline status and clopidogrel loading dose in the 
adjusted analysis was OR: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.93), p=0.005; and in the unadjusted analysis, OR: 0.79 (95% 
CI: 0.67, 0.93), p=0.006. 
Benefits were shown for the subgroups of stable angina SA, STEMI and NSTEMI but significance was only shown 
for the SA subgroup [cangrelor (5.8%) vs clopidogrel (7.4%) OR: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.95); STEMI: cangrelor 
(2.8%) vs clopidogrel (3.7%) OR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.25) and NSTEMI: cangrelor (3.5%) vs clopidogrel 
(4.4%) OR: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.17)].  
Results are mainly driven by the significantly lower incidence of stent thrombosis and MI. Definite ST which has 
some prognostic importance represented only a minority, and results were not significant (table E18) 
questioning the clinical relevance of the results. Significant results are mainly driven by the IPST. (refer to 
previous discussion). 
There  was  a  significant  difference  in  the  incidence  of  ST  between  cangrelor-treated  patients  (0.8%)  and 
clopidogrel-treated patients (1.4%) [OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.90; p=0.010], in addition to the significantly 
lower incidence of MI [cangrelor-treated patients (3.8%) and clopidogrel-treated patients (4.7%) [OR 0.80, 
95% CI: 0.67, 0.97; p=0.022]. No significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of death [0.3% for 
each of the cangrelor and clopidogrel groups; OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.52-1.92; p>0.999] or IDR [cangrelor-treated 
patients (0.5%) and clopidogrel-treated patients (0.7%), with OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.45, 1.2; p=0.217]. 
The data on safety outcomes in patients receiving prior prasugrel or ticagrelor is limited and this is currently 
reflected in the SmPC. Most of the patients were co-administered ASA, which is reflected in the indication. A 
slightly higher increase of peri-procedural GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use is recorded in the clopidogrel arm, which 
could  reflect  lower  efficacy  as  mentioned  by  the  applicant,  but  no  firm  conclusions  can  be  made  on  this 
observation.  
Studies comparing ticagrelol or prasugrel with clopidogrel were event-driven long term studies, so direct 
comparisons with results of the C-PHOENIX are not possible. However, using the same endpoints also that used 
in HORIZONS-AMI, show superiority of cangrelor was still maintained over clopidogrel, which is considered 
reassuring. (Table E25).

Nevertheless, these results are presented at 48 hours which is not accepted by the CHMP since clinical trials 
investigating acute administration of medicinal products are expected to cover a period beyond the time of 
administration/metabolism of the drug. For example the HORIZONS-AMI measured the efficacy at 30 days. 
CURRENT-OASIS 7 a randomised factorial trial investigating leading doses of clopidogrel and aspirin measured 
the outcome at 30 days. The applicant provided further efficacy data at D30, and results were overall 
comparable. 
Subgroup analysis. Efficacy results presented at 48 hours show that cangrelor was significantly better than 
clopidogrel; the results were also significant for the subgroup with stable CAD; results for STEMI or NSTEMI 
separately or combined were in the same favorable direction, but not statistically significant. This can be due to 
the smaller number of patients recruited in these subgroups. It is acknowledged that the study was not powered 
to show efficacy in each of the investigated subgroups. However, further reassurance is needed regarding 
efficacy in ACS as this is expected to be the main target for cangrelor.  In addition, it was also shown that clinical 
outcomes are different following PCI for stable CAD than STEMI based on the platelet reactivity to clopidogrel 
(Park et al., Am Heart J 2013;165:34-42.e1.). Presentation with ACS is also an independent predictor of stent 
thrombosis (Daemen et al., Lancet 2007;369:667–78).  
As pointed out by the applicant the results showing more events in the stable category than ACS setting are 
unexpected. The explanation is illustrated in figure E8. Although the total number of events was indeed higher 
in the SA group, these are mainly biochemically diagnosed MIs which could be ascertained in the SA group, but 
not in the STEMI group due to high baseline CKMB levels. On the other hand, the composite of 
death/QMI/IDR/ST constitutes most of the events in the STEMI group, which is to be expected.

endpoints from CHAMPION PHOENIX, by patient type (mITT, Final diagnosis) 
The generalisability of the results of C-PHOENIX to all subgroups is further discussed by the SAG, see later. 
Pooled analysis of the CHAMPION studies.  
The three CHAMPION studies shared common properties in the study design, such as the posology of cangrelor, 
using clopidogrel as the active comparator, the setting of the PCI across its spectrum (stable CAD, STEMI and 
NSTEMI). However, the value of the C-PCI and C-PLATFORM are limited as they were not completed due to 
pre-specified futility analysis. Had the studies been completed as planned their weight would have been bigger 
and the relative weight of C-PHOENIX smaller.  Two bodies overseeing the study conduct were set up. A DSMB 
was established and was responsible for monitoring the trial according to the protocol, to ensure the safety of 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 71/113 
 
  
  
 
 
patients in the trial. An Interim Analysis Review Committee was responsible for making recommendations to 
modify the trial using pre-specified adaptation rules, as well as stopping rules for efficacy and futility at the 70% 
interim analysis. The IARC members were independent of the sponsor and distinct from the DSMB. The roles of 
the two committees have been detailed. It seems improbable that their use would have hampered the safety 
oversight of the trials. In addition, a single DSMB was used in the PHOENIX pivotal trial. Importantly also the 
definition of MI used in the pooling was implemented retrospectively on the results of these studies. There was 
also no pre-specified pooling/metanalysis planned. As such the data are only presented for descriptive purposes. 
During the assessment, taking into account the major objections raised, the applicant proposed to restrict the 
indication of PCI to patients for whom oral P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. These may include 1) 
patients in the acute phase of cardiovascular illness who may experience reduced bioavailability consequent to 
nausea, use of opiates or impaired gastrointestinal perfusion resulting in reduced absorption, 2) patients 
presenting with an unclear aetiology of chest pain and where early administration of a long acting P2Y12 inhibitor 
may increase clinical risk (ie, aortic dissection, aortic rupture, oesophageal tear, pericarditis, 3)  patients 
referred for angiography and possible PCI who have a likelihood of requiring urgent or emergent coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and 4) patients requiring PCI while also suffering an active concomitant underlying 
condition that may require urgent surgery that would be delayed by long acting P2Y12 inhibitors (i.e., hip fracture 
complicated by unstable angina, NSTEMI or even STEMI).  
Recognising the ongoing debate regarding time of administration of antiplatelet administration in relation to 
PCI; differences between the acute and elective PCI and the possible impact on bleeding, the CHMP requested 
further clarification on this point to the MAH and this issue was discussed with the CV SAG experts for further 
advice to the CHMP. 
Additional expert consultation. 
1. The SAG is asked to comment on the benefits and risks of cangrelor during PCI, taking the 
following points into consideration: 
a. The use of clopidogrel as the active comparator in PCI for acute coronary syndromes (PCI-ACS), 
and the lack of comparator data against ticagrelor/prasugrel which are currently propagated as the 
preferred antithrombotic agents by the ESC guideline in this situation. 
The SAG experts agreed that the ESC guidelines provide recommendation for the use of platelet inhibitors during 
PCI in patients with both acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and chronic stable angina. The combined use of 
aspirin and clopidogrel is the standard of care for PCI in stable angina patients whereas for unstable patients 
(ACS, non-STEMI and STEMI), aspirin with either ticagrelor or prasugrel represent the standard of care. Aspirin, 
clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel are given orally, while cangrelor is administered intravenously. However, 
the SAG experts agreed that ticagrelor and prasugrel were not available at the initiation of the PHOENIX 
CHAMPION study, thus the use of clopidogrel as a comparator in all three subgroups of patients (stable CAD, 
non-STEMI AND STEMI) is acceptable. It was also appreciated that use of ticagrelor and prasugrel in patients 
with ACS remains limited in some European countries, but is increasing. Clopidogrel is still used in clinical 
practice even in ACS patients undergoing PCI. 
In conclusion, the SAG experts considered that the use of clopidogrel as active comparator is acceptable for 
patients with stable angina and also for patients with non-STEMI and STEMI undergoing PCI. Nevertheless, the 
improved outcome with ticagrelor of prasugrel versus clopidogrel should be accounted for. 
b. Dose and timing of clopidogrel administration in relation to the PCI and the way it affects the 
outcome of the pivotal study.

In CHAMPION PHOENIX study, all patients were P2Y12-inhibitor naive (defined as no P2Y12-inhibitor during 7 
days prior to randomisation). Cangrelor was administered before guidewire insertion (which defines the start of 
a PCI procedure) as bolus (30g/kg) followed by infusion (4g/kg/min) for 2 hours. Subsequently oral therapy 
with clopidogrel 600mg was started at the end of the infusion. In the comparator group clopidogrel 300 mg or 
600 mg was administered either before or immediately after PCI, at the discretion of the clinician. In both groups 
clopidogrel was continued with 75 mg according to the local protocols.  
The low dose (300 mg) and late administration of clopidogrel allowed in the protocol raised questions among the 
SAG experts because these favour the study drug, even though this was not observed in the analysis provided 
by the company. Earlier studies have shown that optimal protection with clopidogrel is achieved if a high dose 
(600 mg) is administered before a PCI procedure. Nevertheless, it should be noted that, although a high starting 
dose of 600 mg clopidogrel is recommended in current guidelines, the registered starting dose is 300 mg in 
some countries. 
In the CHAMPION PHOENIX study 63.4% of patients received clopidogrel before PCI, and 36.5 % during or after 
PCI (after guidewire insertion up to 1 hour after leaving the cath lab). The numerical difference observed in the 
study between cangrelor and the two clopidogrel dose groups is counter intuitive (OR 0.84 in 300mg group 
versus OR 0.77 in the 600mg group) as the 600 mg clopidogrel dose would be expected to provide better 
efficacy. 
In conclusion, all SAG experts agreed that the design of the CHAMPION PHOENIX study favoured cangrelor. 
Nevertheless, the study is considered reliable and representative of current clinical practice. The incidence of 
events at 48 hours is lower with cangrelor in the relevant subgroups: administration of clopidogrel before or 
after guidewire insertion [OR 0.80 (0.64-0.98) and 0.79 (0.59-1.06) respectively] and low (300mg) or high dose 
(600mg) of clopidogrel [OR 0.84 (0.62-1.14) and 0.77 (0.63-0.94) respectively].  
c. The generalisability of the main over-all study results to the subgroups of stable CAD, STEMI and 
non-STEMI.     
The majority of the randomised patients suffered from stable angina (3120 versus 3180 in cangrelor and 
clopidogrel groups respectively compared with non-STEMI (1389 versus 1421) and STEMI (961 versus 1030). In 
stable patients pre-treatment with a high dose of clopidogrel is feasible, while the use of cangrelor in clinical 
practice, once registered, would be mainly in immediate PCI for STEMI which represented only 1/6 of the 
patients in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial. Nevertheless, in many hospitals pre-treatment before diagnostic 
angiography is not done. Accordingly, the trial also investigates cangrelor in the very early phase of PCI when 
P2Y12 inhibition is not yet active in part of the patients.  
The results are significant only for the stable angina patients (5.4% versus 7.7% of events compared with the 
600mg dose). As the study was not powered to show superiority for all three subgroups the similar trend 
observed in all subgroups without significant interaction and with point estimates of the same magnitude (0.74 
- 0.80) is considered reassuring. Furthermore, the SAG found no arguments in the pharmacology or 
pathophysiology why cangrelor would have different efficacy in these subgroups. 
The observed benefit at 48 hour should be maintained at follow-up (day 30), with no increased risk of mortality 
or MI. Indeed the 30 day composite efficacy endpoint is marginally favourable for cangrelor over clopidogrel (6% 
versus 7% of events), although a numerical excess of death in the cangrelor group (60 versus 55) was noted at 
30 day follow-up. In contrast, numerically lower mortality was reported in the combined data of the three 
CHAMPION studies. 
In conclusion the SAG experts agreed with the generalisation of the results showing a reduction of thrombotic 
complications during or immediately after PCI, for the three subgroups of CAD patients (stable angina, 
non-STEMI and STEMI).

e. The proposed restriction by the MAH to patients with coronary artery disease undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in whom oral therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not 
feasible or desirable. 
The SAG experts unanimously considered that the proposed indication is not well defined. The indication should 
also mention that cangrelor should only be used in patients who have not been pre-treated with P2Y12 inhibitors, 
reflecting the CHAMPION PHOENIX patient population (naïve to P2Y12 inhibitors 7 days prior to randomisation). 
There are little data with non-naïve patients. In CHAMPION PCI the SAG Experts noted lower efficacy results in 
patients pre-treated with clopidogrel.  
 The SAG unanimously agreed that: 
- cangrelor could be considered as an alternative when P2Y12 blockers have not been initiated prior to PCI.  
- cangrelor could be a treatment option during PCI for all three subgroups whether stable CAD or non stable ACS 
(non-STEMI and STEMI).  
The SAG experts discussed whom would in practice initiate cangrelor therapy and when. Considering the 
diversity of clinical practice in EU, it is agreed that it would be an interventional cardiologist, for example when 
the patient is referred to an ad hoc PCI procedure, or when oral therapy is omitted / forgotten for other reasons. 
Protocols should be developed in each hospital to define the appropriate use of cangrelor in their setting. 
In practice, if a patient has not been pre-treated with P2Y12 inhibitors and requires immediate PCI intervention, 
this patient could be eligible for cangrelor therapy, whether suffering from stable or non stable CAD. The most 
critical element in the decision of therapy would be the need to start P2Y12 inhibition immediately. It was 
mentioned that also a short acting GP-IIb/IIIa receptor blocker (e.g. Abciximab or Integrilin) could be used in 
this setting, although it has not been registered for this specific purpose. It takes about 30 minutes (ticagrelor) 
or up to several hours (clopidogrel) before maximum platelet inhibition is achieved with an oral agent.  
In conclusion, the SAG recommended that the indication should reflect the use as an alternative when P2Y12 has 
not been initiated and recommended the following indication: "patients who have not received an oral P2Y12 
inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure and in whom oral therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor at the time of PCI is not 
feasible or desirable. In those patients an oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be started after the procedure, as soon as 
the patient’s condition allows”. 
2. The SAG is invited to comment on the clinical relevance of the investigated endpoints, mainly: 
myocardial infarction type 4a and stent thrombosis. In particular: 
a. The value of using stricter definitions of MI type 4a based on higher cut off CK-MB (for example ≥
10x ULN)  
The SAG agreed that there is no commonly agreed threshold for biomarker elevation, CK-MB or troponin, above 
which the risk for impaired outcome is evident. In fact, the risk increases gradually with higher values of these 
markers, reflecting larger amounts of myocardial damage during the procedure  In the absence of such objective 
evidence, any cut-off represents an arbitrary decision and the proposed definition (CK-MB ≥ 10x ULN or both 
clinical signs/symptoms and CK-MB > 5 x ULN) is acceptable. It is reassuring that the same trend is observed in 
the PHOENIX study for all different types of MI and when using different MI definitions (e.g. SCAI definition) and 
cut offs. 
It was noted that the rate of peri-procedural MI reported in PHOENIX for patients with stable angina was higher 
than for ACS. It is likely that peri-procedural MI in the latter is underestimated because of the challenge to 
distinguish such complication from the on-going infarction (ACS), which was the indication for PCI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 74/113 
 
  
  
b. The definition of stent thrombosis which included both ST as defined by the ARC and 
intraprocedural ST.  
The Experts agreed that stent thrombosis is a valid and acceptable endpoint in a PCI setting. Indeed stent 
thrombosis represents a serious, though relatively rare risk of the PCI intervention and should be avoided. The 
vast majority of these events (90%) occur within the first 2 days of the procedure thus the study design is 
acceptable. The end point at 30 days provides complementary information to ensure that the same magnitude 
of benefit is maintained at follow-up. 
It is recognised that both ticagrelor and prasugrel studies (TRITON, PLATO) did not use stent thrombosis as a 
primary endpoint but a secondary endpoint. The experts also noted the careful analysis made in the champion 
phoenix trial as the stent thrombosis endpoint was validated by an independent adjudication Committee which 
reviewed all angiograms recorded during the procedures. A stent thrombosis endpoint based on the 
observations of the local investigators, without core-lab assessment, would not be reliable. 
The efficacy data at 30 days are relevant and it is considered adequate to combine results of the three studies 
C PCI, C PLATFORM and C-PHOENIX studies to assess safety of cangrelor.  
3. The SAG is asked to express a view on the discontinued studies "C-PCI" and "C-PLATFORM".  
The Applicant explained that the indiscriminate definition of MI may have been the cause of failure 
to show superiority of cangrelor in these studies. Does the SAG support this view and accept not to 
take these results into consideration when the B/R of cangrelor is assessed?  
The detection of peri-procedural MI in the PCI and PLATFORM studies depended on cardiac markers alone while 
in PHOENIX a combination of cardiac markers and other evidence of ischaemia was required to define PCI 
related MI. In the first two studies only one sample was taken before PCI, thus it was not possible to adequately 
distinguish elevated markers of necrosis (MI) related to the event, which triggered the PCI (non-STEMI of 
STEMI) from elevation due to the procedure.  
The experts considered the results of C-PCI and C-PLATFORM of relevance. In particular the experts considered 
it reassuring that the numerically higher mortality observed in one trial (PHOENIX) is not observed in the other 
trials.  
In summary, the SAG experts agreed that the two studies discontinued for futility should be regarded as 
supportive since the additional analyses (using SCAI definition of MI) are all pointing in the same direction, 
which is reassuring.  
4. Based on all available evidence, the SAG is invited to comment on the positioning of cangrelor in 
the pharmacological armamentarium of PCI. 
Cangrelor is a very short acting agent (T1/2 3- 6min) with a structure similar to ticagrelor. It has a more rapid 
and greater inhibitory effect than existing therapies ticagrelor, prasugrel and clopidogrel. 
Cangrelor is a suitable alternative for the existing antiplatelet agents, especially in situations where an ad hoc 
PCI would be considered in patients who have not yet received double anti-platelet therapy. In addition, the IV 
administration is considered useful in patients who cannot swallow (e.g. intubated) or who are vomiting. The 
fast offset of action is also considered useful in order to manage major bleeding if such would occur during the 
procedure and to terminate platelet inhibition in patients who are referred for immediate surgery, although this 
will be very rare. 
The benefit of cangrelor is modest, mainly a reduction of peri-procedural MI and stent thrombosis and the effect 
is likely of similar magnitude as that of ticagrelor or prasugrel compared to clopidogrel. The therapeutic 
advantage of cangrelor combined with ticagrelor or prasugrel has not been investigated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 75/113 
 
  
  
The Experts debated the use of the clopidogrel as pre-loading dose prior to PCI intervention. It appears that 
major differences in medical practice exist in Europe in particular for the treatment of patients with stable angina 
pectoris. For example whereas in the UK, it is estimated that 95% of stable patients would be pre-loaded with 
a P2Y12 inhibitor, in France and Germany stable angina patients would often not be pre-treated but treatment 
would start after a decision to proceed with PCI has been taken, based on the angiogram.   
In ACS (non-STEMI and STEMI), ESC guidelines recommend a treatment with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 inhibitor 
as soon as possible, The experts agreed that for pre-treated patients there is no place for cangrelor. Patients 
who come to the cath lab and have not been pre-treated are potential candidates for cangrelor IV therapy. This 
is reflected in the proposed formulation of the indication in 1e, above. 
Discussion following SAG advice 
Clopidogrel dose and timing of its administration  
The time of administration of clopidogrel presented per indication: stable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI, showed 
that in the acute situations clopidogrel was mostly administered before or during PCI; while in the stable one, it 
was almost equally  divided between before and  during  PCI. The  results generally do not point to any trend 
regarding later administration of clopidogrel, which would have biased the results favouring cangrelor.  
It is agreed that, considering the time of onset of action of clopidogrel (2-4 hours), it should be administered well 
upfront of the PCI which may not be possible in the acute setting, as also acknowledged by the SAG experts.  
In conclusion, the design of the C-PHOENIX study may have favoured cangrelor compared to clopidogrel arm; 
nevertheless, the study is considered reliable and representative of current EU clinical practice as confirmed by 
the Experts, acknowledging the variability of the medical practice across EU. 
Validity of end points used (MI definition and stent thrombosis) 
Regarding the MI definition used (type4a MI), in the absence of a commonly agreed threshold definition for 
biomarker elevation, the Experts view agreed to the proposed definition of CK-MB ≥ 10x ULN or both clinical 
signs/symptoms and CK-MB > 5 x ULN, which was reassuring.  It was also considered reassuring that the same 
trend is observed in the PHOENIX study for all different types of MI and when using different MI definitions (e.g. 
SCAI definition) and cut offs.  
The CHMP was also reassured that stent thrombosis may be a valid and acceptable endpoint in a PCI setting as 
agreed by the SAG experts. Indeed, a careful analysis was made in the C-PHOENIX as the stent thrombosis 
endpoint was validated by an independent adjudication Committee that reviewed all angiograms recorded 
during the procedures (IPST).  
Generalisability of the study results to the subgroups of stable angina, STEMI and non-STEMI.   
The benefits shown in C-PHOENIX are applicable for the subgroup with stable CAD. In this subgroup, clopidogrel 
is the recommended agent for elective PCI due to lack of data with the newer anti-platelet agents like ticagrelor 
and prasugrel (ESC, 2013). Superiority of cangrelor was shown over clopidogrel. However, for PCI performed on 
STEMI and NSTEMI patients, the results are consistent, but did not reach statistical significance. This can be due 
to the limited representation of these subgroups in the study. The choice of clopidogrel as the active comparator 
is also not in line with the ESC guideline, but submitted utilisation data in EU show that clopidogrel is still the 
major antithrombotic used in the acute setting, validating its use as the active comparator in C-PHOENIX when 
ticagrelor and prasugrel were not available. It was also appreciated by the SAG experts that use of ticagrelor and 
prasugrel in patients with ACS remains limited in some European countries, although it is increasing. 
Furthermore, efficacy of ticagrelor and prasugrel is based on long term efficacy data; their efficacy at 48 hours 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 76/113 
 
  
  
is not specifically investigated. In summary, the use of clopidogrel as a comparator in all three subgroups of 
patients (stable CAD, non-STEMI AND STEMI) is considered acceptable for the submitted study.  
Furthermore,  the  CHMP  took  into  account  the  experts  view  regarding    C-PCI  and  C-PLATFORM  studies  and 
agreed  that  the  two  studies  discontinued  for  futility  should  be  regarded  as  supportive  since  the  additional 
analyses  are  all  pointing  in  the  same  direction,  which  is  reassuring.  In  particular  the  experts  considered  it 
reassuring that the numerically higher mortality observed in one trial (PHOENIX) is not observed in the other 
trials.  
Following discussion in the SAG experts, cangrelor was further restricted to patients who have not been 
pre-treated with P2Y12 inhibitors, reflecting the CHAMPION PHOENIX patient population (naïve to P2Y12 
inhibitors 7 days prior to randomisation).   
With these restrictions, the efficacy of cangrelor is considered to be demonstrated as an alternative to existing 
treatments if a patient has not been pre-treated with P2Y12 inhibitors.  
In summary, the CHMP agreed that efficacy of cangrelor, co administered with acetylsalicylic acid was 
demonstrated for the below group of patients undergoing PCI in a restricted setting (see below) : 
Cangrelor, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic 
cardiovascular events in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure and in whom oral 
therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Cangrelor is a rapidly acting P2Y12 inhibitor developed for use during PCI and bridging. 
For the bridging indication, the investigated primary endpoints are PD parameters that are not considered 
sufficient for proof of efficacy. In addition, the proposed dose may not be adequate, especially in light of the 
doses used in PCI. Nevertheless, this indication was withdrawn during the assessment.  
For the PCI indication, the study design with inclusion of all three subgroups indicated for PCI in one study is not 
optimal. The use of clopidogrel as the active comparable is defendable. The primary efficacy endpoint included 
MI type 4a, which is of limited clinical relevance, but its relevance was verified by further analysis. The inclusion 
of stent thrombosis could be acceptable; the results of ST are driven by peri-procedural type, which are of some 
value, but should have been investigated separately. Further to SAG advice received on the relevance of the 
stent thrombosis and MI definition used for the primary endpoint, the CHMP was reassured and considered 
overall the data reliable and relevant in the PCI setting. Additionally, sensitivity analysis submitted including 
clinically relevant endpoints, showed that the superiority of cangrelor over clopidogrel is maintained at 48 hours 
which is reassuring, and the efficacy data at 30 days are comparable with the 48 hours efficacy results.  
In C-PHOENIX cangrelor was co administered with acid acetylsalicylic and the vast majority of patients were 
P2Y12 naïve or did not receive prior P2Y12 therapy prior to PCI. This was further taken into account by the 
applicant in the amended restricted indication. Therefore, the CHMP considered the efficacy demonstrated in the 
amended indication  
Cangrelor, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic 
cardiovascular events in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure and in whom oral 
therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety of cangrelor for its intended use in the PCI and Bridging settings is based on a safety dataset 
of over 26,000 subjects from 16 clinical studies (Phase I through Phase III), of which more than 25,000 were 
studied in the CHAMPION and BRIDGE studies.  
The clinical safety data are presented separately for the CHAMPION and BRIDGE studies which is acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to cangrelor across the different studies is presented in table S1.  
Table S1: Summary of cangrelor exposure  
The patients receiving the highest dose (4.0 µg/kg/min) for short duration (<24 hours) represent the majority 
of exposures (12,787, 99.12%), as they originate predominantly in the pooled CHAMPION studies. Patients 
receiving the 0.75 mg/kg/min dose represent patients from the BRIDGE study, with the duration of exposures 
ranging from <24 hours up to ≥72 hours (table S2).

Deaths 
The overall incidence of death in All Studies pooled was low and numerically lower in the cangrelor group (2.3%) 
than the comparator group in the All Studies population (2.6%), including C- PHOENIX (0.3% and 0.4% 
respectively) and BRIDGE (1.9% and 5% respectively) (table S9).

In addition to bleeding, dyspnoea, renal impairment, and hypersensitivity were considered as adverse events of 
special interests (AESI) based on the preclinical and clinical data and pharmacological effects. 
1. Bleeding 
Bleeding events were reported more frequently with cangrelor than with the control in the CHAMPION trials 
(Table S10) and in the BRIDGE trial (Table S11).

Fatal Bleeding. In the total pooled safety population, fatal bleeding events within 30 days of dosing were low 
and balanced in cangrelor (8/12565, 0.1%) vs control group (9/12542, 0.1%). Five of the 17 combined fatalities 
were due to bleeding in the nervous system, with four in the cangrelor arm and one in the clopidpgrel arm (table 
S12). Deaths after 30 days were low and were similar in both the cangrelor and control groups (5 vs 6, 
respectively).

Table S12: Summary of bleeding-related death within 30 days from dosing start [CHAMPION 
Pooled, safety population] 
Bleeding events were reported as endpoints in the CHAMPION and BRIDGE studies. Bleeding events were 
captured in the CHAMPION studies for 48 hours after randomization, and in the BRIDGE study during surgery 
and through hospital discharge. The bleeding endpoints were collected on the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) and were programmatically imputed into three bleeding scales: 
o 
o 
o 
Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO),  
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) and  
Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) scales. 
In C-PHOENIX, there was no significant increase in the primary safety outcome of GUSTO 
severe/life-threatening bleeding or GUSTO moderate bleeding (Table S13). There was a significant  increase in 
GUSTO mild bleeding, driven primarily by ecchymosis, oozing, and <5 cm haematoma. There was a significant  
increase in ACUITY major bleeding that was primarily driven by an increase in ≥5 cm haematoma at the 
puncture site. Results of the pooled CHAMPION studies showed comparable results (table S14).

In the pooled CHAMPION studies which were PCI trials, CABG was infrequent occurring in 164/25,107 (0.6%) of 
patients (82/12,565 in the cangrelor and 82/12,542 in the clopidogrel treatment arms, respectively). No GUSTO 
Severe/Life threatening bleeding occurred. ACUITY Major and Minor as well as GUSTO Moderate and Mild 
bleeding was balanced in each treatment arm. There was no difference in CABG related blood and blood product 
utilization between cangrelor and clopidogrel treated subjects (table S17). 
Table S17: Analysis of CABG-related bleeding complications from pooled CHAMPION studies (safety 
population) 
In the BRIDGE study, there were generally more non-CABG bleeding events in the cangrelor treated group 
(table S18). The frequency of major bleeding endpoints was low with the increase in frequency of bleeding 
driven mostly by ecchymosis, haematoma and puncture site bleeding, but results were not significant. The 
frequency of CABG-related bleeding endpoints measured was overall higher than pre-CABG, but balanced 
between treatment arms (table S19).

The SAG was also requested to provide their input on the bleeding profile of cangrelor as follows:

d. The bleeding profile of cangrelor and the need for further characterisation, in particular in the 
patients undergoing PCI-ACS where a larger bleeding difference was found in STEMI and 
non-STEMI patients, taking also into account the profile obtained with other antiplatelet agents. 
The SAG considered the safety profile of cangrelor acceptable even though a higher bleeding risk is observed 
compared to clopidogrel [OR 1.63 (0.92-2.90) for all subgroups]. This increase in bleeding has to be balanced 
with the higher pharmacological efficacy of cangrelor in inhibiting platelet aggregation, and subsequently in 
reducing thrombosis risk. 
The majority of the bleeding events observed in the cangrelor group are ecchymosis and haematomas >5 cm at 
puncture sites and manageable. No intracranial haemorrhages were observed in either group. 
The bleeding rate is higher in non-STEMI and STEMI patients (1.2 and 0.8 versus 0.7 and 0.4 in cangrelor and 
clopidogrel groups respectively). This may be due in part to the concomitant use of anticoagulants in these 
patients. It should be appreciated that also the risk of thrombotic events is higher in patients with ACS, although 
the development of infarction during treatment in patients with ACS is difficult to ascertain. The relative bleeding 
risk was similar in stable and unstable patients.  
With regards to bleeding related death within 30 days, the SAG noted a numerically higher rate of patients with 
cardiac tamponade with cangrelor (n=2 of which one case was fatal in the cangrelor group versus no cases in the 
clopidogrel group) which is of concern and recommends an appropriate warning in the SmPC. This could be due 
to guidewire perforation, a risk inherent to the procedure itself. Accordingly, special care should be 
recommended.   
The increased numbers of death at day 30 due to cardiogenic shock (9 versus 5 with cangrelor and clopidogrel 
respectively) and myocardial infarction (8 versus 1) need to be further investigated according to the SAG 
experts. Furthermore, there is a need to look at the totality of the data related to death at day 30 from all three 
trials. 
The SAG also noted that few patients with high bleeding risk were included in the study (low body weight, 
elderly, females) and that the mean age of the study population is rather low (65 years of age) which is younger 
than the patient population in current practice. The SAG recommended that this should be addressed with 
appropriate warnings.  
In the CHAMPION PHOENIX study, any patient with stroke or TIA within the last 6 months was excluded. Thus, 
the SmPC recommends a contra-indication in these patients. The Experts considered this to be more applicable 
with the US practice and the Experts were not convinced about the need to contra-indicate the use of cangrelor 
in these patients. Nevertheless, this is justified as it represents the study population excluded from the study. 
2. Renal Function 
Cangrelor was shown to be associated with reversible AEs in rats and dogs  in the upper urinary tract. 
In all reported studies, there was a numerical increase in renal-related AEs for cangrelor of 93/13,301 (0.7%) vs 
64/12,861 (0.5%) (Table S20).

There were a total of 13 deaths reported in patients with the SMQ of Acute Renal Failure; 7 of the deaths 
occurred in cangrelor-treated patients and 6 in the control group. 
Baseline and post-baseline creatinine level data were obtained in the C-PCI and C-PLATFORM but were not 
captured in C-PHOENIX trial. The incidence of SMQ of Acute Renal Failure appeared to increase with worsening 
baseline renal function (table S21).

3. Dyspnoea 
Dyspnoea has been reported with reversible inhibitors of P2Y12. In C- PHOENIX study, dyspnoea was reported in 
1.2% of patients in the cangrelor arm vs 0.3% in the clopidogrel arm, which is consistent with the incidence in 
the All Studies group. In BRIDGE, the incidence of dyspnoea was 2.8% (3/106) in the cangrelor group versus 
0.9% (1/101) in the placebo group. The majority of dyspnoea was non-serious (98%), mild (66%), with only a 
few cases (n=3) severe. The median time of the event was 2 hours. Few patients discontinued the study drug 
due to dyspnoea (10/179, 5.6%). No patient died of dyspnea.  
4.  Hypersensitivity 
 There were similar overall rates of hypersensitivity events reported with cangrelor (0.7%) vs control (0.6%) in 
all studies, but a higher rate of SAEs with cangrelor vs control (7 vs 2) (Table S22).

In All Studies and in the CHAMPION programme, the potentially clinically significant test values in haematology 
between the cangrelor and control treatment groups were consistent with the findings in the bleeding events 
(Table S23). Clinical chemistry parameters were also balanced except for a higher creatinine level (>1×ULN) in 
the cangrelor group compared to the clopidogrel or control (table S24). In the placebo controlled studies, there 
were numerically more patients with post-baseline changes in AST (>1×ULN).

Discontinuation due to AES 
The incidence of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug in the C-PHOENIX study and 
in the CHAMPION program (Table S26) was low and similar in the cangrelor-treated and clopidogrel-treated 
patients.

The most common AEs leading to discontinuation were in the SOC of Cardiac disorders. The top two most 
common AEs leading to discontinuation were coronary artery dissection and coronary artery perforation, both of 
which were procedure related. Dyspnoea also led to discontinuation and was reported by more patients in the 
cangrelor group than in the clopidogrel group.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient Exposure. The safety database is adequate for the PCI indication, for both the dose (4.0µg/kg/min) 
and the maximum duration indicated in the SmPC of 4 hours. For the bridging indication, patient exposure is 
very limited to those recruited in the BRIDGE study (stage II: cangrelor n=93  ; placebo, n=90).  
The SmPC mentioned that experience is available for administration up to 7 days. The applicant explained that 
the duration of 7 days referred to the period of disruption of oral P2Y12 antiplatelets. However, the actual 
experience in the BRIDGE study is limited to one patient with the longest administration of 6.7 days. Based on 
these data, the inclusion of the reference to 7 days in the SmPC is not supported (Reference to the Bridging 
indication is removed from the label).  
Focus on the current assessment will be on the safety data from the pooled CHAMPION studies as the included 
patient populations, and posology were comparable to that of C-PHOENIX, nevertheless a wider database can 
help identify the safety profile. Post CABG bleeding data from the BRIDGE study is important to clarify the 
bleeding risks associated with bridging.  
Adverse Events. The reported AE are generally balanced and reflect the studied population, and the 
pharmacological class of cangrelor.  
Serious adverse events. The frequency of SAEs in the CHAMPION studies is low and balanced between the 
treatment groups, which is reassuring. In the BRIDGE study, the frequency of SAEs is higher in the cangrelor 
group compared to the placebo group, specially post CABG (7.8% vs 5.2 respectively). There was one case of 
coronary artery thrombosis reported in the cangrelor group.  Reviewing the case narrative, it is difficult to assess 
causality (lack of efficacy during bridging) of cangrelor in relation to the stent thrombosis, as the event occurred 
4 days following the CABG surgery. In addition, no outcome data are collected in the BRIDGE study that could 
further clarify this event.  
Deaths. The death rate in the cangrelor group was comparable to that reported in the clopidogrel group in the 
CHAMPION studies. This is in line with the efficacy data discussed before. In the BRIDGE study the death rate in 
the cangrelor group (1.9%) was much lower than that in placebo (5%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 95/113 
 
  
  
 
 
In all studies, the major cause of death was cardiovascular-related, its overall incidence being comparable in the 
cangrelor group (2.3% for 4 pooled studies and 2.4% in the CHAMPION studies) than in the comparator group 
(2.6%). In C-PHOENIX at day 30, 61 deaths were reported in the cangrelor group (1.1%) versus 57 deaths in 
the clopidogrel group (1.0%). An imbalance in the reported incidence of deaths due to cardiogenic shock and 
myocardial infarction is noted (9 and 8 cases in the cangrelor group versus 5 and 1 in the clopidogrel group 
respectively). There are also 5 additional cases of death related to acute MI in the cangrelor arm versus 3 in the 
clopidogrel arm. Opposite trends were shown in C-PCI and C-PLATFORM. Deaths related to cardiogenic shock, 
MI and AMI were reported less in the cangrelor arm ( for C- PCI 4, 2, 0 and C-PLATFORM 4, 0 and 2 respectively) 
than in the clopidogrel arm (for C-PCI 6, 6, 2, and C-PLATFORM 12, 2, and 1 respectively).  
Bleeding. There is a slightly higher bleeding risk associated with cangrelor (17.9%) compared to clopidogrel 
(14%) in the CHAMPION studies due to higher rates of traumatic haematoma (6.4% vs 4.8% respectively); 
vessel puncture site discharge (6.1% vs 4.5%); ecchymosis (4.7% vs 3.3%) and haematoma (2.2% vs. 1.6%). 
Intracranial haemorrhage was recorded in a higher frequency in the cangrelor group than clopidogrel. This is 
currently reflected as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The frequency of GI bleeding and fatal bleedings 
were comparable, which is reassuring.  CABG-related bleedings in patients who had CABG in the CHAMPIONS 
trials showed comparable trends as in the non-CABG bleedings, with higher frequencies in the cangrelor group 
recorded in GUSTO moderate bleeding, and ACUITY minor bleedings. In the BRIDGE study, presented bleeding 
data are reassuring considering that the comparator is placebo. For this reason, it also appears unexpected to 
observe higher frequencies of blood transfusions, drop in haemoglobin or haematocrite reported in the placebo 
group compared to the cangrelor group (25.5 vs 32.3% and 16.7 vs 22.9 respectively). The company did not 
clarify the possible reasons for such differences. However, it can be agreed that the study was not powered to 
address the differences in components, and that the results were not significantly different precluding any 
conclusions. 
A numerically higher rate of patients with cardiac tamponade with cangrelor (n=2 of which one case was fatal in 
the cangrelor group versus no cases in the clopidogrel group) was observed which is of concern; a warning is 
currently included in the SmPC.  
Fatal bleeding. The incidence of fatal bleeding appears to be balanced between the cangrelor and the control 
groups. This is reassuring. However, there were 5 cases of bleeding in the nervous system, 4 in the cangrelor 
arm and 1 in the control arm. Assessment of the 4 fatal cases shows that in 3/4 there is a history of stroke, or 
possibly TIA. There is no mention of the time of onset in relation to cangrelor administration. To address the fatal 
cases, the  contraindication proposed by the applicant of " Any history of intracranial haemorrhage or ischaemic 
stroke within the last year" is modified to 'History of stroke or TIA" without any reference to timing.  An 
interaction between cangrelor and a specific anticoagulant leading to a higher intracranial haemorrhage can not 
be ruled out, but is not clear from the submitted narratives. A general warning is included in the SmPC.  
Bleeding scales. It is considered a disadvantage that the bleeding events were not adjudicated by a blinded 
committee.  Using the ISTH definitions to classify bleedings would have also been preferred (Schulman at al., 
2005). The ACUITY
1
 bleeding definitions are the most comparable to those used by the ISTH, and so the 
assessment will focus on their results.  
Bleeding complications are about 1.5 times more frequent with cangrelor compared to clopidogrel but seem to 
be mostly of non-severe nature. In C-PHOENIX there was no significant increase in the primary safety outcome 
1 Non-CABG major bleeding that included any one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, ≥5 cm diameter 
haematoma at puncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of >4 g/dL without an overt source of bleeding, reduction in 
haemoglobin concentration of >3 g/dL with an overt source of bleeding, re-operation for bleeding, use of any blood product 
transfusion.

of GUSTO severe/life-threatening bleeding or GUSTO moderate bleeding. There was a significant increase in 
GUSTO mild bleeding, driven primarily by ecchymosis, oozing, and <5 cm haematoma. There were significant 
increases in ACUITY major and minor bleedings. The former was primarily driven by an increase in ≥5 cm 
haematoma at the puncture site.  Comparable results are observed for the pooled CHAMPION studies.  
Nevertheless, the data on bleeds may be incomplete due to 1) the restrictive definition for GUSTO mild and 2) 
for the investigator report based counts of changes in Hgb/Hct without re-confirming e.g. by assessing the 
collected laboratory values (affecting e.g. the TIMI defined bleeding cases) as well as 3) reliance in the bleeding 
related death counts on the investigator reports only and not investigating the relation of all reported deaths and 
possible preceding bleeds. Additional assessment is asked from the company in this regard (LOI).It was 
observed that different frequencies were reported in the C-PHOENIX study when using GUSTO vs ACUITY 
bleeding scale, whereas frequencies are comparable in the pooled CHAMPION analysis.  The applicant explained 
that the observed differences were related to the different definitions used throughout the CHAMPION program. 
Using the same definitions resulted in comparable results.  
It is noticeable that for stable CAD, bleeding rate appears comparable between cangrelor (0.4%) and clopidogrel 
(0.3%). However, the risk appears to increase more in the acute setting in the side of cangrelor (0.8%) 
compared to clopidogrel (0.4%). Further analysis of the bleeding data was requested. In the response the 
applicant clarified that in all three CHAMPION trials bleeding outcomes were only collected until 48-hours, 
therefore, no bleeding data is available at 30 days or 1 year. Considering the limited duration of administration 
of cangrelor of 4 hours and duration of pharmacodynamic action, bleeding data beyond 48 hours may not be 
directly relevant to the safety assessment of cangrelor.  Using the GUSTO definitions it can be observed that the 
numbers of severe/life threatening events are limited across the different strata, precluding a robust conclusion. 
Using the ACUITY major bleeding, results are significantly better in the clopidogrel group. However, it can be 
agreed with the applicant that excluding haematoma > 5 cm leads to similar trends, but not significant 
differences, making it difficult to draw robust conclusions.

Renal Function. Pre clinical data show some deleterious effects of cangrelor on the upper urinary tract. Data 
were not collected in C-PHOENIX, which is disappointing. In the whole safety database, the main concern 
appears to be increased blood creatinine (0.2% vs 0.1%), although the actual numbers are limited. In addition, 
more cases of acute renal failure are reported in the cangrelor treatment arm compared to clopidogrel in the 
C-PCI and C-PLATFORM studies in patients with baseline severe or moderate renal impairment. However, this 
was not seen in the placebo-controlled studies. Data of patients with different degrees of renal impairment 
pertaining to progression of renal function and bleeding in the pooled C-PCI and PLATFORM studies were 
submitted, as in C-PHOENIX such data was not collected. There is a trend for deterioration of renal function as 
measured by creatinine clearance and GFR mostly in patients with baseline severe renal impairment in the 
cangrelor group compared to the clopidogrel group. Likewise, in such patients, there is a higher incidence of 
moderate GUSTO and major ACUITY bleeding rates reported. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC section 
4.4.

Dyspnoea. There is a higher incidence of dyspnea reported with cangrelor than with clopidogrel, which is a class 
effect for direct P2Y12 antagonists (reported with ticagrelor as well). A warning on the risk of dyspnea is 
therefore included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Hypersensitivity. The general incidence of hypersensitivity was balanced between cangrelor and the control 
groups. However there is a slightly higher incidence of serious cases of hypersensitivity reported with cangrelor. 
None of these cases were fatal. Assessment of the 7 cases led to the conclusion that the causality of cangrelor 
cannot be excluded, as all the cases are confounded by the co-administration by other agents e.g contrast 
agents. The reported cases were serious but because they all occur during hospitalization or the catheterization 
laboratory, they were all managed successfully. The overall incidence is comparable. Some changes in section 
4.4 are proposed to highlight the seriousness of these cases. 
Laboratory findings. The recorded haematology results appear to be in line with the bleeding profile of 
cangrelor. There is a slight increase in the level of serum creatinine compared to clopidogrel, which has been 
discussed before. The applicant discussed the differences in the mechanism of action of ticagrelor compared to 
cangrelor which support a differential effect on uric acid. Data from the CHAMPION studies showed that the 
incidence of AEs relating to uric acid increase was generally low and similar between cangrelor and control 
[7/12565 (0.1%) vs 5/12542 (0.0%) respectively. 
Vital signs.  The applicant discussed available data pertaining to ventricular pauses. Preclinical data did not 
indicate that cangrelor can be associated with such AEs, unlike ticagrelor. The thorough QT study also did not 
point to any arrhythmogenic potential. Lastly, the applicant presented data pooled from the CHAMPION studies 
which are all reassuring and showing comparable incidence to the comparator. 
Eye disorders. One case of serious eye disorder was reported in the cangrelor arm (SCS). The applicant 
discussed the pre-clinical and clinical findings pertaining to ocular AEs. Regarding the pre-clinical data, it can be 
agreed that their clinical relevance are limited. This is mainly because they occurred in a dog tissue that is not 
found in humans. Also the findings were apparent after long term dosing (28 days) which is much longer than 
the clinical use (2 hours to 7 days).  
In the cangrelor clinical program, there was a higher frequency of ocular related AEs in the cangrelor group. It 
can not be excluded that this is related to the higher rate of minor bleedings. The serious cases discussed by the 
applicant pertain to one case of blurred vision, and another case of central retinal artery occlusion. In both cases 
the direct deleterious effect of cangrelor on the ocular tissues is considered unlikely. 
Special populations. Analysis of the incidence of AEs based on different subgroups showed a significant 
interaction by gender and smoking. It is difficult to explain this finding based on clinical grounds. It can be 
agreed that a chance finding can not be excluded, considering the multiple interactions tested and the higher 
chances of false positive results of the statistical analysis. Further analysis based on individual AE resulted in 
small numbers and does not show a clear pattern. The incidence of the different types of AEs is shown to be 
comparable between cangrelor and clopidogrel for the respective age groups, with increasing frequency by age 
as would be expected.  
AE leading to discontinuation. The reported AE leading to discontinuation appear to be balanced in the whole 
program. Dyspnoea is frequently reported as the AE leading to discontinuation.    
In conclusion, from the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additionally during the assessment, the CHMP sought the SAG advive in relation to the bleeding. (see below)

1. The SAG is asked to comment on the benefits and risks of cangrelor during PCI, taking the 
following points into consideration: 
d. The bleeding profile of cangrelor and the need for further characterisation, in particular in the 
patients undergoing PCI-ACS where a larger bleeding difference was found in STEMI and 
non-STEMI patients, taking also into account the profile obtained with other antiplatelet agents. 
The SAG considered the safety profile of cangrelor acceptable even though a higher bleeding risk is observed 
compared to clopidogrel [OR 1.63 (0.92-2.90) for all subgroups]. This increase in bleeding has to be balanced 
with the higher pharmacological efficacy of cangrelor in inhibiting platelet aggregation, and subsequently in 
reducing thrombosis risk. 
The majority of the bleeding events observed in the cangrelor group are ecchymosis and haematomas >5 cm at 
puncture sites and manageable. No intracranial haemorrhages were observed in either group. 
The bleeding rate is higher in non-STEMI and STEMI patients (1.2 and 0.8 versus 0.7 and 0.4 in cangrelor and 
clopidogrel groups respectively). This may be due in part to the concomitant use of anticoagulants in these 
patients. It should be appreciated that also the risk of thrombotic events is higher in patients with ACS, although 
the development of infarction during treatment in patients with ACS is difficult to ascertain. The relative bleeding 
risk was similar in stable and unstable patients.  
With regards to bleeding related death within 30 days, the SAG noted a numerically higher rate of patients with 
cardiac tamponade with cangrelor (n=2 of which one case was fatal in the cangrelor group versus no cases in the 
clopidogrel group) which is of concern and recommends an appropriate warning in the SmPC. This could be due 
to guidewire perforation, a risk inherent to the procedure itself. Accordingly, special care should be 
recommended.   
The increased numbers of death at day 30 due to cardiogenic shock (9 versus 5 with cangrelor and clopidogrel 
respectively) and myocardial infarction (8 versus 1) need to be further investigated according to the SAG 
experts. Furthermore, there is a need to look at the totality of the data related to death at day 30 from all three 
trials. 
The SAG also noted that few patients with high bleeding risk were included in the study (low body weight, 
elderly, females) and that the mean age of the study population is rather low (65 years of age) which is younger 
than the patient population in current practice. The SAG recommended that this should be addressed with 
appropriate warnings.  
In the CHAMPION PHOENIX study, any patient with stroke or TIA within the last 6 months was excluded. Thus, 
the SmPC recommends a contra-indication in these patients. The Experts considered this to be more applicable 
with the US practice and the Experts were not convinced about the need to contra-indicate the use of cangrelor 
in these patients. Nevertheless, this is justified as it represents the study population excluded from the study. 
The CHMP took note of the advice in its assessment (see above).  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database of cangrelor is considered adequate for the proposed indication. The identified risks of 
bleeding and dyspnea are related to its mechanism of action and pharmacological class. In the PCI indication, 
incidence of bleeding is somewhat higher for cangrelor compared to clopidogrel, particularly for intracranial 
bleedings. The difference is not significant, however a warning is included in the labelling. Bleeding rates are 
comparable between cangrelor and clopidogrel in the three major subgroups (Stable, NSTEMI and STEMI) when 
using GUSTO severe/life-threatening and moderate bleeding. Using the ACUITY scale, there is a significant 
Assessment report

Page 100/113 
 
  
  
increase in bleeding in the ACS group administered cangrelor, but that is less evident with the exclusion of 
haematomas of > 5 cm. 
 In the BRIDGE study, compared to placebo, the bleeding results are reassuring, although the database is 
limited.  
In patients with severe renal impairment a deterioration in renal function compared to clopidogrel is noticed, in 
addition to a higher rate of GUSTO moderate bleeding. The effects on renal function are adequately addressed 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Further analysis of data did not reveal AEs related to ventricular pauses or elevations 
of uric acids, unlike what is reported with ticagrelor.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Cangrelor is a novel, intravenous, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist. It was developed for two indications: 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) indication to prevent thrombotic cardiovascular events and Bridging 
indication, in the pre-operative period when anti-thrombotic agents are interrupted. The latter was withdrawn at 
D180 due to major objections raised on the lack of clinical evidence, thus not described below. 
The PCI indication is based mainly on CHAMPION PHOENIX (C-PHOENIX), the only complete and positive study 
from the CHAMPION triad (C-PCI and C-PLATFORM).  
The pivotal C-PHOENIX study was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial designed to test whether 
cangrelor at the time of PCI followed by transition to oral clopidogrel is superior to oral clopidogrel therapy alone 
at reducing thrombotic events during and immediately after PCI. In this trial, 11.185 patients where included 
with stable angina (SA), ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), among them around 40% recruited in EU, which is reassuring regarding the 
applicability to EU clinical practices. 
The composite incidence of death/MI/IDR/stent thrombosis among mITT patients was 4.7% in the cangrelor 
treatment arm and 5.9% in the clopidogrel treatment arm. For adjusted analysis using logistic regression to 
control for the potential confounding factors of patient baseline status and clopidogrel loading dose, OR: 0.78 
(95% CI: 0.66, 0.93), p=0.005; for unadjusted analysis, OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.93), p=0.006. 
Assessment report  
EMA/137542/2015 
Page 104/113 
 
  
  
  
 
Benefits were shown for the subgroups of stable angina SA, STEMI and NSTEMI but significance was only shown 
for the SA subgroup [cangrelor (5.8%) vs clopidogrel (7.4%) OR: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.95); STEMI: cangrelor 
(2.8%) vs clopidogrel (3.7%) OR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.25) and NSTEMI: cangrelor (3.5%) vs clopidogrel 
(4.4%) OR: 0.8 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.1.17)].  
Significant results were shown against the clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose [cangrelor (4.3%) vs clopidogrel 
(5.6%) OR: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.94)]; but not the clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose [cangrelor (5.8%) vs 
clopidogrel (6.8%) OR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.14)]. Significant results were shown when clopidogrel was 
administered before PCI start [cangrelor (4.8%) vs clopidogrel (6.0%) OR: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.98)] but not 
when administered after PCI start, but with consistent effect on the OR [cangrelor (4.3%) vs clopidogrel (5.4%) 
OR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.06)]. 
There was a significant difference in the incidence of ST between cangrelor-treated patients (0.8%) and 
clopidogrel-treated patients (1.4%) [OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.90; p=0.010], in addition to the significantly 
lower incidence of MI [cangrelor-treated patients (3.8%) and clopidogrel-treated patients (4.7%) [OR 0.80, 
95% CI: 0.67, 0.97; p=0.022]. No significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of death or IDR.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The inclusion of stent thrombosis as a separate component of the primary composite endpoint with other 
"harder" clinical outcome measures is debatable. This is a radiographic diagnosis that may not necessarily lead 
to a clinical intervention.  ST included both ARC ST (definite) and intraprocedural stent thrombosis IPST. 
Significant results of stent thrombosis are mainly driven by the IPST, which is of questionable clinical relevance.  
Likewise, the measurement of PCI-related MI is questioned; it would have been better to capture all types of 
MIs, and analyse them separately according to their prognostic value.   
The measurement of the primary endpoint at 48 hours alone is not sufficient. The study period should cover an 
adequate period to include efficacy and safety events that have a temporal relation to the investigated agent. 
Further analysis was requested to include a 30 days period.  
The choice of clopidogrel as the active comparator for the subgroups of STEMI and NSTEMI is debatable. 
Prasugrel or ticagrelor may have been more valid comparators according to the current ESC guideline.  Allowing 
the use of either 300 or 600 mg clopidogrel as a loading dose in the control group, while a fixed 600 mg was 
given following PCI in the cangrelor group is debatable. The SAG experts agreed that such design may have 
favoured cangrelor. Still it was acknowledged that there are major differences in EU regarding clopidogrel use.  
The majority of studied population in C-PHOENIX was indicated for elective PCI (56%); 25% indicated for PCI 
with NSTEMI and only around 19% of the patients indicated for PCI with STEMI, which is quite limited 
representation. Results were only positive for the elective PCI, but not the ACS related PCI. In the general cohort 
no significant improvement was demonstrated in death or IDR. There is a slight numerical increase in the 
reported CV deaths in the cangrelor group (0.9%; 48/5462) compared to the clopidogrel group (0.8%; 
46/5457; RR:1.04 95% CI:0.69-1.57).  
The three CHAMPION studies shared common properties. In the current application focus is mainly given to 
C-PHOENIX;  the value of the two other studies is limited due to the issued associated with the definitions of MI. 
The studies were not completed due to pre-specified futility analysis. There was also no pre-specified 
pooling/metanalysis planned. As such the data are only presented for descriptive purposes. Reanalysis of data 
from C-PCI and C-PLATFORM using the updated definition of MI generally support the results of the C-PHOENIX 
study.

Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety of cangrelor is based on the exposure in the CHAMPION studies of 24,107 patients, of whom 
12,565 were administered cangrelor. The incidence of any AE was comparable in the cangrelor (23.1%) and 
clopidogrel arms (21.9%). The most common AE was bleeding. The frequency of SAEs was similar in the 
cangrelor group and clopidogrel groups (2.2% each), with also similar frequencies reported for cardiogenic 
shock, ventricular fibrillation, hypotension, chest pain, coronary artery dissection.  The overall incidence of 
death was lower in the cangrelor group  (2.4% versus 2.6% in the clopidogrel group). The major cause of death 
was cardiovascular-related (1.1% and 1.2% in the cangrelor and clopidogrel groups respectively), with similar 
incidence reported for myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock. In C-PHOENIX at day 30, 
there was a comparable rate of deaths reported in the cangrelor group (1.1%) and the clopidogrel group 
(1.0%). There was a slight imbalance in the reported incidence of deaths due to cardiogenic shock, MI and acute 
MI favouring clopidogrel. Opposite trends were shown in C-PCI and C-PLATFORM.  
Patients with any bleeding-related AE were more frequently reported in the cangrelor group (17.9%) than the 
clopidogrel group (14%) due to higher rates of minor bleedings. GI bleedings were slightly more frequent in the 
cangrelor group (0.2%) than the clopidogrel group (0.1%). Nervous system related bleedings were also higher 
in the cangrelor group (0.1%) than the clopidogrel group (0).  A numerically higher rate of patients with cardiac 
tamponade with cangrelor (n=2 of which one case was fatal in the cangrelor group versus no cases in the 
clopidogrel group); a warning is currently included in the SmPC. The incidence of fatal bleeding is balanced in all 
studies between the cangrelor and the control groups (0.1% each). The most frequently reported fatal bleeding 
in the cangrelor arm was in the nervous system (n=4) compared to one case reported in the control group.  
Using the GUSTO bleeding scale, more bleedings were reported in the cangrelor group (17.5%) than in the 
clopidogrel group (13.5%); with the highest frequency reported in the mild GUSTO (16.8% vs. 13% 
respectively; p<0.001). The severe/life threatening GUSTO was comparable in both groups at 0.2%. Using the 
ACUITY scale, both major and minor bleedings were significantly more frequent in the cangrelor group 
compared to the clopidogrel group. Bleeding frequency was comparable in the treatment arms across the CAD 
subgroups with the GUSTO classification.  
AEs reported in the different age groups shows comparable rates between cangrelor and the comparator, with 
increasing frequency by increasing age. In all reported studies, there was a numerical increase in renal-related 
AEs  for  cangrelor  of  93/13,301  (0.7%)  vs  64/12,861  (0.5%)  in  the  comparator  arm.  There  is  a  trend  for 
deterioration of renal function as measured by creatinine clearance and GFR mostly in patients with baseline 
severe renal impairment in the cangrelor group compared to the clopidogrel group. Likewise, in such patients, 
there is a higher incidence of moderate GUSTO and major ACUITY bleeding rates reported.  
In  CHAMPION  studies,  dyspnoea  was  reported  in  1.2%  of  patients  in  the  cangrelor  arm  vs  0.4%  in  the 
clopidogrel arm. There were similar overall rates of hypersensitivity events reported with cangrelor (0.7%) vs 
control (0.6%) in all studies, but with a slightly higher incidence of serious cases reported with cangrelor (n=7 
vs.  2  in  the  control  group).  None  of  these  cases  were  fatal.  Analysis  of  these  cases  could  not  exclude  the 
causality of cangrelor.  
Further analysis of data did not reveal AEs related to ventricular pauses or elevations of uric acids, unlike what 
is reported with ticagrelor.  
The incidence of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug in the CHAMPION studies 
was low and comparable in the cangrelor-treated (0.6%) and clopidogrel-treated patients (0.4%). The most 
frequently reported causes were coronary artery dissection/perforation and dyspnea. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Bleeding events were not adjudicated by a blinded committee, which is an important point to prevent bias and 
ensure consistency in a global trial.  Using the ISTH definitions to classify bleedings would have also been 
preferred to the GUSTO scale currently used, as it is more universally accepted.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The mechanism of action of cangrelor as a reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist with a rapid onset and offset of 
action makes it an attractive option to currently available P2Y12 antagonists used during PCI which take from 2-4 
hours (clopidogrel) to 30 minutes (prasugrel and ticagrelor) to act with a longer duration of action after 
discontinuation. This is especially important in acute situations. Also, it could be an alternative when patients 
can not tolerate oral medication. The rapid offset of action is also advantageous in case CABG is considered 
necessary instead of a PCI.  
In the PCI indication, reduction in stent thrombosis contributed to the positive results, specifically (IPST). 
Stent thrombosis may be a valid and acceptable endpoint in a PCI setting as also agreed by the SAG experts. It 
represents a serious, though relatively rare risk of the PCI intervention and should be avoided. ST was validated 
by an independent adjudication Committee that reviewed all angiograms recorded during the procedures.  
Two recent publications adequately describe the prognostic value of IPST, even if resolved within the procedure 
(Brener et al 2013 and Xu et al. 2013). Also, in C-PHOENIX patients who had IPST had a worse prognosis. It can 
be agreed that counting IPST is valuable, but that should be separate from ST.  
Using a more stringent cut-off value of enzyme elevations to define MI, further confirmation of the relevance of 
the positive results was obtained. There is no commonly agreed threshold for biomarker elevation, CK-MB or 
troponin, above which the risk for impaired outcome is evident. It is reassuring that the same trend is observed 
in the PHOENIX study for all different types of MI and when using different MI definitions (e.g. SCAI definition) 
and cut offs. 
Further analysis of the dose and time of initiation of clopidogrel was submitted. Analyses by dose show 
comparable results, with even better results when the 600 mg dose is used. The switch dose in the cangrelor 
arm was consistently 600 mg, which may have favoured the results in this arm. However, the applicant 
explained that 90% of the events occurred during the first 2 hours after randomisation, i.e. before this dose was 
administered. In most of the patients clopidogrel was administered before PCI, with less than a third 
administered it during PCI, and almost none after PCI. These data compare favourably with those from 
TRITON-38 where clopidogrel was administered mostly during PCI. Results presented by time of clopidogrel 
administration show that superiority of cangrelor is not dependent to the timing of clopidogrel administration. 
Further analysis show that clopidogrel efficacy in C-PHOENIX is not compromised by later administration. The 
data are reassuring. The applicant presented the time of administration of clopidogrel per indication: stable 
angina, NSTEMI and STEMI. The results generally do not point to any trend regarding later administration of 
clopidogrel, which would have biased the results favouring cangrelor. In addition, considering the time of onset 
of action of clopidogrel (2-4 hours), it should be administered well upfront of the PCI which may not be possible 
in the acute setting, as also acknowledged by the SAG experts. The design of the C-PHOENIX study may have 
favoured cangrelor; nevertheless, the study is considered reliable and representative of current clinical practice. 
Benefits are more robustly shown for for the subgroup with stable CAD, but not for STEMI and NSTEMI patients. 
This can be due to the limited representation of these subgroups in the study. The choice of clopidogrel as the 
active comparator in ACS  is also not in line with the ESC guideline, but submitted utilisation data in EU show that

clopidogrel is still the major antithrombotic used in the acute setting, validating its use as the active comparator 
in C-PHOENIX when ticagrelor and prasugrel were not available. It was also appreciated by the SAG experts that 
use of ticagrelor and prasugrel in patients with ACS remains limited in some European countries, although it is 
increasing. Furthermore, efficacy of ticagrelor and prasugrel is based on long term efficacy data; their efficacy 
at 48 hours is not specifically investigated. In summary, the use of clopidogrel as a comparator in all three 
subgroups of patients (stable CAD, non-STEMI AND STEMI) is acceptable. Benefits was maintained at 30 days.  
The value of C-PCI and C-PLATFORM studies is limited due to issues associated with the definitions of MI. 
Detection of peri-procedural MI in these studies depended on cardiac markers alone, also only one sample was 
taken before PCI, thus it was not possible to adequately distinguish elevated markers of necrosis (MI) related to 
the event, which triggered the PCI (non-STEMI of STEMI) from elevation due to the procedure.  Reanalysis of 
their data using the updated definition of MI generally support the results of the C-PHOENIX study. The SAG 
experts considered the results of C-PCI and C-PLATFORM of relevance. In particular it was considered reassuring 
that the numerically higher mortality observed in one trial (PHOENIX) is not observed in the other trials.  
Exposure to support safety in the PCI indication is adequate as it is based on a wide database from the 
C-PHOENIX supported by that from C-PCI and C-PLATFORM. The most common AE is bleeding which is expected 
in such studies. The somewhat higher bleeding rate reported in the cangrelor group compared to clopidogrel is 
to be anticipated, considering the superiority in efficacy A significant increase in ACUITY MAJOR bleeding was 
noticed in the ACS subgroup, but this was mainly driven by haematoma ≥ 5 cm at the puncture site. This is 
reassuring. Data at 30 days are not conclusive; in C-PHOENIX a slight increase in total mortality, especially 
deaths related to cardiogenic shock, MI and AMI is shown in the cangrelor arm while an opposite trend is shown 
in both P-PCI and P-PLATFORM. It is difficult to draw any robust conclusions as the data is inconsistent and is not 
supported by significant results but only occasional trends. Also a direct causal pathway denoting  lack of 
efficacy or an associated risk can not be always detected. 
Submitted analysis of net clinical benefit shows that the results are in favour of a benefit for cangrelor.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In the PCI indication, significant benefit is shown in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of stable CAD. The 
benefit in the ACS patients (STEMI and non-STEMI) is less clearly defined.  
During the assessment, the applicant proposed to restrict the indication of PCI to patients for whom oral P2Y12 
inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. These may include 1) patients in the acute phase of cardiovascular illness 
who may experience reduced bioavailability consequent to nausea, use of opiates or impaired gastrointestinal 
perfusion resulting in reduced absorption, 2) patients presenting with an unclear aetiology of chest pain and 
where early administration of a long acting P2Y12 inhibitor may increase clinical risk (ie, aortic dissection, aortic 
rupture, oesophageal tear, pericarditis, 3)  patients referred for angiography and possible PCI who have a 
likelihood of requiring urgent or emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and 4) patients 
requiring PCI while also suffering an active concomitant underlying condition that may require urgent surgery 
that would be delayed by long acting P2Y12 inhibitors (i.e., hip fracture complicated by unstable angina, NSTEMI 
or even STEMI.  
Following discussion and advice received from the SAG experts,  cangrelor was further restricted to patients who 
have not been pre-treated with P2Y12 inhibitors, reflecting the CHAMPION PHOENIX patient population (naïve to 
P2Y12 inhibitors 7 days prior to randomisation).  
With these restrictions, the benefit risk of cangrelor is considered to be positive.

Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Initial assessment of cangrelor in PCI was hampered by the chosen endpoints, the choice of the comparator and 
the duration of the study. Another issue are the implications of the other two studies (C-PCI and C-PLATFORM) 
that were discontinued prematurely due to reasons of futility.  
The above limitations precluded positioning cangrelor as an alternative to the current oral P2Y12 inhibitors. 
However, the proposed restriction of the indication to patients who were not or can not be administered oral 
P2Y12 inhibitors, adequately positions cangrelor in clinical practice.  If a patient has not been pre-treated with 
P2Y12 inhibitors and requires immediate PCI intervention, this patient could be eligible for cangrelor therapy, 
whether suffering from stable or non stable CAD. The most critical element in the decision of therapy would be 
the need to start P2Y12 inhibition immediately as in situations where an ad hoc PCI would be considered in 
patients who have not yet received double anti-platelet therapy. In addition, the IV administration is considered 
useful in patients who cannot swallow (e.g. intubated) or who are vomiting. The fast offset of action is also 
considered useful in order to manage major bleeding if such would occur during the procedure and to terminate 
platelet inhibition in patients who are referred for immediate surgery, although this will be very rare. In all other 
PCI, oral P2Y12 inhibitors should constitute the first line choice in patients undergoing PCI due to the robust 
evidence of their B/R, also documented in the relevant ESC guideline.  
Conclusion 
The overall B/R of cangrelor in the revised indication is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision that 
the risk-benefit balance of Kengrexal, is favourable in the indication,  "co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid 
(ASA), for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in adult patients with coronary artery disease 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the 
PCI procedure and in whom oral therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable."

DIVERGENT POSITION 
The undersigned member(s) of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Kengrexal indicated as follows: 
Kengrexal, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic 
cardiovascular events in adult patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure and in whom oral 
therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. 
The overall benefit-risk balance for Kengrexal in the claimed indication is considered negative based on the 
following : 
This application is based on three pivotal studies (CHAMPION PCI, CHAMPION PLATFORM and CHAMPION 
PHOENIX). Two of the studies were statistically negative.  
The benefit observed in the only positive study (CHAMPION PHOENIX) was obtained at the expenses of 1) 
Myocarcial Infaction which were diagnosed mainly based on biochemical markers and 2) intraprocedural stent 
thrombosis.  
The marginal benefit observed in the CHAMPION PHOENIX study need to be counterbalanced by a clear increase 
in major bleeding in cangrelor arm.  
The narrow major bleeding definition used in the cangrelor clinical development (GUSTO severe/life-threatening 
definition) compared to the ACUITY definition may have play a role favor to this new compound. 
Recent studies have shown that post procedural bleeding has an important prognostic role that is at least not 
inferior to that shown for post-procedural myocardial infarction [Mehran et al. Eur Heart J 2009;30:1457-66; 
Ndrepepa et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2008;51:690-7]. 
In addition, ACS patients, who will be the main target of cangrelor in standard practice, were very limited and 
not adequately represented in the study.  
There are other issues with regards to the study design of CHAMPION PHOENIX that need consideration in 
particular, whether the comparator clopidogrel and its dosing where appropriate, may be debatable. The lack of 
comparison data with prasugrel or ticagrelor remains an issue.  
In this study, the lack of net clinical benefit is also reflected in the lack of trend in benefit with respect to 
all-cause mortality.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for adult patients with inadequately controlled 
hypereosinophilic syndrome without an identifiable non-haematologic secondary cause (see section 
5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Nucala should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma, CRSwNP, EGPA or HES. 
Posology 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 40 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered at 
least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and 
level of control of exacerbations. 
CRSwNP 
Adults 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. Consideration can be given to alternative treatments in 
patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment for CRSwNP. Some patients with 
initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 24 weeks.  
EGPA  
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older  
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
The posology of mepolizumab in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old with EGPA was 
supported by modelling and simulation data (see section 5.2). 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old weighing ≥ 40 kg 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 200 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old weighing < 40 kg  
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks.

Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be reviewed at 
least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and 
improvement of symptom control.  
Patients who develop life-threatening manifestations of EGPA should also be evaluated for the need 
for continued therapy, as Nucala has not been studied in this population. 
HES 
Adults 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be reviewed at 
least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and 
level of symptom control.  
Patients who develop life-threatening manifestations of HES should also be evaluated for the need for 
continued therapy, as Nucala has not been studied in this population.  
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old 
Nucala 100 mg powder for solution for injection and 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
are appropriate for administration to this population. 
Nucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen and 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe are not indicated for administration to this population.

EGPA in children less than 6 years old 
The safety and efficacy of mepolizumab has not been established in children below the age of 6 years 
old. 
No data are available. 
HES in children aged less than 18 years old 
The safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years old have 
not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Nucala 100 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe 
The pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe should be used for subcutaneous injection only. 
Nucala may be self-administered by the patient or administered by a caregiver if their healthcare 
professional determines that it is appropriate, and the patient or caregiver are trained in injection 
techniques. 
For children aged 6 to 11 years old, administration must be carried out by a healthcare professional or 
a trained caregiver. 
For self-administration the recommended injection sites are the abdomen or thigh. A caregiver can 
also inject Nucala into the upper arm. 
For doses which require more than one injection, it is recommended that each injection is 
administered at least 5 cm apart. 
Comprehensive instructions for subcutaneous administration of Nucala in a pre-filled pen or pre-filled 
syringe are provided in the instructions for use in the package leaflet. 
Nucala 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
The pre-filled syringe should be used for subcutaneous injection only.  
Nucala must be administered by a healthcare professional or a caregiver. It may be administered by a 
caregiver if a healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate, and the caregiver is trained in 
injection techniques.  
The recommended injection sites are the upper arm, abdomen or thigh.  
Comprehensive instructions for subcutaneous administration of Nucala in a pre-filled syringe are 
provided in the instructions for use in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Asthma exacerbations 
Mepolizumab should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. 
Asthma-related adverse symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be 
instructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of 
treatment. 
Corticosteroids 
Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of mepolizumab therapy is not 
recommended. Reduction in corticosteroid doses, if required, should be gradual and performed under 
the supervision of a physician. 
Hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions 
Acute and delayed systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, 
angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), have occurred following administration of 
mepolizumab. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances 
have a delayed onset (i.e., typically within several days). These reactions may occur for the first time 
after a long duration of treatment (see section 4.8). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, 
appropriate treatment as clinically indicated should be initiated. 
Parasitic infections 
Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients 
with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before starting therapy. If patients become 
infected whilst receiving treatment with mepolizumab and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, 
temporary discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
Organ threatening or life-threatening EGPA 
Nucala has not been studied in patients with organ threatening or life-threatening manifestations of 
EGPA (see section 4.2). 
Life-threatening HES 
Nucala has not been studied in patients with life-threatening manifestations of HES (see section 4.2). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of mepolizumab. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6), via interaction 
with their cognate receptors on hepatocytes, have been shown to suppress the formation of CYP450 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enzymes and drug transporters, however, elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers in severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma is minimal and there is no evidence of IL-5 receptor alpha expression 
on hepatocytes. The potential for interactions with mepolizumab is therefore considered low. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of mepolizumab in 
pregnant women.  
Mepolizumab crosses the placental barrier in monkeys. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential for harm to a human fetus is unknown. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nucala during pregnancy. 
Administration of Nucala to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the 
mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data regarding the excretion of mepolizumab in human milk. However, mepolizumab 
was excreted into the milk of cynomolgus monkeys at concentrations of less than 0.5% of those 
detected in plasma. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Nucala therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of anti-IL5 treatment 
on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Nucala has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
In placebo-controlled studies in adult and adolescent patients with severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma, the most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache (20%), 
injection site reactions (8%) and back pain (6%).  
CRSwNP 
In a placebo-controlled study in patients with CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse 
reactions during treatment were headache (18%) and back pain (7%).  
EGPA 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a placebo-controlled study in patients with EGPA, the most commonly reported adverse reactions 
during treatment were headache (32%), injection site reactions (15%) and back pain (13%). Systemic 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 4% of EGPA patients.  
HES 
In a placebo-controlled study in patients with HES, the most commonly reported adverse reactions 
during treatment were headache (13%), urinary tract infection (9%), injection site reactions and 
pyrexia (7% each). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table below presents the adverse reactions from placebo-controlled severe eosinophilic asthma 
studies from patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously (SC) (n=263), from a 
randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled 52-week study in patients with CRSwNP receiving 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC (n=206), in patients with EGPA receiving mepolizumab 300 mg SC (n=68), 
in a double-blind placebo-controlled 32-week study in patients with HES receiving mepolizumab 
300 mg SC (n= 54), and from spontaneous post-marketing reports. Safety data is also available from 
open-label extension studies in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) treated for a 
median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years). The safety profile of mepolizumab in HES patients 
(n=102) enrolled in a 20-week open label extension study was similar to the safety profile of patients 
in the pivotal placebo-controlled study. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

myalgia; these manifestations were reported infrequently and in <1% of patients receiving 
mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in CRSwNP 
In the 52-week placebo-controlled study, systemic allergic (type I hypersensitivity) reactions were 
reported in 2 patients (<1%) in the group receiving mepolizumab 100 mg and in no patients in the 
placebo group. Other systemic reactions were reported by no patients in the group receiving 
mepolizumab 100 mg and in 1 patient (<1%) in the placebo group. 
Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in EGPA 
In the 52-week placebo-controlled study the percentage of patients who experienced systemic 
(allergic and non-allergic) reactions was 6% in the group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab and 1% 
in the placebo group. Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 4% of patients in 
the group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab and 1% of patients in the placebo group. Systemic non-
allergic reactions (angioedema) were reported by 1 (1%) patient in the group receiving 300 mg of 
mepolizumab and no patients in the placebo group.  
Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in HES  
In the 32-week placebo-controlled study, 1 patient (2%) reported a systemic (other) reaction in the 
group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab (multifocal skin reaction) and no patients in the placebo 
group.  
Local injection site reactions 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
In placebo-controlled studies the incidence of local injection site reactions with mepolizumab 100 mg 
subcutaneous and placebo was 8% and 3%, respectively. These events were all non-serious, mild to 
moderate in intensity and the majority resolved within a few days. Local injection site reactions 
occurred mainly at the start of treatment and within the first 3 injections with fewer reports on 
subsequent injections. The most common manifestations reported with these events included pain, 
erythema, swelling, itching, and burning sensation. 
CRSwNP 
In the placebo-controlled study, local injection site reactions (e.g., erythema, pruritus) occurred in 2% 
of patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg compared with <1% in patients receiving placebo. 
EGPA 
In the placebo-controlled study, local injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, swelling) occurred 
at a rate of 15% in patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg compared with 13% in patients receiving 
placebo. 
HES 
In the placebo-controlled study, local injection site reactions (e.g., burning, itching) occurred at a rate 
of 7% in patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg compared with 4% in patients receiving placebo. 
Paediatric population

Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Thirty-seven adolescents (aged 12-17) were enrolled in four placebo-controlled studies (25 
mepolizumab treated intravenously or subcutaneously) of 24 to 52 weeks duration. Thirty -six 
paediatric patients (aged 6-11) received mepolizumab subcutaneously in an open-label study for 12 
weeks. After a treatment interruption of 8 weeks, 30 of these patients, received mepolizumab for a 
further 52 weeks. The safety profile was similar to that seen in adults. No additional adverse reactions 
were identified. 
HES 
Four adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were enrolled in the placebo-controlled study 200622, one 
adolescent received 300 mg of mepolizumab, and 3 adolescents received placebo for 32 weeks. All 4 
adolescents continued into a 20-week open-label extension study 205203 (see Section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of up to 1 500 mg were administered intravenously in a clinical trial to patients with 
eosinophilic disease without evidence of dose-related toxicities. 
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with mepolizumab. If overdose occurs, the patient 
should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX09.  
Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa), which targets human interleukin-5 
(IL-5) with high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and 
differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab inhibits the 
bioactivity of IL-5 with nanomolar potency by blocking the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the 
IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling and 
reducing the production and survival of eosinophils. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma (adults/adolescents), following a dose of 100 
mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a 
geometric mean count at baseline of 290 to 40 cells/μL at week 32 (n=182), a reduction of 84% 
compared to placebo. This magnitude of blood eosinophils reduction was maintained in severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 
4.5 years) in open-label extension studies.  
In children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma administered 
mepolizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a 
geometric mean count at baseline to week 52 of 306 (n=16) to 48 (n=15) following 40 mg (for a 
weight < 40kg) and 331 to 44 cells/µL (n=10) following 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), a reduction 
from baseline of 85% and 87%, respectively. 
In adults, adolescents and children, this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of 
treatment. 
CRSwNP 
In patients with CRSwNP, following a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously 
every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at baseline 
to week 52 of 390 (n=206) to 60 cells/µL (n=126), which corresponds to a geometric mean reduction 
of 83% compared to placebo. This magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment 
and was maintained throughout the treatment period of 52 weeks. 
EGPA 
In patients with EGPA, following a 300 mg dose of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously every 
4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at baseline of 
177 (n=68) to 38 cells/µL (n=64) at week 52. There was a geometric mean reduction of 83% 
compared to placebo and this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment. 
HES 
In patients with HES (adults/adolescents), following a 300 mg dose of mepolizumab administered 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophil reduction was observed within 2 weeks 
of treatment.  At week 32, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at baseline of 
1 460 (n=54) to 70 cells/µL (n=48) and a geometric mean reduction of 92% compared to placebo was 
observed. This magnitude of reduction was maintained for a further 20 weeks in patients that 
continued mepolizumab treatment in the open-label extension study. 
Immunogenicity  
Severe eosinophilic asthma, CRSwNP, EGPA and HES 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide therapeutics, patients 
may develop antibodies to mepolizumab following treatment. In the placebo-controlled trials, 15/260 
(6%) of adults and adolescents with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma treated with 100 mg dose, 
6/196 (3%) of adults with CRSwNP treated with 100 mg dose, 1/68 (<2%) of adults with EGPA 
treated with 300 mg dose and 1/53 (2%) of adults and adolescents with HES treated with 300 mg dose 
of mepolizumab subcutaneously had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at 
least one dose of mepolizumab.  
The immunogenicity profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients 
(n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) or in HES patients (n=102) 
treated for 20 weeks in open-label extension studies was similar to that observed in the placebo-
controlled studies. 
In children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma following either 40 mg 
subcutaneously (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg subcutaneously (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), 2/35 (6%) had 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of mepolizumab 
during the initial short phase of the study. No children had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies 
during the long-term phase of the study.  
Neutralising antibodies were detected in one adult patient with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
and in no patients with CRSwNP, EGPA or HES. Anti-mepolizumab antibodies did not discernibly 
impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab in the majority of patients and 
there was no evidence of a correlation between antibody titres and change in blood eosinophil level. 
Clinical efficacy  
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
The efficacy of mepolizumab in the treatment of a targeted group of patients with severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group clinical studies of 
between 24-52 weeks duration, in patients aged 12 years and older. These patients either remained 
uncontrolled (at least two severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months) on their current standard of 
care, including at least high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus an additional maintenance 
treatment(s), or were dependent on systemic corticosteroids. Additional maintenance treatments 
included long-acting beta2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), leukotriene modifiers, long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), theophylline, and oral corticosteroids (OCS). 
The two exacerbations studies MEA112997 and MEA115588 enrolled a total of 1 192 patients, 60% 
females, with a mean age of 49 years (range 12– 82). The proportion of patients on maintenance OCS 
was 31% and 24%, respectively. Patients were required to have a history of two or more severe 
asthma exacerbations requiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment in the past 12 months and 
reduced lung function at baseline (pre-bronchodilator FEV1<80% in adults and <90% in adolescents). 
The mean number of exacerbations in the previous year was 3.6 and the mean predicted pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 was 60%. Patients continued to receive their existing asthma medicinal product 
during the studies. 
For the oral corticosteroid-sparing study MEA115575, a total of 135 patients were enrolled (55% 
were female; mean age of 50 years) who were being treated daily with OCS (5-35 mg per day), and 
high-dose ICS plus an additional maintenance medicinal product. 
Dose-ranging efficacy MEA112997 (DREAM) study 
In MEA112997, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study of 
52 weeks duration in 616 patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab 
significantly reduced clinically significant asthma exacerbations (defined as worsening of asthma 
requiring use of oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation and/or emergency department 
visits) when administered in doses of 75 mg, 250 mg or 750 mg intravenously compared to placebo 
(see Table 1).

MEA115588 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study 
which evaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add-on therapy in 576 patients with severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma defined as peripheral blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 
150 cells/μL at initiation of treatment or greater than or equal to 300 cells/μL within the past 12 
months. 
Patients received mepolizumab 100 mg administered subcutaneously, mepolizumab 75 mg 
administered intravenously or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over 32 weeks. The primary 
endpoint was the frequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma and the reductions for 
both mepolizumab treatment arms compared to placebo were statistically significant (p<0.001). Table 
2 provides the results of the primary and secondary endpoints for patients treated with subcutaneous 
mepolizumab or placebo.

Reduction of exacerbation rate by baseline blood eosinophil count 
Table 3 shows the results of a combined analysis of the two exacerbation studies (MEA112997 and 
MEA115588) by baseline blood eosinophil count. The rate of exacerbations in the placebo arm 
increased with increasing baseline blood eosinophil count. The reduction rate with mepolizumab was 
greater in patients with higher blood eosinophil counts.

Oral corticosteroid reduction study MEA115575 (SIRIUS) 
MEA115575 evaluated the effect of mepolizumab 100 mg administered subcutaneously on reducing 
the requirement for maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) while maintaining asthma control in 
subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. Patients had a blood eosinophil count of ≥150/µL 
at baseline or a blood eosinophil count of ≥300/µL in the 12 months prior to screening. Patients were 
administered mepolizumab or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over the treatment period. 
Patients continued to receive their existing asthma medicinal product during the study with the 
exception of their OCS dose which was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase 
(Weeks 4-20), as long as asthma control was maintained.

A total of 135 patients were enrolled: mean age was 50 years, 55% were female, and 48% had been 
receiving oral steroid therapy for at least 5 years. The baseline mean prednisone equivalent dose was 
approximately 13 mg per day. 
The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in daily OCS dose (weeks 20-24), whilst maintaining 
asthma control by defined dose reduction categories (see Table 4). Predefined categories included 
percent reductions ranging from 90-100% reduction, to no decrease in the prednisone dose from the 
end of the optimisation phase. The comparison between mepolizumab and placebo was statistically 
significant (p=0.008).

Open-label extension studies in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma MEA115666 (COLUMBA), 
MEA115661 (COSMOS) and 201312 (COSMEX)  
The long-term efficacy profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients 
(n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension studies 
MEA115666, MEA115661 and 201312 was generally consistent with the 3 placebo-controlled 
studies. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 205687 (SYNAPSE) was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
which evaluated 407 patients aged 18 years and older with CRSwNP.  
Patients enrolled in the study were required to have a nasal obstruction VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) 
symptom score of >5 out of a maximum score of 10, an overall VAS symptom score >7 out of a 
maximum score of 10 and an endoscopic bilateral NP score of ≥5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with 
a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavity). Patients must also have had a history of at least one prior 
surgery for nasal polyps in the previous 10 years. 
Key baseline characteristics included total endoscopic NP score mean (SD) 5.5 (1.29), nasal 
obstruction VAS score mean (SD) 9.0 (0.83), overall VAS symptom score mean (SD) 9.1 (0.74), loss 
of smell VAS score mean (SD) 9.7 (0.72) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) mean (SD) 64.1 
(18.32). The geometric mean eosinophil count was 390 cells/mcL (95% CI: 360, 420). In addition, 
27% of patients had aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and 48% of patients had at least 
1 course of OCS for CRSwNP in the past 12 months. 
Patients received a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab or placebo, administered subcutaneously once 
every 4 weeks in addition to background intranasal corticosteroid therapy. 
The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score at week 52 and 
change from baseline in mean nasal obstruction VAS score during weeks 49-52. The key secondary 
endpoint was the time to first NP surgery up to Week 52 (surgery was defined as any procedure 
involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue [e.g. polypectomy] in the nasal 
cavity). Patients who received mepolizumab had significantly greater improvements (decreases) in 
total endoscopic NP score at Week 52 and in nasal obstruction VAS score during weeks 49-52 
compared to placebo, and all secondary endpoints were statistically significant in favour of 
mepolizumab (see Table 5 and Figure 1).

Time to first NP surgery 
Across the 52-week treatment period, patients in the mepolizumab group had a lower probability of 
undergoing NP surgery than patients in the placebo group. The risk of surgery over the treatment 
period was significantly lower by 57% for patients treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo 
(Hazard Ratio: 0.43; 95% CI 0.25, 0.76; p=0.003).

Time to Event (Weeks) 
CRSwNP patients with co-morbid asthma 
In 289 (71%) patients with co-morbid asthma, pre-specified analyses showed improvements in the co-
primary endpoints consistent with those seen in the overall population in the patients who received 
mepolizumab 100 mg compared with placebo. Additionally in these patients, there was a greater 
improvement from baseline at Week 52 in asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ-5) for mepolizumab 100 mg compared with placebo (median change [Q1, Q3] of 
-0.80 [-2.20, 0.00] and 0.00 [-1.10, 0.20], respectively).  
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
MEA115921 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study which evaluated 
136 adult patients with EGPA, who had a history of relapsing or refractory disease, and who were on 
stable oral corticosteroid therapy (OCS; ≥7.5 to ≤50 mg/day prednisolone/prednisone), with or 
without stable immunosuppressant therapy (excluding cyclophosphamide). Other background 
standard of care therapy was allowed during the study. Fifty-three percent (n=72) were also on 
concomitant stable immunosuppressant therapy. Patients with organ threatening or life-threatening 
EGPA were excluded from study MEA115921. 
Patients either received a 300 mg dose of mepolizumab or placebo administered subcutaneously once 
every 4 weeks in addition to their background prednisolone/prednisone with or without 
immunosuppressive therapy. The OCS dose was tapered at the discretion of the investigator. 
Remission 
The co- primary endpoints were the total accrued duration of remission, defined as a Birmingham 
Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) =0 plus prednisolone/prednisone dose ≤4 mg/day, and the 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of patients in remission at both 36 and 48 weeks of treatment. BVAS=0 represents no 
active vasculitis. 
Compared with placebo, patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg achieved a significantly greater 
accrued time in remission. Additionally, compared to placebo, a significantly higher proportion of 
patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg achieved remission at both Week 36 and Week 48 (Table 6). 
For both co-primary endpoints, compared with placebo, the beneficial effect observed following 
mepolizumab 300 mg treatment was present irrespective of if patients were receiving 
immunosuppressant therapy in addition to background corticosteroids. 
Using the secondary endpoint remission definition of BVAS=0 plus prednisolone/prednisone 
≤7.5 mg/day, patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg also achieved significantly greater accrued time 
in remission (p<0.001), and a higher proportion of patients were in remission at both Week 36 and 
Week 48 (p<0.001), compared to placebo.

Relapse 
Compared with placebo, the time to first relapse was significantly longer for patients receiving 
mepolizumab 300 mg (p<0.001). Additionally, patients receiving mepolizumab had a 50% reduction 
in annualised relapse rate compared with placebo: 1.14 vs 2.27, respectively. 
Oral corticosteroid reduction 
Patients treated with mepolizumab had a significantly lower average daily OCS during Weeks 48-52 
compared with patients who received placebo. During Weeks 48 to 52, 59% and 44% of patients 
treated with mepolizumab achieved an average daily OCS dose of ≤7.5 mg and ≤4 mg respectively 
compared with 33% and 7% in the placebo group. 18% of patients in the mepolizumab group were 
able to taper off OCS completely compared with 3% in the placebo group. 
Asthma Control Questionnaire – 6 (ACQ-6)

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
Study 200622 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 32-week study which evaluated 
108 patients ≥12 years old with HES. Patients received 300 mg of mepolizumab, or placebo 
administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks while continuing their HES therapy. In study 
200622, HES therapy included but was not limited to OCS, immunosuppressive, cytotoxic therapy or 
other symptomatic therapies associated with HES such as omeprazole. 
Patients entering the study had experienced at least two HES flares within the past 12 months and had 
a blood eosinophil count ≥1 000 cells/µL during screening. Patients who were FIP1L1-PDGFRα 
kinase-positive were excluded from the study. 
The primary endpoint of study 200622 was the proportion of patients who experienced a HES flare 
during the 32-week treatment period. A HES flare was defined as worsening of clinical signs and 
symptoms of HES resulting in the need to increase OCS or increase/add cytotoxic or 
immunosuppressive HES therapy or receiving blinded active OCS due to increased blood eosinophils 
(on ≥2 occasions).  
The primary analysis compared patients who experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study in 
the mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups. Over the 32-week treatment period, 50% fewer 
patients experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study when treated with 300 mg mepolizumab 
compared with placebo; 28% versus 56% respectively (OR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.64) (see Table 7). 
Secondary endpoints were time to first HES flare, proportion of patients who experienced a HES flare 
during Week 20 through Week 32, rate of HES flares and change from baseline in fatigue severity. 
All secondary endpoints were statistically significant and provided support for the primary endpoint 
(see Figure 2 and Table 8).

Open-label extension (OLE) 
Study 205203 was a 20-week open-label extension of Study 200622. HES therapy was allowed to be 
adjusted per local standard of care while maintaining mepolizumab 300 mg treatment starting at Week 
4. In this study the effect of treatment with mepolizumab on the reduction of HES flares reported 
during Study 200622 was sustained for patients who continued mepolizumab treatment in study 
205203, in which 94% (47/50) of patients did not experience a flare. 
In the 72 patients requiring OCS during Weeks 0 to 4 of the OLE, 28% of patients achieved a mean 
daily dose OCS dose reduction of ≥50% during Weeks 16 to 20. 
Paediatric population 
Severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
In MEA115588 and in the double-blind placebo-controlled study 200862, there were 34 adolescents 
(12 to 17 years old). Of these 34 subjects: 12 received placebo, 9 received mepolizumab 75 mg 
intravenously, and 13 received 100 mg subcutaneously. In a combined analysis of these studies, a 
40% reduction in clinically significant exacerbations was observed in adolescents following 
mepolizumab treatment compared to placebo (rate ratio 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17, 2.10). 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
The are no clinical data available in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old. 
HES 
Four adolescents (12 to 17 years old) were enrolled in study 200622; one adolescent received 
mepolizumab 300 mg, and 3 adolescents received placebo for 32 weeks. The one adolescent treated 
with mepolizumab in the 32-week Study 200622 did not have a HES flare. All 4 adolescents that 
completed study 200622 continued into a 20-week open-label extension study 205203 in which one of 
the 4 adolescents experienced one HES flare. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Following subcutaneous dosing in patients with asthma and CRSwNP, mepolizumab exhibited 
approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 12.5 mg to 250 mg. 
Subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 300 mg had approximately three times the systemic 
exposure of mepolizumab 100 mg. Following administration of a single 100 mg subcutaneous dose in 
healthy subjects, mepolizumab systemic exposure was comparable between formulations. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration to healthy subjects or patients with asthma, mepolizumab was 
absorbed slowly with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) ranging from 4 to 
8 days. 
Following a single subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, thigh or arm of healthy subjects, 
mepolizumab absolute bioavailability was 64%, 71% and 75%, respectively. In patients with asthma 
the absolute bioavailability of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in the arm ranged from 74-
80%. Following repeat subcutaneous administration every 4 weeks, there is approximately a two-fold 
accumulation at steady state. 
Distribution 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, mepolizumab distributes into a 
mean volume of distribution of 55 to 85 mL/kg. 
Biotransformation 
Mepolizumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are 
widely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue. 
Elimination 
Following a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, the mean systemic clearance 
(CL) ranged from 1.9 to 3.3 mL/day/kg, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 20 days. 
Following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 
16 to 22 days. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis estimated mepolizumab systemic clearance 
was 3.1 mL/day/kg. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data available in elderly patients (≥65 years old) across all clinical 
studies (N=90). However, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no indications of an 
effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab over the age range of 12 to 82 years. 
Renal impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no dose 
adjustment is required in patients with creatinine clearance values between 50-80 mL/min. There are 
limited data available in patients with creatinine clearance values <50 mL/min. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic 
enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect 
on the elimination of mepolizumab. 
Paediatric population  
Severe eosinophilic asthma and HES 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data available in the paediatric population (59 patients with 
eosinophilic esophagitis, 55 patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma and 1 patient with 
HES). Intravenous mepolizumab pharmacokinetics was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic 
analysis in a paediatric study conducted in patients aged 2–17 years old with eosinophilic esophagitis. 
Paediatric pharmacokinetics was largely predictable from adults, after taking into account 
bodyweight. Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics in adolescent patients with severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma or HES included in the phase 3 studies were consistent with adults (see section 
4.2). 
Paediatric pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration in patients 6 to 11 years old with 
severe refractory eosinophilic asthma was investigated in an open label, uncontrolled study of 12-
weeks duration. Paediatric pharmacokinetics were broadly consistent with adults and adolescents after 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accounting for bodyweight and bioavailability. The absolute subcutaneous bioavailability appears 
complete compared to that observed in adults and adolescents of 76%. Exposure following 
subcutaneous administration of either 40 mg (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg) 
was 1.32 and 1.97 times of that observed in adults at 100 mg. 
Investigation of a 40 mg subcutaneous dosing regimen administered every 4 weeks in children 6 to 11 
years old over a 15-70 kg broad weight range by PK modelling and simulation predicts that the 
exposure of this dosing regimen would remain on average within 38% of adults at 100 mg. This 
dosing regimen is considered acceptable due to the wide therapeutic index of mepolizumab. 
EGPA 
Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics in children (6 to 17 years old) with EGPA were predicted using 
modelling and simulation, based on pharmacokinetics in other eosinophilic diseases, and are expected 
to be consistent with those observed in children with severe eosinophilic asthma. The recommended 
posology in children 6 to 11 years old over a 15-70 kg broad weight range predicts that the exposure 
would remain on average within 26% of adults at 300 mg. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
As mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been 
conducted. 
Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Intravenous and subcutaneous 
administration to monkeys was associated with reductions in peripheral and lung eosinophil counts, 
with no toxicological findings. 
Eosinophils are thought to be associated with immune system responses to some parasitic infections. 
Studies conducted in mice treated with anti-IL-5 antibodies or genetically deficient in IL-5 or 
eosinophils have not shown impaired ability to clear parasitic infections. The relevance of these 
findings for humans is unknown. 
Fertility 
No impairment of fertility was observed in a fertility and general reproduction toxicity study in mice 
performed with an analogous antibody that inhibits IL-5 in mice. This study did not include a littering 
or functional offspring assessment. 
Pregnancy 
In monkeys, mepolizumab had no effect on pregnancy or on embryonic/fetal and postnatal 
development (including immune function) of the offspring. Examinations for internal or skeletal 
malformations were not performed. Data in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrate that mepolizumab 
crossed the placenta. Concentrations of mepolizumab were about 1.2-2.4 times higher in infants than 
in mothers for several months post partum and did not affect the immune system of the infants.

Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 40 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be considered at 
least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and 
level of control of exacerbations. 
CRSwNP 
Adults 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. Consideration can be given to alternative treatments in 
patients who have shown no response after 24 weeks of treatment for CRSwNP. Some patients with 
initial partial response may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 24 weeks.  
EGPA  
Adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older  
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
The posology of mepolizumab in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old with EGPA was 
supported by modelling and simulation data (see section 5.2). 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old weighing ≥ 40 kg 
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 200 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Children aged 6 to 11 years old weighing < 40 kg  
The recommended dose of mepolizumab is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. 
Nucala is intended for long-term treatment. The need for continued therapy should be reviewed at 
least on an annual basis as determined by physician assessment of the patient’s disease severity and 
improvement of symptom control. 
Patients who develop life-threatening manifestations of EGPA should also be evaluated for the need 
for continued therapy, as Nucala has not been studied in this population.

The safety and efficacy of mepolizumab has not been established in children below the age of 6 years 
old.  
No data are available. 
HES in children aged less than 18 years old 
The safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years old have 
not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.  
Method of administration 
Nucala is for subcutaneous injection only and should be administered by a healthcare professional. It 
may be injected into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For doses which require more than one injection, it is recommended that each injection is 
administered at least 5 cm apart. 
The powder should be reconstituted prior to administration and the reconstituted solution should be 
used immediately. For instructions on the reconstitution of the medicinal product before 
administration, see section 6.6. 
Each vial of mepolizumab should be used for a single patient, and any remainder of the vial should be 
discarded. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Asthma exacerbations 
Mepolizumab should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. 
Asthma-related adverse symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be 
instructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of 
treatment. 
Corticosteroids 
Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of mepolizumab therapy is not 
recommended. Reduction in corticosteroid doses, if required, should be gradual and performed under 
the supervision of a physician. 
Hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions 
Acute and delayed systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, 
angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), have occurred following administration of 
mepolizumab. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances 
have a delayed onset (i.e., typically within several days). These reactions may occur for the first time 
after a long duration of treatment (see section 4.8). In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, 
appropriate treatment as clinically indicated should be initiated. 
Parasitic infections 
Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients 
with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before starting therapy. If patients become 
infected whilst receiving treatment with mepolizumab and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, 
temporary discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
Organ threatening or life-threatening EGPA 
Nucala has not been studied in patients with organ threatening or life-threatening manifestations of 
EGPA (see section 4.2). 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Life-threatening HES 
Nucala has not been studied in patients with life-threatening manifestations of HES (see section 4.2). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg dose, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of mepolizumab. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6), via interaction 
with their cognate receptors on hepatocytes, have been shown to suppress the formation of CYP450 
enzymes and drug transporters, however, elevation of systemic pro-inflammatory markers in severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma is minimal and there is no evidence of IL-5 receptor alpha expression 
on hepatocytes. The potential for interactions with mepolizumab is therefore considered low. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of mepolizumab in 
pregnant women.  
Mepolizumab crosses the placental barrier in monkeys. Animal studies do not indicate reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential for harm to a human fetus is unknown. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nucala during pregnancy. 
Administration of Nucala to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the 
mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data regarding the excretion of mepolizumab in human milk. However, mepolizumab 
was excreted into the milk of cynomolgus monkeys at concentrations of less than 0.5% of those 
detected in plasma. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Nucala therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Animal studies showed no adverse effects of anti-IL5 treatment 
on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Nucala has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Summary of the safety profile 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
In placebo-controlled studies in adult and adolescent patients with severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma, the most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache (20%), 
injection site reactions (8%) and back pain (6%).  
CRSwNP 
In a placebo-controlled study in patients with CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse 
reactions during treatment were headache (18%) and back pain (7%).  
EGPA 
In a placebo-controlled study in patients with EGPA, the most commonly reported adverse reactions 
during treatment were headache (32%), injection site reactions (15%) and back pain (13%). Systemic 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 4% of EGPA patients. 
HES 
In a placebo-controlled study in patients with HES, the most commonly reported adverse reactions 
during treatment were headache (13%), urinary tract infection (9%), injection site reactions and 
pyrexia (7% each). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table below presents the adverse reactions from placebo-controlled severe eosinophilic asthma 
studies from patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously (SC) (n= 263), from a 
randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled 52-week study in patients with CRSwNP receiving 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC (n=206), in patients with EGPA receiving mepolizumab 300 mg SC (n=68), 
in a double-blind placebo-controlled 32-week study in patients with HES receiving mepolizumab 
300 mg SC (n= 54), and from spontaneous post-marketing reports. Safety data is also available from 
open-label extension studies in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients (n=998) treated for a 
median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years). The safety profile of mepolizumab in HES patients 
(n=102) enrolled in a 20-week open label extension study was similar to the safety profile of patients 
in the pivotal placebo-controlled study. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in CRSwNP 
In the 52-week placebo-controlled study, systemic allergic (type I hypersensitivity) reactions were 
reported in 2 patients (<1%) in the group receiving mepolizumab 100 mg and in no patients in the 
placebo group. Other systemic reactions were reported by no patients in the group receiving 
mepolizumab 100 mg and in 1 patient (<1%) in the placebo group. 
Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in EGPA 
In the 52-week placebo-controlled study the percentage of patients who experienced systemic 
(allergic and non-allergic) reactions was 6% in the group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab and 1% 
in the placebo group. Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 4% of patients in 
the group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab and 1% of patients in the placebo group. Systemic non-
allergic reactions (angioedema) were reported by 1 (1%) patient in the group receiving 300 mg of 
mepolizumab and no patients in the placebo group. 
Systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in HES  
In the 32-week placebo-controlled study, 1 patient (2%) reported a systemic (other) reaction in the 
group receiving 300 mg of mepolizumab (multifocal skin reaction) and no patients in the placebo 
group.  
Local injection site reactions 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
In placebo-controlled studies the incidence of local injection site reactions with mepolizumab 100 mg 
subcutaneous and placebo was 8% and 3%, respectively. These events were all non-serious, mild to 
moderate in intensity and the majority resolved within a few days. Local injection site reactions 
occurred mainly at the start of treatment and within the first 3 injections with fewer reports on 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subsequent injections. The most common manifestations reported with these events included pain, 
erythema, swelling, itching, and burning sensation. 
CRSwNP 
In the placebo-controlled study, local injection site reactions (e.g., erythema, pruritus) occurred in 2% 
of patients receiving mepolizumab 100 mg compared with <1% in patients receiving placebo. 
EGPA 
In the placebo-controlled study, local injection site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, swelling) occurred 
at a rate of 15% in patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg compared with 13% in patients receiving 
placebo. 
HES 
In the placebo-controlled study, local injection site reactions (e.g., burning, itching) occurred at a rate 
of 7% in patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg compared with 4% in patients receiving placebo. 
Paediatric population 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Thirty-seven adolescents (aged 12-17) were enrolled in four placebo-controlled studies (25 
mepolizumab treated intravenously or subcutaneously) of 24 to 52 weeks duration. Thirty -six 
paediatric patients (aged 6-11) received mepolizumab subcutaneously in an open-label study for 12 
weeks. After a treatment interruption of 8 weeks, 30 of these patients, received mepolizumab for a 
further 52 weeks. The safety profile was similar to that seen in adults. No additional adverse reactions 
were identified. 
HES 
Four adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were enrolled in the placebo-controlled study 200622, one 
adolescent received 300 mg of mepolizumab, and 3 adolescents received placebo for 32 weeks. All 4 
adolescents continued into a 20-week open-label extension study 205203 (see Section 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of up to 1 500 mg were administered intravenously in a clinical trial to patients with 
eosinophilic disease without evidence of dose-related toxicities. 
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with mepolizumab. If overdose occurs, the patient 
should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons 
centre, where available.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX09.  
Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa), which targets human interleukin-5 
(IL-5) with high affinity and specificity. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and 
differentiation, recruitment, activation and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab inhibits the 
bioactivity of IL-5 with nanomolar potency by blocking the binding of IL-5 to the alpha chain of the 
IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling and 
reducing the production and survival of eosinophils. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
In patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma (adults/adolescents), following a dose of 
100 mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced 
from a geometric mean count at baseline of 290 to 40 cells/µL at week 32 (n=182), a reduction of 
84% compared to placebo.  
This magnitude of blood eosinophils reduction was maintained in severe refractory eosinophilic 
asthma patients (n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label 
extension studies. 
In children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma administered 
mepolizumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a 
geometric mean count at baseline to week 52 of 306 (n=16) to 48 (n=15) following 40 mg (for a 
weight < 40kg) and 331 to 44 cells/µL (n=10) following 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), a reduction 
from baseline of 85% and 87%, respectively. 
In adults, adolescents and children, this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of 
treatment. 
CRSwNP 
In patients with CRSwNP, following a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously 
every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at baseline 
to week 52 of 390 (n=206) to 60 cells/µL (n=126), which corresponds to a geometric mean reduction 
of 83% compared to placebo. This magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment 
and was maintained throughout the treatment period of 52 weeks. 
EGPA 
In patients with EGPA, following a 300 mg dose of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously every 
4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at baseline of 
177 (n=68) to 38 cells/µL (n=64) at week 52. There was a geometric mean reduction of 83% 
compared to placebo and this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment. 
HES 
In patients with HES (adults/adolescents), following a 300 mg dose of mepolizumab administered 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophil reduction was observed within 2 weeks 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of treatment.  At week 32, blood eosinophils were reduced from a geometric mean count at baseline of 
1 460 (n=54) to 70 cells/µL (n=48) and a geometric mean reduction of 92% compared to placebo was 
observed. This magnitude of reduction was maintained for a further 20 weeks in patients that 
continued mepolizumab treatment in the open-label extension study. 
Immunogenicity  
Severe eosinophilic asthma, CRSwNP, EGPA and HES 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide therapeutics, patients 
may develop antibodies to mepolizumab following treatment. In the placebo-controlled trials, 15/260 
(6%) of adults and adolescents with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma treated with 100 mg dose, 
6/196 (3%) of adults with CRSwNP treated with 100 mg dose, 1/68 (<2%) of adults with EGPA 
treated with 300 mg dose and 1/53 (2%) of adults and adolescents with HES treated with 300 mg dose 
of mepolizumab subcutaneously had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at 
least one dose of mepolizumab.  
The immunogenicity profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients 
(n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) or in HES patients (n=102) 
treated for 20 weeks in open-label extension studies was similar to that observed in the placebo-
controlled studies. 
In children aged 6 to 11 years old with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma following either 40 mg 
subcutaneously (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg subcutaneously (for a weight ≥ 40 kg), 2/35 (6%) had 
detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of mepolizumab 
during the initial short phase of the study. No children had detectable anti-mepolizumab antibodies 
during the long-term phase of the study. Neutralising antibodies were detected in one adult patient 
with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma and in no patients with CRSwNP, EGPA or HES. Anti-
mepolizumab antibodies did not discernibly impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
mepolizumab in the majority of patients and there was no evidence of a correlation between antibody 
titres and change in blood eosinophil level. 
Clinical efficacy  
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
The efficacy of mepolizumab in the treatment of a targeted group of patients with severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma was evaluated in 3 randomised, double-blind, parallel-group clinical studies of 
between 24-52 weeks duration, in patients aged 12 years and older. These patients either remained 
uncontrolled (at least two severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months) on their current standard of 
care, including at least high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus an additional maintenance 
treatment(s), or were dependent on systemic corticosteroids. Additional maintenance treatments 
included long-acting beta2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA), leukotriene modifiers, long-acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), theophylline, and oral corticosteroids (OCS). 
The two exacerbations studies MEA112997 and MEA115588 enrolled a total of 1 192 patients, 60% 
females, with a mean age of 49 years (range 12– 82). The proportion of patients on maintenance OCS 
was 31% and 24%, respectively. Patients were required to have a history of two or more severe 
asthma exacerbations requiring oral or systemic corticosteroid treatment in the past 12 months and 
reduced lung function at baseline (pre-bronchodilator FEV1<80% in adults and <90% in adolescents). 
The mean number of exacerbations in the previous year was 3.6 and the mean predicted pre-
bronchodilator FEV1 was 60%. Patients continued to receive their existing asthma medicinal product 
during the studies. 
For the oral corticosteroid-sparing study MEA115575, a total of 135 patients were enrolled (55% 
were female; mean age of 50 years) who were being treated daily with OCS (5-35 mg per day), and 
high-dose ICS plus an additional maintenance medicinal product.

Dose-ranging efficacy MEA112997 (DREAM) study 
In MEA112997, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study of 
52 weeks duration in 616 patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, mepolizumab 
significantly reduced clinically significant asthma exacerbations (defined as worsening of asthma 
requiring use of oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation and/or emergency department 
visits) when administered in doses of 75 mg, 250 mg or 750 mg intravenously compared to placebo 
(see Table 1).

Exacerbation reduction MEA115588 (MENSA) study  
MEA115588 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study 
which evaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as add-on therapy in 576 patients with severe 
refractory eosinophilic asthma defined as peripheral blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 
150 cells/μL at initiation of treatment or greater than or equal to 300 cells/μL within the past 12 
months. 
Patients received mepolizumab 100 mg administered subcutaneously, mepolizumab 75 mg 
administered intravenously or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over 32 weeks. The primary 
endpoint was the frequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma and the reductions for 
both mepolizumab treatment arms compared to placebo were statistically significant (p<0.001). Table 
2 provides the results of the primary and secondary endpoints for patients treated with subcutaneous 
mepolizumab or placebo.

Oral corticosteroid reduction study MEA115575 (SIRIUS) 
MEA115575 evaluated the effect of mepolizumab 100 mg administered subcutaneously on reducing 
the requirement for maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) while maintaining asthma control in 
subjects with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma. Patients had a blood eosinophil count of ≥150/µL 
at baseline or a blood eosinophil count of ≥300/µL in the 12 months prior to screening. Patients were 
administered mepolizumab or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks over the treatment period. 
Patients continued to receive their existing asthma medicinal product during the study with the 
exception of their OCS dose which was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase 
(Weeks 4-20), as long as asthma control was maintained. 
A total of 135 patients were enrolled: mean age was 50 years, 55% were female, and 48% had been 
receiving oral steroid therapy for at least 5 years. The baseline mean prednisone equivalent dose was 
approximately 13 mg per day. 
The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in daily OCS dose (weeks 20-24), whilst maintaining 
asthma control by defined dose reduction categories (see Table 4). Predefined categories included 
percent reductions ranging from 90-100% reduction, to no decrease in the prednisone dose from the 
end of the optimisation phase. The comparison between mepolizumab and placebo was statistically 
significant (p=0.008).

Open-label extension studies in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma MEA115666 (COLUMBA), 
MEA115661 (COSMOS) and 201312 (COSMEX) 
The long-term efficacy profile of mepolizumab in severe refractory eosinophilic asthma patients 
(n=998) treated for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) in open-label extension studies 
MEA115666, MEA115661 and 201312 was generally consistent with the 3 placebo-controlled 
studies. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Study 205687 (SYNAPSE) was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
which evaluated 407 patients aged 18 years and older with CRSwNP.  
Patients enrolled in the study were required to have a nasal obstruction VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) 
symptom score of >5 out of a maximum score of 10, an overall VAS symptom score >7 out of a 
maximum score of 10 and an endoscopic bilateral NP score of ≥5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with 
a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavity). Patients must also have had a history of at least one prior 
surgery for nasal polyps in the previous 10 years. 
Key baseline characteristics included total endoscopic NP score mean (SD) 5.5 (1.29), nasal 
obstruction VAS score mean (SD) 9.0 (0.83), overall VAS symptom score mean (SD) 9.1 (0.74), loss 
of smell VAS score mean (SD) 9.7 (0.72) and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) mean (SD) 64.1 
(18.32). The geometric mean eosinophil count was 390 cells/mcL (95% CI: 360, 420). In addition, 
27% of patients had aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and 48% of patients had at least 
1 course of OCS for CRSwNP in the past 12 months. 
Patients received a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab or placebo, administered subcutaneously once 
every 4 weeks in addition to background intranasal corticosteroid therapy. 
The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score at week 52 and 
change from baseline in mean nasal obstruction VAS score during weeks 49-52. The key secondary 
endpoint was the time to first NP surgery up to Week 52 (surgery was defined as any procedure 
involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue [e.g. polypectomy] in the nasal 
cavity). Patients who received mepolizumab had significantly greater improvements (decreases) in

Time to first NP surgery 
Across the 52-week treatment period, patients in the mepolizumab group had a lower probability of 
undergoing NP surgery than patients in the placebo group. The risk of surgery over the treatment 
period was significantly lower by 57% for patients treated with mepolizumab compared with placebo 
(Hazard Ratio: 0.43; 95% CI 0.25, 0.76; p=0.003).

A post-hoc analysis of the proportion of patients with surgery showed a 61% reduction in the 
odds of surgery versus placebo (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.72; p= 0.003). 
CRSwNP patients with co-morbid asthma 
In 289 (71%) patients with co-morbid asthma, pre-specified analyses showed improvements in the co-
primary endpoints consistent with those seen in the overall population in the patients who received 
mepolizumab 100 mg compared with placebo. Additionally in these patients, there was a greater 
improvement from baseline at Week 52 in asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ-5) for mepolizumab 100 mg compared with placebo (median change [Q1, Q3] of 
-0.80 [-2.20, 0.00] and 0.00 [-1.10, 0.20], respectively). 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
MEA115921 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study which evaluated 
136 adult patients with EGPA, who had a history of relapsing or refractory disease, and who were on 
stable oral corticosteroid therapy (OCS; ≥7.5 to ≤50 mg/day prednisolone/prednisone), with or 
without stable immunosuppressant therapy (excluding cyclophosphamide). Other background 
standard of care therapy was allowed during the study. Fifty-three percent (n=72) were also on 
concomitant stable immunosuppressant therapy. Patients with organ threatening or life- threatening 
EGPA were excluded from study MEA115921. 
Patients either received a 300 mg dose of mepolizumab or placebo administered subcutaneously once 
every 4 weeks in addition to their background prednisolone/prednisone with or without 
immunosuppressive therapy. The OCS dose was tapered at the discretion of the investigator. 
Remission 
45 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The co- primary endpoints were the total accrued duration of remission, defined as a Birmingham 
Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) =0 plus prednisolone/prednisone dose ≤4 mg/day, and the 
proportion of patients in remission at both 36 and 48 weeks of treatment. BVAS=0 represents no 
active vasculitis. 
Compared with placebo, patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg achieved a significantly greater 
accrued time in remission. Additionally, compared to placebo, a significantly higher proportion of 
patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg achieved remission at both Week 36 and Week 48 (Table 6). 
For both co-primary endpoints, compared with placebo, the beneficial effect observed following 
mepolizumab 300 mg treatment was present irrespective of if patients were receiving 
immunosuppressant therapy in addition to background corticosteroids. 
Using the secondary endpoint remission definition of BVAS=0 plus prednisolone/prednisone 
≤7.5 mg/day, patients receiving mepolizumab 300 mg also achieved significantly greater accrued time 
in remission (p<0.001), and a higher proportion of patients were in remission at both Week 36 and 
Week 48 (p<0.001), compared to placebo.

Relapse 
Compared with placebo, the time to first relapse was significantly longer for patients receiving 
mepolizumab 300 mg (p<0.001). Additionally, patients receiving mepolizumab had a 50% reduction 
in annualised relapse rate compared with placebo: 1.14 vs 2.27, respectively. 
Oral corticosteroid reduction 
Patients treated with mepolizumab had a significantly lower average daily OCS during Weeks 48-52 
compared with patients who received placebo. During Weeks 48 to 52, 59% and 44% of patients 
treated with mepolizumab achieved an average daily OCS dose of ≤ 7.5 mg and ≤ 4 mg respectively 
compared with 33% and 7% in the placebo group. 18% of patients in the mepolizumab group were 
able to taper off OCS completely compared with 3% in the placebo group.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
Study 200622 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 32-week study which evaluated 
108 patients ≥12 years old with HES. Patients received 300 mg of mepolizumab, or placebo 
administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks while continuing their HES therapy. In study 
200622, HES therapy included but was not limited to OCS, immunosuppressive, cytotoxic therapy or 
other symptomatic therapies associated with HES such as omeprazole. 
Patients entering the study had experienced at least two HES flares within the past 12 months and had 
a blood eosinophil count ≥1000 cells/µL during screening. Patients who were FIP1L1-PDGFRα 
kinase-positive were excluded from the study. 
The primary endpoint of study 200622 was the proportion of patients who experienced a HES flare 
during the 32-week treatment period. A HES flare was defined as worsening of clinical signs and 
symptoms of HES resulting in the need to increase OCS or increase/add cytotoxic or 
immunosuppressive HES therapy or receiving blinded active OCS due to increased blood eosinophils 
(on ≥ 2 occasions).  
The primary analysis compared patients who experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study in 
the mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups. Over the 32-week treatment period, 50% fewer 
patients experienced a HES flare or withdrew from the study when treated with 300 mg mepolizumab 
compared with placebo; 28% versus 56% respectively (OR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.64) (see Table 7). 
Secondary endpoints were time to first HES flare, proportion of patients who experienced a HES flare 
during Week 20 through Week 32, rate of HES flares and change from baseline in fatigue severity. 
All secondary endpoints were statistically significant and provided support for the primary endpoint 
(see Figure 2 and Table 8).

Open-label extension (OLE) 
Study 205203 was a 20-week open-label extension of Study 200622. HES therapy was allowed to be 
adjusted per local standard of care while maintaining mepolizumab 300 mg treatment starting at Week 
4. In this study the effect of treatment with mepolizumab on the reduction of HES flares reported 
during Study 200622 was sustained for patients who continued mepolizumab treatment in study 
205203, in which 94% (47/50) of patients did not experience a flare. 
In the 72 patients requiring OCS during Weeks 0 to 4 of the OLE, 28% of patients achieved a 
mean daily dose OCS dose reduction of ≥50% during Weeks 16 to 20. 
Paediatric population 
Severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
In MEA115588 and in the double-blind placebo-controlled study 200862, there were 34 adolescents 
(12 to 17 years old). Of these 34 subjects: 12 received placebo, 9 received mepolizumab 75 mg 
intravenously, and 13 received 100 mg subcutaneously. In a combined analysis of these studies, a 
40% reduction in clinically significant exacerbations was observed in adolescents following 
mepolizumab treatment compared to placebo (rate ratio 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17, 2.10). 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
The are no clinical data available in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old. 
HES 
Four adolescents (12 to 17 years old) were enrolled in study 200622; one adolescent received 
mepolizumab 300 mg, and 3 adolescents received placebo for 32 weeks. The one adolescent treated 
with mepolizumab in the 32-week Study 200622 did not have a HES flare. All 4 adolescents that 
completed study 200622 continued into a 20-week open-label extension study 205203 in which one of 
the 4 adolescents experienced one HES flare. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Following subcutaneous dosing in patients with asthma and CRSwNP, mepolizumab exhibited 
approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 12.5 mg to 250 mg. 
Subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab 300 mg had approximately three times the systemic 
exposure of mepolizumab 100 mg. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous administration to healthy subjects or patients with asthma, mepolizumab was 
absorbed slowly with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) ranging from 4 to 
8 days. 
Following a single subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, thigh or arm of healthy subjects, 
mepolizumab absolute bioavailability was 64%, 71% and 75%, respectively. In patients with asthma 
the absolute bioavailability of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously in the arm ranged from 74-
80%. Following repeat subcutaneous administration every 4 weeks, there is approximately a two-fold 
accumulation at steady state. 
Distribution 
Following a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, mepolizumab distributes into a 
mean volume of distribution of 55 to 85 mL/kg. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Mepolizumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are 
widely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue. 
Elimination 
Following a single intravenous administration to patients with asthma, the mean systemic clearance 
(CL) ranged from 1.9 to 3.3 mL/day/kg, with a mean terminal half-life of approximately 20 days. 
Following subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab the mean terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 
16 to 22 days. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis estimated mepolizumab systemic clearance 
was 3.1 mL/day/kg. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data available in elderly patients (≥65 years old) across all clinical 
studies (N=90). However, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no indications of an 
effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab over the age range of 12 to 82 years. 
Renal impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, no dose 
adjustment is required in patients with creatinine clearance values between 50-80 mL/min. There are 
limited data available in patients with creatinine clearance values <50 mL/min. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic 
enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect 
on the elimination of mepolizumab. 
Paediatric population  
Severe eosinophilic asthma and HES 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data available in the paediatric population (59 patients with 
eosinophilic esophagitis, 55 patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma and 1 patient with 
HES). Intravenous mepolizumab pharmacokinetics was evaluated by population pharmacokinetic 
analysis in a paediatric study conducted in patients aged 2–17 years old with eosinophilic esophagitis. 
Paediatric pharmacokinetics was largely predictable from adults, after taking into account 
bodyweight. Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics in adolescent patients with severe refractory 
eosinophilic asthma or HES included in the phase 3 studies were consistent with adults (see section 
4.2). 
Paediatric pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration in patients 6 to 11 years old with 
severe refractory eosinophilic asthma was investigated in an open label, uncontrolled study of 12-
weeks duration. Paediatric pharmacokinetics were broadly consistent with adults and adolescents after 
accounting for bodyweight and bioavailability. The absolute subcutaneous bioavailability appears 
complete compared to that observed in adults and adolescents of 76%. Exposure following 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subcutaneous administration of either 40 mg (for a weight < 40kg) or 100 mg (for a weight ≥ 40 kg) 
was 1.32 and 1.97 times of that observed in adults at 100 mg. 
Investigation of a 40 mg subcutaneous dosing regimen administered every 4 weeks in children 6 to 11 
years old over a 15-70 kg broad weight range by PK modelling and simulation predicts that the 
exposure of this dosing regimen would remain on average within 38% of adults at 100 mg. This 
dosing regimen is considered acceptable due to the wide therapeutic index of mepolizumab. 
EGPA 
Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics in children (6 to 17 years old) with EGPA were predicted using 
modelling and simulation, based on pharmacokinetics in other eosinophilic diseases, and are expected 
to be consistent with those observed in children with severe eosinophilic asthma. The recommended 
posology in children 6 to 11 years old over a 15-70 kg broad weight range predicts that the exposure 
would remain on average within 26% of adults at 300 mg. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
As mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been 
conducted. 
Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Intravenous and subcutaneous 
administration to monkeys was associated with reductions in peripheral and lung eosinophil counts, 
with no toxicological findings. 
Eosinophils are thought to be associated with immune system responses to some parasitic infections. 
Studies conducted in mice treated with anti-IL-5 antibodies or genetically deficient in IL-5 or 
eosinophils have not shown impaired ability to clear parasitic infections. The relevance of these 
findings for humans is unknown. 
Fertility 
No impairment of fertility was observed in a fertility and general reproduction toxicity study in mice 
performed with an analogous antibody that inhibits IL-5 in mice. This study did not include a littering 
or functional offspring assessment. 
Pregnancy 
In monkeys, mepolizumab had no effect on pregnancy or on embryonic/fetal and postnatal 
development (including immune function) of the offspring. Examinations for internal or skeletal 
malformations were not performed. Data in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrate that mepolizumab 
crossed the placenta. Concentrations of mepolizumab were about 1.2-2.4 times higher in infants than 
in mothers for several months post partum and did not affect the immune system of the infants.

Instructions for reconstitution for each vial 
1. 
Reconstitute the contents of the vial with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injections preferably 
using a 2 to 3 mL syringe and a 21 gauge needle. The stream of sterile water should be directed 
vertically, onto the centre of the lyophilised cake. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature 
during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 10 seconds with circular motion at 15-second 
intervals until the powder is dissolved. 
Note: The reconstituted solution must not be shaken during the procedure as this may lead to 
product foaming or precipitation. Reconstitution is typically complete within 5 minutes after the 
sterile water has been added, but it may take additional time.

Contents of the pack and other information 
Step-by-step instructions for use 
1.  What Nucala is and what it is used for 
Nucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma and 
EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 
years and older. It is also used to treat CRSwNP (Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps) and HES 
(Hypereosinophilic syndrome) in adults. 
Mepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the 
action of this protein, it limits the production of eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the 
number of eosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Some people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and lungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. 
Nucala can reduce your number of asthma attacks, if you or your child are already using medicines 
such as high dose inhalers, but your asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.  
If you are taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you 
need to control your asthma. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
CRSwNP is a condition in which people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the 
blood, and tissue lining the nose and sinuses. This can cause symptoms such as a blocked nose and 
loss of smell, and soft jelly-like growths (called nasal polyps) to form inside the nose.  
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and can reduce the size of your polyps, 
relieves your nasal congestion and helps prevent surgery for nasal polyps.  
Nucala can also help reduce the need for oral corticosteroids to control your symptoms. 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
EGPA is a condition where people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and tissues and also have a form of vasculitis. This means there is inflammation of the blood vessels. 
This condition most commonly affects the lungs and sinuses but often affects other organs such as the 
skin, heart and kidneys. 
Nucala can control and delay a flare-up of these EGPA symptoms. This medicine can also help reduce 
the daily dose of oral corticosteroids you need to control your symptoms. 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a condition in which there are a high number of eosinophils (a 
type of blood cell) in the blood. These cells can damage organs in the body, particularly the heart, 
lungs, nerves and skin. 
Nucala helps reduce your symptoms and prevents flares. If you are taking medicines often referred to 
as oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you need to control your HES 
symptoms/flares. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Nucala 
Do not use Nucala:  
- 
if you are allergic to mepolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
 Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using this medicine. 
Worsening asthma 
Some people get asthma-related side effects, or their asthma may become worse, during treatment 
with Nucala. 
 Tell your doctor or nurse if your asthma remains uncontrolled, or gets worse, after you 
start Nucala treatment. 
Allergic and injection site reactions 
Medicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause severe allergic reactions when injected into 
the body (see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’).  
If you may have had a similar reaction to any injection or medicine: 
 Tell your doctor before you are given Nucala. 
Parasitic infections 
Nucala may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a parasitic 
infection; it should be treated before you start treatment with Nucala. If you live in a region where 
these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region: 
 Check with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you.

7.  Step-by-step instructions for use 
1.  What Nucala is and what it is used for 
Nucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma and 
EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 
years and older. It is also used to treat CRSwNP (Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps) and HES 
(Hypereosinophilic syndrome) in adults. 
Mepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the 
action of this protein, it limits the production of eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the 
number of eosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Some people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and lungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. 
Nucala can reduce your number of asthma attacks, if you or your child are already using medicines 
such as high dose inhalers, but your asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.  
If you are taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you 
need to control your asthma. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
CRSwNP is a condition in which people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the 
blood, and tissue lining the nose and sinuses. This can cause symptoms such as a blocked nose and 
loss of smell, and soft jelly-like growths (called nasal polyps) to form inside the nose.  
Nucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and can reduce the size of your polyps, 
relieves your nasal congestion and helps prevent surgery for nasal polyps.  
110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nucala can also help reduce the need for oral corticosteroids to control your symptoms. 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
EGPA is a condition where people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and tissues and also have a form of vasculitis. This means there is inflammation of the blood vessels. 
This condition most commonly affects the lungs and sinuses but often affects other organs such as the 
skin, heart and kidneys. 
Nucala can control and delay a flare-up of these EGPA symptoms. This medicine can also help reduce 
the daily dose of oral corticosteroids you need to control your symptoms. 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a condition in which there are a high number of eosinophils (a 
type of white blood cell) in the blood. These cells can damage organs in the body, particularly the 
heart, lungs, nerves and skin. 
Nucala helps reduce your symptoms and prevents flares. If you are taking medicines often referred to 
as oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you need to control your HES 
symptoms/flares. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Nucala 
Do not use Nucala:  
- 
if you are allergic to mepolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
 Check with your doctor if you think this applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using this medicine. 
Worsening asthma 
Some people get asthma-related side effects, or their asthma may become worse, during treatment 
with Nucala. 
 Tell your doctor or nurse if your asthma remains uncontrolled, or gets worse, after you 
start Nucala treatment. 
Allergic and injection site reactions 
Medicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause severe allergic reactions when injected into 
the body (see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’).  
If you may have had a similar reaction to any injection or medicine: 
 Tell your doctor before you are given Nucala. 
Parasitic infections 
Nucala may weaken your resistance to infections caused by parasites. If you already have a parasitic 
infection; it should be treated before you start treatment with Nucala. If you live in a region where 
these infections are common or if you are travelling to such a region: 
 Check with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to you.

7.  Step-by-step instructions for use 
1.  What Nucala is and what it is used for 
Nucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma in 
adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and older. 
Some people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and lungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. 
Nucala can reduce the number of asthma attacks, if the child is already using medicines such as high 
dose inhalers, but their asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.  
If the child is taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose 
they need to control their asthma. 
Mepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the 
action of this protein, it limits the production of eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the 
number of eosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Nucala 
Do not use Nucala:  
- 
if the child you are caring for is allergic to mepolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
 Check with your doctor if you think this applies to the child. 
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using this medicine. 
Worsening asthma 
Some people get asthma-related side effects, or their asthma may become worse, during treatment 
with Nucala. 
 Tell your doctor or nurse if the child’s asthma remains uncontrolled, or gets worse, after 
starting Nucala treatment. 
Allergic and injection site reactions 
Medicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause severe allergic reactions when injected into 
the body (see section 4, ‘Possible side effects’).  
If the child may have had a similar reaction to any injection or medicine: 
 Tell your doctor before you give Nucala. 
Parasitic infections 
Nucala may weaken the child’s resistance to infections caused by parasites. If they already have a 
parasitic infection; it should be treated before they start treatment with Nucala. If they live in a region 
where these infections are common or if they are travelling to such a region: 
 Check with your doctor if you think any of these may apply to the child. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not intended for use in children below 6 years of age. 
Other medicines and Nucala 
Tell your doctor if the child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Other medicines for asthma 
 Don’t suddenly stop giving the child’s preventer medicines for their asthma once they have 
started Nucala. These medicines (especially ones called oral corticosteroids) must be 
stopped gradually, under the direct supervision of your doctor and dependent on their 
response to Nucala. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Patients who are pregnant, think they may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, must ask their 
doctor for advice before using this medicine.  
It is not known whether the ingredients of Nucala can pass into breast milk. Patients who are 
breast-feeding must check with their doctor before using Nucala. 
Driving and using machines  
The possible side effects of Nucala are unlikely to affect the ability to drive or use machines. 
Nucala contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 40 mg dose, i.e., that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use Nucala 
Nucala is given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneous injection).   
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor or nurse will decide if you can inject Nucala for the child you are caring for. If 
appropriate, they will then provide training to show you the correct way to use Nucala. 
The recommended dose for children aged 6 to 11 years old is 40 mg. You will give 1 injection every 
four weeks. 
Instructions for using the pre-filled syringe are given on the other side of this leaflet. 
If you use more Nucala than you should 
If you think you have injected too much Nucala, contact your doctor for advice.  
If a dose of Nucala is missed  
You should inject the next dose of Nucala as soon as you remember. If you do not notice that you 
have missed a dose until it is already time to give the next dose, then just inject the next dose as 
planned. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Stopping treatment with Nucala  
Do not stop injections of Nucala unless your doctor advises you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Nucala may cause the child’s asthma symptoms and attacks to come back. 
If the child’s asthma symptoms get worse while receiving injections of Nucala:  
 Call your doctor 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

1.  What Nucala is and what it is used for 
Nucala contains the active substance mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein 
designed to recognise a specific target substance in the body. It is used to treat severe asthma and 
EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis) in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 
years and older. It is also used to treat CRSwNP (Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps) and HES 
(Hypereosinophilic syndrome) in adults. 
Mepolizumab, the active substance in Nucala, blocks a protein called interleukin-5. By blocking the 
action of this protein, it limits the production of eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the 
number of eosinophils in the bloodstream and the lungs. 
Severe eosinophilic asthma 
Some people with severe asthma have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and lungs. This condition is called eosinophilic asthma – the type of asthma Nucala can treat. 
Nucala can reduce your number of asthma attacks, if you or your child are already using medicines 
such as high dose inhalers, but your asthma is not well controlled by these medicines.  
If you are taking medicines called oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you 
need to control your asthma. 
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) 
CRSwNP is a condition in which people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the 
blood and tissue lining the nose and sinuses. This can cause symptoms such as a blocked nose and 
loss of smell, and soft jelly-like growths (called nasal polyps) to form inside the nose.  
138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and can reduce the size of your polyps, 
relieves your nasal congestion and helps prevent surgery for nasal polyps.  
Nucala can also help reduce the need for oral corticosteroids to control your symptoms. 
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) 
EGPA is a condition where people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood 
and tissues and also have a form of vasculitis. This means there is inflammation of the blood vessels. 
This condition most commonly affects the lungs and sinuses but often affects other organs such as the 
skin, heart and kidneys. 
Nucala can control and delay a flare-up of these EGPA symptoms. This medicine can also help reduce 
the daily dose of oral corticosteroids you need to control your symptoms. 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a condition in which there are a high number of eosinophils (a 
type of white blood cell) in the blood. These cells can damage organs in the body, particularly the 
heart, lungs, nerves and skin. 
Nucala helps reduce your symptoms and prevents flares. If you are taking medicines often referred to 
as oral corticosteroids, Nucala can also help reduce the daily dose you need to control your HES 
symptoms/flares.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
7. 
Step-by-step instructions for use and handling, reconstitution, and administration 
Nucala is provided as a lyophilised, white powder in a single-use vial for subcutaneous injection only. 
Reconstitution should be carried out under aseptic conditions.  
Once reconstituted, Nucala will contain a concentration of 100 mg/mL mepolizumab. The solution for 
injection can be stored between 2°C to 30°C for no more than 8 hours. Any unused concentrate or 
solution remaining after 8 hours must be discarded. 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of the biological medicinal products, the name and batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Instructions for reconstitution for each vial 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Reconstitute the contents of the vial with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injections preferably 
using a 2 to 3 ml syringe and a 21 gauge needle. The stream of sterile water should be directed 
vertically, onto the centre of the lyophilised cake. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature 
during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 10 seconds with circular motion at 15-second 
intervals until the powder is dissolved. 
Note: The reconstituted solution must not be shaken during the procedure as this may lead to 
product foaming or precipitation. Reconstitution is typically complete within 5 minutes after the 
sterile water has been added, but it may take additional time.  
If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute Nucala, reconstitution can 
be accomplished by swirling at 450 rpm for no longer than 10 minutes. Alternatively, swirling 
at 1 000 rpm for no longer than 5 minutes is acceptable. 
Following reconstitution, Nucala should be visually inspected for particulate matter and clarity 
prior to use.  The solution should be clear to opalescent, and colourless to pale yellow or pale 
brown, free of visible particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable. If 
particulate matter remains in the solution or if the solution appears cloudy or milky, the solution 
must not be used.  
The reconstituted solution, if not used immediately must be: 
• 
• 
• 
Protected from sunlight  
Stored below 30°C, not frozen 
Discarded if not used within 8 hours of reconstitution 
Instructions for administration of 100 mg dose 
1. 
2. 
3. 
For subcutaneous administration, a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a disposable needle 
21 gauge to 27 gauge x 0.5 inch (13 mm) should preferably be used. 
Just prior to administration, remove 1 mL of reconstituted Nucala from one vial.  Do not shake 
the reconstituted solution during the procedure as this could lead to product foaming or 
precipitation. 
Administer the 1 mL injection (equivalent to 100 mg mepolizumab) subcutaneously into the 
upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. 
If more than one vial is required for administration of the prescribed dosage, repeat steps 1 to 3. It is 
recommended that individual injection sites are separated by at least 5 cm. 
146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions for administration of 40 mg dose 
1. 
2. 
For subcutaneous administration, a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a disposable needle 
21 gauge to 27 gauge x 0.5 inch (13 mm) should preferably be used. 
Just prior to administration, remove 0.4mL of reconstituted Nucala.  Do not shake the 
reconstituted solution during the procedure as this could lead to product foaming or 
precipitation. Dispose of the remaining solution. 
3.  Administer the 0.4mL injection (equivalent to 40 mg mepolizumab) subcutaneously into the 
upper arm, thigh, or abdomen.  
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

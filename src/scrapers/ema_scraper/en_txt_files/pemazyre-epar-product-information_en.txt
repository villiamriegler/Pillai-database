CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pemazyre monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic 
cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement that 
have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with 
biliary tract cancer.  
FGFR 2 fusion positivity status must be known prior to initiation of Pemazyre therapy. Assessment for 
FGFR 2 fusion positivity in tumor specimen should be performed with an appropriate diagnostic test.

Posology 
The recommended dose is 13.5 mg pemigatinib taken once daily for 14 days followed by 7 days off 
therapy. 
If a dose of pemigatinib is missed by 4 or more hours or vomiting occurs after taking a dose, an 
additional dose should not be administered and dosing should be resumed with the next scheduled 
dose. 
Treatment should be continued as long as the patient does not show evidence of disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
In all patients, a low-phosphate diet should be initiated when serum phosphate level is > 5.5 mg/dL 
and adding a phosphate-lowering therapy should be considered when level is > 7 mg/dL. The dose of 
phosphate-lowering therapy should be adjusted until serum phosphate level returns to < 7 mg/dL. 
Prolonged hyperphosphataemia can cause precipitation of calcium-phosphate crystals that can lead to 
hypocalcaemia, soft tissue mineralization, muscle cramps, seizure activity, QT interval prolongation, 
and arrhythmias (see section 4.4). 
Discontinuing phosphate-lowering therapy and diet should be considered during Pemazyre treatment 
breaks or if serum phosphate level falls below normal range. Severe hypophosphataemia may present 
with confusion, seizures, focal neurologic findings, heart failure, respiratory failure, muscle weakness, 
rhabdomyolysis, and haemolytic anemia (see section 4.4). 
Dose adjustment due to drug interaction 
Concomitant use of pemigatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice, should be avoided during 
treatment with pemigatinib. If co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the 
dose of patients who are taking 13.5 mg pemigatinib once daily should be reduced to 9 mg once daily 
and the dose of patients who are taking 9 mg pemigatinib once daily should be reduced to 4.5 mg once 
daily (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Management of toxicities 
Dose modifications or interruption of dosing should be considered for the management of toxicities. 
Pemigatinib dose reductions levels are summarised in table 1.

Special populations 
Elderly patients 
The dose of pemigatinib is the same in elderly patients as younger adult patients (see section 5.1). 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required for patients with mild, moderate renal impairment or End Stage Renal 
Disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis. For patients with severe renal impairment, the dose of patients who 
are taking 13.5 mg pemigatinib once daily should be reduced to 9 mg once daily and the dose of 
patients who are taking 9 mg pemigatinib once daily should be reduced to 4.5 mg once daily (see 
section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
Dose adjustment is not required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. For patients 
with severe hepatic impairment, the dose of patients who are taking 13.5 mg pemigatinib once daily 
should be reduced to 9 mg once daily and the dose of patients who are taking 9 mg pemigatinib once 
daily should be reduced to 4.5 mg once daily (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Pemazyre in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Pemazyre is for oral use. The tablets should be taken at approximately the same time every day. 
Patients should not crush, chew, split or dissolve the tablets. Pemigatinib may be taken with or without 
food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Concomitant use with St John’s wort (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hyperphosphataemia 
Hyperphosphataemia is a pharmacodynamic effect expected with pemigatinib administration (see 
section 5.1). Prolonged hyperphosphataemia can cause precipitation of calcium-phosphate crystals that 
can lead to hypocalcaemia, soft tissue mineralization, anemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, muscle 
cramps, seizure activity, QT interval prolongation, and arrhythmias (see section 4.2). Soft tissue 
mineralization, including cutaneous calcification, calcinosis and non-uraemic calciphylaxis have been 
observed with pemigatinib treatment. 
Recommendations for management of hyperphosphataemia include dietary phosphate restriction, 
administration of phosphate-lowering therapy, and dose modification when required (see section 4.2). 
Phosphate-lowering therapy was used by 19 % of patients during treatment with pemigatinib (see 
section 4.8). 
Hypophosphataemia 
Discontinuing phosphate-lowering therapy and diet should be considered during pemigatinib treatment 
breaks or if serum phosphate level falls below normal range. Severe hypophosphataemia may present 
with confusion, seizures, focal neurologic findings, heart failure, respiratory failure, muscle weakness, 
rhabdomyolysis, and haemolytic anemia (see section 4.2). Hypophosphataemia reactions were ≥ Grade 
3 in 14.3 % of participants. None of the events were serious, led to discontinuation or to dose 
reduction. Dose interruption occurred in 1.4 % of participants. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients presenting with hyperphosphataemia or hypophosphataemia, additional close monitoring 
and follow-up is recommended regarding dysregulation of bone mineralization. 
Serous retinal detachment 
Pemigatinib can cause serous retinal detachment reactions, which may present with symptoms such as 
blurred vision, visual floaters, or photopsia (see section 4.8). This can moderately influence the ability 
to drive and use machines (see section 4.7). 
Ophthalmological examination, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) should be performed 
prior to initiation of therapy and every 2 months for the first 6 months of treatment, every 3 months 
afterwards, and urgently at any time for visual symptoms. For serous retinal detachment reactions, the 
dose modification guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). 
During the conduct of the clinical study, there was no routine monitoring, including OCT, to detect 
asymptomatic serous retinal detachment; therefore, the incidence of asymptomatic serous retinal 
detachment with pemigatinib is unknown.  
Careful consideration should be taken with patients that have clinically significant medical eye 
disorders, such as retinal disorders, including but not limited to, central serous retinopathy, 
macular/retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and previous retinal detachment. 
Dry eye 
Pemigatinib can cause dry eye (see section 4.8). Patients should use ocular demulcents, in order to 
prevent or treat dry eye, as needed. 
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Based on the mechanism of action and findings in an animal reproduction study (see section 5.3), 
pemigatinib can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant women should 
be advised of the potential risk to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
use effective contraception during treatment with pemigatinib and for 1 week after the last dose.  
Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment with pemigatinib and for at least 1 week after the last dose (see section 
4.6). 
Blood creatinine increase 
Pemigatinib may increase serum creatinine by decreasing renal tubular secretion of creatinine; this 
may occur due to inhibition of renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1 and may not affect glomerular 
function. Within the first cycle, serum creatinine increased (mean increase of 0.2 mg/dL) and reached 
steady state by Day 8, and then decreased during the 7 days off therapy (see section 4.8). Alternative 
markers of renal function should be considered if persistent elevations in serum creatinine are 
observed. 
Combination with proton pump inhibitors 
Concomitant use of pemigatinib with proton pump inhibitors should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of pemigatinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors requires dose adjustment (see sections 
4.2 and 4.5). Patients should be advised to avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice while 
taking pemigatinib. 
Combination with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
Concomitant use of pemigatinib with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended (see 
section 4.5). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CNS metastasis 
Since untreated or progressing brain/CNS metastasis were not allowed in the study, efficacy in this 
population has not been evaluated and no dose recommendations can be made, however the 
blood-brain barrier penetration of pemigatinib is expected to be low (see section 5.3). 
Contraception  
Based on findings in an animal study and its mechanism of action, Pemazyre can cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing age being treated with Pemazyre 
should be advised not to become pregnant and men being treated with Pemazyre should be advised not 
to father a child during treatment. An effective method of contraception should be used in women of 
childbearing potential and in men with women partners of childbearing potential during treatment with 
Pemazyre and for 1 week following completion of therapy (see section 4.6). 
Pregnancy test 
A pregnancy test should be performed before treatment initiation to exclude pregnancy. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on pemigatinib 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
A strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole 200 mg once daily) increased pemigatinib AUC geometric 
mean by 88 % (90 % CI of 75 %, 103 %), which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse 
reactions with pemigatinib. Patients who are taking 13.5 mg pemigatinib once daily should have their 
dose reduced to 9 mg once daily and patients who are taking 9 mg pemigatinib once daily should have 
their dose reduced to 4.5 mg once daily (see section 4.2).  
CYP3A4 inducers 
A strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin 600 mg once daily) decreased pemigatinib AUC geometric mean 
by 85 % (90 % CI of 84 %, 86 %), which may decrease the efficacy of pemigatinib. Concurrent use of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin) should be 
avoided during treatment with pemigatinib (see section 4.4). Concomitant use of pemigatinib with St 
John’s wort is contra-indicated (see section 4.3). If needed, other enzyme inducers (e.g. efavirenz) 
should be used under close surveillance. 
Proton pump inhibitors  
Pemigatinib geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) for Cmax and AUC were 65.3 % (54.7, 78.0) and 92.1 % 
(88.6, 95.8), respectively, when co-administered in healthy subjects with esomeprazole (a proton 
pump inhibitor) relative to pemigatinib alone. Co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor 
(esomeprazole) did not result in a clinically important change in pemigatinib exposure. 
However, in more than one third of patients given PPIs, a significant reduction of the exposure of 
pemigatinib was observed. PPIs should be avoided in patients receiving pemigatinib (see section 4.4). 
H2-receptors antagonists  
Co-administration of ranitidine did not result in a clinically important change in pemigatinib exposure.  
Effects of pemigatinib on other medicinal products 
Effect of pemigatinib on CYP2B6 substrates  
In vitro studies indicate that pemigatinib induces CYP2B6. Co-administration of pemigatinib with 
CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, methadone, efavirenz) may decrease their 
exposure. Close clinical surveillance is recommended when pemigatinib is administered with these 
medicinal products or any CYP2B6 substrate having a narrow therapeutic index. 
Effect of pemigatinib on P-gp substrates 
In vitro, pemigatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp. Co-administration of pemigatinib with P-gp substrates 
(e.g. digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine) may increase their exposure and thus their toxicity. Pemigatinib 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration should be separated by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in men and women/women of childbearing potential 
Based on findings in an animal study and its mechanism of action, pemigatinib can cause foetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential being treated with 
pemigatinib should be advised not to become pregnant and men being treated with pemigatinib should 
be advised not to father a child during treatment. An effective method of contraception should be used 
in women of childbearing potential and in men with women partners of childbearing potential during 
treatment with pemigatinib and for 1 week following completion of therapy. Since the effect of 
pemigatinib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier 
methods should be applied as a second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy. 
Pregnancy  
There are no available data from the use of pemigatinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Based on animal data and pharmacology of pemigatinib, 
Pemazyre should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the women requires 
treatment with pemigatinib. A pregnancy test should be performed before treatment initiation to 
exclude pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pemigatinib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-
fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pemazyre 
and for 1 week following completion of therapy.  
Fertility  
There are no data on the impact of pemigatinib on human fertility. Animal fertility studies have not 
been conducted with pemigatinib (see section 5.3). Based on the pharmacology of pemigatinib, 
impairment of male and female fertility cannot be excluded. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pemigatinib has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such 
as fatigue and visual disturbances have been associated with pemigatinib. Therefore, caution should be 
recommended when driving or operating machines (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hyperphosphataemia 
Hyperphosphataemia was reported in 60.5 % of all patients treated with pemigatinib. 
Hyperphosphataemia above 7 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL was experienced by 27.2 % and 0.7 % of patients, 
respectively. Hyperphosphataemia usually develops within the first 15 days.  
None of the reactions were ≥ Grade 3 in severity, serious or led to discontinuation of pemigatinib. 
Dose interruption occurred in 1.4 % patients and reduction in 0.7 % of patients. These results suggest 
that dietary phosphate restriction and/or administration of phosphate-lowering therapy along with the 
1-week dose holiday were effective strategies for managing this on-target effect of pemigatinib.  
Recommendations for management of hyperphosphataemia are provided in sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Serous retinal detachment 
Serous retinal detachment occurred in 4.8 % of all patients treated with pemigatinib. Reactions were 
generally Grade 1 or 2 (4.1 %) in severity; ≥ Grade 3 and serious reactions included retinal detachment 
in 1 patient (0.7 %). Two adverse reactions of retinal detachment (0.7 %) and detachment of retinal 
pigment epithelium (0.7 %) led to dose interruption. None of the reactions led to dose reduction or 
discontinuation.  
Recommendations for management of serous retinal detachment are provided in sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no information on overdose of pemigatinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EN02 
Pemigatinib is a kinase inhibitor of FGFR1, 2 and 3 which inhibits FGFR phosphorylation and 
signalling and decreases cell viability in cells expressing FGFR genetic alterations, including point 
mutations, amplifications, and fusions or rearrangements. FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements are strong 
oncogenic drivers and are the most common FGFR alteration occurring, almost exclusively, in 10-
16 % of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Serum phosphate 
Pemigatinib increased serum phosphate level as a consequence of FGFR inhibition. In pemigatinib 
clinical studies, phosphate-lowering therapy and dose modifications were permitted to manage 
hyperphosphataemia (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
Clinical studies 
FIGHT-202 was a multicentre, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
Pemazyre in previously treated patients with locally advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable 
cholangiocarcinoma. The efficacy population consists of 108 patients (107 patients with intrahepatic 
disease) that had progressed after at least 1 prior therapy and who had FGFR2 fusion or 
rearrangement, as determined by the test performed at a central laboratory. 
Patients received Pemazyre in 21-days cycles consisting of 13.5 mg once daily oral dosing for 14 days, 
followed by 7 days off therapy. Pemazyre was administered until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of 
response (DoR), as determined by independent review committee (IRC) according to RECIST v1.1. 
The median age was 55.5 years (range: 26 to 77 years), 23.1 % were ≥65 years, 61.1 % were female, 
and 73.1 % were Caucasian. Most (95.4 %) patients had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (42.6 %) or 1 (52.8 %). All patients had at least 1 prior line of 
systemic therapy, 27.8 % had 2 prior lines of therapy, and 12.0 % had 3 or more prior lines of therapy. 
Ninety-six percent of patients had received prior platinum-based therapy including 78 % with prior 
gemcitabine/cisplatin.  
Efficacy results are summarised in table 5. 
The median time to response was 2.69 months (range 0.7 – 16.6 months).

Elderly patients 
In the clinical study of pemigatinib, 23.1 % of patients were 65 years and older, and 4.6 % of patients 
were 75 years and older. No difference in efficacy response was detected between these patients and in 
patients < 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pemazyre in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. See 
section 4.2 for information in pediatric use. 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency 
will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be 
updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Pemigatinib exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 1 to 20 mg. Following oral 
administration of Pemazyre 13.5 mg once daily, steady-state was reached by 4 days with a geometric 
mean accumulation ratio of 1.6. The geometric mean steady-state AUC0-24h was 2620 nM·h (54 % CV) 
and Cmax was 236 nM (56 % CV) for 13.5 mg once daily. 
Absorption 
Median time to achieve peak plasma concentration (tmax) was 1 to 2 hours. 
No clinically meaningful differences with pemigatinib pharmacokinetics were observed following 
administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal (800 calories to 1,000 calories with approximately 
50 % of total caloric content of the meal from fat) in patients with cancer. 
Distribution 
Pemigatinib is 90.6 % bound to human plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin. The estimated 
apparent volume of distribution was 235 L (60.8 %) in patients with cancer. 
Biotransformation 
Pemigatinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A4 in vitro. Following oral administration of a 
single 13.5 mg radiolabeled pemigatinib dose, unchanged pemigatinib was the major drug-related 
moiety in plasma, and no metabolites > 10 % of total circulating radioactivity were observed. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Following oral administration of pemigatinib 13.5 mg once daily in patients with cancer, the geometric 
mean elimination half-life (t½) was 15.4 (51.6 % CV) hours and the geometric mean apparent 
clearance (CL/F) was 10.6 L/h (54 % CV). 
Excretion 
Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled pemigatinib, 82.4 % of the dose was recovered in faeces 
(1.4 % as unchanged) and 12.6 % in urine (1 % as unchanged). 
Renal impairment  
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pemigatinib was evaluated in a renal 
impairment study in subjects with normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 mL/min), severe renal function 
(GFR < 30 mL/min and not on hemodialysis) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (GFR < 30 
mL/min and on hemodialysis). In subjects with the severe renal impairment, the geometric mean ratios 
(90 % CI) compared to normal controls were 64.6 % (44.1 %, 94.4 %) for Cmax and 159 % (95.4 %, 
264 %) for AUC0-∞. In the subjects with ESRD before hemodialysis, the geometric mean ratios (90 % 
CI) was 77.5 % (51.2 %, 118 %) for Cmax and 76.8 % (54.0 %, 109 %) for AUC0-∞. Besides, in 
participants with ESRD after hemodialysis, the geometric mean ratios (90 % CI) were 90.0 % (59.3 %, 
137 %) for Cmax and 91.3 % (64.1 %, 130 %) for AUC0-∞. Based on these results, pemigatinib dose 
should be reduced for patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pemigatinib was evaluated in a hepatic 
impairment study in subjects with normal hepatic function, moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe 
(Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the geometric 
mean ratios (90 % CI) compared to normal controls, were 96.7 % (59.4 %, 157 %) for Cmax and 146 % 
(100 %, 212 %) for AUC0-∞. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the GMR (90 % CI) was 
94.2 % (68.9 %, 129 %) for Cmax and 174 % (116 %, 261 %) for AUC0-∞. Based on these results, no 
dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. However, 
pemigatinib dose should be reduced for patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Interactions 
CYP substrates  
Pemigatinib at clinically relevant concentrations is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 or an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4.  
Transporters  
Pemigatinib is a substrate of both P-gp and BCRP. P-gp or BCRP inhibitors are not expected to affect 
pemigatinib exposure at clinically relevant concentrations.  
In vitro, pemigatinib is an inhibitor of OATP1B3, OCT2, and MATE1. Inhibition of OCT2 may 
increase serum creatinine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Systemic toxicity 
The most prominent findings following repeat-dose administration of pemigatinib in both rats and 
monkeys were attributed to the intended pharmacology of pemigatinib (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 
inhibition), including hyperphosphataemia, physeal dysplasia, and soft tissue mineralization; some of 
these findings were observed at exposures (AUC) lower than therapeutic. Mineralization was observed 
in numerous tissues including kidneys, stomach, arteries, ovaries (monkey only), and eyes (cornea, rat 
only). Soft tissue mineralization was not reversible, while physeal and cartilage findings were 
reversible. In addition, changes of the bone marrow (rats) and kidney lesions were observed.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity  
Pemigatinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity assay, nor clastogenic in an in vitro 
chromosome aberration assay, and did not result in induction of bone marrow micronuclei in an in 
vivo micronucleus assay in rats. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies with pemigatinib have not been conducted. 
Impairment of fertility 
No specific animal studies with pemigatinib have been conducted to evaluate the effects of pemigatinib 
on fertility. In repeated dose toxicity studies, oral administration of pemigatinib did not result in any 
dose-related adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs. 
Developmental toxicity 
In rats, administration of pemigatinib at ≥ 0.3 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in 100 % postimplantation loss. At 0.1 mg/kg/day, an increase in foetal skeletal malformations and 
major blood vessels variations, reduced ossification, and decrease foetal body weight were observed. 
Exposure at that dose is approximately 20 % of the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended 
human dose of 13.5 mg based on AUC. 
Safety pharmacology 
In vitro, pemigatinib showed an IC50 for hERG inhibition > 8 μM (the highest feasible concentration 
based on solubility), that is > 360-fold higher than the clinical steady-state unbound Cmax at the dose of 
13.5 mg. In vivo, there were no adverse findings in safety pharmacology assessments of pemigatinib, 
including in vivo respiratory and central nervous system function studies in rats and cardiovascular 
study in monkeys.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pemazyre is and what it is used for 
Pemazyre contains the active substance pemigatinib, which belongs to a group of cancer medicines 
called tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It blocks the action of proteins in the cell called fibroblast growth 
factor receptor types 1, 2 and 3 (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3) that help regulate cell growth. Cancer 
cells may have an abnormal form of this protein. By blocking FGFR, pemigatinib can prevent the 
growth of such cancer cells. 
Pemazyre is used: 
• 
to treat adults with bile duct cancer (also known as cholangiocarcinoma) whose cancer cells 
have an abnormal form of the FGFR2 protein, and 
•  when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery, and 
•  when treatment with other medicines is no longer working. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Pemazyre 
Do not take Pemazyre if you are 
• 
• 
allergic to pemigatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
using St John’s wort, a medicine to treat depression 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Pemazyre if you have: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
been told you have an increase or decrease of a mineral in your blood called phosphorus 
vision or eye problems 
severely reduced liver function. Your treatment may need to be adjusted 
severely reduced kidney function. Your treatment may need to be adjusted 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
cancer cells that have spread into the brain or spinal cord 
Eye examinations are recommended: 
• 
• 
• 
before starting treatment with Pemazyre 
every 2 months for the first 6 months of treatment 
every 3 months thereafter or immediately if any visual symptoms occur, including flashes of 
light, visual disturbances or dark spots. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you get any symptoms with your vision. 
You should also use lubricating or hydrating eye drops or gels to help prevent or treat dry eyes. 
Pemazyre may harm the unborn baby. An effective contraception must be used during treatment and 
for at least 1 week after the last dose of Pemazyre in women of childbearing age and in men with 
women partners of childbearing age.  
Children and adolescents 
Pemazyre should not be given to children or adolescents under 18 years. It is not known whether it is 
safe and effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Pemazyre 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines so that the 
doctor can decide if your treatment needs to change: 
• 
St John’s wort: a medicine to treat depression. You must not take St John’s wort during 
treatment with Pemazyre.

How to take Pemazyre 
Pemazyre treatment should be started by a doctor who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of 
bile duct cancer. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check 
with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is  
1 tablet of Pemazyre 13.5 mg taken once daily for 14 days, followed by 7 days without taking 
Pemazyre. 
Treatment is continued with the same pattern of 14 days of Pemazyre once daily, followed by 7 days 
off therapy. Do not take Pemazyre during the 7 days off therapy. Your doctor will adjust the dose or 
stop treatment if needed.

If you forget to take Pemazyre 
If you miss a dose of Pemazyre by 4 hours or more, or if you vomit after taking Pemazyre, do not take 
another Pemazyre tablet to make up for the missed dose. Take your next dose of Pemazyre at the 
scheduled time.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pemigatinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on cutaneous calcification from clinical trials, including in some cases a 
close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between pemigatinib and cutaneous calcification is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pemigatinib 
should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pemigatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pemigatinib is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

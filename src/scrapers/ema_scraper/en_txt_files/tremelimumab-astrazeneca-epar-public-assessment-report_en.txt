2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication is: Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and platinum-
based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no 
sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
genomic tumour aberrations. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and remains the leading cause of cancer 
death around the globe (Sung et al 2021; GLOBOCAN 2021). In Europe, an estimated 312,645 
patients will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2021, accounting for approximately 25% of all cancer 
diagnoses, and an estimated 267,700 lung cancer associated deaths will occur, accounting for 
approximately one in 5 cancer related mortalities (Lung Cancer Europe 2021). In the US, an estimated 
235,760 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2021, accounting for about 25% of all cancer 
diagnoses, and an estimated 131,880 lung cancer associated deaths will occur, accounting for 
approximately 1 in 4 cancer related mortalities (American Cancer Society 2021). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 85% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer 
cases.  It includes several histological subtypes of which non-squamous (e.g., adenocarcinoma, large 
cell carcinoma) and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common (Aisner and Marshall 2012).   
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Despite advances made in screening, early detection, and staging, the majority of lung cancer patients 
are diagnosed when the disease has advanced into the metastatic stage and is not amenable to 
surgical resection (Herbst et al 2018).  Furthermore, a significant percentage of patients with early 
stage NSCLC who have undergone surgery subsequently develop distant recurrence and die as a result 
of their metastatic disease (Pisters and Le Chevalier 2005). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The first line (1L) treatment of metastatic NSCLC has evolved from the empirical use of cytotoxic 
chemotherapies based on physician’s preference to a hallmark of personalized medicine, with subsets 
of patients treated according to the genetic alterations of their tumour and the status of programmed 
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which predict for benefit from targeted therapies or immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs), respectively (Herbst et al 2018; Peters et al 2019). 
In the past 5 years, substantial progress has been made in the frontline treatment of metastatic 
NSCLC with immunotherapy-based regimens demonstrating improved outcomes in this patient 
population (NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology Version 1.2020; ESMO Guidelines Committee 
2019).  Treatment selection in clinical practice is usually based on PD-L1 expression or histology. For 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 10/162 
 
 
  
 
 
patients with high PD-L1 expression (i.e., PD-L1 expressed in ≥50% of tumour cells), monotherapy 
with either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or cemiplimab have been authorised in the EU. Conversely, 
regardless of PD-L1 expression, a series of combinations of immunotherapy with histology-selected 
platinum-based chemotherapy have also shown survival benefits and were authorised in the EU:  
•  Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for squamous histology 
•  Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
•  Atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
The addition of chemotherapy to nivolumab + ipilimumab, a combination of PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors, 
showed efficacy benefit over chemotherapy alone with early disease control at all PD-L1 expression 
levels (Paz-Ares et al [Checkmate 9LA] 2021), receiving a positive opinion from the CHMP in 
September 2020 (EMEA/H/C/WS1783). 
Unmet medical need: Immunotherapy-based treatments are the 1L standard-of-care in patients with 
advanced metastatic NSCLC whose tumours do not harbour driver mutations (NCCN Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology Version 2.2021).  Notwithstanding these developments and the treatment 
options, the available treatment strategies extend long-term survival in only a minority of patients 
(Peters et al 2019; Grant et al 2021).  Overall, newer treatment options are therefore required that 
can explore the potential of immunotherapy strategies and benefit a broader patient population. 
2.2.  About the product 
Tremelimumab is a selective, fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against cytotoxic 
T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4).  CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T cell expansion 
and activation following an immune response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that 
maintains T cell homeostasis.  During T cell activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 
and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting cells, sending an inhibitory signal and preventing CD28-
mediated T cell co-stimulation, thus limiting T cell activation.  Tremelimumab blocks these events, 
leading to prolongation and enhancement of T cell activation and expansion, resulting in increased T-
cell diversity and enhanced anti-tumour activity. 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is a sterile, preservative-free, liquid dosage form intended for intravenous 
infusion after dilution. This application seeks to register one pharmaceutical form (concentrate for 
solution for infusion), one strength (20 mg/mL) and two presentations (25 mg single-dose vial 
presentation and a 300 mg single-dose vial presentation). 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca contains as excipients (for each presentation) histidine/histidine-HCl 
monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate, disodium edetate dihydrate and Polysorbate 80. 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following indication: Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in 
combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is indicated for the first-line 
treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitising EGFR 
mutations or ALK positive mutations. 
Treatment with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca must be initiated and supervised by a physician 
experienced in the treatment of cancer. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is presented in Table 1.

d Consider maintenance administration of pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous tumours who received treatment with 
pemetrexed and carboplatin/cisplatin during the platinum-based chemotherapy stage. 
e In the case of dose delay(s), a fifth dose of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca can be given after Week 16, alongside durvalumab. 
f If patients receive fewer than 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, the remaining cycles of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca (up to 
a total of 5) should be given during the post-platinum chemotherapy phase. 
Dose escalation or reduction is not recommended for Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with 
durvalumab. Dose withholding or discontinuation may be required based on individual safety and 
tolerability. 
Method of administration 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is for intravenous use, it is administered as an intravenous infusion after 
dilution, over 1 hour.  
When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given first, followed by durvalumab and then platinum-
based chemotherapy on the day of dosing. 
When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given as a fifth dose in combination with durvalumab and 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy at week 16, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given first, followed by 
durvalumab and then pemetrexed maintenance therapy on the day of dosing.

separate intravenous infusions. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab are each given over 1 
hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. For 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. Separate infusion 
bags and filters for each infusion should be used. 
During cycle 1, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is to be followed by durvalumab starting approximately 1 
hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca infusion. Platinum-based 
chemotherapy infusion should start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the 
durvalumab infusion. If there are no clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the 
physician’s discretion, subsequent cycles of durvalumab can be given immediately after Tremelimumab 
AstraZeneca and the time period between the end of the durvalumab infusion and the start of 
chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes. 
2.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
A routine GCP inspection of study D419MC00004 (POSEIDON) was adopted at the CHMP meeting held 
in January 2022. No specific concerns were known to have been identified by the assessment at the 
time of adoption of the inspection request; general triggers were used in the choice of this dossier and 
the sites involved in line with the guideline “Points to consider for assessors, inspectors and EMA 
inspection coordinators on the identification of triggers for the selection of applications for “routine” 
and/or “for cause” inspections, their investigation and scope of such inspections”. The purpose of the 
inspection was to verify efficacy and safety data reported in the Marketing Authorisation Application 
(MAA) for a sample of patients to be determined by the inspectors. Moreover, the compliance with GCP 
and applicable regulations was to be verified, in particular where it had an impact on the validity of the 
data or the ethical conduct of the study. 
This routine GCP inspection was conducted at one investigational site in Germany (21-25 February 
2022), the main CRO in the USA (11-17 March 2022), and the sponsor in Canada (21-25 March 2022). 
One critical finding was reported during the CRO inspection; major and minor findings were observed 
at all sites.  
Although departures from GCP compliance were identified as there were one critical and several major 
findings observed during the inspections at all sites, the study was considered by the inspection team 
to have been conducted ethically and in compliance with GCP. The findings were deemed unlikely to 
impact the overall quality of the data. The inspection team concluded that the overall quality of the 
trial with the reported data had not been negatively affected, and that the data documented and 
reported in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) submitted in support of the MAA for Tremelimumab Astra 
Zeneca could be used as basis for the assessment. The sponsor was however requested for a CSR 
addendum including a complete list of mis-stratified subjects to report overall survival in long-term 
follow up as part of the corrective action proposed for one of the major findings at the sponsor site.

2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Tremelimumab (INN) active substance is a human monoclonal antibody from the immunoglobulin (Ig) 
G2a subclass comprising of 2 heavy chains (HC) and 2 light chains (LC) covalently linked with 6 inter-
chain disulfide bonds. There is one N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-301 on each HC (Fc region). The 
molecular weight of tremelimumab is 149,145 Da. The theoretical and experimentally confirmed 
extinction coefficient is 1.43 (mg/mL)-1cm-1 and the pI is in the range of 8.5–9.0. 
The mechanism of action is blocking of the interaction between CTLA-4, a cell surface receptor 
expressed on activated T cells, and the natural B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86) on antigen-presenting 
cells resulting in enhanced T cell-mediated immune response such as T cell activation, proliferation, 
and lymphocyte infiltration into tumors leading to tumor cell death.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacturing and testing of the active substance is performed by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma 
GmbH & Co. KG, Birkendorfer Strasse 65, Biberach an der Riss 88397, Germany. The active substance 
is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality-control tested in accordance with Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described and is considered 
acceptable. It comprises of upstream process (cell culture steps) and downstream process (purification 
steps).  
The upstream process comprises of vial thaw, inoculum expansion, seed bioreactors, production 
bioreactor and harvest. Cell culture process is initiated with the thaw of cells from one working cell 
bank (WCB) vial. One production bioreactor results in one batch of active substance (parent batch), for 
which a unique batch number is assigned. Subsequently, this parent batch may be subject to 
splitting/pooling (sub-lotting) and stored under refrigerated or frozen conditions. The applicant defined 
the material inputs, critical process parameters (CPPs) and non-critical process parameters (NCPPs), 
and process outputs (in-process controls, microbial controls, and performance attributes) for each 
manufacturing step and are considered acceptable. The harvest is initiated by lowering the bioreactor 
temperature and followed by continuous centrifugation and filtrations (depth filtration and membrane 
filtration). The pre-harvest samples are taken from the production bioreactor on the harvest day to 
perform unprocessed bulk (UPB) testing. Harvest product is tested for bioburden and endotoxins. 
The protein is then purified using a series of packed bed chromatographic and membrane filtration 
techniques. All purification steps were sufficiently described. The used buffers and solutions, 
chromatography media, filters and other product contact disposables were presented. CPPs, NCPPs, in-
process controls (IPCs), microbial controls and performance attributes with the proposed limits (proven 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 14/162 
 
 
  
 
 
acceptable range - PARs, acceptance criteria or action limits) were adequately defined for each 
purification step. 
The purification process is followed by a formulation step, which consists of product concentration, 
diafiltration and dilution to formulate the bulk active substance at a concentration of 20 g/L. The 
formulated bulk is then filtered into a stainless-steel mobile vessel. The filtered bulk is then 0.2 μm 
filtered into the active substance containers (Ethyl Vinyl Acetate – EVA - bags) for long-term storage at 
2-8°C. Shipment to the finished product manufacturing site is carried out using EVA bags. 
There is one optional step “controlled freeze, frozen storage and controlled thaw of the active 
substance” during the manufacturing process, to facilitate frozen storage of the active substance. The 
formulated bulk active substance is transferred through a filter into cryovessels and subjected to 
controlled freezing. The frozen bulk can be stored in stainless-steel cryovessels for up 48 months at -
40±10°C. The frozen active substance can be thawed and filtered into a stainless-steel mobile vessel. 
After the indicated hold times in mobile stainless-steel vessels at specified temperatures, the thawed 
active substance is again filtered into the EVA bags which are then shipped to the finished product 
manufacturing site to initiate the manufacturing process of the finished product. The applicant justified 
its strategy to include this optional manufacturing step as it is required for commercial supply and 
inventory management. The applicant clarified that the release testing of the active substance is 
performed on the bulk active substance under GMP part II (i.e. freezing, thawing, filtrations, storage 
and transfer between storage containers). This approach is considered unusual, however, all 
manufacturing steps between the bulk active substance and the active substance filled in EVA bags 
were appropriately validated and it was shown that after these additional processing steps, all quality 
attributes comply with the active substance specification. Further, bioburden and endotoxin testing are 
routinely performed at each filtration step to ensure the microbial quality of the active substance. 
Stability data under frozen and refrigerated storage conditions were provided and indicated that no 
significant change in product quality attributes was observed over the proposed storage hold times in 
the individual containers (stainless steels and EVA bags). In conclusion, the proposed strategy is not 
considered in conflict with GMP principles. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the proposed active 
substance manufacturing process and control strategy should be under intensive surveillance of the 
GMP supervisory authority during future inspections. 
Reprocessing steps have been adequately described by the applicant. 
The primary packaging component for the liquid active substance stored at 2-8°C is a disposable, 
single-use EVA bag, constructed from a multilayer film, with the product contact layer composed of 
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer and a gas barrier film composed of ethyl vinyl alcohol. The 
materials of construction of the individual components were provided and a representative certificate of 
release from the supplier was provided. Acceptance of the EVA bags for use is based on confirmation 
from the supplier’s CoA that all acceptance criteria were met. The bags are pre-sterilised by the vendor 
using validated gamma irradiation (25 kGy minimum) and a representative certificate of irradiation 
from the approved sub-contractor was also provided in the dossier. Compatibility of the active 
substance with EVA bags was demonstrated through stability studies. Extractables and leachables 
assessment for EVA bags was performed and the EVA bags were found to be of low risk for leachables 
upon review of data from the process qualification study. 
The mobile vessel and the cryovessel are both made of 316L stainless-steel (manufactured from non-
corroding chromium-nickel-molybdenum), cleaned-in-place (CIP), steamed-in-place (SIP) and 
integrity-tested via a pressure hold test prior to use. Both are equipped with a 0.2 μm liquid filter, so 
the active substance is filtered prior to entry into these containers. Compatibility of the active 
substance with stainless-steel cryovessels and mobile vessels was demonstrated through stability 
studies. The stainless-steel tanks are considered low risk for extractables and leachables. A risk 
EMA/42903/2023

assessment for the presence of elemental impurities has been performed by the applicant, in line with 
ICH Q3D, and the conclusion that no specific control of elemental impurities at the active substance 
level is endorsed. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information regarding the raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process 
has been submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding 
monograph, while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are 
presented.  
The preparation of cell culture media and nutrient feed was adequately described in the dossier. 
Storage temperature and storage duration were provided for both cell culture media and nutrient feed. 
Information related to the origin of the cell culture medium and specifications for the material were 
provided. No animal sourced ingredients or animal derived reagents are used in their manufacture. 
Materials of animal origin were used during cell line development and also in the banking of the master 
cell bank (MCB) and adequate information regarding these materials was included in the dossier. 
The tremelimumab antibody was initially generated in a hybridoma cell line. The genes encoding 
tremelimumab were isolated from hybridoma cells and were used for generation of the expression 
plasmid. 
The host cell line (NS0 mouse myeloma cell line) was used for the preparation of the production cell 
line by electroporation of NS0 cells with the expression plasmid. These cells were subsequently used to 
prepare a pre-MCB stock, which was tested for sterility and mycoplasma. 
A two-tiered cell banking system is used for tremelimumab manufacturing. Preparation of the MCB and 
WCB is adequately presented in the dossier. In line with ICH Q5D, 2 independent WCB storage sites 
are used to ensure continuous, uninterrupted production of pharmaceuticals in case of catastrophic 
events. The cell banks were tested for identity, purity, cell substrate stability including sterility, 
mycoplasma, adventitious viruses and genetic stability. MCB and limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) bank 
were also tested for infectious retroviruses. The range of used tests is considered sufficient in 
accordance with ICH Q5A requirements and all tests met the acceptance criteria. The results confirmed 
the identity, cell banks viability and that the cell banks are free of bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma and 
adventitious viruses. Phenotypic stability was demonstrated by assessing growth, productivity, and 
product quality for a certain number of days from the WCB thaw. The genetic stability of the 
expression plasmid and integrated genes for tremelimumab was characterised based on testing of the 
MCB, WCB, and the LIVCA bank. Based on cell line stability data and viral safety data from LIVCA, the 
limit of in vitro cell age is considered adequately justified. 
The applicant has provided a stability protocol for MCB and WCB, indicating the stability tests and the 
acceptance criteria. The stability programme with respect to growth and viability (recoverability) of the 
MCB and WCB was introduced with 5 years measure intervals. 
In conclusion, sufficient information is provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB and release of 
future WCBs. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of the critical IPCs and critical in-process tests (IPTs) applied throughout 
the active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information has been provided on the 
control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with 
regards to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and IPTs. Actions taken if limits are 
exceeded are specified.

Process validation 
A three-stage strategy is followed to define and validate the active substance manufacturing process 
throughout the process lifecycle. Stage 1 (process design) included the process characterization and 
determination of CPPs. Stage 2 (process qualification stage) included the evaluation of the process 
design to determine if the process is capable of reproducible commercial manufacturing. Stage 3 
(continued process verification) is considered as ongoing assurance gained during routine production 
that the process remains in a state of control.  
The overall approach is in line with ICH Q7 Guideline and it is considered acceptable. Process validation 
was completed using consecutive active substance lots at the proposed commercial manufacturing 
scale at the proposed manufacturer (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG - BIP). Continued 
process verification identified 2 new critical quality attributes (CQAs) which resulted in the re-
classification of some process parameters and hold times. Additional concurrent validation data 
demonstrated that results for the process parameters and process outputs for the recently produced 
lots are consistent with the outcomes of the prospective validation study. 
All manufacturing steps were covered during the process validation studies and the process parameters 
selected included all the CPPs and selected NCPPs, the latter being further classified as Key Process 
Parameters (KPPs) and Non-Key Process Parameters (NKPPs), based on their potential impact on 
process performance. Regarding the process outputs, results for IPCs, microbial controls (MCs) and 
performance attributes (PAs) were monitored in the process validation study. The validation 
acceptance criteria for monitored process parameters were established within the PARs which were 
determined based on process characterisation study. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the IPTs are fulfilled, demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces active substance of reproducible quality that complies with 
the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. Deviations observed in the process 
validation study were investigated and it was concluded that no impact on the process validation study 
could be expected. 
Process intermediates and active substance hold times were validated through a small-scale study 
evaluating biochemical hold stability and are supported by equipment qualification hold time studies, 
demonstrating effective microbial control. Resin lifetime and carryover studies were also conducted at 
small-scale to establish the maximum number of product-contacting cycles for each chromatography 
resin used in the purification process and to demonstrate that the cleaning procedures for the 
chromatography resins are sufficient to reduce carryover of protein and host cell DNA to acceptable 
levels. Overall, the validation lifetime and carryover studies met the acceptance criteria and therefore 
the proposed maximum number of product-contacting cycles for the affinity resin and maximum cycles 
for both ion exchange resins are considered acceptable. 
Filtration membrane studies were conducted at commercial scale to validate membrane carryover 
cleaning, reuse and storage for the filtration steps in the purification process. The target maximum 
number of membranes uses is adequately defined by the applicant. Validation of reprocessing steps 
was performed using small-scale studies. In line with the Guideline on process validation for the 
manufacture of biotechnology-derived active substances and data to be provided in the regulatory 
submission (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014), the verification protocols to be applied in case of the 
need for reprocessing at large scale were provided and are considered adequate. The applicant 
demonstrated the suitability of all components that come into contact with the active substance 
formulation during the manufacture. Materials evaluated for leachables and details regarding the risk 
assessment were provided. 
In conclusion, the active substance manufacturing process has been adequately validated.

Manufacturing process development 
Different manufacturing processes have been described. Process A to E batches were used in non-
clinical and clinical studies. All clinical studies in this application were conducted by AstraZeneca 
utilizing Process E (the intended commercial process) active substance lots. During the development, 
several formulations and manufacturing sites were used. The applicant adequately described changes 
that were made throughout the development of the manufacturing process, as well as the 
comparability assessments that were conducted. 
The applicant provided detailed results of analytical testing for the active substance lots manufactured 
from processes C, D and E. Furthermore, batch analysis data for process B and C and a summary of 
min-max ranges for early development Process A batches (used for early toxicology studies and non-
clinical PK study) were provided. Overall, the lots met the specifications in place at the time of release. 
Side-by-side testing of the characterization tests for each comparability assessment was summarized 
in tabular format. The results demonstrate that the active substance lots manufactured using Process 
C, D and E are highly comparable in terms of product quality, physicochemical and biological 
properties.  
Characterisation 
A comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation of the tremelimumab molecule was 
presented. The characterisation of tremelimumab involved primary structure, higher order structure, 
carbohydrate structure, charge and size heterogeneity, and biological properties. 
In conclusion, the active substance has been sufficiently characterised, revealing that tremelimumab 
has the expected structure of a human IgG2a subclass antibody. The analytical results are consistent 
with the proposed structure. 
Product-related impurities have been well characterised and studied. These attributes are considered 
CQA and the impact of these attributes on biological activity was adequately discussed. Adequate 
characterisation of product-related impurities has been presented, and therefore, the controls strategy 
for such impurities can be endorsed. 
Process-related impurities comprise of impurities which arise from the cell substrates, cell culture and 
purification processing. Clearance and control of process-related impurities have been sufficiently 
discussed. 
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Tremelimumab active substance specification has been defined in accordance with ICH Q6B and 
includes: general tests (clarity, colour, pH), oligosaccharide analysis, total protein content, identity, 
product-related impurities, process-related impurities), potency and safety attributes tests (bioburden, 
endotoxin). 
Results from the statistical analysis of both release and stability data were used to support the 
justification of the proposed specifications. Justification for the omission of certain tests has been 
adequately presented by the applicant. During the assessment, acceptance criteria for several quality 
attributes (i.e. purity, product-related impurities and potency) were tightened upon request. In 
conclusion, the proposed tests panel is considered appropriate and acceptance criteria clinically 
justified. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 18/162 
 
 
  
 
 
The analytical methods and acceptance criteria applied during stability studies are identical to the 
active substance release specifications, except for certain tests conducted only at release. The stability 
acceptance criteria are set wider than the release acceptance criteria for several parameters, which is 
in principle acceptable. As the number of available batches for setting the acceptance criteria was 
limited, the applicant should further revise the active substance stability specification acceptance 
criteria for these parameters, when data from additional batches are available (REC). 
Analytical methods 
Analytical procedures performed in accordance with Ph. Eur. are appearance (color, clarity), pH, 
bioburden and endotoxin. Non-compendial methods are generally described with a sufficient level of 
detail (including equipment, reagents, system suitability and sample acceptance criteria) and are 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The biological activity (potency) of the 
active substance is determined using a cell-based potency assay. 
Batch analysis 
The applicant provided detailed results of analytical testing for the active substance lots manufactured 
from processes C, D and E. The results are within the specifications in place at the time of release and 
confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
In addition, batch analyses data for Process B and Process C active substance lots were provided and 
min-max ranges for Process A lots were summarised. 
Reference materials 
The history of the used reference materials was provided. Several reference standards were used 
during development, however only the current primary reference standard (PRS) was used to test 
clinical material for this application. A two-tiered system of reference standards (PRS and working 
reference standard - WRS) is established and a portion of PRS was used as the first lot of WRS. Both 
PRS and WRS are representative of the production process and clinical performance and meet the 
release specifications. The preparation, storage and qualification of future standards was described in 
the dossier and is considered acceptable. 
EMA/42903/2023

2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The applicant proposed that the active substance shelf-life is up to 48 months storage at -50°C to -
30°C in stainless-steel vessels, followed by up to 24 months storage in EVA bags at 2°C to 8°C. The 
total storage duration should not exceed 72 months. 
The applicant provided stability data to support storage of frozen bulk active substance in stainless-
steel containers at -50°C to -30°C (long-term storage conditions), and 2-8°C and 23-27°C/55-65% RH 
(accelerated storage conditions). 
Stability studies for the frozen bulk active substance were performed using reduced-scale stainless-
steel containers (considered representative of the full-scale vessels) and lots manufactured at the 
commercial site (BIP) using the commercial manufacturing process (Process E). Long-term stability 
studies (48 months) are completed for 4 representative lots and for one lot data for 36 out of 48 
months have been provided. No meaningful change was observed under frozen storage conditions. The 
results demonstrate stability of the frozen bulk active substance at -50°C to -30°C in stainless-steel 
vessels for up to 48 months. 
Additionally, 12 months stability data have been provided for 5 bulk active substance lots stored at 
accelerated storage conditions (2-8°C and 23-27°C/55-65% RH). All stability lots met the acceptance 
criteria, however some trends in the studied parameters were observed which were more significant 
under storage at 23-27°C/55-65% RH. The applicant sufficiently discussed all these trends. Based on 
these results, the short-term storage of liquid active substance in stainless-steel containers is 
considered justified. 
The stability of the active substance when stored in EVA bags has been demonstrated for 36 months at 
5±3°C. Stability studies were performed using reduced-scale EVA bags and lots manufactured at the 
commercial site (BIP) using the commercial manufacturing process (Process E). 
Data from long-term (2-8°C, for 36 months) and accelerated (23-27°C/55-65% RH, for 6 months) 
stability studies were provided. Long-term studies are completed for 3 representative lots and for one 
lot data for 6 out of 36 months have been provided. 
Additionally, the applicant provided a summary of active substance photostability studies, conducted in 
accordance with ICH Q1B guideline. Based on the conclusions of these studies, the active substance 
should be protected from light during storage. 
A sequential stability study supporting the proposed cumulative shelf-life (48 months storage at -50°C 
to -30°C in stainless-steel vessels followed by up to 24 months storage in EVA bags at 2°C to 8°C) has 
not been performed. However, 3 active substance stability batches which were included in the stability 
study for the active substance filled in EVA bags for 36 months at 2°C to 8°C followed the 12 months 
storage in stainless steel tanks at -50°C to -30°C. Therefore, based on the overall presented stability 
data, the proposed cumulative shelf-life for the active substance is considered acceptable. The 
applicant committed to perform a sequential stability study utilizing at least one active substance batch 
stored in accordance with the above-mentioned conditions (REC). 
A post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment have been given. For ongoing studies any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA.

2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Tremelimumab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, liquid dosage form intended for 
intravenous infusion after dilution. The finished product is provided in 2 single-dose presentations: a 
25 mg/1.25 mL vial presentation and a 300 mg/15 mL vial presentation. 
Both presentations contain 20 mg/mL tremelimumab in 20 mM histidine/histidine-HCl monohydrate, 
222 mM trehalose dihydrate, 0.27 mM disodium edetate dihydrate and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 80. 
The finished product is filled with a volume in excess of the label-claim volume to meet the USP/Ph. 
Eur./JP test requirements. The proposed overfill volumes are 0.26 mL and 1 mL for 25 mg and 300 mg 
presentations respectively, resulting in target fill volumes of 1.51 mL and 16 mL. The proposed overfill 
was adequately justified based on development data. The finished product does not contain any 
overages. 
The primary packaging components consist of a type I borosilicate glass vial (2R or 20R) and grey 
butyl elastomer stopper (13 mm or 20 mm) capped with an aluminium seal. The vials comply with Ph. 
Eur. 3.2.1 for Type I borosilicate glass. The butyl elastomer stopper complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. 
Stoppers are silicone coated and the compliance with Ph. Eur. Monograph 3.1.8 was confirmed. 
Extractables and leachables from primary container components were evaluated based on a 3-stage 
risk-based strategy. All results were either below the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC), not 
detected over time or found below the established and toxicologically justified Permitted Daily 
Exposure (PDE) level. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by finished 
product stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
The active substance is delivered ready-to-fill and no formulation or dilution steps are performed 
during the finished product manufacturing process. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. No novel excipients or no excipients 
of human or animal origin are used in the finished product formulation. Compatibility of tremelimumab 
with these excipients was demonstrated in long-term stability studies. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The formulation composition was developed based on experience with the solubility, structural integrity 
and stability of the product. A summary of the formulation development studies was provided and the 
rationale for introduced changes to develop the intended commercial formulation was thoroughly 
discussed. A characterisation study was executed to evaluate the robustness of the intended 
commercial formulation, to identify any critical formulation parameters and to understand the impact 
of those critical parameters on the finished product CQAs. In conclusion, the suitability of the intended 
formulation has been demonstrated based on development studies. 
The applicant presented 4 versions of the manufacturing process used throughout the clinical 
development. Process 4 for the commercial 25 mg and 300 mg finished product vials uses Process E 
active substance. Overall, the finished product manufacturing process development was clearly 
described. The rationale of the performed changes throughout the development was discussed 
accordingly and did not raise concerns. 
Three studies were presented to demonstrate the comparability between lots produced in different 
stages of development. The performed comparability studies are considered well designed and in 
accordance with ICH Q5E guideline. The provided results demonstrate the comparability of the lots 
produced by different finished product manufacturing processes and sites. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 21/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Process characterisation studies were performed. Individual unit operations were evaluated regarding 
impact on CQAs and process performance parameters. Based on the results from the process 
characterisation studies, parameters that impact CQAs are classified as CPPs, while process parameters 
that do not impact any CQA are classified as NCPPs. Based on the tested ranges for process 
parameters, their respective PARs were defined. It was demonstrated that in the defined PARs there is 
no impact on the quality attributes of the product. As part of the characterisation study, the impact of 
manufacturing environment was evaluated. Leachables from in-process product contact materials were 
evaluated based on risk assessment. Potential leachables were found at concentrations well below the 
TTC limit. Therefore, the provided conclusion that the risk to patient safety is low is considered 
acceptable. 
In-use compatibility 
The finished product must be diluted into 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% (w/v) dextrose solutions prior to 
dose administration. Compatibility of the finished product was assessed in 250 mL polyolefin (PO) and 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) intravenous (IV) bags. Compatibility with PVC administration sets and 0.2 μm 
polyethersulfone in-line filters was also tested. 
In summary, the physical-chemical and microbiological in-use stability of the diluted product in IV bags 
has been demonstrated for up to 28 days at 2°C to 8°C and for up to 48 hours at room temperature 
(up to 30°C) from the time of preparation. The provided results support the proposed instructions for 
use and handling of the finished product stated in the SmPC (i.e., if not used immediately, in-use 
storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be normally 
longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C or 12 hours at room temperature (up to 25°C), unless dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions). 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured, filled, packaged, inspected and tested in accordance with GMP at 
qualified vendors. The finished product is released in the EEA by AstraZeneca AB, Gärtunavägen, SE-
151 85 Södertälje, Sweden. A process flow diagram for the manufacture of the finished product is 
provided in the dossier. Detailed descriptions of the manufacturing steps are presented. Batch formula 
has been provided for the intended commercial batch size ranges: for the 25 mg finished product (1.51 
mL target fill volume) and for the 300 mg finished product (16 mL target fill volume). 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of pre-filtration and pooling, mixing, and sterile 
filtration of the active substance, followed by aseptic vial filling and stoppering with sterile container 
closure components. There are no reprocessing steps in the finished product manufacturing process. 
Process control strategy is sufficiently detailed and considered acceptable. In line with the process 
characterisation study, CPPs and NCPPs are defined in the manufacturing process and controlled with 
appropriate limits. Elements of microbial control strategy were described in detail. Process parameters 
are monitored and maintained within established PARs. Overall, the manufacturing process and the 
equipment used are considered adequately described. 
The manufacturing process validation study was performed following a traditional approach. The 
manufacturing process was validated with consecutive lots for each vial presentation at the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site. Production scale process validation data were presented. All process 
parameters (CPPs, KPPs and NKPPS) were maintained within the specified operating ranges, based on 
PARs established in the characterisation study. To confirm process consistency, additional IPTs 
(process outputs) were monitored in the process validation study and all results fell within the 
predefined acceptance criteria. 
EMA/42903/2023

The pre-filtration and pooling process is designed to enable pooling of multiple active substance bags. 
The provided results demonstrate that homogeneity of the bulk active substance prior to filling is 
achieved and therefore, pooling and mixing of active substance is considered validated. 
The microbial control strategy includes process design and controls, material controls, facility controls, 
and testing. In the process validation study, all process steps were performed as expected and the 
results demonstrate adequate microbial control and sterility assurance. 
Sterilisation of primary container components is performed at the manufacturing site under GMP 
surveillance. The performed validation studies are in line with the Guideline on the sterilisation of the 
medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) and the provided data demonstrated the suitability of the 
selected sterilisation processes. 
Aseptic filling process is validated using media fill runs. The matrix approach alternates the smallest 
and largest vial format for media fill simulations. It is therefore ensured that the commercial batches 
are filled within the qualified aseptic filing time. 
Shipping qualification studies for the bulk vials and shipping validation for finished product packaging 
were performed. Details regarding the validation protocols and analytical testing results were provided 
in dossier and are considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, the validation study demonstrated consistency and robustness of the manufacturing 
process for both product presentations. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The proposed release specifications for the finished product were defined in accordance with ICH Q6B. 
The finished product specification for both 25 mg and 300 mg presentation is generally based on the 
active substance release specification and includes general testing (appearance, osmolarity, pH, sub-
visible particles, extractable volume), quantity testing, identity testing, purity testing, charge 
heterogeneity testing, potency testing and safety attributes testing (sterility and endotoxin). Most of 
the quality attributes are also tested during stability with wider acceptance criteria. 
Overall, the selection of tests is endorsed and the proposed acceptance criteria are generally 
acceptable. Acceptance criteria for product-related impurities and variants were revised during the 
procedure to better reflect the clinically qualified ranges. However, as number of available batches for 
setting the acceptance criteria was limited, the applicant should revise the finished product release and 
stability specification acceptance criteria when data from an additional 30 batches are available (REC). 
No additional impurities are introduced in the finished product manufacturing process. Product-related 
impurities are tested as part of release specification and monitored in stability studies. Process-related 
impurities are controlled in finished product release and stability specifications. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 23/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Detailed assessment of elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline was provided. It is 
concluded that the overall risk of a potential release of elemental impurities into the finished product is 
low and no specific control is considered necessary. This conclusion is agreed. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. Most of the analytical methods used for the 
finished product testing are identical to the ones used for testing of the active substance. Transfer of 
analytical methods between testing sites has been successfully completed. 
Batch analysis 
Summary of individual batch release results for Process 3 (clinical, stability) and Process 4 (validation, 
commercial, clinical, stability) lots was included in the dossier. Results for finished product lots 
manufactured by Process 3 and finished product 25 mg lots and 300 mg lots manufactured by Process 
4 were provided. Only a summary of historic ranges of quality attributes were provided for Process 1 
and Process 2 finished product lots, which is acceptable. The results are within the specifications set in 
place at the time of release and confirm consistency of the finished product manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
See active substance section on Reference materials. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The finished product stability studies were performed at long-term storage conditions (2-8°C), 
accelerated conditions (23-27°C/55-65% RH) and stressed conditions (38-42°C/70-80% RH), in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. In addition, photostability studies were conducted in accordance with 
ICH Q1B guideline. The stability studies are performed using the proposed commercial primary 
container and closure systems. 
Tremelimumab 25 mg and 300 mg commercial presentations (Process 4) and 400 mg presentation 
(Process 3, used during finished product development) were included in stability studies. Concerning 
the 25 mg finished product presentation, stability data are provided, with three process validation (PV) 
lots designated the primary stability lots. Stability testing is ongoing for additional lots manufactured 
post-PV. For the 400 mg strength, stability data are provided for multiple production scale lots (PV and 
post-PV lots). These data are included as primary data for the 300 mg finished product presentation 
and supporting data for the 25 mg presentation. For the 300 mg finished product presentation, 
stability data are provided for 3 PV lots. Results for elemental impurities from leachable studies for up 
to 48 months are available for the 25 mg presentation and only initial values were provided for the 300 
mg presentation. The elemental impurities stability testing and the formal stability study for the 300 
mg vial presentation are still ongoing and the applicant committed to submit the results for Agency 
review when available (REC). 
The claimed finished product shelf-life of 48 months at 2-8°C for both 25 mg and 300 mg 
presentations was established based on real-time data (up to 48 months) for the 25 mg presentation 
at long-term storage conditions. Data for 300 mg presentation are currently very limited (up to 6 
months), however, up to 48 months of stability data were provided for the 400 mg presentation used 
during finished product development. The applicant proposes that a combination of stability data from 
the 400 mg vial presentation and 25 mg vial presentation could be considered in the assignment of 
shelf-life for the 300 mg vial presentation. Suitability of this approach was thoroughly discussed. An 
identical primary container is used for both 400 mg and 300 mg presentations. All finished product 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 24/162 
 
 
  
 
 
presentations have the same formulation, are produced using active substance from the commercial 
process and the comparability between finished product Process 3 and Process 4 materials was 
demonstrated. Taken together, all these considerations and the comparison of stress stability study 
data demonstrating the highly comparable degradation profiles between the 25 mg and the 300 mg 
presentations, it is agreed that the data for 25 mg and 400 mg finished product presentations may be 
extrapolated to support the proposed shelf-life claim for the 300 mg finished product presentation. 
The provided stability data at accelerated stability conditions support the proposed finished product 
total time out of refrigerator of 30 days, as detectable changes are observed only after 2-6 months at 
23-27°C/55-65% RH, with no significant degradation trend. 
Thermal stress stability studies (38-42°C/70-80% RH) were performed to reveal the finished product 
degradation profile. Up to 6 months of stability data for the 400 mg and 25 mg presentations and 3 
months for the 300 mg presentation are available. Clear degradation trends were observed for purity, 
methionine oxidation and charge heterogeneity. Slight decrease in potency was observed. It was 
demonstrated that changes in quality profile under stress conditions are detectable by suitable 
analytical methods and attributes like purity, charge heterogeneity and potency are considered stability 
indicating. 
Finished product lots exposed to light showed an increase in acidic variants, higher methionine 
oxidation rate, and a slight decrease in purity. No significant differences were observed for other 
quality attributes, including potency. It is therefore agreed that the finished product should be stored 
protected from light. 
In conclusion, based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf-life for the finished product of 
48 months and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not 
freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect from light) are acceptable. Reconstitution and 
in-use instructions in the SmPC are consistent with the reported stability findings of the in-use studies, 
as previously discussed. 
A post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment have been given. For ongoing studies any 
confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. The ongoing stability programme will be followed up by the annual incorporation 
of at least one additional commercial-scale batch as stated in a stability commitment. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Materials of animal origin were used only during cell line development as well as during preparation of 
specified cell banks and used also during cryopreservation of the specified cell banks. Certificates of 
analysis including information regarding the origin and certificates of suitability (CEPs) issued by the 
European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) were provided for all these 
materials. A TSE/BSE (Transmissible/Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) risk assessment for all these 
materials was performed with the conclusion that the risk of transmission of TSE/BSE from these 
materials is extremely low, which is endorsed. The applicant also provided the certificate of origin for 
the cell culture medium. This material is considered sufficiently documented, with negligible TSE/BSE 
risk of transmission. 
A comprehensive programme, in accordance with ICH Q5A, is employed to test, evaluate and eliminate 
the potential risks of adventitious and endogenous viral agents. The programme includes control of raw 
materials used in the manufacturing, viral testing and characterisation of the cell banks (MCB, WCB, 
LIVCA) used in the GMP process, virus testing of UPB and viral clearance and inactivation assessment 
of the purification process. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 25/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Viral clearance capability of the active substance purification process was evaluated in scale-down 
experiments using 4 model viruses. The viral clearance experiments were performed matching pre-
defined acceptance ranges for process parameters and performance outputs. The level of purification 
of the scaled-down version was shown to be representative of the production procedure. 
All viral clearance experiments were performed in duplicate. The lower log10 reduction value (LRV) 
from the duplicate experiments was used to calculate cumulative LRV. The viral clearance experiments 
demonstrated that the purification process provides a cumulative LRV of ≥21.16, ≥18.28, ≥17.05, and  
≥16.49, respectively, for the 4 model viruses. For the chromatography steps, the used chromatography 
resin provided LRVs either comparable to (within 0.5 log10) or better than the new chromatography 
resin, demonstrating that resin reuse has no negative impact on the viral clearance capacity of the 
chromatography steps. The resin sanitisation and storage studies demonstrated that the solutions used 
for the sanitisation and storage of the resins meet acceptable levels of antimicrobial efficacy and that 
the risk of cross contamination is minimal. 
Endogenous retrovirus-like particles (RLPs) may be present in the cell line used to produce the 
tremelimumab active substance. These particles are measured by TEM analysis of the UPB. A safety 
factor for the removal of RLPs was calculated, resulting in a factor of greater than 9.0 log10 for the 
removal of endogenous virus, which is equivalent to less than 1 retrovirus-like particle for every 1.0 × 
109 doses of tremelimumab. The results are considered adequate. 
2.4.3.6.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.7.  Post-approval change management protocol(s) 
The applicant introduced a Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) to support the use of 
alternative single-use disposable filters across a number of steps in the active substance 
manufacturing process. Details regarding the planned technical assessment, assessment of 
extractables and leachables, small-scale studies and at-scale verification studies for the purpose of 
demonstration of comparability were provided. The upcoming changes will not have an impact on the 
composition, active substance and finished product specifications, active substance manufacturing 
process, critical steps, in-process controls or hold times and at-scale active substance batches will be 
placed on stability. Overall, the proposed PACMP is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product, which pertain to lack of data for cumulative active 
substance stability study, revision and potentially tightening of the active substance stability 
specification and finished product release/shelf-life specification acceptance criteria for product-related 
impurities and variants when additional data become available and submission of elemental impurity 
stability testing and formal stability study results for the 300 mg finished product presentation. These 
points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 26/162 
 
 
  
 
 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. The applicant should review and, if found appropriate, revise the active substance stability 
specification and finished product release/shelf-life specification acceptance criteria when data from an 
additional 30 batches are available. 
2. The applicant should perform a sequential stability study according to the post-approval sequential 
stability protocol and provide the results supporting a shelf-life for the active substance of 48 months 
storage at -40°C ± 10°C in stainless-steel vessels, followed by up to 24 months storage in EVA bags at 
5°C ± 3°C (for a total of up to 72 months). 
3. The elemental impurities stability testing and the formal stability study for the 300 mg finished 
product presentation are still ongoing. The results should be submitted for Agency’s review when 
available. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive package of in vitro and in vivo studies was designed to characterize the 
pharmacological properties of tremelimumab with respect to mechanism of action and antitumor 
activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicological profile. 
Based on the selective binding to human and cynomolgus monkey CTLA-4, the cynomolgus monkey 
was considered to be the only pharmacologically relevant species for assessment of nonclinical safety 
of tremelimumab. Tremelimumab binds to recombinant cynoCTLA-4 (rcynoCTLA-4) with binding affinity 
comparable to that for the binding to recombinant human CTLA-4  
The nonclinical safety testing strategy for tremelimumab appears to meet the requirements as outlined 
in relevant ICH guidance, including ICH S6(R1), ‘Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived 
Pharmaceuticals’, and ICH S9, ‘Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals’. All pivotal 
nonclinical safety studies were conducted in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) member country in accordance with OECD GLP guidance. The IV route of 
administration was used for nonclinical toxicity studies as this is the intended clinical route of 
administration. No safety or general toxicity studies were presented for the combination of 
tremelimumab and durvalumab. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Tremelimumab is a fully human immunoglobulin gamma-2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
engineered to bind to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152), a cell surface 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 27/162 
 
 
  
 
 
receptor expressed on activated T cells. Upon T-cell activation, CTLA-4 expression is upregulated and 
acts to dampen immune responses, modulating and eventually switching off T-cell activation. The 
natural ligands for CTLA-4 are CD80 [B7.1] and CD86 [B7.2], which are present on antigen-presenting 
cells (APCs). Binding of CTLA-4 to CD80/CD86 functions to limit T-cell activation, primarily by 
competing with CD28 for access to CD80/CD86 (Walker and Sansom 2015).  
In vitro, tremelimumab enhances T-cell function, measured by increased release of interleukin 2 (IL-
2), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and other cytokines (Tarhini and Kirkwood 2008).  
In animal models of cancer, blockade of CTLA-4 function using anti-mouse CTLA-4 antibodies results in 
enhanced T cell function and antitumor activity that is enhanced by concomitant PD-L1 blockade (Wu 
et al 2012). 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro Pharmacology 
Selectivity of tremelimumab was demonstrated by comparing binding to rhCTLA-4-Ig and 3 related 
proteins (hCD28-Ig, hB7.2, and hIgG1) at 1 (n=5), 10 (n=5), 100 (n=2) and 300 (n=2) µg/mL using 
ELISA to quantify the binding. Selectivity was >500 in most instances except one at 1 µg/mL in which 
the selectivity was only 14 towards B7.2.  
In a more functional assay of binding, activated T cells was used to demonstrate that tremelimumab 
(CP-675,206 at 10 µg/mL) only bind to human and monkey CTLA-4. No binding to activated T cells 
from rat, mouse, hamster, or rabbit could be detected (Report 15-CP-675,206). For the mouse a 
positive control was included. It was stated in the report that tremelimumab in excess generally 
displayed ~ 3-fold higher total binding (surface plus intracellular) to stimulated human CD3+ cells than 
to rhesus or cynomolgus CD3+ cells as judged by median fluorescence intensities. The affinity of 
tremelimumab to rhCTL-4 and rcynoCTLA-4 was quantified using the BIAcore 2000 technology showing 
a slight difference in KD values for binding of tremelimumab to rhCTLA-4 and rcynoCTLA-4. KD values 
were 0.28 and 0.98 nM, respectively (Report 14-CP-675,206).  
It was demonstrated that tremelimumab inhibited CD80 and CD86 binding in a competitive ELISA 
assay with sub-nanomolar EC50s (0.78 and 0.46 nM respectively, Report 03-CP-675,206).  
In a functional assay of activated primary human T cells cocultured with Raji cells expressing CD80 and 
CD 86 an increase in secretion of IL2 (510%) and INF-γ (54%) was observed when treated with 
tremelimumab at 30 µg/mL as compared to the negative isotype control anti-KLH (Report 02-CP-
675,206). This concentration corresponds to Cmax after the fifth dose at the lower end of patient body 
weight quartiles (POP PK report) and therefore can be considered clinically relevant. 
The involvement of CD80 and CD86 was further demonstrated in a superantigen assay (Report 08-CP-
675,206) according to which, the following was concluded: Effects of B7 blockade on IL-2 production 
and enhancement of IL-2 by tremelimumab at 30 µg/mL were tested in staphylococcal enterotoxin A 
(SEA)-stimulated human PBMC and blood cultures from 3 healthy donors. Anti-B7.1 and anti-B7.2 
antibodies (CD80 and CD86) and CTLA4-Ig (all at 30 µg/mL) were used to block B7 signalling. In PBMC 
cultures, blockade of B7.2 or B7.1 plus B7.2 reduced IL-2 baseline levels and also enhancement of IL-2 
produced by tremelimumab by 89% to 100%. Blockade of B7.1 (CD80) was less effective, inhibiting 
both baseline IL-2 and IL-2 enhancement by tremelimumab by ~ 50%. In general, blockade of B7 in 
human blood cultures produced similar results to PBMC cultures with slightly less reduction of baseline 
IL-2 or enhancement of IL-2 induced by tremelimumab. These studies clearly demonstrate that SEA 
superantigen stimulation is highly B7 dependent (08-CP-675,206). 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 28/162 
 
 
  
 
 
In study 01-CP-675,206 PBMC and blood from further 15 healthy donors was used in the SEA assay to 
demonstrate that tremelimumab enhanced the production of IL-2 as compared to anti-KLH isotype 
control. 
The final study using the SAE assay on human biomaterial included PBMC and blood from further 15 
healthy donors and from >80 cancer patients as well (Report 13-CP-675-206). Tumour types included 
prostate (minimal and advanced disease), renal, rectal, colon, ovarian, melanoma, non- Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL), and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but not NSCLC. Although the numerical IL-2 response was 
variable and PBMCs and blood from a few patients did not respond to tremelimumab, the increase in 
IL-2 response at 30 µg/mL tremelimumab can be considered consistent as observed across the range 
of tumour types in this study. Moreover, the response was also demonstrated to be concentration 
dependent with enhancement of IL-2 production from 10 µg/mL and to increase further at 30 and 100 
µg/mL. 
Similarly, cultures of whole blood from 5 cynomolgus monkeys confirmed that tremelimub enhanced 
IL-2 production in the SEA assay at 30 µg/mL (Report 04-CP-675,206). Hence, the cynomolgus 
monkey is considered pharmacologically relevant. 
As stated by Ohue, 2019, regulatory T cells (T-regs) suppress the activation of other T-cell populations 
and that Tegs are recruited into the microenvironment inside cancer tumours to enhance tumour 
immunity. 
Study 11-cp-675-206 was aimed at determining if blockade of CTLA4 by tremelimumab affects the 
ability of peripheral blood human Treg cells (CD4+CD25+) to inhibit IFN-γ production or 3H-thymidine 
incorporation of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activated T responder cells (CD4+CD25-) in an in vitro co-culture 
system. Treg cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. FACS analyses indicated that 
84% ± 5% of the isolated CD4+ Tregs were CD25+ and Foxp3+. 
Under the assay conditions, a 2:1 ratio of peripheral blood Treg cells cultured with T responder cells 
markedly inhibited IFN-γ production and 3H-thymidine incorporation compared to cultures without Treg 
cells. Moreover, these studies indicated that tremelimumab does not reverse the ability of human 
peripheral Tregs to suppress IFN-γ production or thymidine incorporation of stimulated human 
peripheral T responder cells at 30 or 100 µg/mL. 
Studies in mice suggested that anti-CTLA-4 mAbs may also selectively deplete intratumoral FOXP3+ 
regulatory T cells via an Fc-dependent mechanism. In a key publication by Sharma et al, 2019, it is 
shown that ipilimumab and tremelimumab are not depleting intratumoral FOXP3+Tregs in human 
cancers and that this represents an opportunity for future improvement of these types of cancer 
treatments. Hence, for tremelimumab, increased activation of effector T-cells is the more likely 
mechanism of action. 
In vivo Pharmacology 
A mouse surrogate antibody (hamster anti-mouse CTLA-4 mAb named 9H10) of tremelimumab showed 
relevant efficacy in a mouse tumour model (12-cp-675-206). Syngeneic SA1N fibrosarcoma cells were 
injected subcutaneously into A/J mice (5/group). Treatment with 9H10 at 200 µg on day 0, 3 and 6 
resulted in a 90% reduction in average tumour size on Day 28 compared to treatment with an isotype-
control Ab. Plasma-concentrations of 9H10 24 hours after administration was 102 μg/mL and 
decreased to 34 μg/mL 3 days later, hence were somewhat higher than clinically relevant. Further 
studies showed a dose dependent tumour reduction at 200, 100 and 50 µg, although with no effect at 
25 µg. Hence, a mouse surrogate of tremelimumab demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in a mouse 
tumour model, when treatment was initiated at the same day as the inoculation. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 29/162 
 
 
  
 
 
All previous studies were conducted at Pfizer Groton. A new proof of concept study was sponsored by 
AstraZeneca (experimental work in 2017 and 2018, report signed 2021) demonstrating 
pharmacological activity of murine surrogates for tremelimumab and durvalumab in mouse syngeneic 
tumour models (ONC1123-0001). 
In this study, treatment was initiated when the tumours reached 100 to 150 mm3 and can therefore be 
considered more clinically relevant than study 12-CP-675,206 in which treatment was initiated at the 
time of inoculation. 
The anti-mouse CTLA-4 mIgG1 tremelimumab surrogate mAb demonstrated modest antitumor activity 
as monotherapy, but good effect in combination with anti-PD-L1 in the EMT6 breast and CT26 colon 
syngeneic mouse tumour models (tumour growth and survival).  
Figure 1: Survival curves for CT26 antitumor efficacy study - Experiment 1 
Likewise, the tremelimumab surrogate showed combination activity with anti-PD-L1 therapy in the 
MCA205 fibrosarcoma model, but no relevant effect as monotherapy. However, the effects were not 
fully comparable, while the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab monotherapy increase the 
efficacy in colon model, in breast model, the combination effect is mainly due to durvalumab, thus in 
this case, addition of tremelimumab do not provide an increase in efficacy compared to durvalumab 
monotherapy. Likewise, the tremelimumab surrogate showed combination activity with anti-PD-L1 
therapy in the MCA205 fibrosarcoma model, but no relevant effect as monotherapy. Monotherapy and 
combination with anti-PD-L1 also induced in-tumour CD4+ or CD8+ T cell proliferation in these 3 
mouse tumour models, demonstrating the pharmacodynamic activity of the tremelimumab surrogate 
with respect to T-cell activation. As shown previously in vitro for tremelimumab, that peripheral Tregs 
was not depleted (11-CP-675,206), the tremelimumab surrogate did not deplete peripheral Tregs in 
vivo, establishing the mAb as a relevant surrogate to explore the pharmacodynamic and antitumor 
activity in these mouse syngeneic tumour models.  
A study entitled “Profiling of Biomarkers Relevant to Immunotherapies in Paediatric Solid Tumours” 
was included in the submission. Immunohistochemistry data for PD-L1 and CD8 were generated for 76 
and 77 paediatric tumours, respectively. Only one sample was positive for PD-L1 staining, defined as ≥ 
1% of TC expression of PD-L1. The level of CD8 T-cell infiltration within the paediatric tumours was 
relatively low as compared to adult tumours. Overall, these IHC data suggest a limited immune 
response against these pediatric tumours. 
It was further concluded that these data were illustrative of a group of samples with relatively low 
levels of mutation and with a limited degree of immunogenicity and immune activation. These 
characteristics suggest that checkpoint blockade, using molecules such as durvalumab and 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 30/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
tremelimumab, would be unlikely to result in significant activity in paediatric tumours, and is in 
keeping with the relatively low levels of activity observed to date for similar molecules in this setting. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Study 07-CP-675,206 showed that plate-bound tremelimumab did not inhibit T cell activation in the 
SEA assay (0.01-100 µg/mL) as the IL-2 response was not changing in any direction at any plating-
concentration. This is presented as a surrogate measure of non-specific surface bound or aggregated 
tremelimumab in vivo in which then tremelimumab is not expected to have any effect.  
In study 05-CP-675,206 tremelimumab was added to unstimulated human whole blood from healthy 
volunteers at concentrations of 10 or 100 μg/mL and did not induce levels of TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β in 
vitro that would be predictive of cytokine release syndrome in vivo. The positive control anti-CD3 
induced cytokine release as expected in this assay. Hence, tremelimumab is not expected to induce 
spontaneous cytokine release in vivo, which is confirmed in clinical trials. 
Study 10-CP-675,206 evaluated whole blood incubated with tremelimumab and a positive control 
antibody CP-642,570. Only the positive control reduced platelet number in the incubations. 
Tremelimumab and the negative control antibody anti-KLH did not reduce platelet numbers over the 24 
-hour period the experiment lasted. It is agreed that data do not indicate that tremelimumab could 
elicit any effect in platelet counts at concentrations up to 30 g/ml. This is similar to the concentrations 
reached in human plasma after the 75 mg dose (Cmax 26.8 g/ml), thus no safety margin has been 
established. Nevertheless, thrombocytopenia is a very common side-effect of tremelimumab, when 
administered in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy. It appears to be due 
to the platinum-based chemotherapy, since durvalumab monotherapy is not inducing 
thrombocytopenia (Imfinzi SPC). 
A human IgG1 antibody has much higher affinity for most human Fcγ receptors compared to a human 
IgG2 antibody such as tremelimumab. A study (16-CP-675,206) of competitive binding between a low 
concentration of 125I-labeled antibody compared to when added 500-fold excess of unlabeled antibody 
to blood leucocytes, showed that an average of 53%, 43%, and 62% of the binding of hIgG1 antibody 
was inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled IgG1 antibody to human healthy donor, human prostate 
cancer patient, or cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leukocytes. An average of 0%, 15%, and 2% 
of the binding of tremelimumab was inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled tremelimumab to human 
healthy donor, human prostate cancer patient, or cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood leukocytes. 
These results indicate that tremelimumab shows minimal specific binding to Fc receptor-bearing 
leukocytes, whether originating from humans or cynomolgus monkeys or cancer patients. Hence, Fc 
binding is not anticipated to be part of the mechanism of action of tremelimumab. Moreover, the 
tremelimumab binding to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb and FcγRIII was evaluated using SPR assays and the 
KD obtained are not expected to be reached in the clinical setting. 
In a study of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against naïve and activated 
human T cells using a FACS-based assay (09-cp-675-206), it was demonstrated that tremelimumab 
(100 μg/mL) added to naïve or anti-CD3/CD28 activated human T cells ± IL-2- activated NK cells (up 
to an effector-to-target ratio of 25:1) produced no increases in ADCC compared to the no-treatment 
controls. The positive control anti-CD3 (Mu-IgG2a) did induce T-cell toxicity in both naïve and 
activated T cells in this assay. Hence, ADCC is not anticipated to be part of the mechanism of action of 
tremelimumab. CDC risk was evaluated using doses below clinical concentration (5 µg/ml). CDC 
activity was not seen in cells incubated with tremelimumab under this condition.  However, given the 
lack of effects on T cell depletion in the non-clinical in vivo studies and clinical studies, it is likely that 
the occurrence of CDC in vivo does not occur at biological relevant levels.

2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were conducted for tremelimumab. This is acceptable and 
according to guideline, especially when non-human primate is the only relevant species. 
ECG, heart rate, blood pressure and vital signs (respiration rate and body temperature) was evaluated 
twice pre-dose and 5 min post dose in the GLP single dose study (tmax) and on several occasions 
during the dosing and recovery phase in the two repeat-dose studies. No dose-related changes from 
normal were observed in any study or on any occasion. 
No dedicated CNS safety study was conducted. Instead, daily observations of the behaviour of the 
animals during the studies served this purpose. This is also acceptable as it is not expected that 
tremelimumab will cross the blood brain barrier. Any CNS effects is expected to be secondary to the 
pharmacological effect of increased systemic inflammation. Histopathology revealed mononuclear cell 
infiltration of choroid plexus of the brain and pituitary in the 6 months repeat-dose study. Dose-related 
mononuclear cell inflammation was present in kidney. Clinical signs of diarrhoea in the 50 mg/kg/week 
group generally correlated with inflammation in the cecum and colon. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies of tremelimumab were submitted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis 
An ELISA bioanalytical method was developed and revised over the time providing versions each of 
which was validated according to GLP and used for the three pivotal studies in monkeys. For the 6-
month toxicity and the EFD study an ELISA method validated as described in report DM2004-675206-
014 was used. These studies were conducted in 2005 and 2007, prior to issuing of the current 
bioanalytical guidelines. Hence, incurred sample reproducibility was not demonstrated. Nevertheless, 
the bioanalytical method appears to have been in good control and to be validated in GLP compliance 
according to common practice at the time of conduct including e.g. dilutional integrity up to 2000-fold, 
hook effect and specificity. 
In the assay, the ELISA plate was coated with a capture antigen (human CD152/CTLA-4). The samples 
were aliquoted in duplicate and allowed to incubate. The drug-antigen complex was then detected 
using a biotin-mouse anti-human IgG2 conjugate and a streptavidin HRP conjugate. A colorimetric 
signal is produced using a commercial TMB substrate solution. The intensity of color generated is 
directly proportional to the concentration of tremelimumab in the sample. Sample concentrations were 
determined by interpolation from a standard curve which was fit using a four-parameter curve fit. The 
minimum required dilution (MRD) for all samples was 1:20 and the required sample volume was 0.050 
mL in duplicate. The quantitation range was 156 to 3000 ng/mL. Samples were stored at a nominal 
temperature of -80˚ C prior to analysis. Using this method, stability at -80˚ was demonstrated in 
monkey plasma for 174 days. 
ADA analysis 
GLP compliant ADA analysis was used in the 1 month and 6 months toxicity studies (validation report 
DM2007-675206-022 from 2001). Samples were collected in the EFD study, but not analysed, since 
pharmacokinetics implied that this was not necessary. This is accepted. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 32/162 
 
 
  
 
 
The ADA method was a qualitative sandwich ELISA assay in which the plate was coated with F(ab’)2 
fragments prepared from tremelimumab. Anti-tremelimumab antibodies in plasma was then captured 
by the immobilised tremelimumab F(ab’)2- fragment, washed and then detected and visualized by 
Protein G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). A normal 
cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma pool and a reference standard plasma (diluted 1:500, 1:1500, and 
1:4500) were included on each plate as negative and positive controls, respectively. Results were 
reported as the net signal at the 1:500 dilution if not ≥3.0, then the 1:1500 was reported.  
The reference standard plasma was pooled plasma from eighteen monkeys that received a single dose 
of tremelimumab. The plasma was collected following clearance of tremelimumab as measured by 
ELISA. This reference standard served as a quality control sample in all subsequent assays. 
This is not the state of the art, however it appears to be a feasible way of determining ADA. 
Reference range, dilution effects, stability, lot to lot variation of the negative control and intra/inter 
assay variability (robustness) was included in the validation. Long term stability was not presented. In 
this assay ADA could not be detected in the presence of tremelimumab above LLOQ of the bioanalytical 
method. A new method was developed for clinical samples with good assay drug tolerance. 
NAb assay 
Positive samples identified in the ADA assay were subjected to a nAb assay, which was also validated 
(validation report DM2007-675206-023). 
A non-functional qualitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique was utilized to determine anti-
tremelimumab neutralizing antibodies to tremelimumab F(ab')2 in cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma. 
with specificity and sufficient affinity to disrupt the binding of tremelimumab to its ligand (CTLA4) in 
cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma. 
Samples were diluted with CTLA4/Ig and incubated with F(ab')2 fragments prepared from 
tremelimumab which had been immobilized on an ELISA plate. After incubation, unbound material was 
washed away and CTLA4/Ig was detected using goat anti-mouse Ig-HRP and visualized with TMB. A 
normal cynomolgus sodium heparin plasma pool and a reference standard plasma (diluted 1:10, 1:50, 
and 1:100) were included on each plate as negative and positive controls. The presence of nAb is 
indicated by a reduction in signal intensity as compared to normal cynomolgus monkey plasma (naive 
to tremelimumab). Study samples were run at 1:10 and 1:50 dilution, and the results were reported as 
the percentage of normal plasma signal generated by a dilution of test plasma in a given concentration 
of CTLA4IIg (10 ng/mL). This is considered an acceptable strategy for a nAb assay. It should be 
mentioned that the nAb assay was not functional in the presence of tremelimumab above LLOQ of the 
bioanalytical assay. 
Absorption 
Absorption was evaluated for the subcutaneous route at 5 mg/kg. Bioavalability was 54% when 
comparing clearance/F for SC administration with mean clearance from two studies of 0.75 mg/kg IV. 
It should be noted that tremelimumab is for intravenous administration together with durvalumab in a 
hospital setting. Hence this study is of minor clinical relevance. Pharmacokinetics after intravenous 
administration is discussed in section Other pharmacokinetic studies below. 
Distribution 
As expected for a monoclonal antibody, volume of distribution is mostly confined to the vascular space 
as the volume of distribution in monkey demonstrate (Vss = 54 mL/kg). 
Metabolism 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 33/162 
 
 
  
 
 
There is no evidence of nonlinearity of the pharmacokinetics of tremelimumbab over the dose range of 
0.75 to 100 mg/kg single dose. Therefore, it can be assumed that tremelimumab is not cleared via 
target mediated disposition but only through proteolytic degradation and catabolism. 
Excretion 
Excretion was not studied for tremelimumab. This is acceptable due to nature of the molecule and that 
it is expected to be cleared as small peptides or amino-acids or incorporated in the endogenous 
aminoacid pool. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Pharmakokinetic drug interactions were not studied. This is acceptable as PK drug interactions are not 
expected. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Single dose IV pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of clonally and non-clonally derived tremelimumab was evaluated after IV 
administration of 0.75 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkey. This is a very low dose compared to the highest 
doses used in the toxicity studies (50 and 30 mg/kg/week). Minor differences in Vss (0.0705 and 
0.0538 L/kg), clearance (0.00339 and 0.00300 mL/min/kg) and resulting half-life (11 and 9.1 days), 
for clonally and non-clonally derived tremelimumab were observed.  
A single dose toxicity study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 10, 30 and 100 
mg/kg. The toxicokinetic report was very brief providing only Cmax, Tmax and AUC and no 
pharmacokinetic profiles. A trend towards lower increments in systemic levels at lower dose ranges in 
all pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies were observed. For example, when comparing AUC0-tlast 
for 0.75 and 10 mg/kg, the increase in dose of 13.3-fold (from 0.75 to 10 mg/kg) only increased AUC 
by 7.8 and 6.8, the increase in dose of 3-fold (from 10 to 30 mg/kg) increased AUC by 2.3 and the 
increase in dose of 3.3-fold (from 30 to 100 mg/kg) increased AUC by 3.1. In addition, in the 1-mont 
and 6-month toxicity studies, accumulation on Day 29 was more pronounced at the lowest dose (AUC0-
24h D29/ AUC0-24h D1 were 1.8 and 1.6 at 5 mg/kg, 1.1 at 15 mg/kg and 1.4 at 50 mg/kg).  
New submitted PK data support that the higher accumulation observed at the lowest dose might be 
due to lower CL, although the high variability in exposure hinders understanding the PK profile of 
tremelimumab in animals. Despite the observed variability in exposure might be due to the impact of 
ADA on clearance of tremelimumab, it should be noted that the ADA analysis was limited to samples 
that showed pre-dose exposure below LLOQ (8/30 and 7/28 animals in the 1-month and 6 months 
toxicity studies, respectively) and thus, are limited to conclude the impact of ADA in exposure 
variability. 
It should be noted that the dose of 0.75 mg/kg is the most clinically relevant. The dose in patients is a 
flat dose of 75 mg every 3 weeks providing Cmax in the range of 22 to 30 µg/mL at the fifth dose. This 
is closely comparable to Cmax in the monkeys administered a single dose of 0.75 mg/kg of 25-30 
µg/mL. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics was evaluated in the 1-month toxicology study in which tremelimumab was 
administered IV once weekly at 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg (DM2001-675206-006). A few animals showed 
concentrations of tremelimumab above LLOQ at Day 1. However, so low as this is not anticipated to 
impact the conclusions of the study. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 34/162 
 
 
  
 
 
No gender-related differences in exposure was observed, why data was pooled across gender. AUC 
increased according to increase in dose on day 1, however slightly more than dose-proportional on Day 
29. 
Slight accumulation was observed as a result of pre-dose plasma concentration being 30-50% of Cmax 
over the following doses. The accumulation was most pronounced at the lowest dose. This could be 
due to neutralising antidrug antibodies at the lower dose levels, see belowAUC0-30days was 69500 
µg/mL*h at 5 mg/kg (NOAEL). This could roughly be compared to AUC3weeks after fifth dose in patients 
of 6360 µg/mL*hours. Hence, in this study the NOAEL provide a safety margin of ~8 
((=69500/30)/(6360/21)). 
Antidrug antibodies were detected in 8/12 monkey in the recovery phase. As expected, variability in 
plasma concentrations tended to increase from Day 22 and onwards. On Day 29 at the mid dose of 15 
mg/kg, 5/8 animals showed lower plasma concentrations indicating antibody mediated increased 
clearance in selected animals. At the low dose only 2/8 and at the high dose only 1/8 showed lower 
plasma concentrations demonstrating that the animals were, in general, exposed as intended. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics was evaluated in the 6-month toxicology study in which tremelimumab was 
administered IV once weekly at 5 and 15 mg/kg/week, n=4 (DM2001-675206-006) for 26 weeks. The 
high dose group of 50 mg/kg/week was terminated on Day 78 due to excess toxicity (last dose on day 
43). Two male and two females continued in to a 100 days recovery phase (Study day 177). There 
were no recovery animals allocated for the low and the mid dose. Pre-dose samples were below LLOQ 
(0.156 µg/mL) on Day 1 and so were all samples collected from control animals. The observed slight 
gender differences in exposure were ascribed to variability due to neutralising antibodies and resulting 
waning exposure later in the study in some animals. Hence, the pharmacokinetic data were pooled 
across gender.  
As expected, slight accumulation was observed between day 1 and 29. A slight decrease was evident 
on Day 176 probably due to increased clearance in some animals. Only one animal (34F, 15 mg/kg 
dose) developed antidrug antibodies already on day 22 were the predose sample was below LLOQ. 
From day 43, 3 more animals (28F, 12M and 14M) showed up with exposure at or below LLOQ and 
from Day 141 one more (12F). When pre-dose samples showed exposure below LLOQ, these were 
subjected to ADA assays. Anti-tremelimumab antibodies were detected in animal 12M, 14M and 34F in 
predose samples from Day 44, 44 and 23, respectively correlating with waning exposure in predose 
samples. 
The systemic exposure to tremelimuab appeared to increase with increase in dose in a linear manner 
on Day 1. On day 29, the increase was slightly lower than the increase in dose. This was even more 
obvious on Day 176 due to the increase in neutralising antidrug antibodies and waning exposure in 
some animals. However, on Day 176, a 3-fold increase in dose still increased the exposure 2-fold. All 
monkeys at 5 and 15 mg/kg dose groups had measurable plasma concentrations of tremelimumab 
throughout the 6-month treatment period following each dose except one, which reached LLOQ on Day 
141. Hence, the animals were subjected to adequate dose-related exposure during the dosing phase 
and the validity of the study. 
Since exposure was relatively stable during the study, the AUCday1-30 can be acceptable as a rough 
estimate of for calculating exposure margins. No NOAEL could be established in this 6-months study as 
the monkeys also at the low dose experienced diarrhoea requiring supportive care and skin rash. The 
low dose provided exposure from Day 1 to 30 of 94700 µg/mL*h ((=94700/30)/(6360/21)) = 
23675/2120 ~ 10 times higher than clinical exposure. 
Exposure was also followed in the EFD study. Pregnant female monkeys (n=12 or 14) per group were 
dosed 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg/week IV from GD20 to GD49 (5 doses). Systemic exposure (Cmax and 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 35/162 
 
 
  
 
 
AUCGD20-49) appeared to increase with increase in dose in a linear manner. Slight increase in exposure 
was observed between GD20 and GD 49 as expected for a product with a half-life longer than the 
dosing interval. ADA samples were obtained in the study, but since only very few animals showed 
increased clearance during the study as evident from low plasma concentrations in pre-dose samples 
on day 48 (12884 in the low dose group, 12702 and 13004 in the mid dose group and animal 12836 in 
the high dose group), these samples were not subjected to ADA analysis.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Two single dose toxicity studies were presented for tremelimumab. The first one was with only a 10 
mg/kg dose in one female and one male monkey and 12 weeks treatment-free observation period 
(Study 00-1985-06, non-GLP). This dose was well tolerated with no clinical signs, only a slight increase 
in lymphocyte counts was considered related to the pharmacological effect of tremelimumab. Exposure 
(AUC0-tlast) was documented to be similar to the same dose level in next study (Study 99-1985-01) 
and the female monkey was found positive for ADA. 
The second study was GLP compliant and included 3 monkeys of each sex in each group (control, 10, 
30 and 100 mg/kg) and a 15 weeks treatment free observation period (Study 99-1985-01).  
This study included core end points such as mortality, clinical signs (daily), body weight, food 
consumption, physical examinations, haematology, clinical chemistry, inspection of administration site, 
gross pathology, microscopic pathology. Only the control and high dose group was subjected to 
necropsy on Day 106. The others were returned to colony. Moreover, this study included evaluation of 
some safety pharmacology parameters (ECG, heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure 5 min 
post dosing). 
AUC0-tlast was proportional to the increase in dose and all 9 animals were found positive for ADA. 
All animals survived until the end of the study. The most prominent clinical sign was diarrhoea/loose 
stool which was dose related in incidence and severity. However, this did not result in change in food 
intake or body weight. 
Haematology revealed a general drug-related increase in lymphocyte counts, which occurred in both 
males and females at ≥30 mg/kg. Moreover, a general drug-related increase in eosinophil counts was 
observed in females at all dose levels and males at 100 mg/kg. These effects are considered a result of 
the pharmacological effect of tremelimumab. The increase in circulating lymphocytes was not 
associated with corresponding microscopic changes in the organs examined. Other changes in 
haematology were consistent with stress leucogram profile as they were also observed in the control 
group or were characteristic for an inflammatory response against a foreign protein (human CTLA4 
antibody; tremelimumab). 
All microscopic findings were comparable between drug-treated and control animals and consistent 
with those commonly or sporadically found in non-human primates. 
Safety pharmacology evaluation was included in this study by assessing vital signs (heart rate, 
respiration rate and body temperature) and ECG/blood pressure twice pre-study and 5 minutes (Tmax) 
after dosing. Hence, only acute effects were monitored. No acute drug-related changes were observed. 
This is endorsed.

2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
1-month i.v toxicity study with 2 months post-dose observation in cynomolgus monkey 
(Study 00-1985-04, GLP) 
The 1 month repeat-dose toxicity study was performed in compliance with GLP as a multi-site study 
with Pfizer, Groton, CT, USA as the primary site. Only the immunophenotyping and serology was not 
performed to GLP.  
Animals (5/sex/group) were administered tremelimumab at 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg via once-weekly IV 
bolus injection on Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Control animals (5/sex) received vehicle according to the 
same dosing schedule. Scheduled necropsies were conducted on Day 30 (3/sex/group), and following a 
2-month treatment-free period (Day 105; 2/sex/group). I.e. there were recovery animals in all four 
groups. 
Weekly IV bolus administration of tremelimumab over a period of 1 month was associated with 
intermittent diarrhoea or loose stool in individual animals across all treated groups during the dosing 
phase. In the 2-month treatment-free period, this effect was only observed in the high dose group. 
Reversible increases in the absolute number and/or percent of peripheral blood lymphocytes that 
correlated with increases in circulating T cells and/or B cells at 15 and 50 mg/kg/week was observed. 
Histopathology revealed periportal mononuclear cell infiltrates in the liver at 15 and 50 mg/kg/week, 
which reversed in females but not in males after a 2-month treatment-free period. Additional 
histopathology findings included lymphoid hyperplasia in the spleen and mesenteric lymph node, which 
was observed at all dose levels. Based on the above findings, the 5 mg/kg/week dose was considered 
to be the NOAEL and the 50 mg/kg/week dose was considered to be the highest non-severely toxic 
dose (HNSTD) for tremelimumab in this study. This is endorsed. 
AUC0-21days in patients was 6360 µg/mL*h. The NOAEL of 5 mg/kg/week showed exposure: AUC0-7days of 
13200 µg/mL*h, providing a safety margin of 13200/(6360/3) ~ 6 at one month treatment duration.  
6-month i.v toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey (Study 2004-0150, GLP) 
The 6 month repeat-dose toxicity study was performed in compliance with GLP as a multi-site study 
with Pfizer, Kalamazoo, MI, USA as the primary site. Test formulation and analysis was performed at 
Pfizer, Chesterfield, MO. Plasma analysis at Pfizer, Richmond, VA, ADA analysis and TK, immune-
phenotyping were performed at Pfizer Groton, CT and finally the ECG analysis by an associate 
professor at Michigan University, East Lansing, MI, USA. The quality assurance statement includes 
dates of audits/inspections which cover from draft protocol across in-life phases to ECG, necropsy and 
study reporting. Individual quality assurance statement was provided for bioanalysis, toxicokinetics, 
immunophenotyping and ADA reports. No quality assurance statement was associated with the report 
of analysis of the dosing solutions. 
The plasma concentration of tremelimumab collected from the control group animals at 0.5-hour post-
dose on treatment Days 1, 29 and 176 and recovery Day 99 were less than the LLOQ (0.156 μg/mL). 
Cynomolgus monkeys were administered a solution of tremelimumab in vehicle intravenously at doses 
of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/week for 6 months (the same dose levels as in the 1-month study).  
Six monkeys/sex were assigned to the 0 (control) and 50 mg/kg/week groups (with 4 monkeys/sex 
designated as main study monkeys and 2 monkeys/sex designated as recovery-phase monkeys). Four 
monkeys/sex were assigned to the 5 and 15 mg/kg/week groups (no recovery-phase monkeys). 
Dosing had to be suspended in the high dose group already after 6 or 7 weeks due to persistent 
diarrhoea and what seems to be rather severe adverse skin conditions. Several of the animals failed to 
improve after suspension of dosing and had to be euthanized despite supportive treatment of fluids, 
EMA/42903/2023

snacks, benadryl and prednisolone. On Day 79, the remaining 50 mg/kg/week monkeys (2/sex) and 
the control monkeys originally designated as recovery monkeys (2/sex) were placed in a newly 
designated 99-day recovery phase. Mortality was observed in the low dose group, which were not 
associated with treatment (broken forearm and peracute diarrhoea due to acute infection). 
As expected from the pharmacodynamic effects of tremelimumab, changes were observed in 
hematological, immunophenotyping and clinical chemistry endpoints, such as increased numbers of 
white blood cells and lymphocytes and slightly decreased A/G ratio. 
A decrease in thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in combination with increased TSH was observed in one 
male and 1 female in each of the mid and high dose. These changes correlated with moderate to 
marked thyroid atrophy as observed microscopically at day 170 at the mid dose and at Day 42 at the 
high dose.  
Tremelimumab-related histologic findings were generally consistent with the intended pharmacology of 
increased  immune  reactivity.  All  treated  groups  had  a  dose-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of 
mononuclear cell infiltration and mononuclear cell inflammation in numerous organs apart from skin and 
intestinal system in which adverse effects were obvious by clinical signs.  
Dose-related mononuclear cell infiltration was present in the cecum, colon, skin, brain (choroid 
plexus), esophagus, eye (conjunctiva), heart, liver (periportal area), kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas 
(acinar), parathyroid, pituitary, prostate, salivary gland, thyroid, tongue and uterus of the 5, 15, and 
50 mg/kg/week groups.  
Histological evaluation of the recovery animals showed minimal inflammation of salivary gland (1/4 
animals) and skin (3/4 animals).  
(NOAEL) was not determined based on clinical observations that required supportive care 
(prednisolone, benadryl, IV or gavage fluids, snacks) in the 5 mg/kg/week and 50 mg/kg/week groups 
and mononuclear cell inflammation in the kidney, skin and salivary gland of all tremelimumab-treated 
groups. Exposure to tremelimumab, assessed by mean Cmax and AUC values, was largely maintained 
throughout the dosing phase despite antidrug antibodies in individual animals and there were no 
consistent gender differences in mean exposure. The maximum tolerated dose was considered to be 15 
mg/kg/week. At 15 mg/kg/week on Day 176 the combined-sex Cmax and AUC0-24h means were 444 
μg/mL and 7820 μg•h/mL, respectively. This is much higher than Cmax of 30 µg/ml and AUC0-21days of 
6360 µg/mL*h in patients. Exposure at 5 mg/kg/week was also 11 times higher than in patients 
indicating that the dose setting in this study was too high. Mean AUC1-30days was 94700 µg/mL*h in the 
monkey. AUC0-21days in patients were modelled to be 6360 µg/mL*h. Hence, exposure margin to the 
lowest dose was (94700/30)/(6360/21) ~ 10. Nevertheless, the majority of the findings appeared to 
be clinically relevant, even the palliative treatment of corticosteroids in the most affected animals.

In the 6 months toxicity study (Study 2004-0150; GLP), mammary gland, uterus, vagina, oviduct, 
cervix, ovary, epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicle and testes were included in the list of organs 
subjected to histopathology on Day 177, where the low and mid dose animals had been dosed weekly 
up until sacrifice and the high dose animals had been off dosing for 99 days.  
As for the male reproductive organs, mononuclear cell inflammation/infiltration was observed as 
minimal or mild in seminal vesicle (1/4 in High dose), testes (1/4 in Low dose and Mid dose with 1/4 
with mild inflammation in the high dose), epididymides (1/4 in control, 1/4 in Low dose, 1/4 in Mid 
dose and 2/4 in High dose). Prostate was more affected in incidence and severity compared to the 
other male reproductive organs, as one of the four high dose animals also showed moderate 
mononuclear cell inflammation. 
As for the female reproductive organs, mononuclear cell inflammation/infiltration was observed as 
minimal or mild in uterus (0/4 in control, 3/4 in low dose, 1/4 in mid dose and 3/4 in high dose). In 
vagina, this finding was dose related in incidence and severity was found to be moderate in 1/4 in mid 
dose and 2/4 in the high dose. In mammary gland, mononuclear infiltration was mild in 1/4 in low and 
mid dose and mononuclear inflammation was present in the 3/4 of the high dose animals with one 
classified as moderate. Other findings were only present in one animal and is considered incidental. 
The embryofetal development study of tremelimumab was a multisite study performed with Covance, 
Münster, Germany as the primary site with a comprehensive audit program covering most phases of 
the study (2501-001). Analysis of a stock solution took place at Covance using UV absorbance. 
Bioanalysis (GLP) was conducted at Nerviano Medical Sciences, Italy and toxicokinetics (GLP) at Pfizer, 
Groton, CT. ADA analysis was decided not to be performed, since the pharmacokinetics appeared to be 
minimally affected by possible neutralising antibodies towards tremelimumab. Moreover, exposure was 
dose-related and similar to the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
In this study, the animals were dosed once weekly with tremelimumab from day 20 to 50 of gestation 
(e.g. on days 20, 27, 34, 41, and 48 of gestation) at dose levels of 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg/week. 
Toxicokinetic samples were collected: days 20 and 48 of gestation: predose, and at approximately 0.5, 
8, and 24 hours post-dose and days 27, 34, and 41, of gestation: predose and at approximately 0.5 
hours post-dose, hence exposure was well-covered throughout the study. 
All animals were observed once daily for behaviour and appearance. A second examination was 
performed on all animals later in the day as a cage side observation, including another faeces 
evaluation. Additionally, a detailed fur examination was performed at weekly intervals for each 
individual animal. 
The only clinical signs assigned to treatment was slight dose-related increase in the incidence of days 
with diarrhoea. 
Foetuses were delivered via caesarean section and euthanized on day 100 ± 1 of gestation, followed 
by examination for weight, external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities, and weights of selected 
organs. Placentae were examined for weight and gross appearance. 
There was no effect of treatment on the incidence of prenatal loss. There were no treatment-related 
changes in fetal body or organ weights, fetal body measurements, or placental weights among the live 
fetuses. External and visceral examination revealed several minor findings in fetuses of all groups 
including the control group. Type, frequency and pattern of those findings did not show any dose-
relationship. 
Hence, there were no signs of tremelimumab having adverse effects on the outcome of pregnancy and 
embryofoetal development at doses up to 30 mg/kg/week during pregnancy (GD20 to GD48) in the 
monkey providing sufficient margin of exposure.

Interspecies comparison 
The repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with exposure of tremelimumab well in excess of 
patient exposure even at the lowest dose level. This is unfortunate as no NOAEL could be determined 
from the 6-month study. It should be noted that AUC in monkey is for 1 week and AUC for human is 
for 3 weeks in the table below.

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed in both single and repeat-dose toxicity studies. When changes were 
observed, these were considered procedurally related and similar in incidence and severity between 
control and tremelimumab dosed animals. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross reactivity 
Tissue cross reactivity studies of tissue binding of a fluorosceinated version of tremelimumab to 
cynomolgus monkey and human tissues was presented in reports IM645 and IM676. The studies were 
conducted according to GLP at Pathology Associates, a Charles River Company, Maryland, USA. The 
range of tissue was sufficiently broad and covered tissues of vital organs such organs of reproduction, 
heart and lung apart from expected target organs of gastrointestinal system, thymus, pancreas and 
lymph system. Human lymphocytes and human cerebellum tissue were used as positive and negative 
control, respectively. 
The tissue binding profile of the two species was remarkably similar. The tissues binding tremelimimab 
were tonsils, lymphocytes in stomach, colon, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus in monkey. In human 
tissues it was tonsils, lymph nodes, thymus, lymphocytes in spleen, colon and small intestine with low 
binding in 1 out of three donors of thyroid. Tissue binding correlates with expected pharmacological 
effect and adverse findings in the monkey and adverse effects in patients. 
Antigenicity 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 41/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Tremelimumab did give rise to antidrug antibodies in the monkeys, however with limited impact on 
exposure. Only few animals showed decreasing exposure over time due to neutralising antidrug 
antibodies. This seems to be the case in patients as well, where 10.7% tested positive for ADAs and 
8.9% for neutralising ADAs. The presence of ADAs did not impact tremelimumab pharmacokinetics, 
and there was no apparent effect on efficacy and safety. 
Immunotoxicity 
Tremelimumab is a product, which enhance the reactivity of the immune system by inhibiting one of 
the down-regulating functions (CTLA4). This gives rise to general inflammation (in essence 
autoimmune reactions) in a range of organs - most severely in the intestinal system and skin as 
observed from clinical signs. The increase in general inflammation seems to be well documented in the 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys also on the cellular level but may be less obvious in the patient 
population in which leucopenia and neutropenia are very common adverse effects. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tremelimumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a 
significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), tremelimumab is 
exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not 
pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
It is acknowledged that tremelimumab inhibits CTLA4 and thereby activate T cells. A range of both in 
vitro, in vivo pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicity studies documents this effect, which in vivo 
translates into severe systemic inflammation and mortality after repeat-dosing. However, the lack of 
effects on Tregs ability to dampen IFN-γ production by activated T cells is a concern. According to e.g. 
Ohue, 2019, Tregs may be part of cancer tumours microenvironment to enhance tumour immunity 
providing a possibility for evading the activated T cells. 
To further explain the fact that tremelimumab does not target the intratumoral Tregs limiting its 
efficacy in cancer treatment, a scientific discussion was provided. Depletion of Tregs is dependent on 
ADCC of which tremelimumab is not capable mainly due to lack of FcR affinity. Selby et al. 
demonstrated that in mouse tumor models surrogate antibodies with higher affinity for FcR showed 
both the ability of depleting Tregs and enhanced antitumor activity.  
There is a difference in affinity of IgG isotypes for FcR between mouse and human. IgG2a is a mouse 
isotype, with relatively potent Fc binding properties and is broadly equivalent to human IgG1. 
Additionally, human IgG2 (such as tremelimumab) has very minimal Fc binding properties and is 
broadly equivalent to mouse IgG1 (as used in the in vivo studies described below) (Stewart et al 
2014).  
This discrepancy between nonclinical and clinical findings could be summarized as translational 
challenges associated with: 1) differences between IgG isotypes across species; 2) type of effector 
cells infiltrated in tumour and expression of different FcγRs on the surface between mouse and human; 
3) varying CTLA-4 expression level on Tregs.  
To conclude, tremelimumab is not capable of performing ADCC and therefore does not reduce Tregs 
number. In the context of immune related adverse events, that property is desirable, but intratumoral 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 42/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Tregs might be potential target for more efficient therapy because reducing Tregs inside tumors is 
associated with superior antitumor activity. Tremelimumab achieves its effect by targeting CTLA-4 on 
activated effector T cells and should be administered in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody. Results 
from nonclinical studies showed that combination is superior to monotherapy with tremelimumab in 
cancer treatment, but similar to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy. Totality of data suggest that not affecting 
Tregs might be the reason for weaker efficacy of tremelimumab. 
Key in vitro and in vivo studies highlight applicant´s statement that tremelimumab is not capable of 
affecting Tregs, however, the absence might be associated with weaker clinical outcomes and 
questionable contribution of tremelimumab in antitumor efficacy. 
This deficiency might also explain the modest effect in the in vivo mouse cancer models. In addition, 
the clinical combination ratio, tremelimumab 75mg Q3W with durvalumab 1500 mg Q3W has not been 
justified from a non-clinical point of view, only a ratio 1:1 has been tested in in vivo and studies of 
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy have not been provided, although at this time of the 
clinical development it is considered acceptable to address these issues with clinical data and additional 
non-clinical studies are not warranted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
As expected for a monoclonal antibody, volume of distribution is mostly confined to the vascular space 
as the volume of distribution in monkey demonstrate (Vss = 54 mL/kg). The major elimination 
pathway of tremelimumab is expected to be through protein catabolism. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interactions of tremelimumab with other therapeutics are not anticipated. 
The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab showed a trend towards lower increments in systemic levels at 
lower dose ranges in all pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies. This may imply no signs of target 
mediated clearance, but rather target mediated protection at the low doses or this could be due to 
biological variation. 
Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were observed in several animals during the repeat-dose toxicology studies 
and in some cases appeared to increase clearance. However, the overall exposure was deemed 
sufficient securing the validity of the studies. 
Toxicology 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in monkeys of 1- or 6- months duration. In the 1-month 
study findings were consistent with tremelimumab pharmacology by inducing inflammation but not 
severe.  
In the chronic 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with tremelimumab was associated 
with dose-related incidence in persistent diarrhoea and skin rash, scabs and open sores, which were 
dose-limiting. These clinical signs were also associated with decreased appetite and body weight and 
swollen peripheral lymph nodes. Histopathological findings correlating with the observed clinical signs 
included reversible chronic inflammation in the cecum and colon, and mononuclear cell infiltration in 
the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. A dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity 
of mononuclear cell infiltration with or without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the 
salivary gland, pancreas (acinar), thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, heart, esophagus, tongue, periportal 
liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular muscles), and 
choroid plexus of the brain. No NOAEL was found in this study with animals treated with the lowest 
dose of 5  mg/kg/week requiring supportive care. This dose provided an exposure-based safety margin 
of 3 to clinical relevant exposure (taking species difference in potency into account). 
Mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat dose toxicity studies. Since 
animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab, the clinical relevance of these 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 43/162 
 
 
  
 
 
findings for fertility is unknown. In reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant 
Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or 
effects pregnancy losses, foetal weights, or external, visceral, skeletal abnormalities or weights of 
selected foetal organs. Human IgG2 is known to cross the placental barrier. 
Tremelimumab potential for influencing fertility and early embryonic development was not evaluated or 
discussed by the applicant. According to ICH S9, effects on reproductive organs from the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies can make the basis for this evaluation. 
Pre- and postnatal development studies were not performed, and this is acceptable and in line with ICH 
S9.  
No studies in juvenile animals were performed, and this is acceptable since the sought indication is 
only including adult patents.  
Tremelimumab was not evaluated for genotoxic potential, and this is acceptable for a monoclonal 
antibody. Carcinogenic potential of tremelimumab was not evaluated, and this is acceptable given the 
indication sought in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.  
RMP 
The findings observed in the pivotal repeat-dose general toxicity studies of inflammation in cecum, 
colon and skin were also observed in patients. Moreover, clinical chemistry findings in patients and 
monkeys related to liver toxicity correlated to histological changes. As for toxicity to reproduction, it is 
acknowledged that the EFD study in monkeys did not give rise to concerns. However, inflammatory 
markers were present in organs of reproduction of both male and female animals even after 99 days of 
recovery.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tremelimumab and durvalumab are human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that act as checkpoint 
inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action with respect to enhancing the 
antitumor immune response triggered by chemotherapy.  
In 2018 durvalumab (Imfinzi) was approved in the EU for treatment of adults with locally advanced, 
unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose tumours express PD-L1 on ≥ 1% of tumour 
cells and whose disease had not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. 
The applicant is currently seeking marketing approval for the use of tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic 
NSCLC with no sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The clinical 
pharmacology data that support this proposed indication is summarized below. 
No dedicated human PK studies have been conducted for tremelimumab. The PK of tremelimumab 
and/or durvalumab has been investigated in patients enrolled in:  
• 
Three Phase I/Ib studies: D4190C00006 (Study 06), D4190C00010 (Study 10), and 
D4190C00002 (Japan Study 02).  
•  One Phase I/II study: D4190C00022 (Study 22).  
• 
Three Phase II/IIb studies: D4193C00003 (CONDOR), D4880C00003 (DETERMINE), and 
D4884C00001. 
•  Six Phase III studies: D419MC00004 (POSEIDON), D419QC00001 (CASPIAN), D419AC00001 
(MYSTIC), D419AC00003 (NEPTUNE), D4191C00004 (ARCTIC), and D4193C00002 (EAGLE).  
The Phase III study POSEIDON is the pivotal study for this application, while the other studies are 
supportive studies.  
The PK of tremelimumab as monotherapy has been determined in 5 supportive studies (Study 22, 
ARCTIC, CONDOR, DETERMINE, and D4884C00001). In these studies, however, only sparse sampling 
was performed for the assessment of PK.  
Overall, the peak and trough concentrations of tremelimumab were in a similar range across studies at 
the same dosing regimens. 
All studies included male and female patients aged 18 years and older with advanced solid tumors. No 
PK data has been obtained from healthy volunteers.

Dose rationale 
In POSEIDON, a dose of 75 mg Q3W IV tremelimumab in combination with 1500 mg Q3W IV 
durvalumab and SoC for 4 cycles was administered, with one additional dose of tremelimumab 75 mg 
at Week 16, followed by 1500 mg Q4W IV durvalumab monotherapy to disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC with no sensitizing 
EGFR mutations or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.  
The chosen dose was based on the results from the dose finding study (Study 06), in which 
tremelimumab 1 mg/kg was selected, as patients in the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg 
tremelimumab group had a tolerable safety profile without dose-limiting toxicities and the dose showed 
evidence of clinical activity. There was evidence of augmented pharmacodynamic activity relative to 
durvalumab monotherapy with combination doses containing 1 mg/kg tremelimumab. 
A fixed dose of tremelimumab 75 mg Q4W (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W for an average body weight of 
75 kg) was predicted to result in similar AUC and only a modest difference in median peak and trough 
levels at steady state compared to tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W based on simulations in a Population 
PK model developed for tremelimumab using data from Study 10, Japan Study 02, Study 06, 
D4884C00001, DETERMINE, and POSEIDON.  
Simulations indicated that both body weight-based and fixed dosing regimens of tremelimumab yield 
similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less between-patient variability with the 
fixed dose regimen.  
In order to further evaluate the suitability of a fixed dosing regimen of tremelimumab versus body 
weight-based dosing, tremelimumab exposure was compared by body weight quartiles. The exposure 
difference was small (< 20%) for all metrics (AUC, Cmax, Cmin), with a large overlap between body 
weight brackets (Table 5).

Table 5. Tremelimumab exposure across body weight quartiles 
Simulations were conducted to compare the tremelimumab exposure between the 75 mg Q3W dosing 
regimen and 1 mg/kg Q3W dosing regimen in order to evaluate the suitability of a fixed dosing 
regimen of tremelimumab versus body weight-based dosing. Tremelimumab serum concentrations 
were simulated based on the individual Empirical Bayes estimates obtained from the final model for the 
POSEIDON patients. The concentration profiles were summarized over time (Figure 2). The 
concentration profiles showed a good overlap between the 2 dosing regimens.

Bioanalytical Methods 
Bioanalysis methods for quantitation of tremelimumab drug concentration, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 
and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were developed and validated. 
Population PK analyses for tremelimumab and durvalumab 
A population PK model was developed for tremelimumab based on a pooled dataset from 6 Studies: 
Study 02, Study 06, Study 10, DETERMINE, BASKET and POSEIDON, which comprised of 5455 serum 
concentrations from 1605 patients. The final Pop PK model of tremelimumab was a 2-compartment 
model with linear CL and an additional time-dependent CL component for patients on combination 
therapy only. The following covariates were identified as statistically significant and included in the 
final model: body weight and sex on both CL and V1; albumin, primary indication and combination 
therapy (chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) on CL. The effect of body weight was allometrically 
scaled with estimated exponents of 0.370 and 0.453 for CL and V1, respectively, indicating that the 
effect of body weight was less than proportional. The final model was evaluated by means of non-
parametric bootstrap analysis (n=1000), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs.  
The durvalumab PopPK model was updated by including 11683 serum PK samples from 2827 patients. 
The model was based on a pooled dataset from 5 Studies: Study 1108, POSEIDON, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC 
and CASPIAN. The final model of durvalumab PK was a 2-compartment model with time-dependent CL. 
Residuals were described by a combined additive and proportional error model. The final durvalumab 
PopPK model included the following statistically significant covariate effects on CL: body weight, 
albumin, combination therapy, sex, creatinine clearance, lactate dehydrogenase, and eastern 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 52/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
cooperative oncology group; and on V1: body weight and sex. The effect of body weight was 
allometrically scaled with estimated exponents of 0.337 and 0.494 for CL and V1. The final model was 
evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis (n=500), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. 
Parameter estimates of the final model for tremelimumab and selected diagnostic plots are shown in 
Table 6 and Figure 3 and Figure 4.

Tremelimumab & durvalumab exposure-response modelling analyses 
The final PopPK models of tremelimumab and durvalumab were used to derive individual predicted 
exposure metrics for the E-R analyses. The tremelimumab/durvalumab E-R relationship for OS, PFS 
and ORR were analysed using data from POSEIDON, which included 326 patients administered 
tremelimumab (T) + durvalumab (D) + SoC arm. Both OS and PFS were analysed by Kaplan-Meier 
plots stratified by model-predicted exposure metrics and CPH models with T + D + SoC. Cmin of 
tremelimumab following dose 5 and tumour type were statistically significant for OS.  
The parameter estimates from the final OS CPH model are presented in Table 8and parameter 
estimates from the final PFS CPH model are presented in Table 9. 
The following covariates for PFS were statistically significant: patients having high tumour mutational 
burden (>12 mutations per megabase), high percentage of PD-L1 T cells (<25%), non-squamous 
tumour lesions and low NLR (Q1). Models were evaluated by graphically superimposing model-
predictions over the observed data.

ORR was analysed with linear logistic regression models. None of the effects of exposure metrics on 
the probability of being a responder were statistically significant based on the likelihood-ratio-test (see 
Table 10).  
Table 10. Summary of the Effect of Different Exposures Metrics on the Probability of Being a Responder 
(PR or CR) 
Safety endpoints were graphically evaluated and results were confirmed by logistic regression models 
that did not identify any significant impact of tremelimumab/durvalumab exposure on the incidence of 
the investigated AEs.  
QTcF modelling analysis 
Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to characterize the 
relationship of change from baseline of QTcF (ΔQTcF) with durvalumab or tremelimumab serum 
concentrations. The concentration-ΔQTcF analysis population consisted of 293 observations from 67 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 58/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
patients administered durvalumab and 254 observations from 66 patients administered tremelimumab 
from Study 06. Unscheduled concentration-QTcF observations and non-central ECG records were 
excluded from the analysis.  
For durvalumab, the slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to durvalumab concentration was 0.0048 ms 
per μg/mL (p = 0.112), with a mean intercept of 0.082 ms (p = 0.950; 90% CI: -2.24, 2.24 ms; Table 
11). 
The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab were significantly different from 0. The 
slope for the relationship of ΔQTcF to tremelimumab concentration was -0.012 ms per μg/mL (p = 
0.531), and the mean intercept was 0.581 ms (p = 0.629; 90% CI: 1.41, 2.57 ms; Table 12). 
Table 11. Parameter estimates of durvalumab PK – ∆QTcF relationship 
Table 12. Parameter estimates of tremelimumab PF - ∆QTcF relationship 
The upper bound of the 90% 2-sided CI for ΔQTcF was less than 10 ms, and the highest observed 
concentration of durvalumab and tremelimumab had a predicted mean ΔQTcF of less than 5 ms (Figure 
7, Figure 8 and Table 13).

Distribution 
No distribution studies have been conducted in patients with NSCLC. However, Study 22 evaluated PK 
parameters in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, who received a single IV dose of 300 
mg on Day 1. In a subset of patients from this study (N=11): for whom intensive PK sampling was 
done, the estimated volume of distribution was 7.6 L (Table 15).  
Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received tremelimumab monotherapy 
or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the dose range of ≥ 1 mg/kg, the 
geometric mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was 6.33 L.

Elimination 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 62/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Tremelimumab, as a typical mAb, is not cleared renally due to its large molecular weight. The primary 
elimination pathways are protein catabolism via the reticuloendothelial system (RES) or target-
mediated disposition. 
Based on the findings from the subset of patients from Study 22, for whom intensive PK sampling was 
done, the clearance was 0.21 L/day and the apparent half-life (apparent terminal t½) was 25.1 days 
(Table 15). 
Based on population PK analysis, the geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) was 0.309 L/day 
and the geometric mean terminal half-life was approximately 14.2 days.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In Study 06 an approximately dose-proportional increase in PK exposure (Cmax and AUC0-28) of 
tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W when 
administered in combination with durvalumab (Table 14). Exposure following multiple doses 
demonstrated accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the first dose. The PK 
profile for tremelimumab is shown in Figure 9. 
Based on the final Population PK model using POSEIDON data, time-dependent CL was identified for 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, but not with tremelimumab monotherapy.

dose following IV administration of the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab (Study 06) 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
For tremelimumab, all fixed and random effects were estimated with good precision (< 25% RSE). The 
IIV was 33%, 20%, 46% and 87% for CL, V1, V2 and Tmax, respectively. 
For durvalumab, the IIV was limited, amounting to 28%, 24% and 25% on CL, V1 and Tmax, 
respectively. 
Special populations 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 63/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The effect of intrinsic factors (i.e., renal impairment, hepatic impairment, age, race, gender, and body 
weight) on the PK of tremelimumab has not been studied through specific dedicated studies.  
The effect of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, age, race, gender, and body weight on the PK of 
tremelimumab, however, has been evaluated in the Population PK analysis. In summary, the final 
Population PK modeling indicated that the baseline patient characteristics of age, race, renal function, 
and hepatic function had no effect on the PK of tremelimumab.  
In contrast, the Population PK analysis identified several covariates that were statistically significant on 
tremelimumab CL and V1: body weight, ALB, sex, combination therapy and primary indication on CL; 
and body weight and sex on V1, all identified covariates changed tremelimumab exposure by less than 
± 20% and were regarded as of minor clinical relevance. 
Impaired renal function 
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The 
effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown.  
Impaired hepatic function 
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST) 
had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of moderate hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3.0 x 
ULN and any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown. 
Gender 
Based on the final PopPK model of tremelimumab, gender was identified as a statistically significant 
covariate on PK of tremelimumab. Based on the final Population PK model using POSEIDON data, the 
geometric mean CLss and V1 values were 13.4% and 14.9% lower, respectively, in female patients 
compared to the respective population mean values.  
These differences in CLss and V1 (< 20%) were not considered clinically meaningful given the lack of 
exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships in POSEIDON.

Race was not identified as a significant covariate in the final PopPK model of tremelimumab and race 
did not seem to influence PK of tremelimumab. 
Weight 
Based on the final PopPK model of tremelimumab, body weight was identified as a statistically 
significant covariate on PK of tremelimumab. The impact of body weight on CLss or V1, evaluated based 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 64/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
on the difference in geometric mean parameter values at the 95th or 5th percentile of the weight 
distribution from that of the overall population, was within -11.8% to +14.7% for CLss and -14.2% to 
+18.3% for V1. 
Table 16 shows the simulated tremelimumab AUC, Cmax, and Cmin at steady state across body weight 
quartiles. At the highest weight quartile, the simulated geometric mean AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss 
decreased by 8.68%, 13.7%, and 7.53%, respectively, compared to the geometric mean of the overall 
population. At the lowest quartile, the simulated AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss increased by 9.12%, 
14.6%, and 10.5%, respectively, compared to the mean of the overall population.  
These differences in exposure were not considered clinically meaningful given the lack of exposure-
efficacy and exposure-safety relationships in POSEIDON.  
Table 16: Tremelimumab exposure across body weight quartiles.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tremelimumab or durvalumab.  
In POSEIDON, no clinically meaningful PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab or 
durvalumab and SoC were identified. In addition, PK of abraxane and gemcitabine were similar 
between SoC only, durvalumab + SoC, and durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC groups, suggesting 
that combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab does not have an impact on the PK of abraxane 
and gemcitabine. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 65/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Additionally, based on population PK analysis, concomitant durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy treatment did not seem to impact the PK of tremelimumab in terms of Cmax, CL or AUC.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No in vitro permeability, in vitro metabolism, or in vitro metabolic drug-drug interaction studies that 
used human biomaterials have been performed. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of 
tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 1337 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg 
or 1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). One-hundred forty-three 
patients (10.7%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 8.9% (119/1337) of patients.  
In the POSEIDON study, of the 278 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg in 
combination with durvalumab 1 500 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy and 
evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 38 (13.7%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 11.2% (31/278) of patients. Both ADA 
incidence and prevalence were numerically similar between the T + D + SoC and D + SoC arms, 
indicating that the presence of tremelimumab did not have an apparent effect on the immunogenicity 
of durvalumab. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tremelimumab is a human IgG2 mAb directed against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 
(CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a critical regulatory signal for T-cell expansion and activation following an immune 
response, and it serves as a natural braking mechanism that maintains T-cell homeostasis. During T-
cell activation, T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds to CD80 and CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting 
cells, sending an inhibitory signal and preventing CD28-mediated T-cell co-stimulation, thus limiting T-
cell activation. Tremelimumab blocks these events, leading to prolongation and enhancement of T-cell 
activation and expansion. 
Durvalumab is a human IgG1k mAb that binds to programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and blocks 
the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Expression of PD-L1 can be induced by 
inflammatory signals and can be expressed on both tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells 
in the tumuor microenvironment. PD-L1 blocks T-cell function and activation through interactions with 
PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). By binding to its receptors PD-L1 reduces cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation, 
and cytokine production. Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition 
of immune responses, without inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Tremelimumab and durvalumab are checkpoint inhibitors with distinct yet complementary mechanisms 
of action with respect to enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by chemotherapy. 
Tremelimumab mediated blockade of CTLA-4 functions early in the immune response, lowering the 
threshold for T cell activation, allowing more T cells to be activated and increasing the diversity of the 
T cell population. This increases the probability that a T cell recognizing a tumour neoantigen can 
become activated. Durvalumab blockade of PD-L1 is expected to function mainly during the effector 
phase of T cell function, once T cells enter the tumour, where it acts to block local suppression of T-cell 
function by PD-L1, enhancing the ability of activated anti-tumor T cells to target and kill tumour cells. 
Primary pharmacology  
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 66/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Data from Study 06, Study 10 and Study 22 indicate that a pharmacodynamic effect exists on 
proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cell quantities consistent with the proposed mechanisms of action of 
both therapeutic agents.  
Data from Study 1108, Japan Study 02, Study 06 and Study 10 indicate that durvalumab treatment 
(with or without tremelimumab) reduces free Soluble Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (sPD-L1) in 
serum. 
No PD biomarkers are proposed for monitoring of effect. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Concentration-QTc Analysis 
Overall, concentration-QTc-analysis did not identify a significant linear relationship between 
tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. The predicted mean ΔQTcF and upper 
90% CI at the maximum observed concentration for tremelimumab or durvalumab in the dataset were 
below the threshold of clinical concern. 
Exposure-response relationships 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using overall survival (OS), 
progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) as efficacy parameters in patients 
from POSEIDON, for whom the different exposure metrics could be calculated. The total number of 
patients included in the analysis of the exposure-efficacy relationship was 326 receiving T + D + SoC, 
322 receiving D + SoC, and 333 receiving SoC.  
Both OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier estimates and analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards 
models based on data from patients in the T + D + SoC arm.

Figure 11. OS Kaplan-Meier plots for tremelimumab exposure metrics by quartiles at dose 5 
For AUCDose 5 Treme, Cmin, Dose 5 Treme, and Cmin, Dose 1 Treme, there was a trend that patients with exposure in 
the 1st quartile had shorter OS compared to those in the 2nd quartile (Figure 10 and Figure 11). 
Similarly, patients in the 2nd quartile had also a shorter OS than those in the 3rd quartile. However, no 
difference was observed between 3rd and 4th quartile. Further, for all quartiles but the 1st, the 
Kaplan-Meier curves of OS were above that of the SoC arm. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 68/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In order to assess whether confounding factors could explain the fact that the 1st quartile had a worse 
OS than SoC, a case match analysis was performed (see below). 
Progression-free survival (PFS)

Figure 13. PFS Kaplan-Meier plots for tremelimumab exposure metrics by quartiles at dose 5 
For AUCDose 5 Treme, Cmin, Dose 5 Treme, and Cmin, Dose 1 Treme, and similarly to what was observed for OS, for 
all quartiles but the 1st, the Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS were above that of the SoC arm (Figure 12 
and Figure 13).  
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 69/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Exposure-response analyses demonstrated that the Cmin after tremelimumab dose at Cycle 5 was the 
most significant exposure metric that influenced OS and PFS in patients enrolled in the POSEIDON 
study. In addition to tremelimumab exposure, the following covariates also influence OS and PFS: 
tumour type (both OS and PFS), NLR (PFS), PD-L1 T cells (PFS), and tumor mutational burden (PFS).  
Case Match Analysis 
The exploratory analysis of OS and PFS by exposure metrics of tremelimumab revealed that the 
patients in Q1 of Cmin, Dose 5 Treme were associated with a lower survival than those in the SoC arm; 
however, several confounding covariates could have influenced this observation. 
To supplement the CPH models for OS and PFS, patients from the SoC arm were matched with those in 
Q1 of Cmin, Dose 5 Treme of the T + D + SoC arm. Matching was performed based on the distributions of 
the following 10 disease-related covariates: baseline tumor size, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) score at baseline, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum albumin (ALB), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), tumor burden (> or < 12 mutations per 
megabase), tumor type (non-squamous vs squamous), 25% of PD-L1 TC, and the chemotherapy used 
in SoC (abraxane based vs gemcitabine based vs pemetrexed based). All the 82 treated patients in the 
Q1 subgroup were successfully matched to 82 patients in the SoC arm. All covariates in the selected 
82 SoC patients were balanced after matching. 
The HR for the comparison of patients in the Q1 subgroup with matched patients from the SoC arm 
was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.76-1.44) for OS and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.72-1.36) for PFS (Table 7). These results 
contrast with the HR calculated for the unmatched population. For OS, the HR was 1.42 (95% CI: 
1.10-1.84) and was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.95-1.58) for PFS. The 95% CI of PFS HR for both unmatched and 
matched patients includes 1, suggesting that the apparent difference between groups in the Kaplan-
Meier plot is not statistically significant. In conclusion, the case match analysis suggested that the 
observed relationship with tremelimumab exposure is possibly confounded by disease-related 
covariates. 
Table 17. HR for OS and PFS in patients of Cmin, Dose 5 Treme Q1 subgroup and SoC group 
No relationship between durvalumab exposure and OS or PFS was identified in the POSEIDON T + D + 
SoC arm.  
Objective Response Rate (ORR) 
The ORR was dichotomized as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), vs. stable disease or 
progression of disease (PD) and analyzed using a logistic regression model relating the probability of 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 70/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
being a responder to durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure metrics. This analysis focused on the 
combination treatment arm of T + D + SoC in which 330 patients received treatment. The ORR in 8 of 
the patients was not evaluable and excluded from this analysis. Of the remaining 322 patients, 3 
patients did not have durvalumab exposure metrics and 4 patients did not have tremelimumab 
exposure metrics. Therefore, logistic regression models for assessing effect of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab were based on 319 and 318 patients, respectively. 
In general, there appeared to be no clear trend between durvalumab exposure and the probability of 
being a responder. For tremelimumab, the plots appear to suggest an increase in the probability of 
being a responder with increasing exposure (Figure 14). However, the relatively large p-values show 
that none of the exposure metrics has a statistically significant impact (at the prespecified significance 
level of α = 0.001) on the probability of being a responder. It should be noted that for tremelimumab, 
the distribution of AUC after Dose 5, trough concentration after first dose, and after Dose 5 is 
somewhat narrow and there are a few potentially outlying patients. 
In general, there was no clear trend between the covariates and the probability of being a responder.

dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab 
Exposure-safety relationship 
The safety endpoints of interest were Grade 3 and above treatment-related adverse events (AEs), 
Grade 3 and above adverse events of special interest (AESIs), AEs leading to durvalumab treatment 
discontinuation and AEs leading to tremelimumab treatment discontinuation, focusing on the 
durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC arm only.  
Of the 330 patients in this arm, 3 did not have durvalumab exposure metrics while 4 did not have 
tremelimumab exposure metrics hence 327 and 326 patients were analyzed in the logistic regression 
models for durvalumab and tremelimumab respectively. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 71/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The relationship between the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs and AUC 
after the first dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab is shown in Figure 15. The relationship between 
the probability of having Grade 3 and above treatment-related AESIs and AUC after the first dose of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab is shown in Figure 16.  
In general, there appears to be no clear trend between increasing exposure and the probability of AEs. 
The p-values associated with exposure effects were relatively large (in comparison to the prespecified 
significance level of α = 0.001) indicating that the relationship was not statistically significant.  
Although not statistically significant, it was notable that the coefficients for the effect of durvalumab on 
probability of Grade 3 and above treatment-related AEs were negative, suggesting a counterintuitive 
decrease in the probability of AEs with increasing exposure. However, these effects were small and not 
statistically significant. In general, the apparent overlap in the distribution of exposure between the 
patients that had and those that did not have AEs suggested no clear relationship between exposure 
and the probability of having AEs.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of tremelimumab alone or in combination with durvalumab have been investigated in patients 
enrolled in 3 Phase I/Ib studies, 1 Phase I/II study, 3 Phase II/IIb studies and 6 Phase III studies.  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed as monotherapy and in combination with 
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 750 
mg (or 10 mg/kg) administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy. PK exposure 
increased dose proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady-state was achieved at 
approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received 
tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the 
dose range of  ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the geometric mean steady-state volume of 
distribution (Vss) was 6. 33 L. Tremelimumab clearance (CL) decreased over time in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy resulting in a geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) of 0.309 
L/day; the decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean terminal half 
life was approximately 14.2 days. The primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein 
catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 73/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In the POSEIDON study, overall PK profiles of durvalumab were similar between T + D + SoC and D + 
SoC arms, suggesting tremelimumab or SoC do not have an impact on PK of durvalumab when 
administered as combination therapy.  
Overall, PK results of gemcitabine and Abraxane were similar between T + D + SoC, D + SoC, and SoC 
alone arms, suggesting durvalumab or tremelimumab do not have an impact on PK of SoC 
chemotherapy (gemcitabine or Abraxane) when administered as combination therapy. 
In spite of these differences in study design, the assessed PK data (Cmax and Ctrough) for tremelimumab 
appear to be broadly comparable across studies.  
A population PK model was developed for tremelimumab based on a pooled dataset from 6 Studies: 
Study 02, Study 06, Study 10, DETERMINE, BASKET and POSEIDON, which comprised of 5455 serum 
concentrations from 1605 patients. The final Pop PK model of tremelimumab was a 2-compartment 
model with linear CL and an additional time-dependent CL component for patients on combination 
therapy only. The following covariates were identified as statistically significant and included in the 
final model: body weight and sex on both CL and V1; albumin, primary indication and combination 
therapy (chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) on CL. The effect of body weight was allometrically 
scaled with estimated exponents of 0.370 and 0.453 for CL and V1, respectively, indicating that the 
effect of body weight was less than proportional. Residual unexplained variability is low (28%) and 
low-to-moderate inter-individual random effects were identified on CL (39%), V1 (21%) and V2 
(49%). In addition, an omega was included on Tmax to account for a random variation on the time-
dependency effect on CL. No trends were observed on the ETA distribution of Tmax across the different 
covariates evaluated, suggesting that the large IIV on Tmax is caused by a large and random 
distribution of inter-individual differences that are not linked to any covariate tested. The final model 
was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis (n=1000), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. 
The evaluation of the GOF confirmed the adequacy of the structural population PK model proposed, but 
some bias have been observed in the DV vs IPRED plot, where large deviation (>10-fold) were 
observed between IPRED and DV. Slight model over-prediction was observed in these 22 observations 
out of 5238 observations. Most of the observations (12/22) were around the Cmax, suggesting that 
the model slightly over-predicts Cmax concentrations in those individuals. Based on the small 
proportion of observations that were over-predicted (0.42%), the model misspecification is considered 
of minor relevance. A large number of bootstrap runs failed to converge (474/1000) due to rounding 
errors which may indicate an unstable model. However, it seems termination status was not an 
important indicator of the quality of bootstrap parameter estimates and all median estimates and 95% 
CI of each parameter were close to the final model parameter estimates.  The overall model 
performance was observed based on the pcVPC, suggesting no significant trends across the different 
percentiles. No relevant trends were observed across the different pcVPC stratified by the significant 
covariates, suggesting the overall adequacy of the model to capture the different sub-groups of 
populations.  
Age (22 – 97 years), body weight (34 - 149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, 
albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no clinically 
significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. 
The effect of mild hepatic impairment and mild or moderate renal impairment was evaluated in pop PK 
analyses showing no impact on the exposure of tremelimumab. Accordingly, no dose adjustment is 
required in these special populations. There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal 
impairment for dosing recommendations However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily 
cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to influence tremelimumab 
exposure. Data from patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited. However, as 
IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function

is not expected to influence tremelimumab exposure and as a consequence, no dose adjustment of 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. No dose 
adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.2). Data on patients aged 
75 years of age or older are limited. 
The presence of tremelimumab ADA did not impact tremelimumab PK, as it was not identified as a 
significant covariate in the tremelimumab PopPK analysis. There was no clear evidence that the 
presence of tremelimumab ADA had any potential impact on the safety in POSEIDON study. 
The durvalumab PopPK model was updated by including 11683 serum PK samples from 2827 patients. 
The model was based on a pooled dataset from 5 Studies: Study 1108, POSEIDON, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC 
and CASPIAN. The final model was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis (n=500), 
RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. Changes on AUCss due to sex, durva+chemo and low ALB and on Cmax 
due to low body weight and sex are very close to the clinical relevance of 20%. Prediction-corrected 
VPCs stratified by clinical treatment, body weight, sex and albumin suggested that the durvalumab 
PopPK model adequately captures different subgroups of populations and no dose adjustments may be 
needed based on the clinical relevance analysis.   
Both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were explored by Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
estimates and analysed by Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models based on data from patients 
receiving the durvalumab + tremelimumab + SOC. Models were evaluated by graphically 
superimposing model-predictions over the observed data. The proportional hazard assumption was 
supported by a non-significant relationship between residuals and time except for the covariate 
logNLR. Linear mixed-effects exposure-response modelling with an intercept was conducted to 
characterize the relationship of change from baseline of QTcF (ΔQTcF) with durvalumab or 
tremelimumab serum concentrations. The slope or the intercept for tremelimumab and durvalumab 
were significantly different from 0. However, for both tremelimumab and durvalumab, the upper bound 
of the 90% CI for ΔQTcF was less than 10 ms, and the highest observed concentration had a predicted 
mean ΔQTcF of less than 5 ms. These values were lower than the prolongation levels of concern as 
established in the ICH E14 industry guidance for clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and 
proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs. The normality assumption was largely met and 
no hysteresis was apparent in the ΔQTcF vs. tremelimumab concentration plots. 
A weight-based dosing regimen of 1 mg/kg 3W of tremelimumab was proposed for patients weighting 
30 kg or less, to align the dosing recommendation with that of durvalumab for which a 30 kg cut-off 
was set based on a FDA-requested change to the endotoxin acceptance criteria during review of the 
initial durvalumab Investigational New Drug submission (June 2015). The predicted tremelimumab 
dose 5 (AUCdose5, Cmin,dose5) exposures for 30 kg or 20 kg body weights were generally lower 
compared to those observed in POSEIDON across the body weight quartiles. The lack of safety concern 
with this proposal was acknowledged. In addition, the MAH argued that since no clinically meaningful 
relationship between exposure and efficacy (OS and PFS) was observed for tremelimumab, and the 
efficacy results were similar across BW quartiles, the efficacy for patients with body weights less than 
or equal to 30 kg is expected to be similar to those weighing over 30 kg and receiving equivalent fixed 
doses in POSEIDON. The fixed dosing regimen of 75 mg Q3W was evaluated through a model-based 
analysis in patients between 30-34 kg (not enrolled in POSEIDON), and a >30% higher AUCss was 
predicted compared to patients between 34-58 kg. This increase in exposure gave raise to concerns 
regarding safety because (1) the predicted AUCss range with the fixed dosing regimen was higher 
(250-600 micrograms·h/mL) compared to the evaluated AUCss range in the exposure-safety analysis 
(<300 micrograms·h/mL), and (2) the slight positive exposure-safety relationship observed. A body 
weight regimen would provide more similar exposure to that observed in patients with higher body 
weight (>34 kg). Even in case of (slightly) lower exposure, lack of efficacy is not considered a concern, 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 75/162 
 
 
  
 
 
as discussed above. Considering all this, the cut-off below which tremelimumab is to be administered 
according to body weight was finally fixed at 34kg and reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except 
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not 
recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after 
starting tremelimumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions. 
No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via 
reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are 
expected. PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically 
meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, 
pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment. 
Assessment of an exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using OS, PFS, and ORR as efficacy 
parameters in patients from POSEIDON.  
OS and PFS were explored by Kaplan-Meier estimates and analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards 
models based on data from patients in the T + D + SoC arm.  
ORR was dichotomized as partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), vs. stable disease or 
progression of disease (PD) and analyzed using a logistic regression model relating the probability of 
being a responder to durvalumab and tremelimumab exposure metrics. 
For some of the tremelimumab PK parameters (AUCDose 5, Cmin, Dose 5, and Cmin, Dose 1), there was a trend 
that patients with exposure in the 1st quartile had shorter OS compared to those in the 2nd quartile. 
Similarly, patients in the 2nd quartile had also a shorter OS than those in the 3rd quartile. However, no 
difference was observed between 3rd and 4th quartile. Further, for all quartiles but the 1st, the 
Kaplan-Meier curves of OS were above that of the SoC arm. 
Similar to what was observed for OS, the Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS were for all quartiles, but the 1st, 
above that of the SoC arm for the same tremelimumab PK parameters (AUCDose 5, Cmin, Dose 5, and Cmin, 
Dose 1). 
In order to assess whether confounding factors could explain the fact that the 1st quartile had a worse 
OS and PFS than SoC, a case match analysis was performed, and this analysis suggested that the 
observed relationship with tremelimumab exposure was possibly confounded by disease-related 
covariates. 
In terms of ORR, the plots appeared to suggest an increase in the probability of being a responder with 
increasing exposure to tremelimumab.  
There appeared to be no clear trend between durvalumab exposure and the probability of being a 
responder. 
Since the exposure-efficacy relationships was only evaluated through Kaplan-Meier plots with OS and 
PFS between tremelimumab vs SoC arms, the evaluation  was in the first place considered insufficient. 
Additional statistical analyses (K-M and cox-regression analyses)  conducted between T+D+chemo vs 
D+chemo arms were requested   
As a result, the exposure-response CPH model for OS was updated based on durvalumab and 
tremelimumab treated patients from T + D + SoC versus D + SoC arms. OS KM plots for 
tremelimumab exposure metrics by quartiles at dose 1 and at dose 5, respectively, were provided.  
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 76/162 
 
 
  
 
 
The KM curve of D + SoC arm was above that of the SoC arm, and in the middle of those of different 
tremelimumab exposure quartiles. The impact of a number of identified covariates was assessed via 
the computation of the Hazard Ratio. 
According to the applicant, the exposure-response CPH model for PFS was also updated based on 
durvalumab and tremelimumab treated patients from T + D + SoC versus D + SoC arms. The impact 
of a number of identified covariates was assessed via the computation of the Hazard Ratio. 
For assessment of an exposure-safety relationship, the evaluated safety endpoints were Grade 3 and 
above treatment-related AEs from POSEIDON, Grade 3 and above AESIs, AEs leading to durvalumab 
treatment discontinuation and AEs leading to tremelimumab treatment discontinuation, focusing on the 
durvalumab + tremelimumab + SoC arm only. None of the tremelimumab or durvalumab exposure 
metrics were identified to have an influence on safety events in a logistic regression analysis.  
In addition, a body weight-AE analysis found no clear sign of a higher frequency of AEs in subjects with 
low body weight.   
The findings related to immunogenicity indicate a low immunogenicity risk of tremelimumab.  
With respect to the concentration-QTc-analysis, modeling results did not identify a significant linear 
relationship between tremelimumab or durvalumab serum concentrations and ΔQTcF. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Considering the nature of the product, the pharmacology package is considered adequate and the 
dosing of tremelimumab is considered appropriate with the proposed modification to use weight-based 
dosing for patients below 34kg, as discussed above.

Figure 17. Study design - POSEIDON 
Dual primary endpoints were BICR-assessed PFS according to RECIST 1.1 and OS compared between 
arms 2 and 3 (D+SoC vs. SoC) from the ITT population. As key secondary endpoints, BICR-PFS and 
OS comparisons were done between arms 1 and 3 (T+D+SoC vs. SoC), also in the ITT. 
Tumour scans and response assessment according to RECIST 1.1 were performed at screening (as 
baseline) with follow-ups at week 6 ±1 week from the date of randomization, at week 12 ±1 week 
from the date of randomization, and then every 8 weeks ±1 week until radiological disease 
progression. 
The applicant states that althoughtthe study was open-label, the study team was blinded to aggregate 
treatment information, and during the programming and preparation of statistical outputs, data were 
dummy blinded prior to database lock and study unblinding. 
Crossover was not permitted as part of the study.

The full dosing scheme of POSEIDON is presented in Table 18. 
Table 18. Dosing scheme - POSEIDON 
T=tremelimumab; D=durvalumab; SoC=standard of care chemotherapy; PD=progressive disease. 
The chosen platinum doublet was prespecified at randomisation before first study treatment and 
subsequent changes of regimen were not allowed, although switch between cisplatin and carboplatin 
were permitted. The following histology-based chemotherapy regimens were applicable to all 3 
treatment arms: 
•  Nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin (squamous and non-squamous histologies): Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle + carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC 
chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Gemcitabine + cisplatin (squamous histology only): Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 via IV 
infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle + cisplatin 75 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle, for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC 
chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Gemcitabine + carboplatin (squamous histology only): Gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m2 via IV 
infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle + carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC 
chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy arm). 
•  Pemetrexed + carboplatin (non-squamous histology only): Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin 
AUC 5 or 6 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + 
D + SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC 
chemotherapy arm); then continued pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 maintenance (i.e., Q4W for the T + D 
+ SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms.  
•  Pemetrexed + cisplatin (non-squamous histology only): Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 
mg/m2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for 4 to 6 cycles (i.e., 4 cycles for the T + D 
+ SoC chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms and 4 to 6 cycles for the SoC chemotherapy 
arm); then continued pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 maintenance (i.e., Q4W for the T + D + SoC 
chemotherapy and D + SoC chemotherapy arms.

*Note: For patients with non-squamous histology who received pemetrexed during induction, 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy could have been given either Q3W or Q4W dependent on 
investigator decision and local standards. 
Arm 1: During chemotherapy, tremelimumab 75 mg IV Q3W + durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q3W + 
chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles.  A fifth dose of tremelimumab 75 mg was to be given at Week 16 
alongside durvalumab Dose 6.  Post chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W. 
Arm 2: During chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q3W and chemotherapy Q3W for 4 cycles.  
Post chemotherapy, durvalumab 1500 mg IV Q4W. 
Arm 3: Chemotherapy Q3W alone for 4 cycles (any of the abovementioned 5 regimens).  Patients 
could receive additional 2 cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomization), as clinically indicated, at 
Investigator’s discretion. 
The study design did not allow cross over among treatment arms.  
Duration of treatment: Patients were treated until clinical progression or radiological progression unless 
there was unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion was met. 
Reductions and delays: Dose reductions of durvalumab and tremelimumab were not permitted. SoC-
related toxicity management and dose adjustment, including dose reductions and delays, should be 
performed as indicated in the local prescribing information for the relevant agent. In the event that an 
AE could reasonably be attributed to SoC, dose adjustment of SoC was attempted before modifying the 
administration of durvalumab ± tremelimumab. In the event that SoC was delayed, durvalumab ± 
tremelimumab was also delayed. 
Switch of platinum agent: In the event of unfavourable tolerability, patients could switch between 
cisplatin and carboplatin therapy at any point on study (assuming eligibility for the switched therapy is 
met).   
Treatment beyond progression: Patients in arms 1 and 2 with objective radiological progression who, in 
the investigator’s opinion, continued to receive benefit from their assigned treatment and who met the 
criteria for treatment in the setting of (PD) could continue to receive durvalumab monotherapy for as 
long as they were gaining clinical benefit.  
Retreatment: Patients in Treatment Arm 1 (T + D + SoC chemotherapy) with radiological progression 
who, in the investigator’s opinion, continued to receive benefit from their assigned treatment and who 
met the criteria for retreatment in the setting of PD, could have retreatment with durvalumab + 
tremelimumab combination therapy (only once). 
*Note: For patients randomized to Treatment Arm 3, treatment beyond progression and retreatment 
was not permitted.

•  Sample size 
The study will enrol approximately 2000 patients to randomize approximately 1000 patients in a 1:1:1 
ratio to durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy, durvalumab 
monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy, or SoC chemotherapy alone (approximately 333 patients in each 
treatment arm), including at least 250 patients in each treatment arm with PD-L1 TC <50%. 
The study is sized for dual primary endpoints to characterize the PFS and OS benefits of durvalumab 
monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone in the intent-to- treat (ITT) 
population. 
Dual Primary Endpoints: 
Durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone (PFS in ITT 
population): Assuming the true PFS HR is 0.67 and the median PFS in SoC chemotherapy alone arm 
is 6 months, 497 PFS events from the global cohort (75% maturity) will provide greater than 90% 
power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided alpha level of 0.9% (with overall alpha for 
PFS 1%), allowing for 1 interim analysis conducted at approximately 80% of the target events. The 
smallest treatment difference that is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.79. Assuming a 
recruitment period of 16 months, this analysis is anticipated to be 25 months from FPI. 
Durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC chemotherapy alone (OS in ITT 
population): Assuming the true OS HR is 0.7 and the median OS in SoC arm is 12.9 months, 532 OS 
events (80% maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at 
the 2-sided alpha level of a 3.3% (with overall alpha for OS 4%), allowing for 3 interim analyses 
conducted at approximately 45%, 61% and 84% of the target events. The smallest treatment 
difference that is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.83. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 
months, this analysis is anticipated to be 46 months from FPI. 
Key secondary Endpoints: 
Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone (PFS in ITT population): Assuming the true PFS HR is 0.51 and the median 
PFS in SoC chemotherapy alone arm is 6 months, 465 PFS events from the global cohort (70% 
maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided 
alpha level of 0.9% (with overall alpha for PFS 1%), allowing for 1 interim analysis conducted at 
approximately 80% of the target events (information fraction). The smallest treatment difference that 
is statistically significant will be an HR of 0.78. Assuming a recruitment period of 16 months, this 
analysis is anticipated to be 25 months from FPI.

Durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone (OS in ITT population): Assuming the true OS HR is 0.7 and the median OS 
in SoC arm is 12.9 months, 532 OS events (80% maturity) will provide greater than 90% power to 
demonstrate statistical significance at the 2-sided alpha level of a 3.3% (with overall alpha for OS 
4%), allowing for 3 interim analyses conducted at approximately 45%, 61% and 84% of the target

•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The randomization scheme was produced by a computer software program that incorporates a 
standard procedure for generating randomization numbers. One randomization list was produced for 
each of the randomization stratum. A blocked randomization was generated, and all centers used the 
same list to minimize any imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment arm. 
Patients were identified to the IVRS/IWRS per country regulations. Randomization codes were assigned 
strictly sequentially, within each stratum, as patients become eligible for randomization. Patients who 
fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio 
according to the following stratification scheme: 
•  PD-L1 tumour expression status (PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumour cells [PD-L1 TC 
≥50%] versus PD-L1 TC <50%) 
•  Disease stage (Stage IVA versus Stage IVB) 
•  Histology (non-squamous versus squamous) 
•  Blinding (masking) 
The study is open label. A BICR of images will be performed. Results of these independent reviews will 
not be communicated to Investigators, and the management of patients will be based solely upon the 
results of the RECIST 1.1 assessment conducted by the Investigator. The BICR of all radiological scans 
will be performed to derive the ORR, PFS, DoR, BoR, and APF12 endpoints according to RECIST 1.1. 
The BICR will include assessment by RECIST 1.1. The imaging scans will be reviewed by 2 independent 
radiologists and will be adjudicated, if required, by a third independent radiologist who will choose the 
assessments of 1 of the 2 primary reviewers. 
This study will use an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) to assess ongoing 
safety analyses as well as the interim efficacy analysis. 
•  Statistical methods 
Full analysis set 
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients. Treatment arms were to be compared 
on the basis of randomized study treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients 
who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment were included in the 
analysis in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints 
Progression-free survival 
The dual primary PFS analysis was to be based on the BICR tumour assessments according to RECIST 
1.1. The full analysis set will be used. The analysis used a stratified log-rank test adjusting for PD-L1 
tumour expression (PD-L1 ≥50% versus PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous versus non-squamous), 
and disease stage (Stage IVA and Stage IVB) for generation of the p-value. The covariates in the 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 85/162 
 
 
  
 
 
statistical modelling were to be based on the values entered into interactive voice response system 
(IVRS) at randomization, even if it is subsequently discovered that these values were incorrect. 
The hazard ratio (HR) and its CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model 
(with ties = Efron and PD-L1 tumour expression (PD-L1≥ 50% versus PD-L1 <50%), histology 
(squamous versus non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA and Stage IVB) included in the 
STRATA statement) and the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. 
Key secondary PFS analysis was to be performed using the same methodology as for the dual primary 
PFS analysis described above. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS were to be presented by treatment arm and PD-L1 tumour status and TMB 
subgroup, where appropriate. Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a 
PFS event and the type of event (RECIST 1.1 or death) were to be provided along with median PFS for 
each treatment. The assumption of proportionality was to be assessed. 
Censoring rules for PFS: Subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis were to 
be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 
assessment. However, if the subject progresses or dies after two or more missed visits, the subject will 
be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment prior to the two missed visits 
(Note: NE visit is not considered as missed visit). If the subject has no evaluable visits or does not 
have baseline data they will be censored at Day 1 unless they die within two visits of baseline (12 
weeks plus 1 week allowing for a late assessment within the visit window), in which case the date of 
death is used when deriving PFS. 
Sensitivity analyses: The following sensitivity analyses will be performed for the treatment 
comparisons of the dual primary and key secondary endpoints based on the FAS: 
•  A sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess possible evaluation-time bias that may be 
introduced if scans are not performed at the protocol-scheduled time points. The midpoint between 
the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment (using the final date of the 
assessment) will be analysed using a stratified log-rank test.  
•  Attrition bias will be assessed by repeating the dual primary/key secondary PFS analysis except that 
the actual PFS event times, rather than the censored times, of subjects who progressed or died in 
the absence of progression immediately following two or more non-evaluable tumour assessments 
will be included. In addition, and within the same sensitivity analysis, subjects who take subsequent 
therapy (note that for this analysis radiotherapy is not considered a subsequent anticancer therapy) 
prior to their last evaluable RECIST assessment or progression or death will be censored at their 
last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent therapy. 
•  Ascertainment bias will be assessed by analysing the site investigator data. The stratified log-rank 
test will be repeated on the programmatically derived PFS using the site investigator data. 
•  An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed with the covariates used in the statistical model 
derived from eCRF data rather than using the values from IVRS. 
Consistency of treatment effect between subgroups: Interactions between treatment and 
stratification factors will be tested to rule out any qualitative interaction using the approach of Gail and 
Simon (Gail and Simon 1985). This test will be performed separately for the treatment comparisons of 
the dual primary and key secondary endpoints based on the FAS. 
Overall survival 
OS will be analysed using stratified log-rank tests, using the same methodology as described for the 
PFS endpoints. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 86/162 
 
 
  
 
 
The assumption of proportionality will be assessed in the same way as for PFS. 
Censoring rules for OS: Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored 
based on the last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. 
Sensitivity analysis and additional supportive summaries: A three-component stratified max-
combo test will be used as a sensitivity analysis with the same stratification factors as the primary 
analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis for OS will examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias with regards 
to the treatment comparisons of the dual primary and key secondary endpoints, achieved by a Kaplan-
Meier plot of time to censoring where the censoring indicator of OS is reversed. 
A sensitivity analysis may be conducted to assess for the potential impact of COVID-19 deaths on OS. 
Exploratory analyses of OS adjusting for the impact of subsequent immunotherapy or other 
investigational treatment may be performed if a sufficient proportion of subjects switch. 
Objective response rate 
The ORR will be compared using logistic regression models adjusting for the same factors as the PFS 
endpoints. The results of the analysis will be presented in terms of an odds ratio (an odds ratio greater 
than 1 will favor the experimental arms) together with its associated profile likelihood 95% CI (e.g. 
using the option ‘LRCI’ in SAS procedure GENMOD) and p-value (based on twice the change in log-
likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model).  
If there are not enough responses for a meaningful analysis using logistic regression then a Fisher’s 
exact test using mid p-values will be presented. 
Interim analysis 
Interim analyses for efficacy will be performed by IDMC as described below: One interim analysis of 
PFS will be performed when approximately 80% of the target PFS events have occurred across Arms 2 
and 3. Three interim analyses of OS will be performed; the first at the time of the interim PFS analysis 
(approximately 45% of the target OS events in Arms 2 and 3), the second at the time of the primary 
PFS analysis (approximately 61% of the target OS events in Arms 2 and 3) and the third when 
approximately 84% of the target OS events have occurred in Arms 2 and 3. The interim analyses will 
be performed for the analyses specified in MTP. It is expected that global recruitment will have 
completed prior to the results of the interim analyses being available. 
The Lan DeMets spending function that approximates an O’Brien Fleming approach will be used to 
account for multiplicity introduced by including the one interim analysis for superiority. The boundaries 
for the treatment comparison will be derived based upon the exact number of events at the time of 
analyses. 
Multiple testing procedures for controlling the type 1 error rate 
In order to strongly control the type I error at 5% (2-sided), a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with 
gatekeeping strategy will be used across the dual primary endpoints and the secondary endpoints 
included in MTP. 
The dual primary endpoints: PFS and OS (durvalumab monotherapy +SoC chemotherapy versus SoC 
chemotherapy alone) in the ITT population (with PFS using BICR assessments per RECIST 1.1). 
The key secondary endpoints: PFS and OS (durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC 
chemotherapy and SoC chemotherapy alone) in the ITT population (with PFS using BICR assessments 
per RECIST 1.1). 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 87/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Hypotheses will be tested using a multiple testing procedure with an alpha-exhaustive recycling 
strategy (Burman et al 2009). With this approach, hypotheses will be tested in a pre-defined order as 
outlined in Figure 6. According to alpha (test mass) splitting and alpha recycling, if the higher level 
hypothesis in the MTP is rejected for superiority, the next lower level hypothesis will then be tested. 
The test mass that becomes available after each rejected hypothesis is recycled to lower level 
hypotheses not yet rejected. This testing procedure stops when the entire test mass is allocated to 
non- rejected hypotheses. Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, including 
recycling, will strongly control type I error at 5% (2-sided), among all the dual primary endpoints and 
the secondary endpoints included in MTP.

Amendment history 
The following changes of analysis from protocol are based on CSP v4.0, dated 25-SEP-2018: 
The SAP has been formulated to indicate that the following exploratory objective may not be produced, 
for the reason that the AZ imaging expert confirmed that AZ does not currently have the capacity of 
obtaining the data using irRECIST: 
To explore irRECIST as an assessment methodology for clinical benefit of durvalumab + tremelimumab 
combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy and durvalumab monotherapy + SoC chemotherapy 
compared with SoC chemotherapy alone with assessment by BICR has been changed to a potential. 
The analysis of expected duration of response (EDoR) was not a required analysis, so not included for 
DoR endpoints in the SAP. This is consistent with other durvalumab studies. 
The analysis of comparison of APF12 between treatment arms is removed to be consistent with other 
durvalumab studies. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 88/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Additional changes not included in SAP version 5.0 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis of ORR was added requiring confirmation of response no sooner than 4 
weeks after the initial CR/PR was conducted. 
Symptom improvement rate was analysed using logistic regression, using Proc Logistic instead of Proc 
Genmod. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 1807 patients were screened into the POSEIDON study: of these, 1013 patients were 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the study arms (T + D + SoC, D + SoC or SoC alone arms) at 
142 study centres across 18 countries in North and Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa. 
Patient disposition is summarised in the following figure. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 89/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Figure 19. Patient disposition - POSEIDON 
Note: The category “condition worsened” corresponds to “disease progression”. 
A total of 760 patients failed screening. The majority of them did so because of eligibility criteria, 
particularly concerning EGFR/ALK status (36% of all screen failures), missing PD-L1 status (19%), or 
investigator judgement (8%). 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 90/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The proportions of patients who discontinued any study treatment on account of adverse events are 
nearly identical in the experimental T+D+SoC and D+SoC arms (23% in each) and nearly double the 
proportion of discontinuations from the control SoC arm (13%).

•  Recruitment 
The first patient was screened on 01-JUN- 2017, and the first patient was randomized on 27-JUN-
2017. 
The last patient was randomised on 19-SEP-2018. 
The median duration of survival follow-up (DCO 12-MAR-2021) in all patients across the 3 treatment 
arms was 12.52 months (range: 0.0 to 44.5). The median duration of follow up in all patients in the T 
+ D + SoC arm was 13.63 months (range: 0.3 to 43.9), D + SoC was 12.73 months (range 0.0 to 
44.5), and in the SoC alone arm was 11.17 months (range: 0.0 to 43.9).

A routine GCP inspection of study D419MC00004 (POSEIDON) was conducted at one investigational 
site in Germany (21-25 February 2022), the main CRO in the USA (11-17 March 2022), and the 
sponsor in Canada (21-25 March 2022). One critical finding was reported during the CRO inspection; 
major and minor findings were observed at all sites (see section 3.2).

•  Outcomes and estimation 
The CSR reported the final analysis for the study, based on the DCO dates of 24-JUL-2019 (RECIST-
related endpoints) and 12-MAR-2021 (all other data). 
At the time of the PFS analysis DCO date (24-JUL-2019), the PFS data had reached 75.7% maturity 
(511 PFS events from 675 patients in the D + SoC and SoC alone arms). 
At the time of the OS analysis DCO (12-MAR-2021), the OS data had reached 81.3% maturity (549 OS 
events from 675 patients in the D + SoC and SoC alone arms). 
Outcomes of the multiple testing procedure (MTP) - POSEIDON: 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.

An odds ratio >1 favors T + D + SoC compared to SoC chemotherapy alone. 
Response does not require confirmation. 
In practice, considering '5 weeks' as threshold to allow for the 1-week permitted time-window. 
DoR is the time from the first documentation of complete response or partial response until the date of progression, death in 
absence of progression, or the last evaluable RECIST assessment for patients who progress or die after 2 or more missed 
visits. 
Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.

The analysis was performed using logistic regression adjusting for PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs 
non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB), with the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach and the p-
value calculated based on twice the change in log-likelihood resulting from the addition of a treatment factor to the model. 
There was 1 patient who died 1 day prior to randomization and was censored at Day 1.

The HR and CI are estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model with the Efron method to control for ties, the stratification factors 
PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB) in the strata 
statement, and the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. A hazard ratio <1 favors D +T + SoC or D + SoC to be associated with a 
longer PFS than SoC chemotherapy. 
P-values were generated using the stratified log-rank test adjusting for PD-L1 (PD-L1 ≥50% vs PD-L1 <50%), histology (squamous vs non-
squamous), and disease stage (Stage IVA vs Stage IVB) and using the Breslow approach for handling ties.

Patients who have not progressed or died, or who progress or die after 2 or more missed visits, are censored at the latest evaluable RECIST 
assessment or at Day 1 if there are no evaluable visits or no baseline data and patient did not die within 2 visits of baseline. 
The midpoint between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment (using the final date of the assessment) is analyzed. 
Patients who have not progressed or died will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 
assessment, or at Day 1 if there are no evaluable visits. In addition, patients initiating subsequent therapy prior to their last evaluable RECIST 
assessment, progression or death in absence of progression, will be censored at their last evaluable assessment prior to starting subsequent 
therapy. 
Progression is determined by site investigator assessment, RECIST 1.1. 
Covariates used in the statistical model are derived from eCRF data rather than using the values from IVRS.

Table 50. Summary of Patient Age by Study (Full Analysis Set) 
2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
As explained in the inclusion criteria of pivotal study POSEIDON, the collection of archival/residual 
diagnostic tumour tissue was mandatory, for potential analysis of various markers by IHC or other 
methods. 
One of the exploratory objectives of the trial was to measure PD-L1 expression via the Ventana SP263 
PD-L1 IHC assay and/or TMB to fully investigate the relationship between a patient’s PD-L1 and/or TMB 
and efficacy outcomes with durvalumab, tremelimumab, and SoC regimens.

Study MYSTIC 
MYSTIC (D419AC00001) is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, global, Phase III study to determine 
the efficacy and safety of treatment with durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with tremelimumab 
(MEDI1123) or durvalumab monotherapy versus platinum-based standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy 
in the first-line treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A

Study NEPTUNE 
NEPTUNE was a Phase III, randomized, open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy versus platinum-based SoC chemotherapy in the 
first-line treatment of patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Crossover 
from SoC to durvalumab monotherapy or durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy was not 
permitted. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the OS benefits of durvalumab + 
tremelimumab vs. SoC used as 1L treatment. During the course of the study and based on the 
emerging results from MYSTIC study, the primary endpoint for NEPTUNE was amended after 
completion of enrolment to prospectively investigate OS in bTMB ≥20 mut/Mb population (results in 
Table N). A schematic diagram of the overall study design is shown in Figure R.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has submitted a MAA for tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor, for 
use in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of 
adults with metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK aberrations. The application is based on efficacy 
data from POSEIDON, a pivotal phase III, three-arm, randomised, multi-centre, open-label study 
which compared durvalumab + chemotherapy (D+SoC, Arm 2) and tremelimumab + durvalumab + 
chemotherapy (T+D+SoC, Arm 1) to standard-of-care histology-specific platinum-based chemotherapy 
(SoC, Arm 3). 
A total of 1013 patients were randomised between June 2017 and September 2018. The dual primary 
endpoints of BICR-PFS and OS were analysed in the ITT of the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, while identical 
secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT of the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant held several regulatory interactions with the US FDA during the development of 
tremelimumab in NSCLC, but scientific advice has not been sought from the CHMP.  
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 118/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Experimental and control arms: The overall design of POSEIDON resembles that of other recent 
landmark trials in the treatment-naïve setting of metastatic driver-negative NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 
expression, with platinum-based chemotherapy as control arm. Currently, multiple regiments for these 
patients are approved and recommendable across Europe, most of them containing one or more 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or nivolumab + ipilimumab) added 
to histology-selected platinum doublets. Even when this implies that platinum-based chemotherapy by 
itself has been long outdated as standard of care in this setting, it was still an appropriate choice of 
treatment at the time of design and conduct of POSEIDON.  
The fact that crossover was not allowed to avoid confounding OS is understood. Noting that a 
significant number of patients from the control arm would likely receive immune checkpoint inhibitors 
at progression, an exploratory PFS2 analysis was planned. 
Induction vs. maintenance effect: In both experimental arms (D+SoC and T+D+SoC), after induction 
chemotherapy + durvalumab +/- tremelimumab, durvalumab was to be maintained Q4W until 
progressive disease. Although such design does not allow to disentangle effect magnitude of induction 
vs. maintenance immune checkpoint inhibition, this does not constitute an impediment to evaluate the 
B/R profile of the add-on products in this palliative setting.   
Study participants: Inclusion/exclusion criteria in the POSEIDON trial did not suffer any major 
amendments along study conduct and appropriately reflect the target population as in the proposed 
therapeutic indication. Although the inclusion criteria declare that staging is to be determined per the 
IASLC staging manual in thoracic oncology 2016 by Rami-Porta et al, such parameters correspond to 
the AJCC 8th edition by Amin et al. The requirements for inclusion of patients with brain metastases 
are appropriate and in line with similar trials. PD-L1 testing by the SP263 IHC assay was centralised 
during the screening phase and before randomisation, which is endorsed. 
Objectives/endpoints: The current MAA for tremelimumab is based in efficacy results from the 
secondary objectives of this study. An improvement in survival is considered the most compelling 
outcome of a pivotal trial in Oncology, especially when supported by a reciprocal prolongation of PFS. 
The definitions for OS and RECIST 1.1-based BICR-PFS according to the protocol and SAP are 
appropriate. The definitions for the other secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR, PFS2 and PROs are also 
endorsed. 
Statistical methods: Sample size calculations are adequate. The stratification factors [PD-L1 tumour 
expression status (<50%; ≥50%), stage (IVA vs IVB) and histology (non-squamous vs squamous)] 
are clinically relevant and thus appropriate in this disease context. Censoring rules for PFS and OS are 
acceptable. The planned sensitivity and supplementary analyses to assess robustness of PFS and OS 
results are adequate, no additional analyses have been requested. Concerning interim analyses (one 
for PFS at approximately 80% of targeted events and three for OS at approximately 45%, 61% and 
84%), an alpha spending function was used to account for multiplicity due to multiple looks, which is 
acceptable. Regarding the hierarchical testing procedure, if at least OS or PFS of D+SoC vs. SoC were 
statistically significant, the corresponding alpha portion was transferred to the T+D+SoC vs. SoC 
comparison. This strategy controls the type I error. 
Participant flow and recruitment: 1807 patients were screened for eligibility. The screen failure rate 
(42%) is higher than expected, but understandable in view of stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria: the 
majority of patients failed screening because of EGFR/ALK status, missing PD-L1 status or investigator 
judgement. The proportion of patients who did not receive the assigned treatment across all three 
arms of POSEIDON is minimal and follows the characteristic attrition pattern in open-label trials: 
slightly more patients withdrew consent in the control arm. Recruitment of the whole study took 
approximately 1 year and 3 months. Median duration of follow-up of ~1 year in the ITT is considered 
borderline for assessment of B/R in the given clinical setting. 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 119/162 
 
 
  
 
 
Conduct of the study: Important protocol deviations occurred in a small proportion of patients and are 
overall balanced among arms. A major amendment modified the dual primary endpoints as of protocol 
V 4.0 (25-SEP-2018), when all patients had already been recruited (last patient randomised 19-SEP-
2018) and before the first interim analysis of PFS/OS on 07-JAN-2019. OS for the comparison of 
D+SoC vs. SoC was upgraded, while PFS of T+D+SoC vs. SoC was downgraded, establishing the 
comparisons of D+SoC vs. SoC in the first level (primary endpoints), while relegating the comparisons 
of T+D+SoC vs. SoC to secondary endpoints. According to the applicant, this change was justified on 
emerging external data from other immunotherapy trials. Since the statistical integrity of the trial 
could have been compromised due to changes in SAP, analyses according to original test hierarchy and 
study populations (first 804 patients randomised) were requested, which obtained successful results 
for PFS and OS testing of T+D+SoC vs. SoC.  
Baseline data: The demographic characteristics of patients were relatively balanced among all three 
arms of treatment and correspond to what is expected within the clinical setting of advanced driver-
negative NSCLC: median age was 64 years (27 to 87 years); 76% were male; 56% white, 35% Asian, 
2% black; current/past smokers 78%; 33% had ECOG PS 0. Disease characteristics were also 
balanced among arms: 50% had stage IVA and 50% IVB; 63% had non-squamous tumours and 37% 
squamous; brain/CNS metastases were present in 10.5% of patients; presence of KRAS mutations was 
evaluated in ~15% (149/1013) of the ITT, and documented in 21% (31/149) of those tested. The 
distribution of patients according to tumour PD-L1 status across diverse thresholds (</≥50%, 
</≥25%, </≥1%) was balanced among all three arms of treatment and represents the global pattern 
of PD-L1 expression in advanced NSCLC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
OS: At data cutoff 12-MAR-2021 and with a median survival follow-up of 12.5 months, 800 deaths had 
occurred (79% of OS maturity) in the ITT population of study POSEIDON. Treatment with T+D+SoC 
showed a statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI 
0.65, 0.92), p-value 0.00304. K-M estimates of median OS were 14.0 months in the T+D+SoC arm 
and 11.7 months in the SoC arm. Survival performance of the chemotherapy-only control arm in 
POSEIDON is comparable to other pivotal trials in a similar PD-L1 all-comer setting of metastatic 
NSCLC: range of 10.6 in KEYNOTE-189 to 13.9 months in IMpower130. The K-M curves of T+D+SoC 
vs. SoC separate as of the 10th month, noting a delayed treatment effect from added anti-CTLA-4/PD-
L1 therapy. Important censoring occurs as of the 30th month of follow-up, but landmark analysis at 24 
months (OS24) shows a considerably higher proportion of patients alive in the T+D+SoC (33%) as 
compared to the SoC (22%) arm. 
Acknowledging differences in study design –particularly selection of squamous (SQ) or non-squamous 
(NSQ) histologies, or allowing both– and limitations from cross-trial comparisons, it is to note that 
longer median survival was observed in akin studies in which only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents were added 
to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy in the experimental arm: 22.0 months in the chemo + 
pembrolizumab arm in metastatic NSQ NSCLC (KEYNOTE-189; Rodríguez-Abreu et al, JCO 2020); 21.9 
months in the chemo + cemiplimab arm in advanced SQ/NSQ NSCLC (EMPOWER-Lung3; Gogishvili et 
al, ESMO 2021); 19.5 months in the chemo + atezolizumab arm in metastatic SQ/NSQ NSCLC 
(IMpower150, Tecentriq SmPC); 18.6 months in the chemo + atezolizumab arm in metastatic NSQ 
NSCLC (IMpower130; Cappuzzo et al, Ann Onc 2018); 17.1 months in the chemo + pembrolizumab 
arm in metastatic SQ NSCLC (KEYNOTE-407; Paz-Ares et al, JTO 2020). Interestingly, however, the 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 120/162 
 
 
  
 
 
addition of both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy 
produced almost identical median OS results as those observed in POSEIDON: 14.1 months in the 
histology-based chemotherapy + nivolumab + ipilimumab arm in patients with metastatic SQ/NSQ 
NSCLC (CheckMate 9LA; Paz-Ares et al, Lancet Oncol 2021). 
BICR-PFS: At data cutoff 24-JUL-2019, 749 PFS events (74% maturity) had occurred across the three 
arms of POSEIDON. K-M estimated median PFS was numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm (6.2 
months) as compared with the SoC arm (4.8 months), while HR for PFS outlines the statistical 
advantage from T+D+SoC vs. SoC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.86), p-value 0.00031. The K-M curves 
separate as of the second month and remain separated, highlighting the PFS advantage of T+D+SoC. 
Overall, PFS results from the experimental (both T+D+SoC and D+SoC arms) and control arms of 
POSEIDON are comparable to those from other pivotal trials in the same setting. Results of PFS by 
investigator are overall comparable to BICR assessment and the HR for INV-PFS is consistent with that 
of BICR-PFS, discrepant declarations of the RECIST event occurred in a reasonably low number of 
instances. 
BICR-ORR/DoR: Rather than using the ITT, the calculations of ORR were done using patients with 
measurable disease as the denominator. This is acceptable in a phase III trial since OS and PFS are 
prioritised in hierarchical testing. Both confirmed and unconfirmed responses (almost all of them 
partial) were numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the control SoC arm. However, 
the proportion of responders (unconfirmed responses) was nearly identical between both experimental 
arms: 46.3% in T+D+SoC vs. 48.5% in D+SoC. Responses (unconfirmed responses) were more 
durable in the T+D+SoC arm (median DoR 7.4 months) as compared to the SoC arm (4.2 months), 
supporting the delayed treatment effect hypothesis portrayed in the OS analysis. 
Subsequent treatment/PFS2: A notably higher proportion of patients received subsequent treatments 
in the SoC arm (60%) as compared to either of the experimental arms (41% in T+D+SoC, 44% in 
D+SoC). As expected, the proportion of second-line immunotherapy was higher in the immunotherapy-
naïve SoC arm (49%, 95 out of 193) as compared to both T+D+SoC (9%, 11/121) and D+SoC (9%, 
12/137). Across the three arms of POSEIDON, 66% (435/658) of the PFS2 events were deaths in the 
absence of second progression. Albeit the median time to second progression or death (PFS2) was 
comparable among all three arms (10.2 months in T+D+SoC, 10.0 in D+SoC and 9.1 in SoC), HR for 
PFS2 (0.72) suggests sustained benefit from T+D+SoC vs. SoC.  
Ancillary analyses: OS and PFS benefits from T+D+SoC vs. SoC seem to be maintained across most of 
the prespecified subgroups. However, in elderly patients (≥75 years of age) a HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 
0.64, 1.71) for OS was reported for T+D+SoC (n=35) vs. SoC (n=40). Due to the exploratory nature 
of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn. This said, considering that an overall 
worse safety profile was observed in this subgroup of patients, a warning was included in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC stating that in elderly the combination therapy should be used with caution after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. Exploratory efficacy and safety results 
in this subgroup are outlined in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, respectively. 
Importantly, the efficacious advantage –in terms of OS, PFS and ORR– of T+D+SoC vs. SoC is 
maintained regardless of PD-L1 expression status, i.e., above and below diverse PD-L1 cut-offs. Of 
note, a similar outcome regarding PD-L1 subgroups was observed in the CheckMate-9LA trial, when 
the nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemotherapy arm was compared against the chemotherapy arm in an 
akin population of advanced NSCLC (p. 99/157, EPAR EMEA/H/C/WS1783). 
The sensitivity analyses of OS and PFS are consistent with the primary analysis of both variables. 
Exploratory analysis of T+D+SoC vs. D+SoC: The survival K-M curves of the experimental arms 
remain close along the first year of follow-up, and subsequently show a wider separation, suggesting 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 121/162 
 
 
  
 
 
the benefit from added tremelimumab is established in the long term. This hypothesis is reinforced 
when looking at the duration of response data, as the K-M curves between T+D+SoC and D+SoC 
exhibit wider separation than those from OS or PFS. Importantly, OS subgroup analyses in the PD-L1 
<1% population –about one third of the ITT– suggest the magnitude of survival benefit from T+D+SoC 
is particularly higher in this subgroup, as compared to that seen in across the other PD-L1 cut-offs, 
while the contribution of tremelimumab appears to be less clear as PD-L1 expression increases. 
However, these comparisons portray an exploratory nature –they were not statistically powered– and 
thus no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Supportive data from MYSTIC and NEPTUNE: Including POSEIDON, all three trials were open-label, 
randomised, had a similar metastatic NSCLC targeted population, and dual primary endpoints of OS 
and PFS. The essential difference was that MYSTIC and NEPTUNE did now allow a platinum-based 
backbone chemotherapy in the experimental arms, while POSEIDON did. The overall efficacy outcome 
of MYSTIC and NEPTUNE –none met their primary endpoints– was not different from other trials in 
which anti-PD-L1 monotherapy failed to show benefits for the ITT population, suggesting that the 
subgroup of patients who drive the beneficial trend for ICI-monotherapy were high-PD-L1 expressors 
(usually defined as PD-L1≥50%). Whether OS and PFS data from the ITT of either trial are supportive 
of efficacy benefits from adding tremelimumab to D+SoC is debatable, but in any case, it can be 
inferred that a detrimental OS/PFS effect is not evident. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although the primary OS endpoint for the comparison of durvalumab + chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy was not met in study POSEIDON, the favourable PFS comparison of these arms allowed 
testing of the secondary endpoints of OS and PFS in the tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy 
(T+D+SoC) vs. chemotherapy (SoC) arms. In the targeted population of patients with metastatic 
EGFR/ALK-negative NSCLC regardless of tumour PD-L1 expression, OS and PFS from treatment with 
T+D+SoC were statistically superior to SoC chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR and 
PFS2 endorsed such benefits, as did subgroup and sensitivity analyses.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The pivotal study to support this indication is POSEIDON, a phase III, randomised, multicentre, three-
arm, open-label study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of durvalumab in combination with 
platinum-based chemotherapy (D+SoC) with that of SoC alone chemotherapy (SoC) for the first‑line 
treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the study also planned to compare the 
efficacy and safety of tremelimumab, durvalumab and SoC chemotherapy combination (T+D+SoC) 
with that of SoC chemotherapy in the same patient population. 
Safety dataset: The safety analysis set (SAS) of POSEIDON included all patients who received at least 
1 dose of study treatment and comprised 997 patients: T + D + SoC (n = 330); D + SoC (n = 334); 
and SoC chemotherapy (n = 333). Of note, 1 patient who was randomized to the T + D + SoC arm 
and 1 patient who was randomized to the D + SoC arm only received SoC chemotherapy (see protocol 
deviations) and were included in the SoC chemotherapy arm of the safety analysis set. 
For further support in the evaluation of the safety profile of tremelimumab, the applicant provided data 
from a safety pool (“T + D pan-tumour pool”) that included 2280 patients from 9 studies, who had 
received at least one dose of durvalumab at 1500 mg Q4W, 20 mg/kg Q4W or 10 mg/kg Q2W, in 
combination with tremelimumab at 75 mg Q4W or 1 mg/kg Q4W for any line of therapy across tumour 
types (Table 1). The main advantage of including the results from the T+D pan-tumour pool in the 
EMA/42903/2023

AEs: The integrated analysis of adverse events (AEs) for the safety pools was based on all 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as defined in each individual study. MedDRA v23.1 was 
used for coding of AE data. Data from studies originally reported in previous versions of MedDRA were 
upversioned to MedDRA v23.1 for the integrated safety database. 
AESIs: Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are defined as AEs with potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism that may require frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapies include standard 
endocrine supplementation, as well as treatment of symptoms resulting from endocrine disorders (eg. 
therapies for hyperthyroidism include beta blockers [eg. propranolol], calcium channel blockers [eg. 
verapamil, diltiazem], methimazole, propylthiouracil, and sodium perchlorate). 
imAEs: Immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) are AESIs (excluding infusion 
related/hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction) consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism that 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 123/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
require treatment with systemic corticosteroids, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressants, or endocrine 
therapy.  
The AESI categories include dermatitis/rash, pneumonitis, diarrhoea/colitis, endocrinopathies (adrenal 
insufficiency, hyperthyroid events, hypothyroid events, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and Type I diabetes 
mellitus), hepatic events, intestinal perforations, myocarditis, myositis, renal events, pancreatic 
events, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other rare/miscellaneous events. Infusion 
related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions are AESIs; however, these are not 
assessed for imAE designation because they are common to mAb drugs in general and occur due to a 
mechanism of action different from that for imAEs. 
Adjudication of imAEs: A suspected immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) was identified as AESI 
treated with systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine therapy, except 
pneumonitis AESIs, which are all suspected imAE. All suspected imAEs underwent medical review, 
which was performed in a blinded manner.  
A confirmed imAE is a suspected imAE that, after medical review, is deemed consistent with an 
immune-mediated mechanism of action, and where there is no clear alternative etiology. The process 
for adjudicating imAEs starting from the study level AE reporting dataset through to confirmed imAE 
included the steps depicted in Figure 36, and the process of adjudicating imAEs is presented in detail in 
the imAE Charter.

a Death related to disease under investigation was determined by the investigator. 
b Includes adverse events with an onset date, or pre-treatment AEs that increased in severity, on or after the date of first dose and up to and including 90 
days following the date of last dose of study treatment or up to the date of initiation of the first subsequent anticancer therapy (whichever occurred first). 
c AE start date ≤90 days following the last dose of study treatment and AE start date > the date of initiation of the first subsequent anticancer therapy 
(whichever occurred first). 
d Death not due to disease progression or a treatment emergent AE 
e Patients who died and are not captured in the earlier categories. Patient E780804 had a date of death prior to randomization (discovered after 
randomization). As such this patient is included in the FAS but their death does not fall under any of the other categories.

Patients with multiple events in the same category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than one 
category are counted once in each of those categories. 
AEs by PTs with a ≥ 3% higher incidence in patients ≥ 75 years compared with patients < 65 years or 65-74 years and occurring in 
≥ 10% of patients that are ≥ 75 years.. 
Includes AEs with an onset date or pre-treatment AEs that increase in severity on or after the date of first dose and up to and 
including the earlier of 90 days following the date of last dose of study treatment or the date of initiation of the first subsequent 
therapy (whichever occurred first).

Patients are counted once for each preferred term. Number (%) of patients with AEs, sorted by alphabetical order for 
preferred term. Each patient has only been represented with the maximum reported CTCAE grade at either the start of AE or 
after increasing in severity for each system organ class/preferred term. 
The boundaries for the weight quartiles are derived from the overall POSEIDON population with known baseline weight (n = 
1009) and are Q1 = 57.0 kg, Q2 = 67.2 kg and Q3 = 77.0 kg, respectively.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
POSEIDON: Of the 286 durvalumab evaluable patients in the same arm, 42 (14.7%) tested positive for 
durvalumab at any visit. Of the 278 tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients in the T + D + SoC arm, 44 
(15.8%) tested positive for tremelimumab ADA at any visit. The overall safety and tolerability profile of 
patients with ADAs was similar to those without ADAs. 
T + D pan-tumour pool: Of the 1379 durvalumab-evaluable patients, 86 (6.2%) tested positive for 
durvalumab at any visit. Of the 1337 tremelimumab ADA-evaluable patients, 171 (12.8%) tested 
positive for tremelimumab at any visit.  
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Durvalumab and tremelimumab are immunoglobulins, therefore, no formal pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction studies have been conducted.

2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Tremelimumab is not yet approved for use in any country. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The requested indication is for tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy. In 
order to understand the isolated safety profile of tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody, a 
supplementary analysis of phase II and III trials in which it was administered as monotherapy was 
presented. The tremelimumab monotherapy pool contained 643 patients treated at 10 mg/kg or a 
fixed dose of 750 mg Q4W, regimens that do not compare to the dose intended for marketing 
authorisation (75 mg Q4W). Although tables for the most common PTs for each of the categories were 
not tabulated by frequency, it was determined that diarrhoea was the most common likely-related AE, 
with an incidence of 40% (any grade) and 13% of patients presenting ≥G3 diarrhoea. Of note, 
immune-mediated colitis is a well-known AE from anti-CTLA-4 treatment. 
To evaluate the safety profile of tremelimumab in combination, safety results were also provided for all 
three arms of pivotal trial POSEIDON (T+D+SoC, D+SoC and SoC), a “T+D+chemo pool” and a “T+D 
pan-tumour pool”. The supportive pooled data have been used to try to elucidate the contribution of T 
+ D to the safety profile of the proposed combination. The size and content of the presented safety 
database are deemed sufficient for B/R assessment in the targeted advanced NSCLC population. 
Out of the entire pipeline of phase I, II and III trials where tremelimumab was given in monotherapy 
or in combination at multiple doses/regimens for diverse cancers, the latter was established by 
selecting 8 trials (2 in solid tumours, 4 NSCLC, 2 HNSCC) in which tremelimumab was administered at 
1 mg/kg Q4W x 4 in combination with durvalumab, and 1 single trial (HCC) in which tremelimumab 
was administered at the flat 75 mg dose, the one intended for approval. The selection of these trials 
and exclusion of others (e.g. DANUBE) has been well justified.  
The “T+D+chemo pool” included the T+D+SoC chemotherapy arms of POSEIDON (NSCLC) and 
CASPIAN (ES-SCLC). There is at least another ongoing trial with a T+D+chemo arm (NILE, patients 
with advanced urothelial carcinoma), but results are not expected until 2023. 
Adjudication of imAEs in the POSEIDON study was done programmatically (following a prespecified 
algorithm, without independent review), which is acceptable. 
Exposure: According to the protocol of POSEIDON, tremelimumab as part of the T+D+SoC arm was to 
be administered for up to 5 doses (C1-4, C6). About 66% of patients in the T+D+SoC arm of 
POSEIDON received 5 or more tremelimumab doses, roughly comparable to 61% in CASPIAN. 
Durvalumab was instead to be given along induction chemotherapy (Q3W x 4 cycles), and then 
maintained Q4W until patients met any of the discontinuation criteria. Durvalumab exposure was 
appropriate overall (mean of 12 cycles in both experimental arms, more than half patients receiving 
8). Chemotherapy could be given for a maximum of 4 cycles in the experimental arms and 6 cycles in 
the control arm. Across the three arms, the majority of patients received 4 or more cycles of 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 147/162 
 
 
  
 
 
chemotherapy (80% in T+D+SoC, 82% D+SoC and 75% SoC), implying that added immunotherapy 
did not have an impact on chemotherapy exposure. The distribution of the 5 histology-specific 
chemotherapy doublets permitted in the study was balanced among the three arms and reflects global 
trends in physician’s choice for this setting. 
Overall, exposure parameters of chemotherapy, durvalumab and tremelimumab across the different 
arms of study POSEIDON are considered appropriate for the assessment of B/R. 
AEs occurred in almost all patients across the three arms of POSEIDON. While high-grade (G3/4) AEs 
occurred in about half of the patients from each arm, G5 AEs were slightly more frequent in the 
experimental arms (12% in T+D+SoC, 10% D+SoC, 9% SoC), as were SAEs (44%, 40% and 35%, 
respectively) and AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment (22%, 24% and 15%, respectively).  
25 out the 26 most frequent AEs (incidence ≥10% in any arm) exhibited numerically higher incidence 
in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm, while the opposite occurred only for neutrophil 
count decreased. Typical chemotherapy-related AEs (anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, decreased 
appetite and fatigue) were the five most frequent AEs across the three arms of POSEIDON, with 
slightly higher incidence in the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm. Diarrhoea and rash, with 
potentially immune-related pathophysiology, were considerably more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm 
than in the SoC arm (22% and 19% vs. 15% and 7%, respectively). Of note, comparable incidence of 
both AEs was observed in similar arms from the Checkmate-9LA trial: 20% and 18% vs. 12% and 3% 
(EPAR WS-1783, p. 125/157), noting that patients only received two chemotherapy cycles in this trial. 
The incidence of hypothyroidism, a well-known imAE, was noticeably higher in the T+D+SoC arm 
(12%) than in the D+SoC (6%) or SoC (1%) arms. In line with these data, the incidence of this AE 
was 11% across both T+D+chemo and T+D pan-tumour pools. 
High-grade (≥G3) AEs: Since the proportions of G3/4 AEs were similar in both T+D+SoC and SoC 
arms (53% and 52%, respectively), it can be inferred that the higher incidence of G≥3 AEs in the 
T+D+SoC arm (66% vs. 61% in SoC) is driven by G5 AEs (12.4% and 9%, respectively), which is 
worrisome. Noting that G5 AEs occurred in 10.2% of the D+SoC arm, it becomes apparent that the 
addition of tremelimumab increases the risk for toxic death.  
The proportions of the most frequent G3/4 AEs were overall similar across the three arms of 
POSEIDON, highlighting events of chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, increases in pancreatic and 
hepatic enzymes and pneumonia. Of note, high-grade imAEs were not among the most frequently 
observed events in the experimental arms. 
AESIs/imAEs: AESIs included imAEs and infusion-related reactions (IRRs) or hypersensitivity/ 
anaphylaxis reactions.  
The proportion of patients with imAEs was 32% in the T+D+SoC arm, 17% in the D+SoC and 4% in 
the SoC arm. The distribution of G3/4 imAEs (10%, 6% and 1%, respectively), serious imAEs (9%, 5% 
and 1%) and imAEs leading to discontinuation (5%, 4% and 1%) were similar. The distribution of 
specific imAEs in the D+SoC arm is typical for PD-L1 inhibition, with predominance of hypothyroidism 
(6%), hepatotoxicity (3%), pneumonitis (3%) and dermatitis/rash (2%).  
Endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity and rash/dermatitis are overall more manageable than other imAEs, 
have less impact in morbidity, and less likelihood for becoming serious events or worsening the overall 
outcome of a patient. Events of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of rash or dermatitis and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or 
corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 148/162 
 
 
  
 
 
On the other hand, diarrhoea/colitis and pneumonitis might present as challenges since they imply a 
symptomatic burden and often require hospitalisation. The T+D+SoC arm presented twice as many 
cases of immune-mediated diarrhoea/colitis than the D+SoC arm (14 vs. 6) and more cases of 
pneumonitis (14 vs. 9). 
Despite an unexpected proportion of pancreatic events was reported as AESIs in the T+D+SoC arm 
(any-grade 14%, G3/4 1.2%), most of these correspond to laboratorial anomalies (elevations of 
amylase and lipase, among others). 
Of note, there was one death related to multiple imAEs: pancreatitis, hepatitis, myocarditis and 
nephritis: these events took place shortly after the second treatment cycle. Patients should be 
monitored for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment with Tremelimumab 
AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Patients 
should be monitored for abnormal renal function tests prior to and periodically during treatment. 
Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-mediated pancreatitis and 
myocarditis. Immune mediated hepatitis, nephritis, pancreatitis and myocarditis should be managed 
through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
There was one death due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the D+SoC arm. 
Given the mechanism of action of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, other potential 
immune mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been observed in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab: myasthenia 
gravis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune 
thrombocytopenia and cystitis noninfective. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and 
managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
IRRs and hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions were rare across the three arms of POSEIDON, and 
nearly all were G1/2: there was only one patient who presented a G3 IRR in the T+D+SoC arm, and 
nobody presented ≥G4 events. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of IRRs. IRRs 
should be managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation, prophylaxis and appropriate 
treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
ADRs: The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions observed in patients treated with T+D+SoC 
(n=330) in the POSEIDON trial were anaemia (49.7%), nausea (41.5%), neutropenia (41.2%), fatigue 
(36.1%), rash (25.8%) thrombocytopenia (24.5%), and diarrhoea (21.5%). The most common  (> 
2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were neutropenia (23.9%), anaemia (20.6%), pneumonia (9.4%), 
thrombocytopenia (8.2%), leukopenia (5.5%), fatigue (5.2%), lipase increased (3.9%), amylase 
increased (3.6%), febrile neutropenia (2.4%), colitis (2.1%) and aspartate aminotransferase 
increased/alanine aminotransferase increased (2.1%).  
SAEs: Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in the trial, and its incidence in the T+D+SoC arm 
doubled that of the control arm SoC (11% vs. 5%). As expected, myelotoxic events (anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia), likely related to chemotherapy, 
were also frequent in all three arms of the trial, with comparable incidence among them. 
Noting that diarrhoea and colitis are important identified risks of anti-CTLA-4 agent ipilimumab, it is of 
no surprise that the number of patients with serious diarrhoea was higher in the T+D+SoC arm (8 
patients), as compared to the other two arms (1 each) of the pivotal trial, pointing out the potential 
pathophysiologic role of CTLA-4 block in the development of serious immune-mediated 
diarrhoea/colitis. To support this hypothesis, the incidence of this SAE was nearly identical across the 
T+D+SoC arm (2.4%), and the T+D+chemo and T+D pools (2.5% in each). Data for colitis, slightly 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 149/162 
 
 
  
 
 
less prevalent, mimics this pattern. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
colitis/diarrhoea and intestinal perforation and managed through dose interruption, treatment 
discontinuation and/or corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Serious pneumonitis, with a likely immune-mediated background –known imAE from durvalumab– 
occurred almost exclusively in the experimental arms (6 cases in T+D+SoC, 5 in D+SoC, 1 in SoC). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Suspected pneumonitis should 
be confirmed with radiographic imaging and other infectious and disease-related aetiologies excluded, 
and managed through dose interruption, treatment discontinuation and corticosteroid treatment (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Deaths: Regardless of causality, there were 41 AEs leading to death in the T+D+SoC arm, 34 in the 
D+SoC arm and 30 in the SoC arm. The most frequent category (system organ class) of AEs leading to 
death across all three arms of POSEIDON was infections and infestations (15, 8 and 9, respectively), 
with 7 events of fatal pneumonia in each arm (although there was another event of fatal respiratory 
tract infection in the T+D+SoC arm). Cardiac disorders followed in frequency as AEs with outcome of 
death, again with almost twice as many occurrences in the T+D+SoC arm, as compared to the other 
two arms: 8, 4 and 5, respectively. On the other hand, fatal events of pulmonary embolism occurred 
much frequently in the control arm: 1, 3 and 5, respectively.  
Laboratory findings: Shifts in haematological parameters were comparable between the T+D+SoC and 
SoC arms of the pivotal trial. Increases of ALT/AST/bilirubin were noticeably higher in the T+D+SoC 
arm across different categories. This parallels the overall higher incidence of hepatobiliary disorders 
(8.2% patients in the T+D+SoC arm vs. 3.3% in the SoC arm). Paradoxically, a potential Hy’s law 
definition was met in more patients from the SoC arm (9) as compared to the T+D+SoC arm (3). 
Incidence of AE of hypothyroidism was declared in 11.8% in the T+D+SoC arm, 6.3% in the D+SoC 
arm and 1.2% in the SoC arm (p. 190/9160 ISS), highlighting likely immune-mediated 
pathophysiology in relationship to the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The true incidence of 
subclinical –likely immune-mediated– hypothyroidism is probably higher, as the table on abnormal 
thyroid tests suggest, elevated TSH was evident in 31% of patients from the T+D+SoC arm, vs. 28 in 
the D+SoC arm, and 24% in the SoC arm. Patients should be monitored for abnormal thyroid function 
tests prior to and periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation. Immune-
mediated hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis should be managed through dose 
interruption, symptomatic treatment or thyroid hormone replacement as clinically indicated (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Immune mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in patients receiving Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in 
combination with durvalumab. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency. For symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, patients should be managed through dose 
interruption, corticoisteroid treatment and hormone replacement (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC). 
Immune mediated type 1 diabetes mellitus, which can first present as diabetic ketoacidosis that can be 
fatal if not detected early, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of type 1 
diabetes mellitus. For symptomatic type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients should be managed via treatment 
with insulin as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis or hypopituitarism. For 
symptomatic hypophysitis or hypopituitarism, patients should be managed as recommended through 
dose interruption and corticoisteroid treatment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).

Individual patient listings of ECG values have been provided. The risk of QT prolongation in relationship 
to tremelimumab appears low. 
AEs by age subgroups: In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in 
combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were 
reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of 
age or older are limited to a total of 74 patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse 
reactions and discontinuation of any study treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 
years of age or older treated with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years 
of age or older who received platinum-based chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively). 
Careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is 
recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Overview of AEs by subgroups of other intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics does not show a specific 
pattern of safety concerns in a subgroup of considerable size. Data on safety by weight quartiles does 
not suggest major differences except for a higher incidence of maximum CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 in the 
subgroup of patients with the lowest body weight (i.e. <57 kg). However, a particular toxicity trend for 
the occurrence of high-grade events was not observed. 
AEs by ADA status: The proportions of patients with anti-tremelimumab antibodies in the T+D+SoC 
arm and T+D pan-tumour pool were similar (16% and 13%, respectively), but those for anti-
durvalumab antibodies were higher in POSEIDON (15% and 6%, respectively). The incidence of AEs 
across the diverse categories did not differ significantly for patients defined as ADA+ or ADA- 
(durvalumab in both experimental arms and tremelimumab in arm T+D+SoC). 
AEs leading to discontinuation: The overall proportion of patients that discontinued any treatment in 
the context of an AE was higher in the experimental arms (22% in T+D+SoC, 20% in D+SoC) than in 
the control arm (15%). The main AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment across the three 
arms of POSEIDON were pneumonia, anaemia and acute kidney injury. The addition of tremelimumab 
or durvalumab does not translate into a higher rate of AEs leading to dose reduction of chemotherapy. 
There are no data on the use of tremelimumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, 
tremelimumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. Tremelimumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 
months after the last dose.  
There is no information regarding the presence of tremelimumab in human milk, the absorption and 
effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG2 is excreted in human 
milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions from tremelimumab in breast-fed infants, breast-
feeding women are advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last 
dose. 
Tremelimumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Regardless of causality, all AEs categories (high-grade, serious, AEs leading to death or to treatment 
discontinuation, AESIs/imAEs) occurred in a numerically higher proportion of patients from the 
T+D+SoC arm as compared to the other two arms of pivotal trial POSEIDON.

Undoubtedly, the addition of double checkpoint inhibition (PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to a backbone platinum 
doublet imposes higher overall toxicity in the targeted population, which must be considered in the 
context of frail patients, particularly those of advanced age or multiple comorbidities. Immune-
mediated events are the main concern from the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab: 
although most were manageable and did not considerably impact long-term clinical outcome (e.g. 
endocrinopathies, hepatotoxicity and rash/dermatitis), others constitute serious entities with a 
significant symptomatic burden (diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis), representing a considerable hazard to 
the wellbeing of patients in this palliative setting.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.10.2022. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to use minimum particulars on the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. However the QRD 
Group would like the applicant to take note of the following remarks: 
• 
Vial label: The short pharmaceutical form can be used as proposed on the multilingual label. 
However on the single language labels the full pharmaceutical form should be used. If not possible, 
‘after dilution’ should be added next to the route of administration, i.e. “IV after dilution”. Due to space 
constraints the QRD remarks could not be implemented. 
• 
Outer carton: The statement “Keep out of the sight and reach of children” can be grey-shaded 
in Annex IIIA, and there is no need to print it on the actual carton as the product will be handled by 
healthcare professionals only. This will leave more space on the carton to improve readability of the 
rest of information. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca 
(tremelimumab) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance 
which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication is: 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 
no sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK positive mutations. 
The aim of added tremelimumab in the targeted population is to prolong overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first line (1L) treatment of metastatic NSCLC has evolved from cytotoxic chemotherapies based on 
physician’s preference to a hallmark of personalized medicine, with subsets of patients treated 
according to the genetic alterations of their tumour and PD-L1 status, which predict for benefit from 
targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), respectively. 
For patients without genetic drivers (e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS1), treatment selection in clinical practice is 
usually based on PD-L1 expression or histology. For patients with high PD-L1 expression (i.e., PD-L1 
expressed in ≥50% of tumour cells), monotherapy with either pembrolizumab or atezolizumab or 
cemiplimab are acceptable approved. Conversely, regardless of PD-L1 expression, a series of 
combinations of immunotherapy with histology-selected platinum-based chemotherapy have also 
shown survival benefits, which led to EMA approval:  
• Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel for squamous histology 
• Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed for non-squamous histology 
• Atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
• Atezolizumab + carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel for non-squamous histology 
• Nivolumab + ipilimumab + 2 cycles of platinum-doublet, regardless of histology 
Although immunochemotherapy treatments are the 1L standard-of-care in patients with advanced 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumours do not harbour driver mutations, new treatment options are required 
that can explore the potential of immunotherapy strategies and benefit a broader patient population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
POSEIDON is a phase III, three-arm, randomised, multi-centre, open-label study in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK aberrations, which compared durvalumab + chemotherapy 
(D+SoC, n=338) and tremelimumab + durvalumab + chemotherapy (T+D+SoC, n=338) to standard-
of-care histology-specific platinum-based chemotherapy (SoC, n=337).  
The dual primary endpoints of BICR-PFS and OS were analysed in the ITT of the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, 
while identical secondary endpoints were evaluated in the ITT of the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms.  
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 154/162 
 
 
  
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary OS endpoint (D+SoC vs SoC) in study POSEIDON did not meet statistical significance. 
However, the other primary PFS endpoint that compared the same arms showed statistical superiority 
and thus alpha was propagated to the next testing level, in which OS and PFS were evaluated as key 
secondary endpoints in the T+D+SoC vs. SoC arms. 
•  At data cutoff 12-MAR-2021 and with median survival follow-up of 12.5 months, 800 deaths had 
occurred (79% of OS maturity) in the ITT population. Treatment with T+D+SoC showed a 
statistically significant survival benefit as compared with SoC: HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 
0.92), p-value 0.00304. K-M estimates of median OS were 14.0 months in the T+D+SoC arm and 
11.7 months in the SoC arm. 
•  At data cutoff 24-JUL-2019, 749 PFS events (74% maturity) had occurred across the three arms of 
the trial. K-M estimated median PFS was numerically higher in the T+D+SoC arm (6.2 months) 
than in the SoC arm (4.8 months), while HR for PFS outlines the statistical advantage from 
T+D+SoC vs. SoC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.60, 0.86), p-value 0.00031. 
•  Secondary endpoints of ORR, DoR and PFS2 endorsed the advantage of T+D+SoC over SoC, as did 
subgroup and diverse sensitivity analyses.  
•  The benefit of T+D+SoC vs. SoC –in terms of OS, PFS and ORR– is maintained regardless of PD-L1 
expression status, i.e., above and below various PD-L1 cutoffs (1%, 25%, 50%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  Acknowledging differences in study design –particularly selection of squamous (SQ) or non-
squamous (NSQ) histologies or allowing both– and limitations from cross-trial comparisons, it is 
noted that longer median survival was observed in akin studies in which only anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
agents were added to backbone platinum-based chemotherapy in the experimental arm. 
•  Even if the combination of T+D+SoC has demonstrated an improvement in OS, PFS and ORR 
compared with the SoC alone, the contribution of tremelimumab to this effect appears marginal in 
view of the results of a descriptive comparison with D+SoC. Since these analyses were not 
statistically powered, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
•  The OS benefit of T+D+SoC over SoC seems minimal in Asian patients and non-smokers. Of note, 
the smaller effect in the subgroup of non-smoker patients has already been observed in prior 
studies with immunotherapy. However, both subgroups were less represented in the T+D+SoC arm 
compared with the SoC arm. 
• 
In elderly patients (≥75 years of age) a HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was reported for 
T+D+SoC (n=35) vs. SoC (n=40). The uncertainty regarding efficacy (and safety) in this subgroup 
of patients is reflected in the SmPC.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  AEs occurred in almost all patients across the three arms of POSEIDON. While high-grade (G3/4) 
AEs occurred in about half of the patients from each arm, G5 AEs were slightly more frequent in the 
experimental arms (12% in T+D+SoC, 10% D+SoC, 9% SoC), as were SAEs (44%, 40% and 35%, 
respectively) and AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment (22%, 24% and 15%, 
respectively).  
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 155/162 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Typical chemotherapy-related AEs (anaemia, nausea, neutropenia, decreased appetite and fatigue) 
were the five most frequent AEs across the three arms of the trial, with slightly higher incidence in 
the T+D+SoC arm as compared to the SoC arm. Diarrhoea and rash, with potentially immune-
related pathophysiology, were considerably more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm than in the SoC 
arm (22% and 19% vs. 15% and 7%, respectively). 
•  The higher incidence of G≥3 AEs in the T+D+SoC arm (66% vs. 61% in SoC) is driven by G5 AEs 
(12.4% and 9%, respectively). The proportions of the most frequent G3/4 AEs were overall similar 
across the three arms of the trial, highlighting events of chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, 
increases in pancreatic and hepatic enzymes and pneumonia. 
•  Regarding causality of AEs, it is difficult to elucidate which events could be caused by the 
chemotherapy component and which ones could be related to tremelimumab and/or durvalumab. 
Incidence of AEs reported with a ≥5% difference between both arms were: neutropenia (30.0% vs 
23.4%), diarrhoea (21.5% vs. 15.3%), rash (19.4% vs. 6.6%), pyrexia (16.1% vs. 6.9%), 
arthralgia (12.4% vs. 6.3%), hypothyroidism (11.8% vs. 1.2%), pruritus (10.9% vs. 4.5%), and 
hyperthyroidism (5.8% vs. 0.6%). 
•  There were 41 AEs leading to death (G5 AEs) in the T+D+SoC arm, 34 in the D+SoC arm and 30 in 
the SoC arm. Most of these events were related to infections and cardiac disorders, noting that 
twice as many toxic deaths from infections occurred in the T+D+SoC arm, as compared to the other 
two arms (15, 8 and 9, respectively). 
•  The proportion of patients with imAEs was 32% in the T+D+SoC arm, 17% in the D+SoC and 4% in 
the SoC arm. The distribution of specific imAEs in the D+SoC arm is typical for PD-L1 inhibition, 
with predominance of hypothyroidism (6%), hepatotoxicity (3%), pneumonitis (3%) and 
dermatitis/rash (2%). The T+D+SoC arm presented twice as many cases of immune-mediated 
diarrhoea/colitis than the D+SoC arm (14 vs. 6) and more cases of pneumonitis (14 vs. 9). 
Hypothyroidism was more frequent in the T+D+SoC arm (12%) than in the D+SoC (6%) or SoC 
(1%) arms.  
•  Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in the trial, and its incidence in the T+D+SoC arm doubled 
that of the control arm SoC (11% vs. 5%). Serious myelotoxic events, likely related to 
chemotherapy, were also frequent in all three arms of the trial, with comparable incidence among 
them. Serious pneumonitis and colitis/diarrhoea were more prevalent in the T+D+SoC arm than in 
the other two arms. 
•  The overall proportion of patients that discontinued any treatment in the context of an AE was 
higher in the experimental arms (22% in T+D+SoC, 20% in D+SoC) than in the control arm (15%). 
The main AEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment across the three arms of POSEIDON were 
pneumonia, anaemia and acute kidney injury. 
•  Patients who were 75 years or older (11% from the pivotal trial) presented a significantly higher 
proportion of SAEs (74% in T+D+SoC vs. 56% SoC), high-grade AEs (71% vs. 64%), G5 AEs (40% 
vs. 14%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (49% vs. 23%) as compared to their 
younger counterparts. Caution should be exerted when considering treatment of tremelimumab + 
durvalumab + chemotherapy in patients older than 75 years. A specific warning in sections 4.4 and 
4.8 was inserted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The addition of immune checkpoint inhibition (PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4) to a platinum doublet has 
proven successful at prolonging survival in advanced driver-negative NSCLC: a series of trials 
conducted concurrently in the last few years –the majority depicting add-on design with platinum-
based chemotherapy as control– have shown improved efficacy outcomes of the experimental arms. 
Indeed, current guidelines across the globe highlight a plethora of immunochemotherapy regimens 
that are recommended for the initial approach in a treatment-naïve setting. While most of these 
combinations are appropriate regardless of tumoral PD-L1 expression, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as 
monotherapy are also adequate choices for high-expressors (≥50% of tumour cells).  
Albeit strictly unsuccessful for its primary OS endpoint in the D+SoC vs. SoC arms, the overall efficacy 
outcome of pivotal trial POSEIDON parallels results of other similar studies, noting statistically 
improved OS and PFS for the T+D+SoC vs. SoC comparisons. Upon appropriate maturity of the 
database, beneficial effects were observed across different PD-L1 cut-offs. Importantly, however, the 
EMA/42903/2023  
Page 157/162 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exploratory comparisons between the experimental arms seem to suggest a borderline efficacious 
advantage of the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab and chemotherapy, challenging the clinical 
relevance of double immune checkpoint inhibition, especially in the light of added immune toxicity 
risks. 
As thoroughly depicted in the safety section, all the categories of adverse events present numerically 
higher incidence in the experimental arms, particularly in the 4-drug combination implied in the 
therapeutic indication of tremelimumab. As expected, immune-mediated events prevailed in both 
experimental arms, and although the majority were low-grade and manageable (e.g. hypothyroidism, 
rash), potentially symptomatic events (e.g. diarrhoea/colitis, pneumonitis) occurred predominantly in 
the tremelimumab arm. Undeniably, if dual PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibition plus chemotherapy are 
considered for advanced NSCLC, toxicity and tolerability concerns are to be taken into account, 
particularly for more frail or elderly patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy data from the POSEIDON trial are sufficiently mature: it seems unlikely that updated results 
would alter the current conclusions.  
Although the combination of tremelimumab, durvalumab and platinum-based does not seem to fill an 
unmet medical need in the current therapeutic paradigm of advanced NSCLC, it could be considered 
another appropriate chemoimmunotherapy regimen in this palliative setting. 
The addition of tremelimumab and durvalumab to chemotherapy results in considerably increased 
toxicity, in particular relating to higher incidence of serious and grade 5 adverse events. Furthermore, 
the symptomatic burden and safety risks from immune-mediate events whose incidence raise with 
CTLA-4 blockade –e.g. colitis/diarrhoea, pneumonitis– are a particular concern from added 
tremelimumab. Special caution must be exerted when considering this regimen for patients ≥75 years. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic NSCLC with no 
sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK positive mutations is positive, subject to the conditions stated in 
section ‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is favourable in the following indication: 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 
no sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK positive mutations.

Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tremelimumab is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

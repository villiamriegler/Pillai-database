Darunavir Mylan 
darunavir 
On 10 November 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Darunavir 
Mylan, intended for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. The applicant for 
this medicinal product is Mylan S.A.S.  
Darunavir Mylan will be available as film-coated tablets (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and 
800 mg). The active substance of Darunavir Mylan is darunavir, a protease inhibitor (ATC code: 
J05AE10). It acts by inhibiting the HIV enzyme protease, thus preventing formation of mature virus. 
Darunavir must be given with a small dose of ritonavir or cobicistat (as a booster), which decreases the 
breakdown of darunavir in the liver, resulting in higher levels of darunavir in the blood.  
Darunavir Mylan is a generic of Prezista, which has been authorised in the EU since 12 February 2007. 
Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Darunavir Mylan and its bioequivalence to the 
reference product Prezista. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg tablets 
“Darunavir, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. 
Darunavir Mylan tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see section 4.2): 
• 
• 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult patients, 
including those that have been highly pre-treated. 
For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg 
body weight. 
In deciding to initiate treatment with darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of

mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and 
treatment history should guide the use of daranuvir.” 
400 mg and 800 mg tablets 
“Darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.  
Darunavir co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult patients (see 
section 4.2).  
Darunavir Mylan tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection in adult and paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 40 kg body weight who are:  
• 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve (see section 4.2).  
•  ART-experienced with no darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) and who have 
plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. 
In deciding to initiate treatment with darunavir in such ART-experienced patients, genotypic testing 
should guide the use of darunavir (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).” 
It is proposed that Darunavir Mylan be initiated by a health care provider experienced in the management 
of HIV infection.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

1.   Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Invasive meningococcal infection is caused by Neisseria meningitides, a strictly human pathogen. 
Meningococcal meningitis, the most common pathological presentation of invasive meningococcal 
disease, is characterised by fever, headache and stiff neck and may have long-term sequelae such as 
mental retardation, sensor neural hearing loss, and seizure disorders. Meningococcemia is less 
common but has a high mortality rate even when treated.  
Onset of disease is usually very rapid with signs of fever, shock, embolic rash, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. Other common presenting signs of meningococcal 
disease are vomiting, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, cough or rhinorrhea and seizures. 
Complications include arthritis, myocarditis, pericarditis, endophthalmitis or pneumonia and may result 
in long term sequelae such as skin necrosis requiring grafts, limb necrosis requiring amputation, and 
chronic renal failure. Less common meningococcal diseases include pneumonia, occult febrile 
bacteraemia, conjunctivitis and chronic meningococcemia.  
The mortality rate of meningococcal disease is still approximately 10% in both developing and 
industrialised countries. According to WHO there are approximately 1.2 million cases per year causing 
an estimated 135,000 deaths. 
Thirteen meningococcal serogroups are currently recognised, based on the immunochemistry of the 
capsular polysaccharide. For epidemiological purposes, a further classification system exists, which 
divides strains immunologically into serotypes, serosubtypes and immunotypes, based on antigenic 
differences in the PorB OMP, PorA OMP, and lipo-oligosaccharides (immunotypes), respectively. 
Serogroups A, B, C, W-135 and Y are the most common causes of invasive meningococcal disease 
worldwide and serogroups A, B and C account for the vast majority of these cases (~90%). There are 
geographical differences and in Europe and Latin- America the dominant serogroups which cause 
disease are B followed by C. In United States B, C and Y dominate, while serogroup A is the major 
cause of meningococcal disease in Asia and Africa. However, the epidemiology of meningococcal 
disease is dynamic over time and the relative importance of the different serogroups fluctuates. An 
increase in serogroup Y disease has recently been observed in the Finland, Norway and Sweden and 
are now causing 12%, 7% and 20% of the meningococcal cases, respectively. In the other European 
countries serogroup Y appears in the range of 0-4% of cases. A similar increase in serogroup Y cases 
has been seen in United States where serogroup Y disease was uncommon, accounting for only 2% of 
cases in 1989-1991. By mid-1990s one third of the cases were caused by this serogroup. In Africa 
serogroups W-135 have emerged as an important cause of epidemic meningitis. This serogroup has 
previously been relatively uncommon globally.  
The incidence of meningococcal disease is highest in the youngest age groups (<1-4 years of age). 
However, older children, adolescents and adults are more often affected during epidemics. Asplenic 
persons, individuals with complement deficiencies and people living in close proximity to others (e.g. 
college/university students and military recruits) have an increased risk of developing meningococcal 
disease.  
Nasopharyngeal colonisation by meningococci is relatively common and is generally asymptomatic, but 
only a small percentage of colonised persons develop disease. Carriage rates vary with age with lower 
carriage rates being reported in young children and the highest rates in young adults. Once an 
individual has become colonised with Neisseria meningitidis, the likelihood of acquiring invasive 
meningococcal disease depends on the virulence of the particular organism, host factors affecting 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

Page 3/57
 
 
 
 
 
innate susceptibility, and the presence or absence of serum antibodies capable of activating 
complement-mediated bacteriolysis and clearing of the organism from the blood stream.  
The precise mechanism of immunity to meningococci is unknown, although it is thought to involve a 
complex interaction between innate and acquired immunity. Nevertheless, humoral immunity is 
thought to play a central role in host defence against N. meningitidis through complement mediated 
killing induced by antibodies towards both the capsular polysaccharide and sub-capsular structures.    
The polysaccharide capsules of N. meningitidis are important determinants of virulence. The capsular 
polysaccharides protect the meningococcus from desiccation, opsonisation, phagocytosis and 
complement-mediated bactericidal killing as well as aiding in transmission and colonisation. 
Plain polysaccharide vaccines have been available for protection against MenA, C, W-135 and Y for 
several decades but they are poorly or not at all immunogenic in young children, they do not elicit 
immune memory and they can cause hyporesponsiveness to repeated doses, especially for group C. 
Conjugate vaccines that employ appropriate protein carrier molecules have the potential to overcome 
these problems. Hence, two conjugated quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines are already 
approved in some countries. These are Menactra (conjugated to diphtheria toxoid; authorised for use 
in 2 to 55 year-olds in the USA, Canada and Gulf States) and Menveo (conjugated to CRM197) which 
was approved for use in the EU in March 2010 as a single dose for use from 11 years of age and has 
also been authorised 11 to 55 years in Canada and Australia and 2 to 55 years in the US. 
1.2.  About the product 
Menveo is a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, and Y 
(henceforth referred to as MenACWY).  MenACWY uses pre-sized oligosaccharides from each of the 
primary pathogenic serogroups (A, C, W, and Y) conjugated to the CRM197 protein carrier. The final 
formulation contains 10-5-5-5 μg per oligosaccharide of N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y 
respectively, without an adjuvant. 
MenACWY was authorised in March 2010 and is currently indicated for active immunization of 
adolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, 
C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with 
official recommendations.  
The vaccine is presented in the form of one vial containing the lyophilised MenA Conjugate Component 
plus excipients, and one syringe or one vial containing the liquid MenCWY Conjugate Component plus 
excipients. The pharmaceutical form is powder and solution for solution for injection. The additional 
immediate packaging for MenCWY liquid finished product (3mL glass vial with a 13 mm stopper and 
flip-off) in addition to the initially approved syringe was authorised in March 2011 (multidose package 
consisting of 5 MenA Lyo vials and 5 MenCWY liquid vials). In April 2011, a new presentation of single-
dose vial-vial package was also authorised. 
1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
CHMP Scientific Advice was sought on several occasions to discuss the clinical development of Menveo, 
including the development in children from 2 to 10 years of age. 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 4/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prior to the first submission in 2008, the CHMP answers concerning the clinical questions confirmed 
that: 
•  The use of human serum complement in the SBA test and SBA titer of ≥ 1:4 is acceptable as a 
surrogate measure of protection. A titer of 1:4 is considered seropositive. 
•  Standardisation of the SBA test should be extensively discussed, like the influence of strain of N. 
meningitidis used in the assay and other parameters. 
•  The importance of differentiating between subjects who are seropositive or seronegative at baseline 
for the analysis of non-inferiority versus comparator vaccine. The vaccine response should be defined 
as seroconversion of initially seronegative subjects or as a four-fold increase in antibody titer among 
initially seropositive subjects. 
•  Investigations of immunological aspects as persistence of antibodies, response to carrier protein and 
vaccination with conjugate vaccine following vaccination with plain polysaccharide, as described by 
WHO recommendations for MenA and Men C vaccines should be considered. 
For the clinical program in the 2 to 10 years of age population, the CHMP answers concerning the 
clinical questions confirmed that: 
•  The safety database was considered acceptable in accordance with the guideline on clinical 
evaluation of new vaccines 
•  A quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (i.e. Menomune) was not considered the best 
available comparator. Accordingly, a new study in children 2 to 10 years of age (V59P20, conducted in 
the United States and Canada) which compared Menveo to another quadrivalent meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine (Menactra) was included in the Menveo clinical development plan. The CHMP 
considered MenC conjugated vaccines as an adequate comparator for this age group. 
•  In line with the conjugated MenC experience vaccines in EU, it was expected to demonstrate that 
Menveo is superior to the meningococcal polysaccharide and that justification for using non-inferiority 
in V59P10 study should be provided. CHMP further noted that even a 10% difference in 
immunogenicity might not be acceptable (non-inferiority approach) as reduction in immunogenicity 
could affect the herd immunity and be clinically relevant. 
•  For the 2-5 years age group the duration of protection is at least as important as insight into the 
primary response. 
Subsequent to CHMP advice there were also a pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteur, co-
Rapporteur and EMA in March 2011 to discuss the clinical data prior to submission. The Rapporteur 
commented that while the proposed plan was suitable for an extension of the current indication to the 
2 to 10 years population there could be a limitation for a routine use recommendation due to the lack 
of head-to-head study versus a MenC vaccine.

The Clinical Overview and the individual study reports carry statements regarding compliance with GCP 
guidelines operative at the time that each study was conducted. Clinical trials outside EU were 
performed according to ethical standards of Directive 2001/29/EC.  
1.5.  Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Novartis Vaccines and 
Diagnostics S.r.l. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 8 August 2011 an application for a 
type II variation. 
The present type II application EMEA/H/C/1095/II/17 has the purpose to expand the age indication of 
Menveo, meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (diphtheria CRM197 conjugate) to include children 
from 2 to 10 years of age inclusive. 
The proposed indication is: 
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (2 years of age and above), 
adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, 
to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations 
The proposed posology is: 
In children (from 2 years of age and above), adolescents (from 11 years of age) and adults 
Menveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 ml). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/93/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/93/2011 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/93/2011. 
2.  Scientific overview and discussion 
2.1.  Quality aspects 
MenACWY as currently authorised is presented as a prefilled syringe or a vial (liquid solution of the 
MenCWY component) and vial (lyophilized powder of the MenA component).  
Presence of oily and translucent visible particles has been detected in the syringes and communicated 
to the EMA in February 2011. Analyses of these particles revealed that they are composed by silicone 
oil and proteins. Based on the provided information it was concluded that these particles had been 
present in the pre-filled syringe drug product all along, and from a pharmacological-toxicological point 
of view the presence of polydimethylsiloxane did not raise a serious concern, therefore it was judged 
that no immediate action needed to be taken. Further information about this aspect is provided in the

sub-section on ‘Translucent particles in the syringe/vial formulations procedure’ under the risk 
management plan section. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects  
Toxicological evaluations of process residual levels throughout the development of the manufacturing 
process for Menveo have played a role in the finalisation of specifications for drug substances and drug 
products. In 2005, prior to the finalisation of manufacturing specifications, the toxicological impact of 
the maximal theoretical amounts of each chemical residue per dose was described in a technical report 
(Toxicological evaluation of the acceptance criteria for the residues of chemicals in the drug substances 
of Meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine). 
Sixteen manufacturing residuals have been re-evaluated in the context of the 2-10 age group. 
Following standard toxicological practices, for each residual, the most conservative dose of compound 
associated with toxicity in a species (usually expressed on the basis of mg/kg of body weight) was 
selected as the starting point of the assessment. 
The toxicity values used for calculations of the maximal theoretical mounts of residuals per dose were 
obtained from the available toxicology literature and/or allowable limits set by guidelines or regulatory 
agencies. The safety multiples were calculated for a 7kg individual. The MAH concludes that the safety 
multiples are adequate to support the safety of an intramuscular injection of a 0.5 mL dose of the 
MenACWY. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has recalculated the limits for the impurities of 16 different chemicals that are used in 
manufacturing the Menveo product. The MAH has evaluated the maximum concentrations based on 
acceptance criteria, and has related this also to the possible dose to children at a weight of 7kg.  
The MAH did not discuss the possibility that the limits applied thus far for vaccines intended to be used 
in adults might not be applicable to the use in children. However, based on the levels of residuals, and 
the acceptable levels, the safety multiples remain in the order of > 50× and higher for most of the 
other compounds. Applying an additional arbitrary safety factor of 10 results in lower safety margins, 
but the margins are still acceptable. 
Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
From a toxicological viewpoint there is no objection to the limits proposed for residuals.

Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Dose-response studies  
The dose-response studies were submitted and assessed with the initial MAA. A short summary of the 
main findings is provided below. 
Studies V59P2, V59P4, V59P5, V59P7 
The selection of the MenACWY 10-5-5-5 dose was based on the results of study V59P2. This study 
planned to enrol 600 toddlers aged 12 to 16 months into one of six vaccination groups. Four groups 
received one injection of aluminium phosphate-adjuvanted MenACWY with the dose of each serogroup 
ranging from 2.5 μg to 10 μg. Based on preclinical data indicating the possibility of interference 
between the serogroup A antigen and the other serogroups, the study included a fifth group, which 
was administered MenCWY containing 10 μg of three serogroups C, W, and Y (MenCWY 10-10-10), 
while the control group was administered Menjugate. A subset received a second vaccination of the 
previously received dose.  There was no evidence of interference or reduction in immunogenicity of the 
ACWY10 vaccine against any of the four serogroups by reason of the presence of the A antigen. 
Study V59P4 planned to enrol 225 toddlers (aged 12 to 16 months) to evaluate the immunogenicity 
and safety of MenACWY 5-5-5-5 formulated with and without aluminium phosphate adjuvant and non-
adjuvanted MenACWY 10-10-10-10. In addition, a licensed polysaccharide meningococcal ACWY 
vaccine (Menomune) was administered to a planned group of 75 children aged 3 to 5 years as an 
immunogenicity comparator group. hSBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) were used in study V59P4 to 
assess the impact of the inclusion of the adjuvant. Baseline hSBA GMTs were very low or undetectable 
in all groups. One month after vaccination, no statistically significant (p> 0.05 in each pairwise test) 
difference in hSBA GMTs between the non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted groups was observed. Regarding 
the tolerability and safety, no noteworthy differences between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted 
MenACWY vaccine were seen. Both formulations were well tolerated. 
Additional phase 2 study V59P5 conducted in infants also supported the final dose composition of the 
MenACWY vaccine, and confirmed that the adjuvant was not required.

Study V59P7 planned to enrol 600 subjects: 400 children aged 12 to 35 months were to receive 
MenACWY 10-5-5-5 formulated with or without adjuvant and 200 subjects aged 36 to 59 months were 
to receive either non-adjuvanted MenACWY 10-5-5-5 or a meningococcal polysaccharide ACWY vaccine 
(Mencevax). All subjects were to receive a second vaccination of adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted 
MenACWY 10-5-5-5 at 1, 6, or 12 months after the first injection. Baseline hSBA GMTs were very low 
or undetectable in all groups. One month after vaccination no statistically significant difference in hSBA 
GMTs between the non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted groups was observed. Both MenACWY Ad+ and Ad- 
were well tolerated with a lower local reactogenicity profile compared to polysaccharide MenACWY. No 
unexpected unsolicited or otherwise clinically significant adverse events (AEs) related to the vaccines 
administered were reported in this study. No deaths occurred in the study. Further information on 
V59P7 is also provided under the section ‘supportive studies’. 
In conclusion, the final formulation contains 10-5-5-5 μg per oligosaccharide of N. meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y respectively, without an adjuvant. 
Main clinical studies 
V59P20 is a phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, multicenter study conducted in the US and Canada 
in children 2-10 years of age to compare the safety and immunogenicity of MenACWY with Menactra. 
Methods 
  Study Participants  
Healthy male and female subjects aged 2 – 10 years who were up to date with age-appropriate routine 
childhood vaccinations, available for all visits/calls and for whom informed consent was available were 
included. Children with previous or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis or who had a 
household contact/intimate exposure to an individual with proven N. meningitidis infection within 
60 days prior to enrollment, or who had previously been immunized with a meningococcal vaccine/ 
meningococcal antigens were excluded. 
  Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive one single 0.5 mL dose of MenACWY or one single 0.5 mL dose of 
Menactra (manufactured by Aventis Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA) (meningococcal A, C, Y, and W-135 
polysaccharides conjugated to approximately 48 μg of diphtheria toxoid protein carrier). 
  Objectives 
Primary Objectives

1 month after vaccination, when administered to healthy subjects 2 to 5 years of age or 6 to 
10 years of age. 
Safety Objectives 
 
To describe the safety profile of MenACWY and to compare the percentages of subjects in 
the MenACWY and Menactra vaccine groups when administered to healthy children 2 to 
10 years of age in terms of immediate hypersensitivity reactions (within 30 minutes) 
following vaccination, local and systemic reactions during days 1 – 7 after vaccination, 
adverse events during the time periods pre-defined, medically significant AEs for the 
duration of the study and serious adverse events (SAEs) for the duration of the study. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary variable was the percentage of subjects with seroresponse to vaccination in the per 
protocol population. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint was also evaluated for the Modified 
Intention-To-Treat (MITT) population.

Seroresponse is a composite endpoint defined as follows: 
If Baseline Titre is:  
Then Seroresponse is: 
Pre-vaccination titre < 1:4 
Post-vaccination titre ≥ 1:8 
Pre-vaccination titre ≥ 1:4 
Post-vaccination titre fourfold increase over baseline 
  Sample size 
The power for this study was based on the estimate of the percentage of subjects with seroresponse 
within each serogroup as observed in the previous V59P8 study in children ages 2-10 years. 
  Randomisation 
The randomisation was stratified by age with the following targets per age strata: children 2 to 5 years 
of age (n = 1700), and children 6 to 10 years of age (n = 1120). In the 2 to 5 years of age group, 
subjects were to be randomised in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive either two doses of MenACWY, one dose of 
MenACWY, or one dose of Menactra. The subjects 6 to 10 years of age were to be randomised in a 1:1 
ratio to receive a single dose of either MenACWY or Menactra. 
  Blinding (masking) 
The trial was designed as an observer-blind study except for those subjects in Group I who were 
administered two doses of MenACWY in an open-label fashion. 
  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Randomised population: The randomised population contained all subjects enrolled and randomised in 
the study. These were subjects who had a signed informed consent, were enrolled into the study and 
randomised. This population was used for the analysis of demographics and all subject listings. 
Exposed population: Subjects who actually received a study vaccination were included in the Exposed 
Population. Should there have been an error in administration where the actual vaccination that the 
subject received was different than the one to which they were randomly assigned, the subject was 
included in the vaccination group for the treatment received. 
Safety population: All subjects who received the study vaccination and had post-baseline safety data 
were included in the safety analysis. This population was used for the analysis of local and systemic 
reactions and other adverse events. As described for the Exposed population, subjects were included in 
the group for the vaccination actually received.  
Modified Intention-to-treat (MITT) population, Immunogenicity: The MITT population included all 
subjects who received a study vaccination and provided an evaluable serum sample both before and 
after vaccination. Should there have been an error in administration where the actual vaccination that 
the subject received was different than the one to which they were randomly assigned, the subject was 
included in the vaccination group for the treatment to which they were randomised (‘analysed as 
randomised’). The MITT population was summarized and used to evaluate only the primary endpoints.

EMA/332810/2012

Per protocol (PP) population, Immunogenicity: The PP population for immunogenicity analysis included 
all subjects in the MITT population who provided evaluable serum samples (titer results were available) 
both before and after vaccination and had no major protocol deviation, as defined prior to unblinding. 
This population was used to evaluate all the primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives. 
Analyses 
Within each age group, the 95% CIs for the difference in proportions (given serogroup for MenACWY – 
given serogroup for Menactra) was constructed using standard methods. Immunogenicity of MenACWY 
was considered non-inferior to the immunogenicity of Menactra, for each of the four serogroups, if the 
lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the groups 
(MenACWY group minus Menactra group) in the percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse for 
that serogroup was greater than -10%. Moreover, if the CI was entirely to the right of 0%, then 
superiority was declared. The combined hypothesis testing for non-inferiority and statistical superiority 
did not require any adjustment for multiplicity. 
Results 
  Participant flow  
A total of 2907 subjects from 67 study centers were enrolled and randomised (359 in the MenACWY 2-
dose group, 1278 in the MenACWY group and 1270 in the Menactra group), while 2898 subjects were 
vaccinated (356 in the MenACWY 2-dose group, 1279 received MenACWY and 1263 were administered 
Menactra).

  Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 13 March 2008, the last visit was completed on 14 October 2009. 
  Conduct of the study 
In total 646 subjects had protocol deviations during the conduct of the study (144 [40%] in the 
MenACWY 2-dose group, 258 [20%] in the MenACWY group and 244 [19%] in the Menactra group). 
The most common deviation among the major protocol deviation was “No post-vaccination blood draw” 
with 130 subjects (38 [11%] in the MenACWY 2-dose group, 44 [3%] in the MenACWY group and 
48 [4%] in the Menactra group), followed by “No pre-vaccination blood draw” with 60 subjects (6 [2%] 
in the MenACWY 2-dose group, 29 [2%] in the MenACWY group and 25 [2%] in the Menactra group), 
and “Post-vaccination blood draw out of window” with 37 subjects (7 [2%] in the MenACWY 2-dose 
group, 13 [1%] in the MenACWY group and 17 [1%] in the Menactra group). A total of 20 subjects 
were enrolled who did not satisfy the entry criteria. Twenty subjects received the wrong vaccine or an 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

incorrect dose. One additional subject was not vaccinated because of an entry criteria violation 
discovered post-randomisation. 
  Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics of the overall randomised population (2 to 10 years of 
age) were similar in the MenACWY 2-dose, MenACWY and Menactra groups (Table 2). The majority of 
the population was Caucasian. The ratios between males and females were similar across all the 
vaccine groups. Other baseline characteristics were well balanced between comparator groups (i.e 
MenACWY vs. Menactra in the 2-5 or 6-10 strata, or 2 doses of MenACWY vs. 1 dose among subjects 
2- 5 years of age).

  Outcomes and estimation 
MenACWY vs Menactra 
The primary objective of study V59P20, assessed 1 month after a single vaccination, was to compare 
the immunogenicity (% with seroresponse) of a single dose of MenACWY with the immunogenicity of a 
single dose of Menactra in healthy children aged 2 to 5 years (a) and aged 6 to 10 years (b). 
In children aged 2 to 5 years, the percentage of seroresponders at 1 month postvaccination was higher 
in the MenACWY group than in the Menactra group for serogroups C (60% vs. 56% for MenACWY and 
Menactra, respectively), W (72% vs. 58%), and Y (66% vs. 45%), but lower for serogroup A (72% vs. 
77%).  Non-inferiority criterion was met for serogroups C, W and Y but not for serogroup A. In children 
aged 6 to 10 years, the percentage of seroresponders was higher in the MenACWY group than in the 
Menactra group for serogroups C (63% vs. 57%), W (57% vs. 44%), and Y (58% vs. 39%), but lower 
for serogroup A (77% vs. 83%). The non-inferiority criterion was met for serogroups C, W and Y, but 
not for serogroup A. Statistical superiority of MenACWY over Menactra for serogroup W and Y was 
observed in both age groups. Results were similar in the MITT population. 
Table 4: Percentage of Subjects with hSBA Seroresponse at 1 Month Postvaccination (95% CI) by Age 
Group, PP Population 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012

As a secondary objective the seroresponse between the two vaccines was compared for the whole 
population combined (i.e. 2-10 years). Similarly as for the primary objective, the % seroresponders 
was higher in the MenACWY group as compared to the Menactra group for all serogroups except A. 
Non-inferiority in this case could be demonstrated for all serogroups. Similar results were observed for 
the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8.

Table 5: Secondary Immunogenicity Objective: Percentage of Subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 at Day 1 and 
Day 29, Children 2 to 5 and 6 to 10 years of age, PP Population 
For subjects aged 2-10 years, pre-vaccination GMTs were similar between the two vaccine arms. At 
day 29, the GMTs showed a large increase for all four serogroups in both vaccine groups but were 
consistently higher in the MenACWY group for serogroups C, W, and Y (C: 23 vs. 17 in the MenACWY 
and Menactra groups, respectively, W: 49 vs. 26, Y: 29 vs. 12) and were similar for serogroup A (A: 
30 vs. 29). MenACWY was non-inferior to Menactra for all four serogroups (see table 6 below).

Table 6: Secondary Immunogenicity Objective: hSBA GMTs at Day 1 and Day 29, Children 2 to 10 
Years of Age, PP Population 
For the 2-5 age group, as well as for the 6-10 age group and the combined ages, the reverse 
cumulative distribution curves for MenACWY and Menactra cross. Thus, although the percentage of 
subjects with an hSBA ≥ 1:8 post-vaccination did not meet the non-inferiority criteria when 
comparing MenACWY to Menactra, among those that did achieve positive titers, the titers were higher 
after MenACWY. This can be seen in the RCDF curves where the MenACWY group has a longer “tail” 
than Menactra (RCDC for serogroup A shown, for combined age groups).

2 doses vs 1 dose of MenACWY 
In children aged 2 to 5 years the seroresponse, % with hSBA ≥1:8 and GMT’s after 2 doses with 
MenACWY was compared with the seroresponse, % with hSBA ≥1:8 and GMT’s following a single dose 
(one month post vaccination). Results are presented in the following table: 
Table 7: Secondary Immunogenicity Objective: Percentage of Subjects with hSBA Titer≥1:8 and GMTs 
of Subjects at Day 1 and at One Month Post-Vaccination, Children 2 to 5 years of age (2 doses v/s 
1dose), PP Population 
The percentages of seroresponders was consistently higher in the MenACWY 2-dose group than in the 
MenACWY single dose group for all four serogroups (A 91% vs. 72%, C: 98% vs. 60%, W: 89% vs. 
72%, and Y: 95% vs. 66%). At one month post-vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA 
≥1:8 showed a large increase for all four serogroups in both vaccine groups but were consistently 
higher for all four serogroups in the MenACWY 2-dose group (A: 91% vs. 72%, C: 99% vs. 68%, W: 
99% vs. 90%, and Y: 98% vs. 76%). Similar results were observed for the percentage of subjects with 
hSBA≥1:4. At day 29, the GMTs showed a large increase for all four serogroups in both vaccine groups 
but were significantly higher for all four serogroups in MenACWY 2-dose group (A: 64 vs. 27, C: 144 
vs. 18, W: 132 vs. 41, and Y: 102 vs. 23).

Supportive study 
Study V59P7 
V59P7 was a phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, multicenter, active-controlled study conducted in 
Finland and Poland during 2005-2006 in children aged 1-5 years. A total of 623 subjects were enrolled 
and randomised into one of four vaccination groups according to their age. Toddlers aged 12-35 
months were randomised to MenACWY (N = 206) or MenACWY adjuvant-containing (Ad+) (N = 207), 
and children aged 36-59 months were randomised to MenACWY (N = 128) or Mencevax (N = 82). The 
toddlers then received a second vaccination at either 1, 6, or 12 months (6 groups total), while the 
children 36-59 months of age received a second vaccination at 6 or 12 months (4 groups total).  
For subjects aged 36 to less than 60 months the primary objective was to compare the functional 
immune response 28 days after administration of one dose of MenACWY with that of a plain MenACWY 
PS vaccine, as measured by the percentage of subjects with human complement serum bactericidal 
activity (hSBA) ≥1:4 against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. Secondary objectives were to 
compare the functional immune response 28 days after administration of one dose of MenACWY with 
that of a MenACWY PS vaccine (Mencevax), as measured by hSBA GMTs and hSBA ≥1:8 against 
N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  
In addition, the following secondary objectives were to be evaluated using hSBA GMTs and percentage 
of responders with hSBA titers ≥1:4 and ≥1:8: 
• The persistence of functional immune response at 6 or 12 months following administration of 
one dose of either MenACWY Ad- or MenACWY PS vaccine. 
• The booster effect 21 days after one dose of MenACWY Ad- vaccine administered 6 or 12 
months after the first dose of either MenACWY Ad- or MenACWY PS vaccine. 
For subjects aged 12 to 35 months the following secondary objectives were to be evaluated using 
hSBA GMTs and percentage of responders with hSBA titers ≥1:4 and ≥1:8: 
• The functional immune response 28 days after administration of one dose of either MenACWY 
Ad+ or MenACWY Ad-. 
• The functional immune response 21 days after a second dose of either MenACWY Ad+ or 
MenACWY Ad- Ad- administered 1 month after the first dose. 
• The persistence of functional immune response at 6 or 12 months following administration of 
one dose of either MenACWY Ad+ or MenACWY Ad-. 
• The persistence of functional immune response at 12 months following administration of two 
doses of either MenACWY Ad+ or MenACWY Ad-. 
• The booster effect 21 days after a second dose of either MenACWY Ad+ or MenACWY Ad- 
administered at 6 or 12 months after the first dose. 
The primary results for children 3-5 years of age are presented in table 8. Secondary endpoints are 
presented in tables 8 and 9.

Table 8: Percentage of Subjects (95% CI) 36 to 59 Months Old with hSBA Titer ≥ 1:4 for A, C, W, and 
Y Serogroups 
The results using the hSBA titer ≥1:8 were similar to % with hSBA titer ≥ 1:4. The percentage of 
subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 was higher in the MenACWY Ad- group than in the MenACWY PS group 
for all serogroups (54% to 84% for MenACWY Ad-and 39% to 59% for MenACWY PS for the different 
serogroups). At 28 days after vaccination the GMTs increased in both groups, but elevations in GMT for 
serogroups A, W, and Y were more pronounced in the MenACWY Ad- group (GMR between 7.11 and 
8.75 for MenACWY Ad- and 3.37 and 5.84 for MenACWY PS), whereas no relevant difference was 
observed for serogroup C.

Persistence and Booster effect 
The group of children aged 36 to 59 months was divided into two subgroups. One subgroup received a 
second vaccination (always MenACWY Ad-) at 6 months after the first vaccination with either 
MenACWY or MenACWY PS; the other subgroup received the second vaccination at 12 months after the 
first vaccination. Prior to the second vaccination, the hSBA titer was determined and GMT was 
calculated.  
The functional immune response at 6 and 12 months after the first vaccination waned markedly for 
serogroup A, was maintained for serogroups W and Y, and was only moderately lower for serogroup C 
(see tables 9 and 10).  
GMTs showed no remarkable differences between 6 and 12 months after vaccination: at 6 months after 
vaccination GMT for serogroup A was only slightly higher than baseline. For serogroup C GMT was 
slightly lower than at 28 days after vaccination (day 29: 7.91 and 6.31, respectively and 5.06 and 4.3 
at 6 and 12 months after vaccination). GMRs for serogroup W showed no relevant changes over time, 
GMR for serogroup Y slightly decreased compared to day 29, but the decrease was similar at 6 and 
12 months. 
Independent of the time period between the first and second vaccination the percentage of subjects 
with an hSBA titer ≥1:4 was 100% for serogroups C, W, and Y at 21 days after the second vaccination. 
For serogroup A the percentages of subjects were 92% (second vaccination after 6 months) and 98% 
(second vaccination after 12 months). Similar results were obtained when using the hSBA titer ≥1:8. 
For all serogroups, GMT was about 3- to 4-fold higher in the subgroup of children who received the 
second vaccination 12 months after the first vaccination compared to children who received the second 
vaccination at 6 months. 
Study V59P8 
Study V59P8 is a phase 2, randomised, single-blind, controlled, single-center study to compare the 
safety and immunogenicity of One Dose of MenACWY with one dose of plain PS MenACWY vaccine 
(Menomune) in healthy children 2-10 years of age, in addition to an open-label study to assess the 
safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of MenACWY in healthy toddlers (12-23 months).  
The primary objective was to compare the immunogenicity of a single dose of MenACWY with the 
immunogenicity of a single dose of licensed meningococcal ACWY polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune), 
defined as percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity (i.e., hSBA ≥ 1:4) directed against 
N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, at 1 month after vaccination, when administered to 
healthy children 2 to 10 years of age.  
Secondary objectives included: Comparing the hSBA GMT’s at 1 month following a single dose, 
comparing the immune response for 2-5 years old and 6-10 years old children separately, comparing 
persistence at the 12 months after a single dose of MenACWY in toddlers between 12 and 23 months of 
age with that of a PS MenACWY vaccine in children aged 3 to 5 years, and finally to compare the 
immunogenicity of a single dose of MenACWY and the  immunogenicity of a single dose of licensed 
meningococcal ACWY polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune), defined as: percentage of subjects with 
serum bactericidal activity (i.e., hSBA ≥ 1:4) and hSBA GMT antibody response directed against 
N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y at 12 months after vaccination, when administered to 
healthy children 2 to 10 years of age, overall and within the following age groups: 2 to 5 years of age 
and 6 to 10 years of age. 
The primary response (% hSBA≥1:4) is presented in the following table:

Table 11b: Percentage of Responders in Subjects Aged 2 to 10 Years (hSBA Titers ≥ 1:8) at One and 
12 Months after Vaccination 
Both MenACWY and Menomune exhibited increased bactericidal activity at 1 month after vaccination 
(percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4) relative to baseline for each serogroup, but the 
percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 1:4 was higher in the MenACWY group than in the 
Menomune group (81% to 94% for MenACWY and 44% to 72% for Menomune). The differences 
between MenACWY and Menomune groups were 37%, 19%, 23%, and 31% for the serogroups A, C, 
W, and Y, respectively. The lower limits of the 95% CIs for the differences at 1 month after vaccination 
were greater than 0% against all four serogroups, indicating statistical superiority of MenACWY over 
Menomune. Similarly, the differences in GMTs between the vaccine groups were statistically significant 
for all four serogroups (P < 0.001, see table 12). Results were similar when considering children aged 
2-5 years and 6-10 years separately (exception, the response to serogroup C in 6-10 year olds which 
was similar for the two vaccines).

Table 12: Secondary Immunogenicity Variable: Geometric Mean hSBA Titers in Subjects Aged 2 to 10 
Years at One Month After Vaccination 
Persistence 
Twelve months after vaccination, the number of responders (subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:4) decreased 
compared to 1-month data in both vaccine groups for all serogroups, and the number of responders 
was statistically significantly higher in the MenACWY group than in the Menomune group (the lower 
limit of all 95% CI for the difference between the two vaccine groups were greater than 0%). The 
decrease was most pronounced for serogroup A (from 82% to 28% responders at 1 and 12 months 
after MenACWY, and from 45% to 18% responders after vaccination with Menomune). Similar 
responder rates were observed at 1 and 12 months after vaccination for serogroups W and Y after 
MenACWY vaccination, but not after Menomune vaccination (for serogroup W, the responder rate 
decreased from 71% to 50% and for serogroup Y from 61% to 38%). The comparisons between 
MenACWY and Menomune always resulted in a lower limit of the 95% CIs that was greater than 0%, 
indicating superiority of MenACWY over Menomune. The corresponding GMT values showed a similar 
pattern, GMT values were higher after MenACWY than after Menomune at 12 months after vaccination 
(except for serogroup C)

Study V59P10 
Study V59P10 is a phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, controlled, multi-center study to compare the 
safety of one dose of MenACWY conjugate vaccine with that of a licensed MenACWY plain PS vaccine 
(Menomune) administered to healthy children 2-10 years of age. The primary objective was to 
compare the immunogenicity of a single injection of MenACWY conjugate vaccine with the 
immunogenicity of a single injection of Menomune, defined as the percentage of subjects with 
seroresponse in human serum bactericidal assay against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y at 1 
month after vaccination. Seroresponse was defined as in study V59P20. 
In children 2-10 years of age, the percentages of subjects with seroresponse at one month post-
vaccination was statistically superior in the MenACWY group than in the Menomune group for all four 
serogroups:

Table 14: Percentage (95%CI) of Subjects with Seroresponse by Baseline Titer, 1 Month Post-
vaccination, Study V59P10, PP Population 
In children 2-10 years of age, GMTs at baseline were similar between the vaccine groups with no 
statistically significant differences for any serogroup. At one month post-vaccination, GMTs were 
statistically significantly higher in the MenACWY group than in the Menomune group for all four 
serogroups (A: 65 vs 11; vaccine group ratio of 5.86; 95% CI: [4.19, 8.19]) (C: 42 vs 20; vaccine 
group ratio of 2.08; 95% CI: [1.44, 3.01]) (W: 72 vs 20; vaccine group ratio of 3.58; 95% CI: [2.56, 
5]) (Y: 47 vs 25; vaccine group ratio of 1.86; 95% CI: [1.24, 2.79]) 
Results for both age subgroups (2-5, 6-10 years) patterned similarly to the 2-10 years of age group, 
however for serogroups W and Y statistical superiority was not demonstrated in the 6-10 age group for 
all immunogenicity endpoints.  
Persistence 
In the overall population (2 to 10 years of age), the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 at 
day 181 decreased compared with those observed at day 29 for all serogroups in both vaccine groups 
except serogroup Y in the MenACWY group

Table 16: Secondary Immunogenicity Objective: Percentage of Subjects with hSBA Titer ≥ 1:8 (95%

No clear age-dependent pattern was identified in the by age analysis of the percentages of subjects 
with hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 observed at day 181 vs. day 29. In the MenACWY group, for serogroups A, C, 
and W, a lower extent of decay was observed in the 6 to 10 compared to the 2 to 5 years age group. 
For serogroup Y in the MenACWY group, comparable percentages were seen for both age cohorts at

day 181 vs. day 29. As in the MenACWY group, in the Menomune group also, for serogroup A, lower 
extent of decay was observed in the older age group; conversely, for serogroups C, W, and Y in the 
Menomune group, a lower extent of decay was observed in the 2 to 5 years than in the 6 to 10 years 
age group. In both age cohorts, for serogroups C, W, and Y, the percentages of subjects with hSBA 
titer ≥1:8 at day 181 were consistently higher in the MenACWY than in the Menomune group. For 
serogroup A, the percentages were comparable in the MenACWY and Menomune groups although the 
decay was greater in the MenACWY group. 
The results observed when a less conservative threshold, i.e., hSBA titer ≥ 1:4, was used, were 
generally similar to those observed in the analysis of the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥1:8 
In the overall population (2 to 10 years of age), the hSBA GMTs at day 181 decreased compared with 
those observed at day 29 for all serogroups in both vaccine groups (Table 17 below). In the MenACWY 
group, the extent of decay was lowest for serogroups W and Y and highest for serogroup A. For 
serogroups C, W, and Y, the hSBA GMTs at day 181 were consistently higher in the MenACWY than in 
the Menomune group (serogroup C: 22 vs. 11; serogroup W: 69 vs. 16; serogroup Y: 39 vs. 14), with 
p-values providing evidence of statistically significant difference between the two vaccines groups. The 
GMTs observed for serogroup A were similar between the two vaccine groups (5.06 vs. 5.85, 
respectively).

2 doses vs 1 dose of MenACWY 
Further to the CHMP request to provide further justification to support the recommendation of a single 
dose in children aged 2-5 years, as well as in the age group 6 to 10 years, the MAH provided an

overview of the data generated in the following three supportive clinical studies in which MenACWY 
was compared to a meningococcal polysaccharide (MPS) vaccine: V59P7, V59P8 and V59P10.  
The point estimates of the seroresponse to each of the serogroups in each of the studies in a variety of 
population groups (European, US, Latin American) was always higher after MenACWY in comparison to 
the MPS vaccine, in most instances by a wide margin (Table 18). 
Table 18: Seroresponse rate (hSBA) in phase II and early phase III studies in 2-5 years old subjects 
The MAH noted that, although the limitations of MPS vaccines are well documented (e.g., limited 
immunogenicity in ages < 2 years, lack of induction of immune memory, hyporesponsiveness with 
repeat dosing, etc.), there is good evidence that they are safe, well-tolerated and efficacious vaccines, 
including in children aged 2 to 10 years. The measured vaccine efficacy in the literature of MPS 
vaccines supported the conclusion that a single dose is a reasonable dosing regimen for this age group, 
both with data derived from the Meningitis belt in Africa and in other settings.  
The MAH provided data from a subset of sera tested using the rabbit SBA from children aged 2-
10 years from study V59P20. The results of these analyses showed that the percentage of subjects 
achieving a four-fold rise in rSBA against all 4 serogroups ranged from 93-99% for 2 to 5 year olds and 
93- 96% for 6 to 10 year olds (table 19).

Persistence of bactericidal antibodies 
The MAH provided a comparison of the decline in antibody titres between MenACWY and MPS across 
studies. The percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 or achieving a seroresponse 1 month after 
vaccination is higher in those vaccinated with MenACWY than in those vaccinated with a meningococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine (MPS) across different MAH studies across all serogroups. At 6 or 12 months 
after vaccination, the point estimates of the percentages of subjects that maintained an hSBA ≥ 1:8 
were also higher for all serogroups in both studies except for serogroup A in study V59P10 where the 
results were similar at the 6 month post-vaccination time point (Table 20). Although the 1 month post-
vaccination time point has a higher percentage of subjects with an hSBA ≥ 1:8 for serogroup C in the 
US study (V59P8) after MenACWY (73% (95% CI 68-79%)) than after MenPS (55% (95% CI 49-
62%)), the relative decline appears larger at 1 years post vaccination in the MenACWY group (53% 
(47-59%) vs. 44% (38-51%) after MenACWY vs. MenPS, respectively). This was not observed in the 
similar study conducted in Argentina (V59P10) where the opposite was observed: the percentage of 
subject with hSBA ≥ 1:8 in the MenACWY group dropped by 7% (from 88% to 81%) and the MPS 
group dropped by 15% (from 70% to 55%) during the follow-up period. 
In study V59P6E1, 76% (95% CI 62-87%) of adolescents vaccinated five years previously with 
MenACWY maintained an hSBA ≥ 1:8 (versus 62% (95% CI 47-75%) of MenPS recipients). This 
represents a rather flat curve over time as among those same subjects vaccinated with MenACWY 
originally, 84% (95% CI 71-93%) had an hSBA ≥ 1:8 at one month post-vaccination. 
Table 20: Percentage (95%CI) of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8, 6 or 12 months post-vaccination, 2-10 
years of age, studies V59P8 and V59P10, PP population 
Regarding serogroup A, a poor persistence of hSBA titers for serogroup A after vaccination is observed 
where evaluated in both study V59P8 (hSBA ≥ 1:8 of 23% (95% CI 18-29%) at 1 year post-
vaccination) and in study V59P10 (hSBA ≥ 1:8 of 35% (95% CI 27-44%) at 6 months post-
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

vaccination). These trends are similar to those observed in other age groups for serogroup A when 
using the hSBA including infants prior to the 12 month booster vaccination and in adolescents after a 
single dose of meningococcal vaccine. Based on the hSBA results in adults and adolescents (study 
V59P13E1), the antibodies against MenA have decreased significantly at 21 months post primary 
series, with only 37% with hSBA ≥ 1:8. At 21 months 38% (32-44%, N=275) have a hSBA ≥ 1:4.  
Although no persistence data with rSBA has been generated in the 2 to 10 year old age group, the 
MAH presented results from adolescents. The percentage of subjects with an rSBA ≥ 1:8 against 
serogroup A was 96% at 5 years after vaccination, rSBA GMTs also remained very high at 952 among 
the per protocol population (n=48). 
Observed variability in immune response across studies 
The MAH provided an analysis of the observed variability in immune responses (Table 21) to 
vaccination after MenACWY across studies in different populations/regions and age groups. The 
following aspects were considered: intrinsic host (e.g., genetic-, age-related) differences, 
environmental (e.g., priming-, exposure-related) differences or assay-related differences. 
Table 21: Ranges of GMTs (hSBA) across different age groups in MenACWY program 
Intrinsic (host) factors 
Differences across age groups in immune responses are not unexpected, as maturing immune systems 
and/or age-dependent exposures to immunologic priming events are well described and seen above in 
Table 21. These underlying differences are the rationale for varied dosing regimens required in the 
different age groups. Within the MenACWY program, there were moderate differences in mean age at 
vaccination which may also contribute to some of the differences within each age strata. In particular, 
in study V59P7 where there has been increased attention to the overall lower response rates across all 
vaccine groups, the mean age of MenACWY recipients was 2.7 years versus a range of 3.3 – 3.6 years 
in MenACWY recipients in studies V59P8, V59P10 and V59P20. Since age-related improvements in 
immune responses are marked in this age range, this may be a significant factor that contributes to 
differences between studies. 
Environmental factors 
Geographic differences in the immune responses to certain vaccines is not a new observation and has 
been reported after polio, Hib as well as pneumococcal vaccination. There are a number of possible 
explanations as to the differences in vaccine responses. Some environmental factors such as previous 
vaccination with DTPw- versus DTPa combination vaccines or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may 
play a role. It is difficult though in the case of MenACWY to reconcile that 2-5 year olds in the highest 
responder country (Argentina) and the lowest responder country (Finland) were both recipients of 
DTPw-containing priming vaccines. More likely the differences are related to other colonies/infecting 
bacteria in the local environment. The timing and the colonization with different types of Neisseria 
species is associated with certain age groups. These have been studied in a limited set of geographies 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 35/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
so differences might exist in this pattern across countries. In infants up to 2 years of age colonization 
with N. lactamica is significant while in adolescents there is a transition to higher rates of carriage with 
N. meningitidis. Antibodies that are cross-reactive against meningococci are present in infants after 
carriage of N. lactamica. Colonization of infants starts with the waning of maternal antibodies and 
continues in the early childhood (Gold R. et al, 1978; Bennett JS et al., 2005). Thus, differences in pre-
titers in older age groups (i.e., maternal antibodies) may translate into a different dynamic of carriage 
during early infancy and thus affect subsequent responses to meningococcal vaccination.  
MenACWY experience with intrinsic and environmental factors  
It is difficult to separate out intrinsic factors from environmental factors due to genetic differences 
since both can be related to the countries or regions in which the studies are conducted. In several age 
groups in the MenACWY program there were at least two studies conducted in the same region, it is 
thus possible to examine the cumulative effects of these factors by comparing across studies. For 
MenACWY responses, when studying the same age groups within the same regions/countries, this 
variability was greatly decreased as seen in Table 22. In each of the study pairings shown in Table 22, 
one study was conducted during phase 2 and the other during phase 3 and all were conducted in North 
America. Studies were conducted (and assays run) between 2 and 4 years apart for each comparison; 
nonetheless, the percentage of subjects with an hSBA ≥ 1:8 was quite similar between the groups. 
Table 22: Within US/Canada analyses, percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 by age group, PP 
population 
A more prominent example from the MAH MenACWY program where between country differences were 
observed was in study V59P7. This study was conducted in both Finland and Poland with a slight 
majority of subjects enrolled in Finland. All serologic testing was performed simultaneously in the same 
lab for the same study visits. Obvious differences in vaccine responses between subjects from Finland 
and Poland were observed (Figure 5). The subjects from Finland had both lower pre- and post-
vaccination hSBA titers compared to subjects from Poland. In particular, the difference between Finnish 
and Polish children was most obvious in the percentage of children aged 36-59 months with hSBA ≥ 
1:8 after MenACWY against serogroup C, where Finnish children went from 2% (95% CI 0-12%) to 
30% (95% CI 18-46%) whereas Polish children went from 8% (95% CI 2-18%) to 74% (95% CI 60-
85%). The pattern was the same for the MPS comparator group with higher responses in Poland than 
in Finland (although in both countries, responses to MenACWY were higher than MPS). There were 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

Page 36/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar observations for serogroups W and Y with higher responses in Polish versus Finnish subjects, 
although the confidence intervals were overlapping for some of the comparisons.

subjects aged 36-59 months 
hSBA assay 
All studies included in the submissions were tested with the MenACWY-hSBA in Germany with no 
changes introduced since its validation in 2005. Although meticulous efforts were maintained to 
minimize any between study differences, by necessity for each study certain test conditions were 
different. These may include different complement- and media-lots, number of technicians testing per 
study, speed of testing, etc. In order to monitor and control the performance of the assay over time, 
for each serogroup tested a set of 3 control sera is included in the assay: a high, low and negative 
control sera. The results of both the high and low control sera must fall within a pre-specified range 
and the negative control must have a titer of < 4. For each high and low control sera, control charts 
are maintained over time to detect shifts or drifts in the assay over time. 
Within each serogroup the results seen for control sera were within the expected variability of the 
assay. As control sera is of limited volume, on occasion a change in the control sera is necessary so 
that all studies could not be tested using the same set of controls. An evaluation of the assay controls 
for the MenACWY-hSBA was conducted retrospectively for the time period 2005 to 2009 and for the 
year 2010. Slight differences in the performance of the assay could be detected through continuous 
monitoring of the control sera. However, differences seen between studies were within the expected 
variability of the serum bactericidal assay. Over time, the values for the control sera did vary in both 
directions and were not indicative of a general trend toward either higher or lower values within or 
across studies. Thus, although theoretical differences in assay characteristics cannot be ruled out, the 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012

controls included in each assay which are present across studies are critical to minimizing any 
meaningful inter-study differences. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the CHMP scientific advice pertaining to the submission the MAH was urged to include a comparative 
study with a monovalent conjugated MenC vaccine, as this was considered the most relevant 
comparator available in the EU. Polysaccharide vaccines are licensed in some countries for children 
from 2 years of age, and therefore for serogroups A, W, Y these are considered relevant as 
comparators. For MenC, the conjugated MenC vaccine is the more relevant comparator. The MAH has 
chosen to design a comparative study with Menactra, a diphtheria toxoid conjugated MenACWY vaccine 
(V59P20). This forms the pivotal trial for this present variation application. Since Menactra is not 
licensed in the EU, the comparison is informative but holds little direct relevance. Nonetheless, studies 
V59P7, V59P8 and V59P10 provide additional insight in the comparative immunogenicity versus 
polysaccharide vaccines and, which is considered just as important, insight in the persistence of 
bactericidal antibodies and the boosterability of MenACWY in this age group. 
The indication proposed for this age group is only those who are at increased risk of exposure. The 
epidemiology of meningococcal infection and the MenC vaccination programmes across different EU 
countries (all in children <2 years) result to no or little risk of disease due to MenA, C, W, Y for this 
age group, although noted that MenY is on the increase in some countries. As such, this vaccine is 
likely to be reserved for children travelling to areas where they would be at risk of exposure to MenA, 
W or Y or possibly to be used in case of an outbreak. As such it is agreed with the MAH that a head-to-
head comparison with a monovalent conjugated MenC vaccine is less relevant for the current 
indication. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
  MenACWY versus Menactra 
The overall response to MenACWY in study V59P20 was moderate: in children aged 2 to 5 years, the 
percentage of seroresponders at 1 month postvaccination was 72%, 60%, 72% and 66% for 
serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. In children aged 6 to 10 years, the percentage of 
seroresponders was 77%, 63%, 57% and 58% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. The low 
response appears mostly driven by a low response in those with baseline hSBA≥1:4, in which the 
response is clearly less than in those without baseline antibodies (especially for serogroups W and Y). 
This was also observed in the studies in children, adolescents and adults aged 11 and older submitted 
at the time of the initial MAA. The MAH demonstrated at the time that there was no evidence of 
hyporesponsiveness, which is the main concern with such an observation. There is momentarily 
sufficient evidence demonstrating the boosterability of MenACWY therefore hyporesponsiveness is of 
no concern. Importantly, for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively 75%, 72%, 90% and 77% of 
children aged 2-10 years achieve hSBA≥1:8 following vaccination regardless of baseline titres.  
  MenACWY versus Polysaccharide vaccine 
Study V59P7 provides relevant insight in the comparison with a plain polysaccharide tetravalent 
vaccine. Overall, as expected, the response is higher with MenACWY as compared to the response to a 
plain PS MenACWY vaccine. However, the GMT for serogroup C are very similar, and the point estimate 
is numerically higher for the PS vaccine (which is not in line with the %hSBA ≥1:4, 1:8).  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 38/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unlike study V59P7, statistical superiority of MenACWY over a plain polysaccharide tetravalent vaccine 
(Menomune) was demonstrated in study V59P8. The response to MenC is also somewhat higher in this 
study than what was seen in study V59P7, and the GMTs are higher in the MenACWY group than the 
Menomune group.  
In relation to study V59P10, the CHMP had indicated in a scientific advice that a non-inferiority 
approach in this study was not supported. In line with the experience with conjugated MenC vaccines 
in the EU the MAH was expected to demonstrate superiority to meningococcal PS vaccines. Although 
superiority was not demonstrated for each immunogenicity endpoint for serogroups W and Y, overall 
the response to MenACWY appears higher than the response to Menomune.  
  2 doses versus 1 dose of MenACWY 
The available data points out that the hSBA response following one dose in children aged 2-6 years can 
be increased with a second dose. Nonetheless, the MAH correctly point out that this response following 
one dose is clearly at least as good as the response following plain polysaccharide vaccines, to which 
MenACWY was compared. As the benefit of one dose with these vaccines has been shown, one dose of 
Menveo in this age group can also be considered adequate, especially considering the added benefit of 
the conjugated vaccine eliciting a T-cell dependent response. It should be noted however that the main 
reason for limiting the dosage of plain polysaccharide vaccines to one dose only was to avoid 
hyporesponsiveness and not necessarily that the response after one dose was optimal. 
The MAH mentions that the hSBA is conservative and that it may underestimate vaccine efficacy, the 
validity of these arguments are difficult to assess. While it may be agreed that hSBA generally gives a 
conservative estimate for protection it is impossible to quantify how and whether this is in all 
epidemiological situations, for all serogroups, for all age groups etc. There is no clear evidence to 
indicate that the rSBA data are more predictive of vaccine efficacy than the hSBA, and it is becoming 
increasingly clear that there is no good correlation between the two assays for all serogroups under all 
circumstances. This was also found in a study sponsored by the MAH (Gill et al, 2011, Vaccine 30; 29– 
34) where correlations between hSBA and rSBA were weak for serogroups A, W-135 and Y (Pearsson 
correlation: range −0.15 to 0.57), and better for serogroup C (0.46 to 0.78). 
Nonetheless, there are clear indications of an additional benefit of a second dose in children aged 2 to 
5 years that possibly outweigh the additional risks associated with a second dose. The MAH is planning 
a study (Study V59_57) to compare one versus two doses in children aged 2 to 10 years. The study 
shall provide additional information about the safety and immunogenicity and persistence of 
bactericidal antibodies following two doses as compared to one dose. These results are needed to 
determine the added benefits of a second dose versus the increased risks. The MAH will submit the 
results of this study as soon as they are available.  
 
Persistence data 
Persistence of bactericidal antibodies against serogroup A in study V59P7 is extremely poor as seen in 
previous studies in children >11 years and adults. For serogroup C a marked decrease in bactericidal 
antibodies after already 6 months is also observed. Although a good booster response is seen, the 
actual presence of bactericidal antibodies is considered more important for protection against invasive 
disease.  
In study V59P8, problems with persistence of antibodies against serogroup A are also observed, and to 
a lesser degree with MenC. Of note, persistence of bactericidal antibodies is improved with the 
conjugated MenACWY vaccine compared to the plain PS vaccine, except for MenC where the decrease 
of bactericidal antibodies might be larger than in the Menomune group. As regards to persistence data 
from study V59P10, the response rate for MenACWY was remarkably higher in this study than what 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 39/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
was seen in V59P20, but also phase II studies V59P7 and V59P8. The observation of the relative larger 
decline in bactericidal Abs for serogroup C in the MenACWY arm as compared to the PS arm in V59P8 is 
not observed in study V59P10, where a comparison with the same PS vaccine was made albeit over a 
shorter period (6 months rather than 12 months). 
In 2 to 10 years old, there currently is no long-term follow-up (> 1 year) and all data has been 
generated using the hSBA. The MAH has plans to follow-up the subjects from the larger phase 3 study 
V59P20 at a five year time point and this data will be available in 2013 from the extension study, 
V59P20E1. The data from study V59P20E1 will be important to determine whether immunogenicity can 
be maintained for all serogroups over time and to help determine when the optimal timing of a booster 
dose would be.  
The decline in antibodies against serogroups A is of particular concern. Considering the data presented 
so far, not only for children aged 2-10 years but also adolescents/adults, it appears that a booster 
dose is needed to maintain bactericidal Ab for serogroup A when relying on the hSBA data. However, 
this is not confirmed by the rSBA results in adolescents, where concerns exist on the reliability of the 
results for MenA. Considering the importance of this serogroup for travellers, it should be advised that 
children who are at (renewed) risk of exposure should receive a booster dose. If the timing were based 
upon the hSBA results from study V59P10, it would be after 6 months, as in study V59P10 31% of 
children aged 2-5 years and 45% of children aged 6-10 years had hSBA ≥ 1:4 six months following 
vaccination. However to determine the appropriate timing the value of the hSBA relative to the rSBA 
results for MenA (persistence) data should be clarified. In the meantime, a warning has been included 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC that there is a steep decline in antibodies and as such a booster dose 
should be considered for persons who remain at risk of exposure to MenA. In section 4.2, a cross 
reference to sections 4.4 and 5.1 has also been added following the statement “The need for, and 
timing of, a booster dose of Menveo has not yet been determined.” In addition, the MAH is 
recommended to make a recommendation on the need and timing for a booster dose once relevant 
data are available. The MAH is reminded of its responsibility to update the product information in 
accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
  Variability in immune response across studies 
The MAH has provided a detailed discussion of possible explanations for the observed variability. The 
use of a central laboratory and of control sera in the assay rule out that the variation observed is due 
to variation in the assay. Furthermore, the presentation (vial/vial versus vial/syringe) was found not to 
be contributing significantly to the observed variation. The MAH also clarified that in phase II studies 
mostly the vial/vial presentation was used and the vial/syringe presentation was used in phase III 
study V59P20. Other factors as discussed by the MAH could possibly provide an explanation, however 
it is agreed that it is difficult to single out what is causing the variation, as it also could be a 
combination of factors. It is important to keep in mind that if the rSBA were used responses would 
likely be higher, as this is inherent to the rSBA. The hSBA is more discriminative in this respect. Data 
from study V59P7 are considered important information for the healthcare provider since they reflect 
the performance of Menveo under a certain set of circumstances, and thus have been included in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
  Concomitant administration 
No data on Co-administration of MenACWY with other vaccines has been provided for the 2-10 year 
age group. Co-administration of MenACWY with travellers vaccines (Japanese encephalitis, Typhoid, 
Yellow fever, HepA, HepB and Rabies) is currently being evaluated in two studies in adults. The MAH 
will provide results of these studies in a timely manner after completion.

Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Two phase II studies and two phase III studies were submitted in context of this type II variation 
application. All studies were in children aged 2-10 years, except V59P7 where the subjects were 2-
5 years old, and took place in different countries across the world.  Comparisons were made with 
licensed plain polysaccharide MenACWY vaccines (Mencevax, Menomune) licensed in the EU and with a 
diphtheria toxoid conjugated MenACWY vaccine (Menactra) licensed outside the EU only. The different 
studies provided data following a single dose and limited data following two doses (in the age group 2-
5 years).  
As the immune responses after a single dose of MenACWY is generally higher than following the 
licensed comparator polysaccharide vaccines in different studies, and as MenACWY induces a T-cell 
dependent immune response, although with some increased reactogenicity as compared to comparator 
vaccines, the overall Benefit Risk of one dose of MenACWY in children aged 2-10 years who are at 
increased risk of exposure to serogroup A, C, W-135 or Y is positive. 
Data is available on persistence of antibodies up to 12 months and booster response after 6 and 
12 months. Across all studies that measure persistence, persistence for serogroup A is poor.  
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The integrated summary of clinical safety in children aged 2 to 10 years includes clinical data for 
3181 children from three phase II studies, V59P7, V59P8, and V59P10, and one phase III study 
(V59P20). The safety populations in each study are presented in table 23.

Table 24: Overview of Reactogenicity: Percentages of Children Reporting Solicited AEs (Local and 
Systemic Reactions), by Age, by Vaccination, Pooled Analysis 
In the overall 2 to 10 years age group, the percentage of subjects reporting any sign of reactogenicity 
was lowest after Menomune (49%). This was observed both for local and systemic reactions. The 
percentages of subjects reporting any sign of reactogenicity were slightly lower after MenACWY than 
after Menactra (56% vs. 61%). This tendency was observed for local reactions, while similar 
percentages of MenACWY and Menactra recipients reported systemic reactions. 
When two doses of meningococcal vaccine were administered in the 2 to 5 years age group, somewhat 
higher percentages reported any sign of reactogenicity after two doses of MenACWY than after 
Mencevax followed by MenACWY (49% vs. 43%). This was largely accounted for by a higher 
percentage of subjects reporting systemic reactions after two doses of MenACWY than after Mencevax 
followed by MenACWY (27% vs. 14%), while the reporting rates for local reactions were similar in the 
two vaccine groups. 
Local reactogenicity 
The pooled analysis of solicited local reactions after the first/single meningococcal vaccination in the 
overall 2 to 10 years age group was performed in 3107 MenACWY subjects (studies V59P7, V59P8, 
V59P10, and V59P20), 1255 Menactra subjects (study V59P20), and 861 Menomune subjects (studies 
V59P8 and V59P10). 
During the 7-day reporting period following the first/single meningococcal vaccination, in the overall 
2 to 10 years age population, pain was the most commonly reported local reaction. Pain of any 
severity was reported by similar percentages after MenACWY and Menomune (31% and 28%, 
respectively), while the reporting rates observed for Menactra were higher (40%). Reports of severe 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

pain were similar and low in all vaccine groups (range, <1% to 1%).  Erythema and induration (any 
and severe [i.e., > 50mm]) were reported by similar percentages after MenACWY and Menactra and by 
considerably lower percentages after Menomune. 
Table 25:  Percentages of Children Ages 2 to 10 Reporting Any and (Severe) Local Reactions after 
First/Single Meningococcal Vaccination, Days 1 to 7 and 1 to 3, Pooled Analysis 
Across the vaccine groups, in the majority of subjects, local solicited reactions (any and severe) 
occurred within the first 3 days postvaccination: no more than a 1% difference in the percentages 
reporting local reactions of any severity was observed for days 1 to 7 vs. days 1 to 3; the respective 
percentages for severe local reactions were the same for days 1 to 7 and 1 to 3. Overall, the majority 
of local reactions reported following the first/single vaccination with MenACWY were mild to moderate 
in severity and transient in duration. 
Systemic reactogenicity 
During the 7-day reporting period following the first/single meningococcal vaccination, in the overall 
2 to 10 years age population, across all vaccine groups, the most commonly reported systemic reaction 
was irritability, (range across vaccine groups, 11% to 22%), followed by: sleepiness (9% to 18%), 
change in eating habits (10% in all three vaccine groups), malaise (8% to 12%), headache (9% to 
11%), myalgia (7% to 10%), and diarrhea (6% to 8%). No other systemic reaction was reported by 
more than 6% of the subjects in any vaccine group.

The two most commonly reported systemic reactions, irritability and sleepiness (both reported only in 
the 2 to 5 years age stratum), were reported by highest percentages after Menactra (22% and 18%, 
for irritability and sleepiness, respectively) and by lowest percentages after Menomune (11% and 9%, 
respectively). The reporting rates for irritability and sleepiness following administration of MenACWY 
(18% and 14%, respectively) were lower than those observed for Menactra but still higher than those 
observed for Menomune. The percentages of subjects reporting all other systemic reactions were 
similar across the three vaccines groups. 
No severe systemic reaction was reported by more than 1% of the subjects in any vaccine group. 
Urticarial rash was reported by 2% of both MenACWY and Menactra recipients in study V59P20 (rash 
was solicited only in study V59P20). 
Across the vaccine groups, in the majority of subjects, systemic reactions (any and severe) occurred 
within the first 3 days postvaccination: no more than a 3% difference in the percentages reporting 
systemic reactions of any severity was observed for days 1 to 7 vs. days 1 to 3; for the severe 
systemic reactions, the difference ranged between 0 and 1%. 
No major difference in the percentages reporting fever (i.e., temperature [regardless of method of 
collection] ≥ 38°C) was observed across the three vaccine groups (days 1 to 7: range, 2% to 5%, 
days 1 to 3: range, 1% to 2%). Reports of severe fever (i.e., temperature [regardless of method of 
collection] ≥ 39°C) were low and similar across the vaccine groups (days 1 to 7 and 1 to 3: range, 
< 1% to 1%). No increase in the percentages reporting fever was observed when a second dose of 
meningococcal vaccine was administered in the 2 to 5 years age group.  
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Unsolicited adverse events were discussed as follows: 
(i) 
AEs reported within 1 month of the first/single vaccination: ages 2 to 10 years, comparing 
MenACWY (data pooled from all four studies) vs. Menactra (study V59P20) and Menomune 
(data pooled from studies V59P8 and V59P10); 
(ii) 
AEs reported within 1 month of the second meningococcal vaccination in ages 2 to 5 years 
(for two injections of MenACWY, data pooled from studies V59P7 and V59P20; for 
Mencevax→MenACWY, study V59P7); 
(iii) 
AEs reported during the 5-month follow-up period starting from 1 month after the last 
meningococcal vaccination, as follows:  
i. 
for MenACWY administered as a single injection: data pooled from studies 
V59P8, V59P10, and V59P20 vs. Menactra (study V59P20) and Menomune 
(data pooled from studies V59P8 and V59P10); 
ii. 
for two doses of meningococcal vaccine: two doses of MenACWY (data pooled 
from studies V59P7 and V59P20) vs. Mencevax→MenACWY (study V59P7). 
Within 1 month of the first/single meningococcal vaccination, the most frequently reported unsolicited 
AEs irrespective of relatedness were similar for the MenACWY and comparator vaccine groups: cough, 
upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, and pharyngitis were reported by 2% of the subjects in at 
least one of the three vaccine groups; no other individual AE by preferred term was reported by more 
than 1% of the subjects in any vaccine group.  
No AE assessed as at least possibly vaccine-related was reported by at least 1% of the subjects in any 
of the vaccine groups. The most commonly reported possibly related unsolicited AEs were the following 
local reactions ongoing past the 7-day observational period: injection site erythema, reported only 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 44/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after MenACWY and Menactra (MenACWY: 11 subjects out of 3107; Menactra: seven subjects out of 
1255) and injection site pruritus (MenACWY: four subjects out of 3107; Menactra: seven subjects out 
of 1255; Menomune: one subject out of 861. 
The percentages of subjects reporting any possibly or probably related unsolicited AE after any 
vaccination throughout the studies were similar across the three vaccine groups (range, 3% to 5%). 
The only SOC affected by reports of possibly related AEs in at least 1% of the subjects across the three 
vaccine groups was “general disorders and administration site conditions” (total MenACWY: 59 subjects 
[2%], Menactra: 29 subjects [2%], Menomune: 10 subjects [1%]). In the analysis of the remaining 
SOCs, 19, 18, and 17 out of 3181 total MenACWY subjects reported at least possibly related AEs in the 
SOCs of “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”, “nervous system disorders”, and “gastrointestinal 
disorders”, respectively. No other SOC was affected in more than ten out of 3181 total MenACWY 
subjects. In the comparator vaccine groups (Menactra, N = 1255; Menomune, N = 861) no SOC other 
than “general disorders and administration site conditions”, mentioned above, was reported by more 
than ten subjects. 
In the by age analysis of possibly related AEs, there were no major differences in the reporting rates 
observed across the vaccine and age groups. Across the two age groups, the reporting rates observed 
for MenACWY and Menactra recipients ranged between 4% and 5%, regardless of whether one or two 
doses of MenACWY were administered. The reporting rates for Menomune (2 to 5 years: 3%; 6 to 
10 years: 2%) were slightly lower compared with MenACWY and Menactra, while the overall lowest 
percentage (1%) was observed among the 2 to 5 year olds who received Mencevax followed by 
MenACWY (N = 74). 
In the analysis of individual SOCs, in both age strata, the only SOC affected by reports of possibly 
related unsolicited AEs in more than 1% of the subjects across all vaccine groups was “general 
disorders and administration site conditions (range across the age and vaccine groups, 1% to 2%). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
No death occurred in any of the four studies used to support this application. 
Serious adverse events 
Throughout the studies, in the overall 2 to 10 years population, no more than 1% of the subjects 
reported SAEs across the total MenACWY and comparator Menactra and Menomune groups. One of the 
SAEs reported, an episode of febrile convulsion, experienced by a MenACWY subject in the 2 to 5 years 
age stratum in study V59P10, was judged as at least possibly vaccine-related. An additional SAE 
(study V59P10, subject number 20/568, post-vaccine tonic convulsion) was considered by the 
investigator as not related to the vaccine itself but related to the conduct of the study (i.e., to the “act 
of vaccination”). The duration of the SAE was one day, the severity was mild, and the subject 
recovered. The event was assessed by the investigator as not related to the vaccine itself but related 
to the study conduct (i.e., the “act of vaccination”). 
When a single dose of meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY, Menactra, or Menomune) was administered, 
reports of SAEs were infrequent across the vaccine and age groups (range <1% to 1%). In the pooled 
analysis, reports of SAEs were more frequent when two doses of meningococcal vaccine were 
administered in the 2 to 5 years age group (3% and 12% in the MenACWY-->MenACWY and 
Mencevax--> MenACWY groups, respectively). This was accounted for in part by the fact that the 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 45/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall reporting period for the subjects receiving two vaccinations was longer compared with the 
reporting period for the single vaccination groups (8 to 18 months vs. 6 months). The more relevant 
explanation can be discerned from the by study analysis. When the MenACWY--> MenACWY group was 
analysed separately for studies V59P7 and V59P20, the percentage of subjects reporting SAEs in study 
V59P7 (8%) was higher than the respective percentage observed in study V59P20 (1%) and in line 
with the percentage observed in the comparator, Mencevax--> MenACWY group in study V59P7 
(12%). The higher percentages reporting SAEs in study V59P7 were accounted for by a comparatively 
high incidence of varicella infection in this unvaccinated population and the fact that all varicella cases, 
regardless of severity and hospitalisation status, were categorised by the investigator as SAEs. In the 
large V59P20 study, when a two dose regimen was explored in the 2 to 5 years age stratum, the 
percentage of subjects reporting SAEs was the same (1%) regardless of whether one of two doses of 
MenACWY were administered. 
Laboratory findings 
N/A 
Safety in special populations 
Overall, no major or consistent differences in the safety profile of MenACWY were observed across the 
two age strata (2-5, 6-10 years) and by gender. The differences in the reporting rates for local 
reactogenicity systemic reactions and other indicators of reactogenicity after MenACWY observed 
across the three studies conducted in different geographic locations did not show any consistent 
pattern. 
Immunological events 
N/A 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In the limited sample size of only 74 subjects from study V59P7 who received Mencevax followed by 
MenACWY, no vaccine-vaccine interactions in terms of solicited reactions or unsolicited AEs was 
observed. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
No subject discontinued because of adverse events. 
Post marketing experience 
MenACWY was approved for use in persons 11 years and above on March 15, 2010. MenACWY adverse 
events cases received by the MAH were analysed for a periodic safety update report (data lock point on 
14 March 2011) submitted to European authorities. The evaluations show no increased frequency of 
listed reactions, no fatal cases, no drug interactions and no effects on pregnancy or lactation. No 
vaccine related effect has been evident in any subgroup of vaccinees.

Discussion on clinical safety 
The presence of the protein to which the antigens are conjugated, and consequently the higher 
immunogenicity, could potentially explain the increased reactogenicity seen with MenACWY and 
Menactra compared to Menomune.  
In the studies related to this variation application, including over 3000 subjects, one SAE that was 
considered possibly related to vaccination with MenACWY occurred (febrile convulsion in a 5 year old 
girl with a history of febrile convulsions) and one SAE related to the act of vaccination: tonic convulsion 
with enuresis in a 7 year old girl. 
Regarding seizures/convulsions and Kawasaki disease, no new information was identified, but these AE 
terms should remain under close monitoring. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
MenACWY was well tolerated in 3181 children (2-10 years) included in the integrated safety analysis.  
No new safety signals were observed. 
2.4.  Pharmacovigilance 
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure. 
  Safety Specification – Non-clinical 
MenACWY formulations demonstrated an immune response in mouse immunogenicity and rabbit 
toxicology studies. The toxicology studies investigated general toxicology, local tolerability, and 
reproduction and embryofoetal development toxicity in rabbits. The general toxicology dose regimen of 
5 doses exceeds the single dose clinical regimen. 
In conclusion, MenACWY vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in rabbits after one or five IM 
administrations at a dosage which, on a body weight basis, was more than 24 times greater than the 
anticipated human dose. Further, the dosing regimen used in the multiple-dose portion of this study 
exceeded the planned clinical regimen by two to four administrations. No systemic toxicity occurred 
and only slight and reversible inflammation limited to the injection sites was noted. 
There were no effects on embryofoetal development in the pilot rabbit reproductive and developmental 
toxicity study when one to two times the clinical dose was administered three times pre-gestation and 
twice during gestation. There were no effects on reproduction, embryofoetal and postnatal 
development in the definitive rabbit study when the clinical dose was administered three times pre-
gestation and twice during gestation, thus representing, on a body weight basis, a 15-fold multiple of a 
human dose and an excess by two to four administrations versus the planned clinical regimen.

Summary of safety concerns from nonclinical investigations 
SAFETY CONCERN 
(from nonclinical studies) 
Repeat Dose Toxicity: 
RELEVANCE TO HUMAN USAGE 
Transient inflammation of the injection sites. There 
were no other histopathology findings. 
Novartis MenACWY administration resulted in 
comparable local reactogenicity rates compared with 
licensed comparators (e.g., Menactra, Boostrix) which 
were mostly mild in severity and of limited duration.  
Reproductive Toxicity 
No test article-related maternal findings. 
Developmental Toxicity 
No fetal alterations related to the test article. 
  Safety Specification – Clinical 
The safety specification has considered the most important issues identified, suspected or missing 
during the development programme (see summary of the EU risk management plan).  
The MAH is proposing additional pharmacovigilance activities through questionnaires for Guillain-Barre 
Syndrome, Acute disseminated encephalitis, Kawasaki Disease and Vasculitis. Vaccine failure will be 
closely monitored. 
  Proposed pharmacovigilance activities/studies 
Study V59_34OB 
Study V59_34OB is a phase IV study to assess the safety of MenACWY being used by a large 
Healthcare Maintenance Organization (HMO) subjects 11 to 20 years of age in the United States. The 
study is a post-marketing study which evaluates the safety of MenACWY for a predetermined set of 
events of interest (EOI) among 50,000 vaccinated adolescents. Subjects who have been vaccinated 
with MenACWY and have experienced an incident EOI within the one year observation period following 
vaccination are selected for the primary analysis using the self-controlled case-series methodology to 
determine the relative incidence of each EOI. The 26 EOI comprise certain neurological, immunological, 
vascular, musculoskeletal, and hematologic disorders and are commonly evaluated adverse events in 
vaccine safety studies. In a secondary objective, relative incidence of the EOI will also be determined 
by first estimating the incidence rates for EOI from the current study and, second, comparing these to 
published literature incidence rates from comparable populations, where available. 
This study started in September 2011 and enrolment will continue for a minimum of one year or until 
50,000 subjects have been vaccinated.  
Study V59_54OB  
Study V59_54OB is an open label, descriptive, epidemiological safety surveillance study of MenACWY in 
subjects 2 to 10 years of age. The study is enrolling in the same large HMO where study V59_34OB is 
being conducted and is in two parts. Part I begins with the first administration of MenACWY to a child 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 48/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 through 10 years of age (inclusive) who receives medical care at the site where the study is being 
conducted. Part I continues for 3 years or until the beginning of Part II, which ever occurs first. Part II 
of the study will be initiated if there is a recommendation by ACIP for routine use of MenACWY in at 
least one birth cohort that is within the 2 to 10 year age range. 
Kawasaki disease 
The estimated annual incidence rate of 38 per 100,000 is of concern since it is higher than the 
expected rate (2.5 - 9 cases per 100,000 in EU). However since these estimates are based on very low 
absolute number of cases, the observed incidence rates should be interpreted with caution. There are 
indications that the geographical location of study population greatly influences the KD incidence rates. 
The involvement of a KD expert panel to define disease criteria is strongly endorsed. A latency period 
of up to 30 days between vaccination and onset has been postulated as reasonable criteria for 
relatedness. This cut-off has been substantiated by literature and is accepted. It is recognised that due 
to the low EU background incidence in the 2-10 age group (2.5 - 9 cases per 100,000 children <5 
years of age) combined with the limited use of the vaccine in 2-10 years of age population, obtaining a 
sufficient number of vaccinated and unvaccinated KD cases may be impossible. It is agreed that 
increased follow-up of the reported cases is most important and feasible at this stage. The enhanced 
PhV activities (i.e. KD questionaire) are endorsed in combination with close monitoring of any new 
reports. 
Translucent particles in the syringe/vial formulations  
The presence of oily and translucent visible particles was detected in the syringes and communicated 
to the EMA in February 2011. Analyses of the particles revealed that they are composed by silicone oil 
and proteins. The MAH has performed a series of experiments with the goal of identifying the potential 
interactions between the translucent particles and glycoconjugate present in the PFS and has also 
performed additional MFI analysis to better elucidate the presence or absence of any time-based trend. 
There does not appear to be an interaction that would affect dose strength and there does not appear 
to be a clear time-based trend that could impact product quality over time. Additionally, MFI analysis 
of samples in the vial/vial presentation show significantly lower particle counts and confirm that the 
presence of silicone oil is responsible for the translucent particles observed in PFS.  
It is concluded that the translucent particles have been present in the pre-filled syringe drug product 
all along, and that from a pharmacological-toxicological viewpoint the presence of polydimethylsiloxane 
does not raise a serious concern, and hence there is no immediate need for market action nor an 
immediate need to uphold the release of new pre-filled syringe batches.  
A monodose vial/vial presentation will be introduced in the EU market. The MAH confirmed that the 
syringe/vial presentation will not be marketed for children below 11 years and proposed the following 
actions: 
- The MAH will pack only vial/vial presentation with leaflet including the 2-10 indication. No syringe/vial 
presentation will be released onto the market for children below 11 years. All European markets will 
have switched to Menveo vial/vial presentation by the end of March 2012. After the end of March 2012 
the company will no longer release the PFS/vial presentation into the distribution chain for any age 
group indication. 
- Since no additional PFS/vial presentation will be released into the market after March 2012, all of the 
PFS/vial presentations remaining on the European market will be expired by August 2013.

2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI),  to  which  the  CHMP  agreed 
for the vial/vial presentations (EU/1/10/614/002, EU/1/10/614/003): 
Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to extend the indication to include 
children aged 2 to 10 years old at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y. 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI as discussed in detail above 
(see discussion on clinical efficacy): 
Update  of  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  to  include  a  warning  that  booster  dose  should  be  considered  for 
persons who remain at risk of exposure to Men A. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  which 
were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
Annex II was updated to reflect the obligation to complete the following post-authorisation measure: 
Study  to  evaluate  immediate  and  longer  term  antibody  titres  elicited  by  one  or  two  doses  of  Menveo 
administered in children aged 2-10 years according to a CHMP-agreed protocol. 
2.6.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a consultation with target patient group has been submitted. The 
MAH submitted a user consultation with patients groups for a corresponding product Menjugate. When 
applying for the marketing authorisation the applicant submitted the user test for Menjugate. A 
bridging document indicating the similarities and differences between the package leaflet for Menjugate 
and the package leaflet for Menveo was provided at the time of the initial marketing authorisation. The

3.  Benefit risk assessment 
Benefits  
Due to the low incidence rates of MenACWY disease it is not considered feasible to generate clinical 
efficacy data for licensing, the evaluation of efficacy was based upon the measurement of functional 
antibodies using rSBA and mainly hSBA assays. An hSBA titre of 1:4 has been established as a 
correlate for protection for serogroup C. From this correlate the value of the immune response for 
other serogroups is inferred, for which no official correlate has been established. 
Beneficial effects 
In Europe, cases of meningococcal disease occur sporadically, but occasionally outbreaks can be an 
important cause of illness and death. 
Serogroups B and C cause the majority of reported cases in Europe, North and South America, while 
serogroup A causes the majority of disease in Africa and Asia. The total number of laboratory 
confirmed cases in the 29 EU/EEA countries of invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, 
C, W-135 and Y in the year 2007 was 918 (10 serogroup A, 684 serogroup C, 105 serogroup W-135 
and 119 serogroup Y). The fatality rate is highest for serogroup C and Y (14%), as compared to W-135 
(7-8%).  
An effective vaccine could potentially prevent ~1000 cases of invasive meningococcal disease and save 
~125 lives in the EU/EEA countries annually. Menveo also has the potential to protect subjects who 
travel to other continents against serogroups that are less common in Europe (A, Y and W-135).  
The possible benefits of MenACWY over currently available vaccines are the presence of additional 
serogroups, in order to provide broader protection (to A, W and Y) in settings where this would be 
necessary. Secondly, plain polysaccharide vaccines are known to be less effective compared to 
conjugated vaccines in infants and young children and they do not mount a booster response. After 
repeated injections the response is less than for the first primary response, a term referred to as 
hyporesponsiveness. The use of plain polysaccharide meningococcal ACWY vaccines is limited to 
children over 2 years of age. 
In the main pivotal study (V59P20) for this variation application the seroresponse (95%CI) one month 
following a first dose with MenACWY was 72% (68-75), 60% (56-64), 72% (68-75) and 66% (62-70) 
for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively for children aged 2-5 years. The response for children aged 
6-10 years was 77% (73-80), 63% (59-67), 57% (53-61) and 58% (54-62) respectively. Non-
inferiority to Menactra, a conjugated MenACWY vaccine, was established for all serogroups except A, 
where the difference in response was - 6% (95%CI: -11 to -1).  One month after a first dose 72%, 
68%, 90% and 76% of children between 2 and 5 years had hSBA ≥1:8 for serogroups A, C, W and Y 
respectively. For children aged 6 – 10 years this was slightly higher at 77%, 77%, 91% and 79% 
respectively.  
One month following a second dose the percentage of children aged 2 to 5 years with hSBA ≥ 1:8 was 
91%, 99%, 99% and 98% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. 
The response with MenACWY was compared to the response to a plain PS MenACWY vaccine in studies 
V59P7, V59P8 and V59P10.  In study V59P7 the percentage subjects (aged 3-5 years) with hSBA ≥1:8 
with MenACWY 28 days after the first dose was 61%, 54%, 84% and 67% for serogroups A, C, W and 
Y respectively. The % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 following a plain PS vaccine was 39%, 39%, 59% 
and 57% respectively. In study V59P8 the % of subjects (aged 2-10 years) with hSBA≥1:8 one month 
following MenACWY in children was 80%, 73%, 92% and 88% for serogroups A, C, W and Y

respectively compared to 37%, 55%, 65% and 55% following a single dose of Menomune for 
serogroups A, C, W and Y. Superiority of MenACWY over Menomune was demonstrated. In study 
V59P10 the seroresponse one month following MenACWY in children aged 2-10 years was 93%, 82%, 
74% and 82% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. The seroresponse one month following 
Menomune was 55%, 52%, 46% and 63% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. Here too, 
superiority of MenACWY over Menomune was demonstrated. 
Six months after a single dose MenACWY in study V59P7 the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 
was 10%, 32%, 77% and 60% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. Six months after a single 
dose in study V59P10 (children 2-10 years) the % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 was 35%, 81%, 96% 
and 89% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. Twelve months after a single dose MenACWY in 
study V59P7 the % of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 was 9%, 24%, 76% and 64% for serogroups A, C, W 
and Y respectively. Twelve months after a single dose MenACWY in study V59P8 the % of subjects with 
hSBA ≥1:8 was 23%, 53%, 90% and 77% for serogroups A, C, W and Y respectively. The five year 
persistence data of study V59P20E1 are expected in 2013. 
Data from studies where booster dose has been administered support the ability of Menveo to induce a 
T-cell-dependent primary immune response. These data predict that a memory response will be 
elicited. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No data on prevention of meningococcal disease have been generated for MenACWY.  
There is data on the immune response following a second dose in children aged 2-5 years (V59P20), 
which indicates a considerable increase in immune response in this age group. There is no data related 
to a second dose for children aged 6-10 years; however as their immune response following a single 
dose is only slightly higher than in children aged 2-5 years a second dose could be of additional benefit 
there too. 
There is persistence data up to 12 months following a single dose which indicates the need for a 
booster dose as the persistence of especially serogroup A is poor when measured with the hSBA. For 
serogroup C persistence of bactericidal antibodies is moderate. This is not confirmed by rSBA results in 
adolescents, where a high rSBA response was still seen after 3 years. There is uncertainty about the 
reliability of the rSBA results for persistence of MenA as a high proportion of unvaccinated persons also 
had rSBA ≥1:128 in study V59P13E1. There is no insight in persistence following a booster dose. 
Neither is there insight in persistence of bactericidal antibodies following two doses in children aged 2 
to 10 years.  
MenACWY has not been evaluated in immunocompromised people.   
There is no data on efficacy and safety in children with complement disorders or with functional or 
actual asplenia.  
No data on co-administration of MenACWY with other vaccines has been provided for the 2-10 year age 
group. Possible interactions with other commonly used travellers vaccines are being investigated in 
adults/adolescents.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database includes more than 3000 subjects 2-10 years of age who received at least one 
Menveo dose. In addition a safety database comprising more than 7000 infants/toddlers have been 
submitted and finally there is considerable experience from the use of Menveo in adolescents and 
adults. Overall, it appears that reactogenicity of Menveo is acceptable and slightly increased compared 
to unconjugated MenACWY vaccines. 
Following a single/first dose pain was the most commonly reported local reaction, and was reported by 
31%. Severe pain was reported by ~1%. The most commonly reported systemic reaction was 
irritability (18%) followed by sleepiness (14%), and malaise (12%). The most frequent reported 
unsolicited adverse events (within 1 month of a single/first dose) were cough, upper respiratory tract 
infection, pyrexia, and pharyngitis (reported by ~2% of subjects). No deaths occurred. One SAE 
possibly related to MenACWY occurred, febrile convulsion in a 5 year old child with a history of 
convulsions. There were no discontinuations due to AEs in the 2-10 year population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
MenACWY has not been evaluated in persons with thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders or that are 
receiving anticoagulant therapy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
At present no conjugated tetravalent MenACWY vaccines are licensed in the EU for children aged 2-
10 years. The presence of additional serogroups compared to available conjugated meningococcal 
vaccines ensure that MenACWY provides broader protection (to A, W and Y) in settings where this 
would be necessary, which is an important benefit to those children expected to travel to areas where 
they would be at increased risk. As plain polysaccharide vaccines are known to be less effective in 
infants and young children, and as they do not mount a booster response, the benefit of having a 
conjugated tetravalent meningococcal vaccine is considered large for those children at risk of 
exposure. Indeed, superiority of MenACWY was mostly demonstrated over different plain 
polysaccharide vaccines and the MAH has demonstrated that a good booster response can be achieved, 
which are important benefits over the currently available polysaccharide vaccines. 
Overall the safety profile is quite favourable, and no unknown risks were identified. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Although the benefit of having a conjugated tetravalent meningococcal vaccine available for young 
children travelling to areas where they are at increased risk of exposure and thus of invasive disease is 
considered quite large, it is crucial that when vaccinated, optimum protection should be achieved in 
these children.  
The immune response following one dose is largely superior to the immune response after a single 
dose of licensed tetravalent unconjugated vaccines, reactogenicity is only slightly increased, and unlike 
unconjugated vaccines MenACWY elicits a T-cell dependent immune response, therefore the overall 
Benefit Risk of a single dose of MenACWY in children aged 2-10 years is positive.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/332810/2012  
Page 54/57
 
 
 
 
 
Nonetheless, results from study V59_57 are needed to determine the added benefits of a second dose 
versus the increased risks. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The overall seroresponse to MenACWY is moderate: the response to serogroup C is approximately 60% 
for all ages, around 70% to the other three serogroups in the younger age group and around 60% for 
serogroup W and Y in the older age group, and almost 80% in for serogroup A in the older age group. 
This appears mostly driven by a low response in those with baseline hSBA≥1:4, in which the response 
is clearly less than in those without baseline antibodies (especially for serogroups W and Y). However, 
there is sufficient evidence demonstrating the boosterability of MenACWY. Importantly, the percentage 
subjects that achieved hSBA≥1:8 following vaccination regardless of baseline titres was higher.  
No comparative study with monovalent MenC was made for children included in the current variation 
application. As a consequence, the indication is limited to persons “at risk of exposure”, a term that 
was introduced to indicate that the B/R is so far positively established for EU individuals at risk of 
invasive disease, e.g. through travel or during outbreaks. 
There are clear indications of improved immunogenicity with a second dose in children aged 2 to 
5 years with possibly limited additional risks associated with a second dose. The MAH is planning a 
study (Study V59_57) to compare one versus two doses in children aged 2 to 10 years. The study shall 
provide additional information about the safety and immunogenicity and persistence of bactericidal 
antibodies following two doses as compared to one dose. These results are needed to determine the 
added benefits of a second dose versus any increased risks. The MAH should submit the results of this 
study as soon as they are available.  
As with adults, adolescents and children over the age of 11, problems with persistence of antibodies 
against serogroup A are seen, and to a lesser degree with MenC.  It appears that a booster dose is 
needed to maintain bactericidal Abs for serogroup A when relying on the hSBA data. However, this is 
not confirmed by the rSBA results in adolescents, where concerns exist on the reliability of the results 
for MenA. A warning has been included in the SmPC that there is a steep decline in antibodies and as 
such a booster dose should be considered for persons who remain at risk of exposure to MenA. 
In 2 to 10 year olds, there currently is no long-term follow-up (> 1 year) and all data has been 
generated using the hSBA. The MAH has plans to follow-up the subjects from the larger phase 3 study 
V59P20 at a five year time point and this data will be available in 2013 from the extension study 
V59P20E1.  
3.1.  Conclusions 
The B/R of Menveo, meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (diphtheria CRM197 conjugate) in the 
indication of 
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (2 to 10 years of age) at risk of 
exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations 
is positive for the vial/vial presentations.

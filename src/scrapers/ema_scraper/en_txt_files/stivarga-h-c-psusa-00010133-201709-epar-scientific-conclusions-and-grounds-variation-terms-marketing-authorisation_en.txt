Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for regorafenib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on postmarketing data and data from a placebo controlled study, a possible causal association 
with regorafenib and peripheral neuropathy cannot be excluded; therefore, PRAC considered that 
section 4.8 of the SmPC should be updated to include ‘peripheral neuropathy’ with the frequency 
common; the package leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for regorafenib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing regorafenib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

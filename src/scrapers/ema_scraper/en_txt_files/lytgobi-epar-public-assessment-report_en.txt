2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially applied indication was: 
Lytgobi is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated locally 
advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma harbouring FGFR2 gene rearrangements, including gene 
fusions. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represent the second-most common malignancy of the liver, accounting for 
approximately 15% of all primary liver cancers and approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers 
(Banales 2020).  
The incidence of CCA is rare overall, with 1 to 3 patients per 100,000 in regions like the United States 
and Europe (Banales 2016; Khan 2019). Liver fluke and other parasitic infections give rise to a much 
higher incidence in Southeast Asia (113 per 100,000 person-years in men and 50 per 100,000 person-
years in women; Bergquist and von Seth 2015). The incidence and mortality of CCA (in particular of 
intrahepatic CCA (iCCA)) have been increasing in the last decades worldwide (Banales 2020). For 
instance, the annual incidence of iCCA was 1.49 per 100,000 in the US in 2014, representing a 2-fold 
increase over the past 4 decades (Saha 2016). 
The incidence of iCCA in Europe has also increased over the past decades (1971-2009) in Austria, 
Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom (Banales 2016), but not in Denmark (Bridgewater 2014; 
Cardinale 2018). This overall increase in incidence has been linked (to an extent) to several emerging 
risk factors of the disease, including the rising prevalence of obesity (Banales 2016). 
There are some risk factors and pathological conditions that have been clearly associated with CCA 
development, including infectious and inflammatory diseases, but despite the advancements in the 
knowledge of CCA etiology, approximately 50% of cases in Western countries are still diagnosed 
without any identifiable risk factor (Banales 2016; Banales 2020). General risk factors include age >65 
years, obesity and diabetes mellitus. The main risk factors are primary sclerosing cholangitis and 
fibropolycystic liver disease (e.g., choledochal cysts) in the United States and Europe. There is a clear 
association between chronic intrahepatic stone disease (hepatolithiasis, also called recurrent pyogenic 
cholangitis) and CCA. Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis and viral infection) is now recognised as a risk 
factor, particularly for iCCA. Finally, at least four genetic conditions, Lynch syndrome, BRCA-associated 
protein-1 tumour predisposition syndrome, cystic fibrosis and biliary papillomatosis, appear to increase 
the risk for CCA. About 50% of cases are still diagnosed without any identifiable risk factor despite the 
advancements in the knowledge of CCA aetiology in Western countries. Other still undefined etiologic 
factors are likely to be responsible for the recent increase of CCA (especially iCCA) incidence 
worldwide. (Khan et al, 2019) 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CCA is a heterogeneous disease arising from a complex interaction between host- specific genetic 
background and multiple risk factors.  
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 10/118 
 
 
 
CCA is a malignancy originating in the epithelial lining of the biliary tree and it is commonly classified 
based on anatomical location. Extrahepatic (eCCA) includes hilar and distal tumours and accounts for 
the majority of cases (DeOliveira et al 2007, Nakeeb et al 1996). Approximately 5 to 10 percent of 
CCAs are intrahepatic (UpToDate visited 06JUL22). 
The knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of CCA is less advanced than that of other 
gastrointestinal cancers. Molecularly, the precursors of carcinoma remain poorly characterised. With 
emerging technologies, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), actionable mutations in the 
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2), FGFR2, BRAF, and HER2/neu genes have been identified for 
targeted therapeutics in CCA and gallbladder cancer. 
The FGFR family consists of four transmembrane receptors (FGFR1 to FGFR4), 18 FGF ligands, and a 
heparan sulfate proteoglycan that stabilises and sequesters the FGFs. The ligand-receptor combination 
is responsible for the activation of downstream RAS/RAF/MEK, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT pathways. 
Genetic aberrations such as activating mutations, amplifications, or chromosomal 
translocations/fusions in the FGFR pathway contribute to malignant transformation (EPAR Pemazyre 
EMA/CHMP/105411/2021, Krook 2020).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
The prognosis of patients with Stage III or IV CCA is poor, with 5-year survival rates of 10% and 0%, 
respectively (Lamarca et al. 2014) and a median overall survival (OS) of 8-12 months (Goral 2017). 
The majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma (> 65%) have nonresectable disease at the time of 
diagnosis, and the rate of recurrence is high among patients in the minority who are able to undergo 
potentially curative surgery. 
FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) occur in about 10% to 16% of patients with iCCA (Krook 
2020; Jain 2018), and at a much lower incidence in patients with eCCA (Arai 2014; Jain 2018). 
Baseline demographics of patients with CCA harboring FGFR2 rearrangements appear to differ from 
those without, with a lower median age of 52 years than the reported median age of the overall CCA 
population (~65 years) and a female preponderance (13% vs. 4%) (Graham 2014). The prognostic 
role of coexisting GAs, and the outcome with FGFR-targeted inhibitors are still under discussion (EPAR 
Pemazyre EMA/CHMP/105411/2021). 
2.1.5.  Management 
First line treatment  
CCA is a fatal disease for which there is significant unmet need for new therapies.  
The ESMO guideline recommends cisplatin–gemcitabine–durvalumab for first-line treatment of patients 
with unresectable and metastatic disease (ESMO 2022). On 10 November 2022, the CHMP adopted a 
positive opinion recommending a new indication to include first-line treatment of biliary tract cancer for 
durvalumab. 
Durvalumab plus chemotherapy was evaluated in the phase 3 TOPAZ-1 trial. The primary objective 
was to assess overall survival. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomly assigned to 
receive durvalumab (n=341) or placebo (n=344) in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin for up 
to eight cycles, followed by durvalumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The median overall survival was 12.8 months (95% CI, 11.1 to 14.0) in the 
durvalumab group and 11.5 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 12.5) in the placebo treatment group (Oh 
Do-Youn et al. 2022). 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 11/118 
 
 
 
Gemcitabine/cisplatin was the standard first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic CCA at the time of study conduct (ESMO 2016). This was based on a 
randomized-controlled study comparing gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine alone in 
410 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent biliary tract cancer where the median mPFS was 
8.0 months in the gemcitabine/cisplatin group and 5.0 months in the gemcitabine-only group (Valle 
2010). In other prospective studies published between 2004 and 2013 in patients with advanced biliary 
tract cancers, treatment with gemcitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment resulted in median 
progression free survival (PFS) ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 months and median overall survival (OS) 
ranging from 4.6 to 11.7 months (Park 2015). 
Second line treatment  
Therapeutic options for patients who progress on standard therapy are limited. There is no established 
systemic therapy once CCA has progressed on first-line therapy. A systematic review including 
761 patients showed disappointing median PFS (3.2 months; 95% CI: 2.7–3.7) and response rates 
(7.7%; 95% CI: 4.6–10.9); the mean OS was 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.2–8.2) in the second-line 
treatment with chemotherapy (ESMO Guideline biliary cancer and Lamarca et al. 2014). Patients are 
therefore encouraged to participate in clinical trials per ESMO 2016 guidelines. According to clinical 
data collected in a database of the Hannover Medical School (Germany), patients received different 
chemotherapy regimens in second- and third-line treatment (e.g. FOLFOX and FOLFIRI). On 28 
January 2021, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional 
marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Pemazyre (pemigatinib), intended for the second 
and later line of treatment of advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma characterized by fusion or 
rearrangements of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. The objective response rate (ORR) was 37.0% 
(95 CI%: 27.94, 46.86) in the Efficacy Evaluable Population (N=108) (SmPC Pemazyre). The median 
DOR was 8.08 months (95 % CI: 5.65, 13.14) (EPAR Pemazyre EMA/CHMP/105411/2021). Most 
recently, the IDH1-inhibitor Tibsovo (ivosidenib) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an IDH1 R132 mutation who were previously 
treated by at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
Locoregional therapies, including transarterial chemoembolisation, hepatic arterial infusion, 
percutaneous ablation, external beam radiation therapy, and radioembolisation (Koay 2017), are not 
recommended for routine use due to a lack of prospective data (Labib et al 2017).  
2.2.  About the product 
Futibatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits FGFR 1, 2, 3, and 4 by 
covalent binding with IC50 values of less than 4 nM. Futibatinib inhibited FGFR phosphorylation and 
downstream signalling and decreased cell viability in cancer cell lines with activating FGFR alterations, 
including FGFR fusions/rearrangements, amplifications, or mutations. Constitutive FGFR signalling can 
support the proliferation and survival of malignant cells. Futibatinib exhibited in vitro antiproliferative 
activity against cancer cell lines harbouring FGFR2 resistance mutations in the kinase domain (N550H, 
V565I, E566G, K660M). Futibatinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in mouse and rat xenograft 
models of human tumours with activating FGFR genetic alterations. 
The proposed Pharmacological classification is: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; 
ATC code: L01EN04.  
The indication as adopted by CHMP is:

Lytgobi monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or 
rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
The film-coated tablet contains 4 mg of futibatinib.  
The recommended starting dose is 20 mg Lytgobi taken orally once daily. Treatment should be 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant proposes the ‘single-arm’ Phase 2 Study TAS-120-205 as SOB, to provide 
comprehensive clinical data within an appropriate timeframe confirming that the benefit-risk 
balance is positive. This proposal entails replication of the single-arm efficacy (and safety) data 
from the pivotal Study TAS-120-101 in a new and independent single-arm study cohort to in 
time provide a comprehensive overall data package. 
This study will be a global, open-label Phase 2 study in patients with advanced, unresectable 
cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements who have received at least one prior 
systemic therapy. A total of 120 patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive futibatinib at a 
starting dose of either 20 mg (Arm A) or 16 mg (Arm B) orally QD. The primary endpoint will 
be ORR according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by blinded independent central review with 
DOR being a key secondary endpoint. The primary analysis will be based on the 20 mg 
treatment arm. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed. 
Therapeutic options for patients who progress on standard therapy are very limited. In second 
line and beyond, currently available chemotherapy treatments are largely ineffective, with a 
collective median ORR of less than 8% observed in a retrospective review covering 
761 patients (Lamarca 2014). Of note, recent retrospective analyses have shown that the 
outcomes of post-first-line chemotherapy among the subset of patients with FGFR2 
rearrangements/fusions were similarly poor as those seen in the overall population, including a 
response rate <6% (Javle 2020). 
Multiple FGFR inhibitors are in development for CCA. The oral FGFR1-3 inhibitor pemigatinib 
has received accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the 
European Union (EU) for the treatment of patients with previously treated CCA harbouring 
FGFR2 rearrangements/fusions. However, options for patients with CCA with a clearly 
established and positive benefit/risk profile remain limited. Pemigatinib (as the only currently 
approved FGFR- targeting therapy for CCA in the EU) has demonstrated clinical benefit in an 
uncontrolled Phase 2 study for CCA patients with FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) 
and is awaiting confirmation in an ongoing randomized Phase 3 study as compared to standard 
of care chemotherapy in first-line advanced CCA patients with FGFR2 rearrangements 
(including fusions). Moreover, despite the 36% ORR reported for the ATP-competitive FGFR 
inhibitor pemigatinib, there is an unmet need for novel targeted therapies leading to an even 
higher number of responses with greater durability for patients with advanced CCA with FGFR2

rearrangement (including fusions). This also includes novel treatment options for patients with 
mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain leading to conformational changes of the ATP pocket, 
and thereby causing resistance to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Goyal 2019; Sootome 2020). 
In the primary analysis (n=103) of the Phase 2 portion of Study TAS-120-101, treatment with 
futibatinib resulted in the numerically highest confirmed ORR (41.7%) and numerically longest 
median duration of response (9.7 months) for previously treated patients with advanced iCCA 
with FGFR2 rearrangement reported so far. Median PFS (9.0 months) also exceeded historical 
controls by a substantial margin. Furthermore, expression of FGFR4 correlates with disease 
progression and poor prognosis in CCA (Xu 2014). 
For patients who progress on standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin(2L+), 
prognosis is even more dismal, with life expectancy of 6-7 months, response rates below 10%, 
and mPFS of only 3 months (Lamarca 2014). On 23 February 2023 the CHMP adopted a 
positive opinion recommending the granting of a MA for the IDH1-inhibitor Tibsovo (ivosidenib) 
for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with 
an IDH1 R132 mutation who were previously treated by at least one prior line of systemic 
therapy. FGFR2 alterations occur in roughly 10% to 15% of cholangiocarcinoma, however, they 
rarely co-occur with IDH1 mutations (co-occurrence in approximately 2% to 5%) (Battaglin et 
al, 2020; Jain et al, 2018; Valle et al, 2017; Saborowski et al, 2020). While the EU specific 
obligations for pemigatinib to demonstrate clinical benefit in a randomized controlled Phase 3 
study compared to standard of care are ongoing, it is not yet possible to confirm the full 
benefit of this conditionally authorised product. Therefore, according to section 4c of the EMA 
CMA guideline EMA/CHMP/509951/2006, Rev.1 (2016) guideline, futibatinib can be 
recommended for CMA as another medicinal product if it is addressing the same unmet medical 
need of patients with CCA to a similar or greater extent than what is understood for the 
already conditionally authorised product pemigatinib. 
Based on the above considerations and on the results from the pivotal Phase 2 portion of study 
TAS-120-101, futibatinib has the potential to address a significant unmet medical need in this 
patient population. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
Unfortunately, few treatment options (with the exception of pemigatinib) are available in the EU 
to CCA patients with FGFR2 gene rearrangements, including gene fusions who progress on 
standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin. In the 2L+ setting prognosis is even more 
dismal, with life expectancy of 6-7 months, response rates below 10%, and mPFS of only 3 
months (Vienot and Neuzillet 2018; Lamarca 2014). The specific obligations for pemigatinib to 
demonstrate clinical benefit in a randomized controlled Phase 3 study compared to standard of 
care are ongoing and as such, it is not yet possible to confirm the full benefit of this 
conditionally authorised product. 
Futibatinib is the first agent to irreversibly inhibit all 4 subtypes of FGFR, expected to result in a 
clear advantage in terms of possible clinical benefit for treated patients. Furthermore, 
futibatinib treatment was associated with a generally predictable, monitorable, and 
manageable toxicity profile with low incidence of severe adverse events and quality of life 
scores maintained during futibatinib treatment.

Figure 1. Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of futibatinib was inferred from its route of synthesis and confirmed by a 
combination of elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, UV spectroscopy IR spectroscopy NMR 
spectroscopy (1H NMR, H-D exchange,13C NMR, DEPT135, HSQC, COSY, HMBC, NOESY) and single 
crystal X-ray diffraction. The single chiral centre is in the (S) configuration. Enantioselectivity is 
confirmed by chiral HPLC analysis of relevant materials and the active substance. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by thermal analysis, X-ray powder 
diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and by measuring water content. Several anhydrous and hydrated forms 
were identified. It was confirmed that the intended commercial polymorphic form is routinely produced 
under the applied recrystallisation conditions and is thermodynamically stable. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to light yellow crystalline powder. It is classified as 
BCS class 2 compound, i.e. low solubility/high permeability. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Futibatinib is synthesized by a convergent process using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The final 
crystallisation conditions ensure the correct polymorphic form and particle size distribution (PSD). 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. Given the indication of the product in advanced cancer, ICH 
M7 does not apply. Limits for impurities have been set accordingly.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The overall synthetic route has remained the same and minor changes 
to reagents, solvents, and the overall process have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.  
The active substance is packaged in triple low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sealed in a polyethylene 
liner. The bag is placed into a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum with a secure fitting lid. The 
relevant materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (IR, UV, HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric impurity (chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), polymorphic form (XRPD), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), and 
assay (HPLC), 
Limits for impurities have been set according to ICH Q3A and the limit for total impurities is considered 
acceptable. The justification, based on historical batch data, for not including test for elemental 
impurities and microbiological purity is considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for seven production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 6 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 36 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters 
were tested: appearance, identity, impurities, enantiomer, water content, assay, polymorphic form and 
microbial limits. The analytical methods are the same as for release except the microbial limit test 
which is pharmacopoeial. All tested parameters during the stability studies remained within 
specifications and or trends or significant changes were observed. No agglomeration or particle growth 
occurs during storage and the polymorphic form remains unchanged. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Forced degradation 
studies demonstrate the that the analytical methods are stability  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Lytgobi film-coated tablets contain 4 mg of futibatinib as active substance. The finished product is 
presented as white, round, film-coated tablets debossed with “4MG” on one side, and “FBN” on the 
other. The tablets have a nominal diameter of 6.1 mm and a nominal thickness of 3.0 mm. 
The development target was a solid oral dosage form containing 4 mg futibatinib. Various formulations 
were investigated during clinical development. The physicochemical characteristics of active substance 
were discussed. Futibatinib is a weakly ionizable compound (pKa=3.24) which is classified as BCS 
Class 2 due to its low solubility and high Caco-2 cell membrane permeability. Futibatinib exhibits 
polymorphism and the most thermodynamically stable form is consistently produced by the 
manufacturing process. No further transformation of the polymorphic form occurs on formulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023

The PSD of futibatinib active substance may influence the performance of the finished product as 
futibatinib is a low solubility compound. The specification for PSD for active substance is set based on 
the PSDs of batches used in clinical studies. 
The compatibility of futibatinib active substance with a range of excipients was assessed using 
mixtures of the drug substance and excipients under stress conditions in line with ICH Q8. The choice, 
characteristics and function of the excipients in the commercial formulation has been adequately 
discussed. The inclusion of SLS has been adequately justified. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Based on the Quality Target Product Profile for the finished product, appearance, identity, impurities, 
content uniformity, dissolution, assay, microbiological quality, and water content were identified as 
critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Development of the dissolution method was adequately discussed. The discriminatory power was 
demonstrated for relevant CQAs of the product. 
The manufacturing process was developed according to ICH principles and has been discussed 
extensively. The applied process is standard for this type of dosage form. The optimization of the 
process has been described as well as the development of the control strategy. 
The  primary  packaging  is  polyvinyl  chloride  PVC/PCTFE  laminated  blisters  with  aluminium  foil  lidding. 
The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: granulation, blending and lubrication, tableting, 
film-coating, lustering and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner  during  manufacture.  Formal  process  validation  will  take 
place before commercialization and an acceptable validation protocol has been provided. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
include  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological 
examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The specifications proposed for the finished product contain tests typical for this type of pharmaceutical 
form. The justifications for the proposed specification are supported by the release and stability data.  
A risk assessment on elemental impurities in line with ICH Q3D has been performed on bulk tablet 
batches and it is confirmed that levels of elemental impurities in futibatinib FCT are adequately 
controlled and no additional controls in the drug product specifications are required. 
The applicant has adequately mitigated all risks pertaining to nitrosamines. Furthermore, since Lytgobi 
has an advanced cancer indication in the scope of ICH S9, ICH Q3B limits would apply. The risk 
assessment is considered acceptable, and no specific controls are required. 
Assessment report

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 24 historical batches including 6 production scale batches of the 
proposed commercial formulation confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 36 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH), 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of finished product are representative of those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, related substances, assay, water content, 
dissolution, content uniformity and microbiological examination. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. There were no trends or significant changes to any of the measured parameters 
were observed, other than a slight increase in water content which had no impact on the other 
properties. All parameters remained within specifications.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is photostable. 
Studies  on  the  bulk  finished  product  in  bulk  packaging  were  conducted  and  the  results  justify  the 
proposed bulk storage time. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. No major objections on 
quality aspects were raised during the procedure.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Futibatinib (hereafter also referred to as TAS-120) is a novel, highly potent and selective fibroblast 
growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor developed for treatment of advanced cancers with activations 
of fibroblast growth factor/FGFR pathway including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) harbouring 
FGFR2 gene rearrangements. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
To investigate whether futibatinib inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4, the IC50 values of 
futibatinib against these FGFRs were determined using in vitro assays. The cytoplasmic domains of 
recombinant human FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 proteins, expressed as N-terminal glutathione 
S-transferase-fusion proteins, were used as enzymes. Futibatinib inhibited the activity of all 4 types of 
FGFR: the mean (± standard deviation) IC50 values of futibatinib against human FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 
and FGFR4 were calculated to be 1.8 ± 0.4, 1.4 ± 0.3, 1.6 ± 0.1, and 3.7 ± 0.4 nmol/L, respectively. 
The effect of futibatinib on cell proliferation was investigated using a panel of 7 human cancer cell lines 
with various genetic alterations of FGFRs. After exposure of cells to futibatinib for 3 days, cell viability 
was determined by quantitation of ATP and the half maximal cell growth-inhibitory concentration (GI50) 
values were calculated. Futibatinib potently inhibited the in vitro proliferation of SNU-16 cells (gastric 
cancer), MFM-223 cells (breast cancer), DMS 114 cells (lung cancer), AN3 CA cells (endometrial 
cancer), and RT4 cells (urinary bladder cancer) with GI50 values of 1.40 ± 0.19, 1.07 ± 0.04,  
2.22 ± 0.61, 3.65 ± 0.48, and 10.3 ± 4.2 nmol/L, respectively. In contrast, MKN45 (gastric cancer) 
and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cells had no genetic alterations of FGFR and the cell growth of these cell 
lines was not inhibited by futibatinib. 
To evaluate the effect of futibatinib on mutant forms of FGFR2 in comparison with ATP-competitive 
inhibitors, 4 mutant forms of FGFR2 (N550H, V565I, E566G, and K660M) were constructed and 
subsequently transfected into HEK293 cells. Then, the effect of futibatinib on FGFR2 
autophosphorylation was determined by phospho-FGFR2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Futibatinib showed potent inhibitory activity against all mutants tested, with IC50 values (mean ± 
standard deviation) of 12 ± 5 nmol/L for N550H, 8.4 ± 3.1 nmol/L for V565I, 5.5 ± 4.7 nmol/L for 
E566G, and 9.2 ± 7.0 nmol/L for K660M, which was similar to its inhibitory potency against wild-type 
FGFR2 (3.1 ± 1.3 nmol/L). 
In contrast, the inhibitory potency of ATP-competitive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 against these FGFR2 
mutant forms was reduced compared with wild-type FGFR, whereas ATP-competitive inhibitor BGJ398 
demonstrated limited activity only against the mutant FGFR forms V565I and K660M. 
The antitumour effects of futibatinib were evaluated in vivo using two animal models with 
subcutaneously implanted human cancer cells with FGFR2 mutation or amplification. 
In the first in vivo study, the antitumour effect of futibatinib was evaluated using nude mice implanted 
with the human endometrial carcinoma cell line AN3 CA, expressing FGFR2 with K310R and N549K 
point mutations. AN3 CA fresh tumour fragments were subcutaneously implanted into female nude 
mice. Futibatinib was administered orally once daily for 11 days at doses of 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day. 
No deaths, 10% or greater losses of body weight, or other clinical observations caused by futibatinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 21/118 
 
 
 
were observed in any of the futibatinib dose groups. Therefore, these doses of futibatinib were deemed 
tolerable. Relative tumour volumes (volume at day 12/ volume at day 1) in all of the futibatinib dose 
groups were significantly lower than the control group. The relative tumour volume values in the 5, 15 
and 50 mg/kg/day groups were 8.5%, 5.9% and 3.1%, respectively, whereas untreated mice showed 
38% relative tumour volume. These results indicate antitumour activity of futibatinib in this model. In 
addition, the effect of futibatinib on FGFR-related signals in AN3 CA xenografts was evaluated in AN3 
CA xenograft tumours following single-dose administration of futibatinib at 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg in nude 
mice. The tumour samples were collected 3 and 6 hours after dosing and were homogenized and 
protein lysates were then extracted from the tissues. The protein expression levels of FGFR2, FRS2, 
AKT and ERK, and the phosphorylation levels of FGFR, FRS2, AKT and ERK were determined by 
Western blot. The expression levels of total proteins as FGFR2, FRS2, AKT and ERK were nearly the 
same among all samples. Phosphorylation of FGFR, FRS2 and ERK was decreased dose-dependently 
until 6 hours after futibatinib administration. Phosphorylation of AKT was decreased slightly after 3 
hours, but not after 6 hours. 
In a second in vivo study, the antitumour effect of futibatinib was evaluated using nude rats injected 
subcutaneously with the human gastric carcinoma cell line SNU-16 carrying the amplified FGFR2 gene. 
Futibatinib was administered orally once daily for 14 days at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg/day. No 
deaths, 20% or greater losses of body weight, or other clinical observations caused by futibatinib were 
observed in any of the futibatinib administration groups. Therefore, these doses of futibatinib were 
deemed tolerable. After 14 days of dosing, the relative tumour volume values in the 2.5, 5 and 
10 mg/kg/day groups were 1.4%, 1.9%, and 1.2%, respectively, whereas untreated mice showed 
3.6% relative tumour volume. Statistically significant decreases in relative tumour volume growth were 
observed for all three dose levels when compared to control rats. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The selectivity of futibatinib for FGFRs over other protein kinases was explored in vitro using  
287 various human serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases other than FGFRs. This selectivity 
profiling was run with a futibatinib concentration of 100 nmol/L. The test concentration of 100 nM is 
regarded well chosen as it is sufficiently exceeding the human unbound Cmax of ~28 nM futibatinib. 
All kinases except one showed inhibition ≤30% at 100 nmol/L, not indicative of a concern (although 
Sootome et al in 2020 reported that MAPKAPK2 and CK1α also were inhibited >30% by futibatinib). 
Only RET kinase (S891A mutation) was inhibited by >70% at 100 nmol/L. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
hERG channel transfected HEK293 cells were exposed to 0, 1, 10 and 30 μmol/L of futibatinib to 
evaluate the effects on hERG current. No suppression of the hERG current was observed at 1 μmol/L, 
but the hERG current was significantly suppressed at 10 and 30 μmol/L (the relative peak tail currents 
were 41.6% and 16.6%, respectively). The concentration where no significant effect was observed (1 
µM) was ~35-fold higher than the free fraction of futibatinib observed at Cmax in human volunteers 
(~28 nM), indicating that no effects are to be expected in humans. 
Four increasing doses of futibatinib were administered orally once a week at 0, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg to 
conscious male Beagle dogs with an implanted telemetry device. The animals’ blood pressures 
(systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure), heart rate, electrocardiographic parameters (PR interval, 
QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc interval) and respiration rate were measured before administration 
and at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after administration. Futibatinib was not considered to have an effect on 
the cardiovascular system in conscious dogs up to 10 mg/kg. The Cmax values on day 1 in a 4-week

in dog). Therefore, the findings from this cardiovascular study indicate that no effects are to be 
expected in humans, where the free fraction at Cmax for MRHD was ~28 nM. 
With regard to the effects of futibatinib in the central nervous system, futibatinib was administered 
orally once to male rats (Crl:CD[SD]) at 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg; and the effects on general condition 
and behavior were evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after administration using the functional 
observational battery method. Futibatinib was considered to have no effect on the central nervous 
system in rats after a single oral dose of up to 30 mg/kg. The average Cmax values on day 1 in a 
4 week rat toxicology study with 30 mg/kg dosing for both sexes was 1005 ng/mL (2402 nM), 
corresponding to a free fraction of ~103 nM (using 95.7% plasma protein binding in rat). Therefore, 
the findings from this central nervous system study indicate that no effects are to be expected in 
humans, where the free fraction at Cmax for MRHD was ~28 nM. 
The effects of futibatinib on the respiratory system were investigated by orally dosing male rats 
(Crl:CD[SD]) once at 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, and the effects on the respiratory system (respiration 
frequency, tidal volume, and minute volume) were evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after 
administration. Futibatinib was considered to have no effect on the respiratory system in rats after a 
single oral dose of up to 30 mg/kg. The average Cmax values on day 1 in a 4-week rat toxicology study 
with 30 mg/kg dosing for both sexes was 1005 ng/mL (2402 nM), corresponding to a free fraction of 
~103 nM (using 95.7% plasma protein binding in rat). Therefore, the findings from this respiratory 
study indicate that no effects are to be expected in humans, where the free fraction at Cmax for MRHD 
was ~28 nM. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were provided. This is agreed, as it is expected that no other FGFR-modulating drugs will be 
used during futibatinib treatment. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Futibatinib (TAS-120) was investigated in a range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
toxicokinetic (TK) studies in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and Beagle dogs, which are the nonclinical 
safety species. These studies were conducted to define the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) of futibatinib. Oral administration, which is the route of clinical administration, was 
selected for the pharmacokinetic studies in animals. Data from these studies were used to characterize 
the PK and TK properties of futibatinib to support nonclinical toxicology evaluations. 
2.5.3.1.  Methods of analysis 
Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were employed to 
analyse plasma samples from both GLP and non-GLP nonclinical studies in rat and dog. In general, 
heparin plasma was deproteinized using acetonitrile, centrifuged and in the supernatant futibatinib and 
an internal standard (futibatinib-D6) were analysed with a Sciex API 4000 LC-MS-MS equipped with an 
HPLC column. The analytical range (LLOQ – ULOQ) for plasma samples was 2.0 to 1000 ng/mL. The 
bioanalytical methods met all validation criteria with respect to intra- and inter-day accuracy, 
precision, sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility, matrix effect and stability (up to 92 d). Incurred sample 
reproducibility for nonclinical sample analysis was conducted once per method per species.

Radioactivity levels of radiolabeled compounds in samples were measured by a liquid scintillation 
counter (LSC). Quantitative whole-body autoradiography was used for the measurement of 
radioactivity levels in tissues in the distribution studies. 
2.5.3.2.  Absorption 
The PK/TK of futibatinib was studied using Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n=3/time point) following oral 
(PO) gavage daily dosing (QD) and every other day dosing (QOD), in three multiple dose safety 
studies, including a non-GLP 3 week study (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg QD; 30, 60 mg/kg QOD) in male 
rats, a 4 week GLP study (3 mg/kg QD; 3, 10, 30 mg/kg QOD) in male and female rats and a 13 week 
GLP study (1, 3, 10 mg/kg QOD) in male and female rats. The single dose PK was only studied on day 
1 of multiple dosing, which is acceptable given the fast clearance of the compound from plasma. 
Following oral administration in rats, futibatinib was quickly absorbed reaching maximal plasma 
concentration after 1 – 2 hrs, whereafter it declined quickly in a bidirectional fashion leaving ~10% in 
plasma at 8 hours after dosing. In general, Cmax and AUC0–24 values increased dose proportionally with 
increasing dose. Upon multiple dosing for 4 or 13 weeks in the rat safety studies, no apparent 
accumulation of futibatinib was found yielding similar Cmax and AUC0–24 values as on day 1. No clear 
sex differences were observed for any parameter. Distribution volume and clearance were not 
determined as no intravenous dosing was performed. Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) values were 
not determined but are expected to be less than 2 h. 
The fraction absorbed (Fpo) was not investigated in rats, however, the male SD rat excretion study 
(see section 3.2.2.5) suggests that the oral absorption in the rat is at least 65%. 
The PK/TK of futibatinib was studied using Beagle dogs following oral (PO) gavage daily dosing (QD) 
and every other day dosing (QOD), in three multiple dose safety studies, including a non-GLP 3 week 
study (5, 10 and 30 mg/kg QD; 10, 30 mg/kg QOD, n=2) in male dogs, a 4 week GLP study (0.3, 
3 mg/kg QD; 1, 3, 10 mg/kg QOD, n=3-5) in male and female dogs and a 13 week GLP study (0.3, 1, 
3 mg/kg QOD, n=3) in male and female dogs. The single dose PK was only studied on day 1 of 
multiple dosing, which is acceptable given the fast clearance of the compound from plasma. 
Following oral administration in dogs, futibatinib was quickly absorbed reaching maximal plasma 
concentration after 1 – 2 hrs, whereafter it declined quickly in a bidirectional fashion leaving ~10% in 
plasma at 8 hours after dosing. In general, Cmax and AUC0–24 values increased dose proportionally with 
increasing dose. Upon multiple dosing for 4 or 13 weeks in the dogs safety studies, no apparent 
accumulation of futibatinib was found yielding similar Cmax and AUC0–24 values as on day 1. No clear 
sex differences were observed in any parameter. Distribution volume and clearance were not 
determined as no intravenous dosing was performed. Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) values were 
not determined but are expected be less than 2 h. 
After a single oral administration of [14C]futibatinib (10 mg/kg) to fasting male Beagle dogs (n=3), 
absorption was fast yielding a Tmax at 1.7 - 2 h, whereafter it declined quickly in a bidirectional fashion 
leaving 41% and 16% in blood and plasma, respectively, at 8 hours after dosing. Thereafter, however, 
radioactivity was eliminated very slowly, displaying a terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) of 214 hrs and 
146 hrs for blood and plasma, respectively, yielding after 168 hrs still 19% and 2.6% of Cmax present. 
2.5.3.3.  Distribution 
Protein binding studies with futibatinib were performed in vitro with plasma from human, dog, rat and 
mouse at 0.2, 1 and 5 µM using an equilibrium dialysis method and determined by LC-MS/MS. Plasma 
protein binding of futibatinib was ~91.2% in dog, 96.3% in mouse, 95.7% in rat and 95.3% in human

plasma. Futibatinib had a similar binding affinity to human serum albumin (90%) as to alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein (86%). This means that the unbound futibatinib concentration (Fu) is about 2-fold higher 
in dog than in human, rat or mouse. 
The partitioning of futibatinib into plasma and blood was determined in vitro with plasma from human 
only. The blood/plasma (B/P) ratio, using 0.2, 1 and 5 µM futibatinib concentrations, was found to be 
0.66 after 5 min incubation and 0.55 after 60 min, indicating futibatinib is distributed mainly in 
plasma. 
The in vivo tissue distribution of [14C]futibatinib was investigated in the male albino SD rat and the 
partially-pigmented Long Evans rat after oral administration of 10 mg/kg (3.7 MBq/kg) using 
quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) at 1h up to 48 h (albino SD) and up to 336 h (Long 
Evans) post dosing. Tissue distribution in non-pigmented rats was generally comparable to that in the 
pigmented male rats. Following oral administration, radioactivity was quickly distributed to most 
tissues studied but was absent (albino) or very low (LE) in eyeball, brain and spinal cord. The highest 
[14C]-related radioactivity was found at 1 to 5 hours post dose. Tissue to blood ratios (T/B) were 
generally found to be <4 for all tissues during the first 5 hours post dose except in liver (13.9) small 
intestine (7.7), kidney (5.1) and adrenal (5.9). Thereafter, radioactivity decreased in most tissues but 
continued to increase in the skin and uveal tract (pigmented only, probably due to melanin binding) 
until 12 hours after administration. At 48 hours after administration, the radioactivity was relatively 
high in skin and also still present in liver, kidney, thyroid, heart, adrenal and harderian gland. At 336 
hrs post dose, radioactivity was still high in the uveal tract and retinal epithelial cells and low but 
measurable in blood, kidney, heart and skin (pigmented). 
2.5.3.4.  Metabolism 
Metabolism in vitro 
The in vitro metabolite profile of futibatinib was obtained following incubation with Sprague-Dawley rat, 
beagle dog, and human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. [14C]Futibatinib, studied at 10 µM, was 
moderately metabolized in liver microsomes (31% to 66% after 1 hr) and hepatocytes (24% to 58% 
after 2 hrs), yielding Phase I metabolites (O-demethylation, mono & di-oxidations and reductions) and 
Phase II metabolites (glutathione, cysteine or glucuronide conjugation). Seventeen metabolites (M1 to 
M17) were identified in total, and no unique metabolite was observed from human liver microsomes or 
hepatocytes that was not also formed by rat and/or dog microsomes or hepatocytes. 
In vitro metabolism studies using human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes are consistent 
with futibatinib elimination by mainly CYP3A4 and 3A5 enzymes and a minor contribution by CYP2C9 
and 2D6. The estimated contribution of rhCYPs to the total metabolism (fmCYP) in human liver 
microsomes was approximately 72% for CYP3A4, 23% for CYP3A5, 5% for CYP2C9 and 0% for 
CYP2D6. With respect to Phase II metabolism pathway, the contribution of glutathione (GSH) was 
evaluated by using human liver S9 fraction and fraction metabolized by GST (fmGST) was found to be 
minor (13%). 
Metabolism in vivo 
Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]futibatinib to male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3) 
unchanged futibatinib was the major source of radioactivity (77%) and the cysteine conjugate (M8) 
was the most abundant metabolite (13%) in plasma at 2 hr post-dose, leaving ~9.5% of label 
unaccounted. In bile (0-4 hrs post-dose), containing a quarter of the radioactive dose, unchanged 
futibatinib was not present and most of the identified excreted radioactivity was associated with M8 
(9.6%) and four metabolites, of which M2 / M24 (~3%) and M18 / M13 (~1.4%) were above 1% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 25/118 
 
 
 
the radioactive dose, while 6.7% was unknown. In faeces, containing two third of the radioactive dose, 
unchanged futibatinib was slightly present (2.3% of the radioactive dose) and most of the identified 
radioactivity was associated with M8 (7.4%), M22 (6.5%), M21+M11 (7.3%) and M24 (4.5%) 
(unknown 28%). In urine, containing about 3% of the radioactive dose, unchanged futibatinib was not 
present and six metabolites were found, of which M24 (1%) was the largest and the other five (M21, 
M11, M23, M13, M14) were below 1% of the radioactive dose. 
Following a single oral administration of 10 mg/kg [14C]futibatinib to male Beagle dogs (n=3), 
unchanged futibatinib was the major source of circulating radioactivity (84.6%) and the cysteine 
conjugate (M8) was the most abundant metabolite (8%) in plasma at 1 hr post-dose, leaving 7.4% of 
label unaccounted. [14C]Futibatinib was metabolized by both phase I and phase II biotransformation. 
In faeces, containing ~80% of the radioactive dose, unchanged futibatinib was present (28% of the 
radioactive dose) and most of the identified radioactivity was associated with M8 (13.7%), M19 
(4.3%), M10 (4.0%) and M20 (3.0%) (unknown 23%). In urine, containing about 0.7% of the 
radioactive dose, unchanged futibatinib was not present and two metabolites were found, which all 
(M8, M20) were below 0.4% of the radioactive dose. 
In summary, in both rat and dog [14C] futibatinib was metabolized by both phase I (O-demethylation, 
mono- or di-oxidation, hydration) and phase II (cysteine or N-acetylcysteine conjugation, sulfation, 
glucuronidation) biotransformation. 
In human, an AME study (CLN01) indicated that unchanged futibatinib was the main component (59%) 
present in plasma, while P7 (a cysteinylglycine conjugate) was identified as a major circulating 
metabolite in plasma accounting for 13.4% of the total radioactivity. In addition, P1 (a glucuronide of a 
mono-oxidized product, named as M18 in rat and dog), and P5 (named as M8 in rat and dog) were also 
found in human plasma, accounting for 9% and 8.7% of total radioactivity, respectively. P5 (M8) was 
the main metabolite detected in rat and dog plasma and also found in their faeces. P1 (M18) was found 
in rat bile, but at low levels. P7, however, which is the major metabolite in human plasma, was not 
detected in rat or dog plasma and also not present in faeces, bile or urine. 
2.5.3.5.  Excretion 
The excretion of radioactivity was investigated in fasting male SD rats (intact and Bile Duct 
Cannulated) and Beagle dogs (n=3) after a single oral dose of [14C]futibatinib (10 mg/kg). The 
excretion of radioactivity was predominantly through the faecal (biliary) pathway and, for the intact 
rat, and dog, it accounted after five days for 92% and 99% of the radioactivity dose, while the urinary 
route contributed 4.8% and 1.3%. The total recovery of radioactivity, two days after dosing, was high 
in the rat (95%) and dog (99%). Excretion to expired air was not found in the rat. 
In bile duct-cannulated rats, at two days following oral administration, excretion into the bile and urine 
was 61% and 4.8% of the radioactivity dose, respectively, indicating a predominant biliary clearance. 
The recovery data indicate that the fraction absorbed upon oral administration was at least 0.65. 
In conclusion, following oral administration, futibatinib was primarily cleared upon metabolism via 
biliary excretion and faecal elimination in the tested preclinical species (rat and dog). Renal clearance 
plays a lesser role.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies with futibatinib were not performed. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Pivotal 4-weeks and 13-weeks repeat dose toxicity (RDT) studies were preceded by non-GLP range 
finding studies in both rat and dog. Lot KMBH271 was used for all repeat dose toxicology studies. 
Every other day treatment was generally better tolerated than daily treatment. Higher doses (>20 
mg/kg) pivotal 4-weeks and 13-weeks RDT studies were preceded by non-GLP range finding studies in 
both rat and dog. Lot KMBH271 was used for all repeat dose toxicology studies. Every other day 
treatment was generally better tolerated than daily treatment. Higher doses (>20 mg/kg) in the dose 
range finding (DRF) studies were poorly tolerated leading to moribundity in both rats and dogs. In the 
DRF studies, main drug-related effects in rats were increased inorganic phosphorus (IP) and calcium in 
plasma, ectopic mineralisation, bone and cartilage lesions and increased corneal lesions, likely as a 
result of FGFR inhibition. In dogs, increased plasma IP, ectopic mineralisation in aortic root and bone 
and cartilage changes were observed. The comparable toxicity profile was also confirmed in the pivotal 
repeat dose toxicity studies. 
In all pivotal studies a severely toxic dose could be identified. There is no appreciable clinical exposure 
multiple even for the severe toxic dose that has been established in the pivotal toxicology studies. It is 
considered that findings in the lowest dose groups of these studies, irrespective of the dosing schedule, 
are also adverse. Therefore, a NOAEL was not established. 
In the pivotal 4-week and 13-week toxicology studies in rats and dogs, no mortality was observed 
during the treatment window or in the recovery period. Every other day (QOD) administration was 
better tolerated than daily administration (QD). Nevertheless, comparable and severe toxicity was still 
observed with the QOD administration schedule albeit at higher doses. 
In rats, males appeared to be more sensitive to effects of futibatinib although no pharmacokinetic 
differences are apparent. Nevertheless, most toxicologically relevant findings were also observed in 
females at higher doses. In the 4-week study, decreased body weight gain was observed in male 
animals receiving 30 mg/kg futibatinib. Increased urinary calcium and inorganic phosphate was noted 
from 3 mg/kg onwards, but IP was increased in females from 10 mg/kg onwards. Target organs of 
toxicity in rat were eye (increased corneal opacity, secondary to corneal mineralisation), bone and 
cartilage and various organ tissues including heart and vasculature as a result of ectopic 
mineralization. Ectopic mineralisation was consistently observed in both males and females at all doses 
and tissues including aortic artery and arterial wall in the heart; arterial wall, cortex, and medulla in 
the kidney; arterial wall, alveolar wall, and bronchioles in the lung; arterial wall, mucosa, and muscle 
in the stomach; meninx in the spinal cord; arterial wall in the tongue and submucosa; and muscle in 
the trachea. Mineralisation in heart of males from 10 mg/kg and in females from 30 mg/kg was 
considered a severe toxicological finding. Except for the conjunctiva in the eye and mucosa in the 
glandular stomach, ectopic mineralisation was non-recoverable. Bone lesions were observed in males 
from 3 mg/kg onwards and in females from 10 mg/kg onwards, including thickening of growth plate, 
increased secondary spongiosa with cartilage material, abnormal ossification of the cortical bone, 
thickening of the joint cartilage, and decreased osteoblasts. Thickening of the cartilage in the sternum 
was observed. A NOAEL was not established. A severely toxic dose (STD10) was determined for QOD 
dosing of 10 mg/kg based on the cardiac mineralisation. There is no exposure multiple as this 
exposure corresponds to approximately the clinical exposure. Exposures up to 14-weeks did not lead to 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 27/118 
 
 
 
a further exacerbation of the findings in the short term study and confirmed the previously observed 
toxicities. In the 13-week study, 10 mg/kg was also considered to be the STD10, and a NOAEL was not 
established.  
In the 4-week dog study, dogs received 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg futibatinib every other day or 0.3 and 
3 mg/kg every day. No deaths occurred during the study or in the recovery period. Body weight loss 
was observed in the 3 mg/kg QD only, which correlated with decreased food consumption. Gross 
pathology revealed white focus in the aortic root in all animals in the 3 mg/kg QD group and one male 
in the 10 mg/kg QOD group. Absolute and relative spleen weights were increased in the 3 mg/kg QD 
group. Mineralisation of various tissues was observed, which included mineralization of the coronary 
artery and endocardium in the heart; arterial wall, papillary, and capsule in the kidney; bronchus in the 
lung; mucosa and muscularis mucosa in the stomach; or arterial wall in the urinary bladder at 1 mg/kg 
in the QOD groups and at 0.3 mg/kg in the QD groups. Decreased cartilage ossification was observed 
in femur and sternum of all test-article related groups. All findings were reversible with exception of 
ectopic mineralisation of the arterial wall in the aortic root, arterial wall in the heart, mucosa and 
muscularis mucosa in the stomach, and arterial wall in the urinary bladder. A NOAEL was not 
established in this study, and white focus in the aortic root, which correlated with mineralisation in the 
arterial wall, decreased locomotor activity, body weight loss associated with decreased food 
consumption were considered severe toxicities. Based on the findings, a non-severely toxic dose of 
3 mg/kg QOD or 0.3 mg/kg QD was established. 
The 13-week dog study, in which animals received 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg futibatinib every other day, 
confirmed the findings of the 4-week study. Severe toxicity was identified as mineralisation of the 
aortic root at the highest dose tested, 3 mg/kg. There is no clinical exposure multiple at this dose. 
Notably, the white focus that was observed previously was absent in this study. Other toxicologically 
relevant findings that were not previously observed included cell infiltration in arterial walls of the 
aortic root in males at 0.3 and 3 mg/kg; oedema and cell infiltration of the tunica intima and 
haemorrhage of arterial walls of the aortic root in males and females at 1 and 3 mg/kg; bone lesions of 
the femur (i.e., elongation of the proliferating zone, hypertrophic zone, and primary spongiosa, 
increased trabecular bone, and hypercellularity [including bone marrow]) in both sexes at 0.3 mg/kg; 
and bone lesions of the sternum (i.e., elongation of proliferating zone, thinning of hypertrophic zone, 
and hypercellularity, including in bone marrow) in both sexes from 0.3 mg/kg onwards. Considering 
the absence of a NOAEL, and the STD falling within clinical exposure, all findings are considered to be 
clinically relevant. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Futibatinib did not increase revertant colonies in a panel of salmonella and E.coli strains. However, in 
mammalian cells (CHL/IU cells), in presence or absence of metabolic activation, frequencies of cells 
with structural chromosome aberrations frequencies were dose dependently increased compared to 
controls. At lower doses there was also an increased frequency of structural chromosomal aberration, 
but this change was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of statistically significantly 
increased polyploidy. Therefore, futibatinib is considered to induce chromosomal aberrations in 
mammalian cells. A micronucleus test in rats receiving up to 300 mg/kg futibatinib did not reveal an 
increase in frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes. In contrast, the positive control mitomycin C 
markedly increased the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes. Therefore, futibatinib is not 
considered to be clastogenic in rats. A comet assay was performed to evaluate the potential to induce 
DNA damage. Rats received up to 300 mg/kg futibatinib. No change in percentage of the tail DNA was 
observed compared to the negative control group receiving the vehicle. In contrast, administration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 28/118 
 
 
 
the positive control, ethylmethanesulfonate, resulted in a marked increase in tail DNA. Therefore, 
futibatinib is not considered to induce DNA damage in rats. 
Based on the negative results of the AMES and in vivo micronucleus and COMET assays in rat, 
futibatinib is not a genotoxicant. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies with futibatinib have not been conducted. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In line with ICH S9, no fertility, PPND or juvenile animals studies were performed. An EFD dose range 
finding study revealed considerable maternal toxicity from the lowest dose (1 mg/kg/day) onward, 
leading to low foetal body weight or total litter loss in the 10 mg/kg dose group. In the 1 mg/kg group, 
all foetuses were recoded as having anomalies. Subsequently, the GLP EFD study used doses below 
1 mg/kg. 
In the GLP EFD study, pregnant rats received 0.05, 0.15, or 0.5 mg/kg/day between GD7 and GD17. 
All dams survived to the end of the study. No treatment related changes were observed in clinical 
observations, body weight, food consumption, necropsy findings, and caesarean sections such as the 
number of corpora lutea and implantation, the rate of pre-implantation loss, implantation, and post-
implantation loss in any group. In dams, the NOAEL was considered to be 0.5 mg/kg/day. A NOAEL for 
foetuses could not be established. Foetal body weight was decreased in the high dose group, which 
correlated to delayed ossification. Visceral and skeletal anomalies were observed in all dose groups, 
including in heart and vasculature, were observed at all doses. Therefore, futibatinib is teratogenic in 
rats at clinically relevant doses. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
For rat, increases in futibatinib dose resulted in dose-proportional increases in AUC values (except for 
doses >10 mg/kg QOD. In dog, dose-proportional increases in AUC were observed for all QOD doses 
except the highest dose of 10 mg/kg. No evidence of accumulation was observed for both species. In 
the 13-weeks rat study, the exposure multiples ranged from 0.14-1.6 for AUC values. In the 13-weeks 
dog study, exposure multiples based on AUC values ranged from 0.064-0.76. It can therefore be 
concluded that the exposures obtained were below the values observed in humans, which indicates 
that the effects observed in animals could be clinically relevant. 
Interspecies comparison 
The in vivo PK/TK studies with futibatinib were conducted via oral administration, which is the intended 
route of administration in humans, in rats and dogs, which were used for toxicology studies. 
In all species oral absorption was fast and maximal exposure was reached in plasma after 1 – 2h (rat, 
dog), whereafter it declined quickly leaving ~10% in plasma at 8 hours after dosing. With increasing 
doses in rats and dogs, the exposure (Cmax and AUC0–24) of futibatinib was generally dose proportional 
as was also found in human. No differences were seen between males or females. Upon multiple 
dosing for 4 or 13 weeks in the safety studies, no apparent accumulation of futibatinib was found 
yielding similar Cmax and AUC0–24 values as on day 1. Oral bioavailability was not determined but based 
on the mass balance study in the rat, it was estimated to be at least 65%. Terminal elimination half-
life (t1/2) values were not determined but are estimated to be less than 2h. 
Assessment report

Page 29/118 
 
 
 
In plasma, a high protein binding was found (95.7% in rat, 95.3% in human; 91.2% in dog). This 
means that the unbound futibatinib concentration (Fu) is about 2-fold higher in dog than in human or 
rat. A similar metabolism was seen in rat, dog and human, such as O-demethylation, mono- or 
di-oxidation, hydration, and Phase II (cysteine or N-acetylcysteine conjugation) conversion. The 
excretion of futibatinib was found to be largely (>90%) via the biliary/faecal route, as numerous phase 
I and/or phase II metabolites. Renal excretion was minor route in rat (4.8%), dog (1.3%) and human 
(6%).

The experimentally determined log Kow is below 4.5. The refined PECsw is 0.0000048 µg/L, which is 
below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A phase II ERA is not deemed necessary. Futibatinib is considered 
not PBT nor vPvB. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Pharmacology studies showed that the mechanism of action for futibatinib includes inhibition of 
FGFR1-4 with high affinity (as opposed to other FGFR inhibitors that inhibit FGFR1-3), indicating that 
futibatinib is a potent inhibitor of FGFRs. This inhibition translated into inhibition of growth of various 
cancer cell lines harbouring different FGFR genetic alterations, whereas growth of cancer lines without 
FGFR genetic alterations was not inhibited, indicating that futibatinib is a selective compound, which 
may be used for treatment of FGFR driven oncogenesis. In addition, specific FGFR2 mutations 
associated with drug resistance were potently inhibited by futibatinib, whereas other FGFR inhibitors 
(competing for the ATP-binding site as opposed to futibatinib covalent binding to FGFRs) showed less

potent inhibition, indicating futibatinib’s potency against tumours that are resistant to other FGFR 
inhibitors. Proof of concept was shown using mice and rat studies where human FGFR2 cancer cell lines 
were implanted as xenografts. The growth of these xenografts was inhibited upon futibatinib 
administration, indicating that futibatinib is able to inhibit growth of human FGFR2 cancer cell line 
growth in vivo. To present the primary pharmacodynamics of futibatinib in cholangiocarcinoma models, 
literature was provided showing futibatinibs activity in reducing tumour volume as well as inhibition of 
downstream FGFR signalling in patient-derived xenografts from ICC patients (Ochiiwa et al, 2013, Arai 
et al, 2014 and Goyal et al, 2019). 
In order to investigate the selectivity testing of futibatinib, 287 human serine/threonine and tyrosine 
protein kinases were screened. RET kinase (S891A mutation) was inhibited by >70% at 100 nmol/L. 
This is considered to be of low clinical relevance. It is considered acceptable that only human 
serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases were screened for secondary PD effects and data 
regarding the selectivity for other classes of receptors was not provided, as the risk for (off-target) 
safety effects of futibatinib is considered low. Finally, all required safety pharmacology studies were 
performed and were negative for futibatinib-associated effects with adequate exposure multiples.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Futibatinib (TAS-120) was investigated in a range of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
toxicokinetic (TK) studies to define the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). 
The in vivo PK/TK studies were conducted via oral administration, which is the route of clinical 
administration, and with Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and Beagle dogs, which were used in the 
nonclinical toxicology studies. 
Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were adequately 
validated to analyse plasma samples from both GLP and non-GLP nonclinical studies in rat and dog. 
Analytical methods (C-AT120019 and C-AT120020) used in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs, however, are not GLP compliant. It was, however, sufficiently demonstrated that the analytical 
methods supporting GLP repeat dose toxicity studies were adequately validated, as these were in 
compliance with domestic reliability standards. Moreover, performance parameters met the pre-defined 
acceptance criteria, set out by EMA Guideline on Analytical Methods ICHS3A. 
During the procedure, the applicant was requested to discuss the possible nature of the 
[14C]futibatinib-related label present for prolonged time (T1/2 >200h) in dog as in humans, and the 
possible relevance for clinical safety of futibatinib. It was indicated that this may be due to the covalent 
binding characteristics of the acrylamide moiety, displaying to a minor extent, also off-target binding 
to blood and plasma proteins, such as the formation of albumin- and haemoglobin-adducts, and this 
phenomenon was also observed in humans. This is considered a reasonable explanation for the slow 
elimination of the [14C]futibatinib-related label as this was also found with other irreversible tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors, acting via the same acrylamide active site. It is, therefore, agreed that the risk for 
related clinical safety in humans is considered low. 
The in vitro metabolite profile of futibatinib was obtained following incubation with Sprague-Dawley rat, 
beagle dog, and human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Futibatinib was found to be moderately 
metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4/5 enzymes. 
In both rat and dog [14C]futibatinib was metabolized by phase I (O-demethylation, mono- or 
di-oxidation, hydration) and/or phase II (cysteine or N-acetylcysteine conjugation, sulfation, 
glucuronidation) biotransformation. Of the metabolites detected at 9% in human plasma, P1 was found 
as M18 in rat bile and P5 as main metabolite M8 in both rat a dog plasma. P7, a cysteinylglycine 
conjugate, which was identified as a major circulating metabolite in human plasma accounting for 
13.4% of the total radioactivity, however, was not detected in rat or dog plasma and also not present 
in faeces, bile or urine. It was indicated that the formation of a glutathione conjugate metabolite (F18 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 31/118 
 
 
 
or M9) is a primary metabolism pathway, after which the glutathione group is being degraded yielding 
the cysteinylglycine conjugate (P7) and the cysteine conjugate (P5 or M8), which can be further N-
acetylated to form the N-acetylcysteine conjugate (F20 or M24). The major human metabolite P7 
(cysteinylglycine) it is likely formed in rats and dogs as an intermediate metabolite, since M8 (cysteine 
conjugate) was detected as the major metabolite in these species. Furthermore, if the P7 metabolite is 
deconjugated, the parent compound and the cysteinylglycine moiety is formed. The parent compound 
has been toxicologically tested and the latter compound, the glutathione degradation product, is not 
considered a safety risk. Therefore, the toxicological risk of P7 is considered low. 
The excretion of [14C]futibatinib was investigated in fasting male SD rats (intact and Bile Duct 
Cannulated, BDC) and Beagle dogs and was found to be largely (>90%) cleared via the biliary/faecal 
route and mainly, as numerous phase I and/or phase II metabolites. Renal excretion was minor route 
in rat (4.8%), dog (1.3%) and human (6%). 
Toxicology 
Repeat-dose toxicology studies were performed in rats and dogs. In the pivotal 4-week and 13-week 
toxicology studies, no mortality was observed during the treatment window or in the recovery period. 
Every other day (QOD) administration was better tolerated than daily administration (QD). 
Nevertheless, comparable and severe toxicity was still observed with the QOD administration schedule 
albeit at higher doses. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed ectopic mineralisation of multiple tissues, particularly 
arterial walls, and aortic artery, which was the primary driver of severe toxicity in both rats and dogs. 
Other findings included increased inorganic phosphorus and calcium in plasma and lesions in 
bone/cartilage. These effects were reversible with the exception of ectopic mineralization. Corneal 
lesions were only observed in rats. The severely toxic dose was comparable to the clinical exposure. 
Therefore, all findings in the toxicology studies must be considered as clinically relevant. Futibatinib 
was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. It was positive in the in 
vitro chromosome aberration test in cultured Chinese hamster lung cell (CHL/IU), but negative in the 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in rat and didn’t induce DNA damage in comet assay in rats. Thus, 
futibatinib is overall non-genotoxic (see SmPC section 5.3).  
To explain the broader TAS-120 systemic toxicity, it was justified that FGF plays a crucial role in the 
regulation of both systemic calcium and phosphate homeostasis with FGFR. In particular, FGF23 (a 
member of a subfamily of FGFs that acts as hormones/ systemic factors) plays an essential role in 
absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract, reabsorption of calcium and phosphate in the kidney 
and osteogenic regulation in the bone (Shimada et al, 2001; Quarles et al., 2008). As extracellular 
phosphate had been known to be necessary for matrix mineralization, the TAS-120 systemic 
toxicological findings such as increases in Ca and IP, ectopic mineralization of the heart and abnormal 
bone metabolism are deemed to be associated by imbalance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis 
induced by the pharmacological action of TAS-120 through FGFR23 (Xu et al., 2012).  
Dedicated fertility studies with futibatinib have not been conducted. In repeat dose toxicity studies, 
oral administration of futibatinib did not result in any dose-related findings likely to result in impaired 
fertility in male or female reproductive organs. 
Based on the mechanism of action and observed embryo-foetal toxicity in an animal study, futibatinib 
can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant women should be advised of 
the potential risk to the foetus. An effective method of contraception should be used in women of 
childbearing potential and in men with women partners of childbearing potential during treatment with 
Lytgobi and for 1 week following completion of therapy, barrier methods should be applied as a second

form of contraception to avoid pregnancy. A pregnancy test should be performed before treatment 
initiation to exclude pregnancy (see SmPC sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6). 
Futibatinib is not indicated for paediatric use. There was no assessment of the translatability of toxicity 
observed in adult animals. Juvenile animal studies were not conducted. 
In accordance with ICH S9, carcinogenicity studies are not required for oncology treatments for 
patients with terminal cancer, the intended target population of futibatinib. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
Futibatinib PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

have been adequately addressed.

Table 2. Futibatinib clinical pharmacology studies supporting registration.
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of futibatinib has been characterized in 10 studies (Table 2), 7 studies in healthy 
volunteers, 2 studies in patients with advanced solid tumours, and 1 study in subjects with hepatic 
impairment. The healthy volunteer studies addressed the relative bioavailability of the final tablet 
formulation, food effect, mass balance and metabolite profile and potential for drug-drug interactions 
with futibatinib and cardiac safety. The PK study in subjects with impaired hepatic function was 
finalised and the report submitted during the assessment period. The primary efficacy data supporting 
this submission was based on clinical data from the pivotal Phase 1/2 Study TPU-TAS-120-101. In 
addition to the 10 clinical studies, 3 reports on population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response 
analyses, and PBPK to support drug-drug interactions have been submitted. 
Further, in vitro studies with human biomaterials included assessments of membrane permeability 
(20DB01), plasma protein binding, blood-to-plasma concentration ratio (Rb) (16DA16), metabolism 
(18DB26, 19DB06, and TDM22BRT010P), and potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) (16DA10,

18DB18, and XT133007). In vitro activity of primary circulating metabolites in human plasma was also 
assessed (Study CBS-200034). 
The starting dose of futibatinib is 20 mg once daily. The tablets can be taken with or without food, 
however, dietary restrictions that limit phosphate intake is recommended as part of 
hyperphosphatemia management. 
A single strength (4 mg) was developed for commercialization, as this strength allows the flexibility for 
dose adjustment from the recommended dose of 20 mg QD for the management of toxicities. 
Methods  
Bioanalytical methods (reports JCL10391451, 8291169, CA28028-01) 
Validated methods were used to analyse futibatinib in human plasma treated with K2EDTA 
anticoagulant by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LCMS/MS) 
by three different testing facilities. Cross-validation between testing facilities was not conducted. 
Calibration standard, QC sample, and ISR data indicated that the analytical methods performed 
acceptably during the bioanalytical studies. Samples were analysed within the established long term 
stability periods.  
PopPK analysis (Report TONC-PMX-TAS120-1718) 
PopPK analysis was conducted to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of futibatinib and to 
evaluate exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety to support dose selection of futibatinib 
in adult subjects with CCA harbouring FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) aberrations  
PopPK development and reporting was in line with the recommendations in the guideline on reporting 
the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses CHMP/EWP/185990/06. The PK of futibatinib 
following oral administration was described by a two-compartment model combined with sequential 
zero- and first-order absorption and first-order elimination (Table 3). Random effects included inter-
individual variability (IIV) on the apparent clearance (CL/F), the apparent central volume of distribution 
(Vc/F), and duration of the zero-order input (D1) on the F.  
- 
- 
Serum albumin and futibatinib dose ≥36 mg were found to be significant predictors of CL/F.  
Body weight and futibatinib dose ≥36 mg were found to be significant predictors of Vc/F.  
The relative oral bioavailability was impacted by the following factors: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Reduced to 39% in subjects concomitantly on cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) inducers (rifampin). 
Increased by 30% in subjects concomitantly on CYP3A inhibitors (itraconazole). 
Reduced to 43% in subjects in Study 10059020 in Japanese healthy volunteers (removed in 
sensitivity analysis Run085s). 
Reduced to 77% in subjects in Study TAS-120-101, TAS-120-102, or TAS-120-107, respectively, 
compared to subjects in Studies TAS-120-103, 104, 105, or 10059010. Observed differences 
between studies could not be attributed to subject-specific covariates, such as healthy status, 
race, formulation or food. A sensitivity analysis Run85s has been conducted without study as 
factor on relative bioavailability (Table 3).

The presence of food reduced ka to 17.7% of the ka under the fasted condition.

PcVPCs suggests an acceptable fit, adequately capturing the central tendency and range of the data, 
although the median absorption peak was slightly lower for the model predictions.  
PBPK modelling studies 20DC01 & 20DC09 
In study 20DC01 a PBPK model of futibatinib was developed to predict effects of coadministration of 
various inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A on the plasma exposure of futibatinib after multiple 
administrations in cancer patients. In study 20DC09, the inhibitory effect of futibatinib on the 
transporters P-gp and BCRP was evaluated using a population-based PBPK software Simcyp® version 
19 release 1. 
A middle out PBPK development was selected using data from studies TAS-120-103, 104 and 106 for 
model development. The values of ka, lag time, and Kp scalar were updated by parameter estimation 
using clinical PK data after single administration of futibatinib alone in the Study TAS-120-104. 
Subsequently, CLint for CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and additional hepatic clearance were refined based 
on the sensitivity analysis on fmCYP3A4 and subsequent retrograde model analysis. It was assumed 
that Pgp was not relevant in the absorption of futibatinib. 
The model verification with multiple dose data from patients and healthy subjects (study TAS-120-
105), effect of rifampicin (TAS-120-103), and food effect study (TAS-120-102) and sensitivity analyses 
showed that the PBPK model for futibatinib describes well the pharmacokinetic profile of futibatinib in 
healthy subjects and in cancer patients from study TAS-120-101. Futibatinib exposures are predicted 
to be somewhat higher in patients than in healthy subjects. 
The model was then applied to predict the effect of various CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on futibatinib 
PK after multiple administrations in cancer patients. 
In study 20DC09, the effect of coadministration of futibatinib on the plasma exposure of digoxin, a 
P-gp substrate, and rosuvastatin, a BCRP substrate, in healthy subjects was predicted using a 
population-based PBPK. The model development strategy was the same as described for study 
20DC01. In addition, for this analysis, the absorption model was changed from the first-order model to 
the advanced dissolution, absorption, and metabolism (ADAM) model using available data. Data from 
futibatinib 80 mg dose from study TAS-120-107 were used for development of the absorption model. 
The developed model for futibatinib was then verified using PK data from clinical studies (Studies 
TAS-120-102, TAS-120-106, and TAS-120-107), which were not used for the model development. 
Absorption  
In vitro solubility and permeability 
Solubility of futibatinib is pH dependent and solubility is low at ≥ pH 3. The in vitro permeability of 
futibatinib in Caco-2 cells (Study 20DB01) was concentration dependent with a lower apparent 
permeability at low dose 0.3 µM but high permeability at the higher doses of 6 and 60 µM. Futibatinib 
can be considered a low solubility, high permeability compound. 
In vivo absorption 
Single-dose mean plasma concentrations versus time profiles of futibatinib in cancer patients Study 
TAS-120-101 are shown in Figure 2. Futibatinib maximal plasma concentrations were reached within 
1-3 hours after administration. Cmax and AUC increased over the dose range of 4 mg to 24 mg. Plasma 
elimination half-life of futibatinib was 2-3 hours.  
Intersubject variability of futibatinib Cmax and AUC exposure is moderate to high, 19%-52% and 
36-68%, respectively, based on the non-compartmental analysis in healthy subjects. Intrasubject

variability was lower 19-36% for Cmax and between 16-23% for AUC (Table 5).

An absolute bioavailability study has not been conducted. 
Bioequivalence 
Two dosage forms, liquid filled hard capsules and immediate release film-coated tablets were 
developed for use in clinical studies of futibatinib. Both formulations were available at 4 mg and 20 mg 
strengths and have been used in the pivotal Phase 1/2 Study TPU-TAS-120-101. Bioequivalence 
between the capsule and tablet formulation has been demonstrated in study 10059020: the point 
estimates of the GMRs of Cmax, AUC0-48, and AUCinf were 0.99 (90% CI 0.83-1.18), 1.05 (90% CI 
0.94-1.18), and 1.09 (90% CI 0.97-1.23). 
A tablet single strength (4 mg) was developed for commercialization, as this strength provided the 
required flexibility for dose adjustment to the recommended dose of 20 mg QD. Compared to the 
tablets used in clinical studies, the commercial tablets had no colorant, which was no longer required 
to differentiate the strengths in the clinical study. The commercial tablet formulation was used in Phase 
1 (QT/QTc study TAS-120-107), and pharmacokinetics of the commercial and clinical tablet formulation 
were similar in an across study comparison.  
Food effect 
In Study TAS-120-102, futibatinib PK was assessed in 17 healthy adult subjects following a single oral 
dose of futibatinib (5 × 4 mg tablets) under fasted and fed conditions. Consumption of a high-fat and 
high-calorie meal resulted in statistically significant decreases in Cmax, and AUClast of futibatinib with 
fed:fasted ratio of 0.58 (90% CI 0.47-0.70) and 0.86 (90% CI 0.77-0.96), respectively. Tmax was 
delayed by 2.5-3 hours under fed conditions.  
Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) (CV%) following single-dose oral administration of 
futibatinib 20 mg to patients with advanced solid tumours was 73 L (32.9%) (Study TAS-120-101).  
Human plasma protein binding was determined by using the equilibrium dialysis method. Protein 
binding of futibatinib in human plasma is approximately 95% at concentrations of 0.2, 1, and 5 μmol/L 
and was primarily bound to human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein.  
Assessment report

Blood:plasma values of futibatinib varied from 0.589 to 0.664 at concentrations of 0.2, 1 and 
5 μmol/L, respectively (study 16DA16). In the mass balance study (TAS-120-106), total radioactivity 
was preferentially confined to plasma over approximately the first 6 hours post-dose as evidenced by 
mean blood:plasma ratios of 0.51 – 0.72. From 8 – 48 hours post-dose, total radioactivity distributed 
to red blood cells as evidenced by mean blood:plasma ratios of 0.85 – 1.70.

Following single-dose oral administration of futibatinib 20 mg, the mean oral clearance was 18 L/hr 
(CV% 44%) and the mean terminal elimination half-life was 2.94 hours (CV% 26.5%) (Study TAS-
120-101).  
In the mass balance study TAS-120-106, the mean elimination half-life was approximately 2.3 hours 
for plasma futibatinib, compared to half-lives of approximately 12 and 29 hours for total radioactivity in 
plasma and whole blood, respectively. 
The popPK analyses predicted a geometric mean CL/F (gCV%) in patients of 19.8 L/hr (23%) and an 
initial half-life of 2.1h (32%) and terminal half-life of 10.5h (3%) (Study TONC-PMX-TAS120-1718). 
Excretion 
Excretion of futibatinib was evaluated in the mass balance study TAS-120-106 in 6 healthy adult male 
subjects following a single oral dose of 20 mg [14C]-futibatinib oral solution (~100 μCi) under fasted 
conditions. Faecal excretion represents the major excretion pathway of futibatinib and its metabolites, 
and the urinary route is minor. Total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 77% to 85% in 5 of the 
6 subjects, but was low at 26% for Subject 6. Of the 70%±25% of the administered radioactivity 
recovered was 64%±25% as recovered in faeces: only 6%±1% of the administered radioactivity was 
recovered in urine. Futibatinib excretion into either urine or faeces in unchanged form was negligible.  
In patients with advanced solid tumours, urinary excretion of the unchanged form of futibatinib was 
less than 0.1% of administered dose following single dose administration of futibatinib (Study 
TAS-120-101 and Study 10059010). 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolite profiling of futibatinib was conducted in liver microsomes, S9 fractions and 
hepatocytes. The major metabolites in human liver microsomes were an O-demethylated product, 
mono-oxidized and hydrated products whereas in human hepatocytes the major metabolites of 
futibatinib were a cystine conjugate and a glutathione conjugate. In vitro assessments with human 
hepatic hepatocytes suggested that the contribution of CYP enzymes to hepatic metabolism of 
futibatinib was approximately 40% of which CYP3A is the primary CYP enzyme (estimated 70%) 
involved in the futibatinib metabolism (Study 19DB06). Futibatinib was stable in human blood; 
therefore, metabolizing enzymes in erythrocytes and plasma are considered to make little contribution 
to the futibatinib metabolism. 
The metabolism of futibatinib was evaluated in the mass balance study TAS-120-106 following a single 
oral dose of 20 mg (~100 μCi) [14C]-futibatinib. The main component in plasma was futibatinib parent 
compound (59.19%). A cysteinylglycine conjugate (TAS-06-22952), cysteine conjugate (TAS-06-
22947), and a glucuronide conjugate of mono-oxidized product accounted for 13.37%, 8.68%, and 
8.97% of the radioactivity in the plasma sample, respectively. On the other hand, in the faeces 
samples, O-demethylated metabolites (a di-O-demethylated, mono-oxidized and hydrogenated 
product, a di-O-demethylated and hydrogenated product, an O-demethylated, hydrated and 
hydrogenated product, and an O-demethylated and hydrogenated product) existed at the higher level 
compared to a glutathione conjugate and its derivatives (an N-acetylcysteine conjugate of mono-

oxidized product and an N-acetylcysteine conjugate) (29% vs. 8% of the dose). Futibatinib was 
negligible in the faeces and urine samples. 
The two primary circulating metabolites in human plasma a cysteinylglycine conjugate (TAS-06-22952) 
and a cysteine conjugate (TAS-06-22947) showed no in vitro activity (Study CBS-200034). 
Futibatinib has an asymmetric centre but no racemization is observed. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of pharmacokinetics of futibatinib following single dose and multiple dose 
administration was evaluated in patients in studies TAS-120-101 and 10059010 following a QD 
schedule over the dose range 4-24 mg futibatinib (Table 4) or QOD schedule over the dose range 
8-200 mg. Cmax and AUC0-last increased dose proportional over the dose range 4-24 mg. For the QOD 
dosing schedule (range 8-200 mg), Cmax increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in the 
dose range of 8 to 200 mg while AUCs increased dose-proportionally. 
Table 4. PK Parameters of futibatinib in plasma for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 21, QD Schedule in patients 
(Study TAS-120-101)
PopPK analysis with 203 patients who received 20 mg QD predicted the accumulation ratio (gCV%) 
was 1.03 (2.30%) and the steady state exposure was predicted to be reached after the first dose. 
Target population 
Table 5 summarises plasma futibatinib PK parameters for patients with advanced solid tumours (Study 
TAS-120-101 and Study 10059010) and healthy adult subjects (Studies 10059020, TAS-120-102, 
TAS-120-103, TAS-120-104, TAS-120-106, and TAS-120-107) following a single oral dose of 
futibatinib 20 mg. Considering the large inter-subject variability of Cmax and AUC, it is unlikely that 
there is a large difference in futibatinib PK between patients with solid tumours and healthy adult 
subjects.

Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on futibatinib PK were assessed by the popPK analysis. Serum 
albumin and futibatinib dose ≥36 mg were found to be significant predictors of CL/F. Body weight and 
futibatinib dose ≥36 mg were found to be significant predictors of Vc/F. The presence of food has an 
effect on the absorption rate. CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors reduced and increased the relative 
bioavailability. Relative bioavailability was impacted by study. The final popPK model was used to 
evaluate the influence of covariates on steady-state exposure metrics (area under the concentration-
time curve at steady-state [AUCss], maximum concentration at steady-state [Cmax,ss], and minimum 
concentration at steady-state [Cmin,ss]) using forest plots (Figure 3). No effects of ALP, formulation, 
sex, race, renal or hepatic impairment were identified. No effects of mild (N=127) or moderate (N=36) 
renal impairment on the PK of TAS-120 were found. There were no subjects with severe renal 
impairment. No effects of mild (N=56) or moderate (N=3) hepatic impairment on the PK of TAS-120 
were found. In addition, effect of hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of futibatinib was evaluated 
in study TAS-120-108. Similar futibatinib exposures were observed in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh 
class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), or severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared 
to subjects with normal hepatic function. The unbound futibatinib concentrations at 2h and 12h also 
overlapped between healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Three in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted:  
In study TAS-120-104, the effect of elevated gastric pH by multiple-dose lansoprazole on the 
absorption of futibatinib was investigated. 
In study TAS-120-103 the effect of the strong CYP3A4 and Pgp/BCRP inhibitor itraconazole and the 
strong inducer rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of futibatinib was investigated. 
In study TAS-120-105, the effect of futibatinib as inhibitor of CYP3A4 was investigated on the 
pharmacokinetics of midazolam.  
The results of the effects of lansoprazole, itraconazole, and rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of 
futibatinib are summarised in Table 7. Following administration of lansoprazole + futibatinib, the 
geometric mean values of AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax were similar to those following futibatinib alone. Co-
administration of futibatinib with itraconazole resulted in approximately 51% and 41% increases in 
Cmax and AUC of futibatinib following a single dose in healthy adult subjects. The median Tmax was 
approximately 0.5 hours earlier following itraconazole + futibatinib compared to futibatinib alone. The 
arithmetic mean T1/2 were approximately 3.5 and 2.6 hours following itraconazole + futibatinib and 
futibatinib alone, respectively. Co-administration of futibatinib with the strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer 
rifampicin resulted in approximately 53% and 64% decreases in Cmax and AUCs of futibatinib as shown 
in Table 7. The median Tmax was delayed by 0.5 hours following rifampin + futibatinib compared to 
futibatinib alone. The T1/2 arithmetic means were 2.0 and 2.8 hours following rifampicin + futibatinib 
and futibatinib alone, respectively.

Futibatinib showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro. However, in the clinical interaction 
study with midazolam (TAS-120-105), futibatinib (20 mg QD for 7 consecutive days) did not inhibit

CYP3A4, mean values of AUClast, and Cmax of midazolam in presence of futibatinib 20 mg QD were 
similar to those following midazolam alone. 
In vitro interactions 
Futibatinib is a substrate for CYP3A4, P-gp and to lesser extent also for BCRP.  
Futibatinib reversibly inhibited activities of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 with IC50 values of 8.14, 
23.9, and 26.5 μmol/L, respectively, in vitro (Study 18DB18). These IC50 values are higher than the 
cut-off values of the basic model indicating that futibatinib 20 mg QD is unlikely to cause clinical DDIs 
with CYP2C substrates.  
Based on the in vitro data, futibatinib could be an inducer of CYP1A2, and could be an inhibitor for Pgp, 
BCRP and OATP1B1. PBPK modelling was used to further justify the potential of futibatinib to inhibit 
these transporters in vivo. 
PBPK interaction modelling 
Since in vivo studies with itraconazole and rifampicin increased and decreased, respectively, the 
exposure of futibatinib, PBPK modelling (PBPK report 20DC01) was conducted to predict the effect of 
mild, moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and moderate, and strong inducers on futibatinib PK after 
multiple administrations in cancer patients.  
PBPK analyses predicted that strong CYP3A inhibitors (itraconazole and clarithromycin) and moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors (fluconazole and fluvoxamine) would increase AUCtau of futibatinib 20 mg QD by 
around 50% and 25% to 40%, respectively. A weak inhibitor, cimetidine would marginally increase 
futibatinib AUCtau by around 10%. 
PBPK analyses predicted that carbamazepine (strong CYP3A inducer), rifampicin (strong CYP3A 
inducer), and efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducer) would decrease AUCtau of futibatinib 20 mg QD by 
approximately 35%, 60%, and 50%, respectively. 
Further, in vitro studies indicated that futibatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. The potential to 
inhibit these transporters was further evaluated by PBPK (PBPK report 20DC09). Under the most 
conservative assumption made with Ki value by 0.01-fold, futibatinib was predicted to increase Cmax 
and AUC of a clinical P-gp substrate, digoxin and a clinical BCRP substrate, rosuvastatin. Additional 
simulation suggested that a staggered dosing between futibatinib and P-gp/BCRP substrates decreased 
the elevated exposure of P-gp/BCRP substrates. When using the uncorrected in vitro Ki and 0.1-fold Ki 
values, futibatinib was predicted to have no clinically relevant impact on exposures of P-gp/BCRP 
substrates. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The primary efficacy data supporting this submission was based on clinical data from the pivotal Phase 
1/2 Study TPU-TAS-120-101. Pharmacodynamics of futibatinib were evaluated by means of serum 
phosphate and FGF23 levels in patients with solid tumours in the dose escalating part of study 
TAS-120-101 with dosing schedules QD and QOD evaluated. Exposure-response analyses for efficacy 
(study TAS-120-101) and safety (study TAS-120-101 and 10059010 in Japanese patients) were 
submitted as well as a dedicated QTc cardiac safety study in healthy subjects (TAS-120-107). 
Mechanism of action 
FGFR signalling is deregulated in many human cancers, and FGFR is considered a potential therapeutic 
target in FGFR-deregulated tumours. Futibatinib is an irreversible inhibitor of FGFR 1–4, with 50% 
inhibitory concentrations of 1.4 to 3.7 nmol/L. Futibatinib covalently bound the FGFR kinase domain, 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 46/118 
 
 
 
inhibiting FGFR phosphorylation and, in turn, downstream signalling in FGFR-deregulated tumour cells. 
Pathophysiology of FGFR-inhibition is associated hyperphosphatemia. In kidneys, FGFR inhibitors block 
the catabolism of 1, 25 (OH)2 vitamin D, and sodium-phosphate co-transporters in the proximal renal 
tubule cell thereby leading to hyperphosphatemia. FGFR inhibitors also block the conversion of 
cholesterol to bile acid thereby leading to altered bile acid metabolism. 
In non-clinical development studies, futibatinib has demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of 
cancer cell growth of tumour cell lines harbouring various FGFR genomic alterations. In FGFR 
alteration-driven human tumour xenograft models, futibatinib exhibited statistically significant and 
dose-dependent antitumor activity with QD administration. Inhibition of FGFR phosphorylation and its 
downstream signals after a single-dose of futibatinib in AN3 CA Xenografted tumour was 
demonstrated. (see Non-clinical aspects for more details) 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In the dose escalating part of study TAS-120-101 in patients with solid tumours, serum phosphate and 
FGF23 were evaluated for PD analysis as on-target off-tumour effect due to inhibition of FGFR. 
Futibatinib elevated serum phosphate levels, which were sustained for at least 48h following the first 
dose. Futibatinib QOD and QD increased FGF23 and phosphate levels, with a tendency towards dose 
dependency.  
Relationships of the Cavg phosphate with dose or AUCinf of futibatinib are illustrated in Figure 4. The 
increase in Cavg serum phosphate after repeated doses increased in a dose- or AUCinf-dependent manner in 
both dosing schedules. As shown by the regression patterns, steeper response in the relationship of 
Cavg with both futibatinib dose and AUCinf was seen in the QD dosing groups compared with the QOD 
dosing groups.

In Study TAS-120-107, the effects of single oral doses of futibatinib on the cardiac QTc interval by 
assessing the concentration-QT relationship using exposure-response modelling were explored using 
the clinical dose of 20 mg, but also a supratherapeutic dose of 80 mg futibatinib. Moxifloxacin 400 mg 
was included as a positive control. Plasma concentration range following single-dose administration of 
therapeutic dose (20 mg) and supratherapeutic dose (80 mg) covered the highest exposure observed 
in patients with advanced solid tumours. Futibatinib did not prolong the QTc interval.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The exposure-efficacy analyses included 98 subjects with CCA with FGFR2 rearrangements (including 
fusions) in the Phase 2 portion of Study TAS-120-101. All subjects in the exposure efficacy analysis 
data set received 20 mg futibatinib QD. 
No statistically significant exposure-efficacy relationships were observed for ORR, disease control rate 
(DCR), DOR, OS, progression free survival (PFS), or change in tumour size with respect to any of the 
exposure metrics evaluated (Cmin, Cmax, average plasma concentration [Cavg], AUC on Cycle 1 Day 1 or 
at steady state).  
The exposure-safety dataset included 318 patients (N=39 from Study 10059010 and N=279 from 
Study TAS-120-101). For the QD dosing regimen, statistically significant exposure-safety relationships 
were observed between Cmin/AUC and hyperphosphatemia, nail disorders, and retinal disorders. No 
exposure-safety relationships were observed for any grade of hypercalcemia, hepatotoxicity, palmar-
plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPE), rash, and any exposure metric evaluated.  
Covariate evaluations of the exposure-response relationships for hyperphosphatemia revealed that 
baseline serum phosphate and sex are independent predictors of probability of hyperphosphatemia 
grade ≥ 3, with high baseline phosphate levels and female associated with increased probability of 
hyperphosphatemia grade ≥3 (Table 8). An increased ECOG score was associated with increased nail 
disorders, any grade. None of the other covariates tested were significant for retinal disorders, any 
grade.

over the dose range 16 mg to 24 mg QD, whereas a modest increase in objective response (<3%) and 
nail disorders (4%) over this dose range was projected.

Pharmacokinetics 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 49/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of futibatinib has been characterized in 10 studies in healthy volunteers and in 
patients with advanced solid tumours. In addition to the 10 clinical studies, 3 reports on population 
pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses, and PBPK analyses to support drug-drug 
interactions have been submitted. 
Methods 
All three methods to determine futibatinib in human plasma and urine by LC/MS/MS were sufficiently 
validated in line with ICH-M10 guideline on bioanalytical method validation. While the methods were 
sufficiently validated per facility, it appears that cross-validation between the three testing facilities has 
not been conducted. A sensitivity analysis for testing facility of the popPK model was provided 
subsequently and showed no difference between CMIC and Covance testing facilities but adding 
Celerion as testing facility reduced the residual error. Celerion was used to analyse futibatinib in 
healthy subjects but not in patients. The estimated effects on exposure, though, were limited. 
Moreover, because the studies in healthy subjects were cross-over studies, the different testing facility 
has no effect on the covariate analysis tested in healthy subjects such as food effect and drug-drug 
interactions. In addition, as testing facility has only been used for samples of healthy subjects, this has 
limited impact on characterisation of futibatinib in patients, covariate analysis and exposure-response 
analysis. 
Bioequivalence 
Two dosage forms, liquid filled hard capsules and immediate release film-coated tablets were 
developed for use in clinical studies of futibatinib. Further, a tablet of 4 mg to be marketed has been 
developed. Bioequivalence of the 20 mg liquid-filled hard capsule and the 20 mg film-coated tablet 
clinical trial formulations for futibatinib has been demonstrated (Study 10059020). The composition of 
the film-coated tablets was not dose proportional, but the difference in composition had no effect on 
the bioavailability of the 4 mg and 20 mg strengths (study 10059010). Since the difference between 
the to-be-marketed tablets and the clinical tablets were minor without changing the composition of 
core tablets, no bioequivalence study between the two formulations was conducted. The formulations 
were bridged by dissolution profile comparison of the two formulations and across study comparison of 
the pharmacokinetic parameters.  
ADME 
Futibatinib was readily absorbed reaching Cmax values within 1-3 hours after administration. Absorption 
was dose proportional in the clinical dose range 12-20 mg futibatinib QD. Co-administration with the 
proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole had no effect on the absorption of futibatinib. Hence, proton pump 
inhibitors can be co-administered with futibatinib, which has been described adequately in the SmPC. 
Futibatinib is considered a high permeability compound and no intact futibatinib but many metabolites 
were recovered in human faeces in the mass balance study (Study TAS-120-106). Additional in vitro 
stability testing of futibatinib in the gastrointestinal flora showed that the possibility of major 
metabolites identified in human faeces being generated by intestinal flora from unabsorbed futibatinib 
is low. Therefore, based on the mass balance data, it is estimated that the absorption of futibatinib is 
at least 70%. 
By consumption of a high-fat, high calorie meal Cmax and AUC were 42%, and 14% lower, respectively, 
compared to fasted conditions and Tmax was 3h delayed. Considering the moderate to high variability of 
the PK parameters Cmax and AUC and the lack of dose - ORR response, the food effect is considered not 
clinically meaningful, and it is agreed that futibatinib can be taken with or without food as is indicated 
in section 4.2 of SmPC. 
The mean apparent volume of distribution following single-dose oral administration of futibatinib 20 mg 
to patients with advanced solid tumours was 73 L, indicating that futibatinib is moderately distributed 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 50/118 
 
 
 
to tissues. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that futibatinib is not distributed to red blood cells as the 
blood: plasma ratio is ~0.6. However, at later time points, the blood:plasma ratio of 14C -labelled 
material increased to 0.85-1.7 suggesting that some metabolites are distributed or bound to blood 
cells. Thus, futibatinib is likely to bind covalently to blood cells via its acrylamide moiety as has been 
observed for several other TKIs. 
The mean elimination half-life of futibatinib of 2-3 hours is much shorter than the elimination half-lives 
of radioactivity in plasma and blood of 12h and 29h, respectively, in the mass balance study. However, 
a longer plasma elimination half-life of futibatinib was also observed at high futibatinib doses in the 
120-200mg dose range without a more than dose proportional increase in AUC (Studies TAS-120-101, 
10059010). The secondary elimination phase is probably slow release of futibatinib from tissues, which 
is measurable in plasma (concentrations >LLOQ) at higher futibatinib doses. 
Futibatinib is eliminated by metabolism since futibatinib excretion into either urine or faeces was 
negligible. Based on in vitro and in vivo data with itraconazole, it was estimated that 35%-40% of 
metabolism of futibatinib was mediated by CYP enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4. Additional in vitro 
metabolism studies showed that glutathione conjugation by both glutathione S-transferase and 
non-enzymatic formation accounts for the remaining 50%–60% of the futibatinib metabolism. 
Significant clinical interactions by glutathione S-transferase inhibition are considered unlikely. 
However, the interpretation that CYP3A4 is responsible for 30-40% of metabolism is questioned. 
Itraconazole mostly increased the absorption phase of futibatinib without affecting the elimination 
phase. This may suggest that it is not the effect of CYP3A4 inhibition but rather P-gp inhibition that is 
seen. This will be further evaluated post approval in an interaction study with quinidine as P-gp 
inhibitor (REC). 
The pharmacokinetics of the futibatinib metabolites have not been evaluated. The two primary 
circulating metabolites in human plasma, a cysteinylglycine conjugate (13%) and a cysteine conjugate 
(9%), were <25% of the exposure to the parent and showed no in vitro activity (Study CBS-200034). 
It is therefore agreed that further characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of metabolites is not 
needed, also considering the indication in the scope of ICH S9. Metabolism seems similar in human as 
in rat and dog with the exception of the major metabolite in human plasma cysteinylglycine conjugate 
(TAS-06-22952). This metabolite and also the glutathione conjugate were not observed in vitro and in 
vivo in rat and dog (see Non-clinical aspects).  
The applicant did not generate enantioselective/stereoselective data in the nonclinical or clinical 
program. It is agreed that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic inversion are unlikely for a structure like 
futibatinib. 
PopPK analysis 
Based on the non-compartmental analysis, PK parameters are overlapping between patients and 
healthy volunteers. 
PopPK modelling seems to underestimate the absorption rate somewhat as estimated Cmax in patients 
(144 ng/mL) is lower as determined by non-compartmental analysis (257 ng/mL). Sparse PK samples 
were collected (pre-dose and 1h and 3h after dosing in the 2nd cycle) in part B of study TAS-120-101. 
This could have resulted in apparent lower Cmax values in patients.  
The final model parameter estimates and RSEs were overall reasonable, however, the estimated 
correlation between CL/F and Vc/F is very low and is associated with high RSE. Rerunning the final 
model without covariance between CL/F and Vc/F resulted in similar parameter estimates as the final 
model (data not shown). 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023

A major concern with the popPK analysis is the inclusion of study as co-variate on relative 
bioavailability. While a study effect on relative bioavailability could improve the covariate analysis, this 
should only be imputed when there is a solid reason for the between study differences. No scientific 
rationale was provided for the more than 2-fold lower relative bioavailability for study 10059020 in 
Japanese healthy volunteers. A true difference between healthy subjects and patients, a true difference 
between Japanese and White subjects, or a true difference in bioanalytical testing centre could have 
been missed by introduction of study as covariate on relative bioavailability. It was acknowledged 
there was no other reason for including the study effect in the model on bioavailability (F) than the 
noted differences between studies that could not be explained by another common covariate among 
the grouped studies. A sensitivity analysis with removal of study on F resulted in an increase in 
apparent Cl/F, Vc/F, Vp/F and Q/F but had no effect on the co-variate analysis. In addition, the 
exposure estimation in the patient population was comparable with the final popPK model and the 
sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, when data in healthy subjects were simulated, there was an 
approximately 20%-difference in exposures predicted between the final model and the sensitivity 
model. Overall, it is concluded that the performance of the popPK analysis is adequate to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of futibatinib in the patient population studied in the pivotal study. Since the 
between study effects remain unexplained, there are unknown factors which influence the 
pharmacokinetics of futibatinib significantly. Therefore, this popPK model is less suitable for 
simulations and extrapolation into other populations or settings not described by the data. 
Special populations 
PopPK analysis was used to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of 
futibatinib. Serum albumin was found to be a significant predictor of CL/F, resulting in higher 
futibatinib exposures at low serum albumin. Patients with low serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL had more 
(S)AEs, however, this was probably related to worse health status rather than futibatinib exposures. 
Body weight was found to be significant predictors of Vc/F. However, changes in exposure in patients 
with 5% and 95% body weight were < 20% and therefore body weight (36 - 152 kg) is unlikely to 
represent a clinically significant intrinsic variable for futibatinib PK. No effects on CL/F and Vc/F, i.e. 
<20% difference, of ALP, age (18 - 82 years), sex, or race (Asian/non-Asian) were identified. 
Negligible amounts of futibatinib are excreted in the urine. Therefore, renal function is not expected to 
affect the pharmacokinetics of futibatinib and renal function was not a covariate in the popPK model. 
Subjects with severe renal impairment or in subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving 
intermittent haemodialysis were not included in the popPK analysis. Hepatic impairment (mild, 
moderate, and severe) had no impact on the PK of futibatinib. The special populations have been 
adequately described in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
The covariate analysis is considered overall acceptable. The following covariates are not considered 
important predictors for futibatinib PK: race/ethnicity, sex, race, patient vs healthy volunteer.  
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers were included as categorical covariates on relative F in the final model. 
From a mechanistic point of view, CYP3A4 may also affect CL. Nevertheless, as the apparent CL (CL/F) 
was estimated, it could be acknowledged that it may be difficult to separate effects on CL/F or relative 
F, and thus, including these covariates on relative F is considered acceptable.  
Drug-drug interactions  
In vitro studies showed that futibatinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 and for P-gp and BCRP. The potential 
for clinically relevant interaction with BCRP inhibitors though is unlikely.  An in vivo interaction study 
was conducted with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and also an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP) 
and with rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and P-gp). In presence of itraconazole, Cmax and AUC 
were 1.4- to 1.5-fold higher while in presence of rifampicin Cmax and AUCs of futibatinib were 
decreased by 53% and 64%, respectively, in healthy adult subjects.

EMA/218116/2023  
Page 52/118 
 
 
 
PBPK modelling was conducted to evaluate the effect of other mild-to strong inhibitors and inducers on 
the exposure of futibatinib. The PBPK model for futibatinib describes reasonably well the 
pharmacokinetic profile of futibatinib in healthy subjects and in cancer patients from study TAS-120-
101.  
PBPK analyses predicted that strong CYP3A inhibitors (itraconazole and clarithromycin) and moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors (fluconazole and fluvoxamine) would increase AUCtau of futibatinib 20 mg QD. 
Further, PBPK analyses predicted that carbamazepine (strong CYP3A inducer), rifampicin (strong 
CYP3A inducer), and efavirenz (moderate CYP3A inducer) would decrease AUCtau (PBPK report 
20DC01). The presented model is flawed as P-gp is not integrated in it, while futibatinib is both a 
substrate of CYP3A4 and of P-gp and BCRP. The data from the DDI study with itraconazole and 
rifampicin suggest an interplay between P-gp and intestinal CYP3A4 since in presence of itraconazole, 
Tmax was somewhat shorter and the absorption peak sharper, while after induction with rifampicin, 
Tmax was somewhat later and the absorption peaks broad. It is currently not possible to distinguish 
whether the net effect of itraconazole and rifampicin is a result of inhibition/induction of CYP3A4, P-gp 
or both; this implies the model is not fit for simulation. In addition, the PBPK model is considered not 
sufficiently qualified to predict the effects of inducers, because several enzymes and transporters seem 
to be involved in the pharmacokinetics of futibatinib, and inducers can affect the activity of many 
enzymes/transporters differently. 
Since the worst-case scenario inhibition/induction of CYP3A4/P-gp is known from the dedicated studies 
and the effects are modest, any dose adjustments could be based on these results. Along with a 
discussion on the therapeutic window, the applicant argued the exposure range of the 20 mg 
represents the upper and lower boundary of the therapeutic window, based on the available efficacy 
and safety data for 16, 20 and 24 mg QD (and for the QOD regimen). Considering that the difference 
in dose is quite small between 16, 20 and 24 mg and taking the high variability into account, it would 
seem appropriate to consider the conservative measures of acceptance of 20 to 25% exposure 
difference on the mean PK parameters to be the relevant boundaries when determining the need for 
dose adjustment in special populations or in case of interactions. The applicant will investigate the 
efficacy of a lower dose of 16 mg (see Specific obligation). Hence the lower boundaries are not yet 
strongly defined. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, 
itraconazole) may increase futibatinib plasma concentration and should be avoided. If this is not 
possible, a reduction in the futibatinib dose to the next lower dose level based on tolerability observed 
should be considered. The concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A/P-gp inducers (e.g. 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, efavirenz, rifampin) may decrease futibatinib plasma 
concentration and should be avoided. If this is not possible, gradual increase of the futibatinib dose 
based on careful monitoring of tolerability should be considered.  
In vitro studies showed that futibatinib is a potential time-dependent inhibitor toward CYP3A and an 
inducer of CYP1A2 (Study 18DB18). In the in vivo interaction study TAS-120-105 with midazolam, a 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, futibatinib had no clinically significant impact on Cmax and AUCs of 
midazolam showing that futibatinib is not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo. This has been 
described adequately in the SmPC. However, co-administration of futibatinib with CYP1A2 sensitive 
substrates (e.g, olanzapine, theophylline) may decrease their exposure and therefore may affect their 
activity (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Potential interaction of futibatinib mediated by transporters was investigated in transporter 
overexpressing cells. Using EMA’s cut-off values (Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions 
CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2*), futibatinib could be an inhibitor for P-gp and BCRP. No in vivo DDI 
studies were conducted but PBPK modelling was used to further justify the potential of futibatinib to 
inhibit these transporters in vivo. However, the number of substrates and inhibitors that was used to 
qualify the PBPK model was not in line with the recommendations provided in Guideline on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 53/118 
 
 
 
reporting of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling and simulation (European 
Medicine Agency, July 1, 2019, EMA/CHMP/458101/2016), and therefore it cannot be concluded that 
futibatinib has no clinically relevant impact on exposures of P-gp/BCRP substrates. The applicant is 
recommended to conduct an in vivo interaction study with digoxin (P-gp substrate) and rosuvastatin 
(BCRP, OATP1B1 substrate) (REC). Co-administration of futibatinib with P-gp (e.g., digoxin, 
dabigatran, colchicine) or BCRP (e.g, rosuvastatin) substrates may increase their exposure (see section 
4.5 of the SmPC). 
It is currently unknown whether futibatinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should 
add a barrier method during Lytgobi treatment and for at least 1 week after the last dose (see section 
4.5 of the SmPC). The lack of in vivo study with contraceptive steroids is acceptable given that few 
WOCBP are expected in the target population. Should another indication be studied including a larger 
proportion of WOCBP, a study investigating this interaction in vivo would be required.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Futibatinib is an irreversible inhibitor of FGFR 1-4. In vitro inhibition IC50 values were 1.4 to 3.7 nM. In 
vitro studies in cell lines with several FGFR2 mutations indicated that futibatinib is still active against 
those mutations. In study TAS-120-101, unbound Cmax values of futibatinib in patients were ~30 nM, 
high enough for inhibition of FGFR. The mechanism of action has been supported by non-clinical in 
vitro studies and in vivo studies in xenografts. 
In the dose escalating part of study TAS-120-101 in patients with solid tumours, the exposure-
response relationship was more pronounced in QD than in the QOD cohorts, which suggests that the 
turn-over rate of FGFR is rather fast as futibatinib is an irreversible inhibitor. 
In Study TAS-120-107, the effects of single oral doses of futibatinib on the cardiac QTc interval by 
assessing the concentration-QT relationship using exposure-response modelling were explored. 
Futibatinib did not prolong the QTc interval. This is consistent with non-clinical data. 
Several exposure-response analysis (efficacy and safety) were performed by the applicant. Within the 
current submission, the exposure-response analysis is not viewed as pivotal. The exposure-response is 
seen as supportive to the proposed dose regimen, including dose reduction recommendations. 
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation between any of the exposure metrics of futibatinib 
and any of the efficacy measures, indicating that exposure-response for efficacy is rather flat. A study 
is planned in which 16 mg will be compared with 20 mg dose (SOB). On the other hand, there were 
steep exposure-response relations for hyperphosphatemia and nail disorders. The performed exposure-
response analysis for hyperphosphatemia was primarily conducted for the change from baseline. An 
additional analysis was conducted based on the absolute, continuous phosphate level (i.e. not baseline-
corrected) and the results agree with the exposure-response analyses which were based on the change 
from baseline phosphate. A phosphate-lowering therapy should be initiated when serum phosphate 
level is ≥5.5 mg/dL (section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
The applicant used serum phosphate as a marker for FGFR inhibition to support the dosing, and 
together with a tendency of better efficacy response following QD dosing regimen, the QD dosing 
regimen was selected for the extension study and phase B of study TAS-120-101. Based on the 
exposure-response analyses, it is not sure whether serum phosphate was the optimal marker to select 
the dose/ dosing interval since a different exposure response is apparent for efficacy and 
hyperphosphatemia based on the results of studies TAS-120-101 and study 10059010. A lower dose of 
16 mg may be equally efficacious with less hyperphosphatemia grade ≥3 AEs. The applicant will 
conduct a study in which 16 mg and 20 mg futibatinib will be further evaluated (SOB). Considering 
that the difference in dose is quite small between 16, 20 and 24 mg and taking into account the high 
Assessment report

Page 54/118 
 
 
 
variability, it is appropriate to consider the conservative measures of acceptance of 20 to 25% 
exposure difference on the mean PK parameters to be the relevant boundaries when determining the 
need for dose adjustment in special populations or in case of interactions. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology of futibatinib has been sufficiently characterised.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
in order to assess the effects of futibatinib on the pharmacokinetics of sensitive substrates of P-gp 
(digoxin) and BCRP (rosuvastatin), the MAH should submit the results of TAS-120-110, a phase 1, 
open-label, fixed-sequence study to assess the effect of futibatinib on P-gp and BCRP and the effect of 
P-gp inhibition by quinidine on the pharmacokinetics of futibatinib in healthy adult subjects. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal dose response studies were performed. Study TAS-120-101 is an open-label, non-
randomized, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, Phase 1/2 study conducted in 3 parts: 
Phase 1 Dose Escalation: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended 
phase II dose (RP2D) of futibatinib; 
Phase 1 Expansion: to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the MTD and/or RP2D of futibatinib 
in patients with tumours harboring specific FGF/FGFR aberrations; and 
Phase 2: to confirm the ORR of futibatinib in iCCA patients with tumours harboring FGFR2 gene 
fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements. 
Starting dose 
The futibatinib dosing schedules used in the Dose Escalation portion were selected on the basis of 
preclinical animal data suggesting that alternate-day dosing prevents continuous upregulation of serum 
phosphorus.  
The starting dose in this study was selected on the basis of preclinical studies in rats and dogs showing 
that the severely toxic dose in >10% of rats (STD10), and the highest non-severely toxic dose in dogs, 
both corresponded to approximately 97.2 mg QOD in humans. The starting dose of futibatinib in 
humans was therefore set at less than one tenth of this (8 mg QOD). Because the STD10 could not be 
determined for QD dosing, the starting QD dose in this study was based on human clinical experience 
from the QOD portion; specifically, the starting dose was 4 mg QD, corresponding to an approximately 
90% dose reduction compared to Cohort 4 in the QOD arm. 
Dose escalation 
Dose escalation followed a standard “3 + 3” design. No intra-patient dose escalation was allowed. The 
MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which less than 33% of the patients experienced a dose 
limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1 (21 days). The RP2D was equal to or less than MTD, and the 
associated dosing schedule was selected based on the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics and preliminary 
efficacy data observed in Dose Escalation.

Dose Escalation – Overview of Design 
Safety was the primary endpoint during the Dose Escalation portion of this study and evaluation of 
preliminary anti-tumour activity was a secondary endpoint.  
The Dose Escalation portion of the study enrolled patients with advanced solid tumours (with or 
without FGF/FGFR gene abnormalities) that had progressed on prior standard therapy or for whom 
standard therapy did not exist. Futibatinib was administered at escalating dose levels either daily (QD) 
or on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week (QOD). 
Rationale for dose selection and Schedules 
As of the data cut-off date of 06 March 2017, 73 patients with advanced cancer have been treated with 
TAS-120 in Study TPU-TAS-120-101; 42 with QOD dosing (range: 8-200 mg), and 31 with QD dosing 
(range: 4-24 mg). The safety profiles were similar for the QOD and QD schedule. Early signals of 
clinical activity were observed with both schedules as well. However, with the QD schedule there 
appears to be a stronger exposure-response relationship with respect to TAS-120 concentrations and 
serum phosphorus level, which is considered a pharmacodynamic marker of FGFR inhibition. In 
addition, the QD schedule of administration is expected to be associated with better patient dosing 
compliance compared to that of QOD administration. Therefore, only the QD regimen will be evaluated 
during the Phase 1 Expansion and Phase 2 parts of the study. 
The Phase 1 Expansion has been initiated with a TAS-120 dose of 16 mg QD, which was determined to 
be safe in the Phase 1 Dose Escalation. As of Amendment 4, an intermediate dose level of 20 mg QD 
was also planned to be evaluated for safety (DLTs in Cycle 1) in 6-12 evaluable patients. 
The rationale for evaluation of the intermediate dose level is to determine the optimal RP2D. PK 
analysis showed that dose escalation from 16 mg to 20 mg resulted in a linear increase in drug 
exposure, suggesting potential for dose optimization.  
A total of 86 patients with advanced cancer disease after failure of available standard of care treatment 
options were enrolled. This included 42 patients receiving futibatinib on a QOD dosing schedule (8-200 
mg) and 44 patients receiving futibatinib on a QD dosing schedule (4-24 mg). 
PK/PD analysis demonstrated target engagement for futibatinib QOD and QD as measured by 
increased FGF23 and phosphate serum levels with a trend towards dose dependency. This exposure-
response relationship was more pronounced in QD than in the QOD cohorts consistent with a higher 
incidence of clinical AEs of hyperphosphatemia in QD cohorts compared to QOD cohorts. 
MTD 
No MTD for QOD dosing was determined in this study as there was only a single DLT reported for a 
patient receiving futibatinib 8 mg QOD who experienced an asymptomatic and reversible Grade 4 
increase in blood creatine phosphokinase. 
For QD dosing, no DLT was observed at 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, or 20 mg QD. However, there were 3 
DLTs reported for the 9 evaluable patients receiving futibatinib 24 mg QD. DLTs included one patient 
each with reversible Grade 3 increase of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), and bilirubin. 
Based on these findings, futibatinib 20 mg QD was identified as the MTD for QD dosing of futibatinib 
for advanced cancer patients.

Futibatinib was administered either QD or QOD during the dose escalation phase.  
Dose reduction  
As per Amendment 6 the following dose schedule was used: 
Treatment Regimen 
The dose for futibatinib is 20 mg (5 x 4 mg or 1 x 20 mg tablet(s) QD). Patients were required to fast 
for at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after administration of TAS-120. Patients were permitted to 
drink water during this period. Dietary restrictions that limit phosphate intake may have reduced the 
risk of hyperphosphatemia. 
Futibatinib was to be administered as a daily, continuous, 21-day treatment cycle. Patients received 
study treatment until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable side effects, discontinued from 
treatment by the investigator, withdrawal of consent, or other criteria for discontinuation is met. 
Futibatinib was to be administered as outlined in Study Drug Administration and Dose 
Reduction/Modification Procedures. 
Dose Reduction/Modification Procedures 
Dosages will be reduced/modified if AEs are observed according to the criteria described below. In the 
following sections, AE severity grades are based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade criteria (version 4.03). 
Futibatinib Dose Reductions for Treatment-emergent Toxicities 
Dose reductions must be made according to Table 10Error! Reference source not found.. A 
maximum of 2 dose reductions were permitted.

•  Objectives 
Phase 2 
The Phase 2 portion of the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy in iCCA patients with FGFR2 
gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements. 
Primary objective 
To confirm ORR in iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements based on 
independent central radiology review. 
Secondary objectives 
To evaluate DOR 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of futibatinib 
To evaluate DCR, PFS, and OS 
To evaluate Patient-reported Outcomes (PROs) 
Exploratory objective 
To investigate the PK and to explore the relationship between PK and efficacy or toxicity of futibatinib. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study was ORR defined as the proportion of patients with objective 
evidence of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 per 
independent central radiographic review. 
Secondary endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are: 
- DOR: defined as the time from first documentation of response to date of objective progression or 
death 
- PFS: defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of objective disease progression or 
death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). 
DCR, Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) and OS (response evaluations based on independent review 
of images by the Core Imaging Laboratory).  
In addition, sensitivity analyses for some key efficacy endpoints (notably ORR and PFS) were planned 
to be performed based on assessments by the investigator or local radiologist. 
•  Sample size 
Approximately 100 iCCA patients with FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements were to be 
treated. Sample size considerations were based on differentiating a historical control ORR of 10% or 
less with a target ORR of 20%, based on the patient cohort currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 
study. Assuming the true ORR is 20%, the study has approximately 81% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the true ORR is <=10%, considering a 2-sided alpha of 5%. 
In addition, a formal interim analysis of safety and efficacy was to be performed when approximately 
70% all treated patients had 6 months of follow-up. Two-sided 95% CI and 99% CIs were to be 
provided for both interim and primary efficacy analysis of primary efficacy endpoint.

Page 61/118 
 
 
 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This is a single arm trial; randomisation and blinding is not applicable.  
•  Statistical methods 
The primary analysis is to be performed on the Efficacy population, defined as All Intra-hepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) patients with FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangement who 
received at least 1 dose of TAS-120. 
The primary endpoint, Objective Response Rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients who 
achieved best overall response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) per RECIST 1.1 
based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) in the Efficacy Population, was to be summarized by a 
binomial response rate. 
95% confidence interval (binomial proportion confidence interval) for ORR were to be constructed with 
Clopper-Pearson 95% CI. The null hypothesis was to be rejected if the 2-sided 95% CI lower bound is 
greater than 10%. This translates in observing at least 17 responders out of 100 in the Efficacy 
Population. 
The final analysis for the primary objective was to be performed when majority of patients responding 
to futibatinib had at least 6 months of follow-up from onset of response. 
The secondary endpoint, Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time between the date of first 
response and the subsequent date of objectively documented progression of disease or death. The CR 
or PR will be derived based on investigators or independent radiologist assessment. The censoring 
rules for DoR are provided in Table 13.

target, non‐nodal lesion (irrespective of PET scan results). Therefore, all responses observed were 
partial responses.  
One formal interim analysis was conducted after 67 patients with iCCA harboring FGFR2 
rearrangements (including fusions) had been followed for at least 6 months as of 31 January 2020. 
Results from this analysis were used for early (non-EU) regulatory discussions and were also presented 
publicly at a scientific conference while follow up of patients for best overall response and duration of 
response was ongoing (Goyal et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020). As of the cut-off date, 24 patients had 
confirmed partial responses and 1 had confirmed complete response resulting in an ORR of 37.3 % 
with a 95% CI of (25.8%, 50.0%). 
Secondary Endpoints 
Duration of Response 
At the time of the data cut-off date, 42 of 43 patients responding to futibatinib had follow-up for at 
least 6 months following their initial response (median 11.76 months). One patient was followed for 
less than 6 months since the onset of response. The duration of follow-up for this patient since 
response was 4.60 months at the data cut-off date, and treatment was ongoing.  
At the time of the data cut-off date, the median DOR by Kaplan-Meier analysis for the 43 responders 
was 9.69 months (95% CI: 7.62, 17.05) (Table 17). The Kaplan-Meier plot of DOR is provided in 
Figure 5. The majority of responders (31 [72.1%] patients) had DORs of ≥6 months. Fifteen patients 
had an ongoing response of at least 4 months as of this cut-off date; 10 of these 15 patients had an 
ongoing response and had not yet reached the median of 9.69 months as of the cutoff date. 
The median time to response was 2.50 months (range: 0.7 to 7.4 months) (Table 17).

Note: Data are from IRC per RECIST v1.1, and complete and partial responses are confirmed. 
In addition to the primary analysis presented here, an interim analysis was conducted without plans to stop the 
study. Results from both analyses were consistent. 
Progression-free Survival 
Per independent review, as of the data cut-off (01 October 2020), 64 (62.1%) patients had 
experienced a PFS event (i.e., disease progression or death) and 39 (37.9%) were censored (20 of the 
censored patients were ongoing on study treatment at data cut-off. Median PFS was 9.0 months (95% 
CI: 6.9 months, 13.1 months). At 6 and 12 months, the proportions of patients who were progression 
free were 66.1% and 40.0%, respectively. 
Overall Survival 
At the time of the data cut-off (01 October 2020), 40 (38.8%) patients had died and 63 (61.2%) were 
censored. Of the 63 censored patients, 32 discontinued treatment before the data cutoff date and 31 
patients were alive at data cutoff. The median OS was 21.7 months (95% CI: 14.5 months, not

estimable [NE]). The OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 88.1% and 72.2%, respectively. No patients 
had been lost to follow-up as of the data cut-off date.  
•  Ancillary analyses 
Objective Response Rate per Investigator Review 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint, ORR, was also assessed by the local Investigator or 
radiologist. The one patient with CR had one remaining nodal lesion which was found to be PET-CT 
negative. Based on RECIST 1.1 complete disappearance is required for qualifying a response as 
complete in a non
target, non
nodal lesion (irrespective of PET scan results). Therefore, all responses 
observed were partial responses.

Table 19. Tumour Response Rate by Investigator Review (Efficacy Population) 
Analysis of Concordance between Independent and Investigator Reviews 
To further compare both response assessments, an analysis of concordance between independent and 
Investigator review of radiographic images has been performed. Twelve (11.7%) patients assessed as 
having ORR by independent review were not considered ORR by the study Investigator, while 7 (6.8%) 
patients assessed as having ORR by the study Investigator were not considered ORR by independent 
assessment. A total of 84 (81.6%) patients had concordant results for response assessment, i.e. 31 
(30.1%) patients with both Investigator and independent review of overall response and 53 (51.5%) 
patients with both Investigator and independent review of no response. 
Objective Response Rate for the Per-protocol Analysis Set 
As a further pre-specified sensitivity analysis, the primary endpoint, ORR by IRC, was also assessed 
based on the Per-protocol Analysis Set using a similar analysis method as the primary analysis. The 
confirmed ORR by IRC per protocol analysis was 43.0% (95% CI: 33.1, 53.3) including 42 patients 
with PR and 1 patient with CR (Table 20). The one patient with CR had one remaining nodal lesion 
which was found to be PET-CT negative. Based on RECIST 1.1 complete disappearance is required for 
qualifying a response as complete in a non
target, non
nodal lesion (irrespective of PET scan results). 
Therefore, all responses observed were partial responses.

Subgroup Analyses for the Primary Endpoint 
To assess the consistency of treatment effects across subgroups, analysis of the primary endpoint of 
confirmed ORR by independent review was performed for the subgroups age, gender, race, baseline 
ECOG performance score, number of lines of prior systemic therapy, region, prior surgical resection of 
primary tumour, and prior (neo)adjuvant treatment. The results are provided in a Forest plot (Figure 
6). 
The treatment effect with respect to confirmed ORR by independent assessment was generally 
consistent across all subgroups assessed with 95% CIs comprising the primary ORR of 41.7% except 
for the subgroup of patients at age ≥65 years, with an apparent higher ORR (65.2%; 95% CI: 42.7, 
83.6).

The applicant submitted a conditional marketing authorisation application based on the results of the

pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of futibatinib in patients with histologically or

cytologically confirmed, locally advanced, metastatic, unresectable iCCA harboring FGFR2 gene fusions 
or other FGFR2 rearrangements. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
There is no established 2L systemic therapy for iCCA following progression after 1L treatment although 
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy (either in monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxics) is 
sometimes used (ESMO Guideline biliary cancer). All patients had to be treated with at least 1 prior 
systemic GEM/CIS chemotherapy for part II of the TAS-120-101 study. Patients were required to have 
documentation of radiographic disease progression on the most recent prior therapy. 
Despite the low incidence of CCA in Europe, USA and Australasia (0.3–3.5/100 000) compared to other 
parts of the world (Thailand, China and Korea) almost half of the included patients were Caucasians. 
The studied population is considered to be of relevance for the EU setting. The majority of the patients 
had FGFR2 fusions (78%). Twenty two percent of the patients had FGFR2 rearrangements.  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria do not fully reflect the target indication. One key inclusion 
criterion was that patients had iCCA. However, the applied indication is for CCA. Given the rarity of 
extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) and the patient 
inclusion based on the presence of the driver FGFR2 gene rearrangements, homogeneity in effect is 
expected. The broader CCA target indication is agreed.  
The primary endpoint of the TAS-120-101 study is ORR. ORR is considered acceptable to investigate 
antitumor activity of a medicinal product in patients with a defined tumour type.  
The applicant stated that the primary analysis is to be performed on the Efficacy population, defined 
as All Intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) patients who received at least 1 dose of TAS-120 with 
FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangement. Patients who consented to be part of the study but 
did not receive at least 1 dose of TAS-120 were screen failures due to not meeting the inclusion or 
exclusion criteria. Therefore this definition of the efficacy population is considered to be acceptable.  
The null hypothesis of no effect was to be rejected if the 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CI lower bound 
for ORR was greater than 10%. 
The secondary endpoint was DoR. Rules for how events and censoring are defined for this DoR 
analysis were provided. The primary DOR analysis censored patients for use of anti-cancer therapy, 
end of treatment due to PD, and missing two or more assessments (with any known deaths or 
discontinuations after this point not counted as events). It is considered that these censoring rules are 
likely to over-estimate the duration of response in the context of a single arm trial. The applicant also 
pre-planned several sensitivity analyses in which more of the defined situations are considered to be 
an event rather than censored. This represents a composite estimand strategy, which is relevant to the 
assessment and informative for the prescribers. 
Several amendments (9) have been made to the original phase I study protocol and data driven 
decisions were made in study TAS-120-101.  
An interim analysis of efficacy was added while the study was ongoing. Results from this analysis were 
used for early discussions with (non-EU) regulatory agencies and were presented at a scientific 
conference while assessments were ongoing for best overall response and duration of response. 
Results of interim analyses should be kept confidential to prevent the introduction of bias, this is 
particularly important in single arm trials where there is no possibility of blinding investigators to 
treatment. While it is acknowledged that interim results are requested by other regulatory agencies as

part of accelerated approval pathways there was no clear need to publicly share this information. In 
the interest of full transparency this situation is described in the EPAR along with all interim results. 
The visit/procedure requirement violations are not expected to affect the B/R assessment. No GCP 
related critical issues were identified during the GCP inspection. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The futibatinib dose was 20 mg QD in a continuous 21-day treatment cycle until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity in the phase 2 part of study TAS-120-101. It is uncertain if the optimal dose has 
been selected. The dose response curve is unknown. The applicant intends to investigate the efficacy 
of a lower dose 16 mg in the SOB study TAS-120-205.  
PK/PD analysis demonstrated target engagement for futibatinib QOD and QD as measured by 
increased FGF23 and phosphate serum levels with a trend towards dose dependency. However, due to 
on target hyperphosphatemia, extensive mitigation measures to mitigate hyperphosphatemia were 
included in the study protocol. The administration of phosphate lowering therapy might have an impact 
on the interpretation of serum phosphate levels as a potential surrogate for efficacy. Therefore, the 
serum phosphate level cannot be considered as a surrogate for efficacy. 
Efficacy was evaluated in the 103 patients in the Phase 2 portion of study TAS-120-101 with 
unresectable iCCA harboring FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements. The majority of 
the patients had FGFR2 fusions (78%). Twenty two percent of the patients had FGFR2 rearrangements. 
Changes were made to the testing requirements for the eligibility of patients based on FGFR 
rearrangement status, which eventually allowed local or central testing of FGFR status for eligibility via 
amendment 9. No cross-validation results of the local diagnostic tests for patients’ selection with the 
FMI’s FoundationOne clinical trial assay has been reported within the trial due to tissue unavailability. 
Presence of FGFR2 gene fusions or rearrangements (including gene fusions) should be confirmed by an 
appropriate diagnostic test prior to initiation of Lytgobi therapy based on the proposed SmPC. All 
patients with a confirmed PR had some type of FGFR alterations, including FGFR2 rearrangements, 
FGFR1 mutations (n=2 for both), and FGFR1 amplification (n=1). There were no responses observed in 
patients without FGF/FGFR alterations (n=3) or patients with no FGF/FGFR test results (n =12) in the 
Phase 1 dose escalation portion of Study TAS-120-101. The proposed biomarker based selection 
strategy is considered acceptable as long as there are tests available as used for Phase 2 pivotal trial.  
The most common FGFR2 fusion partner was BICC1 (n=24). Ten out of 24 patients with a BICC1 
fusion had a response. Given the low number of patients for the other fusion partners no conclusion 
can be drawn regarding the response rate based on FGFR-fusion partner. Based on the mechanism of 
action of irreversible inhibition of FGFR 1, 2, 3 and 4, no differences in response rate are expected 
based on the fusion partner of the driver mutation. At the time of the data cutoff date, with a median 
follow-up of 11.76 months, the median DOR by Kaplan-Meier analysis for the 43 responders was 9.69 
months (95% CI: 7.62, 17.05). Based on the formal interim analysis, of the 67 patients who had been 
followed for at least 6 months as of 31 January 2020, 24 patients had confirmed partial responses and 
1 had confirmed complete response resulting in an ORR of 37.3 % with a 95% CI of (25.8%, 50.0%). 
The one patient with CR had one remaining nodal lesion which was found to be PET-CT negative. Based 
on RECIST 1.1 complete disappearance is required for qualifying a response as complete in a non
target, non
nodal lesion (irrespective of PET scan results). Therefore, all responses observed were 
‑
partial responses. 
‑
The median DOR of the sensitivity analysis taking all PDs and deaths into account based on the interim 
data is 8.31 months (95% CI: 6.18, NE).  
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 81/118 
 
 
 
The median Independent Review PFS (95% CI) was 8.9 (6.7, 11.0) months. The median OS (95% CI) 
was 20.0 (16.4, 24.6) months. The prognostic value of FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 
rearrangements is unknown. Due to the SAT design the PFS and OS results are considered of limited 
value for the B/R assessment. 
Due to the SAT design the other secondary endpoints (DCR, PFS, PROs and OS) cannot be used to 
isolate the drug effect. 
One of the inclusion criteria for study TAS-120-101 was the requirement that the patients had 
documentation of radiographic disease progression on the most recent prior therapy which has been 
reflected in the wording of the indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
Patients with prior FGFR-directed therapy were excluded from the phase II part of study TAS-120-101 
which is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The applicant will conduct a ‘single-arm’ Phase 2 Study TAS-120-205 replicating the single-arm 
efficacy (and safety) data from the pivotal Study TAS-120-101.  
The proposed study, TAS-120-205, will provide additional data in a study population similar to the 
pivotal study population. The efficacy (and safety) data of the 60 patients in the 20 mg Arm A can 
serve to verify and confirm the benefit-risk balance of futibatinib as observed in the 103 patients in the 
pivotal Study TAS-120-101. The total (efficacy) dataset will thus be comprised of approximately 160 
patients with advanced, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that 
has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. In the light of the observed efficacy 
(ORR and DOR) and safety in the pivotal study, and provided replication of these results is submitted, 
such a dataset can be considered comprehensive and support a full approval.  
Importantly, the efficacy (and safety) data of the 60 patients in the 16 mg Arm B will be regarded as 
supportive data. The 16 mg data will nevertheless be assessed and may be considered for e.g. 
inclusion in the SmPC, when scientifically justified and regarded as relevant information for prescribers. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the study TAS-120-101 demonstrated an ORR and DOR indicative of clinical benefit for 
the target population. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: results from the ‘single-arm’ Phase 2 Study TAS-120-205 (SOB) will be 
provided, which entail replication of the single-arm efficacy (and safety) data from the pivotal Study 
TAS-120-101 in a new and independent single-arm study cohort.

Table 27. Studies included in the safety analysis 
The primary safety analysis is based on the safety profile of the 42 patients with iCCA included in the 
phase 1 dose expansion portion of study TAS-120-101 and the 103 patients included in the phase 2 
portion of this study (safety data group 1; (SDG)1; n=145), which represents the targeted indication 
and posology. For the primary safety analysis, the data cut-off date (DCO) was 01 October 2020. 
As supportive safety information, safety data on patients with all solid tumours, treated at any dose 
level in the TAS-120-101 study (phase 1 dose escalation, dose expansion and phase 2) and the 
Japanese study 10059010 (dose escalation and expansion) is summarized in SDG2 (n=469). Of note, 
the SDG1 patient population is in full contained within the SDG2 patient population. SDG2 includes 318 
patients treated with a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib (Figure 8).

Figure 8. Summary of integrated safety population safety data groups (SDGs) 
The median duration of treatment in SDG1 was 8.87 months; the number of treatment cycles ranged 
from 1 to 46, with a median of 12 cycles and a relative dose intensity of 84.8% (Table 28). Ninety-two 
patients (63.4%) were treated for a duration ≥6 months, while 34 patients (23.4%) were treated for a 
duration of ≥12 months. As of DCO, 32 patients (22.1%) were still receiving study treatment, while 
113 patients (77.9%) had discontinued study treatment. The primary reason for treatment 
discontinuation was disease progression (n=97, 66.9%), with 8 patients (5.5%) discontinuing due to 
an (S)AE, and 4 patients (2.8%) each discontinuing due to withdrawal of consent or investigator 
decision. 
Among the overall population of patients with any tumour type treated at any starting dose (SDG2), 
the median duration of treatment was 2.76 months. For patients with any tumour type who received a 
starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib (N=318), median duration of treatment was 3.65 months.

All patients in SDG1 experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and most 
patients had a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) (n=143/146, 98.6%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
reported for 76.6% of patients, most commonly hyperphosphatemia.  
Seven patients (4.8%) in SDG1 had AEs with an outcome of death, while 27 patients (8.5%) with any 
tumour type who received a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib in the integrated population 
(N=318) experienced an AE with an outcome of death. None of these events were assessed as 
treatment-related by the investigators. 
The percentages of patients who experienced TEAEs (including Grade ≥3) and treatment-emergent 
SAEs were overall similar between the patients in the TAS-120-101 Phase 2 population (n=103) and 
patients with iCCA in the integrated population who received 20 mg QD futibatinib (SDG1).  
In SDG2, the frequency of TRAEs (97.2%), TEAEs ≥ grade 3 (71.7%; 44.7% treatment-related), SAEs 
(43.7%; 7.2% treatment-related), and TRAEs leading to dose modifications (interruption 42.5%, 
reduction 35.8%, discontinuation 2.5%) were comparable to those in SDG1.

Treatment-related TEAEs and TRAEs of ≥ grade 3 
In SDG1, TRAEs were reported for 98.6% of patients, 79 of these patients (54.5%) experienced at 
least 1 Grade ≥3 TRAE. The most frequently reported TRAEs, reported in at least 20% of patients, 
included hyperphosphatemia (85.5%), alopecia (34.5%), dry mouth (27.6%), dry skin (26.2%), 
diarrhea (25.5%), fatigue (22.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome and stomatitis 
(22.1% each). Grade ≥3 TRAEs reported in ≥5% of patients included hyperphosphatemia (26.9%), 
stomatitis and AST increased (6.2% each) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (5.5%).

In SDG1, no patients died while receiving study treatment. Nine (9) patients (6.2%) died during the 
30-day safety follow-up period.  
In SDG2, 2 deaths (0.6%) were attributed to AEs. These included 1 patient each with acute pulmonary 
oedema and acute renal failure. The event of fatal renal failure occurred within the 30-day safety 
follow-up period, while the acute pulmonary oedema event occurred during the survival follow-up 
period. Neither of these events were assessed by the investigators as treatment-related. Cause of 
death for 17 patients (5.3%) was unknown; a majority of these patients died during the survival 
follow-up period, while 3 patients (0.9%) died from unknown reasons during the 30-day safety follow-

In SDG1, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 59 patients (40.7%) with iCCA who received a 
starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib; of these, 35.9% were ≥ grade 3. 9.0% were considered 
treatment-related, and none of these were grade 4 or 5 events. 
7 SAEs were Grade 5 events (disease progression (n=5, 3.4%), and ascites and hepatic failure (n=1 
each, 0.7%). 
Of the 13 patients with a treatment-related SAE (9.0%); 9 patients (6.2%) experienced at least 1 
treatment-related Grade 3 SAE. There were no treatment-related Grade 4 or Grade 5 SAEs. 
Treatment-related SAEs reported in >1 patient included intestinal obstruction and migraine (n=2 each, 
1.4%); all remaining treatment-related SAEs occurred in a single patient each. The SAEs of intestinal 
obstruction were both Grade 3 events, while both events of migraine were Grade 2. 
In SDG2, a total of 201 patients (42.9%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE and 34.5% 
experienced Grade ≥3 SAEs.  
Treatment-related SAEs were reported for a total of 23/318 patients (7.2%), 16 patients (5.0%) had 
at least 1 treatment-related Grade 3 SAE, and there was a single Grade 4 treatment-related SAE of 
hyponatremia. There were no Grade 5 treatment-related SAEs. Two patients (0.6%) each experienced 
SAEs of anemia (grade 3), intestinal obstruction (grade 3), migraine (grade 2), and transient ischemic 
attack (grade 2).  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Based on safety signals during preclinical or clinical trials, or based on class effects of similar drugs, 
the following AESI for futibatinib were defined: retinal disorders, hyperphosphatemia, hepatotoxicity, 
nail disorders, Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), and rash. 
Table 33 summarizes incidence of AESIs observed in the TAS-120-101 Phase 2 population, SDG1 and 
the 318 patients from SDG2 treated at the proposed dose of 20mg QD.

Table 33. AESIs observed in TAS-120-101, SDG1 and SDG2 (20mg QD dose only) 
In SDG1, 136 patients (93.8%) experienced at least 1 AESI, Grade ≥3 AESIs were reported for 
57 patients (39.3%), including 1 with an outcome of death (hepatic failure, which was assessed as not 
treatment-related, see following section on hepatotoxicity).  
In SDG2, AESIs were reported for 87.2% of patients (n=409), with 28.8% of patients (n=135) 
experiencing Grade ≥3 AESIs.  
Of the 318 patients with any tumour type who received a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib, 
292 patients (91.8%) experienced at least 1 AESI. Grade ≥3 AESIs were reported for 109 patients 
(34.3%), including 2 patients (0.6%) experiencing hepatic failure with an outcome of death considered 
to be caused by disease progression. 
Retinal disorders  
Ophthalmological examination was performed prior to initiation of therapy, 6 weeks thereafter, and 
urgently at any time for visual symptoms. For serous retinal detachment, the following dose 
modification guidelines are in place: 
Table 34. Dose modifications for serous retinal detachment 
Adverse reaction 
Asymptomatic  
Moderate decrease in visual acuity (best 
corrected visual acuity 20/40 or better or ≤ 
3 lines of decreased vision from baseline);

Marked decrease in visual acuity (best 
corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40 or 
>3 lines decreased vision from baseline up 
to 20/200); limiting activities of daily living  
Futibatinib dose modification 
•  Continue futibatinib at current dose. Monitoring should be 
performed as described in section 4.4.  
•  Withhold futibatinib. If improved on subsequent 
• 
examination, futibatinib should be resumed at the next 
lower dose level. 
If symptoms recur, persist or examination does not 
improve, permanent discontinuation of futibatinib should 
be considered based on clinical status. 
•  Withhold futibatinib until resolution. If improved on 
subsequent examination, futibatinib may be resumed at 2 
dose levels lower.  
If symptoms recur, persist or examination does not

In SDG1, AESIs in the category of retinal disorders were infrequent, with 9 patients (6.2%) 
experiencing retinal disorders, most frequently subretinal fluid (n=3, 2.1%) and chorioretinopathy 
(n=2, 1.4%). There were no Grade ≥3 events of retinal disorders.  
Median time to onset of retinal disorder was 43 days. In the 3 patients (2.1%) with Grade 2 retinal 
disorders, all events resolved to Grade <2, after a median of 25 days. There were no SAEs reported, 
and no AEs led to discontinuation of futibatinib, although 3 patients (2.1%) experienced AEs leading to 
dose interruption and/or reduction. 
In SDG2, retinal disorders occurred in 38 patients (8.1%), most were assessed as treatment-related 
(7.7%). There were no Grade ≥3 events, six patients (1.9%) had Grade 2 retinal disorders, all of 
which resolved to Grade <2 after a median of 23 days. Retinal disorders led to dose reduction in 
5 patients and interruptions in 4 patients, one patient discontinued futibatinib because of retinal 
disorders (retinal detachment and cataract). 
Hyperphosphatemia 
Grading of hyperphosphatemia AEs did not use CTCAE v4.03 (which does not include criteria for grade 
of hyperphosphatemia), but was conducted based on serum phosphate levels. In this adjusted grading, 
Grade 3 was defined as serum phosphate level >7 mg/dL irrespective of clinical symptoms. 
Hyperphosphatemia was the most frequently reported AESI (SDG1/SDG2 89.7/82.1% of patients), and 
it was always assessed as treatment-related. Grade 3 events were reported for 27.6% and 18.8% of 
patients, respectively, in SDG1 and SDG2. For the patients from SDG2 treated with a starting dose of 
20mg QD, the incidence of grade 3 hyperphosphatemia was 23.6%. There were no grade 4 or 5 
events. 
In SDG1 and SDG2, respectively, median time to onset was 6 days/5 days (Grade 3: 8.5 days / 
9.0 days) and most grade 3 events resolved, with a median time to resolution of 7 days in both groups 
(range: 2 to 26 days). For 2/75 patients with grade 3 hyperphosphatemia in SDG2, this AESI did not 
resolve.  
Hyperphosphatemia was managed with use of concomitant phosphate lowering medication in 
83.4%/76.6% of patients (SDG1/SDG2 20mg QD). In SDG1, hyperphosphatemia led to dose 
reductions and/or interruptions in 17.9% and 18.6% of patients. In SDG2, these percentages were 
12.9% and 21.1%. There were no SAEs, no deaths and no patients discontinued treatment due to 
hyperphosphatemia. 
In an exploratory analysis with hyperphosphatemia defined based on CTCAE v5.0 criteria (including 
129 patients in SDG1 and 419 patients in SDG2), there were no ≥grade 3 events in SDG1 or SDG2. In 
SDG1, the majority of patients (n=102, 79.1%) with normal baseline phosphate results had a 
maximum post-baseline result of Grade 2, while 21 patients (16.3%) had a maximum result of Grade 
1. In SDG2, the majority of the 318 patients who received a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib 
(n=220, 76.1%) with normal baseline phosphate results had a maximum post-baseline result of Grade 
2, while 56 patients (19.4%) had a maximum result of Grade 1. 
There were no SAEs, no deaths and no treatment discontinuations due to hyperphosphatemia. 
Hepatotoxicity  
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 93/118 
 
 
 
 
In SDG1, 42 patients (29%) had an AESI in the category of hepatotoxicity, including 18 patients 
(12.4%) with Grade ≥3 events (Table 33). The majority was assessed as treatment-related by the 
investigator (n=30/42 of 145 patients, 20.7%). Hepatotoxicity was most reported as AST increased 
(n=39; 26.9%) and ALT increased (n=28; 19.3%). Grade 3 results that occurred in ≥5.0% of patients 
were AST increased (n=15, 10.3%), alkaline phosphatase increased (n=14, 9.7%), and ALT increased 
(n=8, 5.5%). A Grade 4 result of ALT increased was reported for 1 patient (0.7%). One patient 
experienced a grade 5 AESI of hepatic failure, due to disease progression, which was assessed as not 
treatment-related. None of the reported events met Hy’s law criteria. 
Median time to onset was 57.5 days (Grade ≥3: 71 days). All Grade ≥3 events resolved with a median 
time to resolution to Grade <3 of 5 days. Nine patients (6.2%) had AESIs resulting in dose reduction 
and 14 patients (9.7%) had events leading to dose interruption. No patients discontinued study 
treatment due to hepatotoxicity.  
For SDG1, additional analyses regarding corrective treatments and de- and rechallenge information for 
hepatotoxicity were provided.  
Corrective treatments were given for TEAEs included in the definition of the hepatotoxicity AESI, 
including AEs of ALT increased (n=3 patients, 8 AEs), AST increased (n=4 patients, 11 AEs), and 
gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) increased (n=1 patient, 1 AE).  
Positive de-challenge was reported for TEAEs of ALT increased (n=9 patients, 22 AEs), AST increased 
(n=9 patients, 22 AEs), and GGT increased (n=2 patients, 4 AEs). Negative de-challenge was reported 
for TEAEs of ALT increased (n=5 patients, 6 AEs) and AST increased (n=3 patients, 5 AEs). All events 
reported as negative de-challenge were eventually reported as resolved. Rechallenge information was 
provided for one patient, and it was positive.  
Twenty-two patients who had an AESI of hepatotoxicity died during the 30-day safety follow-up period. 
Autopsy was performed for 3 patients, the results of which are summarized as follows: 
In a patient with Grade 1 ALT increased (recovered) and Grade 1 AST increased (not recovered), 
autopsy findings described the liver with moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma diffusely 
involving all lobes with metastases to several areas.  
In a patient with Grade 1 ALT increased (not recovered) and Grade 1 AST increased (not recovered), 
the cause of death was acute bronchopneumonia superimposed on metastatic intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma. 
In a patient with Grade 5 hepatic failure (fatal), autopsy findings included intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma, extensively involving the liver, with metastatic disease. 
In SDG2, 126 patients (26.9%) had an AESI in the category of hepatotoxicity, 50 of which were 
assessed as treatment-related by the investigator (n=50/126 of 469 patients, 10.7%).  
For the 318 patients treated with a starting dose of 20mg QD futibatinib, 29.6% had an AESI of 
hepatotoxicity, most of which (n=74/94 of 318 patients; 23.3%) were assessed as treatment-related. 
There were 38 patients with a grade ≥3 event (11.9%), including two patients with a grade 5 AESI of 
hepatic failure, which were both assessed as not treatment-related. 
Median time to onset in this group was 15.5 days (Grade ≥3: 25 days). Grade ≥3 events resolved in 
the majority of cases (34/38; 89.5%) with a median time to resolution to Grade <3 of 7 days. Twenty-
one patients (6.6%) had AESIs resulting in dose reduction and 29 patients (9.1%) had events leading 
to dose interruption. No patients discontinued study treatment due to hepatotoxicity. 
Nail disorders  
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 94/118 
 
 
 
In SDG1, 64 patients (44.1%) had an AESI of nail disorders. Common AEs reported were onycholysis 
(n=22, 15.2%), onychomadesis (n=19, 13.1%), and nail discoloration and nail disorder (n=18 each, 
12.4%). All other AEs occurred in <10% of patients. 
Most AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2; 2 patients experienced Grade 3 AEs (1 event each of 
onychomadesis and paronychia). Median time to onset was 96.5 days (Grade ≥3: 155.5 days). No 
AESIs in this category were Grade 4 or 5, serious, or led to treatment discontinuation. Nail disorders 
were managed with use of concomitant medication(s) (87.5% of patients) and/or futibatinib dose 
modifications (4.8% reductions/6.9% interruptions). 
In SDG2, 127 patients (27.1%) experienced an AESI of nail disorders, most were treatment-related 
(n=123, 26.2%). 
In the group of patients treated with a starting dose of 20 mg QD a total of 94 patients (29.6%) 
experienced an AESI of nail disorders, also mostly treatment-related (n=91, 28.6%). There were 4 
patients (1.3%) with a Grade ≥3 event. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were reported.  
Median time to onset for AESIs of nail disorders of any grade in this group was 85.0 days, and median 
time to onset of Grade ≥3 events was 155.5 days. Grade ≥3 AESI of nail disorders resolved to Grade 
<3 in 2 (0.6%) out of 4 patients, and to Grade <2 in 1 (0.3%) out of 4 patients. 
Dose reduction resulting from the AESI of nail disorders was reported for 10 patients (3.1%), dose 
interruption was performed in 13 patients (4.1%), and one patient (0.3%) discontinued study 
treatment due to the AESI of nail disorders (onycholysis). 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) 
PPES was reported for 33 patients (22.8%) in SDG1, all but one were considered treatment-related. 
Eight patients (5.5%) had a Grade 3 event. Median time to onset for PPES was 103 days (148 days for 
grade 3). All grade 3 events resolved to < grade 3, after a median of 7 days.  
No AESIs in this category were Grade 4 or 5, serious, or led to treatment discontinuation. PPES was 
managed with use of concomitant medications in most patients, and/or futibatinib dose modifications 
(9.7% reductions/9.0% interruptions). 
There were no dose discontinuations due to PPES. 
In SDG2, 62 patients (13.2%) had an AESI of PPES, all but 2 were considered treatment-related.  
In the group of patients treated with a starting dose of 20 mg QD a total of 48 patients (15.1%) 
experienced an AESI of PPES, also mostly treatment-related (n=47). In this group, there were 11 
patients with a grade 3 event (3.5%), no grade 4 or 5 events were reported.  
Median time to onset for PPES was 85 days (178 days for grade 3). All grade 3 events resolved to 
<grade 3, after a median of 8 days, and to <grade 2 after a median of 12 days. Futibatinib dose 
modifications were rare (5.7% reductions/4.7% interruptions), there were no discontinuations due to 
PPES.  
Rash 
The incidence of rash was 9.0% and 8.5% in SDG1 and SDG2, respectively, and it was assessed as 
treatment-related in 3.4% and 4.3%. Median time to onset of rash was 54 days/43 days in these 
groups, and there were no Grade ≥3 events, SAEs, or events leading to modification of study 
treatment.

Of note, AEs defined by PTs previously discussed in the section on the AESI of retinal disorders were 
not included in this analysis. 
In SDG1, TEAEs in the SOC of eye disorders were reported for 63 patients (43.4%), Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
were reported for 3 patients (2.1%). The most frequently reported AEs were dry eye (n=25, 17.2%), 
vision blurred (n=13, 9.0%), lacrimation increased (n=7, 4.8%), and cataract (n=6, 4.1%). 
Treatment-related cataract was reported in 3 patients (2.1%); of these, 2 patients (1.4%) had Grade 
≥3 cataract. One patient from SDG2 experienced an SAE of Grade ≥3 cataract assessed as related to 
treatment that required cataract surgery. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In SDG1, a total of 126 patients (86.9%) experienced TEAEs in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders. 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs were present in 31 of these patients (21.4%). The most frequently reported AEs were 
constipation (n=54, 37.2%), diarrhoea (n=49, 33.8%), dry mouth (n=45, 31.0%), and nausea (n=41, 
28.3%). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
In SDG1 (n=145) and SDG2 20mg QD dose (n=318) respectively, TEAEs in this SOC were reported for 
55.9%/53.1%. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were present for 13.1%/13.2%. Most frequent in both groups were 
fatigue (31%), peripheral edema (13.1%), pyrexia (11.7%) and asthenia (5.5%) (percentages for 
SDG1).  
Investigations 
TEAEs in the SOC of investigations were reported for 88 patients (60.7%) in SDG1, of these, 
29 patients (20.0%) experienced Grade ≥3 TEAEs. Weight decreased (n=27, 18.6%), blood creatinine 
increased (n=20, 13.8%), and blood alkaline phosphatase increased (n=16, 11.0%) were the most 
frequently reported TEAEs. In SDG2, these were also the most frequently reported TEAEs in this SOC 
with comparable frequencies.  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
In SDG1, TEAEs in the SOC of metabolism and nutrition disorders were reported for 136 patients 
(93.8%), 61 of whom (42.1%) experienced Grade ≥3 AEs. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
included decreased appetite (n=29, 20.0%), hypercalcemia (n=25, 17.2%) and hypophosphatemia 
(n=21, 14.5%). 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Of note, AEs defined by PTs previously discussed in the section on the AESIs of nail disorders, PPES 
and rash were not included in this analysis. 
In SDG1, TEAEs in the SOC of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported for 106 patients 
(73.1%), 9 of whom (6.2%) experienced Grade ≥3 TEAEs. Alopecia (n=51, 35.2%) and dry skin 
(n=40, 27.6%) were the most frequently reported AEs. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology and coagulation 
At least 1 shift of ≥2 grades was reported for all haematology and coagulation laboratory tests (with 
the exception of haemoglobin increased) in both populations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 96/118 
 
 
 
In both SDG1 and SDG2, the most frequently reported (≥5.0%) Grade 3 results were lymphocyte count 
decreased (15.2%/15.8%), activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged (6.4%/3.9%) and anemia 
(5.5%/7.3%). In the patients in SDG2 treated with the 20mg QD dose, the Grade 4 post-baseline 
results were neutrophil count decreased (0.4%) and lymphocyte count decreased (0.4%) in 1 patient 
each. The grade 4 post-baseline result of neutrophil count decreased occurred in a patient with a 
baseline in the normal range (Grade 0). 
Clinical chemistry - hyperphosphatemia 
Hyperphosphatemia is discussed in the section on AESIs. 
Hepatic function 
For SDG1, shifts from normal (ie, ≤ ULN) baseline values for ALT increased and AST increased to 
≥Grade 3 post-baseline were observed for 5 patients (3.7%) and 4 patients (2.8%), respectively. The 
single post-baseline Grade 4 result (ALT increased) occurred in a patient with a Grade 2 baseline value. 
AST values >3×ULN reported concurrently (within 1 day or within 30 days) with total bilirubin results 
more than twice the ULN were reported in 3 patients (2.1%); ALT values >3×ULN reported 
concurrently (within 1 day or within 30 days) with total bilirubin results more than twice the ULN were 
reported in 1 patient (0.7%). No events met Hy’s law criteria. 
In SDG2, among the patients who received a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib, Grade 4 results 
were reported for ALT increased (n=2, 0.6%), and AST increased and blood bilirubin increased (n=1 
each, 0.3%). Grade 3 results that occurred in ≥5.0% of patients included alkaline phosphatase 
increased (n=26, 8.2%), and ALT increased and AST increased (n=25 each, 7.9%). 
Shift from baseline to worst post-baseline by CTCAE grade for patients with any tumor type (any 
dosing or a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib) with at least one relevant post-baseline data point 
were also evaluated. Among patients who received a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib, a shift from 
normal (ie, ≤ ULN) baseline values for ALT increased and AST increased to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline 
was observed for 15 patients (Grade 3: 14 patients, 4.6%; Grade 4: 1 patient, 0.3%) and 8 patients 
(Grade 3: 7 patients, 2.2%; Grade 4: 1 patient, 0.3%), respectively. 
In this group, AST values >3×ULN reported concurrently (within 1 day or within 30 days) of total 
bilirubin results more than twice the ULN were reported in 10 patients (3.1%); ALT values >3×ULN 
reported concurrently (within 1 day or within 30 days) of total bilirubin results more than twice the 
ULN were reported in 5 patients (1.6%). No events met Hy’s law criteria. 
Other clinical chemistry results 
Among patients in SDG1, the most frequently reported (≥5.0%) Grade 3 results for chemistry 
laboratory results other than hyperphosphatemia and hepatic function parameters were 
hypophosphatemia (n=25, 18.1%), and hyponatremia (n=21, 14.5%). Additionally, Grade 4 post-
baseline results of hypophosphatemia were reported for 2 patients (1.4%), while 1 patient each 
experienced Grade 4 results of hypercalcemia (0.7%) and CPK increased (0.7%), and 2 patients 
experienced hyponatremia (1.4%). 
At least 1 shift of ≥2 grades was reported for all clinical chemistry laboratory tests with the exception 
of hypernatremia. Among patients with normal laboratory results at baseline, incidence rates of 
patients with Grade ≥3 results at some point during treatment were highest for hypophosphatemia 
(Grade 3: n=17, 12.5%; Grade 4: n=2, 1.5%), hyponatremia (Grade 3: n=15, 10.3%; Grade 4: n=2, 
1.4%), CPK increased (Grade 3: n=4, 3.8%), and hypercalcemia (Grade 3: n=2, 1.6%). 
In SDG2, patients treated with a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib, the most frequently reported 
(≥5.0%) Grade 3 results for chemistry laboratory results other than hyperphosphatemia and hepatic 
Assessment report

function parameters were hyponatremia (n=43, 13.6%), and hypophosphatemia (n=39, 13.2%). 
Grade 4 results were reported for hypophosphatemia (n=1, 0.7%), hyponatremia (n=3, 0.9%), and 
hypercalcemia (n=1, 0.3%). 
In this group, for patients with normal laboratory results at baseline, incidence rates of patients with 
Grade ≥3 results at some point during treatment were highest for hypophosphatemia (Grade 3: n=30, 
10.3%; Grade 4: n=2, 0.7%), hyponatremia (Grade 3: n=30, 9.6%; Grade 4: n=3, 1.0%), CPK 
increased (Grade 3: n=4, 1.9%; Grade 4: n=1, 0.5%), and hypokalaemia (Grade 3: n=6, 2.0%). 
Vital signs 
No clinically meaningful trends from baseline were observed in heart rate, respiratory rate, body 
weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, or body temperature of patients in the TAS-120-101 
Phase 2 population. Vital signs data were not pooled for analysis in the integrated safety population. 
ECGs 
Nine patients in the TAS-120-101 Phase 2 population who had a normal or abnormal not clinically 
significant ECG at screening had an abnormal and clinically significant result at a subsequent visit. 
Abnormal and clinically significant ECG results are reported as AEs as assessed by the investigators. 
ECG data were not pooled for analysis in the integrated safety population.

In SDG1, the median age was 57 years old, with 78.6% of patients aged <65 years. Incidence of 
TEAEs (100% in both groups), Grade ≥3 TEAEs (77.2 vs 74.2%), and TRAEs regardless of severity 
(99.1 vs 96.8%) were similar for patients <65 years old and those ≥65 years old. Higher incidence 
(>5% difference) of SAEs (42.1 vs 35.5%) and Grade ≥3 TRAEs (36.8 vs 32.3%) were reported for 
patients <65 years old.  
The most frequent TEAEs in patients <65 years versus those ≥65 years old included dry mouth and 
fatigue (29.8% vs 35.5% each), palmarplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (20.2% vs 32.3%), and 
stomatitis (23.7% vs 29.0%). The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs with differences ≥5% in 
incidence between patients <65 years versus those ≥65 years old included stomatitis (4.4% vs 
12.9%), hypophosphatemia (5.3% vs 12.9%) and hyponatremia (4.4% vs 19.4%). 
In SDG2, 89/318 patients (28%) treated at the 20mg QD dose were ≥ 65 years of age. The most 
frequently reported TEAEs in patients <65 years versus those ≥65 years old included decreased 
appetite (21.0% vs 34.8%), stomatitis (16.6% vs 22.5%), dysgeusia (11.8% vs 16.9%), urinary tract 
infection (8.7% vs 15.7%) and hyponatremia (6.6% vs 16.9%). 
One Grade ≥3 TEAE with ≥5% difference in incidence between patients <65 years versus those 
≥65 years old was reported (hyponatremia [4.4% vs 12.4%]).

Gender  
There were more female than male patients both in SDG1 (62.8%) and SDG2 (52.9%).  
In SDG1, incidence of TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, and TRAEs regardless of severity were similar for 
female and male patients; however, Grade ≥3 TRAEs were reported with greater frequency in female 
patients (63.7% vs 38.9%), with the largest absolute and relative differences for the preferred term 
(PT)s of ALT increased (7.7% vs 0%) and PPES (6.6% vs 3.7%). SAEs (any grade 35.2% vs 50.0%; 
and Grade ≥3 33.0% vs 40.7%) were reported more frequently in male patients. 
A comparable distribution was seen in SDG2.  
Race 
In SDG1, race was classified as Caucasian/White (n=76), Black (n=9), Asian/Oriental (n=36), Other 
(n=1), and Unknown (n=23). In SDG2, this distribution was comparable. Due to the substantial 
differences in size of patient populations by race, a detailed presentation of the most frequent AEs is 
not included. Review of the data did not identify any apparent trends in incidence rates when analysed 
by race. 
Extrinsic factors 
Geographic region 
Geographic regions included in this subgroup analysis are North America (SDG1, n=75), Europe 
(SDG1, n=38), Asia Pacific (excluding Japan; SDG1, n=18) and Japan (SDG1, n=14). 
In SDG1, the frequency of TEAEs and TRAEs of any grade were comparable for patients in all regions, 
with all patients experiencing a TEAE and nearly all patients a TRAE. Differences ≥5% were reported 
between regional groups for Grade ≥3 TEAEs and TRAEs, as well as SAEs of any grade and those of 
Grade ≥3, with the highest frequency of these events in the subgroup ‘Asia Pacific’.

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Studies examining drug-drug interactions or food effects on the safety and efficacy of futibatinib are 
discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology section. The results of these studies have shown that moderate 
to strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A have potential clinical drug-drug interactions with futibatinib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 102/118 
 
 
 
 
In addition, in vitro studies have shown potential drug-drug interactions may occur with concomitant 
use of futibatinib and those drugs that are Pgp or BCRP substrates/inhibitors. Based on clinical and in 
vitro study results, caution is advised if these drugs are given concomitantly: 
Moderate and strong CYP3A inducers: The results of Study TAS-120-103 showed a strong CYP3A 
inducer decreased futibatinib AUC by approximately 64%. A moderate CYP3A inducer was predicted to 
decrease futibatinib AUC by approximately 48%.  
Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors: The results of Study TAS-120-103 showed a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor increased futibatinib AUC by approximately 41%. A moderate CYP3A inhibitor was predicted to 
increase futibatinib AUC by approximately 20% to 40%.  
P-gp and BCRP substrates and inhibitors: Futibatinib is a potential inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP, and 
substrate of P-gp and BCRP in vitro. Futibatinib may alter the PK and activity of P-gp and BCRP 
substrates. P-gp and BCRP inhibitors may affect the PK of futibatinib. 
A food-effect study demonstrated that consumption of a high-fat, high-calorie meal reduced the 
relative oral bioavailability and delayed tmax of a single dose of 20 mg futibatinib. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In SDG1, TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were observed for 8/146 patients (5.6%), 
including 3 patients (2.1%) with treatment-related adverse events (TRAE). TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were stomatitis (n=2), anaemia, oesophageal ulcer, oesophagitis, oral dysesthesia, bile 
duct obstruction, acute cholangitis, back pain, dizziness and pharyngeal inflammation. The cases of 
stomatitis, oesophagitis, oral dysesthesia and pharyngeal inflammation (in a total of 3 patients) were 
considered treatment-related.  
In SDG2, 20 patients discontinued treatment due to a TEAE (4.3%), and in the group of patients 
treated with the starting dose of 20mg QD it was 18 patients (5.7%). In this group, there were 8 
patients in which the AE was considered treatment-related (2.5%). These treatment-related TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation were diarrhoea and stomatitis (both n=2), and cataract, retinal 
detachment, nausea, oesophagitis, oral dysesthesia, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, pharyngeal 
inflammation, eczema and onycholysis (all n=1). 
TEAEs leading to dose interruptions and reductions 
In SDG1, 91.0% of patients had at least 1 dose modification. 
A total of 115 patients (79.3%) experienced at least 1 dose interruption, a majority of which were due 
to AEs (n=92, 63.4%). The median time to first dose interruption due to AE was 36 days (range 4-
325), and the median total duration of interruption was 16 days (range 1-214). Out of the 92 patients 
with dose interruptions due to an AE, 41.4% required a second dose interruption due to an AE. 
In SDG1, 77 patients (53.1%) experienced a dose reduction, most of which (n=74, 51.0%) were due 
to AEs. The median time to dose reduction due to AE was 47 days (range 5-481). Out of the 
74 patients with dose reductions due to an AE, 22.1% required a second dose reduction due to an AE. 
TEAEs leading to dose modification (interruption and/or reduction) occurred in 105 patients (72.4%). 
Hyperphosphatemia (n=39, 26.9%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (n=17, 11.7%) 
were the most frequently reported AEs that resulted in dose modification. 
Adverse events considered related to study treatment and leading to dose modification were reported 
for a total of 87 patients (60.0%); also most frequently hyperphosphatemia (n=39, 26.9%), and 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (n=17, 11.7%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 103/118 
 
 
 
In SDG2, 32% of patients had a dose reduction, mainly due to AEs (30.7%). The median time to dose 
reduction due to AE was 42 days (range 5-610). Adverse events leading to dose modification 
(interruption and/or reduction) occurred in 305 patients (65.0%). 
In the group of patients treated at a starting dose of 20mg QD, AEs leading to dose modification were 
reported in 218 patients (68.6%). The most frequently reported AEs resulting in dose modification in 
this group were hyperphosphatemia (n=83, 26.1%), ALT increased (n=30, 9.4%), and AST increased 
(n=23, 7.2%). Adverse events considered related to study treatment and leading to dose modification 
were reported for a total of 172 patients (54.1%); the most frequently reported TRAEs included 
hyperphosphatemia (n=83, 26.1%), ALT increased (n=27, 8.5%) and palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (n=21, 6.6%). 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety assessment is based on a pooled analysis containing data from the 103 patients 
treated in the pivotal study TAS-120-101 phase 2, and data from 42 patients treated in the phase 1 
dose expansion part of this same study. This safety data group 1 (SDG1) represents the target 
population treated at the target dose. This pooling strategy is adequately justified and safety data for 
SDG1 is therefore presented in section 4.8 of the SmPC. As supportive safety information, safety data 
on patients with all solid tumours, treated at any dose level in the TAS-120-101 study (phase 1 dose 
escalation, dose expansion and phase 2) and the Japanese study 10059010 (dose escalation and 
expansion) is summarized in SDG2 (n=469). SDG2 includes 318 patients treated with the proposed 
starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib. TAS-120-101 being an uncontrolled study, the assessment of 
treatment-relatedness of adverse events is hampered. However, some context for the safety profile is 
made available by data from the other approved FGFR-inhibitor, Pemazyre.  
Treatment duration in SDG1 was a median of 8.87 months, but it was only 2.76 months in SDG2. 
Because of this limited exposure, the safety profile of futibatinib is mainly characterised from the data 
in SDG1. Few patients were treated >12 months (n=53/469 with any tumour type at any starting 
dose, and n=41/318 at the proposed posology of 20mg QD), limiting the assessment of long-term 
toxicity as well as rare adverse events. However, considering the limited prognosis of the target 
population (median OS 21 months) and the fact that some additional safety data is expected from the 
proposed uncontrolled study TAS-120-205 including two dosing cohorts (20 mg and 16 mg QD), this is 
acceptable. 
Treatment-related AEs were very common, reported for 98.6% of patients in SDG1. 79 of these 
patients (54.5%) experienced at least 1 Grade ≥3 TRAE. The most frequently reported TRAEs, 
reported in at least 20% of patients, included hyperphosphatemia, alopecia, dry mouth, dry skin, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome and stomatitis. AEs of nail disorders 
were also common, although separate PTs did not occur in >20% of patients. Grade ≥3 TRAEs 
reported in ≥5% of patients included hyperphosphatemia, stomatitis and AST increased and palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome. These most common AEs are compatible with the safety profile 
as known from other FGFR-inhibitors and the patient population with advanced cancer. 
Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred at a somewhat higher frequency in SDG1 compared to SDG2 (54.5 vs 
44.7%), but this can be explained by the longer treatment duration and exposure in SDG1. In SDG2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 104/118 
 
 
 
the most common TRAEs by PT and SOC were comparable to the most frequent adverse events in 
SDG1. 
There were no on-treatment deaths in both SDG1 or SDG2. Most deaths were due to progressive 
disease.  
In SDG2, there were 2 deaths due to AEs, including one event of fatal renal failure within the 30-day 
safety follow-up period. Acute kidney injury is listed as an important potential risk for the other 
registered FGFR-inhibitor Pemazyre. This death was not treatment related. 
Based on safety signals during preclinical or clinical trials, or based on class effects of similar drugs, 
retinal disorders, hyperphosphatemia, hepatotoxicity, nail disorders, PPES, and rash were defined as 
adverse events of special interest (AESI) for futibatinib.  
In SDG1 and SDG2, treatment-related retinal disorders were infrequent (6.2 and 7.7%, 
respectively), most were grade 1 and the six grade 2 events all resolved to <grade 2. Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC includes recommendations on ophthalmological examinations and retinal disorders are 
included in the RMP as important identified risk.  
Hyperphosphatemia is related to the mechanism of action of FGFR-inhibitors. Of note, grading of 
hyperphosphatemia AEs did not use CTCAE v4.03 (which does not include criteria for grading of 
hyperphosphatemia), but was conducted based on serum phosphate levels. In this adjusted grading, 
Grade 3 was defined as serum phosphate level >7 mg/dL (>2.26 mmol/L) irrespective of clinical 
symptoms. This explains the higher frequency of hyperphosphatemia Grade ≥3 for futibatinib 
compared to the frequency as found for Pemazyre.  
There were no SAEs, no deaths and no treatment discontinuations due to hyperphosphatemia. In most 
patients, hyperphosphatemia was managed with use of phosphate lowering medication (83.4%), dose 
reductions were necessary for 17.9% of patients and interruptions in 18.6%. Complications from 
hyperphosphatemia have been observed with futibatinib treatment (n=4). In sections 4.2 and 4.4 of 
the SmPC, information on the risk of soft-tissue mineralization is included and adequate dosing 
recommendations for hyperphosphatemia are provided. 
Hypophosphatemia was reported as a TEAE in 21 patients (14.5%) in SDG1. Based on evaluation of 
laboratory results the incidence was higher, i.e. 44.2% with 13.7% grade ≥3 events. 
Hypophosphatemia can be related to the use of phosphate-lowering therapies in case of treatment-
induced hyperphosphatemia, which is illustrated by the fact that 17 out of 31 patients in this analysis 
had a TEAE of hypophosphatemia during the follow-up period (i.e., after futibatinib discontinuation) or 
while futibatinib treatment was interrupted, including 15 patients receiving phosphate lowering therapy 
due to previous hyperphosphatemia. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC mentions that phosphate-lowering therapy should be stopped if futibatinib 
treatment is discontinued. The frequency of grade ≥3 events is not negligible (5.7% investigator 
reported and 13.7% laboratory derived). Instead of a warning, a description of the symptoms of 
hypophosphatemia to the recommendation is added in section 4.2 of the SmPC, in line with the 
description of hypophosphatemia symptoms in the Pemazyre SmPC. 
It is acceptable that hyperphosphatemia is not included in the RMP as an important identified risk, in 
contrast to the RMP of Pemazyre. It is agreed with the applicant that hyperphosphatemia is a well-
known risk for which sufficient warnings and recommendations are in place in the SmPC, therefore 
routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered sufficient.  
Hepatotoxicity occurred in 29% of patients in SDG1, including 18 patients (12.4%) with Grade ≥3 
events. It is agreed that none of the reported events met Hy’s law criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 105/118 
 
 
 
No specific dosing recommendations in case of hepatotoxicity are included in the SmPC, which is 
acceptable based on relatively low frequency and grade of events.  
Nail disorders were frequent but led to treatment modification in a low percentage of patients.  
PPES was reported for 33 patients (22.8%) in SDG1, all but one were considered treatment-related. 
PPES was managed with use of concomitant medications in most patients, and/or futibatinib dose 
modifications (9.7% reductions/9.0% interruptions); there were no dose discontinuations due to PPES.  
Other eye disorders were frequently reported with futibatinib (43.4%), but Grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
reported for only 3 patients (2.1%). The SmPC contains recommendations regarding ophthalmological 
examinations because of the AESI of retinal disorders, which is considered adequate.  
Acute kidney injury is listed as an important potential risk for the other registered FGFR-inhibitor 
Pemazyre. In the pivotal study on pemigatinib, creatinine increase was reported as a TEAE for 99% of 
patients. For futibatinib, blood creatinine increased was only reported for 13.8% of patients in SDG1. It 
was clarified that pemigatinib is a very potent inhibitor for OCT2 while futibatinib has no inhibitory 
effect on OCT2, which can explain the difference in reported incidence for kidney injury with both 
treatments. 
In in vitro studies, futibatinib acts as an hERG channel blocker. However, no cardiovascular effect 
was found in animal studies and futibatinib did not prolong the QTc interval at therapeutic and 
supratherapeutic doses in healthy volunteers.  
Few patients >65 years of age are included in the clinical studies (89 patients aged >65 years were 
treated at the 20mg QD dose), limiting the assessment of safety in elderly patients. The occurrence 
of TEAEs, TRAEs and SAEs appears comparable between patients <65 years of age and >65 years of 
age. However, the pattern is somewhat different with mainly gastro-intestinal side effects (decreased 
appetite, stomatitis, dysgeusia), urinary tract infection and hyponatremia reported more frequently in 
the elderly population. No conclusion can be drawn in smaller age cohorts because of the limited 
numbers. In the subgroup analyses by geographic region and previous treatment, no conclusions could 
be drawn due to the low number of patients in some subgroups. 
No analysis of safety in patients with hepatic impairment or renal impairment was provided in the 
dossier. Patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. The 
applicant has discussed any available safety data in patients with mild or moderate hepatic or renal 
impairment. The absence of (safety) data in patients with severe hepatic impairment is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Futibatinib is a substrate for CYP3A. The information in the SmPC regarding co-administration with 
moderate and strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A is considered adequate. 
Dose modifications were frequent, with 79.3% of patients experiencing at least 1 dose interruption 
(mostly due to AEs; n=92, 63.4%) and 53.1% experiencing a dose reduction, most of which (n=74, 
51.0%) were also due to AEs. This indicates the limited tolerability of the proposed starting dose of 
20mg QD, however, apparently treatment could be successfully continued at a lower dose because the 
discontinuation rate due to AEs was low (2.1%). 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of futibatinib is characterized by a high incidence of low-grade adverse events, which 
are compatible with the mechanism of action (hyperphosphatemia, PPES, gastro-intestinal symptoms) 
and a patient population with advanced cancer (fatigue, dry mouth and dry skin).

3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignancy originating in the epithelial lining of the biliary tree and it is 
commonly classified based on anatomical location; extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which includes 
hilar and distal tumours, accounts for the majority of cases, while intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
accounts for approximately 5-10% of the cases. The incidence of CCA is overall rare, with 1 to 3 
patients per 100,000 in regions like the United States and Europe (Banales 2016; Khan 2019). The 
prognosis of patients with Stage III or IV CCA is poor, with 5-year survival rates of 10% and 0%, 
respectively. The natural history of CCA with FGFR alterations and its prognostic role is not fully 
characterised. FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) occur in about 10% to 16% of patients with 
iCCA (Krook 2020; Jain 2018). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The first-line, standard-of-care treatment for patients with unresectable and metastatic disease was 
gemcitabine and cisplatin at the time of study conduct (ESMO 2016). Recently the ESMO guideline has 
been updated to recommend  cisplatin–gemcitabine–durvalumab for first-line treatment (ESMO 2022; 
positive CHMP opinion). 
Second line treatment 
Therapeutic options for patients who progress on first-line therapy are limited. 5-fluorouracil–
leucovorin–oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is recommended in the second-line setting (ESMO 2022). FGFR 
inhibitors are recommended for the treatment of patients with FGFR2 fusions whose disease has 
progressed after ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy. Tibsovo monotherapy is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an IDH1 R132 mutation 
who were previously treated by at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
On 28 January 2021, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional 
marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Pemazyre, intended for the second-line treatment of 
advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma characterized by fusion or rearrangements of FGFR 2 
(EPAR Pemazyre EMA/CHMP/105411/2021). On 23 February 2023 the CHMP adopted a positive opinion 
recommending the granting of a MA for the IDH1-inhibitor Tibsovo (ivosidenib) for the treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an IDH1 R132 mutation 
who were previously treated by at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
• 
Unmet Medical Need 
Therapeutic options for patients who progress on standard therapy are limited. A systematic review 
including 761 patients showed a median PFS (3.2 months; 95% CI: 2.7–3.7) and response rates 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 109/118 
 
 
 
(7.7%; 95% CI: 4.6–10.9); the mean OS was 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.2–8.2) in the second-line (ESMO 
Guideline biliary cancer and Lamarca et al. 2014). 
Multiple FGFR inhibitors are in development for CCA. The oral FGFR1-3 inhibitor pemigatinib has 
received a conditional marketing authorisation for the treatment of patients with previously treated 
CCA harbouring FGFR2 rearrangements/fusions, see above. Tibsovo monotherapy is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an isocitrate 
dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1 R132) mutation who were previously treated by at least one prior line of 
systemic therapy. FGFR2 alterations occur in roughly 10% to 15% of cholangiocarcinoma, however, 
they rarely co-occur with IDH1 mutations (co-occurrence in approximately 2% to 5%) (Battaglin et al, 
2020; Jain et al, 2018; Valle et al, 2017; Saborowski et al, 2020). An unmet medical need however 
remains. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy data supporting the present application comes from the phase 2 portion of study TAS-120-
101 including 103 iCCA patients harbouring FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements of the 
open label single arm phase 1/2 study of TAS-120 in patients with advanced solid tumours with 
FGF/FGFR aberrations. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with 
objective evidence of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 
1.1 per independent central radiographic review. 
The secondary endpoints are DOR, DCR, PFS, PROs and OS. 
The sample size for the phase 2 part of study TAS-120-101 was based on ruling out an ORR of 10% or 
less. An interim analysis was planned when approximately 70% of all treated patients had 6 months of 
follow-up. No formal stopping rules were described for this analysis and no adjustment of the Type I 
error was pre-specified. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the primary analysis by independent review, for the 103 patients in the efficacy population, 
treatment with futibatinib resulted in a confirmed ORR of 41.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.1, 
51.9).  
At the time of the data cutoff date, with a median follow-up of 11.76 months the median DOR by 
Kaplan-Meier analysis for the 43 responders was 9.69 months (95% CI: 7.62, 17.05). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As the pivotal TAS-120-101 study is a single-arm trial without an active comparator there is a need to 
further confirm the efficacy. Results from the ‘single-arm’ Phase 2 Study TAS-120-205 (SOB) will be 
provided, which entail replication of the single-arm efficacy (and safety) data from the pivotal Study 
TAS-120-101 in a new and independent single-arm study cohort. 
The dose response curve is unknown. It is unknown if the optimal dose has been selected due to the 
absence of the dose response relationship studies based on the primary endpoint ORR used in part II 
of the study. The applicant intends to investigate the efficacy of a lower dose 16 mg in the SOB study 
TAS-120-205.   
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 110/118 
 
 
 
In the pivotal trial, only patients with intrahepatic CCA were included. Results from the pivotal trial 
population are extrapolated to the patients with extrahepatic CCA with FGFR2 gene rearrangements as 
the location of the tumour is not expected to affect the effect of the product. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were hyperphosphatemia (89.7%), nail disorders (44.1 
%), constipation (37.2%), alopecia (35.2%), diarrhoea (33.8%), dry mouth (31.0%), fatigue (31.0%), 
nausea (28.3%), dry skin (27.6%), increased AST (26.9%), abdominal pain (24.8%), stomatitis 
(24.8%), vomiting (23.4%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (22.8%), arthralgia 
(21.4%), and decreased appetite (20.0%). The most common AEs are compatible with the safety 
profile as known from other FGFR-inhibitors and the patient population with advanced cancer. 
54.5% of patients experienced at least 1 Grade ≥3 TRAE, most commonly hyperphosphatemia 
(26.9%), stomatitis and AST increased (6.2% each) and PPES (5.5%). 
SAEs were reported in 40.7% of patients. Of these, 35.9% were ≥ grade 3, most frequently disease 
progression (n=6, 4.1%) and sepsis (n=4, 2.8%). SAEs were considered treatment-related in 9.0% of 
patients (n=13), none of these were grade 4 or 5 events. Treatment-related SAEs reported in >1 
patient included intestinal obstruction (n=2, grade 3) and migraine (n=2, grade 2). 
Seven patients (4.8%) in SDG1 had AEs with an outcome of death, none of these events were 
assessed as treatment-related. There were no on-treatment deaths in both SDG1 or SDG2. Most 
deaths were due to progressive disease. 
Retinal disorders, hyperphosphatemia, hepatotoxicity, nail disorders, PPES, and rash were defined as 
AESI for futibatinib. Treatment-related retinal disorders were infrequent (7.7%), most were grade 1 or 
2 events and resolved to <grade 2 upon dose modification. The SmPC includes recommendations on 
ophthalmological examinations and retinal disorders are included in the RMP as important identified 
risk. There were no SAEs, no deaths and no treatment discontinuations due to hyperphosphatemia. In 
most patients, hyperphosphatemia was managed with use of phosphate lowering medication (83.4%), 
dose reductions were necessary for 17.9% of patients and interruptions in 18.6%. 
Dose modifications were frequent, with 79.3% of patients experiencing at least 1 dose interruption 
(mostly due to AEs; n=92, 63.4%) and 53.1% experiencing a dose reduction, most of which (n=74, 
51.0%) were also due to AEs. This indicates the limited tolerability of the proposed starting dose of 
20mg QD, however, apparently treatment could be successfully continued at a lower dose because the 
discontinuation rate due to TRAEs was low (2.1%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
TAS-120-101 being an uncontrolled study, the causality assessment of adverse events is hampered. 
However, some context for the safety profile can be obtained with the data from the other FGFR-
inhibitor, Pemazyre. 
Few patients were treated >12 months (n=53/469 with any tumour type at any starting dose, and 
n=41/318 at the proposed posology of 20mg QD), limiting the assessment of long-term toxicity as well 
as rare AEs. Some additional safety data is foreseen from the proposed Study TAS-120-205, but no 
comparative safety data will become available, as this study does not include a standard-of-care 
control arm either. No additional pharmacovigilance activities are proposed for long-term toxicity or 
rare AEs, given the limited prognosis of the target population.

No analysis of safety in patients with hepatic impairment or renal impairment was provided in the 
dossier. Patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment were excluded from the clinical studies. This 
is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Only one single-arm phase I/II study was submitted to support the efficacy of futibatinib in second line 
treatment of patients with iCCA with FGFR2 gene fusions or other FGFR2 rearrangements and as a 
consequence, several aspects need explicit consideration. The results show a clinically relevant 
antitumour activity (ORR 41.7%) with a duration of response (median 9.7 months). Time-to-event 
secondary endpoints PFS and OS are not interpretable without a comparator arm. In combination with 
the uncertainty on the impact of FGFR2 genetic alterations on prognosis, the clinical results need 
confirmation. The applicant, therefore, proposes to conduct Study TAS-120-205 as specific obligation 
(SOB) in context of the CMA, to provide comprehensive clinical data within an appropriate timeframe 
to confirm that the benefit-risk balance is positive. For further information, see below section 3.7.3 
Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance. 
Efficacy results need to be weighed against the safety profile, which is mainly characterised by a high 
frequency of low grade events, which are compatible with the mechanism of action 
(hyperphosphatemia, PPES, gastro-intestinal symptoms) and the patient population with advanced 
cancer (fatigue, dry mouth and dry skin). Dose interruptions and reductions due to AEs were frequent, 
indicating the limited tolerability of the proposed starting dose of 20 mg QD. However, apparently 
treatment could be successfully continued at a lower dose because the discontinuation rate due to AEs 
was low. Hyperphosphatemia and retinal disorders are important risks for which adequate 
recommendations are included in the SmPC. These could generally be managed with supportive 
therapy or dose modifications, but rarely led to treatment discontinuations. 
Exposure was limited and few patients were treated >12 months, hampering the assessment of 
long-term toxicity as well as the identification of rare adverse events. However, this is acceptable 
considering the poor disease prognosis. Furthermore, additional safety data is expected from the 
proposed SOB Study TAS-120-205. This study might also provide more information regarding the 
safety in elderly patients, which is now limited given that few patients >65 years of age were included 
in the clinical studies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The reported ORR and DOR are considered clinically relevant in the target population of patients with 
iCCA with FGFR2 gene rearrangements in second line treatment. Considering the uncertainties due to 
the single-arm trial design, the clinical results need independent confirmation of the positive benefit-
risk balance of futibatinib to be provided as SOB. 
The safety profile of futibatinib is characterized by a high incidence of low grade adverse events, which 
are compatible with the mechanism of action (hyperphosphatemia, PPES, gastro-intestinal symptoms) 
and a patient population with advanced cancer (fatigue, dry mouth and dry skin). Dose interruptions 
and reductions were frequent, indicating the limited tolerability of the proposed starting dose of 20 mg 
QD, however, apparently treatment could be successfully continued at a lower dose because the 
discontinuation rate due to AEs was low. 
The benefit-risk balance is positive.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. In 
addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
The applicant will submit the results of Study TAS-120-205, a global, open-label Phase 2 study in 
patients with advanced, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements who 
have received at least one prior systemic therapy. A total of 120 patients will be randomized (1:1) to 
receive futibatinib at a starting dose of either 20 mg (Arm A) or 16 mg (Arm B) orally QD. The primary 
endpoint will be ORR according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by blinded independent central review 
(BICR) with duration of response (DOR) being a key secondary endpoint. The primary analysis will be 
based on the 20 mg treatment arm. 
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of futibatinib in a similar sample size of patients overall to 
that from the Phase 2 portion of Study TAS-120-101, to provide both replication of evidence on ORR 
and DoR and a consequent increase in size to the safety dataset. 
The applicant considers this second-line study to be feasible for the following reasons: 
- 
- 
- 
Enrolment of 120 patients appears reasonable; 
the second-line treatment setting allows for biomarker testing while the patient is receiving 
first-line therapy and is thus more aligned with clinical practice; and 
the study design ensures that all patients will receive treatment with futibatinib which is expected 
to promote enrolment. 
The currently proposed study is (also) a post-marketing requirement by the FDA. 
Regarding the timelines, it is planned: 1) patient enrolment completed Q2 2026; 2) database lock for 
primary analysis Q1 2027; and 3) submission of results to CHMP Q4 2027. 
This SOB is a replication of the single-arm efficacy (and safety) data in a new and independent single-
arm study cohort in order to provide a comprehensive overall data package. 
For clarity, the term ‘single-arm’ also encompasses studies that contain more than one arm, but do not 
randomise to a control for a formal comparison, i.e. non-randomised trials as well as trials in which 
only experimental arms are randomised, but without formal comparisons between the arms (text taken 
from draft reflection paper single-arm trials). With the term ‘randomized, controlled trial’ (‘RCT’) is 
meant here a study that does include a formal comparison to a (standard-of-care) control. 
Such independent replication of single-arm data by a separate single-arm cohort has previously been 
accepted to provide comprehensive data resulting in a full approval. 
The proposed study, TAS-120-205, will provide additional data in a study population similar to the 
pivotal study population. The efficacy (and safety) data of the 60 patients in the 20 mg Arm A can 
serve to verify and confirm the benefit-risk balance of futibatinib as observed in the 103 patients in the 
pivotal Study TAS-120-101. The total (efficacy) dataset will thus be comprised of approximately 160 
Assessment report  
EMA/218116/2023  
Page 114/118 
 
 
 
patients with advanced, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that 
has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. In the light of the observed efficacy 
(ORR and DOR) and safety in the pivotal study, and provided replication of these results is submitted, 
such a dataset can be considered comprehensive and support a full approval.  
Importantly, the efficacy (and safety) data of the 60 patients in the 16 mg Arm B will be regarded as 
supportive data. The 16 mg data will nevertheless be assessed and may be considered for e.g. 
inclusion in the SmPC, when scientifically justified and regarded as relevant information for prescribers. 
The finalised protocol of study TAS-120-205 (Amendment 1: 08 February 2023) has been provided. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed. 
Recent retrospective analyses have shown that the outcomes of post-first-line chemotherapy among 
the subset of patients with FGFR2 rearrangements/fusions appeared similarly poor as those seen in the 
overall population, including a response rate <6% for second-line chemotherapy (Javle 2020, ASCO 
Abstract). 
The oral FGFR1-3 inhibitor pemigatinib has received a conditional marketing authorisation for the 
treatment of patients with previously treated CCA harbouring FGFR2 rearrangements/fusions, based on 
clinical benefit concluded from ORR and DOR in an uncontrolled phase 2 study. A randomized Phase 3 
study as compared to standard of care chemotherapy in first-line advanced CCA patients with FGFR2 
rearrangements (including fusions) is ongoing as specific obligation. 
Tibsovo (ivosidenib) monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1 R132) mutation who were 
previously treated by at least one prior line of systemic therapy. FGFR2 alterations occur in roughly 
10% to 15% of cholangiocarcinoma, however, they rarely co-occur with IDH1 mutations 
(co-occurrence in approximately 2% to 5%) (Battaglin et al, 2020; Jain et al, 2018; Valle et al, 2017; 
Saborowski et al, 2020). Therefore, despite these developments an unmet medical need remains for 
adult patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 
fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
Importantly, Lytgobi is considered to address the unmet medical need to a similar extent to Pemazyre 
(that was also conditionally approved), considering that the clinical data packages of both medicinal 
products are qualitatively (and quantitatively) similar. Results for Lytgobi are comparable to the 
estimates that formed the basis for the conditional approval of pemigatinib in the same indication 
Furthermore, as FGFR2 alterations rarely co-occur with IDH1 mutations, Lytgobi can be considered to 
be of major therapeutic advantage to the large majority of patients with cholangiocarcinoma with a 
FGFR2 alteration. Their disease will lack a IDH1 R132 mutation and these patients are thus not eligible 
for treatment with Tibsovo (that has a full marketing authorisation). 
• 
 The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
The benefit-risk balance is positive and, taken the unmet medical need into account, it can be 
concluded that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh these risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Lytgobi is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lytgobi is not similar to Pemazyre and Tibsovo within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Lytgobi is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Lytgobi monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or 
rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing 
authorisation  
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

Description 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of futibatinib in adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements 
that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy, the MAH 
should submit the results of FOENIX-CCA4 (TAS-120-205), a phase 2 study of 
futibatinib at a starting dose of 20 mg QD (Arm A) and 16 mg QD (Arm B) in such 
patients.

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that futibatinib is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

5.1.  Divergent position(s) to the majority recommendation 
DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 26 April 2023 
Lytgobi EMEA/H/C/005627/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending 
the granting of the marketing authorisation of Lytgobi for the following indication: 
Lytgobi monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement that 
have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The  clinical  evidence  supporting  the  conditional  marketing  authorisation  of  Lytgobi  in  the  intended 
population is based on 103 patients treated in the single-arm trial (SAT) No. TAS-120-101, showing ORR 
of 41.7% (95% CI 32.1, 51.9), with no patient with CR (0%), and a median DOR of 9.7 month (95% CI 
7.6, 17.1).  
Notable, the level of evidence provided by a SAT is less robust compared to a randomized clinical trial 
(RCT), and outcomes such as ORR and DOR are subject to bias (e.g. selection bias) and various sources 
of variability. The SAT setting also impairs the causality assessment of several key unfavourable effects. 
Last, the results in ORR and DOR in the SAT No. TAS-120-101 study require confirmation that they will 
translate in a meaningful clinical benefit.  
Therefore, replication of single-arm efficacy (and safety) data in a new and independent SAT to provide 
a comprehensive overall data package is not acceptable. Confirmatory data from a RCT are considered 
necessary to provide comprehensive data suitable to confirm the positive benefit-risk balance of Lytgobi.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
C1 inhibitor (C1INH), a serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), is primarily synthesized in the liver and the 
normal range of C1INH activity in the general population is 0.7 to 1.3 U/mL (70 to 130%). The main 
function of C1INH is inhibition of several complement proteinases and contact-system proteinases.  
Hereditary  angioneurotic  oedema  (HAE)  is  characterized  by  recurrent,  often  unpredictable,  acute 
attacks  of  soft  tissue  swelling  (angioedema).  Acute  angioedema  attacks  in  HAE  patients  impair  the 
quality of life, and can be fatal if the angioedema swelling occurs in the throat. An untreated attack can 
persist for up to five days. Attacks of oedema of the gastrointestinal tract are associated with severe

pain  similar  to  acute  abdominal  syndromes  and  may  cause  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  ascites  and 
symptoms of hypovolemia.  
Two  types  of  congenital  functional  C1INH  deficiency  (phenotypic  variants)  can  be  distinguished  (HAE 
Type  I  and  HAE  Type  II).  Both  types  are  autosomal  dominant  disorders  and  the  levels  of  functional 
C1INH  in  plasma  are  below  50%  of  normal  levels.  The  median  plasma  level  of  C1INH  activity  in 
patients with HAE is about 0.2 U/mL, or 20% of the level found in healthy individuals 
Key  inflammatory  mediators  regulated  by  C1INH  of  concern  for  patients  with  HAE  include  activated 
proteases of the complement system such as C1r, C1s and Mannan Binding protein (MBP)-associated 
proteinases (MASPs), and factor XIIa, factor XIa and kallikrein of the contact system (Figure 1). Over 
activity  of  these  inflammatory  proteases  is  thought  to  lead  to  the  generation  of  vasoactive  peptides 
such as bradykinin that mediate angioedema attacks.

The current available treatments of acute attacks of HAE include: 
•  Human  C1INH  preparations,  which  are  purified  and  pasteurized  concentrates  from  pooled 
human  plasma  (one  approved  in  most  EU  member  states  via  the  Mutual  Recognition 
Procedure, one is approved in the Netherlands); 
Icatibant  (approved  through  the  centralised  procedure),  which acts  as  a  selective  competitive 
antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 (B2) receptor. 
• 
Conestat  alfa,  the  active  substance  of  Ruconest,  a  recombinant  human  component  1  (C1)  esterase 
inhibitor  (rhC1INH),  is  the  recombinant  analogue  of  human  C1  esterase  inhibitor  (C1INH),  and  is 
obtained  from  the  milk  of  rabbits  expressing  the  gene  encoding  for  human  C1INH.  The  transgenic 
rabbits,  which  are  genetically  modified  organisms  (GMO),  are  maintained  in  specific  pathogen  free 
enclosed  housings.  The  product,  however,  is  not  a  GMO.  The  availability  of  a  non-blood  product 
derived C1INH for treatment of acute attacks of HAE provides a further treatment option for patients. 
The  applicant  Pharming  Group  N.V.  submitted  a  complete  and  independent  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  for  Ruconest  (previously  known  as  Rhucin)  for 
treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase 
inhibitor deficiency.  
Ruconest was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the EU with the following orphan indication: 
treatment  of  angioedema  caused  by  C1  inhibitor  deficiency.  HAE  was  considered  as  chronically 
debilitating conditions, characterised by acute and repetitive attacks, which might be life-threatening. 
The  calculated  prevalence  of  this  condition  at  the  time  or  orphan  medicinal  product  designation  was

2.1  per  10,000  EU  population.  The  significant  benefit  at  the  time  of  designation  was  based  on  major 
contribution to  patient  care  with  regards  to  currently  authorised  medicinal  products  on  the  basis  of  a 
source of non-blood derived C1INH. 
In connection with the review of the orphan designation criteria by the Committee on Orphan Medicinal 
Products  (COMP)  at  its  meeting  of  7-8  September  2010,  the  Applicant  requested  the  Commission  to 
remove the product from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products on 9 September 2010. 
The  applicant  received  Protocol  Assistance  from  the  CHMP  on  the  quality,  preclinical  and  clinical 
development.  There  are  no  guidelines  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of 
acute  HAE  attacks.  The  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  used  in  the  two  RDCT  1205  and  1304  are 
mainly in line with the Protocol Assistance given by the CHMP.  
With  regard  to  the  paediatric  development,  the  applicant  has  agreed  to  generate  data  in  paediatric 
patients  aged  2-18  years;  these  data  are  not  yet  available  and  will  need  to  be  provided  post-
authorisation. Studies in patients under 24 months are not requested. 
This is the second marketing authorisation application (MAA) submitted for this medicinal product. The 
first MAA was submitted in July 2006 and received a negative opinion on the basis of the limited clinical 
database  and  concerns  regarding  severe  allergic  reactions  and  the  potential  for  immunogenicity 
following  repeated  administrations.  Additional  clinical  data  for  the  present  application  for  the  present 
MAA was submitted with two finalised placebo-controlled studies and data from the ongoing extension 
phases  of  the  two  open-label  studies.  The  current  data  also  specifically  addresses  immunogenicity, 
efficacy  in  laryngeal  attacks,  and  the  possibility  of  thrombogenic  potential.  Furthermore,  a  new  dose 
regimen was proposed. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
“Ruconest  is  indicated  for  treatment  of  acute  angioedema  attacks  in  patients  with  hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency” 
The finally approved indication is as follows: 
“Ruconest is indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults with hereditary angioedema 
(HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.” 
The product is administered by intravenous injection. The posology is one single dose of 50 U/kg body 
weight for adults up to 84 kg body weight or 4200 U for adults of 84 kg body weight and above. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
C1  inhibitor  (C1INH)  is  a  serine  protease  inhibitor  belonging  to  the  serpin  superfamily.  The  active 
substance of Ruconest is a recombinant analogue of human C1INH (rhC1INH, INN: conestat alfa) that 
is  purified  from  the  milk  of  rabbits  expressing  the  gene  encoding  for  human  C1INH.  It  is  a  plasma 
single-chain  glycoprotein  containing  478  amino  acids  with  six  sites  of  N-glycosylation  and  at  least 
seven  sites  of  O-glycosylation.  It  has  a  molecular  mass  of  approximately  67,000  Da  of  which 
approximately  22%  is  due  to  oligosaccharides.  The  amino  acid  sequence  has  been  provided  and 
includes two disulphide bonds (between cys101- cys406 and cys108 - cys183).  
The  drug  product  is  presented  as  a  powder  for  solution  for  injection.  It  is  a  sterile,  non-pyrogenic, 
preservative-free,  white  to  off-white  lyophilized  powder  contained  in  a  single-use  type  I,  colourless 
sealed glass vial. The product is to be reconstituted with 14 mL sterile water for injections (WFI) before 
intravenous  injection.  Each  vial  contains  2100  U  of  rhC1INH  (150  U/mL  after  reconstitution).  The 
excipients used in the formulation are sodium citrate, sucrose and citric acid.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  Manufacture 
Generation of the transgenic herd 
The genomic DNA fragment containing the C1 inhibitor gene and flanking regions was isolated from a 
P1 phage clone. The promoter regions are derived from the casein sequences since the caseins are the 
predominant milk proteins.  
Microinjection of DNA into a fertilized oocyte and transfer of the embryo into a foster mother led to the 
generation  of  a  transgenic  rabbit  (Generation  F0).  This  transgenic  male  animal  was  selected  as  the 
founder, establishing a transgenic line. The founder line was selected on the basis of expression level 
of C1INH in milk, gene copy number, site of integration and number of integration sites. The suitability 
of the selected line was determined by monitoring stability of expression throughout lactation, stability 
of  transmission  of  the  transgene,  health  and  fertility  of  the  rabbits  Following  breeding  with  a  non-
transgenic  female,  an  F1  male  was  selected  for  genetic  characterization  and  sperm  collection  to 
establish  the  Master  Transgenic  Bank  (MTB).  From  the  MTB,  transgenic  bucks  were  generated  and 
genetically  characterized.  The  selected  bucks  were  then  used  to  establish  a  Manufacturing  Working 
Transgenic sperm Bank (MWTB). 
The  development  genetics  has  been  fully  discussed  with  relevant  information  provided  about  gene 
construction  and  identity,  copy  number,  integration  site  and  stability.  Similarly,  the  information 
provided  on  the  establishment,  maintenance  and  pathogen  safety  of  the  transgenic  line  of  rabbits  is 
satisfactory.  A  two  tier  sperm  bank  has  been  established  and  production  is  limited  to  transgenic  F4 
female New Zealand White rabbits, therefore preventing the possibility of genetic drift.  
Manufacture of milk starting material 
The  manufacture  of  the  milk  starting  material  includes  breeding,  maintenance  and  milking  of 
transgenic rabbits.  
A production rabbit colony is a group of rabbits of defined and tested genealogy housed in containment 
behind a biosecurity barrier.  
After a general health check, the rabbits are milked using a milking machine. Following collection and 
storage,  the  milk  is  skimmed  by  centrifugation  and  frozen  before  transfer  to  storage  facilities.  Milk 
from individual rabbits may be pooled prior to skimming.  
Besides maintenance of the rabbits as “closed” colonies behind a biosecurity barrier, a comprehensive 
health monitoring program for control of production and sentinel animals are used to control the safety 
of  the  raw  material  of  the  skimmed  milk.  The  applied  control  procedures  are  considered  acceptable. 
Pooling of thawed skimmed milk is adequately described and ensures a consistent starting material for 
the  downstream  purification.  Control  of  the  process  is  adequate,  including  in-process  controls  for  the 
milking of the female rabbits as well as specifications for skimmed milk.  
Manufacture of formulated drug substance 
The formulated drug substance is manufactured and routinely controlled in compliance with GMP. 
The downstream processing of the milk consists of thawing of milk, pooling of milk bags, fat removal 
by  centrifugation  and  a  succession  of  filtration  and  chromatography  steps  as  well  as  viral 
formulated  using  ultra-/diafiltration  and 
inactivation/removal  steps.  The  drug  substance 
subsequently filtered and filled in a bag for storage.

Validation 
Three  consecutive  process  validation  runs  at  commercial  scale  have  been  performed  and  extended  in 
process control tests have been presented for these batches and compared to data collected from pilot 
scale  batches.  These  data  have  adequately  validated  the  process  and  demonstrates  process 
comparability  to  pilot  scale  manufacturing  runs.  A  summary  of  all  batches  which  have  been  used  in 
pre-clinical  and  clinical  trials  has  also  been  presented  and  comparability  of  (pre)-clinical  product  to 
commercial  product  has  been  demonstrated  by  validation  data  from  the  process  runs  and  extended 
characterisation of the product.

Characterisation 
The  product  has  been  extensively  characterised,  and  87%  of  the  amino  acid  backbone  has  been 
sequenced. The sites of the 2 disulphide bridges have been identified and 9 of the reported 13 sites of 
glycosylation  have  been  identified.  A  quantitative assay  for  isoform  analysis  has  been  developed  and 
will be implemented as a batch release assay. A quantitative specification will be set after the assay is 
validated  and  sufficient  batch  release  data  has  been  obtained.  Alongside  the  characterisation  data 
presented  in  the  dossier,  this  extent  of  sequence  identification  is  considered  to  be  adequate. 
Monosaccharide  composition  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  very  consistent.  Of  the  sialic  acids,  only 
NANA has been identified, the potentially immunogenic NGNA has not been found. The N-linked profile 
has  been  adopted  by  the  Applicant  as  a  drug  substance  batch  release  assay,  but  the  O-linked  assay 
has  not.  Instead,  the  applicant  has  successfully  argued  that  rates  of  sialylation  and  (O-glycosylation) 
site occupancy are the most important parameters to monitor instead of the O-glycosylation profile and 
a  site  occupancy  assay  is  currently  being  validated.  Sialylation  is  already  a  batch  release  parameter.  
The  Applicant  has  successfully  demonstrated  that  the  product  has  a  very  low  level  of  host  related 
impurities (milk proteins) and that this parameter is well controlled. Clinical assessment has confirmed 
a very low level of patient antibody formation to HRIs.  
2.2.2.2. 
 Specification 
Specifications for the skimmed milk intermediate and the formulated bulk drug substance are generally 
considered adequate to ensure a good level of control. The analytical methods used are considered to 
be  state-of-the-art  and  have  been  adequately  validated.  Each  batch  of  active  substance  is  tested  for 
appearance,  identity,  purity,  potency,  quantity,  excipients,  general  physicochemical  properties  and 
contaminants. 
The  rhC1INH  activity  assay  is  based  on  the  principle  that  C1s  activity  can  be  measured  using  a 
commercially  available  peptide.  C1s  cleaves  the  pNA  part  of  the  peptide,  which  absorbs  at  a 
wavelength of 405 nm. The amount of released pNA is directly proportional to the C1s activity. 
Consistency  of  the  protein  composition  of  the  skimmed  milk  starting  material  is  monitored,  and  a 
qualitative specification for this assay has been set and will be updated with quantitative specifications. 
To ensure blood proteins  have not leaked across the blood/mammary barrier, a specific test has also 
been  introduced  to  monitor  skimmed  milk.  A  specification  for  this  assay  will  be  set  after  20  batches 
have been analysed. 
The  applicant  has  committed  to  monitoring  the  O-glycan  profile  for  all  batches  of  drug  substance,  to 
complete validation of the O-glycan site occupancy assay and to introduce a specification for O-linked 
glycosylation.  
A new primary reference standard, derived from a commercial scale batch has been characterised and 
introduced.  The  procedure  to  introduce  new  reference  standards  has  been  provided.  This  reference 
standard  is  also  used  for  drug  product.  It  should  be  noted  that  International  Standards  for  C1INH 
(plasma and concentrate)  are being developed. The Applicant has committed to providing traceability 
to an international standard once established.  
Batch  release  data  has  been  provided  to  demonstrate  compliance  of  commercial  product  with  the 
specifications.  
2.2.2.3. 
 Stability 
Stability studies under real time, accelerated and stress conditions have been performed and the data 
provided support a drug substance shelf life of 3 years at -20°C.  
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

A  justification  of  the  formulation  components  has  been  provided,  along  with  a  description  of  how  the 
formulation was developed. A full description of manufacturing process development has been provided 
which  details  changes  to  the  process,  closure  system  and  fill  volume,  and  relates  changes  to  batch 
numbers and clinical studies.  
Initially, liquid formulations were investigated, however it was ultimately decided to have a lyophilised 
presentation as a liquid presentation was considered impractical. 
The same composition of drug product has been used throughout clinical development and this is the 
formulation intended for commercial batches.  
2.2.3.2. 
 Adventitious agents 
The rabbit is not considered to be a TSE susceptible species and therefore TSE considerations for the 
rabbit  milk  are  not  deemed  necessary.  Adequate  precautions  to  prevent  contamination  by  TSE  from 
alternative sources have been described.  
The  animals  are  kept  in  SPF  (specified  pathogen  free)  conditions  and  are  routinely  monitored  for 
evidence of viral contamination. The manufacturing process has been validated for the inactivation or 
removal  of  a  panel  of  relevant  or  model  viruses.  The  two  specific  virus  inactivation/removal  steps 
demonstrate  excellent  capacity  for  virus  depletion  with  the  three  chromatography  steps  also 
contributing  to  viral  safety.  A  risk  assessment  has  been  performed  based  on  the  worst  case  possible 
viral contamination (calculated from the LOD of the in vitro assays and quantity of starting material per 
dose) and validated virus removal capacity of the process.  
Overall,  and  taking  all  factors  into  consideration,  it  is  considered  that  this  product  should  not  pose  a 
risk to patients through adventitious agents.  
2.2.3.3. 
 Manufacture of the product 
Manufacture of the drug product, including labelling and packaging and batch release, is carried out at 
GMP-qualified sites. Batch release is performed by Pharming Technologies B.V., The Netherlands. 
The manufacturing process for the drug product has been described in sufficient detail. Batches of drug 
substance  are  thawed,  pooled,  sterile  filtered  and  filled  aseptically  into  vials.  The  drug  product  is 
thereafter  freeze-dried,  capped,  inspected,  packaged  and  stored  prior  to  shipment.  No  other

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMEA. 
2.2.3.6. 
 GMO 
The transgenic rabbits are considered to be genetically modified organisms (GMO). The manufacturer 
has been authorised by the authorities to handle transgenic rabbits in a contained environment and the 
rabbit housing areas are classified in accordance with GMO regulations. The product itself is not a GMO. 
2.2.3.7. 
 Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  have 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  Data  has  been 
presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  a  number  of  minor  unresolved  quality  issues  having  no 
impact  on  the  Risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and 
committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical testing program was conducted to establish the safety of rhC1INH for short term use 
(<  7  days)  in  this  chronically  debilitating  and  potentially  life-threatening  disease.  Studies  presented 
covered in vitro pharmacology, in vivo safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, general toxicology with 
dosing of up to two weeks, teratology in rats and rabbits and local tolerance. 
Two  different  pharmaceutical  presentations  were  developed:  a  liquid  formulation  of  25  mg/mL  and  a 
freeze-dried presentation. Liquid presentations were used in early non-clinical studies. However, from 
formulation  studies  it  became  apparent  that  a  lyophilized  formulation  was  preferred  for  stability 
reasons. Later studies were performed with the lyophilized presentations. 
Protocol  Assistance  from  CHMP  was  obtained  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  proposed  duration  of 
2 weeks  for  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  to  support  product  safety  with  regard  to  the 
intended  clinical  use  of  recombinant  human  C1  inhibitor  (acute  treatment  of  angioedema  caused  by 
C1 inhibitor deficiency). 
The pivotal safety studies were performed under GLP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Four in vitro studies assessing kinetics of binding with enzymes that are presumed to be inhibited by 
the  product  (C1s,  FXIa,  FXIIa,  kallikrein)  were  reported  as  the  primary  pharmacodynamic 
characterisation of rhC1INH. These studies report the second order rate constant of inhibition (kon) of 
rhC1INH, in comparison with that of human plasma-derived C1 INH, for batches used in preclinical and 
clinical studies. The results are presented in the table below. 
Table 5:  
Second order rate constants of rhC1INH and human plasma-derived  
C1INH at target enzymes 
These findings demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of rhC1INH towards the target enzymes (C1s, 
FXIa,  FXIIa  and  kallikrein)  can  be  regarded  to  be  comparable  with  plasma  derived  C1  inhibitor.  Most 
importantly,  rhC1INH  is  also  able  to  inhibit  the  activity  of  C1s  derived  from  human  and  cynomolgus 
monkey with equal efficacy. 
2.3.2.2. 
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies are presented. This is acceptable for this biotechnology-
derived product.  
2.3.2.3. 
 Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  was  assessed  in  one  in  vivo  study  evaluating  the  effect  of  rhC1INH  on 
cardiovascular  and  respiratory  systems  in  anaesthetised  dog.  Vehicle  or  625  U/kg  (corresponding  to 
104  mg/kg)  rhC1INH  was  administered  intravenously  in  a  crossover  design.  There  were  no  marked 
changes in the QTCB interval following treatment with vehicle or rhC1INH. No treatment-related effects 
were observed for the remaining monitored parameters (arterial blood pressure, heart rate, PR and QT 
interval and QRS complex duration). 
2.3.2.4. 
 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
C1INH has been shown to interact with clotting proteases. The treatment of an angioedema attack in 
HAE patients with rhC1INH will consist of a single dose of 50 U/kg, which will result in plasma levels of 
0.7 to 2 U per mL, i.e. 70 to 200% of the level in normal healthy subjects (see study C1 1101-01). It 
is  therefore  unlikely  that  rhC1INH  would  contribute  to  an  increased  risk  for  thromboembolic  side 
effects. In addition, steps have been taken to address the risk for thromboembolic events in the clinical 
part of development.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics was studied in rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys with detection methods applied 
that  are  suitable  overall.  The  species  used  for  analyses  of  pharmacokinetics  were  also  used  in  the 
safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. 
Single  intravenous  dose  administration  of  several  rhC1INH  batches  was  studied  in  rats.  Results  of 
toxicokinetic  blood  sampling  during  toxicology  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  (single  dose  toxicity  rats  and 
escalating dose toxicity in dogs) were also presented. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 11/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods 
Two methods for quantification of rhC1INH in plasma were described. The first was a functional assay 
using  the  commercially  available  C1-inhibitor  kit.  This  kit  is  used  in  clinical  practice  for  the 
determination  of  the  functional  activity  of  C1-inhibitor  in  plasma  to  diagnose  states  of  reduced  C1 
inhibitor concentration in plasma and for monitoring substitution therapy in patients. Validation of this 
method  was  shown  for  rat,  dog  and  human  plasma  samples.  Stability  of  plasma  samples  at  room 
temperature was assured for at least 72 hours and at -18 º C for at least 61 days, with stability over 
three freeze-thaw cycles. 
The second method was an ELISA which was applied to rat and dog plasma samples. Validation reports 
for  the  assessment  of  antibodies  to  rhC1INH  in  rat  plasma  and  their  neutralising  potential  were 
provided and considered  acceptable. The ELISA used in toxicity studies met the validation criteria for 
precision  and  specificity  at  low,  medium  and  high  concentrations  of  anti-rhC1INH  IgG.  It  was  noted 
that  there  is  some  crossreactivity  between  endogenous  rat  C1INH  and  human  C1INH  specific 
antibodies used in the ELISA. However, the applicant gave a quantitative consideration that pre-dose 
concentrations amounted to less than 0.01% of Cmax values. 
Absorption 
As  the  product  is  intended  for  intravenous  administration  only,  no  studies  in  animals  were  done  by 
other routes and no studies were conducted to assess bioavailability. 
Distribution 
No  specific  studies  assessing  distribution  of  rhC1INH  were  reported.  However,  from  the  single  dose 
administration  of  rhC1INH  in  rats  and  escalating  dose  administration  in  dogs,  the  Cmax  values  were 
considered to be in accordance with the measured concentration of the injected dose. 
Metabolism 
The role of hepatic receptors in removing rhC1INH from the blood circulation was studied in a non-GLP 
single  dose  pharmacokinetic  study.  RhC1INH  was  administered  in  male  Wistar  rats  treated  with 
competitors for the asialoglycoprotein receptor on parenchymal liver cells and the mannose receptor on 
liver endothelial cells. 
Results  indicate  that  the  exposure  and  half  life  were  each  greater  and  the  elimination  rate  constant 
(ERC  in  table  6)  was  reduced  when  either,  or  both,  inhibitors  were  injected  just  prior  to  injection  of 
rhC1INH.  These  results  suggest  that  rhC1INH  is  mainly  cleared  from  the  circulation  by  the  liver  via 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Removal is dependent on clearance mechanisms that are saturable at 
higher  doses.  This  is  inferred  to  be  mannose  receptors  and  hepatic  asialoglycoprotein  receptors  both 
located  mainly  in  the  liver.  The  product  is  presumed  to  be  broken  down  in  the  liver.  This  is 
acknowledged in the SPC which includes a statement regarding use in patients with hepatic impairment.   
Table 6: 
Pharmacokinetic  data  (mean)  showing  delayed  clearance  of  rhC1INH  when 
blocking the asialoglycoprotein receptor, the mannose receptor, or both 
Excretion 
No specific excretion studies were reported as, according to the applicant, the pathway of amino acid 
degradation is generally understood. This was considered to be acceptable for this product. 
Other Pharmacokinetic Studies 
The  product  is  presented  as  a  lyophilisate  for  reconstitution.  Some  of  the  studies  in  animals  used  a 
liquid formulation which was not adopted for commercialisation due to the lyophilisate being preferred 
for pharmaceutical reasons. Pharmacokinetic comparison of batches of liquid formulation with batches 
of lyophilized formulation failed to demonstrate comparability between both formulations.

Results shown in the table below indicate that the half life of rhC1INH was less than 20 minutes and 
the volume of distribution was close to the blood volume. No difference was seen between the batches. 
Table 7: 
Mean  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  various  rH-C1INH  after  a  single 
intravenous dose in male Wistar rats 
An  additional  study  comparing  2  pilot  scale  and  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  rhC1INH  revealed 
differences  for  Cmax  and  AUC  between  the  groups,  however  this  was  considered  as  not  significant. 
Overall, bioanalytical comparability was considered to be demonstrated. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program was designed to reflect the anticipated short-term use of rhC1INH in humans, 
and included single-dose studies in rat, dog, cynomolgus monkeys, repeat-dose studies in rats (up to 2 
weeks), dogs (up to 5 days), cynomolgus monkeys and marmosets. Embryofetal development studies 
were  performed  in  rat  and  rabbit,  and  local  tolerance  was  studied  in  the  rabbit.  Immunogenicity  was 
evaluated in rats, rabbits and monkeys. 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The single dose toxicity study conducted in rats using intravenous administration showed tolerability at 
doses achieving about 7 to 9 fold excess the human plasma concentration. rhC1INH was administered 
once at doses of 0, 25, 125, 625 and 1250 U/kg. 
Treatment-related clinical signs were mainly piloerection at the highest dose.  
In addition, the enlargement of spleen in 2/3 male rats may be evidence for immunological reactions. 
The maximal exposure to functional rhC1INH in this study was achieved in rats given the highest dose, 
1250  U/kg.  The  mean  maximal  concentration  was  18,562  mU/mL  (3094  mcg/mL).  In  comparison, 
plasma  concentration  in  patients  after  the  proposed  dose  of  100  U/kg  (approximating  to  the 
recommended  dose  of  15  mg/kg)  was  typically  between  2,000  and  3,000  mU/mL.  This  concentration 
was achieved in some rats given 125 U/kg.  
Overall, the rat study demonstrated tolerability at doses achieving about 7 to 9 fold excess the human 
plasma concentration. 
There was no effect on coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in this study.

There were no deaths in the tested species. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Toxicity  after  repeated  dose  was  assessed  in  two  studies  in  rats,  two  in  monkeys  (cynomolgus  and 
marmoset), and one in the dog.  
Rats 
In the rat, 2 studies were conducted, one using repeated daily administration for 4 days and one with 
continuous infusion over 14 days. 
In the 4-day study rats were treated with rhC1INH, from two batches, by slow intravenous infusion at 
doses of 0, 625 and 1250 U/kg once per day and with 1250 U/kg twice per day, with a 7 hour interval 
between doses, for 4 consecutive days with toxicokinetic evaluation. In addition, 5 rats/sex were kept 
for  a  recovery  period  of  10  days.  Anti-rhC1INH  antibody  determination  was  undertaken  on  all  rats, 
using samples taken just prior to termination on Days 4 and 14. Almost all rhC1INH-treated rats had a 
swollen  muzzle  and/or  limbs  after  treatment.  Swelling  persisted  beyond  7  hours  for  several  animals 
but regressed within 24 hours. The incidence of swelling generally decreased as the study progressed. 
There were no other signs of overt toxicity, no significant findings in laboratory investigations and no 
identified target organ of toxicity after histopathological examination. 
Among 90 rats given rhC1INH, 34 tested positive for IgG antibodies (38%). There was no correlation 
of antibody titre with dose, sex or whether rats were killed on Day 4 or 14. After two week recovery 
period  product-specific  antibody  (IgG)  titres  were  determined  by  ELISA.  None  or  only  relatively  low 
rhC1INH-specific antibody titres were measured in all groups.  
In the second repeated dose toxicity study, rats received a continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 
25,  125  or  625  U/kg/day  rhC1INH  and  625  U/kg/day  plasma  derived  C1INH  (pdC1INH)  for  14 
consecutive  days,  followed  by  a  14-day  observation  period,  and  including  toxicokinetics.  This  dosing 
route  design  (i.e.  continuous  infusion)  was  chosen  to  try  to  avoid  immunogenicity  associated  with 
repeated bolus administration. 
There were no effects of rhC1INH detected on any parameters measured in the study. The NOEL was 
therefore  determined  to  be  625  U/kg.  In  the  comparator  product  (plasma  derived  C1INH)  group, 
minimal  changes  in  haematological  and  clinical  biochemical  parameters  and  in  organ  weights 
(increases to liver, kidney and spleen) were observed. 
The exposure to rhC1INH achieved in this was significantly less than that achieved in other studies and 
was less with rhC1INH than with the comparator pdC1INH. However, it was noted that the maximum 
reported  plasma  concentration  was  much  lower,  compared  to  rats  treated  with  the  same  intravenous 
dose  of  625  U/kg  rhC1INH  once,  where  a  plasma  concentration  in  the  range  of  2351  -  3635  mU/mL 
was  reported  2  hours  after  dosing.  The  active  comparator  group  had  substantially  greater  exposure 
(concentrations  range  from  3179  to  6206  mU/mL  in  accordance  with  previous  studies.  The  low 
exposure  was  explained  by  faster  clearance  of  rhC1INH  compared  to  plasma  derived  C1INH  through 
receptor-mediated endocytosis by the liver. Based on this limited exposure, the study was considered 
to be of limited toxicological relevance.  
Investigation of antibody titres was performed for three groups (625 U/kg rhC1INH, 625 U/kg pdC1INH 
and  vehicle)  in  order  to  determine  the  immunogenicity  of  the  test  substance  in  rats  after  prolonged 
exposure. After five days no significant differences was found between groups. However, after day 16 
and day 29,  differences in antibody titres between rhC1INH and vehicle became highly significant. In 
addition,  the  titres  of  the  rats  dosed  with  plasma-derived  C1INH  were  not  significantly  increased  as 
compared to the control group (vehicle). Although these findings are not considered to be predictive of 
immunogenicity in humans, they might suggest differences in immunogenic properties of rhC1INH and 
pdC1INH.  The  immunogenic  potency  of  plasma  derived  C1INH  was  not  assessed  in  this  study  as 
immunogenicity was assessed using a validated test for rhC1INH. 
Dogs 
In  the  dog,  toxicity  was  investigated  in  a  dose  escalation  study  for  5  consecutive  days  administering 
doses  of  25,  125,  625,  or  1250  U/kg  rhC1INH  intravenously  to  2  males  and  2  females,  including 
toxicokinetic sampling.

There was no mortality or clinical signs of overt toxicity in either stage of this study. Total white blood 
cell  and  platelet  counts  were  decreased  with  reductions  in  the  relative  proportion  of  segmented 
neutrophils and increases in lymphocytes in both sexes. Neither APTT nor PT were altered by treatment 
with rhC1INH. Histopathological examination of all tissues did not reveal treatment-related findings. 
It was concluded that 5 daily treatments of 625 U/kg (104 mg/kg) did not results in toxic effects and 
that  daily  escalating  doses  that  reached  1250  U/kg  (208  mg/kg)  were  not  associated  with  overt 
toxicity. Toxicokinetic measurements demonstrated tolerability at doses achieving about 7 fold excess 
the human plasma concentration. 
Overall, the dose escalating study in dogs did not reveal treatment related adverse effects. 
Cynomolgus monkey 
In  cynomolgus  monkeys,  toxicity  was  investigated  in  a  dose  escalation  study  for  two  weeks 
administering  doses  of  250,  500,  1000,  or  2000  U/kg  rhC1INH  intravenously  into  21  males  and  21 
females twice daily. Dose-related histopathological changes (microvacuoles in epithelial cells lining the 
renal  tubules)  were  noted  in  the  kidneys  at  500  U/kg/administration  and  higher.  The  NOAEL  was 
estimated to be 1000 U/kg/administration. 
2.3.4.3. 
 Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed on the basis that the drug is unlikely to interact directly with 
DNA or other chromosomal material, in accordance with current guidelines (ICH S6R1). 
2.3.4.4. 
 Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed, on the basis that such studies are generally inappropriate 
for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. This is in agreement with current guidelines (ICH S6R1). 
2.3.4.5. 
 Reproduction Toxicity 
An  embryofoetal  development  study  in  pregnant  rats  to  assess  the  potential  for  teratogenicity  was 
performed by intravenous injection at one dose level of 625 U/kg with a parallel control group. During 
dosing, all drug-treated dams were observed to have swollen muzzles and limbs for up to 4 hours after 
dosing.  However,  there  were  no  other  abnormalities  noted  in  the  dams,  including  at  necropsy.  No 
adverse  effects  on  the  different  parameters  of  pregnancy  were  observed.  No  external,  visceral  or 
skeletal  abnormalities  were  noted  in  foetuses  and  there  was  no  difference  in  the  number  or  type  of 
skeletal  anomalies  or  variations.  Toxicokinetic  measurements  were  of  limited  value  as  the  sampling 
was  performed  24h  after  dosing  leading  to  values  of  endogenous  concentration  of  C1INH.  There  was 
no evidence of development of IgG antibodies to rhC1INH. 
In  rabbits  rhC1INH  caused  a  slight  delay  in  foetal  skeletal  ossification  but  not  otherwise  to  have  any 
adverse  effects  on  the  course  or  outcome  of  pregnancy.  Delayed  ossification  was  observed,  an  effect 
that is sometimes indicative of a nonspecific maternal effect and there was body weight loss in rabbits 
suggesting maternal toxicity. However, the formation of high titers of antibodies against rhC1INH has 
not  been  considered  by  the  applicant  as  a  possible  cause  of  the  detected  embryotoxicity.  The 
possibility  of  an  effect  on  reproduction  in  rabbits  was  not  excluded;  information  was  requested  to  be 
included in the SmPC, section 4.6 and section 5.3.   
Studies  on  fertility,  early  embryonic  and  postnatal  development  as  well  as  studies  in  which  the 
offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed have not been performed. It could not be excluded that rhC1INH 
will cross the placenta; foetal exposure and transfer in milk in lactating patients could not be excluded 
as  there  were  no  data  to  support  this  view.  However,  rhC1INH  was  rapidly  eliminated  by  receptor-
mediated endocytosis.

2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Table 8: 
Toxicokinetic data from treated rats (4-day study)  
The  systemic  exposure  was  similar  after  the  first  or  the  second  daily  administration  and  no 
accumulation was observed between days 0 and 2. AUC values increased proportionally between 625 
and 1250 U/kg/day for both sexes. There were no sex differences in Cmax and AUC. The Cmax data were 
approximately 10 fold the highest Cmax in human subjects at the recommended dose.

 * Dose normalization to 1 U/kg 
Toxicokinetic  data  from  cynomolgus  monkeys  in  study  R-03-040  from  one  female  and  male 
cynomolgus monkey were reported and suggests that Cmax and AUC increased in proportion with dose 
over the range 500-3000 U/kg/administration with no gender difference noted. The study design was 
to give two infusions on one day, 6 hours apart, and this has the consequence that at the time of the 
second dose, not all drug from the first dose had been eliminated. 
2.3.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was evaluated following administration of the liquid formulation in New Zealand White 
rabbits  and  in  the  4-day  rat  toxicity  study  using  the  lyophilised  formulation.  The  data  support  the 
conclusion that the product does not pose a risk of local intolerance.

2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity 
Investigation  of  antibody  titres  was  performed  in  repeat-dose  studies.  In  the  rat,  differences  in 
antibody titres between rhC1INH and vehicle became highly significant at the end of the investigation 
period whereas titres of the rats dosed with plasma-derived C1INH were not significantly increased as 
compared to the control group. 
The results from an additional repeat-dose study in rabbits confirmed that a high aggregate-containing 
presentation should not elicit immunogenic reactions in humans where there is some normal rhC1INH 
in their plasma. In cynomolgus the titers of antibodies increased with repeated dosing. However, titers 
showed no correlation with administered dose.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant justified the lack of an environmental risk assessment as proteins are exempt from this 
requirement in accordance with CHMP/SWP/447/00 guidance on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal products for Human Use. This position is deemed acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
rhC1INH was shown to have a pharmacological action similar to that of plasma-derived C1INH which is 
in  use  for  the  treatment  of  the  same  disease  for  which  approval  is  sought.  Although  the  applicant 
presented  no  data  from  in  vivo  studies  in  animals  supporting  the  claim  for  activity  in  the  indication, 
this is acceptable because C1INH is already well established as effective in this disease. The applicant’s 
task in the pharmacology section of the dossier was to establish that its rhC1INH protein derived from 
transgenic rabbits inhibits proteins of the complement, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in a similar 
manner to plasma-derived C1INH and secondly to establish that the drug is active in the species used 
in  toxicity  studies,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.  On  both  these  considerations,  the 
applicant’s  information  is  acceptable.  As  regards  whether  the  drug  acts  in  a  quantitatively  similar 
manner  in  animals  as  it  does  in  humans,  this  has  not  been  shown.  Thus,  the  safety  pharmacology 
study  quantifies  the  plasma  concentration  at  about  10  times  that  reached  in  humans  given  a 
therapeutic  dose,  but  as  it  is  not  known  whether  the  drug  is  equally  active  in  dogs  and  humans,  it 
cannot  be  concluded  that  the  degree  of  pharmacological  action  in  dogs  is,  in  fact,  10  times  that 
achieved  in  humans.  As  the  product  is  used  as  replacement  therapy  in  humans  and  quantitative 
comparison  has  been  shown  in  humans,  this  weakness  is  not  considered  significant,  as  regards  the 
pharmacology section of the dossier.  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  have  been  characterised  in  the  species  used  and  bioanalytical 
comparability  between  batches  was  considered  to  be  demonstrated.  Clearance  of  the  product  is 
occurring through receptor-mediated endocytosis by the liver. 
The  studies  to  assess  general  and  reproductive  toxicity  are  considered  adequate  in  respect  of  the 
choice of species, the duration of dosing, the route of dosing and the doses actually given to support 
the nature of the intended therapeutic use of rhC1INH in patients. The studies presented are adequate 
to  meet  expectations  of  ICHS6  guidance,  relating  to  development  of  biotechnology-derived 
pharmaceuticals (CHMP/ICH/286/1995). The single dose study in rats achieved 7-9 fold higher plasma 
concentrations  than  that  shown  in  humans  at  the  therapeutic  dose  with  no  toxicity  identified. 
Methodological  problems  were  encountered  in  the  14  day  continuous  dosing  study  in  rats  and  these 
limit the interpretation of this study as the relative exposures quoted for rhC1INH and the comparator 
plasma-derived  C1INH  are  inconsistent:  the  reported  plasma  concentrations  of  rhC1INH  were  much 
lower  than  those  of  plasma-derived  C1  INH.  The  applicant  suggests  this  difference  might  be  due  to 
slower clearance of plasma-derived C1INH arising from glycosylation differences. Studies in rats, dogs 
and  cynomolgus  monkeys  are  sufficient  to  support  registration  of  the  product  and  in  this  14  day  rat 
study,  no  significant  toxicity  was  identified.  Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  dogs  and  cynomolgus 
monkeys indicated  good  tolerability  of doses  well  in  excess  of  that  to  be  given  to  humans.  Given  the 
pharmacodynamic activity of rhC1INH to influence the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, particular 
attention was given to thrombogenic risk in this assessment. The applicant clearly presented findings 
from  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  that  prothrombin  and  partial  thromboplastin  times 
were unaffected, even at doses substantially in excess of that to be given therapeutically were given to 
animals  and  concluded  that  risks  of  thromboembolic  effects  are  very  low.  Nothing  was  noted  in 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010

necropsied  animals  that  indicated  thrombogenicity.  It  is  concluded  that  adequate  risk  assessment  for 
thrombogenicity has been presented in the dossier. Assessment of local tolerance was satisfactory. 
In the rat, differences in antibody titres between rhC1INH and vehicle became highly significant at the 
end  of  the  investigation  period  whereas  titres  of the  rats  dosed  with  plasma-derived  C1INH  were  not 
significantly  increased  as  compared  to  the  control  group.  These  findings  might  suggest  differences  in 
immunogenic properties of rhC1INH and pdC1INH. The immunogenic potency of plasma derived C1INH 
was not assessed in this study as immunogenicity was assessed using a validated test for rhC1INH. 
From the discussed rat study it can be concluded that the presence of neutralising antibodies directed 
against endogenous C1INH is unlikely. In addition, treated animals show no signs of angioedema which 
would be expected in animals with low levels of functional endogenous C1INH.  
No genototoxic or carcinogenic potential is expected from this biotechnology-derived product, justifying 
the absence of such studies. 
In  pregnant  animals,  no  toxicity  to  the  fetus  was  identified  at  doses  tolerated  by  maternal  rats. 
rhC1INH in rabbits did cause maternal bodyweight loss which may have given rise to a slight delay in 
development.  The  degree  to  which  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  rhC1INH  in  rabbits  had  been 
established  was  initially  judged  less  than  for  other  species,  and  the  applicant  was  asked  to  provide 
further  evidence  of  the  suitability  of  rabbits  from  a  pharmacodynamic  perspective.  This  was 
satisfactorily demonstrated using SDS-PAGE analyses of rabbit sera. When pregnant rabbits were given 
rhC1INH,  a  small  number  of  malformations  were  recorded  (eg  of  cardiac  vessel  defects)  which  were 
difficult  to  assess  as  either  product  related  or  unrelated.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  compare  the 
frequency  of  these  findings  with  historical  controls  and  although  the  absolute  number  was  low,  the 
frequency  was  notably  higher  than  background  (eg  1.12  v  0.03%).  The  possibility  of  an  effect  on 
reproduction  in  rabbits  was  not  excluded  hence  this  was  to  be  reflected  in  the  wording  in  the  SmPC, 
section 4.6 and section 5.3. 
No risk for the environment is expected. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A nonclinical testing programme has been performed which was overall considered appropriate and to 
meet  regulatory  guidances.  All  nonclinical  issues  have  been  addressed  satisfactorily  during  the 
assessment,  and  there  are  no  outstanding  nonclinical  concerns.  Relevant  information  has  been 
introduced into the SmPC.

2.4.2.  GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  properties  of  rhC1INH  were  investigated  in  four  phase  I/II  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers,  asymptomatic  HAE  patients  and  symptomatic  HAE  patients,  respectively,  at  doses  from 
6.25 U/kg  to  100 U/kg  (studies  1101-01,  1202-01,  1203-01,  1106-02).  In  addition,  pharmacokinetic 
sampling  for  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  made  in  the  pivotal  placebo-controlled  and 
open studies (1205-01, 1305-01). For details of these studies see tabular listing (Table 10). 
METHODS 
Analytical methods for determination of C1INH in plasma were adequately validated. Different methods 
were  also  developed  for  monitoring  an  immunogenic  response  in  patients.  Functional  C1INH  was 
determined  by  chromogenic  assay.  Antigen  levels  of  C1INH  were  determined  by  a  nepholemetric 
immunoassay. The sensitivity of these methods has been validated using mainly human citrate plasma 
samples spiked with known concentrations of anti-rabbit antibodies directed against C1INH or HRI, and 
the detection/quantification limits of the analyses are defined in ng/mL.  
The  use  of  plasma  was  required  for  complement  component  measurements  and  evidence  for  the 
suitability of plasma as a matrix for antibody detection was provided by the applicant.  
RESULTS 
Based  on  the  dose-finding  study  in  asymptomatic  HAE  patients,  doses  of  rhC1INH  of  50  U/kg  and 
100 U/kg  were  both  found  to  restore  C1INH  activity  to  normal  levels  (0.7  U/mL  to  1.3  U/mL),  while 
doses of 25 U/kg and lower did not (Figure 1).

2.4.3.1. 
 Absorption  
rhC1INH is intended for intravenous administration. 
2.4.3.2. 
 Distribution 
After  intravenous  administration,  the  volume  of  distribution  for  rhC1INH  was  around  3  L,  indicating 
distribution mainly to the plasma compartment.  
2.4.3.3. 
 Elimination 
The pharmacokinetic data derived from the phase 1 trials demonstrated that the half-life of rhC1INH is 
shorter  than  pdC1INH  which  is  due  to  the  different  glycosylation  of  rhC1INH  (leading  to  more  rapid 
hepatic clearance compared with pdC1INH). Therefore more rhC1INH needs to be given compared with 
pdC1INH on a U/kg basis to achieve a comparable PD effect.  
The  results  of  the  dose-finding  study  indicated  that  elimination  of  rhC1INH  is  saturable.  This  is  in 
agreement  with  the  suggestion  that  rhC1INH  is  cleared  via  mannose/asialoglycoprotein  receptors  on 
hepatic  cells  and  macrophages  with  carbohydrate  recognition.  These  receptors  become  saturated  at 
sufficiently high plasma levels.  
With a molecular weight of 67 kDa, rhC1INH is not expected to be excreted, but to be fully eliminated 
by degradation.  
2.4.3.4. 
 Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
There  was  no  difference  in  the  PK  profiles  of  rhC1INH  after  the  1st,  3rd,  and  5th  administration  of 
100 U/kg  rhC1INH  at  3-week  intervals  in  healthy  volunteers.  No  neutralising  antibodies  against 
rhC1INH  have  been  detected,  which  is  in  line  with  the  finding  of  similar  pharmacokinetics  after  late, 
repeated doses.  
The  applicant  has  performed  a  Population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (with  NONMEM)  including  data 
from healthy volunteers (N=14) and patients with (N=94) and without (N=12) clinical symptoms. The 
subjects  weighed  between  45  and  119  kg  and  were  between  16  and  66  years  of  age.  A  one-
compartment model with nonlinear elimination was used to describe the time course of C1INH.  
No formal covariate analysis was performed, but volume of distribution was set as a function of weight 
with an estimated allometric coefficient of <1 (0.56). Hence, with dosing directly by body weight 1:1 
the  model  predicts  increased  Cmax  in  subjects  with  larger  body  weight.  For  rhC1INH,  the  initial 
concentrations/Cmax  might  be  determinant  of  effect.  Cmax  is  dependent  on  dose  and  volume  of 
distribution. The volume of distribution for rhC1INH more or less equals the plasma volume, which is 
related to body size. In normal weight subjects, plasma volume is usually directly related to body size, 
i.e.  the  coefficient  used  for  allometric  scaling  is  1.  In  the  response  to  the  day  120  LoQ  the  applicant 
discussed whether the proposed dosing by body weight is appropriate over the entire Body Weight or 
Body Mass Index range. A fixed dose of 4200U for subject ≥84kg was proposed by the applicant based 
on clinical efficacy and PK data in subjects in this weight range, simulations based on PK modelling as 
well  as  by  calculation  based  on  the  literature  about  the  relationship  between  plasma  volume,  body 
weight and height. The applicant’s data in support of a fixed dose in adults ≥ 84kg was accepted. 
The  simulation  suggested  that  the  administration  of  a  single  dose  of  50  U  per  kg  body  weight  of 
rhC1INH would result in almost all HAE patients achieving C1INH activity levels of at least 0.7 U/mL, 
while  a  fixed  dose  of  2100  U  would  fail  to  achieve  C1INH  activity  levels  of  at  least  0.7  U/mL,  in  one 
quarter  of  the  patients  which  is  in  line  with  efficacy  data.  The  simulation  further  indicated  that 
administration of a second dose of 50 U/kg would not result in peak C1INH activity levels any higher 
than  those  following  a  single  administration  of  100 U/kg.  For  assessment  of  whether  the  model  was 
adequate for its intended use, a comparison of observed and simulated Cmax values stratified by dose 
levels would have been valuable. However, although not formally discussed by the applicant, if volume 
of  distribution  can  be  assumed  to  be  dose  independent  it  can  be  theoretically  deduced  that  two 
repeated  doses  of  50  U/kg  would  not  result  in  higher  maximum  concentration  than  a  100  U/kg  unit 
dose. Therefore, further discussion on the potential problems identified in the modelling and simulation 
exercise are not considered needed for the specific purpose of estimating Cmax at repeated doses.

 Special populations 
There are no studies in special populations.

No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  which  is  acceptable  for  a  therapeutic 
protein.

2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
2.4.4.1. 
 Mechanism of action 
C1INH inhibits targets in the complement cascade (C1r, C1s and MASPs) and clotting pathway (factor 
XI, factor XII and kallikrein). C1INH deficiency results in an inappropriate activation of these systems, 
in  the  release  of  vasoactive  peptides  (C2-kinin  and  bradykinin)  and  also  in  increased  vascular 
permeability  which  causes  uncontrolled,  local  oedema.  Insufficient  control  of  C1INH  on  the  (auto) 
activation of the complement component 1 (C1) results in activation and consumption of complement 
component 4 (C4) through cleavage of native C4 by activated C1.  
2.4.4.2. 
 Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Due to C1 inhibitor deficiency, HAE patients typically have low levels of complement component 4 (C4) 
because it is cleaved by activated C1. In Study 1101, which was the first study in man in the rhC1INH 
clinical  development  program  (see  Table  10  for  description),  rhC1INH  was  shown  to  be 
pharmacodynamically  active  in  HAE  patients  through  a  dose-dependent  decrease  in  the  formation  of 
C4b/c,  the  activation  cleavage  product  of  plasma  complement  component  4  (C4).  Doses  of  100  U/kg 
and 50 U/kg increased mean normalized levels of C4 relative to baseline, and cleavage of C4 resumed 
once functional C1INH levels fell below 0.7 U/mL. Doses of rhC1INH of 25 U/kg or lower only resulted 
in a temporary, minimal elevation of C4 levels relative to baseline.

The SD in the highest dosage group (100 U/kg) is indicated by a bar. 
In  Studies  1202  and  1203  (see  Table  10  for  description),  the  biological  activity  of  rhC1INH  was 
confirmed in HAE patients who were treated for an acute angioedema attack. Treatment with rhC1INH 
at a dose of 100 U/kg body weight, was followed by a rapid and substantial increase in plasma C1INH 
activity  and  a  sustained  elevation  of  C4  antigen.  The  mean  normalized  C4  antigen  increased  about 
two-fold between 4 and 12 h post-treatment. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The  active  substance  rhC1INH  is  purified  from  the  milk  of  rabbits  expressing  the  gene  encoding  for 
human C1 inhibitor (C1INH). The amino acid sequence of the recombinant form is identical to that of 
human  C1INH.  The  purification  process  has  been  designed  to  eliminate  to  the  maximum  extent 
possible host related protein impurities (HRIs) originating from the rabbit milk. HRI levels in batches of 
the drug substance and the drug product range from 5-15 ppm. 
Recombinant protein products such as rhC1INH administered to human subjects may elicit antibodies 
against the recombinant protein, its endogenous counterpart, and host-related impurities (HRI) in the 
drug product.  
Thrombogenicity 
Asymptomatic  HAE  patients  have  mild  activation  of  coagulation  and  fibrinolysis  as  reflected  by 
increased  circulating  levels  of  parameters  such  as  F1+2  fragment,  thrombin-antithrombin  III  (TAT) 
complexes  and  plasmin-α2-antiplasmin  (PAP)  complexes.  These  activation  processes  further  enhance 
during  acute  angioedema  attacks.  There  are  data  indicating  that  infusion  of  pdC1INH  can  diminish 
platelet aggregation and decrease factor XIIa and F1+2 fragment levels in patients with HAE. 
A possible risk for thromboembolic complications has been described in published reports with off-label 
administration  of  high  dose  pdC1INH  (500-1050  U/kg,  which  is  25  to  50  times  higher  than  the 
recommended  dose  for  an  angioedema  attack)  in  neonates  at  risk  for  capillary  leak  syndrome  who 
underwent cardiosurgery with extracorporeal circulation for major cardiovascular malformations. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No  studies  were  performed.  RhC1INH  is  the  recombinant  analogue  of  endogenous  C1INH.  Literature 
data indicate an interaction of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) and C1INH product. Interactions 
with other drugs are not anticipated due to the nature and metabolism of the product. 
Genetic differences in pharmacodynamic response 
No studies were performed. Due to the existence of circulating C1INH levels the risk for immunogenic 
response  to  exogenous  C1INH  is  expected  to  be  low.  Other  aspects  of  genetic  differences  were  not 
discussed in the application and the number on non-Caucasians included in the studies was very low. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  C1INH is rather  well  known.  Previous  experience  with  pdC1INH indicates 
that the administration of C1INH alleviates the symptoms of acute attacks in HAE patients. 
Evaluation of pharmacodynamics was performed in asymptomatic HAE patients since healthy volunteer 
subjects,  due  to  the  absence  of  any  genetic  defect  with  respect  to  C1INH,  have  normal  baseline 
functional C1 inhibitor activity and normal C4 levels. Since C4 levels are affected by the C1INH activity, 
C4  was  chosen  as  a  biomarker  for  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  rhC1INH  which  is  acceptable.  A  dose-
related response in C4 levels could be demonstrated for rhC1INH.  
Based on the now available efficacy data from the placebo-controlled study 1205 with the lower dose 
50 U/kg, the applicant proposes the following dose regimen: For subjects less than 84 kg the dose is 
50 U/kg, and for subjects ≥84 kg the dose is 4200U with the possibility to give a second dose within 
the same attack if the response is not sufficient. 
It  is  well  known  that  recombinant  protein  products  such  as  rhC1INH  administered  to  human  subjects 
may  elicit  antibodies  against  the  recombinant  protein,  its  endogenous  counterpart,  and  host-related 
impurities (HRI) in the drug product. The issues of immunogenicity have been further investigated by 
the applicant and a range of validated assays was developed to assess immunogenicity

2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  overall  clinical  pharmacology  data  was  satisfactory,  with  sufficient  data  provided  to  demonstrate 
the  PK  and  PD  activities  of  rhC1INH.  Of  particular  importance  is  that  the  applicant  during  the 
assessment  identified  and  reviewed  the  relevant  factors  to  support  the  proposal  for  a  fixed  dose  of 
4200U  (2  vials)  in  patients  with  body  weight  84  kg  or  greater.  This  was  supported  by  the  PK  model, 
efficacy in subject ≥84kg as well as by calculation based on the literature about relationship between 
plasma  volume,  bodyweight  and  height.  The  proposed  weight  cut-off  of  84kg  for  the  fixed  dose  of 
4200U is accepted. 
2.4.7.  Clinical efficacy  
The studies included in the clinical development programme are shown in Table 10. 
The main efficacy studies were two randomised controlled clinical studies (study C1 1205-01 and study 
C1 1304-01) and their open label extension studies. 
2.4.7.1.  Dose response study 
Study 1101 
This  was  an  open-label  study  in  twelve  asymptomatic  HAE  (type  I  and  II)  patients  of  both  genders. 
Patients had a plasma level of functional C1INH of less than 40 % of normal. The patients were divided 
in four groups and each patient was infused i.v. with rhC1INH on two occasions with an interval of at 
least  five  weeks.  The  doses  tested  were  in  the  range  of  6.25  U/kg  up  to  100  U/kg.  Kinetics  of 
functional C1INH was determined as well as changes in C4 antigen concentration as a biomarker for PD 
(results shown in Figure 3). 
Based on the PK/PD results of study 1101, the doses of rhC1INH of 50 and 100 U/kg were selected for 
clinical evaluation with the following considerations.  
• 
The normal physiological state in healthy patients supports the pharmacodynamic assumption 
that acute angioedema attacks cannot occur if endogenous C1INH activity is maintained above 
the  lower  limit  of  the  normal  range  (0.7-1.3  U/mL  plasma).  It  is  therefore  extrapolated  that 
treatment  of  an  angioedema  attacks  requires  restoration  of  functional  C1INH  levels  into  the 
normal range. 
•  Experience  with  pdC1INH  products  indicates  onset  of  relief  of  symptoms  of  an  angioedema 
attack may not occur until 4 hours after administration.  
Hence,  a  dose  of  rhC1INH  that  leads  to  restoration  of  circulating  functional  C1INH  levels  above  the 
lower limit of normal for 4 hours was selected for initial evaluation in symptomatic HAE patients. The 
results of the Phase 1 Study 1101 suggested that dosing at 100 U/kg, and to a lesser extent 50 U/kg, 
was  able  to  correct  C1INH  activity  in  blood  for  a  sufficiently  long  period  and  to  restore  the  disturbed 
biochemical  homeostasis  due  to  the  C1INH  deficiency  state,  and  to  halt  progression  of  a  swelling 
episode and to allow the resolution of oedema. 
The selection of doses is considered adequate and supported by the available pharmacodynamic data. 
2.4.7.2.  Main studies  
The  efficacy  of  rhC1INH  in  symptomatic  HAE  was  evaluated  and  established  in  two  independent 
randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  (RCT)  studies  (C1  1205-01  and  C1  1304-01).  As  a  result 
of their interim analysis the double-blind phase was terminated and only the open-label extension (OLE) 
phases were continued.  
Study  C1  1205-01; was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase II study on the safety 
and  efficacy  of  rhC1INH  at  doses  of  50  and  100U/kg  in  relieving  eligible  attacks  of  angioedema  with 
involvement of sub-mucosal tissues in patients with HAE.  
Study  C1  1304-01;  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  multi-centre  study 
performed  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  rhC1INH  at  100  U/kg  in  patients  with  HAE  with 
attacks of angioedema.

2.4.7.2.1.  Methods for Study 1205-01 
2.4.7.2.1.1.  Study Participants  
Patients were screened when asymptomatic and had to fulfil the following criteria to be included in the 
study (major criteria):  
•  Aged 12 years and above. 
•  Clinical  and  (central)  laboratory  diagnosis  of  HAE  with  Baseline  plasma  level  of  functional 
C1INH  <50%  of  normal,  without  evidence  for  acquired  angioedema  (AAE)  (by  a  low  plasma 
level of C1q and/or presence of anti-C1INH antibodies). 
For  randomization  into  the  study,  which  took  place  when  the  patient  presented  with  an  attack,  the 
patient had to fulfil all of the following criteria: 
1.  Above Screening criteria were still met. 
2.  Evidence  for  exacerbation  or  development  of  an  abdominal  attack  and/or  of  facial-
oropharyngeal  angioedema  and/or  laryngeal  angioedema  and/or  of  urogenital  angioedema 
and/or peripheral angioedema.  
3.  Onset of eligible symptoms within 5 hours before medical evaluation of eligibility had occurred. 
4.  Patient VAS scores of overall severity of angioedema symptoms at least at 1 eligible location at 
the time of evaluation (Time -1 hour) of at least 50 mm, where 0 mm meant ‘no symptoms at 
all’ and 100 mm meant ‘extremely disabling’. 
Major  exclusion  criteria  concerned  history  of  allergic  reactions  to  C1INH  concentrates  or  any  rabbit 
protein, diagnosis of acquired C1INH deficiency, and presentation or development of a life-threatening 
attack  (an  attack  requiring  immediate  emergency  procedures  to  prevent  death,  hypoxemia  related 
injuries or other unfavourable outcomes). 
2.4.7.2.1.2.  Treatments 
Study  drug  was  scheduled  to  be  administered  within  6  hours  after  the  onset  of  symptoms  of  the 
eligible angioedema attack. The solutions were dispensed in opaque syringes. 
Double-blind treatment was an iv infusion 6 mL per minute of either: 
• 
• 
rhC1INH at 100 U/kg body weight 
rhC1INH at 50 U/kg body weight 
•  0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) in water for injection (Saline solution). 
The  solution  was  infused  through  an  iv  cannula  using  a  calibrated  infusion  pump.  For  patients  who 
received  Saline,  the  volume  of  NaCl  0.9%  solution  was  adjusted  according  to  each  patient’s  body 
weight. 
Patients were followed until day 90 after treatment of an acute attack unless they experienced a new 
attack and were enrolled in the open-label study. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
The  use  of  any  concomitant  medication  was  documented  in  the  CRF.  After  recruitment,  patients 
continued  with  any  medication  prescribed  for  HAE  that  they  were  using  at  study  start.  In  addition, 
acetaminophen  could  be  used  to  treat  pain.  Prohibited  medication  included  narcotics  or  other 
treatment anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or warfarin) in the 14 days preceding treatment with rhC1INH 
as  well  as  pdC1INH  concentrates  or  any  blood  or  plasma-derived  therapeutics  (e.g.,  fresh  or  frozen 
plasma) within 7 days before treatment with rhC1INH. 
2.4.7.2.1.3.  Objectives 
The study was designed to show superiority for rhC1INH when comparing with placebo. Objectives of 
the double-blind, saline-controlled, randomized phase were: 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of rhC1INH in symptomatic patients with HAE, 
To demonstrate the efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of acute attacks in patients with HAE, 
To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rhC1INH in symptomatic 
patients. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 25/57
 
 
 
2.4.7.2.1.4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
A  patient  reported  visual  analogue  scale  (VAS)  was  chosen  to  assess  efficacy.  VAS  scores  were 
recorded  repeatedly  throughout  the  study  at  defined  timepoints  and  were  measured  at  up  to  4 
different locations (abdominal, genitourinary, orofacial-pharyngeal-laryngeal or peripheral), depending 
on  the  affected  locations.  A  series  of  VAS  assessments  were  taken  that  varied  for  each  location.  To 
allow consistent evaluation of attacks at different anatomical locations, an overall severity VAS for each 
location was used. The last VAS question for each location indicated the overall severity of angioedema 
symptoms as felt by the patient for that location. All VAS scores were measured as a continuous scale 
from  0  to  100  mm.  For  most  of  the  VAS  questions,  including  the  overall  severity  VAS,  0  mm 
corresponded to ‘No symptoms at all’ and 100 mm corresponded to ‘Extremely disabling’. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Time to Beginning of Relief of Symptoms (VAS Score Decrease of ≥20 mm 
with Persistence) 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  time  to  beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms  assessed  using  the  overall 
severity VAS score. For the primary endpoint, the time of beginning of relief of symptoms was the first 
timepoint  at  which  the  overall  severity  VAS  score  decreased  by  at  least  20  mm  with  respect  to 
Baseline, at any eligible location, with persistence of the decrease at the next assessment time so that 
for  the  next  value  at  the  location  a  decrease  of  at  least  20  mm  with  respect  to  Baseline  was  also 
observed.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  time  to  minimal  symptoms  for  an  attack  assessed  using  the 
overall severity VAS score. Time to minimal symptoms for an attack (assessed using VAS score) was 
defined as the time at which all overall severity VAS scores fell below 20 mm for all locations for which 
the VAS scores were collected at Baseline. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
A number of exploratory endpoints were included in the analysis, e.g. therapeutic failure.  
2.4.7.2.1.5.  Sample size 
The sample size was estimated based on the results with time to relief from placebo-controlled studies 
of human pdC1INH. It was assumed that the mean times to the beginning of relief and their standard 
deviation  would  be  the  same  for  both  active  treatment  groups  as  those  observed  by  Kunschak  et  al 
(mean = 15.35 H SD = 10.83 h for the saline arm and mean = 2.7 hours and SD = 4.09 hours for the 
C1INH treatment arm). With 39 patients (13 in each treatment group), the study would have a power 
of  78%  to  detect  a  difference  between  the  saline group  and  an  active  treatment  group,  using  a  two-
sided 1% level of significance. 
2.4.7.2.1.6.  Randomisation 
The  central  randomization  was  carried  out  when  the  patient  presented  with  an  acute  angioedema 
attack.  The  block  size  used  was  3  with  an  allocation  ratio  of  1:1:1.  There  was  no  stratification  factor 
used in the randomization. 
2.4.7.2.1.7.  Blinding (masking) 
The  blinding  procedure  appears  acceptable.  Diagnostic  laboratory  results  were  not  disclosed  to  any 
study  personnel  until  the  study  had  been  unblinded,  and  functional  C1INH  level  results  were  not 
disclosed to the investigators to ensure the blind was maintained. 
2.4.7.2.1.8.  Statistical methods 
Two key analysis sets were defined for efficacy: 
• 
• 
The FAS or mITT Set was defined as the set of patients who provided informed consent, were 
randomized to one of the treatment groups and who took at least one dose of the study drug. 
The PP analysis set was defined as the subset of patients in the FAS without any major protocol 
deviation. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 26/57
 
 
 
The FAS (mITT) was the primary analysis set of interest in all efficacy analyses, with the exception of 
the  confirmatory  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoint,  which  was  performed  on  the  PP 
analysis set.  
The overall alpha level for the testing at the interim and final analysis was set as equal to 0.05 (two-
sided).  This  value  was  split  up  into  0.01  in  the  interim  analysis  and  0.045  for  the  final  analysis.  The 
results  of  the  interim  analysis  indicated  that  no  further  patients  were  needed  to  show  significance  of 
the primary endpoint, and recruitment into the double-blind phase of the study was discontinued. No 
further  patients  were  randomized  subsequent  to  the  interim  analysis.  The  efficacy  endpoints  were 
assessed using a two-sided, 1% significance level. 
For each analysis a hierarchical test procedure was applied. At first, the rhC1INH treatment arm with 
the higher dose (100 U/kg) was compared with the saline solution arm, and only if it was shown to be 
statistically significantly superior was the rhC1INH treatment arm with the lower dose (50 U/kg) then 
compared with the saline solution arm. This hierarchical closed test principle was applied separately for 
all endpoints, without any adjustment for multiplicity. 
The study was only to be deemed a success if the p-value for the primary endpoint was significant at 
the  two-sided  significance  level  of  1%,  the  p-value  for  the  secondary  endpoint  was  significant  at  the 
two-sided significance level of 10% and the examination of therapeutic failures supported the efficacy 
of rhC1INH.

There  were  39  patients  randomized  to  treatment.  One  patient  was  randomized,  but  not  treated  (one 
patient  in  the  rhC1INH  50  U/kg  treatment  group  presented  for  treatment  but  was  mistakenly 
randomized as eligibility criteria for attack severity were not met). The FAS (mITT) and safety analysis 
set,  therefore,  comprised  of  13,  12  and  13  patients  in  the  rhC1INH  100  U/kg,  rhC1INH  50  U/kg  and 
Saline solution treatment groups, respectively. 
The PP analysis set comprised of 11, 8 and 11 patients in the rhC1INH 100 U/kg, rhC1INH 50 U/kg and 
Saline solution treatment groups, respectively.

Treatment with 100 U/kg body weight rhC1INH was not statistically significant in reducing the time to 
minimal symptoms compared to Saline Solution at the 1% level (p=0.040) Table 14. 
Although p=0.04 for the 100 U/kg body weight dose statistical test, the FAS (mITT) log rank test for 
the comparison of 50 U/kg body weight versus Saline Solution for the time to minimal symptoms was 
explored and found to have a p<0.001.

Exploratory endpoints 
Therapeutic failure 
No  patients experienced  therapeutic  failure in  either  of  the  rhC1INH  treatment  groups  and  5  patients 
experienced therapeutic failure in the Saline Solution treatment group. Although the difference was not 
statistically  significant  at  the  1%  level  (for  the  comparison  of  rhC1INH  [100 U/kg  body  weight]  and 
Saline Solution), the number of therapeutic failures support the efficacy of rhC1INH (Table 15).

The median time to beginning of relief based on IS was shorter for both the rhC1INH groups compared 
to the Saline solution group, however, this was not statistically significant at the 1% significance level 
(for the comparison of rhC1INH [100 U/kg] and Saline solution). 
All patients in both the rhC1INH groups achieved beginning of relief of symptoms by 4 hours according 
to VAS scores and none had relapse of symptoms. Eight of 13 patients in the Saline solution group had 
a response at 4 hours and none had a relapse of symptoms. 
The 13 patients in the rhC1INH (100 U/kg) group achieved beginning of relief of symptoms by 4 hours 
according  to  IS  assessment,  and  1  patient  had  an  early  relapse  at  a  peripheral  location  at  the 
scheduled  timepoint  2  hours  after  treatment.  Eleven  of  12  patients  in  the  rhC1INH  (50  U/kg)  group 
had a response by 4 hours according to IS assessment, and none had a relapse of symptoms. In the 
saline solution group, 10 of the 13 patients had a response by 4 hours. Of the patients who responded, 
3 patients had an early relapse and 1 patient had a late relapse at a peripheral location at the 8 hours 
scheduled timepoint. 
2.4.7.2.2.6.  Ancillary analyses 
A subgroup analysis was performed for the following subgroups for the FAS (mITT) Population: eligible

that no firm conclusions can be drawn.

2.4.7.2.3.  Methods for Study 1304-01 
2.4.7.2.3.1.  Study Participants  
Patients were screened when asymptomatic and had to fulfill the following criteria to be included in the 
study: 
•  Aged at least 16 years. 
•  Clinical  and  central  laboratory  diagnosis  of  HAE  with  HAE  with  baseline  plasma  level  of 
functional C1INH <50% of normal. 
For randomization into the study, the patient had to fulfil all of the following criteria in addition to the 
screening criteria: 
1.  Evidence  for  exacerbation  or  development  of  an  abdominal  attack  and/or  of  facial-
oropharyngeal  angioedema  and/or  laryngeal  angioedema  and/or  of  urogenital  angioedema 
and/or  peripheral  angioedema.  Patients  had  to  notify  and  discuss  symptoms  with  the 
Investigator prior to travelling to the study centre. 
2.  Onset of eligible symptoms within 5 hours before medical evaluation of eligibility had occurred. 
3.  Patient  VAS  score  of  overall  severity  of  angioedema  symptoms  of  ≥  50  mm  at  least  1 
anatomical location at the time of evaluation (Time -1 hours). 
4.  No clear improvement (improvement defined as a decrease in VAS score of overall severity of 
angioedema  symptoms  ≥20  mm)  in  angioedema  signs  between  determination  of  eligibility, 
(Time -1 hour) and baseline (Time 0 hours). 
Major  exclusion  criteria  concerned  history  of  allergic  reactions  to  C1INH  concentrates  or  any  rabbit 
protein, diagnosis of acquired C1INH deficiency, and presentation or development of a life-threatening 
attack  (an  attack  requiring  immediate  emergency  procedures  to  prevent  death,  hypoxemia  related 
injuries or other unfavourable outcomes). 
2.4.7.2.3.2.  Treatments 
Study  drug  was  scheduled  to  be  administered  within  6  hours  after  the  onset  of  symptoms  of  the 
eligible  angioedema  attack.  Only  one-dose  level  was  studied  in  this  study.  The  solutions  were 
dispensed in opaque syringes. 
Double-blind treatment was an intravenous. infusion at a rate of 6 mL per minute of either: 
• 
rhC1INH at 100 U/kg of body weight 
•  0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) in water for injection (placebo). 
The solution was infused through an intravenous cannula using a calibrated infusion pump. For patients 
who  received  Saline,  the  volume  of  NaCl  0.9%  solution  was  adjusted  according  to  the  patient’s  body 
weight. 
Patients were followed until day 90 after treatment of an attack unless they experienced a new attack 
and were enrolled in the open-label study. 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
The  use  of  any  concomitant  medication  was  documented  in  the  CRF.  After  recruitment,  patients 
continued  with  any  medication  prescribed  for  HAE  that  they  were  using  at  study  start.  In  addition, 
acetaminophen  could  be  used  to  treat  pain.  Prohibited  medication  included  narcotics  or  other 
treatment anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or warfarin) in the 14 days preceding treatment with rhC1INH 
as  well  as  pdC1INH  concentrates  or  any  blood  or  plasma-derived  therapeutics  (e.g.,  fresh  or  frozen 
plasma) within 7 days before treatment with rhC1INH. 
2.4.7.2.3.3.  Objectives 
The  study  was  designed  to  show  superiority  when  comparing  rhC1INH  to  placebo.  Objectives  of  the 
double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized phase of clinical Study 1304 RCT were: 
• 
• 
To  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  rhC1INH  in  the  treatment  of  acute  angioedema  attacks  in 
patients with HAE, 
To assess the safety and tolerability of rhC1INH in symptomatic patients with HAE. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 32/57
 
 
 
2.4.7.2.3.4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
A patient reported visual analogue scale (VAS) was chosen to assess efficacy (see methods for study 
1205-01). 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Time to Beginning of Relief of Symptoms (VAS Score Decrease of ≥20 mm) 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  time  to  beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms  assessed  using  the  overall 
severity VAS score. For the primary endpoint, the time of beginning of relief of symptoms was the first 
timepoint  at  which  the  overall  severity  VAS  score  decreased  by  at  least  20  mm  with  respect  to 
Baseline. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  time  to  minimal  symptoms  for  an  attack  assessed  using  the 
overall severity VAS score. Time to minimal symptoms for an attack (assessed using VAS score) was 
defined as the time at which all overall severity VAS scores fell below 20 mm for all locations for which 
the VAS scores were collected at Baseline. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
A number of exploratory endpoints were included in the analysis, e.g. therapeutic failure. 
2.4.7.2.3.5.  Sample size 
The  original  assumption  for  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  data  from  Kunschak  et  al 
(Transfusion, 1998). This study was powered to show the same difference between the saline control 
and active treatment groups as was observed in the Kunschak study. 
The primary efficacy variable is the time to the beginning of relief. For the study to have 90% power to 
show  a  difference  of  12.65  hours  between  the  two  treatment  groups  at  the  5%  level  of  significance, 
with  an  estimation  of  the  standard  deviation  of  7.66  hours,  data  must  be  available  for  11  evaluable 
patients in each treatment group. 
The secondary efficacy variable is the time to minimal symptoms. For the study to have 90% power to 
show a difference of 17.35 hours between the 2 treatment groups at the 5% level of significance, with 
an  estimation  of  the  standard  deviation  of  16.69  hours,  data  must  be  available  for  25  evaluable 
patients in each treatment group. 
In  order  for  the  study  also  to  have  sufficient  power  to  show  statistical  significance  for  the  secondary 
efficacy variable and to collect safety information on a more substantial population, it was decided to 
collect data on 50 evaluable patients. 
2.4.7.2.3.6.  Randomisation 
The  central  randomization  was  carried  out  when  the  patient  presented  with  an  acute  angioedema 
attack.  Treatment  allocation  was  stratified  by  attack  type  (‘submucosal’  and  ‘peripheral’)  at  the 
discretion of the Investigator. The block size was 2 with an allocation ratio of 1:1.  
2.4.7.2.3.7.  Blinding (masking) 
The  blinding  procedure  appears  acceptable.  Diagnostic  laboratory  results  were  not  disclosed  to  any 
study  personnel  until  the  study  had  been  unblinded,  and  functional  C1INH  level  results  were  not 
disclosed to the investigators to ensure the blind was maintained.. 
2.4.7.2.3.8.  Statistical methods 
Two key analysis sets were defined for efficacy: 
• 
• 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS or Modified Intention-To-Treat [mITT] Set) was defined as the set of 
patients who provided informed consent, were randomized to one of the treatment groups and 
who took at least one dose of the study drug. 
The Per Protocol (PP) analysis set was defined as the subset of patients in the FAS without any 
major protocol deviation. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 33/57
 
 
 
The FAS (mITT) was the primary analysis set of interest in all efficacy analyses, with the exception of 
the  confirmatory  analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoint,  which  was  performed  on  the  PP 
analysis set.  
For all statistical tests, a significance level of 0.029 was considered. This level was chosen, based upon 
Pocock’s  group  sequential  procedure,  in  order  to  correct  for  multiple  testing  because  of  a  previous 
interim analysis. 
The study was only to be deemed a success if the p-value for the primary endpoint was significant at 
the two-sided significance level of 2.94%, the p-value for the secondary endpoint was significant at the 
two-sided significance level of 10% and the examination of therapeutic failures supported the efficacy 
of rhC1INH.

Two  patients  were  randomized  but  not  treated  and,  therefore,  were  not  included  in  the  FAS  (mITT). 
One  patient  was  not  treated  because  she  was  in  spontaneous  regression  of  the  attack.  The  other 
patient  developed  a  potentially  life-threatening  attack  location  in  the  laryngo-pharynx  with  voice 
changes  and  a  swelling  in  the  uvula.  The  protocol  had  provision  to  withdraw  such  patients  from  the 
study. 
The only discontinuation due to lack of effect occurred in the placebo group. One patient lost to follow-
up. Two patients were randomised but not treated.  
2.4.7.2.4.1.  Recruitment 
First patient was enrolled 27th June 2005 and last patient completed 13th Nov 2007.  
2.4.7.2.4.2.  Conduct of the study 
The  study  was  conducted  at  eleven  active  centers  specialized  in  the  treatment  of  hereditary 
angioedema in Italy (7), Spain (1), UK (1), Israel (1), Romania (1). 
Six amendments were made to the protocol.

2.4.7.2.4.4.  Numbers analysed 
There were 34 patients randomized to treatment. The FAS (mITT) and Safety Analysis set comprised of 
16 patients in each treatment group. Two patients were randomized but not treated, one patient due 
to  spontaneous  regression  of  the  attack  and  the  other  due  to  a  potentially  life-threatening  attack 
location in the laryngo-pharynx with voice changes and a swelling in the uvula. 
The  PP  analysis  set  comprised  of  11  and  15  patients  in  the  rhC1INH  and  Saline  treatment  groups, 
respectively.  
2.4.7.2.4.5.  Outcomes and estimation 
A patient reported visual analogue scale (VAS) was chosen to assess efficacy (see methods for study 
1304-01). 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - Time to Beginning of Relief of Symptoms (VAS Score Decrease of ≥20 mm) 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  time  to  beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms  assessed  using  the  overall 
severity VAS score. For the primary endpoint, the time of beginning of relief of symptoms was the first 
timepoint  at  which  the  overall  severity  VAS  score  decreased  by  at  least  20  mm  with  respect  to 
Baseline. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  secondary  efficacy  variable  was  time  to  minimal  symptoms  for  an  attack  assessed  using  the 
overall severity VAS score. Time to minimal symptoms for an attack (assessed using VAS score) was 
defined as the time at which all overall severity VAS scores fell below 20 mm for all locations for which 
the VAS scores were collected at Baseline. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
A number of exploratory endpoints were included in the analysis, e.g. therapeutic failure. 
2.4.7.2.4.6.  Ancillary analyses 
The  numbers  for  the  subgroup  analyses  were  so  low  that  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  the 
primary endpoint.

2.4.7.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The following analysis across trials also include data from the open label extension (OLE) phases of the 
main randomised-controlled trials (RCT), i.e. studies 1205-01 and 1304-01. Further information about 
these OLE phases is provided in section 3.4.7.5.

During the assessment the applicant provided data on the 57 HAE patients that received a total of 194 
open-label  treatments  in  Study  1304  OLE  and  on  57  HAE  patients  that  received  a  total  of  144  OLE 
rhC1INH  treatments  in  study  1205  OLE.  No  pattern  suggestive  of  waning  efficacy  over  repeated 
administrations was seen.  
Additional dose 
The use of an additional dose and the rate of therapeutic failures with different dosing regimens is 
summarised in Table 18.

The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  treatment  failure  was  similar  between  the  two  higher  doses 
and somewhat higher in the group that received the lowest dose. The patients treated with the lowest 
dose  also  more  often  needed  a  second  dose.  These findings  further  support  the  posology  of  50  U/kg 
with an option of a second dose since similar success rates are achieved using this strategy as in the 
group  receiving  100  U/kg  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  patients  only  received  a  single  50 
U/kg dose.  
Although median time to beginning of relief appears to be similar for all three doses in the open-label 
setting, the rate of patients who needed additional doses or were considered to be therapeutic failures 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010

was  highest  in  the  treatment  groups  receiving  the lowest  dose.  The  simplified  dosing  regimen  of  one 
vial (2100 U) thus appears to be less efficient than the 50 U/kg dose.  
In  the  open-label  studies  the  initial  treatment  dose  was  to  be  administered  within  1  hour  after 
eligibility of the angioedema attack was confirmed. At the discretion of the investigator and depending 
upon  the  patient’s  clinical  response,  an  additional  iv  dose  could  be  administered  within  4  hours  from 
the  initial  dose.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  whether  this  strategy  should  be  reflected  in  the 
posology  section  of  the  SPC  and  whether  there  are  any  characteristics  in  the  patient’s  response  that 
could identify those who either need a second dose or are non-responders. The response demonstrated 
that  there  is  no  need  to  recommend  a  1hr  interval  between  presentation  and  treatment  of  an  acute 
attack and that this time interval was to allow time for the various study procedures. The majority of 
cases improved within 4hrs and only 10% required and additional 50U/kg dose. Section 5.1 of the SPC 
includes relevant information on the observed time to beginning of relief and information on how many 
patients were treated with an additional dose.  
Multiple treatments 
The  maintenance  of  patients’  response  to  rhC1INH  for  repeat  treated  attacks  was  assessed  using  a 
subset  of  patients  from  the  FAS  (mITT)  Analysis  Set.  The  patients  included  in  the  analysis  were 
patients  administered  rhC1INH  in  the  open  label  phase  of  Studies  1205  or  1304,  and  who  were  not 
treated in the RCT phase of either study.  
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms (minutes), and p-values from the paired t-test and 
Prentice-Wilcoxon test, are presented for the FAS (mITT) Analysis Set in Table 19.

The  median  time  to  beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms,  and  confidence  intervals,  were  very  similar  for 
first  and  last  attacks.  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  difference  in  the  time  to  beginning  of  relief  of 
symptoms at the 5% level with p-values of 0.295 (Prentice-Wilcoxon test). 
There  were  3  patients  who  had  a  significantly  increased  time  to  beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms  for 
their  last  attack  compared  to  their  first  attack.  All  3  patients  were  administered  a  dose  of  2100  U  in 
1304 OLE.  
Similar finding were obtained when the same analysis was performed for the data on time to minimal 
symptoms. 
Potentially Life-threatening Laryngeal attacks 
Within the randomized studies 1304 and 1205 and from their respective open-label extension phases, 
196  sub-mucosal  and  peripheral  acute  angioedema  attacks  (105  patients)  have  been  treated  with 
rhC1INH.  
Attacks,  where  a  patient  had  completed  the  VAS  scores  for  oro-facial-pharyngeal-laryngeal  location 
symptoms  at  baseline,  were  selected  for  further  analysis.  Out  of  62  attacks  fulfilling  the  primary 
selection  criteria,  53  had  an  overall  severity  VAS  at  the  oro-facial-pharyngeal-laryngeal  location  ≥50 
mm and were further analysed. Among these 53 attacks, 33 attacks met the criteria for PLA attacks. 
Table 20. Time to beginning of relief and time to minimal symptoms based on the VAS for 
PLA attacks

The  pooled  analysis  of  all  laryngeal  attacks  show  a  somewhat  longer  time  to  relief  than  what  was 
observed in the overall analysis of all attacks (95 minutes vs. 60 minutes). Three of the attacks did not 
achieve  time  to  beginning  of  relief  within  four  hours.  However,  none  of  the  patients  needed  rescue 
medication or other therapeutic interventions and none experienced a relapse of symptoms.  
Although  the  use  of  rhC1INH  appears  efficient  in  the  treatment  of  severe  laryngeal  HAE  attacks  the 
applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  the  potential  reasons  for  this  difference  in  time  to  beginning  of  relief 
and whether this should be reflected in the SPC. Another concern was whether these attacks should be 
treated with 100U/kg at the onset.  
The frequency of the use of an additional dose for PLA attacks compared with all other attacks treated 
in the open-label extension studies is shown in Table 21. 
Table 21. Additional dose use in the OLE phases of studies 1205 and 1304 
Eighty-three  percent  of  PLA  attacks  in  Study  C1  1304-01  OLE  were  treated  with  an  additional  dose; 
whereas, only 20% of the 50 U/kg body weight dose PLA attack treatments in Study C1 1205-01 OLE 
were treated with an additional dose. The proportion of additional doses in PLA attacks was higher than 
for attacks at non-PLA anatomical locations in the 1205 OLE and 1304 OLE studies. Although 50U/kg is 
effective,  the  higher  incidence  of  repeat  dosing  in  PLA  attacks  raised  the  possibility  that  these  cases 
should receive a 100U/kg dose.  
The  applicant  provided  additional  efficacy  data  through  to  October  2009  during  the  asessment  and 
addressed these questions for cases with PLA attacks. 
The  data  provided  support  the  proposed  dose  of  50U/kg  demonstrating  that  the  median  time  to 
beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms  was  the  similar  for  PLA  as  for  all  attacks.  No  clinically  relevant 
“treatment failure” occurred – such as requirement for intubation.  
2.4.7.4. 
 Clinical studies in special populations 
Nine  adolescent  HAE  patients  (aged  13  to  17  years)  were  treated  with  50 U/kg  for  26  acute 
angioedema attacks, and seven (aged 16 to 17 years) with 2100 U for 24 acute angioedema attacks. 
2.4.7.5. 
 Supportive studies 
Studies 1202 and 1203 
Studies 1202 and 1203, undertaken in symptomatic HAE patients with a single dose of rhC1INH at 100 
U/kg  body  weight,  explored  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  as  well 
as  the  efficacy  of  rhC1INH  in  HAE  patients  who  suffered  from  severe  acute  angioedema  attacks.  In 
these studies patients could be treated multiple times for subsequent new acute angioedema attacks. 
The two open-label, single arm studies were identical for key elements of study design. 
The main differences in design between the studies were as follows: 
•  HAE  patients  presenting  with  acute  laryngeal  angioedema  attacks  could  be  included  in  study 
1203.  
• 
The  sample  size  in  study  1203  was  larger  and  allowed  for  the  evaluation  of  30  severe  acute 
attacks occurring in at least 10 different HAE patients. The sample size for 1202 allowed for the 
evaluation of 15 severe acute attacks occurring in at least 5 different HAE patients.  
For  these  exploratory  studies,  a  severe  attack  was  defined  as  an  acute  attack  of  angioedema  that 
resulted in the inability to work or perform daily activity. 
In total in the two studies, fourteen HAE patients were treated with rhC1INH for 21 acute angioedema 
attacks.  Seven  out  of  14 patients  were  treated  for  one  acute  angioedema  attack  and  7/14  patients 
were  treated  for  2  acute  angioedema  attacks.  Seventeen  of  the  21  treated  attacks  occurred  with

manifestations  of  angioedema  at  a  single  anatomical  location,  4 attacks  occurred  with  manifestations 
at 2 or 3 anatomical locations. 
The median time to the beginning of relief of an attack was <60 minutes for all 3 symptom assessment 
methods (based on treatment benefit VAS [30 minutes], IS [30 minutes] and combination of pain and 
swelling VAS [60 minutes]). 
Response  rate  (beginning  of  relief  <4.0 hours)  at  all  anatomical  locations  was  26/27  (96%),  25/27 
(93%)  and  22/25  (88%)  based  on  the  IS  score,  the  VAS  for  treatment  benefit,  and  the  VAS  for 
pain/swelling,  respectively.  None  of  the  attacks  with  beginning  of  relief  within  4  hours  experienced  a 
relapse based on the IS score and the pain/swelling or treatment benefit VAS. 
The median time to minimal symptoms at all anatomical locations was 4, 4 and 8 hours after the start 
of treatment for the IS score, the pain/swelling VAS, and the treatment benefit VAS, respectively. The 
median time to minimal symptoms tended to be longer for non-abdominal locations (6, 8 and 10 hours 
for  the  IS  score,  the  pain/swelling  VAS,  and  the  treatment  benefit  VAS,  respectively)  than  for 
abdominal  locations  (2,  2  and  1 hours  for  the  IS  score,  the  pain/swelling  VAS,  and  the  treatment 
benefit VAS, respectively). 
The data of these two small open-label studies support the findings from the two RCT studies. 
Study 1205 OLE and study 1304 OLE 
The  1205  OLE  and  1304  OLE  study  phase  allowed  the  open  label  extension  treatment  of  acute 
angioedema attacks in HAE patients screened or treated in the RCT phase of study 1205 RCT or 1304 
RCT  respectively.  The  OLE  phase  also  allowed  new  HAE  patients  to  be  screened  and  enrolled  for 
treatment of acute attacks in the study after the RCT phase closed.  
The study design for the OLE studies was similar to the RCT phase, except that: 
• 
In  the  OLE  phase,  HAE  patients  could  be  treated  multiple  times  for  subsequent  new  acute 
angioedema attacks and there was only a single rhC1INH treatment arm 
In the 1205 OLE the initial rhC1INH treatment was 50 U/kg body weight. 
This  initial  50  U/kg  body  weight  dose  could  be  followed  by  an  additional  50  U/kg  body  weight  at  the 
discretion  of  the  investigator  and  depending  on  the  patient’s  clinical  response  within  4 hours  after 
administration  of  the  initial  treatment.  The  maximum  amount  of  rhC1INH  that  could  be  given  to  a 
patient for an acute attack was 100 U/kg body weight. 
In the 1304 OLE the initial rhC1INH treatment was a fixed dose of a single 2100 U vial. 
This initial fixed dose could be followed by an additional one or two 2100 U vial(s) at the discretion of 
the investigator and depending on the patient’s clinical response within 4 hours after administration of 
the initial treatment. The maximum amount of rhC1INH that could be given to a patient for an acute 
attack was 3 x 2100 U vials (6300 U). 
Between  04 September 2008  and  01 March 2009,  21  HAE  patients  were  treated  in  Study  1205  OLE 
phase for 35 acute angioedema attacks with rhC1INH and 33 HAE patients were treated in study 1304 
OLE phase for 70 acute angioedema attacks with rhC1INH.  
The analyses of the primary (Table 22 and 23) and secondary efficacy endpoints (time to beginning of 
relief  of  symptoms  and  time  to  minimal  symptoms,  respectively)  corroborated  the  RCT  results. 
Response rates were consistent over time.

second rhC1INH treated attack [first in OLE] was summarized together with other patients’ second rhC1INH treated 
attack in the OLE. 
In  study  1205  OLE,  efficacy  was  less  pronounced  in  patients  treated  for  their  fourth  or  fifth  attack, 
however,  numbers  are  small.  In  spite  of  the  lower  dose  used  in  study  1304  OLE,  the  outcome  with 
regards  to  both  the  primary  and  the  secondary  endpoint  was  consistent  with  the  findings  in  the  RCT 
study.  In  this  study  no  tendency  of  an  attenuated  effect  with  repeated  treatments  was  observed  as 
compared to study 1205 OLE. 
The  applicant  addressed  this  during  the  assessment  and  provided  further  efficacy  data  which 
demonstrated that efficacy was similar over repeated attacks and that there was no trend for waning 
efficacy on repeat treatment. 
The  rate  of  therapeutic  failures  and  the  other  exploratory  analyses  were  in  line  with  the  primary  and 
secondary endpoint findings. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  1205  and  1304  are  considered  as  the  pivotal  studies.  Study 
1101 provides information on dose-finding, whereas studies 1202 and 1203, as well as the open-label 
extensions (OLEs) of studies 1205 and 1304 (referred to as 1205 OLE and 1304 OLE) are regarded as 
supportive.  The  supportive  studies  allowed  repeated  treatment  and  studies  1205  OLE  and  1304  OLE, 
further allowed one additional dosing during the same attack. 
The PK/PD data from study 1101 showed that both the 100 U/kg and the 50 U/kg dose were able to 
increase C1INH above the lower normal limit. Both the 100 U/kg and the 50 U/kg dose were chosen for 
the pivotal trials. This is of importance since the lowest dose only restored C1INH levels for about two 
hours and it was not known whether this would be sufficient to alleviate an attack. The highest dose, 
on the other hand, resulted in supra-normal levels for about 2-3 hours which may be unnecessary. The 
choice  of  doses  is  thus  considered  adequate.  Within  the  open-label  extension  the  option  of  giving  a 
second  dose  of  50  U/kg  was  tested.  This  is  an  adequate  way  of  handling  the  possibility  that  some 
patients may need a longer restoration of C1INH levels than two hours to treat an attack. 
A  very  similar  study  design  was  used  in  both  RCT  studies  (1205  and  1304).  The  rationale  for 
performing  placebo-controlled  trials  is  acceptable  and  in  line  with  the  recommendations  given  in  the 
CHMP  scientific  advice.  The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  acceptable  reflecting  the  target 
population,  especially  since  patients  with  peripheral  attacks  were  included.  Exclusion  of  patients 
experiencing a life-threatening attack is important since the study was placebo-controlled. 
Both studies were designed to show superiority for rhC1INH compared to placebo.  
The primary and secondary endpoints are mainly in line with the scientific advice given by the CHMP, 
and are considered to be clinically relevant. The use of the VAS score in the evaluation of treatment of 
HAE attacks has been accepted in other applications for marketing authorisation.  
Considering the small number of patients, the treatment groups were rather well balanced with regards 
to  age,  sex  and  BMI.  The  only  exception  is  the  placebo  group  in  study  1205,  where  only  one  male 
patient was included. Data in special populations is very limited since only a total of four patients were 
included in the age groups < 18 years and five patients > 65 years were included.  
In  the  RCT  studies,  no  patients  with laryngeal  oedema  were  included  in  the active  treatment  groups. 
The majority of patients were included had abdominal or peripheral attacks.  
Notably, a total of ten patients had previously received treatment with (plasma derived) C1 inhibitor. 
No  patients  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events.  Most  discontinuations  were  due  to  the  fact  that 
patients  entered  the  OLE  phase  of  the  study  before  the  day  90  follow-up.  Overall,  the  only 
CHMP assessment report

discontinuation  due  to  lack  of  effect  occurred  in  one  of  the  placebo  groups.  One  patient  was  lost  to 
follow-up and one patient withdrew consent.  
In  study  1205,  both  doses  showed  significantly  better  effect  than  placebo,  the  median  time  to 
beginning  of  relief  of  symptoms  for  the  50  U/kg  dose  being  twice  as  long  as  for  the  higher  dose 
although  the  95%  CI  for  these  medians  were  overlapping.  The  outcome  of  the  secondary  endpoint 
(median time to minimal symptoms) was not statistically significant in the mITT population, although 
shorter  and  in  the  same  range  for  both  doses  tested  when  compared  to  placebo.  There  were  no 
therapeutic failures in the active treatment groups. The results for the exploratory endpoints were all 
in favour of the active treatment, although the treatment effect was not as evident when evaluated by 
the investigator’s score (IS). More failures were seen in the placebo treated group. 
In  study  1304,  where  only  the  100  U/kg  dose  was  tested,  the  active  treatment  showed  consistently 
significant better effects than placebo, both with regards to the primary and secondary endpoint. The 
time  to  beginning  of  relief  in  the  active  treatment  group  was  in  the  same  range  as  in  study  1205  in 
spite of the somewhat different definition of the primary endpoint in study 1205 (symptom relief with 
persistence).  The  time  to  relief  in  the  placebo  group  was  considerably  longer  in  study  1304  than  in 
study 1205. The applicant’s explanation is that in study 1205, patients had a longer time from start of 
symptoms until presentation for treatment. This explanation is considered plausible. There were three 
patients with treatment failure in the active treatment group as opposed to none in study 1205.  
Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  confirm  the  primary  results  in  both  studies.  The  efficacy 
findings  in  the  pivotal  studies  appear  to  be  robust  and  consistent  in  spite  of  the  small  number  of 
patients. 
Studies 1202 and 1203 allowed re-treatment. The VAS score used was not identical to the one used in 
the RCT trials. Outcomes were comparable to those reported in the RCT studies. Seven patients were 
treated twice. 
The OLE part of study 1205 allowed both a second administration of rhC1INH, and repeated treatments 
in case of new HAE attack. The findings with regards to both the primary and secondary endpoint are 
consistent with the findings in the RCT part of the trial in patients up to the third treatment. Efficacy is 
less  pronounced  in  patients  treated  for  their  fourth  or  fifth  attack,  however,  numbers  are  small.  The 
applicant addressed this during the assessment and provided further efficacy data which demonstrated 
that  efficacy  was  similar  over  repeated  attacks  and  that  there  was  no  trend  for  waning  efficacy  on 
repeat treatment. 
A  different  dosing  was  used  in  the  OLE  part  of  study  1304  where  patients  received  a  single  vial 
containing 2100 U (corresponding to a dose of 18-40 U/kg) with the option of a second dose. Repeated 
treatment in case of a new attack was allowed. In spite of the lower dose, the outcome with regards to 
both the primary and the secondary endpoint was consistent with the findings in the RCT study. In this 
study no tendency of an attenuated effect with repeated treatments was observed.  
Pooled  data  from  both  OLE  studies  were  analysed  for  consistency  of  the  treatment  effect  in  repeated 
attacks.  The  pooled  analysis  does  not  evoke  any  concerns  on  attenuation  of  the  effect  with  repeated 
treatments. 
When all data from both the RCT and OLE phases of studies 1205 and 1304 were pooled with regards 
to the need of an additional dose or therapeutic failure it was observed that the proportion of patients 
experiencing treatment failure was similar between the two higher doses (100 U/kg and 50 U/kg) and 
somewhat  higher  in  the  group  that  received  the  lowest  dose  (18-40  U/kg).  The  patients  treated  with 
the  lowest  dose  also  more  often  needed  a  second  dose.  These  findings  further  support  the  proposed 
posology  since  similar  success  rates  are  achieved  using  this  strategy  (50  U/kg  with  an  option  of  a 
second dose) as in the group receiving a single dose of 100 U/kg. The majority of patients appear to 
be successfully treated with 50 U/kg and only about 10 % need an additional dose. 
In  the  open-label  studies  the  initial  treatment  dose  was  to  be  administered  within  1  hour  after 
eligibility of the angioedema attack was confirmed. At the discretion of the investigator and depending 
upon  the  patient’s  clinical  response,  an  additional  iv  dose  could  be  administered  within  4  hours  from 
the  initial  dose.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  whether  this  strategy  should  be  reflected  in  the 
posology  section  of  the  SPC  and  whether  there  are  any  characteristics  in  the  patient’s  response  that 
could  identify  those  who  either  need  a  second  dose  or  are  non-responders.  The  response  during  the 
assessment  demonstrated  that  there  is  no  need  to  recommend  a  1hr  interval  between  presentation 
and  treatment  of  an  acute  attack  and  that  this  time  interval  was  to  allow  time  for  the  various  study 
procedures. The majority of cases improved within 4hrs and only 10% required and additional 50U/kg 
dose. In addition section 5.1 of the SmPC was revised to include relevant information on the observed 
time to beginning of relief and information on how many patients that were treated with an additional 
dose.

2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the results of the pivotal and supportive studies are consistent and indicate a beneficial 
effect of rhC1INH in the treatment of HAE attacks. The initially proposed posology is supported by the 
findings. The proposed posology with a cut-off weight of >84kg for a flat dose of 4,200 U (two vials) 
was  further  addressed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant  identified  and  reviewed  the  relevant  factors  to 
support the proposal for a fixed dose of 4200U (2 vials) in patients with body weight 84 kg or greater. 
This  is  supported  by  the  PK  model,  efficacy  in  subject  ≥84kg  as  well  as  by  calculation  based  on  the 
literature  about  relationship  between  plasma  volume,  bodyweight  and  height.  The  proposed  weight 
cut-off of 84kg for the fixed dose of 4200U is accepted.

2.4.10.1.  Patient exposure 
Up  to  the  database  cut-off  of  03  September  2008,  144 subjects  (14 healthy  volunteers, 
12 asymptomatic  and  119 symptomatic  HAE  patients)  had  been  exposed

In  addition  to  the  data  presented  in  this  summary  analysis  of  safety,  an  additional  105 acute 
angioedema  attacks  were  treated  with  rhC1INH  in  the  1304  and  1205  OLE  studies  between 
04 September  2008  and  01  March  2009.  Thirty-four  patients,  who  had  been  treated  with  rhC1INH 
before  04 September 2008  were  treated  for  72 subsequent  new  acute  angioedema  attacks  in  the 
period  from  04  September  2008  up  to  01  March  2009.  An  additional  20  patients,  who  received  their 
first treatment with rhC1INH in the period from 04 September 2008 up to 01 March 2009, were treated 
for 33 first and subsequent new acute angioedema attacks.

immunosuppression)  which  has  potentially  high  immunogenicity  due  to  HRI  and  differential 
glycosylation of the rhC1INH, means that a relatively large safety database was required.   
2.4.10.2.  Adverse events  
Studies 1101 and 1106 
Studies 1101 (asymptomatic HAE patients) and 1106 (healthy volunteer subjects) were not included in 
the combined safety analysis. For completeness, a brief summary of safety has been included for these 
2 studies. 
During  the  course  of  Study  1101,  14 possibly  related  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs) 
were  reported,  9  presented  as  headache,  2  as  abdominal  pain,  one as  a  vasovagal  reaction  and  2 as 
local  hematoma  or  skin  reaction.  In  addition,  one acute  angioedema  attack  was  reported  as  an 
unrelated serious adverse event (SAE). None of the AEs were judged as having a definite or probable 
relationship to study drug administration. All AEs occurred on single occasions or intermittently, none 
were persistent. The 3 intermittent TEAEs were considered related to pre-existing disorders. 
During  the  course  of  Study  1106,  a  total  of  57 TEAEs  occurred,  which  were  more  or  less  equally 
distributed  over  the  5 rhC1INH  administration  periods.  One  female  healthy  volunteer  subject 
developed a serious generalised allergic reaction following first exposure to rhC1INH that was reported 
as a drug related SAE and considered to result from a pre-existing but undisclosed allergy to rabbits. 
In  this  study,  all  AEs  occurred  on  single  occasions  or  intermittently  and  none  was  persistent. 
Intermittent  and  repetitive  single  occasion  TEAEs  were  considered  in  most  cases  as  related  to  pre-
existent disorders. Most of the AEs occurring after study drug administration were reported as unlikely 
or  definitely  not  related  to  treatment  as  most  were  considered  to  be  related  to  general  procedures 
associated with a clinical trial, such as food restriction, and insertion of i.v. cannulas. In addition, some 
AEs  were  related  to  a  pre-existing  condition  (eg  tension  headaches  and  migraine),  or  to  the  (winter) 
season  during  which  the  study  was  conducted  (eg,  upper  respiratory  tract  infections).  Of  the  4 AEs 
(7%  of  all  TEAEs)  that  were  reported  as  possibly  related  to  the  study  medication,  one presented  as 
headache, 2 as pruritis, and one as taste perversion. 
Combined safety analysis 
A  combined  safety  analysis  was  performed  using  the  RCT  and  the  Full Safety  Analysis  Sets.  The  RCT 
Safety Analysis Set included data resulting from a single treatment during the RCT phases of Studies 
1205  and  1304.  The  Full  Safety  Analysis  Set  included  AE  data  from  the  6 clinical  studies  in 
symptomatic HAE patients (single and repeat treatments of subsequent new acute angioedema attacks 
per patient).

The  most  common  adverse  events  reported  were  infections  (mainly  upper  respiratory  infections  and 
sinusitis);  these  adverse  events  were  more  common  in  the  active  treatment  group.  Rash  and  pruritis 
was also more common in the active treatment groups (a total of 5 reports). Headache and abdominal 
was also commonly reported, with the same rate in actively and placebo-treated patients. 
The overall rate of TEAEs did not differ between treatment groups including the placebo group. Due to 
the  small  numbers,  it  is  not  possible  to  assess  whether  there  the  TEAEs  are  dose-dependent.  No 
specific pattern can be observed.  
2.4.10.3. 
 Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were observed during any of the trials. 
In  the  combined  safety  analysis,  the  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  was  higher  in  the 
Saline  Solution  dose  group  (3/29 patients,  10%)  than  in  the  rhC1INH  treatment  groups,  either 
individually (range 0% to 5%) or when combined (5/119 patients, 4%). In study 1106, one treatment 
emergent SAE was reported by one patient. The SAE severe allergic reaction occurred during the first 
administration  of  rhC11NH.  The  onset  of  the  first  symptoms  (episode)  emerged  approximately 
3 minutes  after  starting  the  administration  of  rhC11NH  at  100  U/kg.  The  SAE  was  judged  to  be  a 
severe allergic reaction to the study preparation in a subject with a (in retrospect known) pre-existent 
rabbit dander/hair allergy. Apart from this reaction, none of the reported SAEs appear directly related 
to the treatment. 
2.4.10.4. 
 Laboratory findings 
No influence on laboratory parameters or vital signs, including ECG was observed.. 
2.4.10.5. 
 Immunogenicity 
As for any recombinant product, antibodies may be raised against recombinant C1 inhibitor and to host 
related  impurities.  Therefore,  extensive  immunogenicity  testing  has  been  undertaken  throughout  the 
rhC1INH clinical development program. The immunogenicity testing has looked for the development of 
antibodies  against  pdC1INH,  rhC1INH,  and  HRI.  A  schedule  for  plasma  sample  collection  was  pre-
specified in every clinical study protocol. In addition, although not foreseen in any of the clinical study 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010

protocols,  immunogenicity  testing  to  look  for  the  presence  of  IgE  antibodies  against  rabbit,  cow  and 
other animal allergens has been undertaken on plasma samples collected from the majority of healthy 
volunteer and HAE patients exposed to rhC1INH. 
These immunogenicity testing findings indicated: 
•  No  persistent  antibody  responses  above  cut  off  levels  to  pdC1INH,  rhC1INH,  in  symptomatic 
HAE patients following first or subsequent repeat treatment exposure to rhC1INH at doses up 
to 100 U/kg body weight (N.B., up to 12 exposures for one patient in the integrated analysis) 
Concerning Antibodies to C1 INH: 
The  applicant  provided  immunogenicity  testing  data  undertaken  beyond  March  2009,  i.e.  all 
available immunogenicity testing data from administrations of rhC1INH through October 2009. 
From  the  results  the  applicant’s  position  that  the  antibodies  were  not  clinically  relevant  in 
terms  of  efficacy  is  supported.  Data  on  safety  and  all  AEs  of  cases  who  had  antibodies  to 
C1INH was provided and this data demonstrated that no AEs were considered likely related to 
the presence of antibodies. Two cases of injection site reactions occurred, but in both subjects 
subsequent  infusions  were  not  associated  with  any  AE.    These  data  support  the  applicant’s 
conclusion  that  there  was  no  apparent  significant  clinical  safety  concern  and  no  relationship 
was observed to adverse events.  
•  No  neutralizing  antibodies  to  C1INH  were  found  in  any  of  the  symptomatic  HAE  patients 
following first or repeat exposure to rhC1INH 
   Concerning anti-HRI antibodies: 
The  applicant  provided  all  available  immunogenicity  testing  data  from  administrations  of 
rhC1INH  through  October  2009.  Overall,  there  were  some  findings  of  positive  pre-  and  post-
exposure anti-HRI antibodies in both healthy volunteer subjects and HAE patients who received 
rhC1INH as treatment for several acute angioedema attacks. Most of these anti-HRI antibodies 
were  not  positive  in  the  displacement  assay.  In  the  remaining  cases,  where  there  was 
confirmation  of  anti-HRI  antibodies  by  the  displacement  assay,  there  was  no  apparent 
significant clinical safety concern.  
•  No persistent anti-HRI responses were found in the symptomatic HAE patients included in the 
open label and RCT clinical studies up to 03 September 2008. 
The  applicant  also  committed  to  make  available  validated  testing  for  antibody  development  to  C1INH 
and  HRI  in  cases  with  clinical  features  suggestive  of  an  antibody  response.  This  proposal  is  strongly 
supported.  Expedited  reporting  of  such  cases  has  been  agreed  by  the  applicant  and  educational 
materials will be made available. 
A  post  hoc  analysis  of  available  plasma  samples  was  carried  out  to  test  for  the  presence  of  IgE 
antibodies  against  rabbit  and  cow  milk  allergens,  and  the  rhC1INH  clinical  safety  database  was 
searched  for  AEs  potentially  indicating  allergic  reactions.  All  laboratory  testing  for  IgE  antibodies  was 
performed  using  the  ImmunoCap  Allergy  Blood  Test  system  (Phadiatop,  Uppsala,  Sweden).  Both 
datasets were compared.  
In summary, the IgE antibody testing findings were as follows: 
• 
• 
The  highest  pre-existing  IgE  antibody  level  against  rabbit  dander  (epithelium)  allergens  was 
found  in  the  healthy  volunteer  subject  who  developed  an  anaphylactic  reaction  following 
exposure to rhC1INH in Phase 1 Study 1106. 
It is considered probable that elevated IgE against rabbit dander indicates an increased risk for 
adverse allergic reactions following exposure to rhC1INH. 
•  Apart from IgE antibodies against rabbit dander and possibly rabbit urine, no relationship was 
noted  between  pre-existing  IgE  antibodies  against  a  wide  range  of  animal  allergens  and 
reported AEs. 
• 
This retrospective analysis did not indicate that pre-existing IgE antibodies to animal allergens 
other  than  rabbit  dander,  constitute  a  potential  risk  for  adverse  allergic  reactions  following 
exposure to rhC1INH. In particular, the applicant maintains that there was no indication of any 
risk due to the presence of pre-existing IgE against cow milk allergens.  
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 46/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However  these  cases  with  IgE  antibodies  to  cow’s  milk  did  not  have  clinical  evidence  of  cow’s  milk 
allergy. IgE to allergens can be present in the absence of clinical symptoms. A warning has been added 
to section 4.4 of the SPC to alert the prescribing physician about the lack of information available and 
the possible cross-reactivity of cow’s milk-specific IgE to rhC1INH in patients with clinical evidence of 
cow’s milk allergy.  
•  On the data available from this retrospective analysis, it was concluded that single and repeat 
exposure  to  up  to  100  U/  kg  body  weight  rhC1INH  did  not  induce  detectable  IgE  antibody 
responses against rabbit or other animal allergens. 
It was proposed that the SPC should reflect that commercially available tests could be used to evaluate 
the potential risk for allergic reactions due to allergy to rabbits. The applicant has revised section 4.4 
of the SPC with the suggested commercially available test which was utilised in the clinical programme 
and is widely available.  
2.4.10.6. 
 Thrombogenicity 
Asymptomatic  HAE  patients  have  mild  activation  of  coagulation  and  fibrinolysis  as  reflected  by 
increased  circulating  levels  of  parameters  such  as  F1+2  fragment,  thrombin-antithrombin  III  (TAT) 
complexes  and  plasmin-α2-antiplasmin  (PAP)  complexes.  These  activation  processes  further  enhance 
during acute angioedema attacks and there are data indicating that infusion of pdC1INH can diminish 
increased  platelet  aggregability  and  decrease  factor  XIIa  and  F1+2  fragment  levels  in  patients  with 
HAE. 
A  concern  about  a  possible  risk  for  thromboembolic  complications  arises  from  the  published  reports 
with  off-label  administration  of  high  dose  pdC1INH  (500-1050  U/kg,  which  is  25  to  50  times  higher 
than the recommended dose for an angioedema attack) in neonates at risk for capillary leak syndrome 
who underwent cardiosurgery with extracorporeal circulation for major cardiovascular malformations. 
Laboratory  testing  was  undertaken  to  investigate  the  effects  of  rhC1INH  on  activation  of  coagulation 
and of fibrinolysis in symptomatic HAE patients. Samples collected from 25 HAE patients were included 
in this testing. 
Overall,  it is concluded  from  the laboratory  testing  that  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  the  effects  of 
rhC1INH on activation of coagulation and of fibrinolysis and the detailed review of published nonclinical 
and clinical data that there is no evidence to support a concern about thromboembolic risk arising from 
the  proposed  use  of  rhC1INH  in  the  treatment  of  acute  angioedema  attacks  in  HAE  patients  for  the 
following reasons: 
1.  The  findings  on  coagulation  and  fibrinolytic  parameters  in  HAE  patients  treated  with  rhC1INH 
indicated  no  effect  of  rhC1INH  on  activation  of  coagulation  and fibrinolysis in  HAE  patients  at 
the doses administered. 
2.  Up to 01 March 2009, no thromboembolic adverse events following administration of rhC1INH 
have been reported from the clinical program of rhC1INH in HAE patients (405 administrations 
of rhC1INH at doses ranging from appr. 18-120 U/kg body weight). The maximum number of 
treatments received by a single patient is 20, 14 HAE patients have received 5 administrations 
or more. 
2.4.10.7. 
 Safety in special populations 
No separate analysis has been conducted for special populations. 
The  very  limited  experience  of  treating  paediatric patients  with  rhC1INH  does  not  indicate  a  different 
profile of AEs compared to the adult population.  
2.4.10.8. 
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  drug  interaction  studies  were  performed  in  this  clinical  program.  rhC1INH  is  the  recombinant 
analogue  of  endogenous  C1INH.  Literature  data  indicate  an  interaction  of  tissue  type  plasminogen 
activator (tPA) and C1INH product. Interactions with other drugs are not anticipated due to the nature 
and metabolism of the product..

2.4.10.9. 
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No  patients  in  the  phase  II  and  III  trials  were  discontinued  due  to  AEs.  During  the  phase  I  trials, 
one patient was withdrawn from the study after reporting systemic pruritus within 72 hours of the first 
dose of rhC1INH and was withdrawn from the study on Day 22. 
2.4.10.1
0.  Post marketing experience 
No  post-marketing  experience  data  were  available,  as  the  product  had  not  yet  been  placed  on  the 
market in the European Union or in any other countries. 
2.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database includes 119 patients that have been treated for a total of 217 attacks as well as 
safety  data  from  the  two  phase  I  studies  include  14  healthy  volunteers  and  12  asymptomatic  HAE 
patients. Altogether 300 treatments/doses of rhC1INH have been given within the study program up to 
September  2008.  A  further  105  treatments  have  been  administered  in  the  ongoing  open-label 
extensions up to March 2009. The database also includes patients that have been treated for repeated 
attacks. The majority of treatments have been given according to the proposed posology.  
In  the  phase  I  studies  1101  and  1106,  very  few  adverse  events  were  reported.  In  study  1106, 
headache  was  the  only  AE  that  was  consistently  reported  in  four  out  of  five  treatment  periods.  One 
anaphylactic reaction was observed, highlighting the importance of identification of patients at risk for 
allergic reactions. 
In the RCT studies 1205 and 1304, the overall rate of TEAEs does not differ between treatment groups 
including the placebo group. Due to the small numbers in each group, no specific pattern can be found. 
Due  to  the  small  numbers,  it  is  impossible  to  assess  whether  there  the  TEAEs  are  dose-dependent. 
Overall, the rate of TEAEs was similar or slightly lower than in the placebo treated group. 
The  pattern  of  adverse  events  does  not  evoke  any  new  safety  concerns.  The  most  common  adverse 
events  reported  were  infections  (mainly  upper  respiratory  infections  and  sinusitis);  these  adverse 
events were more common in the active treatment group, Rash and pruritis was also more common in 
the active treatment groups (a total of 5 reports). Headache and abdominal pain was also commonly 
reported, with the same rate in actively and placebo-treated patients. No deaths occurred during any 
of  the  clinical  studies.  No  influence  on  laboratory  parameters  or  vital  signs,  including  ECG  was 
observed. 
The  data  from  the  OLE  parts  of  studies  1205  and  1304  supports  the  previously  described  safety 
findings. No new safety concerns have emerged. 
Apart from the acute anaphylactic reaction recorded in study 1106, none of the reported SAEs appear 
directly related to the treatment. 
Very  few  non-Caucasian  subjects  were  included  in  the  studies.  As  judged  from  the  biochemical  data, 
no  patients  with  severe  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  were  included  in  the  RCT  safety  population.  The 
lack of data is reflected in the revised SPC provided in the responses to the Day 120 LoQ.  
The program for evaluating the immunogenic potential of rhC1INH is considered to be satisfactory. 
In  addition  the  applicant’s  plan  to  make  immunogenicity  testing  available  for  cases  who  present  with 
features suggestive of an antibody response (to HRIs or C1 INH) will enable close monitoring of such 
events. 
As  the  product  is  purified  rhC1INH  from  rabbit  milk,  the  different  glycosylation  of  rhC1INH  compared 
with  pdC1INH  and  also  the  range  of  HRIs  present  in  the  transgenic  product  can  lead  to  clinical 
reactions in cases with pre-formed IgE antibodies and can also lead to the development of antibodies 
(to HRIs and C1 INH) on repeated administration. 
Pre-existing  IgE  to  HRIs  present  in  the  product  can  lead  to  a  serious  allergic  reaction  on  first 
administration as was seen in the HV with rabbit allergy. Repeated administrations of rhC1INH can lead 
to  an  immune  reaction  and  antibody  responses  against  rhC1INH  with  possible  cross-reactivity  to 
pdC1INH and also to antibody responses to HRIs. 
Pre-existing IgE antibodies to HRIs in rabbit milk caused a generalised allergic reaction in one healthy 
volunteer. The presence of IgE to rabbit dander was implicated in this case. As the safety database is 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 48/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
limited the applicant further discussed the range of allergens to be tested prior to starting a patient on 
rhC1INH.  Prior  to  initiation  of  treatment  the  optimal  allergy  screen  would  be  an  IgE  to  rabbit  milk, 
however as this is not available the applicant’s proposal to test for IgE to rabbit dander in section 4.4 
of the SPC is endorsed. 
Regarding  the  rhC1INH  itself,  the  applicant  has  developed  assays  to  measure  antibody  responses  to 
rhC1INH and pdC1INH. The timing and development of antibodies to rhC1INH in subjects in all clinical 
studies was further discussed by the applicant. The requested data for timelines of treatments, results 
of  positive  assays  and  efficacy  was  provided.  From  the  results  the  applicant’s  position  that  the 
antibodies were not clinically relevant in terms of efficacy is supported. Data on safety is in these cases 
was provided and did not suggest any safety concerns in cases who developed antibodies to C1INH. 
Regarding  anti-HRIs,  patients  that  were  shown  to  have  increased  levels  of  anti-HRI  antibodies  were 
retreated without infusions reactions. So far, there has been no indication that the antibodies detected 
are of clinical relevance. Further data was provided by the applicant during the assessment. The data 
supported  the  applicant’s  position  that  no  consistent  pattern  of  anti-HRI  development  was  seen  on 
repeated  administrations  of  rhC1INH.  No  clinically  significant  AEs  were  associated  with  anti-HRIs  and 
the  applicant’s  proposal  to  test  patients  with  clinical  features  suggestive  of  development  of  anti-HRIs 
will provide further long term information on this point. 
Concerns have been raised that rhC1INH, which is given in higher concentrations than pdC1INH, would 
have  a  thrombogenic  potential.  This  has  been  evaluated  by  the  applicant  during  the  clinical 
development without indications that this may be the case. 
2.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  data  has  highlighted  the  possibility  for  a  systemic  allergic  reaction  in  a  patient  with  pre-
existing rabbit allergy. This has been clearly highlighted, and the suggested tests to use for detection 
of such antibodies are described in section 4.4 of the revised SPC.  
Other  important  safety  issue  identified  relate  to  the  development  of  and  the  possible  clinical 
consequences  of  antibodies  (IgG,  IgM  IgA)  to  rhC1INH  and  to  HRIs.  From  the  updated  analysis  of 
subjects  who  developed  anti-HRIs,  provided  by  the  applicant  during  the  assessment,  no  clinical 
consequences  have  been  identified  thus  far.  From  the  updated  information  on  cases  that  had  anti- 
C1INH antibodies detected, no effect on efficacy or safety was noted.  
An  additional  issue  which  has  been  addressed  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  is  the  potential  for  cross-
reactivity of IgE present in patients with clinical evidence of cow’s milk allergy to rabbit milk HRIs. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
The applicant provided a pharmacovigilance system in section 1.8.1 of Module 1. 
2.7.1.  Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.7.2.  Risk management plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

Section 4.3 of the SPC (Contraindications) 
includes “Known or suspected allergy to rabbits” 
as contraindication. 
Section 4.4 of the SPC (Warnings and 
Precautions) includes the following: Conestat alfa 
rhC1INH is derived from milk of transgenic 
rabbits and contains traces of rabbit protein. 
Before initiating treatment with Ruconest, all 
HAE patients should be tested for the presence 
of IgE antibodies against rabbit allergens using 
a validated test for IgE antibodies against rabbit 
epithelium (dander) e.g. ImmunoCap system, 
Phadia, Sweden. Only patients who have been 
shown to have negative results for such test 
should be treated with Ruconest. IgE antibody 
testing should be repeated once a year or after 
10 treatments, whichever occurs first.  
As with any intravenously administered protein 
product, hypersensitivity reactions cannot be 
excluded.  
Patients must be closely monitored and carefully 
observed for any symptoms of hypersensitivity 
throughout the administration period. Patients 
should be informed of the early signs of 
hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. If these 
symptoms occur after administration, they 
should alert their physician. 
In case of anaphylactic reactions or shock, 
emergency standard medical treatment should 
be administered. 
And Section 4.2 of the SPC states:”Patients who 
have not previously received Ruconest should be 
tested for the presence of IgE antibodies against 
rabbit epithelium (dander) prior to initiation of 
Ruconest. See section 4.4.”

The following information is included in SPC 
Section 4.2 (Posology): 
The safety and efficacy of Ruconest in children 
(age 0 to 12 years) has not yet been established. 
Currently available data on adolescents (age 13 to 
17 years) are described in section 5.1, but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made.  
Pregnant and

The following information is included in SPC 
Section 4.6 (Pregnancy and lactation): 
There is no experience about the use of Ruconest 
in pregnant and breast-feeding women. In one 
animal study reproductive toxicity was observed 
(see section 5.3). 
Ruconest is not recommended for use during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding, unless the treating 
physician judges the benefits to outweigh the 
possible risks. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  MA  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal 
product:  
Prior  to  launch  of  the  product  in  each  Member  State,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  shall  agree 
the content and format of the educational material with the national competent authority 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  should  ensure  that,  at  launch,  all  Healthcare  Professionals 
who are expected to prescribe Ruconest are provided with an Educational pack. 
The educational pack should contain the following: 
•  Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for Ruconest 
•  Educational material for the physician. 
•  Copies of the patient card to be given to patients before they receive Ruconest 
The educational material for the prescriber should include information on the following key elements: 
• 
• 
That  Ruconest  should  be  initiated  under  the  guidance  and  supervision  of  a  physician 
experienced  in  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  hereditary  angioedema  and  should  be 
administered by a health care professional. 
That  patients  treated  with  Ruconest  should  be  monitored  for  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of 
hypersensitivity  during  administration.  Emergency  medical  treatment  should  be  available 
immediately to be administered in case of anaphylactic reactions or shock.

 User consultation 
The user testing was conducted appropriately and three rounds were performed, initially a pilot phase 
(3 subjects) followed by a Stage 1 (10 subjects). Following Stage 1, minor modifications were made to 
the PIL. The final Stage included another 10 subjects. All questions met the criteria that 16/20 subjects 
should  be  able  to  locate  and  understand  the  questions.  The  questions  were  relevant  to  the  action  of 
the drug, and to the main safety concerns and what actions to take in the event of problems.  
The  overall  layout  and  readability  of  the  PIL  were  considered  satisfactory  by  the  participants.  The 
conclusions from the report were clear and concise. 
2.7.3.  Benefit-risk balance  
2.7.3.1. 
 Benefits 
2.7.3.1.1. 
 Beneficial effects 
A  beneficial  and  clinically  relevant  effect  was  shown  for  rhC1INH  in  the  primary  endpoint,  time  to 
beginning of relief, in both randomised studies compared to placebo. The data were statistically robust 
and supported by the outcome of the secondary endpoint and by pharmacodynamic data. Exploratory 
endpoints  were  also  in  most  parts  in  favour  of  rhC1INH.  The  median  time  to  beginning  of  relief 
observed is comparable to that reported for plasma-derived C1INH and also for icatibant. 
Dose-finding was based on previous experience with plasma-derived C1INH and from pharmacokinetic 
and  pharmacodynamic  studies  in  asymptomatic  HAE  patient.  Two  doses  (50  and  100  U/kg)  were 
evaluated  within  the  RCT  studies  and  this  choice  is  considered  adequate.  The  data  from  the  RCT 
studies support the choice to continue the clinical programme with the 50 U/kg dose with the option to 
give  an  additional  dose  within  four  hours  from  the  first  administration.  The  posology  to  administer  a 
dose of 50 U/kg in adults up to 84kg, and a dose of 4,200 U in adults over 84 Kg, i.e. a weight–based 
cut-off of 84 kg is endorsed. 
The effect of treatment on patients with severe laryngeal oedema across all clinical studies have been 
analysed  and  the  data  indicate  that  rhC1INH  is  efficacious  also  in  these  attacks,  however,  time  to 
beginning  of  relief  appears  to  be  somewhat  longer  than  in  other  locations.  Additional  efficacy  data 
provided  support  the  proposed  dose  of  50U/kg  demonstrating  that  the  median  time  to  beginning  of 
relief  of  symptoms  was  the  similar  for  potentially  life-threatening  attacks  (PLA)  as  for  all  attacks, 
Therefore the proposed dose of 50 U/kg for PLA attacks as for other sites is endorsed. 
2.7.3.1.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The  effect  of  rhC1INH  appears  to  be  similar  for  different  anatomical  locations  of  the  attack,  and  also 
across studied subgroups. However, the available data are limited.  
Efficacy  has  been  studied  in  patients  receiving  treatment  for  up  to  20  HAE  attacks.  Nevertheless, 
uncertainties  remain  as  to  whether  the  efficacy  will  wane  on  long  term  repeated  administration  in 
subjects who develop antibodies against rhC1INH. 
Information from treatment in special populations is limited or lacking. 
2.7.3.2. 
 Risks 
2.7.3.2.1. 
 Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  data  base  is  still  limited.  In  total,  165 subjects  (14 healthy  volunteers,  12 asymptomatic 
and 139 symptomatic HAE patients) had been exposed to a total of 405 administrations of rhC1INH. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 54/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  major  risk  already  identified  is  the  risk  of  allergic  reactions  in  patients  with  known  or  unknown 
allergy  to  rabbits.  One  healthy  volunteer  experienced  a  serious  allergic  reaction  to  rhC1INH  and  was 
shown  to  have  high  IgE  titres  against  rabbit  allergens.  Once  identified,  this  risk  may  be  possible  to 
handle by preventive measures such as testing patients before exposure. This information on the use 
of commercially available tests to identify patients has been added to the SPC. 
Recombinant protein products such as rhC1INH administered to human subjects may elicit antibodies 
against the recombinant protein, its endogenous counterpart, and against HRI in the drug product. The 
immunogenic  potential  of  rhC1INH  has  been  studied  within  the  clinical  programme  and  methods  to 
detect antibodies have been developed. Although increased levels of antibodies sporadically have been 
detected,  there  has  been  no  indication  this  far  that  they  are  of  clinical  relevance  in  terms  of  either 
efficacy or safety. 
Concerns have been raised that rhC1INH, which is given in higher concentrations than pdC1INH, would 
have  a  thrombogenic  potential.  This  has  been  evaluated  by  the  applicant  during  the  clinical 
development without indications that this may be the case. 
The  pattern  of  other  adverse  events  does  not  evoke  any  new  safety  concerns.  The  most  common 
adverse  events  reported  were  infections  (mainly  upper  respiratory  infections  and  sinusitis);  these 
adverse  events  were  more  common  in  the  active  treatment  group.  Rash  and  pruritis  was  also  more 
common in the active treatment groups (a total of 5 reports). Headache and abdominal pain was also 
commonly  reported,  with  the  same  rate  in  actively  and  placebo-treated  patients.  No  deaths  occurred 
during  any  of  the  clinical  studies.  Apart  from  the  allergic  reaction  discussed  above,  none  of  the 
reported SAEs appear directly related to the treatment. 
2.7.3.2.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited and further safety data will have to be collected in a post-authorisation 
safety study. Such measures have been proposed by the applicant. In addition the applicant will make 
available immunogenicity testing (for anti-C1INH and anti-HRI antibodies) for cases who present with 
features  suggestive  of  an  immune  response.  The  applicant  is  also  developing  a  skin  prick  test  for 
rhC1INH.  Both  of  these  plans  are  strongly  supported.  In  view  of  the  complexity  of  the  planned 
immunogenicity testing the applicant is requested to provide educational materials for this. 
Antibody development to rhC1INH could lead to reduction in efficacy, and if cross-reactive to pdC1INH 
might  lead  to  worsening  of  HAE  and  even  reduction  of  loss  of  efficacy  from  pdC1INH  treatment. 
Although  there  is  no  evidence  of  this  from  the  efficacy  data  available  to  date,  it  remains  a  potential 
problem.  
A  further  concern  is  the  possible  cross-reactivity  between  cow’s  milk  and  rabbit  milk.  Because  the 
homology between these species is low and similar to the homology of camel and horse milk to cow’s 
milk, the likelihood for cross-reactivity is predicted to be low. However cross-reactivities can occur with 
serious consequences and therefore a warning in section 4.4 of the SPC has been added for those with 
clinical evidence of cow’s milk allergy.  
2.7.3.3. 
 Benefit-risk balance 
2.7.3.3.1. 
 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
rhC1INH  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  acute  HAE  attacks  a  rare  and  potentially  life-threatening 
condition.  Efficacy  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  by  generating  clinically  relevant  and  statistically 
robust data. The importance of these favourable effects is supported through: 
continued availability of supply due to independence of donor plasma; 
targeting the additional mediators of swelling in angioedema other than bradykinin; 
• 
• 
•  not being a blood-derived product thereby removing the potential risk of blood-born pathogens. 
rhC1INH unfavourable effects relate to the fact that pre-exiting allergy to rabbit dander was identified 
as the probable cause of the severe allergic reaction in the healthy volunteer. Patients who are rabbit 
allergic are those who are likely to have a major allergic reaction on their first treatment with rhC1INH. 
This  very  serious  event,  particularly  if  it  occurs  in  an  attack  of  laryngeal  oedema  could  be  fatal. 
Avoiding  treating  such  cases  is  very  important  and  the  identification  of  such  cases  in  clinical  practice 
will  be  central  to  the  safe  use  of  the  product.  This  should  be  achieved  with  the  contraindication  in 
section 4.3 and the further advice in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
CHMP assessment report  
 EMA/CHMP/450053/2010 
Page 55/57
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The importance of anti-rhC1INH would be the potential reduction in efficacy with rhC1INH and possibly 
also  with  pdC1INH  treatment.  The  availability  of  alternative  treatment  with  icatibant  makes  this 
possibility one in which the patient will still be able to receive treatment. Further information from the 
PASS study will help to address these uncertainties. 
The importance of anti-HRIs is that these antibodies may lead to infusion reactions and serum-sickness 
symptoms. These effects would lead patients to discontinue rhC1INH and switch to another treatment. 
2.7.3.3.2. 
 Benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  for  the  treatment  of  this  rare  and  potentially  life-threatening 
condition. Antibody development to rhC1INH and to HRI has not been demonstrated to result in clinical 
sequelae  to  date.  The  importance  of  these  unfavourable  effects  is  considered  to  be  limited  to  those 
who  have  IgE  to  rabbit  allergens  and  to  those  who  mount  an  immune  response  to  rhC1INH  and/or 
HRIs.  
Important  for  clinical  practice  is  to  avoid  using  the  product  in  patients  who  are  rabbit  allergic  due  to 
potentially  serious  allergic  reactions.  This  very  serious  event,  particularly  if  it  occurs  in  an  attack  of 
laryngeal oedema could be fatal. Avoiding treating such cases is very important and the identification 
of such cases in clinical practice will be central to the safe use of the product. Rabbit allergy constitutes 
a contraindication and the SPC proposes that before initiating treatment with rhC1INH, patients should 
be  tested  for  the  presence  of  IgE  antibodies  against  rabbit  allergens  using  a  validated  test  for  IgE 
antibodies  against  rabbit  epithelium  (dander)  e.g.  ImmunoCap  system.  Only  patients  who  have  been 
shown  to  have  negative  results  for  such  tests,  should  be  treated  with  rhC1INH.  IgE  antibody  testing 
should be repeated once a year or after 10 treatments, whichever occurs first.  
A potential risk of cross-reactivity of IgE specific for cow’s milk in those who have clinical evidence of 
IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy remains. This has been addressed in the SPC.  
2.7.3.4. 
 Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of rhC1INH is a ready supply of a new treatment for acute attacks in HAE for which efficacy 
has  been  clearly  demonstrated.  For  the  safety  concerns  that  have  been  identified  (namely  allergic 
reaction in those with pre-formed IgE antibody to rabbit dander) it is considered possible to minimise 
the risk of such events occurring by having rabbit allergy as a contraindication and by the requirement 
for a negative test for IgE to rabbit dander to be obtained in a patient prior to initiation of treatment. 
These points are clearly highlighted in the SPC. 
Specific educational material for healthcare professionals as well as patient alert cards will be provided 
by the applicant. 
The  potential  for  a  patient  to  develop  antibodies  to  rhC1INH  and/or  to  HRIs  following  repeated 
treatment  remains  a  potential  risk  and  further  information  on  this  will  be  made  available  post 
authorisation. In particular, the applicant commits to make anti-C1INH antibody tests available for any 
HAE patient on Ruconest meeting any of the following criteria: 
a)  In two consecutive acute angioedema attacks there is a need for a dose greater than 50U/kg 
rhC1INH in any HAE patient that previously responded to treatment with 50 U/kg rhC1INH. 
b)  In two consecutive acute angioedema attacks a failure to respond to rhC1INH treatment within 
4  hours  despite  adequate  dosing  of  50  U/kg  in  any  HAE  patient  who  previously  responded  to 
treatment with 50 U/kg rhC1INH.  
In  addition,  the  applicant  commits  to  make  anti  HRI  antibody  tests  available  for  any  HAE  patient  on 
Ruconest meeting any of the following criteria: 
1.  Type III hypersensitivity reaction (skin, joints or kidney symptoms) in temporal relation with a 
Ruconest  administration  which  after  investigation  of  other  causes  cannot  be  explained  by 
exposure and reaction to other allergens. 
2.  Type III hypersensitivity in temporal relation with two consecutive administrations of Ruconest. 
The  company  also  commits  to  expedited  reporting  for  cases  concerning  development  of  antibodies  to 
C1INH and/or HRIs.  
CHMP assessment report

An important element of the long-term risk management strategy is the commitment to perform a post 
authorisation  safety  study,  for  which  the  protocol  will  be  agreed  with  the  CHMP  prior  to  study  start. 
This  study  should  also  include  follow-up  of  HAE  patients  repeatedly  treated  with  rhC1INH  for  acute 
angioedema.  In  addition  to  the  testing  provided  in  the  PASS  study  the  applicant  commits  to  make 
certain antibody tests (anti-C1INH and HRI) available for patients who have not consented to the PASS 
study and who fulfil the criteria for further immunogenicity investigation.  
These data will be important for the monitoring of the benefit risk balance. 
In conclusion, the benefit risk balance is considered positive. 
2.7.3.5. 
 Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns. 
the following additional risk minimisation activities were required:  
See section 3.7.2 Risk Management Plan. 
2.7.4.  Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Ruconest is not similar to Firazyr within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
2.7.5.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Ruconest  in  the  “treatment  acute  angioedema  attacks  in  adults  with 
hereditary  angioedema  (HAE)  due  to  C1  esterase  inhibitor  deficiency”  was  favourable  and  therefore 
recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation. 
In  addition,  the  CHMP,  with  reference  to  Article  8  of  Regulation EC  No  141/2000,  considers  Ruconest 
not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Firazyr for the 
same therapeutic indication.

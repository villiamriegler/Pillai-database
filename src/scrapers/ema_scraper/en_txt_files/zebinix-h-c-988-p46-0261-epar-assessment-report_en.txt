1.  Introduction 
This Post Authorisation Measure (PAM) submission concerns the extended submission of a clinical study 
- BIA-2093-211/EXT - to evaluate the safety profile of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) when used for 1 
year by infants as well as to perform exploratory efficacy analyses in this population. Subjects eligible 
for this study were those infants who completed Study BIA-2093-211.  
With PAM in October 2020 BIAL - Portela & Cª S.A. (Bial) submitted final study results and report 
related to paediatric population in line with Article 46 of paediatric regulation 1901/2006 for Study BIA-
2093-211, an open-label, 2-dose level trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of 
ESL as adjunctive therapy in infants with refractory epilepsy with partial-onset seizures aged from 1 
month to <2 years. 
Study BIA-2093-211/EXT is now totally completed with last patient completing the study (LPLV) on the 
11th May 2021. The due date for submission of this CSR is 11th November 2021 (6 months from the 
completion of study). The CSR is dated 12 October 2021. Through the present application, the 
applicant is submitting to the EMA the results of this Clinical Study conducted in the paediatric 
population in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. A short critical expert 
overview has also been provided.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL; BIA 2-093, Zebinix®) was developed by BIAL-Portela & Cª., S.A. (BIAL) 
as an antiepileptic drug (AED). 
ESL is authorized as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS), with or without 
secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy and as adjunctive therapy in adults, 
adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with POS with or without secondary generalisation. The 
clinical development of ESL for monotherapy in the paediatric population as well as adjunctive therapy 
is ongoing. 
Zebinix is approved as immediate release tablets containing 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of ESL and as 
an oral suspension (50 mg/mL). 
Pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 as amended, BIAL submitted to the EMA on 
22 September 2014 an application for modification of the agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
with a deferral and a waiver as set out in the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA)decision P/213/2011 
issued on 2 September 2011, the decision P/0058/2012 issued on 26 March 2012, the decision 
P/0284/2012 issued on 23 November 2012 and the decision P/0197/2013 issued on 2 September 2013 
and the decision P/0015/2015 issued on 30 January 2015. The last modification of the PIP (EMEA-
000696-PIP02-10-M06) submitted on 21 March 2019 and was approved by EMA decision P/0272/2019 
on 14 August 2019. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
BIA-2093-211/EXT  
Description 
Study BIA-2093-211/EXT was a Phase 2, multinational, open-label extension of Study BIA-2093-211, 
which enrolled infants (≥1 month to <2 years) with refractory epilepsy who were experiencing POS. 
The objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of 1 year of treatment with ESL in 
the defined patient population and to perform exploratory analyses of efficacy. No primary or 
secondary objectives were defined for this study. All objectives were used to collect long-term data and 
were evaluated descriptively. Exploratory analysis of efficacy was assessed by evaluation of seizures 
(date, time, type, and duration) at each visit. Safety was assessed by monitoring/evaluation of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical safety laboratory tests at pre-specified time points (Table 2). 
After completion of Study BIA-2093-211, parent(s) or guardian(s) could choose to allow their child to 
continue treatment with ESL for 1 year in Study BIA- 2093-211/EXT. During this 1-year study, 
subjects were grouped by treatment; age cohorts were not taken into consideration. 
Up to 24 subjects will be enrolled in the extension study at an estimated 22 centres in approximately 
12 to 13 countries in Europe (including Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia, 
Serbia, and Ukraine). Other countries may be added as needed.

be considered as well, due to major physiological modifications occurring rapidly during the first 
2 years of life. The study showed high inter-individual variability in the PK of eslicarbazepine in the 
different age groups.  
During the Treatment Period, the median standardised seizure frequency (i.e. median number of 
seizures per week) decreased for all dose groups with the greatest decrease in the lowest dose group 
( ≤ 20 mg/kg/day) and the lowest decrease in the highest dose group (> 25 mg/kg/day). On a 
percentage basis, the median relative percent change ranged from -86.01% in the lowest dose group 
( ≤ 20 mg/kg/day) to -12.68% in the highest dose group (> 25 mg/kg/day). A similar pattern was 
observed during the Down-titration and Follow-up Periods. Of note, efficacy results in the highest dose 
group were not explored beyond the maximum daily dose allowed in the study (30 mg/kg/day). The 
reductions in seizure frequencies were similar between male and female subjects. 
Among male subjects during the treatment period, the median relative change from baseline was 
similar among all dose groups ranging from -70.30% to -86.64% seizures per week compared with 
baseline. A similar pattern was observed among dose groups during the Down-titration and Follow-up 
Periods. A greater number of seizures per week relative to the Treatment and Follow-up Periods was 
observed during the Down-titration Period. 
Among female subjects during the Treatment Period, the median relative change from baseline was 
similar among the 2 lowest dose groups ranging from -81.52% to -88.04%. With only 1 female subject 
in the highest dose group, the median relative change from baseline was 61.28%. A similar pattern 
was observed during the Downtitration and Follow-up Periods. 
During the Treatment Period (up to 52 weeks duration), 1 subject was seizure free: a female subject in 
the ≤20 mg/kg/day dose group. 
The most common seizure type reported during the study was complex partial, followed by partial 
evolving to secondarily generalized. Noteworthy reductions from baseline in standardized seizure 
frequency during the Treatment Period were primarily observed for complex partial and partial evolving 
to secondarily generalized types of seizures. 
For complex partial seizures, median relative reductions from baseline during the Treatment Period 
were similar for all dose groups and ranged from -50.13 % to -86.34 % for all dose groups. For 
complex partial seizures, no notable differences were observed between male and female subjects in 
the relative change from baseline. For both sexes, the percentage reductions from baseline were 
similar among dose groups ranging from -50.13% to - 87.23% for male subjects and -53.66% to 
- 87.42% for female subjects. 
For partial evolving to secondarily generalised type of seizures, none were observed at baseline in the 
highest > 25 mg/kg/day dose group but were observed in the other 2 dose groups. Mean standardised 
seizure frequency was 7.3 for the lowest dose and 39.7 for the mid dose (Table 3). During the 
Treatment Period, the median percentage reductions from baseline were similar for the 2 lowest dose 
groups ranging from -81.52% to -95.00%. 
During the baseline period, simple partial seizures were only observed in the lowest dose group but 
were observed in all 3 dose groups during the treatment period and later periods. Therefore, relative 
changes from baseline cannot be calculated during subsequent periods of this trial for the 2 dose 
groups with 0 seizures during the baseline period. Median relative change from baseline in the lowest 
dose group was 12.15% during the Treatment Period, 55% during the Down-titration Period, and 
- 57.86% during the Follow-up Period. The median increases from baseline for simple partial seizures 
during the treatment period and Down-titration Period contrast with the median decreases from 
baseline observed for complex partial seizures.

seizure). One subject had a TEAE of seizure which was reported as an SAE and was considered possibly 
related to study drug which led to discontinuation. No subject had a TEAE leading to death. 
The overall pattern of TEAEs reflected not only the known safety profile of ESL, but also the most 
common events occurring in the paediatric population with refractory epilepsy with POS. The most 
common system organ classes in which TEAEs were reported (≥3 subjects) were infections and 
infestations (15 subjects [65.2%]), investigations (7 subjects [30.4%]), nervous system disorders (7 
subjects [30.4%]), gastrointestinal disorders (6 subjects [26.1%]), respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, and blood and lymphatic system disorders both with 3 subjects (13.0%). 
The most common TEAEs (≥3 subjects) by preferred term were bronchitis (5 subjects [21.7%]), 
respiratory tract infection (4 subjects [17.4%]), and respiratory tract infection viral, somnolence, 
pharyngitis, and viral upper respiratory tract infection, all with 3 subjects (13.0%). 
The most common treatment-related TEAE was somnolence, reported in 3 subjects (13.0%). All other 
related TEAEs were reported in single subjects (change in seizure presentation [severity reported as 
moderate], seizure [2 related TEAEs in 1 subject reported as moderate], tremor [moderate], alanine 
aminotransferase increased [mild], electrocardiogram PR prolongation [mild], atrioventricular block 
first degree [mild], overdose [mild], dermatitis allergic [2 TEAEs in 1 subject reported as mild], and 
hyponatraemia [mild].  
Two subjects in the ≤ 20 mg/kg/day dose group had related TEAEs; 1 subject with somnolence and 
electrocardiogram PR prolongation, the other with hyponatraemia. One subject in the > 25 mg/kg/day 
dose group had a related TEAE of alanine aminotransferase increased, and all other related TEAEs were 
reported in the >20 to ≤25 mg/kg/day dose group. 
Four subjects (17.4%) had 1 or more SAEs: 3 subjects (25%) in the ≤20 mg/kg/day dose group and 1 
subject (14.3%) in the>20 to ≤25 mg/kg/day dose group. The 4 subjects had a total of 10 SAEs. The 
most common SAE was seizure, with 3 events reported in 2 subjects (8.7%). All other SAEs were 
reported in single subjects: akathisia, febrile convulsion (2 events in 1 subject), laryngitis, wound 
infection, exposure to toxic agent, and astrocytoma (low grade). Two of the SAEs were considered 
related to study drug: 2 events of seizure reported in the same subject. 
No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in haematology, urinalysis, or vital signs 
(mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, or body weight). One clinically 
significant event of low sodium was reported for 1 subject in the ≤20 mg/kg/day dose group at Visit 1 
(sodium 127 mmol/L, normal range 131- 142 mmol/L). This event was reported as a TEAE of 
hyponatraemia (mild). The subject was excluded from study after Visit 1. 
ESL did not cause a clinically relevant prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) at 
doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day. The mean change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart 
rate using Bazett’s formula (ΔQTcB) values ranged between -17.7 and 19.5 ms. The mean absolute 
change from baseline in QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (ΔQTcF) values 
ranged between -13.8 and 15.5 ms. No subject in any of the dose groups had a change from baseline 
QTcB or QTcF value greater than 60 ms. 
No clinically significant changes were observed in heart rate (HR) or QRS (Time from the onset of the 
Q wave to the end of the S wave) duration in any dose group based on a by-time-point analysis. 
Categorical analysis revealed only few subjects with low heart rate (8 subjects), high PR interval (7 
subjects), and high QRS duration values (4 subjects). Of these, the majority of the observed values 
were close to the threshold value of the age-dependent criteria. 
One subject was reported with a TEAE of PR prolongation and 1 subject with atrioventricular block first 
degree. Both were non-serious, mild, and recovered without any change in the ESL dose. 3 types of

treatment-emergent morphological abnormalities were reported: sinus bradycardia, first degree 
atrioventricular block, and non-specific T wave abnormality. No treatment-emergent U wave changes 
were noted during the study. None of the subjects had arrhythmias like torsades de pointes, 
ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation or flutter, which would suggest a potential pro-
arrhythmic effect. For ECG findings, the proportions of subjects with abnormal ECG findings at 
postbaseline visits were similar to those reported at baseline. Physical and neurological examination 
findings that were normal or abnormal at baseline tended to stay normal or abnormal when evaluated 
at the endpoint visit. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
PK, safety, and tolerability of ESL were characterised in an open-label Phase 2 study (BIA-2093-211) 
of infants from 1 month to <2 years old with refractory epilepsy and POS. No primary or secondary 
objectives were defined for this study. Safety and tolerability were assessed, and efficacy was 
evaluated with exploratory analyses based on the Safety set. All objectives were used to collect long-
term data and were evaluated descriptively.  
The overall pattern of TEAEs reflected not only the known safety profile of ESL, but also the most 
common events occurring in the paediatric population with refractory epilepsy with POS. The 
proportion of subjects with ≥1 TEAE was similar among the 3 dose groups considering the small sample 
size in the analysis, and no indication of a relationship with ESL dose was observed. Most TEAEs were 
assessed as mild or moderate in intensity. No subjects experienced a TEAE leading to death. Four 
subjects had 1 or more serious TEAEs, 1 of which led to discontinuation of study drug, which was 
primarily related to lack of efficacy as the subject’s mother was concerned by her child’s ongoing 
seizures. No clinically meaningful changes over time were observed in parameters for haematology, 
urinalysis, vital signs, ECGs, and physical and neurological examinations. The majority of TEAEs were 
considered unrelated to study drug.  
Comparisons between dose groups are not meaningful because of the small numbers of subjects in 
each dose group. There was a high intra-subject variability in the paediatric population (1 month to 
<2 years) due to major physiological modifications occurring rapidly during the first 2 years of life.  
The most common seizure type reported during the study extension was complex partial, followed by 
partial evolving to secondarily generalised. Substantial reductions from baseline in standardised 
seizure frequency during the treatment period were primarily observed for complex partial and partial 
evolving to secondarily generalised seizure types. 
The median standardised seizure frequency (i.e. median number of seizures per week) decreased for 
all dose groups with the greatest decrease (- 86.01 %) observed in the lowest dose group 
( ≤ 20 mg/kg/day), whereas in the highest dose group (> 25 mg/kg/day) the decrease of seizure 
frequency was - 12.68%. A similar pattern was observed during the Down-titration and Follow-up 
Periods. The reductions in seizure frequencies were similar between male and female subjects.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The relevance of any observed differences between dose groups in safety and efficacy results have to 
be considered in the context of the small sample size, different ESL treatment durations, and being an 
open-label study with no placebo control. Therefore, from the results of the extension of the open-label 
phase 2 study BIA-2093-211 no definite conclusions could be drawn regarding the optimal ESL dose.

In addition, the extension phase of the study does not yield any new efficacy aspects of ESL in 
children. There were also no new safety signals observed, and the safety profile reflected the known 
safety profile for ESL in children > 6 years old and in adults. The MAH does not propose any 
amendment of the product information and this is agreed.

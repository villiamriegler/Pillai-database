1.  Introduction 
On  27  June  2016,  the  MAH  submitted  4  completed paediatric  studies  for  Menveo,  in  accordance  with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults 
at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
Menveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 ml). To ensure optimal antibody levels against all 
vaccine  serogroups,  the  primary  vaccination  schedule  with  Menveo  should  be  completed  one  month 
prior to risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitides groups A, C, W135 and Y. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the following 4 studies: 
•  V102_02:  Phase  2,  Observer  Blinded,  Controlled,  Randomized  Multi-Centre  Study  in 
Adolescents, to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Four Different rMenB plus 
MenACWY Formulations. 
•  V102_02E1: Phase 2, Observer-Blind, Controlled, Randomized, Multi-Centre Extension Study 
to  Evaluate  Safety,  Tolerability  and  Immunogenicity  of  a  Third  Dose  of  One  of  Four  Different 
Formulations  of  rMenB  +  MenACWY  in  Adolescents  Who  Previously  Received  the  Same  Study 
Vaccines. 
•  V102_03:  Phase  2,  Observer  Blinded,  Controlled,  Randomized  Multi-Centre  Study  in 
Adolescents and Young Adults to Evaluate Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Different rMenB

Who Participated in V102_03. 
were conducted as part of the development program of the investigational meningococcal combination 
vaccine  MenABCWY,  intended  to  protect  against  the  five  most  common  Neisseria  meningitides 
serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y) responsible for invasive meningococcal disease worldwide. MenABCWY 
combination vaccine is based upon two established GSK vaccines components, Menveo and Bexsero. 
Assessor’s comment 
Menveo  was  used  in  submitted  studies  as  control  vaccine.  The  study  population  and  single  dose 
administration is conform the currently accepted indication and posology of Menveo.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
In  studies  V102_02,  V102_02E1,  V102_03  and  V102_03E1,  GSK’s  MenACWY  vaccine  (Menveo)  was 
used  with  or  without  addition  of  one  of  the  formulations  of  the  MenB  vaccine.  Menveo    consists  of

powder  and  solution  for  injection  in  vial/vial  presentations.  The  vaccine  is  a  conjugate  vaccine, 
containing  bacterial  capsular  oligosaccharides  for  serogroup  A,  C,  W  and  Y  of  Neisseria  meningitides, 
each separately conjugated to Corynebacterium diphtheriae cross reactive material 197 (CRM-197) – a 
non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin.

Assessor’s comment: 
In this AR, only the methods and data relevant for Menveo (MenACWY) will be discussed.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
In  this  study  MenACWY  vaccine  was  not  included  in  any  of  the  immunogenicity  or  safety  study 
objectives.  However  immunogenicity  and  safety  for  MenACWY  was  analysed,  as  described  below 
(under Outcomes/endpoints).   
Study design 
Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, multicentre study.  
Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion criteria were: Healthy male and female subjects, 11 to 18 years of age at time of enrolment, 
generally  in  good  health,  and  available  for  all  study  visits,  whose  parents/legal  guardians  had  given 
written informed consent at the time of enrolment.  
A total of 495 subjects were enrolled, 83 of which were randomized to Group VI (MenACWY/Placebo). 
Main exclusion criteria were:  
•  Serious, acute, or chronic illnesses.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Previous or suspected disease caused by N meningitidis.  
Previous immunization with any meningococcal vaccine.  
Exposure  to  individuals  with  clinically  proven  meningococcal  disease  or  clinical  bacterial 
meningitis without further microbiologic characterization. 
Pregnancy or nursing (breastfeeding) mothers.  
Treatments 
Subjects  randomized  to  Group  VI  (MenACWY/Placebo)  received  one  dose  of  MenACWY  (final 
quantity/dose: 10 μg MenA, 5 μg MenC, 5 μg MenW, 5 μg MenY) at month 0, and one dose of placebo 
(aluminium  hydroxide:  1,5  mg/dose)  at  month  2  of  the  study.  Total  follow-up  was  3  months  (study 
termination 30 days after the second vaccination).   
Outcomes/endpoints 
Relevant outcomes/endpoints for MenACWY were: 
Immunogenicity: 
One month after vaccination with MenACWY (first vaccination in group MenACWY/Placebo): 
• 
• 
• 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  seroresponse1  against  N.  meningitidis  serogroups  A,  C,  W, 
and Y, respectively. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. 
The geometric mean titres (GMTs) against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

1 Seroresponse to N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y was defined as: 
• 
• 
for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA <1:4, a post-vaccination hSBA ≥1:8 
for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA ≥1:4, an increase in hSBA titre of at least four times 
the pre-vaccination titre. 
Safety: 
During  this  study  solicited,  all  unsolicited  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  concomitant  medications  were 
collected for 7 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs, AE 
leading  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  and  concomitant  medications  used  for  treatment  of 
aforementioned AEs were  collected from day 8 after each vaccination up to next vaccination or to 30 
days after last vaccination. 
Statistical Methods 
The  analyses  of  reactogenicity,  immunogenicity  and  safety  were  descriptive  and  hence  no  statistical 
tests were performed. 
Eighty subjects were to be enrolled in each of the 6 vaccine groups. The sample size has no statistical 
basis  and  has  been  selected  in  order  to  obtain  preliminary  immunogenicity  and  safety  data  after 
vaccination with one of the four investigational formulations of MenB (±OMV) + MenACWY (group I, II, 
III and IV). 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The first subject first visit (Visit 1) was on 20 December 2010. The last study visit (Visit 4) for the last 
subject took place on 27 July 2011. 
A  total  of  495  subjects  were  enrolled  at  11  centres  in  three  countries  and  494  subjects  received  at 
least one dose of the study vaccines. 
Of the 495 subjects who were enrolled in the study, 485 subjects completed the study up to Visit 4. 
For  group  VI  (MenACWY/placebo),  all  83  enrolled  subjects  completed  the  study.  Of  these,  all  83 
subjects  were  included  in  the  MITT  population,  81  subjects  were  included  in  the  “PP  population  –  1 
month after the first vaccination”, and 82 subjects were included in the “PP population – 1 month after 
the second vaccination”.  
Reasons  for  exclusion  of  the  PP  population  were  randomization  error  (n=1)  and  blood draw  done  but 
inappropriate clotting duration (n=1).  
Baseline data 
The  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  across  the  different  vaccination 
groups.  The  majority  of  the  subjects  were  Hispanic  (72%  to  76%).  Gender  distributions  were  similar 
across  the  vaccination  groups  (male  41%-54%  and  female  46%-59%).  Age,  height  and  weight  were 
similar across the vaccination groups. 
Immunogenicity results 
One month after vaccination with MenACWY (first vaccination in group MenACWY/Placebo):

• 
• 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  seroresponse  were  86%,  68%,  60%  and  78%  against  N. 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y 
were 88%, 84%, 98% and 100%. 
•  Against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y the geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 105 
(geometric  mean  ratio  1  month  postvaccination  to  prevaccination  [GMR]  77),  59  (GMR  15), 
188 (GMR 10) and 77 (GMR 15), respectively. 
Of note, one month after the first vaccination, the percentage of subjects with seroresponse in Groups 
I, II, III, IV (MenABCWY groups) for N. meningitidis serogroups were: A (75%- 86%), C (61%-79%), 
W (56%-67%) and Y (77%-82%) which were generally comparable to those in Group VI (MenACWY; 
86%, 68%, 60% and 78%, respectively). In Group V (MenB), the percentages were 26%, 3%, 7% and 
3% against the serogroups A, C, W and Y, respectively.  
Similar results were obtained when the data was analysed based on the percentages of subjects with 
hSBA ≥1:8 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.  
One  month  after  the  first  vaccination,  in  Groups  I,  II,  III,  IV  (ABCWY  groups)  the  GMTs  ranged  as 
follows: serogroups A (41-73, GMR 32-55), C (54-82, GMR 12-20), W (143- 204; GMR 7.8-12) and Y 
(67-77; GMR 16-18). In Group VI (MenACWY) the GMTs were 105 (GMR 77), 59 (GMR 15), 188 (GMR 
10) and 77 (GMR 15) against the respective serogroups.  
Assessor’s comment: 
Seroresponse (defined as a post-vaccination hSBA ≥1:8 for subjects with a pre-vaccination hSBA <1:4; 
or  an  increase  in  hSBA  titre  of  at  least  four  times  the  pre-vaccination  titre  for  subjects  with  a  pre-
vaccination  hSBA  ≥1:4)  was  lower  in  subjects  with  a  pre-vaccination  hSBA  ≥1:4  vs  in  subjects  with  a 
pre-vaccination  hSBA  <1:4  for  all  serogroups.  Overall,  the  immunogenicity  results  are  in  line  with 
those  reported  in  the  initial  MAA  studies  in  adolescents.  Based  on  the  results  described  above, 
inclusion  of  an  additional  rMenB  formulation  did  not  seem  to  substantially  influence  the  response 
against the serogroups A, C, W and Y.

Extension Study V102_02E1 
Study  V102_02E1  was  an  observer-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  controlled,  extension  study  in 
healthy  adolescents  who  participated  in  the  parent  study  V102_02.  This  study  was  designed  to 
evaluate  safety,  tolerability  and  immunogenicity  of  a  third  dose  at  month  6  (6  months  following  the 
first  vaccination  in  the  parent  study)  of  one  of  four  different  formulations  of  MenABCWY  vaccine  or 
rMenB  vaccine  in  subjects  who  previously  received  two  doses of  the  same  study  vaccines  (for  details 
see description of study groups in parent study V102_02). Subjects previously allocated to groups I–V 
of  the  parent  study  were  randomized  in  a  1:2  ratio  to  receive  in  this  extension  study  either  a  third 
dose of the same vaccine as in the parent study or a dose of tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis 
vaccine  (Tdap),  respectively.  The  subjects  previously  randomized  to  group  VI  in  the  parent  study 
(subjects  received  MenACWY  and  placebo  in  the  parent  study)  received  only  Tdap  in  this  extension 
study. The study was conducted in Panama, Columbia and Chile.  
A total of 440 subjects were enrolled and randomized. In Group VI (1 dose of MenACWY), 73 subjects 
were enrolled and received study vaccination and 72 subjects completed the extension study following 
the protocol.  
The percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y at 6, 7, 
and 12 months after vaccination with MenACWY in parent study V102_02 is reported below: 
•  Six months after administration of MenACWY vaccine in study V102_02, 55%, 76%, 97%, and 
85%  of  subjects  had  hSBA  ≥ 1:8  against  N.  meningitidis  serogroups  A,  C,  W,  and  Y, 
respectively. 
•  Seven months after vaccination, 58%, 68%, 96%, and 85% of subjects had hSBA ≥1:8 against 
N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. 
• 
Twelve  months  after  vaccination,  55%,  60%,  90%,  and  80%  of  subjects  had  hSBA  ≥ 1:8 
against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. 
Antibody persistence as measured by the hSBA GMTs against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W and Y 
showed the following results: 
•  Six months after administration of MenACWY vaccine in study V102_02, the GMTs were 20, 23, 
117 and 84 against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. 
•  Seven  months  after  vaccination  the  GMTs  were  21,  18,  121  and  75  against  N.  meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. 
• 
Twelve  months  after  vaccination  the  GMTs  were  14,  14,  75  and  47  against  N.  meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively. 
The figures below depict the Reverse Cumulative Distribution Function (RCDF) of hSBA titres 7 months 
after  vaccination  against  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y  –  MITT.  In  each  of  the  panels,  the  yellow  curve 
corresponds to data of subjects who received 1 dose of MenACWY.

Assessor’s comment: 
Of  relevance  to  determine  antibody  persistence  after  a  single  MenACWY  dose  is  the  yellow  curve  in 
each  of  the  panels  (1ACWY  group).  The  other  vaccine  groups  received  either  one  or  two  additional

vaccinations  (at  2  and  6  months  after  the  first  vaccination)  and  have  had  their  last  vaccination  5 
months or 1 month ago. Twelve month data was not visualized, but GMTs were described to be 14, 14, 
75 and 47 for serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively in the 1ACWY group.  
It  is  known  that  waning  of  the  immune  response  occurs  especially  during  the  first  months  after 
vaccination with MenACWY (in particular for MenA) after which it more or less stabilises. As such, the 
presented results can be considered to be in line with expectations. It does however seem that waning 
of the MenC response in the current study is (slightly) faster than previously observed. 
Safety results 
The  frequencies  of  solicited  AEs  after  vaccination  with  MenACWY  were  68%,  60%,  and  55%  for  any, 
local,  and  systemic  solicited  AEs,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  local  solicited  AE  was 
injection-site  pain,  reported  in  50%  of  subjects  after  vaccination  with  MenACWY;  in  9%  of  subjects, 
pain  was  graded  as  severe.  The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AEs  were  headache  and 
myalgia  reported  in  41%,  and  38%  of  subjects,  respectively  and  in  9%,  and  7%  of  subjects, 
respectively, they were graded as severe. Rash was reported in 4 (5%) subjects after vaccination with 
MenACWY, in 2 subjects it was graded as urticarial. In this study rash was additionally assessed by an 
external expert. In 3 subjects the rash was local and in 1 subject it had a local extension (on the left 
wrist).  According  judgement  of  the  external  expert  in  none  of  these  subjects  rash  was  caused  by  a 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  safety  profile  observed  in  the  newly  submitted  studies  is  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
Menveo,  no  new  safety  signals  were  identified.  It  is  noted  that  the  fraction  of  subjects  reporting 
(severe) AEs seems higher than observed in the initial MAA studies, but due to the small sample size, 
no conclusions should be drawn.  
V102_03:  Phase  2,  Observer  Blinded, Controlled,  Randomized  Multi-Centre 
Study 
in  Adolescents  and  Young  Adults  to  Evaluate  Safety  and 
Immunogenicity  of  Two  Different  rMenB  with  OMV  +  MenACWY 
Combination Vaccination Formulations 
Description 
This was a phase 2, observer-blinded, controlled, randomized (1:1:1:1), multicentre study in healthy 
adolescents and young adults aged 10 through 25 years to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 
2 different formulations of MenABCWY vaccine. The  study was conducted at 13 sites (8 in the United 
States and 5 in  Poland).  MenACWY  was  used as a  control vaccine. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 
the 4 vaccination groups described below: 
•  Study  group  ABCWY+OMV  received  the  MenABCWY+OMV  vaccine  formulation  (containing  a 
‘full dose’ of OMV) on a 0, 2-month schedule. 
•  Study group ABCWY+qOMV received the MenABCWY+qOMV vaccine formulation (containing a 
‘quarter dose’ of OMV) on a 0, 2-month schedule. 
•  Study group rMenB+OMV received the rMenB+OMV vaccine (containing a ‘full dose’ of OMV) on 
a 0, 2-month schedule.

•  Study  group  Placebo/MenACWY  received  a  single  dose  of  placebo  and  a  single  dose  of 
MenACWY vaccine, respectively, on a 0, 2-month schedule. 
Assessor’s comment: 
As for study V102_02, only the methods and data relevant for Menveo (MenACWY) will be discussed in 
this AR.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary immunogenicity objective: 
• 
To  demonstrate  immunologic  non-inferiority  of  2  doses  of  2  different  formulations  of 
MenABCWY  vaccine  to  a  single  dose of  MenACWY  vaccine,  as  measured  by  the  percentage of 
subjects  with  high-throughput  assay  for  human  serum  bactericidal  activity  (HT-hSBA) 
seroresponse  against  N. meningitidis  serogroups  A,  C,  W,  and  Y,  at  30  days  after  the  second 
vaccination, in healthy adolescents and young adults aged 10 through 25 years. 
Secondary immunogenicity objective: 
• 
To  compare  the  immunogenicity  of  2  doses  of  2  different  formulations  of  MenABCWY  vaccine 
with  that  of  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY  vaccine,  as  measured  by  the  percentage  of  subjects 
with HT-hSBA ≥ 1:8 and HT-hSBA GMTs against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y, at 
30 days after the second vaccination.   
No  safety  objective  was  defined  for  the  control  vaccine  MenACWY,  however  results  for  solicited  and 
unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were analysed and summarized. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  MAH  has  chosen  as  primary  immunogenicity  objective  to  demonstrate  immunologic  non-
inferiority  of  2  doses  of  2  different  formulations  of  MenABCWY  vaccine  to  a  single  dose  of 
MenACWY vaccine. As outlined below (Statistical Methods), the non-inferiority of MenABCWY+OMV to 
MenACWY was tested first (4 hypotheses). Following confirmation of non-inferiority, the non-inferiority 
of MenABCWY+qOMV (4 hypotheses) was tested. The trial would be considered successful only if all 8 
null hypotheses were rejected simultaneously.    
Study design 
Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, multicentre study.  
Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion criteria were: Healthy male and female subjects, 10 to 25 years of age at time of enrolment, 
generally  in  good  health,  and  available  for  all  study  visits,  who  had  given  their  written  informed 
consent or assent (as applicable) at the time of enrolment, and, if the subject was under age 18 at the 
time of enrolment, the legal parent/guardian of the subject had given their written consent on behalf of

Main exclusion criteria were:  
•  Serious, acute, or chronic illnesses.  
•  Current or previous, confirmed or suspected, disease caused by N meningitidis.  
• 
• 
• 
Previous immunization with any meningococcal vaccine.  
Exposure  to  individuals  with  clinically  proven  meningococcal  disease  or  clinical  bacterial 
meningitis without further microbiologic characterization. 
Pregnancy or nursing (breastfeeding) mothers.  
Treatments 
Study  group  Placebo/MenACWY  received  one  dose  of  saline  placebo  at  month  0  and  one  dose  of 
MenACWY  (final  quantity/dose:  10  μg  MenA,  5  μg  MenC,  5  μg  MenW,  5  μg  MenY)  at  month  2  of  the 
study. Total follow-up was 241 days (study termination 180 days after the second vaccination).   
Outcomes/endpoints 
Relevant outcomes/endpoints for MenACWY were: 
Immunogenicity: 
• 
Percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse  at  day  30  after  the  second  vaccination. 
Seroresponse to N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y is defined as: 
- For subjects with a prevaccination hSBA < 1:4, a postvaccination hSBA ≥ 1:8; 
- For subjects with a prevaccination hSBA ≥ 1:4, an increase in hSBA titre of at least 4 times 
the prevaccination titre.  
• 
• 
Percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 to N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. 
hSBA  GMTs  for  N.  meningitidis  serogroups  A,  C,  W-135,  and  Y,  and  pre-  to  postvaccination 
geometric mean ratios (GMRs). 
High-throughput assays for serum bactericidal activity using human complement (HT-hSBA) were used 
for N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y and serogroup B test strains.  
Safety: 
No  safety  objective  was  defined  for  the  control  vaccine  MenACWY,  however  results  for  solicited  and 
unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected as follows. 
During  this  study  solicited  AEs  were  collected  for  7  days  after  each  vaccination.  From  day  8  through 
day 91 all unsolicited AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) and concomitant medications were collected; 
from day 92 through day 241 (i.e., 180 days following the second vaccination) only medically attended 
AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal from the study were collected. 
Statistical Methods 
The null hypothesis associated with the primary immunogenicity objective was based on non-inferiority 
of 2 doses of 2 different formulations of MenABCWY vaccine to a single dose of MenACWY (Menveo), as 
measured  by  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  hSBA  seroresponse  directed  against  N.  meningitidis 
serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, at 30 days after the second vaccination. 
The number and percentage of subjects with hSBA seroresponse and associated 2-sided 95% Clopper-
Pearson  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  computed  for  each  N.  meningitides  serogroup  A,  C,  W-135, 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

and  Y  at  30  days  after  the  second  vaccination.  For  constructing  2-sided  95%  CIs  for  the  difference 
between  the  ABCWY  and  Placebo/ACWY  groups  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  seroresponse,  the 
usual normal approximation was not considered to be appropriate because these proportions could be 
close  to  1.  Therefore,  the  associated  CIs  (for  the  differences  in  percentage  of  subjects  with 
seroresponse)  were  constructed  using  the  method  of  Miettinen  and  Nurminen  (known  as  the  MN 
method [Miettinen and Nurminen, 1985]). 
The  immune  response  to  2  doses  of  MenABCWY  vaccine  was  considered  noninferior  to  the  immune 
response  to  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI) 
around  the  difference  between  the  study  groups  (ABCWY –  Placebo/ACWY)  in  percentage  of  subjects 
with seroresponse between the vaccination groups was greater than -10% for each serogroup. 
The 8 non-inferiority hypotheses underlying the first primary objective were tested as follows: the non-
inferiority of MenABCWY+OMV to MenACWY was tested first (4 hypotheses); following confirmation of 
non-inferiority, the non-inferiority of MenABCWY+qOMV (4 hypotheses) was tested. 
Novartis  Vaccines  and  Diagnostics  would  consider  this  trial  successful  if  all  8  null  hypotheses  were 
rejected  simultaneously,  confirming 
the 
immunological  non-inferiority  of  2  doses  of 
the 
MenABCWY+OMV and of the MenABCWY+qOMV formulations to a single dose of MenACWY at 30 days 
after the second vaccination. 
All  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  vaccination  and  provided  any  safety  data  were  to  be  considered 
evaluable for the safety analyses. All safety data were evaluated using descriptive statistics only. 
Sample size determination was based on the assumption that the subjects in the study V102_03 would 
have  antibody  responses  similar  to  those  in  earlier  studies  V59P18  and  V59P13  (part  of  the  clinical 
dossier submitted for Menveo), and there would be no negative influence of combining MenACWY and 
rMenB on these responses, with N=110 evaluable subjects (i.e., N=120 minus about 8% dropout rate), 
the  non-inferiority  criteria  for  each  of  the  4  serogroups  is  satisfied  with  the  power  98.6%,  99%, 
96.4%, and 99% according to responses similar to those in V59P18 and 99.9% for all strains assuming 
responses similar to those observed in V59P13. 
Assuming that the results for the 4 serogroups are independent, the overall power for 8 non-inferiority 
ACWY  criteria  equals  86.8%  assuming  responses  similar  to  V59P18,  and  92.3%  assuming  responses 
similar to V59P13. Calculations were to be done using Nquery. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The first subject first visit (Visit 1) was on 8 August 2011. The last study visit for the last subject took 
place on 11 September 2012. 
A total of 480 subjects were planned for this study, with 120 subjects in each of the 4 study groups. 
The actual number of subjects enrolled was 484; of these, a total of 480 subjects received at least one 
vaccination and were analysed. 
For study group Placebo/MenACWY, 107/121 (88.4%) enrolled subjects completed the study. Of these, 
105  (87%)  subjects  were  included  in  the  full  analysis  set  for  immunogenicity  (FASi)  population,  76 
(63%) subjects were included in the per-protocol set for immunogenicity (PPSi) population.  
At    one  site  in  Poland,  11  subjects  randomized  to  the  Placebo/MenACWY  group  were  vaccinated  with 
the correct vaccines but in the wrong order, that is, the first vaccination was with MenACWY and the 
second with placebo. Their data were excluded from the PPSi and desirability, and from the Unsolicited 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Safety  Set,  both  Solicited  Safety  Sets  (applicable  to  the  first  and  second  vaccinations),  and  the 
Restricted Safety Set.  
Assessor’s comment: 
It is noted that a substantial number of subjects were excluded from one or more analysis sets due to 
protocol deviations.  Excluding  the  above  mentioned  vaccination  error  at  one of  the  Polish  sites,  main 
reasons for exclusion were: subject did not comply with the protocol-specified window for the second 
study vaccination (N=37 overall), subject received a vaccine forbidden by the protocol (N=13 overall), 
and  subject  provided  the  visit  3  (day  91)  blood  sample  outside  the  protocol-specified  window  (N=15 
overall). As a result, only 343 subjects (90 in the ABCWY+OMV group, 85 in the ABCWY+qOMV group, 
92 in the rMenB+OMV group, and 76 in the Placebo/ACWY group) were included in the PPSi.  
Baseline data 
Demographic  characteristics  were  comparable  across  study  groups.  The  median  age  was  13  years 
overall;  the  minimum  age  in  each  group  was  10  years,  and  the  maximum  was  24  or  25  years. 
Approximately half of subjects were male (44% to 51% across groups). Median weights were 56 to 57 
kg  across  study  groups.  Ethnicity  was  also  comparable  across  groups:  61%  of  all  subjects  were 
Caucasian, 32% were Hispanic, 5% were Black, and the remainder were Asian or of other ethnicities. 
Approximately one-fourth of subjects were from Poland, with the remainder from the US.  
Immunogenicity results 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  seroresponse  against  all  4  serogroups  at  30  days  after  the  second 
vaccination in the Placebo/MenACWY group (i.e., one vaccination of MenACWY) were analysed as part 
of the primary objective. The percentages of subjects with seroresponse against serogroups A, C,  W, 
and Y were 73%, 63%, 65%, and 75% of subjects, respectively. 
Immunological non-inferiority of 2 doses of the MenABCWY+OMV formulation vs. a single dose of the 
MenACWY vaccine was demonstrated for all 4 serogroups: the lower limits of the 2-sided 95% CI  for 
the  differences,  in  percentage  of  subjects  with  seroresponse,  between  study  groups  were  5%,  21%, 
0%,  and  5%  for  serogroups  A,  C,  W-135,  and  Y,  respectively,  thereby  satisfying  the  noninferiority 
criterion (lower limit of the 95% CI was > –10%).  
The immune responses against serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y were statistically higher after 2 doses of 
each of the MenABCWY formulations than after a single dose of the ACWY vaccine, i.e., the lower limits 
of  the  2-sided  95%  CIs  for  the  difference  between  study  groups  were  greater  than  0%,  except  for 
serogroup W-135 in the ABCWY+OMV group. 
The  following  immunogenicity  results  for  MenACWY  (Placebo/MenACWY  group)  were  analysed  as  part 
of the secondary objectives: 
•  Across all study groups, low percentages of subjects had baseline hSBA ≥ 1:8 to serogroups A 
and Y (1% to 8% and 8% to 18%, respectively), while 32% to 37% of subjects across groups 
had such baseline hSBA levels to serogroup C and 51% to 66% of subjects had baseline hSBA 
≥1:8 to serogroup W-135.  
•  At  30  days  after  the  second  vaccination  the  percentages  of  subjects  who  achieved  HThSBA  ≥ 
1:8 in the Placebo/MenACWY group were 73%, 83%, 89% and 82% against serogroups A, C, 
W  and  Y,  respectively.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  ≥  1:8  at  30  days  after  the 
second  vaccination  in  the  ABCWY+OMV  and  ABCWY+qOMV  groups  were:  93%  and  95%

against  serogroup  A,  respectively,  99%  and  100%  against  serogroup  C,  respectively,  and 
100% against serogroup W-135 and 97% against serogroup Y in both study groups. 
•  At  30  days  after  the  second  vaccination  in  the  Placebo/MenACWY  group,  HT-hSBA  GMTs 
against serogroup A, C, W, and Y were 45, 55, 65, and 46, respectively. At 30 days after the 
second  vaccination,  hSBA  GMTs  against  serogroup  A  in  the  ABCWY+OMV  and  ABCWY+qOMV 
groups were 71 and 77, 214 and 187 against serogroup C, 239 and 288 against serogroup W-
135, and 149 and 129 against serogroup Y. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  immunogenicity  results  are  as  could  be  expected,  e.g.  higher  after  2  doses  of  either  one  of  the 
MenABCWY  vaccines  than  after  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY.  The  results  of  study  group 
Placebo/MenACWY,  albeit  not  directly  comparable  due  to  the  different  assay  used  (High-throughput 
assay),  seem  to  be  in  line  with  those  reported  in  the  initial  MAA  studies  in  subjects  10  through  25 
years of age. A separate analysis for adolescents was not provided, but considering the overall mean 
age was 13 years and all  subjects were ≤25 years of age, it is not expected to be different from the 
overall results.  
Extension Study V102_03E1 
Study  V102_03E1  was  a  phase  2,  observer-blinded,  placebo-controlled,  randomized,  multicentre 
extension  study  in  healthy  adolescents  and  young  adults  that  participated  in  the  parent  study 
V102_03. The parent study groups were further randomized to receive either one dose of the different 
MenABCWY vaccine formulations under study or a dose of placebo approximately 24 months after the 
last vaccination was completed in the V102_03 study. The study was conducted in the US and Poland. 
A  total  of  194  subjects  were  enrolled  and  randomly  assigned  to  study  groups  based  on  the  vaccine 
received in the parent study. Study group Placebo/MenACWY was further randomized to 3 groups in a 
1:1:1  ratio;  one  group  received  MenABCWY  +  full  dose  of  OMV,  the  second  group  received 
MenABCWY+ ¼ dose of OMV and the third group received placebo. These groups were designated as 
1M_OMV, 1M_qOMV and 1M_Pbo respectively. 
In  study  group  Placebo/ACWY,  120  subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled,  40  in  each  of  the  three 
subgroups. 59 subjects were actually enrolled and received the allocated vaccinations and 57 subjects 
completed the protocol. A total of 19 subjects received placebo (study group 1M_Pbo) and 18 subjects 
in this study group completed protocol. 
On this  study only MenABCWY  formulations and placebo were given in this study, but not MenACWY. 
For  this  reason  only  antibody  persistence  24  months  after  vaccination  in  study  V102_03  (only  group 
Placebo/ACWY of study V102_03) on study day 1 before vaccination in study V102_03E1 and antibody 
persistence  36  months  after  vaccination  in  study  V102_03  (only  for  study  group  1M_Pbo  of  study 
V102_03E1) are relevant for immunogenicity of MenACWY. 
All  subjects  received  the  study  vaccination  on  day  1  (−60/+150  days)  of  this  extension  study  ie, 
approximately 24 months after last primary vaccination. All subjects in the extension study were to be 
followed for safety and immunogenicity for approximately 12 months after the study vaccination.  
The  following  immunogenicity  results  for  MenACWY  vaccine  were  analysed  as  part  of  the  secondary 
objective: Persistence After Primary Vaccination Against Serogroups A, C, W and Y 
HT-hSBA Titers ≥ 1:8

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Page 16/27 
 
 
 
•  Group  placebo/ACWY:  At  24  months  after  primary  vaccination,  percentages  of  subjects  with 
HT-hSBA ≥ 1:8 were 31% of subjects against serogroup A, 57% of subjects against serogroup 
C, 68% of subjects against serogroup W, and 46% of subjects against serogroup Y. 
•  Group 1M_Pbo: At 36 months after primary vaccination percentages of subjects with HT-hSBA 
≥ 1:8 were 35% of subjects against serogroup A, 65% of subjects against serogroup C, 65% of 
subjects against serogroup W, and 47% of subjects against serogroup Y. 
HT-hSBA GMTs 
•  Group  placebo/ACWY:  At  24  months  after  primary  vaccination,  the  GMTs  were  4.14  for 
serogroup A, 10 for serogroup C, 17 for serogroup W, and 6.49 for serogroup Y. 
•  Group 1M_Pbo: At 36 months after primary vaccination the GMTs were 3.54 for serogroup A, 
24 for serogroup C, 16 for serogroup W, and 9.56 for serogroup Y. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Trends  in  antibody  persistence  for  serogroups  W  and  Y  appear  lower  than  previously  generated 
persistence data (study V59P13E1, V59P6E1). After clarifications were requested, the MAH pointed out 
that  small  numbers  in  V102_03E1  make  it  difficult  to  draw  firm  conclusions;  the  confidence  intervals 
provide  some  measure  of  uncertainty,  and  these  overlap  between  studies.  Secondly,  in  study 
V102_03E1 a high-throughput [HT]-SBA was used  – unlike in previous studies.  It is agreed with the 
MAH  that  results  obtained  using  different  assays,  which  have  different  sensitivity  aspects,  cannot  be 
directly compared. 
Safety results 
The  frequencies  of  solicited  AEs  after  vaccination  with  MenACWY  were  63%,  53%,  and  46%  for  any, 
local,  and  systemic  solicited  AEs,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported  local  solicited  AE  was 
injection-site  pain,  reported  in  42%  of  subjects  after  vaccination  with  MenACWY;  in  8%  of  subjects, 
pain  was  graded  as  severe.  The  most  frequently  reported  systemic  solicited  AEs  were  myalgia, 
headache and fatigue reported in 25%, 23%, and 20% of subjects, respectively and in 4%, 3%, and 
2% of subjects, respectively, they were graded as severe. 
Unsolicited AEs were reported in 7% of subjects within 30 days (day 61 through 91) after vaccination 
with  MenACWY,  in  1  subject  (1%  of  subjects)  the  AE  (injection  site  erythema)  was  judged  by 
investigator  as  at  least  possibly  related.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  at  least  possibly  related 
unsolicited  AEs  reported  during  the  entire  study  period  (days  1  through  241)  was  6%  in  the 
Placebo/MenACWY  group,  all  of  them  were  reported  in  the  period  from  day  1  through  day  91. 
Injection-site pain was the only AE in this group which was reported in more than 1% of subjects (i.e., 
in 2% of subject). 
In  study  group  Placebo/MenACWY,  28%  of  subjects  reported  medically  attended  AEs  from  day  92 
through  day  241  and  3%  of  subjects  reported  serious  AEs  (SAEs)  throughout  the  complete  study 
period  (from  day  1  through  day  241),  none  of  these  AEs  were  judged  by  investigator  as  at  least 
possibly related. No AE in this group led to premature withdrawal of subjects, no subject died. 
A  total  of  7  different  events  of  New  Onset  of  Chronic  Disease  (NOCDs)  were  reported  in  group 
Placebo/ACWY since completion of the parent study V102_03 up to day 1 in study V102_03E1. Obesity 
was  reported  by  2  subjects.  Myopia,  chronic  sinusitis,  scoliosis,  asthma,  rhinitis  allergic,  and 
hypertension were reported each by 1 subject.

Assessor’s comment: 
Again,  the  fraction  of  subjects  reporting  (severe)  AEs  seems  higher  than  observed  in  the  initial  MAA 
studies, but due to the small sample size, no conclusions should be drawn. Overall, the safety profile 
observed is in line with the known safety profile of Menveo, and no new safety signals were identified. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  MAH  submitted  4  studies  conducted  as  part  of  the  development  program  of  the  investigational 
meningococcal  combination  vaccine  MenABCWY,  intended  to  protect  against  the  five  most  common 
Neisseria  meningitides  serogroups  (A,  B,  C,  W  and  Y)  responsible  for  invasive  meningococcal  disease 
worldwide. MenABCWY combination vaccine is based upon two established GSK vaccines components, 
Menveo and Bexsero. 
Menveo  was  used  in  those  studies  as  control  vaccine.  The  study  population  and  single  dose 
administration  was  conform  the  currently  accepted  indication  and  posology  of  Menveo.  The 
immunogenicity  after  vaccination  was  determined  with  the  hSBA  assay  (standard  assay  in  studies 
V102_02+E1,  high  throughput  (HT)  assay  in  V102_03+E1).    Due  to  the  HT-assay  used  in  V102_03, 
the results from this study might not be directly comparable to earlier results, although they seem to 
be in line. No correlation between the two assays in a single study was provided. 
Immunogenicity  results  against  the  serogroups  A,  C,  W  and  Y  in  subjects  vaccinated  with  Menveo  in 
these studies are in line with those reported in the initial MAA studies in adolescents and young adults. 
Upon  request  the  MAH  provided  an  overview  of  all  available  persistence  data  since  marketing 
authorisation for serogroups A, C, W and Y, and placed the findings of particularly study V102_03E1 in 
perspective of these findings.  
The  overview  provided  by  the  MAH  did  not  provide many  new  insights.  Currently,  the  SmPC  includes 
persistence data up to 5 years after vaccination in adolescents, children aged 2-10 years. From these 
data,  it  can  be  deducted  that  persistence  is  poorer  in  younger  children.  The  data  in  the  SmPC  stem 
from studies V59P13E1 and V59P20E1. Follow up in study V59P22E1 is poor and the data does not add 
to  what  is  already  described.  The  findings  of  study  V59P6E1  are  in  line  with  data  already  described. 
The  discrepancies  between  the  hSBA  and  rSBA  have  discussed  in  earlier  assessments.  Study  V59_67 
falls outside the indication.  
In  the  2  extension  studies,  antibody  persistence  was  evaluated  at  6  months,  7  months  and  1  year 
(study  V102_02E1),  or  at  2  and  3  years  (study  V102_03E1)  after  vaccination  with  MenACWY.  As 
expected, there was a substantial decrease in hSBA GMTs 6 months to 1 year (study V102_02E1) and 
HT-hSBA GMTs (study V102_03E1) 2 and 3 years after vaccination. Although substantial waning of the 
immune response is known, especially for MenA, the decreases observed in the present studies seem 
to be larger than expected based on results from study V59P13E1. Therefore, the MAH is requested to:  
a) provide an overview of all available persistence data since marketing authorisation for serogroups A, 
C, W and Y, and  
b) put the results generated in the studies described in the current report in perspective, based upon 
the provided overview of all available persistence data. 
The safety data did not raise any unforeseen safety issue.  
Overall the results of the 4 studies do not alter the benefit-risk profile of MenACWY vaccine. 
The  MAH  has  reviewed  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  results  following  MenACWY  vaccine 
administration as control vaccine in studies V102_02, V102_02E1, V102_03, and V102_03E1 and has

concluded  that  they  are  in  line  with  the  current  safety  and  product  information  of  MenACWY. 
Therefore,  no  changes  to  the  considered  current  SmPC  of  MenACWY  are  necessary.  This  is  agreed, 
provided  that  the  additional  requested  overview  of  available  persistence  data  does  not  warrant  an 
update of the currently approved SmPC.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled:  
The immunogenicity and safety findings following MenACWY vaccine administration as control vaccine 
in studies V102_02, V102_02E1, V102_03, and V102_03E1 are in line with what is known and 
described in the product information of MenACWY. These findings do not alter the Benefit/Risk and no 
changes to the current labelling of MenACWY is necessary based on these findings. 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH is requested to:  
a) provide an overview of all available persistence data since marketing authorisation for 
serogroups A, C, W and Y, and  
b) put the results generated in the studies described in the current report in perspective, based 
upon the provided overview of all available persistence data. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Although substantial waning of the immune response is known, especially for MenA, the decreases 
observed in the present studies seem to be larger than expected based on results from study 
V59P13E1. Therefore, the MAH is requested to:  
a) provide an overview of all available persistence data since marketing authorisation for serogroups A, 
C, W and Y, and  
b) put the results generated in the studies described in the current report in perspective, based upon 
the provided overview of all available persistence data.

Persistence of bactericidal antibodies after administration of 1 or more doses of MenACWY has been 
examined in 10 clinical studies, across age groups, during the clinical development of MenACWY. An 
overview of these 10 studies is provided in Table 1.

Persistence data from studies V59P6, V59P13E1, V59_57, V59P20E1, V59P22, V59P14, and V59P14E1 
An overview of antibody persistence after Menveo vaccination across age groups is presented by 
Baxter et al. [Baxter 2016] including data from studies V59P6, V59P13E1, V59_57, V59P20E1, 
V59P22, V59P14, and V59P14E1. Persisting antibody titres were assessed using the serum bactericidal 
assay with human (all studies) and rabbit (V59P6, V59P13E1, and V59P14E1 only) complement (hSBA 
and rSBA, respectively; Table 1). In summary, primary vaccination with MenACWY (one or more doses, 
depending on age) induced a robust immune response across age groups, which was maintained to a 
considerable degree for up to 5 years. In adolescents and children, a single dose of MenACWY (or 2 
doses in children ≤ 5 years) induced high antibody titres immediately post-vaccination (percentages of 
subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 at 1 month post-vaccination ranging from 69% to 96% across 
serogroups, age groups, and studies), with an age- and serogroup-specific decline up to 1 year (range: 
11% to 95%), followed by relatively stable levels up to 5 years post-vaccination (range: 14% to 82%). 
In infants and toddlers, MenACWY was administered as a multi-dose regimen and results in moderate 
to high antibody persistence across serogroups (percentages of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 at 6 or 7 
months after vaccination ranging from 12% to 75% across serogroups and age groups, and from 6% 
to 85% across serogroups at 40 and 60 months of age).

Antibody persistence after priming in infants and toddlers also appeared to be impacted by maturity of 
the immune system at time of priming, as evidenced by better persistence after a 2-dose primary 
series in the second year of life than after a 4-dose primary series given to infants. Across age groups, 
the degree of persistence of antibodies was serogroup-specific, with generally high antibody titres up 
to 5 years for serogroups W and Y, while persistence of antibodies is moderate against serogroup C, 
and lowest against serogroup A, as measured using hSBA. Interestingly, this trend was not seen when 
assessed using a different assay method using rabbit complement, (in adolescents, percentages of 
subjects with rSBA titres ≥ 8 at 21 months and 3 years after a single vaccination were still 96% to 
99%, compared with 37% to 40% of subjects hSBA titres ≥ 8 at the same timepoints), while antibody 
titres against the other serogroups were relatively comparable between the 2 assay methods. These 
observations suggest that the decline of antibodies against serogroup A over time seen with hSBA may 
be an assay-specific finding and may underestimate the true protection against meningococcal disease 
following MenACWY vaccination.

Persistence data from study V59P6E1 
Study V59P6E1 [Jacobson 2013] assessed antibody persistence at approximately 5 years after a single 
primary vaccination with MenACWY at 11 to 17 years of age. Antibody persistence was assessed using 
both hSBA and rSBA (Table 1). Primary vaccination with MenACWY provided a broad and persistent 
immune response in adolescents. Five years after primary vaccination with MenACWY, the percentages 
of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 ranged from 72% to 76% for serogroups C, W, and Y, while for 
serogroup A the percentage was 30%. In line with what was described by GSK Vaccines Baxter et al. 
(see above), the same trend for serogroup A was not seen when assessed using rSBA (percentages of 
subjects with rSBA titres ≥ 8 ranging from 78% to 98% across serogroups). 
Persistence data from study V59P22E1  
Study V59P22E1 assessed antibody persistence at approximately 13-33 months after primary 
vaccination with 2 doses (at 6-8 and 12 months of age; Group 1) or 1 dose (at 12 months of age; 
Group 2) of MenACWY, or with 1 dose (at 12 months of age; Group 3) of the monovalent conjugate 
MenC vaccine. Persistence was summarized by time period since the last vaccination in the parent

study, V59P22 (time intervals of ≤ 23 months, 24 to 31 months, and ≥ 32 months; Table 2). 
Percentages of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 directed against serogroups C, W, and Y were higher than 
those for serogroup A in all the study groups (excluding A, W and Y serogroups in group 3 as these 
represent background activity; Table 2). These results suggest that antibodies to serogroups C, W, and 
Y are able to persist long-term, with 14% to 55% of subjects having hSBA titres ≥ 8 at 24 to 31 
months after one or two doses of MenACWY. These data are in line with previously observed trends in 
antibody persistence; however, the results should be interpreted with caution as numbers of subjects 
enrolled in each group for the persistence assessment was very low.

Persistence data from study V59_67 
Study V59_67 [Bona 2016] assessed antibody persistence in toddlers 12-15 months of age at 6 
months following 1 dose of MenACWY in terms of hSBA and rSBA titers against serogroups A, C, W, 
and Y (Table 1). 
At 6 months following vaccination (Day 180), the proportion of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 against 
serogroup A declined compared to 1 month post-vaccination (Day 29) while the proportion of subjects 
with rSBA titers ≥ 8 or ≥128 against serogroup A remained relatively constant between Day 29 and Day 
180. Against serogroup C, the proportion of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 remained constant, while 
rSBA titers decreased slightly over the 5 month period. However, the proportion of subjects with hSBA 
titers ≥ 8 against serogroups W and Y at 6 months after vaccination increased above those measured 
at 1 month following vaccination. A similar increase has previously been described by Vesikari et al, 
who showed an increase in hSBA titers against serogroups W and Y between 1 and 12 months after a 
single dose of Nimenrix in toddlers [Vesikari 2012]. 
Assessor’s comments 
The overview provided by the company does not provide many new insights. Currently, the SmPC 
includes persistence data up to 5 years after vaccination in adolescents, children aged 2-10 years. 
From these data, it can be deducted that persistence is poorer in younger children. The data in the 
SmPC stem from studies V59P13E1 and V59P20E1. 
Follow up in study V59P22E1 is poor and the data does not add to what is already described. The 
findings of study V59P6E1 are in line with data already described. The discrepancies between the hSBA 
and rSBA have been discussed in earlier assessments. Study V59_67 falls outside the indication. 
B: The MAH is requested to put the results generated in the studies described in the current 
report in perspective, based upon the provided overview of all available persistence data. 
In the study V102_03E1, antibody persistence after a single dose of MenACWY-CRM was assessed in a 
control arm at 24 and 36 months after vaccination in healthy adolescents. While trends in antibody 
persistence against serogroups A and C were in line with previous results, antibody titres against 
serogroups W and Y appeared to be lower than could be expected from previously generated 
persistence data (Table 3). 
However, these findings should be interpreted with caution as the number of subjects analysed for 
persistence in study V102_03E1 was very low. The group analysed at 24 months after vaccination 
consisted of 59 subjects, and the group analysed at 36 months after vaccination consisted of only 19 
subjects. Interpretation of results obtained using such small sample sizes is extremely difficult. 
Furthermore, the serum samples from the V102_03E1 study (and the parent V102_03 study) were 
analysed using a different assay (high-throughput [HT]-SBA), than samples from studies included in 
the Menveo development program (manual hSBA). Results obtained using different assays, which have 
different sensitivity aspects, cannot be directly compared. This was also shown in multiple previous 
studies in the Menveo development program (i.e., V59P6, V59P6E1, V59P13E1, V59P14, and V59_67) 
in which the use of 2 different assays (hSBA and rSBA) resulted in differences in percentages of 
subjects with titres ≥ 1:8 and GMTs (see Part A for more details). 
In summary, the V102_03E1 study does show considerable persistence of bactericidal antibodies up to 
36 months after a single vaccination, across serogroups and the Company believes that, overall, the 
results from this study are in line with the substantial body of data already available on persistence of 
antibodies after MenACWY vaccination.

Assessor’s comments 
Trends in antibody persistence for serogroups W and Y appear lower than previously generated 
persistence data. The MAH points out two possible reasons; one is the small numbers in V102_03E1 
(the confidence intervals provide some measure of uncertainty, and these overlap between studies). A 
second is the use of a different assay in V102_03E1; a high-throughput [HT]-SBA was used here.  It is 
agreed with the MAH that results obtained using different assays, which have different sensitivity 
aspects, cannot be directly compared.

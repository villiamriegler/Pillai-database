2  Scientific discussion 
2.1  Introduction 
The Marketing Authorization Application of Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablet was submitted 
to the centralised procedure according to regulation (EC) No 726/2004, article 3(3). The legal basis is 
article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference product is the centrally authorised medicinal 
product Neoclarytin 5 mg film-coated tablet. The reference medicinal products Aerius/Neoclarityn 5 mg 
tablets (MA holder Schering-Plough Europe) were centrally authorized on the 15th January 2001.   
The reference medicinal product is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis 
and urticaria. The recommended daily dose is 5 mg in adults and adolescents. 
The active substance of the medicinal product is desloratadine. Desloratadine is a non-sedating, long-
acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity. After oral 
administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1-receptors. The selectivity is 
achieved because the substance is excluded from the entry into the central nervous system. 
This application is a generic application, therefore, demonstration of therapeutic equivalence is shown 
by means of bioequivalence.  No new clinical studies are either required or submitted with this 
application. The Applicant provided a comprehensive overview of clinical data on desloratadine in 
clinical use based upon the conclusions of the relevant clinical studies published in the literature.  
The relative oral bioavailability of Desloratadine Teva  5 mg film-coated tablets and the European 
brand product Aerius  5mg  film-coated tablets (manufactured by SP Europe,  Belgium ) was 
established by comparing the single dose pharmacokinetics of desloratadine from the two formulations, 
under fasting conditions, in a randomised crossover study. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
2.2.1  Introduction 
Desloratadine is available as 5 mg film-coated tablets for oral administration containing desloratadine 
as the active ingredient.  The full list of ingredients is defined in section 6.1 of the SPC. The film-coated 
tablets are blue, round, biconvex film-coated tablet-printed in white ink: “D5” on one side and plain on 
the other and are stored in polyamide/aluminium/polyvinyl chloride/aluminium foil blisters.  
2.2.2  Active Substance 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, the active substance desloratadine is not described in the European 
Pharmacopoeia. The Active substance Master File (ASMF) procedure is applied.  
The substance is slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol, ethanol, propylene glycol, 
acetonitrile and toluene. In acidic environments the solubility increases. Desloratadine exists in 
different polymorphic forms. 
The active substance is sourced from one manufacturer. The manufacturing process produces 
consistently the same crystalline form or ratio of crystalline forms of desloratadine. Both crystalline 
Desloratadine Teva

EMA/CHMP/654268/2011 
Page 5/15 
 
  
 
 
 
 
forms have similar solubility and therefore no difference in the bioavailability and performance of the 
product are expected.  
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process of desloratadine includes five steps.  
During evaluation of this dossier, the starting materials have been re-defined to an earlier point of the 
synthesis and consequently additional information has been included in the Restricted and Applicant’s 
parts of the ASMF. The sources of the starting material have also been clarified. In the detailed 
description of manufacturing process of desloratadine reaction conditions, equipments and quantities of 
the used materials are provided precisely. Organic and inorganic impurities as well as residual solvents 
of desloratadine active substance are well discussed. Adequate in process controls are in place and 
appropriate specifications have been adopted for the starting materials, solvents and reagents.  
The validation procedures are in compliance with ICH Q2 requirements, so the methods are considered 
adequate for the control of the active substance on a routine basis.  
Specification 
Specifications have been set that are appropriate in view of the Ph. Eur. Monograph ‘Substances for 
Pharmaceutical use’, the Q6A Guideline on Setting Specifications and the impurity discussion. The 
specification includes tests for identification (IR and HPLC), polymorphism (XRD), water, sulphated 
ash, heavy metals, residual acetic acid, related substances, assay (HPLC) and residual solvents.  
Limits of specified and unspecified related substances are set in line with ICH Q3A guidelines. The 
maximum level of total impurities is set at not more than 0.50%.  The limits for residual solvents are 
lower than ICHQ3C and Ph. Eur. requirements and are considered justified. The limits for assay are 
based on general pharmacopoeial limits for APIs measured by HPLC. 
Analytical tests are correctly drawn up and validated according ICH. Batch results confirm batch to 
batch consistency and uniformity of the quality of the substance and indicate that the process is under 
control. 
Stability 
Satisfactory stability data of twelve batches of desloratadine, stored in their proposed commercial 
packaging for up to 60 months at 25° ± 2°C/ 60 % ± 5 % RH and 6 months at 40° ± 2°C/ 75 % ± 5 
% RH, have been provided that justify the proposed re-test period of 60 months without any special 
storage condition.  
2.2.3  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the product development was to formulate tablets which are robust, stable and are 
bioequivalent to the reference medical product marketed in Europe by Schering-Plough Labo N.V. as 
Aerius/Neoclarityn 5 mg tablets. 
Desloratadine Teva 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654268/2011 
Page 6/15 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets are conventional immediate release medicinal products.   
The active substance exists in different polymorphic forms. The polymorphic forms have almost the 
same solubility characteristics, therefore the differences in the two active substance sources are not 
relevant for the product performance.  
The excipients used are all standard and commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. All excipients 
used in the manufacture of the finished product comply with official Ph. Eur. monographs except 
Opadry II Blue and Opacode white. Microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized maize starch used 
intragranular, colloidal anhydrous silica and talc used extragranular are applied in the tablet core. 
Opadry II Blue is a hypromellose based film coating. 
Satisfactory comparative impurity profiles have been presented for the test and reference products. 
Comparative dissolution profiles of reference and test biobatches were performed in three different 
dissolution media: 0.1 M Hydrochloric acid, Phosphate buffer pH 4.5, Phosphate buffer pH 6.8. In all 
three media dissolution of the drug substance from the reference and test product is fast and complete 
and profiles are proved to be similar since the amount of the dissolved desloratadine is higher than 
85% at 15 minutes. 
Adventitious agents 
Material of animal origin used in the production of Desloratadine Teva is lactose monohydrate, for 
which statements from suppliers confirm that is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)/ 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) free. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is a conventional wet granulation technology followed by mixing and 
tabletting steps and film coating with ready to use mixtures and printing. 
The manufacturing formula, flow chart and description of the manufacturing process are presented 
The presented documentation contains results of process qualification for one batch. The results 
obtained for the critical parameters tested on the qualification batch proved that the manufacturing 
process of Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets is qualified. 
The main process steps are supervised by suitable in-process controls and their acceptance criteria are 
specified.  
Batch analysis data on three pilot batches were within the specification limits and confirm both the 
consistency of production and good performance of the analysis methods. Therefore, the analytical 
tests are considered suitable, manufacturing process and analysis are well controlled.  
Product Specification  
The specification of the finished medicinal product is acceptable and includes tests for description, 
identification (UPLC, UV), identification of titanium dioxide, identification of indigo carmine, uniformity 
of dosage units, dissolution, assay (UPLC), impurities/degradation products and microbiological quality.  
The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. and 
ICH guidelines. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated.

Certificates of analysis and typical IR spectra are presented. The batch analysis results of pilot batches 
confirm that the finished product meets the proposed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
The conditions used in the stability studies are in accordance with the ICH stability guideline. The 
control tests and specifications of active product are adequately drawn up. Photostability results 
demonstrated that the product is not sensitive to light. 
Based on the stability results provided, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the 
SmPC are justified. 
2.2.4  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished medicinal 
product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance. 
2.2.5  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3  Non- Clinical aspects   
2.3.1  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

2.3.2  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Desloratadine Teva 5 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by Teva is considered 
unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all desloratadine 
containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is 
expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.4  Clinical Aspects  
2.4.1  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing desloratadine. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with cross-over design under 
fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of desloratadine based on published literature.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its 
current version is of particular relevance.

2.4.2  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Study design 
Study 1262 was a pivotal, single dose, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-
treatment, single- centre, crossover, comparative bioavailability study in August 2010. 
The products were studied using a crossover design with 36 healthy male and female non-smoking 
volunteers being administered an oral dose of 1 × 5 mg under fasting conditions. The study consisted 
of two study periods. Each study period included a single-dose drug administration of either the test or 
the reference product. There was a washout period of 14 days between each drug administration. 
Subjects were confined to the clinic the day prior to dosing. 
Thirty-six (36) subjects were enrolled and dosed in Period 1. Thirty-two (32) subjects completed the 
study. Twenty-nine (29) subjects were included in the statistical analysis. 
Each subject received either a desloratadine 5mg film-coated tablet (test A) or an Aerius 5mg film-
coated tablet (reference B) with 240ml water, after an overnight fast, according to a computer  
generated randomisation list. Following a washout period of 14 days, the subjects received the 
alternative formulation under identical conditions. 
During each study period, blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.33, 2.67, 3.0, 
3.33, 3.67, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0 and 72 hours after dosingat pre-
defined times. Plasma was harvested from these samples and assayed for desloratadine.

Test and reference products 
Desloratadine 5 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by Teva Pharmaceutical Works Private Limited 
Company, Hungary (Lot No. 0190310, manufacturing date 03/2010, exp. date 09/2010) has been 
compared to Aerius 5 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by Schering-Plough Ltd., Belgium, for 
Essex Pharma GmbH,  Germany (Lot No. 9STBAB2B01, manufacturing date N/A, exp. date 08/2011). 
Population studied 
Thirty-six healthy adult male (n = 18) and female (n = 18) subjects aged between 18 and 73 years 
(mean 41 ± 11), with a body mass index (BMI) of between 20.7 and 29.9 (mean 25.3 ± 2.9) and a 
weight range of 47.3 to 99.4kg (mean 71.2 ± 14.2) participated in the study. Seventeen subjects were 
White, 8 were Hispanic/Latino, 8 were Black and 3 were Asian. All female subjects were surgically 
sterile, post-menopausal or taking adequate contraceptive precautions. 
Of the 36 subjects who entered the study, 32 completed the study in its entirety: 
- Subject 14 withdrew from the study prior to period 2 due to work related issues. 
- Subjects 21 and 28 failed to report for period 2. 
- Subject 05 was dismissed from the study prior to period 2 due to non compliance. 
Of these 32 subjects, a total of 29 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical 
analyses. Subjects 07, 19 and 36 were excluded from the pharmacokinetic/statistical analysis as these 
subjects had pre-dose concentrations detected in period 2 which were greater than 5% of the Cmax 
value reported for period 2. This is in line with the applicable bioequivalence guideline 
Analytical methods 
An LC/MS/MS assay for the determination of desloratadine in human plasma was developed and 
validated at Warnex Bioanalytical Services in Laval, Québec. The analytical method was calibrated 
between 25.0 to 6250 pg/mL. Precision and accuracy criteria were adequately set.  
The results of the stability investigations were satisfactory. Overall, the bioanalytical method was 
considered adequately validated. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest in this study were AUC0-72h and Cmax. Other 
pharmakokinetic parameters, such as AUCinf, AUC t/AUC inf, Kel, and Tmax were to be given for 
information purpose only. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) including sequence, subjects nested within sequence, period and 
treatment was performed on the log-transformed data for AUC0-72h and C max. Tmax was analysed using 
a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon test)
. 
The 90% confidence intervals of the test/reference ratios of geometric means for AUC0-72h and C max 
were calculated based on the least squares means and estimate of the ANOVA. 
Desloratadine Teva 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/654268/2011 
Page 11/15 
 
  
 
 
Bioequivalence was established if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio (test/reference) of the 
geometric least squares means for the log-transformed parameters AUC0-72h and C max were within the 
internationally accepted range of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
Results 
Summary of the pharmacokinetic results and the statistical analysis: 
The geometric 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of AUC0-72 and C max for the test and reference 
products fall within the pre-specified acceptance range for bioequivalence of 80.00 to 125.00%. 
Safety data 
A total of 8 mild adverse events (AEs) were experienced by the subjects after taking the Test product. 
A total of 6 mild AEs were experienced by the subjects after taking the Reference product. The most 
common adverse events were somnolence, headache and catheter site pain/oedema and were all mild 
in severity. There were no AEs associated with clinical laboratory tests at post-study. No serious 
adverse events were reported during the conduct of this study.  
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Desloratadine 5 mg film-coated tablets is considered 
bioequivalent with Aerius 5 mg film-coated tablets.

2.4.3  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.4  Additional data 
Dissolution studies were performed in order to demonstrate the equivalence between the reference and 
the test product with regard to desloratadine release. All the dissolution studies were carried out using 
6 or 12 tablets of each compared product using basket apparatus (500 ml of 0.1 M HCl, 100 rpm, 37.0 
± 0.5°C). All batches of Desloratadine 5 mg Film-coated Tablets conform to the specification. Aerius 5 
mg Filmtabletten (batch no.: 9STBAB2B01, biobatch, Schering-Plough Labo N.V, DE) and 
Desloratadine 5 mg Film-coated Tablets (batch no.: 0190310) used in the biostudy showed almost the 
same dissolution profiles. 
2.4.5  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.6  Discussion and conclusions on Clinical aspects 
To support this generic application, a single bioequivalence study has been performed. The design of 
this study as a cross-over, two-period, two-sequence, open-label study is adequate. The study was 
conducted in fasting state, which is generally considered the most discriminatory approach for such 
immediate release preparations, and desloratadine was the analyte for the pharmacokinetic 
assessment including conclusions on bioequivalence.  
Truncated AUC (AUC0-72h) has been used as sampling period. This is in accordance with the applicable 
bioequivalence guideline which says that a sampling period longer than 72 hours is not considered 
necessary for any immediate release formulation. Hence for drugs with a long half-life, comparison of 
extent of exposure using truncated AUCs at 72 hours is acceptable. 
The calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters as well as their statistical evaluation is acceptable. 
Overall, the study is in line with the requirements of the applicable bioequivalence guideline.  
The 90% confidence interval for the ratio (test/reference) of the geometric least squares means for the 
log-transformed parameters AUC0-72h and C max were within the range of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
Bioequivalence between test product Desloratadine Teva 5mg film-coated tablets with the reference 
product Aerius 5mg film-coated tablets was therefore established. 
The dissolution studies supported that the test and the reference product have similar dissolution 
profiles.

2.5  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.  
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because the application 
concerns a medicinal product containing a known active substance for which no safety concern 
requiring additional risk minimisation activities has been identified. 
PSUR submission 
The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product. The PSUR of 
the reference medicinal product is on a 2-yearly cycle. The last data lock point for the reference 
medicinal product was 15.07.2011. 
User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This application concerns a generic product. The reference product is indicated for the relief of 
symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis and urticaria. No nonclinical studies have been provided for 
this application. An adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance 
was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain 
new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the 
active substance. The applicant’s clinical overview provided an update of published literature relevant 
to the product.  
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a single dose, randomized, open-label, two-
period, two-sequence, two-treatment, single- centre, crossover, comparative bioavailability study. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in 
line with the respective European requirements. The products were studied using a crossover design 
with 36 healthy volunteers being administered an oral dose of 1 × 5 mg under fasting conditions. The 
study consisted of two study periods. Each study period included a single-dose drug administration of 
either the test or the reference product. There was a washout period of 14 days between each drug 
administration. Subjects were confined to the clinic the day prior to dosing. 
The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Desloratadine Teva met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Aerius. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC 0-72h and C max were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 
125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Desloratadine Teva in the treatment of relief of symptoms associated 
with allergic rhinitis and urticaria is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation.

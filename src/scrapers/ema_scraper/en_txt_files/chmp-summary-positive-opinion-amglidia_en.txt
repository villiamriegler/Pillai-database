Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Amglidia 
glibenclamide 
On 22 February 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Amglidia, 
intended for the treatment of neonatal diabetes. Amglidia was designated as an orphan medicinal product 
on 15 January 2016. The applicant for this medicinal product is Ammtek. 
Amglidia will be available as an oral suspension (0.6 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml). The active substance of 
Amglidia is glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea (ATC code: A10BB01) which stimulates insulin release from 
pancreatic beta-cells by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels. 
The benefits with Amglidia are its ability to improve glycaemic control. The most common side effects are 
hypoglycaemia, transitory diarrhoea and abdominal pain. 
Amglidia is a hybrid medicine2 of Daonil which has been authorised in the EU since 1 January 1969. 
Amglidia contains the same active substance as Daonil, but is approved for a different indication, and is 
available in a different formulation and strength. Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality, and 
relative bio-availability of Amglidia.  
The full indication is:  
"AMGLIDIA is indicated for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus, for use in newborns, 
infants and children. 
Sulphonylureas like AMGLIDIA have been shown to be effective in patients with mutations in the 
genes coding for the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel and chromosome 6q24-related 
transient neonatal diabetes mellitus." 
It is proposed that Amglidia be started by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with very 
early onset diabetes. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion 
2 Hybrid applications rely in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for a reference product and in part on new 
data.

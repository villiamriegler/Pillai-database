2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis), also known as variant 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, is a rare, autosomal dominant, rapidly progressive, multi systemic 
disease caused by variants in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that results in debilitating morbidity and 
high mortality. Amyloid deposits accumulate in multiple organs, particularly the peripheral nervous 
system, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and heart, which manifests in progressive polyneuropathy 
including sensorimotor neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. Cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and 
gastrointestinal dysfunction frequently develop simultaneously. The phenotypic presentation of the 
disease is dependent on the pattern of affected organs. The most common manifestations of hATTR 
amyloidosis are polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The worldwide prevalence of hATTR-PN has been estimated at approximately 10,000 patients. In 
Europe, the incidence is estimated from 0.003 to 0.10 cases per 10,000 per year (between 5000 to 
6000 patients or 0.3 new cases per year per 1 million inhabitants), with the majority of cases in 
Portugal, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In Europe, the prevalence is highest in northern 
Portugal and northern Sweden (as high as 50 per 100,000 inhabitants). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
In hATTR amyloidosis, inherited variants in the TTR gene lead to destabilization of the tetrameric 
protein and disassociation of the TTR subunits into dimers and individual variant and wild-type (wt) 
monomers, which subsequently misfold.   
There are over 120 reported TTR genetic variants associated with hATTR amyloidosis with 
heterogeneity in disease presentation from predominantly neuropathic, predominantly cardiac or mixed 
phenotypes.  Worldwide, the most common disease-causing variant results in a valine to methionine 
mutation at position 30 in the TTR molecule, V30M (p. TTRV50M).  V30M is predominantly associated 
with polyneuropathy and is found primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden, Japan, and 
Brazil.  In the US, the isoleucine substitution for valine at position 122 in TTR, V122I (pV142I), is the 
most prevalent TTR-associated variant with a prevalence of approximately 4% in West Africans and 
African Americans.  V122I is associated with predominantly cardiac manifestations but also can be 
associated with concurrent polyneuropathy. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Historically, due to incomplete understanding of aetiology and pathogenesis, two clinical syndromes of 
hATTR amyloidosis have been described in the medical literature: hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, or FAP) and hATTR 
amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, or FAC), 
both of which are characterized by amyloid deposits comprised of both mutant and wtTTR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 11/158 
 
 
 
Many patients with hATTR amyloidosis are not diagnosed until their neuropathy is already at least 
moderate in severity, with sensorimotor and autonomic abnormalities starting to impact ambulation. 
The main clinical manifestations of hATTR-PN are progressive peripheral sensorimotor and autonomic 
neuropathy. Non-specific and symmetrical numbness, pain, and temperature sensitivity typically 
begins in the lower extremities, progressing distal to proximal. In patients with hATTR amyloidosis, 
sensory abnormalities include painful dysesthesias in the feet and hands, as well as loss of sensation, 
which may lead to thermal burns in these areas and to joint damage in the lower limbs.  Progressive 
muscle atrophy and motor weakness in both lower and upper limbs lead to impaired ambulation and 
inability to perform activities of daily living.  Autonomic dysfunction results in debilitating orthostatic 
hypotension leading to loss of consciousness, severe gastrointestinal symptoms (including early 
satiety, chronic nausea/vomiting, malnutrition/weight loss, and both diarrhoea and constipation), and 
bladder dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections, as well as cardiac arrhythmias. The rate of 
neuropathy progression is influenced by TTR genotype, age at symptom onset, and extent of 
neurologic impairment at time of diagnosis. 
In the heart, infiltration of cardiac tissue with amyloid leads to wall thickening and cardiomyopathy, 
manifested by heart failure due to diastolic and systolic dysfunction, as well as conduction disturbances 
and arrhythmias. Cardiac involvement has been estimated to occur in 80% of ATTR. Similar to 
polyneuropathy, patients with more severe cardiac disease at the time of diagnosis experience rapid 
progression with substantial worsening of echocardiographic and biomarker measures of cardiac 
function, ambulation, and quality of life, seen over a period of 18 months or less. Motor neuropathy 
follows within a few years, which affects ambulatory status.  
Hereditary ATTR-PN is classified into 3 stages based on ambulatory status of the hATTR patient: in 
Stage 1, the patients present with weaknesses in the lower limbs and do not require assistance with 
ambulation, while they show gait dysfunctions, distal amyotrophies and hand involvement in Stage 2 
and depend on assistance with ambulation, and are either wheel-chair bound or bedridden with 
generalised weakness and areflexia in Stage 3. This staging system was used to classify severity of 
disease in patients being considered for enrolment in the pivotal clinical study of inotersen (CS2). 
Disease severity can be also assessed using the Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score, which is a 5-
stage scoring system. 
Given the severity of hATTR, there is a significant impact on patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life. 
Caregivers have moderate to high levels of fatigue and spend a significant amount of time caring for 
patients. Hereditary ATTR is associated with a substantial disruption in employment rates and work 
productivity. There is also a large mental health burden on both caregivers and patients. 
The constellation of progressive morbidity from amyloid infiltration in patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
results in severe disability, wasting due to gastrointestinal malabsorption, malnutrition, and cardiac 
cachexia. Death usually results from heart failure (including sudden death caused by ventricular 
arrhythmias or electromechanical dissociation) or infection. The survival after diagnosis is dependent 
on time from first symptom to diagnosis and also on age of onset. The applicant refers to publications 
claiming a median survival after diagnosis of a mere 4.7 years (range 1.3 to 24.8 years) with a 
reduced survival (3.4 years) for patients presenting with cardiomyopathy. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Before the approval of patisiran and inotersen, therapeutic strategies to treat hATTR included 
orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) or pharmacotherapy with tafamidis or off-label use of diflunisal, both 
of which are transthyretin (TTR) stabilizers that work by preventing dissociation of the tetramer into 
amyloid-forming monomers. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 12/158 
 
 
 
Tafamidis (“Vyndaqel”) was approved across the EU for the treatment of ATTR in adult subjects with 
Stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurological impairment and has also been 
licensed in Japan and several other countries. Diflunisal is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that is presently used off-label in subjects with Stage 1 and Stage 2 disease; however, the 
cardiovascular and renal side effects associated with the NSAIDs class limit the use of this drug in older 
patients with hATTR-PN or patients with hATTR CM. 
There are currently three European Commission (EC) approved therapies available in the European 
Union (EU) for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adults with polyneuropathy: ONPATTRO 
(patisiran), TEGSEDI (inotersen) and VYNDAQEL (tafamidis). Patisiran and inotersen act by targeting 
the production of TTR synthesis in the liver by acting on messenger RNA (mRNA): patisiran through 
ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi); and inotersen through RNAse H-mediated cleavage. Tafamidis 
acts by binding to the thyroxine-binding site on TTR to reduce its dissociation into misfolded 
amyloidogenic monomers.  Both ONPATTRO (patisiran) and TEGSEDI (inotersen) are also approved in 
the United States (US) and Japan. VYNDAQEL (tafamidis), is also approved in Japan for the treatment 
of polyneuropathy in adults with transthyretin amyloidosis, however it is not approved in the US for 
this indication. Other treatment approaches currently used in clinical practice for hATTR amyloidosis 
include: orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), which eliminates variant TTR from the circulation but 
does not negate the hepatic production of wtTTR, and another TTR tetramer stabilizer (diflunisal).

Treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients 
with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy 
Vutrisiran is an RNAi therapeutic comprised of a synthetic, chemically modified, double-stranded small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets variant and wtTTR messenger RNA (mRNA). Reduction 
of both variant and wtTTR production in the liver, which are the fundamental pathogenic proteins 
causing hATTR amyloidosis, will reduce ongoing deposition of amyloid deposits and potentially allow for 
clearance of existing deposits; thus, halting or reversing disease progression.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Vutrisiran is a chemically synthesised double-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule containing a 
combination of 2ʹ-F and 2ʹ-OMe nucleotides. The two single strands that form the double stranded RNA 
molecule are the sense strand A-131354, and the antisense strand A-131359. The sense strand 
contains 21 and the antisense strand 23 nucleotides, respectively, which results upon hybridisation 
between the complementary strands in a two base overhang at the 3’ end of the antisense strand. The 
sense strand contains two phosphorothioate linkages at the 5’ end while the antisense strand contains 
four, two each at the 3’ and the 5’ end. The 3’ end of the antisense strand is conjugated to the 
triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) moiety. 
The chemical names of vutrisiran sense and antisense strands are:

The structure of vutrisiran active substance (AS) can be represented using an expanded structural 
formula showing the phosphate backbone as shown in Figure 1. The bases involved in base pair 
formation are connected with a dotted line. All phosphodiester groups are negatively charged with 
sodium as the counter ion. The structure of R1, the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) containing moiety 
is also provided. 
Figure 1: Expanded Structural Formula of Vutrisiran 
The molecular formula and mass of the vutrisiran and the two single strands are provided in Table 1. 
Table 1: Molecular Formula and Molecular Mass 
The chemical structures of vutrisiran and the single strands were elucidated and confirmed by a 
combination of LC-MS, MS-MS sequencing, anion exchange HPLC, FAAS, UV absorption, UV 
spectroscopy, 1H-/13C-/19F-/31P-NMR, FTIR, thermal dependent UV absorbance, circular dichroism, 
differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The multitude of applied techniques 
allowed an in-depth characterization of the single and double strand samples. The results were 
consistent and according to expectations. The nucleotide sequence, including backbone structure and 
position of the GalNAc moiety, of the single strands was confirmed. The duplex structure of the AS was 
established.

The active substance is a pale yellow, hygroscopic powder, freely soluble in with a solubility of 361 
mg/mL.  
The chirality of the naturally occurring D-ribose is maintained during the synthesis of the modified 
nucleotides. Since the ribose moieties in an RNA sequence are predominantly in the C-3ʹ endo 
conformation, RNA molecules adopt the classic A-form as demonstrated by the spectrum of Circular 
Dichroism. 
The stereochemistry is determined by the synthetic method. The antisense strand contains four PS 
modifications, with two on 5ʹend and two at 3ʹ-end, resulting in the formation of sixteen (24=16) 
diastereomers. The sense strand contains two PS modification on the 5ʹ-end, corresponding to four 
(22=4) diastereomers. The diastereomer species of antisense strand and sense strand can be resolved 
chromatographically by a method presented in the dossier. 
2.4.2.1.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Vutrisiran AS manufacturing process consists of eight steps. Step 1 through Step 5 consist of the 
synthesis of the single-strand oligonucleotide by conventional solid-phase synthesis (Step 1), cleavage 
and deprotection (Step 2), crude ultrafiltration (CUF; Step 3), purification by anion exchange (Step 4), 
and a second UF (Step 5) for the sense and antisense strands. Each strand is then individually purified 
and concentrated in Step 3 through Step 5. During Step 6, the two individual strands are annealed to 
form the duplex, which is concentrated at Step 7, then lyophilised and packaged in Step 8 to produce 
vutrisiran AS. The batch size has been clearly stated. No reprocessing steps are foreseen. 
Protected phosphoramidites are considered suitable starting materials (SMs) for synthetic 
oligonucleotides. An appropriate justification for the classification of phosphoramidites as starting 
materials has been provided. Detailed information on the impurity profiles of the phosphoramidite 
starting materials and their classification into critical and non-critical impurities has been provided. The 
selection of all other SMs has been adequately justified and supported by data. In summary, the 
selection of all SMs has been carried out according to the principles of ICH Q11. The selection of the 
SMs is considered adequately justified taking into account also the manufacturing process which 
includes numerous cycles, including purification steps, which ensure the proper purge of starting 
materials’ potential related and degradation impurities preventing their carry over to single strands or 
even final vutrisiran AS. The proposed specifications and analytical methods for the control of SMs are 
acceptable. Suppliers of the starting materials are mentioned in the dossier. It has been confirmed that 
the addition of an alternative vendor for the starting materials will be approved by a variation. 
The quality of double-stranded oligonucleotides is pre-determined by the quality of the single strand 
precursors. Therefore, sufficient control of the single strands by adequate specifications is applied. In 
addition lists of all materials, solvents and reagents used in the AS synthesis were provided in 
3.2.S.2.3, and adequate specifications have been provided for each of them.  Stability data were 
provided to support the hold times and conditions proposed within the description of manufacturing 
process (3.2.S.2.2) and manufacturing process development (3.2.S.2.6) focusing not only on 
microbiological but also on degradation data.  
Process characterization activities to develop the control strategy and commercial manufacturing have 
been sufficiently described. Risk assessments were performed utilizing historical process understanding 
from the applicant’s manufacturing platform across multiple Alnylam products. Process parameter 
target set points, normal operating ranges (NOR) and proven acceptable ranges (PAR) were identified 
using DOE and one factor at a time (OFAT) approaches. For individual unit operations, the desired 
outcomes from characterization studies were minimization of impurities and maximization of purity and 
yield. Comprehensive information has been provided for each step of the manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 16/158 
 
 
 
Information on the process control strategy is provided in section 3.2.S.2.4. The critical process steps 
and associated CPPs for each unit operation and the non-critical process parameters of the 
manufacturing process were summarised. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been defined. These 
PARs are acceptable and have been justified in the process development studies. The in-process (IPCs) 
tests performed at each step for the manufacture of the single strands were described and are 
considered acceptable. 
A total of three full scale batches support the manufacturing process validation. Process validation runs 
have been conducted under individual protocols for each strand, and cover all unit operations, followed 
by one protocol for duplex formation, with each vutrisiran AS batch evaluated independently of one 
another. Protocols (including the protocol for continued process verification (CPV) program) and 
validation reports were provided.  
Information on batch history has been provided and all changes were described in detail and the 
influence on AS quality has been sufficiently investigated and discussed.  
The characterisation of the AS and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry 
of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
As per ICH Q3A, impurities are classified into organic impurities, inorganic impurities and residual 
solvents. The organic impurities are further classified into process-related impurities and product-
related impurities. 
Product-related oligonucleotide impurities are formed during the manufacturing process or during 
storage, including degradants. These impurities are controlled in the manufacturing process and at 
long-term storage conditions by two orthogonal HPLC techniques (AX-HPLC and IPRP-HPLC) in the 
single strands and the final active substance. 
Typical impurities are deletion (shortmers) and addition (longmers) impurities, partially deprotected 
oligonucleotide chains that are not fully deprotected or improperly deprotected during manufacture, 
phosphodiester (P=O) impurities, where a phosphodiester replaces the thiophosphate (P=S) in the 
sense and antisense strands, impurities carried over from parent starting material impurities and in 
particular those associated with the triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) portion of the sense 
strand. 
In general, a good understanding of the impurity profile in the single strands and the final AS has been 
demonstrated. Numerous impurities have been identified by LC-MS techniques. Degradation pathways 
and the impact of annealing on degradation have been sufficiently investigated and discussed. 
Impurity monitoring is performed on impurities grouped by adjusted RRT ranges which is acceptable 
for synthetic oligonucleotides with an extremely complex impurity profile. The qualification of 
impurities has been sufficiently described. 
Process related organic impurities are low molecular weight organic impurities such as residual starting 
materials, reagents and by-products from the manufacturing process. These impurities have been 
discussed and are considered removed due to extensive washing, chromatographic and ultrafiltration 
steps.  
Residual solvents have been adequately addressed and batch analysis data for 4 batches have been 
provided. 
There are genotoxic substances formed during the manufacture of both single strands, all of which are 
associated with the synthesis, recirculating cleavage and deprotection steps. The evaluation of the 
presence of these genotoxic materials in the AS is performed in accordance with the principles 
stipulated in the ICH M7 guideline. The potential impurities, including potential genotoxic impurities, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 17/158 
 
 
 
were critically discussed. In addition, information on the in silico approach to evaluate the potential 
genotoxic impurities in the AS was included. The respective conclusion on the data obtained in the 
studies performed was provided.  
The AS is packaged in 2 L, gamma-irradiated, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle closed with a 
polypropylene (PP) screw-top, and a secondary foil laminate bag.  The container closure complies with 
the EU food contact regulations including the Framework Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004, Regulation 
(EC) No. 2023/2006 (GMP) and regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 as amended. The certificate of compliance 
with foodstuff legislation is provided in the dossier. 
2.4.2.2.  Specification 
The active substance specification ncludes tests for appearance (visual), identification by duplex 
retention time (IPRP-HPLC UV), identification by molecular mass (IPRP-HPLC MS), identification by 
single strand molecular mass (IPRP-HPLC ESI-MS), identification by Tm (UV), sodium content (Flame 
AAS), purity ((non-denaturing) IPRP-HPLC UV), purity ((denaturing) IPRP-UPLC UV),  impurities 
((denaturing) AX-HPLC UV), assay (UV), pH (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), elemental impurities (ICP-
MS), residual solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
All relevant AS attributes are covered in the specification. The proposed acceptance criteria of the AS 
specification are considered acceptable. Batch release and stability data from the four clinical batches 
were originally used as basis for setting acceptance criteria.  
The specification limits for elemental impurities, residual solvents and bacterial endotoxins were 
determined according to relevant guidelines and pharmacopoeial requirements and deemed 
acceptable. Several orthogonal methods are applied to determine identity and purity/product-related 
impurities. The concept of grouping of impurities as proposed in the specification is acceptable. 
Process-related impurities are adequately controlled. The specification limits have been partly revised 
during the procedure. The CHMP recommended and the applicant has committed to re-assess and, if 
necessary, further tighten the AS specification limits for duplex purity, purity and impurities including 
specified impurities by denaturing AX-HPLC UV as well as IPRP-UPLC UV, melting temperature, sodium 
content, assay, pH and water content when there are data available from an additional 10 batches 
manufactured with the commercial process (REC). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analytical data were provided for three nonclinical/research/stability batches, four clinical/stability 
batches  and  three  commercial  scale  process  performance  qualification  (PPQ)/clinical/stability  batches 
and relevant CoAs have been presented. The batches showed compliance with the proposed specification. 
2.4.2.3.  Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 
12 months under long term conditions (-20°C ± 5°C) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(25°C ± 2°C / 60 ± 5%) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Samples were tested for assay, purity and impurities by non-denaturing IPRP-HPLC, denaturing AC-
HPLC and denaturing IPRP-UPLC, assay and water content. Results obtained showed no relevant 
changes under any of the abovementioned conditions and no trends were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 18/158 
 
 
 
  
Supportive stability data were presented for three developmental, and four clinical batches stored 
under long-term storage conditions (-20°C ± 5°C) for up to 60 months and under accelerated 
conditions (25°C ± 2°C / 60 ± 5%) for 6 months. Storage during stability testing was performed in a 
representative container closure system. 
The clinical batches showed no relevant changes under any of the studied conditions. The 
developmental batches showed no changes apart from slight decreases/increases in purity/total 
impurities by denaturing IPRP-UPLC at 25°C±2°C/60%±5% RH after 6 months and an upward trend in 
water content by Karl Fischer titrimetry at both the long term an the accelerated storage conditions. Of 
note, the three developmental batches were intentionally manufactured with an exaggerated impurity 
profile, and as such the level of degradation could reach the specification limit earlier. These batches 
were considered to be a worst case to demonstrate product stability. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial scale batch. 
Following the exposure, samples were tested for physical appearance, duplex purity by non-denaturing 
IPRP-HPLC, assay by UV, and purity by denaturing AX-HPLC and IPRP-UPLC, as well as water content 
and pH. At 1x exposure dose, little to no change was observed in quality attributes tested and the 
results remained within the specification requirement. At 8x exposure, moderate changes to the DS 
were observed, mainly resulting in the oxidation of phosphorothioate to phosphate linkages. 
The following forced degradation conditions were tested on one of the developmental batches: thermal, 
acidic, basic, oxidative, and photolytic stress. Two different AS degradation studies were performed to 
demonstrate that the two denaturing chromatographic methods (AX-HPLC and IPRP-UPLC) are 
stability-indicating. 
Based on the overall presented stability results, the proposed retest period of 36 months at the storage 
condition of -20°C ± 5°C is acceptable. Stability data obtained from the accelerated conditions also 
confirm that short excursions outside the recommended storage conditions will not negatively impact 
vutrisiran AS quality. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a sterile solution preservative-free, clear, colourless to yellow 
solution for subcutaneous injection. Each single-use prefilled syringe with passive needle safety system 
is designed to deliver 0.5 mL vutrisiran solution. The FP is 50 mg/mL vutrisiran (equivalent to 53 
mg/mL vutrisiran sodium) solution formulated in 10 mM sodium phosphate with 110 mM sodium 
chloride. The composition of the FP is presented in section 2.4.1 of this report and in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. The excipients and packaging materials are widely used in comparable pharmaceutical 
products. The vutrisiran finished product (FP) was designed based on the therapeutic hypothesis that 
vutrisiran sodium, which is a small interfering RNA (siRNA), formulated in a buffered solution (10 mM 
phosphate buffer containing 110 mM NaCl), administered via subcutaneous (SC) injection will enable 
delivery of the siRNA to the liver. A comprehensive QTTP has been established. The formulation and 
the manufacturing process were developed based on the CQAs required for this type of product. 
The properties of the active ingredient that may affect the FP manufacturing process are hygroscopicity 
and solubility. Regarding the solubility of the AS in the aqueous solution, there are no problems as 
vutrisiran is freely soluble in water. Hygroscopicity may affect the correct concentration of vutrisiran in 
the FP and for that reason, the concentration is assayed during and at the end of mixing of the bulk 
solution.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 19/158 
 
 
 
For subcutaneously administered FP, physiological pH, viscosity and osmolality are key parameters for 
smooth and complete application. Based on studies on the these properties and the impact on the 
impurity profile, the final formulation has been selected. The commercial formulation has already been 
used since the phase 3 clinical studies. The discussion on the composition development is considered 
sufficient. 
The FP does not contain overages, however, an overfill is necessary to allow withdrawal of the nominal 
volume from the pre-filled syringe. Appropriate studies have been performed to justify the overfill and 
the respective IPC. 
The manufacturing process is a common process for aqueous sterile FP that cannot be subjected to 
terminal sterilisation: buffer formulation and filtration, FP formulation and first filtration, sterile 
filtration and filling. Steam sterilisation of the FP is not feasible; this is acceptable due to the melting 
temperature of the vutrisiran duplex structure of 83 °C, which leads to denaturation into single 
strands. 
Following a risk-based approach, manufacturing process development studies were conducted to 
evaluate mixing, filling, filter size, and compatibility of product contact materials. The overall control 
strategy was determined based on the results of these studies along with the results of the risk 
assessment. Detailed lists of critical and non-critical process parameters with limits (target, NOR, PAR) 
and reference to the respective CQA were presented. The control strategy described in the 
development section has been fully transferred to the commercial manufacturing process described in 
section P.3. The manufacturing process development is sufficiently described, and further development 
studies are not considered necessary for this straightforward process.  
Compatibility of the FP with the manufacturing equipment and the CCS has been discussed. In 
addition, extractables/leachables from the manufacturing equipment materials in contact with the FP 
have sufficiently been evaluated.  
The container closure system (CCS) for the FP consists a Neopak 1 mL, long type I borosilicate glass 
syringe with a ½”, 29G staked needle and a pre-assembled rigid needle shield (RNS) and a bromobutyl 
rubber, fluoropolymer coated, threaded plunger stopper. The PFS is equipped with a needle guard and 
an add-on finger flange. The proposed primary packaging systems are standard for injectable 
formulations. The same CCS was also used in Phase 3 clinical trials.   
Sufficient information has been provided for the CCS in terms of protection, security and compatibility. 
In section 3.2.R the Applicant sufficiently describes the medical device part of the FP with respect to 
device design, development, risk management and the assembly process and controls. In addition, the 
required Notified Body Opinion was provided confirming that the CCS is compliance with the applicable 
GSPRs. 
Container closure integrity testing results demonstrate that the primary container closure components 
prevent microbial ingress under the foreseen storage conditions. The chemical compatibility of the CCS 
with the FP has been demonstrated in stability studies.  
In a simulation study no organic leachables were detected, only traces of inorganic substances. To 
support the conclusion that the primary packaging materials do not pose a risk to the quality of the FP, 
the applicant initiated testing for leachables at 30°C/ 75% and 40°C/ 75% RH in accordance with the 
intended shelf life. Results for leachables testing at 30°C/ 75% for 9 months and 40°C/ 75% RH for 6 
months were presented with no results above the reporting limit. The applied safety concern threshold 
for leachables in vutrisiran FP is in accordance with ICH M7 (4 doses per year with an assumed lifetime 
of 70 years results in 280 dosing days).

The design and development, performance requirements, design verification and validation for the 
passive needle safety system assembly process has been described in 3.2.R.2.The FP is designed to 
maintain sterility during assembly, storage, shipping, and distribution prior to use.  
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
FP manufacturing sites and other sites involved in product (QC) testing, assembly with the passive 
needle safety system, secondary packaging and labelling, physical importation and batch release for 
the EEA have been clearly stated. Relevant proof of GMP compliance for all sites as necessary has been 
provided. 
The manufacturing process of the FP comprises three steps: buffer formulation and filtration; finished 
product formulation with bioburden reduction filtration; and sterile filtration and filling, resulting in the 
filled syringes followed by labelling, and assembly with needle guard and add-on finger flange and 
packaging in a thermoform tray to protect the prefilled syringes from damages during transport. The 
FP manufacturing process as well as the assembly process of the pre-filled syringe (PFS) are 
adequately described. 
Process parameters with target, NOR and PAR as well as in-process controls were sufficiently described 
in accordance with the control strategy derived from development studies. Details regarding the 
holding times at various in-process stages during manufacturing of the finished product are provided. 
The acceptance criteria for bioburden prior to filtration is in accordance with the Note for Guidance on 
Manufacture of the Finished Dosage Form (NMT 10 CFU/100 ml).  
Both syringe components are received sterile, i.e. ready-to-use. The syringe is sterilised by ethylene 
oxide and the plunger stopper by gamma radiation. The validated sterilisation conditions applicable to 
both procedures have been included in the dossier. 
Process validations studies on three batches were provided. No major or critical deviations occurred 
during the three PPQ runs that impacted CPPs, IPCs and the release testing results. All acceptance 
criteria for the three PPQ batches were met. The validation runs cover the pre-defined range for 
compounding. Filling of the maximum number of syringes is covered by media fill runs. Results of 
media fill runs sufficiently demonstrated the maximum filling time for the FP solution into the syringes. 
The holding times have been sufficiently validated in terms of microbiological and physico-chemical 
quality and relevant data has been presented. Validation studies for the filters used for bioburden 
reduction and sterile filtration were performed.    
Overall, the manufacturing process is considered sufficiently validated and capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
2.4.3.2.  Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications for the FP includes tests for appearance (visual), appearance: 
clarity, opalescence and colouration (visible spectrophotometry), identification by duplex retention time 
(IPRP-HPLC UV), identification by molecular weight (IPRP-HPLC MS), purity ((non-denaturing) IPRP-
HPLC UV), purity ((denaturing) AX-HPLC UV), purity ((denaturing) IPRP-UPLC UV),  assay (UV), pH 
(Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility  
(Ph. Eur.), volume in container (Ph. Eur.), dose uniformity (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (dye 
ingress), mechanical syringe performance (in-house). 
The FP specifications include all required tests for a sterile aqueous medicinal product containing 
double-stranded RNA supplied in a pre-filled syringe.

The specification limits for purity and impurities for release are identical to the limits for the AS. The 
limits for shelf life are partly higher than the release limits if the evaluation of the stability data has 
shown susceptibility to changes over time. The specification limits have been revised during the 
procedure. The CHMP recommended and the applicant has committed to re-evaluate and, if necessary, 
further tighten the specification limits of the finished product after approval when data from an 
additional 10 commercial batches are available (REC). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Test results for the 
three PPQ batches with a validated test procedure have shown a total elemental impurity content of 
less than 30% of the PDE for the corresponding elements. Thus it has been concluded that no 
additional controls are required in the finished product specification. 
A risk evaluation on the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product was provided in line 
with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion 
for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of 
Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk of possible presence 
of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product was identified. 
Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. The nitrosamines risk evaluation 
report is considered acceptable.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. The finished product is released on the market 
based on the above release specifications through traditional finished product release testing. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on seven commercial scale batches in vials and 8 batches in 
pre-filled syringes. The 8 batches in pre-filled syringes were manufactured by the commercial 
manufacturing site. All the test results were within the proposed specification limits demonstrating the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
2.4.3.3.  Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 
9 months under long term conditions (2-8°C, 25°C / 60% RH, and 30°C / 75% RH) and for 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples 
were stored horizontally, with horizontal position being considered worst case due to maximal contact 
of the aqueous finished product with the plunger and tip cap. 
Supportive stability data were presented for three clinical and two further supportive batches stored 
under the same long-term storage conditions (2-8°C, 25°C / 60% RH and 30°C / 75% RH) for up to 30 
months and under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) for 6 months. Samples were packaged into 
the syringes proposed for routine storage (except for the needle safety system).  
Samples were tested for appearance, purity ((non-denaturing) IPRP-HPLC UV), purity ((denaturing) 
IPRP-UPLC UV), purity ((denaturing) AX-HPLC UV), assay, pH, osmolality, particulate matter, volume 
in container, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, container closure integrity and mechanical syringe 
performance. The test methods used are the same as those for release and are stability indicating. No

significant changes were observed in any of the attributes at either long-term or accelerated conditions 
and the results met the specifications valid at the time.  
A photostability study was conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B on one commercial scale batch. The 
study results indicate the FP is considered to be photostable. 
In addition a study of exposure to thermal cycling for four times between -20°C and 40°C for three 
consecutive days at each condition showed no adverse effects on FP quality.  
Based on the presented data, the proposed shelf life of 2 years and the storage conditions "Do not 
store above 30°C. Do not freeze.", as stated in the SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4 are accepted. 
2.4.3.4.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the FP. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on 
the benefit-risk balance of the product related to reassessing the specification limits for the active 
substance and finished product once additional commercial batches become available. These are 
proposed as Recommendations for future quality development (see below). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
 - to re-assess the active substance specification limits for duplex purity, purity and impurities 
including specified impurities by denaturing AX-HPLC UV as well as IPRP-UPLC UV, melting 
temperature, sodium content, assay, pH and water content when there are available data from an 
additional 10 batches manufactured with the commercial process. 
- to re-assess the finished product specification limits for purity and impurities when there are 
available data from an additional 10 batches manufactured with the commercial process.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Vutrisiran is a second generation double stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) with 
several modifications including 2’-fluoro and 2’O-methylated ribose sugars as well as 
phosphorothioate- substitutions at the 5’-end of the sense strand and both 5’- and 3’-termini of the 
antisense strand, which have been established to enhance metabolic stability and may suppress 
activation of the innate immune system (reviewed by Hu B et al. Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2020; 
5(1): 101). In addition, the 3’end of the sense strand is covalently linked to triantennary N-
acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues. The GalNAc- moiety overcomes the common inability of 
hydrophilic and macromolecular oligonucleotides to permeate cellular membranes by enabling specific 
delivery and endocytosis of the siRNA via the highly conserved and abundant asialoglycoprotein 
(ASGPR) receptors in the liver (Nair JK et al. J Am Chem Soc. 2014; 136(49): 16958-61). While ASGPR 
are subsequently recycled and available for further uptake of GalNAc-conjugates, vutrisiran is released 
into the cytoplasm to specifically mediate the degradation of wildtype (wt) and mutant transthyretin 
(TTR) mRNA by RNA interference. Consequently, the amount of circulating TTR protein is reduced, 
which inhibits further amyloid deposits thereby preventing deterioration of hereditary transthyretin 
amyloidosis (hATTR). 
The strategy of effective liver targeting and RNA silencing has been earlier developed for the siRNA 
patisiran that is approved for hATTR as i.v. infusion in a lipid nanoparticle formulation (patisiran ) and 
was also established for GalNAc-conjugated siRNA therapeutics, which were recently licensed for 
different indications (givosiran, lumasiran and inclisiran). 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Vutrisiran was initially identified in a screen for chemically optimized GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs that 
target the 3’-UTR of wt and mutant TTR transcripts. Bioinformatics and direct sequencing 
methodologies revealed only one single nucleotide polymorphism in the human TTR target sequence 
with a negligible allelic frequency of 0.0005 near the 3’-end of the antisense strand of vutrisiran, which 
unlikely impacts on the specificity or potency of vutrisiran. Accordingly, vutrisiran concentration-
dependently inhibited TTR mRNA with IC50 values of 0.21 nM or 3.63 nM following either transfection, 
or free uptake of the siRNA into primary monkey hepatocytes. 
As the binding region of vutrisiran in the TTR mRNA is identical between humans and monkeys, but is 
not conserved in mice, rats and rabbits, non-clinical in vivo “proof-of-concept” investigations were 
restricted to monkeys and transgenic mice expressing the most prevalent human valine to methionine 
variant of TTR at amino acid 30 (V30M). Following single or repeated once monthly s.c. injections of 
0.3 to 3 mg/kg vutrisiran, TTR protein was dose- and time-dependently reduced between -60 % 
to -98 % of pre-dose levels within 7 to 14 days in TTR V30M transgenic mice and within 21 to 28 days 
in monkeys. Thereafter, TTR slowly recovered, but remained reduced at less than -20 % to -70 % of 
baseline values until study terminations on day 185 in mice and day 204 in monkeys. Of note, the TTR 
reductions after single vutrisiran doses of 10 mg/kg i.v. or 1 mg/kg s.c. in monkeys showed highly 
similar profiles. The peak TTR declines correlated with comparable Cmax and AUClast in liver tissue.

EMA/CHMP/689555/2022

In contrast, the lack of pharmacological activity of vutrisiran was confirmed in toxicity studies in rats 
and rabbits. Conversely, s.c. administration of a rodent-specific vutrisiran orthologue showed effective 
reductions TTR protein by >95 % in rats. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Potential off-target transcripts of vutrisiran had been identified in silico. In hepatoma cells in vitro, up 
to 10 nM vutrisiran did not silence five of these possible off-target transcripts with 5 to 8 mismatches 
compared to the TTR mRNA sequence, while inhibitions of three other mRNAs between 50 to 75 % 
were observed at higher vutrisiran concentrations up to 100 nM. As vutrisiran decreases TTR mRNA 
with an IC50 of approximately 0.1 nM, the interference with these off-target transcripts at more than 
100-fold higher concentrations is of insignificant clinical relevance. Hence, pharmacodynamic 
interactions studies were not performed. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Single s.c. vutrisiran doses up to 300 mg/kg, which corresponded to maximum plasma levels of 
49.1±7.7 µg/ml, did not impact on cardiovascular function (heart rate, ECG, blood pressure), 
respiratory rate and body temperature in a combined GLP compliant study in telemetered Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Likewise, examinations of neurological functions (behaviour, reflexes) at s.c. vutrisiran doses 
up to 300 mg/kg within repeated-dose toxicity studies in monkeys did not show any abnormalities and 
followed ICH M3(R2) recommendations and European 3R principles (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995; 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/3Rs/742466/2015). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with vutrisiran due to its specificity for 
human TTR mRNA that renders the interaction with the expression of other transcripts unlikely. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of vutrisiran have been analysed in vitro and after single s.c. compared 
to i.v. doses in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys in vivo. These investigations were complemented by 
toxicokinetic determinations as indicated below. 
Vutrisiran was rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration reaching peak plasma concentrations between 
0.5 and 1 h in rats and 1.9 and 2.8 h in monkeys. In both species, the vutrisiran plasma exposure 
increased dose-proportionally up to 3 mg/kg and greater than dose-proportionally at higher dosages, 
which was attributed to saturation of ASGPR-mediated uptake of vutrisiran into the liver. No significant 
accumulation or sex difference was noted upon repeated once monthly s.c. injections in both species. 
Distinct elimination phases could not be reliably determined in the two species, but estimated plasma 
half-lives ranged from 2 to 3.3 h in rats and 3.3 to 4.7 h in monkeys. 
Vutrisiran showed concentration-dependent plasma protein binding between 75 to 87 % in animals, 
which is comparable to humans (82 %). No preferential distribution into blood cells was found. 
The more than 40-fold higher distribution volume of vutrisiran compared to the total blood volume in 
rats indicated extensive tissue distribution. In fact, QWBA analysis following s.c. administration of 
3 mg/kg 3H-labelled vutrisiran in rats revealed the predominant distribution of radioactivity into the 
liver, injection site, lymph nodes, thoracic lymphatic duct, and kidneys, but also into the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 25/158 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal tract. By day 56, radioactivity was cleared from all tissues except lymph nodes, kidney 
cortex and injection site. 
The effective hepatic delivery of s.c. dosed vutrisiran was further evident by the consistently higher 
liver concentrations of vutrisiran compared to plasma and kidneys across mice, rats and monkeys, 
which lacked any gross differences between sexes. Maximum liver concentrations after s.c. dosing 
were reached each by 8 and 24 h in rats and monkeys. Thereafter, vutrisiran was eliminated more 
slowly from liver tissue with half-lives of approximately 4 to 6 days in rats and 20 to 30 days in 
monkeys. 
Vutrisiran was largely stable in plasma of mice, rats, monkeys and humans in vitro. In plasma and liver 
samples of rats and monkeys in vivo, vutrisiran metabolites were characterized by either truncation of 
one or three nucleotides at the 3’-terminus of the antisense strand (= AS(N-1)3’ and AS(N-3)3’ each) 
or by sequential cleavage of GalNAc-groups followed by loss of the linker from the 3’-end of the sense 
strand. At later time points, consecutive exonucleolytic degradation from the 3’-termini of both strands 
of vutrisiran was additionally observed. Significant cleavage by endonucleases did not occur. 
Unchanged vutrisiran remained the predominant drug-related material in the liver of rats and monkeys 
at 14 days and 15 days post dosing, respectively, and was also the main component in urine and bile 
of intact and bile duct-cannulated rats. 
Renal and biliary excretion were identified as predominant routes of elimination of vutrisiran in a mass 
balance study in intact and bile duct-cannulated rats after single s.c. dosing of 3H-labelled vutrisiran. 
While 52.5 % of the radioactive vutrisiran dose was detected in urine of intact rats, about 25.8 % and 
24 % were recovered in bile and urine of bile duct-cannulated rats. The majority of the urinary 
radioactivity appeared to be mainly associated with truncated metabolites of vutrisiran, but 
approximately 3.71 % and 5.75 % of the dose were confirmed as unchanged parent compound in 
intact and bile duct-cannulated rats. In bile, approximately 9 % and 3 % of the radioactivity were each 
unveiled as unchanged vutrisiran and the AS(N-1)3’-metabolite. In monkeys, renal excretion was also 
determined as primary elimination route of vutrisiran and about 11 % and 24 % of the s.c. 
administered 1 or 30 mg/kg doses were recovered as unchanged vutrisiran in urine. In both rats and 
monkeys, faecal excretion was negligible. 
Vutrisiran was neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 enzymes. In pregnant 
rats and rabbits, vutrisiran was detected in the placenta. In foetal liver or the remainder of foetal 
carcasses of both species, vutrisiran levels were below the level of quantification indicating that 
vutrisiran was not transferred to the foetuses. A rodent vutrisiran orthologue was also not quantifiable 
in the placenta of pregnant rats and in rat foetal tissues. The milk transfer of vutrisiran was not 
investigated. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of vutrisiran was investigated in compliance with GLP and prevailing ICH requirements in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies with multiple once monthly s.c. administrations for 13 weeks and 
6 months in rats as well as 13 weeks and 9 months in monkeys to evaluate exaggerated effects 
compared to the quarterly therapeutic regimen proposed for hATTR patients. Monkeys were selected as 
pharmacologically responsive species, whereas rats served to unravel possible off-target effects. 
Nevertheless, a rodent-specific orthologue of vutrisiran was also tested in a combined dose-range 
finding (DRF) fertility and developmental toxicity study in rats. In addition, a standard battery of 
genotoxicity studies and reproductive and developmental toxicity investigations in rats and rabbits 
were performed. Given the generally mild effects, recovery periods did not follow the dosing phases of 
the 6 and 9 months toxicity studies. Non-GLP compliant DRF experiments preceded the pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 26/158 
 
 
 
investigations including Tg-rasH2 WT, C57Bl/6 and CD-1 mice to support future carcinogenicity 
evaluations. In addition, quarterly s.c. injections were compared with more frequent monthly doses in 
a 6 months exploratory toxicity study in rats to support the intended clinical treatment schedule. 
Control animals concomitantly received 0.9 % NaCl. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies have not been conducted with vutrisiran, which is endorsed in accordance 
with prevailing ICH and European guidance (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995; EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010). 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In all repeat-dose toxicity studies, no clinical signs, altered coagulation or most clinical chemistry 
parameters, abnormal organ weights, ophthalmological or macroscopic findings were evident. A 
relationship of the low mortality incidences in rats with vutrisiran could either be excluded or rated 
improbable. 
All s.c. vutrisiran doses in the toxicity studies in monkeys (≥30 mg/kg/month) reduced TTR serum 
protein levels as expected without any dose-dependency. TTR decreases between -38.7 to -50.1 % 
were already evident after the first vutrisiran injection with maximum declines up to -99 % after the 
third to fourth monthly dose. TTR reductions were maintained in the respective dosing phases and 
throughout the 12 weeks recovery period of the subchronic toxicity study. 
It should be noted that the TTR protein normally interacts with the retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4)-
retinol complex to prevent renal clearance of RBP4 and to enable recycling of RBP4 after intracellular 
retinol release, which is the major pathway for retinoid transport (Li Y et al. Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr. 
2014; 3(3): 126-39). In addition, TTR protein is known for the limited transport of about 15 % of total 
human thyroxine T4 (Buxbaum JN and Reixach N. Cell Mol Life Sci. 2009; 66(19): 3095-101). 
Accordingly, the TTR protein reductions by vutrisiran concomitantly produced sustained decreases of 
vitamin A by up to -86 to -89 % and thyroxine T4 (up to -45 %) in monkeys. Nevertheless, no 
histological abnormalities in retinol-dependent tissues (eyes, thyroid and pituitary) were eminent. 
In the liver, mild to moderate centrilobular and multifocal basophilic hepatocellular vacuolation 
manifested at ≥15 mg/kg in rats, while minimal basophilic granules in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes 
were identified at ≥30 mg/kg in monkeys. Mitotic figures and karyomegaly were also slightly increased 
in rat hepatocytes at ≥10 mg/kg. In the 6 months exploratory toxicity study in rats, these liver 
findings were more pronounced at the end of the recovery period compared to termination of dosing 
with higher incidence after monthly compared to quarterly s.c. administrations. 
Moreover, vacuolated macrophages were detected at minimal incidences in the inguinal lymph nodes 
at ≥12 mg/kg in rats, whereas mild to moderate amounts were present at ≥30 mg/kg in mesenteric 
lymph nodes and at ≥100 mg/kg in axillary inguinal and mandibular lymph nodes of monkeys. 
Vacuolated macrophages partially mixed with inflammatory cells were also enriched at the injection 
sites as minimal to slight infiltrates at ≥12 mg/kg in rats and ≥30 mg/kg in monkeys. 
In accordance with the primary excretion of vutrisiran, minimal to moderate basophilic granules were 
found in proximal renal tubule epithelia at ≥40 mg/kg in rats, but not in monkeys. Except liver 
changes, the histological alterations in kidneys, lymph nodes and injections sites were reversible upon 
cessation of dosing. 
No anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs) were discovered in the 6 months toxicity study in rats, whereas eight 
of the 32 monkeys in the 9 months chronic toxicity study developed ADAs that did not impact on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 27/158 
 
 
 
pharmacology, toxicokinetic or toxicity of vutrisiran. Of note, two monkeys of the vutrisiran groups and 
one control monkey even had cross-reactive antibodies prior to first administrations. Only one of these 
monkeys administered 100 mg/kg vutrisiran showed ADAs until day 29, but not beyond. In the other 
five monkeys, ADAs were confirmed at the end of dosing in 2 of 8 monkeys of the 30 mg/kg group and 
5 of 8 animals of the 100 mg/kg group. As no ADAs were detected in the 300 mg/kg qM high dose 
group, their development obviously showed no dose relationship. Vutrisiran did not stimulate various 
cytokines in human whole blood samples in vitro and in a 13 weeks DRF toxicity study in monkeys 
in vivo. 
Among clinical chemistry parameters, alkaline phosphatase levels were moderately increased upon 
long-term quarterly dosing of vutrisiran ≥10 mg/kg in rats and in all repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
monthly injections ≥100 mg/kg in monkeys. 
Based on these findings in long-term toxicity studies, the respective high dose levels of 150 mg/kg in 
rats and 300 mg/kg in monkeys were established as NOAELs. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Vutrisiran was not genotoxic in an Ames test and a mammalian cell assay in human lymphocytes with 
and without metabolic activation in vitro. In vivo, vultrisiran did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow 
of rats with Cmax and AUC0–24 h based exposure margins of 2978x and 4618x for males and 2449x and 
3526x for females, respectively. No toxicity occurred up to the highest vutrisiran dose. Hence, 
vutrisiran is not expected to exert any genotoxic potential. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity investigations were not provided, but 2-year bioassays in rats and CD-1 mice have 
been initiated. Submission of the results in rats is envisaged by the end of 2021 and in mice at the 
beginning of 2024. 
In preparation for the originally planned 6-month short-term carcinogenicity study, two DRF studies in 
Tg-rasH2 WT and C57BL/6 mice were conducted. The dose selection followed ICH S1C(R2) 
recommendations (≤1500 mg/kg). Given the dose-dependent hepatotoxicity in both mouse strains, 
which might exceed the clearance capacity of the liver and could secondarily promote clinically 
irrelevant neoplasia, this plan was abandoned. 
Therefore, a third DRF study in CD-1 mice was performed to support a life-time carcinogenicity 
investigation in this strain at doses that provide at least 25× exposure multiples to the anticipated 
human AUC. The toxicity profile of CD-1 mice was consistent with that of other mouse strains. With 
respect to the higher dose frequency in mice compared to humans and scaling for species differences 
based on body surface area, the high dose (MTD 50 mg/kg/monthly) corresponds to 29.2x the clinical 
dose (25 mg/quarterly). Cmax and AUC based multiples of exposures were 255x and 64x in males as 
well as 240x and 50x in females, respectively. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The reproductive and/or developmental toxicity of s.c. administered vutrisiran was investigated in 
studies on fertility and early embryonic development in rats, embryo-foetal development in rats and 
rabbits and on pre-postnatal development in rats. 
In the pivotal fertility and early embryonic development study, weekly administration of vutrisiran 
decreased prostate gland weights and prostate gland secretions, but no effects on sperm parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 28/158 
 
 
 
were observed. Hepatotoxicity was noticed in both genders. The paternal NOAEL was established at 
15 mg/kg qw and the maternal NOAEL at 30 mg/kg qw. However, vutrisiran did not impact on 
reproductive performance in either sex or on early embryonic development. The NOAEL for these 
parameters was the highest dose studied of 70 mg/kg qw (323-fold the MRHD normalised to 
0.035 mg/kg/week). Of note, treatment with a single dose of the rodent-specific vutrisiran orthologue 
induced the anticipated reductions of thyroxine and vitamin A in a combined DRF study on fertility and 
development in rats. Low levels of this orthologue were determined in maternal kidney samples, but 
not in maternal liver, placenta or foetal tissues. Although vutrisiran was quantifiable in maternal 
placenta, it was also not found in foetal livers or the remainder of the carcasses indicating that 
vutrisiran was not transferred to the foetuses. 
In the embryo-foetal development study in rats, vutrisiran elicited maternal toxicity. Macroscopic and 
microscopic findings were observed in different organs (liver, pancreas and uterus) as well as adverse 
effects on body weight gain and food consumption. Increased premature delivery, increased post-
implantation loss, decreases in viable foetuses and a reduction in foetal body weights were noticed 
during Caesarean and foetal evaluations. The incidence of skeletal variations was increased in high 
dose foetuses, but no gross external or visceral anomalies were observed. The NOAEL for maternal 
toxicity was established at 10 mg/kg/day (323-fold the MRHD normalised to 0.005 mg/kg/day) and for 
embryo-foetal development at 3 mg/kg/day (97-fold the MRHD normalised to 0.005 mg/kg/day). 
In the study on embryo-foetal development in rabbits, vutrisiran did neither affect maternal 
parameters, nor embryo-foetal development. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal 
development was therefore the high dose of 30 mg/kg/day (1935-fold the MRHD normalised to 
0.005 mg/kg/day). Vutrisiran was quantifiable in maternal liver and kidney of pregnant rabbits, 
whereas low concentrations were found in the placenta. Vutrisiran levels were below the level of 
quantification in all foetal tissues, indicating that maternal exposure did not result in the transfer of 
vutrisiran to foetuses. As expected, treatment with vutrisiran did not have any effects on hepatic TTR 
transcripts confirming that vutrisiran is not pharmacologically active in rabbits. 
In a pre-postnatal development study in rats, vutrisiran administered every 6th day showed no effects 
on the dams as well as on growth and development of the offspring. The NOAEL for the F0 and 
F1 generation was established at 20 mg/kg (approximately 92-fold the MRHD normalised to 
0.035 mg/kg/week). Vutrisiran was not detected in plasma samples of F1 pups exposed to vutrisiran 
via milk. However, since there was a time gap between maternal vutrisiran administration and plasma 
sampling in the offspring, the milk transfer as previously shown for other GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs 
cannot per se be excluded for vutrisiran. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic plasma exposure was determined in plasma following single or repeated s.c. 
administrations of vutrisiran in repeated-dose toxicity studies in male and female mice, rats and 
monkeys as well as in pregnant rats and rabbits of the reproduction toxicity program. The vutrisiran 
levels were also evaluated in the liver and kidneys of mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. 
The toxicokinetic plasma exposure of vutrisiran commonly increased in a greater than dose-
proportional manner in mice, rats and monkeys. In all three animal species, vutrisiran did not 
accumulate in plasma. Differences between sexes were less than 2-fold. 
Vutrisiran exposure was generally higher in liver compared to kidneys or plasma. Vutrisiran did not 
enrich in the liver of rats, whereas mild liver accumulation was observed at elevated doses in mice and 
monkeys. Across the three species, the kidney exposure of vutrisiran increased more than dose 
proportionally and was found to accumulate upon prolonged monthly administrations by about 1.5- to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 29/158 
 
 
 
3.2-fold in mice and 3- to 4-fold in rats, respectively. Albeit not specifically determined, kidney 
accumulation can also be reasonably expected for monkeys, given the 1.6- to 2.6-fold higher vutrisiran 
liver concentrations upon multiple administrations. 
After quarterly compared to once monthly s.c. administrations of the same 50 mg/kg vutrisiran dose in 
rats, the liver and kidney concentrations were slightly lower but remained detectable throughout the 
treatment-free recovery period. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of s.c. administered vutrisiran was evaluated as part of repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. No dermal irritation was seen in rats. Apart from transient occasional signs of minor erythema 
and/or oedema in toxicity studies in monkeys, which were apparently related to the administration 
procedure, no other local intolerabilities or dermal irritation was noted including modified Draize 
scoring. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies including immunotoxicity, dependence or phototoxic potential were conducted 
or are deemed necessary. In exploratory investigations, vutrisiran did not induce pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in plasma samples from monkeys or healthy human donors. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) in accordance with the Guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
corr. 2). Vutrisiran is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. 
The PEC surface water has been refined with prevalence data from the Orphan Designation 
EU/3/18/2026. The PEC surface water value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A Phase II 
environmental fate and effects analysis is not required. 
Considering the above data, vutrisiran is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Vutrisiran is a siRNA that specifically decreases hepatic TTR transcript levels by RNA interference. As a 
consequence, the systemic amounts of TTR protein are reduced, which inhibits the accumulation of 
amyloid deposits within tissues known to cause hATTR. Due to interspecies differences in the TTR 
mRNA sequence, vutrisiran is pharmacologically cross-reactive in monkeys, but not in rodents or 
rabbits. Pharmacodynamic investigations including human cell lines, primary monkey hepatocytes and 
in vivo studies in transgenic mice carrying the most prevalent human V30M TTR variant or in monkeys 
demonstrated the specific dose- and time-dependent reductions of TTR protein. The sequence 
specificity of vutrisiran was confirmed in silico and in vitro, which did not reveal any binding of 
vutrisiran to transcripts with fewer than three mismatches, while the interaction with mRNAs 
harbouring 5 to 8 mismatches was only detected at clinically irrelevant concentrations. In addition, the 
PK/PD relationship of vutrisiran supports the suitability of the s.c. administration route and was verified 
at elevated doses in toxicity studies in monkeys. 
Vutrisiran did not affect cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological functions in monkeys and rats of 
the toxicology program, which coincides with safety pharmacological results of other GalNAc-
conjugated siRNAs (Sutherland JE et al. Nucleic Acid Ther. 2020; 30(1): 33-49; EPARs of givosiran 
(EMEA/H/C/4775), lumasiran (EMEA/H/C/5040) and inclisiran (EMEA/H/C/5333)). The potential 
inhibition of hERG currents was not analysed in vitro, which is accepted, because the large molecular 
size of oligonucleotide drugs likely precludes their interaction with the pore of cardiac ion channels 
(Berman CL et al. Nucleic Acid Ther. 2014; 24(4): 291-301). 
The absorption, distribution and plasma protein binding capabilities, metabolism as well as excretion 
profiles of vutrisiran corroborate its effective liver targeting and enhanced metabolic stability against 
nucleolytic degradation. These pharmacokinetic characteristics of vutrisiran essentially coincide with 
those of other licensed GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs, which contain similar chemical modifications (see 
Agarwal S et al. Nucleic Acid Ther. 2021; 31(4): 309-315; EPARs of givosiran (EMEA/H/C/4775), 
lumasiran (EMEA/H/C/5040) and inclisiran (EMEA/H/C/5333)). The lack of any interaction with major 
cytochrome P450 enzymes is also supported by in vitro data obtained for these siRNA-GalNAc 
conjugates suggesting that this class of agents does not act as substrate, inhibitor or inducer of major 
CYPs or drug transporters (Ramsden D et al. Drug Metab Dispos. 2019; 47(10): 1183-1194). The 
suitability of quarterly compared to former monthly injections has been further demonstrated in an 
exploratory study in rats, which, hence, supports the clinical s.c. injection schedule once every 
3 months proposed for human therapy. 
In all repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, mild but widely consistent non-adverse 
histological changes in the liver, kidneys, lymph nodes and injection sites were identified, which match 
the principal distribution and accumulation sites of vutrisiran. The mild temporary injection site 
reactions coincide with observations in clinical trials of vutrisiran (pain, erythema, bruising, pruritus, 
warmth; see section 4.8 of the SmPC). Thus, no particular concerns arise from non-clinical studies with 
respect to the local tolerability of vutrisiran. 
The comparison of monthly and quarterly s.c. vutrisiran administrations in a 6 months exploratory 
toxicity study in rats also indicated that the dosing frequency impacts on the incidences of liver 
alterations, which correlated with higher vutrisiran liver concentrations following monthly vs. quarterly 
injections. No prominent off-target toxicities were solely restricted to rats. Nonetheless, rats were 
generally more sensitive than monkeys. 
No antigenicity studies were conducted with vutrisiran, but ADAs were evaluated using a validated 
method in the rat 6 month and monkey 9 month repeat-dose toxicity studies. ADAs did not emerge in 
rats, but developed in the 9 months toxicity study in monkeys independently of the administered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 31/158 
 
 
 
vutrisiran dose. The ADAs are apparently not neutralising, because they did not impact on the 
pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic or toxicological properties of vutrisiran and were also determined 
at low incidences in the clinical program of vutrisiran without any effect on TTR reductions (see 
section 3.3 below). The possible development of ADAs has been considered in section 4.8 of the 
proposed SmPC. 
Long-term quarterly s.c. vutrisiran doses ≥10 mg/kg in rats and monthly injections ≥100 mg/kg in all 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys moderately increased alkaline phosphatase levels. As the 
elimination of alkaline phosphatase was earlier correlated with hepatic galactose receptors (Blom E 
et al. Clin Chim Acta. 1998; 270(2): 125-37), these elevations might be possibly related to the slower 
clearance of alkaline phosphatase from the circulation because of its competition with vutrisiran in 
binding to hepatic ASGPR. 
Given the overall mild toxicity findings, it is agreed that the respective vutrisiran high doses of the 
6 months and 9 months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys can be considered as NOAELs. These 
NOAELs provide huge safety margins >1000-fold in rats and >3000-fold in monkeys when the 
respective exposure is normalized to quarterly dosing with regard to the anticipated levels at the 
maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The safety margins remain even sizeable at the 
respective low dose levels in rats and monkeys or when dose normalisations would be omitted. 
The observed effects of vutrisiran in repeat-dose toxicity investigations and the lack of any genotoxic 
potential in an ICH S2(R1) compliant standard battery of investigations 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008) highly correlate with former results obtained for other members of the 
class of GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs including the approved givosiran, lumasiran and inclisiran (Janas 
et al. Toxicol Pathol. 2018; 46(7): 735-745; Sutherland JE et al. Nucleic Acid Ther. 2020; 30(1): 33-
49; EPARs of “Givlaari” (EMEA/H/C/4775), “Oxlumo” (EMEA/H/C/5040) and “Leqvio” 
(EMEA/H/C/5333)). 
Carcinogenicity studies were not submitted and are presently ongoing in rats and mice. Considering the 
proposed vutrisiran treatment of a serious indication with limited life-expectancy, the delayed completion 
of carcinogenicity studies post approval has been previously accepted (EMEA/H/SA/3876/1/2018/PA/III, 
2018). Nevertheless, it was suggested to reconsider the need for carcinogenicity testing at all using the 
weight-of-evidence  gained  from  other  siRNA-based  therapeutics  with  the  same  target  and/or  similar 
backbone modifications. This discussion was, however, not provided. The lack of information concerning 
carcinogenicity testing has been included in section 5.3 of the SmPC, while the schedule proposed by 
the  Applicant  for  submission  of  the  corresponding  reports  of  both  carcinogenicity  studies  has  been 
considered as post-authorisation recommendation (see section 8.2 below). 
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, vutrisiran did not affect male and female fertility and 
early embryonic development at more than 300-fold higher exposures in rats when normalized to human 
levels at the MRHD. Embryo-foetal and pre/postnatal development was not impaired at >90-fold higher 
levels in rats and at >1900-fold in rabbits compared to normalized exposures at the MRHD. However, 
vutrisiran  is  not  pharmacologically  active  in  rats  and  rabbits.  Consequently,  no  effects  on  TTR  or 
vitamin A serum levels could be observed, except in one dose group of a combined fertility and early 
embryonic  development  DRF  study  in  rats  treated  with  a  rodent-specific  orthologue.  This  limits  the 
predictive value of these reproduction toxicity studies in terms of human safety. The TTR/RBP4 complex 
constitutes the major carrier for retinoids in humans (~95 %; Li Y et al. Hepatobiliary Surg Nutr. 2014; 
3(3):  126-39).  Retinoids  are  fundamental  for  normal  embryonic  development  and  require  balanced 
levels, because both excess dietary and insufficient vitamin A may cause similar patterns of teratogenic 
malformations (reviewed by Zile MH. J Nutr. 1998; 128 (2 Suppl): 455S-458S; Collins MD and Mao GE. 
Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 399–430; Ross SA et al. Phys. Rev. 2000; 80(3): 1021-1054). 
There  may  be  additionally  different  species  sensitivities  towards  retinoids  because  of  altered

pharmacokinetics in humans and monkeys compared to rodents and rabbits (Nau H. J Am Acad Dermatol. 
2001; 45: S183-7). 
Vutrisiran PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, vutrisiran is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
In accordance with the specific mechanism of action of vutrisiran and the weight-of-evidence 
approaches recommended by pertinent ICH and European guidelines (CHMP/167235/2004; 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/94227/2004; EMA/CHMP/ICH/752211/2012), it is accepted that no other toxicity 
studies including evaluations of the immunotoxicity, dependence or phototoxic potential have been 
performed. Consistent with the outcome of repeat-dose toxicity studies, no immunostimulatory 
potential of vutrisiran was evident in exploratory investigations. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Vutrisiran effectively silenced TTR transcript levels in monkeys and human transgenic mice. The 
general pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of vutrisiran coincide with earlier experience 
gained with other members of this class of GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Vutrisiran pharmacokinetics were investigated after single ascending doses in Study 001 in healthy 
subjects and after multiple-dose administration in HELIOS-A in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. 
Analytical methods 
The PK of vutrisiran was evaluated by monitoring the antisense strand of vutrisiran in plasma and urine 
(Study 001) and in plasma (HELIOS-A) using validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022

spectrometry-high resolution accurate mass (LC/MS-HRAM) assays. Vutrisiran concentrations were 
reported as the full-length double-stranded siRNA based on antisense concentrations. It was clarified 
that the assay measures the concentration of the sense strand with covalently linked GalNAc moiety. 
An assay range of 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL was validated and QC were used according to the relevant 
guidelines. Adequate accuracy and precision were observed for calibrators and controls in the 
validation. The assays were also validated for extraction recovery, dilution linearity, matrix effects, 
processed sample stability, hemolysis and lipemic interference (plasma only), whole blood stability, 
batch size, and injection carryover. Long term storage stability in plasma was demonstrated for 472 
days when stored at -20°C and 540 days when stored at -70°C. Long term storage stability in urine 
treated with 0.1% CHAPS was 21 days when stored at -20°C and 314 days when stored at-70°C and 
for urine treated with 1.0% CHAPS was 21 days when stored at -20°C and 320 days when stored at-
70°C. Incurred sample re-analysis was performed on 11.4% of plasma samples of study 001, and 
95.0% of the samples met the prespecified criteria. All studies plasma samples were analysed within 
the validated storage stability. Regarding urine samples, ISR was performed on 10.4% of study 
samples, and 82.1% of the samples met the pre-specified criteria. All study samples were analysed 
within 598 days of collection. The 600-day urine frozen stability was established in amendment 2 of 
validation report TSLR15-252. Vutrisiran is stable in urine at -70 °C for 600 days. 
A validated ELISA was used to assess the immunogenicity of vutrisiran by detecting serum 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G (IgG)/IgM anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against vutrisiran. The assay detects ADA 
against the entire molecule, ie, vutrisiran drug substance including the GalNAc moiety, and the linker. 
Since full length vutrisiran siRNA is used as the capturing target antigen, this ELISA method is 
expected to detect ADA against vutrisiran, as well as shorter oligonucleotides, linker, and GalNAc 
moieties. Phosphorylated vutrisiran was covalently linked to the assay plate without blocking the 
antigenic epitopes of vutrisiran. Captured ADA in human serum (or positive control serum) was 
detected using goat anti-human IgG/IgM (or anti-rabbit IgG) detection antibodies conjugated to 
horseradish peroxidase. A substrate (3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine [TMB]) was added to generate a 
chromophore and the absorbance (A450nm) was measured to determine the level of human anti-
vutrisiran IgG and IgM antibodies present in the serum samples. Samples were first analyzed with a 
screening assay and samples that showed positive ADA based on screening assays were further 
evaluated in a confirmatory assay. Only samples that were positive in a confirmatory assay were 
deemed to be ADA-positive. The method showed a sensitivity of 90.6 ng/mL and a precision with a 
%CV <25%. 
Methods for assessing the PK of patisiran were identical to those that were previously submitted to 
support the marketing approval of patisiran. 
Absorption  
In humans, vutrisiran was rapidly absorbed from the SC injection site into plasma with a median tmax 
ranging from 2 to 6.6 hours. There was low-to-moderate variability in plasma exposure of vutrisiran 
after SC dosing. There was no accumulation of vutrisiran in plasma after q3M dosing of 25 mg. 
Absolute bioavailability of vutrisiran after SC dosing in humans has not been determined. Based on a 
non-clinical mass balance study, 100% bioavailability is expected given the near complete absorption 
of radioactivity from the injection site into the systemic circulation within 24 hours. 
Distribution 
More than 80% of vutrisiran is bound to human plasma proteins in vitro, at concentrations close to 
those observed with the 25 mg dose in clinic (mean Cmax of approximately 0.1 μg/mL). In vitro protein 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022

binding was concentration-dependent and decreased with increasing vutrisiran concentrations (77.9% 
at 0.5 μg/mL to 19.0% at 50 μg/mL). The population estimate for the apparent central compartment 
volume of distribution (Vc) of vutrisiran in humans was 10.07 L (RSE=5.76%). 
Vutrisiran is expected to predominantly distribute to the liver in humans, as was observed in rats and 
monkeys. Indirect evidence of targeted liver distribution in humans is evident from the significant PD 
effect observed at doses as low as 5 mg/kg. A human ADME study of vutrisiran was not conducted due 
to concerns of prolonged exposure to radioactivity in the liver and the associated potential health 
hazard. 
Elimination 
Metabolite profiling in human plasma samples indicates that there are no detectable circulating 
metabolites of vutrisiran. In plasma, full-length vutrisiran was the only drug-related material observed. 
In urine, full-length vutrisiran represented 98% of the total drug recovered while AS(N-3)3’ vutrisiran 
was determined to be a minor metabolite (2% of total administered dose) excreted in urine. Within 
hepatocytes, vutrisiran is primarily metabolized by endo- and exonucleases to short nucleotide 
fragments of varying sizes within the liver. In vitro studies indicate that vutrisiran is not a substrate of 
CYP enzymes. 
In Study 001 the mean t½ ranged from 4 to 7.5 hours. After reaching Cmax, vutrisiran concentrations 
declined rapidly to the LLOQ within 24 to 48 hours. The mean apparent total body clearance (CL/F) 
ranged from 17.8 to 31.0 L/h across doses. The mean fraction of unchanged drug eliminated in urine 
over 24 hours (Fe0-24) ranged from 15.4 to 25.4%. Mean CL/F ranged from 17.8 to 31.0 L/h and the 
mean renal clearance (CLR) ranged from 4.45 to 5.74 L/h across the dose levels tested (25 to 300 mg), 
indicating that CLR accounts for 15.7 to 27.5% of total clearance. These data indicate that in humans 
renal clearance is not a major route of elimination of vutrisiran. 
In HELIOS-A individual tmax values ranged from 2 to 6.6 hours. After reaching Cmax plasma 
concentrations declined rapidly, reaching LLOQ by 24 hours in a majority of patients. At the 
recommended dose regimen of 25 mg q3M in humans, the population estimate for mean t½ was 6.29 
hours and CL/F was 21.6 L/h. For a 70 kg patient with normal renal function, model-estimated  hepatic 
uptake clearance (CLH) and renal clearance (CLR) were 14.6 and 5.4 L/h, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Within the single ascending dose study a dose proportional increase in Cmax was found while AUClast 
and AUCinf showed a slightly greater than dose-proportional increase across the dose range studied. 
Vutrisiran plasma concentrations over time were similar on Days 1 and 253, consequently, Cmax and 
area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) values at steady state (Day 253) 
were similar to their respective first dose values, indicating an absence of accumulation of vutrisiran in 
plasma after q3M dosing of 25 mg. 
Special populations 
Population PK Analysis 
The PK of vutrisiran after single and multiple doses of vutrisiran in healthy subjects and patients was 
analyzed within a modelling framework using pooled data from Study 001 and HELIOS-A. Covariate 
effects of age, health status (healthy subjects versus hATTR amyloidosis patients), sex, race, presence 
of ADA, Hispanic or Japanese ethnicity, and mild hepatic impairment did not impact PK of vutrisiran. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 36/158 
 
 
 
There was no significant impact of impaired renal function, with <25% higher predicted Cmax and AUC0-
24 in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to normal renal function. Body weight 
and vutrisiran presentation (PFS-S versus vial with syringe) were significant covariates on Ka. Lower 
body weight and PFS-S administration were both associated with faster absorption and a higher Cmax. 
However, the range of individual Cmax values across body weights, with either vutrisiran presentation, 
overlapped with no distinct separation of individual Cmax values. 
None of the evaluated covariates were deemed to be clinically relevant; therefore, no dose 
adjustments are recommended based on demographics or vutrisiran presentation (PFS-S versus vial 
with syringe). The population PK analysis supports the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen of 25 
mg q3M for all subgroups of patients with ATTR amyloidosis. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the population PK analysis the inter-individual variability of hepatic clearance, which represented 
73% of total clearance, was 33.5%. The absorption rate constant Ka varied about 39.7% inter-
individually. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Vutrisiran PK profiles and exposures were similar in healthy subjects and patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis. Across studies and dose levels, the median tmax ranged from 2 to 6.6 hours post-dose and 
mean t½ ranged from 4 to 7.5 hours. From the population PK analysis, the following PK parameters 
were derived: For a 70-kg patient with normal renal function (eGFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), the 
model-estimated total plasma clearance was 20 L/h, with a portion of hepatic clearance of 14.6 L/h, 
representing 73% of total clearance, and renal clearance of 5.4 L/h (equal to eGFR), representing 27% 
of total clearance. The estimated Ka was 0.1423 h-1 for doses administered with vial with syringe and 
0.2346 h-1 for doses administered with PFS-S. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In-vitro studies showed that vutrisiran was not a substrate and did not inhibit any of the major 
cytochromes nor was it a substrate of any major drug transporters. Overall, the data suggest a low 
potential for DDI with CYPs or transporters; therefore, no clinical interaction studies were warranted. 
2.6.2.2.   Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic effects of vutrisiran have been investigated in single-ascending dose FIH trial as well 
as the pivotal study in patients. The overall clinical development rational for vutrisiran was to find a 
dosing schedule that shows PD activity that is comparable to patisiran but where the drug is given less 
frequent. Pronounced and prolonged primary and secondary pharmacodynamic effects can be observed 
even after single doses as low as 5 mg. The biomarkers of pharmacodynamic activity confirmed, that a 
stable and durable reduction of TTR comparable to patisiran is possible with 25 mg vutrisiran given 
subcutaneously once every three months. 
Mechanism of action 
Vutrisiran is an RNAi therapeutic comprised of a synthetic, chemically modified, double-stranded 
siRNA. It contains an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand allowing rapid and specific delivery to 
hepatocytes via uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Upon delivery to the liver, 
vutrisiran uses the naturally occurring RNAi pathway to specifically target and silence TTR mRNA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 37/158 
 
 
 
 
Reduction of both variant and wt TTR production in the liver will reduce ongoing deposition of amyloid 
deposits and potentially allow for clearance of existing deposits, thus halting or reversing disease 
progression. The therapeutic hypothesis for vutrisiran is supported by clinical data from the patisiran 
APOLLO study. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Single SC doses of vutrisiran (5 to 300 mg) in healthy adult subjects reduced serum TTR in a dose-
dependent manner; higher doses achieved a faster onset and more durable suppression of serum TTR 
levels. The PD effect of 25 mg vutrisiran was comparable across Study 001 and HELIOS
A, with a 
similar magnitude of TTR reduction from baseline at 90 days post-dose (median of 81.8% in Study 001 
‑
versus 73.6% in HELIOS-A). Upon repeat q3M dosing in HELIOS
A, further TTR reductions were 
achieved. At the time of the endpoint mNIS+7 (9 months, are not formally the primary endpoint for 
EU) about 95% of predicted steady-state reduction had been achieved. This increased further to 99% 
‑
at Month 18. Peak, through and time-average values also appear more consistent at the later time 
points. 
Only a very limited number of patients (3 in the vutrisiran group in HELIOS-A) showed insufficient 
pharmacodynamic response and overall inconsistent values. The reasons for this are not known. In 
healthy volunteers TTR reductions were comparable between Japanese and Non-Japanese subjects. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Since TTR serves as a carrier for vitamin A, as a secondary effect dose-dependent decreases in serum 
vitamin A levels were observed. Serum vitamin A profiles paralleled changes in serum TTR and a 
significant correlation was found between TTR and vitamin A reduction (correlation coefficient of 
0.9388; p<0.0001). Vitamin A reductions in Japanese subjects mirrored those in the Non-Japanese 
population. 
Across Study 001 and HELIOS-A, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA due to vutrisiran was 2.2% 
(4/179). The presence of ADA had no impact on the PK, PD, efficacy, or safety of vutrisiran.  
Based on Study 001 results, vutrisiran has no effect on QTc interval at supratherapeutic plasma 
concentrations approximately 12-fold higher than the mean Cmax of vutrisiran at the clinically relevant 
dose of 25 mg. No relationship was observed between plasma concentration and QTcF in time-matched 
samples, indicating a lack of effect of vutrisiran on QTc. 
Dose-response relationship 
Single SC doses of vutrisiran reduced serum TTR in a dose-dependent manner, with higher doses 
achieving faster, greater magnitude, and more durable suppression of serum TTR levels with reduced 
inter-patient variability. A semi-mechanistic population PK/PD model was developed with data from 
healthy subjects to quantify the relationship between vutrisiran dose and serum TTR reduction. With 
repeat dosing, at steady state the 25 mg q3M regimen was predicted to achieve median trough TTR 
reduction of 85.1% at Month 18, which was similar to the observed median trough TTR reductions of 
81% with patisiran at Months 9 and 18. In HELIOS-A, the observed median trough TTR percent 
reduction at Month 9 was 84.7 %, consistent with the model-predicted magnitude of TTR reduction of 
84.3% with vutrisiran 25 mg administered q3M.

Population PK/PD analyses in healthy subjects and hATTR amyloidosis patients (n=202) demonstrated 
a relationship between predicted vutrisiran liver concentrations and reductions in serum TTR. Covariate 
analyses showed similar TTR reductions in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or mild 
hepatic impairment, as well as by sex, race, prior use of TTR stabilizers, TTR genotype, ADA status, 
delay in dosing due to COVID-19 pandemic, vutrisiran presentation (vial with syringe versus prefilled 
syringe with passive needle safety system [PFS-S]), and across a wide age and body weight range. 
The population PK/PD model supports the use of vutrisiran 25 mg administered q3M in all patients with 
ATTR amyloidosis. 
The disease progression model was developed to quantitatively describe mNIS+7 change over time as 
a function of serum TTR levels in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Over 9 months, a median +12.9 
change in mNIS+7 is predicted in placebo treated patients and a median -0.654 change in mNIS+7 is 
predicted in vutrisiran-treated patients (median TTR reduction 85.4%). Over 18 months, a median 
+27.4 change in mNIS+7 is predicted in placebo-treated patients and a median -2.15 change in 
mNIS+7 is predicted in vutrisiran-treated patients (median TTR reduction 88.7%). 
Vutrisiran significantly reduced disease progression across all subgroups evaluated in the model, which 
included sex, race, TTR genotype, prior TTR stabilizers use, symptom onset age at less than 50 years, 
treatment group (vutrisiran versus patisiran), delay in dosing due to COVID-19 pandemic, age, body 
weight, baseline serum TTR, and baseline mNIS+7. The disease progression model supports the use of 
25 mg vutrisiran administered q3M in all patients with hATTR amyloidosis. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vutrisiran has been developed with the expressed goal of replicating the pharmacodynamic effect of 
patisiran, but with a less burdensome treatment regime. Therefore, the clinical pharmacology program 
was rather compact and consisted of only two studies overall. In the First-In-Human study (Study 001) 
single ascending doses were given that exceeded the clinically relevant range. Modelling was then used 
to determine the dosing regimen for the single pivotal trial (HELIOS-A). 
The PK analysis was based on analytical determinations using validated methods that included liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry-high resolution accurate mass (LC/MS-HRAM) assays for 
the plasma and urine samples. The assay measures the concentration of the sense strand with 
covalently linked GalNAc moiety and the antisense strand of vutrisiran. Therefore, the existence of the 
GalNAc moiety was included in the sense strand assay. 
Furthermore, regarding the analysis of the urine samples, stability of human urine QC samples after 
storage at -70°C for 600 days was established, but initially not reported. Amendment 2 of validation 
report TSLR15-252 confirmed that Vutrisiran is stable in urine at -70 °C for 600 days. 
The pharmacokinetic profile was well characterized in Study 001. Vutrisiran is rapidly absorbed after 
SC injection and cleared from plasma primarily by distribution to the liver. With a half-life of about 4 to 
7.5 hours concentrations decline rapidly to below LLOQ with 24 to 48 hours. PK profiles on Day 1 as 
well as on repeat dosing days when given once every three months are practically identical. 
As is common with RNA-based drug products vutrisiran is not a substrate of cytochromes or common 
drug transporters, therefore there is a very low potential for any drug-drug-interaction. Metabolism is 
through unspecific endo- and exonucleases to short nucleotide fragments. 
No covariates were identified that had clinically relevant effects on vutrisiran PK. These data support a 
single fixed dose regimen for all patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 39/158 
 
 
 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect is the reduction of TTR plasma levels. This has been established 
as the key predictor of clinical efficacy. Although vutrisiran is cleared rapidly from plasma it shows a 
prolonged pharmacodynamic effect which is expected to be due to the drug being rather stable within 
hepatocytes and a resulting extended residence time. The estimated half-life within the liver is about 
55 days. 
Significant reductions of TTR are found a single dose with peek reductions reached around week 7. 
With 3-monthly dosing further reductions are achieved with mean time averaged reductions of 83.6 %. 
Overall peak-to-through fluctuations were low within the observed time frame. Preliminary data post 
month 9 point to a potentially even further reduction, which was confirmed with additional Month 18 
data. Further increases in TTR reduction however seem to have no additional effect on either efficacy 
or safety values. As TTR is the main transport mechanism for vitamin A corresponding reductions were 
found with a high correlation between TTR reduction and vitamin A reduction compared to baseline. 
The relationship between pharmacodynamics effects and clinical efficacy as well as disease progression 
as a function of serum TTR level has also been further described with appropriate models. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profile of vutrisiran has been sufficiently characterized after single ascending 
doses from 5 to 300 mg in healthy volunteers and after 25 mg q3m dosing in patients. 
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamic effects of vutrisiran have been investigated in two clinical 
trials. A dose dependent reduction of TTR with a prolonged effect even after single doses was found. 
The clinical development rational that was used for vutrisiran was to achieve similar TTR reduction as 
found with patisiran. Overall a durable and stable reduction of TTR has been established with 
corresponding secondary reductions of vitamin A, with 99% of predicted steady-state values reached 
by Month 18. 
Overall, the pharmacodynamic effects as well as the dose-response relationship have been well 
characterized and support use of vutrisiran at the 25 mg 3qM dose. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Vutrisiran (also referred to as ALN-65492 or ALN-TTRSC02) is a second-generation ribonucleic acid 
interference (RNAi) therapeutic comprised of a synthetic, chemically modified, double-stranded, small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets transthyretin [TTR] messenger RNA (mRNA) in the 
liver and is being developed for the treatment of patients with TTR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR 
amyloidosis), with this application focusing on patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR 
amyloidosis) with polyneuropathy. 
Vutrisiran injection for subcutaneous use contains 50 mg/mL vutrisiran (free acid; equivalent to 53 
mg/mL vutrisiran sodium, ALN-65492), formulated in a buffered solution (10 mM phosphate buffer 
contained 110 mM sodium chloride). The clinical dose is a fixed dose of 25 mg administered as a 
subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 3 months (q3M). 
The target indication has been finally agreed as: 
• 
Treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients 
with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy 
The Applicant (Alnylam) has been recently granted (27/08/2018) an approval for Onpattro (patisiran) 
containing another double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), patisiran. The Applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022

developed the RNA silencing molecule vutrisiran with the same mechanism of action as patisiran for 
the reduction of both variant and wild-type TTR production in the liver. The formulation of vutrisiran 
allows an infrequent and easy to administer subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 3 months (q3M) 
via a prefilled syringe with passive needle safety system (PFS-S). Such a dosing regimen minimises the 
need for healthcare encounters, and it is certainly less burdensome to patients compared to an IV 
administration.  
The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis across the majority of the 
spectrum of disease was evaluated in two studies: a Phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-
controlled, single-ascending dose study and a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study in adult patients 
with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ALN-TTRSC02-002, HELIOS-A). Data from an external 
placebo group from the patisiran program (APOLLO study) were also used. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Vutrisiran drug product (DP) is a sterile, preservative-free, colourless to yellow solution of 50 mg/mL 
vutrisiran (free acid; equivalent to 53 mg/mL vutrisiran sodium, ALN-65492) formulated in a buffered 
solution of 10 mM sodium phosphate with 110 mM sodium chloride.  The DP formulation has been 
developed for the SC route of administration and was supplied in 2 primary container closure systems 
during Phase 3 clinical development:  
The clinical dose is a fixed dose of 25 mg administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 3 
months (q3M). 
Vial: a single-use Type I glass vial with bromobutyl fluoropolymer stopper and flip-off seal.  This 
presentation was used in the Phase 1 Study 001 and the 9-month primary efficacy period of HELIOS-A, 
the Phase 3 study.  
Prefilled syringe (PFS): a single-use Type I glass PFS equipped with a passive needle safety system 
(PFS-S).  This PFS-S presentation was introduced in HELIOS-A after completion of the 9-month efficacy 
period and is being used in the ongoing HELIOS-B study. 
Both the vial with syringe and a passive needle safety system (PFS-S) presentations contain the same 
DP formulation and are designed to deliver 0.5 mL vutrisiran DP solution (equivalent to 25 mg of 
vutrisiran).  The PFS-S presentation is the intended to-be-marketed presentation.   
Over the course of the clinical development of vutrisiran, there was a change in dosage strength and 
formulation to accommodate the Phase 3 dose of 25 mg.  This involved a decrease in the concentration 
of the drug substance from 165 mg/mL (Phase 1) to 50 mg/mL with the concomitant addition of 
excipients as buffers to maintain neutral pH. Importantly, the changes in dosage strength and 
formulation did not impact the quality and stability of vutrisiran DP.  In clinical studies (Study 001 and 
HELIOS-A), plasma exposure following administration of a 25 mg vutrisiran dose on Day 1 were 
comparable, confirming no impact of the change in dosage strength and formulation on the PK of 
vutrisiran.  Thus, a dedicated bioequivalence or bioavailability study was not considered necessary by 
the Applicant and has not been conducted.  Furthermore, the PK and PD of vutrisiran were not 
impacted by the change in DP presentation (vial with syringe versus PFS-S).  
The dose and dosing frequency for vutrisiran (25 mg q3M) were selected to achieve TTR reduction with 
minimal peak-to-trough fluctuation over the dosing interval.  There was a need for identifying a dosing 
regimen that would yield similar magnitude of TTR reduction, a similar PD effect, as observed with 
patisiran in the APOLLO study, and consequently expected to have similar clinical efficacy as patisiran.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 41/158 
 
 
 
Selection of the dosing regimen for vutrisiran was supported by TTR reduction data from the Phase 1 
Study 001 in healthy subjects.  Additionally, a PK/PD modeling approach was employed by the 
Applicant to characterize the dose-TTR reduction property of vutrisiran and determine the optimal 
dosing regimen for the Phase 3 studies in patients.  Adequacy of the selected Phase 3 dosing regimen 
was confirmed in the HELIOS-A study in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, where 
median steady-state trough TTR reduction of 85% was observed together with improvement of 
neurological disease manifestations at Month 9 (please see relevant Clinical Efficacy sections). 
The process for selecting the appropriate dosing regimen was based on identifying similar PD effects 
between vutrisiran and patisiran, which is considered appropriate. A similar magnitude of TTR 
reduction, a similar PD effect, as observed with patisiran in the APOLLO study, had to be identified 
which consequently was expected to have similar clinical efficacy as patisiran. Similar TTR reduction as 
patisiran was observed for vutrisiran in the phase 1 Study 001, in which dose dependent median 
maximum serum TTR reductions from baseline were shown. 25 mg vutrisiran administered q3M 
subcutaneously appeared to be a regimen that could yield similar TTR reduction as patisiran with 
acceptable safety, and was further evaluated in the Phase 3 study (HELIOS-A). A semi-mechanistic 
population PK/PD model was also developed. Based on this PK/PD modelling, the 25 mg q3M regimen 
of vutrisiran was predicted to provide sustained TTR reduction over the 3-month dosing interval similar 
to the observed TTR reduction profiles with intravenous 0.3 mg/kg q3w patisiran in the APOLLO study 
and it was well-tolerated. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors did not appear to influence the recommended 
fixed dose regimen of 25 mg q3M.  
It is noted, however, that a prefilled syringe equipped with a passive needle safety system (PFS-S) was 
used in HELIOS-A and it is intended for marketing. The phrase in section 4.2 of the SmPC “Therapy 
should be initiated under the supervision of a physician knowledgeable in the management of 
amyloidosis” is acknowledged.  It has been confirmed by the Applicant that dedicated human factor 
(HF) studies for self-administration have not yet been conducted with vutrisiran and therefore, the 
Notified Body Opinion included in the initial MAA a statement that ‘the device was designed for 
professional use only’. It is also confirmed that vutrisiran will be administered by a healthcare 
professional (HCP) only, and an appropriate statement has been included in the SmPC. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study 
The pivotal phase 3 study supporting vutrisiran was an open-label study with patisiran as the 
comparator (as a reference comparator) (HELIOS-A or ALN-TTRSC02-002). The results from this 
study were compared to an external placebo group from a previous patisiran Study ALN-TTR02-004 
(APOLLO) which was a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-bind, 
placebo controlled study in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. APOLLO study was the 
main study supporting the approval of Onpattro (patisiran). 
The clinical development program for vutrisiran is outlined in the following Figure 2:

Of note, for the regulatory submission in the US, the predefined primary analysis was performed at 
month 9, whereas for the EU, the primary analysis was performed at month 18. In the EU, during the 
scientific advice procedure, EMA/CHMP/SAWP indicated a preference for a marketing authorization 
application based upon 18 months data, as outlined later in the report. The first CSR for ALN-TTRSC02-
002 (Study 002 CSR1) presented the efficacy analysis at Month 9 and summarized available safety and 
efficacy data from the ongoing Treatment Period and Treatment Extension Period, with a data cut-off 
date of 10 November 2020 (refer to Study 002 CSR1). 
The second CSR for ALN-TTRSC02-002 (Study 002 CSR2) presents the Month 18 analysis of efficacy 
and summarizes available safety and efficacy data from the completed Treatment Period and ongoing 
Treatment Extension Period (which includes both the Legacy Treatment Extension Period and the 
Randomized Treatment Extension [RTE] Period described in Section 9.1), with a data cut-off date of 26 
August 2021.

Methods 
ALN-TTRSC02-002 (HELIOS-A) is an ongoing, global, Phase 3, randomized, open-label study 
designed to evaluate efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of vutrisiran in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
with polyneuropathy. The study is being conducted in 2 parts:   
-  18-month Treatment Period (hereafter referred to as “Treatment Period”), with the early 
efficacy analysis at Month 9; the Month 9 early analysis period is complete.  Data for 164 
patients (122 vutrisiran; 42 patisiran) are available as of the Month 9 data cut-off date (10 
November 2020). For Month 18, data for 164 patients (122 vutrisiran; 42 patisiran) are also 
available as of the data cut-off date 26 August 2021  
-  18-month Treatment Extension Period (which includes the Legacy Treatment Extension Period 
and the Randomised Treatment Extension Period), in which all patients will receive vutrisiran 
25 mg q3M or 50 q6M; as of the Month 9 data cut-off date, no patisiran-treated patients have 
entered the Treatment Extension Period. As of the Month 18 data cut-off date, 33 patisiran-
treated patients entered the Treatment Extension Period.

Period or at their next vutrisiran dosing visit in the Legacy Treatment Extension Period, depending on 
the timing of amendment approval and completion of the Month 18 efficacy visit. Patients complete the 
RTE Period in lieu of the Legacy Treatment Extension Period.

Study Participants 
HELIOS-A included adults age 18 (or age of legal consent, whichever is older) to 85 years of age, with 
a documented TTR mutation, and a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic hATTR amyloidosis with a 
Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5 to 130 (inclusive), Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score of 
≤3b and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥60%. 
The same key inclusion criteria were used in the APOLLO study, as well. It is noted that patients whose 
neuropathy may be too advanced to permit completion of the study were excluded from the study.  
Treatments 
Vutrisiran 25 mg SC injection is administered q3M (12 weeks ±3 days during the Treatment Period and 
±7 days during the Treatment Extension Period). Vutrisiran is supplied for this study in two formats for 
SC administration: a vial for SC injection and, with the implementation of Amendment 1, a prefilled 
syringe with passive needle safety system (PFS-S). 
Patisiran 0.3 mg/kg IV infusion is administered q3w±3 days.  The amount (in mg) of study drug to be 
administered is determined based on the patient's weight (kg). Dosing is based on actual body weight.  
For patients weighing ≥100 kg, the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg.  All patients receive 
premedication with a corticosteroid (dexamethasone or equivalent), paracetamol, an H1 antagonist 
(diphenhydramine or equivalent), and an H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent) prior to patisiran 
administration to reduce the risk of injection-site reactions. Details on the required premedication are 
provided in the study protocol (refer to Study 002 CSR2 Appendix 16.1.1 Section 5.2.2.2). 
At Week 84, patients in the patisiran group are switched to vutrisiran treatment and receive the first 
vutrisiran dose.  The last dose of patisiran is at Week 81, and patients should receive treatment with 
vutrisiran 3 weeks later at Week 84 and thereafter q3M (12 weeks ±7 days) for the remainder of the 
study.  If a patient receiving patisiran is unable to complete the Month 18 efficacy visit at the study 
center due to COVID-19 before Week 84, they may transition to treatment with vutrisiran at Week 84 
or later.

Objectives 
HELIOS-A was designed to assess the efficacy of 25 mg vutrisiran administered q3M on neurologic 
impairment and other key clinical measures relevant to patients with hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy, including quality of life, ambulatory ability, nutritional status, and disability.   
Primary: 
• To determine the efficacy of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis by evaluating the effect on 
neurologic impairment 
Secondary: 
• To determine the efficacy of vutrisiran on quality of life, gait speed, neurologic impairment, 
nutritional status, and disability 
• To demonstrate the non-inferiority of vutrisiran compared to patisiran with respect to serum 
transthyretin (TTR) levels 
Exploratory: 
• To determine the effect of vutrisiran on: 
− Disability and nutritional status 
− Manifestations of cardiac amyloid involvement 
− Other assessment of neurologic impairment 
− Other assessments of quality of life 
− Disease stage 
− Performance of daily activities 
• To characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of vutrisiran and patisiran on serum TTR and 
vitamin A levels 
• To characterize plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) of vutrisiran and patisiran 
• To assess presence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) to vutrisiran and patisiran 
Safety: 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
The primary objective was demonstration of superiority on neurological impairment to an external 
placebo group that was used in a previous study of the other siRNA molecule, patisiran, developed by 
the same Applicant.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was the difference between vutrisiran and external placebo in the 
change from baseline to Month 18 (formally for EU) of the composite neuropathy impairment score 
(mNIS+7), a disease-specific composite measure of polyneuropathy.  mNIS+7 is considered a 
sensitive and reproducible measure of neuropathy progression which has been used as a primary 
endpoint in multiple clinical studies in hATTR amyloidosis including APOLLO.     
The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in Norfolk QoL-DN total score compared to 
placebo at Month 18 for EU.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 47/158 
 
 
 
For the US submission the change from baseline at Month 9 in mNIS+7 and in Norfolk QoL-DN total 
score, are key primary and secondary endpoint, respectively. Norfolk QoL-DN was included to support 
the clinical relevance of observed changes in mNIS+7.   
An additional endpoint 10-MWT at Month 9 and Month 18 assesses ambulatory ability and was chosen 
to further support the clinical benefit of vutrisiran.   
Exploratory endpoints addressed the effect of vutrisiran on nutritional status, disability, and cardiac 
disease manifestations, as well as the effect on additional clinical measures at Month 9.  At Month 18, 
nutritional status and disability endpoints were secondary.   
TTR reduction with vutrisiran compared to patisiran was evaluated and compared descriptively to the 
within study patisiran reference comparator; a formal non-inferiority comparison to patisiran was 
performed at Month 18 only.

aThe schedule of assessments for the Treatment Extension Period is provided in the study protocol (Study 002 
CSR2 Appendix 16.1.1). 
The Modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) is a validated comprehensive composite 
score that quantitates the wide range of motor, sensory, and autonomic neurologic impairment due to 
injury of large and small nerves in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (a minimum 
score of 0 points, representing no impairment and maximum of 304 points, representing maximal 
impairment). The higher the score the worse the condition of the patient. The mNIS+7 was developed 
by the Mayo Clinic group for use specifically in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy 
and it has been used in all the recent clinical studies performed in hATTR with polyneuropathy.  
Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy is another validated tool used in all of the studies in hATTR 
with polyneuropathy. The Norfolk QoL-DN is a comprehensive, patient-reported, health-related quality 
of life questionnaire that includes multiple domains pertinent to all aspects of the polyneuropathy in 
hATTR (with the lowest score -4 being the best possible QoL up to 136 being the worst QoL). Also in 
the case of Norfolk QoL-DN, the higher the score the worse the QoL of the patient. 
For both the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint the results at month 18 were also provided 
within the timeframe of this MAA procedure (please see Statistical methods and Results sections 
below).

The 10-meter walk test (10-MWT) measures the time it takes a patient to walk 10 meters and is 
expressed as gait speed (meters/second). Gait speed is indicative of vitality, with higher values being 
the better condition of the patient.  
Sample size 
Enrolment was planned for approximately 160 patients. The sample size of 160 patients is considered 
sufficient, taking into consideration prevalence and epidemiology of this orphan condition. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
164 adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were finally randomized 3:1 to 
vutrisiran or patisiran (122 vutrisiran and 42 patisiran). Patients were randomized at 57 study centers 
in 22 countries ranging from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. 
Randomization was stratified by TTR genotype (V30M vs. non-V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs. 
≥50).    
The randomisation 3:1 allowed more patients in the vutrisiran group and, at the same time, sufficient 
number of patients in the patisiran group to be able to perform meaningful comparisons. 
Statistical methods 
Study hypotheses 
The HELIOS-A study uses the placebo group of the APOLLO study as an external control for the 
primary, most secondary, and most exploratory efficacy analyses (at Month 18, formally for EU). 
For most inferentially-evaluated efficacy endpoints, the null hypothesis for the superiority comparison 
of vutrisiran vs placebo (APOLLO) is defined as follows:  
-  H0:   No difference between vutrisiran and placebo (APOLLO): difference (vutrisiran – placebo) = 0  
For the TTR percent reduction endpoint, the null hypothesis for the noninferiority comparison of 
vutrisiran vs patisiran (HELIOS-A) is defined as follows:  
-  H0:   Vutrisiran is inferior to patisiran (HELIOS-A): difference in median TTR reduction (vutrisiran – 
patisiran) ≤ -10% 
Multiple comparisons procedure 
Two different multiple comparisons procedures are specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP): 
- 
In the US, Japan, and Brazil, the overall family-wise error rate is controlled at α=0.05 for the 
primary and secondary endpoint hypothesis tests as follows:

In the EU, during its scientific advice procedure, the EMA/CHMP/SAWP indicated a preference for a 
marketing authorization application based upon 18 months data. Therefore, the Month 9 endpoints 
included in the US/Japan/Brazil multiple comparisons procedure (MCP) are not included in the MCP 
for the EU and other regions, where instead mNIS+7 change from baseline at Month 18 is 
considered the primary endpoint. The overall familywise error rate in the EU and other regions is 
controlled at α=0.05 for the primary and secondary endpoint hypothesis tests as follows:

Analysis of change from baseline in mNIS+7 and change from baseline in Norfolk QoL-DN total score at 
Month 18 (formally the primary and key secondary endpoint for EU). 
The primary analysis of change from baseline in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN total score at Month 18 
was conducted in the mITT population using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
including treatment, visit, genotype, age at symptom onset, categorical baseline NIS (except for NIS-
related endpoints) as categorical factors, baseline value as a continuous covariate, and treatment by 
visit interaction. All efficacy data collected regardless of whether before or after treatment 
discontinuation were included in the analysis, with the exception of data after initiation of local 
standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis or on/after the onset of a serious COVID-19 adverse event. 
Efficacy censoring rules for initiation of local standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis were defined as 
follows: 
• 
For the APOLLO study, assessments were censored (excluded from analysis) after initiation of any 
of the following:  
-  Orthotopic liver transplant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022  
Page 57/158 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Use of TTR stabilizing agents (eg, tafamidis, diflunisal) for >14 days 
• 
For the HELIOS-A study, the APOLLO censoring rules were applied. Additionally, assessments were 
censored after initiation of any of the following recently approved treatments: 
- 
- 
Any use of TTR-targeting anti-sense oligonucleotides (eg, inotersen) 
Any use for patisiran (applicable for the vutrisiran treatment group only) 
Missing/censored data were assumed to be missing at random (MAR).  
Furthermore, sensitivity and other analyses were conducted: 
•  Sensitivity analysis 1: Data after initiation of local standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis or 
on/after the onset of a COVID-19 SAE were included in the MMRM analysis. 
•  Sensitivity analysis 2: A propensity score was included as an additional covariate in the MMRM 
analysis. The propensity score was defined as the probability of being treated with vutrisiran as 
obtained from a logistic regression model of treatment group [vutrisiran; placebo (APOLLO)]. The 
logistic regression model included important baseline variables that cover potential differences 
between the APOLLO and HELIOS-A study populations. 
•  Sensitivity analysis 3: A pattern-mixture model (PMM) using the ANCOVA/MI method was applied 
under the assumption that missing at random (MAR) did not apply for patients with missing Month 
18 data after stopping study treatment or who died before Month 18 due to reasons unrelated to 
COVID-19.  
•  Other analysis 1: An analysis of the binary endpoint, i.e. percentage of patients improving from 
baseline, was performed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with stratification factor of 
genotype. 
•  Other analysis 2: The primary analysis was repeated on the Efficacy PP Population. 
Analysis of time-averaged trough TTR percent reduction through Month 18 
Time-averaged trough TTR percent reduction through Month 18 was defined as the average trough (ie, 
predose) TTR percent reduction from Month 6 to 18, which is the steady state period for both vutrisiran 
and patisiran. Only through TTR assessments meeting requirements described in the TTR PP Population 
definition were included. The Hodges-Lehmann method, stratified by previous TTR stabilizer use (yes 
vs no), where values within each stratum were first aligned by the within-stratum 1-sample Hodges-
Lehmann median, was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the median difference 
between the vutrisiran and patisiran groups in this study. Non-inferiority of vutrisiran (versus patisiran) 
was declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the median treatment difference in TTR percent 
reduction (vutrisiran - patisiran) in this study was greater than -10%. 
Sensitivity analyses using the same analysis method were conducted to compare the TTR percent 
reduction through Month 18 between the vutrisiran group from this study and the pooled patisiran 
group from this study and the APOLLO study.

Recruitment 
The study was initiated on 14 February 2019 (first patient/first dose). The Month 9 Primary Analysis 
has been completed with a data cut-off date of 10 November 2020 and the Month 18 a data cut-off 
date of 26 August 2021. Treatment has continued beyond the Month 18 timepoint and the study is 
ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
A protocol deviation plan was developed by the Sponsor for the assessment and classification of 
protocol deviations; this plan is stored in the Trial Master File. Major protocol deviations were defined 
as those that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data; 
or that may significantly affect a patient’s rights, safety and well-being. Deviations not classified as 
major were assigned as minor. Major protocol deviations were reviewed and approved by the Sponsor 
prior to the interim database lock for the analyses at Month 18. 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Study Participation 
In the vutrisiran group, 89 (73.0%) patients were reported to have had their study visits or dosing 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 9): 89 (73.0%) patients with a missed, delayed, or 
partially completed visit; 84 (68.9%) patients with any location change; and 17 (13.9%) patients with 
a missed or delayed dose. One (0.8%) patient in the vutrisiran group was discontinued from study 
treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic; this patient died due to COVID-19-related pneumonia. 
In the patisiran group, 21 (50.0%) patients were reported to have had their study visits or dosing 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 9): 21 (50.0%) patients with a missed, delayed, or 
partially completed visit; 15 (35.7%) patients with any location change; and 18 (42.9%) patients with 
a missed or delayed dose. One (2.4%) patient in the patisiran group was discontinued from study 
treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic; this patient died due to COVID-19-related pneumonia.

Outcomes and estimation 
mNIS+7 at Month 9  
The mNIS+7 is a composite measure of neurologic impairment. Higher scores represent a greater 
severity of disease. The mNIS+7 was assessed at baseline, Month 9, and Month 18. At Month 9, the 
vutrisiran group showed an improvement in neuropathy compared to baseline (LS mean change from 
baseline: -2.24 points) while the placebo (APOLLO) group showed a worsening of neuropathy (LS 
mean change from baseline: +14.76 points). This represents a statistically significant improvement in 
neuropathy at 9 months for patients in the vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group (LS mean 
difference between groups: -17.00 points, P=3.542 × 10-12).

The Norfolk QoL-DN is a standardized quality of life questionnaire designed to measure the perception 
of the effects of polyneuropathy by the patient. Lower scores indicate a higher quality of life. Norfolk 
QoL-DN was assessed at baseline, Month 9, and Month 18. 
At Month 9, the vutrisiran group showed an improvement in quality of life compared to baseline (least 
squares [LS] mean change from baseline: -3.3 points) while the placebo (APOLLO) group showed a 
worsening in quality of life (LS mean change from baseline: +12.9 points) (see Table 17). This 
represents a statistically significant improvement in quality of life at 9 months for patients in the 
vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group (LS mean difference between groups:  -16.2 points, 
P=5.426 × 10-9).

10-MWT, Change from Baseline at Month 9 
The 10-MWT is a measure of ambulatory ability and gait speed.  An increase in gait speed from 
baseline represents improvement, and a decrease from baseline represents worsening. 10-MWT was 
assessed at Baseline, Month 9 and Month 18.  
At Month 9, the vutrisiran group showed stable ambulatory function compared to baseline as measured 
by 10-MWT (LS mean change from baseline: -0.001 m/s) while the placebo (APOLLO) group showed a 
worsening of 10-MWT (LS mean change from baseline: -0.133 m/s) (see Table 19). This represents a 
statistically significant improvement in gait speed at 9 months for patients in the vutrisiran group 
compared to the placebo group (LS mean difference between groups:  0.131 m/s, P=3.103 × 10-5).

mBMI 
The mBMI is calculated as the product of BMI multiplied by the concentration of serum albumin. mBMI 
was assessed at Baseline, Day 85, Day 169, Month 9, Day 337, Day 421, Day 505, and Month 18. An 
increase in mBMI from baseline suggests improvement in the nutritional status, and a decrease from 
baseline suggests worsening of the nutritional status. 
At Month 18, the vutrisiran group in HELIOS-A showed an improvement in mBMI compared to baseline 
(LS mean change from baseline: 25.0 kg/m2 × albumin g/L) while the placebo group in APOLLO 
showed a worsening of nutritional status (LS mean change from baseline: -115.7 kg/m2 × albumin 
g/L), representing an improvement favoring vutrisiran of 140.7 kg/m2 × albumin g/L; P=4.159 × 10-
15 (see Table 21).

R-ODS 
The Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) is a patient-reported measure of level of disability on 
a scale of 0-48, with 0 being the worst and 48 the best (no limitations); scores are based on activities 
of daily living and social participation. R-ODS was assessed at baseline, Month 9, and Month 18. 
At Month 18, the LS mean change from baseline in R-ODS was -1.5 points for the vutrisiran group 
compared to -9.9 points for the placebo group (Table 14 below and Figure 14 in the responses). 
According to the Applicant, this represents a statistically significant improvement in disability at 18 
months for patients in the vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group (LS mean difference 
between groups: 8.4 points; P=3.541× 10-15). These improvements with vutrisiran treatment were 
observed as early as Month 9 (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.2.1.5.1 and Figure 14 in the responses).

Exploratory Endpoint 
NT-proBNP 
Cardiac amyloid is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to signs and symptoms of 
worsening congestive heart failure, diminished exertional capacity, and ultimately death from heart 
failure or arrhythmia.   
Serum levels of cardiac biomarkers, including NT-proBNP, troponin T, and troponin I, were used to 
assess cardiac stress and heart failure severity. These cardiac biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 
Day 85, Day 169, Month 9, Day 337, Day 421, Day 505, and Month 18. In addition, NT-proBNP, was 
assessed at Screening.

Stabilisation of the NT-proBNP levels in vutrisiran-treated patients (0.939-fold change in the mITT or 
0.946-fold change in the cardiac subpopulation) as opposed to a clear increase in the placebo group in 
APOLLO (1.956-fold and 1.927-fold change in the mITT and the cardiac subpopulation, respectively) is 
suggestive of a beneficial cardiac effect. The adjusted geometric fold change ratio (vutrisiran/placebo)

for the cardiac subpopulation was 0.491 (p = 0.0004). However, it has been noted that the placebo 
group in APOLLO was in worse disease condition and had a higher degree of cardiac involvement. 
Despite the redefinition of the cardiac subpopulation in HELIOS-A and the baseline differences between 
HELIOS-A and APOLLO, the magnitude of effect of vutrisiran on NT-proBNP is considered similar to that 
of patisiran obtained in APOLLO. At month 18, geometric mean NT-proBNP decreased to 544.06 ng/L in 
the patisiran-LNP group and increased to 1116.75 ng/L in the placebo group. At 18 months, the 
adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline was 0.89 with Onpattro and 1.97 with placebo (ratio, 0.45; 
p < 0.001). 
Echocardiographic parameters  
For the Month 18 analysis, select echocardiogram parameters were re-read due to a staffing change at 
the central reading site that introduced a potential source of bias impacting the comparison of baseline 
versus follow-up echocardiogram data. Based on the new measurements for baseline LV wall thickness, 
the Cardiac Subpopulation was re-derived. As a result, 7 patients receiving vutrisiran were added to 
the Cardiac Subpopulation and 2 were removed compared to the population defined in the Month 9 
analysis. 
For prespecified echocardiographic parameters, the difference between vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) and 
placebo (APOLLO) treatment in the change from baseline at Month 18 was analyzed using an MMRM 
method in the mITT Population. The echocardiographic parameters analyzed included measures of 
cardiac structure (mean LV wall thickness, LV mass) and systolic function (global longitudinal strain, 
cardiac output), and measures related to diastolic function (LV end diastolic volume). Decreases in LV 
wall thickness, LV mass, and global longitudinal strain and increases in end diastolic volume and 
cardiac output represent improvements. Overall, the results in the vutrisiran and patisiran groups at 
Month 18 are comparable (Table 24).

The effect of vutrisiran on serum TTR levels and the resultant impact on neuropathy was accompanied 
by a benefit on other exploratory endpoints evaluating measures impacted by the underlying disease 
including neuropathy (NIS), and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) (see Table 25). Collectively, these 
analyses indicated that vutrisiran stabilized disability progression, neuropathy impairment, and quality 
of life relative to the progression seen in placebo treated patients from the APOLLO study.

It should be noted that the LS mean differences are estimated from statistical models controlling for 
prespecified covariates and reflect the mean treatment differences for patients with “average” disease 
severity and baseline scores in the dataset. The HELIOS-A dataset was based on pooled HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran and APOLLO placebo data, while the APOLLO dataset was based on pooled patisiran and 
placebo data from APOLLO. The two datasets are not identical, with slightly different data distributions; 
therefore, the two fitted models, e.g., the relationship between the outcome and covariates, had slight 
differences, which led to slightly different estimates. Overall, the estimated treatment effects are very 
similar for vutrisiran and patisiran. 
In addition, even though the study was not designed to include formal comparisons of efficacy for 
these groups, the following Table 28 includes post hoc analysis of key efficacy parameters using 
mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) for the within-study comparison of vutrisiran and 
patisiran groups of the HELIOS-A study, at Month 9 and Month 18. Overall, the HELIOS-A patisiran arm 
showed similar results as the vutrisiran arm.

Serum TTR (Exploratory Endpoint through Month 9 and Secondary through Month 18) 
Reductions in serum TTR observed at Month 9 with vutrisiran treatment were sustained through Month 
18 (in the Responses to Day 120 LoQ: Figure 1 in Q59b and Figure 3 in Q59a). 
The time-averaged trough TTR percent reduction through Month 18 was 84.7% for vutrisiran and 
80.6% for patisiran (Table 29Table 29 below). The Applicant concluded that vutrisiran demonstrated 
non-inferiority compared to within-study patisiran as the 95% CI of the median treatment difference in 
TTR percent reduction (vutrisiran – patisiran) was 1.17, 9.25, in which its lower limit was above -10%. 
Mean TTR percent change from baseline over time for the vutrisiran and patisiran groups is presented 
in the following Table 29 and Figure 9.

In the APOLLO study, the patisiran group demonstrated a mean TTR percent reduction from baseline of 
82.6% and 84.3% at Month 9 and Month 18, respectively. TTR percent reduction was maintained over 
the duration of the APOLLO study. 
In HELIOS-A at Month 9, the reductions of TTR are similar or even slightly greater with vutrisiran than 
with patisiran and are in the order of 78-82%. Peak to trough fluctuation was greatly reduced for the 
vutrisiran group (∆=1.72%) compared to the patisiran group (∆=6.80%). However, a formal 
comparison of the TTR percent reduction between the vutrisiran and patisiran groups at Month 9 was 
not performed in HELIOS-A. 
At Month 18 the reduction in serum TTR levels with vutrisiran (84.67%) was determined to be non-
inferior to the within-study patisiran arm (80.60%) based on the pre-specified criteria [Median 
Difference (95% CI) 5.28 (1.17, 9.25), non-inferiority confirmed if 95% lower CI > -10%], despite the 
greater fluctuation in the vutrisiran arm. Average TTR reduction at steady state was very similar 
between the two treatment groups: Mean (SD) 81.37 (18.84) for vutrisiran and 79.68 (11.71) for 
patisiran and Median (min, max) was 86.88 (-29.0, 98.1) for vutrisiran and 81.51 (37.2, 94.2) for 
patisiran.

Exploratory endpoints related to staging of polyneuropathy 
FAP Stage, PND Score, and KPS Score 
According to the Applicant the benefit of treatment with vutrisiran was also seen across the exploratory 
endpoints of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) stage, polyneuropathy disability (PND) score, and 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score. PND score and FAP stage are frequently used to classify 
the severity of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and are based largely on ambulatory 
ability. KPS is an assessment of functional status. 
FAP Stage 
At Month 18, 7 (5.7%) patients in the vutrisiran group and 22 (28.6%) patients in the placebo group 
had missing FAP stages (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.2.4.8, please see Q60). Among the patients with 
FAP stage data available at Month 18, 101 (82.8%) patients in the vutrisiran group and 34 (44.2%) 
patients in the placebo group had a stable FAP stage compared to baseline (Study 002 CSR2 Table 
14.2.4.8). Five (4.1%) patients in the vutrisiran and no patients in the placebo group had an 
improvement in FAP stage relative to baseline. Nine (7.4%) patients in the vutrisiran group had a 
worsening in FAP stage relative to baseline compared to 21 (27.3%) patients in the placebo group. 
PND Score 
At Month 18, 7 (5.7%) patients in the vutrisiran group and 22 (28.6%) patients in the placebo group 
had missing PND scores (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.2.4.6). Among the patients with PND score data 
available at Month 18, 82 (67.2%) patients in the vutrisiran group and 23 (29.9%) patients in the 
placebo group had stable PND scores compared to baseline (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.2.4.6). Thirteen 
(10.7%) patients in the vutrisiran group and no patients in the placebo group had an improvement in 
PND score relative to baseline. Twenty (16.4%) patients in the vutrisiran group had a worsening in 
PND score relative to baseline compared to 32 (41.6%) patients in the placebo group. 
KPS Score 
At Month 18, 71 (58.2%) patients in the vutrisiran group had a stable KPS stage compared to baseline 
(Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.2.4.12). Sixteen (13.1%) patients in the vutrisiran group had an 
improvement in KPS score relative to baseline. KPS was not collected post-baseline in APOLLO, so the 
APOLLO placebo group is not featured in this analysis. 
Data for FAP stage 3 patients receiving treatment with an RNAi therapeutic is available from patisiran 
Study 006, which is an ongoing, open-label, extension study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of long-term patisiran dosing in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy who 
have completed a prior patisiran study. Patients in this study have completed “parent” Study ALN-
TTR02-003 (Study 003) or ALN-TTR02-004 (Study 004). 
At entry into Study 006, a total of 16 patients had progressed to FAP stage 3, including 8 patients in 
the 004 Placebo group and 8 patients in the 004 Patisiran group; no patients in the 003 Patisiran group 
were FAP stage 3 at Study 006 baseline. Among the FAP stage 3 patients who had post-baseline 
measurements in Study 006, the overall clinical picture suggests relative stability over time in 
measures of neuropathy impairment (mNIS+7, Figure 10 below).

Patisiran patients started treatment 18 months before Year 0 in Study 006; 004 Placebo patients 
started treatment at Year 0 in Study 006. mNIS+7 range is 0 to 304 points; lower scores indicate less 
severe disease. 
With respect to FAP stage 3, only one patient with stage 3 was recruited, and this was in the placebo 
group in APOLLO. There were no stage 3 patients recruited in HELIOS-A (please see tables below). As 
the Applicant states, among the patients with FAP stage data available at Month 18, in the vutrisiran 
group 101 (82.8%) patients had a stable FAP stage, five (4.1%) patients had an improvement and 
nine (7.4%) patients had a worsening in FAP stage compared to baseline. In the placebo group 34 
(44.2%) patients had a stable FAP stage, no patients had an improvement and 21 (27.3%) patients 
had a worsening in FAP stage relative to baseline.

Ancillary analyses 
Additional (pre-specified) sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint (mNIS+7) were performed 
using the mITT population using the following methods: 
•  ANCOVA including mNIS+7 without censoring of patients following use of alternative treatment 
or on/after the onset of a serious COVID-19 AE 
• 
Propensity score approach: propensity score was an analysis covariate in the ANCOVA. The 
propensity score was defined as the probability of being treated with vutrisiran as obtained 
from a logistic regression model of treatment group [vutrisiran; placebo (APOLLO)]. The 
logistic regression model included the following baseline variables:  Continuous variables [NT-
proBNP (log-transformed), mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN total score] and Categorical variables 
{Previous tetramer stabilizer use (tafamidis/diflunisal) [Yes; No], Karnofsky Performance 
Status (KPS) [60; 70-80; 90-100], Cardiac Subpopulation [Yes; No], PND score [I; II; IIIA; 
IIIB/IV], Age at hATTR Symptom onset [< 50; ≥ 50], Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) [< 
50; ≥ 50], Genotype [V30M; non-V30M] and FAP stage [I; II/III]}.

Additional (pre-specified) sensitivity analyses were also performed for Norfolk QoL-DN and 10-MWT at 
Month 9 and at Month 18. 
See Module 2.7.3 Summary of Clinical Efficacy for a detailed description of these analyses. 
The various sensitivity analyses are briefly outlined below (refer to HELIOS-A, Study 002, CSR2 Table

Component Analysis of mNIS+7  
The mNIS+7 components assess motor strength (Neuropathy Impairment Score-weakness [NIS-W]), 
reflexes (NIS-reflexes [NIS-R]), sensation (quantitative sensory testing [QST]), nerve conduction 
(nerve conduction studies sum of five attributes [Σ5 NCS]), and sympathetic nerve autonomic function 
(postural blood pressure [BP]). For each of these components, higher scores represent a greater 
severity of disease. At Month 18, a consistent improvement compared to placebo (APOLLO) was 
observed for vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) across all of the mNIS+7 components (see Figure 11).

mNIS+7, Sensitivity analysis  
The result of the sensitivity analysis using a propensity score as a covariate in the ANCOVA is 
presented in the following Table 32 (from Table 14.2.2.2.1 of HELISO-A CSR) and is similar to the 
result of the primary analysis. Although a propensity score was included as a covariate in the analysis 
model, it may not capture all the differences (e.g. unmeasured/unrecognized factors) between the

groups. Furthermore, only patients with non-missing/non-censored data at Month 9 were included in 
the analysis and missing data were not imputed. The analysis population does not represent the 
initially randomized population. Therefore, this analysis could only be considered as supportive.

Additional (prespecified) sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint (mNIS+7) were performed using 
the Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population (Table 33). All sensitivity analyses resulted in a 
consistent estimate of the treatment effect of vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) compared to placebo (APOLLO) on 
mNIS+7 at Month 18, confirming the robustness of the primary Month 18 analysis.

Binary analysis 
The number and percentage of patients with a change from baseline at Month 18 in mNIS+7 <0 
(decrease or improvement) and ≥0 points was compared between the vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) and 
placebo (APOLLO) groups. 
In the vutrisiran group, 48.3% of patients showed an improvement of neuropathy at Month 18 (change 
from baseline in mNIS+7 <0) as compared to 3.9% of placebo patients (odds ratio of 22.9; 95% CI: 
6.8, 76.9) (Table 6 in the Responses to Day 120 LoQ). 
Subgroup analyses of mNIS+7 
Patients receiving vutrisiran experienced similar improvements relative to placebo (APOLLO) in 
mNIS+7 at Month 18 across all subgroups including age, sex, race, region, baseline NIS score, 
genotype, previous tetramer stabilizer use, disease stage, and cardiac subpopulation. Subgroup data 
are summarized in Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.2.3.1.2. A numerically larger improvement relative to 
placebo was observed in patients from North America compared to other regions.

Genotype 
The effect of vutrisiran was further evaluated across different genotypes.Treatment with vutrisiran 
resulted in improvements in mNIS+7 at Month 18 regardless of variant type. As several of these 
Assessment report

variants are endemic to certain regions, this analysis further supports the consistency of effect across 
regions shown in Figure 12 above. 
Both the component and the subgroup analyses, as well as across different genotypes (despite the 
small number of some subgroups or genotypes) favoured vutrisiran versus placebo. These results can 
be supportive of the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.  
Sensitivity Analyses of Norfolk QoL-DN 
Additional (pre-specified) sensitivity analyses on the secondary endpoint (Norfolk QoL-DN) were 
performed using the mITT Population (Table 34). All sensitivity analyses resulted in a consistent 
estimate of the treatment effect of vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) compared to placebo (APOLLO) on Norfolk 
QoL-DN at Month 18, confirming the robustness of the primary Month 18 analysis. 
The sensitivity analysis related to the potential impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) on 
quality of life and Norfolk QoL-DN is summarized in Section 2.9 in the responses.

Norfolk QoL-DN Domain Analysis 
The Norfolk QoL-DN consists of 5 domains (range of possible scores) which include: physical 
functioning/large fiber (-4 to 56 points), activities of daily living (0 to 20 points), symptoms (0 to 32 
points), small fiber (0 to 16 points), and autonomic (0 to 12 points. For each of these domains, a lower 
score indicates a better quality of life.  
At Month 18, a consistent improvement compared to placebo (APOLLO) was observed for vutrisiran 
(HELIOS-A) across all of the Norfolk QoL-DN domains (see Figure 13).

Genotype 
The effect of vutrisiran was evaluated across different genotypes and improvements were observed in 
Norfolk QoL-DN regardless of the individual variant. As several of these mutations are endemic to 
certain regions, this analysis could further support the consistency of effect across regions. 
Other Analysis: Binary Endpoint 
The number and percentage of patients with a change from baseline to Month 18 in 10-MWT >0 m/s 
and ≤0 m/s at Month 18 was compared between the vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) and placebo (APOLLO) 
groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 97/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the vutrisiran group, 49.2% of patients showed an improvement in gait speed at Month 18 (change 
from baseline in 10-MWT >0 m/s) as compared to 13.0% of placebo patients (odds ratio of 7.2, 95% 
CI: 3.3, 15.8) (Table 12 in the Day120 LoQ Responses). 
Additional analyses of hypothetical estimand and treatment policy estimand based on the 
“true” mITT population 
The Applicant was requested to provide the primary analysis (the primary hypothetical estimand) and 
the sensitivity analysis (the treatment policy estimand) performed on the “true” mITT population, 
using appropriate missing data handling strategies for the clinical efficacy endpoints included in the 
confirmatory testing hierarchy (mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL-DN, 10-MWT, mBMI and R-ODS at Month 18). 
The Applicant, as requested, provided two additional PMM analyses which were slightly different from 
the PMM analysis prespecified in the SAP Version 3.0 Section 4.4.2.3: 
• 
• 
PMM corresponding to the primary hypothetical estimand: assessments after initiation of local 
standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis or on or after onset of a serious COVID-19 AE were 
set as missing before multiple imputation. 
PMM corresponding to the treatment policy estimand: assessments after initiation of local 
standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis or on or after onset of a serious COVID-19 AE were 
included in the model without imputation. 
The results from MMRM and two PMM methods are summarised in Table 35 from the responses 
provided over the course of the assessment. The additional analyses were consistent with the 
prespecified primary MMRM analysis, showing there was little difference between the estimates of 
treatment effect based upon the two PMM methods or MMRM analyses for the primary, but also for the 
secondary endpoints.

The Clinical Study Report 1 (CSR1) provides an analysis of the Month 9 data with 
a data cut-off date of 10 November 2020. 0. The confirmatory primary analysis of 
the HELIOS-A study for EU was performed at Month 18 as in the case of APOLLO 
study and results were provide with CSR2 with a cut-off date 26 August 2021.  
The cardiac subpopulation was redefined.

2.6.5.2.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Serum levels of the exploratory cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP over time were summarized using 
descriptive statistics for each visit, since NT-proBNP represents the key assessment informing impact 
on cardiac manifestations of the disease. However, the following efficacy assessments were performed: 
NIS, mNIS+7, heart rate variability with deep breathing (HRdb), 10-MWT, FAP and PND, KPS, 
echocardiogram. 
For the Month 9 and Month 18 analyses, the key assessment informing impact on cardiac 
manifestations of the disease was the cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP, which is used to assess cardiac 
stress and degree of heart failure. NT-proBNP was assessed at Screening, Baseline, Day 85, Day 169, 
Month 9 and Month 18.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 105/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
At Month 9, the geometric mean NT-proBNP levels remained stable in vutrisiran patients (0.99-fold 
change), while there was a worsening in NT-proBNP in placebo (APOLLO) patients with a 1.59-fold 
increase. 
It is noted that the exploratory cardiac biomarker endpoint, NT-proBNP, was evaluated in both the 
mITT population and the pre-specified cardiac subpopulation; vutrisiran treatment showed 
improvement compared to placebo. For the cardiac subpopulation at month 18, the geometric mean 
NT-proBNP levels for vutrisiran patients had a 0.94-fold change, while there was a worsening in NT-
proBNP in placebo (APOLLO) patients with a 1.96-fold increase and a ratio of 0.491 (p=0.0004). In the 
case of patisiran in APOLLO, similar results were obtained at 18 months, with an adjusted geometric 
mean ratio to baseline of 0.89 for Onpattro and 1.97 for placebo leading to a ratio of 0.45 (p < 0.001). 
However, this evaluation is not used for patient selection. Instead, the Applicant is conducting a 
separate clinical development program for patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, and a 
Phase 3 study of (ALN-TTRSC02-003; HELIOS-B), for which enrolment is ongoing, is currently in 
progress and remains blinded. 
2.6.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled analyses or a meta-analysis have not been performed.  
It is noted that the main efficacy and safety study, HELIOS-A, included a patisiran reference 
comparator group to establish similar TTR reduction between vutrisiran and patisiran, as well as to 
enable a descriptive comparison of clinical efficacy endpoints between the two treatment groups in 
HELIOS-A.  The reference comparator was also used to allow for a descriptive comparison of the 
patisiran group from HELIOS-A with the efficacy profile of patisiran based on the APOLLO study (ALN-
TTR02-004).

Not Applicable 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Vutrisiran is an RNAi therapeutic comprised of a synthetic, chemically modified, double-stranded small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets variant and wtTTR and silences TTR messenger RNA 
(mRNA).  This is accomplished by incorporation of vutrisiran siRNA into the cellular multiprotein 
enzyme cleavage complex known as the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). Reduction of both 
variant and wild type TTR production in the liver, which are the fundamental pathogenic proteins 
causing hATTR amyloidosis, will reduce ongoing deposition of amyloid deposits and potentially allow for 
clearance of existing deposits and consequently, halting or reversing disease progression. 
Previous clinical studies with mRNA silencing agents, such as patisiran, and the antisense 
oligonucleotide (ASO) inotersen, demonstrated that TTR reduction in patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
with polyneuropathy can have beneficial effects, measured by clinical endpoints evaluating disease 
manifestations and patient-reported outcomes. 
The indication applied for Amvuttra (vutrisiran) has been finally worded as: 
Treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with 
stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 106/158 
 
 
 
It is noted that the proposed indication for vutrisiran is the same as that for the approved product 
Onpattro (patisiran). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development program of vutrisiran consists of a safety and clinical pharmacology study 
assessing PD in healthy subjects (Study 001) and an open-label on-going Phase 3 study in adult 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ALN-TTRSC02-002, HELIOS-A), which evaluates 
the efficacy of vutrisiran, using patisiran as a reference comparator. An external placebo group was 
used from patisiran study ALN-TTR02-004 (APOLLO), which is a completed, Phase 3, multicenter, 
multinational, randomized, double-bind, placebo-controlled study in hATTR amyloidosis patients with 
polyneuropathy. APOLLO was a pivotal trial for the approval of Onpattro (patisiran).  
The clinical development program to support the indication and the design of the Phase 3 HELIOS-A 
study were discussed with multiple regulatory agencies, with scientific advice received from the US 
FDA (17 July 2018 [FDA PIND 139086]), European Union (EU) European Medicines Agency (EMA; 20 
September 2018 [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/615799/2018]), and Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices 
Agency (PMDA; 21 February 2019 [P5259, Notification number 0221001]). 
Design of the pivotal phase 3 study 
HELIOS-A is an ongoing, global, Phase 3, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate efficacy, 
safety, PK, and PD of vutrisiran in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.   
The open-label nature of the study would have been of concern in case a reference comparator had not 
been included in the study, and in case data would have not be available from the reference 
comparator, which has been developed by the same Applicant. In addition, two independent replicate 
assessments were performed, approximately 24 hours apart from each other but no greater than 7 
days apart.  
Patients were randomized 3:1 to vutrisiran 25 mg, administered as a SC injection q3M, or patisiran 0.3 
mg/kg, administered as an IV infusion q3w. The primary and most secondary and exploratory 
endpoints of the study evaluate the efficacy of vutrisiran by comparing to the placebo group of the 
Phase 3 patisiran APOLLO study. The study has been conducted in 2 parts: an 18-month Treatment 
Period, with an efficacy analysis at Month 9 and additional efficacy analyses at Month 18, followed by 
an 18-month Treatment Extension Period, in which all patients are treated with vutrisiran. For 
regulatory submissions in the US, the primary efficacy analysis was conducted at Month 9. Results for 
both the endpoint, mNIS+7 change from baseline at Month 9, and endpoint Norfolk QoL-DN total score 
change from baseline at Month 9, must be statistically significant (i.e., p-value ≤0.05) to declare a 
positive study. However, according to the specifications for EU in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), the 
analyses performed at month 18 are formally the confirmatory analyses. 
The TTR percent reduction through Month 18 was evaluated as the average trough TTR percent 
reduction from Month 6 to 18 which is the steady state period for both vutrisiran (ALN-TTRSC02) and 
patisiran. A method was used to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the median difference 
between vutrisiran (ALN-TTRSC02) and patisiran groups in this study, and non-inferiority was declared 
since the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference was greater than –10%.  
Formal non-inferiority testing of vutrisiran compared to patisiran with respect to serum TTR levels as a 
secondary endpoint was not performed at Month 9 (only descriptive). The Month 18 analyses were 
confirmatory of the non-inferiority of vutrisiran versus patisiran. Since both molecules were developed 
by the same Applicant and have the same mechanism of action, i.e. silencing of the TTR RNA, a non-
inferiority comparison versus patisiran based on a PD endpoint (measurement of the reduction of TTR 
protein), and the indirect comparison to the placebo arm of the patisiran APOLLO study, based on a

clinical endpoint, can be considered as a suitable approach. The objectives of the HELIOS-A study are, 
therefore, considered appropriate.   
The study was performed in 57 centers in 22 countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, 
Canada, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, 
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, UK, US. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria and baseline characteristics 
Patients between 18 to 85 years of age with a diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis, with documented TTR 
mutation, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5 to 130 (inclusive), Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) 
score of ≤3b and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥60% participated to study HELIOS-A. The 
key inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered appropriate for the investigation of efficacy of 
vutrisiran in adult patients with hATTR with polyneuropathy. Patients whose neuropathy may be too 
advanced to permit completion of the study were excluded from the study. This is acknowledged. It 
should also be noted that the participating patients had Polyneuropathy disability (PND) score of ≤3b 
and a corresponding FAP stage I or II. It is also noted that in the APOLLO study there was only 1 
patient with FAP stage 3 (in the placebo group) and in the HELIOS-A there were no patients in stage 3 
recruited. Similarly to HELIOS-A, the study population in the APOLLO study was limited to subjects 
with Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) Scores of 0-IIIB hATTR/FAP stage 1 and 2. Likewise, as 
mentioned in section 5.1 of the  SmPC for vutrisiran, “at baseline, 70% of patients had stage 1 disease 
(unimpaired ambulation; mild sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy in the lower limbs), and 
30% had stage 2 disease (assistance with ambulation required; moderate impairment of the lower 
limbs, upper limbs, and trunk)”. As a result, the proposed broad indication could not be considered 
acceptable.  
The unmet medical need for patients with hATTR and stage 3 polyneuropathy can definitely be 
acknowledged. However, there were no FAP stage 3 patients recruited in HELIOS-A (please see also 
efficacy data and additional analyses). Therefore, the Applicant restricted the indication, to represent 
the population included in the study (stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy).  
There were no dedicated studies performed in older subjects. The number of older patients included in 
the clinical efficacy and safety studies with this dossier are very limited. However, this can be 
attributed to the progress of the disease and the reduced survival of patients with hATTR. The 
Applicant provided the numbers of older subjects in a Table with information on clinical studies in 
special populations, especially for the groups 75-84 and above 85 years of age.  
Treatments 
Vutrisiran 25 mg, either as a vial or as a prefilled syringe with passive needle safety system (PFS-S) 
for SC injection, is administered q3M (12 weeks ±3 days during the Treatment Period and ±7 days 
during the Treatment Extension Period). SC administration of vutrisiran four times per year is certainly 
advantageous for patients when compared to IV administration of patisiran or weekly SC 
administration of inotersen. 
Furthermore, all (100%) of patisiran-treated patients received premedications prior to infusion. The 
once every 3 months (q3M) subcutaneous (SC) regimen with vutrisiran is infrequent, easy to 
administer, does not require premedication, and minimizes the need for healthcare encounters. The 
treatments used in the pivotal study HELIOS-A are either according to the approved posology and 
method of administration for patisiran, or are considered justified in the case of vutrisiran (please see 
below). It should be also noted that for vutrisiran four times per year administration is recommended, 
whilst for another approved treatment for hATTR (Tegsedi-inotersen) subcutaneous administrations are 
scheduled weekly.

The phrase in section 4.2 of the proposed SmPC “Therapy should be initiated under the supervision of 
a physician knowledgeable in the management of amyloidosis” was not initially considered sufficient. It 
was thought that more precision and more specific recommendations for the first administration should 
be included in the SmPC, in addition to the treatment decision by an experienced physician. However, 
it was later confirmed during the assessment that dedicated human factor (HF) studies for self- 
administration have not yet been conducted with vutrisiran; therefore, the Notified Body Opinion 
included in the initial MAA a statement that “the device was designed for professional use only”.  
It has also been confirmed that vutrisiran will be administered by a healthcare professional (HCP) only; 
thus an appropriate phrase has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the study is formally the difference between vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) and 
placebo (APOLLO) in the change from baseline to Month 9 for the US, and at Month 18 for the EU, of 
the composite neuropathy impairment score (mNIS+7), which is considered a disease-specific 
sensitive and reproducible composite measure of neuropathy progression. The mNIS+7 has been used 
in multiple clinical studies in hATTR amyloidosis including APOLLO. According to the scientific advice 
procedure (Procedure No. EMEA/H/SA/3876/1/2018/PA/III and the clarification letter) a preference for 
analyses of 18 months data was indicated. For EU and other regions, mNIS+7 change from baseline at 
Month 18 is considered the primary endpoint, and the relevant analyses have been submitted.    
An analysis for the change from baseline in Norfolk QoL-DN total score at Month 9 and at Month 18 
compared to placebo have also been presented. For the EU, the key secondary endpoint is the change 
from baseline in Norfolk QoL-DN score at Month 18. Norfolk QoL-DN is a comprehensive, patient-
reported, health-related quality of life questionnaire, and a useful tool used in all of the studies in 
hATTR with polyneuropathy. Norfolk QoL-DN was included to support the clinical relevance of observed 
changes in mNIS+7. 
The 10-meter walk test (10-MWT) was used as indicative of vitality. Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale 
(R-ODS) was used to investigate improvement in disability at 18 months and mBMI the nutritional 
status of patients. The impact of neuropathy (NIS) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) have been 
also investigated as exploratory endpoints. 
Demonstrating non-inferiority of vutrisiran, compared to patisiran in the HELIOS-A study, with regards 
to TTR reduction through Month 18 or a single clinical endpoint, in a direct comparison supplemented 
with pooled/indirect comparisons, was required to allow the appropriate use of the external placebo 
group from patisiran APOLLO data.  
All endpoints used in this study are considered appropriate for this patient population to provide useful 
information on the progression of hATTR or lack of it.  
Statistical methods 
According to the Applicant’s Day 120 Response, the primary estimand would target the treatment 
effect in a hypothetical scenario, that all patients do not initiate local standard treatment for hATTR 
amyloidosis and do not have a COVID-19 SAE (using a hypothetical strategy for these two intercurrent 
events). All assessments after initiation of local standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis, or the 
onset of a COVID-19 SAE, were excluded from the primary analysis. In addition, a sensitivity analysis 
including assessments after initiation of local standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis, or the onset 
of a COVID-19 SAE, was aimed to target the treatment effect irrespective of the initiation of local 
standard treatment for hATTR amyloidosis or the onset of a COVID-19 SAE (using a treatment policy 
strategy for these two intercurrent events). The Applicant further argued that the number of censored 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 109/158 
 
 
 
values is small, with minimum impact on the estimation of treatment effect, which was considered 
acceptable. 
While the proposed primary hypothetical estimand, complemented by the treatment policy estimand, is 
endorsed, the performed primary and sensitivity analyses at Month 18 using a mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) could not be fully accepted. Generally, these analyses were not performed 
on the pre-specified mITT population including all randomized patients who received any amount of 
study drug. Actually, patients without any post-baseline assessments (both Month 9 and Month 18 
assessments missing/censored), both in the vutrisiran and placebo groups, were excluded from the 
analyses. Missing/censored data should be imputed in alignment with the target estimands. MMRM 
handles missing data, implicitly based on a missing at random (MAR) assumption, which seems to be 
implausible in some cases. For example, initiation of alternative treatment may indicate lack of efficacy 
of study treatment and a poor outcome would be observed, had patients not received alternative 
treatment. Usually, it is also considered that patients who discontinued study treatment would no 
longer benefit from it, and would have trajectory similar to placebo patients. Based on a MAR 
assumption, however, missing data after discontinuation of study treatment, and censored data after 
initiation of alternative treatment, would be imputed using a mixture of collected data from patients 
who continued and discontinued study treatment (depending on the follow-up after treatment 
discontinuation) and did not initiate alternative treatment, which could not be considered appropriate.  
Hence, for the primary hypothetical estimand, while missing/censored data due to COVID-19 SAE could 
be considered MAR, missing/censored data after discontinuation of study treatment and/or initiation of 
local standard treatment should be imputed using values reflecting lack of efficacy. Considering the 
frequency and distribution of missing/censored data (more patients in the placebo group had 
missing/censored data as compared to the vutrisiran group), the placebo multiple imputation is 
considered appropriate for handling missing/censored data after discontinuation of study treatment, 
and/or initiation of local standard treatment, or missing data due to other reasons.  
For the treatment policy estimand, assessments after initiation of local standard treatment for hATTR 
amyloidosis or the onset of a COVID-19 SAE are included in the analysis, and missing data can 
generally be handled using the placebo multiple imputation.      
In summary, the primary analysis (the primary hypothetical estimand) and the sensitivity analysis (the 
treatment policy estimand) performed on the “true” mITT population, using appropriate missing data 
handling strategies, as discussed above, have been requested, and provided by the Applicant for the 
clinical efficacy endpoints included in the confirmatory testing hierarchy (mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL-DN, 10-
MWT, mBMI and R-ODS at Month 18).   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
With respect to the dosing regimen, the recommended 25 mg q3M regimen of vutrisiran achieves 
similar or slightly higher TTR reduction than patisiran. This magnitude of TTR reduction has been 
shown to result in favorable clinical outcomes across clinical studies of hATTR amyloidosis patients with 
polyneuropathy, including the APOLLO study, in the patisiran program. 
Collectively, the results of Study 001 and Study 002 (HELIOS-A), as well as pooled population PK, 
population PK/PD modeling, and disease progression analyses support the recommended vutrisiran 
dosing regimen of 25 mg administered q3M across all subgroups.   
It appears that this dosing regimen provides clinical benefit with an acceptable safety profile for 
treatment of all patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. No dose adjustment is 
necessary for any of the subpopulations.

In HELIOS-A, 164 adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were randomized 3:1 to 
vutrisiran or patisiran (122 vutrisiran and 42 patisiran). Randomization was stratified by TTR genotype 
(V30M vs. non-V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs. ≥50).  
The number of patients is considered sufficient to allow collection of useful information for both 
vutrisiran and patisiran group in the HELIOS-A study, and is very similar to the numbers of studies for 
other medicinal products recently approved for hATTR. The numbers from the APOLLO study have 
already been assessed and discussed during the approval procedure of Onpattro (patisiran) 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/onpattro).    
Efficacy data from HELIOS-A for the Month 9 early analysis timepoint (data cut-off date of 10 
November 2020), as well as for the Month 18 (data cut-off date of 26 August 2021), have been 
submitted. 
During the period of COVID-19 pandemic, a small number of protocol deviations were reported that are 
not considered to have an impact on patient safety or the overall interpretation of study results.  
It can be agreed that the deviations are not considered to have seriously affected patient safety or the 
overall interpretation of study results, taking into consideration the unique and difficult period of 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
Delayed assessments due to COVID-19 were included in the efficacy analyses of HELIOS-A, based on 
the Month 18 Efficacy PP Population using an MMRM model. Only a few number of patients had a 
missed or delayed dose of vutrisiran [17 and only 1 (0.8%) patient had a missed dose], or had their 
Month 18 efficacy visit impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (13). It can be agreed that the mitigation 
efforts promptly implemented by the Applicant to address potential trial risk due to the COVID-19 
pandemic successfully ensured continued administration of study drug and collection of study data, 
thus minimizing impact of the pandemic on study conduct. A GCP inspection is not considered 
necessary. The results of additional analyses for mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN were consistent with the 
primary Month 18 analysis, supporting that the impact on the conclusions of HELIOS-A was negligible 
from the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Furthermore, the Applicant´s argument that the adverse impact on patients from the COVID-19 
pandemic could potentially result in an underestimate of treatment effects of HELIOS-A vutrisiran, as 
compared to the placebo arm from the APOLLO study, which was conducted in the pre-COVID-19 era, 
is quite valid. 
It is clearly noted that the disease characteristics of the patients are worse in the placebo group of the 
APOLLO study compared to HELIOS-A. The percentage of patients with NIS ≥50 was 54.6% in the 
APOLLO compared to 34.6% in HELIOS-A. The percentage of patients with low Karnofsky Performance 
Status (KPS) percentage score of 60 (indicative of lower ambulatory function) was 28.6% in APOLLO 
versus 13.9% in HELIOS-A. Furthermore, the patients in the placebo group in APOLLO had clearly a 
higher cardiac involvement of the disease. In HELIOS-A study 55.7%, 9.0% and 35.2% of patients had 
no heart failure, NYHA I and NYHA II, respectively, whilst in APOLLO 51.9% had NYHA I and 46.8% 
had NYHA II. It is noted that in the APOLLO study, NYHA class was graded I through IV and “no heart 
failure” was not an option; thus, in this study, patients classified as NYHA class I included both those 
without heart failure and those with asymptomatic heart failure.  
APOLLO population was older, with more advanced disease as per NIS, Norfolk QoL, or 10MWT and 
virtually all patients had heart failure and a lower mBMI: either leaner or deproteinised. The Applicant 
discussed, within the Responses to Day 120 LoQ, the impact of the observed baseline differences 
(APOLLO placebo and HELIOS-A vutrisiran) on study results and the validity of the evaluation of the 
effect of vutrisiran versus external placebo.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 111/158 
 
 
 
It can be agreed that the clinical course of the placebo group in hATTR amyloidosis clinical studies and 
the natural history study at different study periods (1997-2017) is similar, with a change from baseline 
in mNIS+7 ranging from 11.20 to 17.80 (with study durations 8 months to 1 year), and a change in 
NIS at 1 year of 12.50. Similar values were also obtained in the change from baseline for Norfolk QoL-
DN in APOLLO (7.50) and Inotersen Phase 3 study (6.95) at 9 and 8 months, respectively. 
It can also be agreed that the baseline differences in between HELIOS-A vutrisiran and APOLLO 
placebo patients are largely overlapping.  It is noted that the Applicant has access to individual patient 
data in APOLLO, which allows for the impact of baseline differences to be understood and well 
accounted for, and also enables adjustment for baseline values and key prognostic factors in the 
treatment comparison. 
The above differences are also a reason why more weight is put on the formal non-inferiority testing of 
the vutrisiran group versus the within-study control group of patisiran regarding TTR reduction or a 
direct comparison of one of the clinical parameters (preferably mNIS+7) at Month 18. Such a non-
inferiority comparison of the vutrisiran group to the within-study control group of patisiran was 
informative, as anticipated. The relevant analyses have been provided by the Applicant.  
From the results at month 9, a large improvement in neuropathy was observed for patients in the 
vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group, with a LS mean difference of the mNIS+7 change 
from baseline between groups of -17.00 points. In addition, a noticeable difference in improvement in 
quality of life at 9 months for patients in the vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group with a LS 
mean difference between groups in Norfolk QoL-DN change from baseline of -16.2 points occurred.  
For mNIS+7, 50.4% of patients in the vutrisiran group showed an improvement of neuropathy (change 
from baseline mNIS+7 <0 points) at Month 9 compared to 18.2% of placebo (APOLLO) patients. For 
Norfolk QoL-DN, 53.4% of patients in the vutrisiran group had an improvement (<0-point LS mean 
change) at Month 9 compared to 23.4% of placebo patients. 
The efficacy was maintained at Month 18. For the primary endpoint of modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) a statistically significant, large and clinically meaningful difference in 
the change from baseline at Month 18 was observed between vutrisiran in HELIOS-A and placebo in 
APOLLO with a treatment difference, LS Mean (95% CI) of -28.55 (-34.00, -23.10). Pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses with no censoring, propensity score and pattern-mixture model showed consistent 
and supportive results with the primary analysis, with treatment differences, LS Mean (95% CI) of -
27.04 (-32.57, -21.51), -27.83 (-33.46, -22.20) and -29.30 (-35.36, -23.23), respectively. 
Component (all components), binary (48.3% of patients in vutrisiran compared to 3.9% of placebo 
patients) and subgroup (all subgroups including age, sex, race, region, baseline NIS score, genotype, 
previous tetramer stabilizer use, disease stage, and Cardiac Subpopulation) analyses for mNIS+7 
showed improvement of neuropathy at Month 18 in support of the primary analysis. 
Similarly, for the key secondary endpoint Norfolk QoL-DN, a statistically significant, large and clinically 
meaningful difference in the change from baseline at Month 18 was observed between vutrisiran in 
HELIOS-A and placebo in APOLLO with a treatment difference, LS Mean (95% CI) of -21.0 (-27.1, -
14.9). Pre-specified sensitivity analyses with no censoring, propensity score and pattern-mixture model 
showed consistent and supportive results with the primary analysis, with treatment differences, LS 
Mean (95% CI) of -20.9 (-26.8, -14.9), -21.9 (-28.2, -15.5) and -24.1 (-30.9, -17.3), respectively. 
As in the case of the primary endpoint, mNIS+7, also for the key secondary endpoint Norfolk QoL-DN 
domain (all domains), binary (56.8% of patients in vutrisiran compared to 10.4% of placebo patients) 
and subgroup (all subgroups including age, sex, race, region, baseline NIS score, genotype, previous 
tetramer stabilizer use, disease stage, and Cardiac Subpopulation) analyses showed improvement of 
neuropathy at Month 18 in support of the primary analysis. 
Assessment report

Supportive efficacy results were obtained at Month 9 with 10-meter walk test (10-MWT) (LS mean 
difference of 0.131), which is a measure of ambulatory ability and gait speed. However, the Applicant 
was requested to provide the respective value for the improvement with patisiran in APOLLO, and to 
discuss the clinical meaningfulness of the small difference between vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) and placebo 
group (APOLLO).  Since a mean increase of 0.10 m/s can represent a clinically meaningful change in 
gait speed, and since 0.10 m/s decrements of baseline gait speed were associated with incremental 
decreases in survival in adults aged 65 years or older, an LS mean difference of 0.131 m/s (95% CI: 
0.071, 0.191) improvement in gait speed at Month 9 for patients between the vutrisiran group in 
HELIOS-A, compared to the APOLLO placebo group, can be considered clinically relevant, albeit small.  
For the 10-MWT, there was also a statistically significant improvement in gait speed at 18 months for 
patients in the vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group with a LS mean difference between 
groups (95% CI): 0.239 m/s; P=1.207 × 10-7 (0.154, 0.325). In the vutrisiran group, 49.2% of 
patients showed an improvement in gait speed at Month 18 (change from baseline in 10-MWT >0 m/s) 
as compared to 13.0% of placebo patients (odds ratio of 7.2, 95% CI: 3.3, 15.8) (HELIOS-A Clinical 
Study Report ALN-TTRSC02-002 CSR2). 
At Month 9, the vutrisiran group demonstrated a 7.6 unit LS mean increase (improvement) in mBMI, 
while a -60.2 unit LS mean decline (worsening) was seen in the placebo (APOLLO) group, indicating an 
improvement in nutritional status for vutrisiran-treated patients compared to placebo, and suggesting 
that treatment with vutrisiran effectively halted the expected decline in mBMI. A statistically significant 
improvement in mBMI was maintained at 18 months for patients in the vutrisiran group compared to 
the placebo group with a LS mean difference between groups (95% CI): 140.7 kg/m2 × albumin g/L; 
P=4.159 × 10-15 (108.4, 172.9), demonstrating a higher nutritional status. This is considered a 
relevant aspect in hATTR, since it expresses the improvement on dysautonomia, which can impact the 
patient more than the loss of sensation and partially the motor function. 
A statistically significant improvement in disability at 18 months for patients in the vutrisiran group 
compared to the placebo group with a LS mean difference between groups (95% CI): 8.4 points; 
P=3.541× 10-15, (6.5, 10.4) was recorded for R-ODS. 
For the other exploratory endpoints: neuropathy (NIS), and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS) 
statistically significant differences were observed at Month 18 favoring vutrisiran compared to placebo.   
Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses have been performed, which are supportive of the beneficial 
effects of vutrisiran. Effects observed across all mNIS+7 components favour vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) 
compared to placebo (APOLLO) and across all patient subgroups, with an effect seen across the full 
range of baseline neuropathy severity and across different genetic variants. Consistent improvement 
favouring vutrisiran in HELIOS-A relative to placebo (APOLLO) across all Norfolk QoL-DN domains and 
across all patient subgroups were recorded.  
Of the 122 patients randomized to vutrisiran (HELIOS-A), 118 (96.7%) of these patients and 77 
placebo patients included in the APOLLO, 67 (87.0%) patients had a baseline assessment for mNIS+7, 
and at least one post baseline follow-up assessment (either at 9 months, 18 months, or both) were 
included in the primary Month 18 analysis using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM).  
Thus, the performed primary and sensitivity analyses at Month 18 using a MMRM was initially 
questioned. Generally, these analyses were not performed on the pre-specified mITT population 
including all randomized patients who received any amount of study drug. Actually, patients without 
any post-baseline assessments (both Month 9 and Month 18 assessments missing/censored), both in 
the vutrisiran and placebo groups, were excluded from the analyses. Furthermore, the MMRM handles 
missing data implicitly based on a missing at random (MAR) assumption, which was not fully in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 113/158 
 
 
 
alignment to the defined estimands. Therefore, analyses performed on the “true” mITT population and 
in alignment to the defined estimands were requested and provided. 
Two additional PMM analyses were implemented: PMM 1, corresponding to the primary hypothetical 
estimand, and PMM 2, corresponding to the treatment policy estimand. 
For the primary endpoint mNIS+7 at Month 18 the differences in LS mean change between vutrisiran 
from HELIOS-A study and placebo from APOLLO study were -28.55, -29.30 and -28.15 using the 
MMRM, PMM 1 (hypothetical) and PMM 2 (treatment policy), respectively.  
For the secondary endpoint Norfolk QoL-DN at Month 18, the differences in LS mean change between 
vutrisiran from HELIOS-A study and placebo from APOLLO study were -21.0, -23.8 and -24.2 using the 
MMRM, PMM 1 (hypothetical) and PMM 2 (treatment policy), respectively. 
It can be agreed that there was little difference between the estimates of treatment effect based upon 
the two PMM methods or MMRM analyses for the primary (PMM being slightly larger than MMRM) 
endpoint, but also for the secondary endpoints.  
Caveats for the positive observations could have been the fact that the population was possibly less 
diseased in HELIOS-A, and patients in that study knew they were all on treatment, thus increasing the 
expectations from treatment and a placebo-like effect. For population comparison, it is not enough to 
demonstrate that all quartiles behaved similar to the entire placebo or active treatment component. If 
patients on one of the trials were all similarly shifted towards one of the ends, all quartiles may be 
similarly compared, yet results will be shifted. Interestingly, patisiran had shown similar results in the 
APOLLO study by Month 9, as vutrisiran in HELIOS-A.  
The different results for patisiran in studies HELIOS-A and APOLLO were discussed for the better 
understanding and assessment of the comparative effects. In HELIOS-A, patisiran has been used as a 
reference comparator to contextualise the results from both studies and to evaluate the size and 
relevance of the differences observed between vutrisiran and placebo.  
A thorough comparison of within HELIOS-A study vutrisiran vs. patisiran at Month 9 and Month 18 with 
the important endpoints have been provided by the Applicant. Informal post hoc analyses of key 
efficacy parameters using MMRM for the within-study comparison of vutrisiran and patisiran groups of 
the HELIOS-A study at Month 18 showed very small mean differences (95% CI) between these 
treatment groups -1.46 (-7.36, 4.43), -1.6 (-8.6, 5.4), 0.034 (-0.064, 0.132) and 0.1 (-2.0, 2.2) in 
the change from baseline for mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL-DN, 10MWT and R-ODS, respectively. A relatively 
larger LS mean difference 14.2 (-21.9, 50.3) was observed for the change in mBMI, but this was in 
favour of vutrisiran. These results are supportive of the non-inferiority comparison of vutrisiran versus 
patisiran with respect to reduction in serum TTR levels, and it can be agreed that comparable results in 
clinical endpoints have been observed for vutrisiran and patisiran in HELIOS-A. 
A comparison of the results of patisiran arms in HELIOS-A vs. APOLLO have also been submitted. A 
descriptive summary of key efficacy parameters (change from baseline) for the patisiran arms of the 
HELIOS-A study and APOLLO study at Month 9 and Month 18 showed also similar results and 
consistency, despite that the sample size of patisiran in HELIOS-A was small, with greater variability as 
a consequence, and it was not designed for comparisons between the patisiran groups in these studies. 
It can be agreed that the two datasets are not identical, with slightly different data distributions and, 
as a result, the two fitted models, e.g., the relationship between the outcome and covariates, had 
slight differences, which led to slightly different estimates. It can also be agreed that the numerical 
differences between the HELIOS-A patisiran and APOLLO patisiran groups are minor for all important 
efficacy endpoints and unlikely to have an impact on the conclusions of the HELIOS-A study.

Changes in NT-proBNP levels in response to interventions are predictive of mortality outcomes. 
Stabilisation of the NT-proBNP levels were observed in patients on vutrisiran vs. an increase in patients 
on placebo. Although the obvious limitations including higher mean NT-proBNP baseline levels in the 
APOLLO study and cross-study comparison, the similar fold-change ratios (substance vs. placebo) 
suggest similar effects of vutrisiran and patisiran.  
It should be also noted that for the Month 18 analysis, select echocardiogram parameters were re-read 
due to a staffing change at the central reading site that introduced a potential source of bias impacting 
the comparison of baseline versus follow-up echocardiogram data. Based on the new measurements 
for baseline LV wall thickness, the Cardiac Subpopulation was re-derived. As a result, seven patients 
receiving vutrisiran were added to the Cardiac Subpopulation and two were removed compared to the 
population defined in the Month 9 analysis.   
Despite the above, it appears that changes in select echocardiographic parameters were of a similar 
magnitude with vutrisiran and patisiran when compared to the placebo group in APOLLO study. 
TTR reduction at Month 9 was similar or even slightly greater with vutrisiran than with patisiran, and in 
the order of 78-82%, which is considered a very high TTR reduction. Such a large PD effect on the TTR 
could be indicative of the efficacy of vutrisiran. The % reduction of patisiran in APOLLO study was not 
presented, but it is known from phase 2 patisiran development study 002 that reductions of up to 96% 
and an average reduction of 92.5% were observed by two years. It is interesting to note that TTR 
reduction was nearly as similar with vutrisiran in HELIOS-A, as patisiran in APOLLO, in spite of the 
differences with the population. Nevertheless, as in the case of endpoints mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN 
at Month 9, and based on the same mechanism of action, and the very similar pharmacodynamic 
effects, the objective of this study was met at Month 18, as anticipated, and a demonstration of the 
non-inferiority of vutrisiran compared to within-study patisiran group, with respect to serum TTR levels 
through Month 18, was provided. The pre-specified criteria for declaring non-inferiority of vutrisiran 
(versus patisiran) was if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the median treatment difference in TTR 
percent reduction (vutrisiran – patisiran) was greater than –10%. The time-averaged trough TTR 
percent reduction through Month 18 was 84.7% for vutrisiran and 80.6% for patisiran (Table 35 in 
HELIOS-A CRS2 or Table 2 in Q59b). It can be concluded that vutrisiran demonstrated non-inferiority 
compared to within study patisiran, because the 95% CI limits of the median treatment difference in 
TTR percent reduction (vutrisiran – patisiran) was 1.17 and 9.25, in which the lower limit was above -
10% [H0: Vutrisiran is inferior to patisiran: difference in median TTR reduction (vutrisiran – patisiran) ≤ 
-10%]. 
Last, the results from different analysis models MMRM, PMM 1 (hypothetical estimand) and PMM 2 
(treatment policy estimand) appear consistent, and the slight differences do not have any impact on 
the clinical interpretation of the results. Therefore, the use of the MMRM results in the SmPC is 
considered acceptable, in order to keep all public information consistent. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare, progressive and fatal disease which manifests 
as destabilization of the tetrameric structure of the TTR protein. Vutrisiran is a siRNA molecule that 
uses RNA interference mechanisms to target and silence the expression of wild type and variant TTR 
mRNA and inhibit the synthesis of the TTR protein.   
Large reductions in TTR and large improvements in neuropathy have been observed from baseline to 
Month 9 and to Month 18 with vutrisiran (in HELIOS-A), compared to an external placebo group from 
the pivotal study of patisiran (APOLLO). The results for the primary and secondary endpoints at Month 
18, as pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan, together with the demonstration of non-inferiority 
Assessment report

Page 115/158 
 
 
 
of vutrisiran to patisiran on the TTR percent reduction, confirmed the efficacy of vutrisiran in patients 
with hATTR with FAP stage 1 and 2 polyneuropathy. Finally, the indication for vutrisiran, as it is 
agreed, reflects the population studied and is the same as that for the approved product Onpattro 
(patisiran).   
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Safety data of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is derived from the 
active controlled, open-label HELIOS-A study with a completed 18-months Treatment and ongoing 
Extension Period. With the response to the D120 LoQ, the Applicant has provided updated safety data 
as of the cut-off date of 26th August 2021. As of this date, overall, 155 patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were exposed to vutrisiran in the clinical development program, with 
a cumulative exposure of 233.0 patient years; 118 patients have overall been exposed for ≥ 18 months 
and five subjects have been exposed for ≥ 27 months.  
Posology:  
During the Treatment Period, vutriran posology was 25 mg s.c. every three months (q3M); during the 
ongoing Extension Period as (per protocol Amendment 4.0) subjects who had already entered, or are 
entering the Extension Period, were randomised to either 25 mg vutrisiran s.c. q3M or 50 mg vutrisiran 
s.c. q6M. The all vutrisiran population comprises all subjects who received at least one dose of 
vutrisiran during HELIOS-A Treatment Period or Extension Period (irrespective of posology).   
According to the Applicant, the patisiran group (N=42) in the HELIOS-A study was not intended to 
inform the safety profile of vutrisiran, but mainly the PK and a descriptive efficacy comparison to 
patisiran; as such, the patisiran data were not included in the Clinical Overview (CO) or the body of the 
Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) and of the SUR#1, respectively of the original submission. The main 
safety comparison provided by the Applicant was made to the external placebo group of the APOLLO 
study (N=77). HELIOS-A and APOLLO enrolled patients with the same disease and nearly identical 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, aiming to provide a fair representation of the type of disease-related 
events commonly reported in this patient population. Differences between the studies included double-
blind vs open-label design, exposure duration and frequency and mode of study drug administration, 
respectively. In addition, patients in the APOLLO placebo group but not in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran 
group received pre-medications (including corticosteroids, antihistamines and paracetamol) prior to the 
infusion. With regard to baseline differences, see section 3.3.4.2 of this report.  
At the time of the current submission, Helios-B study, performed in patients with hATTR amyloidosis 
with cardiomyopathy, was ongoing. 348 subjects had been included in this study, randomised 1:1 to 
vutrisiran and placebo; however, as this study was still blinded at the time of writing this report, no 
detailed safety data had been provided.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
An overview of AEs as of the CRS2 data cut-off date (26-AUG-2021) reported during the HELIOS-A 
Treatment Period for the vutrisiran and patisiran groups, as well as for the APOLLO placebo group, is 
presented in the following Table 37.

Table 37: Overview of Adverse Events HELIOS-A Treatment Period and APOLLO placebo 
group (CSR2-cut-off date 26-AUG-2021, Safety Population) 
Common adverse events 
During the Treatment Period, AEs reported in ≥10% of patients in the vutrisiran group were fall, pain in 
extremity, diarrhoea, oedema peripheral, urinary tract infection, arthralgia and dizziness. In the 
patisiran group, AEs reported in ≥10% of patients were infusion related reaction, urinary tract infection, 
diarrhoea, fall, constipation and headache.  
Adverse events reported in ≥5% of patients in the vutrisiran group are summarized in the following 
Table 38.

Table 38: Adverse Events in ≥5% of Patients in the Vutrisiran Group during the HELIOS-A 
Treatment Period by Preferred Term (As of CSR2 data-cut 26-AUG-2021, Safety population) 
Relationship of adverse events to study drug/Related adverse events/Adverse events by causality 
According to the CO, the Applicant defined Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as follows:  
ADRs are AEs for which there is a basis to believe there may be a causal relationship to the medicinal 
product. For vutrisiran, ADRs are defined as the most frequently reported AEs in vutrisiran-treated 
subjects in the HELIOS-A study, while accounting for commonly reported AEs in the background 
disease population using the data from the external reference APOLLO placebo group. Additional 
considerations included temporal relationship and biologic plausibility.  AEs were analysed by individual 
preferred term (PT) and also grouping by medical concept. Based upon a frequency criterion of AEs 
(individual PT and/or grouped medical concept) reported in >5% of vutrisiran-treated subjects in 
HELIOS-A (Treatment Period) and >3% higher frequency compared to the APOLLO placebo group, the 
following events were observed: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 118/158 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Arthralgia was reported in 10.7% of vutrisiran-treated subjects, compared with none in the 
APOLLO placebo group. AEs of arthralgia were mostly mild or moderate in severity, with one patient 
having a severe AE; none of the events were serious. No AEs of arthralgia led to treatment 
discontinuation. AEs of arthralgia did not increase over time.  
• 
The medical concept of dyspnoea, which includes the PTs dyspnoea, dyspnoea exertional, and 
dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal, was reported in 6.6% of vutrisiran treated subjects compared with no 
subjects in the APOLLO placebo group. These AEs of dyspnoea were mild or moderate in severity; none 
of the events were severe or serious. None of the AEs led to treatment discontinuation. AEs of 
dyspnoea did not increase over time. 
•  
As a result of the updated safety data of the HELIOS-A Treatment Period (as of 26-AUG-2021), 
the Applicant further proposes to include “pain in extremity” in SmPC section 4.8 as a common ADR, 
which occurred in 14.8% vutrisiran-treated subjects compared with 10.4 % APOLLO placebo subjects. 
These events were generally mild or moderate, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation in any 
subject. There was neither a clear pattern in time to onset of pain in extremity since start of vutrisiran 
or since last dose, respectively nor a pattern regarding associated TEAEs.   
• In addition, based on the subcutaneous administration mode of vutrisiran, injection site reactions 
(ISRs) are considered an ADR. ISRs were reported in 4.1% of vutrisiran-treated subjects during the 
Treatment Period. ISRs were all mild, non-serious, transient, and did not lead to treatment 
discontinuation. Symptoms included bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, and warmth. One further 
subject experienced a single ISR during the HELIOS-A study Extension Period, with the PT of traumatic 
haematoma, apparently reported as moderate. 
• 
Vitamin A decreased was excluded as an ADR as it is an expected PD effect of any TTR-
lowering therapy. 
As of the CSR2, during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, AEs considered related to study drug by the 
investigator and reported in ≥ two vutrisiran-treated subjects were vitamin A decreased (in 8 (6.6%) 
HELIOS-A vutrisiran, two (4.8%) HELIOS-A patisiran and no APOLLO placebo subjects), Injection site 
reaction in four (3.3%) vutrisiran and no patisiran and APOLLO placebo subjects, respectively, in whom 
study drug was infused intravenously), dry eye in three (2.5%) vutrisiran, no patisiran and one (1.3%) 
APOLLO placebo subjects), dyspepsia in two (1.6%) vutrisiran and no patisiran or APOLLO placebo 
subjects), fatigue in two (1.6%) vutrisirian, no patisiran and four (5.2%) APOLLO placebo subjects, 
oedema peripheral in two (1.6%) vutrisirian, no patisiran and five (6.5%) APOLLO placebo subjects 
and scleral discolouration in two (1.6%) vutrisiran and no patisiran or APOLLO placebo subjects), 
respectively.  
Vitamin A results collected on HELIOS-A were not blinded, and some investigators reported this known 
PD effect as an AE, with reporting varying by investigator.  
Adverse Events over time   
An analysis of AEs over time by 3-month intervals in the vutrisiran group during the Treatment Period 
was performed, showing that the proportion of patients with AEs was generally stable over time (CSR2 
Table 14.3.1.2.3). 
Adverse events by severity 
As of the CSR2, one or more severe AEs were reported for 15.6% vutrisiran and 38.1% patisiran 
subjects during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period and for 36.4% APOLLO placebo subjects, respectively. 
Severe AEs by preferred term (PT) that were reported in more than a single vutrisiran subject were 
sepsis, atrial fibrillation, hypokalaemia, and syncope (reported in two subjects each and not related 
each). During the Treatment Period, three vutrisiran-treated patients had severe AEs that were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 119/158 
 
 
 
considered related to study drug by the investigator (all were already reported in the SCS of the 
originally submitted documentation): Patient, experiencing Escherichia urinary tract infection, which 
was also an SAE (see Section 3.3.7.3, below); patient, experiencing vitamin A decreased and oedema 
peripheral; patient experienced six severe, transient events, i.e. dizziness, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, 
hyperthermia, scleral discolouration, and dyspepsia, on Day 1 after the first dose of study drug. For all 
three patients with severe, treatment-related events, no action was taken with the study drug and all 
three patients continued in the study. One further treatment related severe AE was reported in the all 
vutrisiran population as of 26-AUG-2021, i.e. an SAE of transaminases increased (see AECI, Hepatic 
events and SAEs, respectively, below). 
Adverse events of clinical interest (AECI)/other adverse events of interest 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) of clinical interest concerned severe or serious injection site reactions 
(ISRs), ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with 
subsequent injections), recurrent ISRs that are increasing in severity, or ISRs that lead to temporary 
dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of vutrisiran. A systemic reaction that includes the 
injection site (e.g. generalized urticaria) was not considered an ISR. The frequency of ISRs was 
evaluated by analysis of AEs mapping to the MedDRA high level term (HLT) of Injection Site Reactions. 
As of the CSR2 data cut-off (26-AUG-2021), during HELIOS-A Treatment Period, ISRs were reported in 
five (4.1%) vutrisiran-treated patients, and in 0.6% of the 836 total vutrisiran doses administered. In 
HELIOS-A, vutrisiran was initially administered using injections prepared from vials; some patients 
were transitioned to prefilled syringe (PFS) injections, as that presentation became available. By 
presentation, ISRs occurred in 0.8% vutrisiran doses administered as vials and in 0.3% vutrisiran 
doses administered as prefilled syringes. ISR signs and symptoms included bruising, erythema, pain, 
pruritus, and warmth in one subjects each. No patient had more than one event of ISR. All ISRs were 
non-serious, transient, and considered mild in severity; no ISR led to treatment discontinuation. One 
further subject experienced one single ISR during the Extension Period (as of 26-AUG-2021); 
apparently, the signs and symptoms in this subject were reported as traumatic haematoma and this 
ISR was reported as moderate (according to Table 14.3.1.2.5 of CSR2). 
As of CSR2 data cut-off (26-AUG-2021), during HELIOS-A Treatment Period, in the patisiran group, 
infusion related reactions (IRRs) were reported for 10 (23.8%) patients, who had a total of 50 IRRs; 
the maximum severity of the events was mild for five patients, moderate for four patients, and severe 
for one patient. Three patients had a total of four serious IRRs, all treatment related. For two (4.8%) 
patients, the SAEs of IRR resulted in an interruption of the patisiran infusion. No patient discontinued 
study treatment due to an IRR. 
During the completed Helios-A Treatment period, the incidence of TEAEs mapping to the 
Hypersensitivity Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ; based on broad and narrow scope terms) in the 
Helios-A vutrisiran group (21.3%) was lower as compared to the incidences in the APOLLO placebo 
(29.9%), and the Helios-A or pooled patisiran groups, respectively (33.3% and 41.1%). Even, when 
infusion related reactions, which could not occur with vutrisiran due to the administration mode, were 
excluded from the analysis, the incidence of TEAEs in the Hypersensitivity SMQ was very similar or 
lower compared to the other treatment groups. 
Hepatic events    
During the HELIOS-A Treatment period as of the CSR2, AEs mapping to the drug-related Hepatic 
Disorders SMQ were reported for 6 (4.9%) patients in the vutrisiran group. These concerned 
hepatobiliary disorders in two (1.6%) subjects, i.e. hepatic cyst and hepatic function abnormal in one 
subject each, and Investigations in four (3.3%) subjects, respectively. In the APOLLO placebo group, 
AEs in the drug-related Hepatic Disorders SMQ were reported for six (7.8%) patients, hepatobiliary 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 120/158 
 
 
 
disorders concerned one (1.3%) subject and investigations two (2.6%) subjects, respectively. In the 
HELIOS-A patisiran group, hepatic AEs mapping to the SMQ were reported in six (14.3%) subjects.  
In the vutrisiran group, all hepatic AEs were mild or moderate in severity, none was serious, and none 
led to discontinuation of study drug. Three patients had hepatic AEs that were considered related to 
treatment by the investigator, all concerning investigations. However, in all cases no action was taken 
with study drug. In one of these subjects increased alkaline phosphatase was not reported as resolved; 
however, alkaline phosphatase declined to near baseline values despite continued treatment, and all 
other related hepatic AEs resolved despite continued treatment. Confounding factors were present in 
two of these cases.      
In the all vutrisiran group (HELIOS-A Treatment+ Extension Period), AEs mapping to the drug-
related Hepatic Disorders SMQ were reported for 7.7% of subjects (the majority being within the 
Investigations SOC). Three severe events occurred in two subjects; all these severe events occurred 
during the Extension Period, concerned increased liver function test (LFT) parameters, and are 
described in the respective section, directly below.   
Overall, four related hepatic AEs occurred, three during the Treatment Period (described above) and no 
hepatic AE led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Liver function test (LFT) parameters 
In subjects treated with vutrisiran during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, mean absolute and mean 
change from baseline in bilirubin, remained generally stable over the course of the study, however, a 
minor increase from baseline in mean transaminases (<4.37IU/L) was found, peaking at Day 505, 
which trended back towards baseline thereafter. Further, when disregarding measurements at time-
points at which values are available for only few subjects, there appeared to be a rather steady 
increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) over time in both, the vutrisiran as well as the patisiran group 
(see CSR2, Table 14.3.5.3.1). Of note, no corresponding increase in ALP was found in the patisiran 
group of the Apollo patisiran study.  
As of the CSR2, regarding worst post-baseline LFT results derived from routine monitoring in HELIOS-
A, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was found in 35.2% vutrisiran and 47.6% patisiran 
subjects, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in 24.6% vutrisiran and 31.0% patisiran 
subjects and total bilirubin increased was found in 8.2% vutrisiran and 9.5% patisiran subjects, 
respectively. Central and local routine safety laboratory monitoring indicated that values of ALT or AST 
>3×ULN were reported for 1 patient, who had an AST elevation of 5.4×ULN and an ALT elevation of 
3.9×ULN (considered not related to study treatment, but attributable to eating a potentially 
hepatotoxic wild herb). No action was taken with regard to study drug, the event resolved.   
In the all vutrisiran-treated population (derived from HELIOS-A Treatment and Extension Period), three 
subjects overall had values of ALT or AST >3×ULN: one subject during the Treatment Period, described 
above, two subjects during the Extension Period:  
- Subject had a severe SAE of transaminases increased, considered related. ALT 6.36xULN, AST 
5.22xULN, AP 1.42xULN, and GGT 4.06xULN were reported in a patisiran-vutrisiran subject, 42 Days 
after the first dose of 50 mg vutrisiran during randomised Extension (RTE) period. Medical history 
included amongst others heart failure, hypertension and a BMI of 31.0 mg/m². CT scan showed diffuse 
hepatic steatosis, hepatic cysts and gallstones without complication. Information provided after the 
data cut-off date included variable descriptions of symptoms from jaundice and right upper quadrant 
pain to isolated ALT/AST elevations without symptoms. However, bilirubin was normal at the time of 
the event, no value of total bilirubin >2×ULN was reported throughout the study. Updated information 
provided by the applicant over the course of the assessment showed, that a milder transaminase 
increase occurred in this subject, peaking approx. four weeks after the second vutrisiran injection at 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 121/158 
 
 
 
ALT of >2.4 ULN and AST of >2.3. In both instances transaminase levels returned to near normal or 
normal, respectively, no specific treatment or hospitalisation was required during either event and the 
subject is ongoing in the study (as of 08 April 2022). Of note, the subject received a different posology 
than that currently recommended, i.e. twice the recommended single dose administered with a longer 
treatment interval (of six months). 
Beyond this case, no further related SAE of transaminases increased occurred as of 26-AUG-2022. 
- In subject non-serious AEs of moderate transaminases increased and severe drug-induced liver injury 
occurred during the Helios-A Treatment Extension Period and were attributed to the subject’s vitamin A 
supplement. Transaminase increase started after the 6th vutrisiran administration in this subject and 
was reported as AE after the 8th dose. Transaminase levels peaked to 2.81xULN AST and 3.96xULN ALT 
and improved to <2xULN AST and <3xULN ALT (at the last available measurement) after the vitamin A 
supplement was withdrawn, while vutrisiran administration was continued unchanged. The exact 
vitamin A dose taken by the subject is not known.  All values for bilirubin were normal during the 
study. The patient is continuing to receive vutrisiran in the study. 
No values of total bilirubin >2×ULN were reported and no patients met biochemical Hy’s law criteria.  
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increases (> 1.5xULN) during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period were 
reported in 11 (9.0%) vutrisiran vs. 1 (2.4%) patisiran subject (as of the CSR2) and in 1 (1.3%) 
APOLLO placebo subject. Of the 11 vutrisiran subjects with ALP increase, four had confounding factors 
or no clear increase in ALP from baseline. For the remaining seven subjects, any concurrent elevations 
in LFTs were typically transient and mild with all ALT and AST values < 3xULN and all bilirubin levels 
<2xULN. There was no pattern in time-to onset of ALP elevation. Overall, only a single ALP elevation 
was reported as TEAE in the vutrisiran group, which returned to near baseline valued despite continued 
vutrisiran.  
Cardiac events 
At baseline in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group, 68.0% of patients had a medical history of at least one 
term within the Cardiac disorders SOC, including 31.1% with terms in the Heart failure NEC HLT and 
13.1% with terms in the Cardiac conduction disorders HLT. In addition, 9.8% of patients had a medical 
history of at least 1 term within the Cardiac device therapeutic procedures HLT (eg, pacemaker and/or 
defibrillator) and two patients (1.6%) had heart transplant. At baseline in the patisiran group, 73.8% 
of patients had a medical history of at least one term within the Cardiac disorders SOC, including 
35.7% with terms in the Heart failure NEC HLT and 16.7% with terms in the Cardiac conduction 
disorders HLT. In addition, 21.4% of patients had a medical history of at least one term within the 
Cardiac device therapeutic procedures HLT and one patient (2.4%) had a heart transplant. 
A summary of cardiac safety found in the HELIOS-A study and in the APOLLO placebo group is 
presented in the following Table 39.

Table 39: Summary of Cardiac Safety during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period in the 
Vutrisiran Group compared to HELIOS-A patisiran and APOLLO placebo group, respectively 
(CSR2 data cut-off, 26-AUG-2022, Safety population) 
. 
Vutrisiran group in HELIOS-A Treatment Period as of CSR2 data cut-off (26-AUG-2021): 
30.3% vutrisiran subjects had AEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC, 24.6% had AEs that mapped within 
the Cardiac arrhythmia HLGT, the majority (22 of 30) of these latter patients had cardiac amyloidosis 
at baseline. The most frequent AEs within the Cardiac arrhythmia HLGT were atrial fibrillation (6.6%), 
bundle branch block left (4.1%), atrioventricular block first degree (3.3%), ventricular extrasystoles 
(2.5%), ventricular tachycardia (2.5%), and tachycardia (2.5%). In the vutrisiran group, cardiac SAEs 
were reported for 11 (9%) patients (one patient each with acute myocardial infarction, atrial 
fibrillation, atrioventricular block, atrioventricular block complete, atrioventricular block second degree, 
cardiac failure, cardiac failure acute, cardiac failure chronic, cardiac failure congestive, conduction 
disorder, myocardial ischaemia, and pericarditis). To evaluate whether there were any events that may 
be associated with QTc prolongation, an analysis of AEs within the Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation 
SMQ (broad terms) was performed. In the vutrisiran group, 11.5% of patients had AEs that mapped 
within the Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ; no confirmed events of Torsade de pointes were 
reported. No patient had a cardiac AE that was considered related to the study drug, one patient had 
an AE in the Cardiac disorders SOC (cardiac failure acute, considered not related) that resulted in 
discontinuation from the study drug and from the study. One patient death was adjudicated as a 
cardiovascular death (PT, iliac artery occlusion, which occurred after an SAE of cardiac failure), 
considered not related to study drug.

All Vutrisiran-Treated Population – HELIOS-A Treatment Period + Extension Period (as of 26-AUG-
2021) 
In the all vutrisiran-treated population, 24.5% of patients had AEs within the Cardiac disorders SOC. 
Cardiac SAEs were reported for 9.0% patients. Most events occurred in the Treatment Period (as 
described above). Cardiac SAEs that occurred in the Treatment Extension Period were bradycardia (one 
patient), sinus node dysfunction (one patient), and atrioventricular block second degree (one patient); 
none of these SAEs was considered related to the study drug and none resulted in discontinuation from 
the study drug. One patient died due to an SAE of sudden cardiac death, which was adjudicated as a 
CV death. 
No patient had a cardiac AE (including SAEs) that was considered related to the study drug. 
Cardiac events in the cardiac subpopulation, HELIOS-A Treatment Period (provided in CSR2, cut-off 
date of 26-AUG-2021): 
In the HELIOS-A study, 40 of the 122 patients (32.8%) in the vutrisiran group and 14 of the 42 
patients (33.3%) in the patisiran group had pre-existing evidence of cardiac amyloid involvement, 
defined as baseline LV wall thickness ≥1.3 cm and no aortic valve disease or hypertension in medical 
history. In the cardiac subpopulation, 15 (37.5%) of subjects in the vutrisiran group and four (28.5%) 
in the patisiran group had AEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC. Cardiac AEs reported in ≥5% of the 
vutrisiran-treated cardiac subpopulation were atrial fibrillation (15.0%), atrioventricular block (5.0%), 
cardiac failure (5.0%), and cardiac failure congestive (5.0%). Cardiac disorder SAEs were reported for 
six subjects (15.0%) in the vutrisiran cardiac subgroup, with the respective PTs occurring in one 
subject each and for four (28.6%) subjects in the patisiran cardiac subgroup.  
In the cardiac subpopulation, during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, AEs that mapped within the 
HLGT of Cardiac arrhythmia occurred in 32.5% HELIOS-A vutrisiran subjects (with the most common 
being atrial fibrillation with an incidence of 15.0%), in 7.1% HELIOS-A patisiran subjects and in 30.6% 
APOLLO placebo subjects. Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ AEs occurred in 17.5% vutrisiran 
and 7.1% patisiran subjects. No confirmed torsade de pointes were reported with vutrisiran. The 
incidences of events within the Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ in the cardiac subpopulation 
were mainly driven by the PTs of syncope, which occurred in 6 (15.0%) HELIOS-A vutrisiran vs. one 
(7.1%) HELIOS-A patisiran and three (8.3%) APOLLO placebo subjects. None of the syncope events in 
the HELIOS-A vutrisiran cardiac subpopulation was considered related by the Investigator, all 
concerned isolated events with no apparent pattern in temporal relationship to study drug 
administration or the total number of doses applied until the event, respectively. 
Renal disorders  
In HELIOS-A, at baseline 23.8% vutrisiran and 28.6% patisiran subjects had a medical history of terms 
within the Renal and urinary disorders SOC. In the vutrisiran group, the most common terms mapped 
to the HLT of bladder and urethral symptoms (8.2%) and the HLT of renal failure and impairment 
(5.7%). As of the CSR2 (26-AUG-2021), in the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, five (4.1%) vutrisiran 
subjects had an AE within the Acute renal failure SMQ, none of which was considered  related to study 
drug or led to study drug discontinuation. In the HELIOS-A patisiran group two (4.8%) subjects and in 
the APOLLO placebo group nine (11.7%) subjects had an AE within the Acute renal failure SMQ.  
Renal function parameters/Urinalysis 
As of the CSR2 (26-AUG-2021), in the vutrisiran group, mean absolute values and mean change from 
baseline in eGFR and creatinine were relatively stable throughout the HELIOS-A Treatment Period. The 
majority of patients in the vutrisiran group as well as in the patisiran group did not exhibit shifts in 
eGFR. During the Treatment Period, two subjects in the vutrisiran group and three subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 124/158 
 
 
 
patisiran group met the criterion of Grade 3 chronic kidney disease (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2) during 
the Treatment Period. No additional shifts to eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m² occurred during the Extension 
Period. 
No patient in the HELIOS-A study (vutrisiran or patisiran group) met the criteria of laboratory 
abnormalities corresponding to CTCAE v5.0 Grade 3 creatinine increased (creatinine >3.0×baseline or 
>3.0-6.0×ULN) or Grade 3 acute kidney injury (creatinine >3.0×ULN or >4.0 mg/dL). 
As of the CSR2 (26-AUG-2021), in the HELIOS-A study the majority of patients in the vutrisiran group 
had no abnormalities in urinalysis parameters during the Treatment (and Extension Period). For 
patients with urinalysis abnormalities, there did not appear to be any pattern to the abnormalities. 
Malignancies 
As of the CSR2 (26-AUG-2021), in the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, five (4.1%) vutrisiran subjects and 
no patisiran subjects experienced a malignancy. These included a subject with a recent history of 
gynecological pain and bleeding, who had an SAE of endometrial neoplasm on Day 87, with prior 
metrorrhagia on Day 79 and a subject, with no relevant medical history, and a non-serious AE of basal 
cell carcinoma on Day 50, a subject with no relevant medical history with an SAE of  adenocarcinoma 
of the cervix, serious on Day 413, a subject with no relevant medical history with an SAE of high grade 
transitional cell carcinoma on Day 451, and a subject with no relevant medical history with an AE of 
basal cell carcinoma on Day 335. None of the cases was considered related to study drug and no action 
was taken with study drug. In the All Vutrisiran Treated Population – Treatment Period + Extension 
Period no additional malignancy was reported. 
In the APOLLO placebo group, four (5.2%) subjects had malignancies, two patients had malignant skin 
neoplasms (basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma in situ), and three patients had solid organ 
malignancies (two colon cancers and one prostate cancer). One of the patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer had a prior history of Stage 3 colon cancer. 
Ocular events  
As of the CSR2 cut-off (26-AUG-2021), during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, 28.7% vutrisiran vs. 
23.8% patisiran subjects had an AE within the Eye disorders SOC. In the vutrisiran group, the AEs 
mapping within the Eye disorder SOC reported in ≥2% of subjects were vision blurred (4.1%), dry eye 
(4.1%), conjunctival haemorrhage (4.1%), visual impairment (2.5%), and eye pain (2.5%). One event 
(scleral discolouration) was severe, no AE in the Eye disorder SOC was serious.  
Treatment-related AEs in the Eye disorders SOC occurred in no patisiran and in 5.7% vutrisiran 
subjects, the PTs were dry eye in 3 (2.5%) subjects, scleral discolouration in two (1.6%) subjects, and 
night blindness and vision blurred, respectively in one (0.8%) subject each. The one patient with the 
AE of night blindness had a medical history of optic ischemic neuropathy that was ongoing at the start 
of the study and a history of regular eye exams. The ophthalmologic examination conducted after the 
AE of night blindness did not report findings suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, e.g., xerophthalmia, 
the patient’s visual acuity was assessed as requiring glasses. No action was taken with the study drug 
and the patient continued in the study. Overall three events of scleral discolouration occurred in two 
subjects, and all were considered related. One event was considered severe and occurred over study 
Day 1-2, with several concurrent severe non-ocular AEs, which were all transient. This subject had 
another event of (mild) scleral discolouration on Study day 168. In one further subject scleral 
discolouration was reported, which was mild and occurred from study Day 3-6.  
No additional treatment-related ocular events occurred during the Extension Period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 125/158 
 
 
 
In the APOLLO placebo group, 26.0% subjects had an AE within the Eye disorders SOC. Treatment 
related AEs in the Eye disorders SOC occurred in 6.5% subjects, with PTs of dry eye, eyelid ptosis, 
night blindness, retinal disorder, and vision blurred in one subject each.  
Depression and suicidality 
As of the CSR2, in the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, AEs within the Depression and suicide/self-injury 
SMQ were reported for no patisiran and for eight (6.6%) vutrisiran patients, the PTs were depression 
in four (3.3%) subjects and adjustment disorder with depressed mood, major depression, memory 
impairment, and terminal insomnia, respectively in one subject (0.8%) each. All events were mild or 
moderate in severity, none was serious, and none was considered related to study drug. 
In the APOLLO placebo group, AEs within the Depression and suicide/self-injury SMQ were reported for 
10.4% subjects, the respective PTs were depression in 7.8% subjects and poor-quality sleep as well as 
psychomotor hyperactivity in 1.3% subjects each.  
C-SSRS (HELIOS-A Treatment Period, results presented as of 26-AUG-2021): In the vutrisiran group, 
at baseline, 85.2% of patients had no suicidal ideation or behaviour, 13.1% had suicidal ideation, and 
1.6% of patients had suicidal behaviour. At patients’ worst post-baseline assessment, 86.9% of 
patients had no suicidal ideation or behaviour, 8.2% had suicidal ideation, 2.5% had suicidal 
behaviour, and responses were missing for 2.5% of patients. In the patisiran group, at baseline, 
97.6% of patients had no suicidal ideation or behaviour, 2.4% had suicidal ideation, no patient had 
suicidal behaviour, and no responses were missing. At patients’ worst post-baseline assessment, 
92.9% of patients had no suicidal ideation or behaviour, 2.4% had suicidal ideation, no patient had 
suicidal behaviour, and responses were missing for 4.8% of patients.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As of the updated data cut-off (26-AUG-2021), a total of 5 patients died during the Treatment Period 
of the HELIOS-A study, including 2 (1.6%) patients in the vutrisiran group and 3 (7.1%) patients in 
the patisiran group. None of the deaths was considered related to study drug by the Investigators, all 
were considered related to the underlying disease or other factors. Two of the deaths, 1 in each 
treatment group, were due to COVID-19 infection. 
Overall, in the vutrisiran clinical development program there have been five deaths in vutrisiran-
treated patients as of 19 October 2021. All deaths occurred in the HELIOS-A study, two cases during 
the Treatment Period, three during the Extension Period (one of the latter occurred before data cut-off 
date and two of the latter occurred after data cut-off date but before database lock, i.e. before 19 Oct 
2021). Two cases were cardiovascular, one was non-cardiovascular; the two cases that occurred after 
cut-off date were not adjudicated.  
The 1st case concerned a death due to pneumonia secondary to Covid-19 infection in a subject with 
risk factors for an unfavourable Covid-19 outcome (age > 80 years, male sex, pre-existing cardiac 
condition). In the 2nd case, death due to occlusion of the iliac artery during hospitalisation with cardiac 
failure and pneumonia occurred in a subject with pre-existing cardiac conditions, i.e. cardiac 
amyloidosis and a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure and circulatory disorders of the brain. The 
3rd case concerned the event of sudden cardiac death in a subject with a history of cardiac amyloidosis 
and congestive heart failure. The two death cases that occurred after database lock concerned a 
sudden cardiac death in two subjects, each with a history of cardiac amyloidosis with multiple pre-
existing cardiac conditions. None of the five fatal events in vutrisiran treated subjects was considered 
related to study drug.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
As of 26-AUG-2021 (CSR2), in the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, one or more SAEs were reported for 
26.2% of patients in the vutrisiran and 42.9% subjects in the patisiran group. In the APOLLO placebo 
group, SAEs were reported in 40.3% subjects. The SOCs in which ≥5% vutrisiran subjects reported 
SAEs were Cardiac disorders (9.0% of patients) and Infections and infestations (7.4% of patients). 
Apart from Covid-19 related events, the type of SAEs observed with vutrisiran was generally consistent 
with those reported in the patient population. Serious events reported in at least 2 (≥1%) vutrisiran 
subjects were pneumonia, acute kidney injury, ventricular tachycardia, COVID-19 pneumonia, 
pyelonephritis, sepsis, fall, hypokalaemia, and syncope. In addition to the data derived from HELIOS-A 
Treatment Period, further SAEs that occurred in at least 2 subjects in the all vutrisiran-treated 
population (Treatment + Extension Period) were orthostatic hypotension, atrioventricular block second 
degree, and ankle fracture (in two subjects each).  
An SAE of pyelonephritis occurred in 2 (1.6%) vutrisiran subjects vs. no APOLLO placebo subjects; in 
one of these subjects, ultrasound scan revealed a markedly enlarged prostate and significant residual 
volume post micturition at the time of the event. Both events were considered not related to 
treatment, did not lead to change of study drug and according to the provided narratives were 
moderate in intensity and resolved. Also, an SAE of syncope occurred in 2 (1.6%) vutrisiran vs. no 
APOLLO placebo or HELIOS-A-patisiran subjects, respectively (see AECI, Cardiac events, above).  
Beyond this, there are no imbalances in SAEs by PT in HELIOS-A vutrisiran vs. APOLLO placebo 
subjects, which would per se raise concerns. 
As of 26-AUG-2021, during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, two SAEs in the vutrisiran group were 
considered related to treatment by the Investigator. These concerned dyslipidaemia and Escherichia 
urinary tract infection (UTI), respectively and concerned one subject each. Neither related SAE led to 
change in study drug dose, both events resolved. Causality of the SAE of Escherichia UTI is 
questionable based on the medical history of UTI as well as the reported surgery for prostatic 
hypertrophy shortly before the onset of the event. A contributory role of vutrisiran with the case of 
moderate dyslipidaemia cannot be fully excluded based on the temporal relationship, however, the 
dyslipidaemia resolved with atorvastatin treatment despite continued vutrisiran. According to SUR#1 
Table 14.3.1.2, within the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC, no further AEs with the PT of 
dyslipidaemia, hypercholersterolaemia, or hypertriglyceridaemia, respectively were reported with 
vutrisiran in the HELIOS-A Treatment Period. 
As of 26-AUG-2021, a third SAE, i.e. transaminases increased was considered related in the all 
vutrisiran population (see AECI, LFT parameters, above). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology evaluations (as of 26-Apr-2021): 
For the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group mean values for hematology parameters, including red blood cell 
parameters (hemoglobin and hematocrit), white blood cell parameters (leukocytes, lymphocytes, and 
neutrophils), and platelet parameters (including platelet counts and mean platelet volume) were 
generally stable over the course of the study. Potentially clinically significant abnormalities in 
haematology parameters were infrequent in the vutrisiran group and respective decreases in 
haematology parameters occurred somewhat less frequently in vutrisiran compared to patisiran 
subjects. Increase in neutrophils (≥12x10^9/L) and in leukocytes (≥16x10^9/L) occurred in one 
vutrisiran subject each vs. in no patisiran subject. Potentially clinically significant abnormalities 
regarding platelets were not reported in any subject. In the vutrisiran group, two subjects had Grade 3 
haematology abnormalities; both subjects were receiving chemotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 127/158 
 
 
 
Blood chemistry evaluations (as of 26-Apr-2021): 
In the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group, the mean absolute values and mean percent changes from baseline 
for the blood chemistry parameters, including sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, 
glucose, phosphate, protein, urate, and albumin, remained generally stable over time. 
During the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, potentially clinically significant abnormality in blood chemistry 
reported in >3 vutrisiran subjects was low sodium (<130 mmol/L) which was reported in 3.3% 
vutrisiran and 4.8% patisiran subjects, respectively. Four patients in the vutrisiran group had Grade 3 
abnormalities in chemistry parameters, i.e. low sodium and low potassium levels in two subjects each, 
none of which was considered related with study drug.  
Coagulation parameters (as of 26-Apr-2021): 
In the vutrisiran group, mean values for coagulation parameters, including activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and prothrombin international normalized ratio (INR), were 
stable over time during the Treatment Period. Three subjects in the all vutrisiran group had Grade 3 
abnormalities in coagulation parameters, all of whom were on anticoagulants and two of whom had 
Grade 3 elevated prothrombin INR also at baseline.  
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
The incidence of potentially clinically significant abnormalities in vital sign assessments during the 
HELIOS-A Treatment Period in the vutrisiran group compared to the patisiran group did not show any 
consistent pattern which would raise new safety concerns for vutrisiran. While the incidence of weight 
increment ≥ 7% during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period (as of CSR2) was very similar in the vutrisiran 
and patisiran treatment groups (22.1% vs. 21.4%), the incidence of weight decrement ≥ 7% was lower 
in vutrisiran compared to patisiran subjects (17.2% vs. 28.6%). 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs): 
As of the CSR2, in the vutrisiran group, mean ECG parameters, including QTc corrected by Fridericia’s 
formula (QTcF) interval and all other ECG parameters, remained stable throughout the Treatment 
Period in both, the safety population and the cardiac subpopulation.  
As of the CSR2, during the 18-Month Treatment Period, the number of relevant shifts of QTcF was low 
and consistent with the underlying disease. No clear imbalance between vutrisiran and patisiran was 
seen with regard to the number of relevant shifts of QTcF, neither in the safety population nor in the 
cardiac subpopulation.  
Clinically significant change from baseline was infrequent, nevertheless was only reported in the 
vutrisiran but not in the patisiran group i.e. in two (1.7%) subjects at day 85, four (3.5%) subjects at 
months 9, four (3.6%) subjects at day 337, and four (3.5%) subjects at Month 18, respectively.

N/A 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
During the Helios-A Treatment Period (as of the cut-off date of 26-AUG-2021),  the safety profile, 
including the type and nature of AEs, including SAEs, in the vutrisiran-treated subjects was generally 
consistent across demographic and baseline disease characteristics, i.e. the Intrinsic factors  age 
(<65 vs ≥65 years), sex (male vs female), race (White vs all other races), weight (<65 vs ≥65 kg),

genotype (V30M vs non-V30M), and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) stage (I vs II/III) as well as 
the extrinsic factor geographic region (North America; Western Europe; Rest of world). From the 
provided AE table by age category (below) a higher incidence of e.g. SAEs, and TEAEs within the 
accidents and injuries SMQ, cardiac disorders SOC and vascular disorders SOC, respectively with 
increasing age was found within the vutrisiran group, as would be expected. However, in the subgroup 
aged ≥ 65 years, the safety profile of vutrisiran derived from the Helios-A treatment group, compared 
to the respective subgroup of the Apollo placebo group, does not raise safety concerns with regard to 
age.  
The safety profile of vutrisiran in the cardiac subpopulation was described by the Applicant as overall 
similar to that observed in the safety population, with similar proportions of patients experiencing AEs 
and SAEs. As of the CSR2 (16-AUG-2021), TEAEs in the cardiac subpopulation occurred in 97.5% 
vutrisiran and 92.9% patisiran subjects during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, and in 97.2% of 
APOLLO placebo subjects, respectively. SAEs in the cardiac subpopulation occurred in 32.5% vutrisiran 
and 35.7% patisiran subjects during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, and in 50.0% of the APOLLO 
placebo subjects, respectively. 
Through 18 Nov 2021, there have been no reported pregnancies in the vutrisiran clinical development 
program. 
No instances of accidental or intentional overdose of vutrisiran have been reported during the clinical 
development program (as of the SUR#1 cut-off date). Vutrisiran is not expected to have a withdrawal 
or rebound effect as the onset of the PD effects occurs within days and recovery occurs over months.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Antidrug antibody (ADA) assessments 
As of the CSR2 (26-AUG-2021), during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period, the incidence of treatment-
emergent ADA in the vutrisiran group was 3.3% (4 of 121 patients). Treatment-emergent ADA were 
low-titer (50) and generally transient. One subject had tested positive for ADA at baseline, remained 
positive at each post-baseline assessment through data cut-off with ADA titres between 50 to 100. PK 
concentrations for vutrisiran and TTR levels for the 4 (3.3%) vutrisiran-treated patients who tested 
positive for ADA were comparable at any time during the study with those of subjects with negative 
ADA status. One additional patient had a treatment-emergent ADA in the Extension Period that was 
low titer (50) and the subject tested negative at the next visit. Apparently, no patients who switched 
from patisiran during the Treatment Period to vutrisiran in the Extension Period reported a treatment-
emergent ADA. 
There was no pattern of AEs in patients with positive ADA status to suggest an impact of ADA on the 
safety profile of vutrisiran. There was no evidence of an association of ADA and anaphylactic reactions, 
or severe hypersensitivity. 
In the phase I (single-dose) study, transient low ADA occurred in 1 out of 60 (1.9%) vutrisiran 
subjects; there was no impact of ADAs on the subject’s PD response or PK profile.  
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
It is anticipated that drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur with vutrisiran. Therefore, no formal 
studies have been conducted by the Applicant, and such studies are considered unnecessary. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As of 26 August 2021, according to CSR2, three (2.5%) vutrisiran and three (7.1%) patisiran subjects 
had AEs leading to treatment discontinuation during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period compared to 12 
(15.6%) placebo subject in the APOLLO study. 
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation occurred in four (3%) subjects in the all vutrisiran population 
(Treatment + Extension Period) and concerned the three death cases during vutrisiran treatment as 
well as one case of acute cardiac failure (non-fatal) which occurred during the HELIOS-A Treatment 
Period (between original and SUR#1 data cut-off); none of these cases was considered treatment 
related.  
In the all vutrisiran population, two (1.3%) subjects had an AE that led to interruption of study drug. 
These concerned the related SAE of transaminases increased and one fatal COVID-19 pneumonia.  
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, 155 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were exposed with vutrisiran in the 
clinical development program (i.e. in the single pivotal, open-label, active controlled HELIOS-A study) 
with a cumulative exposure of 233.0 person years as of the latest safety cut-off (26-AUG-2021). Of 
these, 118 patients have been exposed for ≥ 18 months and 5 subjects for ≥ 27 months. Taking into 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 131/158 
 
 
 
consideration that hATTR amyloidosis is an orphan disease and that vutrisiran is a second-generation 
siRNA-GalNAc conjugate, this could be acceptable for an orphan drug; however, long-term data above 
two years are still limited. In line with the proposed posology, 25 mg vutrisiran was injected s.c. every 
three months during the Helios-A Treatment Period. With protocol amendment 4.0 of the Helios-A 
study, subjects, who had already entered or who were entering the Extension Period, were randomised 
to receive either 25 mg vutrisiran s.c. q3M or 50 mg vutrisiran s.c. q6M. The safety analyses for the 
Extension Period include both dose groups without an evaluation on safety by dose. However, as only 
the 25 mg dose is proposed for approval, this is not further pursued. 
HELIOS-A included a small (N=42) within-study patisiran reference comparator group in order to 
establish similar TTR reduction with vutrisiran and patisiran, as well as to enable a descriptive efficacy 
comparison with patisiran, however, the main safety comparison of the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group was 
made to the external APOLLO placebo group. This latter safety comparison is considered informative in 
order to distinguish disease related from drug related adverse events. However, although both studies 
were sponsored by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and the HELIOS-A study was designed in order to be 
highly similar to the APOLLO study, there are nevertheless some baseline differences regarding the 
APOLLO placebo compared to the HELIOS-A vutrisiran population which limit comparability of results. 
These differences pertain mainly to the APOLLO placebo population appearing rather consistently 
somewhat more severely affected by the hATTR amyloidosis including the degree of cardiac 
involvement. Further differences across both studies relate to blinded treatment in APOLLO vs. open 
label treatment in HELIOS-A and to the premedication also received by APOLLO placebo subjects but 
not by vutrisiran subjects in HELIOS-A. Further, duration of drug exposure differed between studies, 
nevertheless, it was longer in HELIOS-A compared to APOLLO placebo as of the latest safety data cut-
off provided. Due to these limitations, the within-study comparison of vutrisiran safety with patisiran is 
also considered relevant. As the HELIOS-A patisiran group was rather small, the Applicant has further 
provided a comprehensive analysis of the safety profile of the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group compared to 
that of the pooled (HELIOS-A and APOLLO) patisiran group as requested (using the completed 18-
Months Helios-A Treatment Period).   
As only interim data of the pivotal study had been presented with the original submission (with approx. 
14 months of HELIOS-A Treatment Period completed as of the Safety Update Report SUR#1, with a 
cut-off date of 09-APR-2021) the Applicant has presented updated safety data over the course of the 
assessment with the completed 18-Months Helios-A Treatment Period and the ongoing Extension 
Period as of the current data-cut-off date of 26-AUG-2021 (in the Clinical Study Report 2, CSR2).  
As of CSR2, the vast majority (>97%) of subjects across all treatment groups (HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran/patisirian as well as APOLLO placebo) had reported at least one TEAE. The incidence of SAEs 
considered related was higher in the vutrisiran compared to APOLLO placebo group (1.6% vs. 0%), 
nevertheless the incidence was low and also lower than in the HELIOS-A patisiran group (11.9%). 
Apart from this, the overview of safety (including the incidence of ADRs, severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation and to stopping study participation, respectively as well as the incidence 
of death cases) in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group compared relatively favourably to both, the APOLLO 
placebo as well as the HELIOS-A patisiran group. None of the five death cases that occurred in 
vutrisiran treated subjects in the clinical development program, as of 19 October 2021, was considered 
treatment related. 
The majority of TEAEs reported in the HELIOS-A study was consistent with common symptoms of 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. A decrease in serum levels of vitamin A is an expected 
secondary pharmacodynamic effect of reducing serum TTR protein and occurred in both HELIOS-A 
treatment groups. A warning regarding decreased vitamin A levels is proposed for section 4.4 of the 
SmPC, but no respective adverse drug reaction (ADR) is given in SmPC section 4.8, in line with the 
respective PI of patisiran and inotersen. This is endorsed, provided no clear vitamin A related ADR will 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 132/158 
 
 
 
be identified. Subjects participating in the APOLLO study were generally supplemented with 2500 IU 
vitamin A, which is recommended accordingly in the patisiran SmPC. In contrast, daily substitution 
with 3000 IU vitamin A is recommended in the inotersen SmPC. According to the Applicant’s 
clarification, subjects in the HELIOS-A study were supplemented with a dose of 2500 IU to 3000 IU of 
vitamin A. In line with this, the recommended daily vitamin A dose has been amended (from 2500 IU) 
to 2500 IU – 3000 IU in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the vutrisiran SmPC. 
Ocular involvement of hATTR amyloidosis is frequent particular with longer disease duration, the most 
frequent ocular disorders being dry eye syndrome (nearly 70%), amyloid deposition on the iris (38%) 
or on the anterior capsule of the lens (33%), pupillary disorders (as scalloped iris in about 28%), 
glaucoma (20%) and vitreous opacity [Luigetti M et al., 2020]. On the other hand, vitamin A deficiency 
is potentially related to ocular symptoms such as reduced night vision/night blindness, persistent dry 
eyes, eye inflammation and corneal inflammation/ulceration/thickening/perforation, respectively. 
However, in nonclinical studies, the reduction of serum vitamin A after chronic administration of 
vutrisiran had no effects on electroretinograms, ophthalmology examinations, and histopathology of 
the eye. In the inotersen and patisiran clinical study program, no negative findings, such as ocular 
toxicity, related to lower serum vitamin A levels have been identified. As further the reduction of TTR 
levels as well as vitamin A levels were generally comparable with vutrisiran compared to patisiran 
ocular toxicity would therefore not be anticipated for vutrisiran. 
As of the CSR2 cut-off date, the incidence of TEAEs in the Eye disorders SOC in the HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran group was higher compared to the HELIOS-A patisiran group (28.7% vs. 23.8%) but similar 
compared to the incidence in the APOLLO placebo group (26.0%). The majority of ocular AEs by PT in 
the vutrisiran group was consistent with the underlying disease and age of subjects, respectively. 
However, as there is overlap in hATTR amyloidosis and vitamin A deficiency related ocular symptoms, 
interpretation of the available data is difficult. AEs in the Eye disorders SOC were considered treatment 
related in 5.7% vutrisiran but no patisiran subjects. The latter may be owed to the open-label study 
design and the fact that ocular toxicity has not been identified with patisiran. It is considered 
reassuring, that the incidence of treatment related AEs in the Eye disorders SOC in the HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran group was similar to that of the APOLLO placebo group (6.5%). Regarding related ocular AEs 
in the vutrisiran group (i.e. dry eye in three (2.5%) subjects, scleral discolouration in two (1.6%) 
subjects, and night blindness and vision blurred, respectively in one (0.8%) subject each), the 
ophthalmological evaluation of the only subject with an AE of night blindness did not report findings 
suggestive of vitamin A deficiency. Transient AEs of scleral discolouration occurred already within the 
first days of treatment in both vutrisiran subjects concerned, which also makes a causal relationship 
with vitamin A deficiency implausible. Dry eye considered related by investigator occurred in 2.5% 
subjects in the vutrisiran and with a similar incidence in the APOLLO placebo group (1.3%); of note, 
TEAEs of dry eye independent of causality occurred with a similar incidence in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran 
(4.1%) and patisiran group (4.8%) and dry eye syndrome is described in literature as the most 
frequent ocular disorder in hATTR amyloidosis. Apparently none of the related AEs in the Eye disorders 
SOC led to study drug discontinuation, none was serious. Although a numerical imbalance with regard 
to (related as well as overall) TEAEs in the Eye disorders SOC was found within the HELIOS-A study in 
the vutrisiran compared to the patisiran group, taking the totality of data into consideration, including 
pre-clinical and pharmacological findings for patisiran and vutrisiran as well as the respective 
comparison with the APOLLO placebo group and the detailed analysis of the related ocular AEs, no 
clear safety signal with regard to ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency is identified.  
ADR of vutrisiran were mainly identified based on the most frequently reported TEAEs in vutrisiran 
treated patients in HELIOS-A accounting for commonly reported AEs in the background disease 
population, i.e. compared to APOLLO placebo subjects. Additionally temporal relationship and biologic 
plausibility were considered and AEs were analysed by PT and grouping by medical concept,

respectively. Using a frequency criterion of an incidence >5% of vutrisiran-treated patients in HELIOS-
A and >3% higher frequency compared to APOLLO placebo, the following ADRs were identified by the 
Applicant: arthralgia (reported in 10.7% of vutrisiran vs. 0 placebo subjects), dyspnoea (including the 
PTs dyspnoea, dyspnoea exertional, and dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal; reported in 6.6% vutrisiran 
vs. no placebo subjects), and pain in extremity (reported in 14.8% vutrisiran-treated subjects vs. 10.4 
% placebo subjects). As of the CSR2, one subject had a severe AE of arthralgia, apart from this, AEs of 
arthralgia and dyspnoea, respectively were mild or moderate, no event was serious, no AE of arthralgia 
or dyspnoea led to treatment discontinuation, or increased over time. Arthralgia and dyspnoea are also 
commonly associated with patisiran. Similarly, events of pain in extremity were mild or moderate, no 
event was serious or led to treatment discontinuation, and no clear pattern in time to onset of pain in 
extremity was recognizable with regard to start of vutrisiran or since the last vutrisiran dose.  
Based on the administration mode of vutrisiran, injection site reactions (ISRs) were also regarded 
ADRs and were reported in 4.1% vutrisiran subjects during the Helios-A Treatment Period and no 
APOLLO placebo subjects. ISRs included the symptoms bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, and warmth 
and the respective symptoms are included in the description of ISRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. One 
further subject experienced a single ISR during the HELIOS-A study Extension Period, with the PT of 
traumatic haematoma, apparently reported as moderate. In the all vutrisiran population, five mild and 
one moderate ISRs occurred, no event led to treatment discontinuation and no subject had more than 
one event. There was no increase in ISRs over time and the incidence of ISRs was low, irrespective of 
presentation (i.e. vials or pre-filled syringes). As of the CSR2, the incidence of antidrug antibody (ADA) 
formation in vutrisiran subjects was low, i.e. 4.1% (5/121 subjects) in the all-vutrisiran population of 
the HELIOS-A Treatment + Extension Period, and 1.9% (1/60) in healthy volunteers in study 001. 
Titres were low and generally transient. One subject had tested positive for ADA at baseline, remained 
positive at each post-baseline assessment (through data cut-off) with ADA titres between 50 to 100. 
No impact of ADA on PD activity of vutrisiran or on the safety profile of vutrisiran was identified. It is 
noted, that a systemic reaction that includes the injection site was not considered an ISR. The 
comparative incidences of TEAEs mapping to the broad Hypersensitivity SMQ, as well as the presented 
analyses by relatedness and severity, respectively, do not raise serious concerns. In two cases with the 
PT of “drug hypersensitivity” other medicinal products were suspected. The severe related AEs 
reported on Day 1 in one subject, which included dizziness, dyspepsia, hyperhidrosis and 
hyperthermia, do not correspond to anaphylaxis; however it could not be excluded, that these events 
were caused by other non-IGE-mediated or non-immunologic drug hypersensitivity reactions. Apart 
from this case, no clear safety signal arose with regard to hypersensitivity. Therefore, it can be agreed 
with the Applicant, that at present no specific conditions for vutrisiran home administration are 
required. It should be noted, however, that according the SmPC, Amvuttra should be administered by 
a healthcare professional in any case. Nevertheless, taking into consideration, that the overall 
vutrisiran exposure at the time of the safety data cut-off is limited to 155 subjects, drug related 
hypersensitivity should be further evaluated.  
The mechanism of action, available pre-clinical data, ECG data derived from the Phase I vutrisiran 
study performed in healthy volunteers, and the known safety profile of approved siRNAs, respectively 
are not indicative of a cardiac safety concern with regard to vutrisiran. However, vutrisiran has the 
same sequence but different modifications than revusiran, the development of which in hATTR 
amyloidosis with cardiac predominant phenotype was discontinued due to an increase of mortality in 
the revusiran arm compared to placebo, though not compared to the range expected from natural 
history. A revusiran-related effect on mortality could not be excluded. Therefore, and as patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis often have cardiac involvement, cardiac safety of vutrisiran was thoroughly 
evaluated in the overall safety population as well as the cardiac subpopulation. In the HELIOS-A study, 
in general, the type of cardiac AEs in vutrisiran-treated patients was consistent with those previously 
reported in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, based on findings in the APOLLO placebo group. Also, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 134/158 
 
 
 
comparison of incidences and event rates, respectively of the evaluated cardiac events in HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran compared to APOLLO placebo does not raise concerns (as these appeared consistently 
numerically lower in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group). No cardiac AE in the all vutrisiran HELIOS-A study 
population was considered related to study drug, and only one cardiac AE, although not considered 
related, led to study drug withdrawal.  
During the 18-Months HELIOS-A Treatment Period, the incidence of TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders 
SOC was 30.3% in the vutrisiran and 23.8% in the patisiran group. In particular, the incidence of 
cardiac arrhythmia HLGT AEs was approx. three times higher in HELIOS-A vutrisiran compared to 
HELIOS-A patisiran subjects (26.6% vs. 7.1%). However, no cardiac safety concerns derived from ECG 
evaluations. In the overall safety population the number of relevant shifts of QTcF was low and 
consistent with the underlying disease and in both, the overall safety population and the cardiac 
subpopulation, no imbalance between the treatment groups to the disadvantage of vutrisiran was seen 
in the number of relevant shifts of QTcF during the Helios-A Treatment Period. Patisiran is not 
associated with a cardiac safety concern, the observed shifts in QTcF appear therefore consistent with 
the underlying disease, i.e. hATTR amyloidosis with cardiac involvement. The overall rate of Helios-A 
vutrisiran subjects with clinically significant ECG changes from baseline was low for a hATTR 
amyloidosis population (i.e. ≤ 3.5% at different time points throughout Month 18 as of the CSR2), and 
the finding of no respective changes in the Helios-A patisiran group could be a chance finding due to 
the low sample size. In contrast to the imbalance regarding cardiac arrhythmias, TEAEs in the cardiac 
failure SMQ (narrow) occurred with a considerably lower frequency in the Helios-A vutrisiran (5.7%) 
compared to the Helios-A patisiran group (19.0%). It is further reassuring, that SAEs in the cardiac 
disorders SOC were reported with a lower incidence in the Helios-A vutrisiran vs. Apollo placebo as well 
as the Helios-A patisiran group (9.0% vs. 13.0% and 14.3%, respectively).  
In the cardiac subpopulation but not in the overall safety population, a somewhat higher incidence of 
syncope was found in HELIOS-A vutrisiran (15.0%) compared to both, HELIOS-A patisiran (7.1%) and 
APOLLO placebo (8.3%) subjects. The Applicant has evaluated all six cases of syncope of the Helios-A 
vutrisiran cardiac subpopulation: no event was considered related by the Investigator, all concerned 
isolated events with no apparent pattern in temporal relationship to study drug administration or the 
total number of doses applied until the event, respectively. In four of the six subjects concerned, a 
medical history of (orthostatic) hypotension or loss of consciousness was reported. Up to now no 
subject experienced a further TEAE of syncope during subsequent injections.  Based on the provided 
data regarding syncope (including the fact, that syncope occurred generally with a similar incidence in 
the overall safety population of the Apollo placebo vs. Helios-A patisiran group) a causal relationship 
with vutrisiran appears rather unlikely. Apart from syncope, the evaluation of cardiac events in the 
cardiac subpopulation (while limited particularly due to the low number of subjects in the HELIOS-A 
patisiran cardiac subgroup) appears to be generally in line with that of the overall safety population. It 
is therefore generally agreed with the Applicant, that both findings, the imbalance in TEAEs in the 
Cardiac arrhythmia HLGT within the Helios-A study (but not compared to the Apollo placebo group) as 
well as the higher incidence of syncope in the cardiac subpopulation in the Helios-A vutrisiran vs. both, 
the Helios-A patisiran and the Apollo placebo group, could be chance findings, due to the low subject 
numbers of the Helios-A patisiran and  the cardiac subpopulation, respectively.  
Taken altogether, the currently available cardiac findings with vutrisiran do not raise serious cardiac 
safety concerns.  
Compared to the Apollo placebo group and the Helios-A patisiran group, the incidences of TEAEs in the 
drug-related hepatic disorders SMQ during the Helios-A Treatment given for the vutrisiran group do not 
raise concerns. Four subjects in the all vutrisiran group had hepatic AEs that were considered 
treatment related. In three of these subjects, no event was serious or severe, no action was taken with 
study drug and all related hepatic AEs resolved despite continued treatment or increased LFT

parameters returned to near baseline, respectively. Confounding factors were present in two of these 
cases. However, in the fourth case a related severe hepatic SAE of transaminases increased (ALT 
>6xULN, AST >5xULN) was reported 42 Days after the first dose of 50 mg vutrisiran s.c.. After the 
second vutrisiran injection, a milder transaminase increase occurred, peaking approx. four weeks 
afterwards at ALT of 2.4xULN and AST of 2.3xULN. In both instances transaminase levels returned to 
near normal or normal, respectively, no specific treatment or hospitalisation was required during either 
event, and the subject is ongoing in the study. Concomitant medication that was reportedly ongoing at 
the time of SAE onset is associated with liver function test disorders, and a non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease was reported within two weeks of the SAE. Nevertheless, the considerable increase of 
transaminases from mostly normal elevated levels after the first dose of vutrisiran as well as a positive 
re-challenge point towards a causal relationship with vutrisiran. Of note, the subject received a 
different posology than that currently recommended, i.e. twice the recommended single dose 
administered with a longer treatment interval (of 6 months). The Sponsor validated a signal of 
transaminase elevations which is currently ongoing and has stated to continue careful monitoring the 
reports of transaminase elevations. Further evaluation of events of transaminases increased is 
indicated; however, no labelling changes is considered necessary at present. In subject (moderate) 
transaminases increased and severe drug-induced liver injury were not considered related to vutrisiran 
but attributed to the subject’s vitamin A supplement. Transaminase increase started after the sixth 
vutrisiran administration and was reported as AE after the eight dose. Transaminase levels improved to 
<2 ULN AST and <3 ULN ALT (at the last available measurement) after vitamin A supplement taken at 
an unknown dose was withdrawn, while vutrisiran administration was continued unchanged. The dose 
of vitamin A supplementation of 2500-3000 U recommended in the SmPC of vutrisiran is considered 
established and well below toxic levels. In order to ensure, that patients do not take too high doses of 
vitamin A, e.g. in the attempt to counteract vitamin A lowering, the PL was be amended in order to 
emphasize, that the daily Vitamin A dose should be taken as recommended by the treating physician.   
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increases (> 1.5 ULN) during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period were 
reported in 11 (9.0%) vutrisiran vs. 1 (2.4%) patisiran subjects (as of the CSR2) and in one (1.3%) 
Apollo placebo subject. The requested evaluation showed a low incidence of ALP increase >1.5 ULN 
without alternative explanations, with only one event being considered a TEAE by investigator. Further, 
ALP increase was not associated with clinically significant transaminase or bilirubin elevations. The 
observations of ALP increase >1.5 ULN are thus not of clear clinical relevance. Nevertheless, in order 
to inform the treating physicians and patients, respectively, ALP increased has been added to the PI as 
an ADR within the Investigations SOC based on the higher incidence in the Helios-A vutrisiran 
compared to the patisiran but also the Apollo placebo group. There appears to be a rather steady 
increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) over time, which by the way appears to develop generally 
similarly in the Helios-A patisiran group, with a mean absolute change (SD) from baseline of 22.19 
(35.38) U/L in the vutrisiran and of 23.82 (18.17) U/L in the patisiran group at day 673, constituting a 
mean relative change of 36.71% for vutrisiran and 32.24% for patisiran, respectively. Yet, the mean 
ALP values measured still remained within the normal reference values. Of note, no corresponding 
increase in ALP was found in the patisiran group of the Apollo study. As discussed in the non-clinical 
part of this Report, ALP elevations might be possibly explained by a slower ALP clearance from the 
circulation because of its competition with vutrisiran in binding to hepatic ASGPR. The clinical relevance 
of this seemingly continuous ALP increase is currently unclear and should be further evaluated. 
Arthralgia and pain in extremity (with very common frequency each) as well as dyspnoea, blood 
alkaline phosphatase increased and ISR (with common frequency each) are the only ADR identified and 
listed in SmPC section 4.8. Further discussion regarding noticeable findings from the evaluation of 
common TEAEs/ADRs/severe AEs led to the following conclusions (incidences are updated as of the 
CSR2):  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 136/158 
 
 
 
Although the TEAE of abdominal pain was reported with a  higher incidence in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran 
group (9.0%) vs. the APOLLO placebo group (1.3%) and the HELIOS-A patisiran group (2.4%), and 
dyspepsia considered related by the investigator was reported in 1.6% subjects in the HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran vs. no subjects in the APOLLO placebo or HELIOS-A patisiran group, respectively, the 
provided justification for not including abdominal pain and dyspepsia, respectively in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC can be accepted. The frequency of TEAEs within the abdominal pain medical concept was very 
similar in the Helios-A vutrisiran vs. the Apollo placebo group, no event was considered treatment 
related, and the severity of respective events was low. The frequency of dyspepsia TEAEs (irrespective 
of causality) was numerically lower in the vutrisiran vs. the Apollo placebo as well as the pooled 
patisiran group. Both vutrisiran subjects with dyspepsia considered related to study drug by the 
investigator continued vutrisiran without recurrence of dyspepsia. 
As influenza like illness and rash could potentially have also been symptoms of a systemic 
hypersensitivity reaction, or, in the case of rash, also of an injection site reaction, further evaluation 
was requested. During the 18 Months Treatment Period, influenza like illness occurred at a similar 
frequency, the respective incidences have been clarified by the Applicant to be 4.1% in the Helios-A 
vutrisiran group vs. 2.6% in the APOLLO placebo group. Although a causal relationship of influenza like 
illness with vutrisiran e.g. in the context of drug hypersensitivity cannot be fully excluded for all 
subjects, the incidence was low and the currently available data do not justify inclusion of influenza like 
illness in the SmPC as an ADR. Overall, in the Helios-A vutrisiran group (Treatment Period) compared 
to the APOLLO placebo group the incidence of TEAEs of rash by PT (5.7% vs. 3.9%) or TEAEs mapped 
to the rash custom query (7.4% vs. 9.1%) was similar. Within the rash medical concept grouping, 
none of the events in the vutrisiran group was considered an injection site reaction, two events were 
considered treatment related by the investigator (one of which had the PT of rash) as were three 
events (in three subjects) in the APOLLO placebo group. In three of the nine vutrisiran subjects with 
TEAEs in the rash medical concept grouping, the events occurred within a week of the previous dose. 
However, these latter events were all non-serious, vutrisiran was continued and no additional events of 
rash were reported in these subjects. It is therefore agreed, that labelling of rash as an ADR is 
currently not warranted. With regard to muscle spasm and sinusitis, respectively, which are both 
labelled for patisiran, it can be agreed that the presented data do not provide evidence to conclude a 
class effect for TTR-lowering RNAis. In particular, none of the events of sinusitis or within the medical 
concept of muscle spasm was considered treatment related and incidences of respective TEAEs were 
quite low. 
Based on the information regarding subject provided with the Response to the CHMP Day 120 LoQ 
(including a medical history of cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac failure and peripheral oedema, respectively 
as well as the time course of onset and increase of peripheral oedema), the event of severe peripheral 
oedema, which was considered related by the investigator, is not indicative of a hypersensitivity 
reaction and causality with vutrisiran is uncertain. Comprehensive data provided as of the CSR2 data 
cut-off (26-AUG-2021) showed, that  the safety profile of vutrisiran was generally consistent across the 
analysed subgroups by age, sex, race, weight, genotype (V30M or non-V30M mutation), FAP stage and 
geographic region, respectively.  
Based on the mechanism of action and non-clinical studies, in which there was no evidence of 
genotoxic potential, the risk of vutrisiran for carcinogenicity in humans is considered low. While no 
malignancies were reported in the HELIOS-A patisiran group, the incidence of malignancies in the 
HELIOS-A vutrisiran group (4.1%) did not exceed that of the APOLLO placebo group (5.2%). It is 
noted, that the mean age was approx. 5 years younger in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group compared to 
the APOLLO placebo group (57.8 vs. 62.2 years). However, the malignancies reported with vutrisiran 
do not demonstrate a striking pattern and the type and incidence appear consistent with that reported 
in the general population in this age group.  
Assessment report

Overall, vutrisiran is therefore not considered to be associated with an increased cancer risk.  
No safety signal derived from evaluation of renal adverse events, renal function parameters or 
urinalysis, respectively. No clear safety signal is raised from the evaluation of AEs within the 
Depression and suicide/self-injury SMQ and analyses of Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, 
respectively.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, 155 patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were exposed to vutrisiran in the 
clinical development program with a cumulative exposure of 233.0 person years as of the latest safety 
cut-off (26-AUG-2021). Of these, 118 patients have been exposed for ≥ 18 months. Taking into 
consideration that hATTR amyloidosis is an orphan disease and that vutrisiran is a second-generation 
siRNA-GalNAc conjugate, this could be acceptable for an orphan drug, however, long-term data above 
2 years are still limited.  
After completion of the Helios-A Treatment period and with the Extension Period ongoing (as of the 26-
AUG-2021) the only ADRs identified are arthralgia and pain in extremity with very common frequency 
each, as well as dyspnoea, blood alkaline phosphatase increased and injection site reactions (ISRs), 
with common frequency each. IRSs occurred in 5 (4.1%) vutrisiran subjects during the Helios-A 
Treatment Period and in one further subject during the Extension Period and none of the overall six 
subjects concerned experienced more than one event. Five ISRs were mild one event was moderate, 
no ISR led to treatment discontinuation, despite no administration of premedication. Vitamin A level 
reduction with vutrisiran in the proposed posology is comparable to patisiran, and as with patisiran no 
clear ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency toxicity was identified. The identified ADRs have been 
appropriately implemented in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis), also known as variant 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, is a rare, autosomal dominant, rapidly progressive, multi systemic 
disease caused by variants in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that results in debilitating morbidity and 
high mortality. Amyloid deposits accumulate in multiple organs, particularly the peripheral nervous 
system, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and heart, which manifests in progressive polyneuropathy 
including sensorimotor neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. Cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and 
gastrointestinal dysfunction frequently develop simultaneously. The phenotypic presentation of the 
disease is dependent on the pattern of affected organs. The most common manifestations of hATTR 
amyloidosis are polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.  
The worldwide prevalence of hATTR-PN has been estimated at approximately 10,000 patients. In 
Europe, the incidence is estimated from 0.003 to 0.10 cases per 10,000 per year (between 5000 to 
6000 patients or 0.3 new cases per year per 1 million inhabitants), with the majority of cases in 
Portugal, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In Europe, the prevalence is highest in northern 
Portugal and northern Sweden (as high as 50 per 100,000 inhabitants).  
There are over 120 reported TTR genetic variants associated with hATTR amyloidosis with 
heterogeneity in disease presentation from predominantly neuropathic, predominantly cardiac or mixed 
phenotypes.  Worldwide, the most common disease-causing variant results in a valine to methionine 
mutation at position 30 in the TTR molecule, V30M (p. TTRV50M). V30M is predominantly associated 
with polyneuropathy and is found primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden, Japan, and 
Brazil. In the US, the isoleucine substitution for valine at position 122 in TTR, V122I (pV142I), is the 
most prevalent TTR associated variant with a prevalence of approximately 4% in West Africans and 
African Americans.  V122I is associated with predominantly cardiac manifestations but also can be 
associated with concurrent polyneuropathy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Before the approval of  inotersen and patisiran, therapeutic strategies to treat hATTR included 
orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) or pharmacotherapy with tafamidis or off-label use of diflunisal, both 
of which are TTR stabilizers that work by preventing dissociation of the tetramer into amyloid-forming 
monomers. 
Tafamidis (“Vyndaqel”; EMEA/H/C/2294) was approved across the EU for the treatment of ATTR in 
adult subjects with Stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurological impairment 
and has also been licensed in Japan and several other countries. Diflunisal is a non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is presently used off-label in subjects with Stage 1 and Stage 2 
disease; however, the cardiovascular and renal side effects associated with the NSAID class limit the 
use of this drug in older patients with hATTR-PN or patients with hATTR CM. 
There are currently three European Commission (EC) approved therapies available in the European 
Union (EU) for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adults with polyneuropathy: ONPATTRO 
(patisiran), TEGSEDI (inotersen) and VYNDAQEL (tafamidis).  Patisiran and inotersen act by targeting 
the production of TTR synthesis in the liver by acting on messenger RNA (mRNA): patisiran through 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 142/158 
 
 
 
ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi); and inotersen through RNAse H-mediated cleavage. Tafamidis 
acts by binding to the thyroxine-binding site on TTR to reduce its dissociation into misfolded 
amyloidogenic monomers.  Both ONPATTRO (patisiran) and TEGSEDI (inotersen) are also approved in 
the United States (US) and Japan. VYNDAQEL (tafamidis), is also approved in Japan for the treatment 
of polyneuropathy in adults with transthyretin amyloidosis, however it is not approved in the US for 
this indication.  
Other treatment approaches currently used in clinical practice for hATTR amyloidosis include: 
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), which eliminates variant TTR from the circulation but does not 
negate the hepatic production of wtTTR, and another TTR tetramer stabilizer (diflunisal). 
There are treatment options available for patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. In 
spite of the several treatments available, there are patients who do not tolerate or have shown adverse 
reactions to some of the above mentioned products; therefore, a new efficacious and safety agent will 
be most welcome. There is still a need for improved products that address the underlying physiological 
basis of the disease (not stabilisers), are highly effective in improving neuropathy and delay or stop 
disease progression, have convenient dosing, minimize the need for health care encounters and have 
acceptable safety profiles without the need for intensive laboratory or clinical monitoring. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal trial for this application is HELIOS-A (ALN-TRSC02-002), which is an ongoing, global, Phase 
3, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of vutrisiran in adult 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.  The primary and most secondary and 
exploratory endpoints of the study evaluate the efficacy of vutrisiran by comparing to the placebo 
group of the Phase 3 patisiran APOLLO study.  The study is being conducted in 2 parts:  an 18month 
Treatment Period, with the early efficacy analyses at Month 9 (primary for US) and additional efficacy 
analyses at Month 18 (primary for EU), followed by an 18-month Treatment Extension Period, in which 
all patients are treated with vutrisiran. The study was performed in 57 centers in 22 countries. 
Patients with 18 to 85 years of age with a diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis with documented TTR 
mutation, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5 to 130 (inclusive), Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) 
score of ≤3b and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥60% participated in HELIOS-A.  
164 adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy were randomized 3:1 to receive 
vutrisiran 25 mg administered as a SC injection q3M or patisiran (active comparator) 0.3 mg/kg 
administered as an IV infusion q3w (122 vutrisiran and 42 patisiran). Randomization was stratified by 
TTR genotype (V30M vs. non-V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs. ≥50). A small number of patients 
were excluded from the analysis for justified reasons: 8 in the group of vutrisiran and 5 in the group of 
patisiran. 
Efficacy data from HELIOS-A are available at the Month 9 analysis timepoint (data cut-off date of 10 
November 2020).  
A direct comparison between vutrisiran and patisiran was performed only on a pharmacodynamic 
endpoint: the TTR % reduction from baseline.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At month 9, a statistically significant improvement in neuropathy was observed for patients in the 
vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group with a LS mean difference of the mNIS+7 change from 
baseline between groups of -17.00 points. For the EU formal primary analysis of the primary endpoint 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 143/158 
 
 
 
of mNIS+7 a statistically significant, large and clinically meaningful difference in the change from 
baseline was also observed at Month 18 between vutrisiran in HELIOS-A and placebo in APOLLO with a 
treatment difference, LS Mean (95% CI) of -28.55 (-34.00, -23.10).  
In addition, a noticeable difference in improvement in quality of life at 9 months for patients in the 
vutrisiran group compared to the placebo group with a LS mean difference between groups in Norfolk 
QoL-DN change from baseline of -16.2 points occurred. For the key secondary endpoint Norfolk QoL-
DN a statistically significant, large and clinically meaningful difference in the change from baseline at 
Month 18 was demonstrated between vutrisiran in HELIOS-A and placebo in APOLLO with a treatment 
difference, LS Mean (95% CI) of -21.0 (-27.1, -14.9).  
For mNIS+7 48.3% of patients in the vutrisiran group showed an improvement of neuropathy (change 
from baseline mNIS+7 <0 points) at Month 18 compared to 3.9% of placebo (APOLLO) patients. For 
Norfolk QoL-DN, 56.8% of patients in the vutrisiran group had an improvement (<0-point LS mean 
change) at Month 18 compared to 10.4% of placebo patients. 
Several pre-specified sensitivity analyses with no censoring, propensity score and pattern-mixture 
model as well as subgroup analyses have been performed, which are supportive of the beneficial 
effects of vutrisiran observed in the primary analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Effects observed across all mNIS+7 components and all domains of Norfolk QoL-DN are in favour of 
vutrisiran (HELIOS-A) compared to placebo (APOLLO) and across all patient subgroups, with an effect 
seen across the full range of baseline neuropathy severity and across different genetic variants.  
Supportive statistically significant and clinically relevant results were also obtained with 10-meter walk 
test (10-MWT) (with a LS mean difference between groups (95% CI): 0.239 m/s), which is a measure 
of ambulatory ability and gait speed.  
At Month 18, a statistically significant improvement in mBMI for patients in the vutrisiran group 
compared to the placebo group with a LS mean difference between groups of 140.7 kg/m2 × albumin 
g/L was recorded, indicating an improvement in nutritional status for vutrisiran-treated patients 
compared to placebo. This is considered a relevant aspect in hATTR, since it expresses the 
improvement on dysautonomia, which can impact the patient more than the loss of sensation and 
partially the motor function. 
Informal post hoc analysis of key efficacy parameters using MMRM for the within-study comparison of 
vutrisiran and patisiran groups of the HELIOS-A study at Month 18 showed very small mean 
differences (95% CI) between these treatment groups -1.46 (-7.36, 4.43), -1.6 (-8.6, 5.4), 0.034 (-
0.064, 0.132) and 0.1 (-2.0, 2.2) in the change from baseline for mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL-DN, 10MWT 
and R-ODS, respectively. At Month 18 the estimated difference of vutrisiran versus patisiran in the 
change from baseline for mNIS+7 is -1.46 (-7.36, 4.43) leading to a very similar upper bound of 4.43 
compared to Month 9 results (-0.96 [95% CI: -6.14, 4.22]). An “informal non-inferiority” margin of 4 
points is considered acceptable. A relatively larger LS mean difference 14.2 (-21.9, 50.3) was observed 
for the change in mBMI, but this was in favour of vutrisiran. 
TTR reduction at Month 9 was similar or even slightly greater with vutrisiran than with patisiran and in 
the order of 78-82%, which is considered a very high TTR reduction. At Month 18 the reduction in 
serum TTR levels with vutrisiran (84.67%) was determined to be formally non-inferior to the within-
study patisiran arm (80.60%) based on the pre-specified criteria [Median Difference (95% CI) 5.28 
(1.17, 9.25), non-inferiority confirmed if 95% lower CI > -10%].  
Overall, the confirmatory data at month 18 are considered very relevant considering the rapidly 
progressive nature of the disease and show maintenance of the effect.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study population in HELIOS-A was limited to stage 1 and 2 patients with hATTR with 
polyneuropathy and patients with FAP stage 3 were not included. Extrapolation of efficacy data to 
stage 3 patients is not considered appropriate. Very limited data with no patients in vutrisiran who 
progressed to stage 3 at Month 9 and only 2 patients at Month 18 exist. These numbers are very low 
to justify an extrapolation of the indication to include FAP stage 3 patients with hATTR with 
polyneuropathy. The initially proposed indication for Amvuttra (vutrisiran) was modified to accurately 
reflect the population studied and has been agreed as the same as that for the approved product 
Onpattro (patisiran).  
Analyses of the “true” mITT population, implementing two slightly different PMM methods PMM 1 
(hypothetical estimand) and PMM 2 (treatment policy estimand) were provided upon request. There 
was little difference between the estimates of treatment effect based upon the two PMM methods or 
MMRM analyses for the primary, but also for the secondary endpoints. The treatment effect sizes from 
PMM being slightly larger than MMRM did not have any impact on the clinical interpretation of the 
results. Since MMRM was the prespecified analysis, the use of the MMRM results in the SmPC is 
considered acceptable, in order to keep all public information consistent. 
The sustained effect of treatments by month 18 in the important clinical endpoints was shown with 
comparisons between vutrisiran and patisiran in HELIOS-A and patisiran vs. patisiran between HELIOS-
A and APOLLO studies. The estimated difference of vutrisiran versus patisiran at Month 18 (-1.46 [CI: -
7.36, 4.43]) was very similar to the results at Month 9 (-0.96 [95% CI: -6.14, 4.22]) in the change 
from baseline for mNIS+7, showing an “informal non-inferiority” margin of 4 points, which is 
considered acceptable. However, this should be included in the EPAR for future reference.  
Regarding cardiomyopathy, vutrisiran treatment led to favourable trends for NT-proBNP and 
exploratory pre-specified echocardiographic parameters (such as LV wall thickness, LV mass, and 
increases in end diastolic volume and cardiac output) when compared to placebo (from APOLLO). 
Despite methodological limitations, including cross-study comparison and higher baseline NT-proBNP 
values in APOLLO compared to HELIOS-A, the magnitude of effect on these biomarkers/PD parameters 
appears similar for vutrisiran and patisiran. However, a clinically relevant cardiac benefit still needs to 
be confirmed. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Based on the SC administration mode of vutrisiran, injection site reactions (ISRs) were regarded ARDs. 
As of the completed 18-Months HELIOS-A Treatment Period, ISRs were reported in 5 out of 122 
(4.1%) vutrisiran subjects and in 5 (0.6%) of the total 836 doses of vutrisiran administered.  
ISRs included the symptoms bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, and warmth and the respective 
symptoms are included in the description of ISRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. ISRs in vutrisiran treated 
subjects were all mild, did not lead to treatment discontinuation and no subject had more than one 
event. There was no increase in ISRs over time. One further subject experienced one single ISR during 
the Extension Period; apparently, the signs and symptoms in this subject were reported as traumatic 
haematoma and this ISR was reported as moderate. 
Using a frequency criterion for TEAES of an incidence >5% of vutrisiran-treated patients in HELIOS-A 
and >3% higher frequency compared to APOLLO placebo, the following ADRs were also identified and 
reflected in the labelling (based on incidences reported in the completed 18-Months Treatment Period):  
- Arthralgia was reported in 13 (10.7%) of HELIOS-A vutrisiran vs. no APOLLO placebo subjects. One 
subject had a severe AE of arthralgia, apart from this, AEs of arthralgia were mild or moderate, no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 145/158 
 
 
 
event was serious, no AE of arthralgia led to treatment discontinuation, or increased over time. 
Arthralgia is also commonly associated with patisiran and was reported in 4 (9.5%) HELIOS-A 
patisiran subjects. 
- Dyspnoea; the medical concept of dyspnoea, which includes the PTs dyspnoea, dyspnoea, 
exertional, and dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal, respectively was reported in 8 (6.6%) of HELIOS-A 
vutrisiran vs. no APOLLO placebo subjects. AEs within the dyspnoea medical concept were mild or 
moderate in severity, none of the events was severe or serious, or led to treatment discontinuation, 
respectively. AEs of dyspnoea did not increase over time. Dyspnoea is also known to be commonly 
associated with patisiran. 
- Pain in extremity occurred in 18 (14.8%) vutrisiran-treated subjects compared to 8 (10.4 %) 
APOLLO placebo subjects. These events were generally mild or moderate, no event was severe or 
led to treatment discontinuation. No clear pattern with regard to onset of these events in relation of 
vutrisiran administration was apparent. 
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increases (> 1.5 ULN) during the HELIOS-A Treatment Period were 
reported in 11 (9.0%) vutrisiran vs. 1 (2.4%) patisiran subjects (as of the CSR2) and in 1 (1.3%) 
Apollo placebo subject. In the vutrisiran group, one event was considered a TEAE, related, by 
investigator. ALP increase was not associated with clinically significant transaminase or bilirubin 
elevations. In order to inform the treating physicians and patients, respectively, ALP increased has 
been added to the PI as a common ADR within the Investigations SOC based on the higher incidence in 
the Helios-A vutrisiran compared to the patisiran but also the Apollo placebo group.  
The TEAE of abdominal pain was reported with a higher incidence in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group 
(9.0%) vs. the APOLLO placebo group (1.3%) and the HELIOS-A patisiran group (2.4%), however, the 
frequency of TEAEs within the abdominal pain medical concept was very similar in the Helios-A 
vutrisiran vs. the Apollo placebo group, no event was considered treatment related, and the severity of 
respective events was low. Dyspepsia considered related by the investigator was reported in 1.6% 
subjects in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran vs. no subjects in the APOLLO placebo or HELIOS-A patisiran 
group, respectively, however, the frequency of dyspepsia TEAEs (irrespective of causality) was 
numerically lower in the vutrisiran vs. the Apollo placebo as well as the pooled patisiran group. In both 
vutrisiran subjects with dyspepsia considered related to study drug by the investigator, the subjects 
continued vutrisiran without recurrence of dyspepsia.   
A decrease in serum levels of vitamin A is an expected secondary pharmacodynamic effect of reducing 
serum TTR protein and occurred in both HELIOS-A treatment groups: Over the course of the study, 
median percent reduction in vitamin A levels through Month 18 was 63.3% in the vutrisiran group and 
63.4% in the patisiran group (as of the CSR2, 26_AUG-2021). In Helios-A vitamin A was generally 
supplemented at a dose of 2500 to 3000 IU and the SmPC recommendations have been amended 
accordingly. In subject, non-serious AEs of moderate transaminases increased and severe drug-
induced liver injury were attributed to the subject’s vitamin A supplement. In order to ensure that 
patients do not take too high doses of vitamin A, information has therefore been added to the PL that 
the daily vitamin A dose should be taken as recommended by the treating physician. In addition, the 
SmPC warnings and precautions regarding vitamin A deficiency/supplementation during pregnancy 
have been amended as requested over the assessment. 
In the HELIOS-A study, in general, the type of cardiac AEs in vutrisiran-treated patients was consistent 
with those previously reported in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, based on the APOLLO placebo 
group, and the incidences appeared consistently numerically lower in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran group. 
No cardiac AE in the all vutrisiran HELIOS-A study population was considered related to study drug, 
and only one cardiac AE, although not considered related, led to study drug withdrawal. During the 18-
Months HELIOS-A Treatment Period, the incidence of TEAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC was 30.3% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 146/158 
 
 
 
the vutrisiran and 23.8% in the patisiran group. In particular, the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia HLGT 
AEs was approx. three times higher in HELIOS-A vutrisiran compared to HELIOS-A patisiran subjects 
(26.6% vs. 7.1%). However, no cardiac safety concerns derived from ECG evaluations. In contrast to 
the imbalance regarding cardiac arrhythmias, TEAEs in the cardiac failure SMQ (narrow) occurred with 
a considerably lower frequency in the Helios-A vutrisiran (5.7%) compared to the Helios-A patisiran 
group (19.0%).  It is further reassuring, that SAEs in the cardiac disorders SOC were reported with a 
lower incidence in the Helios-A vutrisiran vs. Apollo placebo as well as Helios-A patisiran group (9.0% 
vs. 13.0% and 14.3%, respectively). In the cardiac subpopulation but not in the overall safety 
population, a somewhat higher incidence of syncope was found in HELIOS-A vutrisiran (15.0%) 
compared to both, the HELIOS-A patisiran (7.1%) and APOLLO placebo (8.3%) subjects. Of the six 
cases of syncope in the Helios-A vutrisiran cardiac subpopulation, no event was considered related by 
the Investigator, all concerned isolated events with no apparent pattern in temporal relationship to 
study drug administration or the total number of doses applied until the event, and without recurrenc 
at subsequent injections, respectively. In four of the six subjects concerned, a medical history of 
(orthostatic) hypotension or loss of consciousness was reported. A causal relationship with vutrisiran 
therefore  is considered unlikely. Apart from syncope, the evaluation of cardiac events in the cardiac 
subpopulation  is considered to be generally in line with that of the overall safety population. Taken 
altogether, the currently available cardiac findings with vutrisiran do not raise serious cardiac safety 
concerns. 
The safety profile of vutrisiran was generally consistent across the analysed subgroups (by age, sex, 
race, weight, genotype, FAP stage and geographic region, respectively).  
Justification has been satisfactorily provided over the course of the assessment , labelling inclusion of 
the following AEs in the PI is currently not warranted:  
- rash: In the Helios-A vutrisiran group (Treatment Period) compared to the APOLLO placebo group 
the incidence of TEAEs of rash by PT (5.7% vs. 3.9%) or TEAEs mapped to the rash custom query 
(7.4% vs. 9.1%) was similar. Within the rash medical concept grouping, none of the events in the 
vutrisiran group is considered an injection site reaction. 
- muscle spasm (with an incidence in the HELIOS-A vutrisiran vs. APOLLO placebo and HELIOS-A 
patisiran group of 4.1% vs. 1.3% and 4.8%) and sinusitis (with an incidence of 2.5% vs. no subject 
in both control groups) are both labelled for patisiran. However, the presented data do not provide 
evidence to conclude a class effect for TTR-lowering RNAis. In particular, none of the events of 
sinusitis or within the medical concept of muscle spasm was considered treatment related. 
- peripheral oedema; based on the information provided regarding a severe related event of 
peripheral oedema , including a medical history of cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac failure and peripheral 
oedema, respectively as well as the time course of onset and increase of peripheral oedema, the 
event is not indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction and causality with vutrisiran is uncertain. 
The Applicant has presented the requested updated safety data covering the completed 18 Months 
Treatment Period and the ongoing Extension Period of the Helios-A study as of 26-AUG-2021 as well as 
a comparison of the safety profile of vutrisiran to the pooled (HELIOS-A and APOLLO) patisiran 
population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A numerical imbalance with regard to (related as well as overall) TEAEs in the Eye disorders SOC was 
found within the HELIOS-A study in the vutrisiran compared to the patisiran group (reported in 5.7% 
vutrisiran vs. 0 patisiran and 28.7% vutrisiran vs. 23.8% patisiran subjects, respectively as of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/689555/2022 
Page 147/158 
 
 
 
CSR2). However, the respective comparison with the APOLLO placebo group as well as the detailed 
analysis of the reported related AEs in the HELIOS-A group does not clearly identify a safety signal 
with regard ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency. Based on a generally comparable reduction of 
TTR levels as well as vitamin A levels with vutrisiran compared to patisiran, ocular toxicity would not 
be anticipated for vutrisiran in line with the available knowledge from patisiran. Therefore, the 
recommendation of vitamin A supplementation as well as a warning regarding ocular signs of vitamin A  
deficiency and recommendation for ophthalmological assessment if such symptoms occur, in line with 
the respective PI of patisiran and inotersen, respectively could generally be endorsed for vutrisiran.  
In Helios-A (in Table 14.3.5.3.1 of the CSR2), a steady increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) over 
time was seen, with a mean absolute change (SD) from baseline of 22.19 (35.38) U/L in the vutrisiran 
and of 23.82 (18.17) U/L in the patisiran group at day 673, constituting a mean relative change of 
36.71% for vutrisiran and 32.24% for patisiran, respectively. The mean ALP values still remained 
within the normal reference values. No corresponding increase in ALP was found in the patisiran group 
of the Apollo study. In pre-clinical studies, alkaline phosphatase levels were moderately increased upon 
long-term quarterly dosing of vutrisiran ≥10 mg/kg in rats and in all repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
monthly injections ≥100 mg/kg in monkeys. ALP elevations might be possibly explained by a slower 
ALP clearance from the circulation because of its competition with vutrisiran in binding to hepatic 
ASGPR. The clinical relevance of this seemingly continuous ALP increase is currently unclear and should 
be further evaluated. In the context  of this initial MAA, the reflection of this ADR in the SmPC was 
considered sufficient. 
The incidences of TEAEs in the drug-related hepatic disorders SMQ during the Helios-A Treatment have 
been clarified by the Applicant and do not raise concerns compared to the indicences in the Apollo 
placebo group. However, in a case of a related, severe hepatic SAE of transaminases increased 
reported during the Helios-Extension Period (in a subject, who had received patisiran during study the 
Treatment Period), the considerable increase of transaminases from mostly normal and at most mildly 
elevated levels to > 5xULN AST and > 6xULN ALT after the first dose of vutrisiran as well as a positive 
(milder) re-challenge point towards a causal relationship with vutrisiran. In both instances 
transaminase levels returned to near normal or normal without specific treatment. It should be noted, 
that the subject received a different posology than that currently recommended, i.e. twice the 
recommended single dose administered with a longer treatment interval (of 6 months). The Sponsor 
validated a signal of transaminase elevations which is currently ongoing and has stated to continue 
careful monitoring the reports of transaminase elevations. Further evaluation of events of 
transaminases increased is indicated, however, no labelling changes is considered necessary at 
present. 
The severe related AEs reported on Day 1 in a subject, which included dizziness, dyspepsia, 
hyperhidrosis and hyperthermia, do not correspond to anaphylaxia, however it could not be excluded, 
that these events were caused by other non-IGE-mediated or non-immunologic drug hypersensitivity 
reactions. Apart from this case, no clear safety signal arose with regard to hypersensitivity. Therefore, 
it can be agreed with the Applicant, that at present no specific conditions for vutrisiran home 
administration are required. It should be noted, however, that according the SmPC, Amvuttra should 
be administered by a healthcare professional in any case. Nevertheless, taking into consideration, that 
the overall vutrisiran exposure at the time of the safety data cut-off is limited to 155 subjects, drug 
related hypersensitivity should be further evaluated.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
An open-label study (HELIOS-A) was performed with vutrisiran and patisiran, as a reference 
comparator, in patients with hATRR with polyneuropathy. In order to show superiority to placebo, the 
vutrisiran results from HELIOS-A study were compared to an external placebo group from a double-
blind, placebo-controlled study performed with patisiran (APOLLO). Clinically relevant improvements 
were observed with vutrisiran in appropriate and relevant endpoints evaluating the severity of 
neuropathy (mNIS+7) as well as the quality of life (Norfolk QoL-DN). TTR reduction at Month 18 with 
vutrisiran demonstrated non-inferiority with patisiran in HELIOS-A. A large PD effect on the TTR is 
indicative of the efficacy of vutrisiran, which was demonstrated also with clinical endpoints at Month 
18.  
Vutrisiran is a very similar agent as patisiran with the same MoA and very similar pharmacodynamic 
effect (%TTR reduction, with misfolded TTR being the main pathological aetiology for hATTR), 
developed by the same company. By demonstrating non-inferior TTR reduction from Month 6 to 18

between vutrisiran and patisiran in HELIOS-A and because vutrisiran and patisiran share the same 
mechanism of action, a comparison to the external placebo group of the APOLLO study is considered 
possible. Despite some differences in study setting and baseline characteristics of the patient 
populations of HELIOS-A and APOLLO, as well as potentially different patient expectations (all patients 
received active treatment in HELIOS-A, while half of the patients received placebo in APOLLO), efficacy 
of vutrisiran was shown across the clinical endpoints. Also similarity of results on clinical endpoints 
between vutrisiran and patisiran in HELIOS-A and between the patisiran arms in HELIOS-A and 
APOLLO was observed.  Analyses of the “true” mITT population, implementing two slightly different 
PMM methods PMM 1 (hypothetical estimand) and PMM 2 (treatment policy estimand) were provided 
upon request and showed little differences between the estimates of treatment effect. The treatment 
effect sizes from PMM being slightly larger than MMRM did not have any impact on the clinical 
interpretation of the results. Since MMRM was the prespecified analysis, the use of the MMRM results in 
the SmPC is considered acceptable, in order to keep all public information consistent.  
The initially proposed broad indication including also stage 3 patients has been modified to reflect the 
population studied and it is worded the same as that for the approved product Onpattro (patisiran) 
based on similar findings regarding biomarker/PD parameters and clinical endpoints. 
Taking into consideration that hATTR amyloidosis is an orphan disease and that vutrisiran is a second-
generation siRNA-GalNAc conjugate, the provided safety data could be considered comprehensive, 
however, long-term data > 2 years are still limited. The safety profile of vutrisiran as derived from the 
updated data as of 26-AUG-2021 is considered acceptable and manageable with appropriate labelling 
in the product information.  
As of now the only ADRs identified are arthralgia and pain in extremity, with very common frequency 
each, as well as dyspnoea and injection site reactions (ISRs), occurring commonly each. In addition, 
ALP increased has been added to the PI as a common ADR within the Investigations SOC based on the 
higher incidence in the Helios-A vutrisiran compared to the patisiran but also the Apollo placebo group. 
Vutrisiran is administered subcutaneously once every three months and IRSs occurred in 5 (4.1%) 
vutrisiran subjects during the Helios-A Treatment Period and in 6 vutrisiran subjects overall. Five ISRs 
were mild, one event was moderate, no ISR led to treatment discontinuation, despite no administration 
of premedication and none of the 6 subjects concerned had more than one event. The frequency of 
ISRs was low irrespective of vutrisiran presentation (as a vial or as a prefilled syringe). In contrast to 
vutrisiran, patisiran, which is also indicated for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy, is administered intravenously every three weeks and requires premedication including 
corticosteroids in order to reduce the risk of infusion related reactions (IRRs). Nevertheless, in the 
HELIOS-A patisiran group, IRRs were reported for 10 (23.8%) patients and included 4 SAEs. Dyspnoea 
and arthralgia are also commonly associated with patisiran. In vutrisiran treated subjects, AEs within 
the dyspnoea medical concept were mild or moderate in severity; none of the events were severe or 
serious.  
In one subject other than IGE-mediated or non-immunologic drug hypersensitivity reactions could not 
be excluded, while the case is not compatible with anaphylaxia. Apart from this case, no clear safety 
signal arose with regard to hypersensitivity. Taking the limited safety data-base into consideration, 
drug related hypersensitivity should be further evaluated.  
Vitamin A level reduction with vutrisiran with the proposed posology is comparable to patisiran, and as 
with patisiran no clear ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency toxicity was identified. Nevertheless, 
ocular changes can occur in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and it is important to assess if these 
changes could potentially be related to vitamin A deficiency. Therefore a warning about the ocular 
signs and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency and recommendation for ophthalmological assessment if 
such symptoms occur, as well as recommendation for vitamin A supplementation are included in the 
Assessment report

proposed SmPC. In line with the dose used in the Helios-A study, the recommended daily vitamin A 
supplementation has been amended to 2500 IU – 3000 IU and detailed instructions regarding planned 
and unplanned pregnancies have been implemented. The proposed addition that vitamin A 
supplementation should not be adjusted based on serum vitamin A levels has been deleted from the PI 
as requested as it had rather complicated the decision-making of the physician, as were the suggested 
explanations on vitamin A testing in section 4.5 which did not coincide with the warnings in 
section 4.4. Considering also the potential risk of hypervitaminosis A due to inadequate vitamin A 
supplementation, information was added to the SmPC, that the daily vitamin A dose should not exceed 
2500 -3000 IU, and to the PL, that the daily vitamin A dose should be taken as recommended by the 
treating physician. 
The incidence of TEAEs in the drug-related hepatic disorders SMQ in the Helios-A vutrisiran group 
compared to the Apollo placebo group does not raise concerns. However, further evaluation of events 
of transaminases increased is indicated based on a case of a related, severe, reversible SAE of 
transaminases increased with a positive, milder re-challenge. These events occurred in a subject 
receiving twice the single vutrisiran dose recommended in the SmPC with a longer treatment interval 
(i.e. 50 mg s.c. q6M) though.  
In addition to the AEs of ALP increased, a continuous relative increase in mean ALP by approx. 37% 
was found (but within normal limits of the reference range up to day 673 of the Helios-A study) the 
clinical relevance of which with regard to long-term vutrisiran administration is currently unclear and 
which should be further evaluated.  
Regarding safety, all the outstanding issues have been resolved and the PI has been amended as 
requested. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare, progressive and eventually fatal disease which 
manifests as destabilization of the tetrameric structure of the TTR protein. Vutrisiran is a siRNA 
molecules that uses RNA interference mechanisms to target and silence the expression of wild type 
and variant TTR mRNA and inhibit the synthesis of the TTR protein.  
A large reduction in TTR and large, statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in the 
change from baseline at Month 18 using clinically appropriate tools evaluating the improvement in 
neuropathy have been observed with vutrisiran in an open-label study (HELIOS-A) compared to an 
external placebo group from the clinical program of patisiran (APOLLO). In addition, reduction in TTR 
levels was found to be non-inferior to patisiran used at the approved dosing regimen.  
These results are considered confirmatory for the efficacy of vutrisiran in patients with hATTR with 
stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.  The safety profile of vutrisiran as derived from the presented 
safety data is considered acceptable and manageable with appropriate labelling in the product 
information. 
Therefore, the benefits of vutrisiran in the proposed target population are considered to outweigh the 
risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Amvuttra is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Amvuttra (Vutrisiran) is not similar to Onpattro 
(patisiran), Tegsedi (inotersen) and Vyndaqel (tafamidis) within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Amvuttra is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with 
stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy

1.  Introduction 
On 16 February 2016, the MAH submitted the final study report of a completed paediatric study E773-
G000-202 for decitabine, in context of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH acknowledges that this Article 46 submission is outside of the usual six months period after 
completion  of  a  pediatric  study.  Indeed,  the  end  of  trial  date  for  this  study  was  19th  July  2013  (final 
clinical cut-off date). 
The MAH submitted two separate CSR: 
- an interim CSR dated on 19th January 2012  
- an CSR Addendum dated on 23rd September 2015. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Study  E7373-G000-202  “A  Randomized,  Open-Label,  Multicenter  Study  to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and  Safety of Decitabine as Epigenetic Priming With Induction Chemotherapy in 
Pediatric  Acute  Myelogenous  Leukemia  (AML)  Subjects”  was  conducted  exclusively  by  its  business 
partner, Eisai Inc and is not part of the MAH development programme.  
As such this study is considered a stand-alone study and is not listed as a clinical measure in the MAH 
PIP for Dacogen.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The assessment is essentially based on the resulted in the CSR Addendum dated on 23rd September 
2015 for Study E7373-G000-202 “A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Decitabine as Epigenetic Priming With Induction Chemotherapy in Pediatric Acute 
Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) Subjects.” (named Daco-202 in this report).  
2.3.2.  Clinical study  
Description 
It is hypothesized that pretreatment (i.e., priming) with a hypomethylating agent will increase the 
efficacy of induction chemotherapy for AML. In this study DACO-202, decitabine was studied as an 
epigenetic priming agent using the regimen of a 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of 20 mg/m2 once 
daily for 5 days, immediately before induction chemotherapy. This dosage was chosen based on (1) 
Page 3/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the large amount of safety data collected on the regimen in clinical trials in adults, and (2) data that 
show a 1-hour infusion of decitabine 20 mg/m2 is sufficient to inhibit DNA methyltransferase and 
induce tumor suppressor gene activation as early as 3 to 5 days after treatment initiation. This study 
aimed to provide data on the activity of a standard induction regimen (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and 
etoposide) plus epigenetic priming with decitabine as assessed by standard measures of morphologic 
CR, leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of minimal residual disease 
(MRD).

Page 4/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25 subjects were enrolled in one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio: 
•  Arm A (investigational treatment): Subjects received decitabine priming for 5 days, followed by 
standard induction chemotherapy of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide for 10 days 
•  Arm B (control, reference treatment): Subjects received standard induction chemotherapy of 
daunorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide for 10 days  
The two treatment arms were stratified by age before randomization per ICH and FDA guidance: 1 to 
<2 years, 2 to 11 years, and 12 to 16 years. 
Study population /Sample size

Sample Size 
No statistical justification of the sample size was provided for this exploratory study. The statistical 
plan estimated that a sample size of 40 subjects would provide a reasonable estimate for the 
difference in CR rate between Arm A (Investigational Arm) and Arm B (Control Arm). 
Treatments 
Arm A Only: 
• Decitabine 20 mg/m2 via 1-h intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 5 days (Days 1 to 5) 
Arm A (after completion of decitabine) and Arm B (in sequential order of administration): 
Page 6/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Intrathecal cytarabine administered at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture according to age-
based dosing: 1 to <2 years, 30 mg; ≥2 to <3 years, 50 mg; ≥3 years, 70 mg 
• Daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 (1.67 mg/kg if body surface area [BSA] <0.6 m2) 6-h IV infusion every 
other day over a 5-day period for a total of 3 infusions (Days 6, 8, 10 [Arm A] or Days 1, 3, 5 [Arm B]) 
• Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 (3.3 mg/kg if BSA <0.6 m2) slow IV push (over 15 minutes) every 12 h x 10

Days 1 to 5 [Arm B]) 
Duration of Treatment: 
Arm A: 15 days (5 days’ of decitabine plus 10 days’ of induction chemotherapy) 
Arm B: 10 days (induction chemotherapy only) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint : 
The primary efficacy parameter was the morphologic CR rate. 
The criteria for determining disease response are detailed in the protocol and were based upon the 
criteria established by the International Working Group (IWG) in 2003. Definitions for the response 
categories are summarized as follows: 
• Morphologic complete remission: Requires that the subject achieved a morphologic leukemia-free 
state and had an ANC >1000/µL and platelets >100,000/µL. Hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 
had no bearing on remission status, although the patient had to be independent of transfusions. 
• Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery: Subjects who fulfilled all the 
criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (<1000/µL) or thrombocytopenia (<100,000/µL). 
• Partial remission (PR): Requires all hematologic values as for a CR, but with a decrease of at least 
50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. A value of <5% blasts 
was also considered a PR if any blasts with Auer rods were present. 
• Aplastic/hypoplastic marrow (leukemia not detected): Requires <5% blasts in the aspirate sample 
with marrow spicules, with a count of ≥200 nucleated cells. There was persistence of extramedullary 
disease; no blasts with Auer rods could be present. 
• Leukemia not in remission or treatment failure: Subjects who achieved less than a PR. 
• Recurrence or morphologic relapse: Defined as the reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral 
blood or >5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause. The reappearance or 
development of cytologically proven extramedullary disease also indicated relapse. 
The number and percentage of subjects who achieved a confirmed CR in each treatment arm were 
summarized, along with the corresponding 95% two-sided exact confidence interval (CI). Fisher’s 
exact test was used for testing treatment effect. Complete remission was calculated for the FA 
population as the primary analysis. Complete remission was also calculated for the PP population. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints : 
•  Time to CR 
Page 7/26 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Time to platelet recovery (≥ 100,000/mm3) and time to neutrophil recovery (absolute 
neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1000/mm3) after induction chemotherapy 
•  Minimal residual disease (MRD) following induction chemotherapy 
•  Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS)  
•  DNA methylation following decitabine treatment 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmarcodynamics 
•  Standard parameters of PK profile of decitabine in Arm A on Day 5 immediately before and at 
30 minutes, 60 minutes (immediately before the end of infusion), 65, 90, 120 and 180 minutes 
after the infusion. 
•  Biomarkers of genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation 
Safety endpoints:  
• 
Extent of exposure 
•  AEs,  
•  Clinical laboratory evaluation 
•  Vital signs, physical findings and other safety measurements 
Statistical Methods 
Four populations were analyzed 
Full Analysis (FA) Population included all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment 
and who had at least one postdose efficacy measurement for response. 
Per Protocol (PP) Population included subjects who sufficiently complied with the protocol.  
Safety Population was the group of subjects who signed informed consent, received treatment, and 
had at least one postdose safety assessment. 
Pharmacokinetic Population consisted of all patients who have at least one post-dose evaluable PK 
sample available. 
CHMP assessment comment: 
Global study design as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable for this phase 2 
exploratory study.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The final CSR contains efficacy, PK and safety data for all 25 subjects enrolled in the study as of the 
final clinical cutoff date of 19 Jul 2013. 
Page 8/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 98 patients with AML were screened for entry into the study. Of these 98 subjects, only 25 
subjects were eligible and randomly assigned and treated at one of 11 sites in the US, Canada or 
Australia. Figure 2 presents the subject disposition for the FAS. 
A summary of the overall disposition of subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) at Baseline is presented 
in Table 3. As of the clinical cutoff date, one subject (4%), assigned to Arm A, had discontinued 
treatment due to an AE. Six subjects had died, and one was lost to follow-up. The remaining 18 
subjects completed treatment and were in survival follow-up. 
No major violations occurred in this study. No subjects were excluded from the FAS, safety or PP 
populations.

CHMP assessment comment: 
The study was overall well conducted; the dropout rate (4%, 1/25) is low. Forty subjects were planned 
for this study. However, the study was terminated prematurely after 25 subjects due to slow 
enrollment and the futility of observing a difference in remission rate between treatments arms 
following DSMB recommendation. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics: 
Page 10/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the median age of subjects were 8 years, 80% of them were white subjects. Only one subject 
in the 1 to 2-year age stratum was enrolled and assigned in the Arm B.  
Baseline disease characteristics and cancer history: 
All 25 subjects had confirmed de novo AML, a total of 21 subjects (84%) had >20% bone marrow 
blasts at baseline (Arm A: 9/11, 81.8% versus Arm B: 12/14 85.7%). The median time from diagnosis 
of AML to study entry was 2.0 days (range 0-4 days) and was the same for both arms. The most 
common FAB classification was M2 (8/25, 32%) which was more frequently in arm B than in arm A 
(n=6 42.9% versus n=2 18.2%).  
Page 11/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP assessment comment:  
The demographic and baseline characteristics were globally well balanced between 2 arms in this small 
sample size study.  
The use of prior medication including antineoplastic agents was similar between 2 arms. 
Efficacy results 
Primary efficacy results: Complete Remission rate 
Page 12/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As shown in tables 8, 3 of the 11 subjects (27.3%) in Arm A and 7 of 14 subjects (50.0%) in Arm B 
achieved a CR in Study DACO-202. In Arm A, 1 subject did not achieve leukemic remission (ie, 
treatment failure), 1 subject did not complete induction chemotherapy due to a serious adverse event, 
and 6 subjects achieved a morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). The total 
remission rate (CR+CRi) for Arm A was 81.8%. In Arm B, 1 subject had a partial response and 1 
subject had aplastic marrow at the completion of induction chemotherapy; the total remission rate 
(CR+CRi) was 85.7%. 
The response rates (CR+CRi) between Arms A and B were similar for both subjects age 2 to 11 years 
and subjects age 12 to 16 years. In Arm A, which included decitabine priming, the response rate 
(CR+CRi) was numerically higher among subjects in the younger age group (2 to 11 years; n=6/7, 
85.7%) compared with those in the older age group (12 to 16 years; n=3/4, 75.0%). However, these 
results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects in each age group. 
Myeloblast count: The median bone marrow myeloblast count at Baseline was 62.5% in Arm A and 
58.5% in Arm B. Three weeks after the last dose of induction chemotherapy, median myeloblast 
counts were 1.5% and 1.0% in Arms A and B, respectively. This corresponds to a change from 
baseline of -52.4% and -55.0% for Arms A and B, respectively. 
CHMP assessment comment:  
Only one subject enrolled was younger than 2 years, analysis was limited to the 2 older age groups (2-
11 and 12-16 years old).  
The morphologic CR was lower in Arm A than in Arm B (3/11 27.3% versus 7/14, 50%). The total 
remission rate (CR+CRi) seems similar between two arms (81.8% in Arm A versus 85.7% in Arm B. In 
the Arm A, the response rate seems higher in subjects aged 2 to 11 years than older subjects aged 12 
to 16 years (85.7% versus 75%).  
The table 14.1.7.1 “Hematology at Baseline” showed that subjects in Arm A had lower baseline ANC 
value. Many of these subjects had delayed recovery in ANC counts. These differences were considered 
clinically relevant by the sponsor, and may have contributed to the lower CR rate and higher incidence 
of cytopenias (higher CRi) observed in Arm A as compared with Arm B. However due to the small 
Page 13/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sample size in each group, these results should be interpreted with caution and no firm conclusion 
could be drawn from this study. 
Secondary Efficacy endpoints: 
Time to Complete remission 
The median time to CR from the date of randomization was 43 days for subjects in Arm A and 37 days 
for subjects in Arm B. The median time to remission (CR+CRi) was 41 days for subjects in Arm A and 
33 days for subjects in Arm B.  
CHMP assessment comment:  
Clinical response was evaluated at the same time point (Visit 6, Day 35) during the study for 2 arms. 
Given the 5 days of decitabine treatment prior to the start of induction chemotherapy for subjects in 
Arm A, the median time to response between the treatment arms was comparable.  
Page 14/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Time to neutrophil/platelet Recovery  
The median time to neutrophil recovery (ANC ≥1,000/mm3) from the date of randomization was 
longer for subjects in Arm A compared with subjects in Arm B (25 versus 18.0 days). The median time 
to platelet recovery (≥100,000/mm3) from the date of randomization was longer for subjects in Arm A 
compared with Arm B (22 versus 14.5 days).  
CHMP assessment comment:  
The median time to both neutrophil and platelet recovery was approximately 8 days longer for subjects 
in Arm A than in Arm B. These differences in recovery time may be in part due to the additional 5 days 
of decitabine treatment for subjects in Arm A, which would appear to delay recovery time when 
measured at a fixed timepoint (Visit 6 for all subjects).  
It is important to note that subjects may have received platelet transfusion and the baseline ANC value 
were lower in Arm A, which could also affect time to counts.  
Here again, these results should be interpreted with caution due to small size of subjects in each arm.  
Minimum residual disease analyses 
Page 15/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP assessment comment:  
Only six subjects assigned to treatment Arm A had viable MRD measurement at baseline and at end-
of-treatment. No subjects in Arm B had viable sample. Five of 6 subjects in Arm A were MRD+ at 
baseline and showed MRD levels below the threshold of detection at end-of-treatment. All of these 
subjects achieved a morphological CR. None of comparative conclusion between 2 arms can be drawn 
from these results. 
Leukemia-free survival and Overall Survival 
As of the clinical cutoff date, 6 subjects had died (3 subjects each in arm), all more than 30 days 
posttreatment; 18 subjects were still alive (1 subject who had achieved a CR at Visit 6 had relapse of 
leukemia and was still alive).  
Page 16/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHMP assessment comment:  
There were insufficient data as of the clinical cutoff date to perform an analysis of LFS. Median OS 
could not be estimated. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma concentration of decitabine were quantifiable in all 11 decitabine-treated subjects up to the last 
time point of 180 minutes. Selected PK parameters of decitabine in overall pediatric subjects and by 
age group are shown in Table 13. Mean plasma concentration-time profile on linear scale is presented 
in Figure 5.  
Page 17/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Postinfusion, plasma concentrations declined in a bi-exponential manner. 
Mean (SD) PK values for the 11 decitabine-treated subjects were: Cmax, 294 (104) ng/mL; AUC0-∞, 
215 (72.5) ng•h/mL; CL, 128 (92.3) L/h; Vdss, 45.5 (41.1) L; t½, 0.453 (0.0804) h; tmax, 0.831 h 
(0.253).  
CHMP assessment comment:  
Intersubject variability in PK values was higher than expected, but did not appear to be age related 
given the limited number of subjects. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Results for pharmacodynamics assessments such as DNA methylation, biomarker identification, mRNA 
expression, clonogenic assay are not found in this CSR. 
CHMP assessment comment 
Efficacy summary based on the efficacy results from 25 pediatric subjects (n=11 in Arm A and n=14 in 
Arm B): 
There were no apparent differences in remission rates (CR+CRi) between subjects in Arm A who 
received decitabine priming, and subjects in Arm B, who received only induction chemotherapy. 
Response rates (CR+CRi) as of the Visit 6 timepoint (3 weeks post-chemiotherapy) were similar 
between treatment arms (81.8% [n=9/11] for Arm A and 85.7% [n=12/14]) for Arm B). However, a 
numerically higher CR rate was noted in Arm B (Arm A, 27.3%; Arm B, 50.0%). The significantly lower 
baseline ANC values in Arm A could partially contribute to the lower CR rate and higher incidence of 
CRi in Arm A.  
Median times to ANC and platelet recovery appeared to be approximately 8 days longer in Arm A than 
Arm B. These differences in recovery time may be in part due to the additional 5 days of decitabine 
treatment for subjects in Arm A, which would appear to delay recovery time when measured at a fixed 
timepoint (Visit 6 for all subjects). 
Seven subjects had leukemic relapse or death at the clinical cutoff date; there was no relevant 
difference between the 2 treatment arms. 
Intersubject variability in PK values was higher than expected, but did not appear to be age related 
given the limited number of subjects. 
Page 18/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall efficacy results should be interpreted with caution due to small size of subjects in each arm. 
Safety results 
All  subjects  in  Arm  A  completed  1  cycle  of  5-Day  decitabine  treatment;  no  subjects  treated  with 
decitabine had a dose modification. 
The number of chemotherapy infusions and median relative dose intensities for each chemotherapeutic 
agent were similar between the treatment arms, except for cytarabine. Subjects in Arm B received on 
average 1 day more of treatment with cytarabine, with a dose intensity approximately 83 mg/m2/week 
higher, compared with subjects in Arm A. These results appear to be due to the results of 1 subject in 
Arm A, who received only 1 dose of cytarabine.

a: TRT in Arm A was defined as a nonresolving Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic or hematologic toxicity, or time to platelet recovery 
(≥  100,000/mm3)  and  neutrophil  recovery  (≥  1000/mm3)  that  continued  beyond  55  days  following  the  last  day  of  induction 
chemotherapy, in the absence of leukemia.  
b: 1 subject (1006-1004) did not attain remission during the treatment period of the study. Source:  Tables 14.3.1 and 14.3.2.  
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs,  occurring  in  50%  or  more  of  subjects  overall,  were  vomiting 
(n=15/ [60%]); anemia,  decreased appetite, diarrhea, and  white blood cell count decreased, each of 
which  occurred  in  14  of  the  25  subjects  (56.0%);  and  nausea  (n=13/25,  52%).  These  TEAEs  were 
consistent  with  the  subjects’  underlying  AML  diagnosis  and  the  known  safety  profiles  of  study 
treatment.  
Treatment-emergent  AEs  that  occurred  in  at  least  four  more  subjects  in  Arm  A  (decitabine)  than  in 
Arm B included decreased appetite (Arm A, n=9 [81.8%]; Arm B n=5 [35.7%]), constipation (Arm A, 
n=7  [63.6%];  Arm  B,  n=2  [14.3%]),  hypotension  (Arm  A,  n=7  [63.6%];  Arm  B,  n=1  [7.1%]), 
catheter  site  erythema  (Arm  A,  n=6  [54.5%];  Arm  B,  n=2,  [14.3%]),  and  catheter  site  hemorrhage 
(Arm A, n=3 [27.3%]; Arm B, n=0).  
Adverse  events  that  occurred  in  at  least  three  more  subjects  in  Arm  B  than  in  Arm  A  (in  decreasing 
order of frequency) were febrile neutropenia (57.1% vs. 27.3%), weight decreased (35.7% vs. 27.3%), 
epistaxis (35.7% vs. 9.1%), neutrophil count decreased (35.7% vs. 0), oropharyngeal pain (28.6% vs. 
9.1%), and ear pain (21.4% vs. 0).

Eight  subjects  (72.7%)  had  a  TEAE  reported  as  related  to  decitabine  by  the  investigator.  Causal 
relationship was not captured for the chemotherapy alone. 
Treatment-Related Toxicity 
One decitabine-treated subject had a treatment-related toxicity (TRT). Subject 1015-1001 had Grade 3 
decreased  WBC  (protocol-defined  TRT)  on  Day  7  and  Grade  3  anemia  on  Day  24.  Both  events  were 
reported by the investigator to be possibly related to decitabine. However, neither event was reported 
as serious and no action was taken. The subject had not recovered at the time this CSR was prepared. 
Grade 3-4 Adverse Events 
All but 2 subjects had at least 1 Grade 3-4 TEAE: 11/11 in arm A, 12/14 in arm B.  
The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-4  AEs,  occurring  in  25%  or  more  of  subjects  overall,  were 
anaemia  (n=14/25,  56.0%),  white  blood  cell  count  decreased  (n=14/25,  56.0%),  febrile  neutropenia 
(n=11/25,  44.0%),  platelet  count  decreased  (n=10/25,  40.0%),  and  thrombocytopenia  (n=8/25, 
32.0%).  These  TEAEs  are  all  consistent  with  the  subjects'  underlying  disease  or  the  known  safety 
profile of study treatment. 
Severe TEAEs that occurred in at least three more subjects in Arm A than in Arm B were hypokalaemia 
(36.4% vs. 7.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3% vs. 0). Severe TEAEs that occurred in at least three 
more subjects in Arm B than in Arm A were febrile neutropenia (57.1% vs. 27.3%), neutrophil count 
decreased (35.7% vs. 0), and stomatitis (21.4% vs. 0). 
No Grade 5 events occurred in this study. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Two  subjects  in  Arm  A  had  serious  TEAEs.  One  subject  had  2  SAEs  (appendicitis  and  large  intestine 
perforation)  on  Study  Day  6  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  The  second  subject  had  lower 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage. One subject in Arm B had an SAE of sepsis on Day 35, after completing 
Page 20/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the course of study treatment. The investigator rated the event as moderate and the subject recovered. 
None of the SAES were reported by the investigator as being related to study treatment. 
There were no AEs that led to decitabine dose modification (interruption/delay/reduction). 
None of the 11 subjects in Arm A had a decitabine dose modification. 
One  subject  (1018-1001)  had  two  SAEs,  appendicitis  and  large  intestine  perforation,  which  led  to 
treatment discontinuation on Study Day 6. There were no AEs that led to dose modification. 
Deaths 
There were no induction-related deaths. No deaths occurred during the treatment period or within 30 
days after last dose. However, six deaths did occur posttreatment, 3 in each arm. 
All six deaths occurred more than 30 days after the subjects’ last dose of study treatment. There did 
not appear to be any differences between treatment arms in either the timing or causes of death. 
For two subjects, death was attributed to progressive disease (i.e., AML). Two deaths were attributed 
to  “other”  reasons,  namely  multiorgan  system  failure.  One  subject  died of  complications  due  to  bone 
marrow transplant approximately 7 months after EOT of this study. The sixth subject (1006-1004) died 
of  an  adverse  drug  reaction  (ADR)  to  additional  anticancer  treatment  approximately  8  months  after 
EOT. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Of note, two subjects in Arm A did not have baseline lab values recorded. Subjects in Arm A had lower 
mean  and  median  ANC  values,  and  lower  mean  platelet  count,  compared  with  those  in  Arm  B  at 
Baseline. Furthermore, while minimum ANC and platelet count values were similar between treatment 
arms,  Arm  B  had  much  higher  maximum  values.  Median  baseline  chemistry  laboratory  values  were 
similar between treatment arms in the FAS. 
Page 21/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Postbaseline  Changes  in  Laboratory  Values:  Mean  serum  chemistry  values  appeared  to  fluctuate  or 
increase over time in both treatment arms. In general, Arm A  had higher mean alkaline phosphatase 
values at most time points. Mean creatinine levels increased over the course of the study in Arm A, but 
not in Arm B. No other meaningful changes were observed (including potassium). 
Hematology: Grade 3-4 baseline hematologic values were similar between treatment arms, except for 
ANC. Eight subjects (72.7%) in Arm A compared with four subjects (28.6%) in Arm B had Grade 3-4 
ANC values at Baseline, consistent with the known variability in disease severity.  
Shifts  from  normal  (Grade  0)  or  Grade  1  at  Baseline  to  either  Grade  3  or  4  during  treatment  were 
observed  more  frequently  in  Arm  B  than  in  Arm  A  for  hemoglobin  (Arm  A:  n=1/9,  11.1%;  Arm  B: 
n=3/14, 21.4%), lymphocytes (Arm A: n=1/9, 11.1%; Arm B: n=8/14, 57.1%), ANC (Arm A: n=1/9, 
11.1%;  Arm  B:  n=9/14,  64.3%),  and  leukocytes  (Arm  A:  n=5/9,  55.6%;  Arm  B:  n=11/14,  78.6%). 
The  intergroup  differences  in  shifts  in  lymphocyte,  leukocyte,  and  ANC  values  may  be  clinically 
meaningful, however, the number of subjects is small. 
Page 22/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All  subjects  in  the  Safety  population  with  baseline  data  had  at  least  one  postbaseline  hematologic 
laboratory  abnormality  that  was  rated  Grade  3  or  4.  However,  none  were  deemed  serious  or  led  to 
discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of Grade 3-4 lymphocyte count was higher in Arm B (n=8, 
88.9%)  than  in  Arm  A  (n=1,  14.3%).  No  other  clinically  meaningful  intergroup  differences  were 
observed for total incidence of Grade 3-4 hematologic laboratory abnormalities. 
One subject in Arm A had protocol-defined treatment-related toxicity, namely Grade 3 decreased WBC. 
Profound neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are expected events during induction chemotherapy.  
Serum  Chemistry:  One  subject  in  Arm  A  had  a  Grade  4  potassium  value  at  Baseline,  which  was  also 
Grade 4 during decitabine treatment, but resolved to Grade 0 on Day 6. One subject in Arm B had a 
Grade 3 glucose value at Baseline, which was also Grade 3 on Day 2 and Visit 6, but Grade 0 or 1 at all 
other time points during treatment, including the end-of-treatment visit. 
Page 23/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  other  Grade  3-4  values  for  serum  chemistry  parameters  were  observed  at  Baseline.  Shifts  from 
normal  (Grade  0)  or  Grade  1  at  Baseline  to  either  Grade  3  or  4  during  treatment  were  observed  for 
ALT (Arm A: n=0; Arm B: n=2), AST (Arm A: n=0; Arm B: n=1), glucose (Arm A: n=0; Arm B: n=1), 
and  potassium  (Arm  A:  n=1;  Arm  B:  n=0).  There  did  not  appear  to  be  any  meaningful  differences 
between treatment arms. 
A total of 8 subjects (Arm A: n=5/11, 45.4%; Arm  B: n=3/14 21.4%) had one or more postbaseline 
Grade  3-4  serum  chemistry  values.  The  most  frequently  occurring  serum  chemistry  abnormality  was 
low potassium. Overall, 10 subjects (Arm A: n=7/11, 63.6%; Arm B: n=3/14, 21.4%) had low (Grade 
1-4)  postbaseline  potassium  values.  These  were  Grade  3-4  in  seven  subjects  (28%)  overall,  and  the 
incidence was higher in Arm A than in Arm B (Arm A: n=6/11, 54.5%; Arm B: n=1/14, 7.1%). These 
findings  are  consistent  with  sequelae  of  chemotherapy  as  well  as  those  previously  observed  with 
decitabine  in  adult  subjects  with  AML  (Study  DACO-016;  where  13.8%  vs.  8.2%  of  subjects  in  the 
decitabine  and  TC  arms,  respectively,  had  a  shift  in  potassium  level  from  Grade  0-2  at  Baseline  to 
Grade 3-4 during treatment). 
Grade  3-4  low  potassium  values  were  the  most  frequently  reported  serum  chemistry  abnormalities. 
Hypokalemia  was  monitored  by  the  sponsor  throughout  the  study,  and  were  presented  to  the  DSMB 
following  discussions  with  the  principal  investigators.  Hypokalemia  was  most  likely  due  to  GI 
disturbances  and  electrolyte  imbalances  from  chemotherapy-induced  vomiting;  all  cases  were 
manageable with supportive care, such as potassium supplementation or parenteral nutrition. 
No Grade 3-4 changes in bilirubin or creatinine were reported. 
Vital signs 
There were no meaningful differences in mean or median values between treatment arms for any vital 
sign  parameter.  No  significant  trends  were  noted  in  mean  blood  pressure,  pulse,  respiration  rate, 
weight, or body temperature from Baseline over time for either of the treatment arms.  
Vital sign findings were considered by the sponsor to be clinically significant if they were severe (Grade 
3  or  4),  reported  as  serious,  or  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  Overall,  vital  sign  parameters  were 
reported  as  a  TEAE  as  follows:  pyrexia  (n=8),  hypotension  (including  the  preferred  term  ‘orthostatic 
hypotension’)  (n=8)  and  hypertension  (n=3).  All  of  these  were  mild  or  moderate,  except  for  one 
subject in Arm A who had multiple episodes of Grade 3 hypotension and one subject in Arm B who had 
Grade  3  pyrexia.  Changes  in  blood  pressure  were  reported  as  TEAEs  by  the  investigator  more 
frequently in Arm A than in Arm B. 
Electrocardiogram Data 
Electrocardiograms  were  not  performed  routinely  per  protocol  in  this  study.  However,  some  cardiac 
TEAEs  were  recorded.  Tachycardia  and  sinus  tachycardia  were  reported  more  frequently  in  Arm  A 
(n=6, 54.5%) compared with Arm B (n=2, 14.3%). All of the recorded events were rated Grade 1 or 
“mild”  except  for one  subject  in  Arm  A  who  had  Grade  3  tachycardia  on  Study  Day  16  in  association 
with  Grade  3  febrile  neutropenia  (onset  Day  15),  Grade  3  hypotension  (onset  Day  16),  and  serious 
Grade  3  lower  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  (onset  Day  16).  The  subject  recovered  from  all  of  the 
events, which the investigator reported as being not related to study treatment.  
CHMP assessment comment 
Page 24/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All patients in both treatment arms presented at least 1 TEAE.  
AE reported in at least 50 % of the patients, both treatment arms included, are in line with the known 
safety profile of decitabine and associated chemotherapy (cytarabine, daunorubicine, etoposide). 
Safety profiles appeared similar in both arms, despite higher incidence of severe hypokalaemia (36.4% 
vs. 7.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3% vs. 0) in decitabine arm. 
All subjects had at least 1 Grade 3-4 TEAE in arm A, and 85% of the patients in arm B. 
There was no treatment-related death. 
3 patients presented serious AE, none assessed as treatment related:  
-  2  in  arm  A:  1  patient  with  appendicitis  and  large  intestine  perforation,  leading  to  chemotherapy 
interruption, and & patient with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. 
- 1 in arm B: sepsis at D35. 
Clinical  Laboratory  Evaluation,  vital  signs  and  electrocardiogramms  did  not  raise  safety  signal  in 
decitabine arm in paediatric population. 
Based on data provided, no safety signal was raised and reported AE are in line with the known safety 
profile of decitabine. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results from the Study Daco-202, a Phase 2 multicenter study of decitabine epigenetic priming 
prior to induction chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in children with AML showed: 
• 
There were no apparent differences in remission rates (CR+CRi) between subjects in Arm A 
who received decitabine priming and subjects in Arm B, who received only induction 
chemotherapy. However, a numerically higher CR rate was noted in Arm B (Arm A, 27.3%; 
Arm B 50.0%).  
•  Median times to ANC and platelet recovery appeared to be approximately 8 days longer in Arm 
A than Arm B. This longer time to blood count recovery may be due at least in part to the 
additional 5 days of decitabine treatment in Arm A. 
The significantly lower baseline ANC values in Arm A may also contribute to the lower CR rate 
and longer recovery time in Arm A. 
 The incidence of remission failure at Visit 6 was similar between the two treatment arms. 
 Seven subjects had leukemic relapse or death at the clinical cutoff date; there was no relevant 
difference between the two treatment arms. 
• 
• 
•  High intersubject variability in decitabine PK parameters was observed; however, there did not 
appear to be an age-related trend among the limited number of subjects. 
•  Safety profiles appeared similar in both arms, despite higher incidence of severe hypokalaemia 
(36.4% vs. 7.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3% vs. 0) in decitabine arm. 
• 
 There were no induction-related deaths 
Page 25/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  No safety signal was raised and reported AE are in line with the known safety profile of 
decitabine.  
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The addition of decitabine pretreatment had no effect on clinical response rates or MRD results when 
compared with chemotherapy alone. The increased time to response and time to blood cell count 
recovery for subjects pretreated with decitabine was likely the result of the additional 5-day period 
before induction chemotherapy was started for subjects in decitabine Arm A. 
No safety signal was raised and reported AE are in line with the known safety profile of decitabine. 
Overall,  it  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  data  from  Study  E7373-G000-202  alone  do  not  influence 
the benefit-risk balance and therfore no SPC changes are deemed necessary for Dacogen at this time.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  is  a  complete,  Article  8(3)  application  for  ADASUVE  (loxapine)  for  a  known  active  substance 
(loxapine) through the centralised procedure. The product is intended for prescription only. 
Loxapine is an antipsychotic agent belonging to the dibenzoxazepine class. The antipsychotic effects of 
Loxapine may primarily be attributable to its antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors. Loxapine also has 
5-HT2A  antagonist  activity  and  has  anti-cholinergic,  anti-histaminergic  and  anti-alpha-adrenergic 
properties. Loxapine has been approved as oral and/or injectable formulations in Member States of the 
European Union (EU) and other regions (e.g US, Canada) for the treatment of schizophrenia and/or the 
treatment  of  agitation  associated  with  specified  psychotic  disorders.  It  was  firstly  approved  for 
marketing in the EU in the 70’s. Currently, Loxapine is available in France as film coated tablets, oral 
solution and intramuscular (i.m) injection. 
The  following  indication  and  posology  were  initially  applied  for:    ADASUVE  is  indicated  for  the  rapid 
control  of  agitation  in  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  or  bipolar  disorder.  The  recommended  initial 
dose  of  ADASUVE  is  10  mg.  A  lower  dose  of  5  mg  may  be  given,  on  the  basis  of  individual  clinical 
status,  which  should  also  include  consideration  of  medicinal  products  already  administered  either  for 
maintenance  or  acute  treatment.  A  second  dose  of  ADASUVE,  5  or  10  mg,  may  be  administered  2 
hours after the first, on the basis of individual clinical status. ADASUVE is intended for short-term use 
only.  The maximum daily dose of ADASUVE of 30 mg should not be exceeded and not more than three 
inhalation units should be given in any 24 hour period. 
The  final  recommended  indication  and  posology  by  the  CHMP  is:  ADASUVE  is  indicated  for  the  rapid 
control of mild-to-moderate agitation in adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Patients 
should  receive  regular  treatment  immediately  after  control  of  acute  agitation  symptoms.  The 
recommended  initial  dose  of  ADASUVE  is  9.1  mg.  A  second  dose  can  be  given  after  2  hours,  if 
necessary. No more than two doses should be administered.  A lower dose of 4.5 mg may be given if 
the 9.1 mg dose was not previously tolerated by the patient or if the physician decides a lower dose is 
more appropriate. In this report, 10 mg and 5 mg dose correspond to the strengths of 9.1mg and 4.5 
mg, respectively and that are expressed in delivered doses. 
Agitation  can  be  a  complication  of  several  mental  illnesses,  including  schizophrenia,  mania,  delirium 
and  dementia.  Schizophrenia  and  bipolar  disorder  are  common  disorders  with  a  worldwide  lifetime 
morbidity risk of about 1% for schizophrenia and about 0.9% to 2.1% for bipolar disorder I and II. 
Agitation can be defined as a state of motor restlessness accompanied by mental tension. Patients who 
experience agitation describe feeling an inner distress (nervous, restless, overwhelmed, out of control, 
anguish,  panic)  that  may  progress  to  an  outwardly  apparent  dysfunctional  state  manifested  by 
hostility,  difficulty  controlling  impulses,  uncooperative  behaviour  and  increased  potential  for  violence. 
The  time  course  for  agitation  escalation  can  be  minutes,  hours  or  days,  and  patients  may  require 
prolonged treatment.  
Currently,  the  standard  of  care  in  the  treatment  of  acute  agitation  is  tranquilisation  with 
benzodiazepines,  antipsychotics,  or  combination  of  both  pharmacological  classes.  Antipsychotic  drugs 
are available in a variety of pharmaceutical forms, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, 
oral liquids, and i.m injections.

ADASUVE  (loxapine)  is  a  pre-dispensed  inhalation  powder.  The  product  is  a  hand-held  device  with  a 
mouthpiece for single use by inhalation of a 4.5 mg or a 9.1 mg delivered doses of the antipsychotic 
loxapine.  The  product  is  based  on  the  applicant’s  Staccato®  delivery  system.  Oral  inhalation  through 
the  product  initiates  the  rapid  heating  of  a  thin  film  of  loxapine  to  form  a  drug  vapour,  which 
condenses  into  aerosol  particles.  This  new  method  of  administration  (oral  inhalation)  is  intended  to 
ensure  peak  plasma  levels  in  the  systemic  circulation  within  minutes  after  administration  thus 
according  to  the  applicant  addressing  the  unmet  need  for  rapid  onset  of  sedation  by  non-invasive 
administration. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  drug  product  Adasuve  contains  the  active  substance  loxapine.  This  is  presented  as  a  fully-
integrated  drug-device  combination  product,  for  single  use.  It  is  available  in  two  doses:  4.5  mg  and 
9.1  mg  of  Loxapine.  There  are  no  excipients  in  the  drug  product  and  no  drug  overages.  Fully 
assembled Staccato Loxapine devices are packaged in a multi-laminate foil pouch. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  substance, 
loxapine  (INN)  or  2-Chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)dibenz[b,f][1,4] 
oxazepine,  is  a  known  active  substance  not  described  in  any  pharmacopeia.    Loxapine  is  a  white  to 
yellowish,  odourless  crystalline  powder,  slightly  soluble  in  water,  sparingly  soluble  in  methanol  and 
freely soluble in acetone, chloroform, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. Loxapine base exists at least 
in two different crystal phases, polymorph I and polymorph II. The two polymorphic forms of the drug 
substance can be distinguished by means of IR spectroscopy, and the batch data demonstrate that the 
manufacturer  of  the  active  substance  produces  consistently  the  crystalline  form  corresponding  to  the 
polymorph II. The molecular structure is as depicted below: 
Manufacture 
Starting  materials  are  clearly  defined  and  characterized.  Detailed  information  is  included  in  the 
Restricted Part of the ASMF. The drug substance was adequately characterised with regard to structure 
and  impurities.  One  of  the  loxapine  API  impurities  may  have  genotoxic  potential,  but  it  has  been 
demonstrated that this impurity is not present in the drug substance.

Specification 
The drug substance specification was established in-house by the Applicant. It is based on the release 
specification  provided  by  the  active  substance  manufacturer,  supplemented  with  tests  for  impurities 
and  microbial  limits  and  some  differences  in  the  acceptance  criteria.  The  Applicant  will  accept  only 
those loxapine base lots from the active substance manufacturer that meet all specification acceptance 
criteria. The active substance specification is in general acceptable, and includes tests for appearance, 
Identification  (IR  and  HPLC),  heavy  metals  (Ph  Eur),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  lost  on  drying 
(PH  Eur),  residue  on  ignition  or  sulfated  ash  (Ph  Eur),  melting  point  (Ph  Eur),  residual  solvent  (GC). 
Batch  analysis  data  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  proposed  active  substance  specification  were 
provided  for  3  production  scale  batches.  Supporting  data  of  several  development  batches  was  also 
provided.  
Stability 
Stability  data  on  the  active  substance  were  provided  for  five  batches  stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  (6-36 
months)  and  three  batches  stored  at  40°C/75%RH  (6  months).  The  batches  were  stored  in  the 
commercial  packaging  (double  LDPE  bag/PE  drum).  Storage  under  long-term  and  accelerated 
conditions  did  not  show  any  up-  or  downward  trends,  indicating  that  the  batches  remain  stable 
throughout  the  tested  period.  Stress  testing  and  photo  degradation  studies  showed  no  significant 
degradation.  Based on the stability data presented the justified retest period has been accepted.

2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  objective  was  to  develop  a  rapid  systemic  delivery  of  loxapine  by  inhalation  of  a  thermally 
generated aerosol.  
The  pharmaceutical  development  of  the  product  was  adequately  performed.  Loxapine  base  was 
selected  over  the  salt  form  because  the  properties  of  the  base  form  are  more  suitable  for  the 
requirements  of  the  Staccato  Loxapine  for  Inhalation  design.  In  particular,  the  base  form  is  more 
volatile and therefore can be vaporized at a lower temperature, giving higher aerosol purity. 
The Staccato Loxapine system for inhalation is a fully integrated drug-device combination product, for 
single use. It consists of a breath actuation mechanism, active substance coated onto a heat package 
(which  produces  a  thermally  generated  aerosol)  and  a  medical-grade  plastic  housing  that  forms  the 
airway, which controls and directs the airflow of the vaporized drug. A schematic view of the Staccato 
Loxapine system is presented in Figure 1. 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 12/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When  a  user  inhales  through  the  Staccato  Loxapine  mouthpiece,  their  breath  deflects  a  battery 
activated  starter  and  this  in  turn  initiates  a  controlled,  gasless,  oxidation-reduction  (redox)  reaction 
that  liberates  heat.  Following  heat  generation,  the  thin  film  of  loxapine  that  is  coated  onto  the  heat 
package  vaporises  completely  and  instantly.  The  vapour  then  cools  in  the  airflow  and  condenses  to 
form aerosol particles. 
The  active  substance  properties  that  may  impact  drug  product  performance  have  been  identified  and 
taken  into  account  during  product  development.  These  include  solubility,  solution  stability, 
compatibility  with  the  heat  package  substrate,  thermal  stability  during  aerosolisation  and  impurities. 
Loxapine  particle  size  and  morphology  do  not  affect  the  performance  of  the  drug  product,  since 
loxapine is fully dissolved prior to further processing during drug product manufacture. 
The  following  finished  product  critical quality  attributes  (CQA)  that  can impact  product  quality,  safety 
and  efficacy,  were identified  as  part  of  the  development  process:  mean  emitted  dose and  uniformity, 
aerosol impurities and particle size distribution.  
The  applicant  has  provided  ample  information  on  the  device,  its  specifications,  design,  purpose  and 
operation.  For  the  evaluation  of  the  safety  and  performance  of  the  device  the  requirements  of  the 
European  Medical  Devices  Directive  93/42/EEC  (MDD)  were  used  as  the  reference.  The  manufacturer 
has  extensively  tested  the  performance  and  the  safety  of  the  device.  The  heat  package  temperature 
directly  impacts  the  performance  of  the  device.  Adequate  data  have  been  provided  to  show  that  the 
heat package consistently produces heat to evaporate the active substance that is coated on the outer 
surfaces. The system proved to remain reliable under shipping and storage conditions 
Safety testing further included the release of particulates other than the active substance, e.g coming 
from a leaking heat package, the temperature of the outside of the device and the temperature of the 
aerosol generated by the device. 
The usability of the device has been extensively tested with placebo devices. 
Overall,  all  relevant  material  and  device  attributes  and  process  parameters  have  been  evaluated  for 
their potential impact on each of the CQAs of the finished product and, where required, appropriate in-
process controls have been put in place. 
Changes  made  to  the  device  during  product  development  and  clinical  studies  are  well  described.  All 
device versions were compared with regard to the impact on the finished product CQAs and key user 
interface characteristics (inhalation resistance of the drug product, performance of the breath actuation 
mechanism). The equivalence of the main clinical version and the commercial version of the device has 
been adequately demonstrated.

Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  drug  product  involves  loxapine  solution  preparation,  heat  package 
cleaning, drug deposition, final assembly and primary packaging. The manufacturing process is a non-
standard  process.  Loxapine  solution  and  the  heat  package  are  considered  process  intermediates.  The 
holding  times  are  supported  by  stability  data.  Information  provided  on  manufacturing  process 
development shows that all parameters that may impact the critical quality attributes of the final drug 
product are controlled.  
Batch  data  on  6  primary  batches  (30%  -  50%  of  commercial  scale)  produced  at  the  commercial 
production facility under normal operating conditions was provided. The batch data of all development 
batches show that the quality of the pilot scale batches is predictive for the commercial scale batches. 
The commercial scale production process is adequately validated.  
Product specification 
The  product  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  primary  package  leakage  detection  (Ph  Eur), 
seal  strength,  identification  of  coated  drug  (IR  and  HPLC),  coated  dose  assay  (UPLC),  mean  emitted 
dose  and  emitted  dose  content  uniformity  (Ph  Eur),  aerosol  impurities  (DUSA),  aerosol  particle  size 
distribution  (fine  particle  mass)  (Ph  Eur),  residual solvents  (GC)  and  particulates  in  emitted  dose  (Ph 
Eur).  The  analytical  procedures  are  well  described  and  validated.  Batch  analytical  data  from  the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site were provided on three primary batches per strength and of 
several  supporting  batches  are  provided,  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  proposed  release 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on Adasuve was provided for three primary batches of each strength stored at 25°C/60% 
RH (18 months) and 40°C/75% RH (6 months) and for three registration batches per strength stored 
at 25°C/60% RH (24 months) and 40°C/75% RH (6 months).  
The  batches  were  stored  in  the  primary  packaging  for  commercial  supply.  The  drug  product  met  all 
acceptance  criteria  and  remained  well  within  the  proposed  limits.  No  clear  trends  were  observed  for 
any of the test attributes. The critical quality attributes (emitted dose, aerosol particle size distribution, 
and  aerosol  impurities)  have  remained  stable  and  consistent.  Light  stress  studies  demonstrated  that 
the  product  is  not  sensitive  to  light.  Forced  degradation  of  loxapine  base  required  unusually  strong 
stress  conditions  in  order  to  generate  degradation  products.  The  two  major  loxapine  degradation 
products were identified after acid stress and oxidation stress.  
Seal strength will be monitored during the ongoing stability studies. In case the updated stability data 
support  the  removal  of  this  test  from  the  stability  protocol,  this  will  be  done  by  the  variation 
procedure. This proposal is acceptable. 
The  proposed  shelf-life  as  described  in  the  SmPC  is  considered  acceptable.  No  special  temperature 
storage conditions are required. The product should be stored in the original pouch until ready for use.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Adasuve  is  adequately  established.    Satisfactory  chemical  and  pharmaceutical 
documentation  has  been  submitted  for  marketing  authorisation.  The  drug  substance  was  adequately 
characterized and the specification is acceptable in view of the route of synthesis and the various ICH 
guidelines.  Concerning  the  finished  product,  the  development  studies  adequately  support  the 
specification and acceptance criteria proposed. The drug product is stable with respect to degradation. 
Issues  concerning  the  device  reliability  and  performance  have  been  addressed  satisfactorily.  The 
results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

N/A  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Pivotal toxicology studies were performed according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), as stated by 
the applicant. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Loxapine  is  a  known  active  substance  and  literature  data  have  been  submitted  to  support  the  non 
clinical dossier in addition to a number of studies specifically conducted by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
A limited pharmacology programme has been conducted by the applicant including in vitro and in vivo 
tests i.e. in vitro study to characterise the receptor binding of one of its primary metabolite (loxapine 
N-oxide)  and  in  vitro/in  vivo  safety  pharmacology  in  addition  to  the  literature  data  submitted  to 
support this part of the dossier.  
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Based  on  literature  data,  the  binding  profile  of  loxapine  has  revealed  affinity  to  a  range  of 
neurotransmitter receptors (Ki, nM): D1 (18), D2 (9.8), 5-HT2A (2),  α1 (250),  M1 (117). In a separate 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 15/91 
 
 
 
 
study using guinea pig cerebral cortex receptors, loxapine also exhibited a Ki value of 14.9 nM for the 
histamine H 1 receptor. 
Loxapine  has  shown  to  prevent  the  stimulation  of  adenylate  cyclase  by  dopamine  in  rat  striatal 
homogenates by 60% of inhibition. IC 50 values for rat striatal [3H]-spiroperidol binding were 101, 196 
and 5870 nM for loxapine, amoxapine and imipramine, respectively.  
Loxapine,  amoxapine  and  their  8-hydroxylated  metabolites  displayed  moderate  strength  in  inhibiting 
striatal [3H]-spiperone binding. Loxapine exhibited the strongest inhibition for [3H]-spiperone whereas 
amoxapine and its 8-hydroxylated metabolite were stronger inhibitors of [3H]-imipramine binding and 
of serotonin uptake. These data suggested properties of both tricyclic antidepressant and antipsychotic 
agent for the studied compounds. 
In rats, pED50 values for loxapine were respectively 7.0, 6.8 and 6.7 for the occupancy of the 5-HT2 
receptors  (cortex)  and  D 2  receptors  (striatum  and  olfactory  tubercle).  In  vitro  data  suggested  more 
potency  for  loxapine  at  these  receptors.  In  male  NMRI  mice,  the  ED50  value  for  loxapine  was  0.3 
mg/kg for inhibition of [3H] SCH 23390, D 1 receptor antagonist.  
In  rats,  a  significant  decrease  in  5-HT2  receptor  binding  (cortex)  was  observed  due  to  a  decrease  in 
receptor density, but no change in K D following single or repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration 
of up to 28 days treatment with loxapine 5 mg/kg. After a single dose, loxapine also reduced dopamine 
receptor  density  (38%  reduction)  and  greatly  reduced  serotonin  receptor  density  (47%  reduction). 
There  were  no  significant  effects  on  receptor  affinities  (K D).  After  multiple  doses,  loxapine  did  not 
produce any significant increase in dopamine receptor density but induced a very significant reduction 
in serotonin receptor density. 
In rats, Ki value for loxapine was 1.8 nM for serotonin 2 receptor (cortex) following i.p. administration 
at a dose of 10 mg/kg. As compared to the vehicle, a significant decrease in maximal binding capacity 
(Bmax: 9.67 vs. 21.97 pmol/g) and increased K D (0.773 vs. 0.500 nM) were observed. 
In  rats,  after  subcutaneously  (s.c.)  administration  at  doses  ranging  up  to  1  mg/kg,  there  was  50% 
occupancy  at  0.05  mg/kg  and  0.04  mg/kg  for  D 2  and  5-HT2    receptors,  respectively  with  a  ratio  5-
HT2/D 2 was close to 1. 
Loxapine also significantly increased FOS positive cells both in the nucleus accumbens and the dorso-
lateral striatum. 
After  repeated  administration, 
loxapine  (4mg/kg/day)  elicited 
increases  of  180% 
in  dopa 
decarboxylase  (DDC)  mRNA  levels  but  had  no  effect  on  tyrosine  hydroxylase  (TH)  mRNA  levels 
suggesting  that  DDC  may  be  more  important  than  TH  in  the  long  term  regulation  of  dopamine 
production.  Increases  of  450%,  150%  and  550%  in  D1,  D 2  and  D3  receptor  mRNA  levels,  were  also 
respectively observed after multiple doses of loxapine (2mg/kg/day).  
In  vivo  data  suggested  a  number  of  pharmacological  effects  for  loxapine  including  decreased 
spontaneous  locomotor  activity,  sedation,  depression  and  catalepsy.  Loxapine  also  inhibited 
conditioned  avoidance,  potentiated  narcosis  induced  by  thiopental  sodium  and  protected  against 
amphetamine  mortality.  Other  pharmacological  effects  included:  inhibition  of  apomorphine-induced 
stereotypic  behaviour  (gnawing,  emesis),  partial  antagonism  of  2,5-dimethoxy-4-methamphetamine  
discriminative stimulus, induction of dose dependent hypothermia and hypophagia, and at high doses, 
induction of clonic/tonic convulsions and aggressive behaviour.  
As  compared  to  its  primary  metabolites,  loxapine  had  approximately  one  fifth  the  potency  of  7-OH-
loxapine  and  8-OH-loxapine  was  essentially  inactive  suggesting  that  hydroxylation  of  loxapine  at 
position  7  increased  the  dopamine  receptor  blocking  potency  of  loxapine,  whereas  hydroxylation  at 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 16/91 
 
 
 
 
position 8 abolished this effect. In another study, IC 50 values for rat striatal [3H]-spiroperidol binding 
were 9, 140 and 1300 nM for 7-OH-loxapine, loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine, respectively. 
Literature  data  suggested  that  another  primary  metabolite  (amoxapine)  had  a  different  spectrum  of 
pharmacological  effects  than  loxapine  acting  as  an  inhibitor  of  reuptake  of  norepinephrine,  a  potent 
antagonist  at  5-HT2  sites,  and  a  weak  D 2  antagonist  (Coupet  et  al,  1979).  Amoxapine  is  also 
considered  as  relatively  potent  histamine  H1  and  α1  receptor  antagonist,  and  a  weak  muscarinic 
acetylcholine and α2 receptor antagonist. 
No information was obtained from the published literature on the pharmacological activity of loxapine 
N-oxide. An in vitro receptor binding study of loxapine N-oxide conducted by the applicant showed that 
this metabolite was inactive at relevant receptors that were studied: α1, D 1, D 2S H 1 M1, 5HT2A .  
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  studies  evaluating  secondary  pharmacodynamics  have  been  performed  with  loxapine.  Available 
supportive  data  are  derived  from  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  and  these  were  considered 
sufficient to characterise the pharmacodynamic profile of loxapine. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The  safety  pharmacology  programme  consisted  of  two  in  vitro  hERG  channel  assays  and  an  in  vivo 
cardiovascular and respiratory safety study in dogs. All other data are derived from the literature. 
CNS system 
In  mice,  hypothermia  was  observed  after  loxapine  administration  with  a  total  decrease  of 
approximately  5ºC,  which  was  comparable  to  hypothermia  induced  with  chlorpromazine  and 
haloperidol administration. Like other antipsychotics, loxapine potentiated pentobarbital-induced sleep 
and did not reverse most CNS effects of the vesicular monoamine transport inhibitor tetrabenazine. 
In  cats,  loxapine  has  shown  to  slow  EEG  waves  after  iv  doses  lower  than  5  mg/kg.  Catalepsy  and 
“rage-like” behaviour were noted after iv dose of 1-1.5 mg/kg, whereas after 2-5 mg/kg, facial spasms 
and twitches of the whole body with occasional convulsions after the highest dose were observed. 
Loxapine  has  not  shown  any  protective  effects  against  convulsions  induced  by  strychnine, 
pentylenetetrazole,  or  electroshock.  In  contrast  to  chlorpromazine,  loxapine  did  not  offer  protection 
against  audiogenic  seizures,  and  with  prolonged  treatment,  loxapine  increases  susceptibility  to 
audiogenic seizures. The pro-convulsive effects of loxapine were observed after administration of high 
doses in cats and audiogenic seizures were noted in repeated dose toxicity studies in rats.  
Cardiovascular system 
Based  on  literature  data,  loxapine  treatment  resulted  in  decreased  amplitude  of  heart  movements  by 
10%  after  0.1  mg,  by  24%  after  0.5  mg,  and  by  60%  after  2.5  mg  of  loxapine  per  heart  in  isolated 
rabbit  hearts.  Coronary  flow  was  affected  only  marginally  by  the  two  lower  loxapine  doses  but  was 
decreased  by  69%  after  administration  of  2.5  mg  of  loxapine  per  heart.  This  dose  of  loxapine, 
however, did not induce heart arrest.  
In  isolated  and  perfused  guinea  pig  atria,  loxapine  did  not  exert  any  significant  effects  at  a 
concentration  of  0.002  mg/ml.  At  a  concentration  of  0.01  mg/ml  there  was  a  heart  rate  decrease  of 
approximately 21%, with inconsistent effects on heart contractility. At a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml, 
loxapine  decreased  heart  rate  by  33%  and  contractile  tension  by  31%,  with complete  arrest  after  12 
minutes of exposure.  
Adasuve 
Assessment report

In  isolated  rabbit  auricular  vessels,  increases  in  perfusion  volume  were  observed  after  loxapine 
administration.  These  were  minor  after  1  and  10  μg  of  loxapine  per  auricular  vessel  (8%  and  15% 
respectively).  However,  a  51%  increase  in  perfusion  volume  was  achieved  following  exposure  to  100 
μg of loxapine per auricular vessel. 
In in vitro hERG channel assays conducted by the applicant, loxapine and 8-OH loxapine were found to 
dose  dependently  block  hERG  channel  current,  yielding  an  IC 50  value  of  1.8  μM  and  3.6  μM, 
respectively. 
In  anesthetized  cats,  loxapine  administration  produced  dose-dependent  decreases  in  carotid  blood 
pressure (systolic blood pressure decreased by 7% after 0.1 mg/kg, by 18% after 0.5 mg/kg, and by 
38%  after  2.5  mg/kg).  Carotid  blood  pressure  returned  to  baseline  4  minutes  following  0.1  mg/kg 
loxapine,  after  more  than  16  minutes  following  0.5  mg/kg  loxapine,  and  after  more  than  60  minutes 
following 2.5 mg/kg loxapine. Loxapine had little effect on femoral blood flow at the two lower loxapine 
doses,  but  produced  transient  and  marked  decreases  (approximately  76%)  in  blood  flow  after  2.5 
mg/kg,  followed  1  minute  later  by  marked  increases.  Loxapine  administration  did  not  have  any 
significant effects on heart rate, PR interval, or ECG patterns.  
In  anesthetized  cats,  a  transient  hypotensive  response,  with  an  immediate  return  to  control  blood 
pressure  values  was  also  observed  after  intravenous  loxapine  administration  (0.25  -  5  mg/kg).  In 
decerebrated  cats,  subjected  to  the  same  treatment,  initial  hypotensive  response  was  followed  by  a 
period  of  sustained  hypertension  which  was  partially  inhibited  by  the  non-selective  alpha  blocker 
phenoxybenzamine. 
In  cats,  loxapine  did  not  cause  disturbances  in  cardiac  rhythm  at  an  iv  dose  of  5mg/kg  and  did  not 
block or attenuate the vasopressor effects of amphetamine at an iv dose of 2mg/kg.  
In dogs, effects of loxapine usually trended towards decreased blood pressure, reduced arterial blood 
flow, increased cardiac contractility, and increased cardiac output at a dose ranging from 0.5-4mg/kg. 
Heart  rate  was  not  affected  by  loxapine  treatment  and  there  were  no  consistent  changes  in  ECG 
parameters. However, when the dose of loxapine was increased to 7.5 mg/kg (cumulative intravenous 
dose),  one  dog  developed  markedly  elevated  T-waves  and  expired  in  cardiac  arrest.  In  subsequent 
studies  in  conscious  dogs  with  loxapine  administered  orally  at  doses  up  to  10  mg/kg/d  for  6  months 
and 20 or 30 mg/kg/d for 3 months, however, it was noted that no clinical or histopathological signs of 
cardiotoxicity were seen. 
In  a  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  safety  study  specifically  conducted  by  the  applicant,  conscious 
(non-anesthetized)  telemetered  dogs  were  used  and  3  doses  of  loxapine  were  tested  (0.15,  0.5,  and 
1.5  mg/kg).  As  single-breath  rapid  inhalation  delivery  in  unrestrained  dogs  was  not  feasible,  a  rapid 
intravenous  bolus  (over  5  seconds)  was  used  to  mimic  inhalation  exposure  to  the  drug.  Following 
administration,  all  animals  survived  and  none  exhibited  significant  adverse  reactions.  No  changes  in 
heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure were observed following vehicle administration or following 
the lowest loxapine dose tested (0.15 mg/kg). Following the intermediate loxapine dose (0.5 mg/kg), 
mild increases in heart rate were recorded but no changes in mean arterial blood pressure were noted. 
After the highest loxapine dose (1.5 mg/kg), mean arterial blood pressure transiently decreased at 20 
seconds post dose by approximately 22%. This decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was followed 
by an immediate increase, which lasted until approximately 6 minutes post dose. This increase in blood 
pressure was accompanied by a decrease in heart rate, which lasted until 15 minutes following dosing. 
None  of  these  changes  in  cardiovascular  parameters  reached  statistical  significance  as  compared  to 
treatment  with  vehicle  after  any  loxapine  dose,  with  the  exception  of  a  significant  decrease  in  heart 
rate 6 minutes after administration of 1.5 mg/kg loxapine. No changes in ECG intervals attributable to 
loxapine  or  vehicle  administration  were  observed.  Loxapine  administration  did  not  lead  to  QT  or  QTc

prolongation. Peak plasma levels of loxapine in venous blood were recorded at the first two collection 
time points (either 30 or 120 seconds) and averaged 177 ng/mL (range 64-392 ng/mL) following the 
0.15  mg/kg  dose;  1,398  ng/mL  (range  253-2,830  ng/mL)  following  the  0.5  mg/kg  dose;  and  1,438 
ng/mL (range 841-2,650 ng/mL) following the 1.5 mg/kg dose of loxapine. 
Respiratory safety 
Based on literature data, antipsychotics did not induce any significant changes in respiration in humans 
at  rest  but  appeared  to  enhance  ventilatory  response  to  hypoxia.  This  effect  is  said  to  be  likely 
attributable to their action in the carotid body. Cases of respiratory depression following administration 
of  antipsychotics  (including  loxapine)  have  been  reported  and  involved  co-administration  of  other 
drugs known to cause respiratory impairment such as benzodiazepines. 
The  respiratory  effects  of  loxapine  were  evaluated  in  several  non  clinical  studies.  Intraperitoneal 
injections  of  loxapine  at  50  mg/kg  in  rats  did  not  induce  any  significant  respiratory  changes  in  blood 
pH  and  pCO 2.  In  anesthetized  cats,  loxapine  (0.5  mg/kg)  increased  respiratory  rate  but  decreased 
amplitude of respiratory movements. Higher dose of loxapine (2.5 mg/kg) induced transient (typically 
lasting  seconds)  respiratory  arrest  in  some  animals  followed  immediately  by  a  marked  increase  in 
respiratory rate to up to 400% of baseline, with a gradual return to normal over 10 minutes.  
In  the  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  safety  study  specifically  conducted  by  the  applicant,  previously 
discussed (see cardiovascular system), loxapine did not lead to any significant changes in respiratory 
rate,  with  the  exception  of  mild  increases  following  the  highest  loxapine  dose  of  1.5  mg/kg,  which 
reached statistical significance as compared to vehicle at 15 minutes post dose. The mean respiratory 
rate at this time point (33 breaths per minute) was, however, within the normal range for the species. 
Analysis of blood gases revealed transient decreases in pCO2 levels following the lowest loxapine dose 
(0.15  mg/kg)  and  transient  increases  in  pO 2  levels  following  the  0.15  and  0.5  mg/kg  doses  of 
loxapine, with no changes at the highest dose of loxapine (1.5 mg/kg).  
Gastrointestinal and renal safety 
Based  on  literature  data,  in  vitro  studies  suggested  that  loxapine  has  direct  effects  on  intestinal 
motility (likely due to its antagonistic action at 5-HT7 receptors) as its administration prevented 5-HT 
induced contractions of isolated rat jejunum.  
In rats, loxapine (1 - 20 mg/kg) did not increase the number of animals that developed stress-induced 
gastric  ulcers  suggesting  its  lack  of  ulcerogenic  effects.  Loxapine  was  also  shown  to  produce  mild 
diuretic effects when administered alone. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Based  on  literature  data,  interactions  of  loxapine  succinate  with  diuretic,  antihypertensive  and 
antiparkinson agents were studied in rats. Loxapine (1 to 8 mg/kg, route not specified) failed to reduce 
blood pressure in normotensive rats but enhanced the anti-hypertensive effect of guanidine. Loxapine 
in combination with hydralazine, guancidyne or methyldopa caused a slower heart rate than guanidine 
or  methyldopa  alone  and  a  decrease  in  pressor  response  to  epinephrine  greater  than  guanidine  or 
hydralazine alone; the effects disappeared in 24 h. Loxapine succinate alone produced a mild increase 
in  urinary  volume  in  rats  and  in  combination  with  furosemide  or  hydrochlorothiazide,  the  diuretic 
activity was additive.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  metabolism  and  pharmacokinetics  of  loxapine  and  its  metabolites  were  investigated  by  the 
applicant,  mainly  in  rats  and  dogs.  Organ  and  tissue  distribution  studies  used  also  cats.  Metabolism 
studies using liver microsomes included other species: mouse, guinea pig, rabbit and monkey.   
After  inhalation,  the  bioavailability  of  loxapine  was  around  20-30%  in  male  rats,  53%  in  female  rats 
and greater than 100% in dogs. After oral administration, loxapine was not detectable in dogs and the 
bioavailability  was  around  2-10%  in  rats  indicating  a  much  higher  bioavailability  using  the  inhalation 
route in animals. In humans, oral bioavailability was higher than in animals with approximately 33%. 
No bioavailability data after inhalation were available in humans, however, an inhalation dose 5 times 
lower than the oral dose resulted in comparable systemic exposure.  
After inhalation, maximum plasma concentrations for loxapine were reached very rapidly in the studied 
species  (around  1-1.5  minutes).  Cmax  and  AUC  increased  dose-proportional  and  loxapine  plasma 
exposure  was  linear  over  the  dose  range  of  2  to  17  mg/kg  in  rats  and  0.10  to  2.16  mg/kg  in  dogs. 
There were no signs of plasma accumulation of loxapine or its metabolites after repeated dosing. Half-
lives of loxapine and metabolites were around 1-11 hours for loxapine, 3-11 hours for 7-OH loxapine, 3 
hours  for  amoxapine  and  0.3-2  hours  for  loxapine N-oxide.  In  rats,  the  clearance  of  inhaled  loxapine 
was around 20-30 L/h/kg indicating rapid elimination.  
After  single  intravenous  dosing,  half-lives  of  loxapine  and  metabolites  were  around  2-  9  hours  for 
loxapine,  6  hours  for  amoxapine,  6-7  hours  for  7-OH-loxapine,  4-9  hours  for  8-OH-loxapine  and  7 
hours for loxapine-N-oxide. Loxapine plasma exposure was linear in the dose range of 2 to 8 mg/kg in 
rats and 0.15 to 0.5 mg/kg in dogs. In rats, the volume of distribution was estimated as around 23-26 
L/kg and total plasma clearance was approximately 6.2-6.5 L/h/kg. 
The  radioactive  drug  was  rapidly  and  widely  distributed  over  the  body.  Thirty  minutes  after  an 
intravenous  dose  of  5  mg/kg  of  loxapine  in  rats,  tissues  concentrations  were  found  to  be  higher  in 
brain and lungs than in the spleen, pancreas, liver, kidneys and other body organs. At 4 hours, these 
concentrations had fallen to 10-30% of the initial value dose indicating rapid clearance except for the 
liver and fat tissues. In studies analysing the brain distribution of loxapine in rats, dogs and cats, the 
cortex  contained  the  least  amount  of  loxapine,  whereas  the  subcortical  structures  maintained  high 
relative concentrations in all three species. Loxapine had relatively high binding to animal and human 
plasma proteins (>97%) and was equally distributed between red blood cells and whole blood plasma 
at concentration of 100 ng/mL , with a whole blood to plasma ratio greater than 1 (1.1). Loxapine was 
not found to be a substrate of the protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) but did moderately inhibit P-gp. 
Loxapine metabolism involved formation of 7-OH-loxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, amoxapine and loxapine N-
oxide  via  flavin-containing  monooxygenases  (FMOs)  and  several  cytochrom  (CYP)  isoforms.  7-OH-
loxapine  is  mainly  formed  by  CYP3A4  and  2D6,  8-OH-loxapine  mainly  by  CYP1A2,  and  amoxapine  by 
CYP3A4 and 2C19. Loxapine N-oxide is suggested to be mainly formed by FMOs. In rats and dogs, 7-
OH-loxapine was the major metabolite. 8-OH-loxapine was not present in rats. In dogs, another main 
metabolic pathway was the formation of loxapine-N-oxide, possibly due to the presence of FMOs in the 
lungs. In rats, the secondary metabolism of 7-OH-loxapine primarily to 7-OH-amoxapine, by CYPs and 
in  smaller  amounts  to  7-OH-loxapine  N-oxide,  by  FMOs  was  found  to  be  gender-specific  with  males 
forming  both  metabolites  faster  than  females.  In  contrast,  in  humans  the  main  metabolite  is  8-OH-
loxapine  whereas  7-OH-loxapine  is  formed  to  a  much  lesser  extent.  However,  the  metabolic  pathway 
forming loxapine-N-oxide cannot be excluded in humans since at present the responsible FMO has not 
been identified. The other pharmacological active metabolite, amoxapine, is found in small percentages 
in  all  studied  species  and  man.  Compared  with  the  oral  route,  loxapine  inhalation  led  to  lower 
metabolites levels in humans due to the absence of the first-pass effect.

Loxapine  related  material  was  mainly excreted  in  the  faeces  (61%)  after  intravenous  dosing  in  dogs. 
Loxapine and/or its metabolites were also found to be excreted in the milk of dogs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A  limited  toxicology  programme  has  been  conducted  by  the  applicant  including  single  dose  and 
repeated  toxicity  studies  using  the  inhalation/intravenous  routes  in  rats  and  dogs  in  addition  to  the 
literature data submitted to support this part of the dossier.  
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Acute  toxicity  studies  (single  dose  and/or  escalating  dose)  were  conducted  in  both  rats  and  dogs. 
Different  routes  of  administration  were  tested  (rats:  intravenous,  nose  inhalation;  dogs:  oral 
inhalation)  using  intravenous  loxapine  succinate  and  inhaled  loxapine  base.  Non-lethal  effects  were 
observed  up  to  the  maximum  tested  dose  (rats  24  and  dogs  2.5  mg/kg).  Clinical  signs  consisted 
mainly  of  lethargy,  unresponsiveness,  decreased  activity,  and  at  the  higher  dose  levels,  tremors, 
clenched  forelimb  (rats),  and  weakness,  and  were  considered  to  be  related  to  the  pharmacological 
effects of loxapine. The signs appeared to be less severe than those reported in the literature for acute 
toxicity studies using different routes of administration (oral, subcutaneous), however, this finding may 
be due to the lower non-lethal dose levels applied in the studies performed by the applicant. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted for 5 and 28 days in dogs, and 14 days in rats.  
In  male  and  female  rats,  mean  dose  levels  of  1.7,  6.4  and  13  mg/kg/day  caused  dose  related  CNS 
clinical  signs  consisting  of lethargy,  hunched  posture  and  tremors  after  nose  inhalation. Other  effects 
included mammary hyperplasia in both sexes, ovarian follicular cysts that were reversible at the end of 
the  recovery  period  and  mucification  of  vaginal  epithelium  in  females.  Mammary  hyperplasia  was 
reversible  at  the  end  of  the  recovery  period  for  males.  Treated  animals  in  the  mid  and  high  dose 
groups  showed  significant  gender-specific  decreases  in  mean  body  weight  and  weight  gain  patterns, 
but these were considered secondary to the lethargy effect. Histological changes related to inhalation 
exposure  included  squamous  metaplasia  of  the  larynx,  possibly  due  to  the  particle  impaction 
associated with the delivery route and this effect was also reversible. Based on the persistence of the 
clinical  signs  until  the  morning  following  dosing,  the  slow  recovery  of  body  weight  decreases  and  the 
partial  recovery  of  the  histological  findings  at  the  high  dose,  the  no-observed-adverse-effect  level 
(NOAEL) was considered to be 1.7 mg/kg/day. 
In  dogs,  loxapine  treatment  related  clinical  signs  included  decreased  activity,  lack  of  coordination, 
limited use of hind limbs, lying on the side and an increase in frequency of tremors and weakness as 
compared  to  controls  at  a  dose  of  2  mg/kg/day  administered  for  5  days.  These  signs,  slight  to 
moderate in degree, were noted immediately after completion of exposure, and diminished in incidence 
and severity by 9 hours post exposure. Except for weakness noted in some dogs, the clinical signs had 
resolved by 24 hours post exposure. Slight decreases in body weight and food consumption were noted 
in  dogs  given  loxapine  at  a  dose  of  2.0  mg/kg/day.  There  were  no  treatment  related  macroscopic  or 
microscopic  changes.  The  no-observed-adverse-effect  level  (NOAEL)  was  considered  to  be  0.16 
mg/kg/day.  In another study with mean achieved doses of 0.12, 0.95 and 1.8 mg/kg/day for 28 days, 
decreased  activity,  lack  of  coordination,  tremors,  lying  on  side  and  weakness  were  noted.  Incidence, 
severity  and  duration  of  these  clinical  signs  decreased  with  repeated  exposure.  The  NOAEL  was 
considered to be 1.8 mg/kg/day.

2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Loxapine and its metabolites (8-OH loxapine, amoxapine) were evaluated in vitro using gene mutation 
assay  in  bacteria  and  chromosome  aberration  tests  in  human  blood  lymphocytes.  All  of  these  tests 
were negative and did not suggest a genotoxic potential of these compounds. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed.  
2.3.4.5.  Reproduction toxicity 
No  specific  fertility  and  early  embryonic  developmental,  pre-and  postnatal  developmental  toxicity 
studies or juvenile animal studies were conducted with loxapine.  
Based on literature data, female rats did not mate due to persistent diestrus after oral treatment with 
loxapine.  
Embryo/fetal  and  perinatal  development  were  studied  in  several  species:  rats,  rabbits,  mice.  In  rats, 
embryo/foetal toxicity was observed: loss of conceptuses, reduced foetal weight, increased number of 
anomalies/variations  and  decreased  ossification.  This  was  associated  with  signs  of  maternal  toxicity: 
loss  of  maternal  weight  and/or  decreased  body  weight  gain.  Observed  malformations  appeared  to  be 
incidental, hydroureter and hydronephrosis occurred and were found to be not dose-related. A similar 
pattern  of  developmental  delay  associated  with  maternal  toxicity  was  observed  in  mice.  Rabbits 
appeared to be less susceptible as decreased maternal weight gain and implantation counts were only 
observed at the highest dose (60 mg/kg/day) per oral gavage whilst retarded ossification of sternebrae 
per i.m. administration, but no teratogenic effects were noted. Postnatal survival of offspring of rabbits 
treated  with loxapine  during  all  or  a  portion  of  organogenesis  also  was  reduced  during  the  first  week 
following birth.  
Prenatal  and  postnatal  development  was  investigated  in  rats  and  dogs.  In  rats,  parturition  difficulty 
(dystocia) occurred in 3 of 20 mated dams from the high dose group. Increased numbers of perinatal 
and neonatal deaths as well as decreased birth and weaning weights were noted. These effects, as well 
as reduced ossification and renal findings, consisting of distended renal pelvis with reduced or absent 
papillae,  suggested  again  a  developmental  delay.  This  was  also  associated  with  signs  of  maternal 
toxicity:  lacrimation,  perineal  staining  and  decreases  in  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption.  In 
dogs,  postnatal  survival  of  offspring  was  found  to  be  markedly  reduced  in  all  treated  groups  for  the 
first  week  following  parturition.  No  morphologic  effects  due  to  maternal  loxapine  treatment  were 
observed in the offsprings.   
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetic data were summarised in section 2.3.3. 
2.3.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Single and repeated dose toxicity studies addressed local tolerance (see above). 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies. 
The  toxicity profile  of  a  number  of  degradation  products  and  device  components  (metals,  leachables) 
were studied and did not show any relevant findings.  Impurities were adequately qualified and those 
with respiratory sensitising or irritating potential were considered below the clinical safety threshold.

No  other  toxicity  studies  were  performed  which  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  given  the 
repeated  toxicity  data  and  the  absence  of  non  clinical  model  to  evaluate  respiratory  sensitisation 
potential.

Conclusion 
< 0.01 threshold 
During  the  evaluation,  the  CHMP  questioned  the  Fpen  refinement  and  hence  the  calculated  PEC 
surfacewater  of  0.005  µg/L.  However,  using  prevalence  values  of  0.8%  (schizophrenia)  and  1.3% 
(Bipolar Disorder I) and 0.4% (Bipolar Disorder II), with 12, 6 and 6 episodes per year, respectively, 
and  a  treatment  duration  of  2  days  in  all  cases,  Fpen  values  are  0.000526,  0.000427  and  0.000132. 
The  summed  Fpen  is  0.00108.  With  DOSEai  =  9.1  mg/patient/day,  the  resulting  PEC surface  water  is  4.9 
ng/L, which is below the action limit. In addition, the CHMP considered that these values would slightly 
change if calculated for a duration period of 1 day in which 2 doses are administered, but would still be 
well below the action limit. Hence the CHMP concluded that loxapine PEC surfacewater value was below 
the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and was not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore 
loxapine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Literature  data  adequately  characterised  the  properties  and  principal  effects  of  loxapine  as  well  as 
potential harmful effects on vital organ systems. Receptor binding and functional studies demonstrated 
that  loxapine  has  the  highest  affinity  for  serotonin  (5-HT2A)  receptor,  followed  by  dopamine  (D2  and 
D 1)  receptors.  Loxapine  has  also  affinity  for  muscarinic  (M1)  and  adrenergic  (α1)  receptors.  7-OH-
loxapine, a major metabolite found in rats and dogs, but of lesser importance in humans, has a 5-fold 
higher affinity for the D2 receptor.  
Difference between in vitro studies and in vivo occupancies of 5-HT2/D 2 receptors could be influenced 
by active metabolites. Loxapine was considered to mainly contribute to the pharmacological activity in 
vitro whereas active metabolites, including amoxapine and hydroxylated metabolites, were suggested 
to influence the in vivo behavior. It was generally stated in the literature that 7-OH loxapine, a major 
metabolite  in  rats  and  dogs,  contributes  to  the  pharmacology  of  loxapine.  Considering  no  data  were 
available on the distribution of this metabolite to the brain, it is difficult to determine to which extent 
this metabolite or others play a role in vivo. 
Animal studies demonstrated a number of effects characteristic of antipsychotic drug profile, including 
decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, sedation, depression and catalepsy. Loxapine also exhibited 
analgesic  activity,  inhibited  conditioned  avoidance,  potentiated  narcosis  and  protected  against 
amphetamine  mortality.  Other  pharmacological  effects  included:  inhibition  of  apomorphine-induced 
stereotypic  behavior  (gnawing,  emesis),  partial  antagonism  of  2,5-dimethoxy-4-methamphetamine

discriminative stimulus, induction of dose dependent hypothermia and hypophagia, and at high doses, 
induction of clonic/tonic convulsions and aggressive behaviour.  
The  safety  pharmacology  identified  mainly  CNS  (e.g.  hypothermia,  potentiation  of  pentobarbital-
induced  sleep  and  slowing  of  EEG  waves)  and  cardiac  (e.g.  transient  hypotension,  decreased  arterial 
blood flow, increased cardiac contractility and increased cardiac output) as possible targets for loxapine 
regarding  potential  adverse  effects  in  mans.  No  significant  gastrointestinal  or  renal  effects  were 
observed.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  effect  on  EEG  rhythms  have  also  been  observed  with 
chlorpromazine.  Seizures  have  also  been  reported  in  humans  following  cases  of  overdose  with 
loxapine. 
Non  clinical  QT  findings  were  consistent  with  a  IC 50  value  (1.8  µM)  of  loxapine  in  the  hERG  channel 
assay  and  a  lack  of  QT  prolongation  in  dogs.  However  a  mild  prolongation  of  QTc  was  observed  in  a 
specific clinical study. This is further discussed in the clinical pharmacology (see 2.4.3). 
Animal  studies  did  not  indicate  a  direct  effect  of  loxapine  on  respiratory  function  under  normal 
conditions.  However,  it  has  been  shown  that  administration  of  another  antipsychotic  drug 
(prochlorperazine) increased ventilatory response (minute ventilation, tidal volume and breathing rate) 
under hypoxic conditions. It could be hypothesised that the underlying mechanism could play a role in 
the  serious  adverse  ventilatory  responses  observed  in  asthma  and  COPD  patients.  This  is  further 
discussed in the clinical pharmacology (see 2.4.3). 
Non clinical data suggested drug interactions of loxapine succinate with diuretic, antihypertensive and 
antiparkinson  agents.  There  is  no  available  clinical  data  to  suggest  relevance  of  such  interactions  in 
humans and no additional drug interactions were considered necessary by the CHMP. 
The  results  of  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  animals  showed:  rapid  inhaled  absorption  (due  to  the 
absence  of  the  first  pass  effect  experienced  with  the  oral  route),  extensive  tissue  distribution,  high 
protein  binding  and  rapid  elimination.  Loxapine  drug  related  material  was  mainly  excreted  in  faeces 
and  notably  in  milk.  While  the  patterns  of  metabolites  were  relatively  similar  in  the  studied  animal 
species, it substantially differs from the human pattern. On this basis, extrapolation from animal data 
to man was considered limited.  
The majority of the findings in the repeated dose toxicity studies were related to the pharmacological 
CNS  activity  of  loxapine  except  for  changes  to  reproductive  tissues  related  to  the  extended 
pharmacology of loxapine. Similar changes, e.g., gynecomastia, are known in humans, but only after 
long-term administration of medicines causing hyperprolactinaemia. 
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in a standard package of tests. 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  were  performed  and  this  can  be  considered  acceptable  in  view  of  the 
maximum duration of treatment of up to 2 doses in 24 hours. 
Data  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  are  limited.  Female  rats  did  not  mate  due  to 
persistent  diestrus  after  oral  treatment  with  loxapine.  Embryo/fetal  developmental  and  perinatal 
studies  indicated  developmental  delay  (reduced  weights,  delayed  ossification,  hydronephrosis, 
hydrourether,  and/or  distended  renal  pelvis  with  reduced  or  absent  papillae)  as  well  as  increased 
numbers  of  perinatal  and  neonatal  deaths  in  offspring  of  rats  treated  from  mid-pregnancy  after  oral 
dosing of loxapine, that were below the maximum recommended dose in humans. Based on these data 
and  in  the  absence  of  information  on  pregnancy  exposure  with  loxapine,  a  recommendation  to  use 
loxapine during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus, has been 
reflected into the SmPC. 
Adasuve 
Assessment report

Loxapine PEC surfacewater value was below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and was not a PBT substance 
as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore loxapine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non  clinical  aspects  of  loxapine  have  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the 
requirements to support this application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  phase  I  clinical  pharmacology  programme  has  been  conducted  using  single  or  multiple  doses  of 
Adasuve, in healthy volunteers  (including  smokers),  subjects   with  asthma  and  COPD  and  in  patients 
on  chronic,  stable,  antipsychotic  regimens.  In  addition  to  phase  I  studies,  pharmacokinetic 
characteristics derived from literature data on oral loxapine were also considered. 
Plasma  concentrations  of  loxapine  and  its  analysed  metabolites  was  determined  using  LC/MS/MS 
methods  in  the  PK  studies.  Pharmacokinetics  parameters  were  determined  using  non  compartmental 
models. 
2.4.2.1.  Absorption  
Loxapine  was  rapidly  absorbed  upon  oral  inhalation  with  a  median  time  of  maximum  plasma 
concentration  (Tmax)  values  of  2-3  minutes.  The  absolute  biovailability  of  inhaled  loxapine  was  not 
studied.  Loxapine  exposure  in  the  first  2  hours  after  administration  (AUC0-2h,  a  measure  of  early 
exposure that is relevant to the onset of therapeutic effect) was 25.6 ng*h/mL for the 5 mg dose and 
66.7 ng*h/mL for the 10 mg dose in healthy subjects.  
Based  on  literature  data,  similar  systemic  exposures  to  oral  loxapine  50  mg  and  inhaled  loxapine  10 
mg  were  observed  indicating  a  good  bioavailability  using  the  inhalation  route  while  the  Cmax  was 
about 4 to 5 –fold higher. In addition, the exposure to metabolites after an oral dose was higher than 
after inhalation, due to the high first pass effect. 
Bioequivalence  between  inhalation  powder  applied  for  and  the  formulation  used  during  phase  III 
studies  for  5  mg  and  10  mg  was  demonstrated  for  the  exposure  parameter  (AUC)  but  not  for  the 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax). Higher Cmax were observed in the formulation applied for.  
2.4.2.2.  Distribution 
No  specific  study  has  been  performed  to  estimate  the  volume  of  distribution  after  inhalation  in  man 
and  this  was  not  considered  necessary,  considering  loxapine  inhalation  powder  is  intended  for  short 
term use. Loxapine was found to be highly bound to human plasma proteins (96.6%). In these assays, 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 25/91 
 
 
 
 
the  drug  recovery  was  low,  the  applicant  suggested  that  a  binding  to  lipoproteins,  as  observed  with 
clozapine and haloperidol cannot be excluded with loxapine and could explain this finding.  
2.4.2.3.  Elimination 
No  specific  study  has  been  performed  with  loxapine  inhalation  powder  and  this  was  considered  not 
necessary, considering loxapine inhalation powder is intended for short term use. Taking into account 
the  elimination  profile  of  oral  loxapine,  excretion  is  suggested  to  occur  mainly  in  the  first  24  hours. 
Metabolites  are  excreted  in  the  urine  in  the  form  of  conjugates  and  in  the  faeces  unconjugated.  The 
mean elimination half-life between loxapine inhalation and oral loxapine were found to be comparable 
and up to 8 hours.   
2.4.2.4.  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A  dose  proportional  increase  in  exposure  for  loxapine  was  observed  over  the  0.625  –  30  mg  dose 
range. For the maximum plasma concentration, this increase was less than dose proportional. No data 
were available on time dependency and this was considered acceptable given that loxapine inhalation 
powder is intended for short term use. 
After repeat administration of inhaled loxapine every 4 hours for a total of 3 doses (either 5 mg or 10 
mg)  in  subjects  on  chronic,  stable,  antipsychotic  regimens,  mean  peak  plasma  concentrations  were 
similar  after  the  first  and  third  dose,  indicating  minimal  accumulation  during  the  4-hour  dosing 
interval.  
2.4.2.5.  Special populations 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  were  provided  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  race,  gender,  weight, 
smoking and age. No specific phase I studies evaluating renal and hepatic functions, elderly population 
were  conducted  and  these  were  considered  not  necessary,  given  that  loxapine  inhalation  powder  is 
intended for short term use. 
A  specific  phase  I  study  evaluating  the  effect  of  smoking  did  not  reveal  relevant  differences  in  the 
pharmacokinetic  profile  of  smokers  versus  non  smokers  and  no  dosage  adjustment  is  recommended 
based on the smoking status. 
No  data  are  available  in  the  paediatric  population  as  the  studies  included  in  the  PIP  have  been 
deferred.  
Given  the  known  increased  risk  of  death  in  elderly  patients  with  dementia-related  psychosis  using 
antipsychotics, the elderly population was not studied and no data are available. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  significant  effects  of  race,  gender,  weight, 
smoking  and  age.  However  it  is  noted  that  in  female  smokers  exposure  (AUC inf)  to  loxapine  and  its 
active  metabolite  7-OH  loxapine  is  lower  than  in  female  non-smokers  (84%  vs  109%  7-OH- 
loxapine/Loxapine Ratio), which is probably due to an increase in loxapine clearance in smokers. 
2.4.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In  vitro  studies  with  human  hepatocytes  showed  that  loxapine  and/or  its  metabolites  did  not 
significantly inhibit CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. The formation of the 
metabolites was inhibited by inhibitors of CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8 and 2C19 inhibitors for 8 OH loxapine ; 
2C8 and 2C19 inhibitors for 7-OH loxapine; CYPs 2C8, 2C9 and 3A4/5 for amoxapine. 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 26/91 
 
 
 
 
Loxapine  was  not  found  to  be  a  substrate  for  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  ,  however  it  has  shown  to  act  in 
vitro as an inhibitor of P-gp, with an IC50 of 9.1 µM (about 3 µg/ml). Considering the maximal plasma 
concentrations observed in vivo of about 120 – 140 ng/ml after multiple dosing, the possible impact on 
P-gp-mediated transport of other drugs is not considered of clinical significance. 
No other additional interaction studies have been performed. 
Given  the  metabolism  pathways  of  loxapinem  further  investigation  on  the  potential  for  drug 
interactions with drug product and metabolites (loxapine and 8-OH loxapine) that induce the  levels of 
CYPs  1A2,  3A4  and  2D6  or  inhibit  the  levels  of  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases  (  including  UGT1A1, 
UGT1A3) was recommended by the CHMP. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
2.4.3.1.  Mechanism of action 
Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine compound. As for other antipsychotic agents, the efficacy of loxapine in 
the  claimed  indication  is  proposed  to  be  mediated  through  high  affinity  antagonism  of  dopamine  D2 
receptors  and  serotonin  5-HT2A  receptors.  Loxapine  binds  with  noradrenergic,  histaminergic,  and 
cholinergic  receptors,  and  its  interaction  with  these  systems  may  influence  the  spectrum  of  its 
pharmacological  effects.  Changes  in  the  level  of  excitability  of  subcortical  inhibitory  areas  have  been 
observed  in  several  animal  species,  associated  with  calming  effects  and  suppression  of  aggressive 
behaviour. 
2.4.3.2.  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Five  clinical  studies  were  conducted  (4  in  healthy  subjects,  1  in  patients  on  chronic,  stable, 
antipsychotic  regimens)  to  investigate  the  sedative  effects  of  loxapine  as  measured  by  the  Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for sedation. Two studies (1 in healthy subjects, 1 in asthma and COPD 
patients)  evaluated  the  effects  on  respiratory  function  and  used  2  inhaled  doses  of  loxapine 
administered  8-10  hours  apart.  A  QT/QTc  study  was  also  conducted  by  the  applicant.  Some  of  these 
studies  were  previously  discussed  in  relation  to  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  loxapine.  Available 
literature  data  on  receptors  binding  studies  in  man  using  Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  were 
also submitted. 
Sedative effects 
Sedation  was  considerably  more  pronounced  in  the  healthy  subjects  than  in  the  subjects  on  chronic, 
stable  antipsychotic  regimens.  There  was  a  rapid  onset  of  a measurable  sedative  effect  as  early  as  2 
minutes, reaching a peak effect at 30 minutes to 1 hour, and declining to halfway at approximately 2 
hours post dose. The peak effect was found to be greater after the second dose. 
Respiratory effects 
A  decreased  FEV1  suggestive  of  expiratory  difficulty  was  observed  more  significantly  in  the  loxapine 
group as compared to the placebo group in both asthma and COPD patients. In asthma patients, FEV1 
decrease of at least 10, 15, or 20% were respectively 84.6%, 61.5% and 42.3% for the loxapine group 
and 11.5%, 3.8% and 3.8% for the placebo group. In COPD patients, FEV1 decrease of at least 10, 15, 
or  20%  were  respectively  80.0%,  56.0%  and  40.0%  for  the  loxapine  group  and  66.7%,  33.3%  and 
11.1% for the placebo group.  
In healthy subjects, sedation was observed accompanied by an increased FEV1/FVC ratio in spirometry 
measurement  after  each  of  2  doses  of  loxapine  with  an  8-hour  interval.  This  finding  indicated  a 
decreasing  end-of-expiration  effort.  A  15%  or  larger  decrease  in  FEV1,  occurred    after  loxapine 
Adasuve

treatment  in  19.2%  as  compared  to  3.8%  of  all  subjects  after  placebo  treatment,  suggesting 
expiratory difficulty.  One subject had a decrease of 20% or more after loxapine treatment. In 5 of the 
7  subjects  experienced  a  10%  or  more  decrease,  as  measured  soon  after  loxapine  administration. 
There were no vital signs or SpO2 changes or indications of bronchospasm to explain these differences.  
Cardiac effects 
In  a  QT/QTc  study,  there  was  no  significant  effect  of  a  single  dose  of  loxapine  10  mg  on  cardiac 
repolarization  as  compared  to  placebo.  The  upper  bound  of  the  95%  1-sided  CI  for  the  largest  time-
matched  mean  effect  of  loxapine  on  the  difference  from  placebo  in  the  change  from  baseline  in  the 
QTcI interval excluded 10 milliseconds. The QTc interval prolongation as compared to placebo showed 
a  maximum  of  5.418  msec,  as  compared  to  8.356  msec  prolongation  for  the  active  comparator 
(moxifloxacin 400 mg).  
PET findings 
Based on literature data, the dose of loxapine to occupy 50% of D 2 receptors was 9.6 mg/day for D2 
receptors and 13.6 mg/day for  5-HT2 receptors in man. Loxapine was also found to be equipotent at 
the 5-HT2 and D 2 receptors. At the dose range tested (10-100 mg/day), D 2 receptor occupancy ranged 
from  43  to  90%  whereas  5-HT2  occupancy  varied  from  27%  to  near  saturation  suggesting  different 
profile in vivo as compared to in vitro data. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Limited  characterisation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  oral  inhalation  route  for  loxapine  has  been 
performed  with  the  absorption  phase  specifically  studied.  Based  on  literature  data,  similar  systemic 
exposure  for  oral  loxapine  50  mg  and  inhaled  loxapine  10  mg  were  observed  indicating  a  good 
bioavailability using the inhalation route. 
Bioequivalence  between  inhalation  powder  applied  for  and  the  formulation  used  during  phase  III 
studies  for  5  mg  and  10  mg  was  demonstrated  for  the  exposure  parameter  (AUC)  but  not  for  the 
maximum  plasma  concentration  (Cmax).  Higher  Cmax  were  observed  in  the  formulation  applied  for. 
The  CHMP  however  agreed  that  this  finding  was  not  clinically  impacting  on  the  safety  profile  of  the 
product based on the available clinical data using this formulation. 
Subjects  with  hepatic/renal  impairment  and  the  elderly  population  were  not  studied  and  no  data  are 
available. A specific phase I study evaluating the effect of smoking did not reveal relevant differences 
in  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  smokers  versus  non  smokers  and  no  dosage  adjustment  is 
recommended based on the smoking status. 
No  data  are  also  available  in  the  paediatric  population  as  the  studies  included  in  the  PIP  have  been 
deferred.  
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  significant  effects  of  race,  gender,  weight, 
smoking  and  age.  However  it  is  noted  that  in  female  smokers  exposure  (AUC inf)  to  loxapine  and  its 
active  metabolite  7-OH  loxapine  is  lower  than  in  female  non-smokers  (84%  vs  109%  7-OH- 
loxapine/Loxapine ratio), which is probably due to an increase in loxapine clearance in smokers. 
The  presented  clinical  pharmacokinetic  data  were  considered  sufficient,  given  that loxapine  inhalation 
powder is intended for a short term use. 
The  PK/PD  profile  in  the  following  populations  was  studied:  healthy  subjects,  patients  on  chronic, 
stable, antipsychotic regimens, patients with asthma and COPD patients.  
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 28/91 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic  data  confirmed  the  fast  onset  of  sedative  effect  achieved  with  loxapine  inhalation. 
However  this  effect  appeared  much  weaker  in  patients  on  stable,  chronic  antipsychotic  regimens  as 
compared  to  healthy  subjects.  In  addition,  expiratory  difficulty  was  observed  after  loxapine 
administration  in  patients  with  asthma  and  COPD  patients.  This  is  further  discussed  in  the  clinical 
safety (see 2.6). 
A  combined  sedative  and  respiratory  effect  was  also  observed  and  this  may  predispose  to  over-
sedation  in  case  of  co-administration  with  other  ventilation  depressants  such  as  hypnosedatives 
including  benzodiazepines.  The  CHMP  therefore  recommended  to  include  a  number  of  warnings  in 
patients  at  risk  ie  patients  with  hypovigilance,  with  CNS-depression  due  to  alcohol  or  other  centrally 
acting  medicinal  products  (anxiolytics,  antipsychotics,  hypnotics,  opiates),  with  agitation  due  to 
intoxication or physical disease (delirium). The CHMP also recommended to conduct a phase I study to 
assess the safety and PD profile of concomitant administration of single doses of inhaled loxapine and 
lorazepam  (i.m.)  compared  to  the  administration  of  each  agent  alone.  This  study  is  part  of  the  risk 
management plan (see 2.7.2). 
A  QT/QTc  study  did  not  reveal  significant  effect  of  a  single  dose  of  loxapine  10  mg  on  cardiac 
repolarization  as  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  effect  on  QT  was  not  evaluated  after  repeated 
administration. Whilst similar systemic exposures to oral loxapine 50 mg and inhaled loxapine 10 mg 
were observed, the recommended daily dose for oral loxapine was found to be much more higher than 
50  mg  with  200  mg/day  (up  to  600  mg/day  in  certain  cases)  which  can  be  given  once  a  day  in  the 
evening or in fractionated doses during the day. The posology of oral loxapine hence suggested a much 
higher exposure to loxapine and its active metabolites (due to the high first pass effect)  as compared 
to the proposed posology for inhaled loxapine, hence the CHMP considered that on this basis and the 
safety profile of oral loxapine, the risk for QTc prologation appeared  to be limited and manageable in 
clinical  practice.  Following  the  SAG-Psychiatry  conclusions  (see  2.5.7),  the  CHMP  recommended  to 
include a warning on QT interval as follows: 
“Clinically relevant QT prolongation does not appear to be associated with a single dose of ADASUVE. 
Caution  should  be  exercised  when  ADASUVE  is  administered  in  patients  with  known  cardiovascular 
disease  or  family  history  of  QT  prolongation,  and  in  concomitant  use  with  other  medicinal  products 
known  to  prolong  the  QT  interval.  The  potential  risk  of  QTc  prolongation  following  repeat  dosing  or 
interaction with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval is unknown. “ 
In  addition,  the  CHMP  recommended  to  conduct  a  post-approval  study  investigating  a  2  doses  of  10 
mg of ADASUVE given 2 hours apart, including a positive control with known QT/QTc prolongation (oral 
moxifloxacin, 400 mg), an oral placebo and inhaled placebo, as proposed by the applicant. This study 
is part of the risk management plan (see 2.7.2). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  pharmacological  profile  of  loxapine  in  human  studies  has  been  adequately  characterised 
for its intended use.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The initial indication applied for was: rapid control of agitation in adult patients with schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorder. 
The  clinical  development  consisted  of  3  clinical  studies  (004-201,  004-301  and  004-302)  that  were 
multicenter, randomised, double blind, parallel group and placebo controlled. All study centres were in 
the  US.  These  studies  were  performed  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  (004-201,004-301),  bipolar  I 
Adasuve

disorder  (study  004-302)  and  schizoaffective  disorder  (004-201)  and  evaluated  the  5  mg  and  10  mg 
dose of loxapine with a maximum of 1 (004-201) to 3 doses administered (004-301, 004-302) during 
a 24-hour study period. Studies 004-301 and 004-302 are identified as the pivotal phase III studies. 
An indirect comparison of the efficacy results of loxapine versus i.m. aripiprazole and i.m. olanzapine 
was  also  presented  taking  into  account  the  CHMP  reflection  paper  on  the  need  for  active  controls 
(draft, EMA/759784/2010). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study  004-201  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  dose  response  and  included  2  periods  (pre/post 
treatment) as shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1 
In this study, the population included adults, 18 to 65 years of age, who had met the DSM-IV criteria 
for  schizophrenia,  schizophreniform  disorder,  or  schizoaffective  disorder.  Loxapine  was  administered 
via inhalation  using  the  Staccato  delivery  system.  Treatment  was  administered  using  3  devices,  each 
containing 0 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of Loxapine.  
Patient disposition and demographics are presented in figure 2 and Table 2.

The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the absolute change in Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale  (PANSS)  Excited  Component  (PEC)  score  from  baseline  at  2  hours  following  Staccato  Loxapine 
administration. Change from baseline in PEC score over time are presented in Figure 3. 
Figure 3 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
The 2 main studies (004-301  and  004-302) were designed as a double-blind, randomised, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the efficacy and safety over 24 hours of loxapine 5 mg and 
10 mg inhalation powder administered orally once daily versus placebo. Study 004-301 was conducted 
in patients with schizophrenia and study 004-302 included patients with Bipolar I disorder (see Figure 
4).

Several types of patients could be enrolled: 1) those admitted to a hospital setting or a research unit 
for  the  purpose  of  the  study,  2)  those  already  hospitalized  for  treatment  of  schizophrenia  who  had 
acute  agitation,  3)  those  treated  at  a  psychiatric  emergency  room  setting  that  allowed  extended 
patient stays in a secluded observation room for the period of the study. Only patients willing and able 
to  stay  in  the  hospital  or  clinic  throughout  the  post-treatment  evaluation  period  and  for  at  least  12 
hours after the last dose of study medication were enrolled.

2.5.2.1.  Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Male and female patients between the ages of 18 to 65 years inclusive; with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria 
for  schizophrenia  in  study  004-301;  who  met  DSM-IV  criteria  for  bipolar  I  disorder,  manic  or  mixed 
episodes (as confirmed by administration of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and with 
or without psychotic features in study 004-302; judged to be clinically agitated at baseline (with a total 
score  of  ≥14  on  the  5  items  “poor  impulse  control,  tension,  hostility,  uncooperativeness,  and 
excitement” comprising the PEC scale), with a value of ≥4 (out of 7) on at least 1 of the 5 items on the 
PEC  scale,  who  read  and  understand  English  and  provided  written  informed  consent,  in  good  general 
health  prior  to  study  participation  as  determined  by  a  detailed  medical  history,  physical examination, 
and  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG);  using  appropriate  contraceptive  methods  during  the  study  and 
for 1 week following the end of the study. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients  who  met  any  of  the  following  criteria  were  excluded:  agitation  caused  primarily  by  acute 
intoxication  upon  investigator  opinion  ;  positive  urine  drug  screen  for  psychostimulants  (eg,  cocaine, 
phencyclidine  [PCP])  ;  history  within  the  past  2  months  of  drug  or  alcohol dependence  as  defined  by 
DSM-IV; judged to be at serious risk for suicide; treatment with benzodiazepines or other hypnotics or 
oral  or  short-acting  i.m.  antipsychotics  within  4  hours  prior  to  study  drug;  treatment  with  injectable 
depot  neuroleptics  within  1  dose  interval  prior  to  study  drug  administration;  history  of  allergy  or 
intolerance  to  loxapine  or  amoxapine  were  to  be  excluded;    female  patients  who  had  a  positive 
pregnancy  test  at  screening  or  were  breast-feeding;laboratory  or  ECG  abnormalities  considered 
significant by the investigator that would have clinical implications for the patient's participation in the 
study  ;  significant  hepatic,  renal,  gastroenterologic,  respiratory,  cardiovascular  (including  ischemic 
heart  disease  and  congestive  heart  failure),  endocrinologic,  neurologic,  or  hematologic  disease; 
clinically  significant  acute  or  chronic  pulmonary  disease  (eg,  clinically  apparent  asthma,  chronic 
bronchitis, emphysema); treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening were 
to be excluded; unsuitable candidate for receiving Staccato Loxapine, or likely to be unable to use the 
inhalation device, as judged by the investigator. 
In  study  004-301,  additional  exclusion  criteria  were:  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder, delirium, dementia, or any psychiatric diagnosis other than bipolar I disorder 
that  required  pharmacotherapy;  who  had  taken  fluoxetine  (Prozac)  during  the  30  days  prior  to 
randomization,  or  other  antidepressants  during  the  7  days  prior  to  randomization;  who  have  taken 
anticonvulsants with the exception of stable doses of valproate in the 7 days prior to randomization. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized to treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio. As part of the screening process, patients were 
evaluated  for  their  ability  to  properly  perform  the  inhalation  maneuver  required  to  use  Staccato 
Loxapine/Staccato  Placebo.  Post-treatment  period  started  with  the  administration  of  Dose  1  (Time  0) 
and  continued  for  24  hours.  If  required,  a  maximum  of  3  doses  of  study  medication  were  allowed 
during  that  24-hour  period.  If  agitation  did  not  subside  sufficiently  after  the  first  dose  of  study 
medication or if it recurred, a second dose could be given >2 hours after Dose 1 (after completion of 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 34/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the 2-hour efficacy assessments). If necessary, a third dose could be given ≥4 hours after the second 
dose. Unless medically required, rescue medication (i.m. lorazepam) was not to be used until after the 
2-hour  efficacy  assessments  had  been  completed,  the  second  dose  of  study  medication  had  been 
given, and at least 20 minutes had elapsed after administration of study medication. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy measure was the absolute change in PEC score from baseline to 2 hours following 
the first dose (Dose 1).  
Main secondary efficacy measure was the value of the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement Scale 
(CGI-I) score 2 hours after Dose 1. Other secondary efficacy measures included changes from baseline 
in PEC scores at 10, 20, 30, and 45 minute after first dose for 10 mg dose only.  
Tertiary Endpoints included: CGI-I responders 2 hours after Dose 1 [defined as patients with a score of 
1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the CGI-I scale; CGI-I non-responders were defined 
as patients with scores from 3 (minimally improved) through 7 (very much worse); a value of 0 (not 
assessed) was considered missing]; changes from baseline in PEC score at 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 4 
hours,  and  24  hours  after  Dose  1  for  10  mg  dose  only;  total  number  of  patients  per  group  who 
received 1, 2, or 3 doses of study medication with and without rescue medication by 4 hours and 24 
hours  after  Dose  1;  time  to  rescue  medication  during  the  entire  24-hour  post-treatment  evaluation 
period; time to the second dose 2 (Dose 2) during the 24-hour post-treatment evaluation period (prn); 
Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) score 2 hours after Dose 1. 
Sample size 
The planned enrolment of approximately 300 patients (100 per group) would provide 99 % statistical 
power for the 10 mg dose Placebo pairwise comparison and 79 % statistical power for the 5 mg dose 
pairwise comparison for the primary efficacy analysis based on study 004-201 results. 
Randomisation 
Patients were assigned a unique number corresponding to the patient number on the study drug label. 
A  computer-generated  randomization  schedule  was  used  to  package  and  label  the  study  medication 
with sequential patient number.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study  medication  was  packaged  into  labelled  kits  containing  3  single  dose  devices  with  an  identical, 
blinded label. The label on the kit was detachable, to be removed and affixed in the drug accountability 
log  at  randomization.  All  labels  included  protocol  number  and  patient  number.  In  case  of  emergency 
treatment information could be accessed from the blinded label in the drug accountability log.  
Statistical methods ANCOVA/ANOVA 
The  primary  analysis  was  evaluated  in  the  intent-to-treat  population  with  last  observation  carried 
forward  (ITT  with  LOCF).  It  included  all  patients  who  received  any  study  medication  and  had  both 
baseline  and  at  least  one  post-dose  efficacy  assessment  or  used  rescue  medication  before  2  hours 
after dosing. Missing values were replaced using the LOCF algorithm. Any observations recorded after 
the  use  of  rescue  medication  were  considered  missing  and  subject  to  the  LOCF  algorithm.  The  LOCF

approach  was  not  required  for  survival  analyses, in  which  the  standard  right-censoring  approach  was 
applied. The safety population included all patients who received any study medication. 
The  primary  and  secondary  outcome  measures  were  analysed  using  ANCOVA  model, with  a  global  F-
test and Dunnett’s t-tests for the follow-up active/placebo pairwise comparisons (adjusted for multiple 
comparisons).  A  main-effects  ANCOVA  model  including  terms  for  baseline  PEC  score,  treatment,  and 
center (ie, pseudocenter) was used to assess the overall treatment effect. Treatment and pseudocenter 
effects were considered statistically significant if p≤0.05. A family-wise α-level of 0.05 was maintained 
for  the  primary  and  secondary  analyses  using  a  global  “gatekeeper”  tests  with  follow-up  (adjusted) 
pairwise  testing,  and  a  closed-method  hierarchical  testing  strategy.  Sensitivity  analyses  on  primary 
and secondary outcome measures were also performed to test the robustness of the adjusted p-values 
derived  from  the  multiplicity  testing  procedure.  Tertiary  efficacy  outcome  measures  were  analysed 
using a 2-sided test at a nominal α=0.05 level.

Recruitment 
Study period was from 22 February 2008 to 27 June 2008 for study 004-301 and from 24 July 2008 to 
2 November 2008 for study 004-302. 
Conduct of the study 
In both studies, the original protocol was not amended and important protocol deviations were related 
to  enrolment  criteria,  the  study  and  rescue  medication  regimens,  the  use  of  prohibited  concomitant 
medications,  a  failure  to  manage  a  patient  according  to  withdrawal  criteria,  and  any  other  deviation 
judged  by  the  medical  monitor  to  warrant  inclusion  in  the  clinical  study  report.  In  study  004-301, 
important protocol deviations were identified for 11 patients (3.2%) in study 004-301 and 28 patients 
(8.9%)  in  study  004-302.  These  were  not  considered  to  significantly  influence  the  results  of  both 
studies. 
Baseline data 
In study 004-301, mean age was 43.1 years, and the majority were male (73.5%). Most were either 
Black  (57.6%)  or  Caucasian  (33.7%),  with  a  slightly  higher  percentage  of  Caucasians  in  the  5  mg 
group  (41.4%)  compared  with  the  10  mg  and  placebo  groups  (31.9  and  27.8%  ,  respectively).  Most 
patients had a history of smoking (current smokers, 81.7%; ex-smokers, 7.8%).

In study 004-302, males (49.7%) and females (50.3%) had their mean age value as 40.8 years. Most 
patients  were  either  Black  (44.3%)  or  Caucasian  (43.9%)  and  had  a  history  of  smoking  (current 
smokers, 74.5%; ex-smokers, 8.0%). 
All  patients  had  bipolar  I  disorder  (manic  in  68.8%  of  patients,  and  mixed  in  the  remaining  31.2%). 
Across treatment groups, the mean time since diagnosis of bipolar disorder ranged from 11.7 to 12.8 
years. At screening the mean duration of the current episode of agitation ranged from 9.7 to 16.0 days 
(medians ranged from 5.0 to 6.2 days). 
Other baseline data are presented in Tables 3-6 and Figures 7-8.

In  both  studies,  no  patient  was  reported  to  have  failed  screening  because  of  an  inability  or 
unwillingness  to  use  the  Staccato  system,  the  most  commonly  reason  patients  failed  screening  was 
because  they  did  not  meet  the  enrolment  criteria.  Number  of  patients  that  were  screened  but  not 
enrolled was 30 and 42, for studies 004-301 and 004-302, respectively.

2.5.3.  Ancillary analyses 
Changes  in  PEC-score  remained  significantly  greater  in  loxapine-treated  patients  as  compared  to 
placebo  at  4  and  24  hours  post  administration.  Analyses  of  comparisons  between  loxapine  versus 
placebo-treated groups (PEC-score change from baseline) in subgroups defined by age, sex, and race 
revealed no substantial divergence from overall results. Also, treatment results did not separate from 
placebo  differently  in  comparisons  between  schizophrenia  versus  schizoaffective  disorder  and 
schizophreniform disorder in study 004-301, and in comparison between manic episodes versus mixed 
episodes  of  bipolar  disorder  in  study  004-302.  In  both  the  placebo-treated  and  the  loxapine  treated

patient-groups  there  was  a  tendency  towards  a  slightly  greater  decrease  of  PEC  scores  in  subgroups 
defined  by  a  higher  PEC-scores  at  baseline  in  studies  004-301  and  004-302,  in  a  similar  order  of 
magnitude. 
At  the  CHMP  request,  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  were  performed  evaluating  the  efficacy  in  patients 
that  stopped  excluded  medications  (e.g  antipsychotics)  and  those  who  were  not  taking  excluded 
medications.  Among  the  excluded  medications,  the  most  common  CNS  active  medications  were: 
quetiapine  (13.9%),  zolpidem  (6.4%),  risperidone  (5.8%),  olanzapine  (4.3%),  aripiprazole  (2.5%), 
clonazepam (2.2%). Results are presented in Tables 23-25.

Following  the  CHMP  findings  that  in  study  004-301,  a  higher  number  of  patients  were  on  active 
treatment  (including  rescue  medication)  in  the  loxapine  5  mg  and  10  mg  groups  (33-39%  on  2  or  3 
doses,  4.5-5.3%  on  rescue  medication)  as  compared  to  the  placebo  (15.6%  on  rescue  medication) 
while  similar  decline  of  the  control  of  agitation  over  time  was  observed  across  groups,  the  applicant 
provided results of the PEC score changes over 24 hours in both pivotal studies. These are presented in 
Figure 11.

No pooled analyses or meta-analysis were performed. 
2.5.5.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special patient-groups were performed regarding efficacy in reduction of acute agitation. 
The applicant did submit an efficacy study in migraine patients. In study 104-201 Staccato loxapine 5 
mg  was  compared  with  placebo  in  migraine  patients  (loxapine  5  mg:  n=43;  placebo:  n=39), 
demonstrating  superiority  of  loxapine  in  percentage  of  2-hour  pain  relief  responders  (76.7%  versus 
51.3%, p=0.0212). 
2.5.6.  Supportive studies 
2.5.6.1.  Introduction 
Due  to  the  lack  of  active  comparator  in  the  presented  clinical  programme,  the  applicant  provided  an 
indirect comparison of the efficacy results of loxapine versus i.m. aripiprazole and i.m. olanzapine. The 
objective of this analysis was to put the observed effects into clinical context via historical comparisons 
of data from the confirmatory trials to the trials of an appropriate reference treatment. 
In addition, the applicant provided a comparative analysis regarding medications used in the treatment 
of schizophrenia in EU and US to support the extrapolation of the results from pivotal studies that were 
only performed in the US. 
2.5.6.2.  Comparative efficacy with intramuscular aripiprazole and olanzapine 
Methodology 
On the basis of similar methodology used, data sources from the following studies were analysed (see 
Tables 26-28.

Results 
Baseline data 
Many of the key demographic characteristics, including age, gender, and race were comparable across 
the  3  programs.  However,  in  the  trials  of  patients  with  schizophrenia,  the  majority  of  patients  were 
males; and this preponderance was less pronounced in the studies with bipolar disorder patients. There 
were more black patients in the Staccato loxapine trials than in the i.m. Abilify or i.m. Zyprexa studies, 
especially in patients with schizophrenia.  
Baseline agitation scores are presented in Table 30. 
Table 30 
Change from Baseline in PEC score  
In  the  pivotal  studies  conducted  for  Staccato  loxapine,  as  well  as  those  for  i.m.  Abilify  and  i.m. 
Zyprexa, the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in PEC score at 2 hours after the 
first administration of study medication. Table 31 presents the primary efficacy endpoint data from the 
pivotal  studies.  The  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  2  hours  in  PEC  scores  were  similar  for  Staccato 
loxapine  compared  with  the  other  two  drugs.  This  confirms  the  relative  effectiveness  of  Staccato 
loxapine  at  both  dose  levels,  based  on  comparison  to  the  historical  data  for  i.m.  Abilify  and  i.m.

Zyprexa  from  studies  with  designs  and  endpoints  similar  to  those  in  the  pivotal  trials  of  Staccato 
loxapine.  
Table 31 
Onset of Effect on PEC score  
The  approved  i.m.  drugs  were  shown  in  their  pivotal  trials  to  have  variable  onset  of  anti-agitation 
effect.  Table  32  presents  the  time  points  of  the  first  statistically  significant  changes  from  baseline  in 
PEC scores relative to placebo in the Staccato loxapine, i.m. Abilify, and i.m. Zyprexa Phase 3 studies. 
For  i.m.  Abilify  and  i.m.  Zyprexa,  there  was  variability  in  the  onset  of  effect  based  on  both  the 
treatment  population  and  the  dose  of  the  drug.  By  contrast,  Staccato  loxapine  showed  a  rapid  and 
consistent  onset  of  anti-agitation  effect  at  10  minutes  in  both  populations  and  at  both  doses  (5-mg 
onset  data  analysis  was  post  hoc).  This  difference  in  time  to  producing  a  significant  reduction  in 
agitation may be more evident in patients with bipolar disorder in whom Staccato loxapine had effects 
in 10 minutes, compared with 30 minutes and 60 minutes for the prescribed doses of i.m. Zyprexa and 
i.m. Abilify, respectively.

Responder Analysis on PEC score  
In the pivotal studies for i.m. Abilify and i.m. Zyprexa, responder analyses assessed the percentage of 
patients with a ≥40% decrease from baseline in the total PEC score at selected time points. The same 
responder  analyses  were  performed  for  the  pivotal  Staccato  loxapine  studies  at  all  assessment  times 
from  10  minutes  through  2  hours  after  administration  of  Dose  1  (post-hoc  analyses).  The  results  of 
these Staccato loxapine responder analyses, along with available data for i.m. Abilify and i.m. Zyprexa, 
are summarized in Table 33 (schizophrenia) and Table 34 (bipolar disorder) and Figure 12.

2.5.6.3.  Comparative on medications used in the treatment of schizophrenia in EU and the 
US 
The analysis showed that no major differences exist in the treatment of antipsychotic patients between 
US and EU and that the medications most commonly used both in US as well as in EU are those that 
were  received  in  the  highest  percentage  by  the  study  patients  (namely  diazapines,  oxazepines,  and 
thiazepines).  
2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program consisted of one dose ranging study (004-201) and 2 pivotal phase 
III  studies,  respectively  performed  in  population  with  schizophrenia  (004-301)  and  Bipolar  I  disorder 
(004-302). An indirect comparison versus historical data was performed in the absence of confirmatory 
trials including an active comparator. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In study 004-201, the design was limited to only two doses tested (5 mg and 10mg) questioning if the 
minimum effective dose was achieved. No pair-wise comparison was performed between loxapine 5 mg 
and 10 mg.  
In both pivotal studies (004-301,004-302), the 24 hour duration was considered in principle adequate 
to assess efficacy given the intended short term treatment in acute agitation. However, no data were 
available on repeated use over several days in case the agitation showed a fluctuating pattern.  
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 65/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  CHMP  also  considered  that  the  inclusion  criteria  reflected  the  target  population.  In  addition,  the 
informed  consent  procedure  appeared  to  include  the  possibility  of  consent  by  legal  representative  or 
impartial  witness,  thus  allowing  for  enrolment  of  severely  agitated  patients  who  are  unable  to  give  a 
personal informed consent.  
The  CHMP  was  however  concerned  about  the  exclusion  criteria  that  may  have  limited  the 
generalisability of the results. In clinical practice, most of the determinants that excluded patients from 
the  pivotal  studies  characterised  a  considerable  proportion  of  patients  in  need  of  treatment  of  acute 
agitation e.g agitation due to drug intoxication or agitation due to physical disease (delirium), patients 
with  suicidal  thought,  and  patients  who  use  injectable  depot  neuroleptics  or  psychostimulants.    The 
instruction of patients on the use of the device also suggested that moderately agitated patients only 
could  be  enrolled,  this  being  further  supported  by  selecting  “uncooperativeness”  as  one  of  the  five 
symptoms used in the definition of the agitation for the studied population.  
Although  the  study  criteria  were  similar  to  the  studies  performed  for  other  approved  drugs  in  this 
indication  and  used  as  intramuscular  injection,  the  extrapolation  of  the  results  from  clinical  trials  to 
actual clinical setting was questionable for Adasuve since the product is used as an oral inhaler and a 
certain  level  of  cooperativeness  from  the  patient  is  required  under  such  administration.  In  addition, 
patients  were  evaluated  for  their  ability  to  perform  the  inhalation  manoeuvre  required  to  use  the 
Staccato device in the clinical studies raising again doubts on the generalisability of the study results, 
considering  the  use  of  educational  measures  may  not  be  feasible  in  the  intended  clinical  setting.  In 
addition, an enrolment of moderately agitated patients could impact on the representativeness of the 
studied  population  as  patients  truly  in  need  of  fast  onset  of  effect  in  the  treatment  of  agitation,  will 
generally be suffering from severe, and not moderate agitation.  
Patients over 65 years of age were excluded from both pivotal studies and therefore data in the elderly 
population are lacking. In addition, the vast majority of the patients were not naïve to antipsychotics 
and  a  large  proportion  of  patients  were  receiving  concomitant  medication  including  benzodiapezines 
and other sedatives (see Tables 4 and 6).  
PEC  and  CGI-I  scales  are  used  in  clinical  practice  and  their  validity  have  been  confirmed  in  the 
assessment  of  agitation:  the  PEC  score  is  a  summation  of  individual  scores  (from  1-7)  across  five 
items:  poor  impulse  control,  tension,  hostility,  uncooperativeness,  and  excitement.  The  range  of 
possible  PEC  scores  is  5  through  35;  CGI-I  is  a  7  point  scale  that  rates:1.  very  much  improved;  2. 
much  improved;  3.  minimally  improved;4.  no  change;  5.  Minimally  worse;6.  much  worse;  or  7.very 
much worse.  
The  PEC  scale  shows  highly  sensitivity,  and  does  not  present  ceiling  or  floor  effect;  CGI  is  known  to 
assess  the  severity  of  agitation  and  post-treatment  changes  in  clinical  condition.  Nevertheless,  the 
clinical  relevance  of  the  primary  outcome  measure  with  respect  to  the  chosen  interval,  the  absolute 
change from baseline to 2 hours after the first dose on the PEC score and claimed use as faster onset 
of  efficacy  as  compared  to  other  available  oral  treatment  (e.g.  haloperidol,  lorazepam  tablets)  was 
questioned. Furthermore the applicant had chosen to statistically analyse the PEC score results at early 
time  points  only  for  the  10  mg  group,  on  the  basis  of  study  004-201  results  showing  a  statistical 
clinical effect after 2 hours for the 10 mg dose, but not for the 5 mg dose. Considering the design of 
study 004-201 and possible high variability that may be observed in dose-response trials, the exclusion 
of the 5 mg group for the secondary analysis was questioned by the CHMP, especially given that both 
the primary and the key secondary endpoint were reached for the 5 mg dose in the pivotal studies (see 
below). 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 66/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the post-hoc analysis, the responders were defined as patients having PEC-scale decrease of ≥40%. 
The  CHMP  noted  this  definition  was  used  to  support  the  approval  of  products  in  this  indication  and 
could therefore be accepted for the analysis. 
In  study  004-201,  6  out  of  149  patients  refused  to  participate.  In  studies  004-301  and  004-302  no 
patient  refused  to  use  the  Staccato  system  suggesting  apparent  cooperativeness  from  the  patients 
enrolled and questioning the severity of agitation, as the target population is generally known for low 
treatment  compliance  inherent  to  the  nature  of  disorders,  which  is  mostly  enhanced  during  agitated 
episodes.  
Baseline PEC-scores were below 18 in both pivotal studies, which confirmed that the studied population 
had moderate agitation (Tables 3 and 5, Figures 7 and 8). This is also reflected by the protracted mean 
duration  of  agitation  that  could  last  more  than  1  week  time  (see  Tables  3  and  5).  This  observation 
could be seen as atypical for acute agitation and could reflect unstable disease. The CHMP noted that 
the  studied  population  contrasted  with  available  published  study  conducted  by  Currier  et  al  (2001). 
This study included patients with an average baseline PEC-score of 27.5 and used both oral treatment 
and  injections.  From  the  CHMP  view  point,  it  is  unclear  whether  results  in  patients  with  moderate 
agitation can be extrapolated to severe agitation, which may be more treatment resistant.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses. 
In  study  004-201,  10  mg  dose  of  Adasuve  demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvements 
compared with placebo for the primary endpoint (PEC score at 2 hrs: -8.56, p=0.0002). The 5 mg dose 
of Adasuve also produced positive results but these did not reach statistical significance (PEC score at 
2 hrs: -6.71, p=0.088). The CHMP noted that the dose finding results were not reproduced in the two 
pivotal  studies  where  the  efficacy  of  5  mg  loxapine  did  not  significantly  differ  from  10  mg  in  the 
primary  analysis  (see  below).  Although  only  2  doses  were  tested  and  no  pair-wise  comparison  was 
performed  between  loxapine  5  mg  and  10  mg,  post-hoc  PEC  scale  responder  analysis  at  early  time 
points showed a trend towards a large percentage of responders for the 10 mg dose as compared to 
the 5 mg dose (Tables 33 and 34), and results on the overall use of additional study medication and/or 
rescue medication by 4 and 24 hours after Dose 1 favoured the 10 mg dose (see Tables 17-18 and 21-
22).  The  CHMP  therefore  considered  acceptable  to  recommend  an  initial  dose  of  10  mg,  also  taking 
into account that subgroup analyses revealed that 5 mg was not effective in male patients ( PEC score 
at 2 hrs: 1.4, p= 0.0996; CGI-I score at 2 hrs: -0.3, p=0.1284). 
In both pivotal studies, treatment groups were generally well matched for demographic characteristics. 
The  mean  age  of  randomized  patients  was  43.1  years  in  study  004-301  and  40.8  years  in  study 
004-302:  young  adults  (18-25  years  old)  were  scarcely  (7.3%)  represented  in  either  trial.  Women in 
the  schizophrenia  trial  were  scarcely  represented  (26.5%),  and  about  half  of  the  patients  were  male 
(49.7%) in study 004-302. Most patients were either black or Caucasian: 57.6% vs 33.7% and 44.3% 
vs 43.9%, in studies 004-301 and 004-302, respectively. About 35% of the patients with schizophrenia 
were taking concomitant antipsychotics at the time of dosing while approximately 13% of the patients 
with bipolar disorder were taking these drugs reflecting that a considerable proportion of patients were 
not naive to antipsychotics. A majority of the patients in both Phase 3 studies were smokers with about 
82%  of  the  patients  with  schizophrenia  and  74%  of  the  patients  with  bipolar  disorder  currently 
smoking. 
In  study  004-301,  efficacy  of  Adasuve  was  demonstrated  over  placebo,  on  the  primary  endpoint  and 
secondary endpoints defined as PEC score at 2 hours and at 10 minutes timepoint, respectively for the 
tested  doses.  For  5  mg  dose,  PEC  scores  were:  -8.0  at  2hrs  (p=0.0004)  and  -3.1  at  10  minutes 
(p=n/a).  For  10  mg  dose,  PEC  scores  were:  -8.7  at  2hrs  (p=<0.0001)  and  -3.4  at  10  minutes 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 67/91 
 
 
 
 
 
(p<0.0001). Adasuve 5 mg dose appeared as efficacious as the 10 mg dose in decreasing PEC score. 
Results in the PEC score are confirmed by the effects observed on the key secondary endpoints, CGI-I 
score  at  2  hours  (for  5  mg:  2.3,  p=0.0015  and  for  10  mg:  2.1,  p<0.0001),  and  in  the  additional 
secondary  endpoints,  with  no  major  difference  observed  between  5mg  and  10  mg  doses  (see  Tables 
13, 15-18).  
Similar  efficacy  results  were  observed  in  study  004-302,  conducted  in  acutely  agitated  bipolar  type  I 
patients. Efficacy of Adasuve was demonstrated over placebo at 2 hours and after 10 minutes for the 
tested  doses.  For  5  mg  dose,  PEC  scores  were:  -8.2  at  2hrs  (p=<0.0001)  and  -3.6  at  10  minutes 
(p=n/a).  For  10  mg  dose,  PEC  scores  were:  -9.2  at  2hrs  (p=<0.0001)  and  -4  at  10  minutes 
(p<0.0001).  No  major  difference  was  observed  between  5mg  and  10  mg  doses  in  decreasing  PEC 
score, as well as on the other main efficacy endpoints (see Tables 14, 19-22). 
In both studies, a significant proportion of the patients (approximately 25 to 45%) were administered 
a second dose after the 2 hours to reach an adequate control of the agitation. 
In  both  pivotal  studies,  from  30  minutes  post  dose  onwards  the  10  mg  dose  resulted  in  a  40%  or 
higher  decrease  of  agitation  rating  levels  in  about  60%  of  patients,  as  compared  to  26%  of  patients 
who were given placebo. However, the CHMP noted that there was a 1.6-2.0 point decrease in the PEC 
score over time, from 4h to 24h across all groups (see Figure 11). According to the applicant, this may 
have reflected some early re-emergence of symptoms across all groups, the investigators were not yet 
being  allowed  to  start  or  resume  a  maintenance  regimen.  In  fact,  during  this  time,  the  placebo 
subjects  received  more  dose  2,  dose  3  and  rescue  medication  combined  compared  to  the  active 
treatments  (see  Tables  18  and  22).  In  addition,  additional  analyses  performed  at  the  CHMP  request 
indicated that the efficacy of Adasuve 10 mg on acute agitation in bipolar I disorder was not significant 
among  patients  that  were  using  stable  antipsychotic  medication  on  the  primary  and  key  secondary 
endpoints for 10 mg dose (PEC at 2 hours: 1.9, p=0.3559; CGI-I at 2 hours: -0.4, p=0.3637). From 
the  CHMP  viewpoint,  a  possible  saturation  of  dopamine-receptors  could  not  be  excluded  in  those 
patients. 
The  indirect  comparison  between  Adasuve  and  i.m.  aripiprazole  and  i.m.  olanzapine  showed  similar 
order  of  magnitude  of  efficacy  in  the  intended  population  (see  Figure  12).  However,  the  CHMP  could 
not  conclude  on  added  clinical  benefit  versus  existing  available  therapy  due  to  the  lack  of  active 
comparator. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  presented  efficacy  data  did  not  support  a  broad  indication  for 
“for  the  rapid  agitation  in  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  or  bipolar  disorder”  as  claimed  by  the 
applicant.  In  addition,  the  pharmacological  profile  of  Adasuve  raised  efficacy  and  safety  concerns  in 
patients  on  stable,  chronic  antipsychotics  regimens  and  in  patients  with  asthma  and  COPD  patients 
(see 2.4.4). The CHMP consequently agreed to convene the Psychiatry Scientific Advisory Group (SAG- 
Psychiatry)  to  ask  the  view  of  the  experts  in  the  field  on  whether  in  clinical  practice  there  will  be  a 
patient population in which the product can be safely used.  
Prior  the  SAG  Psychiatry  meeting,  the  applicant  revised  the  indication  as  follows:  “ADASUVE  is 
indicated  for  the  rapid  control  of  mild-to-moderate  agitation  in  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  or 
bipolar disorder.” 
The SAG Psychiatry was held on 6 November 2012 and the main conclusions were as follows: 
- 
The  group  considered  that  there  was  a  need  for  alternative  options  in  the  rapid  control  of 
agitation  in  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  or  bipolar  disorder.  In  this  respect,  ADASUVE 
may represent a non invasive alternative to the more coercive intramuscular injections. 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 68/91 
 
 
 
 
-  ADASUVE  administration  required  some  level  of  cooperation  from  the  patient  who  has  to 
accept  to  breathe  into  the  device.  Severely  agitated  patients  were  not  investigated  and 
patients who are not cooperative would not be eligible for this treatment. 
-  Based  on  the  provided  data,  the  group  was  of  the  opinion  that  there  may  be  a  place  for 
Adasuve in the management of mild to moderately agitated patients. Severity is meant to be a 
clinical judgement.  
While  there  may  be  a  patient  population  in  which  the  product  can  be  used  in  clinical  practice,  the  
group  noted  that  the  use  of  ADASUVE  raises  some  safety  concerns  that  make  the  assessment  of  the 
benefit/risk of the product difficult due to : 
- 
The risk of severe bronchospasm requiring a treatment in half of the patients presenting with 
asthma/COPD.  Although  this  risk  is  considered  manageable  in  a  clinical  setting,  appropriate 
contraindications are needed for patients at higher risk. Whereas this risk seems to be confined 
to  patients  with  certain  pulmonary  conditions  (irritation  e.g  asthma)  ,  emphasis is  put  on  the 
fact  that  psychiatric  patients  do  present  quite  often  with  medical  comorbidities,  quite  often 
poorly stabilised, and therefore may also be at risk. 
-  Safety concerns in case of co-administration with other antipsychotics, particularly with regard 
to the potential increased risk of QT prolongation.  
- 
The need to have a second dose at 2 hours interval to achieve a satisfactory level of sedation 
may increase the drug exposure. However, the group considered that administration of up to 2 
doses at 2 hours interval was reasonable.  
Taking into account the above and the CHMP question, the SAG Psychiatry agreed that there would be 
a patient population in which Adasuve can be used in clinical practice, provided that its use is limited to 
patients  with  mild  to  moderate  acute  agitation,  without  evidence  of  active  airways  disease  and  that 
only a maximum of 2 doses is administered to the patients. 
Following the SAG Psychiatry conclusions, the CHMP considered that the presented data could support 
the  indication,  as  revised  by  the  applicant.  The  CHMP  also  noted  that  the  contraindication  in  patients 
with active airways disease was already proposed by the applicant. However the CHMP recommended 
further  restrictions  including  the  use  in  hospital  setting  only  and  a  limitation  of  the  posology  to  “no 
more than 2 doses”. In addition, the following warnings were recommended by the CHMP: 
-  Correct  use  of  ADASUVE  inhaler  is  important  for  administration  of  the  full  dose  of  loxapine. 
Healthcare professionals should ensure the patient will use the inhaler properly. 
-  ADASUVE  may  have  limited  effectiveness  when  patients  are  on  concomitant  medicinal 
products, predominantly other antipsychotics.  
2.5.8.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  efficacy  in  the  rapid  control  of  mild-to-moderate  agitation  in  adult 
patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder was demonstrated for Adasuve in the proposed dosing 
regimen of “no more than 2 doses”. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  database  presented  in  this  dossier  included  the  following  datasets:  1)  agitated  patients  in 
controlled  studies  (studies  004-201,301  and  302)  or  pool  1;  2)  healthy  volunteers  (004-
101,103,104,106,107) or pool 2; 3) subjects on stable antipsychotic regimens (004-102); 4) subjects 
Adasuve

with asthma (004-108); 5) subjects with COPD (004-105);6) in patients with migraine/headache (104-
201);7) outpatient subject with migraine/headache  (104-202). 
In addition to these studies, literature data on safety experience with loxapine marketed as oral or 
parenteral formulations were summarised. 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
The overall safety population included a total of 1653 subjects: 578 receiving placebo; 348 receiving 
less than 5mg of loxapine and 347 and 452 receiving loxapine 5 mg and 10 mg respectively. A limited 
number of subjects were exposed to more than one dose (see Table 35). 
Table 35 
2.6.2.  Adverse events  
The AE profile of the agitated patients and healthy volunteers are presented in Tables 36 and 37.

Table 37 
In  addition,  in  the  thorough  QT-study  in  healthy  volunteers  the  most  common  treatment-related  AEs 
reported  were  somnolence  (Staccato  Loxapine,  61.7%;  placebo,  14.9%;  moxifloxacin,  4.3%), 
dizziness  (Staccato  Loxapine,  36.2%;  placebo,  4.3%;  moxifloxacin,  8.5%),  dysgeusia  (Staccato 
Loxapine,  19.1%;  placebo,  2.1%;  moxifloxacin,  4.3%),  and  cough  (Staccato  Loxapine,  14.9%; 
placebo, 2.1%; moxifloxacin, 0.0%).   
2.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Severe  sedation  was  experienced  by  2  patients  (0.8%)  in  the  10  mg  group.  Severe  AEs  that  were 
experienced by 1 patient each in the loxapine groups were somnolence, schizophrenia (exacerbation), 
dystonia,  oculogyration,  gastroenteritis,  hypertension,  and  hyperhidrosis.  Severe  AEs  experienced  in 
the  placebo  group  (1  patient  each)  were  headache,  nausea,  agitation,  schizophrenia  (exacerbation), 
overdose,  and  pelvic  inflammatory  disease.  There  were  no  deaths  in  the  studies  submitted  by  the 
applicant within the study periods or related to study treatments. 
2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Among loxapine-treated patients in the pivotal efficacy studies, one patient had blood creatine kinase 
increase,  and  one  patient  had  hepatic  enzyme  increase.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  mean 
changes in hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. 
2.6.5.  Safety in special populations 
Available  data  on  subjects  with  active  airways  and  on  stable  antipsychotic  regimen  are  derived  from 
the  phase  I  studies  (see  2.4.3.2)  since  these  patients  were  not  included  in  the  pivotal  studies 
according to their protocols.  
Subjects with active airways disease 
Adasuve

In  subjects  with  asthma  or  COPD,  bronchospasm  (which  included  reports  of  wheezing,  shortness  of 
breath or cough) was reported in patients following administration of 2 inhaled doses of loxapine with a 
8-10  hour  interval.  Bronchospasm  was  reported  in  14  of  26  subjects  (53.8%)  with  mild-to-moderate 
persistent  asthma,  and  in  5  of  26  subjects  (19.2%)  with  COPD.  These  events  occurred  within  25 
minutes of dosing in 12 of the 14 asthma subjects and in 4 of the 5 COPD subjects. The events were 
rated  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  Spontaneous  recovery  did  not  occur  in  13  asthma  and  2  COPD 
subjects so that treatment with an inhaled bronchodilatator was required. 
In asthma subjects, 18 (69.2%) loxapine-treated subjects and 3 (11.5%) placebo-treated subjects had 
notable  respiratory  signs  and/or  symptoms,  defined  as  an  FEV1  decrease  from  baseline of  ≥20%,  an 
airway AE, or use of rescue medication. In addition, according to the protocol, 10 subjects (9 loxapine, 
1  placebo)  did  not  receive  the  second  dose  2  because  of  an  AE  of  dyspnea,  wheezing,  or 
bronchospasm,  or  a  decrease  from  baseline  FEV1  of  ≥20%.  Two  loxapine-treated  subjects  did  not 
receive  the  second  dose  because  of  an  FEV1  decrease  of  ≥20%,  and  2  loxapine-treated  subjects  did 
not  receive  the  second  dose  because  of  AEs  (chest  discomfort  and  cough  in  one  patient  and  chest 
discomfort in the other patient). The remaining 5 loxapine-treated subjects did not receive the second 
dose  because  of  an  FEV1  decrease  of  ≥20%  and  AEs  (wheezing  (2);  bronchospasm  (2);  chest 
discomfort,  dyspnea,  FEV1  decreased,  wheezing,  throat  tightness  (1);  bronchospasm.  The  placebo-
treated  subject  had  an  AE  of  chest  discomfort.  Airway  AEs  were  reported  by  14  (53.8%)  loxapine-
treated  subjects  and  3  (11.5%)  placebo-treated  subjects.  Airway  AEs  that  occurred  in  more  than  a 
single  loxapine-treated  subject  were  bronchospasm  (7  subjects),  chest  discomfort  (6  subjects), 
wheezing  (4  subjects),  and  dyspnea  (3  subjects).  Airway  AEs  were  also  reported  for  3  (11.5%) 
placebo-treated subjects: chest discomfort in 2 subjects; bronchospasm in 1 subject. 
In COPD subjects, 15 (57.7%) loxapine-treated subjects and 6 (22.2%) placebo-treated subjects had 
notable  respiratory  signs  and/or  symptoms.  In  addition,  according  to  the  protocol,  8  subjects  (7 
loxapine,  1  placebo)  did  not  receive  the  second  dose  2  because  of  an  AE  of  dyspnea,  wheezing,  or 
bronchospasm,  or  a  decrease  from  baseline  FEV1  of  ≥20%.  Five  loxapine-treated  subjects  did  not 
receive  the  second  dose  because  of  an  FEV1  decrease  of  ≥20%,  and  2  loxapine-treated  subjects  did 
not  receive  the  second  dose  because  of  AEs  (wheezing  in  one  patient,  dyspnea  and  wheezing  in  the 
other  patient).  The  placebo-treated  subject  had  an  AE  of  bronchospasm  and  an  FEV1  decrease  of 
≥20%. Airway AEs were reported for 5 (19.2%) loxapine-treated subjects. Airway AEs that occurred in 
more  than  a  single  loxapine-treated  subject  were  dyspnea  (3  subjects),  cough  (3  subjects),  and 
wheezing  (2  subjects).  Airway  AEs  were  also  reported  for  3  (11.1%)  placebo-treated  subjects: 
dyspnea, bronchospasm and productive cough. 
Subjects on stable antipsychotic regimen 
Among 32 patients 18-65 years of age on chronic, stable antipsychotic regimens, 3 doses of loxapine 
with a 4-hour interval were administered over an 8-hour period. Mild to moderate AEs were reported  
in  loxapine-treated  group,  no  AEs  were  reported  in  the  placebo-treated  group.  The  percentage  of 
subjects with AE were 38%, 38% and 50% for the 15, 20 and 30 mg loxapine dose, respectively. The 
most frequently reported AE’s were cough (3), sedation (3) and dysgeusia (2).  
2.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
At  the  CHMP  request,  the  applicant  analysed  the  potential  risk  of  respiratory  depression  in  case  of 
administration  of  benzodiazepines  or  other  ventilation  depressants  after  loxapine  was  given.  The 
applicant  clarified  that  by  protocol,  patients  received  rescue  lorazepam  following  the  second  dose  of 
study  medication  and  were  not  eligible  to  receive  additional  loxapine  after  the  rescue  medication, 
hence  there  was  no  possible  concomitant  administration  of  lorazepam  shortly  before  loxapine  was 
Adasuve 
Assessment report  
Page 73/91 
 
 
 
 
given.  The  percentage  of  patients  in  the  pivotal  studies  receiving  rescue  lorazepam  following  the 
second dose was 17.2%.  According to the applicant, there was no difference in the AE profile between 
these patients and those  who did not receive lorazepam. However, one case of overdose in a patient 
treated with more than 1 CNS  active drug was reported in the literature. 
2.6.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pivotal efficacy studies, discontinuations due to AE’s were rare and occurred only in the group 
treated with Staccato loxapine 10 mg (1.2%, 3/259). 
2.6.8.  Post marketing experience 
Loxapine has been marketed for a number of decades in both Europe and the US as oral tablets and 
solution for intramuscular injection. A review of 164 clinical studies from published literature on safety 
experience  with  these  existing  formulations  was  submitted  by  the  applicant.  In  most  publications, 
dose-dependent sedation effects were  noted in 10 to 50% of all treated  patients. In comparison with 
other  conventional  anti-psychotics,  loxapine  may  have  a  stronger  hypno-sedative  effect.  Other 
frequently  occurring  adverse  effects  were  tachycardia  and  palpitations  in  up  to  82%  of  all  patients, 
returning to normal after several days, dose-dependent extra-pyramidal symptoms (~39% of treated 
patients)  including  akathisia,  dystonia,  rigidity  and  tremor  (‘hypokinetic-rigidity  syndrome’),  dose-
dependent hypotension (13% of patients at a dose of 200 mg) and parasympaticolytic /anti-cholinergic 
side  effects  such  as  dry  mouth,  nasal  congestion,  constipation,  blurred  vision,  urinary  retention  and 
paralytic ileus. 
Rare  but  severe  adverse  effects  described  in  loxapine  users  were  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  (1 
fatal case has been reported) and rhabdomyolysis was also reported in one patient after intramuscular 
‘rapid  neuroleptization’.  Also  tardive  dyskinesia  may  develop  after  chronic  use.  Hypertension  and 
bradycardia were reported, as well as seizures, predominantly with overdose.  
ECG  changes  were  reported  in  a  few  studies  but  in  some  prospective  studies  only  sinus  tachycardia 
was shown. The hERG channel blockade responsible for QT-interval prolongation was reported to occur 
only at relatively high concentrations. The halfway hERG channel blocking (IC50) of loxapine is at 1800 
nM. (IC 50 droperidol /risperidone /haloperidol = 167-174 nM; IC 50 ziprasidone = 3 nM) indicating low 
pro-arrhythmic potential.  
Respiratory effects of loxapine have not been well studied, but cases of hypoventilation were reported 
when  co-administered  with  benzodiazepines.  Other  side-effects  were  liver  enzyme  elevations, 
hyperglycemia  and  rare  hematologic  abnormalities  such  as  agranulocytosis  /leucopenia  and 
neutropenia.  Predominantly  after  chronic  administration,  hyperprolactinaemia  may  cause  impotence, 
galactorrhea, gynaecomastia and amenorrhea. 
In  one  report,  3  personality  disordered  patients  were  described  to  abuse  loxapine  for  its  soporic  and 
dulling effect (‘flush’). 
Based  on  the  applicant’s  review,  15  deaths  were  identified  possibly  related  to  loxapine  therapy, 
amongst  which  were  two  cases  of  myocardial  infarction  /heart  disease,  one  neuroleptic  malignant 
syndrome,  and  one  opioid-induced  neuro-toxicity.  Other  causes  of  death  were  suicide,  overdose  or 
injury.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine, exhibiting antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors, 5-HT2A antagonistic 
activity  and  anti-cholinergic,  anti-histaminergic  and  anti-alpha-adrenergic  properties.  The  known  side 
effect profiles of loxapine tablets and loxapine intramuscular injection are similar to other conventional 
anti-psychotics  with  a  relatively  modest  influence  on  cardiac  repolarisation  and  a  similar  extra-
pyramidal  effects  profile.  However  tachycardia  appeared  to  be  common,  possibly  related  to 
hypotension  due  to  alpha-1  adrenergic  blocking  potential  of  loxapine.  Also,  neuroleptic  malignant 
syndrome including rhabdomyolysis may occur as a rare but potentially life-threatening complication.  
The safety profile of Adasuve appeared to be similar to the other anti-psychotic agents, however, high 
risk  of  bronchospasm  in  lung  disease  patients  has  been  identified.  This  risk  is  most  likely  due  to 
specific  tolerability  problem  in  susceptible  individuals,  given  the  novel  route  of  administration  of  this 
product, used as an inhaler. The CHMP noted that this patient population were excluded in the pivotal 
studies and were only investigated in phase I studies. 
In  subjects  with  asthma  or  COPD,  bronchospasm  (which  included  reports  of  wheezing,  shortness  of 
breath or cough) was reported in patients following administration of 2 inhaled doses of loxapine with a 
8-10  hour  interval.  Bronchospasm  was  reported  in  14  of  26  subjects  (53.8%)  with  mild-to-moderate 
persistent  asthma,  and  in  5  of  26  subjects  (19.2%)  with  COPD.  These  events  occurred  within  25 
minutes of dosing in 12 of the 14 asthma subjects and in 4 of the 5 COPD subjects. The events were 
rated  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  Spontaneous  recovery  did  not  occur  in  13  asthma  and  2  COPD 
subjects  so  that  treatment  with  an  inhaled  bronchodilatator  was  required.  After  the  SAG  Psychiatry 
(see  2.5.7)  and  PRAC  consultations  (see  2.7.2),  the  following  risk  minimisation  measures  were 
considered  sufficient  to  address  this  risk:  1)  restriction  to  hospital  use  only,  2)  availability  of  short 
acting  beta  agonist  in  the  clinical  setting,  3)  the  need  to  observe  patients  during  the  first  hour  after 
each  dose  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  bronchospasm,  4)  contraindication  in  patients  with  asthma, 
COPD  and  acute  respiratory  symptoms,  5)  SmPC  warnings  related  to  the  bronchospasm  reflected  on 
the pouch Label. In addition, the CHMP recommended that educational materials should be provided to 
healthcare professionals to ensure safe and effective use of the product.  
In the pivotal efficacy studies, discontinuations due to AE’s were rare and occurred only in the group 
treated with Staccato loxapine 10 mg (1.2%, 3/259).  
There  is  a  lack  of  data  regarding  patients  using  concomitantly  lorazepam  or  other  ventilation 
depressants  and  elderly  patients  due  to  the  design  of  the  submitted  clinical  studies.  Appropriate 
warnings have been reflected in the SmPC regarding these patient populations.  
A  post  authorisation  study  (PASS)  to  further  investigate  respiratory  safety  concern  in  real  world 
settings, together with a retrospective drug utilisation study to determine the usage of Adasuve have 
been  included  as  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP).  Safety 
data from the PASS will also be further collected regarding patients on concomitant medicinal products 
and potential lack of efficacy.  
In  addition,  according  to  the  discussion  on  clinical  pharmacology  (see  2.4.4),  drug  interaction  study 
with  lorazepam  and  QT/QTc  study  after  repeated  dosing  will  be  performed  to  address  potential 
interaction with concomitant benzodiazepines and QT prolongation after 2 doses. These are also part of 
the risk management plan (see 2.7.2). 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the  
SmPC.  Appropriate  measures  including  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  risk  minimization

activities  (see  2.7)  have  been  put  in  place  to  ensure  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  product  in  the 
recommended indication. 
The CHMP considers the following measures, included as part of the risk management plan, necessary 
to address issues related to safety: 
- A post-authorization observational study to evaluate the safety of Adasuve in agitated Persons in 
routine clinical care 
- A multinational retrospective medical chart review to evaluate utilization patterns of ADASUVE in 
agitated persons in routine clinical care 
- Phase 1 study to assess the safety and PD profile of concomitant administration of single doses of 
Staccato loxapine and lorazepam (i.m.) compared to the administration of each agent alone. 
- 2 dose, double-blind, double-dummy, active and placebo controlled, randomized, 3-period cross-over 
study investigating a 2 doses of 10 mg of ADASUVE given 2 hours apart, a positive control with known 
QT/QTc prolongation (oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg), and an oral placebo/Staccato placebo.

Warnings and precautions for use in SPC Section 4.4 
states: 
In placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with 
asthma or COPD, bronchospasm was very commonly 
observed. When it occurred, it was typically reported 
within 25 minutes after dosing. Consequently, patients 
receiving ADASUVE should be observed as appropriate 
following dosing. ADASUVE has not been investigated in 
patients with other forms of lung disease. Should 
bronchospasm occur after treatment with ADASUVE, it 
can be treated with a short-acting beta-agonist 
bronchodilator e.g., salbutamol (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). ADASUVE should not be re-administered in 
patients who develop any respiratory signs/symptoms 
(see section 4.3). 
Described and listed as ADR in Section 4.8 of the SPC: 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Common: throat irritation 
Uncommon: bronchospasm (including shortness of 
breath) 
Bronchospasm 
In short-term (24-hour), placebo-controlled trials in 
patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia or 
bipolar disorder without active airways disease, 
bronchospasm (which includes reports of wheezing, 
shortness of breath or cough) was uncommon in 
patients treated with ADASUVE. However, in placebo-
controlled clinical trials in subjects with mild-to-
moderate persistent asthma or moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adverse 
reactions of bronchospasm were reported very 
commonly. Most of these events occurred within 25 
minutes of dosing, were mild to moderate in severity, 
and could be relieved with an inhaled bronchodilator. 
Package Leaflet, Section 2: 
Do not take ADASUVE 
if you have symptoms of wheezing or shortness of 
breath; 
if you have lung problems like asthma or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (which your doctor 
may have called "COPD"). 
Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor or nurse will talk to you before you take 
ADASUVE and determine whether it is appropriate for 
you. 
ADASUVE may cause narrowing of the airways 
(bronchospasm) and may cause you to wheeze, 
cough, feel chest tightness or have shortness of 
breath. Typically, this occur within 25 minutes of

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Adasuve (loxapine) is a pre-dispensed inhalation powder. The product is a hand-held device for single 
use  by  inhalation  of  a  5  mg  or  a  10  mg  dose  of  the  antipsychotic  loxapine.  This  new  method  of 
administration  (oral  inhalation)  is  intended  to  ensure  peak  plasma  levels  in  the  systemic  circulation 
within  minutes  after  administration  thus  according  to  the  applicant  addressing  the  unmet  need  for 
rapid  onset  of  sedation  by  non-invasive  administration.  The  SAG  Psychiatry  group  considered  that 
there  was  a  need  for  alternative  options  in  the  rapid  control  of  agitation  in  adult  patients  with 
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. In this respect, Adasuve may represent a non-invasive alternative to 
the more coercive intramuscular injections. 
In  both  schizophrenia  patients  and  bipolar  I  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  agitation  (baseline  PEC 
score below 18) of an average of one week duration, Adasuve demonstrated improvement in agitation 
levels at 2 hours post dosing as compared to placebo to a statistically significant degree.  
In  study  004-301,  efficacy  of  Adasuve  was  demonstrated  over  placebo,  on  the  primary  endpoint  and 
secondary endpoints defined as PEC score at 2 hours and at 10 minutes timepoint for the tested doses.

For 5 mg dose, PEC scores were: -8.0 at 2hrs (p=0.0004) and -3.1 at 10 minutes (p=n/a). For 10 mg 
dose, PEC scores were: -8.7 at 2hrs (p=<0.0001) and -3.4 at 10 minutes (p<0.0001).  Adasuve 5 mg 
dose appeared as efficacious as the 10 mg dose in decreasing PEC score. Results in the PEC score are 
confirmed by the effects observed on the key secondary endpoints, CGI-I score at 2 hours (for 5 mg: 
2.3,  p=0.0015  and  for  10  mg:  2.1,  p<0.0001),  and  in  the  additional  secondary  endpoints,  with  no 
major difference observed between 5mg and 10 mg doses. 
Similar  efficacy  results  were  observed  in  study  004-302,  conducted  in  acutely  agitated  bipolar  type  I 
patients. Efficacy of Adasuve was demonstrated over placebo at 2 hours and after 10 minutes for the 
tested  doses.  For  5  mg  dose,  PEC  scores  were:  -8.2  at  2hrs  (p=<0.0001)  and  -3.6  at  10  minutes 
(p=n/a).  For  10  mg  dose,  PEC  scores  were:  -9.2  at  2hrs  (p=<0.0001)  and  -4  at  10  minutes 
(p<0.0001).  No  major  difference  was  observed  between  5mg  and  10  mg  doses  in  decreasing  PEC 
score, as well as on the other main efficacy endpoints. 
In  both  pivotal  studies,  from  30  minutes  post  dose  onwards  the  10  mg  dose  resulted  in  a  40%  or 
higher  decrease  of  agitation  rating  levels  in  about  60%  of  patients,  as  compared  to  26%  of  patients 
who were given placebo  and a significant proportion of the patients (approximately 25 to 45%) were 
administered a second dose after the 2 hours to reach an adequate control the agitation. The indirect 
comparison  between  Adasuve  and  i.m.  aripiprazole  and  i.m.  olanzapine  showed  similar  order  of 
magnitude of efficacy in the intended population. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
In study 004-201, the design was limited to only two doses tested (5 mg and 10mg) questioning if the 
minimum effective dose was achieved. No pair-wise comparison was performed between loxapine 5 mg 
and 10 mg.  
In both pivotal studies (004-301,004-302), the 24 hour duration was considered in principle adequate 
to assess efficacy given the intended short term treatment in acute agitation. However, no data were 
available  on  repeated  use  over  several  days  in  case  the  agitation  showed  a  fluctuating  pattern.  In 
addition,  a  significant  proportion  of  the  patients  (approximately  25  to  45%)  were  administered  a 
second dose after the 2 hours to reach an adequate control of the agitation. 
Only  cooperative  patients  with  predominantly  long-standing,  mild  to  moderately  severe  agitation 
symptoms were included. This may more accurately reflect symptoms of exacerbation of disease.  
Although the study criteria for 004-301 and 004-302 were similar to the clinical studies performed for 
other  approved  drugs  in  this  indication  and  used  as  intramuscular  injection,  no  conclusion  on  added 
clinical benefit versus existing available therapy could be made due to the lack of active comparator in 
the pivotal studies.  
The extrapolation of the results from clinical trials to actual clinical setting is questionable for Adasuve 
since the product is used as an oral inhaler and a certain level of cooperativeness from the patient is 
required under such administration.  
There  was  a  1.6-2.0  point  decrease  in  the  PEC  score  change  over  time  (from  4h  to  24h)  across  all 
groups.  According  to  the  applicant,  this  may  have  reflected  some  early  re-emergence  of  symptoms 
across  all  groups.  In  addition,  additional  analyses  indicated  that  the  efficacy  of  Adasuve  10  mg  on 
acute  agitation  in  bipolar  I  disorder  was  not  significant  among  patients  that  were  using  stable 
antipsychotic medication on the primary and key secondary endpoints for 10 mg dose (PEC score at 2 
hours: 1.9, p=0.3559; CGI-I at 2 hours: -0.4, p=0.3637). A possible saturation of dopamine-receptors 
could  not  be  excluded  in  those  patients.  About  35%  of  the  patients  with  schizophrenia  were  taking 
concomitant antipsychotics at the time of dosing while approximately 13% of the patients with bipolar

disorder were taking these drugs. Appropriate warning related to limited efficacy has been reflected in 
the SmPC regarding patients using concomitant medication predominantly antipsychotics. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Loxapine is a conventional antipsychotic with a well-known safety and adverse events profile similar to 
other conventional antipsychotics, including the occurrence of hypokinetic rigidity syndrome.  
Adasuve was reasonably well tolerated in the studied population. However, high risk of bronchospasm 
in lung disease patients has been identified. This risk is most likely due to specific tolerability problem 
in  susceptible  individuals,  given  the  novel  route  of  administration  of  this  product,  used  as  an inhaler. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  this  patient  population  were  excluded  in  the  pivotal  studies  and  were  only 
investigated in phase I studies. 
In  subjects  with  asthma  or  COPD,  bronchospasm  (which  included  reports  of  wheezing,  shortness  of 
breath or cough) was reported in patients following administration of 2 inhaled doses of loxapine with a 
8-10  hour  interval.  Bronchospasm  was  reported  in  14  of  26  subjects  (53.8%)  with  mild-to-moderate 
persistent  asthma,  and  in  5  of  26  subjects  (19.2%)  with  COPD.  These  events  occurred  within  25 
minutes of dosing in 12 of the 14 asthma subjects and in 4 of the 5 COPD subjects. The events were 
rated  mild  to  moderate  in  severity.  Spontaneous  recovery  did  not  occur  in  13  asthma  and  2  COPD 
subjects  so  that  treatment  with  an  inhaled  bronchodilatator  was  required.    After  the  SAG  Psychiatry 
and PRAC consultations, the following risk minimisation measures were considered sufficient to address 
this  risk:  1)  restriction  to  hospital  use  only,  2)  availability  of  short  acting  beta  agonist  in  the  clinical 
setting, 3) the need to observe patients during the first hour after each dose for signs and symptoms 
of bronchospasm , 4) contraindication in patients with asthma, COPD and acute respiratory symptoms, 
5) SmPC warnings related to the bronchospasm reflected on the pouch Label. In addition, educational 
materials  to  the  attention  of  healthcare  professionals  were  considered  necessary  to  ensure  safe  and 
effective use of the product. 
Pharmacodynamic  data  confirmed  the  fast  onset  of  sedative  effect  achieved  with  loxapine  inhalation. 
However  this  effect  appeared  much  weaker  in  patients  on  stable,  chronic  antipsychotic  regimens  as 
compared to healthy subjects. A combined sedative and respiratory effect was also observed and this 
may  predispose  to  over-sedation  in  case  of  co-administration  with  other  ventilation  depressants  such 
as hypnosedatives including benzodiazepines.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A  QT/QTc  study  did  not  reveal  significant  effect  of  a  single  dose  of  loxapine  10  mg  on  cardiac 
repolarization  as  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  effect  on  QT  was  not  evaluated  after  repeated 
administration. Whilst similar systemic exposures to oral loxapine 50 mg and inhaled loxapine 10 mg 
were  observed,  the  recommended  daily  dose  for  oral  loxapine  was  found  to  be  much  higher  than  50 
mg  with  200  mg/day  (up  to  600  mg/day  in  certain  cases)  which  can  be  given  once  a  day  in  the 
evening or in any fractionated doses during the day. The posology of oral loxapine hence suggested a 
much  higher  exposure  to  loxapine  and  its  active  metabolites  (due  to  the  high  first  pass  effect)  as 
compared  to  the  proposed  posology  for  inhaled  loxapine  (“no  more  than  2  doses”),  hence  the  CHMP 
considered  that  on  this  basis  and  the  safety  profile  of  oral  loxapine,  the  risk  for  QTc  prologation 
appeared  to  be  limited  and  manageable  in  clinical  practice.  The  applicant  agreed  to  conduct  an 
additional investigating QT/QTc study with 2 doses of 10 mg given 2 hours apart. This study is part of 
the risk management plan.

There  is  a  lack  of  data  regarding  patients  using  concomitantly  lorazepam  or  other  ventilation 
depressants  and  elderly  patients  due  to  the  design  of  the  submitted  clinical  studies.    Appropriate 
warnings  have  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC  regarding  these  patient  populations.  Further  data  are 
intended  to  be  collected  via  a  combined  postauthorisation  safety  and  drug  utilisation  study  to 
characterise: 1) the safety profile of Adasuve in the broader agitated population than the one included 
in the clinical studies; 2) usage of Adasuve in the approved indication in the EU. This study is part of 
the risk management plan. 
A  post  authorisation  study  (PASS)  to  further  investigate  respiratory  safety  concern  in  real  world 
settings, together with a retrospective drug utilisation study to determine the usage of Adasuve have 
also  been  included  as  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  the  RMP.  Safety  data  from  the  PASS 
will also be further collected regarding patients on concomitant medicinal products and potential lack of 
efficacy.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Adasuve  is  claimed  to  ensure  peak  plasma  levels  in  the  systemic  circulation  within  minutes  after 
administration thus according to the applicant addressing the unmet need for rapid onset of sedation 
by non-invasive administration. Whilst, the advantageous new route of administration as compared to 
intramuscular  injection  has  been  recognised  by  the  SAG  Psychiatry,  the  added  benefit  related  to  the 
rapid onset of sedation as compared to the available existing therapies (including oral route) has not 
been  established  due  to  the  lack  of  active  comparator  in  the  pivotal  studies.  In  addition,  the  studied 
population presented only mild to moderate agitation and was not fully representative of the patients 
with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder requiring rapid control of the agitation, given a certain level of 
cooperativeness  was  required  to  use  the  oral  inhaler.  Limited  efficacy  was  also  observed  among 
patients using concomitant medications, predominantly antipsychotics. 
Nevertheless,  Adasuve  demonstrated  improvement  in  agitation  levels  at  2  hours  post  dosing  as 
compared to placebo to a statistically significant degree and indirect comparison with i.m. aripiprazole 
and i.m. olanzapine showed a similar order of magnitude in terms of efficacy.   
The  risk  of  bronchospasm  is  the  most  important  unfavourable  effect  of  Adasuve.  It  was  however 
considered  manageable  in  the  intended  clinical  setting  by  the  SAG-Psychiatry.  The  following  risk 
minimisation  measures  were  considered  sufficient  to  address  this  risk:  1)  restriction  to  hospital  use 
only, 2) availability of short acting beta agonist in the clinical setting, 3) the need to observe patients 
during the first hour after each dose for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm , 4) contraindication in 
patients  with  asthma,  COPD  and  acute  respiratory  symptoms,  5)  SmPC  warnings  related  to  the 
bronchospasm  reflected  on  the  pouch  Label.  In  addition,  educational  materials  to  the  attention  of 
healthcare professionals were considered necessary to ensure safe and effective use of the product. 
Benefit-risk balance 
In line with the SAG-Psychiatry, the CHMP concluded that there would be a patient population in which 
Adasuve  can  be  used  in  clinical  practice,  provided  that  its  use  is  limited  to  patients  with  mild  to 
moderate  acute  agitation,  without  evidence  of  active  airways  disease  and  that  only  a  maximum  of  2 
doses  is  administered  to  the  patients.  The  CHMP  therefore  considered  that  the  presented  data  could 
support the indication “rapid control of mild to moderate agitation in adult patients with schizophrenia 
and  Bipolar  I  disorder”,  provided  the  recommended  measures  to  minimise  the  risk  of  bronchospasm 
are put in place.

4. Recommendations 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Adasuve  in  the  treatment  of  “the  rapid  control  of  mild-to-moderate 
agitation  in  adult  patients  with  schizophrenia  or  bipolar  disorder”  is  favourable  and  therefore

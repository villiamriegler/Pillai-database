During the assessment, the CHMP noted that 100 rpm was used but 50 rpm should have been used when 
performing dissolution studies with a paddle apparatus (100 rpm can be used using a basket apparatus). 
Therefore,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  repeat  dissolution  testing  under  acceptable  apparatus/rpm 
conditions. 
In  vitro  dissolution  profiles  comparison  of  the  test  and  reference  product  were  presented  for  both 
strengths, 120 and 240 mg, at the acid stage (0.1N HCl) followed by buffer stage (pH 6.8 phosphate 
buffer) and at the acid stage (pH 4.5 acetate buffer) followed by buffer stage (pH 6.8 phosphate buffer). 
The data suggests that both test and reference product shows more than 85% drug release within 15 
minutes at buffer stage for QC dissolution media (acid stage: 0.1N HCl + buffer stage: pH 6.8 phosphate 
buffer). Therefore, the dissolution profiles are considered similar without any mathematical calculation 
As part of the responses, the applicant explained that the impact of 50 and 100 rpm on test and reference 
product in the selected dissolution media (0.1N HCl followed by pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) was studied 
during development. As incomplete release was observed at 50 rpm; 100 rpm speed was considered

Both test and reference product shows more than 70% release within 5 minutes. The test product shows

The GMR of the test to reference product and associated 90% CI of the AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were contained 
within 80.00% - 125.00%. However, as the intra subject CV of Reference Product -R (%) was >30%

The  significant  formulation  effect  might  be  contributed  to  low  T/R  ratio  observed  in  the  study  for  ln-
transformed  PK parameter AUC0-t. As the decision  of bioequivalence is  based on the 90% CI and T/R 
ratio for ln transformed PK parameter AUC0-t the study met both the bioequivalence criteria with respect 
to AUC0-t. Hence, this formulation effect is just statistically significant and can be ignored. 
The  cause  for  significant  sequence  effect  may  not  be  found  with  certainty.  Therefore  under  special 
circumstances the significant sequence effect can be ignored. The study [1] was a single dose study [2] 
was  in  healthy  volunteers,  [3]  was  not  comparing  an  endogenous  substance,  [4]  had  an  adequate 
washout and [5] used appropriate design and analysis. Hence, this sequence effect is just statistically

19 August 1994.  
DMF and MEF are esters of fumaric acid. DMF is pre-systemically hydrolysed by ubiquitous esterases to 
its major active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which is further degraded to fumaric acid (FA). 
Likewise, MEF is metabolized by esterases to FA. 
Two types of Fumaderm have been licensed in Germany, which serve for titration during the initial three 
weeks  of  treatment  (“Fumaderm  initial  magensaftresistente  Tabletten  für  Erwachsene”,  German  MA 
number  27561.00.00)  and  in  the  subsequent  weeks  including  maintenance  of  therapy  (“Fumaderm

Instead,  the  comparison  of  relative  magnitudes  of  the  stimulatory/inhibitory  effects  in  healthy  and

In  fibroblasts  from  uninvolved  psoriatic  skin,  the  stimulation  of SUDH  generally  prevailed  for  all  FAEs

In the dossier for the MAA of Tecfidera, DMF was shown to activate the ubiquitous transcription factor

In investigations provided under the MAA of Tecfidera, MEF salts were tested in the range of 0 – 12 µg/ml,

A recent publication reports the distribution of MMF and MEF after oral administration of either 100 mg/kg

rats (Wipke et al., 2021). MMF widely distributed in both species and reached higher concentrations in

with this finding, no MEF was detected in plasma or tissues of mice after oral administration of DMF, and, 
conversely, no DMF or MMF was identified in mice after oral administration of MEF. Thus, DMF and MEF

After single oral administration of 100 mg/kg DMF or 79 mg/kg MEF salts in 0.8 % hydroxypropyl methylcellulose to C57Bl/6 mice (A, 
C) or Sprague-Dawley rats (B, D), plasma and tissue levels (brain, spleen, jejunum, kidney, and liver) of MMF and MEF were determined 
30 min post dose. The relative tissue penetration in relation to plasma is given above each bar. Brain or kidney to plasma ratios of 
MMF and MEF in mice and rats highlight the significantly higher MMF brain exposure vs. MEF (E), whereas MEF reaches significantly 
higher levels in kidney than MMF (from Wipke et al., 2021). 
Overall, the provided in vitro and in vivo PK non-clinical data shows that DMF and MEF are two different 
(to some extent) active moieties which share a similar metabolic pathway leading to the formation of 
fumaric acid (an inactive moiety). DMF and MEF are not metabolites of each other in vivo. In addition, 
in  vitro  data  using  liver  microsomes  or  hepatocytes  from  rats  and  humans  shows  that  MEF  does  not

rats) study, MMF the  active metabolite of DMF reached higher  concentrations in the brain and spleen 
than MEF. In contrast, MEF is preferentially distributed into the kidney (Wipke et al., 2021).

Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
The submitted pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic non-clinical data shows that DMF and MEF are 
two active moieties with pharmacological modes of action that are putatively different, but applicable for 
the  indication  of  psoriasis.  Nevertheless  a  straightforward  additive  or  synergistic  effect  of  MEF  in  the 
combination cannot be concluded due to the limitations of the conducted non-clinical studies.  
After oral administration, DMF is not detected in plasma because it is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases to 
its  active  metabolite  MMF  and/or  interacts  with  GSH  to  form  conjugates  (Skilarence,  EPAR).  MMF  is 
further degraded to fumaric acid (FA). Likewise, MEF is metabolized by esterases to FA (Rostami-Yazdi

shortcomings in this study, including the fact that the amount of DMF in the DMF/MEF combination was 
twice of the amount of DMF in the monotherapy arm. Therefore, patients in the DMF monotherapy group 
may have been treated with doses which were not sufficient for all patients and it is therefore difficult to 
assess any additive effects of the MEF esters.

There is no information on demographics and patients’ disease features (e.g. severity of psoriasis, 
disease duration, previous treatment) across the groups. In the absence of randomization or any other 
method to control for baseline unbalance (the article established that the choice of the therapy was 
determined by a patient´s insurance), this is a critical shortcoming that prevents the interpretation on 
causal effects.  
Moreover, mild topical corticosteroid was allowed during the study. However, no further information 
about the topical treatment was provided. No information about statistical analysis was found. Taking 
into consideration the evaluation of psoriasis, usage of topical corticosteroid might have distorted the 
results of the study. There are critical flaws in the study methods and statistical analysis, therefore no 
conclusion can be drawn from this study. 
Furthermore, longer dose titration scheme was used in the DMF/MEF combination group compared to 
DMF group. Finally, differences in formulations (galenical formulation of the DMF/MEF combination and 
semienteric-coated DMF capsules) preclude the comparison of efficacy and safety of both products.

authors claimed these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05) and thus could be interpreted 
as  supporting  clinically  relevant  effects  of  MEF-Na.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  average 
psoriasis severity score, established as efficacy endpoint in the section of methods in the article, was 
not different between both groups. Subscores were not presented as endpoints in this study and there 
was no evidence of adjustment for multiplicity. Therefore, the claim on statistical significance on scaling 
and itching scores could not be agreed. The small sample size is an additional limitation of the study.  
No difference was seen between the 720 mg versus the 240 mg regimen with regard to the number of 
improved  patients.  The  average  final  scores  of  the  total  groups  and  the  extent  of  the  eruption,  the 
redness and the thickness were the same, but significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between 
the final scores of scaling and itching of both groups. 
Treatment  with  MEF-Na  at  the  dose  of  720mg  or  240  mg  daily  resulted  in  comparable  considerable 
improvements  (>50%  n=3  in  both  groups).  Indeed,  the  same  number  of  patients  showed  an 
improvement > 50% of the global score in both groups.  
No difference between MEF-Na at the dose of 240 mg daily and placebo was observed in Study II.

An ad hoc statistical analysis of Nieboer 1989 comparing the 240 mg Na-MEF data of Study IV, the 
720mg MEF data of Study IV and a group including 240mg – and 720mg MEF data to the combined 
placebo  data  of  Studies  II  and  III  was  also  taken  into  account.  The  patients  in  these  groups  were 
categorized as follows: “responders” who achieve at least 25% improvement, and “non-responders” 
who  achieve  less  improvement  or  deterioration.  The  rate  of  response  between  the  groups  was 
compared using Fisher’s Exact test (FET) or a chi-squared. Additionally, ordered logistic regression was 
applied considering 4 categories (“deteriorated,” to < 25% improvement, to 25 to 50% improvement, 
and to > 50% improvement). In the context of that ad hoc statistical analysis, it was submitted that 
individually  underpowered  studies  (Nieboer  1989)  of  the  effect  of  MEF  in  the  absence  of  DMF 
demonstrates  statistically  significant  efficacy  on  the  improvement  of  a  psoriasis  severity  score 
compared  to  placebo  when  results  are  pooled  to  increase  statistical  power  in  an  ad  hoc  statistical 
analysis.  
While Nieboer 1989 used a global psoriasis score different than the one that is currently considered as 
a  standard  (PASI),  it  should  be  noted  that  in  both  cases  the  response  is  scored  as  a  percentage  of 
improvement with respect to the baseline value. In this regard, a 75% reduction in the PASI score with 
respect to baseline is the current standard of response assessment used for primary endpoints in most 
clinical  trials  of  psoriasis.  Lower  level  of  responses  (e.g.  50%  reduction)  have  also  been  used  as 
endpoints.  However,  responses  below  50%  are  not  considered  as  an  acceptable  demonstration  of 
treatment response. This is in line with the CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of medical products 
indicated for the treatment of Psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr).

Patients 
Randomization into two groups was made between 45 patients. 25 female, 20 male. Aged between 18 
and 70 years. 22 were treated with DMFAE-E C. 23 with FAC-EC. At the end of the study 33 patients 
could be evaluated. 18 had been treated with DMFAE-EC and 15 with FAC-EC. At least 10% of the body 
surface was affected. At the beginning of the study 22 of these 33 patients showed the plaque type; 10 
the macular type; and 1 the guttate type of psoriasis. 11 patients had joint complaints, 6 in the DM FAE-
EC group and 5 in the FAC-EC group.  
Results   
In both groups 4 patients (18 and 15%) showed a full clearance. Considerable improvement occurred in 
15 out of 22 (68%) patients with the plaque type and in 4 out of 10 (40%) of those with the macular 
type. The patient with the guttate type showed a full clearance after a treatment of 2 months with FAC-
EC,  but  had  an  extensive  relapse  1  month  later  even  though  the  therapy  had  been  continued.  For  5 
patients (22%) in the DMF AE-EC group and 1 patient (4%) in the FAC-EC group the psoriasis did not 
show any reaction to the therapy. The observed differences between the two groups appeared to be not 
significant. Deterioration, that is an increase of the score up to more than 125%, was not observed in 
either of the groups.

after 4 months: 18 in the DMFA E- EC group and 15 in the FAC-EC group. The total average score in the 
DMFAE-EC group dropped from 9.7 to 4.1 and in the FAC-EC group from 10.5 to 4.1. The course of this 
score in both treatment groups was not significantly different at any time point (1- V). Subsequently, 
the separate parameters, too, did not show a significant difference in time course. The results after 4 
months were not statistically different. 
The joint complaints of the 6 patients in the DMFAE-EC group showed considerable improvement for 2 
patients, and some improvement for 1, and deteriorated or remained unchanged for the other 3. In the 
5 patients in the FAC-EC group a considerable improvement occurred in 2 cases and a slight improvement 
in 3 cases.

The aim of this double-blind study was to assess the therapeutic effect of DMF monotherapy compared 
to  DMF/MEF  using  the  same  DMF  dosage.  There  was  a  numerical  difference  in  favour  of  DMF/MEF 
compared to DMF monotherapy in regard to the improvement of the psoriasis severity score. However, 
as acknowledged by the authors of the study, the difference is not statistically significant. Higher rate of 
discontinuations were observed in DMF/MEF group compared to DMF group. Overall, the evidence of this 
study is limited due to its small sample size, the short duration of treatment, and the absence of control 
As shown in 23, the anti-psoriatic effect, i.e. improvement of PASI with 240 mg DMF monotherapy was 
less pronounced than with 480 mg DMF resp. 480 mg DMF/MEF, which was administered in the Nieboer 
study (1990). This means, the DMF dose applied in the Nieboer 1989 studies (III and IV) was quite low 
for missing data (table 5 and figure 8 were based on a complete case analysis including 81% of patients 
in the DMFAE-EC [DMF] group and 65% of those in the FAC-EC [DMF/MEF] group). Subscores were not

while a lower difference and no numerical difference were found for scaling and itching, respectively, as 
opposed to Study II and Study IV previously conducted by these authors (Nieboer et al., 1989).

The objective of the BRIDGE study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of DMF 
(LAS41008), compared with placebo and Fumaderm, in adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis. 
In total, 671 patients were randomized and included in the full analysis set (n = 267, LAS41008; n = 
273, Fumaderm; n = 131, placebo).  
In  this  Phase  III,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  noninferiority  trial,  patients  were  randomized  to 
receive LAS41008, Fumaderm, or placebo (2:2:1) for 16 weeks, up titrating to a maximum daily DMF 
dose of 720 mg, depending upon individual response. 
The co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients achieving ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the percentage achieving a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in 
the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included PASI 75 at Weeks 
3 and 8, PASI 50 and PASI 90 at Week 16, and scores of 0 to 1 in the PGA at Weeks 3 and 8 and BSA 
at weeks 3, 8, and 16. 
Statistical analysis 
The sample-size calculations were based on PASI 75 response rates of 50% and 10% for LAS41008 and 
placebo, respectively, and ‘clear’/’almost clear’ PGA response rates of 40% for LAS41008 and 10% for 
placebo. For the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm® regarding PASI 75 at week 16, a zero 
difference was assumed and a noninferiority margin of 15% was set. An alpha level of 0.05 was defined 
and a dropout rate of 15% was factored into the calculations. A total of 690 patients (276 per active 
group  and  138  in  the  placebo  group)  provided  a  power  of  >  99%  for  the  two  superiorities  tests  of 
LAS41008 vs. placebo, and 90% for the non-inferiority test of LAS41008 vs. Fumaderm.

At week 16, 33%, 37.4% and 13% of patients had achieved a score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ in the PGA

Evaluation comment 
Based on the above results, the Authors concluded  that the study has demonstrated the efficacy and 
safety of LAS41008 (DMF) for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, showing it to be 
significantly superior to placebo and noninferior to the approved combination of FAEs (Fumaderm). 
The objective of this double-blind placebo-controlled study was to assess the efficacy and safety of DMF 
compared  with  placebo  and  Fumaderm  (DMF/MEF)  in  adult  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  chronic

There was a small numerical difference in favor of Fumaderm in regard to the co-primary endpoints and 
most of the secondary endpoints. As stated in the EPAR “The effects in regard to the co-primary endpoints 
were numerically slightly lower in the Skilarence group compared to Fumaderm although this could be 
due to variability, a limited PD and the efficacy effect of MEFs in Fumaderm may also be contributing to 
an anti-psoriatic effect”. Therefore, these differences although suggesting an additional therapeutic effect 
of MEF in Fumaderm may also appear due to variability or a limited PD. More importantly, it should be 
noted that this study was aimed to demonstrate superiority of DMF versus placebo and non-inferiority 
versus DMF/MEF. Consequently, the design of this study does not allow to demonstrate superiority of 
DMF/MEF versus DMF.  
The  coprimary  endpoints  were  the  percentage  of  patients  achieving  ≥  75%  improvement  in  Psoriasis

This was a prospective observational trial in patients who were treated with the FAE mixture. Patients 
whose psoriasis had improved and who could tolerate treatment with the FAE mixture were recruited. 
Treatment with the FAE mixture was switched to the DMF product without any interruption on the basis 
of the current DMF dose in the FAE mixture. Patients were then scheduled for the next regular check-up

three months later. To assess psoriasis severity, the PASI index (psoriasis area and severity index) was 
used. When presenting for their first check-up after switching, patients were handed a questionnaire to 
investigate their views about tolerability and efficacy and to provide a global judgment of the switch. 
Results 
A total of 40 patients (24 male, 16 female) were prospectively and consecutively recruited to the study 
and underwent a check-up after switching treatments. The age of adult patients ranged from 18 to 74 
years with a mean age of 46 years. One patient was 13 years old and received treatment off-label.

Efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, while 3/37 had a higher PASI 
severity  after  switching  (Figure  14).  A  PASI  estimate  was  not  available  at  one  of  the  visits  in  3/40 
patients.  
In general, the patients regarded the outcome of the switch to the DMF product as neutral or positive 
(18 positive, 18 neutral, 4 negative).  
Most patients were treated with a daily DMF dose between 120 mg and 480 mg and had previously been 
treated with the FAE mixture for one to five years.

the comparison of 55% - 80% should not be considered a reliable estimate of the difference. Additionally, 
The  comparison  between  DMF  and  Fumaderm  showed  that  Fumaderm  consistently  had  a  numerically 
higher response rate. In FAS population, 37.5% of the patients in the DMF group compared to 40.3% of 
the patients in the Fumaderm group achieved PASI 75 at Week 16. Moreover, the proportion of patients

In Falkvoll et al. (2019) study, efficacy as assessed with the PASI was equal or better in 34/37 patients, 
while 3/37 had a higher PASI severity after switching from DMF/MEF combination to DMF. However, it 
was not stated clearly in how many patients PASI improved. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude on 
differences in efficacy between the two treatments.  
The most relevant study for this assessment appears to be study by Mrowietz et al. (2017), which was 
a  pivotal  study  for  the  Skilarence  MAA.  The  study  was  aimed  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  DMF  to 
placebo and non-inferiority to Fumaderm. Although both co-primary endpoints were met, the robustness 
of the demonstration of non-inferiority to Fumaderm was found questionable. As it was discussed in the

That being so, improved efficacy over (an) individual active substance(s) that have established efficacy 
in the targeted indication (namely, DMF) needs to be shown. The design of the pivotal clinical studies 
should be according to specific clinical guidance, where placebo or standard of care – instead of those 
individual active substances - may be acceptable as comparators. A direct comparison against individual 
active substances with established efficacy in the targeted indication would however still be expected. 
More specifically, for the treatment of psoriasis, a three-armed, parallel-group studies with the active

Taking into account the described results, including the severe methodological limitations of the clinical 
studies, it cannot be concluded based on these data that a clinically relevant therapeutic effect of MEF 
in Fumaderm has been demonstrated.

Therefore, the CHMP concludes that the totality of the available data cannot establish that MEF exerts a 
clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within Fumaderm.  
Further to the above, the Rapporteurs recommend adoption of the opinion.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC for RoActemra 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion in order 
to amend the existing recommendations for monitoring of laboratory abnormalities in systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) patients based on final results from study WA28029 (ARTHUR) listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP; this is a Phase IV study to evaluate decreased dose frequency in sJIA who 
experience laboratory abnormalities during treatment with tocilizumab. The submission of the final study 
report for study WA28029 (ARTHUR) fulfils requirements of Article 46 of the paediatric regulation. The 
RMP version 26.0 has also been submitted. Changes to the RMP reflect the completion of study WA29029 
(ARTHUR) and study WA22480 (ARTIS) which was assessed as part of variation 
EMEA/H/C/000955/II/0094. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
RoActemra (tocilizumab, TCZ) treatment is associated with certain laboratory abnormalities, including 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Recommendations in the SmPC for the 
sJIA patients are to stop TCZ dosing until the laboratory abnormality resolves. 
At the time of opinion for TCZ in the treatment of sJIA in 2011, there was a post approval measure (PAM) 
to investigate the possibility of dose reduction in response to predefined laboratory abnormalities in sJIA 
patients. 
Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) is a 96-week, two part, Phase IV study to explore the efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of intravenous TCZ in reduced 
dosing frequency regimens in patients with adequately controlled sJIA who had experienced a pre-defined 
laboratory abnormality which had resolved on TCZ twice weekly dosing. 
The purpose of Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was to investigate the use of less frequent dosing upon 
reinitiating treatment in patients who have achieved a high level of efficacy with TCZ but have 
experienced these laboratory abnormalities. It was conducted in fulfilment of the PAM. 
The study comprised a run-in phase (Part 1) and the main study (Part 2). Patients could enter Part 2 
directly, or via Part 1.  
The objective of Part 1 was to increase enrolment into Part 2 by identifying patients with resolved 
laboratory abnormalities in Part 1 on the TCZ every two weeks (Q2W) regimen who would be eligible to 
participate in Part 2.  
The objective of Part 2 was to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and 
patient reported outcomes of TCZ in reduced dosing frequency regimens.

The approved intravenous (IV) formulation of tocilizumab (TCZ) 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion in 10 ml vials was used as test product in the study. Patients received TCZ according the 
approved posology. 
Pharmacokinetics and Population PK  
Reduction of the dosing frequency from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W led to a decrease in exposure 
metrics. Post-infusion concentration (Cmax) at 12 weeks decreased due to a lower accumulation, with -16 
and -26% from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W, respectively. The area under the curve during a dosing 
interval (AUCt) is decreasing in the same proportion with -15 and -30%, respectively. The decrease of the 
concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Cmin) was observed to be more pronounced with -64 and -
87% from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W, respectively, and can be contributed to target mediated drug 
disposition (TMDD).   
The decrease in exposure, especially in Cmin, was not indicated to have major impact on response in 
terms of IL-6, sIL-6R levels and PD parameters.  
Although the sample size is rather low (N=22; 495 measurable serum concentrations), PK results indicate 
that the PK concentration-time data for sJIA patients following decreased dose frequency were consistent 
with the previously established pharmacokinetic characteristics and population PK model developed for 
tocilizumab in sJIA patients. PK parameter Cmin at week 12 changed the most with extension of dosing 
interval. Compared to Q2W, when the dosing interval increased to Q3W and Q4W, the mean Cmin 
decreased from 74.7 μg/mL to 27.2 μg/mL and 9.73 μg/mL, respectively. Cmax and AUCτ decreased with 
about 15% (Q3W) and 30% (Q4W). 
As PK is characterized by a high degree of TMDD and by a strong effect of body weight on PK, conclusions 
on the PK/PD relationship with respect to efficacy and safety in general should be drawn with caution, 
given the small population Part 2 of the study is based on. 
Efficacy Results 
Nineteen 19 patients enrolled in Part 1, and finally 22 patients were enrolled into Part 2; 16 patients 
enrolled directly into Part 2, and an additional 6 patients entered via Part 1. Of these 22 patients, 7 
patients completed the study under the in Part 2 of the study is rather small.  
The key efficacy measures were Juvenile Arthritis Disease, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) flare, and 
fever (attributable to sJIA). 
JADAS-71 scores generally remained near the level of inactive disease (<1.0) for the majority of patients 
throughout the study during TCZ IV Q3W and TCZ IV Q4W dosing. There were increases in the JADAS-71 
scores at the time of sJIA flare as expected. 
Overall, sJIA continued to be well-controlled (no flare) in 17/22 patients (77%) during Part 2. Five 
patients (23%) experienced a flare during the study with one patient experiencing two flares (at 
consecutive study visits). 
During TCZ IV Q3W dosing, three of the 15 patients on 8 mg/kg TCZ flared, and one of the seven 
patients on 12 mg/kg TCZ flared. The flares occurred at Week 9, Week 12, Week 15 (8 weeks after last 
dose of study drug), and in one patient at Week 18 and 21. One of the seven patients who transitioned to 
TCZ IV Q4W flared during Q4W dosing at Week 32 (week 53 from Part 2 baseline). The patient was 
receiving TCZ IV 8 mg/kg. 
There were no patients who experienced fever due to sJIA during the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 5/36 
 
 
  
  
In conclusion, the data indicated that sJIA continued to be well-controlled during the reduced dosing 
frequency regimens of TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W. However, the CHMP noted that the data base is rather 
small, which precluded a robust conclusion. 
Safety results 
The safety outcomes from this study were similar to those achieved in other studies with TCZ IV Q2W and 
were consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ IV in sJIA. No new or unexpected safety concerns 
were observed. 
In conclusion, the study showed that sJIA patients who had experienced a laboratory abnormality (low 
neutrophils, low platelets, or increased ALT or AST) during IV TCZ Q2W treatment could maintain efficacy 
during an increased dosing interval of TCZ IV Q3W or Q4W. However, the data are not considered 
sufficient to introduce a dose adjustment in sJIA patients who experience laboratory abnormalities. 
Therefore, Section 4.2 of the SmPC is revised as follows: 
“There are insufficient clinical data to assess the impact of a tocilizumab dose reduction in sJIA patients 
who have experienced laboratory abnormalities.” 
The benefit-risk balance of RoActemra, remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
TCZ treatment is associated with certain laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Dose modification recommendations in sJIA are to stop TCZ 
dosing until the laboratory abnormality resolves.  
The EMA approval of TCZ for the treatment of sJIA in 2011 was on condition that a post approval 
measure (PAM) be completed. This PAM was to investigate the possibility of dose reduction in response to 
predefined laboratory abnormalities in sJIA patients.  
Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was a 96-week, two part, Phase IV study to explore the efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) in 
reduced dosing frequency regimens in patients with adequately controlled sJIA who had experienced a 
pre-defined laboratory abnormality which had resolved on TCZ twice weekly dosing. 
The purpose of Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was to investigate the use of less frequent dosing upon 
reinitiating treatment in patients who have achieved a high level of efficacy with TCZ but have 
experienced these laboratory abnormalities 
The study comprised a run-in phase (Part 1) and the main study (Part 2). Patients could enter Part 2 
directly, or via Part 1.  
The objective of Part 1 was to increase enrolment into Part 2 by identifying patients with resolved 
laboratory abnormalities in Part 1 on the TCZ every two weeks (Q2W) regimen who would be eligible to 
participate in Part 2.  
The objective of Part 2 was to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and 
patient reported outcomes of TCZ in reduced dosing frequency regimens. 
The approved intravenous (IV) formulation of tocilizumab (TCZ) 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion in 10 ml vials was used as test product in the study. 
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
STUDY WA28029 
The objective of Part 2 was to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and 
patient reported outcomes of tocilizumab in reduced dosing frequency regimens.  
The PK objective in Part 2 of the study was to describe the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in reduced 
dosing frequency regimens. The primary PD objective in Part 2 of the study was to describe the 
pharmacodynamics using sIL-6R and C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunogenicity of tocilizumab in 
reduced dosing frequency regimens. 
Please see Efficacy section for Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP); 
Interleukin-6, and Interleukin-6 Soluble Receptor (sIL-6R).  
In the WA28029 study, doses of 8 mg/kg for patients ≥30 kg and 12 mg/kg for patients <30 kg were 
used, as per the approved global TCZ sJIA label. Dose selection adjustment in Part 2 of Q3W and Q4W 
was designed in conjunction with the EMA to address the post approval measure to investigate the dose 
reduction response to predefined laboratory abnormalities in sJIA patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 8/36 
 
 
  
  
Once patients entered Part 2 they received tocilizumab dosed by body weight (12 mg/kg for patients 
<30kg; 8 mg/kg for patients ≥ 30 kg) by IV infusion every three weeks (Q3W) for a minimum of 5 
consecutive infusions. Each patient maintained Q3W dosing of TCZ in the study up to 52 weeks unless the 
patient experienced a predefined laboratory abnormality. Following the occurrence and resolution of the 
laboratory abnormality, patients who maintained adequate disease control (JADAS ≤3.8 and absence of 
fever attributable to sJIA) moved to dosing every 4 weeks (Q4W) of tocilizumab. 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Bioanalytics 
Determination of the serum concentration of TCZ was conducted using ELISA, with the limit of 
quantification (LOQ) was 100 ng/mL. The assay precision (CV%) ranged from 9.9% to 14.5%. The overall 
accuracy (% relative error) ranged from 95.5% to 103.9%. 
PK and PD data 
The study screened 20 patients in Part 1, of which 19 patients enrolled to receive TCZ IV Q2W. A total of 
26 patients were screened for entry into Part 2 (which included patients who had previously participated 
in Part 1, and patients who were entering Part 2 directly). Of these 26 patients, 22 were enrolled into Part 
2; 16 patients enrolled directly into Part 2, and an additional 6 entered via Part 1. 
All patients had sparse serum PK samples taken. 
For Q3W regimen, the following PK samples were collected: 
· Pre-dose at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48. 
· Post-dose (obtained within 15 minutes following end of infusion): day 1 and weeks 3, 6 and 9. 
· At any time point during the day at weeks 1, 2, 10 and 11. 
For Q4W regimen, the following PK samples were collected: 
· Pre-dose at baseline and at weeks 4, 8 and 12. 
· Post-dose (obtained within 15 minutes following end of infusion): day 1 and week 4 and 8 
· At any time point during the day at weeks 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11 
For patients who withdrew from the study a PK sample was taken 2 weeks after last study drug. 
Safety, safety laboratory, PK, PD, and efficacy assessments were performed during Part 2 of the study as 
described in the schedule of assessments.  
PK Analysis 
A detailed analysis of the PK data using population PK modelling was performed. The PK model developed 
for sJIA patients from previous studies (WA28118 and WA18221) using IV and SC data was used to 
analyze the serum concentration-time data. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling (using NOMMEM software) 
was used to analyze the serum concentration-time data collected in Part 2 of the study. A Bayesian 
feedback analysis was conducted by fixing the TCZ population PK parameters and by assuming that PK 
properties of tocilizumab are consistent in sJIA patients across the different dosing frequencies. 
The following systemic exposure parameters were estimated for all patients who provided adequate PK 
samples: 
-  AUCτ during a dosing interval at week 12 of Part 2; τ = 3 weeks for Q3W and τ = 4 weeks for Q4W 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 9/36 
 
 
  
  
-  Cmax post infusion at Week 12 of Part 2 of the study 
-  Cmin at end of a dosing interval at Week 12 of Part 2 of the study 
TCZ serum concentrations and computed PK parameters are listed and summarized descriptively. Mean 
and median serum concentrations versus time are plotted on linear scales. Patient data were included in 
the PK analysis if it contained sufficient dosing information and at least one adequately documented and 
quantifiable TCZ concentration per patient. 
TCZ serum concentrations and serum concentration of PD markers are summarized descriptively by dose 
frequency and body weight dosing category. Mean (± standard error of mean) or median (with 
interquartile range) serum concentrations versus time are presented graphically. 
TCZ serum concentration response relationship (PD markers and efficacy parameters) were also explored. 
TCZ serum concentration individual profiles were presented with JADAS-71 individual results at visits, 
together with the eventual presence of JIA flare and fever attributable to sJIA. 
Immunogenicity 
Samples for anti-TCZ antibodies were collected for all patients to evaluate the immunogenicity of 
tocilizumab at baseline and Week 24 for patients on Q2W in Part 1. In addition, samples were collected at 
baseline, Week 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 (for patients on Q3W dosing in Part 2) and at baseline, eight weeks, 
and 12 weeks after switching to Q4W for patients on Q4W dosing in Part 2 of the study. Samples were 
collected at the last study visit, or at the time of early withdrawal from the study (visit WD1) for Part 1 or 
Part 2 of the study. Event-driven sampling (at the time of the event and at least 6 weeks after the last 
dose) occurred for all patients experiencing serious infusion-related or allergic reactions or any 
hypersensitivity event (including non-serious events) leading to treatment withdrawal in Part 1 or Part 2 
of the study. 
Blood samples were collected from all patients for the evaluation of immunogenicity of tocilizumab using 
a “tiered” testing strategy by immunogenicity assays: 
•      All samples were tested with a screening assay, and those samples that were positive were further 
analyzed with a confirmation assay to confirm specificity 
•      If the confirmation assay was positive, an additional two tests were performed  to  characterize the 
detected ADA; a neutralizing assay was to test ADA’s neutralizing potential, and  an IgE assay was to 
verify whether the detected ADA were of the IgE isotype 
Based on the testing strategy, if the screening assay of a given serum sample was negative, then the 
results of the confirmation, neutralizing and IgE assays were assumed to be negative. If the screening 
assay was positive, and the confirmation assay was negative, then the results of neutralizing assay and 
IgE assay were assumed to be negative. 
Since only one patient at baseline in Part 1 and no patients in Part 2 of the study presented with positive 
antibodies only a listing was produced. 
6.2.  Results 
Population PK analyses of tocilizumab following IV and SC administration in sJIA patients 1-17 years old 
were previously conducted using a PK database composed of 878 PK samples from 89 patients from the 
Phase 3 Study WA18221 (IV administration) and 832 PK samples from 51 patients from the Phase 1b 
Study WA28118 (SC administration). The population model that best described the serum concentration-
time profiles of TCZ was a two-compartment open model with parallel linear and Michaelis-Menten 
eliminations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 10/36 
 
 
  
  
This tocilizumab population model was used as reference to analyze the PK data collected in Part 2 of the 
Study WA28029 in sJIA patients with decreased dose frequency. 
In total, 577 tocilizumab serum concentrations measured from 22 sJIA patients who entered Part 2 in 
Study WA28029 were available for the pop PK analyses. During tocilizumab treatment, 5.5% (n=32) of 
the serum concentrations from 7 sJIA patients were BLQ and were excluded from the analysis dataset. 
Dosing information was missing in 7 patients who continued to receive tocilizumab after the end of the 
Part 2. The serum concentrations for tocilizumab collected following those administrations were excluded 
from the analysis dataset. They represented 2.3% (n=13) of the serum concentrations. 
In addition, 5.7% (n=33) of the serum concentrations were excluded from the dataset due to their 
inconsistent serum concentration levels. Fifteen of those inconsistent serum concentrations were selected 
to be re-assayed. Finally, only 4 concentrations from the same patient could be re-assayed and the new 
concentrations were very similar to the previous concentrations.  
The final PK dataset was composed of 22 patients from Phase IV Study WA28029, with a total of 495 
measurable TCZ serum concentrations following the 8 mg/kg IV for sJIA patients weighing ≥ 30 kg and 
12 mg/kg IV Q2W for sJIA patients weighing < 30 kg, either Q3W or Q4W. Patients in Study WA28029 
ranged from 5 to 17 years old, with the median age of 10 years. A majority of patients in both Part 1 
(89.5%) and Part 2 (81.8%) were of white ethnicity. By gender 52.6% (10 patients) were male and 
47.4% (9 patients) were female patients ranging in age from 3 to 17 years of age in Part 1. In Part 2, 
63.4% (14 patients) of patients enrolled were female and 36.4% (8 patients) were male ranging in age 
from 5 to 17 years of age. Median weight was 32.5 kg in Part 1 and 38.5 kg in Part 2. Ten of the 19 
patients enrolled in Part 1 had previously received tocilizumab, and 9 were tocilizumab -naive. As it was a 
prerequisite for study entry, all patients entering Part 2 had previously received tocilizumab, and were in 
clinical remission of sJIA at baseline. Only one patient at baseline in Part 1 and no patients in Part 2 of 
the study developed anti-drug antibodies. 
Evaluation of the results from the Bayesian feedback analysis showed that the PK concentration-time data 
for sJIA patients with decreased tocilizumab dose frequency are in full agreement with the population PK 
model previously developed for tocilizumab. The individual fits for the serum concentration-time profiles 
showed that the population PK model previously developed for sJIA patients was able to describe the PK 
concentration data for sJIA patients with decreased dosing frequency. The serum concentrations that 
were removed due to inconsistencies are indicated in red in those individual plots of individual serum 
concentration -time courses which are depicted below (linear scale).

To show the changes induced by the reduction of the dosing frequency from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to 
Q4W, on the secondary PK parameters, simulations were conducted using the individual primary PK 
parameters of the 22 sJIA patients.  
As expected, the increase of the dosing interval led to a decrease of the post-infusion concentration 
(Cmax) at 12 weeks due to a lower accumulation, with -16% and -26% from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to 
Q4W dosing, respectively. The area under the curve during a dosing interval (AUCτ) decreased in the 
same proportion with -15% and -30%, respectively. The decrease of the concentration at the end of a 
dosing interval (Cmin) was more pronounced with -64% and -87% from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W 
dosing, respectively (see table below). The larger decrease in Cmin was due to the concentration 
dependent clearance of tocilizumab that represents the target mediated drug disposition (TMDD).  
The longer the dosing interval is for a given dose, the more important will be the contribution of TMDD 
and in turn, more pronounced will be the decrease of Cmin. 
The analysis of PK parameters (Cmax, Cmin, AUC) demonstrated tocilizumab serum concentrations were 
consistent with other sJIA tocilizumab studies in patients 2-17 years of age. 
Compared to Q2W, when the dosing interval increased to Q3W and Q4W, the mean Cmin decreased from 
74.7 μg/mL to 27.2 μg/mL and 9.73 μg/mL, respectively. The concentration post infusion (Cmax) also 
decreased but with lower magnitude from 253 μg/mL to 213 μg/mL and 187 μg/mL, respectively. 
Similarly, the area under the curve (AUCτ) during a dosing interval at week 12, decreased from  
1785 μg/mL to 1516 μg/mL and 1245 μg/mL × day, respectively.

6.3.  Discussion 
Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was a 52-week study (Part 2), following a run-in phase (Part 1) of 24 weeks. 
Part 2 of the study aimed at exploring the clinical pharmacology in terms of PK, PD and immunogenicity 
of IV TCZ in a reduced dosing frequency in patients who had adequately controlled sJIA and experienced 
a pre-defined laboratory abnormality that had resolved on TCZ twice weekly dosing. 
In the main study (Part 2) patients received TCZ IV Q3W or Q4W dosing (8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg 
depending on body weight with body weight cut of 30 kg).  
Overall, the study had a small sample size with 22 patients enrolled in Part 2 of the study. 
Pharmacokinetics and Pop PK  
The serum concentration-time courses for TCZ in sJIA patients with decreased TCZ dose frequency were 
consistent with the previously established pharmacokinetic characteristics and pop PK of TCZ in sJIA 
patients. 
This previously established population PK model was used as reference to analyze the PK data collected in 
Part 2 of the Study WA28029 in sJIA patients with decreased tocilizumab dose frequency. The model is 
deemed fit for that purpose. A Bayesian feedback analysis was conducted by fixing the tocilizumab 
population PK parameters and by assuming that PK properties are consistent in sJIA patients across the 
different dosing frequencies.  
The final PK dataset resulting from Phase IV Study WA28029 consisted of 495 measurable serum 
concentrations following the 8 mg/kg IV for sJIA patients weighing ≥ 30 kg and 12 mg/kg IV Q2W for 
sJIA patients weighing < 30 kg, either Q3W or Q4W. Patients in Study WA28029 ranged from 5 to 17 
years old, with the median age of 10 years. 
Evaluation of PK results indicate that the PK concentration-time data for sJIA patients with decreased TCZ 
dose frequency are in agreement with the population PK model previously developed for TCZ. 
Reduction of the dosing frequency from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W led to a decrease in exposure 
metrics. Post-infusion concentration (Cmax) at 12 weeks decreased due to a lower accumulation, with -16

and -26% from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W, respectively. The area under the curve during a dosing 
interval (AUCt) is decreasing in the same proportion with -15 and -30%, respectively. The decrease of the 
concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Cmin) was observed to be more pronounced with -64 and -
87% from Q2W to Q3W and Q2W to Q4W, respectively, and can be contributed to target mediated drug 
disposition (TMDD).   
PK/PD 
The decrease in exposure, especially in Cmin, was not indicated to have major impact on response in 
terms of IL-6, sIL-6R levels and PD parameters (please compare Section Efficacy).  
In conclusion, although the sample size is rather low (N=22; 495 measurable serum concentrations) PK 
results indicate that PK following decreased dose frequency were consistent with the previously 
established pharmacokinetic characteristics and pop PK of tocilizumab in sJIA patients. PK parameter 
Cmin at week 12 changed the most with extension of dosing interval. Compared to Q2W, when the dosing 
interval increased to Q3W and Q4W, the mean Cmin decreased from 74.7 μg/mL to 27.2 μg/mL and 9.73 
μg/mL, respectively. Cmax and AUCτ decreased with about 15% (Q3W) and 30% (Q4W). 
As PK is characterized by a high degree of TMDD and by a strong effect of body weight on PK, conclusions 
on the PK/PD relationship with respect to efficacy and safety in general should be drawn with caution, 
given the small population Part 2 of the study is based on.  
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) 
Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was a 96-week, two part, Phase IV study to explore the efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) in 
reduced dosing frequency regimens in patients with adequately controlled sJIA who had experienced a 
pre-defined laboratory abnormality which had resolved on TCZ twice weekly dosing. 
The purpose of Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was to investigate the use of less frequent dosing upon 
reinitiating treatment in patients who have achieved a high level of efficacy with TCZ but have 
experienced these laboratory abnormalities 
The study comprised a run-in phase (Part 1) and the main study (Part 2). Patients could enter Part 2 
directly, or via Part 1.

In Part 2 of the study, eight patients (36.4%) receiving TCZ Q3W were discontinued from the study. For 
the patients on TCZ Q3W at the time of withdrawal, three patients discontinued due to physician decision, 
and one patient each for lack of efficacy, protocol violation (violation of entry criteria), AE, withdrawal by 
the patient, and‘other’. Two of the patients who were withdrawn due to physician decision were in clinical 
remission of their sJIA, and a reduced TCZ dosing regimen was sought outside of the protocol, and one 
patient was withdrawn by the physician due to needle phobia. The patient who withdrew due to ‘other’ 
reason actually withdrew due to a flare of their sJIA.  
One patient receiving TCZ Q4W withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy. 
During Part 2 of the study, only one patient switched TCZ dosing based on body weight. This patient 
switched from 12 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg during Q3W dosing. For reporting purposes, the weight-dosing 
category observed at baseline for this patient was considered constant during the whole of Part 2. No 
patients switched dosing regimen due to a change in body weight in Part 1. 
• 
Conduct of the study 
Part 1 
There were six protocol deviations in four patients. The deviations were for overdosage of study drug (4 
deviations in two patients), violation of exclusion criteria (medical history), and violation of laboratory 
criteria. The patient who experienced a protocol deviation for violation of laboratory criteria continued to 
Part 2 of the study. 
Part 2 
There were seven protocol deviations in six patients. One patient had a violation of the inclusion criteria 
and a violation relating to medication (NSAID dose not stable prior to study entry). Three patients had 
deviations for medications; one patient received commercial TCZ instead of study medication, one patient 
received incorrect TCZ doses due to a change in body weight, and in one patient the NSAID dose was not 
stable during the first 12 weeks of Part 2. The other patients had deviations of the exclusion criteria 
(prohibited medical history - duodenal ulcer perforation), and inclusion criteria (signed ICF). 
No deviations led to the exclusion of data from the analysis. 
• 
Baseline data 
Part 1 (safety population) 
There were nine females and 10 males, the majority of them were white (17/19: 89.5%), and of non-
hispanic or latino ethnicity (13/19: 68.4%). Thirteen patients (68.4%) were between 2 and <11 years of 
age and six patients (31.6%) were aged 11 to <18 years. Median weight was 32.5 kg. The median 
disease duration from the date of first diagnosis was 0.7 (range 0.1 – 15.2) years. A total of 9/19 
patients (47.4%) reported previous non-biologic DMARD use, and 12/19 patients (63.2%) had previous 
biologic DMARD use (including previous use of TCZ) (Table 6). Patients could have received treatment 
with TCZ prior to entry into Part 1 or be TCZ-naïve at Part 1 entry; 10 of the 19 patients enrolled in Part 
1 had previously received TCZ. 
Part 2 
In Part 2 of the study, there were 22 patients (8 male and 14 female) with 11/22 patients (50%) between 
2 to <11 years of age and 11/22 patients (50%) between 11 to < 18 years of age. Most of the patients 
were white (18/22: 81.8%) and of non-hispanic or latino ethnicity (15/22; 68.2%). Median weight was 
38.5 kg. The median disease duration from the date of first diagnosis was 1.65 (range 0.1 – 11.8) years. 
A total of 17/19 patients (77.3%) reported previous non-biologic DMARD use (t_cm_SE_DMARD_CMP2), 
and 20/22 patients (90.9%) had previous biologic DMARD use (including previous use of TCZ). Although 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 18/36 
 
 
  
  
all patients entering Part 2 of the study had received TCZ previously (either during Part 1 or 
commercially), the proportion of patients with previous biologic DMARD use at baseline was <100 % 
because ‘previous use’ refers to the period prior to Part 1 for those Part 2 patients who had previously 
participated in Part 1. 
As it was a pre-requisite for study entry, all patients were in clinical remission of sJIA at baseline. The 
median JADAS-71 score at Part 2 baseline was 0.05 (mean 0.34), with a median of 0 (mean 0) active 
joints. Mean CRP and ESR values were 3.1 mg/L and 3.1mm/hr, respectively.

Outcomes and estimation 
Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS-71) 
To enter Part 2 of the study, patients were required to have a JADAS-71 score of 3.8 or less at screening 
and baseline, and during the study at the time of switching from TCZ IV Q3W to TCZ IV Q4W. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 19/36 
 
 
  
  
 
JADAS-71 scores generally remained near the level of inactive disease (<1.0) for the majority of patients 
throughout the study during TCZ IV 8 mg/kg Q3W or Q4W dosing and TCZ IV 12 mg/kg Q3W or Q4W 
dosing. There were increases in the JADAS-71 scores at the time of sJIA flare as expected.  
One patient had an increase in JADAS-71 at Week 33 which was not associated with an sJIA flare or fever 
due to sJIA. This increase in JADAS-71 was driven solely by the patient/parent’s global assessment of 
overall wellbeing, and all other components of the composite score remained low at that visit. 
JIA flare 
Five of the 22 patients enrolled in Part 2 of the study experienced a flare, with one patient experiencing 
two flares (at consecutive study visits). Four patients experienced a flare while on TCZ IV Q3W dosing, 
and one of the seven patients who transitioned onto TCZ IV Q4W dosing flared at week 32 while on this 
treatment regimen. 
During Part 2 TCZ IV Q3W dosing, there were 15 patients on 8 mg/kg TCZ and seven patients on 12 
mg/kg TCZ. Three of the patients who flared during Q3W dosing were on 8 mg/kg TCZ, and one was on 
12 mg/kg TCZ. The flares on Q3W dosing occurred at Week 9 (12 mg/kg), Week 12 (8 mg/kg), Week 15 
(8 weeks after last dose of study drug; 8 mg/kg), and in one patient at Week 18 and 21 (8 mg/kg). 
Two of these four patients who flared, withdrew from the study following the flare for lack of efficacy. One 
patient withdrew following the flare due to a concurrent SAE of hypertransaminasemia, and one patient 
was already in the process of withdrawing from the study for another reason at the time of the flare. 
The patient who experienced two flares met the flare criteria at both Week 18 and 21 of the study; 
however the patient was assessed as flaring at Week 18. 
Seven of the 22 patients in Part 2 of the study switched from TCZ IV Q3W to Q4W dosing, and one 
patient flared during Q4W dosing (8 mg/kg). This patient flared at Week 32 of Q4W dosing (Week 53 
from Part 2 baseline), and withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy following the flare. 
Of the 17/22 patients who did not flare during TCZ IV Q3W or Q4W dosing, 13 completed Part 2 of the 
study. Two patients withdrew while in clinical remission of their sJIA, in order to give them a reduced TCZ 
dosing regimen outside of the study, and two patients withdrew for other reasons (protocol violation and 
needle phobia). 
Fever due to sJIA 
Based on the temperature measurement data collected during the study, there were no patients with 
fever due to sJIA during the study 
One patient (8 mg/kg Q3W) was recorded as having a fever due to sJIA at Week 18 during an sJIA flare, 
(based on data collected by the external vendor) 
JIA ACR Components Used in the Assessment of sJIA Flare 
•  Physician Global Assessment Visual Analogue Scale 
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity VAS was recorded on a scale of 0 - 100 mm, 0 mm for 
no arthritis symptoms and 100 mm for maximum arthritis symptoms. 
The mean physician global assessment of disease activity score was <3 mm at Part 2 baseline and 
remained <5 mm throughout TCZ IV Q3W and TCZ IV Q4W dosing, apart from increases at specific time 
points driven by patients with sJIA flares. 
•  Number of active joints 
Seventy-one joints were assessed for signs of active arthritis at each visit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 20/36 
 
 
  
  
The mean number of joints with active arthritis (out of 71) was <0.1 at baseline of Part 2, and remained 
low throughout the study, during TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W dosing. There were increases in the number of 
joints with active arthritis at times of sJIA flare 
Thirteen patients maintained zero joints with active arthritis throughout the entire Part 2 study period. 
The maximum number of active joints for a patient without flare was 5.  
•  Number of joints with limitation of movement 
Sixty-seven joints were assessed for signs of limitation of movement during each visit. 
The mean number of joints with limitation of movement (out of 67) was <0.3 at baseline of Part 2, and 
remained low throughout the study, during TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W dosing. 
Limitation of movement in at least two joints, during a study visit for a patient contributed to the JIA flare 
calculation.  
Systemic symptoms 
• 
sJIA physical signs 
The presence of specific physical examination findings that are associated with active sJIA 
(lymphadenopathy, rash (characteristic of patient’s sJIA), pericardial rub, pleural rub, cushingoid 
appearance, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly) were recorded at the time of physical examinations 
during the study. 
Four patients had sJIA physical sign present at baseline. 
Two patients developed a new sJIA physical sign during the study at the time of flare: One patient on 
Q3W dosing developed a rash (characteristic of patient’s sJIA) at Week 21, and one patient on Q3W 
dosing developed lymphadenopathy at Week 15. 
Three patients developed sJIA physical signs during the study, which were not associated with an sJIA 
flare. One patient on Q3W dosing developed cushingoid appearance, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly at 
Week 9, one patient on Q3W dosing developed lymphadenopathy at Week 24, and one patient on Q3W 
dosing developed a rash (characteristic of patient’s sJIA) at the Week 8 follow up visit. In all three 
patients, the sJIA signs were absent by the next study visit. 
Patient reported outcomes 
•  Childhood Health Assessment Health Questionnaire ne Disability Index (CHAQ-Di)  
The childhood health assessment questionnaire-disability index (CHAQ-DI) was recorded to evaluate 
functional ability as a scale of 0 (best) to 3 (worst). 
The mean CHAQ Disability Index score was <0.05 (SD 0.09) at baseline of Part 2 of the study, and 
increased to a maximum of 0.34 (SD 0.97) at Week 21 during TCZ IV Q3W dosing then fell back down to 
<0.05 for the remainder of the study. 
 The mean CHAQ Disability Index score was zero throughout TCZ IV Q4W dosing. 
There were increases in the CHAQ Disability Index score in 4 of the 6 flares which occurred during the 
study. In the other two flares, the CHAQ Disability Index score was zero at the time of flare. 
•  Parents/patients global assessment of overall well-being 
Patient’s (parent’s/guardian’s) overall assessment of their (child’s) overall well-being was recorded on a 
100 mm horizontal VAS scale, 0 for “very well” (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and 100 for 
“very poor” (maximum arthritis disease activity). 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 21/36 
 
 
  
  
The mean parent/patient global assessment of overall wellbeing score was <3 mm atnbaseline of Part 2 
of the study, and remained <5 mm throughout TCZ IV Q3W dosing, apart from increases at specific time 
points which were driven by patients with sJIA flares. 
One patient who had an increase in their parent/patient global assessment of overall wellbeing score 
which was not associated with a flare.  
•  Pain VAS 
Pain VAS was assessed on a scale of 0 - 100 mm, 0 for no pain and 100 mm for very severe pain. 
The mean patient pain index assessment VAS was <5 mm at baseline of Part 2 of the study and remained 
low throughout the study during TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W dosing.  
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
ESR values showed a high between and within patient variability over time, but all measured values 
remained below the ULN (15 mm/h) in both dosing groups and regardless to the dosing frequency.  
In addition, there was no clear relationship between ESR levels and flare occurrence in the 12 mg/kg 
dosing group where only one patient flared. In the 8 mg/kg dosing group, flare occurred once just after 
an increase in ESR to 20 mm/hr in one patient on Q4W dosing and once just before an increase in ESR to 
14 mm/hr in a patient on Q3W dosing. For one patient, both flares happened with normal ESR values 
comparable to baseline.  
•  C-reactive protein 
Mean CRP levels at baseline for the Q3W dosing regimen were slightly higher in the 12 mg/kg group (4.8 
mg/L) as compared with the 8 mg/kg group (2.3 mg/L), but not considering the median (0.2 mg/L in 
both dosing groups), including ranges which were quite similar. There was no clinically relevant increase 
in CRP levels over time when TCZ was administered Q3W.  
One patient in the 12 mg/kg dosing group showed a transient increase at week 18 (up to 11 mg/L) 
without any flare, which returned to normal immediately thereafter. Overall, there were very limited 
changes in CRP levels measured over time. 
Observations were quite similar following the Q4W dosing regimen. Mean CRP levels at baseline were 
slightly higher in the 8 mg/kg group (0.96 mg /L) as compared with the 12 mg/kg group (0.20 mg/L: 
note that only one patient switched from Q3W to Q4W in this dosing group). Nevertheless, median values 
were again similar across groups (0.2 mg/L), with one patient showing a value just above the ULN (4.75 
mg/L). Only one patient presented with an increased value at Week 24 of the Q4W dosing period (up to 
19.4 mg/L), which was back to normal immediately after, and which was followed by a flare. The mean 
value of 4 mg/L reported for that time point was mainly driven by this individual patient. Overall, CRP 
values barely fluctuated over time, remaining within a narrow range of values. 
Interleukin-6 
Overall, pre-dose IL-6 levels did not show significant fluctuation over time as compared to baseline values 
in patients dosed Q3W and Q4W, except in one patient in the 8 mg/kg Q3W dosing group who presented 
with a transient increase in IL-6 at Week 27. 
Interleukin-6 Soluble Receptor 
Mean serum sIL-6R levels over time did not show any significant nor sustained variation as compared to 
baseline values in both the Q3W and Q4W dosing regimen groups.

7.3.  Discussion 
TCZ treatment is associated with certain laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and liver enzyme abnormalities. Dose modification recommendations in sJIA are to stop TCZ 
dosing until the laboratory abnormality resolves. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of 
less frequent dosing upon reinitiating treatment in patients who have achieved a high level of efficacy 
with TCZ but have experienced these laboratory abnormalities.  
The study comprised a run-in phase (Part 1) and the main study (Part 2). Patients could enter Part 2 
directly, or via Part 1. The objective of Part 1 was to increase enrolment into Part 2 by identifying patients 
with resolved laboratory abnormalities in Part 1 on the TCZ every two weeks (Q2W) regimen who would 
be eligible to participate in Part 2. Patients could also enter Part 2 directly, without having previously 
participated in Part 1. 
In the run in evaluation period (Part 1) TCZ naive and non-naïve patients who met inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria with sJIA > 1 month were enrolled. Patients received TCZ according the approved 
posology i.e. TCZ IV dosed by body weight (12 mg/kg for patients <30kg; 8 mg/kg for patients ≥30 kg) 
Q2W up to 24 weeks or until they experienced a laboratory at which point they could be assessed for 
entry into Part 2.  
In Part 2 of the study doses of 8 mg/kg for patients ≥30 kg and 12 mg/kg for patients <30 kg were used 
however as agreed with CHMP  / EMA at Q3W or Q4W resp. in order to address the post approval 
measure (PAM) to investigate the dose reduction response to pre-defined laboratory abnormalities in sJIA 
patients. Thus patients were treated Q3W for up to 52 weeks, unless they experienced a pre-defined 
laboratory abnormality. Following the occurrence and resolution of a pre-defined laboratory abnormality, 
patients who had maintained adequate disease control, and had received a minimum of 5 consecutive 
Q3W infusions in Part 2 of the study, were moved to Q4W dosing of TCZ.  
The design is acceptable. 
Results 
Nineteen 19 patients enrolled in Part 1, and finally 22 patients were enrolled into Part 2; 16 patients 
enrolled directly into Part 2, and an additional 6 patients entered via Part 1. Of these 22 patients, 7 
patients completed the study under the in Part 2 of the study is rather small.  
The key efficacy measures were Juvenile Arthritis Disease, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) flare, and 
fever (attributable to sJIA).  
JADAS-71 scores generally remained near the level of inactive disease (<1.0) for the majority of patients 
throughout the study during TCZ IV Q3W and TCZ IV Q4W dosing. There were increases in the JADAS-71 
scores at the time of sJIA flare as expected. 
Overall, sJIA continued to be well-controlled (no flare) in 17/22 patients (77%) during Part 2. Five 
patients (23%) experienced a flare during the study with one patient experiencing two flares (at 
consecutive study visits). 
During TCZ IV Q3W dosing, three of the 15 patients on 8 mg/kg TCZf lared, and one of the seven 
patients on 12 mg/kg TCZ flared. The flares occurred at Week 9, Week 12, Week 15 (8 weeks after last 
dose of study drug), and in one patient at Week 18 and 21. One of the seven patients who transitioned to 
TCZ IV Q4W flared during Q4W dosing at Week 32 (week 53 from Part 2 baseline). The patient was 
receiving TCZ IV 8 mg/kg. 
There were no patients who experienced fever due to sJIA during the study.

The mean values for each of the JADAS-71 components (physician global assessment VAS, patient/parent 
global assessment VAS, number of active joints, and ESR) were low at baseline and remained low 
throughout TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W dosing. 
The mean CHAQ Disability Index score was <0.05 (SD 0.09) at the baseline of Part 2, increased to a 
maximum of 0.34 (SD 0.97) at Week 21 during TCZ IV Q3W dosing then fell back to <0.05 for the 
remainder of the study. The mean CHAQ Disability Index score was 0 throughout TCZ IV Q4W dosing. 
The mean patient pain index assessment VAS was low at baseline and remained low throughout the study 
during TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W dosing.of inactive disease (<1.0) for the majority of patients throughout the 
study during TCZ IV Q3W and TCZ IV Q4W dosing. There were increases in the JADAS-71 scores at the 
time of sJIA flare as expected. 
There were no clinically relevant increases changes in the pharmacodynamics parameters over time.   
In conclusion, the data indicated that sJIA continued to be well-controlled during the reduced dosing 
frequency regimens of TCZ IV Q3W and Q4W. However it should be kept in mind that the data base is 
rather small, which precluded a robust conclusion.

mild in 10 patients (45.5%), moderate in 10 patients (45.5%), and severe in 1 patient (4.5%). The 
severe AE was pneumonia in the TCZ IV 12 mg/kg Q3W treatment group. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In Part 1 of the study, one patient experienced one SAE of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (MAS) 
with a rate of 10.71 events per 100 PY (95% CI: 0.2, 52.0) 
In Part 2 of the study, two patients experienced one SAE each. One patient was in the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg 
Q3W dosing group and experienced hypertransaminasaemia and the other patient was in the TCZ IV 12 
mg/kg Q3W dosing group and experienced pneumonia. The overall rate of SAEs in Part 2 of the study was 
9.8 events per 100 PY (95% CI 1.2, 35.2). 
There were no deaths reported during Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. 
Adverse events that led to withdrawal of study treatment 
In Part 1 of the study two patients experienced AEs that led to withdrawal of study treatment. One 
patient experienced haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which was determined to be not related to the 
study drug and received treatment. The second patient experienced increased hepatic enzymes which 
was determined to be related to the study drug. Both AEs were reported as recovered/resolved. 
One patient experienced an AE that led to withdrawal of study treatment in Part 2 of the study. This 
patient experienced hypertransaminasaemia, which was determined to be unrelated to the study drug. At 
the time of withdrawal from the study, the SAE of hypertransaminasaemia had resolved. 
Adverse events that led to dose modifications 
Four patients in Part 1 of the study experienced 5 AEs that led to study drug interruption. The AEs leading 
to study drug interruption were infections (3 events in two patients) and elevated liver enzymes (2 events 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020

in 2 patients). There were no events that led to the dose being reduced. None of the patients had the 
study drug withdrawn because of these events. 
In Part 2 of the study, nine patients (40.9%) experienced 16 AEs which led to study drug interruption. 
The most common AEs leading to study drug interruption were infections (8 events in 4 patients), 
neutropenia (3 events in 3 patients) and leukopenia (2 events in 2 patients). Three patients had their 
dose of study drug reduced. None of the patients had the study drug withdrawn because of these events. 
Adverse events of special interest / selected adverse events 
•  Serious infections 
In Part 2 of the study, there was one SAE of pneumonia, giving an overall rate of 4.9 events per 100 PY 
(95% CI 0.1, 27.2). This SAE of pneumonia was assessed as severe in intensity, unrelated to the study 
drug and had an outcome of recovered/resolved. 
Hepatic Events 
There was one non-serious hepatic AE of hepatic steatosis in Part 1 of the study that was ongoing at the 
time of last contact with the patient. The study drug was not changed in response to this event, and the 
patient continued to move onto Part 2 of the study. 
There were no hepatic AEs in Part 2 of the study. 
Bleeding Events 
There were no serious bleeding events in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. 
There was one moderate, non-serious bleeding AE of Contusion in Part 1 of this study which was 
recovered/resolved and did not require any change to the study drug. 
In Part 2 of the study, there were three patients in the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg Q3W dosing group who 
experienced a bleeding event during the study. All three cases were non-serious, mild and resolved 
without change to study drug administration. 
Other AESIs 
There were no events reported for other AESIs in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study including malignancies, 
opportunistic infections, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic reactions, gastrointestinal perforations, 
demyelinating disorders, myocardial infarction, and stroke. There were no Hy’s Law or STIAMP cases.

There were five AEs of neutropenia in four patients reported in Part 2 of the study, one in the TCZ IV 12 
mg/kg Q3W dosing group and four in the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg Q3W dosing group. They were all mild to 
moderate in intensity and resolved. In two of the patients the TCZ dose was reduced, in one patient TCZ 
was interrupted and in one patient the dose was not changed. The patient with a neutropenia AE reported 
in Part 1 of the study did not have an AE of neutropenia in Part 2 of the study. 
Thrombocytopenia 
There were no thrombocytopenia events in Part 1 of the study. 
There was one thrombocytopenia AE in Part 2 of the study in the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg Q3W dosing group. This 
AE was mild in intensity and resolved. 
Macrophage activation Syndrome 
In Part 1 of the study, one patient experienced a serious and severe event of haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (MAS) and withdrew from the study due to this event. The event was assessed as 
unrelated to the study drug and the event resolved following treatment. 
No events of MAS occurred in Part 2 of the study.

•  Platelet Counts 
In Part 1 of the study, all 19 patients had a normal platelet count at baseline. During Part 1, a worst 
value of Grade 1 was reported in two patients (10.5%) and Grade 2 in one patient (5.2%). The patient 
with Grade 2 thrombocytopenia experienced a Grade 1 low platelet count at Week 8 and on Weeks 20 
and 22 had a Grade 2 low platelet count. The lowest value was 57x109/L. After this event, the values

Chemistry 
Liver Enzymes 
Changes from baseline in liver enzyme values of Grade 2 and higher were uncommon. 
In both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study there were no patients who had simultaneous elevations > 3 x ULN 
in ALT or AST and > 2 x ULN in total bilirubin (laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law). There were no serious 
hepatic AEs in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. 
•  ALT 
At baseline in Part 1 of the study, 18 patients (94.7%) had ALT values within the normal range, and one 
patient (5.3%) had a Grade 1 elevation. Post baseline in Part 1 of the study, most patients (16/19: 
84.2%) had ALT values of < Grade 1; one patient (5.3%) had a Grade 2 ALT elevation and two patients 
(10.5%) had a Grade 3 ALT elevation. One of the Grade 3 elevations occurred at a single time point and 
was reported as a non-serious severe AE (hepatic enzyme increased) which led to the patient withdrawing 
from the study. The other Grade 3 elevation occurred in a patient during an SAE of MAS.  
At baseline in Part 2 of the study, 21 patients (95.5%) had an ALT within the normal range, and one 
patient (4.5%) had a Grade 1 elevation. Post baseline in Part 2 of the study, 20 patients (90.9%) had ALT 
concentrations of < Grade 1. One patient (4.5%) had a Grade 2 elevation and one patient (4.5%) had a 
Grade 4 elevation. The patient with a Grade 4 elevation had an SAE of hypertransaminasemia and 
withdrew from the study due to this event. 
•  AST 
All 19 patients had a normal AST level at baseline in Part 1 of the study. Post baseline during Part 1, 11 
patients (57.9%) had their AST remain within the normal range, Six patients (31.6%) had a Grade 1 
elevation, one patient (5.3%) had a Grade 2 elevation and one patient (5.3%) had a Grade 3 elevation 
(Table 23). The Grade 3 elevation occurred in the patient who had an SAE of MAS.

(52.6%) total had a bilirubin level within the normal range, one patient (5.3%) had a Grade 1 elevation 
and two patients (10.5%) had a Grade 2 elevation. Of the three patients (15.8%) who had missing 
bilirubin values at baseline, all had post-baseline values of Grade 0. 
At baseline of Part 2 of the study, 18 patients (81.8%) had normal bilirubin levels, one patient (4.5%) 
had a Grade 1 elevation, one patient (4.5%) had a Grade 2 elevation, and two patients (9.1%) had 
missing values. Post baseline during Part 2 of the study, 17 patients (77.3%) in total had their bilirubin 
remain within the normal range, two patients (9.1%) had a Grade 1 elevation and three patients (13.6%) 
had a Grade 2 elevation. Of the two patients (9.1%) (1 in each body weight group) who had missing 
bilirubin values at baseline, both of these patients had Grade 0 values post-baseline. 
There were no Grade 3 or 4 elevations in bilirubin during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. 
•  Lipid Parameters 
No patients experienced either an elevated total cholesterol (> 200 mg/dL) or an elevated LDL (>130 
mg/dL) in Part 1or Part 2 of the study. 
Vital Signs 
The majority of the patients (14/19: 73.7%) in Part 1 of the study did not experience abnormally high 
systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) and none of the patients had low systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure. Most of the patients (17/19: 89.5%) did not experience abnormally high or low heart rates. For 
10/19 patients (52.6%), their weight did not increase >10% and for most of the patients (18/19: 94.7%) 
their weight did not decrease >10% in Part 1 of the study. Body temperature did not increase to over 
38°C for any of the patients in Part 1 of the study. 
In Part 2 of the study, most of the patients did not experience an increase or decrease in systolic or 
diastolic BP. None of the patients experienced an abnormally high heart rate and only one patient (4.5%) 
experienced low heart rate in the TCZ IV 8 mg/kg dosing group. Most of patients (21/22: 95.5%) in Part 
2 of the study did not experience a decrease of >10% in their weight during the study, however, 13/22 
patients (59.1%) experienced an increase of >10% in their body weight. No abnormal temperature 
increases above 38°C were reported for any of the patients. 
Chest X-rays and Purified Protein Derivative Tests 
There were no abnormal chest X-rays during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study. 
In Part 1 of the study, one patient (5.2%) had a positive PPD skin test during screening on Day -14. 
There were no abnormal positive PPD skin tests during screening in Part 2 of the study. 
Immunogenicity 
In Part 2 of the study, no patient presented with positive titres of anti-TCZ antibodies.  
Only one patient in Part 1 of the study showed positive titres at baseline, which were negative at Week 8; 
this patient was receiving TCZ prior to entering Part 1. Hence, there were no ADAs observed during this 
study.

8.3.  Discussion 
There were no new or unexpected safety events observed during this study. The types of adverse event 
observed in this study during Part 1 (TCZ Q2W) and Part 2 (TCZ Q3W or Q4W) were consistent with AEs 
observed in other TCZ sJIA studies. Most patients in the study had at least one AE over the course of the 
entire study (84.2% of patients in Part 1 over a median 0.7 years of treatment exposure, and 95.5% of 
patients in Part 2 over a median of 1.1 years treatment exposure). The majority of these AEs were mild 
or moderate in intensity. AEs in the Infection and Infestation SOC were the most frequent AEs reported in 
the study (52.6% of patients in Part 1 of the study; 77.3% of patients in Part 2 of the study). 
There were no deaths during this study. There were 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) during the course of 
the study (1 event of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in Part 1 of the study, and 1 event each of 
hypertransaminasaemia and pneumonia in Part 2 of the study). Two of these SAEs resulted in 
discontinuation of study drug, and all 3 SAEs were later reported recovered/resolved. T 
here were 3 AEs in 3 patients leading to withdrawal from study treatment; 2 (10.5%) occurred in Part 1 
(one was the SAE of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and the other was increased hepatic 
enzymes) and 1 (4.5%) occurred in Part 2 (SAE of hypertransaminasaemia). 
There were no cases of anaphylaxis based on the criteria of either Anaphylactic Reactions (SMQ Narrow) 
or Anaphylactic Reactions (Sampson’s Criteria). 
There were no cases that met the predefined AESI definition for demyelinating disorders, gastrointestinal 
perforations, hypersensitivity reactions, malignancies, myocardial infarctions, opportunistic infections, or 
stroke. 
Assessment report  
EMA/429735/2020 
Page 31/36 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
There was one event of MAS (haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) in Part 1 of the study. 
There were neither cases of STIAMP nor cases that met Hy’s Law criteria reported in either Part 1 and 2. 
Grade 2 and higher changes in laboratory test values from baseline were uncommon. There was no 
association between Grade 3 low neutrophil counts and serious infections, and no association between 
elevations in ALT or AST and serious hepatic injury events. 
All patients entering Part 2 had previous laboratory abnormalities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or 
elevated liver enzymes) as required per the protocol. Of the 22 patients in Part 2, 12 (54.5%) 
experienced a protocol defined laboratory abnormality during Q3W or Q4W dosing, and 10 (45.5%) 
patients did not. 
There were no new safety concerns observed.  
Conclusion 
The safety outcomes from this study were similar to those achieved in other studies with TCZ IV Q2W and 
were consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ IV in sJIA. No new or unexpected safety concerns 
were observed. 
A pre-requisite entering Part were previous laboratory abnormalities (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or 
elevated liver enzymes) as required per the protocol. sJIA continued to be well-controlled (no flare) 
during TCZ Q3W and Q4W dosing in 17 / 22 patients, 5 % patients (23%) patients did experience a flare 
during Part 2 of the study. Of note, after experiencing a protocol-defined laboratory abnormality to qualify 
for study entry, about half of the patients did not experience any further such abnormalities.  
The study showed that sJIA patients who had experienced a laboratory abnormality (low neutrophils, low 
platelets, or increased ALT or AST) during IV TCZ Q2W treatment could maintain efficacy during an 
increased dosing interval of TCZ IV Q3W or Q4W, however, the MAA concluded that the data are not 
sufficient to introduce an SPC amendment on advice on dose adjustment in sJIA patients who experience 
laboratory abnormalities. Instead the MAH propose an administrative amendment: 
Original Text: 
Reduction of tocilizumab dose due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in sJIA patients. 
Proposed Revision: 
There are insufficient clinical data to assess the impact of a tocilizumab dose reduction in sJIA patients 
who have experienced laboratory abnormalities.  
This approach is accepted.

III.2 ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES 
The following changes to the RMP are recommended (new text underlined and in bold, deleted text 
is crossed out “deleted text”):  
Studies ARTIS (WA22480) and RABBIT (ML28664, formerly tracked as GA28719 ) are 
investigating The safety concerns of serious infections, complications of diverticulitis (including GI 
perforation), serious hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of 
bleeding, hepatotoxicity, elevated lipid levels and potential risk of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, 
malignancies and demyelinating disorders in RA patients are being investigated in ongoing 
Study RABBIT (ML28664, formerly tracked as GA28719 ). These safety concerns 
were also investigated in the completed Study WA22480 (ARTIS). Both are EU registries 
for epidemiological data (Table 22 and Table 23). 
Study WA28029 investigates (ARTHUR) investigated the possibility of dose reduction for laboratory 
abnormalities (low platelets, low neutrophil, and elevated liver transaminase levels), in sJIA patients 
(Table 24). The ongoing pediatric registry (WA29358) investigates long-term safety and efficacy data in 
pJIA patients.

RMP-Table 22 WA22480- (ARTIS) registry study 
Study/activity short name and title:  
WA22480- (ARTIS) registry study: a nationwide safety monitoring of tocilizumab (Actemra) treatment 
in patients with rheumatic diseases in Sweden. 
Rationale and Study Objectives:  
To provide long term safety data from the use of TCZ in Sweden for RA patients 
Study design:  
Phase IV, prospective observational cohort study 
Study populations:  
 Every person treated with TCZ with RA or any other rheumatic disease, in Sweden. 
Milestones:  
First Patient First Visit: 1999 
Annual updates will be provided in the PSUR 
Last Patient Last Visit: Completed  
Final CSR Report: Q4 2019 (Study completed) 
Key Results: 
The final report for this study described the relative occurrence of a series of 
pre-defined safety outcomes in 2068 Swedish patients with RA treated with 
tocilizumab, or with other anti-rheumatic treatments, compared to the general 
Swedish population.  
The results illustrate risks associated with the treated disease or treatment 
context rather than with specific treatments, and also the marked potential for, 
and effects of, channeling to or away from different treatments. Whilst 
accommodating known or measurable confounding/selection factors, these 
results are thus liable to residual or unmeasured confounding or selection.  
With respect to tocilizumab, the overall pattern of risks and relative risks that 
emerges from these analyses is that of no new safety signals, and of risks that 
vary across treatment contexts and that seem to be more dependent on the 
treatment context in which tocilizumab was used/not used than on the 
individual biologic that was chosen.

RMP Table 24 WA28029 (ARTHUR) 
Study/activity short name and title:  
A phase IV study to evaluate decreased dose frequency in patients with active systemic juvenile 
arthritis (sJIA) who experience laboratory abnormalities during treatment with tocilizumab 
Rationale and study objectives:  
To investigate the use of less frequent dosing upon reinitiating treatment in patients 
who have achieved a high level of efficacy with TCZ but have experienced laboratory 
abnormalities (including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormalities) in 
sJIA patients.  
Study design: A 96-week, two-part, phase IV study to explore the efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of reduced dosing frequency of TCZ in 
patients with adequately controlled sJIA who have experienced a laboratory abnormality which has 
resolved..  
Study populations: Children aged 2 years up to and including aged 17 years with sJIA ≥ 1 month 
and currently receiving TCZ who have experienced a predefined, resolved laboratory abnormality. 
Milestones:  
First Patient First Visit: June 2013 
Last Patient Last Visit: Q4 2019 
Final CSR: May April 2020 (Study completed) 
Key Results: 
Study WA28029 (ARTHUR) was a 52-week study (Part 2), preceded by a run-
in phase (Part 1) of 24 weeks. During the run-in phase (Part 1) patients 
received TCZ IV Q2W (8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg depending on body weight), and 
in the main study (Part 2) patients received TCZ IV Q3W or Q4W dosing (8 
mg/kg or 12 mg/kg depending on body weight). 
Patients could enroll in the run-in period or directly in the main study.  
Patient exposure included all patients enrolled in the run-in period or the main 
study. This included 19 patients enrolled in the run-in period and 22 patients 
enrolled in the main study. 
This study showed that sJIA patients who had experienced a laboratory 
abnormality (low neutrophils, low platelets, or increased ALT or AST) during 
IV TCZ Q2W treatment could maintain efficacy during an increased dosing 
interval of TCZ IV Q3W or Q4W. In addition, after experiencing a protocol-
defined laboratory abnormality to qualify for study entry, approximately half 
of the patients did not experience any further such abnormalities. However, 
some patients did flare, and some did experience laboratory abnormalities on 
the Q3W or Q4W regimens, so no clear conclusions can be made.  
AE=adverse event; CSR=clinical study report; JADAS= juvenile arthritis disease activity 
score; PD= pharmacodynamics; sJIA=systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Q2W= once 
every two weeks; Q3W=once every three weeks; Q4W= once every four weeks; 
RA=rheumatoid arthritis; TCZ = tocilizumab  
9.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
In summary, it can be said that the study ultimately only led to formal changes of the EU-RMP (see above) 
and the SmPC of RoActemra (tocilizumab).  
The Package Leaflet (PL) needs no update.

As a result of this variation, section 4.2 of the SmPC are being updated. The following changes to the 
SmPC are proposed and recommended (new text underlined and in bold, deleted text is crossed out 
“deleted text”):  
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration (abbreviated) 
Special populations (Paediatric patients/sJIA Patients) 
Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in sJIA 
patients (-Liver enzyme abnormalities; -Low absolute neutrophil count (ANC); -Low platelet count).  
Reduction of tocilizumab dose due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in sJIA 
patients. There are insufficient clinical data to assess the impact of a tocilizumab dose 
reduction in sJIA patients who have experienced laboratory abnormalities.

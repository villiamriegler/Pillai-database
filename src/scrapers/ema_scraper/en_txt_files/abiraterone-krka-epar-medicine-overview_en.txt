Abiraterone Krka (abiraterone acetate) 
An overview of Abiraterone Krka and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is Abiraterone Krka and what is it used for? 
Abiraterone Krka is a cancer medicine used to treat men with metastatic prostate cancer. This is 
cancer that affects the prostate gland (a gland of the male reproductive system). It is used when the 
cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). 
Abiraterone Krka is used together with prednisone or prednisolone (anti-inflammatory medicines): 
•  when the cancer is newly diagnosed, high risk and sensitive to hormones; Abiraterone Krka is then 
used in combination with a treatment called androgen deprivation therapy; 
•  when medical castration (using medicines to stop the production of male hormones) with androgen 
deprivation therapy has not worked or no longer works in men who have either no symptoms or 
only mild symptoms of the disease, and who do not yet need chemotherapy (cancer medicines); 
•  when medical or surgical castration and chemotherapy containing docetaxel have not worked or no 
longer work. 
Abiraterone Krka contains the active substance abiraterone acetate and is a ‘generic medicine’. This 
means that Abiraterone Krka contains the same active substance and works in the same way as a 
‘reference medicine’ already authorised in the EU called Zytiga. For more information on generic 
medicines, see the question-and-answer document here. 
How is Abiraterone Krka used? 
Abiraterone Krka is available as tablets and can only be obtained with a prescription. The 
recommended dose is 1,000 mg taken once a day on an empty stomach. This means that the patient 
should wait at least 2 hours after eating before taking the medicine and must not eat for at least 1 
hour after taking the medicine. If patients develop liver problems, treatment should be stopped. 
Treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose if liver function returns to normal. 
For more information about using Abiraterone Krka, see the package leaflet or contact your doctor or 
pharmacist.

How does Abiraterone Krka work? 
The active substance in Abiraterone Krka, abiraterone acetate, is changed in the body to abiraterone 
which stops the body producing testosterone, a male hormone. Abiraterone does this by blocking an 
enzyme called CYP17 found in the testes and elsewhere in the body. Because the cancer needs a 
supply of testosterone to survive and grow, by reducing the production of testosterone, Abiraterone 
Krka may slow the growth of the prostate cancer. 
How has Abiraterone Krka been studied? 
Studies on the benefits and risks of the active substance in the authorised uses have already been 
carried out with the reference medicine, Zytiga, and do not need to be repeated for Abiraterone Krka. 
As for every medicine, the company provided studies on the quality of Abiraterone Krka. The company 
also carried out a study that showed that it is ‘bioequivalent’ to the reference medicine. Two medicines 
are bioequivalent when they produce the same levels of the active substance in the body and are 
therefore expected to have the same effect. 
What are the benefits and risks of Abiraterone Krka? 
Because Abiraterone Krka is a generic medicine and is bioequivalent to the reference medicine, its 
benefits and risks are taken as being the same as the reference medicine’s. 
Why is Abiraterone Krka authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Abiraterone Krka 
has been shown to have comparable quality and to be bioequivalent to Zytiga. Therefore, the Agency’s 
view was that, as for Zytiga, the benefits of Abiraterone Krka outweigh the identified risks and it can 
be authorised for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Abiraterone Krka? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Abiraterone Krka have been included in the summary of product characteristics 
and the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Abiraterone Krka are continuously monitored. Side effects 
reported with Abiraterone Krka are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect 
patients.

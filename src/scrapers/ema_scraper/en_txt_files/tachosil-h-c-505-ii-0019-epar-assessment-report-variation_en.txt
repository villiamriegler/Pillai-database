1. 
Introduction 
TachoSil (TC-S) is a ready-to-use absorbable medicated sponge, developed for support of haemostasis 
and tissue sealing. It consists of an equine collagen sponge coated with human Fibrinogen and human 
Thrombin, which are well-established components of fibrin sealants. 
TachoSil  was  granted  a  marketing  authorisation  by  the  European  Commission  on  8  June  2004  for 
supportive  treatment  in  surgery  for  improvement  of  haemostasis  where  standard  techniques  are 
insufficient. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in controlled trials. 
The initial marketing authorisation application was based on a clinical development programme where 
haemostatic efficacy and safety of TC-S was demonstrated in two liver resection studies (TC-014-IN 
and TC-016-IN). The programme also included one trial in lung lobectomy (TC-013-IN), which failed 
in  the  planned  analyses  to  show  statistically  significant  results  for  air  sealing  due  to  the  absence  of 
intraoperative  air  leakage  in  an  unexpected  fraction  of  more  than  50%  of  the  included  patients. 
Subsequently,  one  kidney  resection  trial  (TC-015-IN)  was  submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of  a 
variation application (EMEA/H/C/000505/II/0006). 
thromboembolic  and 
Two  studies  were  performed  as  post-approval  commitments.  The  first  was  an  observational  cohort 
study  (TC-018-IN)  to  investigate  the  potential  occurrence  of  post-treatment  adverse  reactions, 
specifically 
to 
thromboembolic events or major postoperative rebleeding. The second trial (TC-019-IN) investigated 
the efficacy and safety of TC-S in liver surgery on paediatric patients between 4 weeks and 6 years of 
age.  The  reports  of  both  studies  have  been  submitted  during  the  current  variation  application 
procedure as FUM 011 and FU2 012.3, respectively. Their assessments are ongoing. 
immunological  events,  and  drug 
interactions 
leading 
With  the  aim  to  expand  the  therapeutic  indication  of  TC-S  to  include  tissue  sealing,  two  additional 
clinical  trials  were  initiated  in  lung  and  cardiovascular  surgery,  where  the  intraoperative 
pathophysiological  situation  required  effective  sealing  of  air  or  blood  leakage.  The  table  below 
summarises the overall international clinical development programme for TC-S: 
Table 1 - List of international clinical trials with TC-S 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this application, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) proposes to extend the indication as 
follows: 
TachoSil is indicated for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote 
tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient 
(see SPC section 5.1)”. 
To support this application, the MAH has completed two additional clinical trials: TC-021-IM (lung 
study) and TC-023-IM (cardiovascular study). Changes to the indication are proposed in accordance 
with the Core SPC for Plasma derived Fibrin Sealant/Haemostatic Products (CHMP/BPWG/153/00). 
In addition, the MAH proposed to update section 4.4 of the SPC by deleting the warning on the use of 
TC-S in vascular surgery, having now generated data on the use of TC-S in cardiovascular surgery in 
Study TC-023-IM. Also, the MAH proposed to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC. 
2. 
Clinical aspects 
Both  studies  supporting  this  variation  application  were  conducted  within  EU  and  according  to 
principles  of  GCP  and  with  adherence  to  ICH  guidelines.  In  addition,  one  site  in  Switzerland 
participated in Study TC-021-IM, and met the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.1 
Clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data was included in this application. 
The MAH considered that the tissue sealing and haemostatic properties of fibrinogen based products 
cannot  be  separated  due  to  the  gluing  and  sealing  effect  of  the  viscous  fibrin  clot  deposited  at  the 
wound site. The haemostatic efficacy of TC-S thus to some extent mirrors the product’s tissue sealing 
properties. This is reflected in the pharmacodynamic properties described in the SPC of TC-S (SPC, 
section 5.1). The collagen sponge carrier adds further to the haemostatic and tissue sealing effect by 
holding the fibrin glue components in place at the wound site, thus avoiding dilution by washing-off, 
and  by  providing  a  mechanical  barrier  to  support  the  sealing.  To  reiterate  some  of  non-clinical  data 
from the original submission, TC-S showed good tissue sealing and haemostatic efficacy with strong 
adhesion  to  the  wound  surface.  Studies  with  experimentally  increased  intra-organ  pressure  are  of 
special relevance and showed good adhesive and sealing properties of TC-S. One non-clinical study 
showed good haemostatic efficacy of TC-S under hyper-fibrinolytic conditions. A further study tested 
the  adhesive  and  sealing  properties  of  TC-S  in  an  ex  vivo  artificial  lung  model,  mimicking  the 
application  on  the  visceral  pleura  of  the  lung  for  air  sealing.  TC-S  was  shown  to  withstand  an  air 
pressure of approximately 65 hPa, which is in the upper range of physiological airway pressures, e.g. 
during  a  strong  cough.  The  above  investigations  were  designed  to  test  the  tissue  sealing  and 
haemostatic  efficacy  of  TC-S  (lacking  the  anti-fibrinolytic  aprotinin)  compared  to  the  predecessor 
product  TachoComb  H  (with  aprotinin).  There  could  be  a  potential  interaction  with  concomitantly 
used anticoagulants such as heparin. This question has been investigated as part of the post-marketing 
safety monitoring study (TC-018-IN). 
2.2 
Clinical efficacy 
The clinical evidence in support of this variation was derived from two pivotal trials concerning the 
tissue sealing efficacy and safety of TC-S. The trials were designed to demonstrate tissue sealing from 
two different surgical settings. The outcome variables of the lung lobectomy trial (study TC-021-IM) 
reflect directly the pure tissue sealing properties of TC-S, i.e. intra- and postoperative sealing against 
alveolar  air  leakage,  while  the  endpoints  of  the  cardiovascular  trial  (study  TC-023-IM)  reflect  the 
ability  of  TC-S  to  establish  a  mechanical  barrier  against  the  high  pressure  of  arterial  bleeding  and 
induce local haemostasis at the site of application. In addition, the latter trial was intended to generate 
clinical data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of TC-S as suture support in vascular surgery.

It  is  important  to  stress  that  the  applicant  has  already  conducted  a  trial  with  TC-S  in  pulmonary 
lobectomy  (TC-013-IN),  in  which  189  subjects  scheduled  for  lobectomy  due  to  lung  cancer  were 
included. The design of TC-013-IN was essentially identical to that of the TC-021-IM trial, except for 
the following: (i) Subjects with absence of persistent air leakage (Grade 0) following lobectomy and 
primary  stapling  were  included,  and  (ii)  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  presence  of  air  leakage 
48 hours  after  surgery.  Unexpectedly,  about  half  of  the  subjects  achieved  Grade  0  air  leakage 
following  the  primary  stapling,  thus  eroding  the  power  of  the  trial.  This  caused  the  outcome  of  the 
planned analyses of difference in treatment efficacy to be statistically insignificant. The ITT analysis 
of all subjects in TC-013-IN, regardless of the degree of air leakage at randomisation, showed that air 
leakage  48  (±  6)  hours  after  surgery  (primary  efficacy  endpoint)  was  present  in  34%  for  TC-S  and 
37%  for  standard  treatment  (p=0.76).  The  odds  ratio  (OR)  of  presence  of  air  leakage  with  TC-S 
compared to standard treatment was 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48 - 1.72). Assessment of 
secondary  endpoints  showed  no  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups.  However,  ITT 
analyses of the sub-population with persistent air leakage after primary stapling (Grades 1 - 2; n=89) 
indicated efficacy of TC-S (analyses not pre-defined in protocol). 
Based on the findings of this trial, the applicant has decided to conduct a second lung trial, which was 
to include subjects with air leakage Grade 1 and 2, only. 
2.2.1 
Study TC-021-IM and Study TC-023-IM 
 
Methods 
Study Participants 
In Study TC-021-IM, subjects were eligible for study participation if they had an elective lobectomy 
for  lung  malignancy  with  intrapulmonary  lymphadenectomy.  They  were  randomized  to  TachoSil  or 
standard  surgical  treatment  when  intraoperative  air  leakage  had  been  assessed  by  water  submersion 
test.  Air  leakage  Grade  1  (mild,  countable  bubbles)  and  Grade  2  (moderate,  stream  of  bubbles) 
qualified  for  inclusion.  Patients  with  air  leakage  Grade  3  (severe,  coalesced  bubbles)  could  be 
reassessed  by  submersion  test  after  further  stapling  or  limited  suturing.  Patients  with  no  air  leakage 
(Grade 0) were not eligible for inclusion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Study TC-023-IM, patients undergoing a planned elective surgery on the heart, the ascending aorta 
or aortic arch and requiring a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure were included. 
Treatments 
TachoSil is a sterile, ready-to-use, absorbable sponge for intra-operative topical application. It consists 
of an equine collagen sponge coated with the fibrin glue components human fibrinogen (5.5 mg/cm2) 
and human thrombin (2.0 IU/cm2). The active side is coloured with riboflavin. The sponge size used in 
both trials was 9.5 x 4.8 x 0.5 cm and could be cut. The sponge(s) had to cover the site(s) at least 1 – 
2 cm beyond the immediate margins. If more than one sponge was used, the individual sponges had to 
overlap. The sponge(s) should be applied with pressure for 3 min. 
Patients randomized to the control group received (additional) standard treatments. 
In the lung study these should be sutures, staples or even no treatment according to the routine at the 
site. Forty-two (28%) of the 150 standard treatment subjects had no additional standard treatment after 
randomisation.  During  the  first  round  of  trial  treatment,  suturing  was  used  in  79  subjects  (53%), 
stapler in 23 (15%) and other standard treatment in 4 subjects (3%). 
In the cardiovascular study standard haemostatic treatment should be any haemostatic fleece material 
without  additional  active  coagulation  stimulating  compounds,  applied  with  pressure  for  3  minutes. 
Twenty-eight  (49%)  patients  in  the  standard  treatment  group  were  treated  with  compression  and 
gauze, 24 (42%) with compression and fibrillar absorbable haemostatic fleece, 4 (7%) with suture and 
1 (2%) with Tissucol®. 
Objectives 
Study  TC-021-IM  compared  the  sealing  efficacy  and  safety  of  TachoSil  versus  standard  surgical 
treatment  as  secondary  management  of  intra-operative  pulmonary  air  leakage  after  lobectomy  in 
subjects with lung malignancies with or without metastases. 
Study TC-023-IM compared the efficacy and safety of TachoSil in cardiovascular surgery to standard 
treatment of haemorrhage. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
In  study  TC-021-IM,  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage 
following provocation by coughing; secondary efficacy endpoint was the reduction of intra-operative 
air leakage intensity after the first  application of trial treatment.  Descriptive variables  were the total 
number  of  days  until  removal  of  the  (last)  chest  drain  and  predefined  post-operative  complications 
(pneumonia,  pulmonary  embolism,  atelectasis  of  the  lung,  surgical  wound  infection,  cardiac 
arrhythmia, progression/increase of soft tissue emphysema documented by X-ray, need for additional 
chest  drainage,  need  for  re-operation,  need  for  respiratory  assistance,  bleeding  and  need  for  blood 
transfusion). 
Primary efficacy endpoint in study TC-023-IM was the proportion of patients achieving haemostasis 
after 3 minutes and, as secondary efficacy endpoint, haemostasis after 6 minutes. If haemostasis was 
not achieved after 3 minutes, another piece of trial treatment (TC-S or standard fleece material) was 
applied for 3 min. If haemostasis was achieved, “time to haemostasis” was recorded as 6 min. If after 
6  min,  haemostasis  was  not  achieved,  rescue  treatment  could  be  initiated.  Other  endpoints  were  the 
incidence  of  re-operation  due  to  bleeding  complications,  post-operative  transfusion,  duration  and 
volume of drainage. 
Sample size 
The  calculation  of  the  sample  size  for  Study  TC-021-IM  was  based  on  experience  from  previous 
clinical  trias.  In  study  TC-013-IN  subjects  with  intra-operative  air  leakage  grade  >  0  had  a  median 
duration of post-operative air leakage of 1 day when treated with TachoSil and 2 days when allocated 
to standard treatment. Based on these data, 10,000 trials were simulated by selecting subjects from the 
above  mentioned  subpopulation  in  TC-013-IN  using  random  sampling  with  replacement.  Equal 
number of subjects was chosen from each of the two treatment groups and in each trial the log-rank 
test performed to assess the difference between treatments. The percentage of trials with the log-rank 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
test  showing  statistical  significance  for  α  =  5%  was  used  as  power  estimate.  Based  on  these 
simulations  a  total  sample  size  of  300  subjects,  resulting  in  a  (simulated)  power  of  about  94%  was 
chosen. 
For  Study  TC-023-IM,  anticipating  a  75%  responder  rate  (i.e.  patients  with  haemostasis  after  3 
minutes) in the TachoSil group vs. 45% responder in the comparator group, a chi-squared test would 
require 61 patients per group to detect this difference with 90% power (Type I error: 0.05, 2-sided). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised to either TachoSil or additional (standard) surgical treatment (TC-021-IM) 
and standard haemostatic treatment (TC-023-IM) respectively by means of a central Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS). After having received specific user (site) identification, trial identification 
and age of the subject to be randomised, the IVRS informed the investigator of subject number and the 
trial treatment allocated to the subject. In both trials block randomisation (block length: 10 in trial TC-
021-IM, 4 in trial TC-023-IM) was applied using a randomisation ratio (TachoSil : comparator) of 1:1. 
Blinding (masking) 
Due  to  practical  reasons  (comparison  to  standard  surgical  and  standard  haemostatic  treatment), 
blinding was not possible. Thus, the studies were performed as open-label studies. 
Statistical methods 
For  the  efficacy  analyses,  in  general,  statistical  tests  were  decided  applying  α  =  5%  (2-sided).  The 
primary  analysis  in  both  trials  was  performed  for  the  ITT  population  comprising  of  all  patients 
randomised  who  were  treated,  additional  analyses  were  performed  on  pre-specified  PP  populations. 
Continuous  data  were  summarised  by  the  number  of  valid  and  missing  values,  mean,  standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data were summarised by absolute and 
relative frequencies. 
The  primary  parameter  of  efficacy  in  study  TC-021-IM,  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage  was 
analysed by means of a life table analysis. Since air leakage was recorded at nominal time points, i.e. 
the  evening  on  the  day  of  surgery,  1st  shift  on  the  day  after  surgery  etc.  the  actual  time  points  of 
sealing  were  not  observed  but  attributed  to  one  of  the  time  intervals  Day  0operation-Day  0evening,  Day 
0evening - Day 1morning, Day 1morning - Day 1evening, etc. Subjects that did not obtain absence of air leakage 
were censored at the day of the last assessment. In case this assessment was missing, post-operative air 
leakage was censored at the time of the last available assessment. Subjects needing rescue treatment 
were  censored  at  the  maximum  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage  (whether  censored  or  not) 
among  all  other  subjects.  The  Log-rank  test  of  equality  over  treatments  stratified  for  centre  was 
performed using the life table method. 
An  exploratory  parametric  survival  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  accounting  for  the  interval 
censoring,  was  performed  using  an  accelerated  failure  time  model.  The  distribution  of  the  observed 
event times was compared with standard distributions within the framework of accelerated failure time 
models. A Weibull model with factors treatment and centre was subsequently selected on the basis of 
log-likelihood tests. In this analysis the actual time  points of air leakage assessment were used. The 
time to sealing was measured from the time point of the last water submersion test. 
Sensitivity  analyses,  applying  different  censoring  mechanisms  and/or  policies  to  substitute  missing 
values were performed for the primary analysis model in order to assess the robustness of the study 
results. 
The  secondary  efficacy  parameter,  reduction  in  intra-operative  air  leakage  intensity  after  the  first 
application of trial treatment was analysed by means of a Wilcoxon test. 
All  other  efficacy  variables  were  summarised  by  means  of  descriptive  statistical  characteristics  as 
mentioned above. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study TC-023-IM, the proportion of subjects achieving haemostasis 
at 3 min in the target area was analysed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for 
centre (data from small centres pooled). Homogeneity of results across (pooled) centres was assessed 
by means of  a Breslow-Day test. The null hypothesis of no treatment was to  be rejected in case the 
CMH test resulted in a p-value < 0.05. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  same  method  as  for  the  primary  endpoint  was  used  to  assess  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoint, 
proportion of subjects achieving haemostasis after 6 min. All other efficacy parameters were described 
by means of statistical characteristics. 
For  the  Safety  analyses  in  both  studies,  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  were  coded  according 
MedDRA version 10.1 and tabulated stratified by treatment, system organ class (SOC), preferred term 
(PT),  severity  and  relation.  The  number  of  TachoSil  sponges  used  are  summarised  by  descriptive 
statistics.  Laboratory  values  from  day  after  surgery  (only  study  TC-021-IM)  and  discharge  were 
plotted  against  the  values  from  baseline  for  both  treatments.  Changes  in  laboratory  values  from 
baseline  were  compared  between  treatments  by  means  of  Mann-Whitney  test.  Vital  signs  were 
summarised by descriptive statistics by treatment and day.

In  study  TC-021-IM  a  total  of  301  patients  were  randomized  at  12  centres  in  8  European  countries. 
The trial took place between January 2006 (first patient in) and March 2007 (last patient out). Of note, 
an amendment to the protocol (Amendment 1, March 2006) discarded the testing of neo-antigenicity. 
In  study  TC-023-IM  a  total  of  120  patients  were  randomized  at  10  centres  in  5  European  countries. 
The trial took place between June 2006 (first patient in) and September 2007 (last patient out). 
In both trials the primary analyses were performed for the ITT population as outlined in Table 3. 
Baseline data 
In  both  trials,  patients  were  well  matched  with  respect  to  their  demographic  and  baseline  data.  The

Figure 1 - TC-021-IM, duration of air leakage 
Thirty  three  percent  (TachoSil)  and  27%  (standard  treatment)  of  patients  had  no  air  leakage  in  the 
evening  of  the  day  of  surgery.  The  percentage  of  subjects  without  air  leakage  was  higher  in  the 
TachoSil  group  at  all  selected  time  points.  This  was  supported  by  the  results  of  a  log-rank  test 
indicating  a  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.030)  shorter  duration  of  post-operative  air  leakage  in  the 
TachoSil group compared to standard treatment. 
An exploratory parametric analysis using an accelerated failure time model, resulted in an estimated 
median  time  until  cessation  of  air  leakage  of  15.3  h  for  TachoSil  and  20.5  h  for  standard  treatment 
(p=0.150). 
A sensitivity analysis supports the trend in favour of TachoSil as seen in the primary analysis: when 
assigning the longest post-operative duration of air leakage recorded to censored observations in the 
TachoSil group the analysis just failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.051). To assess the impact 
of  the  use  of  Heimlich  valves  on  the  primary  endpoint,  subjects  treated  with  Heimlich  valves  were 
consequently assigned the longest observed post-operative duration of air leakage across all subjects 
(20 days). This analysis resulted in a statistically significant difference in favour of TachoSil treatment 
(p=0.032).  Also  the  log-rank  test  performed  on  the  PP  population  provided  statistical  evidence  of  a 
shorter duration of post-operative air leakage in the TachoSil group (p=0.006). 
Study TC-023-IM primary endpoints results 
Haemostasis within 3 minutes was reached in 44/59 (74.6%) patients in the TachoSil group compared 
to 20/60 (33.3%) patients following standard treatment. This difference was statistically significant (p 
<  0.001,  CMH-test).  When  analysing  the  PP  population,  similar  results  were  observed  (TachoSil: 
44/59 (74.6%), standard treatment: 18/52 (34.6%), p < 0.001). 
Study TC-021-IM Ancillary analyses 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  secondary  efficacy  parameter,  reduction  of  intra-operative  air  leakage  intensity,  revealed  an 
advantage for TachoSil. 105/147 (71%) of patients treated with TachoSil achieved reduction of at least 
one grade compared to 90/145 (62%) patients in the standard group (p = 0.04). 
Table 10 - Number (%) of patients with different grades of intra-operative air leakage intensity before 
and after randomisation 
Minor  advantages  for  TachoSil  were  found  in  the  mean  number  of  days  until  chest  drain  removal 
(4.9 days TachoSil; 5.5 days standard) and days until discharge (9.3 TachoSil; 9.7 Standard)

Haemostasis  after  6  minutes  was  achieved  in  56/59  (95%)  patients  treated  with  TachoSil  and  in 
43/60 (72%) patients in the standard group (p < 0.001). In the subgroup of patients with trial treatment 
before  protamine  infusion  the  proportion  with  haemostasis  at  3  minutes  was  in  favour  of  TachoSil 
(7/10 vs.  5/9,  n.s.)  however  for  haemostasis  at  6  minutes  no  difference  was  seen  (9/10  vs.  8/9).  For 
patients  with  trial  treatment  during  or  after  protamine  the  proportion  with  haemostasis  at  3  minutes 
was 80% (TachoSil) vs. 32% (Standard, p < 0.001). For haemostasis at 6 minutes there was also an 
advantage  for  TachoSil  (98%  vs.  75%,  p  <  0.001).  Median  duration  of  drainage  was  comparable 
between  the  TachoSil  group  (46  days)  compared  to  standard  treatment  (44  days).  Volume  of  post-
operative  drainage  was  slightly  higher  following  TachoSil  (median:  600  ml)  than  for  standard 
treatment (median: 498 ml). 
In a substantial proportion of patients, trial treatment was applied after surgical procedures on vessels 
(aorta,  coronary  anastomosis  or  pulmonary  artery).  An  exploratory  analysis  (not  pre-specified)  was 
made  of  the  efficacy  of  trial  treatment  in  this  subgroup,  according  to  the  defined  target  area  of 
bleeding. The results are presented in Table 11, comparing the application on vessels with application 
on heart tissue (left/right atrium or ventricle) in ITT population.

In the TachoSil group, 17 (27%) subjects had 24 intra-operative transfusions compared to 21 (37%) 
subjects with 25 transfusions in the control group. Post-operatively, 26 (42%) patients with TachoSil 
had  51  transfusions  and  22  (39%)  patients  with  standard  treatment  had  44  transfusions.  Three  (5%) 
TachoSil  and  17  (28%)  standard  treatment  subjects  were  treatment  failures  and  received  rescue 
treatment.  The  mean  duration  of  stay  in  hospital  was  11.4  and  13.8  days  for  TachoSil  and  control 
subjects, respectively. Mean duration of drainage was 93 h in TachoSil subjects and 67 h in controls 
with  a  mean  volume  of  post-operative  drainage  of  1,005  ml  and  932  ml,  respectively.  Re-operation 
was performed in 3 TachoSil subjects (5%) and 8 standard treatment subjects (14%). The reasons for 
re-operation  were  not  related  to  the  trial  treatment  and  or  target  area.  In  total,  27  (44%)  TachoSil 
subjects and 31 (54%) standard treatment subjects had other post-operative complications. 
2.2.2  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two clinical studies were submitted to support the extension of the indication to include tissue sealing 
and  suture  support  in  vascular  surgery:  study  TC-021-IM  in  lung  lobectomy  surgery  and  study  TC-
023-IM  in  cardiovascular  surgery.  In  both  studies,  the  selection  of  the  trial  population  and  the 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  appropriate.  Patients  were  well  matched  with  respect  to  their 
demographic  and  baseline  data  and  also  with  regard  to  the  surgical  procedures.  The  choice  of 
endpoints  was  acceptable  as  well  as  the  sample  size  calculation  and  the  methods  used  for 
randomisation.  Due  to  practical  reasons  (comparison  to  standard  surgical  and  standard  haemostatic 
treatment), blinding was not possible, also with respect to assessing the primary endpoint in both trials. 
Thus, an assessment bias cannot be completely ruled out. 
In Study TC-023-IM in elective surgery on the heart, the ascending aorta or the aortic arch. TachoSil 
was  shown  to  be  superior  to  haemostatic  fleece  material  without  additional  active  coagulation 
stimulating compounds. Three minutes after application, 74.6% of patients had achieved haemostasis 
compared  to  33.3%  after  standard  treatment.  A  significant  difference  with  respect  to  the  secondary 
endpoint  (proportion  of  patients  with  haemostasis  after  6  minutes)  has  also  been  found.  Clinical 
efficacy has clearly been demonstrated. 
In  lung  surgery  (study  TC-021-IM)  the  percentage  of  patients  without  air  leakage  was  higher  in  the 
TachoSil group at all time points compared to standard treatment, resulting in a statistically significant 
difference for the duration of post-operative air leakage. The estimated median time until cessation of 
air  leakage  was  15.3 h  for  TachoSil  and  20.5  h  for  standard  treatment.  However,  the  results  of  the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint  analysis  of  TC-021-IM  study  were  not  considered  to  be  robust.  The 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
statistical significance of the efficacy comparison in the ITT population is of a borderline significance. 
No  estimated  treatment  difference  was  available  thereby  preventing  any  assessment  of  the  clinical 
relevance of the difference in duration.  In contrast to the ITT analysis, the PP population (performed 
by excluding 26 patients) revealed a  much lower p-value indicating a statistically significant shorter 
duration of air leakage. The characteristics of 26 patients removed from the ITT analysis indicate that 
the  air  leakage  duration  was  similar  between  excluded  patients.  In  addition  a  critical  post-hoc 
sensitivity  analysis  excluding  two  rescue  treatment  patients  resulted  in  a  significant  improvement  of 
the  statistical  difference  of  results  between  ITT  and  PP  analyses  in  favour  of  TachoSil  thereby 
indicating  that  the  presence  of  the  rescue  treatment  has  penalized  an  air  leakage  duration  estimates. 
Therefore  it  was  viewed  that  an  original  ITT  analysis  of  the  TC-021-IM  study  was  sufficiently 
conservative. 
Whether the gain of an additional 5.2 hours (median) in relation to an earlier cessation of air leakage is 
clinically meaningful, is difficult to assess. In the median, the chest drain was removed on day 4 in the 
TachoSil group and on day 5 in the control group. It is acknowledged that the time of removal of the 
drain does not exclusively depend on the cessation of air leakage but also on the production of drain 
fluid and routine procedures on the hospitals’ wards. 
The analysis of the secondary endpoint (intra-operative air leakage) supports the results of the primary 
endpoint  (post-operative  air  leakage)  in  favour  of  TachoSil.  Seventy-one  percent  (71%)  of  patients 
achieved a reduction of intra-operative air leakage of 1-2 grades by application of TachoSil compared 
with  62%  in  the  standard  treatment  group.  Kind  and  number  of  post-operative  complications  or 
additional procedures were roughly comparable for the two treatment groups, as well as the number of 
blood transfusions and the days spent at hospital. However, results of the secondary endpoint analysis 
are considered to be of a borderline significance. 
Overall, superiority of TachoSil over standard treatment has formally been shown in both studies, i.e. 
in  lung  and  in  cardiovascular  surgery.  Patients  treated  with  TachoSil  had  a  shorter  duration  of  air 
leakage or a faster haemostasis, respectively, than patients with standard treatment.

Patient exposure 
 
In the context of studies TC-021-IM and TC-023-IM, a total number of 211 patients was exposed to 
TachoSil,  a  further  207  patients  to  standard  treatment.  Patients  had  a  follow-up  of  1  month  (+/- 
10 days).

Adverse events 
Study TC-021-IM 
A total of 270 AEs were reported during the trial period; 137 events in 66 (44%) TachoSil subjects and 
133  events  in  66  (44%)  standard  treatment  subjects.  Of  these  events,  severity  was  mild  for 
198 (91 after   TachoSil/107 after standard treatment), moderate for 54 (37/17) and severe for 18 (9/9)

Serious adverse events and deaths 
 
In Study TC-021-IM, 32 SAEs were reported: 19 events in 16 TachoSil and 13 events in 12 standard 
treatment subjects. Six events occurred in more than one subject: pneumonia (2 TachoSil/3 standard 
treatment  subjects);  pneumothorax  (2/1);  vocal  cord  paralysis  of  laryngeal  nerve  (1/2);  atelectasis 
(2/0); post-procedural haemorrhage (1/1); bronchopleural fistula (0/2). 
Table 18 - Number of SAEs in the respective treatment arm by system organ class in TC-021-IM lung trial 
Of the 32 SAEs, the severity was mild for 10 (4/6), moderate for 7 (6/1) and severe for 15 events (9/6). 
Causality  possible  was  given  to  three  SAEs  in  three  TachoSil  subjects:  drug  ineffective  (severe), 
pleural effusion and pneumothorax. However, in all three patients, there was an alternative aetiology 
for  development  of  the  event  (lung  cancer  and  lobectomy  in  the  case  of  pleural  effusion  and  in 
pneumothorax; incorrect application of the TC-S sponges in the case of drug ineffective). 
In  Study  TC-023-IM,  58  SAEs  were  reported:  15  events  in  8  TachoSil  subjects  and  43  events  in 
18 standard treatment subjects. Thirteen events occurred in more than one subject: atrial fibrillation (in 
1  TachoSil/4  standard  treatment  subjects);  AV  block  third  degree  (0/4);  multiorgan  failure  (2/1); 
wound  infection  (2/0);  cardiac  tamponade  (1/1);  renal  failure  acute  (1/1);  tubulointerstitial  nephritis 
(1/1);low  cardiac  output  syndrome  (0/2);  myocardial  infarction  (0/2);  ventricular  tachycardia  (0/2); 
sepsis  (0/2);  pleural  effusion  (0/2);  pneumothorax  (0/2).  Of  the  58  SAEs,  the  severity  was  mild  for 
seven (2/5), moderate for 22 (7/15) and severe for 29  (6/23). No SAEs of this trial were considered 
possibly or probably related to treatment with TachoSil or standard treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19 - Number of SAEs in the respective treatment arm by system organ class in TC-023-IM 
cardiovascular trial 
In  TC-021-IM,  four  subjects  died:  three  TachoSil  subjects  (due  to  candida  sepsis  plus  atelectasis; 
cerebrovascular accident (this subject died approx. 1 month after the 1-month follow-up); pneumonia 
aspiration plus bronchial fistula) and one standard treatment subject (due to bronchopleural fistula). 
In  TC-023-IM,  four  subjects  died:  two  TachoSil  subjects  (both  died  due  to  sepsis  with  multi-organ 
failure)  and  two  standard  treatment  subjects  (one  due  to  sepsis  with  multi-organ  failure;  one  due  to 
ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction and respiratory failure). 
No death was considered related to trial treatment. All deaths were related to the underlying illness or 
to complications of surgery. 
Laboratory findings 
 
The results of laboratory findings in both trials indicate no abnormalities which could be related to use 
of TC-S. No statistically significant differences between TachoSil and standard treatments were seen. 
Vital Signs / Physical Examination 
 
Findings were appropriate for the severity of operations in patients for both trials. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
 
In  study  TC-023-IM,  most  of  the  trial  treatments  were  applied  after  reversal  of  heparinisation  with 
protamine  infusion.  However,  a  subgroup  of  19  subjects,  10  TachoSil  and  9  standard  treatment 
subjects, received the trial treatment before protamine infusion and interestingly 70% of the TachoSil 
subjects had haemostasis at 3 min. Standard treatment was less effective (56%) in this setting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Discontinuation due to AES 
 
In  total,  five  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  AEs.  In  study  TC-021-IM  this  was  one  patient  with 
candida sepsis and another patient with cerebrovascular accident, both in the TachoSil group, and in 
study TC-023-IM, two patients in the TachoSil group and one in the standard treatment group (all due 
to multi-organ failure). 
2.3.2  Post marketing experience 
TC-S  has  been  marketed  in  most  EU  member  states  since  2004.  Up  to  June  2008  more  than 
830,000 sponges  have  been  sold.  Assuming  an  average  use  of  two  sponges  per  procedure 
approximately  415,000  patients  have  been  exposed  to  TC-S  in  the  period.  No  new  safety  concerns 
have been identified, and no changes of the product labelling for safety reasons have been considered 
necessary. 
During the evaluation of this extension of indication application, the MAH submitted the results of the 
Post-Authorisation  Safety  Surveillance  study  TC-018-IN  (Follow-up  measure  FUM  011).  This 
prospective real patient safety monitoring study was initiated post marketing to allow the monitoring 
of thrombotic events, immunological reactions and potential interactions. The objective was to obtain 
systematic  safety  information  on  all  patients  where  TachoSil  is  used  for  haemostasis  in  patient 
undergoing  surgery.  From  the  results  reported  there  is  no  evidence  that  TachoSil  causes 
thromboembolic events, immunological events or major bleeding, neither by itself, nor through drug 
interactions. (CHMP conclusions adopted on 25 September 2008). 
2.3.3  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety was assessed from the two clinical trials submitted with the variation application. The 
study  population  and  the  exposure  to  treatment  were  deemed  appropriate  and  representative  for  the 
kind of surgery under investigation. Pyrexia occurred with a slightly higher incidence in the TachoSil 
treatment groups. Information regarding pyrexia remains in the SPC. 
Further to the request from the CHMP in relation to cases of hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus and 
rash),  the  MAH  provided  an  overall  Clinical  Expert  Statement  on  the  immunogenicity  of  TachoSil. 
Even if it cannot be totally excluded that equine collagen-related systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
may occur during degradation of the sponge, the CHMP agreed that these events could be regarded as 
single cases and that adequate information is already provided in sections 4.3 (contraindications) and 
sections 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) of the SPC. 
Slightly  higher  incidence  of  atrial  fibrillation  (mainly  reported  by  the  MAH  as  non-serious  AE)  in 
TachoSil treated patients in the trials in lung lobectomy and cardiovascular patients raised a concern 
during  the  evaluation  of  this  application.  However,  the  additional  data  provided  by  the  MAH  on 
patients  with  episodes  of  atrial  fibrillation  indicate  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  at  present  to 
suggest  a  plausible  link  between  TachoSil  and  atrial  fibrillation.  Narratives  of  patients  indicate  that 
atrial  fibrillation  events  were  of  transient  nature  and  occurred  in  patients  who  had  baseline  risk  of 
cardiovascular morbidity. The size of the clinical database of the MAH (inclusive TC-018-IN study) 
with more than 3600 patients treated with TachoSil is more adequate now to address the concern on 
thrombotic and cardiac risks and provided data are reassuring. 
Overall, results from these two studies did not reveal any new safety concerns. Adverse events were in 
general comparable between the treatment arms and related to the underlying or concomitant diseases 
and/or the surgical procedures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
Risk Management plan (RMP) 
The MAH submitted a risk management plan. 
The final agreed RMP version 3.0 includes as identified risk thromboembolic events and as potential 
risks  immunological  events,  transmission  of  infectious  agents,  drug-drug  interactions,  atrial 
fibrillation, pyrexia and off-label use for sealing indication. 
The following Important missing information has been identified in the RMP version 3.0:

use 
Specific data has not been obtained on the 
use  of  this  product  in  neurosurgery,  in 
vascular  surgery  or  in  gastrointestinal 
anastomosis. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  the  results  of  the  Post 
marketing safety monitoring study (TC-018-IN) is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation 
activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
4. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
TachoSil  is  a  ready-to-use  absorbable  medicated  sponge,  developed  for  support  of  haemostasis  and 
tissue  sealing.  It  consists  of  an  equine  collagen  sponge  coated  with  human  Fibrinogen  and  human 
Thrombin,  which  are  well-established  components  of  fibrin  sealants.  Tissue  sealing/adhesive  and 
haemostatic  properties  of  this  product  are  non-separable  and  can  not  be  exerted  without  one  or 
another.  The  overall  haemostatic  efficacy  of  TachoSil  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  MAH  in  the 
previous clinical trials in abdominal surgery (liver and kidney resections). However according to the 
Guideline  on  the  Clinical  Investigation  of  Plasma  Derived  Fibrin  Sealant/Haemostatic  Products 
(CPMP/BPWG/1089/00), a new clinical study needs to be conducted to support any new indication of 
the fibrin sealant/haemostatic products. 
The  efficacy  evidence  supporting  this  variation  application  was  obtained  by  the  MAH  from  two 
clinical trials: promotion of tissue sealing was investigated in both trials by applying TachoSil on lung 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tissue and on heart muscle tissue with endpoints of air and blood leakage, respectively. Additionally, 
the  efficacy  of  TachoSil  as  suture  support  in  vascular  surgery  was  investigated,  since  68%  of  the 
patients  in  the  cardiovascular  study  had  surgery  of  vessels.  Both  studies  formally  demonstrated 
superiority of TachoSil over standard treatment. 
The  efficacy  evidence  derived  by  the  MAH  from  cardiovascular  surgery  trial  comparing  the 
haemostatic  efficacy  of  TachoSil  versus  the  standard  treatment  was  robust  and  adequate  enough  to 
endorse the extension of the indication for suture support in vascular surgery. 
Although  the  evidence  derived  from  lung  lobectomy  surgery  trial  is  less  robust,  the  analysis  of  the 
primary efficacy endpoint in this TC-021-IM study is of borderline but statistically significant value. 
The characteristics of 26 patients removed from the ITT analysis indicate that the air leakage duration 
was  similar  between  excluded  patients.  In  addition  a  critical  new  post-hoc  sensitivity  analysis 
excluding  two  rescue  treatment  patients  resulted  in  a  significant  improvement  of  the  statistical 
difference  of  results  between  ITT  and  PP  analyses  in  favour  of  TachoSil  thereby  indicating  that  the 
presence  of  the  rescue  treatment  has  penalized  an  air  leakage  duration  estimates.  Therefore,  it  was 
viewed that an original ITT analysis of the TC-021-IM study was sufficiently conservative. 
The  indication  of  tissue  sealing  will  cover  various  types  of  surgery  and  it  is  considered  that  the 
surgical settings selected by the applicant in the lung surgery were reasonably conservative. The lung 
surgery study TC-021-IM included patients with lung cancer who potentially had underlying chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  emphysema  and  pulmonary  fibrosis.  Therefore  the  adhesiveness  and 
withstanding against the air pressure/air leak properties may challenge the effectiveness of TachoSil. 
Considering that the results of TC-021-IM study are less convincing but still statistically significant, it 
is  possible  to  expect  that  in  lesser  challenging  surgical  settings  TachoSil  will  produce  more  robust 
efficacy  in  tissue  sealing  settings.  Based  on  statements  provided  by  two  thoracic  surgeon  experts, 
TachoSil could be of better use especially in patients with advanced emphysema and fibrosis since the 
presence of fragile lung tissue makes stapling and clamping techniques limited or impossible. 
An  optimal  ratio  between  the  standard  treatment  and  the  TachoSil  application  will  depend  on  the 
individual patient’s needs and the status of lung tissue remodelling. The surgeon can make decision on 
how  adjunctive/supportive  TachoSil  can  be  in  addition  to  conventional  reinforcing  tissue  sealing 
techniques  such  as  stapling  and  clamping.  The  difference  in  few  hours  in  relation  to  chest-drain 
removal between groups although not very convincing, still translates in gain of 1 chest-drain free day. 
Clinical advantages of using TachoSil were adequately supported with a number of previous clinical 
studies. The product has shown a robust and good efficacy in haemostatic support in different surgical 
settings. A tissue sealing component of TachoSil effect in extra-pulmonary applications was evident 
from studies conducted in abdominal and cardiovascular surgeries. 
Overall, the safety profile of TC-S appears to be good. No major safety concerns derived from these 
two new studies. Causes of deaths in both trials supporting this application seem to be unrelated to use 
of  the  product.  Section  4.8  of  the  SPC  was  updated  further  to  the  additional  data  provided  in  this 
application and reformatted as a table according to MedDRA terminolofy and frequency grouping.  
In  conclusion,  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  the  product  is  considered  to  be  positive  to  promote  tissue 
sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery and therefore, the CHMP agreed for the indication 
to be extended as follows: 
“TachoSil is indicated for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote 
tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient 
(see SPC section 5.1)”.

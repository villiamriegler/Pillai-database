relating to informed consent from the marketing authorisation holder Novartis Europharm Ltd. for the

Licensing status: 
The initial product, Galvus, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 26 September 
2007.

2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Galvus  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full 
application  under  Art  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended,  has  been  given  allowing  access  to 
Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-
marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for Xiliarx consists only of 
Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Xiliarx medicinal product are identical to the up-
to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Galvus. Information on the scientific discussions can be 
found in the Galvus CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
The approved indication is:  
“Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:  
As dual oral therapy in combination with 
-  metformin,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  maximal  tolerated  dose  of 
monotherapy with metformin,  
- a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of a 
sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance,  
-  a  thiazolidinedione,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  and  for  whom  the  use  of  a 
thiazolidinedione is appropriate.” 
The recommended dose is 100 mg daily administered as one dose of 50 mg in the morning and one 
dose  of  50  mg  in  the  evening,  except  for  the  combined  use  with  a  sulphonylurea,  where  the 
recommended dose is 50 mg given in the morning. 
Vildagliptin  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  oral  anti-diabetic  drugs  and  is  a  selective  and  reversible 
inhibitor  of  Dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4),  the  enzyme  which  inactivates  the  incretin  hormones, 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), hormones 
which significantly contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the quality data in support of 
the  Xiliarx  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Galvus  dossier  which  have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the non-clinical data in support 
of the Xiliarx application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Galvus dossier, which 
have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.4  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the clinical data in support of 
the Xiliarx application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Galvus dossier, which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

2.5  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP did not require the MAA to submit a risk management plan because the reference product 
Galvus  does  not  have  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  beyond  providing  guidance  in  the 
prescribing information. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Galvus application, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  Xiliarx  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation for the following indication:  
“Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:  
As dual oral therapy in combination with 
- metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
monotherapy with metformin,  
- a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of a 
sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance,  
-  a  thiazolidinedione,  in  patients  with  insufficient  glycaemic  control  and  for  whom  the  use  of  a 
thiazolidinedione is appropriate.”

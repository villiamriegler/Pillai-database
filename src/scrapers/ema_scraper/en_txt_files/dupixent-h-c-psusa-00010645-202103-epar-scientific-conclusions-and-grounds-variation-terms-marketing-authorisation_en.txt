Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dupilumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data from clinical trials, literature and spontaneous reports and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between dupilumab and dry 
eye is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products 
containing dupilumab should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dupilumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing dupilumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
